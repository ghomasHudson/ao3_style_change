Harry smiled and nodded, walking quickly up the stairs. It was either due to his exhausted brain, or not paying attention to what Molly signed, but he found himself turning right.
“There you are!” He heard a voice shout across the wind. He didn’t open his eyes; it probably wasn’t addressed to him anyways. “Why are you outside? I asked you to grab a table for us?”
Harry stepped forward into the floo and grabbed a handful of powder before dropping it and burning up and away to the burrow.
“And how do you know how I ate in Hogwarts?” He retorted; Malfoy had the decency to look caught out for second before he composed himself.
“What do you mean?” Malfoy rolled his eyes, grabbing the hem of his top and toying with it for a few moments.
“Looks like we’ll need a team to come in and dig the garden actually. Get some new soil in.” Hermione suggested.
“Welcome to the lab.” The slytherin welcomed, brushing past Harry and pulling out a cardboard box underneath his brewing table.
Draco cursed whoever had the worst timing skills in the history of the Earth to knock at that exact moment.
Suddenly a loud knock sounded at the door, making Draco jump and accidentally bash his forehead directly against Harry’s. Both boys shouted curses in pain, Draco’s exclamations growing louder when he bashed the back of his head against the cupboard behind him as well.
“What are you scared?” He mocked. “Is little, old Potter scared of a game of truth or dare? I thought gryffindors were known for their bravery- obviously not.” Malfoy poked. Somehow, Malfoy had always known exactly what to say to get under Harry’s skin.
“If he’s twenty-five, then he should already have married Mother. I can imagine she would be pregnant with me, currently.” He explained. “And since it’s a Sunday, they both should still be in the Manor.”
“What! No! of course not. Why would you ask such a silly question?” Draco’s sneer deepened, he hoped the small blush he felt on his cheeks wasn’t noticeable. “I’m straight, for your information.”
Harry’s feet stumbled over one another, making him suddenly forget how to walk, but he managed anyways.
Sometimes Draco wondered how he knew more about muggle life than Harry. Draco had prized himself on quite how self-sufficient he was. After the war, he couldn’t bear to live in the Mansion off of Lucius’ money, the idea of that almost made him sick. So, he’d left them and moved into the muggle centre of London. It’s taken a long time – and a lot of confusing trips on the underground – but he’d eventually adjusted. Harry, however, was useless at living on his own. He burnt just about everything; Draco was sure that Harry would be dead by now without him.
Hermione and Ron had gotten him a medium-sized bottle of cologne. The packaging appeared to be muggle, so he was extremely surprised when he spritzed it and was immediately addicted to the smell. If this wasn’t muggle, he would’ve probably thought that they had given him a bottle of amortentia.
“Go to page three.” She gave Harry a confused side eye before opening the pages and shuffling around to page three. Within a minute or two she had read the whole article, her eyes skimming across the page like rockets.
Harry ordered a latte and English breakfast whilst Draco chose a black coffee with scrambled eggs and bacon.
“Merlin, Harry.” Draco murmured, pushing back slightly against the fingertips, which were now carelessly circling Draco’s puckered entrance. Harry bobbed his head down lower before slowly lifting back up – inch by inch – until his lips left Malfoy with a soft ‘pop’. At the loss of contact, Draco was split between thrusting back up into his lips or pushing down against Harry’s fingers.
“So, Potter truth or dare?” Harry paused to think for a second, he wanted to pick truth, his whole body wanted to pick truth, but something in his mind just wouldn’t let him take the wimp’s option. So, he trusted the true Gryffindor he was.
Experimentally, Harry holds him by the hips and slowly pulls out an inch, only to thrust back in. The pain seems to leak away from Draco’s face as it’s replaced with pleasure. Draco’s legs tighten around Harry’s hips as Harry does it again. They both groan. “Merlin, Malfoy. You feel so good.” Harry goes a little bit faster and Draco has to muffle his cry of pleasure into the pillow.
It always happened like this, Harry would tell Draco he was going on a date with a new guy, Draco would feign disinterest and carry on reading his newspaper, nonchalantly taking a bite of his evenly buttered toast. Then Harry would leave at about six pm, only to return at one in the morning with some blond bimbo on his elbow, then shag them senseless in the room next door. Luckily, last night Draco had slept through the whole affair, going to bed early in hopes that he would. Afterwards, Harry (being the gentleman that he is) would always make his date some breakfast -which he would burn beyond belief- only for Draco to go to the kitchen to make breakfast for them instead.
He settled on a casual pair of skinny-ish jeans, loose enough that removal would be easy but tight enough to have some appeal. Was he overthinking this? Oh Merlin he was stressed.
“Yeah, what else would I do?” Draco was sure he was bright red by now. Harry took a few slow, confident steps towards him.
Draco obliged and continued the movement of his fingers, this time looking down at Harry when his tongue joined the three to rub against the top of them. His tongue was wet and made his fingers slip in and out of him easier than before. Draco gasped again when he felt the muscle get tangled in with his fingers and enter Draco now loose hole alongside them.
He was not going to look at Malfoy. He could not look at Malfoy and he would not look at Malfoy. That way he would not get distracted by the man’s stupidly red lips.
Oh Merlin, Draco had to get away from Harry before he realised that Draco had a stupid, little crush on him. Not that Draco did have a crush on Harry.
He’d heard about rimming before, he’d even fantasised about it once or twice. But he never actually imagined he would ever get his arse eaten out. Especially by Draco Malfoy.
Okay so, I've got to admit the idea of Harry strip dancing to sexy back just seemed too amusing to not write about. But anyways, what do you guys think?
“Apart from that stupid puzzle.” Her hands reached down to three of the puzzle pieces as she picked them up and swiftly clicked them into the correct places on the board.
Harry made a swift turn to the direction of the bar. He decided to walk around the crowd of bodies on the dance floor instead of through them, even though it would’ve been a lot faster. But Harry didn’t feel like wrestling with crowds of bodies to get there.
Draco’s smile widened at the names, whilst the majority of the family had decided not to gift Draco anything, the three gifts sat in front of him were symbolic of their forgiveness. That they had let go of the past and forgiven his actions, forgotten the old Malfoy and accepted the new Draco. It warmed his heart.
“Fuck!” Harry shouted, before bucking his hips up, shoving his dick into Draco’s face. Draco easily pushed Harry back to the bed and began to rock his hand against Harry once again, this time lowering his mouth so that his lips covered the whole of Harry’s shaft, his tongue still working on the tip.
he’d seen his own erection before, but he wasn’t expecting to see it quite so hard in such a small amount of time.
Harry wrapped his own fingers over Malfoy’s hands and pushed on the skin slightly. Pushing the butt plug in deeper.
At the time Harry had been relatively put out by the lacklustre reaction, but after being cooed over by the rest of his friends, Harry couldn’t help but wish all of them took the news a bit more like George did.
The silence of the room was a comforting hug, and Draco almost felt surprised that even in an unaroused state, his body missed the feeling of being full.
“I’ll show you it, soon… I just need to… make some changes to it.” Malfoy explained, his eyes darting everywhere but Harry.
- he wasn’t a young boy indoctrinated by his Father’s views anymore, but the prospect of leaving his wand in his room and making breakfast the muggle way was mildly infuriating.
“I don’t know who you are, I wouldn’t trust you that easily.” Lucius pointed out, in a very Slytherin manner.
Draco snuggled his head into Harry’s shoulder, sniffing up a deep intake of his scent. Draco was wrong, the cologne Ron and Hermione had gotten him smelt nothing like amortentia, because the smell he was breathing in right now was a far closer match.
“Well Hello there Potter.” He greeted, opening the door completely. Malfoy wasn’t quite as well dressed as he usually was, his hair was softer and ruffled and he was wearing a pair of silk pyjamas, but somehow, this made him look even sexier and re-stirred the now calmed erection beginning to tent Harry’s pants. “I was almost expecting you to not show up.”
Malfoy was wearing a simple white button down that had just one two many buttons undone for Harry’s sanity. Paired with what appeared to be a pair of brightly coloured trousers. Which in theory, should have looked silly and overtly feminine, but somehow, Malfoy had managed to pull off the form-fitting pants.
And then it wracked through his body, making his eyes roll back into his skull and his hips shoot upwards, spurts of white heat coming out of his cock, shooting up to Draco’s stomach.
“Okay… Well… Umm…. It started with me just brewing a memory restoration potion. And I guess that I had read about the amount of unresolved obliviation cases in the Prophet that morning. Decided that maybe I could find out how to make the potion more universal.”
“Oh my Merlin, I love her new album as well! It’s so good!” Draco reached forward and grabbed Harry’s forearm like an over excited preteen. “Play it again! Play it again!”
Harry thanked him with a wave as he left. Harry also noted that all the other tables were being served by a young blond witch. Interesting.
“Fine.” Draco admitted defeat and span the guitar around, now placing his left hand on the neck. “Better?”
They finished their meal and headed over to the barber shop where Harry introduced Draco to his working station.
The cashier looked to be a slightly younger than Harry and had black hair with random streaks of colour brushed through it. He looked a bit shell-shocked to see Harry Potter in front of him. Normally, this sort of astonishment would annoy Harry, but Harry quickly decided that this man was attractive enough that maybe Harry didn’t mind the small amount of worship.
He glanced to his side to see golden, silk rope tying him up to the posters of the bed. He pulled against them, but they only got tighter, pulling his hands even further into the restraint.
She started up another conversation about a conflict she was in at work. Harry pretended to listen, nodding and replying at the correct times to make it seem as though he were interested, but he never let his eyes slip from the crowded floor.
“I’ll have a cocktail, pick any, I like them all!” She informed him, a large smile enveloping her features.
“You know… Me being who I am. It’s unlikely that the ‘Boy Who Lived’ would want me.” Harry ignored the stab he felt at the name.
“No.” When Ginny just nodded her shoulders, Harry’s body relaxed. “I just met him on a night out one time.”
Harry was almost surprised to see the Malfoy family being so affectionate, for some reason, he’d always pictured them as distanced from each other and emotionally guarded, but instead, Harry could feel the love they felt for each other.
Harry became suddenly aware of his soft cock poking out from the sheets and swiftly moved the cover to give himself some modesty.
“Draco, again. He convinced me to move out here after telling me about how much better the potions trade here was or something like that. I didn’t think much about it, I was quite excited by the thought of getting out of France, I also still had quite a fancy for Draco at this point, so I followed him over.” A sigh fell from Cole’s lips.
Harry was obviously just checking him out in an admiring, man-to-man way. There was nothing gay about it.
“Sorry! Sorry!” Draco squealed, pushing himself up onto his hands, he grimaced and clutched his forehead again. “Are you okay?”
“Please Malfoy.” Harry whispered, attempting to buck his hips up against Malfoy again, but he was held down by Malfoy’s thighs. Malfoy pulled away from Harry’s chest moved his hands down Harrys stomach until his long fingers met the black fabric of Harry’s underwear.
“Your order?” Cole reminded, causing Harry to awkwardly backtrack a few steps to the counter. He let out and awkward chuckle before asking for a white coffee and a lemon tart.
“Again, Harry?” Draco announced his entrance, both men shooting their heads over to him in a panicked speed.
His fingers were shaking as they grasped onto Harry’s shoulders, rubbing the muscles back and forth in little circles, admiring the scarred flesh.
He rolled around in bed, confused when his sleek bedsheets were a ghastly Gryffindor colour. He wrinkled his nose in distaste before remembering who’s bed he was in.
“Don’t lie to me Draco.” Harry heard his own voice crack. “Do you even care? Just a little bit?” Draco looked back down in shame. Harry had never felt his heart feel quite so plunging before, it made him want to throw up.
Harry moved backward onto his knees to watch, now having a birdseye view of Malfoy’s open arse, it made even his ears turn red.
Draco’s stomach turned at the thought. Whilst there were definite positives to having Harry Potter as a roommate, one of the biggest downsides was his endless amount of romantic endeavours.
Panic filled Harry’s head and he rushed to the door, ready to go save Draco, but the second he opened it, there was Draco’s tall figure, stood behind the wood.
“How’s the research going Harry?” Hermione’s voice interrupted. She strolled through the door of the cottage; her black overalls now stained with flickers of white.
Harry stared at the oakwood door, he doesn’t know what he’d expected to happen, of course Dobby wouldn’t hug him back. Dobby hasn’t even met Harry before. Harry doesn’t even exist yet.
If only he’d insisted that he didn’t want to sleep with Harry, then maybe they would’ve carried on as they were. These thoughts were keeping Draco up late into the night every day since.
“I’ll see you then.” Harry stood up out of his chair, shooting Malfoy a smile before swiftly leaving the café.
Harry doesn’t know how much he can take, tears starting to form in his eyes. It takes him a moment to realise his whispered chant of
“What?” Harry thought about denying it but he couldn’t lie to Ginny. Not even if he tried. “How’d you know?”
It had only been one week since Harry had seen Malfoy on the front cover of the Daily Prophet, but somehow the man had infiltrated Harry’s mind every second since. Everything around him brung his thoughts back to the blond.
Harry stepped back from the painting and looked, it must’ve been his best painting yet. There was something new about it, fresh. And it made Harry’s heart swoon and eyes ache.
Even though Malfoy had hurt him, Harry couldn’t do it. He wouldn’t dare let the paint obscure Draco’s face.
“Don’t be so boring Harry. We’re young!” She removed her hand to forage in her hand bag, before pulling out a small bottle of what Harry assumed to be muggle whiskey. “Drink some of this, all your worries will just slip away.”
“What am I doing whilst you’re at work?” Malfoy asked. Harry covered his mouth with a hand whilst he spoke.
Harry cautiously moved one hand to rest up on Alex’s hip bone, but he wasn’t given much time to think it through when Alex suddenly pushed him into one of the toilets stalls. Harry gasped when Alex disconnected his lips and dropped down to the ground on his knees.
Harry on the other hand was left standing there, trying to figure out whether that had actually just happened or whether Alex had killed him and he was in the afterlife.
He pushed back against the stretch, riding his own fingers as he gradually increased the speed of his hand rubbing up and down his length, managing to synchronise the two movements to a satisfying rhythm. He pumped his fingers in and out of him, still fantasising the image of Harry thrusting his thick fingers into Draco’s tight arse, loosening him up, whilst constantly whispering strings of dirty words into his ear. Words that Draco was sure Harry would never say to him in real life. But Draco loved it.
“Oh Merlin, what the hell are you doing, Harry?” Draco pulled himself off of his chair to stand next to Harry by the stove. “You’re practically poaching that egg in oil!” Draco stared sadly into the pan, watching the egg slowly dissolve into nothing more than a yolk floating in a bath of thick, yellow oil. “And you’ve got the heat so low that you wouldn’t even warm a mouse on the brink of frostbite.” Draco picked up the saucepan and tipped the contents down the sink, the oil taking a good five seconds to flow out of the pan.
Draco lowered his eyes to Harry’s cock, watching the dark red tip leak for a few seconds before meeting Harry’s eyes. The blond’s eyes had changed from a steely grey to being practically one-hundred-percent black. It almost looked intimidating, but instead it sent another wave of heat down to Harry’s already aroused cock.
“fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck!” Draco mumbled, an endless string of moans coming out with every rise and fall.
Harry looked down at himself, he was only half dressed, but he was used to changing in the same room as other boys from back at Hogwarts, and the communal showers at the ministry. Maybe Malfoy wouldn’t appreciate his bare skin, but he’d thought Malfoy was being a bit overly cautious going into his bathroom to get dressed, anyways.
“Here’s your order, you two.” Harry’s exclamation was swiftly interrupted by Bethany, placing the cakes and drinks down on the table. “Have fun.” She shot Draco a wink as she left.
It was a nice pub from what Harry could see from outside. The walls were a pale yellow/cream colour that stretched up to an upper floor that housed rooms to sleep in. There were four windows on the front of the wall which radiated with warmth framed with tables on the inside were almost completely full.
Hermione had recently developed an eye for fashion, and at the moment these chauvinistic houses were all the rage – industrial white walls and modern looking windows, with swimming pools and training rooms and cinemas. One even had a full-sized aquarium, but that was all too much for Harry. He was only one person, after all.
The café was something Harry remembered existing back in 2004. He was happy to know that the small family business had managed to stay in business for so long.
“Who is he?” Draco forked a bite of his cake and almost moaned at the taste exploding on his tongue. Sometimes he swore they mixed just a bit of magic into these cakes.
“Hermione! You can’t swear, there’s innocent ears in the room.” He scolded, signing his arm down to Hermione’s voluptuous belly.
“What? Of course I don’t hate you, Malfoy. Why would you ask that?” Relief dawned his face for a moment before a worried look returned.
He ran his thumbs along the rim of his waistband, attempting, to give himself enough time to figure out how to take jeans off in a sexy way.
Harry thought back to the night he saw Malfoy dancing in the club. He remembered how Malfoy had touched himself and decided to mimic what he could remember. Harry paused the rolling of his hips to place his palm over his groin and thrust into the skin. Shooting Malfoy a wink before closing his eyes.  When Harry looked back to Malfoy, he saw that his gaze was firmly planted on the hand at Harry’s crotch.
“Of course.” The two linked arms and with a pop and the twist of air, they were both in Malfoy’s bedroom.
“I’m going to my house now, want to come check it out?” Harry asked, ignoring the goosebumps rising on his skin.
Draco felt a knot begin to tie low down in his belly, every thrust tying another thread around the knot, building it and building it until his legs squeezed around Harry, pulling him closer down to Draco.
“Of course you’d like that, your hard cock in me, I’d ride you… I bet you’re a submissive shit aren’t you Potter?” Malfoy continued, lifting his palm to spit in it before fondling Harry’s balls with his other hand. “Of course the man who killed voldemort is nothing more than a submissive whore.”
Harry cast his gaze upwards. Draco followed his gaze and caught a glimpse of the wards burning up through the leaves.
Harry chanced a look at Malfoy, and it was only a slight tinge of pink on his cheeks that gave away the effect Harry’s words had on him.
Upon hearing his name, Harry couldn’t help it anymore and peaked out of the tent to observe the interaction.
Harry blushed and focused on his food. “I hear we have a new Quidditch training schedule this year.”
The real kick to his crotch came at the end of his second month when he went for his first visit with Severus.
Harry nodded. “We have most of them now. Right now we want to lose the trail of the Death Eaters. We had a close call with the last piece, but we have almost lost them.”
Draco asked. This had been bugging him ever sense he met Harry, and he thought their sort-of friendship could withstand him asking.
Harry spent the rest of the day playing Quidditch in the Weasley’s back yard. It was fun to show off his flying skills, and he quickly found out that Ginny was a talented flyer in her own right. All her brothers were protective of her, stopping the whole game when she skinned her knee on a bad landing and insisting that she go bandage it. Charlie, Alec, and Percy didn’t want to fly, but they sat on the ground watching. Charlie would call out unfair plays and keep score. Harry thought it was sweet that they all looked out for each other.
“There are a lot of people here,” Remus shrugged and looked down. “I don’t want to put anyone in danger.”
Remus laughed lightly. “It’s good to see you, Lilly. Sorry I wasn’t able to make it for Christmas. I heard Black was a riot though.”
Draco’s eyes lit up and he scampered over to join his new house mates. I watched as he nodded his hello’s and whispered quietly with the other new Slytherin’s. I was glad that he was at least happy, even though I had heard that that was a house that you didn’t want to end up in.
Kudos and reviews help me know that people are enjoying the story and help keep me motivated to finish!
Not wanting to start any more conflict Harry tried to calm Ron down. “I wouldn’t say they are out of it…I mean no one has played a game yet.”
Severus gently lifted Draco’s head back up. “I am just glad you are safe. I had not heard from you since hearing that you were marked,” fear flashed across Severus’ face, conveying that he had feared the worst.
Draco asked. They were the past ones in their dorm packing up their belongings before heading down to the train.
Cautiously, I pulled back the curtains on Harry’s bed and found him writhing in pain, the covering contorting around his body. His hands were pulling at his dark curls, his face pinched in pain, his mouth open and letting out guttural screams of pain.
When Harry returned to his seat his eyes flicked to Draco, who gave the tan boy a small smile of encouragement.
Draco took a seat on the floor in front of the first bench. From here he could hear everything that was going on down on the pitch, but hopefully no one could see him. He was willing to help Harry out, but he didn’t want anyone to know it.
“It is good to have you all here,” Remus smiled warmly. “I know we were all very worried about you.”
Draco had just written that the captains wanted the seekers to take a snitch and do catch and release drills, giving the snitch twenty seconds after each catch, when everyone got quiet.
When they got to the Weasley’s house and piled out of the car Harry couldn’t believe his eyes. He wasn’t sure how the house was standing, and he wasn’t sure if they would all fit inside. As Ron showed Harry to his room that they would share for the night, Harry got an overwhelming sense that the house was well lived in. That if the walls could speak, they would tell of the immense love that was passed between the people here.
“Good,” Severus leaned over, patting Draco gently on the knee before getting up. “Now, lets go over that sleeping drought you got wrong in class.”
Malfoy turned back to face Harry and stalked over to him slowly, his grey eyes cold. He stopped a breath away from Harry, looking down his nose at him. How he managed to do that when they were the same height was beyond Harry. “Are you mocking me?”
But Draco couldn’t face the look of disappointment on Harry’s face. He tore himself from Harry’s grasp and ran for shore. He only made it a couple of steps up the bank before another stab of pain brought him to his knees.
Harry smiled at the sight. He knew Ron missed his family, and it was clear that they missed him very much.
“You are an absolute menace!” Harry said with a smirk as he swam out to Draco, wrapping his arms around his waist when he got there.
Draco rolled his eyes. Theo could barely hold a broom without falling over, he had no right to call Harry anything less than an amazing flier.
During their days together the fact of Draco’s marking hasn’t come up. So, when the day began to rise to an uncomfortably warm temperature Draco forced himself to stay in long sleeves. It was easier for him just to say that he was cold, rather than have to explain the bandages on his arm.
Harry let out a nervous laugh and tried to relax back into his seat. They talked a little more about the upcoming Quidditch season before Harry’s curiosity overcame him.
The next day in potions Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off of Draco. He was two rows in front of him and slightly to the left, which left Harry with a perfect view of his back and profile. Harry’s eyes scanned over and over the oblivious blonde, until Ron got his attention back on the potion they were supposed to be making.
The whole dorm seemed to turn their eyes to Harry who, of course, kept on unpacking, unbothered by the commotion around him.
Draco was hurled against the stone wall by Harry’s magic. His own magic wrapped itself around Draco to lessen the impact.
“Harry!” I shouted before scolding myself. Yeah, yell at the deaf kid, Draco, that will really help things.
Harry nodded and shut the door. He pulled out the first muggle cloths he found and changed quickly, nearly tumbling head first into the wall when he tried to put on his pants too quickly. He thought about leaving a note for Ron explaining why he went out, but decided against it. They would be back before he got up anyway. Once he was finally dressed he stepped out into the hall, and closed the door quietly. Draco was tucking his wand into his jeans, and Harry did the same.
Severus pulled him into a tight embrace. “Of course, my little dragon,” he said, placing a gentle kiss to Draco’s forehead.
That’s when it hit Harry that he should get moving, or he was going to be late for his first day of school. What a travesty that would be. He quickly got changed and put in his hearing aids. He stopped to check his appearance over in the mirror before grabbing his bag and running down to get breakfast.
I nodded, thinking back to all of the mean things he used to call Hermione and Ron, but he had stopped that. At least I thought he had. Thinking back on it now I realized I hadn’t really seen a lot of Malfoy this year.
Draco was waving his hands again, and Harry turned his attention back to the blond who held up his thumb and nodded.
Draco’s eyebrows knit together. “My choice of friends?” he repeated. “All of them are Slytherins. Most of them are purebloods, which, I’m sure, will make father happy.”
“This should help with that,” Severus easily dipped a cup into the cauldron, and handed it to Remus.
Then reality came crashing down around him. By the end of his first month back most of his friends had stopped talking to him, he was still doing alright in his classes, but the professors were giving him a hard time.
Harry had just drifted off to sleep when there was a soft nock on the door. He looked over at Ron, who made no indication that he had woken up, and slowly liberated himself from the covers. He yawned, and pulled on his glasses, rising slowly from the mattress.
They had just sat down in the back of a pub, because Harry had tried to explain television to Draco, and thought it best to provide the Slytherin with an example.
The white-haired boy came up and sat gingerly upon the stool. So, his name is Draco M…something. Well that is an interesting name. Maybe it is something with the wizarding world and weird names, Harry thought to himself.
What had he done wrong this time? He could have sworn that he was being very very quiet. But when he had looked up to find the door to the restroom everyone had been looking at him, and he didn’t know why. Maybe he had farted and not noticed.
After a quiet trip down the stairs, Harry was finally back on the main floor where the layout was a little less confusing.
Draco had, admittedly, never enjoyed going into the muggle world, but he found that exploring it with Harry made it vastly more enjoyable. They both enjoyed looking at the city lights, and Harry was there to explain all the muggle things to Draco.
“I will try to keep in contact when it is safe to do so,” Severus said, slowly pulling out of the embrace.
Harry simply shrugged. He didn’t really care, he knew full well that he was a horrible spy and figured he had made so much noise that it was obvious.
Harry grinned and made a C with his hand and moved it in two small circles in front of his chin and mouth.
Harry looked puzzled and stepped closer to Draco. “It is too dark to see your signing or lip read,” Harry said softly making Draco strain to hear him over the music.
He was at the bottom of the last staircase when a voice drifted down to him. Someone was up there, and they were shouting, the wind making it impossible for him to figure out who it was. Before fear could make him turn around, he walked the rest of the way into the tower to find Malfoy at the railing, gazing over the darkened grounds.
“Oh, it is good to see you again, Remus. We were actually wondering if you would do us a favor,” Lilly said.
Harry cried out weakly and sat up, pushing Draco’s hands off him. In doing so his hand came into contact with Draco’s mark that was still moving under his skin.
Harry shrugged. He was fed up with being the only one not able to do the spells in any of his classes.
Harry knew it was probably rude to ask, but the question had been driving him mad sense the morning.
By this time, the commotion had drawn Severus from the kitchen and he walked slowly over to Draco and gathered him up in a tight hug. “It’s good to see you,” Severus said, the wavering in his voice revealing his worry.
Well, he wasn’t going to just stand here in silence. Conversation was the preferable option. “Why are you out of the bed…bed!” Harry flushed. “Why are you out of bed?” Harry bit his lip. Well, that went beautifully.
When Snape pulled the blanket off the pair, Draco jumped, his wand aimed at Snape, before he was completely awake. Harry, on the other hand, continued to snore quietly, blissfully unaware of the awkwardness filling the room.
Harry pressed himself against Draco, hands roaming, trying to memorize every inch of the man he loved.
Draco hummed contently and kissed Harry back. Ever so slowly, he deepened the kiss and pulled Harry closer, feeling his growing enthusiasm.
“Yeah. Charlie is gay. It’s really no big deal,” Ron fixed him with a sly smile. “Just don’t be making out with blokes in my bed.”
When they got to the riverbank, Harry easily cast warming charms on the water, until they could see steam rise from its surface. Harry leaned down and dipped his hand in. “Seems warm enough,” Harry said, standing back up.
“At least they didn’t make us work with the Slytherin’s this time,” Ron nodded his head toward where the Slytherin’s, including Draco, were seated.
Draco rolled his eyes at the tan boy. He was asking to be teased, and Draco certainly wasn’t going to be the one to help him out of it.
Harry knew he wasn’t supposed to tell anyone, but he thought he could trust Ron and Hermione. They were his friends after all. Plus, everyone would find out soon enough.
“Thank you,” Remus said, sitting on the counter next to where Snape was working. “It’s just the usual feeling of wanting to rip my skin off.”
Huffing, Draco pulled his wand out and balled his left hand into a fist. He could do this. He was stronger than this.
“It was not funny in the least! The boy could have gotten hurt!” Lilly slapped James on the arm, and sat next to him on the couch.
Remus nodded and took a seat next to him. “The word going around is that your son has befriended the Malfoy heir.”
His thoughts were interrupted by Severus walking into the classroom, his black robes billowing behind him. Draco always wondered how he got them to do that.
Harry nodded and got to his feet. “Draco can help you, Ron. He’s quite good with fires.” With that he set off into the woods.
Draco gapped at him. Harry had never been one to be overt with his affection, and maybe it was the alcohol taking effect, but Draco was quite enjoying it. He stood quickly, and pulled Harry to his feet, almost nocking the table over in the process. Harry shot out a hand to save the table, and their glasses from drawing attention to them, and flashed Draco a shy smile.
Sorry for the long time, but this chapter is one of the longest, so I hope that makes up for it. Not a lot of Draco in this one, but I can assure you that he will be back in the next chapter when Harry returns to Hogwarts. Comments are always appreciated!
Draco watched as blood sprayed from the man’s nose, and he doubled over in pain. Before Draco could react, Harry grabbed his arm and apparated them to the steps of Grimmauld Place, and pulled them through the door.
“There would catch some major flack man,” Ron said, looking apologetic. “I’m cool with it though! And I’m sure the rest of the fam would be cool with it too! They were fine when Charlie came out.”
Everything was too much, too loud. Then suddenly it all stopped, and Draco was being pulled into familiar strong arms again.
“Stay on the ground where you belong, snake,” one of them said as the group continued down the corridor.
Lilly turned to Draco and signed as she spoke. “This is my son, Harry. He is deaf. Thank you for looking at the brooms with him.”
“Sure!” Theodore handed his cup to Draco with a wink, and let Daphne drag him into the throng of people.
Someone moved into the spot next to him and tapped his leg. Looking up, he was met by a grinning Draco.
Harry stared at him. He couldn’t believe that he just told Draco something he has never told anyone else, and Draco was wondering if that is why Harry’s hair was long. He was an odd one.
When Draco lay next to Harry that night, he could admit that in this moment, he was happy. He was content. He was safe.
He waved shyly at Draco, and Draco waited until his parent’s backs were turned to wave back. Harry hoped he would have a good holiday, Draco had been working hard in his lessons and deserved a nice break.
That’s how they spent the next couple of songs, bouncing together with the rest of the house. Draco feeling like an idiot, but having the time of his life.
They had managed to get word to the Weasley’s telling them that they were alright and where they were currently staying. Everything was in code of course, thanks to Hermione. Ron was able to tell his family that he was safe, and they got a quick reply telling them that Ron’s family was also alright. This was a huge comfort to the group.
However, Remus caught the slight smile that graced Severus’s lips. He walked over to Harry and Ron’s room and knocked gently on the door.
Severus gave a shallow nod, and Draco covered Severus’ mark with his hand. He traced the scars surrounding the black ink. They were just as deep as his own, but less angry, as though his skin had submitted to the torment. There wasn’t a clear patch of skin on Severus’ entire forearm, and on top of it all sat the mark, undamaged.
“Glad you could join us,” Severus said, getting to his feet. “I am going to go make sure Molly has everything under control.” And with that he left them alone.
Harry simply nods in agreement, reading over the ingredients list for the third time. Why were five things so hard to remember?!
Being able to communicate with the ones they love is always a great blessing. We get a glimpse into what is important to Draco, and see another side of a familiar character.
Draco opened his mouth, but closed it quickly when Severus rolled up his own sleeve and showed Draco the scares around his own mark.
Draco couldn’t believe that this kid bumped into him without saying so much as an apology. With a huff, he followed the skinny boy into the quidditch shop and stood behind him with his arms crossed.
All of a sudden the lights went out, the only source of light coming through the large windows looking into the lake. A cheer went up through the Slytherins. Apparently the dark meant the party was about to get underway.
When Alec ran his hands through Charlie’s hair, Harry’s conscience came back to him and he hurried back down the stairs, blushing furiously, completely forgetting about washing up. In his hurry he tripped over his feet and fell down a few steps. He was sure it made a huge racket, but wasn’t worried about the two boys hearing, and continued down the stairs at a safer pace.
“You get used to it,” James shrugged. “But Lilly wants to visit her folks, and we thought this time we would spare Harry the annoyance.”
The trio was shocked at the display. They had no inclination that Draco cared for Snape, and it was very clear by the embrace and greeting that they both cared for each other greatly.
Harry dropped his gaze to the floor, feeling exposed under the blonde’s gaze. He was thankful for his tan complexion, hoping to blend in with the surrounding shadows. “I…uhh…you spoke in French. And I…I don’t speak French.”
Harry rubbed his eyes with the back of his hands and squinted up at Draco. “What are you laughing at?”
“They know that I am somewhere on your grounds, but not exactly where,” Harry held out his arms. “We have time.”
Not knowing what else to do, I grabbed his shoulders trying to shake him out of whatever was hurting him.
Night was falling then, but Draco didn’t care. He simply leaned back against the closest tree and hugged his knees to his chest. Closing his eyes he hoped sleep or death would find him quickly.
But there was Harry, smiling up at him with all the hope in the world crammed into those green eyes of his. And per usual, Draco melted at the sight of them. Draco would do anything to make Harry happy.
“Good luck!” Draco called and ran off. He was going to need all the luck he can get, thought Draco. There is no way anyone in Slytherin is going to want a Potter on their quidditch team, let alone as their seeker.
It was the summer between his fourth and fifth year that Harry came to terms with the fact that he was gay. He had spent the majority of the summer working through those feelings he had pushed away for so long, if only to avoid dealing with the feeling surrounding Cedric and the events of last year. Having it haunt him in his dreams was bad enough, he chose not to voluntarily dwell on the subject.
Together they walked quietly to the field. Well, Draco could have been talking to him, but Harry was so embarrassed for asking for help that he kept his gaze focused on the ground until they stopped at the edge of the field, and then he only looked up with Draco waved his hand in his view.
“Miss Greengrass!” Flitwick called with a smile. “Would you be so kind as to take the seat for Mr. Potter, here?”
The words echoed in Draco’s head, and then the pain mercifully subsided. Ever so slowly, Draco came back to his senses and opened his eyes slowly. He was hunched over, holding himself up with shaking arms.
Draco took a deep breath. He would get nowhere if he cursed Harry’s friends. “I didn’t call him intentionally. Something happened, and my emotions got out of control. My magic must have called to him. I didn’t want to put him in any danger, and I didn’t ask to be taken.”
Draco lay in his bed that night staring at the sealing. He couldn’t sleep, again. And, again, it was due to Potter. Today he had not only seen his father hit him, but he had also had the audacity to heal Draco’s bruise. Who did he think he was? Did he think Draco wasn’t capable of healing himself? If only he knew how many times Draco had had to heal his own bruises.
But that didn’t matter now. What mattered was that Draco could finally breath, and as Harry rubbed slow circles on his back, be began to relax.
It turned out to be just the four of them for breakfast. Remus ignoring Harry’s persistent attempts to get him to eat something, Snape glaring at Harry, and Draco casting amused looks at Harry.
Malfoy wrapped his hands around Harry’s hips and pushed him back down to the bed before straddling Harry’s thighs and running his hands over his chest, hairs raising where Malfoy touched.
Malfoys eyes hit Harry and then carried on scanning the crowd before swiftly pausing and returning to Harry’s lone figure. Malfoy’s face settled on an expression of disbelief. His eyes flickered over to the bench opposite Harry, only to see it was empty. Suddenly, a mischievous smirk overtook Malfoy’s features.
But Harry felt no grumble of excitement in his belly, instead, he just fell the low mumble of indifference. He sadly took a bite of his sandwich.
“I know.” Cole replied, immediately slapping his hand up over his mouth. “Sorry, I mean… Oh Merlin, I sound like a creep.” He laughed at the floor in disbelief. “Let’s just pretend the last five seconds didn’t happen.”
But here we go, I still have a bit more to write but it should come out to be about 40,000 words-ish.
Once he was in the hot steam of water though, he felt the knots in his back untie alongside the guilt of having a wet dream over Malfoy.
He strolled through to the door, took a deep breath and then opened it wide. Malfoy was stood behind the door, leaning against the doorframe in an over the top sexy stance.
“I’ve got to say, you’ve done an impeccible job here Harry.” Mia congratulated. “I can hardly believe how quickly you’ve fixed this place up.”
“Harry! I’m close.” Draco screamed, lifting his own hands to pull his legs back further behind his head, exposing his arsehole to Harry’s dick even more.
Draco nodded before opening his wavering lips once again. “It was my old boyfriend, I met him during a real low point.” His fingers fiddled with the frayed blanket.  “I don’t think I ever really
“Ooooo did you find a new guy?” She asked, noticing how Harry’s eyes kept slipping back to the floor.
It was heavy and took a lot of muscle to pull it out from under the bed. But once it was out, Harry took a relieved breath and peered inside.
“No, not at all.” He lied, once again. Malfoy began swirling his long fingers along the rim of the glass, which was now firmly planted halfway between the two men.
“Did you see that article about Malfoy in the Daily Prophet last week?” She asked innocently, Harry suddenly felt his body stiffen as his mind was kicked back to Malfoy. “I could hardly believe it when I read it though, it seemed more likely that Umbridge would’ve become a stripper than Malfoy become a rent boy.” Harry felt his throat go dry. Could she tell that Harry had thought about the article a lot? Was it that obvious?
“It’s okay to cry.” Draco whispered, wrapping both his arms around Harry’s neck, and pulling him into his shoulder.
The conservatory lit up the entire room, somehow turning the cold, moist air from outside into hot rays of light. There was a small sofa against the edge of the glass and another coffee table. Whilst the conservatory was still quite sparse, Harry was planning on putting his board games and puzzles in there.
“It’s okay Draco.” Harry comforted. He pulled away slightly, so his eyes could meet the blond’s. “We can also talk to Hermione and Ron about it, I’m sure they wouldn’t get you in trouble. They could help.” Harry stroked his cheek absentmindedly with his thumb, and Draco snuggled into it.
“Well, you are, kind of. You haven’t done this before and you have been blushing a hell of a lot.” Harry commented, sniggering, finally meeting Draco’s eyes again.
Draco attempted to stop the spinning by grabbing the timepiece with his hand. A horrific sizzling sound erupted, Malfoy screeched and clutched his wound, accidentally dropping the glass in the process.
“The smoke just made you… Sleepy. This is all a dream I’d made you, you’re fine.” He explained, pulling the loose fabric off of his body, leaving his skin exposed for Harry’s eyes. A new rush of blood was sent down to Harry’s crotch at the long, lean, aristocratic lines of Malfoy’s torso. Harry felt his throat go dry. “And uncross your legs.”
Soon enough, Harry was washed, ready and refreshed. He reached into his closet to grab some clothes for the day before swiftly being interrupted by another owl at his window.
The words seemed to fly over Harry’s head, he still couldn’t bear to bring his eyes away from the photo, endlessly evaluating Malfoy’s sudden hotness. How did he not see that back at Hogwarts?
“I drugged him with the swooping evil venom. Made him forget everything. I took his potion book and left.”
His tongue continued to circle Harry’s opening, the wetness slowly depleting all the resistance from Harry’s hole as Draco’s finger slid in easily, only to pull back out and thrust in again.
He hadn’t given the undercoat enough time to dry either, so whilst it looked really nice for the first five minutes, after that all the colour mushed together, making what should be a vibrant garden turn to varying shades of brown.
Draco didn’t know what to do or say, Harry kept pumping in and out of the man, with such ferocity that Draco didn’t even notice the screaming moans from the blond with his face in the pillow, his hands tied up in ecstasy behind his neck. Draco was hypnotised by the ripple of the man’s arse with every thrust before he finally snapped out of his daze.
“Quickly! Pick those up!” Harry instructed, pushing himself up from the ground and scrabbling around to pick up as many loose ends as he could.
“Move.” Harry instructed, opening his eyes when Malfoy slowly began to pull out. The pain quickly ebbed away as Harry had adjusted to Malfoys dick, it was now replaced with nothing but a low thrum of pleasure.
“Of course not.” He lied, causing her to uncross her arms and fall back down onto the plump cushions of the sofa.
He thought he’d done the right thing by telling Harry he would sleep with him if they weren’t friends, but he was rapidly regretting that decision.
“I want whatever you’ll give me.” Harry whispered once again, at these words Malfoy stepped away from him and pointed to the staircase behind him.
“They couldn’t find enough proof.” Malfoy finally looked up to Harry’s eyes, only to quickly look away again. “I don’t want to be caught. They’d sent me to Azkaban. They’ve already let me off once.”
“You should go home. You shouldn’t be tiring yourself out like this, especially not so close to your due date.” Harry fretted. “Oh merlin, I shouldn’t have made you paint the whole house by yourself.”
Ron’s body came flying through the door, a draft of wind blowing into the room after him. He clutched a toothbrush in one hand and the Daily prophet in the other (not to mention the very appetising trail of white, frothy toothpaste that ran down his chin).
Harry sat still in an ashamed silence. Part of him wished he’d never pressed his wand to the glass ball. Albeit it was only a very small part of him, but it was still present nevertheless.
The hourglass began to glow golden, yellow, and red, sparks flickering off the glass as its rotations accelerated.
“It is, it’s very exciting. It’s a big step in my life, it’s just that, I’ve never really been alone before you know. It was always Hogwarts or with the Weasley’s or at Ron and Hermione’s - never just me. The closest I’ve ever been to being alone before was,” Harry looked around them before whispering out “The Dursley’s.”, a small, sympathetic frown painted Ginny’s face.
“I don’t know! But it’s not there.” Malfoy pulled on his hair again, his breath coming out in shallow grunts.
“Yes, I decided the basement was perfect.” Draco played along. They all walked down the hallway next to eachother, two of them pretending they hadn’t just thoroughly fucked eachothers brains out. Harry was quite impressed that Draco didn’t appear to even have a limp.
Just when Harry was about to give up and walk away, he saw that flash of platinum blond that he’d been waiting all night for.
Harry couldn’t take it any longer, Malfoy felt like a magnet pulling him in, a force so strong that he had no chance at holding himself back. So, he plunged himself forward and wrapped his arms around Draco’s shoulders and let his head fall into the blond’s shoulder.
“You’re right. Thank you.” Draco reached forward for one last embrace, pulling Harry tight. “Do you need any advice with your boyfriend?” Draco asked into Harry’s hair.
Harry leant his head back against the door with a plunk and let go of the breath he had been holding.
“Well, it’s certainly, different.” She commented, clearing her throat as a look of distaste crossed her face.
Malfoy liked when Harry bit his lip, so he tried it with Alex. He managed to get out a small grunt, Harry moved his tongue along in time. To the left, to the right, maybe a swirl.
The expression on Harry’s face looked desperate as he watched Draco, his eyebrows furrowed and mouth begging.
Malfoy met Harry’s eyes as he pulled the zipper down, the sound echoing around the room. The blond looked between Harry’s two feet that were tied to the posters of the bed before pulling out his wand and pointing it towards Harry. He mumbled a quiet spell and Harry’s trousers evaporated away from his body.
Draco chuckled at the question, every single time Harry came into the shop, he ordered exactly the same cake. He had never once deviated from the option (despite Draco’s begging to try something new) and always ordered a Treacle Tart with a side of cream, without fault. He was known for it by now.
Also was unsure on whether to add an epilogue, I decided not to add one to this fic but thought I might do I few one shots based off of this AU in the future like them with kids or stuff, just for nostalgia sake :)
“It’s just that… I’ve never..” Harry looks down Draco’s body and his stomach twists again at the sight of Draco’s freshly exposed rigid erection. “Been with a man.”
“Hello Mia, lovely to meet you.” Draco walked forward to her, took her hand and bent down to kiss the back of her knuckle. “It’s Draco.”
“This is huge Draco.” Harry slipped the butt plug back in, relishing in the way Malfoy’s legs gripped onto him tighter.
Then he saw Malfoy again, but this time his whole body had slipped through the crowd. Malfoy moved with grace and practice as he rolled his body to the beat of the music. Harry was practically hypnotised by Malfoy’s skilful movements. The rolling of his hips, his head occasionally tipping back and his plump lips mouthing along to the words of the songs.
“How wholesome.” Cole began. “Anyways, I feel bad for making Maddie cover for me for so long, so I’m gonna head back to work, but you two can still talk.” Cole explained, picking up his empty cup and plate. “Bye guys.” Cole turned around, shooting them both a smile before walking away.
“We can talk about it now.” Malfoy offered, taking a step closer to Harry. Harry took a step back, cornering himself against the wall.
“Bedroom.” Harry murmured, pulling away from Draco long enough to let his jeans drop to the floor with a soft thud. Draco nodded his head in agreement with a soft whine.
He thought back and couldn’t remember seeing it in the Prophet (even though he didn’t read it) and he didn’t even know Malfoy had had a wife.
“No, what do you want me to do?” Harry felt his throat choke up, it was hard to think with Malfoy’s hand running over Harry’s cock like that.
He straddled one leg over the man’s torso, making Draco’s eyes suddenly shoot wide, Harry quickly realised his miscalculation and shakily shuffled back, away from Malfoy’s face, only to realised he was now sat on the man’s crotch.
“No, I like truth or dare.” Malfoy began. “How about we play both, some truth or dare, then swap to spin the bottle.” Everyone in the group looked around at each other, all in subtle agreement. Apart from Harry, of course. He needed to stay as far away from Malfoy as physically possible - not end up kissing him and then being completely unable to get the ferret out of his mind.
He felt on the verge of tears. But he also felt something else building up inside of him. Specifically building up in his crotch area.
Harry wanted to show that he wasn’t thinking about Malfoy so much that he didn’t even notice that the blond guy had come walking up to the table and was now stood next to him.
It was jutting out against his pyjama bottoms like a sore needle, leaving a large tent where it stood. Now that he looked closer, he could see that the tip of his cock was slowly leaking a small amount of precum onto the front of his bottoms, leaving a wet patch in its place. He rubbed his eyes, trying not to remember what he had just walked in on.
They had made a pitstop by Draco’s house to pick up some boxes, three of which were lying on the kitchen countertop.
“Yeah I’m, fuck, I’m better than fine don’t worry. You’re just quite big is all.” Draco shuffled his hips down.
Malfoy seemed to turn back on and caught up with Harry across the road, where he took them into his flat block and within five minutes, Harry was unlocking the door.
“No idea.” Harry was red as well now, rubbing his head with the same movements as Draco. “I’ll go check.” Harry walked away from Draco to the front of their apartment.
Also, it's mad how much the world has changed since I started this fic and now that we are all stuck inside in quarantine, I hope you are all doing okay.
Whilst Harry had led him on, he hadn’t broken his heart or anything, he’d hardly even shown much romantic interest and Cole appeared to be a good person. Whilst the idea of romance was doomed from the start, perhaps a good friendship would suit the two. After all, Harry could use more friends than just Ron and Hermione.
The tender gave Harry his drink and Harry paid him the correct amount of change before turning back towards the club. He spotted a bench -like the one he’d sat at with Ginny- in the corner, so he made his way over to it.
“I said, if you’re offering, I wouldn’t complain.” Malfoy repeated, keeping his face unreadable besides his perpetual, mischievous smirk.
“That was a bit tame Draco.” Catherine whined. “You normally do better than that.” Harry’s mind was suddenly ambushed with images of Malfoy kissing random men. He almost had to slap himself to make the thoughts stop.
Harry’s stubble was scraping across Draco’s face, his breath coming in short, rapid bursts. His hands were all over Draco, pushing him against the wall, running along his shoulder and down to his hips, pinching at his sides, and the best part of it was how Draco willingly accepted the touches. Even arching into a few of them.
So, had a bit of a nightmare this week as my laptop broke and had to go to PC world arghh. Just got it back about an hour ago and luckily they didnt wipe the hard drive so we still have the next few chapters. Had a bit of a panic I would have to rewrite this but, we got there so it's all good, :).
Not a moment later Molly swept into the room levitating a feast for breakfast behind her and set the plates around the table. “Dig in everyone!” she beamed at them and then set off, presumably to wake the rest of her family.
“It’s very rude to bump into someone and not say you are sorry,” Draco said, trying his best to sound as old as he could.
Harry gasped and quickly gathered up his belongings and ran down to the dungeons. He slowly opened the door to the potions classroom and made his way over to the bench Draco had claimed for them. They were supposed to have worked on this in class today, but Harry had to miss because he wasn’t feeling well. Draco had reassured him that Snape would let them finish it after hours. Perks of the professor being your godfather, Harry thought.
They were quite for a while, Draco slowly adding wood to the fire when needed. But Ron eventually broke the silence.
Harry grinned and ran into the shop. He took his time looking at all the new brooms that were coming out this month. In his excitement to get into the shop he bumped into another boy around the same age as him with really blonde hair. He muttered an apology and made his way into the shop.
“I better get going.” Harry prompted, eating the last bit of his sandwich. It was already 8:15 and he wanted to walk there, it was only about ten minutes away after all.
He had a very attractive man stood in front of him, watching from only a hairs width away as Harry judged the bathroom décor instead of him.
“Okay, I’ll go grab my folder.” Harry strolled into the living room to pick up the file before walking right back to the kitchen. “Here ya’ go.” He said, chucking the folder onto the table.
“Wait, what did you say?” Pansy shouted into the circle. This time Harry let his eyes watch Malfoy, who was sat with an arrogant smirk on his lips.
Harry pulled up blank, realising he had literally paid no attention whatsoever to anything she had just said.
“Draco, please!” Harry pleaded. “I need more!” Harry ground down on Draco’s fingers with all of his energy. Screaming out a loud moan when his insides stalled as Draco hit his prostate, curling his fingers to stimulate him again.
“Get on the bed.” Harry commanded, waiting a second while Draco moved to sit down on the soft bed sheets. Harry watched from his standing position, the jut of his dick almost threatening from Draco’s new angle. “Lie down.”
“How very fitting.” He pushed the door open in front of him, “Well, I hope to meet you again sometime, Harry. But first, I need to fix things”
“I guess I’ll just let you cook then.” Harry had this stupid smirk on his deep pink lips, a stupid lopsided tug of his mouth. It made Draco’s legs quiver.
Then there was the third kissing attempt, which was when Draco had decided to drop by Harry’s work. Sometimes (if Draco was feeling particularly giving), Draco would run around to the Auror department at Lunch time to drop of some extra little snacks for Harry. When he’d come into Harry’s office, they somehow ended up in the position of Harry pressing him up against the door and just like last time, he managed to get his lips to only a centimetre away before Ron Weasley opened the door with a cup of tea and what must’ve been twenty biscuits.
Harry heart sunk with an inkling of sympathy. Whilst Malfoy was a prat, since the war, he had always had a soft spot for Narcissa.
The best shirt he could find for the situation was a baggy, red shirt. Harry chuckled at the Gryffindor red colour. Malfoy would definitely be disgusted.
He moved into the hallway and shuffled on a nicer pair of trainers, or should he go for the sneakers, maybe the ankle boots? No, of course not. Harry wasn’t really an ankle boot guy, he’d tried to kid himself for a while that he was, but he was just never cool enough for them. He tightened the laces of his shoes a bit too tight, his fingers quietly shaking.
“Boring!” Catherine shouted out from behind him. “I prefer spin the bottle.” She corrected, shooting a wink in Harry’s direction.
Harry snatched his paint brush and dipped it into the paint, collecting a large pool of it on the bristles. He strolled over closer to the canvas and raised his brush high. The bristles so oversaturated with paint that some of the red dripped down onto the floor.
“In all honestly, Harry, I don’t want anyone else to be his partner. We both know that Draco can be a bit volatile, to say the least, but you’re the best Auror in our team. I wouldn’t trust him with anyone else. I want him to be in safe hands.” Kingsley reasoned, trying to pull compliance from Harry, but Harry wasn’t having any of it.
Malfoy pushed his head back slightly into the other man’s neck, revealing the pale skin of his own neck, layered with a sheen of sweat. Harry’s eyes travelled down to Malfoy’s chest where a few of the buttons on his T-shirt were undone to reveal the top of his collarbones. Harry’s tongue shot out to lick his suddenly dry lips.
“It was… good… like, really good.” Harry complimented, moving his seat in an attempt to shuffle his growing erection out of sight.
Their conversation was interrupted by almost obnoxiously loud Christmas music blasting through from the Livingroom.
Harry felt something warm settle in his tummy as he watched Draco, it felt like a small pebble pushing down against him, attempting to move his insides out of his body. But it was warm at the same time, it felt comforting and was a welcomed feeling for Harry. It made him feel content, like nothing bad could ever happen.
That’s when Draco smelt a wave of bad breath hit his nostrils. He scrunched his nose up in distaste. Harry must’ve gotten rid of this guy before having him over for the night, otherwise Draco would definitely have remembered him.
“Quite a few people have offered me a substantial number of galleons for the land alone - but they all wanted to demolish the home and start from scratch. I understand that this place is a bit of a wreck, but it was my Grandfather’s and I have too many memories of when it was beautiful to let someone just demolish it.” Harry nodded along in understanding.
“Nice to meet you.” Lily beamed. “Hopefully, I’ll stumble into you two some other time. Have a good night!” She left, turning into the door of the Leaky, James following swiftly behind.
The two walked towards the diner, the cold of night not affecting their rose blossomed cheeks. Harry felt just as warm as ever.
“What are you doing today?” Draco asked, pulling the trousers up his legs.  Was he not going to wear underwear?
“What will you two boys be having?” A waitress asked, she had light brown hair and a heavy New York accent.
Harry shivered at the idea of having to live through the wizarding war again. He would rather just keel over on the spot.
“Sorry, I thought you were in trouble. I didn’t mean to interrupt anything.” Malfoy moved his hands back down to his sides.
“You’re not getting anything else until you use it, so tough luck.” Malfoy replied, plonking down on the bottom of the staircase and turning around to face Harry only a hair’s width away, causing Harry to drop the sphere in shock.
Draco cried out. And when Harry does it again, Draco muffles a string of wordless sounds from his throat, pressing his moaning mouth against his own arm.
Harry span himself in a circle to face Malfoy again, this time however, instead of watching Harry, Malfoy was glaring at Cole. But within a second, his sight was back on Harry’s now shirtless body.
Suddenly, the idea of walking to the kitchen seemed like a great distraction from his thoughts. He needed to stop thinking about Harry. A nice, tall cup of water would be the perfect thing for the glass shards in his throat.
“What?” The owl calmly lifted it’s leg up and towards Harry. Harry glared at the blasted thing whilst he untied the note from its leg.
“I like it here. I like being on my own, no one recognising me, being able to work for my money. It’s a fresh start. I’ve never been happier.” Draco’s face furrowed.
The three of them sat around the end of the dining table as Dobby brought them a stack of cakes and pastries, along with freshly boiled tea. Narcissa and Draco spoke for about an hour before they had decided that the time to end the day had come.
With this image, Harry could now arch his back against the man and lean forward, showing his back off to him. Harry didn’t even protest when Draco’s hand found it’s way to palm Harry’s hardening dick.
Without warning, Draco’s hands slid around to the small of Harry’s back, setting off the steady building fire in Harry’s stomach. Harry chucked himself up from the arm rest and onto Draco, breaking their kiss to straddle his legs, sitting his crotch against Draco’s lap.
Wait…Were Harry’s eyes wet? His vision was getting blurry, and that only meant one thing. He felt like an idiot. What had his life come to? Standing in front of Malfoy crying.
“Well I’ve got – “ Cole looked down to his watch “ thirty minutes.” He grinned, daring Harry with wide brown eyes.
“A Malfoy in glasses, I would’ve thought that would’ve gone against some old, pure-blood family rule.” Malfoy’s eyebrows furrowed.
At that, Malfoy let out a puff of air, using his left hand to stroke his own arm in a comforting gesture.
Harry undid the lid and chucked the potion back. He remembered last time he’d used Polyjuice back in eight year, and it was just as potent as he remembered. The taste was vile, making him gag as soon as he swallowed, but he was determined not to chuck it back up. And whilst the nausea was short, in hit him like a sucker punch straight to the belly, making him double over for a second.
Harry lowered the frying pan onto the stove, turning the heat up just a bit too low for making a fried egg.
Feel free to comment, I like reading them, they're good motivators. Also if you've got any questions, I'll happily explain them :) xx
Draco gasped, his lips parting in shock, his heart rate skyrocketed, and he was sure Harry could feel it this close to him. He’d forgotten how to speak.
Harry let his eyes flutter shut once again as he adjusted to the fire inside him. It wasn’t as painful as he thought it’d be, and the pain wasn’t unbearable, especially as a twinge of pleasure began to twinkle in.
I'm trying to think of another AU to write, I don't know what length I want to write but I imagine any new fics I write will be on the shorter side. :)
“You’re perfect.” Draco mumbled, unable to break his eyes away from Harry’s. “I love y-” Draco choked up, breaking off his sentence with a whimper and now Harry could see small tears forming in their ducts. “I love how this feels.”
Ron and Hermione had decided to go on a date for a change, as both of them had a rare night off work. But that meant that Harry was left at home alone with his mind, which kept straying back to the one person he had been trying to ignore all week. Bloody Malfoy.
Suddenly rays of light shot through the room as a large glass window was exposed, somehow there was not even a single smudge on the glass.
She lobbed another vase in Harry’s direction, but he swiftly dodged it, the	 crash reverberating from the wall behind him.
“I thought you looked really focused so… I kept us open for an extra half an hour.” He explained, avoiding Harry’s eyes.
The pink fluorescent lights gleamed in his face- an overwhelming sense of déjà vu overcoming him. Slowly, he took a few steps closer to the club, luckily there was no queue to get in, only a bouncer who gave no more question than a side glance to Harry’s entrance when he wandered through.
“Of course, it’ll give me something to do. I don’t really want to have to work, I have enough money anyways. This could be my little project.” Hermione stared at the other sketches.
“He just is.” Harry replied. “I’ve always pictured him hiding in some secret resort in France, but I definitely never thought he would’ve been a… ya'know… a rent boy.”, Harry felt a blush raise to his cheeks at the words.
It's been a long time, but I think I am finally back on this story. Should I keep going through the years, or do a chapter that skims though the rest of his time in school, then jump into the last year? Let me know your thoughts!
Then suddenly, Draco was being pulled away, a strong hand on the back of his collar yanking him backwards, causing him to almost tumble to the ground.
Draco rolled his eyes and together they made their way to the train, parting ways to sit with their respective friend groups. Harry waved goodbye to Draco who didn’t wave back. Harry’s friends didn’t seem to like Draco, Harry had no idea why, but it didn’t seem to bother Draco.
Harry bit his lip. “I didn’t really know any better,” he sighed. “That was until I came out to Ron one summer while staying at his place. I was so scared that he was going to kick me out, but I was so sick of keeping it from everyone. He was obviously fine with it, and seeing how nervous I was, he explained how wizarding kind views it.”
Draco forced his face into a neutral expression and looked back at Harry. “Nothing is wrong,” he said, forcing a smile.
Draco bent down to help, but Ron shook his head. “Wake Harry,” Ron said, motioning to Harry who was asleep on the ground. “It’s about time that he get up.”
Harry exclaimed, looking up to find the Weasley twins who had sat themselves down in the empty space across from Harry.
“I just thought we could have some tea,” Draco said, trying to keep his voice even and polite like his father had taught him.
That was when Snape decided that he had had enough of their class and dismissed them. Harry could have hugged the grumpy professor. He shoved his belongings into his bag and rushed out of class, keeping his head down.
Harry smiled and stopped his broom so he was hovering. He held his left hand palm up, fingers together, and swiped his right hand in the letter S across his palm. “Severus Snape. It’s the sign slip made with an S.”
The boy made a confused look and then began moving his hands while he said, “I am sorry for bumping into you earlier.” The boy’s voice was so quiet Draco had to strain to hear it, but at least he had finally apologized.
On the other hand, maybe he was being ridiculous. Potter was obviously just doing the kind thing and healing him. In Potter’s mind, he probably thought he was saving Draco from embarrassment.
“No way. I know better,” Harry smirked back. “But you should prove it to me. I don’t take your word for it.”
Slowly, he lowered his hands and looked up at Harry. Draco thought he had cast a silencing spell on them, but couldn’t see a wand in Harry’s hands.
He tugged his sleeve up to reveal the Dark Mark that was now writhing on his skin. The pulling sensation that he knew if he gave into would bring him to Voldimort.
Harry jolted awake, but relaxed when he saw Draco smiling down at him. “Good morning love, how did you sleep?” Harry said sitting up.
He sighed and pulled the curtains closed around his bed. This was getting ridiculous. Sleep should be something that everyone could attain, yet it evaded him.
After what felt like hours Harry stopped jumping, breathing heavily, and leaned back against the speaker. Draco could see the pounding base shake Harry’s small frame. He reached out to pull him away from it, but Harry simply closed his eyes and smiled to himself, swaying his head to the music.
Severus reached out and lifted Remus’ chin up. “Have you felt like yourself for the turns that you have taken the Wolfsbane?”
Harry smiled shyly. He knew that his parents, and most of their friends were Gryffindor’s, but he personally thought his house was a lot cooler.
Draco nodded and kneeled down next to Harry and ran his fingers through his dark hair gently. “Harry…it’s time for you to wake up.”
Draco didn’t have the heart to care about the venom in her voice. Everything was too close, to small. He pushed out of Harry’s arms and fled from the tent, falling to his knees after only a few steps.
Harry found a compartment all to himself on the train. He really didn’t want to interact with people, he has never really been a people person, and making friends was never his strong suit. To his surprise the blonde boy from Diagon ally, Draco, opened the door to the compartment slowly.
Harry clutched his broom tight to his chest. Tryouts were only an hour away, and he had just found out that the twins weren’t allowed there to interpret for him. The captain had said that it was because they were Gryffindors, but Harry had a suspicion that the captain just didn’t like them. That was no reason to put Harry at a disadvantage though.
Catching Harry’s confused look Draco whispered. “I’d rather not walk past Severus’ and Lupin’s room this late.”
Harry nodded and looked down at his plate. He realized that that was probably the first time anyone had touched him sense he had come to Hogwarts. Harry’s theory was that the other students were afraid that they would catch his deafness. Which was a stupid idea, but Harry had known kids to be far stupider at times. He liked Fred and George, but he didn’t want to tell them that. It just made him sound pathetic.
“Uhh…I…” Harry didn’t want to point out Malfoy’s slip. He really wasn’t in the mood to fight. And, to be honest, Malfoy himself was quite distracting. He was backlit by the dim light pouring through the opening in the tower, making his pale skin and hair glow. He looked positively ethereal.
Snape cracked a small smile and hugged Draco back, his hands rubbing Draco’s back. “Hello little dragon,” Snape said quietly.
Potter probably just wanted to save another helpless soul. There could be no way that he acted out of romantic feelings. Potter couldn’t be gay.
I laughed lightly. “Not that I can remember. We are going to be late for class.” I wasn’t used to people talking to me, and it felt abrasive and false. I just wanted to go to class where I knew what to focus on, and I knew that I could excel.
Draco didn’t see Potter again until Wednesday. He was walking to the dungeons to work on some potions, and Potter was walking in the opposite direction and he looked pissed. Draco could feel the air crackling around him, even before he got within ear shot.
Draco gritted his teeth and dragged his nails over the black trying to pull it off his skin, but no matter how hard he dug, the thing wouldn’t budge.
I was on my way to charms class on Friday, which was going well this year, and as I passed a group of Gryffindor third years one reached out and shoved me hard in the back. Naturally, I was unable to catch myself and was sent sprawling on the ground. I turned around to glare at the group, and was met with laughter.
Severus arched an eyebrow. “Would you rather I switch your rooms? I’m sure Weasley would love to have you for a roommate over Harry.”
“I do admit the captains have been quite tight lipped when it comes to the boy’s talents,” Severus shrugged. “And they are reluctant to say why they bother to have him on the team.”
Remus sat back down and rested his head against the table. Snape sat next to Draco, across the table from Harry.
“I shouldn’t have. Now they know where you are. No one is supposed to be able to ap-,” now it was Draco’s turn to look confused. “How did you get here.”
Harry felt his cheeks burn as he turned to watch Malfoy leave. He had no idea what the blonde had said, but hearing the emotion behind his French was enticing, and he really didn’t care if he had just been insulted. He had a weird feeling in his stomach that he couldn’t quite place.
Draco woke up the next morning by a kick to his shin. He was up with his wand drawn before he could register where he was.
Draco looked up to find Harry holding out the handle of his broom where a piece of paper was secured. It had the same writing on it that the pad did.
Why wasn’t he standing up for himself? It was an honest question and he obviously meant no malice behind it. Harry was genuinely confused by it all.
Draco shuddered with relief, but removed the strong arms from around his body. “You can’t be here. I don’t think I made it out of the grounds.”
“Why?” Confusion contorting Draco’s face. “It’s no different from a man and a woman holding hands. Or even two women for that matter.”
she demonstrated with her own wand, exaggerating the movements like Harry had seen her do for Ron in class.
“There you go,” Draco said, his voice impassive. “And just for the record, you are very hot, love.” Then Draco turned back to the patch he was putting in the tent.
Draco groaned and pressed his hands into the small of Harry’s back, pulling him as close as their cloths would allow. “Don’t test me, Gryffindor,” Draco said, pressing gentle kisses to Harry’s neck. “I bite.”
To his surprise the boy didn’t react and simply walked over to the next broom. Maybe he was just so wrapped up in the shiny new brooms, so Draco decided to try again.
Draco had just fallen asleep when his arm began to burn. He removed himself from Harry’s grip slowly without waking the Gryffindor, and ran out of the tent into the snow.
“What are you two doing!” Ron gestured to Snape. “He’s a death eater! He’s probably come to find out where we are and report back to Voldemort.”
Draco was excited to start his second year at Hogwarts. He had done really well in his classes last year, even though he came in second in their year to that Granger kid. He had nice friends, and he enjoyed watching the Quidditch matches, which he rationalized had more to do with the fact that they were fast paced and dangerous, and nothing to do with the fact that Harry was usually the focal point of them.
“And is it just these headaches that keep you from classes?” Snape asked, picking up his quill and jotting something down on the papers.
That got Harry’s attention and he glanced over at Draco to see one of his friends nudge his shoulder and motion over towards them.
Another couple of weeks had passed without much of anything going wrong. The four of them were falling into an easy rhythm, each becoming more familiar with the others way of doing things, and what got on each other’s nerves.
Classes were not back in full swing after the break, which saw Harry, Ron, and Hermione all studying together in the library.
Harry had also opted to keep his long sleeve on, and Draco knew he was doing it to be supportive. But Harry was clearly sweating. In fact, he was sweating so much so that Ron had commented on it twice now.
“He’s not a fan of owls,” Draco said with a small smile. “He once told me that he was trying to mail a letter when he was younger and the owl tried to bite him every time he tried to tie the letter to its leg. I guess he avoids them whenever possible, or gets someone else to deal with the owl. So naturally, I try to owl him as often as possible.”
Harry cleared his throat, and Malfoy spun to face him, becoming tense. “Que faites-vous hors du lit?” Malfoy snapped, crossing his arms across his chest. He didn’t seem to notice that he had spoken in French.
Draco leaned forward on his broom, urging it faster to match Harry’s speed, waving when he got next to him.
Draco watched Harry’s eyes go big. He had been practicing his sign language ever sense he found out that Harry was deaf. He liked the boy for whatever reason and wanted him to have someone that he could communicate with.
Draco resisted the urge to hide his face again, and simply watched his godfather trace the mark with careful hands.
Harry didn’t know what was weirder, the fact that they were signing to him, that they knew his name, or that they could sign in unison.
“He told us that you two were dating, so the fact that he ran to you wasn’t a total surprise,” Ron cocked his head to the side. “What was a surprise is that last we heard you were at home.”
Harry looked Draco over. He had, indeed, dressed in muggle cloths, a dark purple jumper and dark wash jeans, that spawned sinful thoughts in Harry’s imagination. When he tore his eyes away from Draco’s body, his words finally sunk in. “You want to go to muggle London…willingly?” Harry asked, not believing the Slytherin.
“Of course,” Draco squeezed Harry’s hand gently, and together they made their way down to the river, expanding the wards as they went.
“I’m so sorry,” Draco stuttered out. He tried to rise, but another bold of pain caused him to fall forward into Harry.
Draco tried to keep his gaze away from the professors, but had nothing to fear because Harry’s hand shot up.
Draco nodded, and Severus slipped the tin into Draco’s pocket. “Will I get to see you again?” Draco asked shyly.
“Me too!” Draco grinned, then he heard his father calling his name. “My father is calling me. I will see you on the train then?”
“So you guys have just been searching for parts of Voldimort’s soul?” Draco asked. Harry and he were on a slow walk around the perimeter of the small camp. Harry wanted to check the wards again, and Draco wanted to be with Harry.
The man was yelling now, shouting colorful insults at the pair. Just as Draco drew his wand, Harry stepped around him and punched the man squarely in the face.
Lilly asked as she walked away from the Weasley’s house with Harry. Harry was sad that his dad couldn’t come to pick him up too, but his mom told him that he had to work, which was okay. Harry knew that his dad liked his job, and he would see him tonight.
, Harry couldn’t imagine living in a house with that many people. He sometimes thought his house was too full and it was just his parents and him.
Harry watched as Remus paled and started to get up, but before Harry could say anything Snape spelled the scent of food out of the room.
“I will leave you to wake your…Harry,” Severus said with a smirk. “I expect you both down for breakfast in ten.”
“We were in the middle of cooking dinner and suddenly Harry said he had to go and just apparated through the wards we had put up,” Ron said fixing Draco with a steady gaze. “Then he comes back with you.”
They had been hopping from place to place for the past week, and today marked the fourth day sense they had no sign of the Death Eaters. The group felt comfortable believing that they were finally rid of them for now.
“If you are implying that I called Harry to me so that he could be captured,” Draco said cooly. “I suggest you ask directly.”
Harry was being hoisted onto the shoulders of the beaters when Draco pushed his way through the crowed towards him.
“You just had A bad week,” Lucius let out a long sigh. “Honestly, Draco. It’s as though you aren’t even trying.”
“Are you going to Hogwarts this year?” Draco said, and this time both he and Harry watched Lilly translate.
Harry asked, hating the awkward silence between them. He liked Fred, George, and Ron, and he wanted the rest of their family to like him too.
Harry, Ron and Hermione were currently sitting around the fire cooking lunch a little ways from the tent. Harry wanted to get Draco to come out, but he thought better of it, opting to give the Slytherin some time to work out his feelings.
Ron and the twins waved back. When their parents saw them waving, they turned and waved as well. Hermione was caught up in helping her parents with her luggage.
Draco relaxed upon hearing this. He had feared that his godfather had been forced to interact with Voldemort while he had been stuck with the Gryffindor’s. Hearing that he no longer had to play the part as a double agent was comforting, though he knew that he would always worry about Severus’ safety.
Harry climbed onto his bed and the curtains closed themselves around him. He sat against the headboard and hugged his knees to his chest.
“I’m fine,” Draco said, taking Harry’s hands in his own. “You hit him?” Draco knew Harry was capable of violence, had seem it with his own eyes, but to see him hit someone for no reason…it confused him.
, Harry interrupted. He thought they seemed nice, but he didn’t want to be late for class because he was getting information he already knew.
They told us we were going to be sorted by this at and then put in houses. Okay, that fits in with this weird magic that I have witnessed this far. So, for now, we stood on the stairs waiting to be ushered into the hall. I stood next to my new friend, Ron, I reminded myself. He was nice, and he liked candy even more than me, if that was possible.
Draco looked at the flames that were stretching towards the canopy above. “Subtle, Potter,” Draco said, but pressed himself ever closer to Harry’s chest.
Harry’s words forced themselves through Draco’s fear, and he believed him. Between those green eyes, and the fact that Harry wasn’t scared of him, Draco couldn’t help himself. He pulled Harry close and kissed his lips deeply.
Harry looked across the table to find a boy his age with the same flaming red hair that the twins had. He, Ron, also had the same dark freckles, making him unmistakably their brother.
When Potter was healing him it made him feel so warm, and safe, that he had even had the audacity to close his eyes. Draco blushed, he had had romantic thoughts about Potter for a while now, but he never thought anything would come from it.
Now this boy was waving his hands in Draco’s face. Who does he think he is?! Again, Draco huffed, but he looked at the boy anyway. “You are being very rude!”
This time he tapped the boy on the shoulder. “You are being very rude to me. I did nothing to deserve it.”
Harry smiled and reached out, rubbing his hand lightly over the writing on the pad. Draco watched the writing fade and nodded.
It wasn’t long before the house made its way back to the common room to continue the celebration there. Draco stayed towards the edges of the crowd with Theodore.
“Potter, I only have your best interests in mind,” Snape paused for a moment. “We can’t have you missing classes. You are a Slytherin.”
“Yes, in a minute,” Draco said, tugging at the ends of his jumper. He wanted nothing more than to strip and join Harry, but if he did that then he would have to explain the healing cuts along his mark. That was a conversation he didn’t want to have now, or ever if he could get away with it.
Turns out Harry had a chance after all. No wonder the boy had been so excited about try outs. Draco now thought that he was a shoe in for seeker. The captains would be idiots to not pick a first year that could fly as well as Harry could.
Sighing Harry looked up to find two Gryffindor boys grinning down at him. They had whiled red hair, and were covered in freckles. But what was the most striking was they looked to be exact copies of each other. Twins.
I was jolted away by ear piercing screams. Throwing back the curtains I stumbled out of bed, nearly face planting when my foot got caught in my sheets.
After a little while of sitting in silence, Harry got up, and when Snape just continued to write, Harry shrugged and left with Fred.
Malfoy took a moment to share a light laugh with the other Slytherin’s before turning back to Harry and Ron. “I’d be careful how big you boast, Potter.”
Draco, however, fixed Hermione with the best glare he could muster this early in the morning. He was sure Hermione knew exactly what she was interrupting, even if Harry was oblivious to it.
When Draco finally tapped his side gently, Harry took a deep breath and made his way up to the stool. When he sat down and the hat was placed on his head, he kept his eyes fixed on Draco.
When Draco’s hand fell back to his side, Severus rolled down his sleeve again and pulled a small tin out of a pocket in his robes. “Put this salve on after, it will help with the redness and healing.”
When he came around the corner in a trail he spotted Draco and his father. They appeared to be engaged in a heated conversation a little way down the trail. Harry, overcome by curiosity, hid himself in the thick of the trees, and made his way toward the Malfoy’s so that he could better hear their conversation. When he was close enough he peaked around one of the larger trees so that he could better observe the interaction.
“I thought we could go out tonight,” Draco whispered, flashing Harry what he thought was his best smile.
Harry hadn’t been back since his godfathers’ death, but he wanted to see the others. Make sure that they truly were alright. When they apparated onto the front steps, his hand shot out to hold Draco’s.
They were sat across from each other at the library one night when Harry contemplated ending their agreement. He had tried everything Hermione was asking of him, but he still couldn’t get the charm down. He was trying to levitate a feather, and Hermione made it looks as easy as breathing, but because Harry couldn’t say the spell it was harder. The fact that she had picked up ASL in less than a week didn’t make him feel any better. He was glad that he was now able to talk freely with Hermione, but he was starting to wonder if there was anything the girl wasn’t good at.
He had a mad smile on his face, and it made Harry breathless for a second, a single strand of blond hair falling in front of gleeful eyes.
Harry closed his eyes. Maybe if he just pretended it wasn’t Alex, he could do this. He imagined the hands as not being there, Alex’s groin instead being the plump mattress of Harry’s bed.
“Right, yes..  uhm, it was urrrrrrrr good, I guess, if you like that sort of thing, I mean... How much do you know about the vision?”
“Do you have a bed?” Harry asked, trying to ignore the heartbeat that was pumping in his dick. “It would be more comfortable.”
Harry slowly rocks his hips into Draco during his orgasm, and relishes the feeling of Malfoy convulsing against his post-orgasm cock.
“Oh, of course. I forgot to tell you.” Harry suddenly felt an anxious heat prickling up his neck. “I’ve decided to take up art.” Harry explained, he felt extremely vulnerable, his cheeks turning red.
Perhaps Harry was getting ahead of himself, but the thought of a domestic life with Malfoy didn’t seem nearly a terrible as Harry would’ve thought. Instead it sounded quite…
Harry and Damien both had cornflakes with milk – a fairly bog-standard breakfast. But when Draco looked down into his bowl, he saw that Harry had made him a bowl of creamy oats, with yoghurt, berries, honey and nuts to top it off.
I might decide to write a few more fics in future but I don't think I'll be doing another long one (probably no more over 40,000 words).
“My only enemy was Voldemort. You were just a mild inconvenience.” Harry waved his hand. Malfoy smiled for a second before looking back down to the table.
He swiftly undid his zipper and chucked his hand into his underwear. After only two strokes of his cock, he came all over himself in white spurts, unable to control himself from screaming out a moan.
Harry covered his ears as the cork flew out of the bottle, bashing up into the ceiling before colliding with the floor.
Harry reached his hand forward to turn on the kettle, before being swiftly interrupted by Ginny placing her hand on his.
“In your hand. The one currently being suffocated and leaking on the floor.” Harry looked down to see butter dripping from the croissant, his fingers leaving deep indents on the side.
He thought back to three days ago when he saw Draco in the toilets. He’d looked tired and sad, like all of his hope had disappeared, all because of Harry. A bubble of guilt welled up in his chest. Sure, Harry was right to have gotten upset, but it hurt him to think of Draco like that.
The he comes back up. Inch by inch. Draco continues, the pressure of his heavy tongue under Harry’s cock making his eyes roll back and tremble all over. And everytime he rises back up again, he’s sucking, working Harry’s prick in his mouth, driving him insane.
Malfoy’s eyes swam with sympathy and sincerity, a look that Harry had not often seen in the Slytherin’s eyes.
“This should calm you down.” Alex began unbuckling Harry’s belt from his hips, tugging the fabric looser.
Next up was Ginny’s gift, which was a carefully bound, leather journal. On the front, in small, golden writing was engraved ‘Property of Draco Malfoy’.
“Well that was-“ Harry began, rolling over to face Malfoy, but he immediately fell quiet when he saw the man’s closed eyes and shallow breaths.
Draco’s breath washed out of him when he saw what he’d just walked in on. Harry was in the centre of his bed, with a lean, blond man laid in front of him. The blond was in child’s pose, his head pressed down into the sheets and bum pushed up into the air. But what really made Draco’s mouth dry was Harry.
“Why does this always happen to me.” He whispered, swallowing his pride, and turning on the shower, putting the heat as low as it could possibly go. He refused to wank with Malfoy in the next room. So, his only other option was to will his erection away with icy cold water.
Harry suddenly remembered why he used to love Ginny. Well, perhaps it was more of a sisterly love than one that brimmed with romance, but still, his heart ached slightly at seeing her again.
How would he even face Harry today? Surely, he wouldn’t even be able to meet his eyes. That was it settled then; he was not leaving his bedroom until Harry had left for work.
“To hell with the rules Draco. I killed Voldemort, I don’t think some whores doovers are going to stop me.”
“I thought I hated you. I thought I was jealous of you. But I soon realised that I just really wanted to be friends with you.”
Those article photos gave Malfoy absolutely no justice whatsoever. In real life, his facial structure was just a little more prominent, his hair a little more blond and his body a little more muscular. Harry could hardly stop himself from letting his eyes run up and down Malfoy.
“Coming!” Harry shouted back, grabbing his jacket and chucking it on whilst moving out of his room and down to the second floor, where the floo was located.
Harry pulled all the way out to his tip before slamming back in again, the sound of skin slapping against skin reverberating around the room like a gun shot. Malfoy’s stream of moans never ended, his hands lifting higher to push against the headboard of Harry’s bed, a poor attempt to stop his body flying at Harry’s thrusts.
of research. Like a lot.” Malfoy began, his eyes shifting along the room and his body language exaggerated. “There were
Malfoy pulled away from Harry’s mouth and began kissing along his jaw, starting at the dip next to Harry’s mouth and continuing along his jawline until he latched on to one spot below Harry’s ear. Harry groaned at the sensation of Malfoys tongue swirling around his skin. Malfoy lifted his mouth to Harry’s ear.
Harry passed over the white bandage wrap and watched as Malfoy wrapped his hand up. Now that Harry thought about it, Malfoy had taken the news of being blasted back in time very well, he was composed and rational, Harry was insistent that he was just dreaming or that the whole world was playing some sick prank on him for the first three months he was stuck.
Therefore as an apology, I'll give you an extra long chapter that I was originally going to chop up into two.
Daphne strolled over and wrapped her arm around Theodore’s neck. “Come dance with me!” she said over the music which had evidently been turned up with the lights went off.
I wonder what’s wrong with him, Harry thought. Usually Malfoy would at least look up and fix him with that annoying sneer he was known for. Malfoy, however, kept his head down leaving Harry’s eyes free to wander over his features. Maturity had done Malfoy well, and his cheek bones were well defined and his hare fell gracefully over his forehead, no longer gelled into submission but still styled. His figure was still lithe, but he had grown and his cloths hinted at a well-muscled frame, probably from Quidditch, Harry concluded. He looks so sad, Malfoy had dark circles under his eyes, and would yawn every now and then. It was nothing compared to the previous years, where Malfoy was excited as anyone to be back in school, no matter how hard he tried to hide the excitement.
Harry gasped and tilted his head, giving Draco more room. “Oh, I’m counting on in,” Harry said, and slid his hand up to Draco’s jaw, to guide the blonde’s lips to his own.
Harry nodded and reached into his bag pulling out the edge of his uniform so Ron could see. Harry saw his mouth open in a gasp and smirked, tucking the fabric back into his bag.
Harry pulled him through the crowed until they were standing next to the big muggle speakers someone had brought in that were currently blasting music with a heavy baseline. The noise was almost unbearable, and Draco had to stand off to the side as to not be right in front of the speaker. Harry turned his back to the speaker and bounced to the baseline, just like everyone around them.
Malfoy moved until their noses were almost touching. “Saint Potter toujours vouloir que les gens s'inclinent devant lui. Se moquer de moi encore et voir où ça prend un rat comme vous,” with that he turned and stormed down the stairs. (saint potter always wanting people to bow before him. Mock me again and see where that gets a rat like you)
“Harry,” Draco called, shaking his shoulders gently, his bloody hand smearing blood onto Harry’s skin.
Turned out Harry couldn’t go flying the next day. It was a Hogsmeade weekend, and he would much rather spend it going through the shops with his friends.
Harry returned the smile before getting back to his notes and accepting a fist bump from the red head.
When he was out of sight, Draco’s body relaxed and his shoulders sagged. He pulled his coat tighter around his thin frame and turned to face the forest where Harry was watching.
Snape brushed a piece of hair out of Draco’s eyes. “Is there somewhere more private that we could go?” Snape asked, casting a glare at the trio, who hadn’t bothered to try and hide the fact that they were staring at the interaction.
