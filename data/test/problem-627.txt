gleams in the streaming sunlight. For what the structure and walls lack in color, the flowers more than make up for it. There are vines trailing up the sides of the doors and the two windows on the second floor reflect the blue sky perfectly. Butterflies dance over the display, bees hum around the decorations, and an owl hops along the ledge with a package tied on its foot.
You wonder if Potter remembered you too. (You wonder if you and Granger are friends now.)
Harry tugs on Ron's arm. "Show me the address. I didn't order this at all!"
offered an even better line of sight directly to Harry's favourite table. Especially if one stood at the bouquet display table shifted over twenty-three or so centimeters for optimal results. It also feels pertinent to mention that Draco's scheduled time to arrange display flowers just so happened to coincide with Harry's lunch break (nothing is ever a coincidence with Slytherins around).
undying muggle love," Draco corrects her, his glare melting into a sigh as he caressed the orange plastic in his palm.
Draco spluttered. “Some of us aren’t heathens Potter! We don’t take off our shirts in the middle of a fucking forest.”
[Unsent]
"I don't need any other reason to kill him, Hermione. There's not a drop of good blood in him. His mother is the reason Sirius is dead, Hermione.
PPS: I’m also bringing home Fluffy. Make sure the elves know not to frighten her.
Harry gave him a sly smile. “So does that mean you and Parkinson never had sex in the Forbidden Forest?”
It was there that he called you a friend when he asked Father's weird little elf, Dobby, to bring him and his friend hot chocolate. For a moment you didn't understand who he was referring to as a friend. Then you did. And it was as if your world stopped spinning on its axis. Never before had anyone ever called you their friend without an incentive before. But here Potter—Harry was, calling you his friend to get you bloody hot chocolate of all things. You came back every night after that one, to find Harry sitting there with hot chocolate and marshmallows and pillows. On particularly bad days, he even smuggled in some butter-beer. Sitting beside him, for the first time in ages, you felt happy, and you felt loved. Having a friend was an amazing thing.
Draco growled and pressed Harry down against the hood of the car, and pressed a deep long kiss.
"I'm the only boyfriend you've had, you idiot," Draco smiles into Harry's sweater.
“Harry then, Draco. Blimey that felt so weird saying out loud. Draco. Draco Draco Draco.”
. "I mean..." he stumbles, "I almost... I almost killed you Draco. For... for no reason!" He lifts his green green eyes to look at you pleadingly. "I don't... I can't... I almost murdered you, Draco!"
Eventually Draco sighs into his cauldron. “You can let go of your cloak, Harry. I know you’re there.” Harry doesn’t reply. Instead he watches the line of Draco’s throat, the elegance of his fingers. He remembers Draco’s skin against their sheets, and Draco’s voice in his ears.
, to feel betrayed, to lose everything he has, just like I did when his mother took Sirius away from me." Then he smirked. "'Sides, he's a good fuck. I might as well enjoy it while it lasts."
Finally, Draco stood up, and held out his hand. “Oh look at us, sniveling like a bunch of old women. Up you get Potter. We haven’t time to dally about.”
“Nu-uh.”
quite a while ago. It stands to note that as good of a view
"Draco please, let me explain," Potter pleads, but Draco pulls away.
Harry groans. Whack stuff happened to Harry’s things when Draco got too excited. Like breaking things. And taking things apart. And setting things on fire.
“It may…We may…The person you’re travelling with may or may not be Draco Malfoy.” She cringed.
Rookwood is crowing about the newest Death Eater raid in Devon that he's going to lead.
As Potter reached Draco and the child, the toddler had started crying from shock. Draco, being incredibly inexperienced with children, started panicking.
Potter clears his throat and pauses, then clears his throat again. It's okay, Draco's patient. Potter can take however long he wants to ask Draco out. "Malfoy. How are you?"
), and I reach behind to strap myself in.
, you remember yourself thinking while you were delirious from the hit to your head. It's not a bad idea. You turn over and start plotting.
Draco's going to cry; he's so delighted. "I am very good. How about you?"
"Oho!" cackles Ron as he lifts the letter out of Harry's reach. Harry curses. Damn George and damn working at the Wheezes for rubbing off on his brother. "Not so easily! You've got to explain this to me!"
The green-eyed man wrinkles his nose adorably. "It's so tiring. And boring. Mostly tiring."
And so the party of two became a party of three travelling on the roads across India.
Granger visits again twice to prepare you to go in front of Wizengamot. Initially you decide to cooperate with her just to humor her. You think her mad for even trying to get you a fair trial. (You're surprised you even get one.) But then you see Granger's notes, and you hear her strategize, and you realize—anyone who thinks Granger won't win is the one who is mad. She questions you, cross questions you, counter-cross questions you, until your brain is mush and you're sure that even under Veritaserum, you will only say what she told you to.
Harry imagined going to Hawaii with a shriveled old man, as nasty as Aunt Muriel, slinging insults at undercooked lobsters and nearly started crying.
Together, they silently creep downstairs to the big Christmas tree in the sitting room. The red and green lights shine prettily in the dark as Harry drops the bag on the ground with a thunk. “No, wait!” Draco says. “Pull that back up! I need to get a photo of you with the bag.” Harry obliges and twists this way and that way as Draco directs him while clicking away on his camera. “Now hold it in front of you. And stand like this...yes, just like that. Don’t move!” Harry groans but does as his husband asks. “Now bend over.” Harry drops the bag and straightens up.
But you're free. (Not that you deserve to be.) And everyone thinks you're a hero. And you've proclaimed your love for Harry Potter publicly. As a kid, you would've wanted nothing more perhaps. As an adult, you hate everything around you.
, he thinks faintly, as Draco finishes locking the front door behind him. Then he steps forward, and a conical leaf stuck to the front comes into sight.
“We should get going now,” Harry says after a minute. “Don’t want Scorpius or Teddy to throw tantrums if they wake and their gifts aren’t under the tree, do we?”
"So all you have to do is not tell him," Hermione hums. "He never has to know."
Suddenly strong arms wind around his middle and tan fingers grasp his wrists. Draco's heart stops beating. A warm chest plasters itself along his back, and a chin drops onto his right shoulder.
- he- “
Harry, not if Harry makes a mistake, not if they disagree, not if they’re apart awhile— not for
"My, my, Potter. I didn't know we had a professional singer in the house!" he teases. Potter squawks, looking just like the owl he was wrestling in Draco's shop earlier.
Harry's voice is hesitant when he speaks, his words carefully chosen. "Draco," he says, and his mouth draws you in like ambrosia. "I just... I'm sorry Draco. I'm so, so sorry." His eyes glitter in the night like two wet jewels. "For what happened back in Sixth year. For all of it. I was so angry and confused and fucked up that year, and I am so sorry, Draco. I was shitty and wrong, and you deserved none of it.” It doesn’t do anything. The apology, all it does is make you feel as hollow as ever. “I didn’t realize what we had was real until I went and ruined everything. And I know, we can't come back from what happened," he whispers every part of him looking shattered, ready to give up. “But, Draco, I still love you.”
She purses her lips at the meager bit of soggy crup-feed left in your food bowls and nearly has a fit when she notices the lack of any ratty mattresses or urine pots in your stony 25 square feet of space. Your father snarls, and your mother refuses to look up the entire time Granger is there.
"Malfoy," Potter says gruffly.
put on more weight than he’d thought this year, and there were those wrinkles starting to show up between his brows, and his muscles were getting less defined and…
He opens his mouth to do exactly that.
Draco turns Harry around and catches Harry’s hands against his chest. “I always do, darling,” he whispers, bringing their hands up to kiss Harry’s palms. “You know I do.” Harry feels his cheeks warm slightly and buries his face in his husband’s shoulder. Draco whispering in that voice, complimenting him… it never gets old. “Here let me,” his husband chuckles, and pulls Harry’s face away gently to spell his beard white. “There you go; all done.” He cards through it and Harry leans into Draco’s touch, his eyes fluttering closed.
Usually Harry says nothing, letting his colleagues have their way of showing care for him, but this time between the messy Bulstrode case, new Ministry budget cuts, and the upcoming Christmas holidays, the department was already stretching itself thin, and Harry had to put his foot down when the others tried to keep it from him. He was, after all, fully qualified to handle the case—in fact, he was the one who had started the entire department in the first place—and he wasn’t going to let a kid suffer less attention to their case just because his colleagues wanted to coddle him.
The next day, you sneak into the elves' sleeping area, and they show you passageways through the Manor no one remembers anymore. You find her, bloody and sobbing, tied up in Rodolphus' room. The entire way to the gates of the Manor, your heart threatens to beat out of your chest. There is no way they won't find out about your hand in this. But watching the girl stumble away into the woods, where Granger would have stationed a get-away team, you feel as if it is worth it.
Harry rounds on Ron. "Were you spying on me?" he gasps.
And again, and again. Mother is getting worried, but you can't bother to care.
, you hear every time Potter reaches for you in the middle of the night.
We went to the lake. And then the market. I guess I already talked about this.
With both the eldest Weasleys done, everyone else swarmed Harry to say their farewells. Harry finally pushed out of the crowd of his loved ones after half an hour, with Victoire hanging off one leg, and his robes hanging off his other shoulder. His hair was even more of a disaster than usual (courtesy of one Fred Weasley), and he was generally ready to leave. Especially since the portkey to India left in half an hour.
Your eavesdropping spell fell at the same time that you did. There, on your knees behind a suit of armor, you opened yourself up to the reality. People like Harry James Potter don't fall in love with people like you. People like you don't get to escape your fate and name. People like you don't get happiness. No. The only thing you deserve is pain.
“Okay,” I say. “You too.” He nods and walks back to his car.
“Remember only the very best behaviour,” Harry reminds him.
Mother wants you to see a mind healer. It's all bullshit. But it's bullshit that makes Mother happy.
Ron hollered for him from downstairs, and Harry reluctantly trudged down the stairs to see practically everyone he knew and loved. Of course there was an overwhelming amount of red hair, but there was a flash of blonde here and there from Luna and Fleur, and some dark hair from Neville and Hermione. At the sight of him, everyone burst into cacophony. Harry spotted Molly in the corner wiping her eyes, and made his way over, increasingly alarmed. As he got close, Molly flung herself at him, and pulled him tightly against herself.
Harry mentally smacks himself, gets the rest of the stuff out of the trunk, and follows Draco in.
"But you really won't believe it this time, Pansy!" Draco insists. He waits until she's taken a sip before saying, "Potter asked me to be his boyfriend!"
. He would do anything for Draco.
Harry sips his coffee and smiles at her. She smiles back and pulls out a journal filled with wrackspurt sketches. She starts writing something, and Harry goes back to looking out the window. Today, Draco's arranging green leaves around some red, petal-y, non-rose-like flowers (the narrator can confirm this one knows shit about flowers and that in reality, it's Acacia and carnations respectively). Draco tilts his head slightly, and the sight of his long pale neck makes Harry feel a certain kind of way. He dreams of wrapping his hands around those slim hips, of nuzzling that neck, of kissing that soft smile Draco reserves for his flowers. Draco's long silky hair is tied into a ponytail that spills softly over his shoulder and gleams gold in the sunlight. His pointy chin has softened slightly with time, but his nose and his cheekbones are as pointy as ever, and Harry loves it. He lifts his hands to stretch, and Harry sighs out loud as that reveals the long lines of his body. Oh to be able to cuddle against that on movie nights.
Almost.
, you think as you send that forward. Too many people know about it now. No one will be able to tell who, if anyone, leaked the information.
While Ron and Hermione were running around Diagon, battling birds (battling the
Then you open your eyes, and you wonder if he would notice that you'd stopped kissing him back.
. Harry half grabs the package halfway there and pulls with all his might. The owl pulls back, its claws dragging across Malfoy's furniture. Suddenly, both of them lose their footing and go tumbling to the ground, knocking over a couple more bouquets on their way down. The owl makes an ungodly sound right into Harry's ear. Wings beat in his face and he catches a mouthful of feathers. But he doesn't let go.
, and his dead body, your dead heart; cold metal around your wrists, and
Then Hermione giggles. "I wonder what the people below us saw?"
“But darling, what if he didn’t?” Parkinson asks gently. “What if it was something else?”
Drizzling
"Yeah," Harry says, a strange feeling at the back of his throat. He thinks of the open, happy expression on Mal-Draco's face when he'd thought Harry bought him a proper courtship gift. He thinks of the honest trusting way Draco laid himself bare on their nights out
, you think and you’re out of Theodore’s arms. Long halls, tall windows and you’re drifting like moonlight. Cold floors, soft breaths, and you can’t feel your heartbeat.
Harry sighed. “It’s been three years now. It just became a little too much for me. Too many memories. Too many missing faces. Fuck. I kept walking past the corridor where Fred and George escaped from Umbridge, you remember that? And I would keep expecting Fred to pop up and ruffle my hair.” He ran a hand through his hair. “I don’t think I’m going back. I kept thinking about it when I was in England, but these past few weeks have given me a perspective on how being happy feels like. I don’t ever want to feel the way I felt at Hogwarts again.”
The breeze brushes along my shoulder (
“What are you going to do when Draco calls Narcissa over to visit and brings out the dildo to show her?” Parkinson asks harshly. “Do you think Narcissa is going to be fooled with your pathetic pity-me-I’m-the-saviour act? Do you think she’s going to let the fact that you lied to her son to win his favour, slip?”
Harry had in fact talked to Malfoy after the trials. Their had talked at Luna’s party two months ago to be precise. Two months and three days ago. Two months, three days and three hours ago.
Potter seems to do a double take. "You...don't know what these are?" he asks incredulously.
They drag another muggle girl into your dungeons. You hear her screams for weeks on end, even after you were sure she'd died.
I guess what I was trying to say was… I don’t think you’re selfish. At least I try not to think that of you. I swear, I do. I try my best. I know you had your reasons, you tried your best, you didn’t mean to hurt me. (
he thinks to himself.
. “Do you want to scar our child with an image of half naked Santa?!” Harry charms his beard back to normal.
Harry spluttered some more and saw the clock while trying to change the topic. Then they both ran. There were only six minutes until the portkey left.
Sometimes you remember. Like whispers in a dream and sunsets on thin clouds and the emerald ring under your floorboards, it comes: a feeling, a
Draco
"Of course it is, Harry," waves Hermione in a what-can-you-do-about-it gesture. "But the package might also be delivered any day now. Do you want to take the risk?"
he'd said. You wish he would. You let Greyback slam your back against irons bars and plot ways to get the Gryffindors out of your dungeons before the Dark Lord shows up. You may need to blow your cover, but that's okay.
Harry gave a sharp nod.
Pott—Harry repeats under his breath. Draco ignores him. "Also, remember, we have Sunday lunches at the manor with my parents. I'll introduce you to them next week. Don't worry; they will more than be impressed with the wonderful declaration of your undying love for me."
Potter put a hand on Draco’s shoulder and reassured her it was no problem, and then he asked after their parents. Draco let him do the talking for the both of them, for he still felt incredibly shaken up.
. He’s never been more bored in his life.
Then there is a flash of light, and something thuds in front of you. Thunder rumbles through the floor, and you open your eyes to see Granger wrestling Potter's wand out of his hand. Potter rolls her over, and gets up with his wand still pointed at you. "Harry no!" she cries, climbing up to her knees. "Don't do this. You aren't like this!"
They bring in a pregnant halfblood girl, and instead of going to the dungeons, they take her up to where the Death Eaters are living. Father follows them in, avoiding your gaze, and Mother just grips your hand tighter. You spend that night on the bathroom tiles throwing up into cold porcelain.
We’re driving through some really hilly roads. A local called them the Ghat roads. They’re supposed to be really pretty. Personally, they are absolutely disgusting. I have thrown up four times in the last twelve hours we’ve been driving. We’re at at a muggle inn right now, stopped for some water. I refuse to get on the car for the next one hour. I swear to Merlin these roads were made just to torture me. Throwing up stomach bile is almost worse than Crucio. Almost.
“Walk me home?” he asks Draco softly.
"You never did explain to me what that orange thing
“YOU CHEATED ON DADDY!!” Scorpius screams and then bursts into sobs.
You hum. "For a while I knowed." Knowed? Knew? You're too woozy to think straight now. Your vision blurs and your eyes roll up. "Draco?" Granger's voice sounds panicked. Your hands give and you topple over to your left. The floor feels nice and cold on your cheek. Granger's voice goes in and out. The last thing you remember is her hands probing the back of your skull.
"Draco," Potter whispers.
You promise her.
. She sees a small fleck speeding towards her.
Love Barry.
"You can't do that without turning into a tomato already, Mate," Ron grimly informs Harry. "And yes, Hermione. Not the issue. We have to focus on how to do damage control now. Come on now, look at Harry." He makes his best pleading eyes and gestures towards Harry.
The tip of Mahendragiri mountains – Potter’s first time eating cotton candy. Don’t mind Potter’s face. In addition to excelling at being ugly, Potter does not understand the meaning of appropriate photograph expressions. Also the corncobs up here are amazing and perfectly smoked.
Harry hated it when he was right. At least last time, it had been only Hermione. This time she had joined forces with Ginny and Molly too, and Harry just wasn’t strong enough to resist even one of them most of the time, let alone three. They’d all jumped him during the wee morning hours on the following Thursday. While he was drinking his morning tea nonetheless, for fuck’s sake. As far as Harry could tell they have been harassing him for over an hour now (it’s a little hard to tell as the clock is obscured by a curly mess of brown hair as Hermione has refused to let go of his face until he agrees). He was going to survive this torture. He was going to…
. “You’re supposed to kiss DADDY!”
“Actually I think I would like that very much yeah.”
The night the Death Eaters test the cabinet, you offer to get Granger as many portkeys as she needs to evacuate all the mudbl—muggleborns from the castle. (You hope that includes Potter. You don't know what you would do if you had to face Potter tonight.) She shakes her head. Evacuating everyone would tip off too many people about your change of sides. Instead, she gets some Gryffindor army (the DA?) to be on hand if needed to do an emergency evac.
Malfoy looks suspiciously at him. "Cook? In my flower shop?"
“Hi yourself Potty” Draco drawled. “Enjoying your vacation?”
“A week’s free pass to let you call Ron ‘the weasel’?”
"No, but—" Harry protests.
You should've. You really should have.
Neville flushed. “Well I suppose she could have a reason.”
The sight of Harry breaking down, when it’s you hurting, opens a tap of deep anger inside you. "What, no righteous, pitiful, guilt-ridden speech for me, Potter?" You sneer, wishing Harry would stop looking at you. "Don't want to tell me all the ways my life matters, how much you care, huh? Or do you think I deserved it?" Beside you, Potter shakes his head vigorously, visibly crying now, and suddenly every inch of blood in you boils over, and all you can feel and see is rage. Your hands fall against his chest, and you
“Because you’re tired,” Harry points out. Draco’s face scrunches up, but all it does is make Harry bop that cute pointy nose. “You haven’t even changed.”
“Draco! Aren’t you going to help me with this?”
Potter chuckles and takes the seat across from him. A wine bottle bobs over and tips itself into two long flutes, and suddenly there's soft music playing in the background. They eat and talk and make eyes at each other (or rather Draco makes eyes and Potter blushes like an olde maiden). Draco is
. "Oh Potter got you that! He did, he did!"
Harry let out a muffled “Of course, Mrs. Weasley” and gave up on breathing while Molly was holding him. Finally, Arthur pulled his wife off of Harry, pointing out that perhaps suffocating the boy would not help to keep him here. Molly blushed and went off to fuss over Harry’s bags near the entrance.
“You know Harry. I am so happy for you. I really think going abroad will be so good for you.”
to see the soft gray clouds roll into the sky outside.
. And then again and again, on his ear, his brow, his sloping jaw, the bridge of his nose.
"It's from
Hermione looks at Harry. Then she sighs. "Okay, calm down Harry. We'll come up with a plan."
Luna’s. Bloody hell. Fuckity fuck. Pansy had told him nothing important happened while he had been rat arsed. That cunt!
Hermione huffed and curled her hands tighter about her steaming coffee mug. “A vacation Harry. You should take one.”
As we would expect, the moment that Mal-Draco's out of the door, Harry dives for the floo. Ron answers within seconds (almost as if he were waiting for it, hmmm).
This Wednesday, at the start of all time, is in most ways just like all other Wednesdays that came before it. Harry wakes up early, goes for a run, shows up to auror training five minutes late, runs more laps, and works his butt off until lunch, then he walks all alone to the cafe, drinks a vanilla latte, and stares out the window intently. After lunch, he's back at the Ministry getting bored in classes and feeling jealous of all his friends who have their lives together. At night, he will go home and get ready to do it all again the next day.
Driving up in the Eastern Ghats in Odisha – Potter’s first time driving up hills. Touch wood, hope we don’t both die. Also Potter cannot sing—don’t be fooled he is only singing the one word he think he knows from this Hindi song playing on the radio. Repeatedly. Completely out of tune. See also:  recording of Potter’s singing skills (kept for blackmail purposes).
Harry thwaps him on the arm. "Shuddup," he grumbles. "It's already been longer than three days, so it's not like I can change the order now, can I?"
Draco glances up at Harry through his lashes shyly as if to gauge his reaction, and his face drops "Oh," he says, sounding gutted. "You look like you're going to cry. You don't like it."
Luckily, Hermione, who had been writing away furiously, finally sits back and says, "Alright, boys. I have a plan." They both eagerly look at her. She holds up a paper with a diagram with lots of arrows and boxes. "Step one, we contact this
. Oh no, Harry does not want to upset Draco!
“What are we doing Harry?”
Malfoy.
"If you drop me, YOU'RE the one responsible for telling Molly who put her grandbaby in danger!" his wife yells. Ron panics harder and accidentally turns them upside down.
Luna absently twirls her wand, leaving trails of purple sparks everywhere. "You two were close in eighth year, no? I bet he misses talking to you." Harry frowns. They
“Hey look, Scorp, it’s me!” he cajoles again. Scorpius sees Harry and throws himself into his Daddy’s arms.
"Awwwww. Is the Saviour not happy at having to actually work for once in his life?" Draco teases.
You tilt your head, watching the curls on his head ruffle in the wind. Your eyes roam his lithe figure, drinking every angle and color in, as if he's the oxygen that keeps you alive. In his absence, you've alternately managed to convince yourself that seeing him would right every wrong in the world, or that his sight would tell you how far you've moved on from him. You were wrong. His eyes bring back every single minute of Sixth year that you thought you'd packed away, every memory that you thought you'd dealt with, every hateful feeling you thought you were over. His sight brings you pain. But you'd still die for him. You'd still kill for him. You're still bloody in love with him.
Draco you utter berk
Draco harrumphs. "Well. It's true. And now Potter and I are dating. Look he was so romantic, he even got me a courtship gift and a small love note!"
Thursday is bright and sunny: perfect weather for their plans. Ironically, they might have succeeded if it was rainy—there would have been much fewer birds around. However, as that would ruin the point of this tale, we are quite lucky it wasn't so. Quite lucky indeed.
There’s the path we took all those times, you throwing your arms behind your head and turning to look me in the eye. The Indian place just down the block from us, and there you are, in your finest suit, green bowtie, flawless smile. The wind blows, and your curls shuffle as they always did, exposing the small beauty spot on your forehead. The car in front slows down, I brake, and the pavement’s empty again.
The first time he talked to you without hatred in his eyes was during potions. It was two months into term, when you'd finally started realizing the sheer futility of trying to fix the cabinet. Mother's handwriting had gone from shaky to illegibly bloodstained, and Aunt Bella had started sending you updates on the number of muggles being tortured in your dungeons. It was after four sleepless days working on the cabinet, after your first failed attempt to kill Dumbledore, after Severus' first hints that he was reporting back to the Dark Lord. You were having panic attacks every three hours and failing all your classes, and you didn't care because you were failing at life too, and he would kill your parents if you failed, and you hadn't slept for days because your life was a living nightmare, and your hands were shaking, and you'd spilled the last of your moonstone all over the floor, and
That’s when I tried sending the letter by the way. But it wasn’t an emergency, so the postman refused to send it. Something about it not being auspicious.
“I don’t see any. I don’t see why your friends would choose to hire you for your physical strength. Maybe it was for your pretty green eyes. Would make anyone with sight hot.”
Their plans take-off during lunch break on Monday. Even Draco, who has at the moment no idea of this pinnacle of Hermione's planning genius, feels the gravity of the day when he catches Potter standing outside his shop fixing his hair and leather jacket, and nearly breaks his neck back-pedaling to double-check what his eyes saw. Potter. Potter dressed up.
But then again, a promise from a Malfoy hasn't ever meant much anyway, has it?
“She wants you to go with her.”
Harry blinked. Malfoy had just suggested they just explore. Bloody Malfoy. He was usually the one who would refuse to do anything that wasn’t ‘respectable’ (aka fun). Fluffy must have changed Malfoy more than he earlier suspected.
"I errr... I..." Potter trails off. "Date. I wanted a date. I mean, I like dates. You smell like flowers. Do dates have flowers?" Potter's picked up speed, and now he's rambling like a train speeding through a tunnel. "Er, do you want to go date flower picking?...uh...I mean not that they'd be pretty. Not like you. I mean like your flowers...er...Like those ones. They're pretty." Potter's blindly pointing at the only non-flower, leaf arrangement in the store. Potter's so
But you don't care anymore. Nothing could make you feel smaller than what you've already been put through. You don't have any dignity left to feel ashamed.
By the time he’s done with the chicken tikka masala, Draco has finished his shower and is waiting for him in the sitting room.
“See you tomorrow then?” Draco asks.
“Harry!” he gasps. “You’re back!”
You demur. Course not. Theodore
“I can still return them,” Harry says firmly, dropping the tree on the ground and putting his hands on his hips. “You know I will.”
PPS:  Tell the Weasleys I love them. Show Ron this letter too. Also Sorry Ron for not writing you a separate letter, but really it would have been the same anyways! Love you too!
"Of course you did," drawls Draco. "Of course you did. And I wasn't a massive git at Hogwarts"
Harry pales dramatically. “It wasn’t… It wasn’t like…” he stutters. Then an epiphany goes off in his head. “I’ll knock it over!” he gasps, feeling like a genius. “It’ll shatter, and then I’ll pretend to be sorry, and then… ”
Potter.
"Why?" you ask.
As Draco got more Puchka from the food tables, he watched Harry chase Sonia around the DJ floor. Neither of them knew how to dance, but they were enjoying themselves fully. Harry and Draco both had turned back and kept driving until they found civilization. From there they had decided to take a portkey to Kolkata to make it in time for the wedding. Draco and Harry were heading back to France tomorrow. He would miss having alone time with Harry, but he supposed he had the rest of his life to get Harry alone. He couldn’t still believe that he was romantically involved with the fucking saviour. He might not deserve him, but he sure wasn’t going to let him go. Harry made him happy. As he finished the spicy filling, he headed off towards Harry and Sonia. Maybe Harry would agree to trying one of the chili dumplings.
"Calm down, darling," she says as she steps out from her mother's old parlour. "You say that at least three times a day you know. It has lost quite a bit of its novelty." She has a cup of tea in her hands and a shawl around her shoulders.
A few minutes later Harry plopped himself down across from her with a sheepish smile.
“Just trust me, okay?”
to him?"
Scorpius hesitates and then grabs Teddy's hand, letting himself be led upstairs to Teddy’s room. Distantly, Harry hears the faint crackling of candy wrappers. He looks forlornly at the bag and his discarded suit and sits down heavily next to his husband under the Christmas tree.
Sonia babbled something in her native language, and Draco looked at the eldest girl for a translation.
On the 30th, you ask your mother to set you a meeting with Astoria Greengrass. The Greengrasses are wealthy, their reputation is untouched, and Astoria's a lesbian. It's the best match that will let both you and Tori stay on good terms with your families.
“When I was young, I dreamt that one day I would wake up and Father would walk in and tell me what a good child I was. I tried my best. I really did. I always pleased my tutors, I perfected my manners, I went out of my way to insult the Weasleys. It never was enough. I was never enough. And then he lead me straight into Voldemort’s circle, and well. That was that, wasn’t it.”
Draco blushed.
“Talk to Amanda?” Draco suggests. Harry considers it and nods.
Harry wished to touch that magnificence. Then he decided he was going to touch an Elephant. “I’m going to go pet it.”
That's good, you tell yourself. That's what you wanted. Misery follows you everywhere. She doesn't need that.
. This piece of stupid bendy muggle plastic- in itself it means nothing to me. It was always your dream of me passing my driving test, your pride in my skills at something so muggle, your excitement to see me drive up our driveway. Your hands teaching me, in your car. Your lips against my cheek when I messed up. Now… It tucks easily into the dirt along your gravestone, sliding in until only one pink rounded corner is visible.
—doesn't exist anymore. It stopped existing the day the Dark Lord crossed the Manor's threshold. Ever since, your fountains have been dry, your gardens dead. Nagini hunts your peacocks for sport and you haven't seen a butterfly since two summers. You can barely remember your parents' smiles. The elves may scrub as much as they want, but blood and torture stains every marble floor. You can't even walk to the kitchens without being harassed by werewolves, and Mother needs to lock every door and window before sleeping. Father is in Azkaban, and once he is out, he will never be safe. Whichever way the war ends, your Wiltshire is gone forever.
"We did," she smiles. "Harry's going to be so happy. Let's go down and get the package, shall we?" Ron grins and they both get to finding a way down from the ledge they're on.
PPPS: Since I cannot send another owl, and this one got delayed anyways, I might as well write out a full letter.
. Of course, there must be a dozen other things Malfoy has to do around the shop. But Harry can't help but feel the loss of the sight of Malfoy's perfect profile bending over his bouquets. Almost as if he expected Malfoy to be there doing the same task every time he saw him.
"Not what the Prophet seems to think." Draco smirks. "And anyway, I can call you whatever I want,
Harry and Neville only paused slightly. They were quite used to Luna’s antics, though, so Neville soon turned back to Harry.
“Of course we can. We always do!”
“It’s not just a tree,” Harry protests. “It is a
Every evening at six, you hide yourself away in Grand-mére's closet, and tune in to hear Lee and the Weasley twins run the underground resistance. You might not be a part of them, but they too thwart the Dark Lord to keep his attention off Potter, and for that you feel a kinship to them.
to think- it was
“Draco?”
Draco sipped his tea slowly, and hummed. They stood there in peace for a while. When the sun started peeking over the horizon, Potter shuffled beside him. Draco took a deep breath. Potter smelled like Earth and a hint of lemon. It made him feel dizzy. Or maybe it was the fact that they were not fighting. He’d gotten used to it over the past week, yet every time, every single time, the realization would trample him, put him into a grinder and liquefy any sane thought. Which probably explained the words coming out of his mouth.
Everyone's in position: Hermione behind the owl's mail-pick-up-stop with a bird trap, Ron in front of the owlery with his broom, Harry at
Harry points out, "Isn't tampering with owlpost illegal?"
Potter patiently waits for Draco to lock up, before offering his arm for a side-along. A bit shyly, he asks, "Would you rather get take-out and eat at home, or go to a specific restaurant?"
"But what is it? What does it do?" Draco asks impatiently.
Harry hummed and looked up from the fire.
“Harry. Mate. I heard you’re going to India?” Neville smiled warmly at him, brushing his hands over the leaves on his Tentacula. Harry open and closed his mouth.
Malfoy's sharp gaze lands on him and the bird. "Were you fighting with my post owl?" he asks, sounding a little dazed. Harry's afraid that if he opens his mouth, he'll burst into tears. Malfoy shakes his head. "No, wait. Don't answer that." He raises his hands. There's a pause, and then Malfoy turns around as if he's had some revelation he can't bear. "You know," he says in a voice so hollow it makes Harry want to cry even more, "Auror Potter. You didn't have to pretend to befriend me to ransack my place. You know they wouldn't hear my complaints anyway." He raises a single hand to his face. Harry wants to scream. He wants to deny everything, to tell Malfoy the truth, to tell him how
Draco strikes a pose in the mirror. “Malfoys don’t get fat,” he says in his snottiest Lucius voice.
“What do you mean change back?” Harry hisses back. “I already took off the Santa costume!”
"Up here!" he shouts over the squabbling birds. Hermione grabs his hand and hauls herself up. It's a tight fit between him and her and their unborn child, but he manages to wrap his arms around her belly and the broom. Then, Ron swoops up again, and the birds follow them, pecking at her bag and flying into Ron's face. "AAAAGH!" he screams and nearly upends them both.
Teddy smiles at the child and confirms, “Lots of candy. Even,” he dramatically lowers his voice but Harry can still hear him, “candy Papa and Daddy don’t know about.”
Harry just winked at Draco and said, “It comes with the job description. All you need to do is have a prophecy name the month you are going to born in. That is all.”
Anyhow then they took us to a local market in Bhubaneshwar. Everything was so colorful! We bought me and Malfoy some traditional Indian clothes to wear to the wedding. Malfoy got this grey kurta that brings out his eyes so beautifully. That was pretty brilliant. Then we got ourselves some bedcovers. Malfoy even got his mom some pretty jwellery. He is so thoughtful. We stayed the night there, and the next day we went to these caves (I can’t spell them I’m sorry Hermione—I’m sure you can figure out where if you want to), and spent the first half of the day there.
The chill of the night settles into your bones as you watch a falling star make its way towards the Earth. If Mother was here, she would tell you to make a wish. “
“Whoa Potter. What do you think you’re doing?”
For the first time ever, I turn onto the main street without you in the passenger seat. Quaint shops pass me on either side, some I don’t recognize. I stop at the red light and glance towards the coffee place we went to for our first date. In the past year and a half, it seems nothing has changed— the decorations, the busy lines, the cute waiter you tried to make me jealous with. And you leaning against the entrance, waiting for me to catch up— I turn back sharply to look again, but you’re not there anymore. The dormant heartache I’ve carried around ever since you left takes a breath and expands like a living entity, fluttering all over in my body. I grit my teeth and look away.
The credits start rolling, and Harry turns the screen off. Taking care to not wake Draco, Harry slips off the sofa and kneels in front of it. For a moment, he lets his hand lay on Draco’s knee, drinking in the disarray of blond hair across rosy cheeks and the slight drool collecting at the corners of parted lips. Then, he brings both of Draco’s arms around his neck, cradles Draco’s head on his collarbone, and slides a hand beneath each of Draco’s thighs, guiding them around his waist. He hoists him up. The muscles in Harry’s shoulders protest, but he pays them no mind. Draco’s head rolls sideways, and Harry has to heave him upwards again to bring it back into the crook of his neck. Draco shifts sleepily, a hand curls loosely into Harry’s collar, another into the back of his shirt.
“Yes? Yes. No. Maybe.” Draco ran a hand down the railing, lowering his eyes and voice. “I don’t know. Maybe.”
Everyone else exclaimed softly as he showed them Sonia’s find.
. They reach Harry’s doorstep, and Harry unlocks the door.
"Sorry Harry. They said they can't unship the package. It's already in the pipelines." They're all congregated in Harry's cubicle at the Ministry. Harry doesn't remember when Hermione and Ron had last been here, and secretly he can't help but feel a little grateful for that rogue box of sex toys for giving him his friends back for a short while.
Hermione rounds on him. "Drunk?! On a working night?! Harry!"
"Draco," Potter says, his dark hair tickling Draco's ear. Their cheeks brush slightly, and Draco can feel Potter's lashes flutter. "My dearest Draco," Potter says again, but this time the hands on Draco's arms turn him around to face Potter. Draco cannot
and—“Draco, darling?”—
In Draco's defense, the whole set-up is really quite beautiful. The vase is tall, elegant, and classy, and within it, a tasteful assortment of autumnal flowers and leaves complement the glass dildo. A string of glass beads wraps around the neck of the vase, and shiny silk and pumpkin vines net cover the rest of the vase. Strategically placed magical orbs shine light into the piece, scattering thousands of tiny rainbow segments across the room.
"I do! I love it," he exclaims, very very loudly. He wraps himself tightly around his boyfriend, and hides his face in the crook of Draco's neck. (A good thing Harry did that; after all, it is the only way he'll be able to get away with lying so blatantly.) "I love it
"Potter?" Malfoy's voice asks incredulously from behind the shelf as the package swirls away into the flames.
Harry fumbled, and it hurt sometimes, and it was awkward and inexperienced, but it was you and Harry, and for you, it was perfect. Everything was perfect. That night, you chose. Harry over your parents, good over evil, short life over survival. And you've kept choosing Harry ever since. This night won't be any different.
Luna, the good woman, had brought him his favourite comfort food from Fortesque’s without prompting. How she always knew when he needed comfort, Harry would never know. She sure was brilliant.
You scream: body, mind, soul. It pauses, chuckles. “You remember, do you?” A swish of heavy fabric, bony fingers around your neck, Theodore’s cold ash wand at your temple. “Let’s fix that.”
"He found the toys and thought they're a muggle courtship gift," Harry groans. They gape at him. Then Ron sniggers and Hermione slaps him on the arm.
. But because he's a Good boyfriend (and because there is the pesky problem of Harry not wanting to tell Draco about the sex toys), he doesn't say that. He does move their kissing to the bedroom, though, and if he has motives other than sex, well, Draco doesn't know that either.
yet most baffling gifts Draco has received; even better, this is the only romantic gift Draco has ever gotten. "What
But. Wait.
They bundle up (or rather bundle each other up) and head out. The sun is close to setting, and all the critters and nightlife are stirring. A comfortable silence settles between them. Harry keeps stealing glances at his boyfriend as they walk. The golden sunlight streaming in from behind them makes Draco look like an angel complete with a halo and shining skin. He catches Draco peeking back at him, and they both smile into their scarves. Then a hand takes Harry’s and squeezes. Harry looks at Draco who is already looking at him. Harry squeezes back.
He starts to take his leave and then stops. “Hey,” he says. “Drive safe, yeah?”
I’m good too, if you’re wondering. Training’s kicking my arse, but it’s worth everything. Even Healer I-never-smile-or-compliment-anyone will notice good work eventually. And I am the best.
He manages to wrap one of his arms tightly around the package, and hangs on for dear life as talons and beaks and feathers scrabble around him.
doesn't deserve what you're doing to him, Harry, please. You're not a murderer!"
Love Pansy.
“What is it?”
“It’s just a tree, Harry!” Draco whines. “Let’s get one and go already.”
“Oh wow.”
Every eye in the courtroom is on you, picking you apart, wishing you the worst fate possible. The prosecuting attorney's smirk has slowly deepened as he continues to demand damning answers from your mouth. By now, you don't even care as much about getting out of Azkaban, as you do about smashing the prosecutors face in. The audience has started whispering now, no doubt maligning you at every accusation the prosecution brings up.
Potter let out a hearty laugh. Honestly. That wasn’t that terribly humorous.

I pause at the sight of her red nails curling on the window sill.

Potterwatch reports about the Gringotts break in. When you ask Granger, all she tells you is that yes, there in fact was a pale dragon.

I am missing you guys so much.
Ron frowns as he hands Harry a glass of muggle whiskey. "What's wrong mate? You kept the ferret from having his sex toys. This is a night for a celebration innit?" Harry groans and takes a long swig.
. (Except, hello, no chance—this narrator still lives and breathes.) So, when Harry walks into Draco's apartment for their first date together, the poor unsuspecting man is absolutely not prepared to deal with Draco's decoration. Harry freezes—mind, body, soul—and his eyes zero onto the dildo proudly bobbing in a vase hovering above Draco's center table.
, he'd forgotten what a heady rush it is to be able to see that beauty spot on the edge of Potter's lip.

Harry sent him puppy eyes.
Harry packs up, wears his muggle coat and makes his way to the front, making sure to bid the old lady at the front desk goodbye. A cool light breeze welcomes him as he steps out of the building. He looks up to the sky with not a whit of blue in it. It will rain soon; he should apparate home. Instead, he puts his hands in his pockets and starts walking. The streets he walks through feel just as grey as the heavens. Not the gloomy kind of grey, but like the grey of Draco’s eyes. The light peaceful kind of grey that feels infinitely bright. Harry’s favorite kind of grey. The sounds of children laughing echo in the distance as Harry approaches the neighbourhood playground. He watches as a football bounces over the wall, and the kids chase it across the street. They’re all so very
Hi Hermione,
; Draco loves it.
On the ground, Hermione puts her owl treats in the trap and waits. In the middle of the previous night, she'd found herself a nifty little spell to put on the treat that made it irresistible to any bird in a fifteen meter radius. There was no way the trap could fail.
We're so happy you could find some pleasure in our catalog of Autumn themed toys. This owl is to confirm your order and shipping address. Please reply within three days of receipt if any of the details need to be changed, or if you've decided not to take advantage of our goodies. If there's no reply, we shall ship the order and you can expect it anytime next week! Happy playing!
“Papa,” the child chokes out. “You… you kissed Santa Claus!” Both Harry and Draco still.
Into the pot go the onions, and he stirs them lazily, simultaneously flipping the parantha on the pan. He fishes out a tomato. The shower turns on upstairs, the thrumming sound making Harry smile softly.
“Neither do I,
“I’m telling you aren’t I? Sides. I might as well learn from the best while I have him about.”
“Help? What seems to be the problem?” Ron thumped down the stairs. His best friend had recently taken to imitating Professor Queenly or something from a frog’s factory Rosie liked to watch on the TV. But then he saw the three women surrounding his best friend. And he slowly backed away. “I think you should listen to what the smart people are saying Harry,” Ron said nervously.
Mal-Draco flushed. “What are you doing Potter?”
from the passenger seat. I turn my head to the side, and for a split second, the leather seats smell- they smell- and I can almost reach- no. It’s gone. A storm boils up within me until the arrow flickers green on my dash, then that’s gone too, and I’m numb again. Unfeeling, cruel, cold. (
Neville nervously chuckles. “I thought you were right? Hermione told me.” Then his eyes widened. “Wait did she not tell you?!”
jealous.
He hasn’t been here in a decade. Not since eighth year ended. Yet, their room’s just as he remembers:  bare and stony and a bit chilly. Outside, brilliant blue skies and cloudy Scottish mountains. In the middle, a bubbling cauldron and Draco, his blonde lashes and braids glinting in the sunlight.
“Yes?” Draco asks, his voice a whisper, wobbly, unsure. Fabric rustles, and he takes a step forward, and stops. “I…you…” Draco’s voice hitches. “
But your throat hurts, and everything in you is stuck, and all you can do is stare at the space between your pinky and his on the railing, remembering cold flagstones underneath you, green curse fire above you, Harry's murderous voice around you, and you remember how you hurt that year, all the time how you hurt, how you still hurt sometimes (often-a-times).

Except.
Over the summer, you and Granger manage to work out a way to exchange notes inconspicuously. The Ministry falls. Granger tells you she's going camping with Harry instead of to Hogwarts, so you helpfully tell her all of the Snatchers locations on the island. She doesn't tell you where they are going, but she doesn't need to. You're smart enough to figure it out if you need to.
“Draco!” Pansy gasps, mockingly scandalized. “Surely we can’t drink that much wine! For lunch that too!”
"Should I?"
“I’ve had enough hate for a lifetime. Haven’t you?”
First of all, Malfoy is so annoying! We finally got out of customs and all that good stuff at like 7 pm. It took us three hours. Three hours Hermione! Malfoy said that it’s because “This isn’t the English Ministry where you get a free pass due to the virtue of being the Saviour, Potty.”  Also there are so many people here! So. Many. People. And they are all wearing such bright clothes.

Dear Draco,
Ron raises his hands. "Just sayin' mate. You already got him fluffy handcuffs and anal beads; I think you're past the kissing stage now."
was better off because of it. (Except one poor post owl, but oh well. Needs must.)
Harry passes a comforting hand over Draco’s flank soothingly. “Your back?” He’s answered by another groan. Harry turns on the bedside lamp and tugs up Draco’s shirt, lifting his upper body to let it slip off his arms. Then he lets Draco down and gently turns him over onto his stomach. Outside, the rain hammering on the windowsill slowly peters out.
Aren’t you proud, Harry?
You press yourself against the freezing bars and, in a voice rasping with pain, tell her the name of every single guard who has tried to convince your mother to sell her body in exchange for being treated as a living being. Granger does not care much for you, but she does care for justice. And Granger's a woman herself. Her mouth tightens, and you know she'll take care of it.
Don’t ever fucking thinking you can fucking avoid me by going to another country. I can and will always find you. Write me a fucking letter, you useless man.
Two more lights, and another turn. By muscle memory, I stop right outside the third blue building. It stands there, looking the same, looking like it's still ours except- the for sale sign is gone. That rose bush there, that’s new. And the windows are cleaner. The little ornaments Teddy hung up at our door whenever he visited, they’re gone. The door opens, and for a second you walk out the door, wearing your apron, cake batter on the corner of your mouth. For a second, I’m walking down the path to you, jogging, running, to fling myself into your arms and let you carry me home. Only for a second. Because you’re not here, this house isn’t ours anymore, and I’m never going to be in your arms again. I start the car again, and I don’t look back.
Soon there is a small pile of letters, bearing Harry's chicken scratch, near the front door. When Granger visits, she frowns. "I'll talk to him," she says. "You've done enough for him. He'll stop."
“Oh Harry! We’re all going to miss you so much! Make sure to stay safe yes? And let…I mean take care of yourself my dear boy.”
Potterwatch thanks the anonymous tipper for the rescue. You turn it off.
, she corrects herself.
“What the hell you doing, mate?” the man with an umbrella and red face snaps. I just sit there, quiet, wide-eyed as the rain water soaks through my side of the car. “You out of your bloody fucking—” his eyes catch on something on my face, and he stops. My fingers reach out to touch my cheek, and it comes away wet. “Mate?” he asks, blue eyes suddenly a little softer, reminding me of the Weasel.
Harry’s flat look returns and intensifies. Draco pouts harder.
Pansy nearly spits out her tea. "What?" she asks weakly. "I thought you were joking about the Potter coming around everyday and taking you out to romantic dinners, thing. Ow! Don't hit me. It was a completely reasonable assumption considering your histories!"
Then Potter smiled at him. (Potter! Smiled! At Him!). “I do have to say you’re quite a cute drunkard. You talk so much.” Wait, what? Buggering hell. What secrets had he spilled to Potter in his drunken stupor? How much did Potter know about him that Draco didn’t know that Potter knew? He made a strangled gurgling noise and promptly blushed brighter in embarrassment.
"Ron!!"
offered into the flower shop,
“Draco, we can’t just choose a tree based on how much you- er, our ferret likes to climb it?!”
Harry's eyes rove over toppled vases, crushed flowers, scratched shelves, and shattered glass. By the time his eyes meet Malfoy's gaze, he can barely breathe. His gut churns; there's a tremble running all over him. Suddenly, he becomes terribly aware of the now cold coffee drenching the front of his robes, and the back of his neck heats up. Harry wishes he could vanish into thin air. Malfoy's eyes go from his face to the owl in his hands back to his face. Then they go around the shop just like Harry's had.
Harry smiles shakily. The cloud parts outside, and everything dissolves into light.
comfortable talking to Malfoy beyond pleasantries, and he
“So am I Potter.”  They were quiet for a long time after.
"A courtship gift. Exactly. Completely honorable, and given with lots of—"
, he tells himself. No projecting. Then he gets up. It’s getting late anyway, and he’s read the file enough times that it’s burned into his memory. It’s time to go home.
We went to the Lingraja temple first. It was so beautiful! Did you know that the temple kitchens make food to sell in the nearby markets, and that is how the temple staff gets their money? So brilliant. We ate the temple made food for lunch. It was too spicy for me, but the sweets were glorious. SO MUCH SUGAR IT WAS HEAVEN.
Harry turned to the redhead beside her. “Ron? Do you have something to say?”
Draco’s head whipped around in horror. “Harry no! You’ll get killed you buffoon!” Harry ignored Draco. If Hagrid had taught him anything in their last twelve years of acquaintance, it was that any animal could be tamed. You just needed respect and love. And probably a little bit of giant in you. But that was okay. Harry could manage without. Draco hurried after Harry as Harry swam upstream to the Elephant herd.
Malfoy flushed. He didn’t remember Potter being so self-assured either, but the last week had taught him a lot about Potter that he didn’t know before. Like how he liked to butter his toast right up to the crust, and how he left his socks everywhere (though to be fair he could have guessed that one).
“Why is everyone here?”
"What did you lie to me about, Potter?" Draco insists, his voice rising in volume and pitch. Harry looks so guilty. Oh Merlin, this was where Harry revealed he didn't love Draco at all, isn't it?
Harry looked over at Malfoy in question.
"So you are doing this to avenge Sirius, is that it? Why pretend to be his boyfriend, and make him feel loved, only to kill him?"
"HERMIONE!" Harry hollers. "HERMIONE!"
“And she’s always right too.” Luna reminded them from beneath a pile of conjured bananas.
“Draco look! There’s a waterfall up there!” Harry exclaimed pointing to a cliff in the distance
“You too,” Harry says.
“Are we done yet, Harry?” he whines, putting on his best cute pleading face, which even in his human form always gets him his back rubs. His husband just hums, deep in examining the trees and not even deigning to look at him. Draco scowls and pokes Harry repeatedly in the arm.
Draco ignores him. "You don't have to stay or try to explain or… or anything. I understand." He pulls his jacket tighter. "I do."
When Granger comes to visit you, she's wearing an orange suit with long dangling earrings. She looks light years different from the girl you remember during the war—half-starved, mud-streaked, and nearly mad. She looks light years different than you in your tattered sandpaper tunic and grime caked face. No one would guess she'd been in a war just weeks ago.
"I suppose you do," he murmurs into Draco's hair, and then pulls back to give Draco a deep lingering kiss. And Harry's not lying; Draco
Rainy
“Wow” Draco whispered. The Elephants were absolutely majestic.
"You knew he was going to kill you." The bare trees outside in the forbidden forest wave in the wind and heavy rain, and your silence is answer enough. You wonder what tipped her off. She repeats, dazed, "Oh my god. You knew he was going to kill you."
“Well,” Draco says at last. “At least we won’t have to buy Scorpius two sets of presents next year.”
Clear
Ron whistled in awe. “I never thought I’d see the day when
Draco takes a deep breath in and then sighs contently right into Potter's ear. "Hmmmmmm. I
“Oh hey, darling,” Harry tries, running a hand down Scorpius’ back. “It’s okay. It’s all okay. Hey, here, shush, my love. I know, I know, I’m so sorry Papa upset you. That was unfair of him. But see, Papa
“Hurry up, Harry! Seriously, anyone would think you want to spend all night here. Now, let’s see…this one is obviously a no-go. But hey, now this one, on the other hand…this one’s going to be so much
“Pansy,” Blaise interrupts gruffly from behind her. I look up, and he’s wrapped an arm around her waist, gently pulling her away from the car. He catches my eyes and nods. “A man’s gotta have some closure, darling. You just trust him.”
been sort of close. But only at night, when Harry would stumble down after a nightmare to find Draco wrapped in a tartan blanket awake from his own nightmares. They had talked—shared feelings and jokes and even tears—but never in daylight. And never once off Hogwarts grounds. Even now, when Draco nodded at him in the street or across a room at a Ministry event, it felt as if there was a glass wall between them as if they were strangers and their time together had been just a dream left behind.
—I’m not an utter berk. Then we came back to the inn and we played cards. We went to these waterfalls the day after. They were so pretty. I  persuaded the cook at our inn to make us some nice sandwiches (which again had spices in them. Seriously? I am still pissed. Malfoy said it is good for my countenance. What the hell even is a countenance?). We had a good picnic in a grassy place nearby, and then I had a good long sleep in the sun (there’s sun here!). Malfoy refused to lay down like “common riffraff”. He is so pretentious (Ha! See I can use big words too Malfoy you wanker).
"You don't know that," Harry says petulantly.
“Use those Auror muscles, Potty!” Draco cackles, running upstairs.
He had woken up to Potter snoring in a bed not ten feet from him and was now waiting for him to finish bathing. The caretaker of the small four room wooden motel they were staying at had filled up a couple buckets with hot water in case the electricity went out, but Draco had taken a cold water bath anyways.
Harry glared at Hermione, and she ducked her head low and rushed out of the elevator. Ron on the other hand was trying to stammer out excuses (mostly comprised of, “It was Hermione’s idea”). Harry couldn’t take it anymore and burst into laughter.
And that may have been the end of it; if what happened that night hadn't happened. Harry was mortified and shy, and he very well would have hidden away for the rest of eternity. But, it did happen. And the narrator can gladly say that
“Pride?”
Stifling his mirth, Harry hurried right after him. Shite. No umbrella. The rain poured down the back of his collar, and Harry swore. He ran back inside Grimmauld Palace. Slicking his hair back, Harry found Molly at the entrance with everyone else. After another fifteen minutes of hugs and kisses, Harry finally found himself at the Ministry alongside Hermione.
"Only to get me out of there," Harry cries. "Why else would he tell me that auror training was going to start soon? He wanted me out of there!"
“You?” Draco asks him.
Ron sighs dramatically. "Oh, Harry you're such a blushing virgin." Harry sputters in indignation. "Okay, okay, here, look we can both read it, how about that?" Finally, Ron brings the letter low enough for Harry to be able to read the first half of it.
Potter’s also taken to writing a travel journal. He’s always scribbling away in it whenever we get back
"Because it's not right," she murmurs, clenching her jaw. "It's not right, what they're doing to you, after all you've done for us. All you've done for Harry." What you did. What did you do?
"If killing me meant Harry would be happy, I was okay with it. If signing my death sentence by spying on the Dark Lord meant Harry would be safe, I was okay with that too," you say clearly. Gasps go up all around you.
“It is tea time, you numbskull.”
“I don’t do casual sex, Potter.” Draco murmured.
A small traitorous tear slips out the corner of Draco's eyes. "Potter?" he says, lips trembling, chest full, ears buzzing.
In the end, he takes your elf, and your wand, and leaves you behind (like always). Without your wand to keep them away, the werewolves make sport of you, and the Dark Lord tortures you for days on end, but it's okay because at least Potter got away.
Dearest Pansy,
There, about twenty feet from you, stands a lanky man drowning in over-large tatty clothes. You'd recognize that set of shoulders anywhere. A cigarette dangles from his fingers, and there are lines across his forehead that didn't exist even at the height of the war. Where Granger looks exponentially more radiant with the passing of time after the war, Potter looks as if he has aged centuries. He turns, and his dull eyes catch on yours. "You came," he says, wonder lining his brow, and the clouds rumble again overhead.
Harry flushes and looks away. "It's not a date, you guys. We're just catching up."
Harry’s throat goes dry. “Yeah?”
"Yes," Draco agrees fondly. "They came in just this morning. Would you like to buy a couple of them?"
Draco watched as Potter sweet-talked the old couple who owned the wooden hut they’d rented for the night. They seemed strongly affected by Potter’s awkward charm. Draco would know. He found it more endearing then he should. Draco nudged Potter, nodded at the couple, and started walking towards the fields. The day was warm, but the evening sun was not too sharp. It was brilliant. Draco wandered about aimlessly for a bit.
Draco puts the box aside, beams at Potter and announces, "I accept, of course."
“Hello, Potter.” She smiles. Draco whips around.
their shack that, but I suppose that's beside the point." Pansy chokes and starts turning purple.
"Hey! I did have to work in my life! Probably more than you did, you rich ponce," Potter shoots back, apparently comfortable in this familiar territory of snarking at each other.
"It's some kind of muggle courtship ritual gift, Potter told me," Draco says proudly as he produces the box that Potter gave him. "Look there are a lot of small little trinkets." He opens it for Pansy and delicately pulls each one out and puts it on the table. Then he wrinkles his nose. "Potter bought it from some Analstacia lady with a Whack Shack. No clue who would name their daughter
wordless charms. Draco's sure there are hearts in his eyes. Potter's eyes crinkle in a smile, and he gestures Draco out the door. He obliges and follows the food out to a small glass table with candles lit up all around it. His breath catches and he glances towards Potter who is nervously waiting for Draco's reactions. If he had any doubts about Potter's affections, he had none now. "It's perfect," he proclaims and with a flourish, he settles into his chair. "Come, Potter. I'm hungry."
Ron shoves a couple more chips in his face and twirls around on Harry's wheely chair. "That sucks mate," he says with a full mouth. "But hey! Harry made progress. Tell her Harry!"
“Oh well,” Draco huffs. “Since you are too much a brute to do it yourself and let me watch your biceps flex, I will lend you a hand.” A swish and a flick, and “

When Draco nodded mutely, Potter turned around, just so that the light set fire to the tips of his hair.
Oh, it’s not you, it’s me, so easy for

But, at night in the dead’s domain, your past comes calling—flowing whispers and trailing mists, billowing lace curtains and reflecting round glasses—and you answer.
Love Harry.
opened. It is no wonder then, that our story starts here (though one could argue it actually started at Hogwarts, or even earlier in Madam Malkins, we shall assume our audience is familiar with the convoluted saga that is the backstory of our two lovely boys).
When Draco reaches Harry's apartment that evening, he can smell the curry through the door. It smells
As the leader showed his approval, some other more daring elephants came periodically to investigate the humans standing in the middle of their herd. Harry tried dragging Draco to pet them, but Draco was having none of it. Until a baby elephant accompanied one of the bigger elephants near them. Despite being much smaller than the adult elephants, the top of its head still reached Harry’s chest. Harry reached out slowly and put a hand on its head.
. The sweetness, the crispiness, the greasy saucy hit—Draco's never had the likes of it. He
You are cold and alone and empty and
Ron nods vigorously and smiles hopefully at Harry. "It's all fixed! See?"
?" Harry sputters, and Draco tweaks Harry’s nose. "I know everything," he says with his nose in the air. "Always." Everything in Harry softens. For all of Draco's posturing, he knows how insecure and soft Draco is inside. He draws Draco even closer, and a sudden bout of protectiveness flows through him. He feels so full, so tender, so
it later when Potter's not looking.)
"It isn't like that," Harry whispers. His lips feel parched and his head is buzzing and his voice is barely wisps of air. The perfect cover up comes to him right that instant. He shoves the bird in front of him and conjures up the most indignant voice he can. "I came here to cook lunch for you, but your owl attacked me the moment I set foot inside." The owl hoots indignantly at the blatant lies, trying again to peck him on the hand. This time Harry lets go. The owl hoots louder, plucks a tuft of hair off Harry's head (Harry shrieks just a bit) and flies off. "See?! It's violent!"
“Thank you.”
Both Harry and Draco rush over to the stairs. There’s glass shards and water scattered across the floor and the lowest step, and five steps above stands Scorpius looking rattled and scared. Harry immediately vanishes the glass and dries the floor as Draco goes to gather Scorpius into his arms. Only, as soon as Draco reaches for their child, he flinches back and falls onto his little butt on the step behind him.
As always is the case when there's an acute crisis in need of a solution, Ron and Harry go immediately running to Hermione.
Draco resists the urge to give in already.
Molly beamed at Harry. “And if you don’t want to go alone I can find you a companion. Aunt Muriel was singing praises of this travel companion she went with Australia to this summer, and I really do think you’ll love him.”
“No,” his dragon replies blithely, coming to sit next to him. “Now here, hand over the food.” Harry obliges. The titles roll onto the screen.
?” Draco asks, holding up two CDs. Harry tilts his head.
Suddenly, something crashes down the stairs. Harry starts.
“How...Is there some sort of class you Gryffindors take? Introduction to How to do the most extraordinarily daring things without dying. A Comprehensive Guide to get away with all kinds of bullshite.”
Draco huffed out a chuckle before Harry tackled him in another kiss. They didn’t get much past the snogging, but Harry was okay with that. Really. After all, they had the rest of time to do whatever they wanted. Right now, he just wanted to kiss Draco some more.
Draco thought of itty-bitty Potter with large round eyes thinking so in the darkness of a cupboard. The thought made him unbearably depressed. He shuffled to lay properly on the ground (oh how Potter was corrupting him), and rolled over to face him.
Malfoy didn't hate him, he couldn't bring himself to open that door knowing there was a package of sex toys possibly flying towards them that very moment. It was probably better if he didn’t go inside anyway, Harry thought balefully. He'd end up spilling the beans to Malfoy if he did.
He swirls his coffee and waits for Malfoy to appear.
and the tree floats merrily indoors.
"Yes," Draco beams. "Pretty aren't they all?"
He made his way over to Ron and Hermione, while swinging Victoire up into his arms.
Both Hermione and Harry whip around to screech, "Ron! NO, what the fuck?"
The war is over. Harry did it. He killed the Dark Lord. You feel nothing but a tired sort of numbness. Your family huddles in the far corner, part of neither the defeat nor the revels. Your mother tells you, the way Harry survived the killing curse again. She holds you tight, and despite Father's disproving gaze, she whispers to you the way she lied to keep Harry alive. Because she loved you.
At the next crossing, the map tells me to take a right. I take a left. Onto a path I’ve walked innumerable times, waking and asleep, under a canopy of stars and bright sun, alone and… alone. That park over there? You wouldn’t know it, but it has a tire swing- your favorite. Creaks every other oscillation. That corner there? An ice cream truck parks every Tuesday evening. Sells all of Teddy’s favorite flavors. This spot I’m passing here? No trees overhead, but buildings block the sun in the evenings. Perfect place to park. I always wanted to bring you here. I wanted to bring you to so many places, do so many things, buy so many presents…. You didn’t give me the time, the chance. (
When the alarm goes up, you jump straight into action. While most your classmates prepare for battle, you track down every first, second and third year Hogwarts still has in its bowels, and you hide them far far away from the war. They scream and they fight you all the way, but you don't mind a few extra firstie bite marks if it means that all the kids are safe.
Okay," Harry decides. "Okay, yes. I am going to talk. To Draco." He breathes in deeply and puffs his chest out. "I am going to talk to Draco." He throws down an extra tip, kisses Luna's forehead, and determinedly walks out of the cafe. Luna hums happily and takes to finishing the rest of Harry's coffee.
But it seemed like something he said struck a chord with Malfoy because the other man's face softens radically and he almost smiles. "Alright, Potter." Then he looks all over the shop and grumbles, "I swear if it was literally anyone other than you..."
," Ron snorts. "It's a confirmation of shipping. For something called the Autumn Gentleman's Pleasure Kit?"
“Why are you telling me this Potter? Is this where we let out our deepest wimpiest childhood desires?”
“Harryyyy,” he drags out. “Harry. Harry. HarryHarryHarryHarryHar-”
Remember how I told you in my last letter we were going to look for a farmhouse to stay in on our way to Cuttack? Well we found one. We stayed at this place owned by an old couple. They were super sweet, and their food was amazing. We saved their granddaughter when she fell out of a tree, so they actually invited us to their youngest daughter’s wedding in a week. Malfoy was a bit put off that I agreed to come without asking him, but since he didn’t have any better plans, we are going.
