I nodded, refusing to look any of them in the eye as Ginny was forcefully made to leave by her brothers, and my audience was stood before me. I turned my back to them, steadily lifting the back of my T-shirt so they could see the carnage. Their collective gasp shook my soul. I fucking hate my uncle.
I scrawled the message at the dinner table and hid the journal again. I waited until I got to my dorm room. Waited through Ron's blathering and Hermione's lecturing. Waited t get in my bedclothes and into bed. Then I read his reply.
"Come on Harry, don't tease me like this." Draco moaned, "your mind put those shackles on the bed, if you keep going you can tie me up."
"Can anybody think of a real-life example of this?"
As we said goodnight before bed, she whispered "I don't think you need to worry. Just write as yourself and they'll answer. Relax."
I looked away from him. I hoped for him to give up and just leave, but after what I'd heard it was beyond stupid. He didn't push, he stayed quiet and just let me sit there looking at the rug. The only thing he did was throw his arms up after 10 minutes and sat down in one of the chairs facing me. We were sat in awkward silence for half an hour before I couldn't take it and asked him to leave. He said he'd walk out peacefully and never bother me or talk to me again if that was what I wanted, but not before I gave him the honest reason. He warned me he could tell when I lied, so there was no point saying I didn't want him anymore or some other bullshit.
. I leaned over to kiss his hand and grinned when grey finally met green, reaching out to him. My fingers curled into his hair and we kissed. It seemed a crime to have lips so sweet and soft. I feared if we carried on kissing, I'd quickly become addicted, and take more than I could handle to stay sane. He pulled back and rested his forehead on mine, offering to carry me to my new temporary accommodation. I asked if he was going to stay with me, and he looked slightly uncomfortable. I looked away and everything started to feel a bit awkward. I felt really bad, I hadn't meant to push him to be closer to me. Unless he thought we were talking about... sex, which wasn't what I was thinking.
I was the first one there, taking the opportunity to set down the picnic blanket and wondering what to do or say when he finally showed up. My back was to the mouth of the cave, allowing someone to sneak up on me and loop their fingers under my glasses to cover my eyes. The shock only lasted a second before excitement set in and I giggled. I heard a gentle laugh behind me and felt the familiar warmth spread through my chest.
~o0o~
Sirius hugged me just beside the train. We stood on platform 9 3/4, embraced for everyone to see. Apparently, they'd found Peter Pettigrew when they captured the unconscious Voldemort, so they knew he wasn't killed by Sirius 16 years ago. They knew Sirius was innocent. So, it was okay that we could act like family in public. It all made life so much happier. It was only at night when the problems started, and I was consumed by my nightmares. The nightmares messed with my minds, and they made me feel weak, so I punished myself. It was wrong and unhealthy, I already knew this. But it made me feel better. As my blood oozed from my arm, it seemed to slow my heart and calm me down. The masochist in me enjoyed it, so my nightmares were less of a problem than they used to be.
“Then will you do me the honour of being my husband?” Neville proposed. “Maybe not this month, or even this year, but I want you to be mine. Forever.”
“Well, let’s hit the road bitches,” Sirius grinned.
I blushed and tried not to seem eager by shrugging it off, but I was desperate for any sexual activity between the two of us. And his mouth was bound to feel good. He grinned and took my hand, pulling me against him and telling me to jump. I was confused but did it, and he grabbed my ass so my legs had to wrap around his waist. He kissed me deeply, and I wrapped my arms around his neck to hold him close. He carried me off to my room...our room, and slowly lowered me down on my back. If it weren't for wanting his head lower down, I wouldn't have unlinked my ankles. He removed my robes with magic to avoid how long it would take to do by hand and kissed me again.
"No need for that, not much o' a drinker these days."
“Are you sure it’s not a trap,” she reasoned. “I should come with you.”
Harry didn't even pretend to understand what the beta was saying, so he rushed to the kitchens to collect the rat trap. Hermione asked what he was doing, concern colouring her voice, and without the words to explain he just had to pull her to the gardens by the arm.
And I tried, really tried. But when I drifted off, my mind was back on those lips, and the mystery of who they really belonged to. Not on how they'd feel or anything. Totally not. Man, I need a girlfriend.
“But it can’t be him, it just can’t,” Harry frowned. “I hate him, he’s made my life hell.”
Harry opened the door, noticing the lights were turned off, so he quietly closed the door behind him. Turning back to face the sleeping blonde, he took the time to really look at him, and Merlin he was gorgeous. Harry only wished he could reach out and touch his smooth skin, but that would just wake Draco up. There was no way Harry could be in love with him, but he could tell what he was feeling.
"I don't want to talk about any of that. Not a lot of happy stories." He frowned, and Draco tried not to tighten his hold on the boy's hand. He was already getting territorial over the sweet omega. "I had to sneak out to come here, which isn't very proper, but it was the only way I'd be able to come. My aunt would never be seen next to me."
"I thought roses were to say I love you." Ron grimaced.
Grey eyes, silver from tears, stared up at me as blonde hair was flicked from his face. Draco wiped his eyes and got up on his feet without my help, refusing to look at me. I was just opening my mouth to offer some help or advice when his expression changed. He turned to me threated that if I spoke a word about what I saw to my friends, then he'd rat me out to Dumbledore about what he saw on my wrist when I offered him my hand and my sleeve rode up. He pushed past me as I gaped at his audacity, and left me in the owlery alone. I automatically found Hedwig and gave her a treat I had stowed in my pocket. She nipped at my fingers playfully, and took the letter from me, fluffing her wings as she prepared to fly.
“You’re so hot,” Harry breathed.
I knew he meant it as a joke, but it was sudden, and something I actually wanted to hear. The redness in my cheeks showed him what I was thinking, and I felt the urge to run. But even then, I couldn't escape the embarrassment. I hated being such an open-book. His cool fingers curled under my chin and lifted my head to meet his eyes, which sparkled in the sun. His voice was low and husky when he asked if I wanted him to push his luck, which only made my blushing intensify. I did want that, and I knew he was so attractive, but I'd actually only ever kissed my cousin, and that was forceful and not something I bothered trying to be good at, so what if I was no good at it now.
Harry started to cry again, knowing that now he could never truly rid himself of Draco, but thanked Madam Pomfrey and left for his dorm room, hoping to sleep on the idea of him being a month pregnant, so he could rationally decide what to do on the matter of custody.
"Can you hold yourself up now?"
"That...was...intense."
I woke up in the middle of the night, with Harry cuddled up to my side, and I smiled. For a very long time, I’d wanted to be with Harry, but I’d never thought I’d deserved him. He was gorgeous, smart, brave, and everything I could ever want. I reached out to touch his sweet face, and my left arm caught my eye. I stared in disgust at the Dark Mark staining my skin and put it back down. That’s why I didn’t deserve Harry, he was the Saviour of the Wizarding World, and I was an ex-Death Eater, he deserved better than me.
They looked over the cot at their beautiful babies, their beautiful baby boys. Harry reached down, picking up Aries Orion Malfoy, and stroking his soft face. He rocked him in his arms, Draco bent down to pick up their other little boy, Leo Scorpius Malfoy.
"Because they're my little stars," Draco blushed, stoking Leo's head.
I blushed at the openness of that question. I was acting so bashful, which isn't me at all, and he's relishing my embarrassment. Prick. I demanded he kiss my body, like the night before. I said I wanted to feel his lips worship my body as his fingers opened my hole for him. I turned the heat of my words on him, and he groaned.
"Thank you. If I'm allowed to ask, why GreenLion31? I mean, ClassicGemini was a birthday pun, since that's my sign. Pansy had shown me horoscopes and I thought 'Adaptable, outgoing, intelligent, indecisive and nosy' were traits that fit me pretty well."
“Harry Potter.”
"This never truly felt like home for me, there's not much I have a sentimental attachment to. And they loved this wealth far more than they ever cared for me, so they can keep it and stay out of my life. I have you, my alpha, I need no more than that."
The omega jumped at the unfamiliar voice, turning in shock to the man standing over him. He was huge, far taller and broader than any man Harry had seen before. He had wild, bushy hair that tangled with his fuzzy beard. His eyes could barely be seen and his mouth was hidden in all the hair. If it hadn't been for the neutral beta scent surrounding the giant, Harry would have started to completely panic.
“Yes Sirius, you’ve already said that about fifty times,” Remus growled. “But Lily sounds certain in Snape’s letter, so please honey, shut up and let him finish.”
The last two Gryffindors were sorted, and they remained in Gryffindor. That’s when McGonagall started the feast, and most people were too focused on food to gossip. Harry noticed the Heads of Houses talking to Headmistress McGonagall, and raised an eyebrow at his dad, who winked at him and carried on his convocation.
"As I need new shoes, and we'll need you there to carry them all, servant boy," Dudley sneered.
"Not everyone's getting a happy ending. I already know we aren't, so what's the point? I'm not ignoring you, I'm going back to just not talking to you like before this stupid project."
Dudley was sulking, biting his lip and refusing to look. Pheobe looked almost pleased, but most likely because her brother wasn't marrying a prince. And Petunia, scowl cutting across her face and vein twitching in her forehead, was the picture of anger. It reminded the prince that the estate belonged to Harry's father, and it could be returned to him as his birthright. An omega might not own land, but a prince certainly could. The three fools' faces merged to the same expression. Fear. But his omega shrugged.
Harry explained that it didn’t matter, the problem was over and that they could see he was fine. But they pressed on, saying he sounded worried when he’d called them, so to just tell them. Harry closed his eyes, remembering that morning when he’d woken up with wings sprouting out his back and blood-red eyes. Not the usual look he sported in the bathroom mirror when he woke up.
Harry thought. He slowly unwrapped the present, a sigh breaking through his lips as he held up a red and yellow scarf. He wrapped it around his neck and thanked Ron, well he told him to thank his mum.
“Then tell me who you like, I’ll tell them you need to talk to them tonight, and you have to be happy too.”
There was only one shop Dudley felt comfortable buying things. The tailor measured him, lying that he was losing weight so he'd feel good and charging twice as much as other places because he needed twice the fabric. The whole time his mother would blather about how much he was like his father, 'robust' was the word she liked to use. Hardly, but that was the consequences when she always fed him sweets and meat at the click of his fingers. According to one of the older maids who'd met Uncle Vernon, Dudley acted like his father as well.
His omega chuckled, "but I enjoy your scent so much. And I'm so happy you found me."
"Keep talking like that and I'll really start moving."
I dropped down to sit beside Pansy, probably with the goofiest smile on my face, because she and Blaize were looking at me in confusion. I shrugged, insisting that if they were going to attempt to ask me any questions to do so before the judgemental comments, whilst I was still in a good mood. Blaize just shook his head, ensuring that my crush on Harry was my business, so he was gonna try not to say anything. That's why I was close to Blaize. He knows when not to push me. But Pansy wasn't quite the same.
It surprised him that Dudley couldn't carry his own shoes, then again his body was fat, not muscle mass. Harry had more muscle mass than was expected of an omega, they were usually dainty and delicate. The strongest part should be the hips if he was going to be strong enough to carry babies. But after all the housework that had been forced on him from a young age, he had built up a little muscle in his arms and legs too. Dudley was just fed nonsense whenever he asked, you might think he was already with child. Certainly not the attractive omega his mother always called him.
~o0o~
It was Ron. What was Ron doing here? But Draco was being really defensive, I could only imagine the glare he was throwing his way. And he mentioned Hermione's name, so she must be in my the living room too. But why? I heard her try to coax Ron out, but he must have stayed in place. There was a crash and I fully opened the bedroom door. I saw Ron flat on his back just outside the suite, and Hermione was rushing to him. Draco apologised and closed the door, turning to pause when he saw me.
Harry thought about rejecting the offer but thought it would be better if he knew he could leave the cheating douchebag without having the guilt of separating his child from one of his fathers. So he agreed. Madam Pomfrey waved her hand over his stomach, smiling as she announced he was about a month pregnant.
He’d made peace with Hermione, it wasn’t hard, seeing as we’re so close. But Ron, he still wasn’t happy. Hermione hugged him, and he smiled. She asked what was up, but Harry just shrugged, trying to keep his relationship a secret until Draco was ready. Harry walked over to his table and sat between Draco and Neville.
The lady of the house gushed at him, blathering about how honoured she was to have him in her gardens and wonderful he looked, even after travelling all day. Draco's eyes drifted to the side, wanting to avoid the foolish woman as much as he could, and saw a pair of servants at the side. Based on his clothes, the alpha might have been a footman, and the fuzzy-haired omega beside him was holding a tray of biscuits, allowing the alpha to place his hand on her shoulder. An obvious claiming move. Draco was in no way interested, Harry wasn't a sweet looking maid, but he understood the desire. All he could think of was finding his omega love and pressing open kisses along his neck and wrists so his scent covered the other man. And carrying him off to the castle to keep him safe and loved for the rest of their days.
"Harry, how're you getting along?" Hermione smiled from the top of the stairs.
Neville gaped at Harry, who just comfortably settled down and started to eat. Halfway through dinner, he subtly moved one hand under the table and started to stroke Draco’s leg. Draco’s eyes widened, but he tried not to react as Harry slowly caressed his thighs. As he reached for Draco’s crotch, Draco grabbed his wrist to stop him, and subtly shook his head.
Harry smiled, leaving Draco to carry the huge cauldron, which turned out to be a problem. Harry was very strong, so lifting it wasn’t a problem, the problem was that he didn’t know where he was going. He asked Slughorn where he wanted it and was pushed in the right direction, but that meant he slammed into Draco. They both toppled over, and the Cauldron rolled off into the cupboard.
I waited in my bedroom, laid face down on my bed with my shirt off. He made me wait like he usually did. This happened weekly when I came back for summer, they loved to instil the fact that I was a freak into my head, but that was in place long ago, to the point I don't think it'll ever go away. I was thinking this over when the door opened behind me. I heard his footsteps come closer. The clinking of his belt being undone and removed rang in my ears.
“Oh, you’re definitely my son,” Snape smiled comfortingly. “You see, my father wasn’t a muggle, he was a half demon, and so am I, which means…”
(See the end of the chapter for
The temperate rose too suddenly for Harry to comprehend what was happening. Everything was okay one moment, then it was sweltering and he felt like he needed Draco to hold him or he'd collapse. Whatever was in that vial didn't waste any time. And this heat felt so much worse than before, especially when the first cramp started and Harry toppled over on all fours.
She looked down to the stack of papers on her desk and I guessed I was dismissed. I picked up my box and left without another word. Looked like I'd tried harder with my gift after all. Malfoy wasn't taking this seriously, and Hermione made me. Where's the fairness there? I should have listened to Ron. Get him a little chocolate bar with a small place card that just said, "Sorry, not sorry". Would have been about what he deserved.
"So you want me to tell you how this feels, how much your big dick stretches me out, and how good it is?"
There was silence in the room as Harry and Snape stared at each other, neither one of them saying anything. Snape looked at Harry, really looked at him, and his mind wondered as he looked at his son, his flesh and blood. He smiled at Harry, who looked at him in shock. He’d never seen Snape with emotion on his face, it was usually impassive and plain, a spy hiding his thoughts.
“Of course I do,” Snape smiled, patting Harry’s shoulder.
"Are you done? How dare you call him 'damaged goods', he's broken and bruised in places, he's fragile, but don't you speak like that lowers his worth. I'm not burdening myself with him, and I'm not going to knock him lower or leave him to shatter in the dust like a shitbag. You hate him, so you're throwing out all this shit that you don't even know about to sway me away, but I know more about him that you do. He's got money, he doesn't need mine, and just as good-looking as I am, maybe more, so he could do better than me too. I want to fix him, I want to help him. I've loved him year Sev, taking my loneliness out on him because then he gave me attention. He only ever said harsh words, but those words were mine, they were aimed to make my feel, even if those feelings were negative. If he wants my money, he can marry me for it, I'll take him. So while I'd like your acceptance as my godfather, I don't need it as much as I need him."
“You scared the shit out of me earlier,” Draco frowned. “Snape’s acting like it’s my fault, is it?”
"Do you want to talk about it?" She whispered, but I shook my head. "I could distract you."
"And," he smirked, settling behind Harry, pressing his bare front to his omega's back. "Been slick and loose from heat means I can slide right in."
It's 2:18 am, I can't be asked to proof-read this. Sorry for the mistakes, I might correct it someday lol. ╮ (. ❛ ᴗ ❛.) ╭
He reached for the top book before it was scooped from the pile by a pale hand. Harry needed to breathe before he could bring himself to turn around, facing the blonde antagonist perched on a bookshelf behind him. A smirk pulled at Malfoy's lips as his dainty fingers turned the pages, and it took all the self-control Harry had to contain his anger and not punch the smug prick. He just carried the books off further down the aisle and continued his task. As impossible as it sounds, when the blonde spoke again, his voice was even smugger when he offered his assistance the second time. It snapped Harry's resolve hard, and he turned around to give the prat a piece of his mind. They were closer to each other than they'd first thought, and as Harry turned, his chest came into contact with Malfoy's. Harry immediately looked up to meet his eyes, almost instinctively. It was strange how he'd spent six years with the other boy, yet Harry was only seeing the molten silver in his eyes now. Malfoy seriously didn't have a single facial flaw, no freckles or blemishes, just flawless marble skin. And his lips looked so soft, with the sexiest curve.
"I can't wait to get this baby out of me," Harry smiled. "It's not so fun with the sore boobs, the cravings and the kicking."
He rolled his eyes, "of course I'm still here idiot."
. I turned back to Hermione with a fake smile and her eyes were wide and apologetic, even though we both knew it wasn't her fault. I was trying to console her when a hand on my shoulder dragged me back, slamming my back onto the floor before a heavy weight settled over me. Ron's fist flew for my face, and I tried to deflect it with my arms, but it broke through and hit my jaw. The metallic taste of blood coated the tip of my tongue. I've either bit my lip or my tongue, but the pain's so general I can't tell where it's coming from. His fist flies down again and I'm socked on the other side of my face, barely catching his fist to prevent the third punch. It feels like I'm trying to wrestle him off for hours, though logically it's only seconds, then all of sudden Ron is flung off me by a spell. He was in a full-body bind. I looked around the room, and most of the teachers had their wands in their hands at their sides. The only wand pointed in my direction was in the hand of my boyfriend, and he was rushing towards me.
He didn't speak for very long, just he welcomed Professor Lupin back to the DADA position, and the Sorting Ceremony didn't drag either. The food appeared before my eyes and I was famished. I went for dinner first, because Hermione was staring me down. I had to eat a plate of dinner before I could destroy the treacle tarts. I piled it up, so she couldn't moan and seen as I knew where the kitchen was, I could always pinch some tart later. I saw Lavender giggling with Parvati, and looking my way. It made Hermione roll her eyes.
Harry nodded. He couldn’t guarantee anything, but he wasn’t stupid enough to say that. He needed to know what Malfoy knew, so he played it like a Slytherin, he kept his mouth shut and listened.
Harry laughed, thinking why Malfoy had sent the owl in the first place. As far as Harry knew, they still hated each other, so why would Malfoy waste his time and money buying Harry a present. Harry was in deep thought for the duration of the train ride, but that didn’t matter to Ron and Hermione, seen as they were too wrapped up in each other to notice Harry’s silence.
I shook as I headed to Professor Snape’s office, wondering what I’d done to make him want to see me. I frowned as I relived the day in my head, and I remembered he caught me staring at him, well his butt anyway. I couldn’t explain what had happened in fourth year, but since then I’ve been looking at my professor a lot more, and not just his face. When I got to the door, I knocked gently and stood there as Snape opened it.
"Yer got many friends 'ere. And I's happen to be 'ere to get you pretty as a picture for this ball."
Molly's voice rang tense, but responsible, "Sirius, don't do something you'll regret. You've just got cleared."
"If you could now write down your alias name on these strips of paper," Benylin waved her wand and paper appeared in front of everyone. "Then I'll collect them for the draw and prepare your books for the end of the class."
Ron nodded, agreeing with Harry’s solution reluctantly, and Hermione gave him a hug. She told him that everything would work out, and that if Draco didn’t come around then maybe he wasn’t really Harry’s soulmate. But Harry refused to give Draco the chance, it would have been fine if Draco had said they shouldn’t be together before they had sex, but he didn’t. He used Harry, took Harry’s virginity, and made Harry think he loved him, Harry couldn’t forgive him for that. And he wouldn’t.
The sheer number of people at the reception stunned Harry. It didn't seem like Draco knew many of them, but that seemed to be the way with his parties, it had been that way on the alpha's birthday. But it also provided a simple excuse for Draco to cut their partying short and retire to their room. He smiled that with the sheltered life his omega had before they met, he could not be expected to spend a full evening with a ballroom full of noise and strangers. In truth, Harry knew he'd be able to handle the whole evening if he stubbornly willed himself to, but realised this was the excuse they both needed to finally spend longer than five minutes together for once since Draco found Harry.
A long finger curled under my chin, turning my head to face him, exposing the huge hickey on the side of my neck. People paying enough attention to notice gasped, and Hermione started fanning herself and whispering to the other girls. He pressed his lips to mine, and I almost melted into them, except he pulled away too soon. I curved my hand to the back of his head, pulling his lips back to mine eagerly. His chuckle rippled through his chest, a sweet sound, and he pulled back with a smirk. He leant down to kiss the love bite on my neck before backing up heading over to his table, holding onto my hand until his arms weren't long enough and it slipped from his grip.
"What have you got there?"
"I don't know where that came from, but put it fucking back." I glared, "First off, I didn't make you fight with me, you chose to because you're a good friend, Hermione too. You might not like my relationship, but don't dump her in with you when we both know she's too giddy and girly over the idea to be mad. He only became our enemy when we were rude to him on the train in first year, which funnily enough was something you started by laughing at him. Your family and his hate each other, your dad is as rude to his dad as you are to him, and vice versa. And again, Hermione's not the problem right now, so bringing her into it doesn't help your point. And so what if he said some cruel things to me, cos I can bet I said things just as bad, we've been at each others' necks for years. Which might have just been sexual tension. I can kiss him because he's surprisingly tender, and so sweet to me now. If you'd have heard how he spoke to me before we came in here, you'd understand why I can look past how he treated me. Don't even try to make it about you, because this isn't your decision. So put your bad attitude away and shut up, or stick it up your ass and don't talk to me, because if you're really my friend, you'd stand by me and pick up the pieces if this goes sour, like Hermione is now."
Draco's chuckling stopped, and Harry felt a twitch inside him that he wanted to squirm around. But that would hurt his alpha, so he tried to stay still while he groaned.
“See you later son,” Severus grinned.
“To see Professor Slughorn for some potions,” Snape sneered. “Now do as you are told, sit with him.”
"Get out of here. Granger get him out of here." He growled, "I'm not letting you anywhere near him after how you've treated him."
"Well, you probably want to know all you can concerning the…You-Know-Who thing, and I want to ask about those cuts. So, who's asking the first question?"
Hagrid didn't seem fazed by Hermione's presence, he just grinned at the cage and took it away to the front of the pumpkin carriage. Hermione started tugging his arm, but he shrugged. He didn't understand what was happening any better than she did, so he couldn't answer any questions she had.
Until they heard yelling from Sirius downstairs, “What the fuck is that wanker doing here?”
“Look, I know what you’re thinking, but I promise you it’s not what happened. Me and Theo used to have a thing, but that was years ago before I fell in love with you. He said he’d been waiting to get me on my own, so he could convince me that we weren’t right together and that I should be with him.” Draco frowned. “He kissed me, but I tried to push him away. I swear, I’d never hurt you like that. Please believe me.”
"What were the Potter family colours again?" Pheobe asked while Dudley was measured.
"You look beautiful by the way," Harry smiled.
Dudley's face went pink, the usual colour he went when he was offended by something. Usually the buttons on old clothes not going up. Aunt Petunia stepped in, reminding them that heat can shrink. She had already drawn up a plan to fool the prince's men. They know they're looking for an omega male, so Dudley was right that it couldn't be Pheobe. And she was also right that Dudley's fingers were a little wide. So she was going to put Dudley's hands in hot water, and keep them there until the royal guard started up the hill. They were the first house they'd come to, to they'd need the extra time to prepare the garden.
He wrapped his arms around my neck and pulled me down to kiss me, caressing my neck, jaw and lips with kisses. I was panting for breath, asking why he wasn’t confused and ready to leave me to take the responsibility.
"While I'm aware she isn't the omega you're looking for, this is my beta daughter Pheobe." The lady gushed, as a petite but unattractive young girl curtsied. The prince just tipped his head in acknowledgement.
His eyes narrowed, chilling my blood. "After everything we've been through together, all the fighting for our lives and shit that you brought on us, how could you do this to 'Mione and me? I don't give a rats ass about you being gay, you know that Harry, but why would you turn to him? Of all people? Someone who hates us, and has done nothing but pick on us since he first set eyes on us? Are you forgetting all the shit he's said to me, and the shit about my family? What about all the times he's bullied Hermione and called her a Mudblood? Or the times he's made fun of you for being an orphan? How can you kiss him?"
Draco smiled down at him, explaining that he’d passed out, and had been unconscious for about half an hour. Harry turned away from Draco, wanting him to piss off. Harry tried to pull his hand away, but Draco wouldn’t let him and caught his attention. When Harry turned back to him, Draco pulled him into a kiss, but Harry pushed him away.
“Here you go Harry,” Hermione smiled, handing Harry the parcel in her hands.
." Harry cried, trying to follow the movement back, but hips being restrained in his alpha's grip.
The three nobles started shaking their heads. Though Dudley looked decidedly shifty. Before Draco could convince himself it was rude to speak out and ask if they were sure, the alpha servant from before spoke up. He reminded the lady of the house that she did have a male omega servant in the kitchens, though she might have forgotten because they hadn't yet been served breakfast.
"Oh, shut up Harry." I flushed. "Wrong direction. Just go to sleep."
Harry smiled, he’d always thought Draco was an arrogant, stubborn asshole, and he can be but he’s also sweet, and caring and beyond loving. Harry couldn’t believe they’d been together for 7 months, even though Draco hadn’t actually told his parents. He wrote to them frequently, well his mother anyway, but never mentioned Harry. At first, Harry was worried about whether that meant Draco wasn’t really committed to him, that was until Draco made their relationship public. Now Harry didn’t mind, and he was actually trying to get Mrs Malfoy out of Azkaban early.
"I understand, Harry. Keep scenting me, my love, I'll carry you to the bed. It's gonna be okay."
I heard the barely unsuppressed laugh from my boyfriend, and my godfather's cheek moved into a smile. Well, at least it looked like they were getting along. I wondered if Draco had told them anything. Part of me would be tremendously pissed if he had, to betray my trust when he was supposed to keep it a secret. But if he'd told them, I wouldn't have to, and I'd hate to see their faces when I tried to explain what we both knew I didn't fully understand myself. It would be easier on me for them to hear it from him, even if it wasn't easier for them.
“It’s not your fault, it’s mine,” Harry blushed. “I hadn’t even looked at another guy until I came back to school and saw you.”
~o0o~
"You are sure? This is not just a moment of lust, perhaps. This is the one you choose?" Lucius interrogated.
“So Neville, what did Professor Snape want to see you about?” Harry winked.
Just for the inside scoop as readers and no characters. The next chapter is called 'All Kinds of Revelations'.  ;)
. I turned to my table and saw the green shade on Ron's face, his eyes flicking to the mark on my neck. It seems Draco knows just how to make me happy, something I'd never felt possible.
Harry rolled his eyes to the Heavens, praying for divine intervention. At that moment, Seamus headed towards the Slytherins and fell flat on his face. The eighth years burst out laughing, and Harry walked over to help Seamus up, with a huge grin covering his face.
"And clean up the mess you made," Dudley smirked.
I let go and he flipped around. He settled between my thighs, but I could see him hesitating.
"They pride themselves on being ordinary, my uncle sells drills or something and my aunt is a housewife and my cousin's a secret pervert who used to force me to kiss him in private, but I was the freak who reminded them there was another world out there, so they treated me like a freak. I actually didn't know my name until primary school because they never used it, I was 'Freak' or 'Boy' to them. For the first 11 years of my life, my bedroom was a little cupboard under the stairs, with locks on the outside so I couldn't sneak out to the kitchen if they punished me by starving me for a few days. That why I was so scrawny and short for the first couple of years here. They beat me, and neglected me, and psychologically damaged me. They're pretty shitty people, but I'll never have to see them again now that Dumbledore's actually seen what they've been doing to me. I'm living with Sirius now."
“Maybe, I caught them staring at my ass the whole of sixth year. But that’s not the point,” Severus smiled. “Just go back to your dorm, and if you’re sure you don’t love him by the morning, then fine. But if you’re mind hasn’t changed, and you still feel for him, you can come to see me a lunch tomorrow, I’ll be in here.”
"Sev asked me to help him, find some way to get the potion to Him. So, I waited until He was alone, and told him what aunt Bella had said to mother. He looked furious until I said I'd accept the Mark, accept him. I poured two glasses of Firewhiskey but knew he was watching me, so I couldn't add the potion. To skip to the end, I told him it was something for male potency and he drank it down pretty quickly. He passed out on me, and I need my mother's help to get him off."
I was stunned. I hadn't suspected the depth of his feelings, and they seemed to heal my soul slightly. The kind of feel I get when he kisses me, or smiles just for me. But I was frightened. I didn't think I was quite at that point, I was falling but I hadn't fallen. And I knew I didn't deserve him, so how was I supposed to deal with this. Snape's opinion of me was right, not the stuff about being a money grabber and that, but that I was a burden.
Harry knocked on the door of Snape’s office and waited for a response. After a while, Snape came to the door and invited Harry in. His expression was full of concern, but he waited patiently of Harry to get comfortable in his surroundings and open up to his dad. Harry took a deep steady breath and tried to relax. He turned to his father and explained why he’d come. He mentioned how he was thinking of Malfoy, and that when he made him smile, it was like Harry had sparked a light in himself.
Harry looked into Draco’s eyes, and Draco just leaned down to kiss the start of a red mark on Harry’s face. When they looked back to Theo, they could see the hatred in his eyes for Harry, and he stepped forward for round two. But Draco wasn’t gonna let that happen, as he stood protectively in front of Harry, glaring down at Nott.
Draco laughed, "Next comes the constant crying, the lack of sleep and the sexless marriage."
His eyes were closed tight, lips parted with the bottom one quivering. His face was pure pleasure. He opened his eyes, and I could see how good it was for him. I wanted to make him tense, so I asked if he was making that face because I was really tight around him. He closed his eyes, shivering a little. He told me to keep talking, that my dirty talk was turning him on. I didn't know what to say. He started to pull out and sink back in slowly. It hurt more, but I also felt good, there was more movement against that nice point.
“Just so you know, my bedroom’s joined to my office,” Snape smirked. “Just through that door.”
The door opened, and Neville came in grinning, strutting right up to me to plant a big kiss on my lips. His lips were so warm, so soft. His cheerful smile faded with concern as he saw the worry on my face. He asked me what I was worried about, and I smiled at how easy it was for him to read my emotions, like an open book.
"Children! This is important, very important. Mrs Malkins went into town this morning, and there was another royal announcement. The prince is looking for his mystery omega. He's searching the town for him, going to all the houses and shops. Apparently, a ring was left behind, so they're trying it on people."
The dimming light made him blink, focusing back on the present as the sun disappeared behind the castle. It sat as peaceful as always on its hill, high above all the homes in town. But it wouldn't be peaceful today. Today was the prince's birthday, he was turning 17. The age most alphas started looking for a partner. It would be havoc trying to clean and prepare for that. Not that the prince would do any of it. What it must be like to be a prince.
He nodded, positioning himself under me. He went slow and didn't stop until he bottomed out, then let me get used to him. There was a slickness that made it easier, so something happened without me noticing. It stung a little and felt strange. But I know moving makes it better. I asked him to move. He only rolled his hips so there was minimum movement. It stung slightly, was just sort of uncomfortable. But it didn't look that way to him.
Draco stripped Harry’s clothes off too, and when they were both standing there in their underwear, Draco asked Harry if he was sure he wanted to go through with sex, seen as Draco didn’t mind, but Harry nodded and removed his boxers, so Draco did the same. They kissed each other again, and Draco lightly pushed Harry back on the bed and crawled between his legs. Harry smiled up at him, positive that as long as Draco was happy, then Harry would do anything.
I stood there in shock. Was he being civil? No, he was being friendly. It was really strange and completely unusual, but I did kind of like it. Maybe that friendship wasn't as far away as I thought. I carried on down the passage until I saw Hermione's head sticking out the doorway. She beckoned me in, and she and Ron were giggling about something. She explained how she'd heard Cho Chang talking about asking Malfoy out, except she used his first name. Hermione called him Draco. We were moving forward with him apparently.
Instantly, Hermione's hand shot up into the air. "The house system makes this. Before you're sorted, you want a house. Then you identify with the house once you're put into it. And to get house points you compare your house with the other three. You look at them to fail so you may succeed."
“Thought you’d never ask,” Harry grinned.
Harry could tell she’d got him a book, it wasn’t hard to guess from the shape and hardcover, and because Hermione always bought him a book. It was her way of keeping him smart. Harry opened it with a smile on his face, loving the normality of the presents, it was the only thing that was still normal for him these days. He looked at the book “
Sirius left with a wink, embarrassing me like the perfect father figure. I made to move out of bed, but a firm hand settled on my shoulder, keeping me where I was. I looked over to see Draco biting his lip, avoiding my eyes, and worrying about something. I placed my hand over his, trying for a supportive smile. I told him whatever he was holding back wasn't worth the worry, and I'd try not to react badly. I wanted as much open honesty from him as I'd given him about this.
. He'd only had it once at Christmas, but his dad enjoyed having Baileys in his coffee at dinner parties. Neville wouldn't own up, and neither would I. Just in case any of them were my soon-to-be pen pal.
All the things he said, it was like in my nightmare. He could actually leave me because I was trying to be sentimental and make it special when I said I loved him. And he's not sentimental, I've learnt that at least over our time together. I should have said it last night. But I'll see him in class, so I'll be able to tell him then. I can fix this, cure his insecurities and we'll get past this. His outburst doesn't need to be too big a crack in our relationship. I can fix it. I have to fix it.
“That has to be it,” Harry mumbled.
He clung to me and I gripped him back. We wouldn't spend as much time together when Dumbledore gets back, but what would that actually change for us? Nothing. There'll be bumps, every relationship has bumps, but we'll get through them. I wasn't worried, and I think his insecurities were covered now. So that was it. Nobody can know everything, but I can believe that we'll work. I can hope for the idyllic 'together since we were young' life together. Maybe we will be, maybe we won't. Nobody can no everything about what will be.
I felt like an ass for saying it, but she huffed and left to have her lunch in the Great Hall. I kept going until I reached the kitchens, finding a cute picnic basket with red ribbons and flowers in Slytherin colours. Dobby was giving me major brownies points on this date. He gushed as he saw me, pleading for attention and panicking it wasn't good enough when I was too stunned to answer. But I was so happy with him I actually hugged him and Winky, thanking them and apologising I didn't have time to talk.
“Of course he did,” Snape rolled his eyes. “Come on in, we have to talk.”
For those wanting the traditional Cinderella story, you can stop reading now. For those who saw the Explicit tag and thought yummy, keep reading. The last chapter is literally a fluffy, short wedding and reception, then lots of smutty bonding stuff. But I've never written bonding smut, so don't expect too much.
"Oh, I'm sorry, I can't-"
He bit his lip and closed his eyes, and when he opened them they held this lust that started getting me hard without him even touching me. He asked how I wanted dessert, but in all honesty, I wouldn't know. He came around the table to straddle my lap and kiss me. I was truly addicted to him kissing me. But I knew he wanted more than that, and I did too for that matter.
"What would you like for breakfast?"
"You took the time to make it, I'll love it regardless."
"I could say the same to you. And doubt there is enough time for both tonight."
Harry nodded, smiling brightly as he thought of how normal his life was becoming, as he stood on the platform saying goodbye to his dad. He took the note out of his pocket, explaining the whole situation to his dad as he passed him the parchment, asking if he knew who sent it. Severus scanned the note, chuckled and handed it back.
I licked along the side, over a vein that pulsed out. He made no noise, but his lips tightened. I licked again. And again. When I felt brave enough to suck the tip, he moaned. The vibrations of his throat and tongue were stimulating, and I doubled my effort on his dick so he'd moan more on mine. Which worked for the most part. Then he stopped the rubbing and started pushing his finger inside me. My moan must have given him the same pleasure because he groaned back.
"If you want me to actually fuck you, I'd suggest you stop sucking, or I'll blow it in your mouth before we actually start."
"He's wearing the prince's colours!"
“Hey, ummm….” Harry mumbled. “This morning was a little strange, I woke up…different.”
"We are learning about psychology. The question was slightly different, but it stems down to social psychology."
"Or it's an alpha thing. I know sometimes it's hard to keep my hands to myself with 'Mione around, must be really hard on him after you ran off. I'd imagine the planning is distracting him so he doesn't drag you off and bond with you. If you know what I mean."
He felt embarrassed that he'd believed his cruel aunt. He had rushed to get everything done, let himself live in the fantasy of going to the ball and finding a lovely alpha to take him away from his horrible relatives. He had fallen like a fool for her trick, and the tears wouldn't stop.
Then my hand was empty. Half a dozen wands clattered to the floor and rolled into each other. Professor Benylin frowned down at us, dealing punishment to Draco and me as ringleaders projecting bad behaviour. We were to write apology notes to each other, and offer a gift as a symbol of peace for the coming year. Something we thought they’d enjoy, without malice or sarcasm.
“What do you mean,” Harry asked. “What have I done?”
"Ready to go kiddo," Sirius asked from the door.
Harry gaped at him, wondering what had possessed Malfoy to send him any sort of gift for his birthday. But for some reason Harry couldn’t place, he got shivers as he thought of Draco. He hugged his father goodbye, even though he knew he’d see him at school anyway, and everyone on the whole of Platform 9 3/4 stared at them.
"Why the fuck did you do that?" I scowled, "he was probably coming to apologise and makeup, he had Hermione with him."
The prince drops to his knee, grinning up into surprised green eyes. "I knew I would find you, no matter how long I had to look. My Harry, please do me the honour of being mine?"
There was a living space, with a couch and chairs facing a fireplace, and a dining table with 4 dining chairs. Through a little window I could see a kitchen, and wondered why Dumbledore would put me somewhere with so much space I wouldn't use. Everything was quite minimal in colour, mostly black and grey, only the couch and rug by the fire were coloured. Green, of course.
And that's when he saw a couple of rabbits bounce passed the window. The driver had turned back. Harry just had to take a deep breath and roll out of the door, letting the shrinking pumpkin wheel itself over a group of mice and smash against a tree. Harry caught his breath, rubbing his grazes and trying to call the mice closer. He cradled all the little furries in his arms and thanked them for taking him out to the best night of his life. He wouldn't marry the prince, Draco would be forced into marrying someone more of his station. But the omega would always have his memories. He felt a mouse squirm and pull something from his neck.
"But I don't love you, I haven't been pining for years. How can you be okay with that?"
His father used to own this house with his mother. They were both alphas but didn't seem to care what the world thought of them. Their love outshined everything, and with it they made Harry. But Lily couldn't handle the birth, alpha bodies aren't exactly made for it, and she died. After that, his aunt and cousins came calling. Uncle Vernon had been killed, boasting to a stronger alpha and paid the price for it. Aunt Petunia and Lily had hated each other, but James couldn't turn them away. It wasn't safe for a beta mother leading her young beta daughter and infant omega son. As soon as he died, Harry was never told how, his aunt had taken control. Omegas couldn't inherit property, and he was only 3 years old when it happened. Too young to even try to fight it.
Draco Malfoy stood looking to the side, bottom lip caught between his teeth in obvious tension. I rubbed my eyes to make sure I wasn't wrong, but the image before me didn't change. I wasn't mad, I was furious. Nothing about my Gemini matched the boy in front of me, making this either a mistake that meant the real Gemini was still coming, or the last few weeks had been a lie. And I wasn't sure which I thought was worse.
It was laying on my desk for 18 years. The neat script on the envelope scaring me as soon as it was delivered, I'd refused to open it out of anger and then grief. But the war was over. The Dark Lord was destroyed and the Potters had been avenged. It was time for me to get over my issues with Lily, and read the letter that may have been her goodbye to me. I still owed her that.
I woke up. I was crying, and I wriggled out to find Draco so he could hold me. But he wasn't there. I sat to look, but he wasn't in the room. I felt frozen, numb. Even my tears stopped running as I thought I'd lost him. I tried to kick him out, but he'd taken that out by running off when I was sleeping. I'd felt pain, and panic, even loneliness. But now I felt empty, almost as if I was missing something. It was so much worse than feeling hurt. I reached to the side for my wand and pressed the tip to my arm. Then the door opened.
Professor Benylin let me into her office, but Malfoy wasn't there as I'd expected. Instead, she simply placed a large box with a card on her desk and asked for my apology. I handed over the box of chocolates and letter. It wasn't a small box, or just a collection box of chocolates, Hermione wouldn't let me be petty when I was apologising. It was like a hamper, without being in a hamper basket. It was an average-sized box filled with one of each kind of sweets from Honeydukes. ClassicGemini hadn't mentioned a favourite, so I just got everything. My box was bigger than his.
We trod out of the carriages and up the stairs to Hogwarts. Cho was googling Malfoy like he was water in her oasis, and I don't understand why it bothered me. I noticed him look up at her and gesture her to the side, far enough away for no one to hear them. Hermione and Ron seemed interested as well, and the three of us walked slowly so we could watch them talking, well watch the blonde talking. And whatever he said, she wasn't happy about it.
As the silly decorated wig was settled on his head, Petunia started calling for her darling Duddikins. He shoved past Harry, knocking him to the floor with his shoulder as he strutted from the room. Harry would have been angry if he hadn't felt the floor vibrate under his ass as Dudley stepped. Instead, he just tried not to laugh.
His sweet omega grinned, pretending to think as he squeezed Draco's hand, "I will bond with you on one condition. I will be bringing Hermione and Ron with me. They have been my only support through the years, I can't leave them here with these people."
"What fucking right do you have to say who he can and can't see?"
~o0o~
It didn't work out how he'd planned it. The point of shifting his ball into a masquerade was the hope that people wouldn't recognise him. He wanted an omega to act themselves around him, to be natural, not to behave how they thought he wanted them to. Or how they thought the bride of a prince should behave. But something had given him away, be it his real hair styled up or the family colours of his frock coats. But most people saw the truth and wouldn't leave him alone. He couldn't get a moment to himself before someone was coming and asking him to dance. It was terribly boring.
The idea sounded too good to be true but excited Harry nonetheless. He nodded as they walked off, his cousins complaining as his mother brushed the idea off. It was a trap or a trick, but there was a chance he could do this. He had more of the house cleaned than they knew, Hermione had started when he had to go into town. And Dudley would be easy to get ready, Harry had had to help him enough times before. It was his clothes that posed the biggest problem, but even that could be fixed, he was sure. This was his chance, his friends would help him. Now maybe there'd be someone else in the house that was happy.
"I didn't get your name," he smiled.
"Sounds like a nightmare to me."
"What do you mean mate? What have I done to you?"
It made Harry shiver slightly.
"You need not apologise, you were right. I felt you were going to decline, but I was too determined to dance with you. I'm used to things going my way, I'm not used to people saying no to me. I'm glad you spoke up. In fact, I'd rather you forget what you just heard and forget I'm a prince. I want you to be yourself, to act natural with me."
Harry thought. He didn’t know if he liked Snape yet, but the look on his face showed there was more to him than Harry knew. Harry nodded, after all, if Snape was his biological father, he was going to act like it. Snape relaxed, asking Harry if he wanted to spend some time together, just an hour or two, so they could talk things over. Harry nodded, insisting he got dressed first because it wasn’t natural for wizards to walk around in their PJ bottoms.
"Well, we need to talk to Dumbledore, so you might want to take these off me." Harry gestured, "we can always come back and pick this up after."
Hermione was very tense as he walked towards the kitchens, "I don't like it. You should just wait, or it'll encourage Ron to do the same."
“Harry Potter,” Slughorn smiled. “Could you put my Demonstration Cauldron away, thank you, my boy.”
"No, I'm not," Leo shouted.
When Benylin walked in, charms jangling on her wrists and skirts, I was about ready to rush her to start already. But she took her time, slowly introducing the topic of love and relationships, a worthy topic after multiple students had approached her to question things. This was the part I already knew, and I was trying not to show I had any idea what she might be going on about. Poor Neville blushed two seats down from me, not hiding his involvement well. Luckily, nobody paid attention to Neville too much, so it wasn't likely someone noticed.
My heated face must have tipped him off, and his face twisted as he tried not to laugh. A couple of giggles escaped as he asked what my dream was about, more specifically who. I thought about telling him, but then realised I'd die of embarrassment, so held my tongue. Draco's eyes narrowed, and he moved towards me like a predator, repeating the question slowly as he backed me into a corner. I still refused, even as his face was an inch from mine.
"Think about it Ron, you ruined the Yule Ball for me because you were jealous I didn't go with you after you'd been developing feelings for me. Draco's had these feelings for years, and when Harry learned the depth of them, he didn't say he loved him back. That would bother anyone. I think his problem is that Harry has problems, so he doesn't want to talk about it and upset him. He bottles up his feelings, so this little thing pushed him over the edge. Ron came and bugged him, he felt guilty for the pushing, then Harry has a go at him when he thought he was doing the right thing so he's guilty and confused and probably ashamed. It was too much, so it's hard to say how long this will last without an apology from Harry."
"While I'm sure you'd love to thank me and all, you's better get in that carriage and go. Yer already late."
"I'm sorry, Harry. You know Ron. His mouth runs away from him."
One of his knees pushed between my legs and his thigh ground into my groin. I whimpered, and his smile widened, feeling my area was still hard from my dream. It went away as quickly as it came, and he eyed me expectantly. I nodded, but no words came out when I tried talking. He chastely kissed my cheek, and the words slurred out.
"How did you know about these things? Like the heat-inducing medicine, or being locked together now?" His alpha stroked the bruising bond mark on Harry's neck, chuckling as he purred. "Who have you been talking to, my naughty little thing?"
My hands shook as I reread the letter. I stared at Lily’s elegant script, but couldn’t wrap my head around the words. It didn’t make sense, none of it made sense. He looked so much like James, he had to be his son, so there was no other possibility. James' face with Lily's eyes, everyone had said it. Then why did Lily sound so sure in her letter, so sure that James couldn’t have kids? It was all just too crazy. Harry couldn’t be my son, it was biologically impossible.
As Harry moved away with a nervous smile, a second alpha appeared at his side, just as old as the first. Fathers of young ladies or omegas, having to accompany them and looking for something entertaining while they waited for their children to capture the prince's attention. It seemed they believed Harry was that entertainment. The omega moved away politely, a gentle smile on his lips and trying to excuse himself from the men.
Dudley's face contorted with rage, and his hands clenched into fists. I knew that if Uncle Vernon hadn't started yelling me down, I'd definitely have a broken bone or two. As I left the room and went down the stairs, I reminded myself for the millionth time to learn to do a proper Episkey for when he does hit me. Aunt Petunia was in the kitchen starting her husband's breakfast, and I relieved her of breakfast duty. My uncle assured me that I was getting a punishment later when they got back from the cinema to see a film with Dudley before he left for another school year. He also warned that if any of my tasks were left undone, I'd be punished for them as well. Determination ran through me. Hogwarts started in a week, which meant that the Weasley's were picking me up tonight, so if I was hurt too bad then they'd notice. And this was definitely not something I wanted to discuss with them. Though he punished me anyway, putting a cigarette out on the back of my hand when I set down his breakfast. I didn't give him the satisfaction of screaming.
Ron wasn't taking it seriously at all. He came out of his stall, laughing that he'd already sent a message through to his mysterious pen pal. He hadn't said his name but wrote something stupid about being on a blind date with whoever would answer. Hermione was less than pleased with Ron using the project to pick up a girlfriend. I couldn't be certain whether it was jealousy or her overwhelming need to make us take lessons more seriously. But all her nagging was directed at Ron, so I was kinda happy with the peace. My mind was unsettled enough without her adding to it.
"I'm happy I found you too, my Harry." Draco smiled, "but we need to get to the castle. So I can get you settled and plan the wedding as soon as possible."
None of us had recovered when we left the room, the puss covered girl bits scared and seared to my eyelids. I couldn't escape the images when I blinked. A group of Slytherins were laughing in front of us as we headed to lunch, a pointless exercise as I couldn't even hope to eat. Crabbe looked back to see us and sneered at me.
He shrugged, going on about time. He didn't love me when he first set eyes on me, he thought I was a scrawny peasant. But over time, he saw deeper and noticed more, and loved everything he knew and came to know. So he didn't care if I hadn't fallen madly in love after a month or so, I was being more genuine than that. When I did feel like I was in love with him he'd be ecstatic, but he didn't need it from me. He just wanted my interest romantically and my loyalty. Not too much to ask.
Ron and Hermione sat down on the end of Harry’s bed, looking at him anxiously with his birthday presents in their laps. Harry smiled at them, reaching out to take his presents off them. Ron handed him a small rectangular parcel that was flexible like clothing.
“You’ve got something there,” Harry smiled.
Madam Pomfrey nodded and asked Harry to try and relax so that she could do a brief detection spell. Harry relaxed as best he could, given his current situation, and it didn’t take long to get a result. Madam Pomfrey smiled, announcing that the result was negative, so Harry wasn’t pregnant. Harry breathed out, not realising his breath had been held, and his muscles felt weak. He thanked Madam Pomfrey for wasting her time to help him and left the Hospital Wing. He thought about turning up late to his next lesson, but thought it would be better to get some rest, he was way too stressed.
"I'm sorry, he's like that sometimes," Harry blushed, lifting up the mannequin.
I was sprung from my nightmare by my cousin dragging me out of bed by my hair. The pain was sharp, but not too strong. I'd had worse. He kicked me while I was on the floor, ordering me downstairs where my uncle was waiting for his breakfast, 15 minutes later than it was meant to be. I struggled up while he leered over me, and questioned if he was there to escort me down or something. He shook his head before he pulled me up and made me face him. I could tell what he was about to do, so when his face went towards mine I turned away. He tried to force my face towards him, kissing the side of my jaw. I shoved him away, the manual labour from gardening and cleaning giving me the muscle to actually move him, even if only a little.
"I'll kill them," Sirius growled. "I will fucking kill them for this!"
"Bad dream, and you weren't in bed so I'd thought you'd left me. But I'm okay now. You're still here."
“Not here,” Draco smiled.
"I can't tell you who, but I know someone who's caught feelings for their pen pal," I whispered. Her eyes shot to Ron before I remedied her suspicion. "Not Ron. But it is a he, and his pen pal is a he. He was asking about whether two guys could be together."
Before Harry could finish refusing, the alpha had taken him by the elbow and begun pulling him to where everyone else was dancing. Harry tensed, looking to the side for the garden doors. He pulled, the grip on his arm not tight enough to hold him. He paced out to the gardens, avoiding the eyes of anyone looking at him as he quicked his pace to a run to get as far away as he could.
"Well, Severus had the idea for a potion strong enough to put him in this kind of coma, one that's really hard to wake up from, but he didn't know how he could spike his food or drink. Seen as he's as paranoid as Alastor Moody." He explained, "but then he heard an argument between my mother and aunt Bella, over how You-Know-Who had... taken a liking to me, as he liked my dad. He wanted my parents to offer me the Mark, so if I took it, he'd take me, replace my dad with a younger model."
His father sidled up next to him, a smirk on his lips under his silver mask. Draco wanted to argue, tell his father exactly how nauseous he was at the thought of having to dance with the power-hungry fools following him. And he intended to, mouth opening to harshly whisper the insults he wanted to say to those around him. But his voice was drowned out by the ballroom's excessively large doors opening. All eyes were drawn to the noise, the professional band missing a note at the intrusion, as a late arrival walked in. Gasps echoed and whispers stirred as the young man glanced down from the top of the staircase. Long, dark hair drawn back into a ponytail, wearing green and silver colours.
Harry tried to think positively about it, it might be a long walk but it had the best view. His eyes wondered over to Malfoy, who was watching him closely, stroking his lower lip as if deep in thought. Harry blushed but didn't understand his reaction. It would be easy to lose himself thinking about those lips. The teachers stopped us in the Common Room, and Snape moved forward.
~o0o~
“Well, when I woke up this morning, I headed to the bathroom for a shower like I do every morning, and when I walked past the bathroom mirror, I noticed these wings sticking out of my shoulder blades, at first I thought I was seeing things, but then I felt them. Then my eyes started to go red, and I started to panic. That’s when I called you, but that woke Sirius up. I prayed in head for them to go away, so Sirius wouldn’t see them, and they were gone. As I started to relax, my eyes went back to normal, and just in time for him to storm in.”
He gathered my satchel from the end of the bedframe and offered me his hand. I smirked at the deja vu it brought me, as he offered me the same hand I'd rejected in first year. The light caution around his eyes told me he was seeing the same thing. I smiled as brightly as I could and took his hand. I wanted things to be right this time. I hoped he did too.
She'd barely finished before Harry started begging for the book. This was exactly what he needed. A little knowledge on how he was meant to be spending his wedding night. And if the pictures were... particularly detailed? Well, he'd consider that a private bonus for himself.
The thought of doing that alone was enough to nearly make me bring my lunch back up, I could only imagine what the memory of living through it was doing to him. Voldemort wasn't the nicest looking monster, and having his lipless mouth on you…it made me want to vomit. The blonde caught my attention again, proclaiming his turn and asking what made me want to that to myself. The wording of the question caught me off guard a little, and I really didn't want to answer. Maybe pawn it off as an accident that I hadn't 'done to myself'. But he'd answered my question, I had to answer his. The bloody Slytherin had used my plan against me.
No one had ever said things like that to me, never spoken to me with their heart on their sleeve and bare all for me to see. Saying everything he just did made him vulnerable, he was a Slytherin giving me a power over him I could abuse if I wanted to hurt him. He was trusting me so completely at this moment. I was too speechless to reply with anything that would be half as meaningful, so I pressed my lips to his in our first actual kiss, obviously excluding those to our bodies. My first proper kiss. His lips were like heaven to feel against mine, warm and soft and welcoming. He responded by peeling me off the wall and against him, his arms wrapping around my waist. I crossed my wrists at the back of his neck, playing with his silky hair. I just knew it would feel that soft between my fingers. His tongue grazed the parting of my lips, and I eagerly opened them in hopes of spreading our kiss. He tasted so good, like something a little sweet and a little sour.
Snape stood straight, trying to not let the awkward tension surface, “Hello Harry.”
It made me chuckle. I wasn't the only person nervous about this project, or the only one using it to be themselves without risk. I did close off when I knew he was serious about being a Slytherin, but Benylin had been right about prejudice keeping houses apart. This guy seemed nice enough. Give him the chance to be a bigoted asshole before just shutting him down for being one. I had to be a big person, like they were being. I needed to wait a moment to think through what I wanted to say. I wanted to make a good first impression.
“Forget about dinner,” Draco smiled, leaning in to kiss Harry’s wet cheeks. “I want to apologise properly, and show you just how much I care.”
"This is your choice, you find him. But if this doesn't work, it's your mother and I's choice." His father shrugged.
way. If he ran off, I wouldn't leave him alone and get in trouble with Professor McGonagall. Again. I didn't want to spend my sixth year stalking him.
Again, Harry had no words. Magic wasn't real, it was a story for children. He was sure. Perhaps the man was drunk, he did slur some of his words. Harry should invite him inside for some water.
The look she sent him was not one to be tested, so he replaced the flower vase and walked over as his father caught up with him too. Apparently, while they'd asked many questions, he'd neglected to actually answer any of them. They needed to know what flavour he wanted his cake, what colour he wanted his clothes to be. Everything else they'd sort out themselves, but they wanted to give him the decisions that were important to him.
But it wasn't only guards waiting in the gardens. The prince himself was pacing by the pond, impatient after a long day of disappointment. Only his personal guard and close friend, Blaise, was keeping him calm after such a horrible day. They'd been through half the town, and needed to return to the castle soon. It became obvious that he wasn't going to find his beloved Harry that day. But he'd try the next day, and the next day, for however long it takes. And Blaise would be by his side to help.
I smiled down at it, scrunching it into a ball when Ron tried to sneak a peek. Part of me wished he hadn't sent the note because a private meeting with him was all I could think about during the lesson, and I had to make an excuse to Hermione, so she'd drag Ron off with her. I think she guessed I was meeting him, seen as everyone had heard about what Susan witnessed in the library. My palms were clammy as I made my way to Myrtle's bathroom. He was there before me, but I don't quite know how. He smiled as soon as he saw me.
"Don'. Now you's need the footman and driver. Let's see 'ere."
"Thanks, Harry. I'll try to find the nerve to talk to her after the lesson. Professor Sprout won't mind me being a little late, especially if Benylin says-"
"I feel it important to note that while I speak honestly, and accepting of all, there are those out there that don't accept sexualities beyond hetero. Within the wizarding community, it is only something people don't talk about. There are equal right and opportunity laws and the majority of people don't look down on others for having different preferences, but it is a subject many don't have a full understanding of. Muggles, on the other hand, aren't often as open. Homophobia, or being discriminatory towards homosexuals, is more common. They also aren't provided as much equality in employment systems or even legally."
Harry walked out of the Great Hall, and all the way back to the Eighth Year Tower. He rushed right to his room and hugged himself at being able to act like that around Draco without being a wimp and chickening out. Just as Harry slumped down on his bed, Draco came through the door, and he didn’t look happy.
“About what you said,” Draco frowned. “I didn’t…I didn’t use you. I just couldn’t think when you were kissing me, or when we…you know.”
Harry woke up after hearing a loud noise, and when his eyes flew open, he noticed Draco standing at the door, with Ron and Hermione behind him, their faces covered in fear and concern. Ron tried to get in past Draco, and Hermione opened her mouth to say something, but Draco moved in and closed the door in their faces. When he turned back to face his lover, his face was covered in relief, and he came to wrap his arms around Harry.
I gaped, think I’d said more than I should, and embarrassed that I’d practically just told him I’m interested in him. I looked away, blush burning across my face, and Snape came to crouch next to me, resting his hand on my knee. He told me it was alright for me to talk to him, that he was someone I could trust, and that’s when I just did it. I didn’t plan on it, I just kissed him. He was so surprised he fell over, and I nearly fell with him. He looked up at me in shock, and I lost every ounce of my courage, so I scurried away and left him in shock, just running back to my room.
Harry smiled, he had three lessons with Draco, and that was very good for him. It meant he could stare at him without getting caught because Draco focuses more on work than Harry. They sat next to each other and discussed why they’d chosen those subjects. Harry looked across to the Gryffindor Table, where Ron was grumpy and Hermione was looking at him concerned. He knew he had all his lessons with his friends, and would talk to them then. Other than that, he was focused on Draco, the way his mouth moved when he spoke, how nice he was to Harry now, and wished he knew how to tell Draco he fancied him.
The boy was huge. Draco did actually remember him from the party the previous evening, because his father needed to order a servant to help the boy down the stairs, fearing he'd fall and crush the innocent party-goers below. Anger threatened to flare under Draco's skin as the woman implied his sweet little omega looked anything like the rhino presented to him. And the scent was all wrong, not even the flowers surrounding them could make the odour sweet as it should be. But Blaise cleared his throat and Draco settled his emotions before the rage could bleed red into his eyes. This house was clearly going to be another waste of time. But the rule was every omega.
Harry nodded, rushing out to avoid the beta's batting eyes and needing to catch up with his relatives. They were dawdling next to the town cryer, no doubt hoping for a birthday announcement about Prince Draco. Everyone had been shopping, just in case, so they were ready and prepared for a ball. He was turning 17 years old, he needed to find someone to have his children while he was in his prime. But the longer they waited, the more anxious everyone got. Harry's relatives had already decided to leave when they started ringing the bell.
He released my chin and apologised. I noticed he seemed more shut off. Oh God, he thought I was rejecting him. If I don't fix this, it could ruin the bridges we built, and stop me building more of the ones I wanted. And now I didn't have to hide my cutting and he sort of understood, there could be something between us. I didn't let myself think too much, so I just shuffled to him and kissed his cheek. He smelt so sweet.
Draco thanked his father, surprised and overjoyed. Narcissa smiled sweetly to him, reaching to rub his arm comfortingly. She couldn't keep the smugness out of her voice as she smiled that she had been right all along. The ball had been a wonderful idea.
The wedding bells played, everyone turned to the back of the church, waiting for Draco to stroll down the aisle. The doors opened, and Draco stood there, with a little bouquet of white roses and white veil. The first thing people noticed though, was the dress. Draco had actually walked into the room, in a pale white wedding dress, that bounced out at the hips. He gave a little twirl in the doorway, making people giggle, and walked up the aisle. He smiled at Harry as he approached the altar, and stood beside his lover.
"Well the classroom was empty, and you were on Snape's desk...naked," I started, Draco harshly sucking a mark on my neck, making me moan. "And you were touching yourself, and saying how you wanted me, so I kissed you...that feels so nice...and I touched you, but Snape's voice came out."
I glared down at Malfoy as he smirked, glowing under the attention of his followers. I sneered that losing my parents was better than being raised by filthy Death Eaters. We reached for our wands simultaneously, my friends by my side as his groupies reached into their robes as well.
Nobody reacted, too surprised by how happily she said that to verbalise our shock. She launched into a lecture on how important it was to integrate among each other. She had attended Hogwarts in her childhood, and despite her sunny disposition had been placed in Slytherin. Everyone was enraptured in her speech about her time as a Slytherin distrusted by all the other houses, yet not trusted by her own house for not fitting into the mould society had set.
The prince could see the boy's embarrassment, a telltale pink flush just visible under his simple green Colombina mask. As he descended the stairs, the beautiful detailing of his clothes became clearer, as did his physique. Small and slender, the shape of a traditional omega. And the clothes fit like a glove, the colours complimenting his skin tone and his glittering green eyes. And if Draco needed any further confirmation, smelling the new scent getting closer, his nose intentionally picking out the smell that was the most mouth-watering, told him all he needed to know. This boy, whoever he was, was a pure omega. And like that, the prince was hooked by the sweet scent and shy posture.
The sun shone brightly through the window of the manor, catching on the already polished parts of the floor and blinding the boy trying to scrub it. Multiple times he had to raise his hand to his eyes, wanting to block the harsh rays so he could finish cleaning. He really didn't want to know what punishment was waiting for him if he didn't. It was never good and usually ended with Hermione or Ron sneaking him some food when he was locked in his basement room.
Harry was stunned speechless. The man's accent was very rugged, and he wasn't sure he'd heard him properly. What did he mean by getting him pretty for the ball? He wasn't going, was he?
She was certainly bubbly. She reminded me of Professor Trelawney a little by how she looked. Same kind of hippy clothes, but it seemed like she wore them for comfort. She didn't have Trelawney's constant sense of doom and gloom, her cheery personality shone through every word like sunshine in a window. I worried the Slytherin's were going to chew her up and spit her back out. She didn't seem the kind of woman that could handle a classroom, too gentle to command students. And that was gonna get her in loads of stress. The poor woman had no idea. I guess it wasn't just the students Umbridge was tormenting.
He took to dancing quite quickly, proving to be a good learner. He at least had a natural sense of rhythm. But he wasn't looking at Draco anymore, now they stood so close together, keeping his eyes to the ground in submissive respect. It wasn't what Draco was hoping for. Once the boy was comfortable with the dance, he stopped and bowed, kissing his hand gently.
"You ready for me to really start?"
My attention was brought back into focus by a blunt force hitting the back of my head, and the same book being offered to me. "I'm glad you're finally paying attention, now you can help me brew Draught of Living Death without blowing it up."
His reaction stunned me, but our time together was drawing to a close, and there was still the most important question yet to ask. So, I asked why. Why had he turned on his family and Voldemort? Why was he now being exceptionally nice to me and the others? Why he'd changed?
"Okay, keep your mouth shut because I'm going to rant. You don't get to make that decision for me, I'm my own person and have my own free-will, and I want to be with you as long as you want me. Not you don't want me to lower my standards or whatever, but because you look at me and feel nothing." He smiled, brushing a tear I didn't even notice from my cheek. "Fuck my godfather and his prejudice opinions. Some people don't think I'm good enough for you, Ron beat you down for it remember? But neither of us need a perfect partner, we need someone who makes us feel happy and safe, and wanted. That's how you make me feel when you aren't kicking me out, and I like to think I make you feel like that. So fuck other people, we'll support each other, and Hermione supports us, so don't give up. We have more of a chance than you're letting yourself believe."
“Well, what’s your fucking choice then?”
They shuffled out, dragging the big chunks of mud out of the room and leaving smears. At least it would make things go a little quicker. The bright sun caught his gaze again, making him hold his hand up in frustration. This wasn't what his life was supposed to be, his father didn't want this for him.
Harry was so used to spending his heats alone, curled up on his flimsy straw bed in empty agony. His experience of being in heat has never been good. But that book had described how amazing it could be when the right alpha was there. And he had Draco now, he had an alpha to make him not feel empty and to soothe the lonely cramps. So Harry ignored the nervous knot in his gut and downed the vial in one. It was disgusting.
“Bye dad,” Harry chuckled.
“Now, I should probably get you home, or Sirius will have another reason to hate me.”
Harry nodded, already knowing where this conversation was going. It was where conversations like these always went. Phoebe proceeded to talk about the luxury of the fabric and the attractive pattern or the design. Apparently, the cut was also flattering for a slight form like his, and wouldn't it have been beautiful on Harry? But of course, he'd never get to wear it because he was a stupid servant boy and would never be able to afford a luxury like that. Not that he'd ever be invited to an occasion worthy of a beautiful outfit. Worthwhile society didn't even know he existed. And it would always be that way.
"I'm not. Why the fuck do you think I apologised to Hermione for acting like that in front of her? But the last time you two talked, he punched you. He turned on you, already knowing you were in a dark place, because you were trying to be happy with me and he didn't agree with that. So now he's decided his tantrum is over, and your gonna run back into his arms. He is taking advantage of your weaknesses, and I try and stand up for you but I'm the arsehole. Fine, fuck it, I'll just fucking leave you to it. I'll be the sad fuck, pining for you like a lap dog letting you use me for sex, knowing that you'll never fucking love me back. Because I am that in love with you, all I want is for you to be happy, but I can't even do that."
Harry scowled. He was 18 now, old enough to make his own decisions and he was sick of other people choosing his path in life. He wasn’t about to let Snape make this one for him. He pushed Ron and Hermione to the side, and opened the living room door. The three men turned to him in shock, but he just glared at Snape, holding back tears that threatened to fall and embarrass him.
Removing his fangs, Draco pulled Harry's head back and tilted into his neck, "bite me, Harry. Bond with me. Make me yours too."
"Harry, what is happening?" Hermione hisses.
His sudden concern made me pause. I hadn’t realised I’d been distant. But looking back over the past four days, it was clear he was right. One of two messages a day, and I had stopped sharing with him. Nearly revealing my identity had shaken me, I didn’t want to lose my anonymity so soon. But how can I explain that, without him looking back for my slip up?
Everyone around him couldn't contain their laughter as they teased Ron. It had been an hour since our project had ended and we were told who everyone was talking to behind their journals. Harry obviously already knew, since he had been public with Draco since their date. It was probably this that ended the project now before Christmas, rather than the 6 months it was originally meant to. Everyone was trying to be understanding. Ron was having the most trouble, but after realising the 'hot chick' pen pal of his that he had started to fancy was actually Goyle pretending to be a girl to prank him, it was fair to see he was now whining that he had the worst deal. I was happy for him, even if I was quiet about it. His crush had worked out, it seemed justice for something good to finally come his way.
"I love hearing you beg, Golden Boy. But I promised senseless fucking, remember?"
“No,” Harry frowned. “Remus?”
“I wish I knew,” Harry frowned.
The message then began to repeat. My aunt looked smug as she headed to the horses first, telling a neighbouring woman it was her intuition that led her this way before the announcement. Which wasn't accurate, it was her impatience and plan to go home and sulk that had led her back to the carriages. But Harry did his job, carrying the shopping and heading to pass it to the footman, Ron. He and Harry became good friends as they rode on the back of the carriage together, so he didn't have to run behind. Ron was an alpha, Hermione's alpha in fact, and it was usually these rides back when Harry gave him advice on how to apologise if he needed to. Which wasn't often, thank goodness. Someone in that house needed a little happiness.
"Come on dad, we'll be late for the train," Leo moaned.
Snape took Harry back home and agreed to meet him on Platform 9 3/4 the following day. Harry hugged him, taking Snape by surprise, and hurried back inside to the warm, and to his dinner, leaving his father stunned by shock on the doorstep.
There were three pans on the stove that Harry needed to monitor for everyone's breakfast. It was lucky his aunt had taken his family's money because they spent a fortune on food. Nobody enjoyed eating the same thing for meals, breakfast being the worst. Pheobe only ate porridge, but Dudley thought it was too gloopy and bland and insisted he was given pancakes and bacon. Then there was Petunia, who he had to pick fresh fruit for no more than an hour before she sat down to eat it. Which became difficult when there was something on the stove. It was also difficult to manage when someone came slamming into the kitchen and scaring the life out of him.
The giant began mumbling to himself, counting on his fingers like he was marking off a list. But it seemed he was missing something.
He had 10 minutes to make his escape. He needed to move fast before the magic wore off and he was left looking like a servant in front of the prince. The prince, who was looking at him like they were the only two people in the world. To have that gaze turn in disgust at who he really was, seeing it rather than only hearing it, would be too much for the already emotional omega. So he needed to start running before he was dropped in a hard place.
Frank started to cry, so I rocked him a little, smiling that he was my little boy too. Neville wrapped his arm around me, and we headed off outside, so we could apparate home. I shivered a little because of the cold, so Neville stood behind me and cuddled me properly, as he kissed the top of my head.
“So that’s what you think, that I’d just up and leave if I got you pregnant.” Draco spat. “Wow, you think so highly of me.”
”. Harry grinned, laughing to himself that Hagrid had finally done something for himself. Hermione smiled, glad Harry liked his present.
All the eighth years were left outside for the first years’ sorting ceremony, and most of them were too nervous to speak. They were all worried about whether or not they’d be sorted into the same houses, but Harry noticed that Snape was right, it was mostly Gryffindors. Cho Chang and Markus Belby were the only Ravenclaws to come back, and the only Hufflepuffs were Justin Finch-Fletchley and Susan Bones. There was a fair handful of Slytherins, Gregory Goyle, Theodore Nott, Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson…and Draco Malfoy. Harry’s eyes stopped at Draco and stayed there. It was as if Harry’s world had shifted, and all he could do was stare at the gorgeous wizard only a few yards away from him.
"Harry my boy, I want you to work with Mr Malfoy," he smiled. "Professor Snape said you two would work best together, so the first workbench please."
Parvati blushed beetroot and couldn't stop stuttering enough to answer, so Lavender stepped up. "It's just we heard Harry rejected Ginny because he's a gay (which made Ginny go an angry red, and me too for that matter), but we also heard Draco Malfoy's conversation with Cho, and he rejected her because he's a gay too. So, we were just thinking of you two together, now that he's one of the good guys. As long as he doesn't act like a dick."
Harry turned away and ran, hoping he could hide before Draco caught up with him. He turned the corner, and fled into the hospital wing, hoping Draco hadn’t seen him go in. He sunk to the fall as he heard Draco run towards the door, and sighed as the footsteps carried on. He couldn’t believe that he’d let Draco use him. He’d believed the bastard when he denied it 7 months ago, and now he wished he hadn’t believed him. He felt a soft hand on his shoulder and jumped up to see Madam Pomfrey’s concerned face.
"Not thin air, just a couple rabbits I's found hoppin' aroun'. Do you's have mice? Easy to make 'em 'orses."
"Sometimes a bond won't take if the omega is in heat," Harry frowned. "So is that going to push me into a heat?"
"I can see you're kicking me out, but do I get to know why?"
“Because Harry, this person isn’t just too young for me, they’re also a student here,” Snape frowned. “It wouldn’t be right.”
“The Dark Lord wants to take over, and he knows he can’t do that with Dumbledore in his way. He’s given me the mission of killing him and getting Death Eaters into Hogwarts, which is a suicide mission. That’s why I’m still here this year, he's punishing my father through getting me killed. I don’t want to do the things he tells me to, and…he wants certain things I would rather die than let him do to me.”
His parting words made me chuckle. It was the sort of comment I'd expect from a Slytherin, but with ClassicGemini attitude. But when it was for Malfoy's benefit, I wasn't going to pay any extra. He likes chocolate, I'll just get those. Not like he deserves much more, not for what he said.
A few weeks in, Dumbledore announced he was leaving on Ministry business, but privately warned me that he was cutting loose strings so we could be rid of Voldemort for good. He declined my offer for help but warned there was something important I needed to help with eventually, so I should take the opportunity to enjoy my first Voldemort free school year. I was grateful for that. He left Professor McGonagall as interim Headmistress, which was a relief for those who suspected he'd leave Snape in charge. The man hadn't stopped glaring at me since me and Draco went public, and Draco hadn't explained his behaviour. I didn't feel comfortable enough to ask, not that it really mattered. I could probably guess, and turns out I was right.
"Now, I want a letter every other week to let me know how you're doing," Sirius smiled.
I blushed, shaking my head vigorously. I hadn't been lied to, my pen pal had been open about being a male in Slytherin like I had been about being a male in Gryffindor. After thinking I fancied him, the guy had even been honest about like girls. But he did admit he thought a few guys were cute, so might be up for exploring it if I wanted. We weren't as desperate as Harry and Draco, so I didn't know it was Blaise until his name changed in my journal. Which meant mine changed in his. I'd locked the journal in my trunk, despite seeing the bookmark glow. I didn't want to know what he said, so I ignored him in favour of eating with my friends. I didn't have Harry's luck, so it was doomed.
"You aren't really considering it, right mate?" Ron frowned, "I mean he's growing and shit, but last time he saw me he was as bad as always, so I doubt he'll have changed towards you."
I broke out in relieved laughter, kissing my mate, saying he was good for me. Neville blushed and wanted to know if I wanted to be with him forever. I smiled that I couldn’t think of anything that would make me happier, and he dropped down onto one knee.
"I'll take the first choice."
"Are you ready, ready for my knot, Harry?"
"Please, you don't understand. This boy can't be the one, he wasn't at the ball. I beg you, don't show the wort on my family to the prince. We will never live down the shame."
Harry smiled, “I have to tell you something. I’m pregnant.”
"Well then," Draco blushed. "See you in a bit."
Hermione shook her head slowly. "He helped, so maybe don't talk about him like that. I saw him in Diagon Alley and he wasn't that bad. He insulted me sure but didn't call me a mudblood or anything, just made fun of my hair a bit, and I'm taking that as a sign that he's grown as a person."
“Just assuming your right,” Draco frowned sceptically. “How does that have anything to do with why Harry passed out?”
Harry was rushed in every direction, moving the garden furniture back outside. Couldn't have it rusting in the rain was his aunt's excuse, but it was because they couldn't afford to replace it if it did. Then he was forced back to the kitchen, when he really wanted to stay in the garden and wait. But his aunt didn't want another omega in the gardens making it difficult with the guards. So he returned to the empty kitchen, waving Hermione out with a small smile as she carried a tray of biscuits out the back door. And then it was quiet, and he was alone. Alone with his thoughts, wondering how long it would take the royal guards to figure out it wasn't Dudley and move on to the next house.
"I'll wait for you downstairs in the Common Room unless you wanna walk with Weasley and Granger?"
"No!" Harry pouted, reaching to hold his alpha against him. "You don't need to, you'll never bond with anyone else. My alpha."
“No, he’s not worth it, I’m just going to ignore him completely.”
It wasn't until Friday that we settled on a place to have our little picnic, finally calming Gemini's panic. He'd found a secluded little cave near the lake that he thought seemed perfect. They could build a fire if it got cold, were protected from rain, but the large entrance still let in enough natural light they didn't need to use magic to see each other. I let him know the food was sorted and I was picking it up before I went to the cave. Dobby had insisted he handle everything, pulling Winky in to help him. It was good to see her getting a little bit better.
Ron paled but stuck his ground. "I think you will. It said all eligible ladies or omegas. Harry is an omega, are you saying you'll take him with you?"
"Boy! Duddikins needs to be bathed and dressed. Don't start slacking now, you do want to attend this ball, correct?"
He jumped out of his skin, and I chuckled past the ache in my throat at his shocked expression. He smiled the brightest I'd ever seen, lighting up his whole face and leaned in to kiss me gently on the forehead. He called out to Sirius, which surprised me enough to try and sit up, hurting myself in the process. Draco helped me out gently, using my pillows to support my back. I was concerned to see him be so tender, he was never even like this with friends, never so sweet. Sirius came up beside him and grabbed me in a forceful hug. My body ached some more, and I had to guess that it was because I'd been out for long enough to make my muscles tense.
I tried not to wince, it's not like I didn't already know I was 'damaged goods', but it was painful to hear someone say that to influence someone I was starting to care for. He went on about suggesting my feelings weren't there, and that I was going for the money, or using him purely because he was pretty. I was a little miffed, as he went on and on, slandering me for being fake when I was nothing but, and Draco didn't say a word. And then he finished.
Harry left the buffet table and searched around for Draco, but his boyfriend was nowhere to be seen. He asked Pansy if she knew where he went, and she smiled that Theodore Nott took him outside to speak to him about something supposedly important. Harry thanked her, and headed for the door, leaving the Great Hall. He looked left down at the empty, cold corridor, and when he turned right he wished he hadn’t.
Harry’s last lesson that day was Defence Against the Dark Arts, and he was glad the day was nearly over. He hadn’t got the chance to see Headmistress McGonagall, so Ron was going to let him stay in his room for the night. Harry had successfully avoided Draco all day, and now he was sat next to him, copying notes from Professor Snape. Draco had said hey to him, but Harry ignored him completely, he was too busy trying to push back a blood-boiling headache. He’d had a headache all day, and he knew why it was there, but he was too stubborn to let it push him back to Draco.
"Are you gonna eat the food on your plate or stare into the distance dramatically like a love-struck Hufflepuff?"
"Stop hesitating, I want this, give it to me."
A voice in my head chuckled. I wasn't punished for being gay, although if they found out then I'd definitely be in much more pain, much more often. But what I said was different, and probably insulting. "Why are you doing this?"
I shook as I waited for Neville to come by like he did every night. I shook as I waited for him, remembering all the sweet things he’d said to me, and how he’d stood by me, even when I told him what I was, and what responsibilities he now had. Neville truly is such a loving, kind boy. And I couldn’t bear it if I lost him now, not after all these years of wanting.
It was comforting that she'd seen through my calm disguise, or maybe she knew something wasn't right because I was quiet for once. I thought that if Neville, of all people, found it in him to write out a message or reply for whoever, then I should as well. I wasn't a shy person, the kind of boy to care about what someone thought of me, but I'd turned myself into that person now. I'd built the idea in my head, so now it felt as important as cutting the right wire of a bomb. And Neville was already writing when I got in the room.
~o0o~
"Ouch!"
It only got worse. Because she then brought the two parts together, teaching how sex worked and the things it then causes. The pregnancy I could handle, the pictures were okay and after the scary talk Professor Benylin made it sweeter with baby pictures of happy families. Then came the STDs. Things I never want to talk about or see again.
I glared at Blaise, quizzing him on what happened to not saying anything about my feelings for a certain Gryffindor. He just shrugged with a smirk, making Pansy giggle beside me. Fucking assholes. The sound of someone hitting the floor grabbed my attention, and I followed the noise to the Gryffindor table.
"Could have warned me it would taste like that," he grimaced.
I smirked at his snarky judgement of my writing, but given it was true I didn't have a leg to stand on. But I guess the biting sarcasm and attitude are big things I like about him. He doesn't hold back the truth to spare your feelings, he just makes it lightly funny to take the sting off. People keep tiptoeing around me because they think I'm crazy or lying about Voldemort. It's refreshing.
“But why?”
"Why are you ignoring?" The boy frowned, "I thought we were friends."
I kissed him, it was all I'd wanted to do to reassure him. I apologised for losing my temper when I knew he was only trying to do the right thing. I should learn from my mistakes, but I still wanted my confession to really mean something to him, and it was my thing, so I planned to tell him later. Maybe during dinner, or when we were in bed. One night with his mouth on me and now I wanted it all the time. Because he was tender and compassionate with me, not like the crap I knew before. And I just know he'll be the same when we actually go all the way.
He wrapped his arms around me from behind and blushed at the contact of his wet front to my back. He kissed the back of my neck and I melted into him. I turned around, pressing our torsos together as I reached up to kiss his sweet lips. He pulled back, asking if I wanted to sit up with him for a while. I nodded, not trusting my voice to not come out breathy. I sat down on the couch, and suddenly realised he'd only been wearing a towel. I averted my eyes so he could slip into some clothes. Any clothes.
“I am.”
"Wash those cups and make some for us, you selfish boy." His aunt shrieked, obviously not happy about the evening.
Just as Draco had made up his mind to hide in the castle gardens, he felt the knock of a cane on his shoulder and a condescending voice at his back.
“What have you done to me,” Harry whispered.
“Well, are we going or what,” Ron laughed.
Sirius stroked his head softly, and Harry winced when he yanked out some of his hair. Harry grumbled, rubbing it better, as Sirius laughed at him. Sirius left, in a better mood than when he came in, and Hermione and Ron looked at Harry expectantly.
“Oh Merlin, I’m gonna be a dad,” Neville laughed.
The alphas looked behind Harry's shoulder and stilled. Each one nodded before turning away, leaving Harry to whoever happened to save him. The young omega turned around and was hit by a spicy smell, almost feeling overpowered by how nice it was. Harry looked up to the alpha's face, seeing sharp features around his mask and beauty grey eyes. The wig on his head seemed too lush and natural, almost like it was his own hair curled and styled. As he smiled, Harry felt butterflies bouncing around in his stomach.
"Except, perhaps whatever is in the box is expensive. Diamond rings come in the smallest boxes boys." Hermione scolded, "besides the present doesn't matter, it's the note. So read the apology before you judge."
"Which is?" Harry grinned.
“Well, it may be your fault we’re in this mess, but I love you.” Neville smiled. “And now I know that I don’t have to sacrifice a family because of my sexuality. You really are amazing, and everything I could ever dream of.”
"You're early, skipping Potions I take it?"
"This morning, I was trying to apologise." Ron blushed, "I was wrong to react how I did over you and Malfoy, I was angry that you were making a stupid decision and making it seem so great. I just thought you should know better. But then I saw how happy you've been together. I thought he was gonna be a bit of a dick, but I didn't expect the forceful shoving. Good to know he can look after you I guess."
"There you are!" His mother's voice called, "honey, put that back and come here, I have something to ask you."
"Easy for you to say," Harry smiled.
Harry turned back to the door that he’d made appear, and nodded. He swung the door open and stepped inside. He blushed when he saw how the room had shaped itself. The only light emanated from a fireplace to the side, and he could see a faux-fur black rug on the floor by the fire, carpeting the space between the flames and a couple of forest green couches facing it. Harry couldn’t help examining the four-poster bed on the other side of the room, with its Egyptian cotton emerald sheets and black pillowcases and duvet. His eyes widen at the unmistakable sight of shackles hanging from the headboard, trying to avoid mental images of Malfoy using them on him. He stood just inside the doorway, not wanting to be followed in. But Malfoy could see around him.
"I have to go."
I shook my head a little, caught in his trap. We kissed again, losing track of time and almost making us late to class. Professor Sprout didn't seem too upset, knowing my love of her subject would mean I wasn't late on purpose. I saw Harry smiling at me, making me thankful my face was already red from the cold and disguised my embarrassment. I guess we both get a happy ending here.
"Harry," Hermione grinned, hands on her slight hips. "Get your cutie booty in the bath, because it's time for you to start getting ready."
~o0o~
"He didn't even give anyone else a chance. I was ten times better than the stick he went away with," Dudley glared. "And the brat ran away from the party, he forfeited his right to the prince's hand. It's stupid."
I felt oddly weird. At first, I thought it was ridiculous that I was jealous of Malfoy being with Cho after I couldn't, but I was gay after all. But when I thought it over, I realised that it might actually be the other way around. Then I laughed to myself. I was being stupid, I'd never look at Malfoy that way. Even if he did want me then I still don't deserve that kind of happiness.
However, the prince was working on the decorations. He was trying to secretly pull them down to avoid having his party. And trying to hide from his parents' incessant questions. He didn't want a giant ball to celebrate his birthday if it was all just going to be a ruse to choose a pretty girl or omega that he'd buy into being his queen. Because they'd either want to marry him for his wealth and status, or they'd want to refuse but their parents would push them to say yes because of his wealth and status. And he didn't want a foolish sham marriage like that.
"You too dad," Harry grinned.
She started with the biology lesson showing diagrams of what the body parts looked like, and which bits did what. She went through what puberty looked like in girls, all the bleeding and hormone shifts making them easily stressed. Boys shift hormones, voices get deeper and they start wanting to be sexually intimate with people. Even Hermione, who was well known for being all about facts, felt like she wanted our little lesson to be over.
"Don't even try it, I haven't let you do that since I knew I was a wizard, and I'm not gonna let you start again now that your girlfriend split up with you." I glared, "I'm strong enough to stop you, and I can handle you hitting me like a four-year-old throwing a tantrum, it's what kept you from trying to do more than making me give you handjobs before the threat of me cursing you. And like I say every time you're sad enough to kiss me, I'm your fucking cousin, and you're fucking sick."
"I don't have a clue."
And so it started.
"I'll come by and see you later guys," I grinned as I dashed away with the basket. "I don't want to keep him waiting."
Hermione shrugged, but she clearly looked put out too. It just made me think about why he'd rejected her. I shuffled into the Great Hall, sliding into a place with my friends and waiting to hear from Dumbledore. When he stood and raised his hands for silence, I finally noticed the blackened crusty fingers. Whatever dark magic it was had raked up half his lower arm. I felt guilty I didn't notice it last week.
His mother huffed, "stop thinking of it like that. Think of it like this, if you don't have this ball and don't choose someone for yourself, you'll be marrying someone your father and I pick for you."
A steaming bowl of soup was placed in front of me, and he sat across from me with his. Creamy tomato and herb he said. Whatever it was, it was so good. It was actually better than when the house elves make it, apparently, it was herbs that they just don't use. For the main, he'd made pork and potatoes with some fancy sauce and green stalk things. They were also really nice.
But his omega couldn't open his mouth, knowing his answer would be a cry of pain and nothing helpful. But burying his face in Draco's neck helped. He breathed in his alpha's scent, moaning before he realised what he was doing, feeling slick start to coat his legs instantly. He'd never gone through a heat like this, where he was barely aware of things around him except Draco and his desire for his prince. But this was the first time he'd felt like he was in heat with an alpha so close.
I kept my mouth shut at breakfast, and when Professor McGonagall checked our NEWT lessons, adding Potions to my list so I can be an Auror. I sat silently through Transfiguration and Charms, but when I walked into Potions and saw Draco standing with Blaise Zabini, I started to shake. He said he wouldn't tell Dumbledore, but said nothing about telling others. I stood with Ron and Hermione and pretended to listen to whatever they were talking about, but I was trapped in my own mind. I didn't even register it when Professor Slughorn called to me, Hermione had to nudge me.
"Of course you haven't. I'm sorry if you're disappointed now you know it's me, but don't let that hatred cloud your mind." He frowned, "the point of this was letting us be friends free from our reputations. There hasn't been a moment I've been dishonest with you, and I hope you've been the same. I've let you see the real me, and you have no idea how freeing it is to not wear the mask of my father. I need you to understand that at least."
"So, we've got hours left on this train ride, let's play some games." Hermione grinned.
A hand hooked under Harry's knee and lifted his legs apart, making him tilt back into Draco's body, and then he thrust forward. It was like a fire burning inside Harry's core, the full feeling and his alpha's moan behind him making him feel complete. All the hype suddenly made sense. They were joining in the most primal way, and it was perfect. Expect then Draco was moving back.
"Just in case you were thinking I meant... sex, I wasn't. You were feeling guilty to kiss me earlier, I'm not stupid enough to think you'd be okay with...
Draco wanted to stress and throw things, ruin all the decorations so they couldn't have a ball. But he knew they weren't joking. If he didn't find someone tonight, his mother would. And he wouldn't like her choice for him, they just had the complete opposite taste. So he didn't have a choice.
“Nothing, he’s better off thinking James is his father, at least he doesn’t hate him,” Snape said, much to the other men’s surprise. “I can look out for him at school, but he wouldn’t want me as his father.”
"Who says we don't get a happy ending?" He breathed, the warmth tickling my cheeks. "You're one of the guys I meant when I said there were some cute guys in school. And I thought we were exploring things together. Sounds like a happy ending to me."
Before he could prepare for his father's anger, the steward returned with a frown. He'd looked over every name, cross-referencing them with the crest their family was under, but he couldn't find the lion. Draco didn't let that get him down. It was a chance, not a certainty, and he wasn't going to let it stand in the way of his love. He looked back to the ring, trying to slip it on his finger without it budging. It was a place to start, if the ring fits then there's a chance it's his love.
Goyle added, "think you can spread lies about fighting You-Know-Who when you can't handle a couple of pictures."
He dipped a finger in the chocolate sauce and sucked it into his mouth as he gazed at me. It was very hot. He repeated the action but held his finger out for me to suck. My cheeks blushed vivid red as I wrapped my lips around his finger. He stripped the top half of his body one-handed, but took the other from me to remove the rest. Then we were on equal footing.
Harry blinked his eyes open and noticed Draco looking down at him, “What the fuck are you doing?”
~o0o~
“Hey dad,” Harry stressed the last word, wanting to be heard. “Or would you rather I didn’t call you that?”
"Blimey, w'ere are me manners? The name is Rubius 'agrid, I've been sent 'ere to get you ready for this ball. You earned it, and you deserve to go."
“Burn in hell,” Harry spat. “Literally, don’t even talk to me.”
"I just can't believe the prince cancelled his party. He dances with one omega in the gardens and now he's found the man of his dreams," Pheobe frowned.
Benylin gestured for us to prepare to leave and a notebook floated off her desk directed over to each of us. It was tied closed by a ribbon, so I assumed something important was written in its pages. Like my fake name, and the fake name of whoever I was about to start talking to. I faked needing the bathroom to take a private look inside, which it seemed the other boys wanted to do as well. The cover was blank, but like an ordinary journal it had
for the entire Great Hall to have paused their conversations and for every pair of eyes to be on us. Me pressed into Draco's side. I didn't think we'd draw so much attention. Dumbledore was sitting in his usual spot, his twinkling eyes confused by our hold, and I blushed a little. I tried to ignore Snape's glare and turned my head to look over to my friends. Hermione was holding Lavender's hand, who was holding Parvati's hand, all three looking like Susan Bones before she fainted. Ron was pale, looking at us in utter confusion, which made me disappointed. I was expecting that funny green colour, but I least I got sickly pale.
“Wow, I’ll need to be careful then,” Harry frowned.
"I didn't want to leave without seeing you were okay," Sirius frowned into my neck. "Why didn't you tell anyone you were so unhappy or whatever reason you hurt yourself over?"
This was going to make school a whole lot crappier. I was raised in the muggle world, I didn't need to learn Muggle Studies. I spend time around a toaster every summer, I don't need to learn about its properties in stupid details. And now it's placed in our free time like some kind of club. 'Living Muggle Studies Club'. What a stupid name too. I already live with fucking muggles. The was just more obvious torment from the bitch-toad, Umbridge.
He turned to look at me. He looked shocked and slightly disbelieving, but I just smiled. He grabbed me with the brightest smile I'd ever seen on him. He hugged me tightly, kissing all over my face, begging me to say it again. No matter how many times I said it, he wanted to hear it again.
"What about that girlfriend of yours?"
"And, I suppose, the most relevant part is that there are chapters about... well, male omegas with male alphas... and what they do together. At least, I think it does. I got terribly embarrassed over the pictures and skipped those chapters. Point is, it might help with your confusion. If you want it."
“If you dare raise your hand to him again, I’ll rip your arm out its socket.”
After descending the staircase in silence, Harry pressed his ear against the living room door, leaving room for his friends to follow his lead. They couldn’t hear much to the first few minutes until Sirius kicked off again. He was yelling about their visitor being a liar, that there was nothing wrong with James, and that Harry was the spitting image of him too.
"Are you alright?" He said, stroking my arm and worrying his bottom lip. "The whole lesson I was worried about you, that dream seemed…intense."
“Actually, it’s ‘babies’. I’m having twins.” Harry smiled.
“What do you mean?” Draco grinned. “You said you liked me, so what’s the problem?”
"Hermione wanted to help me be prepared, so she let me borrow a book. It explained things pretty well. Positions and stuff like that, so I'm glad you chose this one to knot me. It's comfortable."
Draco and Harry walked to Potions together, laughing about something Snape had done. Harry liked seeing his dad as a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, seen as that’s what he’d wanted to be for a long time. They were still joking around when they got to the Potions Classroom. Slughorn welcomed them in and told them to partner up at a workbench. They went to sit together, and Slughorn ordered the class to brew a cauldron of Antidote to Uncommon Poisons. Draco got straight down to business, opening the book and starting the potion. Harry liked how bossy Draco was when it came to Potions, it was kind of hot.
“Oh, are you looking for a test?” Madam Pomfrey smiled. “You’re a little young don’t you think.”
"SIT teaches us that we can stop prejudice with a single in-group, so in Hermione's example we would be Hogwarts students and not separate houses." Professor Benylin smiled. "And RCT uses superordinate goals. Working towards a common goal so everyone can benefit. Now, tell me how we can apply this to the school."
“Intercourse,” Snape blushed.
"I want to know more about you," he suddenly said. "I want to discover how Harry is different from our resident Golden Boy"
“I want some guarantees from you,” the blonde stammered. “That I’ll be safe from…Him. Me and my mother.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"I have one sir," Seamus frowned. "The Sorting Hat must be drunk, it put Harry in Slytherin."
"I think him and Cho would look great together," Ron grinned. "Adorable pureblood babies."
He sauntered past me, fully dressed and showered, headed for our little kitchen. I didn't know how to respond, he'd just shoved my best friends away without letting Ron say his piece. All he'd have said was some nonsense and an apology if Hermione had come with him. After how he'd helped me out the day before, it made sense that he was trying. And Draco had ruined it.
I finished writing and waited. Rereading my entry, my eyes widened. I threw the journal across the room in my panic. I'm so stupid. That sounds like I would keep the card. I let my guard down and just wrote what I thought, and now he'll know. Unless I struck gold and got someone as stupid as I must be to have written that, he'll know it's me for sure.
He collapsed next to me. I said he loved me again and thanked me for letting him have me as no one had before.
“Well it started this morning when I found out Snape is pregnant,” Harry smiled.
Harry nodded, rubbing his eyes. Draco placed the back of his hand against Harry’s head, checking for a fever. Harry slapped it away with a smile, but Draco just glared. Harry kissed him lightly, promising him he was alright. Draco loosened up, bringing Harry in for a bigger kiss. He asked Harry why he’d been cooped up in his room all day if he wasn’t sick.
"I apologise, my footman has a bad habit of speaking out of turn. He will be disciplined, I assure you," the old lady hissed at the alpha. "The boy is my nephew, a servant, and wasn't even at the ball last night."
Harry turned his attention back to see three people standing behind him. Hagrid had pulled two men out of the air, dressed formally for a footman and driver. It was amazing.
“I’m sorry if I woke you,” Harry sniffed, wiping his tears.
As Harry crawled along the floor of the entryway, scrubbing brush firmly in hand, he beamed at the shine. It marked the shine of him finishing the first floor of the manor, just needed to clean the east and west wing, which he'd done so many times, it had become second nature. He was believing he could finish everything in time. Petunia needed to teach Dudley how to behave properly if they were going to snag a Prince, which gave him time to get ready. It was just getting himself presentable that posed an issue.
"Oh er, morning Draco," Harry smiled, hoping Draco didn’t know what he was thinking.
"Morning boys and girls!" Our bubbly professor grinned. It seems wrong for her to be a morning person too. "Let's start, shall we? Muggle history can be a pretty big topic."
Sweat pooled and dripped from Harry's brow, so he panted and wiped his forehead. The last 20 minutes had been a bit of a rush, but finally, all the cleaning was finished. He'd done most of the cleaning, Hermione had mostly just tidied Phoebe's room because he never seemed to organise things right. His cousin was a giant diva without the talent or looks to support the horrible character trait. Everything needed to be organised perfectly and prettily, even if she could never keep it that way for longer than three days. It frustrated Hermione endlessly.
(See the end of the chapter for
I looked in the direction of the door and whispered close to Snape’s ear, so he could feel the tickle of my breath. “Lead the way.”
"If babies meant a sexless marriage most of the Weasleys wouldn't be here," Harry smirked.
He led the way, clearly knowing the way better than me, but I guess as a Slytherin he could navigate this maze better than others. Lucky me. It didn't take long and looked like it was very close to our Potions classroom. My daydream swam in my mind, and I had to admit we had a shot if Draco would want to. I decided not to push him for more than kisses...and maybe some heavy petting,
Harry went to see his dad and admitted that he was right and that Draco was always in his mind. Snape smiled, glad to see Harry in love with someone who deserved his love. Snape’s only issue was that Harry hadn’t acted on his feelings, and insisted that he did, as soon as he could.
"It's okay, but can we not talk about it in a crowded classroom," Draco suggested. "I don't know about your friends, but I know Blaise is eavesdropping whenever he can, so we should talk later."
He looked passed my shoulder and nodded. The yellow roses meant innocence and friendship, making it ideal to express your genuine emotions if you want to apologize for a mistake. White is always associated with purity and new beginnings, so white tulips are happy flowers that can help you say sorry and make up for the mistake. Lilies are dainty and delicate, much like the relationship between us, with frequent phases of miscommunication because neither of us listens to each other. Ivy adds a dash of dependability and support, the one thing which you need to convey the most when you have messed up. White orchids are the epitome of sincerity and care, just the things you needed to convey to the person whom you have managed to piss off. It's a classic apology bouquet at first-class florists. Which meant expensive.
“A beautiful baby, I can’t believe it.”
"There won't be any consequences, I promise. Just come with me, I'll present you to my father and you can stay in the castle. There are many spare rooms. I've decided Harry, I want us to bond. I feel it, like instinct, you are the one for me."
He looked confused, and his thumb paused its caress over my hand. He let go looked me dead in the eye, asking if that was the question I wanted to ask. I said nothing. So, he answered.
“I’ve got Transfiguration, Defence Against the Dark Arts and Potions before lunch, then Divination, Care of Magical Creatures, Muggle Studies and Charms.” Harry smiled. “How about you?”
“Well I didn’t, but Snape didn’t ask to see you,” Harry grinned. “That was me, and want you to visit him again. I’ve caught you staring at him, and I know he’d be interested…if there was something to be interested in.”
"And want is it you want now Harry?"
"And what did he say?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Then comes the big news…" Hermione started.
Then Professor Benylin mentioned Sherif's Realistic Conflict Theory. Something that sounded a lot like school. It was the theory that prejudice stems from the competition for finite resources, based on a study he did with children at summer camp. They were put into two groups and competed in games. It was then that they started to disagree and discriminate. From that point, we go on to how to reduce it.
Then I started thinking of the worst. Like he was avoiding me. Or he was with someone else, that thought nearly brought me to tears in Transfiguration. Or a death eater could have found their way into the school because Dumbledore wasn't there, and was torturing him to avenge Voldemort. Sure, it was far-fetched, but I was panicking. I held everything, but Potions was the last straw. It was his favourite subject, he was the best in the class, yet he wasn't in the room. That was as much as I could take.
"Harry?"
." I peaked up at him to see him looking at me in confusion. My cheeks heated. "I don't sleep well, I have nightmares and that leads me to cut myself. I guess I was just thinking that if you were there, it'd help. But if you still don't want to, or feel I'm guilt tripping you..."
His father nodded, turning to the steward and demanding an announcement was written up urgently. It needed to be called out across the town in the morning, that the prince would be travelling house to house, asking the male omegas to try on the ring, so Draco could determine if they were the beauty behind the green mask that he would make his bride. The prince didn't know how to react, hearing his father practically give his blessing.
I looked up and saw Fred grinning at me from next to my trunk, "ready to go Harry?"
“I know who wrote it, I’ve been marking their work for seven years,” He laughed. “And you can tell by his attitude, the owl came from Draco Malfoy.”
"You just don't want him to meet her because if she's hot he won't be obsessed with you anymore."
"Then I'll provide a new plan. We'll retire for tonight, and then tomorrow we can get to know each other and maybe make out. How does that sound?"
The Sorting Hat was placed on his head, and you could tell how nervous he was as he waited. After a few seconds, the Hat bellowed ‘Hufflepuff’, and Gregory took a sigh of relief, clearly he didn’t want to be a Slytherin anymore. Malfoy was up next and, no surprise, he was sorted into Slytherin. Harry thought green suited the blonde, and he noticed just how nice Malfoy’s shape was as he headed to his seat at the Slytherin Table. Harry shook the thoughts from his head as Theodore Nott was sorted into Ravenclaw. No shock when Parkinson or Zabini were put in Slytherin. The original Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw students remained in their houses, and the last house up was Gryffindor.
"You always picked on me and the friends I did have, nearly always. That's why I'm not entirely sure any of this is genuine." But I want it to be.
And just the word was enough to have Harry howl, head back and desperately pushing back for it, rutting against his alpha like a wild whore. And the actions were very welcomed. So much so that Draco pushed on, swelled knot pressing past Harry rim and making him come before he even knew what was happening. He was in such a blissful state, he barely felt his alpha roll his hips for the last bits of friction he needed until there were fangs in his neck. And it was like orgasming again, feeling a bond snap and writhe between them.
Harry couldn't even feel himself being moved, all his senses zoning in on the hands on his waist or his alpha's breath on his ear. He needed something, something more than hands on his clothed waist. He felt like he was on fire, he needed his clothes off. Although, Draco almost dropped him when Harry squirmed to undo the buttons on his frock coat. And while he knew his omega couldn't be comfortable, the eager whining was making it hard for the alpha not to chuckle. And the panting on his neck was making other things hard.
The prince was ready to burst, even if this boy wasn't his omega, it angered him that the woman spoke that way about her own flesh and blood. There had been times when he argued with his father, and the king had said similar cruel things just to upset him. It was a torment to hear family talk about you that way. And he was sure the omega didn't deserve it. But before he could unleash his wrath, the wind blew a familiar scent under his nose.
"Darlings, leave the useless boy to finish his scrubbing," their mother called from the entryway. "We can leave as soon as he's finished, he's still needed to carry the bags."
The doors to the Great Hall opened, and Harry walked in with his new entourage, and the whole room fell silent. Harry was getting sick of the attention, so he nudged Neville with a smile and headed to the Slytherin Table. Draco came up on his other side and asked what lessons Harry had, and Draco’s soft voice nearly made Harry forget.
He came to lay beside me. I snuggled into his arms and thought about telling him about my feelings, but decided against it. You don't throw the word 'love' around liberally, otherwise, it loses its meaning. I'd tell him tomorrow maybe, while we cuddle in bed before sleep. I could try giving him a blowjob or a handjob or something. Make it special, then maybe it could be the first time we go all the way together.
I crawled out of Harry’s bed, and grabbed a piece of parchment, scribbling a quick note for Harry to read in the morning, and placed it on his bedside table. I took one last look at his beautiful face, and placed a gentle kiss on his forehead, before climbing back into my own bed, and facing away from Harry, and trying to fall asleep in the cold.
"Phoebe, darling! Come and take a look at this bonnet." Aunt Petunia called.
"Maybe it's simpler than that, and I'm not a dickhead here." My face twitched, as though holding my tongue. "Maybe I'm just accepting things you aren't, things you're too stubborn to consider because of how you feel about me. I'm not good enough, I don't deserve you, and you won't make the right choice about it so I will."
I get Draco's outburst may be OTT, but it's meant to be. He's over-emotional and over-dramatic, and has been harbouring his feelings for years until they've come out and Harry hasn't said them back. He's bottling up, which is bad. So yeah, it's necessary.
“It means positive,” Remus answered. “James isn’t Harry’s dad.”
It started slow, only a few people noticed us walk in. But then the word spread, and it took less and 20 seconds
His mother was just behind him, "I thought you understood how important this ball was for you."
The prince motioned for one of the guards to place the ring on one of the boy's fingers, his mother shaking with excitement as if she was unaware there was no possibility her son could be his darling omega. And as suspected, the ring wouldn't fit. Couldn't even get past the first knuckle on Dudley's finger. Though, based on the size of him, Draco was surprised it went on that far. He expected the disappointment and managed to keep it off his face.
Draco looked Harry straight in the eyes as he sang, “I don’t close my eyes, I don’t fall asleep, cos I’d miss you, babe. And I don’t wanna miss a thing.”
"I know Harry, turn on your side. It'll make everything easier, just getting you to bite my neck might be a struggle. But we'll worry about that when we get there.
To begin with, I thought Ron meant throwing it in his face to make him queasy. I giggled with Hermione, the other two girls hanging over her shoulders, who all wanted to know everything about where I'd been and tell me how sweet he was as we came in. Lavender was begging me to tell her he was my boyfriend and squealed when I admitted he was. She did this really strange thing, she started jumping up and down in her seat, so slightly and quickly that it looked like she was shaking. I was just getting worried when Ron cleared his throat. I turned to the side to raise an eyebrow at him and he repeated his question, looking far less than pleased.
I laughed with him as I moved to let him sit up, agreeing to the idea for the fun of teasing my best friend. Everything was still up in the air, like where we went from our first date, but I decided to myself it was more fun if we rolled with it. For better or worse, this year was going to be different. And I was excited about the change.
"Sorry, guess I'm a hugger," he blushed. "I just don't know how to comfort someone, so I tried to think of what Granger would do... oh how the mighty have fallen right?"
"I won't have proper control of the horse if you keep brushing into my neck like that, love."
I could hear the anger coming through in his voice, though I'm sure he was trying to stay calm. He backed away and looked into my eyes, searching for pain or panic people expect from victims. But I'd had worse happen to me than touching my cousin's...
As the song drew to a close, Sirius and Remus came over and asked if they could speak to Harry for a while. Draco smiled, heading off to Pansy while Harry walked with Remus and Sirius to the buffet table. Harry munched on half the pork pies as Remus explained the deal of getting Narcissa out of Azkaban, and Sirius smiled that it went down well and that she would be released within a month.
