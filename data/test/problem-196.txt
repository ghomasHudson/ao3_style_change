Malfoy raised an eyebrow. "You're doing it yourself? Never heard of house-elves? I'm sure in a house like this they come by the dozen."
"You better cover that up before Ginny sees it." Hermione scowled at Harry's neck before returning to the book in front of her. Harry's hand automatically came up to the red mark and his face flushed. He had just sat down opposite her at her favourite desk in the library.
Hermione's cheeks caught a light shade of pink. "Well, anything you missed in class could be read later in the textbooks. But that's beside the point. The point is the Split-Apart Spell from 399 BC."
"So you keep saying." Malfoy gazed at Harry, and the corner of his mouth twitched. "Look, you don't have to do this, you know. We can stop any time you want, I don't care." Malfoy glanced down the corridor and back at Harry again. "But if you like, there's an empty storage-room down the hall." He slid his hand over Harry's crotch. "Only if you want to, it's all the same to me."
"Well, the Amortentia... and with the Veritaserum..." Hermione was thinking, combinations of all the different ingrediencies whooshing through her head. "You fancy him, don't you, Harry?" she finally said.
"Will anyone here care to explain what's going on?" Pansy's voice had now pitched to a hysterical squeal as she stared at the two boys. She looked so lost and bewildered that Neville didn't think. He rose and swept her into a hug and she thankfully let him.
Voices came closer and within seconds they were to be surrounded by their team-mates, and he did it, he took this wild chance. Harry leaned in and whispered, "The password is 'Lionhearts'." Then he turned around and left for the changing rooms.
I kept coming back. The bartender started to greet me as one of the regulars and remembered my preferred brand of beer. Sometimes men came up to me, but I smiled politely and told them I wasn't avalible.
"S'not fair!" Harry could hear the light whining in his own voice. "I ask easy questions and you go for the hard ones all at once."
"What's the matter, Harry? You look positively pale. Aren't you having a good time?" She hooked her arms around his neck and smiled tentatively. She knew, of course, all his demons of the war, all his concerns and all his fears.
"Come on then, you big drama-queen. Get dressed and I'll take you to Madam Pomfrey." They started to put on their clothes, which was a bit difficult for Draco, as he had to keep one hand at his bleeding face all the time. But with Harry's help they managed, opened the curtains and headed out for the stairs.
Dean smiled and waved at them from where he was standing against the wall, and Harry put his hand at Ginny's back and gave her a small push in his direction. "Go on, Gin, dance with him, I don't mind. He's a hell of a better dancer than I am. I'll have a Butterbeer and watch." He smiled at her and gave her a quick kiss. She deserved to have a good time and he didn't feel a trace of jelousy, not towards Dean, anyway. He knew he hadn't been the best boyfriend this year. Ever since they got together again at the beginning of the schoolyear, he'd been absentminded, restless and brooding. Sometimes he thought they were better off as friends, and she deserved the best and more, much more than he felt he could give.
Pansy nodded. "I need to think this through," she said slowly and glanced out of the window. "If I hurry, I can still catch the last of the sun at my special place..." She paused and looked at him. "Would you like to come with me? You know the place."
"We plan to stay away as long as we can, but we'll see. Draco haven't heard if he got into the Healers program yet. I told him not to worry, not with him getting almost as good grades as Hermione at his NEWTs, but you know Draco." Harry sighed and let his gaze linger on the blond boy.
"Anyway," Harry just shrugged his shoulders, tired of explaining the benefits of such a simple thing as electricity to pureblood wizards. The kids were used to it, he was used to it. "Now what's left is some new wallpaper and paint, and that's why I look like this." He made a gesture to his paint-smeared dungarees.
"And that's supposed to be rousing? Muggles having sex?" The astonished contempt displayed on his face was almost comical.
His gaze found Malfoy in the crowd, and he devoured the sight of him, the way he stood out from the rest, with his long legs, his arrogant poise and his sharp tongue. Ron followed his ogling and turned to give him a questioning look.
Most of the class had already filed out, but Malfoy was still there, sorting through his parchments, all neatly filled with row upon row of notes. His brow was furrowed and he seemed absorbed in organizing and in no hurry to leave. Could this be a good time for Harry to talk to him?
"Perfectly," Flint said. "I'll take little Warrington home as well. He's having a bit of a hard time right now, poor kid." He muttered conspiratorial to Harry, "His mum's just run off with another witch, can you imagine?" He chuckled and winked at Harry. "Pretty disgusting, if you ask me." Harry felt his throat go dry and coughed in his fist.
"That's right, pet, just let go.," Harry heard Malfoy's voice, and he drew a ragged breath as a hot mouth decended on his cock.
"Naturally," Malfoy scoffed and followed. "Pureblood children are brought up by house-elves as far away from their parents as possible, until they come of an age where they've learned how to behave with decorum."
I winced. "But now you've got me hooked on your absolutely fascinating story. What had Justin said?"
Unwillingly, Harry lifted his hands but let them fall to his sides again. There was nothing more to say.
"Narcissa," Mrs Weasley said sharply and let go of Harry. They all stood silent and stared at each other.
"Do you remember Roger Davies? He was captain of the Ravenclaw team, and a couple of years above us at Hogwarts. Apperantly, he's become a sports-journalist and has written a book about Quidditch. I was asked to put my review on the cover of it." Harry groaned. "'Quidditch -analysing the game', the most boring book about Quidditch I've ever read."
The last time he'd met Malfoy, before seeing him at Platform 9 3/4, was at the trials after the war. Then he had looked scared and lost, a sickly pale boy with wide frightened eyes. Harry didn't quite know what to think when he looked at him now, the grown man.
"No, you don't understand." Malfoy sat upright, taking Harry's hands away from his hair. "I don't want to. I can't do that to Astoria. She's my best friend and the mother of my child. She single-handedly runs the Malfoy estate, she's company to my mother, who never really has recovered after the war, and above all -she stood by me when everything fell apart for us. She and her family, not once did they mention they were backing out on the marriage agreement when the tables had turned. She didn't break the engagement when she had nothing to gain, only to lose, being associated with me."
"Such as picking out perfectly matching coloures and very nice furniture," Ginny smirked. "Whoever she is, she's got impeccable taste. I know you, Harry. You couldn't have picked and matched those colours if your life depended on it."
I finished my NEWTs, I went back to the Manor and I married Astoria Greengrass. To my surprise, she got pregnant. The times we fucked were scarce, to say the least, and I was seldom sober at the time.
A woman of indefineble age and salt-and-pepper hair sat at the reception desk. Harry walked towards her to introduce himself, but she was faster. "Mr Potter, what an honor." Harry gave her a half-hearted smile, as he always did when he was recognised. She waved her hand to the door at the left. "You can go right in, he's expecting you."
They walked in silence from room to room until, finally, Malfoy spoke again. "All over the place, there are magical and non-magical artefacts on display, side by side, without any comment, just sorted by geography and age. It made me realize something; that the separation between our two worlds are quite recent and that we were meant to co-exist in a way we had since the beginning of time."
Ron fidgeted with the label on the bottle, pulling it off from one of the corners. "I tild 'Mione what happend, I had to. I couldn't keep it from her. She was hurt and furious, of course. I thought I'd really blown it, that it was over between us. But you know how she is. Once she'd calmed down, she started analysing the facts, study our situation from different perspectives."
Draco made himself ready to walk on, but Potter remained where he was, awkwardly shifting from one foot to the other, blocking his way. "Is there anything else you want, Potter? I'm late for Arithmancy class as it is." Draco kept his voice at his haughtiest, so that the tremor in his throat remained undetected.
"Never." Harry stated firmly. "It's me and you, isn't it? It's supposed to be like this. But I can't possibly have sex with you tonight, Draco."
"I don't know what any of that is," Malfoy scowled. "but I can assure you this is perfectly fine, once you get used to the taste. I was hoping for something with a little more bite in it, though."
"Yeah, I guess I am. Wiltshire is my home, it's what I was raised to do, to be. The politics were a side-line interest my father indulged in, but I'm more of a country-boy, like my Grandfather and the ones before him."
Malfoy winked at him. "Imagine what a little magic can do. Oh, she loved this one." He pulled up a record and took out the vinyl and changed the record on the gramophone. "She once confessed she had a terrible crush on this singer." He put down the needle, and a song came on. "Before she was engaged, of course." Malfoy put out the cigarette in the overfull ashtray at his side.
Draco reached out and took the wand. The ebony hilt fit his hand perfectly and the buzz of the magic was familiar and reassuring. He held it up and the warm light of the
Harry closed his eyes. He felt Malfoy's hand, the long slim fingers steady pressure against the small of his back, the hip and the side of him turning Harry around and around. He started to feel lightheaded.
Malfoy rubbed his face with both hands. "Sleep, actually. I'm quite beat, to tell the truth. It's been rather exhausting, these last weeks, overwhelming and emotional," he sighed. "I just want a bed."
Malfoy stopped and panted, then he resumed his thrusts harder and faster than before, making Harry come with a gasp that totally rendered him breathless. Within seconds and just a few more thrusts, Malfoy pushed as far inside as he could and ejaculated violently, with his lips on Harry's neck. They both collapsed on the desk, still entangled in each other's limbs, with sweat and spit and cum all over.
"Well, Pansy's in New York with that dashing American husband of hers. She's very happy, I suppose. We Floo-call occasionally, but that's it, and I was never close to any of the other girls. Blaise is currently on some devious gigolo-tour around the continent, wooing witches with more gold than brains. I haven't heard from him since we met up in Switzerland last year. Greg never leaves his house, doesn't talk to anyone but me, and you know, he wasn't that much of a conversationalist in his best days. And you must have heard what happened to Theo."
In the dark hallways of Hogwarts I used to sneak after him, silent like a shadow. He was usually alone that year, without his thugs covering his back. Sometimes he snapped his head back, as if he could sence my presence, hoping to get a glimpse of whomever was behind him in the dark.
"Yes, Mr Harry Potter, sir." The little elf yanked her ears most distressed. "Miss Narcissa is ready. Miss Andromeda is with her now. But Master Draco will not like this, no sir, not at all."
Minerva McGonagall gave them both a long silent look over her square spectacles. Then she rose and walked over to the crackling fire and threw a pinch of glittering powder into the flames and called out for the Burrow. A sleep-tousled Mr Weasley emerged in the flames, in his pyjamas and with his glasses a little askew.
Malfoy quirked a shoulder but held his gaze. "Stop hurdling around moral judgements, will you. You don't know anything about my situation."
He was only in his underwear and with his t-shirt half-way over his head, when the curtain was yanked open. "Not bad, not bad at all, Draco. Wherever did you find him? Buried out on the Wiltshire moors?"
"Trust me, Pipsey," Harry said comfortingly. "He'll be mad at me, not you. And it's for his own good. And the baby," he added with a securing smile. "Now go and see to your mistress. There's a Portkey for the three of you, make sure you don't miss it. Draco and I will come right behind you through the Floo."
Harry kept his eyes at Rose and tried to ignore the heat that crept up on his neck. "I don't know, really. He's changed, that's for sure. It's nice talking to him, easy to make him laugh and he's actually quite funny. He's clearly very good at his work and more Muggle oriented than most witches and wizards. I liked spending time with him." He dared to cast a quick look at Hermione, as the blush reached his cheeks. "And he's got a very nice arse." Hermione quirked an eyebrow. "I'll pretend I never heard that," Ron shouted from the kitchen, "or I'll never be able to go out and have a pint with you again, mate." Harry and Hermione locked eyes and burst out laughing.
Hermione Granger and some of the other Muggleborn, had insisted that they all should wear Muggleclothes with a Christmas theme, and he felt quite satisfied with himself when he left the Slytherin dorm in a crisp white shirt, black pants and a dark blue velvet waistcoat, embroidered with silver stars. Not entirely Muggle, but close enough. They had all been in schoolrobes for so long and he knew he looked good, as he entered the room, and that's when he saw him, clad in a pair of lowcut worn out jeans and a green T-shirt with a stupid reindeer printed on the front. The reindeer's nose sparkled bright red and the shirt was a little too tight and a little too short, and it made him furious. Draco sneered at anyone who tried to talk to him and soon nobody even bothered, so he was left alone with a dark frown, in the corner of the sofa, drinking several cups of eggnog and watching the people dancing among the snowflakes. Or rather; he watched someone dancing.
The boy scurried away up the staircase. "Don't make too much noise in the stairs," Harry called after him. He walked into the room and placed the baby in a high-chair at the table-end, collected the drawings and coloured crayons, and gave her a red plastic spoon to play with instead.
Justin also pulled one over his head. "Everyone; my 'Coming Out-shirt'!" He smiled widely as the word
"Harry!" Hermione sat up straight and looked directly in his eyes. "Tell me again,exactly what happened and how it felt."
"I thought we could have a civilized chat over a civilized coffee, like civilized men," Malfoy continued and lounged back in his seat while he ran his fingers through his hair. The blond strands immediately fell back over his forehead like a silky curtain. He looked far to elegant in this vulgar setting.
"You didn't put that in your review, I hope," Malfoy had chuckled. Malfoy had been right, the awkward tension between them had subsided after Harry's orgasm, and they stood in the hallway and actually talked. But nothing more happened after that, and Harry was just a tiny bit disappointed.
"Right. Yes," Harry stuttered. He heartfully thanked Mrs Malfoy, and walked them to the fireplace. "Floo-call me later, will you," he shouted after Draco, as he vanished in the green flames.
"I don't know," Harry said, "he sounded honest enough to me. I do think he is a different person than what he was at school. He told me he even went to a Muggle univerity. Besides, wouldn't he have to produce his wand at some point if he wanted to hex me?"
Harry ran downstairs, past the empty space where there used to be a wall with a vicious portrait. With joint wands, Butterbeers and a lot of laughs, Harry, Ron and Ginny had torn the wall down with a loud
He cried out and came with ropes and ropes of cum as he collapsed on the bed, and then Malfoy came as well, and Harry felt the warmth of his release filling him up. He could feel Malfoy grow limp on top of him, still inside him.
one of the other grey-haired ladies snapped and a roar of laughter errupted. Harry saw this as their chance to evade.
They walked to a small quiet street with rows of tiny boutiques, not to any of the big department-stores Harry usually went to when he needed something new. "In here," Malfoy said and opened the door to one of them.
Harry looked around and was pushed in the back by one of the over-exalted football fans. "I don't dare cast a silencing charm in here, it's too crowded," he yelled and lifted the last shot. "Let's finish these and go somewhere else."
"I can never leave my family." Harry gulped. His feet felt frozen to the floor and his knees were jelly.
"Try it yourself, you berk," Dean Thomas huffed at Seamus and crossed his arms. He must have sprinted through the changing room to already be seated at the table in the Great Hall.
Harry glared at her. "I can't see what's so funny about it," he muttered. "You'd think they had other things to gossip about by now."
"Nice party, Potter." Harry could hear the smirk in his voice. "Do you all drink like this after every catch you make?"
Harry gulped and a thrill rushed over him and prickled his skin. His cock began to fill. Damn Malfoy and the things he made Harry want.
Harry smiled and pushed one of the shots over to Malfoy and put one in front of himself. "I'll start easy. Did you really know it was me that time at the Manor?"
On their way out Malfoy grabbed Harry's arm and pushed him violently against the wall. "Potter, you son of a bitch, you tricked me."
He got up and crossed the room and stood directly at Harry's side. The rest of the group was silent, watching, except for the children, Hugo in his mother's lap and Rose in the highchair at the table-end. Hugo was making happy gurgling noises and Rosie was drawing with her magical colour-changing cryons, singing a little tune, both unaware of the tension in the room.
"It doesn't matter, you know." Draco looked Harry in the eyes and removed the shirt. "I love you, Harry Potter, and whatever you look like; skinny, round, square or bloody pear-shaped, it doesn't matter."
Harry proceeded to feed the little girl as Ron went over to the stove to look at the Shepherd's pie in the oven. He was getting to be a rather good cook these days, Molly taught him. He had no choice, really, if he didn't want to starve, since Hermione refused, relying on take-away and pre-made frozen dinners. "I have more important things to do with my time," she said when he asked her. "I only need to eat, I don't care if it tastes good or not." But Ron did, so he cooked.
"For gays. Men that are… gay." Harry could feel his face flash red and tried to hide it behind the beer-glass. "Because you… erm… you're gay?"
"But not enough." Draco stood and faced Harry. "Not enough to let the world know your dirty little secret. Not enough to stand in front of the whole wizarding world and say: Hey, I've chosen a Death Eater as my lover."
"He's very sensitive, you know." Luna had her usual dreamy look as she spoke and she waved her wand over her head, creating a flock of fluttering butterflies. Rose clapped her hands and squeaked of joy over the magic. "If you love him, how are you going to win him back again?"
Then it developed into a rather heated debate on "One should never assume anyone's sexuality," and "How, in Merlin's name, were we supposed to know?" and the game ended for that evening. I didn't want to get involved, so I got up and went to bed.
The transformation was immediate. When Harry came up a few minutes later Lily was all sunshine and laughter, happily playing with a plastic pink unicorn, splashing around in the water.
Harry flushed red of embarrassment. He was going to become a monk. Yeah, that was it. A hermit monk, who met nobody. He wondered if there were any wizard monasteries. A calm secluded place where you could preform magic, play Quidditch and where there were no girls, only men. Men with strong arms, flat chests and broad shoulders, men like Malfoy. Oh bugger, he was really fucked, wasn't he?
Harry relaxed. He closed his eyes and savoured the sensation of Draco's lips and hands on his body. "Marry me," he blurted out.
Draco took the stairs in a few long strides and peered into the living room, where the Potter children were allowed to play. He met the sight of a very upset and angry Harry, with a ferociously screaming baby at his hip and with a firm grip on the upper arm of his eldest son. Harry turned as he noticed Draco coming up.
"There's wizard families that has lived on the estate for generations, and they're depending on me to make us all prosper. The Bulstrodes have their dairy right down that lane over there. They make the best cheese in all Wizarding England, if you ask me."
Harry took a sip of the amber draught. "Perfectly right." He'd had time to look around the place while Malfoy was at the bar and had noticed the all-male clientele and the rainbow-flag behind the counter. It was a gay bar. Malfoy had taken him to a Muggle gay bar, where he obviously had been before.
"Naturally," Malfoy sneered. "How silly of me. You're the Boy-Who-Lived-To-Do-Anything, aren't you?"
Madam Pomfrey took one quick look at his nose, "Well, nothing seems to be broken here, but the cartilage is crushed." She gave him a potion. "Who did this to you?"
the need to get close to the boy in front of him. He couldn't help but to furtively reach out his hand and take hold of that moving hip. It was immediately shoved away, and Harry met Malfoy's eyes, darkened with anger.
Harry nodded. He felt awkward as it was, standing there stark naked with a semi, when Malfoy still had all his clothes on. Malfoy folded the cloth and tied it over Harry's eyes. Unable to orient, Harry stretched out his hand and Malfoy took it in a firm grip and helped him into the tub.
Harry squinted at the little glass vial she handed him. The liquid was pearly-white with a touch of purple and it smelled of lavender.
"Wait!" Harry scrambled to his feet and made his chair fall back with a loud thud. "What do you mean? That I won't see you again?"
Harry swallowed loudly. What was he up to here? Was he seriously thinking about having sex with this man? How did he put himself in this position? But it was for the sake of a baby, a baby he wanted so much. It dawned on him that he hadn't been exactly truthful towards Malfoy about how this could also work, and he pictured what was hidden in his kitchen drawer and blushed. But Malfoy was right, an erection was required either way.
A light tap was heard on the windowsill and Lucius waved his hand to wandlessly open the window for the majestic-looking bird that perched there. She flew in and delivered the morning papers beside the steaming teacup. Lucius patted the tawny head and she ruffled her feathers for him before she gracefully accepted the the treat that was offered.
He would have to start all over again, find someone new who was willing to help him. Another pureblood wizard. Perhaps he should ask Charlie after all. He was a nice man, and very fond of his nieces and nephews. But somehow the thought of it made a taste of bile rise. He screwed his eyes shut and groaned. It wouldn't be the same as with… Malfoy.
Harry turned and gave her a reassuring smile. The tomato-sauce simmered in the pan, sending appetizing whiffs of basil and white wine. Harry grinded the pecorino and tipped it over the tomatoes. "It's fine. You go and have a great time. I'll owl Ron or some of the others. It's been ages since we had a night at the Pub." He stirred the spagetti again and checked the timer on his wand. "This is ready. Let's eat."
Harry stared at the sphere morphing around like some wierd jellyfish. He had difficulty making out what the Healer had showed him, but there was something there, a tiny hand clutching its fingers.
Malfoy sat quiet for a long time. He sighed and glanced over at Harry, his eyes a little moist. "I was such a mess after the war. We were put in house-arrest, my mother and I, with no wands, no house-elves, not allowed to do any magic, not even simple household spells, for three month in wait of our trials. After that it took me quite some time to get around and start using my magic again.
The grip on his arm tightend and he found himself being dragged into one of the corners, which was sufficiently used for snogging at this late hour of the party.
"Well, you do. And so, does he. You should at least talk to him." She gave a nod at the direction of the lake. "He's over there, waiting, I guess."
Harry took a deep breath and lowered his mouth on the tip of Malfoy's cock and took it in as long as he could. As he gagged a little, he released it again and licked the tip free of pre-cum, the unfamiliar bitter taste filling his mouth. He licked and kissed the silky side of it down to the balls. They were beautiful too. Everything about Malfoy was bloody beautiful and smooth and tasteful. He gently licked his balls as well, and felt his own erection striving to be freed and noticed. He shifted a bit and loosened his right hand from Malfoy's hip and took his own cock in his hand. He resumed to sucking Malfoy's shaft, taking it deeper into his throat and ignoring the gagging reflexes. In a daze, he heard Malfoy's voice, unsteady and breathless, "That's right... Oh, Heavens, yes… So good… Yes…"
"Get away from me, Potter," Malfoy growled over his shoulder without stopping, and hastily decended the stairs. Harry more fell than ran after him and got hold of his arm as they reached the sixth floor. Malfoy spun on his heels and faced him with eyes narrow and flashing with anger. "What in Salazar's name were you trying to do? It was bad enough as it was. Do you want to get us outed in front of the whole school?"
Later, when he went down to the Great Hall, there was an owl waiting for him with a letter from his mother, asking him to come home.
Potter pulled back and his impossibly green eyes met Draco's. He huffed a short laugh. "Wanted to say something?"
Harry gave him a sceptical look but put his cup down and folded his hands in his lap. He didn't like the idea of having the grumpy old elf in the house again, but if Malfoy knew anything, it was probably about house-elves. Harry squeezed his eyes shut and mumbled, "Kreacher!"
Malfoy's boot hit his leg. "Are you even listening to me?" He put his glass down and reached for the bag of crisps. "Back to business, Potter. What about you and girl-Weasley? Do we hear the sound of wedding bells anywhere in the near future?"
Harry shifted in his seat, fidgeted a little with his teacup and felt the urge to move, run, scream or somethimg. He got to his feet. "Do you want a tour around the house? I can show you where I plan to have the nursery."
Harry groaned and buried his face in his folded arms on the desk top. He had, in fact, just left Malfoy in the empty Charms classroom. He was still feeling a bit flushed and he was very aware of that Malfoy had bit and sucked his neck quite fiercely when he peaked. That had to leave a mark. "It's nothing, I mean, it doesn't mean anything," he mumbled into his arms.
"Oh, but I do, I've been there before," Harry sniggered. "And it will fit, if you stay real close and follow every move I make. Come on, Malfoy, I haven't got all night."
"Oh, for Merlin's sake," McGonagall muttered and with a few flicks of her wand and some mumbled incantations she mended Harry's lip and Malfoy's nose. "You might as well sit," she said, and a pair of chairs flew up to them from their position at the wall.
Harry shook his head. "Not until Lily's away to Hogwarts, and by then I'll be both too old and too heavy for active duty, I reckon." He sighed and slapped a hand on his belly. "If I don't get a grip of it by then, that is. The way it's going, I'll never get laid again, ever. I'll become this pathetic fat divorced bloke who used to be famous for a while."
"Is that why you came to live a half-Muggle life? I mean, University studies, Muggle clients and other things? Mobile phone? You must admit, it's a little surprising?"
Harry tried to concentrate to get work done, but he felt uneasy and restless. After his fourth turn to the loo and his third cup of tea, he decided that it was no use. "I'm not feeling well, probably coming up with a cold or something," he informed the group of Aurors that remained in the office. "I'll go home for the rest of the day."
"Welcome to the Snake-pit," Blaise retorted with a wry sort of smile that made his teeth blaze, and he knew by experience effected witches of all ages. At least it used to. What he wasn't used to at all, was the way the warmth in her eyes made his stomach churn and his oesophagus clench up. He cleared his throat and let his eyes sweep over all of them. "Can I tempt you with something to drink?"
Draco cringed, and Harry removed his hand instantly and looked away. But Draco was fast and caught his hand again. "No, no, don't get me wrong, it's the
The platform was packed with people, but the tall wizard meandered effortlessly through the crowd. He was walking beside a dark-haired woman while a young boy pushed a loaded trolley, complete with a trunk and owl-cage and everything, chatting excitedly and pointing. The woman gave the boy an affectionate smile and Malfoy's hand came up and patted the boy's blond hair. The boy could have been Malfoy reincarnated at the same age.
"Taking advantage of you," Harry smirked. He laughed quietly when he saw the gobsmacked expression in Malfoy's face. "Relax," he sniggered, "I suck at Potions, and I could really need a better grade if I want to make it into the Auror Academy. I thought you could help me with that." He leaned in a little closer and whispered, "I'm sure I can make it worth it."
"How did I get here?" Draco tried stalling. It sometimes helped, while he forced his brain to start working again.
"All right," Malfoy said and put his glass down. "Give me one of those potions and ask your question."
The tall Slytherin came up and stood right by his side. "I can't imagine what I'm doing here, though."
"Wasn't he at Hogwarts for that at the same time as you, 'Mione?" Ron asked. "How was he, then, after the war?"
He couldn't help but sneer. "No, you're not. In fact, I think that you, as well as everybody else here, are quite pleased. Give me the curtesy not to pretend otherwise, at least."
Why did this dance with Malfoy bother him so much? It was only a bloody dance, wasn't it? Slowly his heartbeat went back to normal and he raised his head.
Harry watched the two blond women, with their big boobs bouncing, lick and suck the enormous, almost purple dick, moaning and gasping, their bright red lipstick perfectly in place. He usually never got this far, he'd never really watched it before. The sound alone used to be enough to get him off, but Malfoy's presence had a rather intimidating affect.
Potter sat up, searching his face. "It can come in handy, sometimes." He hesitated a little. "Would you like to stay for a while?"
"Whatever you say, Harry." He exhaled. "I only hope you're not doing something you'll regret later, that's all. Because, once the baby's born, there's no way to back out."
made him give a deep sigh of relief, but before he could manage to duck out, he felt a firm hand on his middle holding him back. A quick glimpse at Millie Bulstrode's smirking face made his gut churn, but a strong arm pulled him backwards. Harry turned.
"Poor Greg," Draco's voice cracked and he cleared his throat. "He couldn't bear using his wand again after the war. McGonagall offered him the position. He seems quite happy here, all things considering."
"Don't you think we had enough of that last time?" Malfoy leaned in and his breath whiffed Harry's ear. "Apart from that, I have the ulterior motive of possibly get you in bed later, and I don't want you to be able to blame it on the wine afterwards." Harry felt his cheeks flush bright red, but Malfoy slid back into his chair and started to fill Harry's plate with the deliciously smelling hot food. Harry sighed with contentment when the aromas filled his nose. He could never turn down good food, not after being starved all those years.
Harry shook his head. Not this time, not anymore. This was it, the dream that had been him and Ginny was over.
Thursday came the next week, and even as I'd decided I'll never go there again, it was just like Hogwarts sixth year all over again; I couldn't keep away. I ordered the same beer from the same bartender and sat down at the back of the room. There were more guests than last week, most of them male.
"Oh, but you see, I think I do. The more I think about it, the more it makes sense. Everything fits. The way we were drawn to each other from the start, the way I FEEL. I'm going out of my mind here. I really believe there is something between us. Please, Malfoy, tell me, is your wife your soulmate?"
Luna waved her wand again and a flourish of stars erupted over her head. "I think it's very romantic," she stated.
"Hmm, well." There was a faint flush on his face. "It won't make up for the past sins of my father, but still." Malfoy cleared his throat. "Shall we proceed with the real problem, then?"
"Here," he said and stroke his fingers over her wet face. "You're safe to cry here. I won't tell." He tried to express himself so she'd understand that he knew how she felt. "I guess it must've come as a shock to you, him liking blokes."
"He caught the Snitch," Harry said dully. "It was right in front of me, and he caught it, just the same." The new Hufflepuff seeker, a 4th year boy Harry hadn't bother to learn the name of before today, had made a lightning-fast turn and ended the game after twenty-three minutes.
"No," he said and tried to maintain some sort of dignity in his voice. "But I knew it was something fishy about that potion Seamus made Harry drink. Remember? It all fits."
Harry looked up and felt disappointed. "You're not going to..." He peered down on his now fully hard leaking cock, who was eagerly anticipating Malfoy's mouth.
His pale eyelashes formed perfect half-circles on the sharp cheekbones, and they fluttered a little as he heaved long even breaths. He didn't exactly snore, but a small sound came out with every puff of breath. The blond hair, almost white in the shadowed room, had fallen forward in front of his face. Sleep created a softness to him that he hid so well when awake, behind that mask of sneers and loftiness. He was truly beautiful.
There was a pause. "No," Malfoy finally answered,"because, honestly, I don't know what there is to tell." They sat in silence, looking expectantly at each other. "And if it were," Malfoy continued, "I'm not sure that telling my father would be my first choice."
Harry laughed. "Even so, it's been… nice." He produced a hand across the desk. Malfoy looked at it, and then his gaze met Harry's. "Yes, it was nice… meeting you again… Harry." He took the hand.
"Why not? You saw how I was treated back there." Malfoy turned dark. "Everyone in the Wizarding World seems to have taken upon themselves to make sure that I never forget what I am and what I've done, and that they all think I got away too easily. No, I leave the acts of altruism to 'Our Saviour'. Although, this thing might possibly be the first selfish thing you've ever done, Potter. Imagine that."
He looked at her, and his eyes, his beautiful silvery eyes, was filled with tears. "Oh, Pansy," he sobbed and pressed his quivering lips together into a firm line.
"I know it's my sodding birthday." He stood now. He had his hair loose and it fell to the sides, touching his shoulders. "Who let you in? This place is warded against you."
Hermione furrowed her brow, like she usually did when she had a tricky thing to solve. "No, I agree with Harry, I don't think he hexed you. But as you don't seem ill at all, could it be some other spell? Something someone cast on you that you don't know about? You do meet the most suspicious witches and wizards in your line of work."
"You shouldn't just mix potions," Neville said solemnly. "That's not real research, it's only tampering. I'm sure that's not what Slughorn meant when he told us to seek new uses for existing potions. You don't know what the effect might be."
"Oh, he is," he said and handed Harry one of the cups. He came up close, awfully close. Harry could feel heat radiating from his body. He must have splashed some water into his face too, there were droplets hanging from the tips of his fringe, darkening the colour of his hair.
Harry was glad the unsteady walk into the other room was only a few paces. He assumed it was a bedroom, at least it felt like a bed, the soft thing Malfoy made him sit on.
Harry's emerald green eyes met his and the sparkle in them were mesmerizing. "Oh, Ron, you know I'm tits over arse for him, right?" He snickered a little embarrassedly. "What do you think, will he kill me if I join him on the dancefloor?"
"Anyway, it's solved now, my task is complete. You can let your family move in without me lurking about with my vicious relatives." A smirk, hard and cold, was back at his face.
"Not there," Harry said, shaking his head. He lowered his wand-hand and seemed to search for something on the flagstone floor. "Not there. Wrong scent."
Harry put the book down and finally looked at her. Her eyes were sad, her warm brown eyes, usually so full of spite. He had always loved the way her eyes sparkled of life. "I didn't know what to tell him. Do you?" Ginny asked, apparently fighting to keep her voice steady.
Malfoy clicked his tongue and shook his head. "Like last time? No, I want you relaxed, not comatose. Wine is what you get."
"I believe this is yours." A suntanned hand passed him a bottle of ink. Thankfully, it hadn't smashed and covered everything in a black splatter this time.
Harry rested his sweaty brow on the cold porcelain rim of the toilet seat. It was far from clean and not nice at all, but it still felt good. Besides, he couldn't
With shaking hands Harry removed the last garment on his body and stood completely naked in the center of the room. He felt exposed. Malfoy was fully dressed in a black shirt and black woollen trousers, that clung to his hips. He was sexy as hell; Harry only felt stupid.
Back on the busy London street, Harry glanced left and right at variuos pubs and restaurants before he cleared his throat. "Fancy having a drink or eat something, Malfoy?"
"Well, you owe me, that's for sure," she snorted, "going all Slytherin on me like that. How come Ginny Weasley looks the way she does, and she had three? It's not fair."
"Oh, this is just getting better and better," Blaise chuckled. "Wait till the Prophet gets hold on this, they'll go abolutely crazy. THE SAVIOUR AND THE DEATH EATER, I can just see the headlines."
Harry felt awful. He lay face down on his couch, his hands clenched into fists. He'd been crying. After the Dreamless Sleep had worn out, he had cried the whole night and a good part of this day too until only the pain remained. His baby was gone. Maybe it was a little boy, like Malfoy had said. He didn't know.
"Oh, the usual; blood-purifying the wizarding population, obductions, torture and Unforgivable Curses," Malfoy deadpanned.
"I'm sorry for all this trouble, professor, but there's something that I need to say." Harry talked slow and hesitant, and kept his gaze on Malfoy, who didn't move, though Harry could see his jaw-muscle clench. "Something I have to tell Malfoy, something important. I've tried, but as you can see Malfoy and I aren't that good at talking. What happened tonight was stupid and immature, and I don't think any of us wants to be like this anymore."
No. No, he had no right to look at Malfoy that way. Harry felt his stomach churn and clenched his fists. Justin was cocking his head slightly with his eyes fixed at Malfoy's and he laughed again.
Ron turned around and his gaze fell on Malfoy, who stepped in through the door, looking somewhat disshevelled, his hair tangled and a heat burning on his cheekbones. "Was he outside too? Have you two been fighting again?"
"Well, this explaines it." Ron pointed at Harry with his fork, his mouth full of chicken. "This explaines why it's never been fun to watch girls with you when we've been out together. Ouch!" Hermione sent him a light stinging-hex on his ear. " I said watch, not touch."
"We're taking her home. That was the deal the whole time," Draco answered. "Well, we should be going, then," he added. He seemed hesitant and looked undecipherable at Harry.
"Gin's been sayin' you seem to be having a mid-life crisis, or something." Ron handed Harry a bottle of beer. "Anything you want to talk about?"
The realization had hit him when he thought everything was ready for meeting Malfoy. He'd been absentminded and brooding, both at work and when he got home, ever since his encounter with Zabini earlier in the day.
"Finally." Pansy Parkinson growled. "I don't think I could've taken another term of 'Potter this' and 'Potter that'. I was seriously thinking of hexing them tonight." She turned to the third girl,  "Nice touch there, Weasley, moving the door."
When he was out of sight, Pansy turned to the closed door again and with a voice of strength and resilience, that only the few people closest to her knew she had, she hollered, "I think I know what happened, Draco. Talk to me, damn it."
Hermione shrugged her shoulders. "He kept to himself, I guess. I didn't see him much, but now when I think about it, I don't think he was doing very well. He passed with excellent grades, though. Unlike some people," she couldn't resist to add, with a frown at Harry and Ron.
Potter was silent for a long time. "I didn't lie, you know," he eventually said. "I do like the way you smell."
"That's enough," Harry roared. "Shut your mouth, you evil old bag." He yanked the drapes and covered her up again. "I will not have you insult my Godfather or my friend like that." He gave a sigh as there was silence again.
"What in Salazar's name, is that supposed to mean?" Draco snapped his head towards him and immediately felt blood trickling down his upper lip. He lifted his chin again and pressed the ice to the bridge of the nose. It still hurt like hell.
in which you insert a drop of blood from the child and the name of the mate appears to be read." He put his cup down at the coffee table with a distinct clink and straightened his neck. "Didn't you know this?"
"I had trouble sleeping last night, after all. Otherwise, I feel fine." Harry wished everybody could stop asking. "I just want this to be over, that's all."
They sent away Harry's owl and had breakfast. After a very long shower, where Harry scraped his knee on something sharp on the floor.
Malfoy took him by the arm and searched his eyes, his silver-grey holding Harry's unfocused green. "Was that what you wanted all along? Why in Salazar's name didn't you say so?"
He got sight of that trademark blond hair at the far side, where the signing podium was, deep in discussion with Roger Davies, about that awful book undoubtedly. Malfoy was leaning into the other man, showing him something on a page, smiling at him, not smirking, genuinly smiling! And Roger Davies, with his perfect hair and perfect teeth and perfectly broad shoulders, smiled back.
"Well, then," Healer Smith beamed. "I can only wish you the best of luck, Mr Potter, and that the next time I'll see you, it will be a very happy occation, indeed."
"When she was young, they still held Coming-of-age-balls for the pureblood witches. That's where she met my father. She'd known him at Hogwarts, of course, but he was more Aunt Bella's friend. The two of them had just recently joined the Dark Lord, together with Bella's husband and brother-in-law." His voice wavered and he clenched his fists. "Mother told me, when Lucius arrived at her ball the room fell silent. He was dashingly handsome, full of confidence, prospects of a brilliant future ahead of him and he managed to completely sweep her off her feet. She fell madly in love with him."
Harry took a swig from his bottle of Butterbeer and looked around the room. Quite a large crowd had occupied the dancefloor and hopped around like maniacs, waving their hands in the air, singing along to the lyrics. Another group had gathered around the makeshift bar in the corner, laughing and drinking, some of them looking a little tipsy already. In the plush sofas along the walls, couple who were dating had started snogging sessions.
Harry shook his head and cursed the day he stopped reading the Prophet and lost track of the latest gossip. His eyes wandered over to the two men at the other side of the room. He wondered if Malfoy knew, and why it mattered at all.
Malfoy eased the grip around Harry's throat and slipped his arm down Harry's chest, down to his abdomen. Harry's pulse picked up speed as Malfoy's hand worked its way inside his pyjama shirt. Tonight it was Harry's turn to have to pretend to go to sleep before sneaking out of the dorm. The contact of the warm hand on his naked skin sent Harry shivering. He made a snappy turn and faced Malfoy.
Draco took a couple of long strides over to the woman. "Mother," he said and bent down to kiss her. "I want you to meet someone." He took her hand in his. "Mother, do you remember Harry Potter?"
It was a slow and unpleasant walk to the hospital wing, and none of them felt the need to small-talk. Not until Weasley cleared his throat with great care and finally said, "So, Malfoy, you and Harry, eh?"
Harry tried to get his bearings as he came out of the hearth in the warm kitchen. The smells overwhelmed him and gave him a knot in the gut that was part love and part guilt. Christmas at the Burrow, he wasn't sure it'd been a smart thing to accept the standing invitation, but here he was.
It all begun with Harry and Malfoy. They came back to school, and to everyone's astonishment they started to have their meals together; lunch at the Slytherin table, dinner at Gryffindor. Sometimes they sat together in classes too, like they had some secret pact of becomming friends after that disastrous Yule-party in the Slytherin common room. They must've gotten a stern reprimand from the Headmistress when they were taken to her office, kicking and bleeding, but surprisingly no detention for either of them. That McGonagall had a soft spot for Harry was understandable, but Malfoy? He was the one who started the fight, after all. It was weird.
Harry knew the house had felt dark and desolate even with Kreacher living in it, but he decided not to go with that. "I thought you just said you were no expert on Magical transportations," he said instead, in an attempt to joke."
"I love my home," Draco said, a bit husky. "I love the way the ripe barley feels under my hand, the sound of the pheasants in a misty autumn morning and the way all the windows on the west facade turns to gold in the sunset. I could never live anywhere else, and I would like my son to live here and learn to love it too. If you want, you could stay here. There's plenty of room."
Harry felt Malfoy's hands on his buttocks, his strong hands cupping the globes, parting them, exposing Harry's most intimate place. "You're so wonderfully tight now, Harry, but you will open up for me, you'll see." His breath ghosted over Harry's naked skin.
Harry hesitated at first, but then he darted around the table and sat himself in Draco's lap, straddling him. "You liked me." He cupped Draco's chin in his hands. "You like me."
"You have no idea in what state everything was in after the Snatchers and the rest of Voldemort's riff raff left the premises. It was a complete mess and it took me ages to get it all back together again." Harry and Draco crossed the vast garden over to a clutter of buildings not visible from the house. It was a lovely spring day with a mild wind and the sun broke through the clouds with a promise of better days ahead.
"Yes," Harry also stood. "Come for dinner next week. Thursday? The house will be full of children, but I assume that's all right. You know I come with this package deal." They walked together to the hearth. "And come by the Floo next time. It's wierd having you knock at my door."
Harry sighed. "I don't, but it was a kind of emergency. Ginny demanded I get them out of the house for the night, and I couldn't really refuse since the kid's rooms are ready for them. You won't be able to work today, I'm afraid. I put the strongest silencing spells I could think of on Mrs Black, but they have to be renewed every other hour." He turned and begun to take things out of the larder to the workbench.
Harry unfolded his cloak and turned to Malfoy. "Come here. Put your arms around my waist and be sure not to stand up straight. You're taller than me and we better be careful, so that out feet don't show."
I was hungry and there wasn't anything in the house. I can go out for a bit to eat, can't I? Not that I needed an excuse or anything. I can do what I want. I ignored the fact that I every other day in the week had ordered Take-away.
"With this?" Harry laughed and slapped his gut. He wasn't getting any smaller. "Not happening. I love my life now, Ron. Can you believe that? I'm really happy. Happier than I ever thought possible."
"Very funny, Parkinson," Potter snarled and shoved her with his shoulder on his hasty way down. Draco slammed the door shut after him.
When the silence had stretched out between them for some time, Draco had to ask the question that kept nagging at the back of his mind. "You honestly want to have a child... with me?"
"It's too dry, you need the lube," Malfoy remarked, "and I'm afraid that's in my dressing gown at home." Harry paused and thought. He had used saliva when he put his first finger in, but it wasn't enough. Could he summon the lube from Malfoy's house? Possibly, but it would take too long for it to get here. The Manor was in Wiltshire, after all. Anything else? Vaseline? Oil?
As the night went on, Draco lost count on how many times he whispered, gasped and panted Harry's name. With the passion growing, the issue of names became increasingly less important, as primal bodily urges took over. When Draco came violently, with ropes of white cum over Harry's stomach, he cried it, loud and shameless, and collapsed on top of him, pressing him down on the matrass with all his weight. Before sleep took hold of him and he drifted off, he put his lips on Harry's ear and whispered, "I love you too, Scarhead."
"What are you talking about?" Malfoy furrowed his brow and gave Harry a long scrutinizing gaze. "Look, there are many ways of finding out the name of the soulmate. In my family's possessions there was a
"I don't recall giving you permission to come," Malfoy continued with a smirk as he rubbed this thumb over the outline of Harry's prick, making him more aware of the mess in his pants, "but I will overlook it this time. You'll learn the rules soon enough."
"But, what about the game? There's the House-cup match today." He had no intension to miss the game, locked up here in the Infirmary. "I have to be at the Quidditch pitch."
"Well, then," Hermione started counting. "Dean's Muggleborn and Seamus is half-blood." She looked at Ron.
Harry bit his lip and glanced over at Malfoy, who was sitting with his arms crossed and his eyes at a blank spot behind the Headmistress's desk. The wizards and witches on the wall seemed to be heavy asleep in their frames, though Harry had the suspicion that the snoring sounds were slightly exaggerated. Dumbledore's picture was thankfully empty, but Harry caught a glimpse of a curious piercing eye from the small dark portrait of Phineas Nigellus.
"You never do, my boy," McGonagall said and a small smile twitched at the corner of her lips. "You never do."
At the trials after the war, when every feeling was still raw, Harry had watched him walk into the Wizengamot courtroom, supporting his trembling mother, and their eyes had met, and for the first time those grey eyes weren't hidden behind a mask. An honest face was turned up to him and something clicked inside of Harry and he knew what he had to do.
Malfoy didn't move, he didn't run, and he didn't yell bloody fire. Harry let his hand slide even further down and he held his breath. What was he doing? This was crazy. His heart beat so fast it pounded in his ears. His hand had now reached the top of Malfoy's pyjama bottom, and as Harry slid one finger inside the elasticband, Malfoy gasped, "What the fuck are you doing, Scarhead?"
They had returned to Hogwarts for an additional 8th year after the war, all of them damaged and, in one way or other, affected by it. Harry trembled and his legs were unsteady as he entered the Hogwarts grounds, with all its grim memories, but with Ron and Hermione at his side, he managed to walk inside the castle, where everything had been rebuilt to look exactly like it used to. "You see," Ron had said, "it's gonna be just like before." He'd smiled weakly and patted Harry on the back. Harry didn't feel as assured as he'd liked to, but sat down at the Gryffindor table along with his friends and watched a new group of first years get sorted and listened to Headmistress McGonnagall's rather emotional speech. He looked around at the other 8th year students. Most of them seemed to be back, even some of the Slytherins. And among them Draco Malfoy.
on me, but it turned out to be female intuition, which was scary enough as it was. From then on, I was on my own.
Hermione leaned back in her seat on the sofa and furrowed her brow. "That leaves us with the obvious conclution, doesn't it?"
"Oh, they know," Malfoy snapped. "They do now, anyway, after that awful row we had today." He took the bottle out of the bucket and refilled his and Harry's glasses. "But I guess it's more important to them that we form beneficial alliances than their son's happiness. That's what made me want to blow this bloody thing out of my mind, if only for a night. Before I go back and continue to be the obedient son, and smile at Astoria and the whole world at my engagement-party." Malfoy rubbed his temples. "It would have been nice, though, to know what it was like," he mumbled.
"Water in the tub, not too hot, not too cold and not too much." He slumped his frail body against the tile wall, as Draco directed his wand to the faucet and started the water running. He turned back to the baby, whom he had placed on the small table beside the sink. "Now what? I suppose you have to get out of these dirty clothes," he told Lily, whose face was turning purple by the strain of pouring out her frustration and anger. "You're a fierce one, aren't you, Lily dear. I bet you have inherited your temper from both your Mum and Dad." He grabbed the dress she had on and tried to yank it up over her head, but it was too tight.
"But I'm in love with Ginny." This wasn't what he wanted, this wasn't planned. This was not what he imagined things would be. And yet, Malfoy was here, radient and magnetic, and so much… alive.
He had made wonders with the neglected garden at the back of the old house at Grimmauld Place over the years, and he liked doing it mostly by hand, the Muggle way. He'd once been told that some things were worth taking its time, and he had to agree. It was more satisfying and calming this way, like cooking and cleaning, the way he'd learned it as a child. He guessed he had something to thank Aunt Petunia for in the end. Though, she'd be appalled to know he was using dragon-manure.
In sixth year I was obsessed with him. We were like magnets all through our school-years, but with the repelling backsides pushing us apart. In sixth, the magnets flipped.
"You can put your legs down again, Mr Potter," Healer Towler said and removed the plastic gloves, "but stay on the bed. Everything looks fine down there. Your temporary uterus is fully developed. Now, all that's left is for me to cast a few diagnostic spells on the foetus." The Healer raised his wand again and flourished it over Harry's stomach.
"It might not be altogether as you thought it'd be, though." Harry bit his lip, so not to reveal the smile that was tugging at the corner of his mouth.
"I went to the Healer at St Mungo's who's an expert on magical pregnancies, and he told me that my magical core was probably strong enough to go through with it." Harry felt his ears and neck flush pink. "That my magic combined with my father's blood-status should make it possible."
I admit. I cowardly ran out of there. I ducked into the nearest dark alley and Apparated home, even if it's not allowed among so many muggles nearby. I didn't care, I just had to get as far away from him as possible.
The coat of sweat and the sticky mess on Harry's stomach started to get cold. Why was the room so cold? He fumbled after his glasses and found them on the nightstand where he usually put them. Harry looked up at the canape of the fourposter and saw deep green hangings instead of the usual red. He turned his face to the windows and met the eerie sight of dark rippling water. Merlin's beard, he must be in Slytherin.
"He's the other father of Harry's baby," Ron stated and looked at all of them before his blue eyes met Harry's. "And I know you, Harry.
Harry squinted at the board with all the different beverages. "Just order whatever you're having," he muttered irritably at Malfoy's question and sat down at a small table at the far side of the café. He couldn't believe he actually was here. Not after the things he had promised himself, the resolutions he'd made. What had started as a surprisingly pleasant encounter at the bar must have morphed into an alcohol-indused fantasy. But when Malfoy's owl came, he panicked.
"I don't know yet, but before I make any plans I have to start making room for the baby." Harry exhaled loudly and scratched the back of his head. "I can't raise a child in that awful flat. I always thought I'd live in a house when it finally was happening, but things have been a bit... muddled." He grinned at Draco. "I guess I have to go house-hunting, and quick too, if I want to move before the baby's here."
Harry looked at the Minister, who was his friend, then at his boss and his old professor. "I thought…"
She paused and looked at the two gaping faces, and smiled. "The myth goes something like this; in the beginning of time mankind consisted of three different creatures, slightly odd-looking, with four arms and legs, but perfectly happy. There were male, female and a third which was a little bit of both. The creatures were in fact so happy that the Gods got angry with them, for not turning to them often enough with their fears and troubles, and decided to punish them. The Head-God Zeus threw a lightning bolt that split the humans in half, two men, two women, and a man and a woman. The newly separated humans scattered all over and have been searching for their lost half ever since, without whom they can never feel complete and find peace."
Malfoy didn't even try to hide the smirk behind his coffee-cup. Harry winced and fidgeted with his napkin, tearing it into very small pieces.
Potter turned his head and met Draco's eyes. "Could you have killed it? After all the people we know that've died, all the lives that were lost? No, I like to see it as I was handed a gift. It's not how I planned things, but I think it's all going to be all right." He blinked.
Are you seeing someone?" She narrowed her eyes at him as his ears reddened. He walked past her into the kitchen and started making coffee.
Harry pushed Malfoy to the wall beside the fireplace. Harry was stronger, and he held his hands on the Slytherin's upper arms in a firm grip. Avoiding the other boy's eyes, he moved one hand and held the palm on his stomach. Slowly, he trailed it lower. Harry took a deep breath and swallowed, "Actually, I was thinking of something a bit warmer."
"No, I lied about that. I'm sorry." Potter looked rather sheepish. "I don't really know why I kept it. It meant something to me, it was a reminder of… many things. But it's yours and you should have it back."
"You really know these things, don't you?" Potter beamed up at him, his ridiculously green eyes sparkling.
Potter took his glasses off and reduced the light from his wand. They lay there in the narrow bed, not speaking, not touching, and slowly, very slowly Draco began to relax and feel the warmth. They searched each others eyes in the shadows and finally Draco spoke, very quietly, "Sometimes, he couldn't look me in the eyes." Potter said nothing, no need to ask of whom he was talking about.
"I'm way too tired," Harry exhaled and pushed him away, and instead enveloped him in a fond embrace. "Whose idea was it, that we should have our wedding cermony three weeks before I'm due to give birth? And why did we agree to it?"
Harry's head snapped up at Ron's words so fast he could almost hear it crack. Sure enough, there he was, emerging from the haze of the train.
Malfoy drank some coffee and his grey eyes pierced Harry's. "If you think it'll only take one good fuck to get you up the duff, then think again, Potter. Even with the fertility potion it's extremely difficult for wizards to get pregnant, so many variables have to click."
"Are you out of your mind, Potter," he hissed and glanced anxiously back at his circle of friends. Luckily, there was a moments distraction, when a seemingly intoxicated Parkinson threw herself around Zabini's neck, and the only one still watching Harry and Malfoy was Justin. Malfoy quickly strode off the dancefloor, and out of the door. Harry froze two seconds before darting after him.
"I'm only curious why you persist in such a drastic solution." Malfoy rolled his eyes and looked away.
"Now, what do you say when you're a good boy?" He panted heavily and still worked his fingers inside Harry, avoiding, merely nudging that spot of pleasure. Harry felt he was going to explode if it didn't happen.
Al's face was getting suspiciously dark and tears were threatening in his eyes. "I never get to do anything. You'd let Jamie go if it were his friends. It's just because we're Slytherins," he yelled. "You hate us, and I HATE YOU TOO."
Harry had begun weeding and cutting two hours ago, nervous as he was, unable to be still, and sweat trickled from his brow. Draco sat in the half-shadow on the stone-bench under a cherry-tree, reading a book. Sometimes he lifted his head and listened to the soft murmur from inside the house, but since nothing more happened, he resumed to his reading. The cherry blossomed and a single rose-coloured petal had landed on his head that he was totally unaware of, and Harry had to press his lips firmly together and turn his face away to hide the smile that was tugging at the corners of his lips, and a fuzzy warm feeling welled up inside him at the sight of this solemn looking man in his stiff robes.
Malfoy must have heard the crack of Apparition and came out in the hall of the Manor. "My, my, aren't we eager," he chuckled softly at the sight of Harry standing there, shifting awkwardly from foot to foot.
Harry held his breath. Malfoy stirred a little in his sleep and turned to lay on his back, but he didn't wake up. Malfoy was naked. He lay naked in Harry's bed. Harry knew he'd been that before, but this was the first time he could see it with his own eyes, and that made it all more real, somehow. In an instant Harry knew exactly what he wanted.
He wiggled his toes a little to see if he was in one piece, and thankfully they obeyed. As he did so, something stirred behind his back. There was someone there in bed with him.
"He DESERVES to be at Azkaban," Potter screamed, his face red and his eyes black with anger. Draco wanted to yell back, he wanted to scream and kick and hit, Potter or anything, really. He clenched his fists so hard the knuckles whitened. Between tightly pressed lips he hissed, "Where I too belong, isn't that what you want to say?"
With a distinct clinking sound the Headmistress put her teacup down and fixed Harry with her stern eyes. "I thought... that was taken care of," she said and looked puzzled. "Matron and I... we made an appointment for you at St Mungo's."
Harry shook, for various reasons. Anger, guilt, shame and weariness ripped through him. But before any of them could say or do anything more, he withdrew his wand from Malfoy's neck and Disapparated. It was only pure luck he didn't splinch himself.
Potter seemed amused and took hold of Draco's chin and tilted it up. "Did I managed to make the great Malfoy embarrassed?"
Malfoy lounged back and held Harry's gaze. "Best days of my life. It would've been even better," he added sulkily, "if I'd actually caught the sodding thing, at least once, instead of you." He frowned and crossed his arms. "Now, tell me what you're doing instead of becoming the world's most famous Auror?"
Harry sprang to his feet and up to the fireplace. With an inexplicable panic and trembling hands, he reached for the pot with the glittering powder, but Malfoy grabbed his wrist and pressed it against the marble ledge. The sharp angle cut into the skin. Malfoy's body, slightly taller than Harry's, covered him from behind.
"Oh, come now, Harry," Malfoy smirked. "You loved it. You can pretend you didn't as much as you like when you're with your righteous Gryffindors, or back in bed with the She-Weasel, but there's no use lying to me. In fact," He leaned forward again and bore his eyes into Harry's. "I'm here to make you a proposition."
"Now, ride me," Malfoy said and pushed Harry back up so he could move. Harry swivelled his hips a bit to find the right angle, and then he rose and decended, hitting that magical spot inside him that almost made him want to scream of joy. He rode Malfoy, their hands locked together on Malfoy's chest, Malfoy bucking up to him, meeting him in every thrust. The heat started to pool in Harry's lower belly and his toes curled up, when Malfoy tensed and dug his fingernails into the palm of Harry's hands. Harry rode him out, milking the very last of him and rubbing his own erection against Malfoy's stomach and came himself, untouched.
"Can I get you lovely ladies anything to drink?" Harry chimed in, saving Draco from further embarrassment. When they left, the trio was happily chatting and gossiping as if they've been friends forever, but Harry knew they made an effort to move on, to forgive, to forget.
Harry suddenly felt very cold and alone. "Malfoy!" he sat up and called after him. "Can you come back later? Tonight?"
They went to a number of various pubs, where Harry knocked down one or two drinks and promptly wanted to move on to the next, restless and not very good company. After midnight, when the pubs had closed, they walked down to Soho in search for a bar or a nightclub.
Draco rapidly turned his head and met the most intense green eyes in the world. They even sparkled when sleepy.
"What did you take?" Poppy asked Potter. His bright green eyes, enlarged by the glasses, met hers. "I don't really know," he said in a low voice. "Some kind of Amortentia
Harry thought about what Ron offhanded had said about that night, about Malfoy being affected by the potion. Because he couldn't have been, and if he weren't, what did that mean?
"Well," Potter said, and Draco slowly met his gaze. "I guess we both could eat better, and if you didn't wear black all the time you wouldn't look so pale, but… he ran his fingers through Draco's hair again, "I've always loved the colour of your hair, and you have the cutest feral teeth, Ferret. Besides, you're smart, and funny when you're not mean, and your eyes… Potter fell silent and Draco did what he had thought about doing for a very long time, he kissed him.
He came suddenly and violently, unable to hold back the cry that escaped him as he orgasmed, clutching his arms around Potter and shaking. A warm wet patch on his stomach told him Potter had not been far behind.
Ron spurted, but the wall sealed itself in front of him. He banged on it with his fists, but it remained solid and closed.
The drawing room was chilly despite the fire that burnt in the hearth, but Harry felt a strange heat along his spine and didn't mind. Coming here, after all these years, felt wierd in so many ways. If he'd not been drunk, he'd never consider it.
Draco was silent for a while. The truth about what was to come hit him. He too lay down on the pillow again with his wand clutched in his hand. It was all so improbable that he felt as if he was in one of the carts at Gringotts, at crazy speed, totally out of control and with the imminent crash unavoidable.
but the ones on his back were red and ragged at the edges. "My lovely Aunt Bella was very fond of flogging people, both with the wand and a Muggle whip. After your escape from our basement… Well, she claimed it to be my fault, which in a way it was, so..." He showed Harry the inside of his left arm. "And then there's this, of course." The Dark Mark; a little faded now, but still dark and ugly. "You know what I am, what I was, what we went through." He put his shirt back on and closed it again. "I have to pay for this every day for the rest of my life. All anybody see in me is the Death Eater. Except when I'm with you, you see me." He shut his eyes and held his cup in slightly shaking hands.
To divert attention from Draco -thank all Goddesses that the common room was almost empty - she pouted sourly and said, "Been playing strip-chess and lost, Potter?"
"Beautiful." Malfoy's hands were over his body again. "You have such interesting skin, my pet, nicked with scars all over." Hot fingertips roamed lower, touching, caressing. "Strong defined muscles, patches of coarse hair, and at some places," he traced his fingers at the dent right underneath Harry's bottom where it connected to the thighs, so soft." Harry gasped. "So sensitive."
"Brilliant, she ows Harry a favour since she tried to hand him over to old Snake-face." Ron followed the little footsteps marked with Harry's name entering the Slytherin common room. Harry hadn't even bothered with spelling the map closed.
"If he's Harry bloody Potter? Don't think so." His eyelids were getting heavier. Harry raked his fingers through Draco's damp strands of hair. "There's more than sex here, you know."
It was a wonderful Christmas party and the Room of Requirement sparkled. It had been restored after the Feindfyre last year, as one of the last parts of Hogwarts to be rebuilt, and the eight years students, who had helped with the work, now claimed it as their 'in-common' common room.
"Married is not the same as dead." Ron continued to wave his fork at Harry, sending grains of rice all over the place. "Speaking of dead marriages, I love my sister, and not that it's a bad thing, not for her, but Ginny's always been a bit boyish, hasn't she?"
"She mustn't go before I see her." Harry shifted in the bed again, his body was sore all over. "But I wanted to see you first."
"No," Harry shook his head vigorously, rubbing his head on her hair on the pillow. "It was more like... the other way around. I think I begged and wanted him to... you know."
And I thought that was that, that I should be content, that I was lucky to have that much. I never expected to run into you again, so when I was approached by the Ministry about your case, I nearly declined. But my curiosity took overhand, I wanted to see you again. When you told me you were, shall we say, not entierly straight, I toyed with the idea of perhaps having you for one night, to see what it could have been like. I didn't think you knew, you see, because that changed everything."
Draco huffed. "Well, I wasn't wise enough to know what to do with the dirty clothes, so I vanished them. I'm sorry about that." He stopped on his way out. "I'll buy new ones."
"Erm, despite the truce we have and all that," Harry said, his voice sounded croaky, "I'm still not comfortable with you poiting a wand at my bits, Malfoy."
No one demands this much of you, no one. We use this flat as some kind of basecamp, we never do anything together, we very seldom fuck, and you think that having a baby in all this is going to make things better? Sometimes I believe you keep going like this so that you're always too tired to think or feel." She became distant. "Sometimes I think you only like the idea of us together."
Harry swallowed. What could he say? That the sight of Malfoy made his blood burn in ways nothing else did?
She fussed and wiped his face. "Very well, if you say so. But I still have to report this to the Headmistress. Now, lay down on the cot. I'll check on you within the hour."
"Jamie!" Harry stood at the door and looked startled at his eldest son. "That wasn't very nice, was it? Mr Malfoy's an old friend of mine since school. Now, get up and apologise." He shifted Lily to his other hip and watched as James, still sulking, got up and streched out his hand to Malfoy.
There was a shifting movement at the closed and warded drapes and she heard a familiar voice whisper, "Ron, are you awake?"
"Have you any idea how rare and dangerous a male pregnancy is?" he asked. "Did your Healer tell you that you have to live without magic until the baby is born?"
"It happened. But Mother always sent the elves up later with cocoa and sandwiches, when my father wasn't looking."
He stopped the kissing again and for a moment Draco met his eyes, dark of lust with only a tiny ring of green around the pupils. Potter moved his hand over the remaining clothes and mumbled the incantation, "
"Can't you stop calling me that? We've been together, sort of, for almost a year, and in a couple of very short months we're going to be parents. I'm Harry."
"Christmas hols is soon here, then there's less than six months left for us in this place," Blaise continued. "I'd like to take my N.E.W.T.s and get out of here in one piece, if you don't mind. If inter-House unity is what it takes, then I'm all for it."
"Imagine what old Lucius would say, Harry," Ron quipped as he extinguished the light. "And I still don't get how Malfoy became affected by a potion you took."
"Don't thank me," Potter said. "It was wrong of me to keep it. But as I said, it meant a great deal to me, without it I could never have defeated Voldemort."
Every time the little bell on the door chimed, Harry lifted his head, but only strangers went in and out. Finally, a long black overcoat was in sight, the collar turned up against the wind and his blond hair was a bit damp from the drizzeling rain. "Sorry I'm late, but it took quite a bit of apologizing before we could go on with the case." He sat down and let the coat slide off at the back of his chair.
"I'm saying that you are a wizard, a powereful one, and that you could carry a baby yourself. You need a sperm-doner, of course, but essentially, you could start a family on your own, if that's what you want."
So, here they were, crammed up in the comfortable old sitting area by the fire in the common room, watching a game of chess that never seemed to end. Earlier at dinner, Ron had asked Zabini if he cared for a round later, and Malfoy had smirked and muttered under his breath, "Afraid of some real competition, Weasley? So keen on winning all the time you only play the safe ones?"
Draco made a harsh snorting sound. "Do you think I'm some sort of charity case? Do you think that's what I needed?"
"Oh, no," Draco ranted on and begun pacing the floor. "I was a fool to believe he meant what he said when he proffered his hand at me, a fool to think things could be different... Me, being the scum of the Wizarding World." He stopped at the small window. A greyish twig of seaweed brushed the pane. A fool indeed to think Potter had wanted him.
Some were couples, like Ron and Hermione, Ginny and Dean, Blaise and Mandy, and Neville and Pansy. Him and Draco. Then there was Seamus, the only single Gryffindor left among them, the other Slytherins, Millie and Greg, and of course, Luna.
Harry smiled. "Yes, I am, but it's very recent and I try not to get too excited about it yet, after what happened the last time."
Draco took his son from Molly's arms and swayed him slightly, humming a little tune as he rocked the baby. He was going to put him in the cradel for his nap, but he wanted to stay a while, he knew Harry was about to say something. At that moment Harry stood and tapped his wand against his glass.
instead, you idiot." Then he said, "See you around, Potter," and in a blink of an eye, he was gone. Harry fumbled as he tried to pull up his jeans, but instead he let himself slide down to the floor, still panting. Well, that was bizarre, if nothing else.
It didn't stop him from going, though. He wouldn't let it. He kept his head high and his eyes straight forward, and with strides that incorporated all his inherited indisputable Malfoy-confidence, he walked on and tried not to meet the eyes of the by-passers, as he made his round to the various shops. He always apparated in. Once he made the mistake to walk into the Leaky Cauldron to make the passage through the wall, only to be chased out with screams and violent threats. But that was a long time ago now, and so far this day had been without anyone noticing him. A good day.
Harry didn't know what to think, what to feel, as he looked at the blond man in front of him. The wound was still too raw.
Malfoy freed one of his hands from Harry's hip and put it instead at Harry's neck, and with a small sob, he pulled Harry closer. "Oh, bloody hell, Potter!" And he kissed him.
He started walking, his long legs taking one stride while Harry almost had to take two to keep up. They found a bar where more smartly dressed people were talking low and soft music was played at a piano.
Harry would never have a relaxed relationship with food, he knew that. Not after being starved during most part of his childhood and going without food for so long under his hunt for Horcruxes. It had forever damaged his metabolism and growth, and above all, what food made him feel. Food was safety, food was comfort, warmth and rewards.
Harry waved back at her, and then he let his gaze survey the rest of the students at their various House-tables and his eyes rested, as always, at the Slytherins. They were the smallest lot to return.
"We all married very young, Harry." Ron drank from the beer. "Hermione was my first. I guess it's the same with you and Ginny. Everything went so fast after the war, didn't it?"
"It might be late," Malfoy stated. "Don't wait up for me." He left and Harry flung himself back on the bed.
"I need all the help I can get." Harry almost held his breath. This was unexpected. "Would you like to? I'd be very greatful."
Neville was stuck at Hogwarts, as he had the growing Mandrakes to attend, and was head of Gryffindor.
"Yes, you can go up to your brother. He's in the living room watching telly. I call when dinner's ready."
"Eloquent as ever, Potter," Malfoy said and grabbed him by the arm and proceeded up the stairs. "But it's such a treat to have you here again so soon, that I'm willing to forgive your lack of spirited conversation. Come, I want to show you something."
and the dim glow fell over their faces. Harry screwed his eyes shut and the shadows gave him a strained expression. "I didn't know it was even remotely possible," he groaned.
Harry stormed out, bumping into chairs and tables on his way. He could hear Malfoy snigger behind him.
"I got news for all of you," Harry said as he scooped up potato-mash on everyone's plates. "We have to get another bedroom ready. Thank Merlin, there's plenty of them in this house."
"So," Seamus went on. He smiled his trade-mark loopsided grin and his eyes glinted of mischief. "Will you name him after me, then? Since I'm the one who helped create him, an' all."
"So, your Obstetrician says you need a pureblood wizard, since you're half-blood. Well, there's a whole bunch of us Weasleys. Who's your pick?"
Potter made the headiest noices as Draco reached the nest of dark curl that surrounded Potter's cock. Draco buried his nose in them and inhaled, and let his gaze wander up at Potter's face. Potter was biting his lip and holding his breath. Draco opened his mouth and gave the side of the throbbing cock an experimental lick.
Ginny looked baffled. "Gee, Harry, you really got your wand in a twist. I'm not the one who's spreading all these rumours. I'm on your side, believe it or not. Even if we're not..." She bit her lip and searched his eyes. Harry clenched his jaws stubbornly, steeled himself for what she was about to say next.
A youthful looking Healer walked in through the door. He had a short well-groomed beard and light-brown wavy hair. He was annoyingly good-looking, but how somebody could've come up with the idea that lime-green robes were benefitting for anyone was beyond Harry. Especially in a situation where one was ill or injured, or in Harry's case, slightly nauseous as it was.
What had also rapidly become an addiction were his visits at Grimmauld Place, and it scared him a bit how dependent he had become of seeing Potter several times a week. And it's been months now. His work on the portrait was frustrating, but he refused to give up, not yet anyway, and he was very aware of that it was much more than the task at hand that made him long for spending the afternoons with Potter.
"It's been difficult, Molly. I've had a lot on my mind this year. I'll make it up to him, I promise."
Lily was an accident. They had been out celebrating with their friends and was a bit drunk when they got home and stumbled into bed, and Harry forgot to cast the contraceptive spell. Ginny was furious and out of her mind when she found out she was pregnant again. She had worked so hard to get in shape after Albus and had finally been able to sign a new contract with the Harpies after being away from the game for so long. In fact, that was what the celebration had been about that drunken night.
"The same," the man showed a set of crooked teeth in what was supposed to be a hearty smile. "You can't imagine my surprise when my youngest owled us that he had sorted Slytherin together with the son of Harry Potter. I nearly fell off my chair." Flink chuckled. He had become a broad-chested man with an incipient beer-gut. Zabini looked just as lean and tall as he'd done at school.
"Do that," Harry said and laid out the plates. "Did you know that Teddy, her gran-child, is my Godson?"
Malfoy sniffed. "Of course, I did. I would have known you if you were disguised as a Hippogriff." His cheeks pinked a little and he didn't meet Harry's eyes. "That was a stupid question to ask. You know I recognised you the moment they brought you in. At least that's what you said at my trial."
Malfoy nodded. "He'll have all his things and toys like he used to." He slumped down and watched his hands on the table. "I had to go and visit my father," he said with a faint tremble.
"Tell the truth, I'm a bit nervous. As I said, I've never been with anyone but Ginny," Harry said as Draco placed a series of languid kisses at Harry's neck, and started to open the buttons of Harry's shirt. The house was quiet, the kids fast asleep and he had put up the strongest silencing spells on his bedroom. That wasn't what made him tense. He squirmed a little and shoved Draco's hands away. "Are you sure about this? It's not a pretty sight."
Adam choked on his drink and spurted it out, laughing. "Why do you still call each other by last names? You're not in that posh boarding school of yours anymore. You obviously like this guy, Draco. Is he this hilarious when sober too?"
"Don't worry, she's in good hands." Harry tried to put his hand on his arm for comfort, but Draco shoved it off. "Her sister is with her and Pipsey, who let me in, by the way. They should've arrived at the Burrow by now, where Molly and Arthur will make sure she's properly taken care of."
Harry exchanged a glance with Malfoy, who shrugged one shoulder and looked away. "Crisps, please," Harry said. "But not the ones with vinegar," he added quickly.
She shook her head. "Uh-hu. Hannah was curious, so she went to the place Justin told her. And there he was."
Harry let go of Hermione's hand and hugged him. "See you soon, Nev, and give Hannah a hug from me." And then Hermione uttered her address and they were sucked in by the flames.
He put his coffee-cup down and rose to greet him. He wiped a nervously sweaty hand on his jeans-front before he produced it to shake with a sheepish grin. "Hello, Malfoy."
"Only one, Kreacher," Harry said a little taken aback. "But he's at Hogwarts now. He doesn't like me very much." He poured a large amount of milk in his cup. "I guess you can say he's retired."
"Oh dear, oh dear," Harry heard McGonagall through his own uncontrollable sobs and Malfoy's convulsions. "I think they're both in shock. Perhaps it's for the best to take them to the hospital wing overnight."
"But no sex?" Ron still looked very sceptical. Luna nodded. He shook his head. I thought it felt exactly like Luna, though.
"Well, it's required here and think how much better it makes you look at my side in the papers," Malfoy smirked. He had decided that they would meet at one of the most popular restaurants just off Diagon Alley for their first official date.
"Well, you see, the Nightshade mixed with the Ashwinder egg in an essence of Daisyroot makes a pretty strong fertility potion. It's not common, and when it happens this sort of thing is mostly very well planned between long-term wizard couples. I've never, in all my years as a Medi-witch, come across a situation like this."
It got awkward sometimes even with that, but I suppose that's the whole point of the game. As the time when Michael's spin landed on a blushing Hermione, Ron didn't like that one bit, or when Seamus got to kiss Justin, which was just ridiculous since they're good friends and not at all attracted to oneanother. Then Luna was peppering everyone with kisses without even spinning, because, "I'm a very affectionate person and you're all such wonderful people." It got interesting, though, when Theo Nott played and kissed Teresa Boot, hot and eagerly, rendering her shy and breathless. Draco assures me that he's an okay bloke once you get passed that prickly quietness of his. I hope so, she looked so smitten.
Harry looked once more at the note Hermione had pressed in his hand right before he stepped into the Floo. It was late, too late to contact a stranger, but if he had to wait until office hours, he'd never get it done.
"Of course, I'm gay, you twat," Malfoy hissed, "and I must say, you don't seem particularly reluctant to the sex we've been having for WEEKS now! Maybe you should give that a thought or two, it might mean something."
Harry emerged from the shadows of the cloak-room. "Perhaps it's under my name instead. Harry Potter?"
"Last night made me think," he continued, "and I don't want to hide anymore. I want it all." He turned his head back at the fireplace again. "That's why this has to be the end."
They were very close, bodies pressed against eachother, with sweat soaked robes, steaming in the cold evening air, eye to eye and their breaths whiffing each other's faces. Harry shoved Malfoy's chin up a little higher. That's when he felt it, a slight twitch against his thigh and he saw the grey eyes dilate into an almost complete black.
The recognizable ting in his hand was immediate, the grip on the ebony hilt perfect. Hawthorn with a core of unicorn-hair. For some reason he had always cherished unicorns. Not that he had told anyone, of course, but the delicate skittish creatures had always meant something to him, like they belonged.
Two hours later Malfoy gave up and went to see Harry, who was in the kitchen. "I'll have to do some research about this," he said. "But if you like, I can come back and try again."
"Oh, they will be here first thing tomorrow. Teddy wouldn't miss it for the world, opening the presents here with the rest of the family. I hope you bought something nice for him, Harry. That boy has missed you this autumn. We all have, but he's only nine and it's hard for him to understand why his Godfather hasn't had time for him as he used to."
Draco rose from his chair. "I perfectly understand. Take your time, I'll stay away until you say so."
"It turned out I got pregnant." Harry took a too large gulp of his tea to hide his embarrassment and burnt his throat.
Malfoy's lips culed into a smile. "Oh, but it will, Potter. You'll see, you'll be back, begging for it. For me to tie you up, to shag you good and hard. All the little things you've been longing for, fantasizing about. The things you need. The things buried deep inside your soul." He didn't flich as Harry pressed the wand-tip deeper into the softness under his chin and his eyes never blinked.
"Because I couldn't bear the thought of you in prison, that's why." Potter's eyes were susiciously moist and he panted heavily. "Everything was horrible enough, after the war, with so many dead. I couldn't live in a world where there was no Draco Malfoy."
Harry shot a glance inside. Now that the room was lit up by the fire and the candles it gave a totally different impression than it had a while ago. The old furniture seemed to have shaken off their heavy layer of dust and stood a little taller. Even the dark tapestry on the far-off wall glimmered with golden threads and shiny silk.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. "I would like to see you and talk, Harry, somewhere less crowded." He made a vague gesture around the café. "But I am to be with Scorpius this weekend."
Suddenly, a huge bull of a man was elbowing his way through the mass that was pushing in on Harry. With strong bulging arms he tore his way ahead, lifted Harry as if he weighed nothing and carried him to the entrance of the castle. Harry closed his eyes and locked his hands thankfully around the stranger's thick neck.
"Oh!" Draco couldn't help feeling a little embarrassed at the thought of Potter... carrying him? Levitating him?
Harry shrugged his shoulders and sighed. "I felt I was fed up with Dark wizards and Dark magic," he said. "Then Ron dropped out to help George at the shop and Neville got an apprenticeship in Herbology, and it all started to feel awkward and poinless. Being an Auror turned out to be mostly policies and red tape, and that's never been my strong side."
"Don't forget who you're talking to here," Blaise remarked, his voice hardening. "I've heard you wanking and moaning his name since 4th year, remember?"
"Well," Draco said and cleared his voice. "Maybe it's time for us to step down, give the new students the oppotunity to shine. I've thought about quitting the team, already,  with the NEWTs coming up and everything." He paused and added more softly. "I only joined because you did. That was always the fun part of Quidditch, chasing you. Maybe it's time for us to grow up."
"Are you mad?" Malfoy almost shouted. "My father would have known the second I'd let it slip, and I couldn't have that. The comradeship in Slytherin wasn't based on trust exactly. There was no-one I could tell."
"But that's it then," Malfoy said, and to Harry's surprise he dunked a biscuit in his tea and hastily put it in his mouth before it fell to pieces. "That's why you can't light the fires. The house and the elves are connected. That's why this place feels so... empty and desolate. Magical houses needs the elves to function and vice versa."
Draco raised his head and met the intense gaze. The green of the irises behind those ridiculous spectacles was so bright and mesmerising that Draco could have sworn they must have been spelled that way, only to make him, Draco, look like a fool.
It was high time that the boy took hold of his role as a leader in the Wizarding society, and the best way to start doing that was to form connections. A marriage was necessary. Nothing Draco had said could change that.
Potter put his strong wide hand, now slick with lube, over both their pricks and made a circle around them. Then he started to move. Draco dug his fingers into the soft flesh at Potter's hips, he was sure there'd be a mark there later, and buried his face in the crook of his neck. He breathed in the scent that was in every sense masculine, enhanced by sandalwood from the aftershave and a little sweat. The morning-stubble on Potter's cheek scratched the side of Draco's brow and Draco gave a long whimpering sigh. This felt even better than all his imagination. This felt truly
Potter's face darkened. "Believe me, I'd rather empty the entire bowl right now, but thanks to you, I can't," he growled between clenched teeth.
The waiter hardly glanced at the charmed parchment but glowered at Malfoy as he was something foul that'd crept up from the gutter. "It seems to be some mistake, we have no reservation under that name, sir."
Draco turned and went over to the fireplace and the gilt-framed mirror that hang there. He stared at his own reflection. "I'm fully aware of what I am, and I'm not used to compromise that anymore. I am still, at 37, a moderately good looking gay man. I'm used to get what I want and whom I want. Sadly enough, what I want is you." He swallowed and his eyes found Harry's behind him in the glass, just as they had in that cracked bathroom-mirror two decades ago.
Draco let go of Harry's arm and with his head held high he looked over the grounds. Harry could see his Adam's apple move on the long neck as he swallowed.
Ron looked at Harry, searching his eyes. "You really have it bad for that faggoty pink thing over there, haven't you?"
"Ever since then, witches and wizards has been experimenting with different identifying potions and spells, but no one have been able to help the entire human race. They have only worked on individual basis, like the one I made, which we took, Harry."
This wasn't part of the bargain, this wasn't what he'd planned. He'd played a game with high stakes, he knew that, but he had all along thought he sat with the winning cards. How come he now felt as he was loosing?
"She'll be here soon," she said a little sharply and turned back to the work bench. He could sense by the way she kneaded the dough that further inquiring about Ginny was unwise at the moment. Harry always felt he'd let her down when he and Ginny broke up and it was quite clear that she hadn't really forgiven him. Harry changed the topic. "What about Teddy and Andromeda, then?"
"Calm down, Scarhead. I have no intention of dragging you out in public. Do you really think I'd be that sadistic? I just wanted to check on you and see if you wanted some company. I didn't like the idea of you sitting alone, brooding. Have you eaten?" He turned away from Harry and took something out of his pocket and un-shrunk it on the table. It was a wicker picknick-basket.
"So, I always wanted a house full of children." He slammed down the last two plates at the end of the table. "Even if they can be a bit tiring once in a while." He put his head out in the hallway and bellowed. "AL! JAMIE! Dinner's ready!"
"Remember that night in the Forbidden Forest?" Draco swallowed and locked eyes with Harry. "I was so scared, and I had to make Longbotton even more scared. Then after you came to me, all I could think about when we walked around, was how much I wanted to grab your hand and hold it for comfort."
"I just want to see you happy, Gin." He felt his throat tighten, as it always did when he was with her.
The crisp sheet felt cool and smooth against the heated skin of his tear-soaked cheek. It eased all the thoughts that were spinning around in his head. Harry closed his eyes and let the muted sound of the four women wash over him.
"Even before I did," Draco sighed. "He called me a deviant. I didn't know what it meant, I had to look it up. He also told me, that no matter how many cocks I wanted to suck, he still demanded I'd obey the tradition and marry the Pure-blood girl they had chosen for me and produce an heir." He swallowed audibly. "I was fourteen."
"I know that too." Her voice was a bit stern. "But I saw you. I saw you positively melt in his arms, Harry."
When he turned to Harry again he held a rather large bundle of silky ropes in his hand. Burgundy red. He nodded at Harry's underpants. "Take it all off."
Rage flared and Harry sat up promptly. "We most certainly will not," he shouted. The nerve of that troublemaker!
"Things will wrap up soon, anyway. It's a weekday after all. Most of us have school and work tomorrow." Harry bit his lip, but he still asked. "Can I come with you?" Draco only nodded, but Harry felt a great weight lift.
When he returned to Hogwarts, he'd been afraid. He hadn't expected to get the invitation-letter to the additional year in the first place, and it took Headmistress McGonnagall more than one long meeting to persuade him to come back with the others from his year. "No matter what," she'd said, "all students from last year has been given this chance to come back and get a degree." All in the name of the new unity. But he was the only one with the Mark.
Harry took up the crumpled business card from his pocket and turned it over. On the printed side, after all the titles and degrees, it said
Draco rolled over and buried his face in the pillows. Potter came up on his knees and grabbed Draco's hand again. Draco lifted his head and peered at him. His ridiculous hair stood right up on his head and he had this over-excited look, like a puppy wainting for someone to throw a ball at him.
"I didn't talk you into anything. You volunteered, Pansy, remember. I can clearly recall you getting on about your obligation as a pureblood witch and not ever wanting children of your own. You were being the best of friends ever and offered your womb to Harry and me." He caressed her dark hair and added in a much softer tone, "I'll be grateful forever."
"No," Weasley said with a low grunt. "I'll take you, Malfoy." He took hold of Draco's forearm and steered him downstairs. "Go, Harry. I promise, I'll take care of him," he added with a malicious grin.
"Mates," Harry said, still holding the ice and a cloth to Draco's nose, searching for his eyes. "If you havn't noticed, we're a bit naked here and it's kinda awkward. Could we, please, have some privacy to get our clothes on?"
"Alright, alright," Seamus laughed. He rose and backed away with his hands up in defeat. "It was only a bit of a joke."
He grabbed Harry by the arm and tried to pull him up from the bench. He turned to Neville. "Nev, will you take Harry's broom and gear, and follow us up to the common room. Seamus!" he spoke more harshly, and the other boy almost jumped at the change of tone. "You'll go with Hermione to the library and see what you can find out about the mix in that bloody concoction of yours."
"I know. Patience, Potter, patience." He chuckled a little, as he conjured something slippery to his hands. "That's never been one of your virtues, now has it?" He let his finger trail the crack of Harry's arse and dug in deeper, causing Harry to gasp. He found what he was looking for and let his forefinger plunge in. The sensation was overwhelming and Harry's knees buckled. What was happening, what was Malfoy doing to him?
Ron sighed and took a long pull from his bottle. "Well, you have an inclination for Death Eaters, haven't you?"
The pain shot through him like a bolt of lightning and sweat broke on Harry's forehead as he bent over. He gasped and laboured for air. Panic took its grip of his intestines. No, not again. This couldn't be happening. Another pang of pain. No, no, not so close to the delivery-date. He had carried this baby under his heart for almost nine months, he couldn't bear to lose it now.
"Never," Draco yelped. "That's the most preposterous thing I've ever heard." He'd deny it to the day he'd die if necessary. Potter's hot hand moved over Draco's belly and wrapped itself around Draco's cock. The treacherous thing leaped in delight and leaked a pearl of pre-come.
"The Black's home?" He should have known, felt it. Like all ancient magical houses there was a low thrum, a pulsing rhythm. Hogwarts had it, and the Manor, and it was obviously present in this room as well, like a heartbeat.
"You can't do a thing like this, Seamus." Hermione's voice was brimmed with outrage. "It's too much like an Imperius Curse."
"Potter's havin' a baby?" Goyle mumbled from the depths of the soft chair he was sprawled in. "That's nice, in' nit?"
Gawain Robards crossed his arms and put them at the back of his head and leaned back. "Before all this… Before you told me you were to start a family, I planned on giving you a promotion. To let you set up your own team, pick any Aurors you wanted for a special branch of detecting the foulest criminals, be your own boss. It could still be there after the baby is born, if you want it."
They saw how Harry dropped both his wand and the parchment on the floor and walked up to the wall a little bit further ahead. He pressed his palms against it and started to whisper in a hissing wheezing way.
"I'm in love with you." Harry heard how his voice wavered, but he drew a steadying breath and said with more certainty. "All I ever wanted was a family. It's pretty obvious now why it never worked out with anyone. I want to have that with you. I love you. Even with your flaws."
Harry's heart sank inexplicably fast in his stomach. Of course, Draco wouldn't come over the way he had anymore, he'd have more important things to do, no doubt, but Harry had grown accustomed to having the git around. This Draco, that he finally had gotten to know, was funny, had a sharp wit and a fast smile. Strangely, Albus had taken a liking to him and had asked more than once if he could see him again. In Harry's opinion that said something of a man. He really felt he didn't want this new friendship to be over.
"Friends and family," he began, "beloved husband," his vivid eyes met Draco's, "darling ex-wife," he looked down at Ginny at his side, who met his smile with a wide grin of her own. "Tomorrow someone is to embark on his own new adventure and start a different chapter of the glorious journey that is life. Any house at Hogwarts will be proud to have you, I'm sure of that, and we, as your family, have never had any cause to doubt that you'll succeed in all you have the will to do. May your wand be powerful and your charms be swift, James Sirius Potter, and for Merlin's sake, try to stay out of trouble, at least the first week." They all laughed, and Jamie had the decency to look a little abashed where he sat between his mother and Teddy.
She shook her head. "No, it wasn't your fault. You were always treating me the best way. Always kind and considerate and understanding. I hope you've found someone who truly appreciates that, because I didn't." She looked down and shook her head. "Where did the spark go, Harry? The challenge? I hope you'll find it again. I really want you to be happy, you know."
"My, my," Adam said, "that's definitely an improvement. Except his hair. You should take him to Raul's after this."
Malfoy looked around and bit his lower lip. "It's not very far from here, but it's too conspicuous to Apparate there. Come on, Potter," he grabbed Harry by the arm. "I feel like celebrating and I know just the place. Walk or cab?"
"But," Ron turned a baffled face towards her, "if it was a lustpotion, why didn't Harry just jump any of us? Why did he rummage around the whole bloody castle to get to Malfoy?
"What in Merlin's buggering pants is the meaning of this?" Ron barged in and flung today's issue of the Daily Prophet on Harry's desk. It was open on the ceenterfold and a very vivid picture of himself and Malfoy lapsed over and over again, Malfoy kissing his hand and flirting, and even trhough it was a black and white photo, you could clearly see Harry blushing. He hadn't known there were reporters there, but Malfoy probably did.
He sighed a little and took a deep breath. "You're right, Mione." He smiled a little shaky. "I shouldn't worry so much. As soon as I take this, I'll know, right?"
"It's not... I'm not... It's all very new, nothing official," Harry mumbled and rubbed the back of his neck.
"Don't give me that crap. I've had my desk right behind yours in Potions the entire term. I suspected it before, but today it became painfully obvious." He contemplated a moment, furrowing his brow. "For everyone except those imbecile Gryffindork friends of his, I suppose, who still doesn't have a clue. But you haven't fooled me."
"It seems I don't need your fucking t-shirt," Malfoy said. I love it when he swears, the crude words in that posh accent of his. It's hot.
Harry turned and looked solemnly at him. "It scares the shit out of me, you know, not going to Hogwarts anymore, to make decisions, to accomplish things, start a life." He laughed a short humouless laugh. "I haven't got the faintest idea of what I want to do when I get out of here."
They arrived later than Harry had predicted. "I can't go to a party dressed like this," was what Draco had said when he finally gave in. Harry's, "You're perfectly fine as you are," had no effect. But he did his hair up in a bun instead of his usual formal ponytail, as Harry suggested.
"Yeah," Seamus countered. "This'll be fierce. Let's see what he'll do." He propped his elbows up and rested his chin in the palms of his hands, waiting impatiently, like for some rare entertainment to begin.
"Immensely!" Malfoy plastered a wide smirk on his face. His grey eyes glistened as he added. "What I wouldn't give to have a go at the Snitch against you again."
Sitting with an empty plate and a half full glass of wine, his eyes red-stained and puffy, with dark circles underneath. His hair was falling in limp strands around his face. He looked totally dishevelled.
"Do you? Any of you?" Ginny's voice had become shrill and high pitched. "Have you gone mad, all three of you?" She unfolded her arms and gestured wildly with her hands. "You can't possibly want Harry, who's obviously lost his marbles, to have anything to do with Malfoy? This is the peson who let Death Eaters into Hogwarts, who plotted and tried to kill Dumbledore, who almost killed Ron and Katie. Fred..." She swallowed. "Fred might still be alive if it weren't for him and his kind. Don't you remember what he's like?"
"But still, you can't be serious about this, mate?" Ron turned his head from Harry and tried once more with the spoon of mashed carrots, but Rose's mouth was determinedly closed and the food was again smeared all over her face. He sighed and put the spoon down in the bowl with a thud and pushed it away. Feeding Rose was an ongoing war for both her parents. Harry lifted the spoon and looked at the redhaired girl as he put it in his own mouth and made a sound of pleasure. "Mmm, this is so good," Harry teased, and as expected Rose opened her pink lips and reached out for Harry's hand. Ron stood and shoved the carrot-mash over to Harry. "Here, take over this, will you. She only wants to eat when you're around now, anyway."
He placed a hand on Harry's chest. "Remember our Quidditch-matches, up on our brooms," he licked his lips. "It was always only about the two of us, wasn't it? The one I tried to beat; it was always you."
Draco shut his eyes. "I guess I don't care much for straight boys pretending to be open-minded and wanting to experiment with their sexuality."
Draco turned his head and looked at him. "I was about to cast an Unforgivable, Potter," he said and snorted a little through his nose.
I had kissed Susan Bones, which was very nice, she's a very pretty girl, and Parvati, which was a bit tense and lasted no more than a second. I don't think she likes me very much, not since that Yule-ball where, let's face it, Ron and I behaved like dicks. I was sitting there, looking over the circle of participants, and wondering what would happen if my bottle stopped at a boy, and if I got to kiss him then, and how that would feel, and who it would be, when Bulstrode's spun landed on Michael Corner, who's one of the most handsome blokes in our year, and stormed off in a fit.
"Erm, no, thanks," Harry stuttered, and almost breathlessly he added, "We ended up doing it... the natural way."
"No." Harry immediately turned away; his mouth suddenly dry. "We broke it off." Malfoy seemed to have a knack at pinpionting all his sore places.
Harry thought about their strange game day and night, trying to visualize how it was going to be next time, how Malfoy would act. Not once had he felt the need to use the safe-word, even though Malfoy had hurt him pretty bad at times, or strung him up in positions that drenched all his limbs of blood and strength.
"Truth or Dare, wizard style?" Harry grinned. He'd played that game too, in the Gryffindor commonroom. Malfoy nodded.
"The evil sea-witch is being very mean," he heard Al explain very seriously. "She's not at all like a real witch, is she?" He pressed his little warm body closer to Draco and rested his dark tousled head on Draco's upper arm. It was evident that he was getting tired and forced himself to stay awake. Draco put his arm around him and pulled him closer. Albus yawned and nuzzled his face into Draco's chest. It was all very strange, indeed.
His shaft was long and lighter than Harry's, and Harry thought it was perfect and beautiful, so he kissed it too. Malfoy's knees gave in and he would have fallen if Harry hadn't steadied him with his hands on his hips. Malfoy was so hard, his cock almost lay flat against his stomach. Harry gave Malfoy a hasty look for some sort of approval before he went on, and the sight of his face made Harry's heart flip. His eyes were closed, his cheeks flushed pink and his teeth glimmered behind slightly parted lips. The sweat from his brow had made his hair damp and it fell in limp strands across his face, and without his usual smug expression he looked like an angel.
Harry turned his head and looked out of the window. A deep mist covered the undulating landscape. The greyish-green fields with their wobbly old stone-hedges were all softened by the haze. "My parents weren't much older when they had me. If it hadn't been for Voldemort, it'd turned out all right for them and I think it will for me too. I'll have a family of my own. Merlin help me, but I have to give it a try."
to pound into something, bereft as it was of the mattress. "That's your prostate, Potter. Want me to touch it again?"
Draco swallowed hard. He was very conscious about his body, not that it was anything wrong with it, it was just that...
Granger and the Weasley girl stood up front. None of them were smiling. Granger had that determined frown on her brow she always sported when faced with a difficult case and Weasley stuck her chin up and flicked her red ponytail bouncing. Nobody said anything. Blaise held himself still, hand midway to the bowl of punch and waited.
"I won't let you Apparate after this," Malfoy said and took his coat from the rack beside the window. "And this building isn't connected to the Floo-system, so it'll have to be the Muggle way."
Lucius let his head fall on the wet soggy page and sobbed. He wasn't at all sure if it was from relief or despair.
Harry gave a heavy sigh. "So, what do you suggest I do about this then? Go back to Malfoy and say 'Hey, I think you're my Split-Apart'?"
Then he took out a black cloth from a cabinet. "I want to deprive you of one of your senses," he said. "That way you can focus more on how to feel, smell and taste. Is that all right?"
him. Isn't that the most hilarious." He gave a mock sympathetic face. "And now your little fling is over and your heart's been broken." He got up from his chair and hovered over Draco, while hissing in his ear. "That small piece of information just made my price knock the roof off. You better start writing to Mummy and ask for a neat little sum to help you through the Christmas expenses."
"Well, if everything goes as it should, you'll have plenty of time to think this over. Don't for a minute believe that you owe anything to the Wizarding World. You've done more than enough already. Besides, I'm sure Draco could use some help. That boy is working himself to the bone, if you ask me."
Hours later, he stood outside the portrait hole. It was long after midnight and the fat bitch in the painting was snoring. He woke her up by tapping on the frame and uttered the password, desperatly hoping it hadn't been changed. She glared at him, but opened with a yawn and went back to sleep.
"My Mind-Healer asked me if I ever had considered carrying a child myself and I was totally taken by surprise. I didn't even know it was possible."
Malfoy made a face at the mess and turned his back at Harry while he concentrated on an especially tricky strip of the wall. The house was crooked and no corner was straight. "Ah, that came much later," he said with a smirk. "It turns out I have some rare knowledge about the Dark Arts that not many Curse-breakers have, thanks to my father's persistant training. They owled me about a particulary difficult case, and I've been consulted now and then ever since."
"Oh, she left hours ago. Totally exhausted, but happy. I don't believe I've seen her this happy in years." Draco put his chin close to Harry's ear. "It doesn't mean I've forgiven you, but thank you for that. Do you think anyone will notice if I slip away too?"
"If you like." Malfoy climbed up and sat on his knees beside Harry's legs. Harry looked around for his wand, but it had fallen out of his pocket as he undressed and lay far away from the bed. "Here, take mine," Malfoy said, before Harry has a chance to summon it and pulled out his own wand and gave it to Harry. "It used to work pretty well for you, as I recall." Harry gripped the hawthorn-wand, and the sudden intimacy of the gesture warmed Harry. He smiled at Malfoy, who was hovering right above him.
Of course, it was Millie bloody Bulstrode who ruined a perfectly fine game of Spin the Bottle, held in the best spirit of House-unity, by shouting, "I'm not kissing any fucking boy!" and thus got everyone thinking and debating… alternative sexual preferences.
"Yes." He was a little unsteady. Malfoy threaded the rope around Harry's legs, pulled them apart and tied the shins to the thighs. It strained and the lactic acid in the muscles made him cramp a little. He couldn't move at all. Harry felt himself fall into the sensation of being held, relaxed in the security of containments.
When Harry reurned to his flat later that day, the first thing that caught his eyes was a small box on the kitchen counter that Healer Smith had provided him with earlier this month. It contained a vial of fertility potion, various leaflets on How-to-do-it and the insemination syringe.
Harry placed Lily in the highchair at the table and resumed with the cooking that had been interrupted by the brawl. "Andromeda fire-called me yesterday."
"Oh!" Malfoy pulled himself up to his full height. "I'm Draco. I'm a friend of your father's. Who might you be, then?"
"It's eleven in the morning a weekday. I have things to do, Potter." There was a familiar haughty tone in his voice.
Harry toed off his trainers and sat on the side of the bed. "I thought we should talk," he mumbled. "Ron says we're unable to communicate except with wands, fists and... erm... cocks." The blush washed over Harry's face and burned his ears.
"Right." He received a dark look from his wife. "No, really. I have a gay brother, remember. When Charlie came out it wasn't a big thing for any of us. I think Mum cried for exactly five seconds, and then everything went back to normal." He reached out and put a supporting hand on Harry's upper arm. "We're best mates, Harry, we'll always be, no matter what."
"Shut the fuck up, Blaise," Draco snarled through clenched teeth, "the boys might hear." He turned away and took a big gulp of his drink.
"I contacted our old family solicitor at Gringott's and we've filed for a divorce, so that, at least is settled. And we've swapped homes. I'm back at the Manor and Astoria has my flat in London. We thought it was the best for Scorpius, since he already feels at home there and has his own room."
"Oh, Ginny!" Harry reached out and covered her hand in his over the tabletop. "I made you so unhappy, when all I wanted was to be a good husband to you, to be your friend."
Harry felt numb. He couldn't focus on anything apart from Malfoy's presence. He answered every question he got with absolutely no emotion at all, like a mechanical doll.
Draco clutched his hands on the back frame of the wooden chair and dared to meet Potter's gaze. "Well, she was on the spot, so to speak. I very much like to stay, though, if you want me to."
"It's true, isn't it?" She turned and walked to the door. "You have to figure out what it is, Harry. What you really want."
"You're a wizard, Potter," Malfoy said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "Of course, it's possible. If you're a decendent of pure wizarding bloodlines, that is. Which you're not, I'm afraid."
"But?" She had a feeling there was more to it. She prodded him lightly in the cheek with her forefinger.
"Something that makes it easier to ask people out on dates, without the risk of making a fool of oneself," Justin added.
Harry closed in on him. He waddled by now but he tried to get as much of his Auror authority in his steps as possible. "Because, I have to point out a few things to you. First of all, your mother is currently on her way out of this house for the first time in, what I recon, a decade."
Malfoy leaned back in his seat and took a long look at Harry as he emptied his wineglass. "Well," he said slowly, "I can't promise you that, obviously, but I can be a perfect gentleman and walk you home. Come on, Potter, time to go."
"It was easier to vanish all our clothes than only some. I wasn't entirely sober myself. And since we'd… You really don't remember anything?"
Harry changed the sheets as Malfoy was in the shower and tried to tidy up the mess he'd left behind when he'd Floo-ed over to Ron and Hermione weeks ago. He hadn't bothered with anything since then.
They got out and walked the short distance to Harry's door in silence. Harry realized how tired he was when he got up on his feet, and he stumbled a little on the pavement. Malfoy's hand immediatley shot out to steady him. "Careful there, Potter. Don't want you to fall on your face."
Potter nodded. He slung his arm around Draco's neck and pulled him closer. Their breaths mingled and the frame of Potter's glasses felt sharp against his cheek, but Draco didn't care. He wanted it to hurt, to feel real. He pressed even closer and covered Potter's mouth with his own, pushed his tongue inside, ran it over Potter's teeth, explored every inch of that smooth cavity.
"We count the pregnancy weeks a little differently when it's a wizard carrying, as we usually know the exact date of conception, when for witches that seldom is the case. You're almost 11 weeks pregnant, Mr Potter, and the baby is still small, no bigger that a plum, but all fingers and toes are fully formed now. Here," he pointed.
"This is ridiculous, Potter. I'm sorry for what I said earlier, it just slipped out the way it used to. I'm not that kind of man anymore. Would you like to have a cup of coffee with  me, see if maybe we can start over?"
"Malfoy," he said, then clarified, "Draco. I know you two used to date. You still love him, don't you?"
"I don't care," Harry grunted huskily. "I need this now." He decended on the leaking head of Malfoy's cock. Malfoy was right. The stretch hurt, but Harry pushed on and more of Malfoy pressed into him. Sweat broke out on Harry's back and chest and he gasped. He bent forwards to face Malfoy, to meet his eyes while his body adjusted to the intrusion. Malfoy squeezed his eyes shut and held back the urge to push. Harry rubbed his hands along Malfoy's bared chest, pinching the pink nipples a little. Malfoy grabbed Harry's hips and strained not to buck up into him, and his lips parted as he groaned.
The dark-haired boy put his crayon down among the others on the paper and frowned. He was still sceptical. "If you're Dad's friend, how come you've never been to our house? I know all of Mum's and Dad's friends and I've never seen
"Dad!" Al whined and sounded more like his eleven-year-old self than he probably would like to. "That's only Uncle Ron and Aunt Mione, or someone else of your old school-friends. You never meet anyone new."
Draco grabbed him by the shoulders, his eyes dark of fear. "Harry? Are you in pain? The baby?" The last question was more of a worried whisper.
The silence in the room was palpable, and then Malfoy broke out in a loud boisterous laugh. "Oh, Potter," he panted, wiping his eyes, "aren't you the most romantic fool ever. Just because I let you know I was interested in a good shag, there's no need to... well, propose. Besides…" He leaped over in one swift stride and sat down very close to Harry, cupped his chin in his hand and turned his face. Harry sat compleatly still, and as their lips brushed ever so slightly, he felt a heat rush all over him. Harry opened his mouth a bit, waiting, and Malfoy's thumb stroke Harry's short beard while his breath whiffed over him. "Besides, I'm already married."
to interfere, telling me what to do, how to live, how to think. If she wasn't such a good friend, it would have been rather annoying. Merlin knows, how Ron puts up with it daily. At least, I only have to endure morning coffee with her a couple of times a week at her office. When I get home, I can spread my things around all I want, eat whatever I want, and nobody will care.
Harry swallowed. "And that's my third point. I realized what a dumb arse I am. I hid so many things, kept myself blindfolded for what I am, what I feel. I lied to myself. I think you know that."
"Quite sure." He gave her a tender smile. "Go home." He turned to Harry as she closed the door behind her, "She's an absolute gem. I don't know what I'd do without her in this Muggle world." He opened the food cartons and peered inside to identify their orders before handing Harry's over to him.
"First, this must not be a secret. Having a child with the famous Harry Potter will be very beneficiary to the Malfoy name and reputation, and that's an opportunety far too good to pass by." He held up his hands to stop Harry from protesting. "I know, this is what everybody wants from you, to be a part of your fame and glory, but with me, at least you have no false pretence of love and adoration." He stroked his hair away from his face and sighed. "And Merlin knows I could do with a little good-will publicity."
The table was set for one, and he frowned as he pulled out his chair and sat down. His wife always had breakfast in bed, but Draco should be there. The fact that the elves hadn't laid the table for him, today as well as yesterday, was evidence that he hadn't come home yet.
"I've finished some of the renovations already," Harry said as he took Malfoy on a tour around the house. "The bathrooms and the kitchen are almost ready, I started with those. And the living room. It took a while to install the electricity, the magic in the house kept resisting it, but it was worth the effort. Now the kids can watch DVD's on the telly."
"Adam, good to see'yu!" Harry yelled, overly joyed to find a familiar face, and placed a very wet kiss on Adam's cheek before he stumbled back into a solid frame of man.
meet a girl you want to marry? How do you think she'll feel when you have Malfoy's off-spring strutting about the house?"
"You're too fixated on Hogwarts-houses, Harry," Draco huffed. "The real world doesn't work that way." Their eyes met and they both burst out laughing. Harry threw a quick glance over at Hermione, who was the origin of this often-recited tirade, but it seemed she hadn't over-heard. She was happily engulfed in the debate on where they would be spending their last school-break. Her beaming face gave Harry a warm fuzzy feeling. He really loved them all.
With a sigh Harry complied and Malfoy kept working his slick fingers in different directions, when suddenly, "Aaahh!" Something sent off fireworks inside him.
It bothered Harry, though. Because he knew how it felt. He'd used to wonder if that white-blond hair would feel as silky as it looked and now he knew. He'd had his fingers through it, for Merlin's sake.
He took Harry to one of those new Muggle places, where the music was too loud and they always spelled Hermione's name wrong on the paper-cup, when she and Harry met for a quick caffeine-fix, before she rushed back to another meeting at the Wizengamot.
"No, I just wanted you to know. And I want you to come to the bloody party with me. They're all there, you know, waiting for you. Molly and Andromeda has cooked for days, it seems. There's a big buffet table in the garden under the cherry-trees. Luna has decorated, so don't be surprised when you find carrots on rows among the fairy-lights."
"Go on, figure yourself out, before it's too late, Harry." She gave him a quick hug and released him.
"Shibari is based completely on trust. You seem tense. Try to relax and feel that you can trust me," Malfoy said.
A soft rustle in the grass made him aware of someone coming up behind him. A familiar flowery scent told him who it was. Ginny.
Someone came up and put a naked arm dangling with bangles and chains around Malfoy. "What have we here, Draco and Bad-boy."
"Bloody stubborn bastard," Ron groaned. He turned to Neville, "Nev, we'll have to go after him." He set off after the fading clatter of Harry's shoes.
With a sigh he stooped to gather his books and quills and all the other things from his satchel that now lay scattered all over the floor outside the Charms classroom, when a pair of dirty trainers came to halt in front of him.
Harry sobbed. He allowed himself to grieve and cry as he was held in Draco's arms, tight and reassuring.
Tea sputtered all over the silver toast-rack, the white linen cloth and the paper. Heloise flapped her wings indignantly to get herself into safty at the other end of the room.
It'd been left empty and deserted for a long time, and everything that had been done to the place when it was used as Headquarter for the Order seemed to have been undone again over the years. It was definitely not a place for children, not as it was. But this house was his, it was part of him in a way very few things were. It was a connection to his Godfather, and through him to his parents and to Remus. He wanted to create something nice of the old place, somewhere the kids felt safe and would want to come home to.
Harry walked closer and peered inside the box. There were records from the sixties and seventies, mostly Muggle. "I'm not sure you're supposed to play this kind on such an ancient contraption," Harry said. "It'll scratch them."
When Malfoy saw the wet patch on the front of Harry's trousers he laughed. As he helped Harry to his feet and released him from the cuffs, he bit and licked the pulse-point under Harry's ear and said, "What a little cock-slut you turned out to be, Scarhead."
"And why, Mr Potter, does that feel so unobtainable to you? It's not an unusual goal in life to have a family, you know."
"Can I buy you another one of those?" Harry asked. "I wouldn't mind the company, even if it is slimy pointy brats," he added with a grin.
Harry sat up. "Why don't you ever want to talk about what you do, or show me, for that matter? It's not my business, but I'd really like to know."
"Muggles use them to attract metal. Scorp thought they were a lot of fun when he was younger." Malfoy took another sip and placed his glass on the table again. "If you try to connect them, they're absolutely impossible to press together. They keep dodging and repelling each other, but if you flip them over -Bam!" He clapt his hands to illustrate.
The sounds Potter made. He had his fingers tangled in Draco's hair, pulling at the roots in waves, clutching and un-clutching. Then his breath hitched and he pushed Draco's head away. "Stop!" he yelled. "Stop, Draco, I'm gonna come."
A tanned muscular arm, sprinkled with fine black hair, slung over his chest and pulled Draco closer to the someone who's bed he lay in.
"But it never ends, does it? It will never be enough, there will always be one more, and one more, and your best is never enough. You always have to do better."
The gravity of what he'd just done hit him. How in Godric's name had he got here? He couldn't remember. Last thing he knew, before having the shag of his life, was being hungry, sitting down in the Great Hall, drinking a glass of juice and... an argument about a potion. Had he been drugged to have sex with Malfoy?
"Being with a woman for the first time comes with a manual?" Draco's eyebrows shot up in mock-surprise.
Harry held the parchment in his hand for a little while before he crumbled it up into a tight ball and threw it very hard into the living room wall. But something about that note stuck with him all  through the day. In the afternoon he Floo-ed home and
"Good?" Malfoy asked, a coy smile playing at the corner of his mouth. "I knew you liked Italian, so I thought I'd go for a safe thing, this first time." Harry almost choked. The flirting and innuendos were getting the better of him. Time to come clean about something.
"It wasn't fucking fireworks, okey. If it'd been, I wouldn't be sitting here on your sofa, alone, now would I?" Harry lowered his voice. "I wouldn't be in this bloody mess." He sighed.
Draco flicked his eyes at the boy standing so close to him. "Keep it down, Potter," he growled. "Are you completely mad?" He glanced quickly around the room. "Do you want everybody to hear? What will your little girlfriend think?"
"It's Wednesday, isn't it? So, that means date-night." The insolent nonchalance in his voice made Harry see red.
"Subtle, Potter," Malfoy smirked. "Don't you think this would actually work better if I was… well, hard?"
This was it. He was doomed for all eternity, forever damaged. He would never be able to feel anything for any other man than this boy in his arms. He already knew that, had so for a long time, but now he felt it in every fibre of his body, every nerve-ending on his skin, in his blood, with his magic thrumming and his prick stirring painfully in his pants.
Time stood still and Harry held his breath, waiting. Then Malfoy jerked back, a furious expression on his face.
She snorted a laugh. "Sometimes you're so bloody British. No, we're beyond tea. Any scenario between Darling Draco and The-Git-Who-Lived that ends up with one of them naked, calls for something a lot stronger than tea." She waved her long purple-varnished nails at him in dissmissal. "See what you can find, dear, and I see if I can get through to this big baby."
"All of them, it seems," Draco said as he came closer. "Andromeda brought Mum, there's a whole hoard of Weasleys, and Ron and Hermione, of course."
He stopped at Harry's desk and put his clenched knuckles down in front of Harry and met his gaze. He was quite impressive in his Auror-uniform, with his stature. "You could've had any of us, you know that. I mean, Charlie's not likely to have any of his own. I bet he would love to father a child with you."
At the Manor, everything was ready for the new little Malfoy. Harry and Draco had decorated a nursery in the study adjacent to Draco's old rooms, instead of moving Narcissa from the master suite. It was better for her to stay where she was used to, and Harry didn't mind the smaller cosier part of the building.
Blaise had clapped Harry on the back and muttered something like, "Hope you know what you're doing, mate. He's awful high maintenance, that one," and winked at Draco.
Harry stood almost bent down now, nose to the ground, rubbing his temples. "Stronger there," he mumbled. "Must find it." Ron thought he looked like a wierd shaggy dog, with his tousled black hair, sniffing around in strange circles. A little bit like Sirius as Padfoot.
"This is school," Harry shouted defiantly. "There's people everywhere!" He knew the excuse was lame.
He looked at his wristwatch (a muggle one, in gold) and got up. "I have to get on stage," he said. "Why don't you stay the whole show for once, and we could have a drink together after?"
"I miss Hogwarts." Harry drowned his shot in one go and reached for another. "It's my real home, my first home, and I did some stuff in fifth year, showing the others some spells, and I was good at it. I liked it and I've been thinking that… I-think-I'd-like-to-become-a-teacher." He swallowed the second shot with the speed of lightning.
"No, of course not. I just thought it odd, that's all." Harry resumed the appeasing strokes of his belly, where his boy, their little baby-boy, was again playing Quidditch with Harry's bladder. The little bugger would be grounded for life for the way he was treating Harry's intestines.
"You think I don't know that?" Malfoy spat, but calmed down and added much lower. "It's not what I pictured myself doing, to have as an occupation, when I was at Hogwart, but I can make myself useful there. I like that."
lose contact with a lot of people. Malfoy, for instance, do you ever think about what happened to him?"
Draco tried to suppress it, he really did, but it came up anyway, a loud sob from that aching lump deep down in his stomach. Potter pulled him closer, with his arms around him in a firm grip. "But don't you ever doubt," he spoke very quietly, whiffing Draco's ear with his hot breath, "that just because I said, I love you, doesn't mean I'm not abel to hex your arse off, anytime I feel the need."
Salazar's beard, had he really followed someone home last night? Had he finally had sex with another man and no recollection of it?
"I tought you'd come by eventually," he said with a faint smile. "I didn't have the nerve to seek you out in any other way. I've been eating here every night for nearly two weeks now. You're right, the seafood pasta is absolutely great."
