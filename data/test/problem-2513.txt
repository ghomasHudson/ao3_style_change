Harry deflates a little, though his eyes still seem to burn with the same intensity. That's something rare these days. “Why don’t you just let me—”
But there, at least, he had Harry. Draco could touch him, though their touch held no warmth, they could kiss, though there was barely any feeling to their skin. Harry told him he loved Draco, and Draco replied the only way he knew.
"Wasn't sure you wanted me to," Harry replied. Draco was so close, drying off the last dish by hand with a brisk efficiency that told Harry, unlike most wizards, Draco had done that before.
Draco pulls away, gasping, and places his trembling hands on Harry’s chest, keeping him at a short distance.
, a voice in his own mind chides him. It seems like an easier concept to grasp now, than to fully comprehend he’s standing in front of his husband again after five years of loneliness.
"What if she's seriously ill?" Harry asked. There was an unspoken question about regret.
Four matches to go. Harry caught the Snitch in ten minutes against the Cannons. There was lots of complaining about how the seeding this year was unfair, but at least they might get a chance at a higher ranked rookie being knocked out so early.
Harry tamped down his anger just a tiny bit more. He didn’t want to have come all the way to the Ministry for nothing. Mostly, he was too tired to contemplate what new bit of petty theft his house might have done in the meantime. It was currently cycling through art.
Draco grins, patting Harry’s shoulder condescendingly. “There, there, Harry. We all know you’ve hit the jackpot with me.”
Draco Summons a pen and writes on the back of the paper, fingers trembling and heart threatening to escape its enclosed cage.
But Harry doesn’t hate him, and that’s better than anything Draco hoped for this meeting. He has no idea how to deal with that.
have to let me go, Draco, otherwise you’ll lose him too. I can’t stay like this any longer.” Harry sounds tired, defeated, like he did on the last day of their life together, five years ago. “You kept me alive for all those years. And your will kept me here. I can’t go until you let go of me.”
So Harry let him.
Draco hurts a bit from the loss of that side of Harry, but he revels in a new thing they have in common.
“He didn’t want to be unfaithful to you.”
An elegant looking eagle owl swooped into the garden as Harry and Draco were lounging, trying to catch the first bit of genuine sunshine in late April. Harry rarely got Owl delivery direct from anyone. His mailing service and wards should have prevented it.
"What's this?" Draco asked. His eyes went to Harry's torso.
"What are you looking for?" Draco said, looking down at his torso. "Are you
Harry smiles ruefully. “Guilty.”
At the sudden numbness the absence of her hands leaves in him, Draco opens his eyes. Elle’s still in front of him, her head is turned to the side. When he follows her gaze, Draco finally sees what she’s been staring at.
"Hand me that letter opener in the first drawer. Be careful with the catch." Draco gestured carelessly at his art deco credenza. This must be his equivalent of a junk drawer, and Harry wanted to know if he could glean something from the contents, but he fetched a tacky-looking sword letter opener as directed. He spotted nothing more than odds and ends anyhow.
much to live through three times.
Harry doesn’t ask if he’s sure. He pushes in slowly, as if Draco might shatter. It fills him whole; the burning makes Draco’s vision blur. He wants more. When Harry’s completely inside him, he pauses, giving Draco time to adjust, and asks how it feels.
“Yes,” Draco replies, body slumping on his seat. Then, “No. Do you have a cigarette?”
"I have a lot of time in the summers. And it’s better to keep busy than not do anything," Harry said with a shrug.
Harry, despite the smile on his face—strained, Draco notices—isn’t happy when their flat is swarming with people a few weeks later. Not because of the visits. Granted, he loves his friends and having Pansy, Blaise, Granger and Luna over is always bound to be fun. It’s the reason behind their meeting that has Harry bouncing  on his feet.
"Leave her alone. She might be unavailable, but at least this one isn't straight," Millicent said, with a condescending pat to Astoria’s cheek. Astoria mimed biting her hand.
“You didn’t assume,” Draco rushes to assure him. “I… I just.” He takes a deep breath, closes his eyes and searches for strength in his own magic to say what he needs. “You need to know I can’t be just one more. I won’t share you, Harry. If we do this, it means…” Draco sobs, wet grey eyes meeting green. “I want you so badly. I love you so much.”
, Draco! You can see what others can’t! It’s part of your birthright as a Malfoy!”
knows how to do this.
Stella hesitated.
Harry lifts his head from where it rests on Draco’s chest, eyes searching  his own, serious and intense. “It’s not only about the press. We’re together all the time. My friends like you—”
He gives Harry a confident grin, closing the distance between them with a few swift steps. “I’m sure it is really,
But the man’s voice is
Harry glances at him now, head tipped to the side, eyes dazed and distant. Draco tightens his grip, as if Harry might disappear if he blinks, if he’s not touching him. He doesn’t need to blink; he tells himself he’s not alive and movements as such are nothing but a reflex of a life he can’t leave behind. But Harry is here with him. That should be all that matters.
It was a rare Friday afternoon match that the Falcons lost to the Pride of Portree. Harry hesitated. He never hesitated. Hesitation ruined your Quidditch game. Harry had been blindly furious at himself. He had been thinking first, and it cost them a whole match. There was no such thing as a perfect season and they were always bound to lose some of the time, but it still felt awful. Everyone backed off during the post-mortem, even though Harry felt like every single team member knew that he was the reason they lost.
"I brought an actual present." Draco drew out a small pink box, and her eyes lit up.
"The library is boring. Might as well start in the attic since you’re around," Draco said.
I didn’t. I couldn’t begin to comprehend, but I could understand feeling inadequate.
None of this made any sense: the urgency of Harry needing Draco like this, a piano bench where there was better, softer furniture steps away, how this satisfied even though it was the type of directionless, desperate fumbling he hadn't done in years. Draco, with that surprising strength, stood up and dumped them on the armchair, which expanded so Harry could lean back against Draco's chest.
"It's more complicated than that," Harry guessed. There was some clarity on how tricky very powerful magic was, even underneath all the theory.
Harry couldn't even manage a 'Yes, Coach'. He just nodded and tried to forget the ghost of Draco Malfoy that was haunting him. It was a countdown to the finals at this point.
Harry tried going around to Ollivander’s to visit Luna. He had always wanted to watch her make a wand but never found the time before his injury. He made it to lunch before Luna tossed him out of her workshop complaining about his "frenetic and unbalanced energy."
"You’re no fun. The fact we almost got married keeps me up at night," Ginny said. "Imagine."
“Well, it doesn’t matter anymore,” Draco announces, lifting his teacup for a toast. The girls happily oblige, and the china clinks softly. “I’m coming back.”
“That reminds me of something, Draco! You’re lucky you’re not the one with no memory, or I’d say you were trying to get out of our bet.”
“I heard it when I first got here,” Harry admits, leaning his head against Draco’s palm. “Our song. Your voice calling for me. I didn’t… I couldn’t go away. I stayed, but I couldn’t find my way back either, so I got stuck.”
“Many of the oldest pure-blooded families are deeply connected to their,
He spent a pleasant few days with his friends and settled in on December thirty-first to stay home. It was about ten pm before he felt the wards shift and heard ‘Harry?’ from the hallway into where he sat by the fireplace.
Draco’s expression was hard to make out in the dark. "You’re not worried about rumours?"
Draco’s voice was fuzzy with sleep when he groaned, "Constantine is going to kill me."
"You think he’s fine?" Harry was aware he was just repeating everything Ron said in increasingly hysterical tones.
I had been living with that for too long, and it wasn’t Luna’s fault. Or Ron’s or Hermione’s.
"Don’t let the League run your fucking life, Harry," Oliver said. But the League ran both of their lives.
, but Draco knows better than anyone what it is to feel lonely when he’s surrounded by friends and family.
During Harry's time in the league, Quidditch uniforms had changed gradually from the bulky robes, breeches, and leather of years past to fitted jerseys, black running tights, and sleeker guards for the wrist, elbows and shin. Almost everyone switched to soft boots in team colours with reinforced toes. Better for flying in.
Harry shakes his head and faces Draco, chuckling amusedly. “How will you attempt to control me, Healer Potter?”
"You're not. But whoever is making you this happy? You should keep him around." Then Oliver flicked Harry’s nose, and there was a bit of a tussle as Harry flicked him right back on the ear, which Oliver hated.
Still feeling exposed and weakened by their last reunion, Draco remains quiet in his chair. His eyes don’t seek Potter’s and he tries to concentrate on what everybody’s saying this time, rather than thinking about how much he wants to run away.
is your boyfriend,” Draco hears coming from a booth in the corner, the strident voice cutting through the low buzz of the pub.
I ran.
,” the stable hand insisted, “who’d you see...you know…” he dragged his thumb lewdly across his throat, his tongue flopping out of his mouth around a wet, gagging noise.
And he realises that, in fact, the Forest
just drink and forget.
“I…” Draco starts, unsure of what to do with those eyes. They were so warm moments ago. Draco forces a grin. “You know, I used to play for you often. Do you want to hear it?”
“Why is that, Harry?” Marvin inquires, nodding slowly.
"What did you say to them?" Harry was…overwhelmed. Dragonhide satchel belonging to James Potter, rocking chair, three vases (Etruscan 19th century? read Draco’s annotation), horsehair mattress, set of thirteen elven-made goblets, Muggle linen chest, phoenix shaped diamond brooch belonging to Euphemia Potter and on and on.
"I love camp week. I wish I could take all of the kids home." Pansy’s office overlooked a small corner of the pitch where kids were being herded into the building. She watched them scramble with a small smile on her face.
For not being able to talk to them, not to touch them, not to
"Think nothing of it, Mr Potter," Draco said. "Shall we?"
"What notice?" Harry relied on Hermione or Pansy to tell him if something was important. He had found himself angrier after reading the paper most days during the first year post-war. He refused to buy a subscription to the
At least now he has a name for the emotion. He picks up the last letter.
“What’s the new password again?”
care,” Draco sighs, because it’s probably better to get this argument taken care of so there isn’t a bad taste in his mouth all summer. “I wouldn’t have entered our blood contract if I didn’t care, which of course I do. If it weren’t for you two I wouldn’t have made it through second year. Not with my father and all the other secrets I was forced to keep, which you know were too important to divulge without Dumbledore agreeing, and he couldn’t deal with that while students were getting hurt.”
He threatened
Dobby’s tears stop. “Master would speak to Dumbledore for Dobby?”
“Evening, Draco. Won’t you take a seat? I’ve had Sisily make snacks.”
Harry slows to a stop, turning back to give him a questioning look. All it takes is one glace for Draco to mentally say fuck it, reminding himself that he’s already going to die if he’s discovered. What’s one more thing?
you! If I hadn’t taken the Mark you’re father would’ve made you take it! If I wasn’t in the raids Luna would’ve
It’s a weird feeling to open gifts with this many people, but it’s a nice feeling. One that Harry decides he likes.
“Training?” Draco refrains from holding his throbbing cheek, no need to spur the man.
Ron gives them a weird look before turning to Millie. “Do you do that too?”
“Find the connection? It doesn’t seem like a thing people can do, if so Sirius or Remus would’ve seen or right? If not them then surely Narcissa. They’re all very powerful, so I just don’t understand-”
“Oh, you know.”

“There was someone in the woods!” George calls from where he’s wrapped around Fred, Ginny in the middle of them.
It’s out of his mouth before he can take it back, his father’s favorite insult, it horrifies him the second it leaves his tongue. He feels too much like his father when he says it, so much it actually frightens him, and then Flint is in front of him and someone is firing a spell.
He himself had only gotten pranked roughly three times. Pansy with an obnoxiously loud alarm that LuLu had vehemently protested against, Blaise’s hair revenge only his had been pink, Crabbe and Goyle had teamed up on him and given him a spicy chocolate that was so hot it made his tongue go numb for a few moments.
“Alright, alright, no need to show off.” The kid mumbles.
“I know.”
Millie: I'm getting together with the Greengrasses to make sure all of her business deals fail
It took all of five minutes to convince Harry to go to bed, and the boy had protested even after Draco swore they would talk to Dumbledore about it first thing in the morning. Not that Draco was looking forward to seeing the man after their last tea session where he stormed out in anger. That being said, he did get the coot’s reasoning.
(See the end of the chapter for
George grins back, “She is.”
A dark look passes before he can stop it, leaving them both unwilling to speak and nervous. Eventually, Blaise sits up slowly, “Listen, mate, I can’t pretend to know what’s going on, but if that’s what you’ve been so pent up about….you’re not your father. You have more respect than fear, shouldn’t that matter more in loyalty? Hell, I’m loyal to you, and it’s been a while since I’ve been properly terrified by you.”
know, which really makes the whole thing a bit funny. He’s so busy watching he doesn’t see Snape vanish his friend, but he does see Weasley tugging Potter away. This year kept getting better and better.
Draco agreed. Harry put on Ella Fitzgerald and turned it up until it could be heard from downstairs. Draco was lost in his own thoughts, so Harry let Ella’s voice carry the silence. Over chicken pesto, Harry gathered the courage to ask.
"Conditional on you. They told me in no uncertain terms that you were a star player, and if you expressed even the slightest discomfort with me, I'd be out before I could say 'scrum'. The last time I had seen you in person I tried to hand you over to an evil megalomaniac to save my own sorry arse. Do you remember what you said to me?"
It won’t make it stop hurting, though, but it would appease a little of his jealousy.
“I know that! But I’ve changed, I’m not that man anymore.” Harry gestured to the large photograph, but didn’t look at it. Draco hadn’t noticed until then that Harry never looked at it directly. “That moment doesn’t mean nearly as much to me as it does to you. I don’t want to keep staring at what you’ve lost every day like it’s somehow my fault!”
"I did hate you. You were an awful little shit. I only realised in retrospect so don’t be too happy." Harry expected a little bit more teasing but instead, Draco came closer and pulled him into another long, drugging kiss.
“You imagine?” Harry’s breath is warm in his neck. Distracting.
The hubbub outside Harry Potter’s door in St Mungo’s is to be expected. Their great saviour has been in a coma for five years. Five years of sadness living in every corner of Wizarding Britain, as if Harry’s slumber had taken it down with him. Still, Draco makes his way in, jostling anyone in his path. He doesn’t stop. The only emotion guiding him is an urgency he hasn’t felt for the last five years; an urgency that was drowned, snuffed in hopelessness and despair.
“You.” He points at the same Mediwitch who accompanied him to the room. The woman perks up, eyes wide. “Get Elle’s potions cocktail, add the Restorative and the Girding potions to the mix, and bring everything to me. You,” he gestures at another Healer, standing behind Healer Cameron. “Get the book
But with mild summer weather came extra flying, so Harry went to put in time at the Falcons training pitch instead of at Hyde Park. No one at the front desk blinked at Harry returning, though he was not here that often in the summers.
"Lupin, how’s it going?" Stella said, stopping her bike and wiping her brow. Teddy started telling her about the Portkey trip. Then, again, like Oliver, Teddy knew Stella from years and years of camps and parties.
She backs away when he pushes her arm, finding no resistance in his limbs, which is surprising for someone who seemingly stayed for weeks in death’s embrace.
They stay quiet for so long; the server comes and goes with two distinct orders of coffee for each before any of them has gathered the courage to speak.
There’s a sort of finality to her words that just makes it all the worse.
All at once. People touching me, your eyes
And then I raised my head again and looked at you. “Okay.”
Draco gave him one warm, searching look. Harry leaned just a tiny bit forward, hoping something would happen, and Draco didn’t come any closer. He just squeezed his eyes shut, huffed a sigh and said, "Good night Harry."
"Hello," Draco whispered. The house shivered with delight.
“I missed you.
Draco’s changed a lot in the last ten years. He’s made a name for himself. He worked hard, he grew, and improved. The heavy bags under his eyes are now proof of his work hours, rather than reminiscent of the war days weighing on his actions. He looks healthier, mentally and physically, even if he feels like drowning most of the time.
“I love you, Harry Potter,” Draco says, voice thick, and pulls Harry closer. “And I would never trade the happiness of being with you now, for a life of unknown emptiness.”
Blaise stares appraisingly at Draco, eyes filled with mirth but something else, something more careful. “It’s good to see you,” Blaise says, finally, an arm resting on Draco’s shoulders as he drags him towards the entrance.
It looked cold and lonely. Teddy asked if he could join him that night, and Harry said yes.
Harry wanted more than anything to reach out and soothe himself with a touch, but he folded his hands into his lap.
feels? What his amnesia is doing to everyone around him? He doubts it.
Harry watched a pretty script spell out Mr Fleamont Potter and Mrs Euphemia Potter, Wedded August 3, 1924. They beamed in greyscale from the plate, and his grandfather gave his grandmother a kiss on the cheek while she laughed. Harry couldn’t describe the feeling that arose in him. This plate in Draco’s hands had belonged to his family. Someone, perhaps a relative or a house-elf or his parents, had packed these up carefully and stored them away.
Neville came to look at the courtyard with little fuss. He couldn’t resist the lure of the unknown. Neville picked up a pebble and hurled it at the opening, and a small clang sounded as it reached just above the height of the house.
. He’s not alone anymore.
True to her word, by the time he arrived at home after flying, a harried-looking eagle owl dropped off a letter, in which Draco said he would come by tomorrow afternoon for an initial consult. Harry had never bought another owl. It seemed wrong, somehow. He had treats in his travelling cloak for Neville's puppy, and Malfoy's owl bristled its feathers, deeply offended at the offer, before flying away.
Draco leads him to the master bedroom, cursing himself for leaving the bedsheets in a tangled mess when he got up in the morning. Harry sits on the edge, not minding the cluster of blankets, fingers gripping the sheets and eyes perusing the room serenely.
“Can you tell me what you know?”
Despite all the pain, terror, and tragedy that swallowed everything after that fateful summer, he can’t help but be grateful now that the
Draco looked unimpressed.
"I thought you’d never ask," Gwen said. She Summoned a scroll of parchment and handed it to him. "I can have anything you’d like delivered."
He feels like he is breaking already.
Trusting comes hard for Draco these days, though, as that lump of grief and angst crushing his chest gets bigger and bigger. Air tastes stale, weighs heavily on his lungs and, when it leaves his body, it cuts his throat like a thousand knives.
For better or worse, Harry was used to bad press. First, it had been that Harry, as a rookie, was too distracted by his boyfriend. Then, it had been that Harry was too heartbroken even if he played well. He was too boisterous in celebration, he was not gracious enough, he was too angry, he was too timid. He had made himself smaller and smaller to fit into that box they set for him.
A low giggle escaped my lips as I backed away from you. “Call me Harry.”
Harry came all hot and relieved onto his stomach. It took a few moments for Harry to stop shaking apart. He turned then to kneel before Draco, knowing full well he was making a mess of both of them.
Draco did not seem at all pleased to see Harry the next morning.
“It’ll be fine,” Draco mutters, pushing himself away from the wall. His legs feel wobbly, but he takes two steps before he hears his name being called out.
Harry stops, digesting her words so slowly that the tension in the room is almost palpable. “Where’s Hermione?” he manages.
“Of course they are. You saved their arses, Harry. The least they can do is stalk you endlessly.” And Draco’s not nearly as irritated by this as he should be. Reading the papers allowed him to see  photos of Harry and know of his whereabouts sometimes, so that has got to be a silver lining.
Harry is here.
This time he feels his heart thumping wildly in his chest. He feels alive.
Harry takes one glance at the emptiness of the living room and smiles at Draco. “I want to be a part of it,” Harry says, before he comes in. “I don’t want to feel like I’m here just to fill the hole he left.”
"I’m sorry." Drying tear trails ran to her chin and her nose ran all over Harry’s arm even as she swiped at it with the back of her hand. Everyone else had their backs turned as a courtesy. They had all been the person to cry in the locker room after a match.
Draco would know. Harry had looked it up.
It’s not the hole in his chest, it’s nothing but that ugly side of loneliness chiding him for being so subservient, for being so bloody understanding all the time.
They ended up playing a very lopsided version of three on three with Oliver playing Keeper for both sides on one half of the pitch. It was great to play with everyone even when they were all casual, playing at half speed.
This time it feels worse. He’s losing something he hasn’t even got the chance to get. He’s losing the hope of what Harry’s presence meant.
More often than not, they went together to Andromeda’s house now. Andromeda’s eyes were careful, questioning, but she stopped herself from asking Harry about it. Teddy seemed not to care about why Draco and Harry were over at the same time, monopolising their attention in the living room as Andromeda popped out to the shop for milk.
Harry, with a giddy grin and normal enough appearance—fits in perfectly is beyond Draco.
"I'm going to kiss you. For good luck," Harry said, solemn as the countdown began in the other room. Draco nodded once. Harry brought one hand to Draco's chin and watched his eyes flutter shut and pulled Draco in closer. He almost backed out then. It would be easy if Draco gave him some quarter. Draco didn’t.
"I learned what I know. You just are who you are." Draco ran one possessive hand down Harry's back before slipping something cold into his pocket. "Keep the necklace. It looks good on you."
“I seriously doubt that.
Draco was in a very, very foul mood.
you suffering like this.”
And he needs so badly to know why—
Harry freezes, but then he’s melting into Draco’s touch, into his presence.
Draco’s eyes snap to Elle, but are on Harry a second later. He can’t
"That’s enough. Toni, you stay. Everyone else, out!" Pansy snapped. She grabbed a blanket and threw it at Harry. No one protested. Even though it was cold in late October, Harry was grateful to see the crew go. He sat sidesaddle on his broom, letting it hover a bit off the ground.
“I love you,” he says. And then, repeats, as if Draco could have misunderstood. “I love you, Draco Malfoy.”
Draco flicks his short hair away from his face, but his reflection sneers back at him, much like his sixteen-year-old self. The last thing he needs is one more thing reminding Harry why he hates Draco. Long fingers mess up the platinum strands, but it still feels weird. Nothing looks right, he doesn’t look right. Hell, he doesn’t even
"Captain?"
"Please shut up."
On that first day, Harry looked at Draco funny. His head was tilted to the side, dazed eyes sparkling so much in the sunlight they looked like two of those beautiful, bright stones Drey kept in his room. Harry's cheeks were pinkening, like Draco's did when he was out in the sun for too long.
"So how do I give it magic? And how long will it take?"
He gulps down the fear. “Yes, that’s right. There’s something I need to tell you, Harry, about the day you woke up,” Draco starts, as steadily as he can, when all he hears is his heart thumping loudly in his ribcage. “What do you know about your curse?”
"We are
"You’ve been doing a wonderful job with the house, and I don’t mean to rush you. You’ve also taken the time to explain a lot about the magic and my family’s things…and I know you don’t…it’s…" Harry trailed off. He snapped his mouth shut.
Skye was beautiful this time of year. Conditions were clear, blue skies and not a speck of cloud. A gentle breeze stirred the grass as they walked onto the pitch to meet Portree. The mood in the locker room had been cautiously optimistic. They were so close to the Cup.
"Do you play because you love the game, or because you've got an agenda to pursue?"
Draco wants to ask what’s on his mind, to make sure Harry knows he can trust Draco, he can tell him whatever afflicts his soul. And Draco
Harry frowns, but he doesn’t seem to notice Draco’s prolonged silence, as he continues in a weak tone, “You know, I am still trying to understand the twelve years I’ve missed. I can’t, not always.” He shrugs, averting his gaze to a painting of the sea on a stormy day on Draco’s wall. “I was terrified at first, when I heard we had got married. It made no sense.” Harry snorts, facing Draco once more. “But I… I like the person you’ve become. I feel comfortable with you, and being with you was a pleasant distraction from—”
And Draco doesn’t want it. There’s nothing he can do with it now, he can’t keep suffering for someone who doesn’t want him. Even when that someone is standing right by his side as they walk to the hospital’s floo. Harry’s made his position on Draco clear when he asked for the divorce.
Harry wasn’t shy. He used his body for his job, sure. He knew it quite well and liked it fine. He had been prodded by too many Healers and been in too many locker rooms to be anything but pragmatic. A series of almost naked photographs of him were hidden underneath many mattresses across the world.
in yet another special edition dedicated to him.
“It’s not your fault. I’m sorry I’m putting you through this,” Draco says faintly. “I’ll try to control it better from my end.”
Harry and Julie had exchanged phone numbers, because Harry apparently has a new mobile, and they hugged briefly when they parted.
Draco’s head jerks to the side, and he hovers over Elle’s body. “Elle? It’s okay. You’re going to be okay,” Draco whispers, though he knows better not to make promises he can’t keep. “I’m here.”
Not that he doesn’t want it to. He’d give anything to hear Harry calling him again, even if he keeps up calling Draco by his last name.
"No gluten, no peanuts. I know, Andromeda," Harry said, although he knew she had to check. She swiped a vial of Teddy’s allergy potion out of her purse, which Harry put it in his pocket. She bent and kissed Teddy on the cheek, and he tolerated it, although he wiped at his face when she had left.
They don’t say another word about it, but guilt is slowly eating his insides. He knows exactly why he didn’t go, and why he’s got half a mind to miss the next session.
Draco thinks he knows. He hugs Harry.
Draco loves Harry, it hits him. Draco loves this man so much it hurts.
"Have you ever thought about what it might do for morale if a bull gored the team’s captain to death during some Muggle foot race for fucking morons?" Coach asked. A vein in his forehead throbbed whenever his face went this red.
asset. He’s a prize stallion, a favorite to win the Triple Charm. I’ve allowed him to run wild with you for far too long; he needs to be broken in properly before his debut. Besides, we’ll make far more money from his covers than we ever would letting him languish here getting fat and old.”
The next morning was a rest day, so Harry slept in. He awoke to a loud crash downstairs and barely had time to throw on a shirt and some shorts before finding Draco attempting to spit up pink petals. He made a violent slashing motion with his hand, and most of the petals vanished. There were still a few in Draco’s hair and one sticking to his cheek, its bright fuschia a contrast against his skin.
Harry pouts. The girls are too distractedly squealing at the stray to even notice. “So? I want a dog now.”
Draco turns around to meet Luna’s bright grin. It’s been quite some time since he’s last seen her, their schedules keeping them from their weekly afternoon tea over the last few weeks. She’s wearing her soft blue robes—Draco had been envious at the beginning of their work when she started using the robes specific for the children’s ward—and her hair in a tousled bun held by her wand.
I grabbed it before you got the chance, but I didn’t release it, instead, keeping you close. You had lighter hair this time, but it was shorter than before, smooth and following the line of your jaw. Your face was square at all the edges, still beautiful though. Beautiful as the real one, I thought, having problems remembering exactly what you looked like as yourself.
"I don’t know why the house locked all the rooms last time. You can stay in the guest bedroom if you want. If you wanted to come in—" Draco cut back in with a few brushes of their lips then a more intense, searching kiss like they were already in Harry’s bedroom. It was freezing, and Draco’s hands were cold as they slipped under the hem of Harry’s jacket, but Harry didn't protest. He made a small sound and pressed into Draco like the last time.
Blaise is right. He needs to go out, and not only to Serendipity (though he loves it).
Harry does this often when he doesn’t want to talk about something, but Draco’s found he prefers it when Harry’s trying to distract him rather than blatantly ignoring him.
Draco finds out all sorts of things from Harry, and it’s a fresh feeling to be getting the news of his life from the source himself rather than from a third-party. He discovers Harry’s convinced Hermione and Pansy to let him live alone again and when he confronts Harry with both eyebrows raised and a “I can’t picture Hermione letting you out of her sight,” Harry only shrugs ruefully.
"Why would you sneak up on a trained Curse-Breaker?" Draco shouted, lowering his wand at once. "Do you have a death wish?"
“Draco, please, don’t be difficult,” Pansy says when she sees him tucked inside his blankets, watching Harry’s favourite show.
And that pain is all that he is.
Harry grins easily. “Yes. With you?”
"I hate all of you," Sam said with a smile. "Besides the joy of being away from these fucking pricks, how was your summer Milosh?"
Draco shakes his head. “It’s perfectly fine. I couldn’t sleep either.” A heavy sigh escapes his lips as he takes a seat on the table in front of Harry, ignoring the way Harry’s eyes follow his every movement.
"It itches," Draco said.
Affection bloomed in Harry’s chest. "You’re right. I should get a real job like rifling through people’s belongings and charging them for it." Draco made an affronted noise.
“Oh, my God. Thank fuck,” Draco sighs, trembling slightly in Harry’s hold. He blindly fumbles around, finding Harry’s face and cupping it in his hands. “You’re awake.”
“Great. Okay. Then take your house and shove it up your ass,” Harry said through gritted teeth.
"How did you change the match like that?" Draco asked, interrupting Harry’s train of thought.
"Quidditch has come a long way in many ways, don’t you think?"
Harry is lost as much as he is.
"It has a nice view of the courtyard. I was thinking it could become Teddy’s bedroom, when he’s here."
“With anyone?”
. I’m the one who was willing to do everything,
“Hey, love. Did you sleep well?” Draco asks, dazed, getting up and mirroring Harry’s sitting position.
Rose’s group was much the opposite. Maybe a handful of them came from Falcons fans' families. The rest were from access and integration programs for minorities, low-income, and, on Harry’s insistence, Muggle-born families who found out early about magic via outreach groups. Most of the kids didn’t know who Harry was other than an athlete, which he found refreshing. He sat in the media studio and took their questions as if they were journalists. Pansy stood at the back as if it were a press conference. After some coaxing by volunteers, Rosie put her hand in the air.
Harry shrugs, balancing both three-year-old girls in his arms. “I like dogs.”
One afternoon, they both are sated and chilling on the empty room’s floor, trying to figure out what to do with it. Their song starts playing on the wireless. It’s not the most exciting song, but Harry stands up and asks Draco to dance with him.
He goes home, flops onto the bed, and hugs his pillow tightly.  The sun is streaming through the crack in the window, and the cold and unsympathetic shape of his pillow only serves to remind him of what he’s lost.
It turns out, beef bourguignon tastes terrible after it’s cold, but it’s Draco’s fault for forgetting to set a stasis spell on it before fucking Harry against the table. They don’t seem to mind that at all.
In some ways, it was the same as before. Draco scanned a corner of the attic for curses. They held up items to each other, working from one end to the other.
Why should Draco have to run away from a place where he feels so comfortable? He found it first.
"I wanted to be a wandmaker, but I couldn’t go overseas while on probation, and understandably I couldn’t be apprenticed here." Draco paused. The only wandmaker in the UK was Ollivander, and Harry could see why that would be a problem. "So I studied curse-breaking, and I started fixing the Manor. After I finished, I helped pure-blood families fix the damage they had done to their own homes."
“Right. Yes.”
"Not like six more, but we both think Rose should have a sibling? And we shouldn’t wait too long," Ron said, a thoughtful look on his face. Ron crossed his arms, watching the broom drills with the same attentiveness he paid to a professional match. He must have been waiting for Harry to say something.
Draco slams a hand on the pages, certain that he won’t crumple them with the amount of conservation spells he’s put over it, eyes desperate and pleading.
“It will never work because you don’t want it to!” Harry snaps, at the same time the window shatters. The patterns of the cracks create strange forms on the floor, lit up by the light coming from the street.
It’s Harry’s handwriting. It’s worse than it used to be, sure, but it’s his, Draco knows it. Harry wrote to him.
"I'm not that generous. If you wear a Falcons jersey, I will hit you," Ginny said.
“How did this happen?!” she’s asking Draco now, apparently satisfied that Harry is real, and he’s awake. Julie doesn’t let go of him, holding Harry’s arm with a bruising grip. “How long?
Something heavy coils inside his chest, and he reaches his hand out to touch her. It falls on his side before the contact takes place, though, as he’s too terrified of the idea that Elle’s not really here, and his fingers might pass through her body.
That’s definitely something he hadn’t hoped he’d get.
"Season’s good," Harry said. But there was something about the expectant look in Draco's eye that made Harry want to say more, so he told him about Coach’s attempt to make them master the new move without giving away what it was.
There’s another Harry sitting there, staring at him with an inscrutable expression. His hair is wilder than Draco remembers, his eyes darker, deeper, less vivid. That’s… That’s
A smile tugs on his lips before he can rein it in. “What are you trying to say, Miss Carrey?”
“You’re my world.”
Would he even get away with that behaviour if he wasn’t Blaise Zabini?
Seeing as it was unlikely someone had gotten into his house to gift him bedsheets—his fans were devoted but generally less benign by the time they got to the stage of some light housebreaking—the obvious conclusion was that it was once again his house.
“I dunno who managed to get rid of Crabbe and Goyle,” Weasley says as he settles into the seat by the window, “But I say they deserve first hand in Exploding Snaps.”
He’s sure he sounded better in Azkaban. “It’s her house, Kingsley, she’s just been kind enough to not kick me out.”
Draco knows he should shrug or at least
“You should’ve come and gotten me!”

Harry’s confused for a second and then the little elf from before pops into the room.
Seeing that birds can’t talk, he doesn’t get a reply, but he does follow Fawkes to a window and open it for him, “Go and help him, boy. I’ll give you treats when you get back.”
The house itself, while small, is still two stories. Rotten even from the outside, big bay windows nearly falling off stone, the door handle is so dirty it rubs off on his hand as Draco steps inside.
Draco, wearing super tight clothes:
Blaise chuckles, “Don’t worry. Narcissa would kill them both, plus your father isn’t my mum’s type.”
Not when his family is still hurting.
“I promised to buy you a racing broom.”
Dumbledore rolls his eyes, “We’ve only informed Harry-”
Draco glares at him, but they both go quiet when Lupin comes back and places orange tea in front of them.
hi! sorry for the delay in posting, I took some time for mental health reasons and it's been great and also awful at the same time. anyways, next chapter is the one we've all been waiting for and I'm super excited for it because it's both funny and important and I just-ah! I'll be responding to all the comments i've missed and while I'm officially Back, I'm also looking for a new job, in the middle of finals and project season, and work 45-50 hours a week right now so posting is going to be on Sunday nights from now on- possibly on the usual wed/sun schedule if I can manage it. hope you enjoyed!

for Merlin’s sake, clinging to his thighs, his calves, even his butt that’s barely back to the shape it was in before his starvation period. Unlike his leggings that he’s come to love, these pants feel more like they’re sucking the life out of his legs, not protecting them with admittedly tight armor. His shoes, a pair of something that Theo calls ‘Doc Martens’ are just as uncomfortable, squeezing his toes and difficult to glide around in.
His plans change then, feet taking the route to Dumbledore’s office instead.
“Has someone else been attacked?” he asks, forgetting Potter in the wake of such a look.
“The cat likes me better!”
Draco flushes, “I thought you were-”
Unfortunately, he can’t take the man with them. Snape grab’s Lupin’s arm right as he nudges Potter.
He’s on his feet before he knows it.

“You don’t disapprove?”
Harry: I am now fully prepared for the year
Draco barely conceals a flinch, luckily his teammates bunch up for him, getting slightly closer which gives him the courage to feel something other than burning shame; anger.

Just like that dance time is over and Hermione is herding them all to the tables.
The same man, bringing books with food, making his staff longer, talking by firelight. Older, thinner, worse.

The second Salem’s eyes land on the cat toys he abandons them completely. Well, he does until Draco takes out the record player.
Blood drains from four of their faces, but Weasley apparently really does lack all common sense.
Draco fights the urge to roll his eyes at his friends, really, he wasn’t doing anything wrong. If anything, he was trying to fix what his father had done. Forgive him for attempting to be a good person. Blaise sees the look on his face and softens, moving cautiously forward.
“I believe this is yours.”
He walks straight into his friend’s weirdly firm back.
“It’s like you don’t even care! You’re not even listening to me, are you? You ungrateful-”
“Please,” Petunia scoffs, “As if a respectable lady such as myself would-”
Draco takes her little hand in his, careful not to move Salem, and tries very hard not to cry.
Harry sighs, “We have to. You promised me after that Quidditch game that we would. You said any question I have-”
Fleur blinks twice at him, but her anger seems to be dying down, so he keeps going.
Harry walked around a field of flowers, a bigger LuLu walking at his side, nudging against him every so often, but still leading him to a cottage by the beach. He didn’t know how, but he had been here before. As a matter of fact, he had a bloody key to the front door. It opens without much of an issue, and to his shock, Draco is waiting for him in the little house. A blinding smile later and their outside, on the back porch, cuddled together on a large white sofa that overlooks the sea. It’s strange, the happiness he feels. He shouldn’t feel it. This is very, very fucking weird and he would very much like to wake the fuck up right the fuck now. Dream Draco leans towards him, and right as the harrowing realization that the blonde is going to kiss him hits, a loud scream saves him.
Harry didn't sleep in the little alcove alone, he slept surrounded by arms, and heat, and love. They talked all night again. This time, Teddy was there to listen to their whispered secrets in the darkness as they both held him close.
sounds so sweet in Harry’s voice, Draco doesn’t even have it in him to argue that he most likely won’t have time to rest.
Whatever truce they created grows stronger by the day, more
The day after, Harry came home to piano music drifting down the stairs. It was past six, so Draco wasn't on the clock right now. He had rolled his sleeves up, and Harry got a proper glimpse of his coverup: a full sleeve of runes. Muggle tattoo. Despite the black of the ink and the underlying red brand of the Mark, you couldn’t tell what it had been.
"Will they call you up to Nationals this year with such sloppy playing?" asked a

is what Draco does best, this is how he becomes a better person, this is how he lives. He heals, and he takes care of people, because this is the only thing he truly knows how to do and it’s been like that since he was a little boy, realising for the first time how magic responded to him, warm and pliant. He’s
Harry sighs. He doesn’t move closer, but he doesn’t pull away either. “I had a part of Voldemort’s soul inside of me. It needed to be destroyed—
"You know what I want to see. Draco used to do the best Snape impression," Astoria said.
Draco nodded once. Harry pulled Draco into a messy but perfect kiss with no hesitation. Harry didn’t hold back at all, not content to slow down until he was pressed up firmly against him, until he could feel the warm sweep of Draco’s tongue against his. One of Draco’s hands cupped his cheek warmly, and the other rested on the hand that still held the Snitch. It fluttered against their hands. They kept breaking off the embrace to smile into each other’s mouths. The stadium was still loud, but Harry thought even if every single person in there were unhappy, he wouldn’t have been able to hear it.
“Yes, please.”
"It won’t if they keep it out of the locker room," Stella said. She took off her hair tie, shaking out her long black hair. "Isn’t it wild they just get to…" She trailed off, but Harry knew what she meant. Harry wouldn’t dare compromise his career. And there was no question it would, if he were the one caught.
It seemed to. Rooms started popping into existence. Harry was set spindrift when he opened a door to a ballroom instead of his bathroom, and then an indoor courtyard where he thought the linens were. He stood frozen for a moment, sun shining on his upturned face, the warm, orangey-red of light through closed eyelids. It reminded him of an ancient agora he had visited in Wizarding Athens with Ollie at their first World Cup in 2001, draped in overgrown olive trees. Oliver had complained the whole time about it being a waste of flying time, but took as many pictures of Harry as he wanted.
"Your godfather understood how to do that much, I’ll give him that," Draco said dryly.
don’t know all of what you did, where you went.” And most of what Draco knows, he only learnt through the time he spent with Harry in the After place.
“It would be easier if I just—”
It doesn’t matter. He’s here with the sole purpose of finding Harry, and he’ll burn this Forest to the ground if that’s what it takes to bring him home.
“Is it reversible? Can it… Will he ever get his memories back?” he hears Hermione ask, her voice muffled and distant, as the world closes in around him.
"That was only for good luck."
he wants to say. “Why?”
reporters finding him, or him bumping into someone who hates him, or just the overall panic about being recognised.
fun,” she says.
Draco clears the house of their old furniture, stores the old pictures, and cleans the painting studio bare.
“Oh,” Harry lets out, but before the frown fully sits in his face, he turns to the album.
"Always glad to be of service." He didn't even wait for Harry to leave before he called, "Emmy? Come take the public desk back. Harry Potter has gone."
"Are you all right?" Draco asked.
Life slowly gets back on track. They’re seeing a Mind Healer together, and the fights they’ve had in the beginning are now less frequent. They have lunch at the Burrow every Sunday and try to visit Elle’s grave at least once a month, knowing no one will clean it, and bring her flowers if they don’t. Sometimes, Draco goes alone, and he tells her everything about his life with Harry. He hopes she’s listening, wherever she is.
And he needs this so badly right now.
“How’d you get it, then?” one of the stable hands asked Draco one evening as they made the rounds, ensuring each tiny stall gate was closed and locked tight.
He hadn’t changed much over the years that they’d last seen each other. His hair was slightly longer and his jawline a little more defined but other than that, and the auror uniform, he was the same teenage boy.
Harry considered a joke but settled on, "I didn't get them for everyone to see. Mostly for me."
“Please, help me. I need to know what to do… I need you, I
"My Mind Healer and I talk about breathing techniques to deal with my anger problem," Harry said.
"You’re friends with Draco, aren’t you?" Harry asked, putting his mug down on the table. It seemed without Harry noticing, Draco had infiltrated Harry’s entire friend group.
Harry considered it. Draco said this wasn’t a date and, in any case, Harry thought the truth wouldn’t scare him off.
The photoshoot was less fun than chatting with Lee. Here, the photographer, Toni, tried to get Harry to lighten up while several assistants appeared to be there just to keep Harry's naked body warm. Harry had, at least, remembered to Disillusion his tattoos.
Harry frowns, lips pursing down as he sits back. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have done that. I shouldn’t have assumed you—”
“I wouldn’t have lost, you know,” Draco whispers, lips almost grazing Harry’s. The almost-touch elicits sparks in his insides.
The letter arrives about three weeks after Hermione’s visit.
“But you didn’t know this part of me,” Harry mumbles feebly. “You’re allowed to reject it. I don’t expect you to—”
Draco knows the Forest is listening to him, and ignoring his pleadings. He knows Harry is here somewhere, despite the bond being nothing more than a faint pulsing connecting them now. He can barely feel the tug of the magic, Harry’s presence. It frightens Draco more than he lets himself be aware at this moment. So, he continues.
"It’s pretty quiet at HQ in the summer without the team before training camp starts. Nothing like during the season. When the kids are here it feels…" Pansy trailed off, but Harry knew what she meant. They ate their lunches, having lapsed into silence.
He was becoming too well known for steep dives and corkscrews, and, even if it kept working, he needed something else. Last season, the League had mused about adding a penalty for skimming the grass to discourage copycats and injuries. Coach was annoyed but Harry was just glad the League was finally paying any attention to player safety.
She shrugged him off. "Yes, Captain."
“Don’t,” Draco interrupts. He can’t hear what she has to say right now. Maybe he’ll never be ready to.
Draco receives all of what Harry gives him, keeping it carefully tucked in a corner of his heart, safe and hidden away.
“Well, Potter, aren’t you gifted with your words?” Draco says, but he can’t quite stare at Harry while his cheeks burn madly, and the words lose half of their bite.
Disentangling himself from her, Draco shakes his head in lieu of a reply. Hermione doesn’t dwell on it, nor on his tired eyes and hunched shoulders.
No matter how angry, miserable, or hopeless Draco was when he pictured Harry, he saw love. Not a single one of those exchanges his mind provided ended with an outburst of energy that threw Draco to the other side of the room. None of his hopeful dreams ended with his back slamming against the wall, pain shooting through his spine, the words slipping from his grasp—with
fault for letting Harry go. But Draco smiled, and stared at their little fire — it was so cold now — and said, “remember what I always say?”
"They aren’t see-through," Harry said, looking down in confusion.
"If you wish," he paused dramatically, "to smoke filthy, disgusting cigarettes. Might I suggest doing it on our grounds and not in the toilets at 3 o’clock, rousing your entire House from their slumber?"
The apologies—hers or his—get lost in his sobs, in her embrace. Mother holds him close, tightly, and Draco feels like he’s lost the ability to speak, to move out of her hug.
"Here again?" Pansy asked, scrunching up her face. She looked far less like a femme fatale in the off-season. She was wearing flat shoes, a blue sundress, and her lipstick was a soft muted pink instead of its usual blood red.
And I was right about you, as well.
My fingers slipped on your face, turning you to me, as my grin spread again. “We can try to learn.”
“I’ll always find you,” you bragged, from my back, as soon as I stepped inside. “Despite that horrendous hair colour.”
When they finally part ways, Draco feels like he’s never been more exposed, despite the fact that they hadn’t exchanged a word besides a polite “goodbye.”
Draco pulled his hand away from the wall. "The renovations must have triggered it. Tell me how you acquired this house."
. He brings Harry’s fingers to his face, leans a cheek against the warm palm. Harry doesn’t pull away and when Draco looks at him again, Harry’s smiling.
"Nice try," Harry said. He put the pack in his jeans pocket. They left the house still bickering about what Muggle restaurant to eat at.
Draco approaches her with faltering steps, and Elle’s smile only brightens when he does so.
, think about what it means. He lifts his head defiantly, glaring at Draco. “Don’t you think I don’t know what this is? You send your friends here because you don’t trust me to be alone anymore.”
Of course Charlie Weasley is back, and of course Harry had loved to talk to him. Draco’s chest tightens, and it takes a moment to realise that what’s flaring inside him is neither the bond nor his magic, only old and common jealousy.
Draco thought for a moment. What was he going to do about it? He looked towards the path leading to the forest and away from the village, and then back to Harry, who’s cheeks had a rosie hue. Could he really make a difference to his life? Could he really stop running if he accepted Potter’s help?
"That’s a baseless rumour, as I’ve said many times." The lie came easily. Harry had agreed with Kingsley post-war that it would fuel more speculation if they confirmed all the details of Voldemort’s defeat. It remained a mystery to all but a handful of people, sworn to secrecy.

So, after a moment, Kingsley pats his arm and stands. “I’ll be back on Sunday to see the results, if you haven’t moved from that spot I’m forcing you back to the Manor.”
“Well I can’t imagine him leaving them down there.”

It made sense if he really thought about it, and he does drag LuLu to the Astronomy tower so he can muse out loud to her and make sense of the bullshit.  He’s already had one life altering decision: becoming Dumbledore’s spy. He had used all three to make that. Draco had dreamed of a life with and without the Dark Lord, criticized every plan to perfection, and only after careful consideration had he chosen. What would his next one be?

“Do you have anyone else?” Draco asks.
No it hasn’t. The worst is Sirius finding them, turning out
“Yes…” the other man looks ashamed, “Yes I’m aware but the Malfoy boy-”
“And why does this-”
They finish the buttons with their own, Harry makes sure his is the biggest, and then lets the Slytherins and Hermione charm clothing that he brought with him. Hermione is the only one allowed to touch his underwear, and yes, he does make her hide in the corner so no one else can see it.
“You’re gay, yes, I know. I don’t care about that, but Luna is probably going to spend the evening with her
“Harry,” Hermione begins in her mum voice, “You need someone too. You’ll be forced to stand there awkwardly and dance with McGonagall if you don’t.”
That seems to bring some sense back into Snape, who had been on the verge of breaking his tea cup. It would’ve been a shame really, they were having Draco’s favorite, a mix of mint and chamomile. Seeing a chance to cool Snape off further, Draco bites a rather large bullet.
The boy rolls his eyes, “Whatever. Isn’t it time for Draco to spill his guts?”
“Isn’t that the muggle-born Potter frightened half to death the other day?” Draco asks.

He has no time to consider whether the exchange was real. He’s glad he’s had one last meeting with Elle, even if it was all in his head. His heart feels lighter, his chest not so tight.
Andromeda was sweeter with Draco than she was with Harry. He wasn’t jealous, it was just strange to see her direct her fussing at Draco, who took the extra servings without complaint. At the end of the night, when Teddy was in bed and Draco had left, Andromeda turned to Harry.

“We are not!” Hermione moans, “We’re just friends!”
He’s not allowed to sleep even though his body is begging to lay down and rest. A bed sounds wonderful, but he knows that even if he does make it to his ‘bed’ in his ‘room’ before tomorrow, he won’t feel safe enough to actually sleep. No, that will have to wait until August when he can finally go back to Hogwarts.
“You’re the one who isn’t being open, hiding things, and clearly in need of help even though you refuse to admit it. We are, and have always been, loyal to you. We’re just tired of you not returning the favor.”
“Probably his stomach,” Goyle says, but the voice is turning oddly familiar.
The smile so bright Sirius wants nothing more than to protect him and keep him from looking like the sad, helpless boy he had spoken to at the top of the Astronomy tower.
“No, just too much of a raving lunatic at times.”
He’d called in the big guns for this day.
even though the page had been blank just two seconds ago.
Draco runs to it, throws it open, and stares, focusing on how much he dislikes Potter, how much he wanted to strangle the idiot, how much he was going to taunt and bully him for this entire lack of thought process. He thinks and mummers and curses, and nothing shows. Just his own grey eyes looking at him. It makes sense, Snape is right, he doesn’t actually hate Potter, or even consider him a foe, they are on the same side of course, the Anti-Dark Lord crew or whatever the hell they were going to call themselves. Naming hadn’t really been on the mind with Potter constantly meeting up with pieces of the Dark Lord, oh Merlin, imagine if Potter really did meet up with the Dark Lord. It wouldn't end well for either of them, the Dark Lord would surely- The glass in his hand burned, and to his utter surprise, he was looking at a young-yes attractive- man, staring over a bleeding Harry Potter and an unconscious Ginny Weasley. At least, Draco really hoped she was just unconscious.

On the plus side, maybe his watery eyes and the fact that this group of idiots cares for him means he’ll survive these intense training sessions. Maybe even the war looming in the distance, or Draco’s clear need to strangle him.
He’s here. Draco can finally hold him, kiss him, grab every part of his soul and bind it to his own until there’s nothing left to say, until they become one. There’s no warmth in their touch, not even when Draco’s lips come to rest on Harry’s, or when Harry’s hand grabs tightly onto his waist for dear life. But he doesn’t mind that in the least.
"In the meantime, I’m happy to help," Neville said, cheerful.
"As much as it pains me to say this, you were a good Seeker," Harry conceded.
The air turns stale and cold, and he convinces himself it’s not Harry’s magic, that it’s his own panic growing inside his stomach.
Draco’s eyes widen. “You-!”
stop talking, did you know that?”
Harry’s eyes widen. “I get to see them?”

Pansy and Hermione make a terrifying sight when they team up together.
Harry, to Draco: Why are Ron and Lavender so gross?
At first he’d been furious, because while he knew muggles weren’t all that bad, they were still kinda scary, and most muggle things have a wizard alternative, so he thought the whole thing was stupid.

Draco shutters at the memory, but rises again, pointing his wand directly at the captive fairy in front of him. “
“I was thinking he deserved a break, but this isn’t quite what I meant.”
“What? No! ‘Mione-”
Life went on at Hogwarts, Pansy did eventually forgive him for his outburst at lunch, and he had even cornered Snape and Dumbledore to talk about Black and why they should be Worried and Very Alarmed, which they both were but hadn’t thought to tell him in light of his adventures the first day back. Hogwarts was, and remains, impenetrable. A small favor really. Defense Against the Dark Arts quickly became one of his favorite classes, never boring and with a teacher who, despite his awful robes, was kind and unusual. Maybe during Christmas break Lupin would find himself with a new wardrobe, but who’s to say.
His wand is out and pointing, Hermione screams, Lupin tries to hold him back and then, because the scene isn’t enough as is, Snape bursts into the room.
harry, getting into a fight:
rises, where do you think he and his Death Eaters will come? Just like last time they’ll want to be at the Manor and I cannot allow that to happen. I’ve already found the protective and repellent wards we can use, but I’ll need a minimum of ten hours to do it by myself, five if I have help from you two. I also can’t do it with Lucius in the house because he’ll know what I’m up to and try to stop me, but if Draco takes him to the World Cup, I can work freely. Plus, you act like I don’t put my son over everything. Do you know how many witnesses are there? How much security? Lucius has seats reserved in the Minister’s box for every home game, they’ll be sitting next to dozens of Aurors on top of security guards and powerful wizards, I assure you I wouldn’t propose this if I hadn’t thought it through. I’ve already had a portkey made, enchanted Draco’s robes for protection, and broached the topic with Lucius.”

“Good,” Dumbledore smiles. “How has your day been so far?”

It’s not what Potter is expecting. “What do I want?”
.” The elder Malfoy spits, and to Harry’s horror, the man raises his hand and pushes his son to the floor.
“Can I buy you another?”
And Harry fucking does it. Follows him blindly up at least ten sets of stairs, through a few secret passages, and right to the Astronomy towers. He goes without a word or a second thought and blimey how the hell was this idiot not dead yet. Draco’s half tempted to ask what the fuck Harry thought he was doing; the two had been enemies and he
“Draco, he murdered my parents-”
“It’s a long story,” Lucius says. “But it can be explained momentarily. Molly, I believe you wanted to see your husband?”
“.....it helps her grow edible arsenic.”
A sheer look of confusion and panic.
“I already had breakfast.”
“Yes,” Narcissa raises an eyebrow, no doubt where Draco got that annoying trait, “But I’m curious as to how a child knows about it?”
“Hey!” Draco rolls from the couch to the floor so he can stand and properly glare. “My control is better than Pansy’s and Blaise’s! Also, it’s only day
him if anyone starts to give him shit. It’s him, his friend, uncomfortable clothing, and one Italian club. The latter two facts make him nervous beyond belief, but at least he won’t be doing this alone.
.” Lucius says, holding his wand to the masses. He moves in to grab his son, not knowing about the three in the present that follow him out of the room.
It doesn’t stand a chance in the face of the horrors he’s seen, the evil things he’s done. Logic can’t save him from the cold that’s apparently a permanent part of his body now. It can’t help his emotion filled brain that’s overwhelmed by the sight of his room. By his wand, on his bedside table, by the sheets that should’ve been burned, by the trophies that he never really earned, by the Dark Mark that’s forever a part of him now.
Harry: fuck.
….He knew there was something Dumbledore and Snape had been keeping from him. On the plus side, surely he wasn’t close.
something.
Draco marches out of the Great Hall and towards his next class, which should be starting in roughly thirty minutes. Pausing outside the door, he turns his head to the window. Despite there being Dementors around every corner, it’s beautiful beyond the walls of the castle. Like a perfect fall day, trees beginning to brown, cool breezes he can feel through the glass, it reminds him of his first broom ride. Quidditch would be starting soon, and if he got to fly in this weather it would make up for the shitty start of the year.
Now it’s Harry’s turn to blink. “Look, if I win this, I won’t be winning it for Hogwarts. I’ll be winning it for whatever fucker forced me into this mess, and I don’t plan on giving the asshole the satisfaction.
Pansy’s squeal sends them all into a tizzy of sorts, Ron sticking close to Draco’s side because Draco isn’t really buying much. Well, he’s still getting two pairs of boots, a new cloak for himself (and a surprise one for Ron), gloves, and a small green handkerchief. His other one was ruined after the last Malfoy Gala when he was ten.
“There you are,” he makes an effort to keep his tone even, “Have you two been pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? I’ve been looking for you; I want to show you something really funny.”
to look after me?!”

it’s Harry’s turn.
Dumbledore offers him a sweet from his candy bowl, Draco’s favorite lemon drops, so he takes one, waiting for the answer to his question.
“Anyone’s better than the current guy, now hurry up, the sooner we shower the sooner we get to go to bed.”
Blaise makes a snide comment in response that Draco ignores so he can slam his book down and glare at Potter.
Snape, unfortunately, does not let him sneak into his office when he chews the two idiots out, nor does he say anything more than ‘yes, he’s safe’ and ‘no, you are not allowed to hex him’ followed by ‘get out of my office Draco, it’s past curfew’.

“Well we’re not gonna do it by fighting, are we?” Harry yells over her. “And like, look, a Dragon named Helga can’t be as scary as Geia. Aren’t Dragons just giant snakes with wings?”
blaise: my heart has never known such agony
She, of course, gets irrationally irritated at it and storms out of the library, Ron on her heels.
Harry is different. Despite the magic holding him here, he’s alive and vibrant. He’s energetic around Draco, he enjoys listening to Draco as much as talking. He’s curious about the world, about everything Draco has to tell him, and his naive excitement is something beautiful to watch.
Harry studies him keenly, teeth worrying his lower lip, and Draco is not sure if that’s fascination or suspicion.
"Is it stupid that I want it to stay the same?" Harry asked, his voice soft. The idea of letting anyone even sleep in that room made him heartsick. But Harry couldn’t live in a memorial garden, a house preserved in amber. This house had been left a poorly kept museum for long enough.
“Don’t be such a
“Do you think that was what he planned with Hogwarts’ tree?”
Draco glances around once. He’s not in the forest anymore. He looks around again and the landscape finally sinks in.
“No buts,” Draco lets out, firmer, more confident. “I love you, Harry. I know who you are, and what you bring with you. And I want it all. I want to be by your side and you to be by mine. Will you let me?”
Draco smirks, bumping his shoulder against Harry’s and making the bond vibrate with anticipation. “Thought about me often, did you? And I’ll have you know the craft of potion making is delicate and uniquely challenging. You wouldn’t understand it, you brute.”
Millicent had put two and two together. "Draco Malfoy of all people should really know better."
But...
“Okay. I’ll come with you, but only if we can do that again.”
He cried himself to sleep every night until he left Denmark.
"Astoria—" Gemma began, hesitating. "Don't you think it might be unwise to spend an entire week with her when she is dating Ginevra Weasley?"
"Why Quidditch?"
"Nothing for you to sign, no. Let me make a call though, let me book us somewhere for lunch, and I’ll figure something for you to do for the afternoon."
"It’s New Year’s Eve," Draco said, as if this was supposed to mean something to Harry. "My friends are going out." Harry stared back, puzzled. "I wanted to see if you want to come."
Britta hoots softly and nuzzles her head against Draco’s hand like a cat as he unties the note from her leg. The missive is short and direct:
"They called him Sam Jagoff," Luc said, making a crude gesture.
Hermione is halfway to the door when it opens again. Luna comes out, closing it behind her before Hermione reaches for it, her lips pressing into a thin line and her face creasing softly in a grimace. Her gaze darts between the three of them, stopping at Draco, and he
The bond prickles under his skin, with the desire to be
“Hey, it’s okay,” Harry tries to say to him, once his glazed eyes resemble something alive, and he recognises the grey of Draco’s again.
"It's much more complicated than that," Draco conceded.
"Depends on whether there's toast," Draco said. Harry smiled at him. It turned out to be an awful idea, with crumbs in the bed and honey and butter on their fingers, but Draco gave him one of his genuine crinkle eyed smiles, and Harry found he didn't care at all.
"I want you to come like this," Draco whispered as he took Harry's cock in hand. Harry closed his eyes. He could hear Draco panting in his ear. Again, no wand but Draco's hand was slick and perfect around him. Harry let his legs fall open just a touch wider. It was overwhelming, and he was trying not to buck too much. Draco pinned Harry and rutted against him.
Hermione stiffens, her eyes two heavy stones staring at him sternly. “You should consider yourself lucky we haven’t reported you because of  what you pulled. It was hard keeping it a secret, but Harry insisted nothing happened to you. That he was fine with it.” She frowns, and something different flickers across her face. Betrayal, Draco recognises it. “What were you thinking, Draco?” At his loss for words, she continues with a huff. “It doesn’t… I can’t track him. Harry’s nowhere. It’s like… It’s like he disappeared. You can find him with the bond, can't you?”
"Because you always feel guilty when you've got a crush. My God, what do you even do in therapy?"
The stories weren’t even the majority of his breakdown in his first year playing. That, he could credit to a childhood marked by neglect, indifference, and a mistrust that had followed him into adulthood. There was the creeping influence of a war that had started before he was born. It was facing his own death.
Hermione laughed. "Honestly? It’s fine. I still can’t believe the Wizarding world is so behind in legal rights. Most of the trials are like someone wanted all the showy parts of a witch burning without any of the minimum evidence standards. Then McMillan had the gall to tell me that traditions are our ancestors guiding us. Whose fucking ancestors? Shall we allow them to bully us from the grave into perpetuating injustice?"
Draco’s heart goes all the way up to his throat and he has trouble remembering how to breathe. His own magic flares up inside of him, recognising his equal, his partner. It wants to reach, to touch him, to be with him. Draco tones it down by sheer desperation.
"Why?" George said later, in the garden alone with Harry. Harry could think of many questions that could be, but he thought he understood more than anyone how it felt to know your loved ones were gone and people who seemed far less deserving were alive and well.
He thinks that, yes. He
Harry knew he was being dismissed. Perhaps he could explain that he was tired, and his ankle was bothering him again, and he always worried it was the first sign of the end of the road for his career. That he wasn’t sure if the food was made or stolen, and it made his skin itch.
"Luna says Tabitha Edgecombe makes art now, did you hear?" Gemma said.
Afterwards, Harry bought a salad and took the train back to London, getting in late enough that there were no signs of Malfoy when he returned home. Harry went to shelve the records. He was certain he would run out of space, but then the house shivered and gave him an extra shelf, so they all stood up straight.
“Why?” I backed away, but my eyes couldn’t find yours anymore.
Harry’s cheeks are blushing when he finally replies, “Yes, almost every day.”
“You smoked, too,” she accuses with a firm scowl. She backs away to her bed, but when the pain is too strong she has to stop and hold still for a second.
The room, spacious as it is, always feels suffocating before the start of a meeting starts. The silence stretches in the space between the still empty chairs. And Draco loves it. He loves that he can test all the seats before choosing one—even if he always chooses the same. He loves that, when he’s alone in here, the walls whisper secrets only he can hear.
"Fancy some laudanum?" Draco shook the bottle.
"Rookie needs a nickname," Luc said. "Atty Blake. What does Atty stand for?"
"You saw there’s also a lot of magical instinct involved. You wouldn’t be half-bad, I think. The house would be in far worse condition otherwise."
Falcons fans were chanting full-voiced like it wasn’t early in the morning. It stirred Harry's heart as always. A flashing silver banner read "Welcome home Oliver". Oliver acknowledged it with a point, and that section went wild waving Falcons flags. Atty couldn’t help herself, and she also broke formation to wave happily at her family. They made so much noise, Harry heard them screaming, "Go Atty go!"
Merlin, one glass of wine and a solitary gesture of friendship by Draco was making Harry soft.
"Harry!" Teddy said, sitting down next to him. "You guys beat the shit out of the Arrows."
Draco had started the research on his own, but as soon as Pansy and Granger got wind of it, they joined him. And since he needs help to go through this material and to determine what is useful for their case, he agreed to work with them. He’s thankful for that now. The company releases some of the pressure inside his chest, reminding him they’re doing this because Harry’s life is at stake, and also Granger’s preliminary knowledge on the curse will probably be helpful.
They spent most of the time in the new parlour, but, as Draco left that day, he turned back and looked at Harry very intently. "Many happy returns."
On this trip, there was something fun about taking Draco around the new stadium and the pitch they had built. There was no one around except team members, staff, and families, so Harry could relax. He showed off a little for training until Stella started to make fun of him. After they met in the tunnel to the Floo, he burned off a little pre-match adrenaline by kissing Draco breathless in a narrow side corridor.
Now Draco was the one whose voice caught when he went to answer. "Yes, I’m going to—" Harry nipped his neck a few times, and Draco came all over his hand, gasping. Harry sat down heavily next to him, leaning on Draco’s shoulder. Draco cleaned them both with another wordless gesture, and Harry pulled his pants back up, feeling both uncertain and exhilarated.
"Were your parents always like that with you?" Harry asked. Lucius, he could imagine. But Narcissa had risked her life for Draco. He thought about her face sometimes, during the battle, hoping her son was alive.
, Harry says. He tells Draco where he went after that.
They must be making tons of galleons. But even that indignant thought isn’t enough to dissuade that little spark of hope burning inside of him.
“Don’t fucking care what you wear, Potter.” You snapped, and it almost made me flinch. “Just… You always look good.”
“Is it working?”
Draco doesn’t dwell much on the fact that the life he’s trying to save is his own, even more than Harry’s. He’s selfish, but he’s also guilty.
“I’m afraid.” I turned around, leaning my head against her chest. Luna’s hand came to rest at the small of my back. “What if I don’t know what I want? What I am.”
, he repeats constantly. Work, drink as much coffee as he can, go home, read the papers, and drink until he falls asleep on the couch. This is a good routine.
"Of course I came," Draco said, as if there had never been a question of him being here. "I came to all the games. Congratulations." Harry thought about that flash in the crowd all those matches high up in the stands. Harry had a speech prepared for after the finals, at a party with everyone. Harry planned to invite him there though he didn’t have the wording right yet.
"A little bit like that. See, the match ends as soon as I break formation here because, unless their Seeker catches early, they’ll lag behind for the rest of the match," Harry said.
Once more, Draco reminds himself he’s not the only one who has lost Harry. Blaise and Theo had always been there to help them whenever Draco or Harry needed it—not that Harry would remember that he was once friends with a bunch of Slytherins. He hasn’t asked, but he figures they’re receiving the silent treatment much as Draco.
