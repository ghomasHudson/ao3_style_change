The girl didn’t even spare him a second glance before marching out the hall. Leaving he could see both Blaise and Theo get up as well. Crabbe and Goyle would surely follow as well. They were clearly as curious for his explanation as Pansy was. Hopefully, they wouldn’t throw a hissy fit as big as hers was sure to be. Exiting the hall, the Slytherins headed for the bathroom. The one closest to the hall was for some reason always empty. Perhaps people felt uncomfortable doing their business where they were still able to hear voices coming from the hall.
Almost forgetting that Hermione was right next to him, he let the tears fall and they thickly rolled down his pale cheeks. Normally he would have been embarrassed to let his friend see him like this, but it wasn’t possible to stop them.
“Really? It seems like he wants to scratch my eyes out.” Harry hurriedly moved his head aside as a clawed foot felt for his face.
he was-“ Harry answered his question. “Then I believe someone truly extraordinary could have loved him, a tiny bit at least. But she would have had to compromise a lot if she was on the light side.”
“First of all, Knott-“ Dean intervened teasingly. “You won’t. Secondly, we are divided into teams of two, Slytherin against Gryffindor-“
“Oh.” His heart was starting to pond. Imagining Draco’s idea of them together. It would hardly be only for Draco’s enjoyment to feel him licking his body. All the way, up from his lips to all the way down…
“I wonder if my parents would have accepted me. If it would bother them if I was dating- erhm… someone whom weren’t in Gryffindor. My parents and Sirius as well, gave up their lives for me. I just.. I just can’t disappoint them. I think my mom would have perhaps, but I know my dad was all about house pride and or at least Sirius was a little short-tempered. How could I possibly continue my life down this path if I knew they would have wanted something else for me?”
Harry quickly assured him, he would keep it to himself, no matter what. Still, he was rather curious and Jason didn’t seem to mind the questions. They laid back in their own bed talking, until the natural light inside the infirmary began to brighten. Seeing this, the boys became aware of the fact that they had stayed up through most of the night and decided to sleep the few hours they had left before Madam Pomphrey would come and wake them up.
Severus simply shook his head. “Never even knew he was part of our world. I don’t even know if he ever found out I was a wizard.”
“Everything the Prophet printed was pure lies and believe me, when I say they will be printing a retraction in the first print of tomorrow!”
“Granger, Potter and I are going on a date. Next Hogsmeade trip.” Malfoy explained in a tightlipped manner. The following silence seemed to last a lifetime. It couldn’t possibly be, but Harry imagined someone dropped a pin to the floor. Then hell broke loss.
As Harry turned to the front table, it was obvious there was no honey, as well as no other ingredients left. Thinking there must be some in the potion storeroom, he went for the smaller door at the other end of the classroom. Entering the darkened room, he looked around for the sweetness. After checking most of room, he finally looked towards the top shelves, where a few honey jars were left. Reaching up and standing on the tip of his toes, he damned his height for the millionth time. His fingers could barely grasp the side of the jar, when a hand from behind him reached over and grabbed it. Becoming startled at the sudden present of another human being, Harry almost fell into the warm body behind him. Moving around in the tiny room was almost impossible with two grown people inside it.
The list continued until he had twelve names on the list. They weren’t specifically ‘the’ person to date, but more of an inspiration as to whom he should be looking for.  It was certainly a start. Finding someone with at least some good qualities could be easier if he could compare them to the boys on the list.
A crash sounded and a giant shadow landed on top of him. Was this really how he was going to die? No one could possibly have heard him scream and no one except Hagrid was anywhere nearby. Still awaiting the agonising pain, he was surprised to hear a familiar squeaking roar. Flashing his eyes open he only saw straight up into a scaly pale stomach. It wasn’t the spider that had landed on top of him but Aodhan!
“Charms. I didn’t read the entire chapter we were supposed to, so I’m kinda’ hopping I can sit in the back.” Harry laughed. Jason joined in and for a while they walked in comfortable silence. They walked through the smaller doorless gate, heading towards the great lake.
“Oh, sure.” Confused the golden boy followed his friend upstairs. Jason didn’t really say what was on his mind but spent the traveling time asking Harry about school, his friends – especially the rather adorable couple always fighting – and what he wished for Christmas. They had taken every possible staircase they could when Harry figured they were on their way to the astronomy tower. It couldn’t get much more private than that. The tower was perfectly located so anyone on to could hear if someone was approaching on the spiraling staircase. Many couples used it when they were in the need of change from a broom closet or the dorm room.
This time Ron sent Harry a look, hoping to gain some support. Harry ignored it. He didn’t have anything against school, but he certainly wasn’t stupid enough to tell Hermione, that he as well, had no idea.
Rising abruptly, Potter and his friend left the great hall, curiously, his godson left his seat barely a second later. Draco was clearly up to something, and involving Potter, it could only lead to trouble. He finished the last of his breakfast slowly. Massaging his temple, Severus mentally prepared himself for another day of teaching. Pulling himself together, he marched out of the great hall.
“Apologize?! I most certainly have no intention to do so. If anything, Potter should be begging me to reconsider my offering of friendship to him. Me, apologize? Preposterous.” Draco grumbled into his hand as he placed his elbow on the table.
“Draco, even if I were to believe you to be in any kind of… relationship with Potter, then please explain this.”
Thank you to everyone liking the story and especially the two people who have commented. I really appreciate it !
“THIS IS NOT A DISCUSSION.” His father yelled at him in pure outrage. Shocked, Draco simply stared down at the floor, emotions flying through him. Anger at his father, fear for having to marry Pansy, and pure worry for having to hurt-
“It doesn’t matter what he said or did. I lost control amongst my peers and I could truly have injured Malfoy or even another student. And while I wouldn’t trust him further than I could throw him, it is no excuse. I hurt Blaise by hurting his friend. It’s unforgiveable and if it happens again, I will leave Hogwarts permanently. My- Professor Snape has informed me of my punishment and Blaise is barely speaking to me right now.”
He turned back to his work, and tried to ignore Weasley’s angry brown eyes on his back. Draco hoped, hoped so hard he thought his heart would shrivel from the force, that Weasley would let it go. He didn’t need one of the Golden Trio publicly ribbing him. They were like the alpha wolves to this pack of sheep. Once they did something, you could be sure everybody else would follow suit, even in the case of Weasley, who, in Draco’s opinion, had no more brains than the common mountain troll.
, Potter. I’ve just come from practice, which was a fucking fiasco, and it rained, and I nosedived into this massive muddy puddle. To make it worse, we weren’t allowed to do any drying or cleaning charms on ourselves because there was a bunch of temporary Muggle technology nearby which would break if we did, so I stayed filthy, and I’ve just gotten practically cooked alive in your stupid Floo, which I
“We’ve essentially snuck into the Headmistress’s office, and she doesn’t know we’re even coming? Never mind how you know her fucking password, aren’t we going to be in deep—”
And Draco’s mouth slipped open a tiny bit, as he watched Potter reliving it. His green eyes were glossy, and Draco had never been more confused. The echo of Potter’s rough, sensuous voice saying
*************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
There was a muffled shout from upstairs, and both Ginny and Harry craned their necks to see Harry’s blazer zooming down the stairs towards them. As they looked, Ron staggered out from the landing, face beetroot red. Hermione’s cackles echoed all the way from the far corner of Harry’s bedroom.
They walked on, Slytherin code preventing either of them from harsher words, and for once Draco was grateful for the code of etiquette their families had impressed upon them, allowing them to finally just move on from something as easy as breathing.
Harry blushed hotly, but did not avert his eyes, and from between them there arose a new sense of being, as though they’d wanted each for so long, been through so much, years of history had clouded their view of one another. Now, it was like they were seeing each other freshly for the first time in… God, since Harry had refused that first handshake from that pale, grey- eyed eleven year old who’d shouldered in front of him with easy, firstborn- son confidence.
She sniffed, and jerked her head to the gleaming silver Quidditch Cup sitting on a high shelf to her left. Draco eyed it too, turning with Potter to look at the magnificent trophy.
“Do you still…” Harry’s throat tightened. The age old instinct to provoke Malfoy was warring with this new, powerful urge to dip his head and please him. He tried to go for a pleasantly neutral tone, something sick churning in his gut.
“WE’RE GOING TO THE WORLD CUP FINAL!” Blaise howled to the ceiling. Draco felt his lips stretch upwards in a smile.
“No!” Draco said, glaring at the offending creature. “I won’t reward obstinacy. He wouldn’t go round the house. It’s a simple service, and he was below par.”
“What do I not understand about sacrifice, huh? What, you want to tell me how much people hate me here? How much it pains them to see me in their school? Well, I’ll tell you something,
“Fine,” Draco croaked, and immediately cringed at the vulnerability in his voice. He cleared his throat, glancing at Zabini out of the corner of his eye. “I mean, great, yeah, I’m okay.”
Harry slid back into his chair and allowed himself to go boneless. His right leg was tremoring from being clenched so stiffly, and his jaw felt wrong somehow, like the bones had been clicked out of place. He was too strung out to check the area. Instead, he just sagged on the seat, running a tired hand through the curling thickness of his hair. It beggared belief.
“This isn’t me making some joke about it, or being a jealous prick- despite what you seem to think, Malfoy, Potter and I are not involved, neither have we ever been involved.” He raised an eyebrow archly. “Not that it’s any of your bloody business.”
There. Now, when he returned for Quidditch practice next week and nobody had written anything more, Draco would know that he’d been fooling himself. But a tiny voice, gouging an acid hole in the pit of his stomach, murmured, “What if someone replies?”
her for a month and intercepted all her mail in case she was dating someone. You blocked her Floo, jinxed her so she couldn’t Apparate, and hid her broom in your wardrobe.”
He got like this sometimes when he was by himself in new spaces, forced to interact and be confident, sociable, easily talkative like other people were. It had crept up on him the past few months, made drastically worse by the long summer break after the two intense years of Auror training. When he had been around Ron in the working week, he was generally stable. If he had any little relapses he could just stick close to Ron, but he was normally able to talk to other people and he’d be ok. But these past months of hanging out only with their tight little circle of friends who were either living in or constantly visiting the Burrow had seen him slide inexorably backwards into a place he’d never been before. His little ‘anxiety irregularity,’ as Hermione called it, had escalated into a full- scale (though undiagnosed) problem. He now found it incredibly hard to be around other people, whether they were strangers or even just people he didn’t see often.
“Wha time s’it?” he asked the room, squinting in a way that was desperately cute. Draco’s stomach tightened.
“It’s not about that! Of course it occurred to me to use fucking Alohomora, but it goes against my principles! I shouldn’t
He tried to form words, to defend himself against the incredibly low blow, because no matter the animosity between the two of them Draco had always thought Potter was too noble to ever mention that day.
“—your principles, yeah, we know,” Blaise finished, re- entering the kitchen and leaning against the countertop opposite Draco. His lean legs were draped in jogging bottoms, baggy fabric hanging just right over his strong calves and thighs. A sleeveless flannel shirt was carelessly unbuttoned over his chest, and Draco knew he looked kind of edible.
Salazar, they’d been doing this for years! And now Potter was wounded? Draco swallowed the liquid remorse trickling like a bitter river down his throat.
********************************************************************************************************************************************************
He extended his own hand, hesitated a second before twining their fingers. It was wildly different from the desperate, dry squeeze of Pansy’s hand minutes beforehand. Potter’s palms were lightly calloused, fingers long and strong. His palm engulfed Draco’s own one, the difference in their skin tones marked. It sent a shiver down Draco’s spine, seeing that. Because yeah, he’d always been vaguely aware he had slim fingers, delicate palms. But seeing them covered like that by Potter’s long, elegant hands, tan sinew just spanning them like it was the easiest thing in the fucking world—
Ginny gave a wry laugh. “Oh, you know what, it’s so nice, but - and I hate to say this because it’s really good, but I can only eat a certain amount of slow release, high fibre foods at the moment. It’s a special diet the coach is putting us on.” She looked regretfully at her bowl, pushing it away. “I don’t think I can have any more.”
Malfoy had rolled his hips, pressing what was definitely an erection (if Harry had to estimate, he’d say… fucking big) against Harry’s own cock, their boxers sliding over one another, the delicious friction sliding Harry’s eyes closed as he moaned unconsciously.
He gave a hum of agreement, squeezing his eyes even tighter shut. Trying to block out the reality that was hounding him now, cornering him into all these fucking realisations that just maybe he didn’t want to have.
“Don’t think so, sir.” He tried to sound gruff, or at the very least disaffected, and heard Potter snort behind him.
“My eyes are up here?” Malfoy finished for him. The faintly sarcastic edge of his voice was enough to make Harry’s flush redouble its efforts.
Draco physically could not speak. All his energy was going into not getting an erection right there and then, and the images of Potter… open for him, were too much. It was all too much.
Draco must have written it. But his Malfoy curiosity made his fingertips itch. Prove it, his mind screamed. Prove you wrote it.
Draco cut in, feeling his heart climb stupidly into his throat. He wasn’t going to cry, no, that would be ridiculous. But his voice was jagged. “Besides, McGonagall probably wouldn’t believe me that her precious, perfect Golden Boy ever led a Death Eater astray. The very notion of it would probably rock her world order.”
And then there was that awful sucking, drilling sensation that pressed relentlessly inwards, squeezing Draco until his skull felt as though it were on the verge of splintering; his eardrums would surely burst from the pressure, and he wanted nothing more than to be free from the feeling—
the benefactor, seeing as the Zabini vaults’ll be the ones shelling out for this lavish meal,” Blaise said acerbically, sitting back with a sated expression.
Draco grinned. “You needn’t look at him like he’s a different species, Pans; we’ve both seen you shovelling in cereal in the morning like it’s going out of fashion.”
Draco spoke up, pressing down the anxiety inside him. “If anyone’s free and wants to spectate, that’s fine by us. But, like you said, Professor… it’s just a practice match.” He swallowed, feeling it necessary to elaborate a little. It had, after all, been his idea. “I’m, um, aware this is a little irregular, and I know normally we just practice in our house teams. But it’s a Muggle custom to have houses play each other less competitively, too. For the sake of getting, you know. Accustomed to the game again. And I just thought since the team was getting a bit restless, it might take the edge off. Challenge them.”
He was completely taken by surprise, so much so that he actually rocked back on his heels a fraction, jaw locking up in disbelief. He could feel his eyes lock onto the thin white loops of cloth wrapped around Potter’s wrists and his breaths were suddenly ragged.
Pansy looked annoyed by now. “No, I’m not talking about an escort. And stop interrupting. This ad was for more like a… therapist. A positivity person. But in a resort? You book a stay at this resort, and you spent three days being rehabilitated and given wellness support. So I booked this thing, but when I got there…” she pouted suddenly.
Draco was stony- faced. “Exactly. So if your question was whether or not it occurred to me to use a fourth year spell, the answer would be- do you take me for a fucking idiot?”
Zabini curled his lip. “I’ll leave you two adolescents to neck some other time. What are we doing? I’d prefer to get out of this ferret’s general vicinity—” he pointed a long brown finger at Draco “—as soon as I possibly can.”
Draco thought that maybe it was strange he didn’t even feel satisfied, or vindicated. He was only hot, and itchy, and annoyed they’d lost this much time arguing. His brain was foggy with green fucking eyes, the same pair as always, and silently he damned the inventor of the Wistful Draught. Undoubtedly a hopeless romantic. Probably a Hufflepuff too.
He mulled it over for days, as Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff practiced and practiced and practiced. He hoped they were putting all this time to good use. They’d need it anyway. Draco and the Slytherin team had been in and out quite a bit, too, and they were shaping up to be pretty lethal. In fact, he was surprised Gryffindor hadn’t been practicing during that week- he was in the midst of wondering why- and also, incidentally, just about to duck into the Charms classroom- when Blaise Zabini shouldered past him roughly, striding into the room with agitated eyes.
Draco began to think, and then banged the lid on that thought so hard that the mental reverberations made him a little dizzy.
“And, for the record, I don’t credit you for that shit in the War. You just kept your own nose clean. You let people call you Saviour, and did nothing. Fucking loser.”
“Bit the dust, yeah,” Zabini said, and rolled his eyes. “God, I’m tearing up, Malfoy. You and your fucking sob story.”
.” He didn’t mean to say it out loud, but it tore out of his throat anyway, a serrated blade dragging over the swirling, glimmering surface of his thoughts, dulling them, sharpening them with pain.
Pansy brushed her dark hair out of her eyes, apparently fascinated by her cereal. She stuffed another spoonful of cornflakes in her mouth and chased it down with a deep gulp of milk from the large flagon-- originally intended for Butterbeer—by her bowl. Pansy liked to have her cereal and milk separately-- she said she hated it when the cornflakes got prematurely mushy. Now, she busied herself by trying to clear the mound of cereal from her bowl as fast as humanly possible, cheeks furiously working like a gerbil on Pepper- Up Potion. The deep swills of milk she was gulping down left a smattering of faint, pale droplets on her upper lip.
Draco snapped back to attention, looking back at Potter, who looked like he was weighing the offer up. After a minute or so in which Draco shifted breathlessly from foot to foot, staring at the ground, Potter opened his mouth, the parting of his lips a welcome sound in the tense silence.
Pansy answered for him, her love of getting questions right overpowering her need to talk solely about the Quidditch girl.
Draco pushed his hair back with a careless hand, suddenly remembering its un-gelled state. He cringed; everyone had seen it. Draco looked up surreptitiously, trying to see if anyone was looking at the state of his hair. He cast his gaze over the Great Hall, but there was only the chatter of students, the emphatic bites of the ever- hungry adolescent. No eyes looked towards Draco Malfoy. And then- out of Draco’s peripheral vision- he sensed somebody watching. Draco flicked his eyes over to the right, and caught a flash of green irises as a dark head was hurriedly bent towards its plate, eyes averted. Draco leant in with a stab of something he couldn’t identify piercing his lungs.
“As far as I’ve heard, you’re the furthest thing from a disappointment there is,” he replied lightly, and matched Potter’s smirk.
Draco got in on the act, checking under the table and coming up faux- confused, shaking his head comically. Pansy watched them get steadily more dramatic, arms crossed across her chest.
“Not all of them, Ron!” Ginny screamed. “It’s so fucking unfair for you to use Fred against everything, when it’s just your own prejudice blinding you. Some of them were born into this! It’s all they fucking knew. Their parents were telling them it was okay! Their parents were telling them it was right! What would you do if Mum and Dad taught you something was right, from the day you were born?”
They stared at each other for a long moment, and Draco’s mouth felt very clumsy as he said, “I- um, I won’t tell anybody. I promise.”
“Look, Draco, I’ll be honest,” Blaise said, resting his elbows on the table. “It’s weird that you feel this uncomfortable around him. The only possible explanation for that is that there’s something- a residual tension- between the two of you. You know the best way to get rid of tension?”
He was snapped back to attention by the sound of Weasley, who was now trying to wring some kind of apology out of Draco for his harshness.
**********************************************************************************************************************************************
He spun to mirror Potter’s pose, leaning back languidly against the stone wall and letting his head rest back, eyes sliding half- lidded as though his mind weren’t racing a million miles a minute.
“But eventually, y’know, you went away, and I had a long time to figure shit out. And it wasn’t like I was unsure of what you’d say. I knew you, and by then I was pretty certain that you were, in fact, in the exact same boat as me. So we split, and I’ve never looked back. Never dated a guy again. And you never dated a girl again, did you, Harry?”
“No there aren’t!” Ginny fought, and all of a sudden she was standing up, hair tangled over her shoulders, fists clenched by her sides. Her nails looked as though they were biting into the Quidditch- roughened skin of her palms, and her colour was high, eyes glittering from alcohol and, Harry realised with a dull shock, tears.
“That’s not the point, Malfoy.” Potter just looked entertained now, and it make Draco’s blood boil, because wasn’t he supposed to have the power here?
“He gets a good morning, and I get a ten- minute lecture on the evils of laziness and misogyny in the wizarding world and how men should try a bit of domesticity for a change?”
peasants.” Pansy sat forward, the neckline of her dark red dress glimmering silkily in the warm light. “And I’m… what? Your beautiful benefactor?”
“Well, I didn’t have a partner, and since Snape was our teacher that year, he thought it’d be a laugh to put me with Malfoy.”
Was he honestly doing this? He was going to tell Pansy everything? Draco tried to pull his hand away from the parchment, take a second to think about what he was doing, but something that had been wound tight deep in his gut stopped him. It needed to be loosened. He couldn’t not tell her now that he had begun. The prospect of finally unburdening himself was too sweet.
Draco interrupted her, holding up a hand. “You did this in secret? I’m assuming your parents are also unaware?”
Ron and Hermione’d be at The Burrow, Ginny too…which meant she’d definitely be up at the crack of dawn, barging into his room. They couldn’t go there; Harry didn’t know if he could explain to them that he’d had sex with their school nemesis because he was now insanely hot and Harry couldn’t
“—Actually, I’ve just remembered that’s not true. I did have a moment. It was gradual after that, but I just remembered I had a specific, out- of- the- blue moment where I suddenly felt attracted to girls. I was at dinner in the Great Hall, kind of tired, y’know, after a really shit day of lessons. You guys weren’t there, or Neville and Luna, or actually anybody I really liked. I was sitting by myself, which I didn’t mind, because I could just eat and let my mind wander. I don’ really remember what I was thinking about, but I remember hearing a group of girls giggling together behind me.”
Potter whimpered, hand reaching helplessly for Draco’s, and Draco soothed him with a graze of the fingers, already drawing his wand from his pocket to slash a cheque into the air. He sent it flying over to the waiter with a flick; that was Potter’s bill dealt with, and Blaise would handle their own. His hand was sure and possessive on Harry’s back, wide over the muscles he’d admired from his own seat, and their tension made something primal and boiling start to churn inside him. He pressed Harry even closer to him and began to walk swiftly towards the exist. Potter was completely gone, only sweet murmurs and whimpers falling from his lips, and one glance at him was nearly too much for Draco. He had to content himself with sliding his arm fully around Potter’s waist as soon as he could; God, it was tiny, deceptively slim, and he could feel- Salazar help him- the tiniest, most luxurious softness at his hips and stomach, lean back muscles giving way to… love handles?
Ginny sighed, reaching a languid arm up to tangle through her long, fiery hair. “Well, that was just one encounter with a girl that made me feel stuff. The first encounter ever. But I had about six years’ experience of having what I thought was a ‘crush’ on Harry here.” She patted his head clumsily. “At first, I tried to ignore the whole girl thing. Then, when I started dating Harry, I actually came to terms with it, but our relationship was kind of… comfortable, and I didn’t know it should be more than just that, so I thought I could be bi. And I kidded myself into thinking I loved you. No offence.”
“I—” he began eloquently, only to break off with a hitch in his breath. He curled his lip on reflex, only just escaping biting his lip like a child.
“No? I didn’t think so. So I would say,” and Draco leant forward, drunkenness leaching out of him as though he’d never had anything at all, “that you should maybe shut your trap about things regarding ‘only me’.”
. Because my parents were in love! They were in love, and everyone could see it. Maybe if they’d been like everyone else from the start I would have been okay when they split a few months back.”
“You idiot, Draco!” Theo said shrilly, and started to laugh. “Why are you using that bloody leaflet—” He broke off, and bit his lip, tear tracks still shining on his cheeks.
Outside the classroom, there was a flurry of robes and shoes on stone, scuffling noise and low chatter obscuring the rest of his sentence. Draco clenched his jaw in frustration, intrigued. He scooted closer to the other boys, and listened intently, opening up his bag and pretending to look for something in it.
Draco coughed awkwardly, shifting in his seat. The restaurant’s music started up again, and a low hum of chatter threaded across the room, ripples of conversation whispering in his ears.
“So, Malfoy,” Potter said, throwing Draco into a mild panic because Salazar, he’d forgotten they’d have to talk and he hadn’t fucking prepared notes.
that echoed syrupy in his ears. His vision narrowed to Potter’s pale cheeks, his dark hair sliding messily under those ridiculous fucking glasses, those damn
Harry rolled over with a groan, cheek damp with- he recognised with a faint sense of disgust- drool. He reached an arm out blindly, fingers groping clumsily over the bedside table until he felt the cool slide of lenses and metal underneath his fingers. Coughing, he grasped his glasses by the nose bridge, opening them and stuffing them onto his face hastily.
you was getting too hot a month ago. So no, I’m not okay, and I would really appreciate something to eat.”
“Very true, Malfoy.” His eyes roved, for a second, over Draco’s face, as if searching for something. He swallowed, and Draco saw his Adam’s apple bob with it. “Very true.”
“Well who did then? Who else was in with the fucking psychotic mask- wearers so much he became one of them?”
Harry raised his eyebrows at Ron, and Ron grinned immediately, nodding almost imperceptibly back at. Ron’s skill in subterfuge had come on in leaps and bounds ever since they’d started having to find creative ways to get rid of the accursed oatmeal. Now, he was wonderful at stalling, and practically as good at lying as Harry, though not quite as quiet on foot. Something about living with the Dursleys and sneaking around upstairs whenever they had company had made Harry completely silent on any type of flooring; even on the creaky wooden planks of Grimmauld Place, he’d had been silent as a tomcat, footsteps ghosting over the oak like silk slipping over steel.
“Apology?” Draco rounded on him, feeling irrationality take control of him. “Why should I apologise?”
Zabini looked down at the textbook as though it were something particularly distasteful, expression pinched. Draco couldn’t resist.
And then there were the jeans clinging to Potter’s strong legs, legs that were wrapped around the back of the chair in such a way that made Draco’s blood rush somewhere south of his stomach. He resisted the urge to cover his crotch ashamedly at the sight of the smart, thick heels on Potter’s leathery boots. He wanted more than anything to see him stand up, to admire the turn of his calf and the thick, suckable curve of his thigh muscle under those jeans, accentuated to tearful perfection by the wedge heel.
“S’pose it runs in the family, doesn’t it?” Zabini needled. “You Malfoys like to play the game, but you don’t fucking know when to stop. You just fall right over the line. And the worst part? You drag everybody else down with you.”
Blaise looked alarmed. “Surely that’s not necessary? I promise, I won’t talk to the waitress. Whenever she comes over I’ll look really ugly. And mean.” He blinked earnestly.
Draco tucked his shaking hands behind his back, folding them into his robes and winding the material tight.
They pulled away from the curb. In silence of the back seat, Harry was suddenly stiff, knees pressed tightly together. He ground the toe of his right boot into the floor, heel high and twisting. He didn’t dare look up at Malfoy, who was equally quiet.
“I, uh, I fell off my broom. Training. I bruised my arm and my side, so Madam Pomfrey thought I should…but I’m… fine now?” Potter grimaced, obviously aware of how thin his excuse sounded.
“Oh, on Salazar.” The other boy gave a heavy, condescending sigh, as though he were about to spell something out for a very tiresome five year old. (Draco would have hexed him, but he was too curious.)
The weight of Malfoy against him, the hard press of their cocks together, that rolling… Harry was wrecked. His breaths were coming raggedly, and he couldn’t think of anything except the pleasure. When his lashes fluttered open slightly, Malfoy was grinning down at him, unbearably smug.
“They were,” Pansy furrowed her brow, looking as though she were searching for the right way to explain it. Suddenly, she shook her head angrily, speaking as though she were just voicing her stream of consciousness. “Salazar, maybe it’s fucking stupid for me to be so sentimental about this. It’s just, when we were younger, you know, I’d look at both of your parents, and Crabbe’s parents, and Goyle’s parent’s, and even bloody Nott’s parents, and I’d think…
Truthfully, all throughout school, Draco had never wanted to be more than friends with anyone, anyone except… well, Potter. It made him cringe to think about it, cringe and shiver and swallow hard, because no matter how much he tried to pass off those feverish daydreams and years of fantasies as a misguided crush, there had been something visceral there that he hadn’t felt since. A mere flash of green eyes, quickly shielded by dark fans of lashes, had been enough to make his heart race. A brush of pale skin, or the sight of the soft fall of Potter’s black hair had made him ache, a full- body ache, as though he were missing something essential. He’d lain in bed, lips parted and reaching, hot and slick with sweat and longing, thinking with such intensity of Potter, Potter, Potter. He’d recognised the tiniest twitches of the other boy’s lips, had studied him for so long with such fervour that he could see his every emotion play out across his face like a Muggle film. Potter had been his constant, a bright sharp obsession to cling to in his greying world.
He staggered to the door, lurching when he reached the handle so that his full weight, combined with the heavy mass of books in his back, fell directly onto the door. It swung open at blinding speed, crashing into the musty interior wall, and Draco fell bruisingly hard on his hands and knees, staring at the unmistakeable floor of-
Impatiently, Draco grabbed his wand and headed for the showers, ripping open the cubicle door and shutting himself inside. He couldn’t bring himself to turn the tiniest degree to the right, so that the writing would be visible. A great pulsing ball of excitement that seemed vaguely disproportionate to the situation sat like an emotional leech in his chest, draining any other thoughts. He closed his eyes, drawing in a breath, trying to calm himself down. Briefly, he wondered if it was sad that he was breathless over this. Then, with a measured step that belied his racing heart, he turned to face the wall.
this person- this secret writer. That was why he’d been so wound up about it. Why he’d wanted to badly to know.
“What’s the matter, Zabini? Eat something at breakfast that didn’t agree with your delicate constitution? Want me to send an owl home to mummy? She must be terribly worried about her darling boy, all alone at school with ex
But the severe cut of McGonagall’s eyebrows softened, her lips smoothing out as she said, “I’m glad you’re feeling better.”
Harry peered out of the window, chest tightening as he recognised the familiarly imposing height of Grimmauld Place, gargoyles leering down from warped iron banisters.
Draco wobbled a bit, and giggled. He figured he was maybe an annoying drunk, but he was also a fucking Slytherin and he wanted respect. He pounded his chest with a lean fist, glaring at a small Ravenclaw girl who scuttled past with a frightened start.
It had just been… a really fucking long night. The only thing he wanted was to get fucked until he wasn’t thinking about anything at all, until their sweat burned off his anxiety and self- consciousness. He wanted Malfoy above him, caging him in, inside him.
And then she’d soften, and say, “Look, I didn’t play Sphinxes and Riddles with him when we were six, did I? I don’t want you to fail, Draco. Come on, I’ll let you look at my notes for the first part of the lesson. Just try and follow what he’s saying now.”
Not giving them a second glance, Harry went inside. Looking at the walls and the portraits decorating them, nothing had changed from his second year. Back when Harry and Ron had infiltrated the Slytherin cave believing that Malfoy could have been the heir of Slytherin. Back then, it had seemed so likely. In a child’s mind, the idea of an annoying spoilt brat whom they hated appeared to be the perfect candidate for a murderer. Now, the idea of Malfoy killing anyone was absolutely ridiculous. He was a prat sometimes, he was definitely not a murderer. Walking past the portraits, he noticed their disdained looks as they watched him walk by. None of them spoke to him, but simply followed his every movement as he passed. Most of them looked to be from the turn of the century. Old clothes, clownish make-up and white wigs.
“Please be good for us now, Aodhan.” He felt his mouth dry out. “You are going to a good place, I’m sure. Dumbledore would only find the best for you. After all, you are a friend, but you are getting too big to stay here and you probably also want to find friends on your own.”
On the way out, Parkinson rudely yelled after him; “Where are you going? We should head to class soon.”
Gathering his cup, Snape poured himself a cup of black tea. “Yes, I have indeed had a busy few weeks and while I appreciate the sentiment, I don’t believe sharing my personal life is appropriate.”
Suddenly the finger was pulled out of his mouth and first then, did he realize he had closed his eyes. Opening the green emeralds at the sudden shock, Harry barely had the time to see, before Malfoy had pushed him against the shelves behind him. The jars around them rattled slightly, but the two of them were much too busy to wonder.
They two boys jumped away from each other as the sound of stone hitting the floor and a loud clink from broken glass could be heard from outside the door. The horrible shrieking of Peeves laughter rendered and some of the younger students had obviously been caught in the middle of the chaos, as at least two different girls screamed. Peeves had probably thrown something through one of the higher windows as the sound of glass breaking continued.
“Hmm. So you say.” Draco suddenly got a rather sultry look in his eyes. Leaning in closer to his boyfriend, he whispered hotly against his ear. “Does that mean you would lick chocolate off
Quickly pocketing the note, Harry decided to think about it later. Right now, he had to concentrate on his notes. After all, it was only a few days into the new semester and Harry wasn’t going to give Snape another reason for taking points. Hurrying to write the last few theories he remembered, he prepared to learn the first potion of the year.
“Well I kind of promised to have a snowball fight with the Slytherins. Jason talked me into it. I don’t think it’s a very good idea but-“
“…After school and shortly after I… joined, I was still on the bottom of the line.” Severus refilled his mug. “I had no connection beside the ones from school, no money and certainly no ‘impressive’ background. I only had the skills for dueling and potions. Two items which almost anyone at that point could have given the Dark Lord. I had to fight my way through to gain some respect and I had by that time done… unspeakable things to people. Then the Dark Lord decided to let me prove my worth. A few of the higher ranks was to go on a mission in Australia….”
Aodhan stretched his wings and turned them to lie down against his back. Turning around the dragon looked him deeply in the eyes and held on. Aodhan had saved his life. Getting up, Harry gently sought out the dragon with a hand. As if he still was guarded, Aodhan shielded away from the hand.
The two had not spoken once since Ginny had revealed his secret to the school. She may not have been the one who ratted him out to the papers or to every single student in school, but it was ultimately her gibber-gabber that had caused so much trouble for him and Draco. Harry wasn’t sure what she wanted but he still felt the green eyed monster in him rear its head when she stood there in front of him.
Looking down at what he had stepped on, he bent over to pick up a stuffed black bear. The brown glass-eyes were way to huge on the small head but in a charming way. The bear’s stomach had a sewn heart on the front in a blood red color. Smiling, Harry looked for the place it had fallen from. Unfortunately, it became clear that there was no way to know which shelf it had fallen from, considering there was almost five complete shelves filled with different stuffed animals in all sizes, colors and kinds. Hoping it wouldn’t matter too much, he brushed off the floordust from the bear’s head and created a little space between a raccoon and another lighter colored bear.
Groaning in thanks, his boyfriend started moving. Carefully at first, getting him used to the full-feeling. Speeding up, Draco replaced his thrusts. Quick and hollow to deep, he managed to hit the amazing bundle of nerves Harry had come to love.
“Merlin it’s getting late. I should head back. I kind of have a long way down unlike you.” He grinned and said goodnight. Harry gave him a small wave as he disappeared down the stairs. He should probably go to bed as well. On the other hand, the view was truly magnificent right then and it would be a shame to miss it.
Thankfully, he somehow kept from shaking as he reached for the letter. Just before he grabbed it, Knott pulled it away and out of reach.
Harry suddenly felt awful. He should have handled it calmer. He knew from the beginning that being with the Slytherin was going to be difficult and at the first moment of disagreeing, he had freaked out and left. He should have stayed and asked Draco why he was acting so weird. Maybe they would’ve found a solution for whatever had managed to rattle him. It was true that Draco had really hurt him by calling them casual, but it also now seemed very suspicious. Draco was the one, whom had initiated most of their dates and the times they had kissed in public, so why did he all of a sudden care how people would see them?
“Hi.” He didn’t step towards the boy to fast in case his anger would be directed towards him, the small chance it was. No answer was received.
For a second it actually looked like Malfoy didn’t have the furthest clue as to what Harry meant. Or at least what difference the second question was to the first. Thankfully, the boy was rather intelligent and Harry didn’t have to wait for too long before it dawned on him.
not believe in purifying magical blood?” Harry hated this type of topic, but one could always hope Malfoy really had changed.
“Stop that,” He started laughing. “You look like an old man.”  Laughing he tried to avoid the hand that pushed his shoulder. Severus got up, brushed the sand from his coat and Lauris followed.
“Students! We will be walking to Hogsmeade together. When we arrive at the bridge to Hogsmeade, you may split up. We meet back by the bridge at EXACTLY three. Tardiness will be punished by point withdrawal.” Professor McGonagall declared. “And Mr. Filch had made me remind you that bringing back any items from Zonko’s or Wasleys’ WILL be confiscated! Am I understood?” A distant mutter around the student bodies arose.
“Everything.” Forcefully a fist banged against the dark tree and the bookcase rattled intimidatingly. “Yes, Harry explained;
Ever since he had moved to Hogwarts and been near Blaise approximately on daily basis, his veela genes had increased in both hearing, strength and unfortunately – in the last case for Malfoy – his protective tendencies. Once again, he glanced at himself in the bathroom mirror, examining his eyes. It seemed so unreal to have a new eye color. Even though he had always liked his blue eyes, this new color represented a part of his mate that he would always carry with him no matter where he went. Even if Blaise left him, the color would remain…
“This.” Blaise held up their entwined hands. “You seem to think I’ll run away the second you let go.”
“Say; I told you so. You were right, I was wrong, and so on!” He snorted as more tears started gathering in his eyes.
Draco had no idea how long they stood like that. Simply embracing each other as if saying goodbye. Pansy’s tears had soaked through his shirt, and even though the feeling was quite unpleasant, he stayed still. Soon, the quiet sniffling stopped and the girl pulled away from him. Even though she was slightly red nosed, she composed herself quickly. Without another word spoken between them, she turned around and left.
“You may, IF you will sit in complete silence and do your homework. I will not have you dallying off.”
Sitting up now, Harry disagreed. “But Blaise is crazy about you, just… more quietly. I’m sure he’ll want to when you tell him, right?”
Nodding his thanks for the slightly helpful information. He hurried towards the stairs. The fourthyears’ mentioned he was angry. Jason was never angry. Sad, perhaps upset, but decisively angry? That was rather out of character.
“Erhm, yeah, sure.” Harry turned over and stood on all fours. He was actually a little relieved that he got to move over, first. He felt embarrassed enough just by lying in front of Draco completely naked. But if he had had to lift his legs and lie there on his back? He would have felt incredible vulnerable.
The rest of the class was rather uneventful. Harry just took a few extra notes on Delusion spells. As the Professor sent them on for lunch, Harry waited for the other boys to join. Luna was waiting with him and had decided to join the Gryffindor table for lunch.
“And you couldn’t just say I wasn’t interested? That I had moved on?” trying to keep the yelling down, he started pacing.
“I see.” Harry really didn’t although his heart skipped a beat when he realized she had only mentioned dragons after he looked after Hagrid’s home where Aodhan was currently hidden away. Did Luna know something or was it simply a coincidence she mentioned it?
“Okay, I guess.” Harry sighed. It probably wouldn’t be any better no matter what robe he found. He just wasn’t that into fancy clothes.
Believing it was time to tell Albus the truth about his youth; Severus took a dep breath before leaning forward, resting his elbows on his knees.
“Seriously?” perplexed he wondered whom had come up with such a password. But before he could enter, a group of girls –probably fourth year - left the common room. They almost jumped back in fright, not having expected to see Harry standing outside waiting.
“Jason, I’m not sure how much of his past Snape had been willing to tell you, but he hasn’t lived an easy life. I think no matter what he says, you are very important to him. I think you are his only family, at least probably, the only one he talks to.”
“What are you doing here, Potter?” a voice from another of the chairs, asked. Zabini had clearly been hanging out with Knott, while Crabbe and Goyle were eating sweets from a Honeydukes’ bag, resting up against the wall.
Bringing their lips together again, the lovers fell onto the couch. Draco pushed their pelvis’ together and their tongues danced against each other; tasting the familiar and the missed. Harry tangled his fingers in the blond locks, almost gripping them enough for Draco to wince. But he held himself back, understanding the need for Harry to feel him as well.
“I promised your parents I would take care of you if anything were to happen to them and I had mentally prepared myself, in case that awful scenario was ever to happen. But in every scenario I had had Sirius beside me.”
Harry almost threw himself to the ground, hurrying to collect snowballs. His gloves were thankfully five-fingered and he was therefor able to make allot and almost perfectly round balls.
Jason had taking the task of busying himself by pouring eggnog into two large mugs. Sliding them across the coffee table, he raised it and cheered ‘Merry Christmas’ before the others joined him.
Draco wasn’t exactly keen to spent so much of his time surrounded by a Granger whom were known to stress and hissy fits whenever an exam was coming up. Beside her, the Weasley was certainly no improvement. How the boy could even have a functioning brain without Granger, would forever remain a mystery. Thankfully, the two were so busy themselves; they hardly took any notice when he sat down across from them at the same table. He suspected Harry had told them to be nice or at least ignore him for most of the time.
The loud snort was very unbecoming and Blaise wrinkled his nose in distaste. Jason was never rude to show such mannerism.
“Hey you, stop it!” Harry laughed as he wrestled what was left of his garment out of the toothy mouth.
For a moment Snape felt as though his lungs had collapsed and trying to silently force air back into his body, he unfolded the paper. Of all the things he had expected a picture certainly wasn’t one of them. But there in the center of the picture was the man whom he had thought of for years after he left Australia. Smiling at the camera, the man is tenderly caressing his slightly swollen stomach before waving at him.
“Dobby could you leave us alone for a bit?” Jason kindly asked the elf. Bowing lightly the elf disappeared with a pop.
“Oh hello, Parkinson.” Jason obviously hadn’t expected the girl to hear him. “We are heading for the library. We are doing the assignment for Magic of History.”
“That’s okay. Well, she is really kind and calm, this one.” Harry laughed as the mare bumped against his hand to continue his stroking. “See?”
“Don’t know, took a chance.” He turned to give him a blinding smile. “Like when I kissed you. Sometimes you just have to go for it.” He took another swing.
But each day – just by those ten minutes he spent in there – he learned so much about the chattering brunette. He was born here in Australia, his parents and him were very close, he loved baking, but hated cooking. Dog-person, loved some comedians Severus didn’t know and his favorite color was green.
“You can’t and I’m not really here.” She came in and quickly closed the door behind her. Slowly she sat down beside him on the bed and Draco was filled with nostalgia of them playing in his room while their parents were downstairs chattering.
“Harry, why are you so tired? You went to bed long before any of us.” Neville asked worried. Harry smiled after he finished grimacing at the bitter taste of black coffee.
“Quite alright Potter. We should get going but we’re probably going to be seeing each other from time to time from now on.” At this, he turned to smirk at Malfoy. Malfoy in return, just chuckled under his breath and winked at Harry. Well, if he wasn’t blushing before, he certainly was now. As much as he hated the Slytherin’s attitude no one could deny the obvious attraction, Malfoy had.
As the other boys around the dorm room woke up and got ready for the day, they slowly made their way to breakfast. This morning the ceiling shone with sunrays. Way to dramatically to be real; Draco thought.
As they passed the first couple of tables, Harry had definitely found a favorite in the flying Hippogriff and the mermaid lying across a rock.
They had both been so lost in each other that when Luna suddenly called out their names, Harry pulled back his hand so quickly he hit it against the table. Holding back from swearing, Harry noticed they had all gotten up from their seats, clearly only waiting for Draco and him to follow suit.
suit their wishes. Draco would help Potter with his homework and therefor-spent time with him in the library, meanwhile the couple would spend any remaining time or every third day together alone before studying.
Draco had to bite his lip hard enough to draw blood, to prevent from coming right there. Seeing Potter like this; needy, panting; What a picture he would have made. But not a picture for anyone else to see. Only him. Only he, got to see Potter writhing underneath him and maybe at some point, over him.
A hand landed on his shoulder and he almost choked as he rinsed the bread with some apple juice. He immediately started coughing.
After speaking for a certain amount of time, Draco seemed to need a break, so Harry suggested they got some refreshments. There were slightly alcoholic beverages at the beautiful ice castle. Most of them seemed to be juices, lemonades and punch but Draco quickly selected two glasses of elf made white vine for them. Harry trusted the teen’s taste as he had no real preferences on win of any kind. The cold drink was rather pleasant; powerful and dry.
Only when Harry had to take an immensely deep breath, did he realize his throat was closing up. Discreetly he tried to hide his own tears of sadness that wasn’t even his own. While Harry missed the thought of parents and the people he wished he had come to know, Jason had lost a parent whom had been beside him all his life, and somehow it seemed much worse.
“I wish to apologies for my earlier behavior. The years where I have been... wrong. It is my intention to change and it would mean a lot to me if you would accept my apology.” He finished very diplomatically, extending his hand.
“Dragon claw powder, yes. It is from a Peruvian Vippertooth, I heard it was quite useable in certain potions.”
“A number of ingredients which can be used in various potions, most insignificant, others… slightly atrocious.” The professor gave no other indication as to what the thief could be wishing to achieve, instead he discreetly leaned closer to the Gryffindor.
“Right, so we aren’t going to be spending Christmas together at the Burrow, this year. Things with his sister are even worse.”
As Harry continued to write down his notes and thoughts on the various potions and their properties, something landed on his desk. A small origami bird gentle sat on his table; the second Harry touched one of its wings, the little bird unfolded. Scribbled inside was a small note;
Harry had honestly never felt so happy nor so tired before. If he wasn’t sure it was going to ruin the moment he would have started giggling. A tired smile wouldn’t leave his lips and after a few deep breaths, Draco finally looked up from his chest.
The naked trees surrounded them and only tiny rays of sunlight managed to pass through the clouds. The wind couldn’t quite reach its speed in there and both of them actually felt warmer as they walked in pace. Finally, Jason recognized the two giant oak trees on each side of an invisible path he had crossed before. Only a few more meters and it should be right ahead.
“No,” she said absently. “Not since last night.” She continued to curl her waving blonde hair around her wand.
Harry swallowed the huge lump in his throat, carefully averting his eyes by picking up another cruller. Beside him on the couch, Remus took a deep breath.
When the need for air became too great, Severus slowly pulled back. He swallowed deeply as his obsidian eyes meet the icy blue of his date. He could see so many emotions flying through them. Heat, lust in the dilated pupils. Content from the way he was leaning against him and a tiny amount of sleepiness from the long day at work.
It was Sunday and it was the last time the school had a trip to Hogsmeade before leaving for vacation. It had snowed the entire night and the grounds were barely walkable. Many students had been sent to the nurse’s office with headaches and smaller cuts from slipping on the icy stairs outside. Seamus had been one of them. Harry almost felt sorry for the teen, as his boyfriend had had absolutely no sympathy for him.
On the other hand, Draco mused. It would be easy enough. He would only have to pull off the best performance of his life. He didn’t even have to consider the option of losing, because he was after all, a Malfoy. Malfoys didn’t lose.
“Splendid, then let’s join the party.” Zabini smirked convincible and turned around without another word.
Harry wasn’t certain what it was, but Malfoy seemed really out of his comfort zone and Harry knew Slytherins enough by now, to know that when snakes felt threatened, they tended to strike. So keeping calm, he waited for Malfoy to finish his question.
“Draco!” the sound of books falling hit the floor but Draco didn’t give it a further thought. He had had enough of Harry walking out on him. He never thought he would hear himself say it but; he needed the golden boy and it was now!
Harry was so focused on that slightly revealing piece of skin. His eyes felt glued to it and it was incredibly obvious what he was staring at.
Halfway through the lecture, the students were required to read two chapters and take notes. This was also in case they didn’t understand the subject and had questions for the teacher. As Harry wrote down his notes, Remus walked by and discreetly slipped a folded note onto his desk.
Getting up and shaking his legs, Harry turned to get ready for the fight. He picked up a snowball for each hand, making sure he wasn’t too far away from one of the piles. His teammates, including Sandra, Knott, Hermione and Dean got ready to fight. As the few second left ran out, the other team charged forward running towards them. Harry dodges the first flying pairs easily, thanking himself for his practiced reflections. Throwing on the other hand, weren’t exactly his strong side.
“These animals, do you by any chance have a giraffe?” He held out a hand for the rows of stuffed toys.
“Almost time for the train to arrive. I’m the last one to gather my belongings.” Neville closed his trunk and shrunk it into his pocket. Harry felt slightly hurt none of his other friends had woken him up until the last minute.
The pale scars left behind didn’t seem to disappear, but at the moment it wasn’t the important part.
“I think you’re confusing ‘adorable’ with ‘terrifying’.” Draco mumbled, obviously trying to make him laugh. It did work and Harry chuckled.
While Harry had a hard time seeing how Jason’s brown eye resembled to sand, he let it go in favor of answering the gentle girl.
“Look! Dinner is here.” And thankfully, it was. Although it had still barely come through the doors. Floating trays of silver plates with steaming food arrived at the table. A breadbasket, lamb, roasted potatoes and long beans wrapped in bacon, was gently placed around the centerpiece so the students could reach it.
Malfoy seemed surprised and for a minute, Harry and he just stood eye to eye. After the moment, Malfoy just nodded thoughtfully and became quiet. The rest of the line was spent in awkward silence and Harry wondered if perhaps he had offended Malfoy by refusing. He just didn’t want Malfoy to think he needed his money and certainly not because he didn’t have enough on his own.  Malfoy paid for the gloves and they went outside into the cold air once more.
“You know, Harry,” He seemed very focused for once. “You feared both your friends and your parents’ disapproval when you started going out with the blond. It was fortunate you have mainly met support but not everyone is so lucky.”
“I really missed you.” Harry felt himself blush at the statement but it truly felt right to say aloud. The man simply hugged him tighter for another second before releasing him.
Annoyed by the lack of understanding, Pansy took another turn. “Potter. Slytherins. Do not. Change.”
“You guys have done a great job here,” He smiled. “It was definitely one of the easiest moves I have ever tried considering his breed. I’m sure he will be no trouble in south Africa.”
The dinner passed by quickly as everyone chatted delightfully. Harry had drunk his second glass of wine and decided to stay with water for the remaining time, as he started feeling lightheaded.
How the bloody hell was he supposed to last who knew how many weeks, before he would finally get to grab his boyfriend from behind again? Just the thought of Harry’s toned body, naked underneath him, moaning his name in pleasure sent a pool of hot blood, south.
Christmas colors adored the great hall and enchanted snowflakes fell from the ceiling as the students enjoyed their breakfast. Most of them had already changed into their casual robes or in some cases muggle wear. Harry sat nervously and discreetly looked to the sky once in a while. The train would be stationed in a few hours and his present for Draco still hadn’t arrived. He and Draco hadn’t talked about their fight the other day and honestly, it was killing him. Both of them could be so stubborn and short tempered it was truly impressive it had lasted this long before either had lost their temper. The bigger problem was that since they had discussed their ‘relationship’, Harry wasn’t even certain if he should give Draco the present or not. If this was really how he felt about Harry then maybe a gift would only make him feel pushed.
“Na, the fellow is rubbing himself on you, making sure you remember his smell, just in case you loose him.”
“I’m not ready.” Jason admitted. It might have been a huge shock for anyone if they heard that the most spoken of couple in Hogwarts – with now the exception of Malfoy and Harry – hadn’t actually had sex yet. Not just that, but they hadn’t ever gone beyond making out. Jason wasn’t a virgin and hadn’t been for almost two years but having sex wasn’t the problem. No, the problem lied in whom it was with. Blaise was his mate. The one and only he would ever have. If they had sex, it would bond them for life, even if Blaise had no idea what they were doing. It was more binding than getting married and twice as complicated. Blaise had been handed the same excuse every single time, things were heating up and he was looking more and more annoyed.
Wrestling himself free once more, Blaise hurried past the other Slytherins and up the stairs, a rather noticeable blush covering his cheeks. Even half-running Blaise couldn’t escape the loud voice calling after him;
Quickly catching on the two jokesters continued their teasingly manner. Fred faintly touched his heart as George pretended to catch him.
“Potter, you have to return to your dorm.” He was hauled up but he decisively kept his gaze on the ground. “It is after curfew-“ Harry shook his head, refusing the order. The thought of going out, leaving the last place of safety he had… Merlin he couldn’t do that.
Relaxing, Harry felt the tension leave him in the comfortable silence. In it, Malfoy had stopped picking the grass.
Even though he didn’t want to look up between his fringes, he heard the familiar pop from the entrance of an elf.
Both were shaken out of their personal bubble when everyone around them started cheering. Embarrassed they had been seen, Harry’s heart almost flipped over, but then thankfully, Professor Dumbledore took the stage. His classic robes were coated in golden flakes at the bottom, giving it a slightly feminine touch. Although Harry didn’t really think the old man cared. As the applause died down, Dumbledore spoke.
“I see.” Dumbledore gazed straight ahead as his gentle voice continued; “I believe your friends Ms. Granger and Mr. Weasley are not dealing with your newfound friendship with Mr. Malfoy as well as others.”
“Yes, or at least I imagine Jason have told him, since he does not seem surprised or disgusted by a close relation between a student and a professor.” Both men shuddered internally at the aspect of dating a student.
As the two teams on the side realized how Harry ‘sneakily’ had taking Draco out, they also laughed. Draco was clearly not very comfortable being the subject for laughter and for a minute, Harry actually worried Draco was going to be mad. Finally, the blond boy leaned into him and sent his warm breath across his cheek, into his ear.
The five boys comically jumped at the firm voice and Seamus, standing furthest away from the door, went outside. Harry didn’t know how long he sat there waiting. It felt like an eternity. The three other boys sat beside him and tried to distract him with Quidditch. Once again, Harry couldn’t be more grateful for the good friends he had acquired.
The man looked at the stuffed toy before turning his attention back to Harry. “That is very generous of you, young man, but I wouldn’t want you nor your boyfriend to become disappointed. The work can take a long time and by then you might not have time to by another gift.”
Harry waved his apology back at her as he hurried down the corridor. Completely forgetting about Transfiguration, he ran towards the Infirmary. He had a pretty good feeling that was where Malfoy was. Emotions of fear and speculation pumped through his heart. He feared that Malfoy had truly been hurt if he had hit his head on the stone floor in the greenhouse. He wondered why Jason had attacked him. He couldn’t imagine Jason attacking anybody, but unfortunately, based on the given knowledge he recently had inquired he worried it had something to do with Jason’s veela side. And no matter how much he wished it wasn’t true, he knew Malfoy well enough to know he most likely had provoked a reaction from the teen.
Draco didn’t answer him and for a second Harry was worried Draco was going to pull out. Then he legs were pushed further apart and a the kissing moved downwards. Before Harry couldn’t even guess what he was doing, something warm and velvet soft touched his opening. And again and again, it firmly moved over him pushing against Draco’s fingers. Pushing into his deepest area.
Lauris took a big swing of the red bottle and handed it to him. Severus wasn’t really a huge fan of muggle wine, considering the quality of elfmade, but accepted the outreached alcohol. He took a smaller sip, but it was surprisingly pleasant on his tongue.
Watching the black as stare onto the pale face, slowly it began to blink. And again and again, before Blaise noticed the change. Tiny tears slowly arose and rolled down the red feathers, before landing on his love’s face. The tears quickly seeped into the cracks and the sight was almost disgusting.
Potter hands snuck around him, pulling him to lie down on top of him. Their kisses turned from gentle lips to a tongue dance. Draco tried to capture and focus on any little gasp of breath from Potter but he wanted more. He needed to hear the Gryffindor
Laughing the boy lifted his hands in surrender. “Easy. First, it wasn’t wandless. I still can’t do that beside the most basic spellwork. Second, it wasn’t a spell but actually Veela energy. You see the stronger we become the more we can control our aura and when I really try hard enough I can concentrate enough to make electricity.” He explained.
He didn’t know why that one sentence hurt so much to say but Harry truly started sobbing now and slowly Remus embraced him. A whole mix of different feelings went through Harry; mind and soul. The pain from so far away had come rushing back, the anger towards Remus and at the same time hope that he would never let go. He clutched himself to the warm man and whispered against his neck; “I forgive you. Don’t ever leave me again.” The silent answer he got was arms clutching him tighter.
Smiling, Jason simply gave Harry a pat on the back and so they decided to talk about something else.
Harry nodded quietly. “There is no mistake. She couldn’t possibly be lying... She drank...” He sent a knowing glance towards the professor and Snape’s face turned even sourer as he nodded in understanding.
“Yes, well not too bad for the certain situation. Mr. Malfoy got a concussion, quite a bleeding from the head, a split eyebrow and a few minor bruises to the chest area.” The Woman waved her wand over Malfoy an extra time and she nodded in conclusion. “All in all, he should be out by tomorrow.”
“Harry, I…” Remus seemed suddenly saddened. Making a deep sigh the wolf continued; “You should head back for the castle before it gets late.”
“My office.” Madam Pomphrey scoffed. “But Professor Snape, he already explained the situation and considering the boy’s condition-“
The entire pond was completely frozen over, not a single bead of water or thawing sides in sight. The sun shone lightly, reflecting the ice and snow as tiny diamonds. Few spectrums of color could be noticed as they moved around it.
Now he was directly above him. Sitting in the tree just beside where Blaise was hiding, Jason gracefully and soundlessly let go of the branch. He landed on his feet and waited in patience to see if Blaise could feel him. As the boy straight in front of him had yet to realize his presence, Jason jumped.
He gently pushed the blond away with a hand on his chest, but not further than they were still holding each other tightly around the waist.  “Thank you, Draco.”  Smirking, the teen answered cockily; “You’re welcome. I know I’m a good kisser.”
‘Come on, Potter!’ “Yeah, we talked about it, but he said his aunt is probably expecting him if nothing else comes up. He just didn’t seem very excited, at all. They aren’t very close.”
Finally, they had finished and Seamus promised to get him something nice from Hogsmeade next time as a thanks. He shrunk the presents and left the room with his trunk behind him. Drying away the invisible sweat from his forehead, Harry sank down on his bed almost landing on the giraffe. The paper crunched beneath him and he picked it up. The present was actually rather heavy for a stuffed animal and he wondered what the old man had used as stuffing. Sitting up, Harry slowly moved the paper out of the way and a tiny giraffe was revealed.
“So Potter, I suppose the disposition of you ‘doing better’ isn’t as well-evolved as planned?” Snape leaned back and crossed his arms.
A familiar hand on his shoulder stopped him as he left for the staircase. His heart knocked so hard against his chest, it would surely break his chest bone. But it was too late to escape. Malfoy was standing behind him. They were alone.
Reaching for the heavy book, harry thanked him and quickly turned to the appointed chapter. After only reading a few paragraphs, Harry needed something to write notes with.
The Black haired boy was practically wrestling; trying to escape the encircled arms around him. The encircling tan arms were connected to a tall boy. A Slytherin; Draco could conclude on the green seamed robes. The unidentified boy held on to the struggling friend of his, so he must have been very strong. He barely looked like it affected him how Blaise pulled at his arms in vain. As Draco couldn’t place him, the tan boy was most likely a transfer student and probably in their year, since he seemed to have a rather close relationship to Blaise.
The classroom in the crypt was unusually hot today. As the gang entered, Harry noticed a few cauldrons were brewing on a side table. Harry begged the gods for it not to be a pop quiz. Of course, being the lucky person to get in last, Harry noticed how the tables had been divided into groups of four. Which meant that Ron, Hermione, Seamus and Dean had occupied an entire table and there were no more room left. He was shifting around for a moment, wondering where to sit, when his professor decided to take that decision for him.
“Seriously?! That’s amazing!” Harry felt instantly excited for his friend yet a tiny bit jealous. Season opening was – beside the finals – the best game of the year. It wasn’t so much because of game itself but because the crowd was incredibly energetic. The spirit through the stadium was apparently always wild. At least that is what Ron had told him. They had only ever been to that one final game back in fourth year but if the opening was even remotely close to that, then Harry could see why everyone would want to be there.
“Okay, just give me a minute.” Jason turned in the couch to sit in front of him and then he pulled his hands close to each other. They almost touched palms but not quite. For a long time nothing happened. Jason was simply holding his hands together and had closed his eyes in concentration. Then as he watched him, the tiny space between his hands flicked a tiny light. It went by so fast, Harry was certain he had imagined it but then another, more powerful came. A tiny spark of purple lighting was created between his palms and they soundlessly kept coming and going. It was as if he had a small storm between his fingers.
The Slytherin smirked around him as he teased and gently bit his nipple. A finger joined the fun and pinched the other. While Harry had played with himself before, it was almost unbelievable how good it felt to have them sucked. The tongue and finger synchronized quickly. Both teasing, centering before a sudden rap of pain erupted. Every time Harry cried out Draco would let go and begin caressing him again.
Smiling, Blaise leaned out a hand, wanting help to get up. Ridiculously happy, the boys straightened their clothes and slowly left the woods hand in hand.
“You should probably get some warm clean clothes on before you get a cold.” The older boy suggested.
“No, not really.” She fumbled with her scarf. “They are meant for the outside world. But perhaps sometimes, a slightly changed scenario can do them good. At least some of them.”
Raising his head too quickly, Harry flinched as his neck clenched uncomfortably. Looking into the steal grey eyes, he blinked dimwittedly.
Harry tried to move a little closer without seeming to obvious. The second their knees bumped, Malfoy moved in. Capturing his lips, Harry practically melted underneath him. Their lips molded against each other, not pushing or fighting simply pressing skin together. The kiss was different from the ones they had shared before. While they had been heated and crazy lustful as two teenagers usually were, this one was almost like talking without sound. He noticed the smaller things and focused on the way Malfoy moved. Tilting his head to the right, Harry let out a gentle moan as Malfoy’s tongue entered him. The warm muscle felt amazing against his own, as was the sweet taste of butterbeer.
“No, really.” Seamus continued. “I swear, we ran into Malfoy and his gorillas, and they started it! However, just when I was about to hex Crabbe, Snape of course show up, asking what was going on-“
“Wait a second.” Grabbing the brown paper bag next to him, Malfoy quickly unfolded his new gloves. “Stretch your hand.” He said while holding the left glove up.
After only a few more times touching his prostate, Harry lost all self-control. With his other hand he grabbed his erection hard. He pulled harshly over the skin, pulling it back over his head and tortured himself by twisting it lightly. As both hands reached an incredibly speed, Harry found himself coming to the thought of Draco sucking his cock.
The cold breeze had hit him the second he stepped outside. The snow covered ground crunched under his boots as he slowly walked through the yard. Other students had gathered around the benches and the one snow covered tree. Beside the tree stood a bunch of Slytherins and if Harry stretched a bit, he was able to see Jason standing there, chatting with his friends. Probably sensing being watched, Jason looked around and saw him. Smiling, he said something to his friends before strolling casually towards him.
“So listen, we haven’t really had a chance to talk about what happened with you and Draco.” Harry tried not to sound demanding. A darkened look crossed the veela’s face. He bent over and gently moved the snow aside looking for the ground.
His father’s anger had settled, but he continued pacing back and forth, as the wheels in his head turned. His mother’s hand had never stopped stroking his, but he could feel the sudden tension in her as their discussion had included her. His father was at the point where he felt he had listened to more than enough reasons. Now, he was making a final decision. Even though his mother had seemed on his side, his father was the head of their house and would ultimately make the call. Stopping to stare out the window, his father finally spoke again.
Continuing Harry looked him straight in the eyes. “I really didn’t think I could be so happy with anyone.” The silver eyes flicked quickly before the warmth returned. “Me neither.”
“What in Heavens name could possibly have motivated you to do such reckless, insane antics? To bring your lives and the entire school in such danger!”
“What tore you and Jason apart, is also something that can bind you together. Use that painful, yet happy memory to bond with your son.”
They kept incredibly close as Lauris’s hands were on his lower back, while Severus’ own were entangled in his curly hair.
Chuckling, Harry opened the ribbon and took of the lid. Inside lay a tiny necklace in silver. The pendant showed him a simple Gryffindor crest-lion resting on a silver background plat. It was so tiny Harry almost hadnt been able to recognize the crest without the red background.
About thirty pages into the book, he had summoned a glass of red wine. Who would care it was only nine in the morning? A good book always needed creative juices. Both for reading and writing. Turning another page, a knock on his door interrupted him. He hid the book under the felt pillow and straightened his robes before going to open it. At the last second, he turned and waved a hand, sending the glass of wine into the small kitchen.
“And that is only understandable.” Dumbledore agreed and stopped. Harry stopped as well as he realized the Professor weren’t even looking at him, but instead a smaller portrait of a young couple sitting on a bench together. They didn’t even notice the two men watching their movements, caught up in each other. Once in a while, the boy would lean in trying to kiss the young girl, but she would giggle and avoid him.
The professor took five points from Gryffindor for stalling. Harry was usually punished much worse when it was Snape and didn’t bother to complain. Neither boy said anything, on the whole way there. Professor Snape was right behind them and things couldn’t have been more awkward.  Harry didn’t even feel comfortable breathing thoroughly before they arrived at class. Splitting up, Malfoy went to the front of the class where his fellow Slytherins had gathered. Harry sat down in the back beside Neville.
He suddenly wondered how many people Malfoy had dated. There were of course rumors about the two mighty Slytherin boys sleeping with everything that walked on two legs but there surely wasn’t any truth to it…
Getting up from his bed, he started pacing. This couldn’t be true! Everything was carefully planned and it was going according to plan! Seduce Potter, check.  Date Potter, check. Sleep with Potter and get his freedom. There was no part in this plan were he started giving a flying shit about how Potter would feel about this whole ordeal.
“Jason, please…” moving over him- careful not to crush any part of his body- he kissed the cold pale forehead. As he pulled back slowly, he desperately prayed to whatever god was there, that the two-coloured eyes would stare back at him, even if it were in anger.
Moving further he left his nipples and imagined Draco looking at him, lying there underneath him. His hands teasingly followed his toned abs, which mostly tickled, and he found himself starting to breathe even harder. He was almost at his wits end, but he wanted to explore himself a little more first. Grabbing the natural soap, he covered his fingers and started following his crack. He rubbed a single digit between his cheeks and constantly went over his hole without actually breaching it. Every time he touched it, it would tense up in anticipation. Not able to wait anymore he moaned as he teased the opening and quickly took an entire finger up until his knuckle. The position was slightly hard to reach around but it also felt really good, still thinking it was Draco’s fingers and not his own.
“Pew!” She spurted, drying away invisible sweat from her forehead. “For a second I was actually worried this would go much faster than expected.”
“Charlie smuggled him out. As soon as he is big enough, we will find a home for him or her, of course.” Hagrid sighed. “It will only be temporary… But isn’t he gorgeous already?”
“The elves have delivered ALL the presents here. Two of them were for Professor Snape and Jason Melck. Do you know him?”
“Do not worry about Mr. Lupin. He is, for now, on a special task for our cause. He will be back before you know it.” Harry wondered why Remus would be on a mission. After all, Voldemort was gone. But not to disagree with the older man, he nodded along.
Remus wasn’t looking at him any longer, but was staring off into space. His eyes seemed haunted as Harry kept listening.
“Oh.” Blaise wasn’t sure how to address their painful break up. It still lingered somewhere deeply buried. “For what it’s worth; I really am sorry how things turned out. I never meant to lie to you. Especially not to hurt you.”
The idea that he might wish to break up, punched a giant dark hole in his stomach. What if Draco had actually tried to break up with him, the other day? And Harry had been so caught up in them being more than friends that he hadn’t seen where the conversation was leading? God, now he felt even more awful than before.
I’ve been doing.” Draco said with a wide grin but agreed with me that he was not really feeling like having that conversation right now.
happen then?” I asked and referred to Harry’s black eye. I noticed Harry’s eyes were nervously flickering, avoiding eye contact with me. “Well, Hermione and Ron were fighting when I get back to the common room after dinner and I asked what they were fighting about. Ron got angry and asked if I only wanted to know so I could run back to you to gossip or something-“ Harry trailed off. “Yeah, go on.” I said impatiently. Harry cleared his throat before he continued. “Then Hermione got angry and told Ron off before throwing her book at him in anger. Ron then lunched himself at her preparing to slap her. So I stepped in between them and Ron’s hand hit me instead of Hermione. I couldn’t let him hit her Draco, that wouldn’t have been right-” I raised an eyebrow at him, and he immediately continued, almost panicking. “Please don’t hurt him! He didn’t mean to hit me and he certainly didn’t intend to give me a black eye-“ I tightened my grip on Harry’s chin slightly, which made him yelp. “No one hurts you and gets away with it. Do you understand that Potter?
rape you, okay?! You wanted this just as badly as I did if not more! Stop accusing me of something I didn’t do!” I snarled at him, which instantly made Harry shut his mouth. He shamefully hung his head and mumbled an apology.
Harry’s first heat and my first rut both lasted five days. We were both exhausted when it finally ended, none of us barely moved. We were both laying naked on the bed, entangled in each other. Harry was the first to move and he practically flew out of the bed, grabbing the sheet to cover himself up. “What the hell did you do to me?!” He blurted out before looking down at himself, seeing that he was naked, and his clothes had been torn apart. “Did you
“To be honest, I thought this whole thing was all part of a cunning scheme to weaken Potter and then humiliate him by dumping him in front of a bunch of people. Just saying.” Pansy confessed while we were chatting in the common room late one afternoon. Pansy was leaning against my shoulder and I’m sure it must have looked like we were a coupe to some people. I didn’t mind that Pansy was leaning against me, I still just saw her as a friend.
We got dressed but had some difficulties finding our clothing and figuring out which shirts belonged to who. I thought we had gotten it right at the end, but oh Merlin had I been wrong. To my big surprise Ron and Hermione were waiting up for me when I got back to the Gryffindor common room. “Where the bloody hell have you been?!” Ron blurted out as soon as I entered the room and I couldn’t help but feeling guilty. I had after all promised them both that I would see them after dinner when they had left the platform several hours earlier. “I uhm- It’s complicated-“ I started off and awkwardly rubbed my neck with my hand, but before I could even continue to explain myself Hermione cut me off. “Harry, why on earth are you wearing a
We stayed like this for a while until I gently pulled away and sat up straight. “Draco- I know you’re not ready to make us an official thing yet, but I need to know what we are-” I started off and carefully watched Draco’s reaction. “I mean, we’ve been messing around for an entire school year by now, don’t you think it’s time to at least admit to ourselves what we have become?” I could see Draco’s jaw tense up and he was really considering his answer. There was an awkward silence for a few minutes. “Please say something Draco?” I carefully watched Draco and part of me already knew the answer coming from Draco. “Why is it so important to you? Why can’t we just be the two of us until I feel comfortable enough to tell people about us?” he asked and looked at me. His eyes looked sad and I couldn’t help but think that I was at fault. The words hurt more than Draco had intended them to and he immediately realized that he had hurt me. “I’m sorry.” He muttered and stretched his hand out. He waited for me to take it, but I pushed it away and got up instead. “Don’t be. It’s fine- I just thought that we could maybe take the next step, that’s all.” I said and turned my back on Draco in hopes that he wouldn’t notice the tears that had started to form in the corners of my eyes. I could hear Draco getting on his feet behind me, but I didn’t turn around. I didn’t want him to see that I was crying. “What’s wrong?” I heard Draco’s soft voice behind me, and it was almost unbearable. But instead of making me sad it made me angry instead and I turned around to face Draco, frantically wiping the tears away from my eyes. “What’s wrong? What’s
I hurried down the hallways to get away from the hospital wing as fast as I could. The tears were now rapidly streaming down my cheeks and there was nothing I could do to stop them. Luckily, the hallways were empty, so no one saw my tears. My feelings were a mess and all I knew was that I couldn’t stand to look at Harry right now, it hurt too much.
We ended up getting a bit closer during the time I spent apart from Harry. Sure, we had been friends since our first year, but this was different.
angry with me?” I asked silently and watched as Hermione’s smile turned into a grimace before she nodded. “He’s being stubborn and childish if you ask me.” Hermione said, her voice had a slight tone of irritation to it.
moaning mess. I groaned silently as my pants started to get uncomfortably tight. I let go of Harry’s cock to get rid of my pants. Harry whined softly at the loss of my hand stroking him. I made up for the missing hand by moving my fingers faster and slightly deeper. Harry moaned loudly and the sound send a wave of satisfaction down my spine. I pulled my pants and boxers just far enough down to hint what was coming next. “I’m going to remove my fingers now Potter.” I said and teasingly pulled my fingers out. Harry whimpered and instinctively arched his hips towards me. “I want to hear you beg for it, Potter. You have to earn it.” I teased and nudged my cock against Harry’s hole to tease him even more. When Harry arched his hips further back towards me, I slightly pulled away. “I told you that you have to earn it Potter.” Harry whimpered and it was getting harder for me to restrain myself. All I wanted to do was ram into him right here and now. “P-please Draco- I want- I want you inside me- Please-“ Harry begged. “That’s right Potter. Beg for me. Beg for me to fuck you.” I groaned and had to remind myself that I still wanted to hear Harry say that he wanted me to fuck him. “P-please Draco- Fuck me- Please, I beg you- I can’t take this anymore-“ Harry begged again and a silent growl tore its way out of my throat. I grabbed Harry’s hips and rammed inside of him. Harry moaned loudly and clenched his fists around the blankets underneath him. Harry rolled his hips rhythmically against me as I was thrusting into him. I tightened my grip on his hips slightly and groaned as the waves of pleasure rushed over me. Each thrust sent shivers of pleasure through both our bodies and I felt my climax closing in. “Fuck- I’m going to come Potter-“ I groaned and thrusted a bit faster towards the end. I leaned over and grabbed Harry’s cock once again which made him jerk forwards a bit. “M-me too Draco- Ah! I’m coming-“ Harry cried out just before his climax. “Fuck- Ah! P-Potter-“ I moaned as I came. I pulled out and collapsed on my side on the blankets. Harry let himself fall next to me and I wrapped an arm around him to pull him closer to me. “Mine-“ I mumbled under my breath. We were both panting heavily, but I didn’t mind. I had finally admitted to myself who I was and who I wanted to be with. And that person was none other than Harry bloody fucking Potter. I smiled softly to myself and just enjoyed the feeling of having him this close to me.
intervene. He has already apologized a hundred times. And besides, Ron wouldn’t have hit me in the first place if I hadn’t stepped in between him and Hermione when he tried to slap her.” I turned back around to face Harry and he looked furious. I blinked a couple of times to make sure I was seeing this right. Harry’s eyes were darkening, and the air was thickening. “I won’t let you hurt him Draco. Do you hear me?” ‘So, this what Harry looks like when he is angry?’ I thought to myself and watched Harry carefully from where I had stopped in my tracks when he raised his voice. I passively crossed my arms over my chest and looked back at Harry while he was giving me a piece of his mind. I was impressed with Harry for crossing me like that and I couldn’t help but smile. “What the hell are you smiling at?!” Harry yelled and looked confused at me. “Oh nothing. You just look hot when you’re angry, that’s all.” I said and shrugged. I watched as Harry’s cheeks turned redder and redder, but that didn’t stop him from continuing to yell at me, but now he was yelling at me for not taking this seriously.
After a few minutes of complete silence Draco finally looked up from the ground, his eyes were still glistening slightly from his tears. “I’m guessing you’re here to yell at me some more for not talking to you for an entire week?” He questioned quietly as he wrapped his arms protectively around himself, almost like he was trying to ward off my words, even though I wasn’t going to yell at him. I shook my head and pushed myself away from the wall to stand up straight in front of him. Even though I was standing straight, Draco was still almost a head taller than me. “That’s not why I’m here. Even though I have to admit that it pissed me off.” I replied and looked slightly up to make eye contact with Draco.
But I am back with Chapter IV and hope to release Chapter V within the next week or so, give and take a few days maybe
What did this make us? Was there even anything in it, or was it just me imagining things? I had so many questions that I needed answers to.
Crabbe and Goyle took this way better than Ron had taken it last night, so either they were okay with it or they were exceptionally good at hiding their disapproval. Draco smiled reassuringly at me after they had left the dorm room again to let us get dressed. “Don’t worry Potter. I won’t let them treat you like your so called ‘friend’ Ron did. And if they do decide to call you nasty things, I will make them pay.” I nodded slowly and pulled my robe over my shoulders. “That’s not what I’m worried about. How am I supposed to get out of here without getting caught by literally every single Slytherin student?” I asked and looked worriedly over at Draco. I could almost hear the gears turning inside of Draco’s head as he thought about his answer. “That is a good question-“ He mumbled and tapped his chin with three fingers as he continued to think for a few more minutes. “You don’t have that fancy cloak of yours on you by any chance, do you?” Draco asked after a few minutes. I shook my head and Draco frowned. “Well, this complicates things a lot.” I rolled my eyes at him but sent him a small smile. “Oh really? You don’t say.” I said sarcastically and Draco snorted. “I guess you will just have to stay the night then.” He said and smirked at me. My eyes widened in surprise. “Have you lost your mind?! I can’t do that! What will the other students even think? - ” I was interrupted by Draco pulling me close to him and kissing me passionately. It felt like my knees turned to jelly under me and I had to grab onto Draco’s shoulders to stay on my feet.
I would be lying if I said that I wasn’t excited about getting to see Draco again. I quickly crumbled up the note before anyone else could read it. I noticed Hermione looking at me with the same suspicious look on her face as the first time I got a note. I think she was beginning to understand what was going on, but I wasn’t sure, and I didn’t want to test my luck just yet. I spend the rest of the day with Ron and Hermione in the common room talking and relaxing. It was nice to have some time off from the Triwizard Cup for a change, I knew it wouldn’t last forever though. Sooner or later I would have to prepare for the next trial. As evening slowly approached and the sun began to set it got harder and harder to contain my excitement. If I didn’t know any better, I would say that I must’ve looked like a little schoolgirl about to go on a first date with her crush, which was kind of how I felt. I could barely get anything down at dinner, but I knew I had to eat if I didn’t want Hermione to suspect more than she probably already did. I managed to finish my dinner and left the table along with Ron and Hermione before we headed back to the common room to relax for the rest of the evening. We spent hours just talking just like we usually did, but I knew I would have to tell them both what was going on eventually. The thought kind of scared me, what if they didn’t want to be my friends anymore after telling them? ‘Now you’re just being paranoid, Harry. Of course, they would still want to be your friends after you tell them everything.’ I thought to myself and pushed my worries aside for the time being. I instead focused on confronting Draco about how I felt and what this whole thing made us. But how was I supposed to do it, should I just be straight up honest, or should I try to ask Draco how he’s feeling about all of this? On second thought, Draco didn’t strike me as the type of person to openly talk about his feelings. I guess I must’ve spaced out at some point because suddenly Hermione was waving her hand in front of my face. “Uhm, hello? Earth calling Harry, is anyone home?” She asked with a small laugh looked over at Ron who was laughing as well. “Ron and I are heading to bed now and we were just wondering if you were planning on going to bed or if you’re just going to sit here spacing out by yourself?” I shrugged and looked at the time before answering, the hands showed 11:15 pm. “I think I’ll just stay up a little longer. I just need to clear my head for a while.” I replied and sent them both a soft smile. I felt bad for lying to my friends, but I wasn’t ready to tell them just yet. I said goodnight to Ron and Hermione and went back to spacing for a little while until it was time for me to head out to meet up with Draco.
As soon as the train pulled up and came to a stop at King’s Cross I hurried out of the train and went to pick up my luggage. I heard Pansy, Crabbe and Goyle calling out to me to wait for them, but I didn’t care. I just wanted to go home so I wouldn’t have to worry about bumping into Harry at the platform. Unfortunately, that was exactly what happened when I hurried out of the station to find my parents so we could return to the manor. I’m not sure who was at fault, but I guess neither of us were looking at where we were going in our hurry t get out of there. Our trolleys were knocked over and our luggage fell to the ground with a loud crash. “Hey! Watch where the hell you’re going-“ I blurted out before I could think of anything else to say. “Sorry-“ Harry mumbled back and quickly picked his luggage up and hurried in the direction he had been heading before we collided. I just about noticed the tears in Harry’s eyes as he walked past me. I spun around and stared after him, I wanted to grab his arm and pull him back and hug him, but he was gone before I could do anything. Flashbacks from our fight appeared in my head and just like that I was alone again. I took a deep breath and started walking out to the parking lot to find my parents.
After wandering for some time, I found myself in the boys’ bathroom on the sixth floor. I closed the door behind me and let myself sink to the floor while leaning against the door. Now that I was sure I was alone I finally let myself feel everything. My shoulders were bouncing up and down as I sobbed. The guilt washed over like a tide wave, weighing me down like a ton of bricks. I pulled my knees up under my chin and wrapped my arms tightly around them before hiding my face in my knees. I could hear chatter and laughter from the hallways, meaning classes must have ended. I prayed that no one would try to enter the bathroom and waited anxiously for people to pass by. In the middle of all this I heard a sound next to me and quickly turned my head, only to find myself staring directly at Moaning Myrtle. “I’ve never seen you cry before. What’s the matter?” She asked as she looked at me. She was studying my face as if she had never seen tears before. “Why does it matter to you?” I asked and turned my head away from her, staring blankly into nothing. “It matters to me because I know the look on your face. You’re not the first heartbroken student I have seen in my time here as a ghost.” She simply replied and let herself float down next to me, copying the way I was sitting. “So, tell me, what’s the matter. Who do I need to haunt to cheer you up?” Myrtle asked, trying her best to lift the mood. “No one. This is my own fault. I fucked up, Myrtle. I hurt the person that means the world to me, and now-“ I could barely even get myself to say it out of fear of it being true. “Now they hate me- How Am I supposed to make this right again?” I mumbled as a wave of hopelessness washed over me.  My chest was aching, but at the same time it felt terribly empty. I felt something cold on my shoulder and turned my head slightly. Myrtle had placed her hand on my shoulder, and she was smiling softly at me. “You will find a way to make it right. I know you will. You’re Draco Malfoy, and there is one thing I know for certain about you; you don’t give up without a fight.” She said and sent me an encouraging smile before floating away.
Draco slowly rolled off me and laid down next to me on the bed instead. He snaked an arm around med to pull me close to him before lazily waving his hand to pull the cover over us to shield us from the cool air.
After Dumbledore had left the cell, I turned to look at Harry. He was still sitting as far away from me on the bed as he possibly could. I sighed quietly and moved closer to Harry while holding up some of the cover before wrapping it around Harry’s shoulders to prevent him from getting colder than he had already gotten. Harry was shivering but I couldn’t tell if it was from being cold or if he was just either really scared of me or really angry at me. I tried reaching my hand out again and this time Harry didn’t move away from me, mostly because he couldn’t move anywhere without passing me in the process. I gently placed my hand on Harry’s shoulder and watched him as he flinched. My heart sank in my chest once again. “I know I fucked up- You have no idea how bad I feel, Harry. I wish I could take it all back, I really do. I promised myself that I would never hurt you, but that was exactly what happened- I mean, you won’t even look at me-“ I trailed off and tried to fight the tears forming in my eyes. It hurt that Harry was suddenly acting this coldly towards me. “Please say something Harry?” There was a painful long silence before Harry finally spoke. “How do you expect me to be okay with all of this? First you bite me to the point where my shoulder starts bleeding, then you tried to force yourself on me in the courtyard because your stupid Alpha brain thought thinks it’s a good idea, then you rape me continuously for five days straight. And as if all that wasn’t enough Dumbledore shows up and tells me I only have one job in this world, which is to please you whenever you ask for it. And oh yeah; I have to bear your children!” He yelled as he looked over at me, his eyes were glowing with anger. “What do you want me to say? That I’ll be you little pet, that you can play house with, for the rest of my life? Or that I’m thrilled to be your fuck toy?” Harry asked furiously. The look on his face scared me a bit. He looked like he was ready to literally murder someone. For a moment I completely forgot everything about the accusations about rape, but as I snapped out of it, I realized Harry had accused me of rape, again. “Will you stop with the rape accusations? I’m telling you; I did
We decided to go for a walk around the school grounds. The sun was shining, and the shy was clear. Birds were happily chirping all around us and there were a few pleasantly warm breezes here and there. It was nice to walk hand in hand with Draco for a change, and it seemed like Draco was enjoying it too. He was smiling widely, and it was nice to see him happy. While we were out walking, we ran into Hagrid, he was out feeding some wild Nifflers who were living somewhere on the school grounds. He smiled and waved at us. Draco tried to pull his hand back, but I didn’t let him. I intertwined our fingers and softly squeezed his hand. “It’s just Hagrid. Come on let’s go say hello.” I said and dragged Draco over to Hagrid. “’Ello Harry ‘n’ Draco.” Hagrid greeted us still smiling. He looked down at our hands and slightly raised an eyebrow. “Mind tellin’ me what’s going on ‘ere?” He asked and looked back and forth between us. I looked up at Draco who seemed a bit uncomfortable with this whole situation. For the first time since we started messing around Draco was the uncomfortable one. ‘Ha, that’s payback for all the times I have been the one feeling uncomfortable.’ I thought to myself. Draco took a deep breath and answered Hagrid before I even got the chance to say something. “Not at all Hagrid. Harry and I are dating now.” Draco said casually and sent Hagrid a quick smile. Hagrid looked confused back and forth between us. “Hold up- Yer’ dating?” Draco shrugged and gave my hand a soft squeeze. I nodded and smiled up at Hagrid. “Yup, we are a thing now. But I would really appreciate it if you could keep it just between the three of us for now. We’re not ready for the entire school to know just yet.” Draco sorted next to me and I turned my head to look at him. “What was that supposed to mean?” I asked a bit confused. Draco sent me a small smirk. “Sometimes I forget how ignorant you can be Potter. There is a pretty big chance that the entire staff already know. Slytherins are not exactly known to be good at keeping secrets. I’m almost a hundred percent sure that someone has already told Snape and he’s not known to keep secrets either.” He simply replied and I could feel all the color draining from my face. “Could things just go my way for once? Is that really too much to ask for?” I asked silently and sighed deeply.
The kiss was long and passionate, but after some time I gently broke it off, we were both panting and trying to catch our breaths. “Do you trust me?” I asked Harry and placed my other hand firmly on his back. He nodded. “I do.” He said. In one swift movement I swept Harry off his feet and gently laid him down on the blankets. Harry blinked surprised up at me and then laughed. “That was- Amazing-“ Harry’s amazement made me smile. I straddled Harry’s waist and bend down to start kissing him again, with more passion this time. Harry’s hands found their way up to my shirt and slid underneath it. I shivered slightly as his hands touched my skin. I gently cupped Harry’s face with my hands and pulled him slowly up towards me, sitting us up straight instead of laying down. Harry’s hands started fumbling with the buttons on my shirt and one by one he opened them, sliding the shirt of off my shoulders carefully so the kiss wouldn’t be broken off. I could feel myself starting to harden and let out a soft moan as I started unbuttoning Harry’s shirt. Once I had unbuttoned Harry’s shirt and slid it of off his shoulders, I broke off the kiss. Harry whimpered silently when I moved. “I’m ready to take the next step, I want to fuck you, Potter.” I said with a smirk. Harry bit his lip and his body shivered with anticipation again. I could tell that Harry was getting hard as well, the way he kept shifting underneath me made it crystal clear. “well, what do you say Potter?” I teased and placed a hand on his crotch, pressing lightly down. Harry bit his lip harder and fought back a moan, but I didn’t back down that easily. I just pressed down a bit harder than before and smirked at how Harry reacted. “Oh Merlin! Yes- Please- I can’t take it anymore-“ Harry tried to hold another moan back but didn’t succeed this time. It felt like someone had just sent electric impulses down my spine and I had to bite hard down on my lip to stop a moan from escaping my lips.
“I- I wasn’t sure if you wanted me to come down here. If not, I’m sorry. But I was worried about you, and I was kind of worried when your parents showed up. I’m really sorry if your parents weren’t meant to find out. Just tell me now, if-“ The Gryffindor once again looked to the floor, his eyes shining lightly. “Are you going to break up?”
“So, what I wanted to say was…” god, how could this become more awkward? “I really care about you, a lot, so I think… I love you.”
Harry took another sip of his tea before asking if the other person to the ‘we’ had been Sirius. Nodding Remus continued.
Pansy led him astray into one of the smaller hallways. Checking around to see if anyone had noticed them, she opened the door to an abandoned classroom, where she quickly pushed him in. Gathering himself, Harry didn’t ask. If she wished to tell him something, she could simply say so. There was certainly no need for the secrecy.
Settling for a comforting hand on his shoulder, Blaise gently stroked his arm. It was enough said between them. False words of hope had never been their method. Draco had fucked up and he knew it. Nothing Blaise could say could change that.
Hello! hope you are having a nice day/night so far. Last time Draco was getting annoyed, as Severus was trying to figure out his plans. Harry wants a boyfriend now, but whom should he choose?
He got closer and closer, once per tree, stopping to see if Blaise had noticed him. but no, the teen was still very much out of breath and was carefully looking around the tree to see if Jason was catching up to him.
The older man wrinkled his eyebrows, searching through the masses. “I’m sorry, but I don’t have any giraffes.”
Harry had been so lost in thoughts, that when he finally looked up from his lap, Professor Snape was all blurry. For a second Harry believed something was wrong with his glasses, before realizing something wet landed on the backside of his hands. Looking down where his hands laid in his lap, he saw a drop of water.
“I lived with my father there. You couldn’t ask for a kinder or gentler soul.” Jason smiled sadly. “It had always just been the two of us together. My grandparents died before I was born, you see. And then this summer I- … I lost him.” He choked.
He decided that later today he would be sending a letter. He wasn’t even sure where Remus was at this point, but he was certain Hedwig would find him. It hopefully wouldn’t take too long before Hedwig reached the old DADA professor. Picking up the crust of his toast, he said bye to the rest of the Gryffindors and headed for Transfiguration.
“Draco will most certainly marry me. We have been promised to each other since birth and that isn’t about to change.”
“- so either the second battle of Morigan or the first goblin war between Fresdaa and the Bullei- clans…”
Harry didn’t want to think about Sirius right now, so he changed the subject to something completely different.
The small break was enough time to escape the quick beast and Harry quickly sought for the end of the forest towards Hogwarts. Thousands of small thumps against the dirty grounds were continuing quickly behind him and he feared looking around to see how quickly it was catching up to him. Suddenly, the sound stopped. Daring to check he really did scream this time as the beast had decided to jump him. The only thing he saw was teeth and cold black eyes as he was pushed to the ground. Feeling his suddenly empty hands, Harry stopped breathing in fear. He had dropped his wand!
“Maybe.” Jason didn’t really look like he believed him. He turned over and rolled away from Harry. He was hurting from watching the cheerful boy acting like a kicked puppy. But he wasn’t sure what to say. Either way he didn’t know Laurent and he certainly didn’t know Snape well enough to figure out what was going through his mind back then. Besides, nothing he could say would change the outcome of the story. Jason still ended up with only one parent in his life, even if that parent role changed only a few months ago. He hoped things would seem better in the morning and hopefully, Jason would feel closer to Snape now that he knew the truth.
“So… Potter, now that the dark lord has fallen, do you intend to… continue the dark wizard chase?” okay, it wasn’t the smoothest icebreaker but it was something.
“Right.” Draco barely acknowledged the fact. He won. He should feel as superior as he was during any win, but knowing that his housemates thought Harry was a trophy. It didn’t feel…. Right. But he would fix this dispute kind of guilt when he told Pansy the truth, everything would work out.
It was Tuesday morning and Harry couldn’t help but feel that this was going to be a good day. First of all; They only had two classes that day, because for some reason DADA had been cancelled. First class was still Potions but the second was Care of magical creatures. Harry still couldn’t believe Hagrid had a dragon egg nesting in his home. Hopefully, the dragon would hatch soon and then it would only be a few weeks before he was going back to Rumania or another dragon reservation. Second of all, the sun was finally shining, rather brightly for this seasons weather. Today was actually blue sky, even though a few gray clouds had taken place, Harry refused to complain. Today was going to be a good day.
“The boy with the mixed eyes. They are really wonderful to look into. Almost like watching an ocean and the golden sand on the beach at the same time.”
Before reaching the end of the four tables, where the Australian boy and the Gryffindors would part, Jason affirmed their meeting tomorrow at the library.
“I don’t suppose you would consider helping our friend here. I don’t think it is quite his time yet.” Dumbledore told the bird.
It was weird though, Harry had never been so easily to anger. That had always been Ron’s issue. So why had he flipped out? Harry didn’t know, but he could still feel the anger seething inside him. It was as if his chest was burning hot and he felt so… something. It wasn’t just anger. It was… it was… something else.
Pushing them firmly together, Draco opened his mouth and invited Harry to play. Shyly, Harry moved in and met him. After a few seconds of tasting each other, Draco moved in and their tongues fought for space. When the need for air became too great, the Slytherin pulled away, but just slightly.
Fall had seemed to go by quickly and before Harry had realized it, Halloween had passed. While outside the weather had gone from cold to almost freezing, Harry had felt incredibly warm inside the castle. He, Jason, Zabini and Malfoy continued to meet in the library even after their assignment was handed over.  His friendship with Ron and Hermione were still strained a bit and Harry tried to give them some space.
Inside the office, Hagrid was still weeping silently. Only making sounds when he sniffled. Sitting down beside his friend, Harry didn’t dare look anywhere but at the headmaster. Dumbledore didn’t show any emotion, giving away a clue to his punishment.
Harry stared directly into Malfoy’s ice grey eyes. He had never been so close to him before. Seeing him as if for the first time, Harry realized that Malfoy had almost invisible freckles across his pale nose. Just a few, perhaps three or four, but they were there. His eyes, which were usually narrowed at Harry, were round and curious, although the constant arrogance was hard to miss.
In this chapter, Severus Snape will have a bigger part and will continue to be a big part of the story because he is my absolute favorite character from the Harry Potter-universe.
Picking up his things, he sat out to take notes when a gush of wind sent chills down his spine. Noticing his shivering from sitting close to the open window, Knott asked him where his pullover was. Considering he had just seen him wearing it at breakfast.
“You can drink this one as well, Lupin. It is not the wolfbane potion, but simply a mild pain reliever for the formation.”
Their beverages came back only second later, balancing on a black tray. Both men took their presented mugs and Severus enjoyed the scolding bitterness on his tongue. The rich taste of black roasted beans settled in his stomach and he already felt more alert than before.
“It’s not the same. You and I are… different. But I don’t speak to Draco about how he is feeling at any point. If he says he is alright, then you stop snooping around. If he wants to talk or asks for advice, then of course I’ll give him my honest opinion. Beside that? You stay away from others business.”
Waiting for what felt like hours, he listened for the sound of footsteps towards the entrance. He had even started pacing when the portrait once again opened.
While he waited for Hagrid to open the door, he hurried to loosen the robe wrapped around him. It was genuinely always hot inside the cabin since Aodhan had hatched. How many times had Harry not had to throw off both shoes and shirt? Keeping up with a playful dragon inside a hut barely 3 feet long was certainly hard work.
For a second, Harry just stood there looking at him. Seeing the stupid smirk on his face. Listening to him degrading his friend. And suddenly, hurt wasn’t the main emotion anymore. Anger. Pure, old, hatred. Hatred that charged through his veins, reminding him of everything and every way Malfoy had made his life miserable over the years.
“It’s real champagne and thankfully not the sour fake stuff the muggles sometimes hand out at reception.”
“Sorry, Harry. I have to repair a few things in the greenhouse for Professor Sprout, so I’m heading out. Can you watch him for an hour?” he pointed to the creature still licking the floor clean.
“Severus,” Lupin laid his way-too-hot hand on his forearm. “Is there a possibility of us catching up? Perhaps a cup of tea.” The familiarity of Lupin touching him, suddenly angered him beyond words and he threw it off as if burned.
Harry could feel the fluttering butterflies in his stomach settling again. But the happiness that followed how Malfoy looked into his eyes, that stayed almost the entire way back to the bridge before the other students gathered.
“Your shirt and jeans are good, mate, and the colour scheme works well. I like the, um—silkiness of the fabric? It’s classy. And the undone buttons are,” he gulped. “Nice. Your hair is…”
Harry shook his head. He was on summer break from Auror training with Ron, and he hadn’t actually been on a date since… well, ever since he’d dated Ginny, really. He hadn’t really had time to meet anyone after school, and he’d honestly never cared enough to pursue it.
He patted Weasley’s bag, suddenly, and the ginger swung it over his shoulder, seconds before the both of them looked up.
Draco yelped, eyes flying open as Potter stumbled back looking shellshocked, drawing the back of his hand across his mouth in a slow, obscene drag.
He half- didn’t want to turn around and look at Malfoy. He felt suddenly very stupid, and cold, and why would anyone want to do anything with him, Harry, in this grimy, creepy house with snooty portraits ogling them from all directions?
His breath was coming slowly, deeply, and even as he felt pure arousal rush to his crotch he could feel his eyelids dropping lower, hazy visions of Potter’s legs spread, spread, spread, arse pushed pleadingly, desperately up, replaying in his mind’s eye.
The leaden weight dulling his heart grew still heavier, and the slow syrup of self- hatred started to ooze through him.
“Only you, Malfoy,” Potter said sardonically, and Draco nearly choked from the hypocrisy of the situation.
There was a sigh from somewhere in front of him that gusted past Draco’s ears, and then came the familiar, characteristic sucking feeling that came only from a Sobriety Charm.
The hot water ran in rivulets down Draco’s face, running into his eyes, soaking his hair and his emerald Quidditch undershorts. He opened his mouth in enjoyment, the way it was natural for him to do in the shower, tilting his head back and letting the water pool on his tongue and in the hollows of his throat. His muscles relaxed under the soapy onslaught, exhausted from two hours of gripping his broom tightly, steering and diving and flying against the cruel October wind. The material of his Slytherin shorts moulded to his legs, drenched a dark, wet green, silver piping glinting dully. As he ran his hands through his hair, he hummed a tune over and over.
Draco made exactly three sentences worth of notes on the Hypocrisy Phenomenon in that lesson, and two of them were identical.
He closed his eyes, pressing the damp heels of his hands into his eyelids and trying desperately to block the headache that throbbed evilly around the backs of his eyeballs. When he lifted his hands away his eyelashes were tangled and smattered with droplets of cool water. He gave a slow blink, clearing his head, and squared his shoulders. Then, he raked a hand through his hair so it regained some of its messy charm, rumpled his shirt as artfully as he could, and set a deliberate pace out of the bathroom, opening the door carefully and striding down the dimly lit passageway. He refused to stop, check, plan; the tension in his fists and chest was invisible to anyone simply watching him, and he strolled out from the corridor behind the bar, through the gate, and around the various tables without allowing a sweat to break out on his forehead.
Draco’s mouth hung open. “No… I never really followed her career, but I heard some… I mean,” he passed a hand over his forehead. “Now I’m thinking of it… I remember hearing stuff about the English International team. Salazar, Pans, I know you said the girl you liked was a Quidditch player, but…” he exhaled, feeling out of his depth. “The
Draco blinked. Where was he going with this? Because, at the moment, it sounded a whole lot like a big fat-- admittedly rather Slytherin- style-- compliment.
Sorry I took ages! I needed to sort out some key plot points, because this chapter lays the groundwork for a lot of stuff, and I wanted it to be all there and good. Also, like, it's been One Direction's ten year anniversary, soooo... that's definitely an excuse I'm going to use. Anyway, have fun! It's actually just a little longer than usual, so I guess that's good. Um, also, the last sentence is cheesy as fuck, so sorry about that.
Draco turned his head sharply, amusement curving his mouth upwards, to see Potter flush even deeper, nodding as though he wanted desperately to get out of the office.
They waited until the scent of vaguely musty lemon cake she carried with her had faded away, and the tentative clunks of her walking stick had died down, and then carried on down the stairs in a more subdued fashion, only elbowing each other when strictly necessary.
“I don’t know what you mean,” Potter said guardedly. “I myself was about to ask for the bill and leave, having been as you so kindly put it, ditched. Then you came over and proceeded to throw me back into sixth year, both conversationally and, y’know,” he quirked his lips. “Hormonally.”
Heyyyyy to the lovelies who read all the way through. What did we think? Did you like it? Or was it overemotional rubbish? I've reread it so many times at this point it could be genius or hot garbage, I really wouldn't know. In any case, comment what you think (man alive, I love reading comments) and leave kudos if you thought it was worth the hassle  ;)
“Let’s le—we should leave. Come on, let’s go!” Draco declared, making a violent, aborted move to get up before Blaise grabbed his wrist.
The boys slipped quietly into action, adjusting their hands in their pockets, fingers tense with anticipation. Ron furrowed his brow, and Harry could see him concentrating on his magical core. He was wandlessly Accioing their wands from upstairs. The problem was that he still couldn’t do wandless magic non- verbally, so as Ron opened his lips to whisper the Summoning Spell, Harry started coughing loudly, hacking into his sleeve with practiced ease. It took about forty seconds for their wands to come whizzing into the kitchen, and they caught them deftly, hiding them under the table where they couldn’t be seen.
“We should probably think of what to say before we go in there,” Potter said, eyes dancing with a spark of mischief that made Draco want to lick him. “You know, just roughly. You know what McGonagall’s like.” He looked over his shoulder dramatically, voice swooping into a stage- whisper that shot Draco’s poor nerves to pieces. “Rumour is she’s a
Now he was the one receiving Hermione’s patented patronising look. “Oh, please. You can practically see the brand of your underwear through those.”
“’Mione!” Ron burst into the room, arms overflowing with a quantity of pale, gossamer material. “The stuff for your dress robes arrived—”
“I know,” Potter said, head hung, and Draco felt this fierce, clawing ache to stroke his hair in comfort, and maybe possessiveness, he didn’t know. “I know he is.”
That had been the worst of it, the first day. A couple more weeks of figuring it out, testing the waters, and the routine was set. Harry was fine in Auror training, interacting with the same group of trainees, and sticking close to Ron. He could go out now he knew what to expect, but he liked people with him. On days after he had nightmares, he couldn’t be in close quarters with strangers. It was better if they travelled alone, and better still if they all just stayed at home those mornings.
The rest of the team soared past him to the changing rooms, muttering thanks under their breaths. A hot coil of dread and something else that had been sitting heavily in Draco’s stomach all the while seemed to uncurl and swell to fill his body at the thought of the writing on the shower wall. It was all he could do not to scream with urgency as he turned his broom at breakneck pace and zoomed towards the changing tooms.
“I don’t want the facts.” Zabini leaned in, and Draco resisted the urge to make a sarcastic comment about what did he want then. But Zabini wasn’t done, long fingered hands clenching on the table as though he were physically struggling not to punch Draco.
Draco rolled over with a groan, covers ruched at his waist. He pillowed his head on his arms and lay, hair mussed, breathing slowly, trying to get some sleep. The lingering memory of Potter’s fucking breath on his neck ghosted down his spine, a teasing brush, and he swallowed roughly. Somehow, he seriously doubted he’d be sleeping even a tiny bit that night.
“So, I saw this ad for someone in Witch Weekly. Like, someone to make you happy. You pay them for an hour, and they make you happy. I thought I could use—”
He began to walk down the corridor, not looking behind him to see Malfoy was following. The brush of cool air against his back told him that, in any case, the door had been closed. He couldn’t hear anything… but then his own footsteps were silent too. He’d never met anybody as quiet as him on foot, especially as the wood in this place had to be decades old.
Still, it was with a weary rake of his hand through his hair that he swung his legs out of bed, and started to unbutton his pyjama shirt. He pulled his school shirt on, fingers moving rapidly as he slipped the bone buttons through the slits with nimble movements. But as Draco went to step out of his pyjama bottoms, Theo squeaked.
“Right, well, since we have an even number, I think groups of three…” Flitwick tapped his quill absently against his chin, leaving a tiny smudge of ink on the cleft.
a hardship to have you here. Not- not at all. I said it because I wanted—you just seem, sometimes, like I can’t—”
“Right. Okay.” Draco frowned, trying to process. It felt like a great weight had been lifted from his chest. When he looked between Potter and Zabini, it no longer felt weighted or painful. “Okay.” He gave Zabini a cautious smile, and received a dimpled counterpart in return.
Hermione giggled, understanding immediately. “I knew it. I knew there was a reason you stared at that bloody Map every second of every day, never taking your eyes off the ‘Draco Malfoy’ dot. You practically slept with the thing.”
And that did get Malfoy’s attention. He looked back, and his lips parted slightly in what had to be shock. Harry was only inches away, closer than even he’d realised. He saw Malfoy’s lashes flutter down, thick and dark blonde. Darker than his hair. It felt like he was trying to regroup, pull a mask back up.
Draco jerked out of his trance, hands shaking slightly with nerves as he fiddled anxiously with his trousers, not daring to look up as Potter and Weasley made for the exit. Once he deemed it safe, he blew out a quick breath, head spinning with what he’d just overheard, and straightened, about to leave—only to freeze.
“Alright,” Pansy said, “but only if you swear- Dementor’s Kiss swear- you won’t laugh at me or call me a stalker.”
, the clean lines of Potter’s neck and chin contrasting with the thick, curling mass of his raven hair, which had been unfashionably shaggy in Malfoy Manor, but now it was definitely not… lost in thought, Draco was snapped back into reality by Potter’s acerbic tone.
The room sobered a little, Ron’s eyes becoming shuttered and sadder, as they always did when he was thinking of Fred.
Pansy cut him off. “I didn’t want to worry you. But my point was, I got lulled into a false sense of familial security when we were younger, so I was seriously blindsided when they moved to different fuckin’ countries.” She rubbed the back of her neck, looking sheepish. “I didn’t take it too well. I decided I needed to get away, so I fabricated an excuse of sorts, to like. Pretend I was going out of the country for something.”
Flitwick rose from his desk, wand held precisely between his two fingertips. There was a look of amusement on his small, understanding face, and he murmured a spell that curled around the two boys in a  swirl of purplish smoke. They emerged, coughing, two seconds later, Longbottom’s flipper successfully restored to two rather disproportionate feet. Idly, Draco wondered if they’d always been so big, or if the spell had enlarged them.
“Ah!” She yelped, voice quavery from shock. Draco leaped away from the knot of limbs that was Pansy and Blaise, raking a hand through his hair and stifling a wince.
The taxi was silent; ruminative on Malfoy’s side and frustrated on Harry’s. He was incredibly close to tearing his own hair out. The hunger in his stomach had not abated, but now his mind was racing familiarly, and he missed the slick blur of arousal, where his thoughts had run together like a rainbow river of diesel. Madly, the urge to curl into Malfoy- lick up his throat and grind on him, was rising steadily, a churning wall of desire. Christ, he just felt so fucking needy, like he wanted to be petted and warm and just…
