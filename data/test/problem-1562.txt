Somehow her feet brought her to the nursery ward, and her mind was flooded with memories of Hugo’s birth. The little guy had come nearly five weeks early, and much faster than Rose. The head had already been crowning when Draco had found her in the ministry bathroom in so much pain she hadn’t managed to send for help. She didn’t like to think of what would have happened if she hadn’t always been incredibly punctual on their lunch dates. Draco might not have gone looking for her, and Hugo might have died.
have to work today. Or tomorrow.”
I'm starting uni again next Monday so updates might be a bit irregular bc I forget everything haha, so if there is no update by Sunday evening just poke me in the comments bc the next chapter is already written
I have been prone to accidental magical flares in the past. I could feel my magic bubbling up that night - I suppose that was another reason that I didn’t feel like I could get involved. Which seems selfish of me, now that I think about it. I expect you’re going to say that I shouldn’t think like that because it’s beating myself up about it, but I can’t help it. I shouldn’t have cared about protecting the wizarding world when people were being hurt. I should have been able to step in somehow. I don’t think I’ll be able to get away from that thought. If I’d stepped in at the time, I wouldn’t have had the meltdown that I did and the Ministry wouldn’t have felt the need to get involved. I’m sorry, now I sound like I’m not grateful for your help - I am, I truly am. I’m just writing as I think again.
“Of course, love.”
Watching out of the corner of her eye, she could see the bemused expression on Harry’s face turn to amusement as he picked up the string and Aurora immediately pounced for it. The ragdoll cat was one of the youngest in the cafe, but she was also one of the most empathetic. Luna smiled as she sensed Harry’s nerves disappearing.
Draco just nodded and pulled his knees to his chest while he watched Harry leave. He wasn’t sure if it hurt more or less, knowing that he had a family of his own outside of Scorpius this time around. He just knew it hurt, worse than any
That made Harry lift himself up. “I made you feel bad?”
“Scorpius, I never want you to act like you are
And then the man himself, Draco Malfoy. His skin was no longer pale white, it was ashy grey. His cheeks were even hollower than they had been after Draco had been released from his Azkaban holding cell. He looked skinny to the bone despite the IV constantly pumping nutrients into his system through his right hand. Pansy could not see his left arm because his mother was hogging it, but his right arm showed scarily thin fingers.
“Sorry.” Harry apologised. He even had the decency to look sheepish. “I didn’t really think about it. You just looked so tense, I wanted to make you relax.”
“Fine.” Harry sighed, but he relaxed into Draco’s arms all the same. Draco had discovered that Harry had a lot of ‘facts’ he knew about his body. Like the fact that he weighed too much, or the fact that his knees were ugly, or the fact that his hair was gross. Only none of those things were actually true, and Draco did his best to convince Harry of that every time he discovered another fact. “You’re strict.”
Now that I’ve done it, I don’t think it is silly to write my thoughts down. In fact, I’ve started to think it’s more silly
“I’ve given you a minute!” Victoire hissed back. “Seven minutes to be precise, and I honestly don’t fancy you wetting yourself and becoming a broomcicle before we’re five miles out. Now put those brooms back you wuss, we’re taking the bus.”
I’ve had… trouble reaching out for help in the past and I don’t want to go there again. I know my friends are there for me but… they’ve also moved on and are… in a much better place than me.
. Last time he’d seen him, Draco had just been sentenced to four years of house arrest for his war crimes.
Harry nodded and Hermione walked off.
"What do you mean?" Luna asked.
Hermione chuckled. "I know, Luna. It's just...I don't want to mess this up. I've never felt this way before and I think I'm just scared of my own feelings: my feelings for you." Then, when she felt Luna's sympathy for her, she knew it was time. She stepped closer to Luna and she kissed her.
"Okay, sure." She then walked over to Harry and Draco, who were having their own discussion. "You go on without us, Luna and I will catch up."
"Alright. Tell me exactly what's been happening. How long has this been going on for?"
"Malfoy?" He asked.
"We are starting with being friends, since we were enemies for so long." He replied.
Draco was confused. He hadn't told his mother who his soul mate was but somehow she knew.
"Ah, sorry."
Harry's eyes widened and he was so surprised by this that he spat his tea back into his cup. "What? Why do you think this?" Then he saw the tears rolling down her face. He stood up, walked over to her and hugged her. "Hermione, it's okay. Everything will be fine."
Harry put his wand on the table so that she could see it. "It's amazing. At Hogwarts, you learn loads of magic." He picked his wand up with the intent of showing her a small amount of magic. "What's your favourite animal?" He moved a cup so that it was close to him.
"Ah, yes, I'm sorry for breaking his heart, Mrs Weasley." Hermione said.
Harry looked confused. "Alright, meet outside Honeydukes?"
Draco shook hands with Harry's aunt and uncle, and introduced himself. "I'm Draco. It's nice to meet you."
She sobbed into Harry's arms, and Harry let her. Once she calmed down, she explained. "It won't be fine. Everything is so messed up. Why is it not simple?"
"Hermione, can we talk?" Luna paused, and she saw Hermione glance over to the boys. "Alone?"
George and Teddy were sitting with Harry and Draco, but before either of them could ask any questions, an owl dropped a letter in Harry's lap. It was addressed to Harry, Hermione, Draco and Luna.
"That's something I don't know." Her excitement failed.
Draco took Harry's hand. "We might have to rethink that."
The next morning, they had 4 letters waiting for them.
"Morning, 'Mione." Luna whispered.
By the time he thought about going home, it was getting dark. He realised that he had ten text messages from Hermione and 5 from Ron.
"Yeah, especially when you're going to talk to your soul mate for the first time since you figured it out." Harry retorted.
Soon after, Hermione and Harry left. They went shopping to buy ingredients for Hermione to cook dinner, then, they returned home.
Hermione saw Draco enter the room, but continued anyway. "I think you should, Harry. Give them another chance." Draco looked confused, and Hermione saw this. "And take Draco with you."
I have written to Teddy like you suggested.
"Hermione."
Luna was surprised, especially as Hermione has just expressed her feelings like this, but she kissed back.
"Scared, Granger?" Draco realised he'd said something similar to Harry in their second year at Hogwarts.
"Yes, okay, I know everyone knows that my soul mate is Draco. There's no need to hide it anymore."
Harry looked up at Mrs. Weasley. "What did she tell you?"
"There's a prophecy." Minerva stated. "From about 300 years ago." Everyone was curious. "It says: 'The three Gryffindors, who defeat the greatest evil, as a reward, will learn of their soul mates in the year of its eleventh anniversary. Of those three Gryffindors, one will be bonded to a Slytherin, one to a Ravenclaw, and the last to a Hufflepuff.' " All five were shocked.
Mrs Weasley opened the door. "Harry, Hermione, I didn't expect you today." Harry and Hermione stepped to the side to reveal their soul mates. Mrs Weasley got very excited. "Ah, I see." She let them in, shaking Draco's hand, before pulling Luna into a hug. "Welcome, both of you."
Harry had decided that Hermione and Luna could have his house, as he would be staying in Hogsmeade whilst teaching at Hogwarts - just until they found a place of their own. This meant the four of them having to live together for another week or so.
Hermione walked into the garden and Draco turned, expecting to see Harry.
Draco,
"Who's her soul mate?"
Mother,
Then Ron explained. "Same with me." Harry didn't know what to do or what to say. He stormed back into the house and no one followed him.
"We understand." Draco and Harry said.
"Thanks." Teddy opened it and read it out loud. Harry was pleased that his godson was finally getting the chance to go to Hogwarts.
Hermione hadn't finished yet, but to her relief, everyone kept quiet. "It also said that out of the three of us, one would have a Slytherin soul mate," she pointed to Harry, "one would have a Ravenclaw soul mate," she pointed to herself," and the other would have a Hufflepuff."
Harry had cheered Hermione up a bit now and she felt she was ready to answer his questions now. "Thanks, Harry. What did you ask me before I started crying?"
"I'm sorry too. Although, I think saving your life kind of makes up for everything I'm sorry for." They but chuckled quietly. There was silence for a few moments until Draco turned to look at Harry and Harry did the same.
Harry replied trying to look through the blazing light. "I haven't done a thing. I thought you had done this."
"Harry. Hermione told me what's been going on." She walked over and hugged him. "I thought everything was going well between you and Ginny. What changed?"
"Yes, dear."
Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy arrived at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry early on the first day of September. They were excited to start teaching and to move in to their temporary home in Hogsmeade.
It was Friday. Harry was on his way to meet Draco for a drink. He was excited and he didn't know why. He just assumed it was to do with the soul mate thing.
"What is it?" Harry could tell that it was really bothering her, even more than the thought of breaking up with Ron.
"Oh." She paused. "I see it now."
Mrs. Weasley gave the other two letters to Harry. The first was also a letter from Hogwarts. It was asking if Harry could become the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, which of course, he accepted. The other letter was from Ginny. Mrs. Weasley took Harry outside.
Dudley was surprised. "Even after everything I did to you when we were kids?"
"I don't know. I think we should go and talk to McGonagall about this." She suggested. "I'll send her an owl. Should we go on Sunday?"
"Well..." Harry said.
"I thought that this only happened once every thousand years." Draco was now even more confused about the soul mate information that he's read.
Ginny.
{Hermione} Come back to The Burrow. You need to hear the rest.
Dear Harry,
"Don't be sorry, dear." Mrs Weasley hugged Hermione again. "I completely understand."
"Hermione broke up with him." She wasn't shocked at all. "Why aren't you surprised, Mrs Weasley?"
{Ron} Look Harry, we're sorry we've kept this from you but it's for your own good. We need to talk about this.
Molly and Arthur.
It's not your fault.
Dear Ginny,
Mrs Weasley shouted again. "BE QUIET." She stopped shouting when everyone was quiet. "Stop asking questions and let her explain."
"Not your fault. Its this stupid soul mate thing." Harry was cheering up a bit now, and he thought that it was something to do with the soul mate bond. "How long have you known?"
"Yes, but we don't know who, yet." Hermione replied.
I'm sorry. I wish things could be different and I'm sorry it took me so long to realise.
"Harry. Ginny says that she doesn't love you anymore." Hermione's voice was soft, but that didn't help anything. Harry broke down in tears, and fell to the ground. Harry was unaware of everything happening around him. Teddy had sprinted out to comfort his godfather. Ron had burst out the door shouting about his sister. Mr. Weasley walked over to his wife, looking disappointed at their daughter.
"Hello, Harry." They both found this meeting a little awkward at first.
Bye Harry.
{Hermione} Harry, if you don't come back right now, you'll be forced to live without your soul mate.
"That's what it sounds like." McGonagall replied. She looked back at the writing in the book. "It also says that after a soul mates first kiss, they have to get married within 6 months, or both will be in grave danger, and death will occur soon after." She stopped to look at the shocked faces in front of her. "If they do marry, however, they will both live to an extraordinary age." Hermione and Luna were staring at each other, Harry and Draco were doing the same.
"Okay..." Dudley started, as they walked into the shop. They began looking at owls and cats. "And you say this is rare?" Harry nodded in response. "How rare?"
"What the hell, Potter?" Draco replied. "What have you done to me?"
"Just meet me at The Three Broomsticks at ten tonight. I'll tell you then." With that, Harry hung up, leaving Hermione worried.
"What the hell?" Harry shouted and heard the same from a few metres away. He then realised he recognised the voice.
Hermione returned and told Harry what Draco had told her. Harry then stood up and walked outside to talk to his soul mate.
I'm not quite sure what to say in this letter, because the last time we spoke, you were sending us off to be protected while you tried to defeat the dark wizard.
Hermione was still silent.
"Friends." He smiled.
When Hermione turned to see that it was Draco, not Luna, she sighed with relief. "Oh thank Merlin."
P.S. Don't worry about asking Ginny, we've already told her to come.
From,
George was still very childish. "So that's why you were with Ron. Because he's so much like a girl that you couldn't tell the difference." Then, he felt Ron slap him round the back of the head, before storming out. Harry couldn't help but laugh his head off.
Harry knew that he was going to be in so much trouble for this. He jumped up but was instantly knocked back down. There was something bright shining around him.
Hermione stared into Luna's beautiful eyes. "Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?"
"-once in a thousand years. Yes, we know." He finished. "But I believe she's right. I hadn't thought of it until she mentioned it to me, but now I'm remembering signs that they are soul mates."
"It will be very soon." She told them. "Harry, Mrs. Weasley, come with me." They both followed her an the boys were left wondering again."What's going on, Hermione?" Mrs. Weasley asked, as they found themselves in the garden again. Hermione didn't say anything until she knew that the boys were eavesdropping.
"Yes, Harry. I asked Hermione about it a while ago, because I knew that something odd was going on." Teddy told Harry. "I didn't want to tell you about it because of what was happening with Ginny. That's why I asked Hermione."
Hermione was confused. Then she looked at Harry. "You already told her, didn't you?"
When morning came, Harry found Hermione in the kitchen cooking. She looked very cheerful, considering the events from last night.
"Ah, yes, in quite a state. I can't work out what's wrong with him." George led Harry upstairs.
"Bye, mate." Ron said.
"Bye." Ron kissed Hermione on the cheek and Hermione and Harry walked off. They got into Harry's car and started to drive. It was a while before either of them said anything.
Draco and Harry looked at each other before smiling. "It's not that bad once you get talking." Draco explained.
"Okay." Hermione started. "You should all know the real reason I broke up with Ron." She paused. "Ron." She looked directly at him. "You should know more than anyone else. I'm sorry I didn't tell you yesterday." She wasn't quite sure how to put this, so she just spoke. "So, I found my soul mate too." Everyone, apart from Mrs Weasley and Harry gasped. Then, they started talking, asking questions, all at once.
Dudley.
As they stepped into the Leaky Cauldron, witches and wizards fawned over him as usual, and they struggled to reach the entrance to Diagon Alley. When they finally got there, Harry began to tap the necessary bricks on the wall.
"Can't you work it out for yourself?" When he didn't answer, she said: "Come on Harry, you defeated Voldemort."
"Look, I've already told Mrs. Weasley what's going on. She's given me the names of Ginny's friends. I'm going now to find her. I'll be back soon. Just save me some dinner and stay here until I come back." Hermione said with guilt.
Draco stood up as soon as he saw Harry enter the garden.
"What was the dark wizards name?" Daisy asked.
"A duck." She was a lot happier now.
"WHAT? YOU CAN'T DO THAT!" Ron shouted back.
Draco and Harry both sat down that evening to send letters to all those outside of Hogwarts that they want to be at their wedding.
"Interesting." Harry laughed. "Do you want to grab a drink tomorrow evening at the Leaky Cauldron?"
"Tomorrow, and I've promised her that I'll be there for her when she does." Harry explained.
Dear Harry,
"I've been keeping this a secret for a while, and I'm not really sure about it."
Hermione was crying. "I'm sorry." She whispered, but Harry still heard her as he held her in his arms.
The morning after telling the Weasley family, Harry woke up to find that an owl he didn't recognise was standing on him, with a letter in his beak. He opened it and read it to himself.
"I understand. I'll ask Mrs. Weasley about that dinner." They both stood up and shared a quick hug. "I should probably get going. Ron will be wondering where I am." With a smile, she walked off, leaving Harry to find his own way through the crowd.
{Hermione} I've found a way to help you find who it is.
"So did I, that's why we are going to McGonagall. Care to join us?" Harry asked.
"Finally!" Hermione sighed. She handed the book to McGonagall. It was opened quickly, and McGonagall searched for the correct information.
Harry got home to find Hermione asleep on the sofa. He didn't want to disturb her, so he got her a blanket, covered her with it, and made his own way to bed.
"And?" George asked, with a huge grin on his face.
"So, what's this got to do with me?" Harry asked.
When he entered the Leaky Cauldron, Draco was sat waiting for him, with two butterbeers in front of him. When Draco spotted Harry, his face lit up. Harry sat down opposite him and was handed a butterbeer.
It ends now, at a quiet, ageless graveyard, where the dirt is a colorless black and the tombstones are all a blinding, bone white. The casket has since been lowered into its plot, the dirt securely returned to its rightful place. They who have been buried made one with the Earth as all must be. Placed gently beside their partner, as close as a kiss. A yard over from their child, all three of them too quickly put beneath the ground.
He hovers in the doorway however, arrested at once by the sight before him. Despite the low, white lamp light Potter and Edward are almost dipped entirely in shadow. Potter is swaying back and forth to some silent tune, and Edward sleeps soundly again against his chest, small hand bunched and bustled against Potter’s neck.
Xoxo- Audge

He grabs a handful of stale owl treats from their dish on the windowsill, and throws them at the screeching thing.
This question. It’s one he wagered Potter would ask eventually. It’s a question Draco often pondered over himself. One he regretted for a long time, when that, that beast, when Fenrir-
“Well, maybe we should. Talk. About everything.” Potter stumbles through the sentence, beads of sweat spotting his forehead. He keeps looking over his shoulder, and if not that, towards the door. It makes him look batty.
There is one more thing to worry about, however, and that’s Potter burgeoning insistence on making some kind of peace between them. Can they not just co-parent separately like every other couple of wizards who happen to share spawn but can’t stand the sight of each other?
Draco blinks at Potter, his heart pumping loudly in his ears, and at last those blasted tears fall and Potter jumps back at them. Draco wipes them away gracelessly, feeling like an idiot. He’s so weak. Always has been.
“Thank you.” Draco relents.
Dont worry, I ain't rushing this shit, it's all according to plan ;)
“Morning.” He manages, eyes flitting this way and that. He doesn’t dare make eye contact with the other man, the green would be arresting in the morning sun and Draco isn’t prepared for that sort of thing just yet.
“We’re getting tea, Teddy. Would you like some?” Potter asks the toddler. The boy blinks owlishly, and as natural as breathing his skin becomes slightly darker and his hair grows untamed and black. He looks like some bastardized version of a Potter-Malfoy child, or a Black. Draco goes decidedly with the latter.
With that, Draco turns on his heel and almost marches into the living room.
“He can sleep through anything, aye?” Harry hums awkwardly, jutting his thumb in the pushchair’s direction, a still slumbering Edward inside it. Draco huffs a humorless laugh and buries his hands deep into his robe pockets.
Also, if any of my French is wrong, just kill me :)
Draco scans the scar as though it will fill in the blank. It’s as it’s always been, a stark pale pink network of jagged tails against the red brown of his forehead. A lightning bolt, its root beyond his hairline, its end running through his left eyebrow. It tells him nothing besides how breathtaking it is. How impossible.
But they’re all a little batty now, arent they?
“Do you really have any other options, Malfoy? If so, pray tell.” His question is still sharp, but its certainly more polite than what Draco would’ve said, evidently.
“What?” Potter asks, but Draco is already barreling on.
“I do have one question I’d like to ask.” Potter eyes flick from each of Draco’s and back, the electric green of them as shocking as ever against his dark skin. Draco dreads whatever he’ll ask, of course, but he’s gotten this bloody far.
“I’ve got a pushchair in my bag, why don’t we go to a cafe? Speak of it there.” Draco catches Potter's eyes again, and this time there’s an earnest defeat about them.
{Ron} Come back. Teddy needs you.
"Now, sit down at your places at the table, the students are about to arrive." And she walked out of the door.
Once again, as they stepped through the giant front doors to the castle, they were greeted by a nervous Professor McGonagall. "Welcome, Professor Potter, Professor Malfoy." She said, leading them to the Great Hall to join the other teachers, new and old. Unsurprisingly, Neville Longbottom was now teaching Herbology - as his dream had been since he was twelve years old.
"No, Harry. I can't believe she'd do this to me." Harry sat down next to him.
{Hermione} Fine, don't talk to us.
"Yep. Although, apparently they just found out that his daughter is a witch." Harry said, debating whether it was a good idea to go or not.
Harry was the first to speak. "So... Ron will find his soul mate too?"
"Yay!" Replied Teddy and he ran off.
"I'm sorry." Draco said, looking at the ground.
Harry looked towards his feet, trying to avoid eye contact with anyone. "I...I might."
I should have told you this in person before I left but I've found my soul mate and we are getting married. 31st of October at Hogwarts. I'd like you to be there.
Mrs. Weasley walked over to Harry and hugged him quickly. "I'll go talk to her now. You and Teddy can stay here tonight. Get some sleep. I'll tell you in the morning what I find out." She smiled and disapparated.
"The first question would be: who is it? It's Luna. Luna Lovegood is my soul mate." She was terrified and she didn't know why. "And secondly, we seem to be an exception to the myth. This is the second time in a thousand years, with Harry and Draco being the first. No one else noticed before I did. We don't know why, all we know is that it is happening. We are going to hopefully find out more tomorrow though." She explained. "Right, any questions now?"
"Great idea." George shouted, and made them jump. Harry and Draco laughed, but in the end they decided that it was a good idea.
"I'm always optimistic when possible. Lets go!" She grabbed his arm and they disapparated to the front door of Luna's house. "Here goes." Knock. Knock. Knock.
Hermione walked back to Luna. "What do you want to talk about?"
Everyone made their way to the table and Dudley introduced them to his family.
"Oh, I definitely won't forget." And with that, Draco disapparated. Harry smiled, thankful that it went well.
..................................................................................................................................................
"We have a few things to tell you concerning that." Harry continued. "We talked to Professor McGonagall today. She was able to tell us that there was a prophecy of this and that its a reward for defeating Voldemort." Everyone shuddered, they still didn't appreciate the use of his name, even after he had been gone for 11 years.
Your cousin,
"There's nothing you could have done differently. Nothing can change this. You have to trust me when I tell you." Mrs. Weasley believed that Harry wouldn't trust her on this. "There's a myth that we all have soul mates but it is very rare for people to find out who their soul mate is."
"Not you as well." He stated off, and stormed off to sit in his favourite chair to watch tv. Daisy's face fell, and Harry knew what he needed to do. He looked to Dudley, who apparently received the message. Dudley took Alice and Petunia to talk to Vernon - to try to make him understand. They closed the door so that Daisy didn't hear them arguing.
"How long have you known about this soul mates thing?" Draco asked.
"You both die." Harry stated, bluntly.
"I will." George waved goodbye and went back to talk to Ron.
Harry and Hermione turned up at The Burrow, once again. Mrs Weasley let them in, as always, and hugged them both.
Teddy replied. "How did you find out?" He was worried about Harry.
Surprisingly, Ron was first to ask a question. "When did you work it out?" He asked, quietly.
"He just arrived." Hermione explained. "But he wants to know what you want to talk to him about."
"Never mind that now. I need to know more about this soulmate thing." Harry's hair was messy from the encounter with Draco Malfoy. "I need to know what will happen when I find my soulmate."
Instantly, there was an uproar. The Weasley family wasn't at all surprised that Harry and Draco had kissed, but on the other hand, they hadn't thought that Hermione and Luna would kiss that soon after finding out. This was because Hermione and Ron had been in love with each other for almost 7 years before they kissed, and Luna, well she hadn't been in a relationship at all, ever.
"31st of October." Harry stated.
It was such a fucking treacherous curse, but the Healers had told him it was so weak now it couldn’t do any damage anymore. He wondered if they’d lied to him just because of his name. If they wanted to see him squirm and hope and break just like the many grieving families of war victims had done. He should have made sure Scorpius had more check ups, should have given custody to Astoria’s parents. He clearly wasn’t fit to raise a child, let alone a child that needed special care.
Warning: this chapter has some suicidal thoughts.
Draco Malfoy
Draco was in five states of
“You’re so mature, Potter.”
“Draco, she meant well for fucks sake!” Harry swore as he came to stand next to him and put a hand on his shoulder. “Leave it alone!”
He’d wanted to yell more and more with each word those disgusting old warts uttered.
, Draco, are you alright?”
Remembering and honouring the dead had a little something, a place to lighten the mood, relive the inside jokes you used to share, trying to make a funeral a celebration of the life lived, not the mourning of a death. Forgetting for a moment that the one you’re trying to amuse is a flicker of a spirit above at best, just a memory at worst.
“Did your mother just tell us to have kinky sex?” Harry, the traitor, sounded far too awake and amused for someone who’d only just woken up. The fucker had probably listened in on everything, and spent a great deal of time before that looking through his eyelashes at Draco’s content expression.
Draco took a shuddering breath. “But it still hurts.”
Despite everything Draco couldn’t help but smile as he got up and planted his lips on Harry’s temple. “I’d be lost without you.”
She watched carefully as Harry and Draco greeted each other somewhat awkwardly, though they were soon smiling fondly at Aurora.
thoughts, after all. But the human brain doesn’t work like that.
He only realised how true his last fear was once he’d spoken it it aloud.
Please keep fueling that love for the outdoors. People often do not realise it, and I have not mentioned it so far since you already mentioned going for frequent walks, but being around nature is one of the best and easiest ways to get out of your own head. It is not always enough, in my experience, when emotions are running high.
did not choose to be born, but
I’m not afraid of anything you’ve said so far, and I don’t think I will be in the future. Your words, even though they’re just written on parchment, seem to calm me as much as a walk does - I
He felt like he’d been floating in this
Harry didn't immediately reply to that. At least not with words. First he pulled Draco into an even fiercer hug, before explaining, “I never see you open up to anyone. You just swallow everything down and put your son before everything else. And that's hard, I know that because I do it too, but you have so much more to swallow. I had an amicable divorce, you lost your wife. James is a bit too excited sometimes, Scorpius lived in the hospital for nearly a year. You just take it all in your stride and just seeing that makes me want to do even better. And seeing you open up like this and let some stuff out, that just makes me love you more. Don't apologise for that.”
“M’b fibe,” Draco muttered, shooting him a watery glare. The colour of his nose rivaled that of Rudolf, he was shivering all over, and Harry was half convinced a soft blow of air could topple his colleague over. “‘S Chrifmaf eve. Can’t-, can’t call in sick. No obe covers for me ob norbal days.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well maybe that’s because wherever you go people get called out on their bullshit. Their quiet resentments, inability to apologise, lingering racism. And no matter how shit you feel about yourself, it’s never so bad that you don’t challenge people to debates when it’s needed. That’s something to be proud of, not something to feel ashamed about.”
“‘M n’ clingy.” Came the muttered protest from Harry’s side. “Y’ guys ‘re mean.”
“And you think Harry will break up with you because of that?” Again, he couldn’t help it. Relief and the amount of idiocy in Draco’s statement forced him to laugh. “Draco, I’d almost say you don’t know Harry at all, but I know that’s not true. I know this is your self-esteem talking. He
"Draco."
No one answered Harry's question and he became impatient. "Well?" He said and, as if in response to this, Teddy and Ron made their way over to where Hermione and Harry were standing.
They all ate a delicious dinner and said their goodbyes. This left Ron, Harry, Teddy and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley alone, waiting for Hermione. Mrs. Weasley ordered her husband, Ron and Teddy to feed all the animal so that she was left alone with Harry.
"Supposedly?" Dudley saw an owl that he thought his daughter would love, so Harry payed for it and they left with it.
Harry and Draco did as they were told, and sat down to wait for the Sorting Ceremony to start.
"You should do it after Ron. Maybe we should go to McGonagall on Monday. Then you can talk to Luna on Sunday. It'll give you more time, spread events out a little." Harry said, and Hermione didn't reply. "I'll go with you to Luna's if you want. I'll be there if you need me. And anyway, I haven't seen her in ages, it'd be nice to catch up with her."
"I'm not sure you've done anything wrong. When Hermione gets back, she'll tell me where I can find my daughter. I'm going to have a serious chat with her about this." She looked into Harry's eyes. "I hate seeing you like this. You're practically my son. If someone hurts you, it hurts me."
"I know everything." Hermione nodded. "What do you know about it?"
"Yeah, okay." His next few days would be busy. "I'll invite Draco along too. You should talk to Luna too."
{Hermione} Harry, where are you?
"Hermione, calm down." Harry insisted. He then walked off to open the door. Draco was standing there. "Draco. You're early."
"Friends." Draco replied. "But also soul mates, don't forget."
"She told me to tell you that it's for the best." He explained. "And that you can keep the house."
"Oh, we had fun the other night."
The phone rang. Hermione picked up.
"We don't just have to get married, we have to start living together straight away." Hermione replied.
"Harry, nice to see you again." She looked to Hermione. She paused. "Hermione." It sounded like she didn't know what to say either.
Mrs Weasley, Teddy, Hermione and Ron walked over to him and took him into the kitchen to talk. Mrs Weasley answered him, in a whisper. "He's here Harry."
"You can tell me anything, Hermione. I'm always here for you."
Draco then took Alice and Daisy to buy school robes, while Harry and Dudley went to buy Daisy a pet.
"Like what? I know people usually wear black or white suits, or white dresses, but what could we wear that's different?" Draco wondered. Their wedding planning was currently taking up most of their spare time, so they were sat in the Great Hall eating lunch while having this discussion.
Harry and Draco had just finished discussing flowers - and came to the conclusion that red roses are always best - when Harry bought up the fact that they hadn't decided on the date yet.
"Draco?"
"You do?" She was surprised.
"Okay." She was on the verge of tears and knew she couldn't stop it, so she got up to find some tissues and returned quickly. "I-I think...I m-might...know who my soul mate too."
"Where's she going to stay?" Ron was still worried about her, even though she's broken his heart.
{Ron} Mum is worried.
Harry sat there quietly, listening and driving. They were almost at Harry's house. "I understand." They stopped in front of his house and got out of the car. Harry led them inside. Harry made them some tea and they sat down at the kitchen table.
"Something happened just before I came back here." Harry didn't know how to describe what had happened. "I was knocked over and all I could see at first was a really bright light shining around me. Then I heard his voice, but the light didn't fade away until I disapparated."
Molly Weasley jumped at the thought and immediately sent an owl to invite everyone over for dinner. When everyone arrived (everyone = Arthur, Bill and Fleur, Charlie, Percy, George and Angelina, but Ron and Ginny couldn't make it, Teddy was there too), they sat down for dinner. Hermione and Harry hadn't really prepared for what they were going to say, but they stood up together.
Hermione decided that she should say something. "Harry, the myth says that both people have to find out for themselves or from each other. If they don't, they'll be doomed for eternity."
"We're not really sure, Luna." Harry replied. "McGonagall knows some stuff about it, so we are going to see her tomorrow."
"Mrs Weasley?" Harry asked.
Minerva McGonagall paced up and down in the Hogwarts library, searching for the right book. Hermione and Draco were trying to help, neither having much luck. Harry and Luna stood together, occasionally moving when everyone else did.
Harry.
Harry nodded and Draco then had to ask. "What's going on? Where are we going?"
"Finally, it took you long enough." She replied. "You were saying, Hermione?"
Hermione and Luna had decided to have their wedding in December, a few weeks before Christmas.
"For being so mean to you in school. For not being appreciative when you saved my life. For everything." Draco felt tears in his eyes but tried to hold them back.
The two pairs of soul mates decided it was best to talk to the Weasley's after finding out that they had to get married. They apparated outside the Burrow and knocked on the front door.
"Bye, Mrs Weasley." With that, he dropped the floo powder and shouted the place he wanted to go. He vanished and appeared to find George laughing at him. "What's so funny?"
..................................................................................................................................................
"I'm not sure, he didn't say why he wanted to talk to you." Hermione said. "Do you want me to ask?"
"Okay. Luna, do you know the myth about soul mates?"
"Oh." She didn't know what to say. She knew there had been a reason she'd never been in a proper relationship with anyone, but now she knew that this was it. This was the reason. Hermione was the reason. "So that's what the nargles were trying to tell me."
Later that night, after the shouting, swearing and crying had died down, Harry questioned Hermione for more answers.
"Don't worry." Harry said, shakily. He was terrified of what his aunt and uncle would say.
"It started about a year ago and has gotten a lot worse since." Hermione nodded, taking a mental note of this. "When I cook dinner for the three of us, she refuses to eat it but I'll catch her eating something later on. She's been going out more frequently, she showers more often, she spends more time in our room. Nearly every time I enter a room she's in, she'll leave and go into another. Hermione, I need your help." Harry could feel tears beginning to fall. "I can't remember the last time she slept in the same bed as me." He took a sip of his drink. "Even Teddy has noticed Ginny acting like this. We've both tried talking to her but she just ignores us."
"I'll be there." She reached over and squeezed Hermione's hand, but quickly let go. She turned to Harry. "How have you and Draco approached being soul mates?"
Dudley stopped with shock. "A few days? And you are already engaged? Is that how it is in the wizarding world?"
Minerva McGonagall."
She looked interested by this. "Really, what's it like? What magic can you do?"
"Ron's soul mate is a Hufflepuff?" Mr Weasley asked.
"Once in a thousand years." Mrs. Weasley told him, the she continued. "The myth says that both people are in love with each other long before they realise it. Others around them realise it, but they don't."
"Harry, what's wrong?" She asked.
"Ah, this is my fiancé, Draco." Harry replied. Dudley and Draco shook hands and Dudley let them inside the familiar house.
It was time to go to McGonagall. Harry, Draco, Hermione and Luna were ready. They were preparing to apparate to Hogsmeade, when Luna pulled Hermione aside.
"Alright. Call me if you need me. See ya." He started walking back downstairs and George followed.
Hermione saw a look on Harry's face that told her he already knew. "But you already know, don't you? And you know who it is."
Thanks,
"For what?"
"Who is it?" Mrs Weasley couldn't believe what she was hearing.
"And?" She replied.
Dudley and Alice.
Harry smiled and wiped his reappearing tears. "Thanks, Mrs. Weasley." Just then, the boys returned wondering what was going on.
Harry,
{Hermione} There is a way you can find who it is, you just need to come back.
"Well, I can say that I didn't expect that." Replied Dudley. "Sorry for making assumptions in the letter."
He nodded. "I'll be at yours at 3." He liked to plan in advance with Hermione.
"How do you know this if he doesn't?"
I think I know your answer already but I want to invite you anyway because you will always be important to me. Draco and I are getting married on Halloween and I, we want you to be there. I understand if you don't and my only wish is that in the future we can be friends.
..................................................................................................................................................
Love from Harry.
Bill looked over to Harry and Draco. "What will happen when Harry goes to teach at Hogwarts?"
"It's alright, I understand why you wanted me here." Harry was glad that Ron hadn't lost his temper completely. He would have physically hurt Hermione. "I'm going to find Ron, make sure he's okay. Is there anything you want me to tell him?"
"Harry, you came!" Dudley almost shouted. He held out his hand, and Harry shook it in reply.
..................................................................................................................................................
..................................................................................................................................................
"Can Teddy stay here for a few nights, please?" He asked, already knowing her answer.
..................................................................................................................................................
Draco was happy that he and Harry were getting on well. "I'll be there though. You will have to tell me what time when you know, but I'll be there. I want to know more about this situation."
"Of course, it sounds like a great idea. I shall announce this after the Sorting Ceremony." Professor McGonagall smiled, started to walk away. As she reached the door, she turned around. "Don't expect everyone to except this though, not everyone will like this."
"It's Luna Lovegood."
"WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?" Hermione shouted, scaring Teddy.
Hermione sighed. "It just doesn't feel right anymore. We haven't moved forward for about 8 years and he hasn't asked me to marry him or anything like that." She paused. "I can't carry on like this if it's not going anywhere."
Harry and Draco offered to take Dudley and his family to Diagon Alley that afternoon. Daisy's excitement over the duck had only just died down, and now she was extremely excited to buy her school supplies.
From Ginny.
"Hello, Draco."
"Why? What made her stop loving me?"
Dudley was confused. "And what happens if you kiss and don't get married within 6 months?"
"Of course, he can stay anytime. You can too. You should know this by now."
Harry woke the next morning to find the Weasley's owl at the foot of his bed. He took the letter from the bird and watched it fly away. The letter read:
They were in the restricted section for a while before Hermione finally found the book that they had been searching for.
Harry was about to leave The Burrow. He had said goodbye to mostly everyone, including Teddy, but Hermione and Ron were left.
"Harry." She saw the butterbeer sat in front of her waiting. She lifted it to her lips and took a large gulp. "Thanks." They sat in silence for a few minutes, waiting for someone to say something. "What's this about?" Hermione finally said.
"Certainly." Luna let them enter. She led them to the kitchen table and they sat down. "This sounds urgent."
As they were walking, Dudley decided that he wanted to get to know Harry better now. "So, how long have you and Draco been together?"
Mrs Weasley shouted at George. "WHY WOULD YOU SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT, GEORGE? YOU KNOW HE'S HURT." But, really, this didn't help. He and Harry just kept laughing until Bill put a silencing charm on them both.
"Yes, Harry?"
"I was wondering." Harry started. "Can we have the wedding on the 31st of October?"
"Exactly. Hermione hasn't talked to Luna yet though, so I'm not sure if she's going to come with us."
Hermione thought before a plan popped into her mind. "I'll ask Mrs. Weasley to invite us all over for dinner. I can try talking to Ginny then." This was the best plan Hermione could think of. "Why didn't you say something before?"
"Yes, dear?"
She flashed a small smile. "True. But I thought it would even out after you defeated Voldemort."
Draco stilled, and looked at Harry. “You love me?”
But despite how close they were, George couldn’t stand to be around Fred right now. Couldn’t stand how, every time he brought up Draco and the possibility of visiting the hospital, Fred left or talked around it or pretended not to hear him.
“Daddy!” James’ high pitched scream pierced through the kitchen and Harry quickly stopped putting the milk away before his eldest son attacked him. Lily was quick to follow, after which came Albus and an exhausted looking Andromeda. Teddy might be a tad excitable sometimes, but he was nothing compared to Harry’s hyperactive hurricanes. “Daddy, I missed you Daddy! Are we having pancakes for dinner? Please say yes, Andy made us eat brussel sprouts!”
“I’m sure that’s not true, Draco.” Neville put an arm around Draco and held him close. Then he added, just to get a rise out of Draco, “Last time I checked our potions professor was pretty nice too.”
“Very true.” Draco chuckled and held out his hand so Harry could pull him up after getting to his feet. “They’re so tiny yet they eat so much. I don’t know where they store it all.”
“No more surprising than you wearing muggle jeans, with holes in them no less.”
“Oh.” Draco had never really consciously thought about that. He and his mother had both worked very hard after the war to erase the blood purism from their thoughts, but normal, private etiquette had always stayed the same for them. “I suppose we can.”
“It’s my pleasure,” Neville commented while his brain was a million miles away. When a friend broke his leg, it was easy to think of what to do. Scold Harry for being a reckless flier and then take him to the hospital wing. But this…
, not just a magazine but also the headquarters where all the other national magazines reported back to, meant a busy career, but that didn’t make it any less unacceptable that it had taken her nearly two weeks to get to her best friend who might just be dying.
Might have written the ending a tad drunk. Hope t doesnt affect the spelling too badly. Please let me know if you enjoyed it<3
“Hey Rosie.” Uncle Harry lifted his face from his hands to make room for her on his lap. She climbed in and looked at the sleeping man in the bed, wondering if maybe he’d be ticklish. That always woke her up, even if she didn’t like it. But mostly she looked at him because she didn’t want to look at Uncle Harry. Not until she knew how to make him smile again. “It’s boring don’t you think? Hospitals?”
to write them down. Talking to a pet has never seemed silly to me either. Sometimes I used to think the only sensible conversation I got was with my owl. Certainly better than talking to a rubber duck - at least my owl reacted to my words!
and beckoned her to come in. He put a fresh silencing charm around Scorp’s head and sat up. Despite having been asleep moments before, he was wide awake now. Especially now, when his son was once again in the middle of the situation that had made him touch shy in the first place, Draco wasn’t backing down from his principles.
“Draco!” Harry gasped from the kitchen entrance, but Molly was even quicker to anger at his words.
But Draco was forced to cut off his sentence by a giant yawn.
They were at the hospital in less than ten minutes. Though once the knight bus had been full of passengers in the early hours, now there were none. The latest extensions and extra safety check of the floo network had been quite effective. Lucky for them the bus driver asked no questions after Teddy morphed him into a stern looking older brother or young dad, depending on which way you looked.
But Harry just kept on sobbing into his shoulder, so George kept holding him. He looked at Draco’s still form as he rubbed Harry’s back. Wished the man would wake up and smirk at him, or wake up and go off in a jealous rage. Wake up and cry because he thought he’d lost Harry. If only he would wake up. Just wake up. Simply
A single tear fell from his eye. He hadn’t seen Harry in months and he
. I grew up thinking that and it feels horrible.”
“What? No, I can’t do that!” Draco shot a horrified look at his best friend. “With a face like that he’s
“It’s not my fault half of the stuff you say is less than intelligent, Potter,” Draco shot back, carefully avoiding the words
Still, he held his focus firmly on Draco’s face as he approached the bed, getting ready for another kiss. He wanted it to work so desperately, every fiber of his being thrummed with it. But still he halted just before their lips would brush. Something about this felt too final to do it without saying anything.
Draco sent a glare in Potter’s direction and shifted in his seat, preparing himself for another quick departure. He didn’t come here to have everything that sucked in his life pointed out to him. He could do that perfectly fine on his own, thank you very much.
“Oh, please don’t tell me I look skinny.” Draco rolled his eyes as he and his mother began to exit the bathroom. “It’s all people say about me these days.”
“You look happy.” Draco was startled by his mother’s voice and his eyes suddenly flew wide open. His mother stood in the doorway of the bedroom in a morning gown and a set of pyjamas, which Draco could swear were muggle. He was quite baffled.
Draco let out a humourless chuckle. No, the Gryffindors had put their hand over their heart when it came to his dark mark, but he doubted they would do so again when they found out their best friend was dating a common street whore. And then he choked out a sob, because even after five years of having a proper job he still didn’t feel any better than his lowest moment in life.
Harry flashed him a smile. “Thanks, that would be great.”
“Ah well, it’s not like I’ve got anywhere to be anyway.”
Everything was moving past her. People, voices, words, food. She didn’t notice any of it. She was vaguely aware of the fact that there was
spoil him?” Draco huffed. “Harry is the one who spoils people. I swear to Merlin, if those kids didn’t have Ginny or Andy, they would never eat fruit again.”
“Can I enter?”
“You really hate me?” Harry had stopped trying to drag him back to bed, and Draco really couldn’t be sure if the quiver in his voice was faked or not. Of course, that was why he had to be responsible all the time now. He had people to look after, a reputation to built up, a potions business to run.
I need to be able to talk to you freely about everything, but I’m afraid that once you know who I am you won’t want to be my Mind Healer (friend?) anymore. I’d be willing to bet that you know more about me than I know myself. Everyone else seems to.
She glanced at Harry again, watching as he literally twiddled his thumbs in front of him. She understood now. He was nervous. Well, she could help with that. Bending down, she scooped up the cat that was rolling on the floor at her feet.
He sometimes sang Harry to sleep, when his nightmares were rough. He got the hang of nappies after just two tries, and somehow babies always fell asleep around him. Just after Draco had moved in with Harry, they’d discussed having kids. They both wanted nothing more, especially Harry when he saw how brilliant Draco would be as a dad, but Draco wanted to wait.
Once he sat, James climbed into his lap and gave him a hug. Draco didn’t understand why he did that, until the kid began to talk, saying things would be alright, that there was no need for panic. He was mimicking his dad. Draco couldn’t remember a time when he’d had a full blown panic attack in the presence of Harry’s kids, but if anyone was going to disobey rules, sneak out of bed and see something like that it was James. And though Draco prefered his father, it did help a little bit. At least now he could focus on how weird it was that he was getting calmed down by a child, and how inappropriate as well. He really needed to get a grip on himself. He promised Harry he would watch the kids, and he had.
“I’m sure Harry would outclass me in a heartbeat if he were here.” Neville replied without doubt. The love Harry felt for Draco was almost too pure to watch. Of course, most of the time they bickered and dared each other to stupid competitions that gave a very entertained Head Student Teddy Lupin an excuse to give their professors detention. But when it really mattered, when push came to shove, there wasn’t a purer love in the world that the one between those two. They just
“Draco, are you-,” Harry entered and looked around for a moment before he spotted him. “
“It’s really fucking stupid how well we fit together you know?” he eventually said after he finally managed not to melt. “Because we fought for all those years and I still don’t want to like you but you’re making that bloody impossible, you stupid speccy idiot.”
Somehow I am not surprised to learn that you are hot-headed. I was too, back at Hogwarts, and my situation sounds quite similar to yours. I am not proud of the fact that I never apologised either. I wrote maybe one hundred of apology letters, but I never had the courage to send them.
“Can I still ask what brought you here?”
“Oh my God you guys are
“A disaster father and a big teddy bear.” Draco shook his head and leaned his back against the couch. “I’m sorry. My emotions are still a bit all over the place from yesterday. You know how I am after a panic attack.”
“Albus, I want you to go get Dad. Floo Auntie Hermione and Uncle Ron, they’ll know what to do.” The voice of James sounded so far away, even though the kid was speaking right next to his ear. Draco was at a loss with his mental state now. Everything seemed covered in fog, yet his emotions were sharp as knives, the panic clawing at him, drowning him because
“We had these parties when I was a kid. All the traditionalists in my father’s books came there. Hallow’s Eve, stories of ancient rites, death, chasing away evil spirits that turned into a muggle hunt. A contrast as stark as possible against what muggles call Halloween. My father and everyone else got drunk on wine and the power their families used to have, and then they got angry about having lost it. A mourning of the good old days.”
“Yes. You.” Draco came closer and rested his head on Neville’s shoulder. He looked so exhausted by life that Neville wrapped him up in a hug, scared Draco might not have the energy to stay standing. “You’re not sleeping on the couch.”
’d her until the day after. She’d tended to Draco’s wounds as soon as she got out of her haze, though neither of them knew exactly how he’d gotten them. Draco’s occlumency shields had been strong enough to not be mentally present for any of it.
“Which is what friends are for.”
When she arrived at the right ward, she was surprised to find not just Hermione and Parkinson there, but Teddy and Victoire as well. And Teddy was silently sobbing into Hermione’s sweater.
Teddy let out a sigh of relief and immediately felt guilty. Draco was fighting for his life and he wasn’t even man enough to get on a broom and fly to him? These days Draco was the first person to defend Hufflepuff, but Teddy felt like that was quite misplaced now. Not that he wasn’t proud of his house, but his house shouldn’t be proud of him. Not when he took the coward’s way out and trodded to the gates of the Hogwarts grounds to catch the bloody
He half expected Mrs Weasley to get mad at him again, but instead she just smiled. “Your mother said exactly the same thing to me moments ago. She said a great deal of other things too. Things I’ve been too proud to admit for a while.” Her smile got a sad touch to it, before it melted away entirely. Her gaze was fixed on a piece of bedframe when she spoke next, her eyes somewhat watery. “It’s not easy, growing old, you know? You feel so proud every time your kids learn something new at first, but later on each new thing just makes you feel a little bit more redundant. Getting parenting advice from your own children is the last stage of that process, because then you truly have nothing left to teach them. People don’t need you anymore.”
“Bartender, just came out of the kitchen, hot as hell, amazing messy hair.” His voice sounded almost breathless, which wasn’t odd considering he’d just seen the bartender
“Stop making it so easy to wind you up, then,” Draco chuckled, and popped the piece of cake into his mouth. “This is high quality free entertainment, Potter. No student worth their brain cells would pass that up.”
I'm not sure if I can manage an update next week, I have a fest deadline coming up and the next part isn't finished yet. and afetr that I'm going to paris so I can promise an update within 1-2.5 weeks, but it will probably only be 1 update. After that I am free for a week though, so hopefully I'll be back on track then!
POV Ideas are still much welcomed, as are kudos and comments!
“Thanks, Nev.” Harry’s voice sounded a bit rough. Draco still had his head buried in Harry’s neck. Judging by his breathing, he was falling asleep. Neville had to force himself not to make a sound as Harry looked down at Draco like the man was the most precious thing he’d ever seen in the entire world. Sometimes he really wished his two friends could see the way they looked like to outsiders. He thought it would do wonders to erase their self doubt.
“Because you got today off!” Harry replied. “Your colleagues aren’t blind, or arseholes, they see how you’re running yourself into the ground, never missing a shift, always staying late, never saying no when someone asks you to cover for them. You
Draco quietly watched Harry’s face. His eyes were so green, so
“You’re both awful then,” Draco mumbled into Neville’s neck. “I don’t know why I put up with you two.”
he had to do, yet he couldn’t remember what it was. It was like cupping water with his bare hands. Try all you like, but in the end, it’s still going down the drain.
I’ve always been very careful not to reveal magic to Muggles - while living with my aunt and uncle it was impossible. My wand and school books were always locked away where I couldn’t get them (it’s a miracle I passed any classes). Although in second year, a house elf almost outed me as a wizard to my uncle’s boss - something I paid dearly for later, even though I’d had no idea that the house elf was there and when I did, I tried to stop him from using magic. I did have to use my Patronus in the summer between fourth and fifth year to save my cousin’s life (I might not have liked him, but he didn’t deserve a Dementor’s Kiss) and almost got expelled. I think I was lucky that he knew about magic and that there were no other Muggles around.
But the apology that had come with it was something Draco would not soon forget.
,” Draco pouted even as Harry pulled him closer and kissed his temple. “Also, this is really fucking stupid too.”
“My mother has a tendency to make people see sense.” A smile crept onto his face as he thought of the woman. “I’m glad she had the same effect on you. And it’s up to Scorpius, of course, but if you show you’re making changes then I can put this all behind me.”
I suppose that might be what made me so angry. After being at Hogwarts where everyone fought together during the battle, I think it shocked me that people weren’t willing to get involved. That and the fact that it could have easily been me who was being attacked. I’m bisexual and wouldn’t think twice about walking down the street with my partner, whether I was with a man or a woman. At least I wouldn’t have before this.
“I miss you too.” And damn it all to hell if Draco wasn’t tearing up again. “And I’d like that. Sharing a bed again.”
Draco sat down on the cold tiled floor once the door to the bathroom fell shut. It wasn’t a very private place to have a breakdown, but for now the place was empty and the cold of the walls helped keep him sane for the most part. He started counting the tiles between the floor and the sink, trying his best to distract his mind from everything else. It didn’t really help.
“Go tell him that, then.” Ron shoved him again, harder this time, with his elbow. “Don’t just sit here crying like some sorry Hufflepuff.”
had never been useful advice in the entire history of planet Earth. “I promise you they won’t bite.”
And with that, he slammed the door shut and stalked back to his old desk. Probably for the last time.
, while he apparently knew Harry owned this shop, judging by his reaction to his presence. But he knew better than to question someone as tired as Malfoy. Hermione would have bitten his head off before he’d opened his mouth.
.” Draco hissed, the pain of her words and fear that they were true burning in his chest. It was time to leave. He would leave the Burrow at the very least, and the life of this woman if it came to it. He would never allow his son to be among people who treated him like he was his father. They could spit on him for his many mistakes, but Scorpius deserved better than that.
“Too many bad memories?”
kill for his son if it came to it. “Your mother should have-”
“We don’t know for sure. He’s twitching, but we don’t know if that’s a good sign or not. The Healer has only been in there for a short while.” Hermione spoke like she was listing the financial details of her Ministry department instead of speaking about the fate of one of her best friends. That she found it necessary to detach herself from the situation like that, only made it more clear how serious it was.
at Potter, as the implications of his words began to sink in. “You… I don’t-,
, somehow, even though he didn’t actually feel anything. He was just afloat. Heavy and afloat, and nothing and something, and dark and light at the same time and it was driving him around a bend that wasn’t there because there was
That seemed to comfort Scorpius because he finally looked away from his knees. There was a bit of cake stuck to the corner of his mouth, and Draco almost reached out to brush it off until thinking the better of it. “There’s some cake stuck there,” he said instead, indicating the spot on his own face.
“I did.” Draco nodded. Instinct told him to act aloof around his old rival, but he threw that idea out the window and gave Harry a warm smile. “More than one, actually. I’m a part time nurse now, on the children’s oncology ward. We see all kinds of people there, and they inspire me to write. You can’t say a proper goodbye if you don’t understand what’s going on.”
get any help, Draco, and yet you’re still here. I’ve been lonely for a very long time in my life, but at least I knew that what I was doing was right. At least I began to gain friends when things went to shit. You didn’t. You were on your own and you still got through it and not a day goes by that I’m not stunned by that. And after all that fighting you’ve done on your own, it’s no shame to ask for help now. You’ve already done more than anyone should have ever asked of you, alright?”
A little further down the hall a door stood slightly ajar, showing a family room with Molly Weasley on a bed fast asleep. Just outside what Pansy believed to be Draco’s room, stood Granger, or Granger-Weasley nowadays. She stood frozen outside the door, staring through the glass window.
“I don’t know about touching, that’s a very personal question,” Luna mused. “He enjoys my hugs, but he never asks for them. He hasn’t been very brave for himself. Not since the war and the trials.”
“Nice is good, Draco.” Andy squeezed his hand again. “You deserve nice.”
“And not your responsibility, Harry.” Hermione’s eyes softened, though she still didn’t seem happy about the current topic of conversation.
“It’s something.” Harry sighed and lay his head back down on Draco’s chest, his ear positioned just above Draco’s heart. Usually the sound of that lulled Harry to sleep long before Draco closed his eyes. “Sometimes I wish I could beat everyone up who ever made you feel bad.”
“You keep saying that.”
It didn’t trigger another panic attack, but
Many thoughts whirled around his head as he tried and failed to fall asleep. He’d been too impulsive again, he should have called someone who actually knew Draco. Someone like Parkinson or his mother. Oh god what if they were worried sick? Would Robarts be petty enough to tell anyone who asked that Draco had gone missing, instead of that Harry had taken him home? And what if he did tell the truth and Parkinson thought it was another sixth year bathroom situation? What if it
He nodded, and looked around the waiting room. All three Potter kids were gone, but when he looked the other way, his stomach turned. None other than Mrs Weasley was looking after James, Albus and Lily. Unconsciously, he tightened his hold on Harry.
“I'm sorry.” Draco would have never guessed it but he turned into an apologetic Hufflepuff when he felt bad about himself. Especially when he was also tired to boot. “I shouldn't be talking about myself this much. And I shouldn't make you miss your kids. You have them to take care of already, I shouldn't add to that.”
She could see even through the window that the man had been crying. She’d been upset with him before, with his carelessness and stupidity, but realised now that there was no need to get angry with Harry. No one would be more angry or disappointed in Harry than he himself. Losing Draco would crush him just as much as it would her.
Lol nah nah, for real, thanks you guys for wanting to hear more, so, here u go!!!!
Now that he’s removed himself from Potter’s somewhat intoxicating personal space, it isn’t quite so hard. The sun does indeed brighten the green until they almost blend in with the white of his eyes, but Draco has since prepared for this. After all, there was a time when Draco’s entire life was devoted to loathing the man in front of him; in fact, he can see quite clearly the jutted crook of Potter’s nose, crested with a silvery scar, all in due to Draco’s foot. This is to say, he certainly should not be all at once struck incoherent by that very same, loathed person.
Tea and custody arrangements Draco can navigate, talking about the tailspin of his life with the savor of the wizarding world and former archenemy- he’d rather choke. But, he’s doing it, by Salazar, he is doing it.
“Well, would you like to come back to mine for tea? I can make toast.” Harry offers, and Draco must admit he is insanely curious to see Grimmauld Place. It is, to say the very least, a place of legend, and now it’s Harry Potter’s home, as well. This is where Teddy will be staying half the time, and Draco would be much more comfortable knowing just exactly what’s safe about it and what, inevitably, is not.
Hey guys, lmao, i know i'm updating this slowly, but to be fair, i used to be incapable of finishing fucking anything even oneshots so this fic is kind of a big deal to me, like, if i can finish this, i can write a novel, and i reallllly want to write a novel lmao
“I don’t know, Potter. You’re his godfather. You could take him from me permanently if you wished, and no one would fault you.” Draco tries and fails to conceal the crack in his voice. There’s nothing Draco wouldn’t do to keep Edward Lupin in his life, and the fear of losing him is all-encompassing. Though as used to that feeling as he is.
The strange moment comes to an end when the waitress returns, two large mugs of tea floating just behind her. With a practiced and thoughtless flick of her wand, the mugs ease gently onto the warped wooden tabletop. Draco whips his hands from his pockets at once and wraps his bony fingers around the green porcelain.
“No, we haven’t, I meant to tell you. Teddy should be hungry now.” Draco relents, shoving his hands into his robes, one of which wraps around the comforting weight of his wand.
Harry seems to have been watching him, surely to take note on Draco’s extraction of his godson, but the gaze feels heavy. The transfer of the love of Draco’s life to his former archenemy feels elephantine. The warmth of Teddy beating between them makes Draco’s insides swoop and twist, and as soon as Harry has Teddy completely in arms Draco takes a hearty step back. His head feels clouded, his skin prickly; he’s beyond overwhelmed.
Harry took it upon himself to tell his family (although not blood related) the rest. "There's more. She told us that once you kiss your soul mate, you have to marry them within 6 months or you both die."
They stayed silent as the gateway to Diagon Alley opened, and the two muggles and their daughter stood mesmerised at the sight of magic. They walked through, buying things for Daisy as they went - Harry paying for all of it, as he insisted because he has lots of money, and there would be no time to exchange muggle money.
"He broke your heart? You've broken his heart. He doesn't know what he's done to deserve this reaction from you." Mrs. Weasley's voice was much quieter this time. "What is it coming between the two of you?"
Harry looked to the others. "Do any of you know who it is?" Teddy and Ron both looked guilty but Mr. Weasley seemed even more confused than Harry.
"The part where is says that someone finding their soul mate only happens once in a thousand years." She sighed, looked at Harry and then looked deep into Luna's eyes. "Luna, you are my soul mate."
"Why wouldn't I?" Luna replied.
Hermione cleared her throat, which meant that both boys separated. They both blushed. "I thought you were just friends?" She smirked.
"She didn't say much. All she said was that she felt that something was coming between you." Hermione couldn't bare to look at Harry.
"Hermione."
"Yes, me and my two friends are the exception - and of course our soul mates." Harry kept getting cut off by random people wanting to say hello. "There was a prophecy that stated that the people who defeated Voldemort would find their soul mates."
"That's wise." She smiled at Harry.
Harry told them how to get onto Platform 9 and 3/4, before saying their goodbyes and returning home.
"We'll be there as soon as we can." Called Luna, and with that, Harry and Draco left.
"Of course." Draco saw the sadness on his soul mates face, but thought that it was a great idea anyway. "We should dress up - like muggles do."
"It will work out. Ron will forgive you and you will stay friends. It will take time, but I know that Ron would rather be just friends with you than not have you in his life at all." Harry didn't know where all this was coming from. No one had ever been this upset in front of him before.
I should have talked to you about it instead of just leaving. And, I would also like it if we could be friends.
"My favourite. Thanks, Luna."
"What do you want to talk to me about?" Harry asked.
Harry asked the question Hermione would forget to ask. "Do you want to come over for dinner tonight, at 7? Hermione wants you to come. And Draco will be there too."
"Good. He knows too." She conjured up a couple of chairs. "I'll go and get him." She then went off to find Harry, and Draco sat down ready for the conversation ahead.
Therefore, we would be delighted if you and your girlfriend, or wife (I don't know enough about your life right now), would join us for lunch tomorrow. Mum and Dad will be there, and I still have to tell them that their granddaughter is a witch.
"Good morning." Hermione looked down to see that Luna's face was suddenly very close to hers. "Err, I'm going to make tea." Hermione quickly got up, untangling herself from Luna. "Do you want some?"
Just then, Mrs. Weasley saw that her husband, Ron, Hermione and Teddy had been listening, and were now approaching them. Harry didn't acknowledge them because he was too interested in what Mrs. Weasley had to say.
Something in Harry's brain exploded and memories came to him that explained why Hermione thought this. His brain was putting all the pieces of the puzzle together now. "Huh. Kind of makes sense now I think about it." He chuckled at some of the things he was remembering. Hermione was a lot happier now, was interested by what Harry had said. "But hang on." He started talking again. "I thought that this only happened once in a thousand years, so how is it happening to both of us right now?"
"Harry doesn't know it yet, but he is in love with Draco Malfoy." She said, still avoiding looking into her mothers eyes.
"With me. I'll be going to teach at Hogwarts soon anyway."
"Can you wake Draco and Harry?" Luna nodded and Hermione continued to the kitchen. Hermione made the tea while thinking about Luna. Luna woke Harry and Draco, and all four of them prepared for the day and for their talk with Professor McGonagall.
Mrs Weasley didn't look surprised. She just smiled.
The next few days were exhausting for everyone. Harry had been thinking and thinking about how he would confront his soul mate, but he couldn't come up with a solution. Teddy was getting worried about his godfather and forced Harry to go to The Burrow again (it had been three days).
