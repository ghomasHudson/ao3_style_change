Draco had been eagerly awaiting dinner. He needed to talk to Harry. To clear his mind. Half an hour of staring at Harry’s empty seat in the dining hall had passed before Draco decided he needed to find him. Now. He hastily threw together a plate of Harry’s favorite foods and rushed to their common room.
“I haven’t seen you very much today. Fill me in. What did I miss? Spare no details!” Draco was enthusiastic, making large gestures with his hands and varying facial expressions as he spoke.
But he seemed to lose Harry anytime he saw him. Harry had slipped out of the Great Hall into the swarm of students after lunch, and it was practically pointless for Draco to look in there. Once, Draco had seen him after his Transfiguration class and ran to catch up with him, but he was pushed over and when he had finally regained his balance, Harry was gone. Then, almost giving up hope and just waiting to talk to Harry until after dinner in the common room, he saw Harry leaving his Charms class and grabbed him by the wrist.
, Harry. Tell
“Let me go”
Draco stayed in bed, wallowing in self-hatred and disgust - wondering how he could ever love himself if Harry didn’t, how he could ever be happy without Harry - for another six days before he finally got out of bed. It felt oddly refreshing to get out of bed, to get dressed, to walk to class. It was something so simple - yet so familiar, that it was easy to get lost and distracted. To forget the reality he was living in. But everywhere he went was filled with memories. The corridor where they kissed for the first time. The staircase that led to the astronomy tower where they first said they loved each other. The Great Hall where they accidentally let it slip that they were together and absolutely no one was surprised. Even the Forbidden Forest where he walked with Harry and Fang in his first year, not knowing the future he had with his mortal enemy.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Trust me, this is not how I wanted to tell you-”
“It’s not nothing! Harry - whatever’s going on, I’m here for you. Please. Tell me. I want you to feel like you can trust me. Whatever you’re going through, we can deal with it together.
“Draco, I don’t have time for this right now.” said Harry, visibly getting more and more annoyed by the second.
Evidently, this was a good enough answer for Pansy. “I get it. If you want to skip and raid the kitchen… I. Am. Down.”
Blatantly disregarding Draco’s abhorrence, his friends force him to continue playing Quidditch. At first, he was doing the bare minimum, but, after time, Quidditch became a safe-haven for him. When he was flying, that’s all he was doing. It was so simple. It was a great disparity in comparison to what’s been occupying his mind recently. He starts eating willingly, and even if it’s just a piece of fruit or a pack of crackers, it’s progress. He doesn’t know it, but his friends celebrated this. He was finally beginning to be himself again. Not long after, he starts going to Hogsmeade with his friends regularly, and they laugh, arms linked, walking through the snow, small clouds falling out of their mouths with each exhale. And Draco stands there, staring at his friends who care so, so much for him, wishing he could stay like this forever. And it finally feels like everything is going to be okay.
Draco goes to class but doesn’t pay any attention, and, in time, his teachers realize how useless it is to try to get his attention. His eyes are glazed over and he bumps into people in the hallways without a glance in their direction, like he doesn’t even know where or who he is. Even Quidditch becomes a burden. Eventually he stops crying. It’s not like he wanted to. He just doesn’t feel anything anymore. His whole body is filled with overwhelming numbness. He doesn’t think of Harry anymore. He doesn’t think of anything anymore. He can’t. His mind is just… empty. Draco knew in the back of his mind that he would get over this, he would move on. But it felt like that was impossible. He tries - he tries so hard - to feel happy. But he doesn’t even remember what that feels like and it seems like he’ll never feel it again. He wonders what the point of living is if he’s just existing. Surviving each day is an accomplishment in and of itself.
Draco laid in bed, wide awake - though incredibly tired, with his curtains drawn tightly shut for 3 days straight before he ate anything. It took his friends an immense amount of coaxing before Draco finally ate a bowl of soup (in which his friends added a drop of desperately necessary Sleeping Draught), and even then Draco’s compliance was accompanied by much reluctance. In the small moment that Draco was outside of his bed, he caught a glance of himself in the mirror. There were deep, grey bags underneath his eyes, which were incredibly bloodshot. And the most telling sign - his hair was unkempt. Horribly unkempt. Possibly worse than Harry’s. Harry’s beautiful, gorgeous, amazingly perfect, unkempt hair. His hair, his eyes, his mouth, god his
"Malfoy, stop!" - He wouldn't give up. He just had to explain it to him!
"Are you ready?" asked the black-haired Gryffindor, who held his wand in his hand, waiting. The blond sitting in the grass in front of him just grinned smugly.
"Guys! I found it!" he shouted immediately, and alarmed, the Ravenclaws ran to him. And indeed, Albus had found his father's Pensieve. At least, they suspected that it belonged to his father, who else could it belong to?
"Losing again?", Albus couldn't help but chuckle suppressedly.
"It can only be a permanent sticking charm. Think about it. With the rain and thunderstorm that raged here yesterday, it's impossible for this scarf-like ribbon to still be hanging here. Besides, I think it's been hanging here for a few years" - Rose held one of the ends in her hand again. - "Do you see the crests? They're opaque and already slightly faded. That's what happens when sunlight shines long and hard on fabric. It burns and the colors fade"
"Well, Harry Potter. HP are father's initials. And father was in Gryffindor" - With full force, Albus slapped his own forehead. Why hadn't he thought of that, then? He was such a dork!
"You guys are really smart. But I wouldn't have expected anything else. Unfortunately, I can't tell you anything about it. What might help you, however, would be Mr. Potter's secret Pensieve."-"The secret Pensieve?" asked Rose, not quite sure if she had the definition of a Pensieve right in her head. After all, how would Uncle Harry hide a Pensieve at Hogwarts? Or was it at his house? No, that would have been noticed, after all. And as the word 'secret' implied, no one seemed to know about it, except Dumbledore, for some reason.
02.01.2014
"Hello Albus," the old man greeted him and gave them a warm smile. Did it just seem that way to Albus, or had he just put extra emphasis on his first name?
"Don't worry about that one. It' s really nothing special" - "You say that every time, so I won't worry about it and then totally crap out anyway," Albus grumbled at Scorpius' words, which only made the latter grin. But not a normal grin. It was this very special grin that Albus immediately identified as the typical Malfoy grin. It had a hint of arrogance and Albus had to admit to himself, somehow it suited Scorpius, if not this Ravenclaw-blue one did.
The latter was just about to leave in a furious rage. He felt such unbridled rage inside him that his hands, clenched into fists, were already shaking. How could he be so stupid? How could he have gotten involved in something so stupid?
The three students, emerged from the bowl again and looked at each other. They were silent, trying to really comprehend what they had just seen.
"I- I was named after you" - "I know. Minerva had already informed me sufficiently about that. And who would have thought it. A Potter, befriended with a Malfoy. That I may still experience this" - Dumbledore still wore that warm and hearty smile on his lips and looked at the three young wizards in front of him.
So Albus decided to keep his mouth shut and wait until Malfoy was finally ready. The three of them walked towards the exit and made their way to the whipping willow. As they did so, Albus stifled any further comment about how this was clearly going too slowly for him. Somehow he had the feeling that Scorpius was doing this on purpose now, just to annoy him with it.
But no matter how much they hurried, they arrived at the castle completely soaked. There already stood janitor Filch and eyed them scowling, but said nothing.
And then, finally! Finally they had arrived. They stood with a good distance from the willow, that for now it had no reason to lunge.
Still, the blond didn't dare to move. He preferred to stand still and enjoyed the short but intense physical contact. Until Albus let go again.
"Why is that?" asked Rose right after, tilting her head.
They split up and searched the entire room for the Pensieve. Hours seemed to pass, during which they found nothing except some bits and pieces of junk and dusty furniture. Just when they had almost given up hope, Albus came across their sought-after object of desire.
Of course, after some time Albus had asked him if the rumors about his family were true and they were all confirmed to him. Even the fact that his father had been a real pain in the ass when he was at school. But Scorpius also stressed that it was for this very reason that his father had given him a very different upbringing than he had enjoyed. Draco Malfoy was convinced that his son could be a better wizard, a better person than he was.
That bold red with a hint of orange and that dark green that immediately made you think of the skin of a tree python.
"Thank you Professor" - Albus was grateful for the tip Dumbledore had given them and was about to set off to find the Room of Requirement as well.
"What makes you think this memory is from your father?" - Unlike Scorpius, Albus had no problem looking him in the eye. So he purposely looked for eye contact and finally found it when Scorpius squinted briefly in his direction.
"I know. I just hope we both survive this" - "We will ... Trust me, we will" - Draco kissed Harry on the lips. Gently and shyly. That was the last time they saw each other. The last thing they did and it was the last thing the three young students saw before the memory blurred. //
"Well, because our fathers aren't gay? I can't imagine my father ever having anything with a man. Besides, he always insists that mother has been the only woman for him"-"Like you said, Albus. The only woman. I can't imagine Uncle Harry having anything with a man either, yet we can't rule it out" - Rose was right. As unlikely as it sounded, they had to keep all their options open for now.
"What does that mean?" - It was more a question to himself than to his Ravenclaw friends, but Scorpius had understood him anyway and was willing to answer.
"They're not labeled. I'll just take any," Scorpius said, grabbing the nearest best vial from the cabinet.
"That's what I thought. He does look a lot like his father, but you can see that they couldn't be more different. He is like his father could never be."
It was strange. Albus had always imagined a Malfoy differently, especially after the stories of his uncle Ron, who always spoke badly of the Malfoy family. Which he could somehow understand. Because if what he had told them was true, then Scorpius' grandparents were devious Death Eaters. And his father? Albus was very conflicted about that. Somehow he felt slight disgust when he thought about what this man had done. And at the same time he had listened to his own father telling him how hard Draco Malfoy actually had it. And that such people only become what their parents make them. And Harry Potter had always been of the opinion that Draco Malfoy was basically not a bad person. Thinking back, Albus had never heard his father speak badly of the Malfoys, unlike his Uncle Ron, who liked nothing better than to badmouth that family.
"How do you know?" - Skeptically, Albus raised an eyebrow and looked at his friend. He knew, after all, that the knowledge of the Ravenclaws was immense, but this was really very specific, you didn't just know something like that.
"Let me do it," he said, taking out his wand as well. With a subtle wave of his hand and a "Wingardium Liviosa," he levitated a large stone that almost resembled a rock. He slowly directed it near the willow and held it still in the air. Albus was about to ask what exactly the Malfoy was doing, but immediately a thought dawned on him. He was looking for the right angle to throw the rock. Because here, too, the willow would fight back, so it had to be done quickly. And then it was done. Scorpius made a slight, lunging hand movement and the rock, landed on the root bulb. The willow was about to lash out with its whipping branches when it suddenly stopped in mid-motion.
"It's about my father and the whipping willow," Albus now joined the conversation again as well, following Rose, who in turn had followed McGonagall.
"Hey, if you need help with anything, let me know. I've been itching to find out what Dad did in his school days" - James laughed and went back to his friends. Albus believed him immediately. James liked nothing better than to rub their father's nose in the fact that he had also committed his sins as a student.
"Draco please, it's not what you think. Let me explain!" - "Save your fucking excuses! I just don't want to hear them anymore! I've had enough of you and your filthy lies once and for all! You do it every fucking time! You just can't keep your hands off her! Again and again you have to kiss her in front of my eyes, although you promised me not to! But you seem to be just playing! The hero of the Wizarding World can afford it, after all! Get back to your Weasley rat and lay her, I don't care, just leave me alone already!" - Draco had never yelled at him like that before, and Harry was almost afraid that someone might hear them, but luckily today was the first day of summer vacation and most, or rather just about everyone, was already at the track to board the Hogwarts Express. So they had to be the only ones here. Which didn't save him from being put down like that by the blond Slytherin.
"Tomorrow after class we'll go back to the whipping willow and then look into it!" - Determined, Albus nodded and stood up, now heading to his own common room.
"You know I love you, don't you?" asked Harry after a while, looking into Draco's eyes. Into those stormy gray eyes that almost took his breath away and made the world stop for a brief moment. Just for a moment, there was no war, there was nothing around them.
"Well, the ribbon around the whipping willow. There's something about it. I know it" - "Typical Albus. And how are you going to get to the willow? It' ll chase you right away, like it did before" - Rose had a serious tone about her, as she always did when Albus was just being silly again. And these were definitely some. Because to expose oneself to such danger for no reason was, after all, insane.
"I think we should ask the portrait of the old Headmaster. You know, Dumbledore. The guy knows absolutely everything, from what I've gathered," Scorpius suggested. Yes, that would be one of the most logical things they could do. Dumbledore was a man who knew just about everything. Even they knew that, though Dumbledore had been principal far before their time. What a difference narratives could make.
"So it's true. They loved each other," was the first thing Rose said when they emerged from the Pensieve again. But it was also the only thing that was said, as neither boy dared to say anything. They were much too absorbed by the information they had just received. It was all more than confusing. They had just learned that their fathers had been a couple in their school days. Why weren't they now? That seemed to be the next big mystery for Albus.
// They were in the corridors of Hogwarts. Everything was gray and the school seemed empty. Then, however, they could see young Draco Malfoy turning the corner. He was maybe 16 in this memory possibly 17, they couldn't tell for sure. But Scorpius was struck by how similar he really looked to his father. Actually, confusingly similar.
"Albus don't! If you get too close to it, it'll-" Rose was still trying to warn the young Gryffindor, but by then it was too late. A whip of the willow, came crashing toward Albus, flinging him several feet away from it.
"I can understand your anger, but will you stop talking about Ginny like that? It's not her fault!", Harry defended the red-haired girl, not knowing that he had made probably the biggest mistake he could have made. Malfoy looked him in the eye, even more hurt, and that was exactly the moment when the otherwise so controlled Malfoy, finally lost his patience.
"Malfoy!" he suddenly heard a voice behind him. A voice he would recognize among thousands. But without looking at the caller, he kept walking. He paid no attention to him and merely tried to disappear as quickly as possible.
But he wouldn't do that today. Nor tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. For now, he needed to get away from this, to calm down and get a clear head before he plunged into this tangle of feelings again. And now he tried to sleep, like the hours before. Unfortunately in vain.
Briefly, they examined the large, shallow stone bowl, and Scorpius promptly found the hidden compartment embedded in the stone bowl's base. Inside were memories.
"Uh- A room?" - Now it was Scorpius' turn to laugh at that. But quickly he put his hand over his mouth and tried to suppress it. After all, it wasn't fair. After all, he himself didn't know what the Room of Requirement was either, yet it was just hilarious how lost Albus looked and how obviously he had no idea.
"I'm just not as fast as you, Albus!" the young girl with the striking Weasley red hair reprimanded him. She propped her hands on her knees, panting, and tried to catch her breath properly again. She had to admit to herself, sports wasn't really her thing. The brain stuff suited her a lot better.
"That guy still gives me the creeps," Rose whispered to the Gryffindor and climbed the stairs to go to their common room. They walked together into the highest tower at Hogwarts and then stopped in front of a painting. Already out of habit, Albus covered his ears and waited until the password was spoken and the painting swung open to the side. It finally did, revealing the Ravenclaw common room to them. Because nothing else was Rose. Unlike her entire family, she didn't go to Gryffindor. And still she didn't know if that should make her sad, because actually she was very happy in Ravenclaw. She wasn't the nerd here, but a normal girl who just had a very high IQ. And the talking hat had also given her a good talking to back then.
"An eagle" - Scorpius looked into the fireplace and the hot flames reflected in his stormy gray eyes. They danced in his bright vision and disappeared when Scorpius closed his eyes.
One couldn't deny that from time to time the typical Slytherin traits shone through, but that wasn't a bad thing. That was exactly what made Scorpius charm somehow.
"Yes" - Sometimes the blond was really taciturn.
"Albus!" was all Rose could say in reply. And she knew it would do no good to waste her breath screaming any longer. Albus was very knowledgeable about Defense Against the Dark Arts. Like his father, he was -of course with Rose- one of the best in their class. It was his thing, and no one could fool him. Of course, it also meant that Albus had to try out every new spell he learned. And this time, Albus had chosen the whipping willow as his training ground. It was located at the edge of the forbidden forest and thus far enough away from the castle to be undisturbed.
"What do you want Albus?" - Now James turned to his brother and looked at him, waiting. It was immediately clear to him that the younger boy wanted something from him. It was always like this. His little brother always wanted something.
"Can I help you in any way?" they heard the voice of an old lady, who was dressed in a black robe and was now looking down at them with her head tilted.
With that, Rose had agreed and had walked over to the Ravenclaw table with a smile. And yes, it was true. She was in no way inferior to Albus when it came to courage, but the war was over. There was no reason for her to go to Gryffindor, and she was very much at home in Ravenclaw. Albus had been sad not to be in the same house with his best friend, but that didn't stop them from spending every free minute together.  And luckily, Albus was allowed to stay in the Ravenclaws' common room.
Harry shrugged. “I don’t know,” he said, achingly honest. “I just do.”
Harry was shaking his head now, partly in disbelief. He obviously couldn’t wrap his brain around the fact that Draco simply couldn’t apparate.
Draco shook himself out of his reveries and watched the words on the screen—the credits, he believed they were called. But he could feel Harry's eyes on him, so he turned to face him.
"Fuck off. I'm allowed to be sentimental with my pet."
"Dunno." Draco sounded thoughtful. "Not sure if it's a New York thing in particular or an American thing in general."
“Dunno. I’ve thought about teaching. I think that’s something I’m good at, judging by my time running Dumbledore’s Army. But . . . .” He let his voice trail off.
Draco went on for a full five minutes, his voice more and more enthusiastic. Harry didn’t understand the half of it, but he loved seeing Draco like this.
The little furball gave what could pass for a nod and then performed a complex ferret-tumble off the bed. He engaged in more impressive acrobatics as Harry got up and walked over to the wardrobe. By the time Harry changed—he found joggers that almost fit and a touristy I 'heart' New York tee—Draco was scaling a bookcase.
"Oh, I don't know, Potter. How can you possibly be so bourgeois about this?"
"HP?" he asked himself again, scratching his head somewhat indecisively. This was getting weird.
"You did it!" cheered Albus, falling around Scorpius' neck. The latter was more than caught off guard. After all, he couldn't really do much with that kind of physical contact. It was unusual to be hugged. The only person who did that was his father. Not even his mother could really warm up to such things. Especially not since he had brought such shame on the Malfoy family and had come to Ravenclaw. But somehow it also did him good. It was a closeness that he was rarely allowed to experience in this form.
"DM," Scorpius repeated, holding out the back of the end he was holding to the Gryffindor.
"In a Pensieve, you can follow what is happening as an objective observer, but you always accompany the person from whom the memory came. If this memory were from your father, we wouldn't have seen my father hurt his hand on the wall." - How he hurt his hand on the wall was still a very nice euphemism for what they had seen. Rose was sure that she had never seen anyone hit a stone wall so hard, and it definitely took a lot of emotion to unthinkingly and with such force expose his hand to such damage. Because she was sure that the purple swollen ring finger was definitely broken.
"Maybe those are initials," Rose mused, putting on her infamous thinker look. She always looked like that when she was thinking quite hard about something, and she actually pretty much always came up with an answer.
"Let's look at another memory," was all Albus had to say about it. He couldn't wait to learn more about his father and his relationship with Draco Malfoy. This thing was getting more and more twisted and by now he wondered if his father was really happy with his mother. He had never seen even a hint of doubt in his eyes when Harry Potter looked at his wife. Albus had always been under the impression that his parents had a picture-perfect marriage. But slowly, his entire worldview began to falter.
"What do you think, Potter?" was enough for Harry to answer, and he received his wand towards the ground, pointing it at an indefinable pile of cloth. The Gryffindor muttered something to himself, which was not even understandable to the blond man in front of him, who was sitting quite close to Harry after all. But what else had he expected? It was Harry Potter, after all. When it came to spells, he handled them as neatly as he handled his hair.
"No, why? Is there something there?" so James asked the counter question. Now he was curious, he knew Albus. If it didn't mean anything, he wouldn't have asked him. So there had to be something about it.
Without thinking about it, he took out his fist and tried to hit the Gryffindor with all the force he could muster. But Harry fortunately had good reflexes and was just able to stop his rival's fist. With surprise he could see bloody spots on his knuckles and his ring finger was already purple. It had to be from hitting the wall.
"Hopefully this one has something to do with the tree. Because if not, I guess we'll just have to look at all the memories until we find something," Rose said, reminding the boys again what they were here for in the first place. They wanted to find out what the tape around the whomping willow was all about. But slowly they felt that they were losing sight of their goal. So many new chasms had opened up that they were no longer sure what to think of their own fathers, their families. Had it all been a lie? Could it really be that their fathers felt so much for each other and no one had ever noticed? Why? Why weren't they together if they seemed to love each other? Or had once done so?
"You got it," Albus said resignedly, pouting. Still, he couldn't help being curious.
But he didn't have time for that. While Albus was staring up at the sky, it began to rain like cats and dogs. With a quick "Let's get out of here," he got up and dragged Rose along with him. If the girl caught a cold here, though, her father would whistle at him for letting that happen as her best friend. Even if Rose didn't need to be protected, because she was quite capable of protecting herself, his father seemed to demand it of him. As a best friend. So let's get out of here.
He quickly ran to the Gryffindors' common room, gave the password and waited impatiently until the fat lady could finally bring herself to open the door. It was an act with her every time, almost bringing Albus to the edge of his temper. This woman really needed company!
"It's too late now anyway. Besides, I don't think I'll be able to use it in the war."- With these words, a depressing silence fell over them, preventing the previously exuberant mood from continuing.
"All right, if that's really true, then we can rule out a love oath right away" - It all seemed very plausible to Albus, now they just had to figure out what it was hanging there for.
And that he was more than proud of his son was proven by his reaction to Scorpius' house assignment. While Astoria was furious cursing and saying again and again that they should have sent him to Durmstrang, Draco was silent. All he did was hug his son. Never in his life had Draco been more relieved than at that moment and it showed him that his son was not like him. He was not a bad person.
"It is time for changes. We shouldn't hold on to old habits. And you are the perfect first step. You are different from your ancestors."
"And have you tried it out? Do you know what's wrong with the ribbon?" asked Albus excitedly at once, his eyes shining with delight. There was nothing the young Gryffindor liked better than uncovering secrets. After all, the apple didn't fall far from the tree.
"Just because you can't control yourself anymore doesn't mean I'm going to rush here. So keep it down, Potter" - Uh oh! Albus had probably tugged a little too hard on the Malfoy's nerves, even the Gryffindor understood that now. Because the blond Ravenclaw only called his friend by his last name when he was slowly losing patience. And who would have thought it, that happened to him with Albus often and especially regularly. Of course, this could also be due to the fact that Scorpius was already by nature, not a particularly patient person.
"Please Draco, stop!" he shouted repeatedly, hoping that the man he was addressing would finally respond, which he finally did. Full of rage, he turned around. Anger at himself, anger at his stupidity, at his naivety, but most of all with anger at Harry Potter and his impudence in still calling him by his first name after all this!
"Well, if you say so," was all Scorpius replied. He would be careful not to tell Albus that he had a very good idea about it. After all, he had already managed the Patronus spell, but he would keep that to himself for now. Because the way Albus had entered the common room - without cheers and beaming smiles - he hadn't managed it yet. But the Gryffindor didn't seem to be fooled that easily. For instantly a hard blow hit him in the upper arm.
"Of the first day at Hogwarts. The moment the talking hat brought me to Gryffindor. But I guess that wasn't enough" - Albus looked at his wand depressedly. Yet he had been so sure that it would work. It was his happiest memory. Especially because he had been so afraid of coming to Slytherin before. But what had he expected? At thirteen, it wasn't easy to already be able to define what the happiest moment was. His life was still far too short for that, and unlike his father's memories when he was his age, Albus' memories seemed insignificant. How could he even expect it to work the first time?
Full of rage and shame, he stopped and knew nothing more to do with himself. That was simply too much! Now it was enough for him finally! With all the strength he had, he hit with his fist against the stone wall. That he could break some fingers, he did not pay attention to this rash act. He just wanted to get rid of his frustration and not feel like a betrayed idiot anymore.
"You didn't dare!" laughed Albus, which made Scorpius blush. Of course, he would never admit that he hadn't had the courage to try it, so he kept quiet. But Albus had immediately realized that he was in the right.
"It won't come off" - "What do you mean, it won't come off?" asked Scorpius, now also reaching for the ribbon. To test it, he gave it a quick tug and came to the same conclusion.
"Hey Scorpius, did you ever notice that there's a ribbon tied around the whipping willow?" - Albus raised his head again and looked beside him. Scorpius again didn't look up from his book as he answered.
"I'll have to check that out," Albus said already, walking on towards the willow as if pushed by some instinct.
"What is it?" - He just had to ask. It burned his fingers to find out what shape his Patronus would take.
"You're right. Let's go knock, then" - No sooner said than done. Albus knocked on the massive, gold-trimmed door and waited for it to burst open. He had never been in the Headmaster's office before, so he was all the more amazed when the door slid aside to reveal a large spiral staircase. Hesitantly, Albus looked at his friends, who nodded affirmatively. The three of them climbed the first steps, when the spiral staircase suddenly started moving by itself. With great difficulty, the three students managed not to topple over and arrived safely at the principal's office.
"Good luck," was all Dumbledore said and the three students made their way back outside.
"No. Why should I" - Scorpius shook his head briefly and then looked to the side, just not in Albus' direction. This, of course, caught his eye immediately and the Potter grinned.
"And how do we do that now?" asked Albus, looking very closely at this willow. So first they had to find the right root bulb. Only how would they know which one it was?
"Albus, do you even know what the Room of Requirement is anyway?" so Rose asked him, having to stifle a laugh. Of course he didn't know, or he wouldn't be imagining it so easily.
"I think someone did notice. But they had the same problem you had in the beginning. How were they going to get it? But maybe no one has had the same interest in finding out as you have. Besides, this place is not very crowded. It is on the edge of the forbidden forest and we are still forbidden to enter it. I think the students prefer to stay by the lake, rather than by the whipping willow, which could lash out at any moment" - That was a plausible explanation Rose had given, Albus could see that. But there was no point in staying here any longer, they had their information now and had to look in other places to find more. Someone must know something about this ribbon, after all.
"Doubt it. The Baumgartens are a step up, I reckon.”
Ron had made a half-hearted attempt to toss Draco out on his furry white arse, but . . . all right. He was adorable, and Ron was too tired to chase him around the room. So Draco stayed.
The wizarding world seemed painfully behind the muggles when it came to therapy; that had become obvious for everyone in the aftermath of the war. At least they were finally starting to take the muggle disciplines of psychology and psychiatry seriously.
“He told me so.”
She curtsied again. “I was presented to Master Draco on the occasion of his seventeenth birthday.” She seemed proud of that fact. “Now Master Draco is explaining about the life debt, and how everything that belongs to Master Draco now belongs to Harry Potter. So now I am serving here.”
Draco huffed out a sigh. “Well, for what it’s worth, I’m glad you decided to return to us.”
Ron regretted his tone as soon as the words were out of his mouth. He hadn’t meant that to sound so much like a command. For all his new-found subservience, Draco still had some of his Malfoy pride and sense of superiority left.
“I’m sorry, Harry.” Hermione was sitting next to him on the couch, whispering. “I shouldn’t have brought Bill and George over without your permission, but there was no talking them out of it—”
But Draco ignored him as he continued. “Close your eyes, Harry. There’s a memory of mine hidden right in this room. You need to centre yourself so you can find it.”
“It’s more out of habit than malice now—”
“Potter, these neo-Death Eater cells don't all talk to each other. And none of them know that I'm an animagus—”
Ron hadn’t kicked him out of their bedroom last night, then. Harry felt weirdly happy about that. It was sort of cute, picturing Draco-in-ferret-form curled up with his two best friends.
"We've got a different sort of relationship, that's all." He put a hand on Harry's cheek. Slowly, as if he were the shy one now.
"That goes without saying in my family."
"Love it. It's muggle, isn't it? I didn't think your parents would have something like this."
Potter turned an even brighter red, but his voice was frighteningly calm. “As I said, he’s better off under my authority than yours. I won't teach Draco to despise muggles and muggle-borns or anyone else you and your friends deem inferior. I won't indoctrinate him or force him to join a murdering gang of wizard supremacists.”
“Noa is a feminine name in Hebrew,” Bill explained. “Noach”—he pronounced it with a harsh sound at the end—“is masculine.”
“Someone like the Dalai Lama?”
"You're not like him."
The problem began last night, really. Draco was right where Harry guessed he would be: curled up in bed with Hermione. In his animagus form, of course—but that wasn’t what Ron meant when he’d ordered the spiteful git to bed. But Hermione, despite her reluctance to treat Draco as a pet, had found him irresistible.
“Mr. Potter?”
They were standing in Harry’s sitting room, all four of them. Harry had greeted Ron and Hermione just like this, holding the ferret’s hand, before launching into a speech about how he and Draco were together now.
A few minutes later, the laptop was safely stowed away again. Draco shut his mouth as he and Harry climbed the first flight of the elaborate and rather gruesome staircase. And he kept it shut as they entered the sitting room.
Weasley gave him a startled and delighted laugh. “You make a good ferret, Malfoy.”
"What's wrong?" He knew his mother kept the muggle device only for emergencies.
“I still think this is a terrible idea, Draco.”
Bill remembered hearing about this: the Slytherins had a lost a match against Gryffindor, but Draco made up for that by cruel remarks about the Weasley family and their mum. Harry and George were both stupid enough to take the bait. Fred too, if memory served.
“Well, Draco?” Harry asked.
Draco apparently had no interest in what he really thought, because he interrupted by lunging at Harry and snapping the air perilously close to his arm.
Meanwhile, though, Ron rather liked giving Draco orders, even if that made him a bit of a bastard. And that made Harry a bit of a bastard too, didn’t it, considering how much he liked having Draco obey him. But Harry was entitled. Besides, Harry lived up to his part of the bargain: he was determined to protect Draco and his family. And he was determined to build a happy life for himself and Draco. It was a fair deal.
She grinned. "Something tells me Draco wouldn't approve."
Harry nodded, trying to convey a bit of gratitude, and looked around. This room, stone floor and all, appeared to be an old-fashioned kitchen, with pots and kettles and such hanging directly over the massive fireplace. It was rather like the kitchen in Hogwarts, only much smaller. But it was . . . tense, somehow. Like the room itself was waiting for something to happen.
He blushed. “Ah, no. Not really. Most of my experience came through my, er, connection with Voldemort.”
“What are you thinking?” Draco nudged closer to him.
"But it's all arranged. They'll have someone meet me and take me to the hotel—"
Draco followed suit. “What’s wrong?”
“Dunno about that. I certainly lack the reckless courage of you Gryffindors.” He paused to narrow his eyes again. “But I’ll be brave enough to ask this: why have you kept this secret? To protect Dumbledore’s reputation?”
His pale face reddened just a bit. “I apologise. But if I’d really meant to hurt you—”
Hermione frowned at Draco. "Who owns Malfoy Manor now?"
“—and you sound as if you’re getting attached to him.”
"Well, you ought to get some rest, Ferret—he wouldn't go to sleep, Harry, until he heard from you."
“What are you willing to offer me?”
“They’re on the floor over there.”
“I expect you to make this up to me,” Draco announced.
“So this thing you have with Harry—the life debt, the, uh, relationship . . . all of it—it’s all real?”
Harry sighed. "No. They have to talk sometime."
Harry didn’t bother to fight him. He knew he wouldn’t fight him over the clothes either; it was easier (and probably more effective in the long run) to just let Draco play the part of his personal shopper and valet combined. But he sighed a little as he grabbed a towel. He was still the one in charge, he told himself. He was just learning to pick his battles.
“No.” Draco bit back another smile before he continued. “Severus Snape was a master of occlumency, though. To have studied under him—Harry, you should be an expert!”
Harry gave him a look.
“No, stay, Weasley. Both of you.” Draco took a deep breath of his own. “I have some conditions for Potter, assuming he's serious. And I want witnesses.”
Bill decided it was time to speak up. “You didn’t have much choice about that, did you?”
But, as it turned out, he had underestimated Potter. And wasn't that the story of his life?
“Draco, you’re brilliant at occlumency. And as for legilimency, I’m—”
"Good. That's . . . really good."
"Um, yeah." Harry put a hand on Draco's back and guided him toward the queue. "So you know who Jane Austen is?"
“Seriously Potter? You don’t think it’d be a bit awkward to discuss what we need to in the middle of services?”
Hermione felt a stab of pity as she watched Harry’s reaction. Somehow he looked hurt, apologetic and resigned all at once. And then she noticed something else in his expression: the painful decision not to confide in Hagrid.
“What did you three talk about?” Harry looked genuinely curious.
“Hermione, do you want me to say no?”
"Can't. My father volunteered to drive Draco to Heathrow himself and pick up the girls with him. Said he'd like a chat with Draco on the way there. Just the two of them."
“Really, Hermione?” He rolled his eyes. “You think I'd beat my boyfriend? Or hex him?”
Potter didn't even blink at that epithet, or the sarcastic tone. "We do need to talk with him. Come on, Malfoy. The wards won't let you apparate in or out of here alone, but I can take us."
She ignored the correction. “I do hope the ceremony will be in New York? Wasn’t there some talk of holding it in Tel Aviv?”
Harry wrapped an arm around him. “You really didn't contact them?”
Fuck. Draco hated to lose. It was arguably even worse to keep losing to Ronald Weasley—some part of Draco wondered, ironically, what his father would have to say about that. But even Lucius Malfoy couldn’t deny the man’s reputation as a brilliant player.
“No, you wanted to hurt me. Are you testing me, Malfoy? Want to see how far you can push me?”
“But he stood trial,” Hermione said. “And then he was blackmailed into serving as a spy for the aurors. I believe he’s paid his debt to society.”
Harry sighed. “I’m not trying to change who you are. Not at base.”
But Draco could hardly discuss apparating with a muggle, could he? No, he needed a qualified therapist with some connection to the wizarding world. A muggle-born, perhaps? Or maybe some muggle with a wizard or witch for a family member?
“Your bedroom at the manor wasn’t rococo, was it?”
Harry hesitated. “Not exactly. I'm sort of playing this by ear.”
Harry could think of any number of reasons. Draco might not want to share a house with his former nemesis. He might already have a flat of his own somewhere. Or . . . well, he’d grown up here at Malfoy Manor. He was probably attached to the grounds, the mansion, and this perfect, soothing room.
“Yes, but don’t let it go to your head.” He paused, furrowing his brow. “I don’t mean it in a religious sense.”
"You would do what?"
"Leave it be, Potter. You're two up. Three, if you count the fact that your testimony kept my mother out of Azkaban too."
“Are we starting?”
He looked around for a place to sit. Unfortunately, most of the furniture here was designed for house elves, so he took a seat on the floor instead.
Granger stayed up a bit later with Shira and Jamie, who were introducing her to the music of Emelie Autumn. Familiar strains of violins and a harpsichord wafted upstairs, sounding eerily appropriate in Grimmauld Place.
“Yes, sir.” Draco took his hand and shook it, his expression respectful and overly deferential. “I stayed with one of the Baumgartens and her girlfriend in Hoboken, right outside the city.”
“Of course not. The catacombs are too well known; one really can’t hide anything in there.” He paused to chew on his lip. “You could fit catacombs here, though it would take a great deal of advanced structural magic—”
Fuck, fuck, fuck. More Weasleys.
"Not really, no." Better to be honest. "I need time to think this through."
“No. I think she's trying to find the correct balance. Umbridge was one extreme, but Dumbledore was, er, perhaps too hands off.”
“Conditionally.” Ron shrugged. “He did dangerous work for the aurors. Not by choice, but it still counts for something.”
"I'm loving it now."
“Oh, don't mistake me. He was all kindness and politeness. Even when I reminded him of my father.”
Fuck, fuck, fuck. He had hardly known Dobby when his family still owned him, but of course he knew all about his fatal wound at Malfoy Manor. And Dobby was featured in all the histories of the war: a free elf, Harry’s loyal friend, and so on. One more person—being?—who had made all the right choices whilst Draco had made all the wrong ones.
Draco stared at both of them. They actually felt guilty about this.
“Yeah.”
“What? No, of course not.” Harry shook his head as he absently stroked Draco’s back. “He's an animagus now. And he's been undercover for the Ministry for—I don't even know how long. And Robards left him to die.”
“I didn’t call it in,” Harry spat. “Draco and I came to an agreement, that’s all. An agreement that’s not magically or legally binding on either of us. It’s just—it works for us. And it lets us sort a few things together.”
Not that Arthur himself was particularly religious. He wasn't, as far as Harry knew. But he respected people who were, and he found the actual practise of religion intriguing, especially as it concerned muggles.
"You came back, in the end, for Goyle and me. Doesn't matter why. And I was a . . . a little shit to both of you for years, wasn't I?"
“I can only hope not,” said a slightly wry, slightly faltering voice.
And then his brain must have relaxed properly, because he felt the tug of a memory. A cracked mirror. A smashed cistern. Shame. Anger. Terror. A water-logged floor . . . .
“That’s her, isn’t it?” He pointed to the muggle photo hanging on the wall.
He wanted to ask her what she meant by that, but stopped himself. She was right; Draco was more content than blissfully happy. But who was blissfully happy after the war? They all had baggage. They all had trauma.
Draco leaned over toward Harry. “What about my father? And Malfoy Manor?"
Merlin, had the poor elf run up all those steps? He was too old for that. “Sorry, Kreacher. Where’s Draco?”
That took Draco completely by surprise. For a couple of seconds he didn’t seem to know what to say. But then he managed a tight, sour smile. “Fuck off, Potter. But yeah. That’s exactly it.”
“Draco, I just . . . .” He let the words trail off as he pushed himself up.
Hermione seemed to chew on her words before speaking them. “Hagrid's much better now that McGonagall requires all Hogwarts professors to submit their lesson plans.”
George and Bill exchanged glances at that; Harry caught them out of the corner of his eye. Neither saw fit to comment, though.
But that didn’t mean he was happy about it. “Fuck. Voldemort saw this memory? That’s how he found your first password?”
“Mr. Potter,” she persisted, her voice still stronger than the other journalists who were vying for his attention, “do you feel that everyone you’ve rescued in the line of duty owes you a life debt?”
Hermione merely rolled her eyes. “I think you ought to run that by Angelina first.”
“I know you’re not my fucking therapist, Potter. I’m not going to discuss this with you.”
But Draco wasn’t paying him any attention. “I still remember coming across you right before a match. You must have been running late, but somehow you made time to harass me. You asked me where I was going as if it were your business. As if I owed you an answer.”
"And you'll come with me, as my plus one, so you can meet her and maybe understand a little better."
“I didn’t say the memory happened here, Potter. Just that I’ve hidden it here. Pay attention!” Harry could sense him rolling his eyes. “Fuck, no wonder Snape couldn’t teach you anything.”
"Yes." Harry didn't bother disguising his relief. "Let's."
Harry sighed and put his head back on Draco’s shoulder. “True. What about you—what’s your calling?”
Harry’s mind was racing now. Draco having a muggle for a mate—all right, Harry could see that, given how many of his prejudices he’d shed. But going to a muggle for advice? Harry was dumbfounded.
Draco moved over.
“Harry,” Draco spoke slowly now. “If everything had played out how it was supposed to, I’d have died in that explosion. I wouldn’t be alive to worry about anything else.”
"Wait, you've actually done the maths?" Potter looked astonished.
before. Everything that had gone wrong in his life, Harry was pretty sure had gone wrong because of other people’s desperate desire for more power. The thirst and the half-demented drive to accrue more power and learn how to hoard it. He heard the word ‘power’ and Harry’s stomach dropped and twisted, blood rushing to his ears. He felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up and when he looked at the Malfoys he could see they were regarding him with almost identical expressions.
“Right!” Hermione said the next morning, plopping down across from Harry at the table. He blinked at her blearily, barely awake, while Hermione looked like she’d been up for hours. Her hair was still wrapped up in silk and she was still in pyjamas but her eyes were bright with the kind of fevered light that Harry remembered from her obsessive nights spent trawling through the library at Hogwarts whenever she needed to know something. She grinned at Harry, who decided that his best course of action was going to be to continue to eat his eggs.
“That’s what it looked like to me.” Malfoy shrugged. “It doesn’t matter to me if you’re brooding, Potter, but if you want it to have it’s full impact, shall I call the
Harry nodded, humming a little in the back of his throat. He knew he wasn’t stupid, no matter what the niggling voice in the back of his head said. He wasn’t stupid but he was definitely better at practical work, at seeing things done and then replicating them. Staring at books when he wasn’t sure what half the words meant wasn’t going to help Hermione.
Harry had left soon after.  Malfoy had still been asleep and when he had quietly cast a spell to see what time it was he knew that there was no hope Malfoy would be up soon. It wasn’t even eight when Harry padded carefully down the corridors heading to the front door. It wasn’t even eight when he rounded a corner and Narcissa was walking towards him.
“It is, isn’t it?” Harry said, instead of arguing. Then he moved forward slowly, as if pushing gently into a body of water. The cool air nipped at him. Malfoy’s coat whipped around them as the wind picked up. Harry’s mouth covered Malfoy’s and he kissed him, soft and gentle as a feather.
plain to see when he was told what was going to happen to him: probation. House arrest. A suspended sentence. Malfoy dropped his face into his hands, hair falling forward, and took several huge breaths. His shoulders didn’t shake but it looked like he was struggling not to cry. Harry averted his eyes.
Lavender blinked in surprise. She moved and the scarf moved down. Harry barely saw the glimpse of ruined skin and then she was fixing it with quick fingers. “You want my advice?”
Harry watched the door for a moment, trying to work out what was happening in his chest, why his breath was short, why he wanted to claw at his skin and chase after Malfoy all at once. He did neither. Instead, he took his own deep breath and then finished undressing before stepping in under the hot spray of the shower. He turned his face up to it, letting the spray hit his chest.  The water beat down, a constant rhythm, and Harry lost himself in it. He let his eyes unfocus and let the thoughts he’d been repressing all day bubble up. The water washed away the grime and Harry watched it swirl down the drain with unseeing eyes, focusing instead on memories: his parents, swirling out from Voldemort’s wand; every memory of them he’d ever encountered; every picture he’d seen, from the moment Hagrid had pressed the album into his hands; the graves he had visited last year; their faces when he went to the forest, when he’d met them and thought about death.
. Once or twice, Narcissa shouted up at them and Draco would laugh down and try to soothe her and Harry would point his broom straight up and fly as high as he could.
“Has Malfoy dosed you with something maybe?” Ron asked that night, dumping a lot of pasta into a pot of boiling water. He considered the pot and then added more.
The ‘now’ was important. Harry wouldn’t forget who he had been. He couldn’t forget what he had done. Harry looked down at the ground and then at Ron, who watched him with a careful, assessing gaze.
He didn’t know what it was. Malfoy didn’t seem interested in talking about it particularly and Harry had always hated how words eluded him, how his motives and reasonings never seemed to hold up once he gave voice to them. He didn’t know what it was about him that was so fundamentally flawed that he could never communicate how he wanted to but Malfoy didn’t seem to care. Harry would appear and they would find something to do.
Harry squeezed Hermione’s hand and tried to reassure her that everything was going to be okay and he was proud of himself too and proud of her and that it was really much too early to be crying. It took a few minutes: Hermione’s emotions seemed closer to the surface now than they had before. Harry supposed that was what happened when your parents didn’t remember you properly, when months of spellwork had brought back only brief memories that seemed to scare them. Hermione had taken a few weeks to fill Ron and Harry in on everything that had happened when she was in Australia but Harry already knew he would never forget the tone of voice that she has used, the fear and the self-loathing bubbling under her words. He had tried to wrest it away and he knew Ron had, had heard some murmured conversations that he had pointedly tried not to listen to. It had left Hermione raw and a little overexposed; she cried easily now.
When he emerged, clutching a bottle of white wine, Ron was sitting at the table, boots kicked off by the back door, and Hermione had taken the chair beside him. They both cheered as Harry lifted the glasses in front of them and started to pour.
His first week flew in. Harry felt weariness tugging at him throughout, but he was just glad that he was enjoying it, glad that Patrick seemed to have taken a liking to him and had Harry in as many of his appointments as he could. They had gone out to a local farm only yesterday and when Harry landed home he had chattered Ron and Hermione’s ear off about. Then, he’d chattered Lavender’s ear off about it over breakfast. Once it reached eleven a.m. and it was late enough that it was probably acceptable to go to the Malfoy’s, Harry left to chatter their ear off about it.
As Harry had suspected, Ron did love the cupcakes. Not only did he love them, he professed a deep infatuation with them. His favourite was the mint and pistachio one which he shoved into his face with such fervour that it was almost admirable. Harry stood, shoulder-to-shoulder with Hermione, watching the proceedings with a kind of rapt fascination he suspected they should have divulged of long ago when it came to Ron and his appetite.
talked about this.”
He liked her manner, brusque and straightforward and incredibly unflinching. She told him more than once that the werewolf bite had probably helped in that regard. She told him things that made him miss Remus with a deep ache that sometimes felt bittersweet. Harry would wish desperately that Remus was still there, that he could ask him things, that he could convince Lavender to write to him and get his guidance.
“You make me
There was a moment of silence and Hermione chewed on her lip before she shrugged. Through fire, it looked exhausted. “It’s really hard,” she said finally. “I wish that I — I don’t regret doing it. I
Ron reached over to ruffle Harry’s hair. “Nah. You’re an awful liar. Come on, I wanna go for a fly about. Maybe it’ll clear your head.”
Ron did not stay over at Hermione’s that night, or the next one. Harry asked Hermione about it as they shuffled around each other in the bright August morning and Hermione shrugged helplessly. “George wanted to go fishing,” she said.
do that.”
“Not all the time. Sometimes they’re normal things. I thought he was losing it because one time he asked me to describe a normal day.” Ron looked a little bit uncomfortable as he thought about it. “Felt like I was in some creative writing class.”
“We’ve been over this, Potter. I didn’t know that! Not then. Not . . . not for certain.”
"Draco.” He put a warning note in his voice. A mostly playful one, he hoped.
Harry held out his hand.
"Look," Draco started, "I didn't ask to come up here tonight. If you want me gone—"
“Yes, petrol, burns, explosions—you really know how to show a boy a good time.”
“Are you going to tell him to stop calling me Ferret?”
Harry smiled at that, but he was furrowing his brow at the same time.
“Oh, I think you were right. They're putting up with me because I'm under your thumb.”
"What do you—"
“I, er . . . “
“No.” Weasley slowly shook his head, as if still working it out for himself. “No, you’re entitled to privacy about this, with a couple of caveats.”
He opened his eyes cautiously, knowing he was back in the real world. Flat on his back, on his bedroom floor.
Draco managed a nod. “All right. Someday maybe you’ll tell me the full story—everything that’s left out of all these new history books.”
Hermione judged it a good time to intervene. Jamie looked near to, well, delivering a strict reprimand to her lover, and Hermione wasn't sure how she felt about that.
“No. You don’t get to interfere with any future heirs of mine.”
Harry could hear the challenge in his voice, but he didn’t rise to it. He already knew he was going to win this battle too, so there was no need. “Is it all right to have more than one style?” he asked instead. “Because I don’t care what you do with this room. We never eat in here.”
“Uh, right.” Right. Of course. This was the perfect way to end an awkward conversation. Except that Hagrid had recovered a bit and seemed ready to resume his interrogation.
“What’s wrong?”
Draco looked back up at Harry and gave him that tight smile again. It was a gentle smile this time, though, with just a hint of his customary sneer. “I think I’ll remain in your service for the rest of our lives. And I think you’ll always enjoy that. And you might even continue to enjoy my company, for the most part.”
He still hadn't moved any closer. Bill was starting to wonder what it would take to convince the boy—and he seemed very much like a mere boy at the moment—to sit down with him.
But his father waved that concern away. “Ron, I’m not sorry to see you two make peace with an old enemy.”
“Yeah. He’s alive and well at Malfoy Manor. I’m still quite fond of him, despite . . . well, you know.”
“And I expect you to learn to apparate and to cast a patronus.”
“No. I'd better explain.”
But Harry suddenly looked keenly interested. “Don’t stop. What did Bellatrix say?”
Draco had pressed all those buttons with considerable glee. Of course he had; he’d been mad with jealousy. Harry had rejected his offer of friendship only to choose this impoverished ginger instead.
“Yeah, but it's not settled—”
“But he’s doesn’t agree with his parents!” Hermione interrupted. “He’s not a pure-blood supremacist any longer. And he’s apologised for the things he did and the things he believed as a teenager.”
“Hello.” Draco kept his voice quiet and polite.
"Because it was your first time flying in a muggle aircraft. There is no chance you weren't awake the whole time."
"Shut it, Malfoy."
"Except for redecorating."
Hagrid stepped back into the doorway, raising his bushy, caterpillar-like eyebrows at Harry. “You want me to invite Malfoy in? What, so he can burn down another home of mine?”
Harry sighed as he collapsed on the chesterfield. “You're not happy.”
“No. The swirl of raw emotions contained in those memories is, but not the memories themselves.”
Harry wanted to leave New York immediately, but Draco was appalled at the thought.
Draco gave her a sour smile. "With what they have on my family and the history of that property? Yes."
“Burrowing.”
Harry cringed. Ron had been right; Draco probably sounded too much like he was sucking up, just as he used to with Snape.
->*<-
He stared at her, but then had the grace to look chagrined. Amused also, but still chagrined. “I’ll attempt to tone it down.”
“Hope he's not killed or nothing, Harry. Don’t want to see that.”
Light exploded in the hallway. A painful light that struck Harry full on, lifting him up and hurling him to the floor.
He smiled a little, partly because Draco’s animagus form was adorable, and partly because he had no idea how to interpret the furball’s intentions. Perhaps he wanted to show that he respected Harry’s decision to abstain from shagging at present. Or, more likely, this was Draco’s way of telling Harry that he wasn’t speaking to him at present.
“My friends will—”
Did he? Draco blinked.
“I don’t know about your mother, but your father’s family was a mixture of Anglicans and dissenters—chapel types, I think. And he had one branch of Hindu ancestors, of course. I think your Dad himself was Anglican, though I’ve no idea if that was just nominally.”
“And the flash drive?” Ron asked.
“No! I mean, yes.” Damn Draco for putting him into this position. Now Harry would have to face Hermione and try to explain how he suddenly owned a second house elf, who probably didn’t want her freedom any more than Kreacher wanted his.
She didn’t say anything.
“Probably.”
“Harry.” Narcissa attempted to sound calm and serene as she nodded a greeting. “Is everything quite all right? Is Draco—”
"Fuck." Potter was panting now. "Is this okay?"
Draco only grunted.
Hermione blanched. Then she asked, rather hesitantly, “Have you forgiven Draco for that?”
“And who trained you up? Someone you were with for a while, or some random bloke?”
'That's . . . complicated."
Weasley and Granger, meanwhile, exchanged glances, both obviously unsure what to say. Well, Draco would have to take the initiative, then.
"What did you think?" Harry asked.
“Does that mean you’re not planning to move, Malfoy?”
There was a sudden, dangerous glint to Harry’s eyes. “What do you want to see? What sort of punishment would you like to inflict on someone who, as a teenager, was forced to serve Voldemort and live with that monster's constant threats to him and his parents?”
Ron gave him a look.
“We are friends now,” Harry retorted.
Harry finished scribbling an answer to Shacklebolt and watched the owl take it gingerly in it's beak. “Sorry,” he told the animal. “Still no treats. I really will make it up to you.”
Ron sighed, deciding to delay this particular battle. “There’s a bit more to the story than that, but it’ll keep till morning.”
“Well, let’s start with bringing a house elf over without my permission or even giving me any warning—”
“No, I’m the one who should be apologising.” Ron’s father stood up. “I didn’t mean to speculate on your, er, relationship with Harry.”
“If Master would only listen,” Kreacher was gasping from behind.
"Harry, I usually do something with my parents on or near the date. At least when I'm in the country. Dinner or something."
And that was all right, wasn’t it? Draco wanted it too. Consenting adults and all that. It didn’t mean that Harry was power-mad or anything. He wasn’t like Tom Riddle.
Which was fine. Really it was. Draco was disillusioned with the man anyway. So what did he care?
“It is for me.” His voice was still drawling, but somehow it had lost that annoying, superior quality it usually held. There was even a hint of uncertainty in it, as if he were unsure of Harry’s intentions.
“But those will come in the future.”
“What did you just say? Tell me!”
"It'll never get old, but I'm not poking fun right now. It suits you, you know."
George nodded. "Yeah."
“I just realised. I don’t even know what religion my parents were. Probably Church of England?”
“No.” Harry could feel a scowl creep onto his face. “I think they cut ties with him, after his arrest. None of them tried to secure a visitor’s pass to Azkaban, even though we were allowing them at that point, and none of them turned up at his trial to support him. So I hope he wants nothing to do with them.”
Ron grunted. "Bet you can fight that too."
Anyway, even without the hand-holding, the truth was obvious now. Draco must have dressed Harry, for Merlin’s sake. Ron couldn’t explain exactly what was different about his clothes, but Harry had never looked so effortlessly stylish on his own.
“Grown on you?” Jamie shook her head. “Don’t listen to him, Harry,” she ordered—and it did sound rather like an order. “We heard all about you while Draco was living here.”
Hermione refused to rise to that bait. “You know that's not what I meant. This is about the life debt.”
“Trust me, I’m not.” His eyes took on a far away look, as if he were lost in a memory. Then he shook his head. “We didn’t work well together. It was partly my fault, because I wanted the connection between Voldemort and me to grow even stronger. I wanted to figure out what he was up to.”
Ron nodded. "I'd hand him over but he's his human self. Too tired to transform—he just collapsed into bed."
"Harry," Ron whispered. "He's not in your room."
“But . . . .” He blinked. “Why would you want to inflict me on them?”
“Draco, we—”
“Arthur wanted to take this opportunity to become better acquainted with you,” Hermione put in. “That's all."
“Cast Sectumsempra rather earlier, I expect.”
"No, your parents make out quite well. Your father will stay at liberty and they'll both keep their estate." She paused to shake her head. "But do you even care about Malfoy Manor? For yourself, I mean. Not for your parents or heirs."
“But you thought you had a fucking right to, didn’t you?” Draco snorted as he turned his face away to glare at the wall. “It’s like sixth year again, isn’t it?”
"About what?"
He even knew Draco’s expressions when he was in his twitchy ferret form. He could tell when the adorable little furball was angry, playful, curious, sleepy, or, again, when he felt safe and content.
Draco gave him a wary look, but finally nodded. “I’m always going to be like this, you know. I’m always going to lash out whenever, um—”
The tension in Harry’s shoulders began to spread. “You need advice about the life debt? Draco, are you—do you want to forget about it?”
“I was only spying on you, you know. The others were just there. And you got your revenge.” Harry found himself rubbing his nose.
Draco didn't tell him that Harry would have the final say over any marriage. Why bother? By the time September came, Harry would have lost interest in Draco, at least as a romantic partner. He was too decent a human being to fall permanently in love with a former Death Eater.
But Draco had lifted his eyebrows and informed Harry that even Snape would forgive him for being a celebrity now. And so here they were.
She considered that. “Point taken. But—”
Potter had kept those promises, so all three Malfoys owed their liberty to him. Yet Draco was probably about to watch his father claim that he'd sooner die in Azkaban than live under Potter's protection.
Fuck. Harry felt himself trip out of the memory. He was back in the centre of the floor, in the midst of all the desks and office commotion. And Draco was still leaning against a desk opposite him, his arms folded across his chest.
“But I want him here.”
Harry had never thought about Draco's birthday before, though he might have seen it on some court paper or other back during the trials. In all their time at Hogwarts, he had never wondered when or how his nemesis celebrated the day. "Thank Merlin you gave me some warning! What do you—"
“The point is this.” Harry closed his eyes for a second, remembering the scene. “We were alone. You had let down the blinds so no one could see what was going on. Once you petrified me—nice spellwork, by the way—you had me completely at your mercy. But that broken nose and that almost-ride back to Kings Cross was all you did.”
There was a gleam of mischief in Draco's eyes. “What are you going to do to stop me, Potter?”
Weasley’s pale skin was turning a violent shade of red. His freckles almost blended with his flush. “But he’s responsible for you, yeah? So he has a right to know that there’s some sort of trauma preventing you from apparating.”
He’d have gone straight to St. Mungo’s, but Ron had texted him to let him know that he had ordered Draco home. The ferret had been up for forty-eight hours straight, Ron said; he wasn’t doing his father any good keeling over from exhaustion.
"Don't. I'm not going to."
“No, not technically. But it’s real, Potter. Because if it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t be here to worry about whether I should have invited you to my wedding—or whether you would have accepted.”
Harry thought about that. “You know about Goths.”
Hagrid looked much struck by that, just as she had intended. This was something Hagrid could understand: the feral and naked fear an animal must feel for its predator.
“We’re here for a reason, Harry.” He took a step back. “And the memories I’ve hidden here . . . they’re not all pleasant.”
“No, you really can't.” Draco was chuckling now as he walked back to the bed, leaned down and kissed the top of Harry’s head. “Go back to sleep. Love you.”
Now Draco was looking as if he were forced to endure the most clueless boyfriend in history. "The question, Harry, is if you're willing to be seen with them. With my parents, I mean. In a magical establishment—not a muggle one. We won't be able to hide from the press."
“Yes. That’s how this works.”
Harry gave him what he hoped was a self-deprecating smile. “Yeah.”
“Not sure,” Harry shoved his hands into the pockets of his jeans. “Is the position open?”
But Draco shook his head as he placed a finger over Harry’s lips. “No, you don’t get to say that yet.”
“Dunno. He, um, probably wants to know where our boundaries should be, though.”
“Yeah?”
“No one thinks I was punished, Harry! At least if they know about the life debt, they'll—there’s a better chance of people accepting me. Of your friends accepting me.”
“Nothing. So, um, you choose the thoughts you’ll allow to rise to the surface, and then you lock them up. So when someone penetrates them through legilimency—”
“I like cuddling with your human form too, you tosser.”
He sighed. “They don’t talk to the likes of me, Harry. Pansy, Blaise—they were clever enough to stay out of the war, weren’t they? Neither took the dark mark, neither actually fought against the right side. Remaining friends with me would have damaged their reputation in the post-war world.”
“Bit dizzying isn’t it?”
"Come on, Potter." Draco looked exasperated now. "Out with it."
He reached out to smooth the collar of Harry’s shirt, those grey eyes of his soft. “It means I’d rather have my lord and master safe at home than off risking his neck on some idiot mission.”
Ron sighed and leaned back on the kitchen chair—so far that it balanced precariously on two legs. "Wasn't your fault. And Hermione was going to find out about Toffee sooner or later, you know."
“Yeah, good thinking. They might know scions of the Baumgarten family, actually. I don’t think they know about the arranged marriage idea, though.”
The conversation languished a bit. Lucius and Narcissa had insisted on putting off the real purpose of this meeting until after dinner. Harry wasn’t even sure how much they knew. Draco had sent them an owl to arrange this gathering, but he probably hadn’t told them why he wanted to bring Harry.
“But that would require moving again, wouldn’t it?”
“Yes, well.” He blushed. “You legilimency is improving, because most of those took place in the social hall, not in the sanctuary.”
Draco assumed he would refuse. From Harry’s point of view, what was there to discuss?
“But it’s getting toward the end of term,” Hermione reminded them. “He’ll be busy.”
“Why wouldn’t he?”
“Yeah.”
Harry considered that. “You might have a point."
Too bad. Draco had a few choice words for Weasley, but they would keep. For now.
Draco opened and closed his mouth several times, but no words came out.
Fuck.
“Well, I’m not.” Harry couldn’t explain why he felt defensive of all a sudden; he was doing the right thing. “They might as well know. And Shira might as well too, so let’s call her.”
“I can’t.” Draco searched for the words he needed. “I rely on Granger to set Harry straight if both Harry and I agree that he’s overstepped. In fact, I hope she’s setting him straight about something right now. But I need advice on where those boundaries are. And since Granger doesn’t respect my life debt to Harry—”
“We spoke with Robards this morning,” he explained. “He got us into his office and away from the press for a few minutes. Almost that whole neo-Death Eater cell is in Azkaban now, awaiting trial.”
“True.” There was no point in denying it. Harry really did have that much influence.
Draco sniffed. “Which they shouldn’t be using to travel muggle-style.”
"Fuck, Potter! You'd what? Order me to transform and then stuff me in a cage?"
“I disagree. He had the perfect revenge in his hands three years ago: he could have ensured that all three of us rotted in Azkaban.”
“Good.” Draco tapped his fingers against his knee. “You’ll be all right. You’re only consulting.”
Since when had Potter forgotten how to improvise? Draco urged him to think faster by nipping him.
Fuck. Sleeping was not an option when dealing with concussions. Harry knew that. He also knew that they should both be at St. Mungo’s. Why had he apparated them here? It was instinctive, he supposed. Grimmauld Place had started to feel safe again, especially after all the work he'd done on the wardings.
“Ah, no. We’re not nabbing the Dalai Lama and subjecting him to wizarding experiments.”
There was no particular bite or malice in his words, but Harry rolled his eyes again regardless. “I didn’t phrase it like that. I just—I said I’d testify for you and your mum.”
"Hardly a reliable source," Draco agreed, "but in this case the report was accurate."
“No.” Harry cut him off. “Sorry, Draco, but I need a word without you trying to play diplomat.”
“Yes. I just . . . wanted to choose my moment.”
“Goyle, I suppose. We don’t see each other much, but . . . well, yes. We’re still friends.”
“We don’t wish him any ill, Ron.” His father’s eyes were sympathetic, but there was steel behind them. “But he and his family have done immense harm. We’re not ready to welcome him into our home.”
He knew what Draco looked like when he felt proud of some accomplishment. And when he felt safe and content. And when he felt grateful. And when he was annoyed with Harry in a good-natured, exasperated way.
Since the comment somehow did not sound condescending, Draco kept dooking in response. At the same time, he squirmed again in order to change positions; he wanted to nuzzle into Weasley’s neck to better capture his scent.
“It’s half ten in New Jersey.”
Harry knew this was not the time to rub that in. “Want to talk about—um, whatever's really upsetting you?"
Hermione and Harry exchanged glances. She knew he was wondering how much to reveal, but she had no answer for him.
He transformed in response . . . and ended up straddling Harry on the chesterfield. Draco tried to wipe the smirk off his mouth as he gazed down at his saviour, but that proved impossible.
“Yes. Mother prefers a house with more than one style, in fact. As long as the transitions are handled well.”
It took Narcissa’s brain a moment to encompass the fact that by ‘home’ Potter meant Aunt Walburga’s old residence, as if her son no longer belonged in Malfoy Manor.
“You’ll get sacked if you go into his office blazing again.” Draco grinned suddenly and shook his head. “Of course, that might be just as well.”
But Draco surprised him. He wasn't sneering and he didn't seem upset. He wasn’t wearing that sucking-up expression either. Instead, he was giving Ron a measuring look—as if deciding, once and for all, if Ron were someone worth obeying.
“He did, did he?” Draco narrowed his eyes at Harry. “Look, I approve of keeping servants happy. Easier on everyone. But you can’t allow Kreacher to call the shots on this.”
"Yes, Harry."
Harry nodded as he reached for a quill. “Yeah. Might be a bit awkward for me, though. Not staying with Benjamin and Noa, I don’t think, but meeting Shira’s parents. They were hoping that Draco would marry her.”
Fuck! Harry closed his eyes, still falling, trying to make sense of everything bombarding him. This was the storm-like rush of thoughts, feelings, and memories that Draco allowed to remain at the surface. Harry needed to find the eye of this whirlwind, the calm centre, so he wouldn’t be battered by them.
“Out with it, Potter!”
Was he out to his parents? Harry couldn’t ask right now, so he tried to say something diplomatic instead.
Harry tiptoed past Walburga’s portrait and paused at the entrance to the massive dining room. Draco was standing at the table, with some sort of floor plans spread out before him. He was flanked by Kreacher and Toffee, who each stood on a chair so that they, too, could peer down at the plans.
“That’s an order.”
But it was just a nightmare. A distorted memory, really.
Shira, meanwhile, turned back to Harry. “Please go straight up to Aunt Cissy—she’s driving me insane. Jamie has more patience. So will you, I think.”
There was a warning note in Harry’s voice. Draco would have been offended, but the warning seemed designed for Weasley.
“Technically, yes. But I was on a sort of probation—this group didn’t trust me yet. So they didn’t involve me in anything of consequence.” He paused. “Look, I wasn’t in danger until much later, when I was deeper in. ”
"Dunno," Weasley said. "Probably better that the ferret's under Harry's thumb, don't you think?"
“They know. And, yes, Harry and Malfoy knew I was going to break it to them.”
“Sadly true.” George accepted his hand and let Draco pull him up. “Teasing aside, I’m depressingly hetero and conventional.”
And yes. As Harry looked up at those stupid, long, narrow boxes—feeling an awe that he was desperate to tamp down—he was forced to admit that they did. They anchored the skyline perfectly.
They were both shouting now, and both seemed to realise it at the same time. Harry looked around. Fortunately, no one else was in the alley, and they probably couldn’t be heard inside the pub.
“Yes, until you find the right witch or wizard.” Draco shook his head. “I’m not going to change, Harry, don’t you realise that? I’ll always be hurting other people when I don’t get my way.”
“No, you’ll be a good pet and allow me to trim them.”
There was much more to say between them, but Hermione still couldn’t face that yet. So she peered at the screen instead, determined to learn more about arbitrage and how to manipulate galleons and knuts.
Draco straightened up in his chair until his posture was once again properly rigid. “Sorry, Father. I would have explained earlier, but you felt it best to wait before I made my announcement.”
"I didn't. I have Toffee checking in with my parents each day; she had a note from the man waiting for me when the four of us got home—word of that little interview must have spread like fiendfyre. Toffee gave it to me right before my disastrous chess match with Weasley."
“Ah. Doesn’t sound to your liking, does it?”
"Her girlfriend . . . so you each bring a separate date and then talk about your potential engagement? How does that possibly work?"
It always took Draco a few seconds to adjust to his ferret senses—everything looked, smelled, and sounded different. His eyesight was shit, really, in this form. But he could hear and smell so much more.
“No offense, Benj, but you really can’t understand.” Draco slouched against a wall.
Draco snorted. “Well, if you want to champion the cause of prison reform, you’d do well to become auror-in-chief.”
"And the ministry can break that entail?"
“Thank you so much. So what the fuck am I supposed to do, then?”
He flashed her a look of alarm.
Draco nodded as he pushed himself up and climbed off the bed. “Yes. She’s, ah, from Malfoy Manor.”
"Trust me, nothing interesting going on in there. Just sleep."
Harry laughed as he turned toward the door. "Do your worst."
“So then . . .you really want this? To study muggle finances?”
Draco was in heaven. Or as near to heaven as a Malfoy could possibly get.
Harry thought it would be a good thing if Draco did lose his touch. To lock away so many of his memories like that—so much of himself—couldn’t be healthy. But he knew in his gut that Draco hadn’t lost his touch at all.
But Shira was frowning. “It’s hard to imagine Uncle Lucius and Aunt Narcissa falling for Voldemort.”
"Right." Suddenly Potter's defiance evaporated, and he was actually blushing again. "I'll, uh, just follow you, then.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Really, George?”
“What did you just say?”
Ron snorted. “Probably. Apparently you should claim it, though.”
“Are you quite done?”
Harry kept quiet; his lover obviously had more to say.
“Tell me, Harry. What did he say?”
“Well enough, when last we spoke. That was before I, er, entered your service. I’ll reach out to him again, if you don’t object.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Fine, I’ll bite. How is kvetching different from whinging?”
“But still our grandchild.”
“So you underestimated them.” Ron didn’t sound impressed.
“I should look into it, I suppose.” Harry was furrowing his brow now. “Not that it matters; I might somewhat believe in—um, well something. But I’m not attached to any particular religion, so I’ll go along with whatever you want.”
"Neither did you. And aren't you supposed to be resting now?"
“But you promised not to make things more difficult for him,” Draco continued, looking up again. “And that . . . that made a difference, Harry.”
"Yeah, but the lot of you reclaimed it in the end. Why have you brought this up?"
Draco frowned at him. “It wouldn’t have. Not according to my plan.”
“It’s very dark humor,” Jamie said. “I approve.”
The holy-fucking-saviour hesitated before answering, and then seemed to suck in a lung's worth of air. “To start with, I want you to tell me what Robards is holding over you.”
"Or something." Potter was actually blushing now. "Anyway, I realised that Draco was our agent, and that he was in trouble. Based on the intelligence he had gathered, I traced him to a house in Surrey. I thought I could extract him easily, but—"
“Let’s finish going through Harry’s clothes and do something with that wardrobe—are you particularly attached to it?” He walked up the gruesome staircase and toward the spare first-floor bedroom as he spoke, which is where they had stashed said wardrobe.
Harry shrugged. “Yeah, the life debt is permanent. But we do have the power to change the terms on which you pay it off. We already have done; that's why I can forbid the marriage, remember?"
“—and I imagine it’s quite becoming, as you seem to want this relationship of ours to last.”
"He's joking, Kreacher. Oh, we brought you home a Thai iced tea. Harry says you like them. It's on that table there."
"Good to know."
Now he was grinning wickedly. “Potter, we are not having this discussion in a sanctuary.”
"I don't want that. But if you do—"
“Draco, are you still afraid this won’t work?” He kept his voice soft. If this was another example of Malfoy’s insecurities driving him, it was best to reassure him.
Draco's voice was a little alarmed now. “Please don't tell me you went rogue.”
And it wasn’t. It was a problem, perhaps, but not a disaster.
"Pretty sure he does know that."
“Didn’t think so.”
Harry burst out laughing. “Nothing new from him, then, except for the compliments.”
He shook himself. Harry was still staring at him with that intense gaze—though, to do him justice, it wasn’t judgmental or prying. It was more affectionate and genuinely curious.
“But there’s more?” Harry was staring at him intently now.
Salazar, Potter was still an arrogant shit sometimes. Not that Draco minded, exactly. He wore it well—and he, of all people, was entitled to it. Regardless, the sheer chutzpah of the man never failed to astonish Draco. "So you want the power to stop me from marrying? Want me all for yourself?"
Jamie rolled her eyes at her girlfriend. "Why does that bother you? It's his foreskin."
"Yeah, I do. Sometimes." He let out another long sigh. “I’m not really upset about you driving, you know. And you are actually better than me on a broom. Better and faster.”
“It’s the reason you’re still breathing, you know. The fact that I hurl myself into danger and rescue people.”
Draco stared at him. "Are you sure?"
“Arthur Weasley hates me.”
He nodded as he stepped inside. “Sorry to intrude. Breakfast is ready—Kreacher and Toffee want me to collect our guests on time."
Draco quirked an eyebrow at him. "And yet you cast it anyway."
“Right.” Harry paused to run his fingers through his hair. “Ron, will you accept him?”
Draco seemed to understand the warning—and even to heed it. "Certain pure-blood families are good at compartmentalising, Weasley," he said, more-or-less diplomatically. "They can despise muggles and still recognise the value of using their currency."
"Draco insisted on retrieving a flash drive first—this was with flames all around us, mind—but, yeah. We ended up singed and concussed and banged up, but otherwise all right."
“Nothing.” He reached for Draco’s hands again. “It’s just that—you don’t have to do this anymore. Voldemort’s dead. The aurors aren’t going to interrogate you again. You don’t need layers and layers of security in your head.”
Draco’s brain seemed to freeze at that. So Robards considered him expendable, despite the promises he made. Promises about how the Ministry always looked after their agents. And Draco had been stupid enough to believe the man.
Draco snorted. "So it seems. Fine, then. But I expect to be spoiled rotten."
“None of us sleep well after the war, you know.” His voice was soft. “Not all the time. Even occlumency can’t fix that.”
Harry would have lingered in that room for ages, but soon they were headed downstairs toward a foyer, a couple of small offices, and a few short hallways of what must be the classrooms.
Harry grinned. “What does that mean? You just want to shag the chosen one?”
Conversion and becoming a member of the Baumgarten family—to Draco, those two things were inextricably linked. But what if Potter were in this for the long term? He thought he was, of course, but what if he actually was in reality?
Harry felt his shoulders tense. “Why do you need it on record?”
“Our kitchen what?” Harry entered the room; time to stop eavesdropping and make his presence known. Though, to be honest, it felt just like old times to be spying on Draco Malfoy.
Now Harry looked confused. “What do you mean?”
Harry stared at him as his thoughts on therapy and therapists seemed to scatter. “Pardon?
Right. Settle into a normal conversation first. Perhaps Draco needed time to work up to the real issue.
He was obviously offended, but Harry didn’t care. “Can you cast a patronus?”
She believed, at heart, that Draco had always secretly respected and admired Harry. Those emotions had been poorly mixed with jealousy, fear, and resentment, but they had still been visible whenever he tried to put himself at the centre of Harry's attention. (Usually with resounding success.)
“Wrong-headed?” Jamie volunteered. “Ill-considered?”
“Shit, you’re right. Well, um—wait, did Arthur get on with them?"
He paused a moment, coming back to his human senses, and then turned to nod at Potter's guests. “Granger. Weasley.”
“Mr. Potter, what an honour.” Her eyes sparkled with mischief. “Dare I ask what you are doing with Draco at—what time is it there? Two-thirty in the morning? Is his virtue safe with you?”
Hermione must’ve reached for her wand, because a moment later she had summoned a warm glow of light. “Should I ask how it went?”
"But that's not the same as a life debt, Ferret."
He shrugged. “I’m a bit surprised Dumbledore met you at King’s Cross. It should have been your parents. Or your godfather. If they could appear to you as you walked into the forest, why couldn't they explain it all? Why the man who brought you up as a sacrificial lamb?”
“What? It's half eleven. We can't go to the manor now.”
“Care to share, Malfoy?” Harry gave the blankets a tug.
Draco turned even paler than usual. "Vividly. But again, you'll need to be more specific."
"Yeah?"
“Don’t act so surprised. You’re a natural leader, Harry. And Granger is almost as competent as she is self-righteous—not to mention ambitious.”
“Yeah. In five or six days, I suppose.” He hesitated, his eyes still earnest. “Do you consider Moan—er, Myrtle a friend? Is that why you insisted on seeing her?”
“No take backsies,” Draco said seriously. “You think I’m perfectly sane.”
The worst part was that he couldn’t go now, he thought. Draco was awake, probably, but Harry wasn’t sure. Maybe he had dashed the note off and then retired to bed. That seemed like something he would do.
Hermione’s look was sharp. “But you
Draco snorted. “Yet, here you are, turning up to ask questions when you found out.”
“Gin, nothing.” Ginny tapped her fingers against the table. “I know, Harry. I just don’t want to hear about it, okay? Let’s just — you were right. We should get something to eat. I’m going to get lunch from the deli on the corner and I’ll come back with it. And when we’ve done that, we can talk about Narcissa Malfoy’s invitation like civilised people, but right now I want to go outside and kick your gate while picturing it’s her smug face.”
"Maybe you weren't focused enough?", Rose tried to cheer him up and put her hand on his shoulder. Rose decided not to try it herself for now.She couldn't bear to make Albus even more miserable, should she succeed in front of him.  She knew how much it meant to Albus. He had heard many stories about the Patronus. Many about how it had saved his father's life one time or another. And now he was totally excited for the form of his own patronus.
The Gryffindor would have been surprised if it had been anything else. Because he knew how important his freedom was to Scorpius. Especially after hearing all those stories about the war. About Azkaban and the things his family had suffered or much more likely done. He promised himself he would never be like that. And what animal would symbolize that better than a powerful and magnificent eagle.
"You really do look like your parents. All three of you, you take after your fathers. Especially Rose. I never thought a female edition of Mr. Weasley could be so adorable" - Flattered, Rose turned away briefly. Her cheeks took on a delicate shade of red and she smiled tentatively to herself.
"You guys ready?" he asked again before taking a breath and looking his friends in the eye. He received only an affirmative nod and poured the silvery viscous liquid into the bowl. It was just about the right size for all their heads to fit in, so they could experience the memory together. They looked at each other only briefly and then simultaneously put their faces into the liquid.
"Depends on how old this ribbon is. The truce between Slytherin and Gryffindor has only been in place for maybe eight years. This one looks a lot older," Rose pointed out.
"A love oath, perhaps?" pondered Scorpius, carefully stroking the Slytherin crest. He seemed very thoughtful. Knowing him as Albus did, he was thinking again about how everything might have gone if he had also ended up in Slytherin like everyone else in his Falimie.
Albus had been nervous all day. He had been sitting on pins and needles in class and was about to say they were going to the Whomping Willow during lunch. But Rose managed to stop him. Albus was relieved when they were finally released from the last lesson and could now set off.
"May I ask what you want from him?" the principal asked, already walking towards the portrait of the former principal.
"My father has the initials DM. Also, they were students at Hogwarts at the same time. Your father was a Gryffindor and mine was a Slytherin," Scorpius explained himself.
"That makes sense. But if it really is a love oath, then it can't be Aunt Ginny," Rose reasoned aloud, taking her chin between her thumb and forefinger.
"I envy you" - The Ravenclaw immediately believed Albus, but said nothing more in reply. It remained silent and Scorpius browsed in his book some more, while Albus put his head back in his neck and closed his eyes. Rose was about to look for a book from a shelf to do the same to Scorpius. And there were books in the Ravenclaw common room, more than enough.
"And as a sign of that eternity, this ribbon will hang here. As long as this ribbon remains, you can be sure that my feelings for you will never change." - And with these words, Draco placed a permanent sticking charm over the ribbon.  Now this ribbon can never be taken from the willow. For all eternity it will be here and be a symbol of their feelings, their love.
"The Room of Requirement is not on the Marauder's Map. It is also called 'Come and go room'. It only appears when it is really needed. You have to conjure it up with your mind, in a way, and then wish for a room. And here is the problem. If Uncle Harry has thought up a special room, we have to find out what the 'password' is. Otherwise we will never get into this room" - Rose was more than happy that her mother had already informed her about this room in the first year of school. Hermione had told her daughter all about it, in case she needed some quiet time to study. Since Hermione could remember all too well her own school days and had used the Room of Requirement for the same purposes. And she knew that Rose was second to her in her eagerness to learn, which made her very happy!
"Hey Scorpius, what are you reading?" asked Albus, dropping heavily onto the sofa next to the blond.
"Oh come on, you're at least as keen to try out the Patronus!" shouted Albus and ran on towards the forbidden forest. A moment ago they had Defense Against the Dark Arts and their teacher was teaching them the Patronus spell, only in theory, of course. The practice would be some time coming, which didn't mean that the students couldn't try it out anyway. After all, nothing was forbidden to them.
"Oh. Then maybe I should take a look at that one too," Rose reasoned, sitting down next to Albus.
When they finally arrived, Albus was also completely out of breath but still full of vigor. Sometimes Rose wondered about how willingly Albus crammed for this subject and totally let others slide - like Potions, for example.
