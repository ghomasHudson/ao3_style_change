“That’s heartless even from you,” said Pansy, pointedly picking up her tea and turning her face from him to look out over the lawn.
“Are we sure it’s soul magic?” Luna pushed the glasses up on top of her head, blonde hair tumbling out around her face. “Most soul magic is purely theoretical. Just because Riddle asked doesn’t mean he attempted it.”
“Oh ho, I think I know what this is,” said Voldemort, finishing his loop and coming to stand over Draco’s form again. “You’re under a Fidelius Charm, aren’t you? I’ve seen it before.”
Blaise looked both ways down the hallway and when it was clear, reached into his pocket and pulled out a phail. Draco was surprised to find that what was tipped into his mouth was healing potion.
“Early memories are funny, they have a natural haziness to them like you haven’t figured out your senses yet. Maybe it’ll help you access on your own,” suggested Draco.
“You’re off to practise?” asked Pansy, her eyes darting between the two. “Well actually, I can just ask my question in class, Professor. I’m happy to walk you to the pitch, Draco.”
“Do you want us to get you anything?” asked Angelica, looking inquisitively from Gemma to Harry and back. Gemma looked at Harry impatiently.
Draco shortly found himself in the north wing library, seated with his father across from Lord Voldemort, Nagini, and a handful of his closest Death Eaters. They’d been ushered into the room so quietly that Draco wondered for a moment if he had been found out, but the amiable chatter of the other Death Eaters around the fire calmed his nerves.
Harry’s heart dropped. The one thing they came for and they would have to leave it behind when it was right in their grasp.
“Regrets,” he said plainly, closing the basin away in a wardrobe. “Wondering how things could have gone another way. I wouldn’t expect you to understand.”
“Revealing the secrets of the universe?” asked Draco, putting his hands in the pockets of his robes and sauntering over to the window.
Draco blinked back in bewilderment, wondering how it could be that the other four were saddled with visions of wartime while he’d been sent to a madhouse. Could it be that the diadem made a mistake? Maybe it had weakened after all that it had been put through already today. It was an ancient relic, after all. There was no way there was a possible timeline where he’d be caught dead in these clothes.
said Hermione, turning back in a flash, her eyes brimming with tears. “That name has a Taboo on it. So unless you want both of us killed, I suggest you avoid summoning You-Know-Who by name. Now—” She Transfigured a chair out of the forest floor and took a seat across from Harry. “We’re going to start from the beginning, and you’re going to tell me exactly who you are and what you know. Because the real Harry would never forget that Cedric is dead.”
Hermione huffed a breath of laughter. “Leave it to a Slytherin to take a lie to the grave” she said, summoning a book that came flying out of her bag and landed with a thunk on the coffee table in the centre of the room.
A murmur of suppressed groans could be heard as students riffled in their bags to locate their copies of
“You better start talking fast because you are about to be Obliviated into the next life unless I start getting some answers. Who are you and what have you done with Harry?” she demanded, her wand tip inches from his face.
He looked back down on the street, but he couldn’t see anything in the cloud of debris that appeared there. His heart beating in his ears, he could feel his throat tighten as a cousin he hardly knew he had was ripped away from him.
Harry stood up abruptly and grabbed Draco by the elbow, casting a furtive glance through the windows of the club.
“Could be Hufflepuff,” he said, taking a bite of bread. “You’re mental and you’ve got a serious temper, but you’re a damn hard worker I’ll give you that much.”
“Three times down the corridor,” McGonagall was saying as the two walked down the tapestry-laden hall. Snape had left them to remain in the dungeons, hopefully to get a grip on himself. “And then the room will appear. You are not to bring any other students with you, and I dare say you should come up with a good recurring excuse to have no one following you whenever you plan to visit Mr Potter.”
The Dark Lord held his hands out dramatically, to a few laughs from the audience of Death Eaters. He circled Harry, the closeness of his presence bringing a chill in the air.
But the bard merely scrabbled to get his papers in order, jotting down what he’d just said. “Fears… secrets… laid bare, yes yes, that’s good.”
Hermione considered this for a moment and then wordlessly released the restraints on his right arm. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the holly wand. He hadn’t attempted to share his consciousness with another before, but he’d seen Malfoy do it, so he knew it was possible. Not to mention he had no idea what would work in the rendered world of the diadem, but it was now or never if he wanted to get anything useful out of this vision.
“Granger was right. About my family, that is,” he started, glancing at Harry. “I should have told you all sooner, but the Malfoys and the Blacks have had dark ties in the past. My Aunt Bellatrix and her husband were convicted Death Eaters. When Granger tried to out me I wasn’t ready to face it but the way the world is going, I don’t think I can sanction what they’ve done any longer.”
Dumbledore paused for a beat as though considering this, casting his eyes into the bag of lemon sweets on his lap.
“Pansy,” said Draco, trying to mask his surprise as quickly as possible. “No need to wait up for me darling, I wouldn’t want to be the reason you’re losing sleep.”
“Who would have thought I’d live to see the day that Draco Malfoy listens to Muggle glam rock.” Hermione laughed and bumped into Draco with her shoulder as she pushed the trolley along.
“I saw what happened to Al’s hand,” said Harry, shaking his head at the memory. “I wasn’t about to give that a try. “
Draco riffled through several drawers of mixed ingredients, snatching a few leaves of Alihotsy and a sprig of peppermint. Where was that house-elf when he needed her?
“There’s nowhere with class in Hogsmeade,” said Pansy, dragging the magazine back towards her. “Besides, I think it’s romantic. You do want to take me somewhere romantic, don’t you?”
Harry had been smaller then, like a malnourished puppy. Now he was filled out across the chest. Strong arms raised the club and brought it down in a neat arc, making a loud crack of contact with the ball. As it landed and rolled a short way towards the flag, Angelica called out, “Woo! Go, Harry!” and bounced up and down, her skirt flouncing around her in the breeze. If Angelica really saw something in Harry, he might actually be in trouble.
As Harry’s footsteps died away, Draco let out a slow sigh. Of course not. He was an idiot to think that Potter would still want him after all he’d done.
anywhere near our son!” screamed Narcissa, throwing the crystal tumbler into the back of the fireplace where it shattered, causing the flames to sputter wildly.
“I’ve never known Mother to have any visions,” he said, trying to discern the mixture of emotions in his father’s eyes. Even if he doubted her, Draco couldn’t believe that his father would turn against her. After all, no one with secrets survived long within the brethren.
“Oh, I know what will improve them!” said Luna, turning her round eyes on Draco, and making him cringe at the mental image of her Transfiguring his buttons into Butterbeer bottle caps or something equally atrocious.
As billowing smoke filled the empty platform, Harry looked over his shoulder, spotting Charlotte taking cover by a support beam, her mouth open in shock.
“You take yourself too seriously, mate. You’ll have a heart attack before you’re old enough to take the Mark,” said Blaise in a joking voice, but there was a strange glint to his eye that set Draco on edge. “No point guessing what you’re doing down here, I already know.”
“Er, right then,” continued Harry, “Once you guys have finished your drinks, we can head over. It’s just around the corner.”
Pansy folded the newspaper and looked up stoically at the others. “That’ll be why Neville is out of sorts lately.”
“No, well let me spell it out for you,” said Snape, in a voice of cold control. “The world’s fear of the Dark Lord is predicated on the fact that no one has ever stood against him and lived. But someone did, someone survived a Killing Curse at his own hand and reduced him to a spectre. If the world were to find out that Potter exists, the world would know the truth – that the Dark Lord is but a mere man. Powerful, certainly, but mortal.”
“Merely that the ring disappeared around the same time as old Marvolo Gaunt died and the bloodline dried up. It’s been decades since it was seen, but was prized by many as a relic of Salazar Slytherin,” recited the shopkeeper obediently, though he was looking at Draco with a certain shrewdness. “Young master certainly wouldn’t be trying to sell the ring, would you?”
“Hm,” Pansy mused, sounding unconvinced. She had a sixth sense for his lies. He’d have to tread extremely carefully around her. “Then I guess it won’t bother you to see this.”
McGonagall fumed silently, keeping her chin up with dignity as the Aurors stepped back and Umbridge turned to face her prey.
The door to the Potions classroom was locked, and there was no response to Draco’s loud knocking. He paced angrily, toying with the idea of blasting his way through, when the door opened up a crack and a timid house-elf stood, knees clacking together nervously.
“Look, Professor. I’ve been thinking a lot about our last conversation and I wanted to get your advice.” Draco pushed back from the door, pacing in the narrow corridor. “You said not to make the same mistakes you did… about giving information over to the Dark Lord.”
He even allowed himself to feel a flicker of hope at the notion that Draco might return his feelings, but as they emerged from the memory, laughing awkwardly as a Queen record played in the background, he forced the thought away. Which was easy enough to do when Cedric arrived home from the run with an assortment of Muggle clothes of highly dubious fashionability.
“Surely you have a tracker on him, something we can use to find him?” said Hermione in a panicked voice as she, Draco, and Cedric gathered in the kitchen after finding no trace of Harry in the rest of the house.
,” said Draco, clearing the mist as he entered the room. “Not bad. Better brush up on your counter-spells though.”
“Wrong,” said Voldemort, pointedly. “It says that Dumbledore was a manufacturer of his own destiny as well as yours, and that your trust is misplaced in him.”
“I see,” said the old man, pressing a few greasy locks of hair away from his eyes. “Buying or selling?”
They sat in silence for a few moments, lying awake and staring at the ceiling, which thankfully had no pictures of bikini-clad women.
“Who are these guys?” asked Harry, pointing to a picture of an orange-clad team flying in formation.
“It belonged to the one we no longer speak of,” said Ollivander, lowering his voice. “He Who Must Not Be Named.”
“We’re only getting essentials,” said Hermione. “Money is tight and Kreacher kept throwing them out anyway. You know how much he prefers to bake for us.”
In the distance, he could see Angelica speaking into her father’s ear as the two of them glanced towards him and Harry. Draco smiled calmly in their direction and considered whether they were far enough away for him to hex Potter without them hearing.
The memory of the escape started from the back of the Thestral, though if Draco didn’t know better he’d say they were hurtling through thin air. Strange that Potter had never witnessed death, he thought. Perhaps he had not witnessed his parents struck down by the Killing Curse at all.
“Yes, I have heard of the mental link from my father,” said Draco. “And you feel confident the boy is in Hogwarts, my Lord?”
“When one has served as a reliable guard for as many decades as I have, there is no reason to change,” Lucius continued. “But our Lord currently wishes to have it kept close as it holds some sentimental value; a record of his youth.”
He was about to suggest calling for Hermione when Luna grasped the tiara with both hands and held it up to eye level.
“Fuck, Draco. How could you do it?” demanded Harry at last. Draco could feel a ripple of magical energy crackle through him. He was angry.
“Alright, tell me where to take us,” said Draco, twining his arms around Harry. But he no sooner said the words than there was a crack and the feeling of a jolt of magic as he was whisked away.
“‘Zis way, if you please,” said the waiter in a heavy accent, motioning them through and then scurrying back out, drawing the curtain closed behind him.
“You’ll never come out of there,” pleaded Draco, fighting against a lump in his throat. He could hardly bear to see what had become of this once imposing figure; reduced to grasping at strands of memory to escape this reality.
Mr DuPont nodded approvingly. Angelica started babbling on about the cards she had pulled for the day, which had said they were in for a close game. Harry sat contentedly on the end of the settee and listened. Completely at ease, as though he hadn’t come with the express intention of ruining Draco’s carefully laid out plans.
“Life saver,” said Harry with a grin. “Bring the mimbletonia here and let’s get it in before Hermione asks too many questions.”
“I don’t have you scheduled till this afternoon,” said Hermione, shuffling through a stack of papers on her lap.
“It’s nothing to be ashamed of,” Draco pressed on. “We all have bad memories. My father yelled at me on a number of occasions when he was very cross. I remember one time I flew a new broom straight through the stained glass in the parlour. Never heard the end of it.” He smiled faintly at the memory.
“Isn’t it?” he said, leaning in to press his forehead to hers. “Me at the right hand of the Dark Lord. You, there by my side. Maybe I’ll even keep you around, if you promise to burn this place to the ground with me.”
There was a moment of pause in the group when Harry briefly wondered if the tentative pact that had brought this group together would hold. After all, they only signed up to teach him a few weeks of magic, and now here they were on the eve of a mission that may very well be impossible.
“Shite. This is why it pays to be on time,” said Tonks, fortifying the shield. “You go, I’ll follow when I can.”
“When the Dark Lord has selected you to join his inner circle, you will know it,” said Lucius, reaching for his own glass of Bordeaux. “For me, it was the honour of protecting an object he held most dear. One of the only items in the material world that he cared about above all else.”
There was a strange pause as the song switched over on the record and a new, slow guitar started up.
“Relax,” said Angelica, running her hand down his arm and threading their fingers together. “He likes you. I can tell.”
“Nonsense, you really need a good cup of coffee if you’re going to play well at this hour. I should know!” boomed Mr DuPont. Angelica nodded along. “Two black coffees for us and uh, what do you think Harry would like?”
“No, I’m not,” said Harry, looking down at his matchstick, which was still very much a matchstick and not at all a needle. “What are you reading, anyway?”
at the chair. “I only mean, if you intend to keep this a secret from Granger, you should only practise spells you can counter. Otherwise she’ll wonder why there are so many melted spoons around.”
“Yeah, if you’ve got time to kill I could use your help on this,” said Theo, looking uncertainly between two piles of blue-green and green-blue algae, before picking one and tossing it in.
“You saw Remus?” Harry asked. His pulse quickened—maybe this was his chance, to tell him how Teddy was doing, to ask him what he would have wanted for his only son, to ask him about the letters he’d written to Sirius that he’d found in the attic of Grimmauld place….
“Little good it will do the boy,” said Snape, evading the question. “With no other magical ability, Occlumency will not be much more than cloud coverage.”
“What?” said Draco, perturbed. “It would have been a nightmare if I had to do that. I’ll have you know. Damned Oliver Wood was supposed to be on it with him and had to cancel.”
“Funny,” said Blaise, rummaging in his pockets for a letter on crisp white paper. He tossed it in Draco’s direction, where he immediately recognised the Malfoy seal. “I’ve already received a summons.”
Angelica was awake, propped up on the bed in a fluffy white hotel robe, reading a muggle magazine by the low light of the lamp on the nightstand and eating a piece of cake off of a nearby room service trolly. Her hair fell in loose waves around her shoulders and her eyes snapped up as he entered, quickly softening into a tipsy smile.
Harry pulled back, taking a breath and a small step away. His green eyes still shockingly close and bright in the low light of the balcony.
“If things are getting that bad, maybe we ought to go back and see if we can’t get a few of them out. I reckon Abe would help,” said Harry.
“I’ll be careful, Hermione,” said Harry. “The faster I learn, the faster I’ll be out of your hair and we can all go back to our normal lives.”
A folk rock song started with a slightly melancholy guitar. Draco turned around, looking proud of himself to have successfully figured it out.
“I’m fine,” she said, waving him away. “But you have to see this. The diadem shows you visions of another world. One that could have been!”
“Hermione, it’s fine. If we get into a scrap, I’m sure we can get out of it. I might not be able to Apparate but I’m not completely helpless, you know,” said Harry. “It’s a calculated risk, we already decided. Right, guys?”
“Come look at the mimbletonia with me while we wait. It looks like it might need repotting again soon,” Luna said, flitting over to the window seat where the plant in question was starting to drop tentacle-like roots over the edge of the pot.
The mental image of Draco dusting off the oldest bottle of wine he had ever seen and cracking up into hysterics when it tasted like absolute shit made Harry smile stupidly to himself in the darkness. That was what he loved about Draco – he was the perfect mix of composure, wit, and fearlessness.
“Unbelievable,” said Draco, throwing his hands up. “You’re literally a hero in our world, and you’d rather leave all that behind and become what, some computer wizard?”
Standing at the far end of the hall, Draco looked dazed as he clutched his left arm. The Stinging Jinx, which had seemed so innocuous when Cedric had cast it a few weeks ago, had torn through the robes on Draco’s side, and the skin of his arm looked raw and burned. He reached up with his wand hand, pulling it away to see blood dripping down his graceful fingers.
But the novelty didn’t last long. Harry quickly countered the opening and was soon the first to claim a piece on the board.
“Luna said you wouldn’t have much time. The diadem is an ancient relic, it’s probably trying to give you some perspective you wouldn’t have gotten in your own timeline. What do you need to know?”
“I know this case means something to you, something personal,” said Draco, evenly. “I saw how it affected you on the day I was brought under the Fidelius. And I can sense deception in your answers about Potter. You were a good enough Occlumency teacher to get me that far.”
“Harry, just wait a moment,” said Hermione, trying to placate as Harry looked frantically through the contents of the spilled trunk, broken shards of memory phials tinkling lightly. “We need to think. What do you mean Voldemort is trying to steal your regeneration?”
He turned back to follow Luna’s bobbing head as she led him down the sloping lawn, over the thick roots of trees into the Forbidden Forest to the Thestral clearing. The strange transparent creatures were quick to find them, as they had been on the first night. And Luna even helped Harry select one to ride and make his way onto its back, even though she wore a forlorn look as she did it.
“Yes, I’ve been told,” said Draco, feeling a sudden tightness in his throat. “Can you tell me more about the circumstances of the deal?”
Tonks leaned over the table and mussed up his hair. “Aw, you grow up so fast. Next thing I know you’ll be out there making runs on your own.”
“It’s just as I suspected. You do have something to hide,” said Voldemort. “You will find that you cannot hide it for long.
Charlotte unfolded a piece of parchment from her jacket pocket, which Harry recognised to be his letter. In the corner, scrawled in blue ink, was a sketch of a girl holding a snake and the words, “Can’t wait to meet you, Charlotte! Love, Luna.”
and remove any chance of that happening, but he hesitated. He had long ignored an itch to learn more about his dark master, and here was Dumbledore saying that he had once been no more than a boy himself. As well as corroborating Snape’s recollection of the prophecy.
Despite the fact that they were wanted fugitives, Harry thought that life at Grimmauld Place was not altogether terrible.
Harry stared on for a moment, but none of the others looked back, so he sat on the wet sand and looked out at the ocean. His eyes fell on a pretty scalloped shell and he pried it out, running his hand across the ridges and thinking about what it would be like to live somewhere else. Under the sea maybe.
Suddenly the kettle started a high-pitched whistle and a woman’s voice from upstairs called, “Draco, would you get that for me?”
Harry turned to look at him, realising his expression was not his usual smirk but a deep, honest gaze.
, as if he didn’t remember they had already read it front to back with him last year, before he’d combined 6th & 7th year curriculums to have more time for book signings.
“Well done, mate,” said Cedric appreciatively, leaving forward to inspect the cup and tilting it into the glimmering light by one of its delicate handles.
“You don’t want to do this, trust me,” he said. But he wasn’t sure if he even believed it. Snape was a sorry sight. Bound and silent, but his eyes still reaching, straining towards the Pensieve.
Before Draco could finish, a Veela waitress appeared between them with a cluster of champagne flutes levitating behind her, and began pouring out drinks. The others clambered around excitedly and Harry caught Draco’s eye, waving away the question as if to say tell me later.
“I say we bide our time. No one else will find out about Potter so your golden goose is safe. And when the time comes, I will support you in whatever way I can to reveal all that is necessary to our Lord. I can only hope that when you are in a position of even greater power, you remember all that I did to support you on your rise.”
“Oh, well accidental magic happens regularly for children before they begin their magical education, but they usually grow out of it while they’re young,” said Hermione, seeming to choose her words carefully. “Does that always happen when you try to access your magic?”
“What would you do at Hogwarts?” asked Draco, his eyes flicking across the board as he laid out his next moves.
Dumbledore’s Army? Harry felt a strange surge of pride at the name, but he didn’t know why. Somehow this wasn’t matching up with Luna’s diadem vision. The school was still occupied, for one thing, and Harry didn’t seem to be leading any merry band of rebels. He was seemingly alone in the woods with Hermione, in a tent with three beds.
He was partly relieved to have one less set of lies to maintain, but he knew it would come at a cost. She would only show her hand now as a bargaining measure.
Draco yanked the doors of the wardrobe open where the large stone basin lay glowing. “How good is your levitation?” he asked in Harry’s direction.
“It’s Luna,” said Harry, stepping aside as Draco raced past him. As his eyes fell on the sleeping witch, the colour drained from his face. “We found another Horcrux.”
“But how do we even know what’s possible in our world?” asked Hermione. “In every case, the vision showed us a world where Voldemort was already in power. Whereas here, he’s still in hiding.”
“She was right,” said Harry, closing the gap between them, and dragging the backpack full of Horcruxes with him. “You’re dying.”
When they weren’t trying to solve the Horcrux dilemma, the other three rotated on running errands into the city to pick up supplies or intel. Harry, unable to leave for security reasons, stayed home, but the others had an unspoken agreement to spend time only on frivolous things when one of them was out of the house. Harry cooked meals with Kreacher, practiced spells with Hermione, or played chess with Cedric. But more often than not, he could be found in one of the rooms at the top of the stairs, listening to records and sharing memories with Draco.
“Wish I’d thought to look here sooner. It would have made escaping a hell of a lot easier,” said Harry with a crooked grin.
Draco’s eyes went wide as he reached out a hand to stroke the air incredulously. “Unbelievable. A genuine invisibility cloak,” he said, unable to hide the amazement in his voice. Even he, who had seen a great deal more than most at his age, had never laid eyes on one.
“All the better to be closer to the boundless heavens!” called the bard after him, licking the nib of his quill to begin writing again. “Ooh, boundless heavens, there’s something in there…”
There had been glimmers over the past few weeks of real brains behind those bouncing waves. She was certainly strategic, and she seemed just on the edge of saying something compelling, before biting her tongue and falling back on something airheaded. But he liked her like she was now; frank, open, competitive.
Harry paused, his eyes searching Draco’s face. Without thinking, without even knowing what he was doing, Draco grabbed Harry’s shirt and kissed him, hard.
“A psychologist?” said Luna, flipping to the index of her book. “I’ve never heard of that creature before.”
“It’s a terribly dark piece of magic that You-Know-Who invented to keep people in line,” said Hermione, biting her nail with worry. “It’s said he could use it as a homing beacon, to find and punish his followers if they ever betrayed him. But no one really knows if—”
He flipped the page and spotted a familiar grainy black and white picture of Dr Weaver and a child, recognising it as the same photo that appeared in the book on Obscurials.
“Well, they’re better than whatever horrible clothing Diggory found for us,” he said, pushing through into the crimson and gold room.
“You’re despicable,” said McGonagall. “Dumbledore was working to expose the truth. He Who Must Not Be Named has returned, and if you are too blind to see it the whole Ministry will fall.”
“I don’t know. He doesn’t even seem to know we have them. He hasn’t been angry lately or I think I would feel it,” said Harry.
“No one is surprised that you’d get too drunk to apparate yourself home if that’s what you mean,” Draco said, closing the gap between them and pushing Harry back against the wall of the alley, leaning down to kiss him again. “And yours?”
In Sirius’s room that night, Harry lay awake. The lingering tendrils of the wine left him feeling fuzzy around the edges, but the nerves of what the following day held kept him alert.
“It’ll be fine,” said Harry into her cloud of curls. She pulled back smiling and Luna gave him a hug as well.
Draco paced, frowning. “I have a family place I inherited that almost no one knows about. We can take the Floo from Hogsmeade, but we’d have to go straight away before they lock this place down.”
“Listen to this,” said Harry, breaking into laughter. “‘The names of non-magical professions may be misleading. For instance, an accountant is a professional at counting, but a plumber does not work with plums.’”
“I remember a happy childhood. One with doting parents who would do anything for me and for each other. It got harder once I was old enough to realise everything we stood to lose. There were certainly a few mistakes made, but nothing done without the interest of our family first,” he said, truthfully.
“Shit,” said Cedric, running a worried hand through his hair. “I can’t take him. I’m supposed to be here on official Ministry business. Are you and Luna alright to—”
But almost as if the shadow figure had heard Harry’s own thoughts, he turned to gaze into the mirror and Harry saw the same crimson eyes. But the face, which had been whole, was deteriorated, sagging and torn off in strips like a cadaver out of an anatomical textbook. Harry raised a hand to the peeling skin of the cheek, and the face smiled.
“If you please, sir, we’re of age. And about to be junior Aurors,” lied Hermione with a dead serious face. “If you prefer to speak with our supervisor, I could send an owl to Auror Diggory, though we’d be taking him away from a live investigation.”
With that, the creature took a few jolting steps forward, and before Harry knew it, they were off. The small, pale shape of Luna quickly became a distant dot as the powerful wings of the creature overtook the air around them, and all he could do was hold on to its neck for dear life. He watched the castle until it was obscured by clouds and prayed to god this thing knew where it was flying.
“Whatever happened to deductive reasoning?” drawled Draco with a sharp edge to his voice. “Get a grip, Granger, you’re starting to sound unhinged.”
Minerva gazed back at the house, which stuck out in dark contrast to the starry night sky. The brickwork was angular and solid, the grass was neatly trimmed. She had thought it was an ugly, squat thing by day, but in the night there was perhaps something cosy about it. Maybe he did belong here? There were certainly worse places in the world to be.
“Definitely,” said Harry, seeing his opportunity. “In fact, I’d be keen to hold on to the wand this weekend to practise. That is, I think I’ve got my magic under a decent amount of control at this point.”
Harry tried to push back from the connection, but the pain in his scar burned and the muscles in his jaw strained over clenched teeth. He could head Luna far away telling him they should get out of the forest, they weren’t safe.
“Harry’s safe now,” said Dumbledore, nodding slowly. “And it is imperative we cast the Fidelius soon, to keep it that way.”
“Run and fetch the ‘55 Bordeaux, will you?” He summoned four crystal glasses from the sideboard, which came whizzing into his hand as he turned to the others. “I’ve always wanted a reason to open this.”
Hermione moved defensively in front of Harry, which was pointless because he was only slightly obscured by the bushy cloud of hair. “Well, Professor McGonagall said—”
It was this motivation that enabled him to hit a par on the next hole, which got the attention of both DuPonts squarely back in his direction. He smirked at Harry.
As he approached, she grabbed two handfuls of his shirt and tugged him towards her, planting a big kiss on his mouth. She smelled like floral lotion and vanilla cake, and the kiss immediately paled in comparison to Potter who’d smelled of whiskey and mint. It wasn’t altogether unpleasant, although she had some kind of syrupy lip gloss on that made their lips stick together too long, but her cheek was soft and her hands trailed playfully around his neck.
Draco craned his neck over her shoulder to read a passage titled “The strange case of a mis-diagnosed Obscurial; 1968,” accompanied by a picture of a witch in a turtleneck and vest, speaking to a small child on a tufted ottoman.
“That’s ridiculous, Blaise,” said Pansy with a smile playing at the corner of her mouth. “Everyone knows you can’t run a business with only Veelas. They’re terrible with money.”
They turned to rummage through the trunk again, but Harry’s hand paused on a bundle of fabric. “This must be the cloak,” he said, holding it up, but no sooner did he put his hand through it than it completely disappeared. “Woah!”
“You know how my parents can be. I’m sure they’ve scheduled my time home from the moment I arrive,” said Draco easily, picking up the paper he was reading and turning it deliberately to the next page.
“Two children investigating dark wizards in school?” mused Ollivander. “I’ve never heard of such a thing.”
“Granger’s right. If You-Know-Who is back, this is more than just some dark magic we can brush off. We’re talking about one of the most powerful wizards in the world here,” said Cedric.
“I already tried that,” snapped Hermione. “It’s unnaturally messy. I think we’ll just have to change the rest of him, maybe lighten the eyebrows.”
Harry pulled up a few chairs and Angelica struck up a conversation with Gemma despite her inability to utter anything longer than a few syllables. Harry tried to catch Draco’s eye, but he pretended to be engrossed in Angelica’s blathering, which involved a light card reading that predicted Blaise would wind up singing on a stage and Gemma would leave the party with someone famous.
“You wouldn’t make a bad Auror yourself, Granger,” said Cedric, turning to regard Hermione with an appreciative nod.
“Ooh, this sounds promising; the Arrow of Artemis, once thought to wield godlike powers. Though we’d have to go to Greece for it,” said Luna. “There’s also the planchette of Aleister Crowley which was used to commune with the departed, although… wait nevermind, this one might be a fraud.”
“Unbelievable,” said Draco, looking between the two as Harry grinned mischievously. “Where’s Granger with her vision charm? You both need your eyes checked.”
“You’ll catch your death if you don’t take the cold seriously,” she said, her knowing chestnut eyes giving him a once over before returning to her book. “I suppose the locket isn’t giving you as much trouble today? Just let me know when you want to trade off.”
He caught the boy around the elbow, which was slimy with sun cream, and dragged him back to shore, depositing him on the sand where he lay coughing and hacking. In a flash, the horse-faced woman was running at the other boy with a towel, helping him steadily to his feet and guiding him back to a beach blanket where she started pulling out snacks.
“In fact, I always had a sneaking suspicion she liked you better than me,” said Tonks, linking elbows with Draco. “Hang on.”
There was a light knock on the door, and it cracked open ajar. A mop of messy black hair peaked in over the side.
“That’s Potter for you!” said Blaise with a laugh. “Not a care in the world for his own safety. Did you hear Calderone was let off on appeal last week? Slimy bastard. They kept it out of the papers somehow, but the word went around the Ministry pretty quickly.”
“Cedric will Apparate you within walking distance, and then the rest of us will be right behind you,” said Hermione.
“Ouch, what’s the rush, Hermione?” asked Harry as she yanked him towards an alleyway. “We already got what we needed.”
“Quirinus Quirrell was a professor of Muggle Studies at Hogwarts for several years before he took a sabbatical to travel the world, returning after a nasty run-in with vampires in the Black Forests,” said Cedric, laying out a few clippings of evidence from the file. “The experience bolstered him to apply for the Defence Against the Dark Arts position which he taught in 1991.”
Why was he here? Why had he dropped his broom and come running the moment he felt the Galleon grow warm in his pocket? And why was he carrying the blasted thing in the first place, hoping for the time to come that he might get a chance to make amends with the stupid bespectacled git?
At the mention of the name, a jolt went through the room. Hermione gasped, Cedric stopped his pacing, and even Luna who had been quiet till now looked up with round, unblinking eyes. Harry glared around the room, waiting for someone to tell him something useful.
“I intend to find out everything there is to know about Voldemort,” said Harry. Malfoy physically took a step back at the name. “It’s more than just the death of my parents. It’s personal now. If he’s coming after me I deserve to know why, and if he’s going to try and make some example out of me I need to figure out how to defeat him.”
The bard cocked an eyebrow at Draco, looking incredibly cocky for someone who had just delivered a horrible line of poetry. He blinked expectantly, clearly awaiting praise.
Whether it was the drone of wind in his ears or the morose news that had shrouded the morning, the crowd was quieter than he had ever known them to be. The announcer, some Ravenclaw boy, was clipped, speaking factually to the action on the field, and even the teams had given up their usual trash talking. And despite an early Slytherin lead, Hufflepuff were fighting their way back to even the score.
As he revealed just how close his family was to the Dark Lord, their concerned expressions fell into ones of utter disappointment. He told them everything; how the Malfoys were harbouring Voldemort at Wisteria Hall, that his father was the guardian of the final Horcrux, and that Draco had only recently decided to shed his ties to the old way.
Of course it did. He wouldn’t throw away his friendships on a stupid fight. There was more at stake than that. And the truth of the matter was, he did trust them.
Just as he was about to come back with something thoroughly inappropriate for the breakfast table, he heard a small cough behind him, and the two turned to see Granger standing with a load of books in her arms.
“How can you tell?” asked Harry, over the sound of spells sizzling through the air while Draco and Cedric taunted and threatened each other in equal measure.
“I was aware of the goings on last night, but it remains unclear to me whether this has accelerated our plans,” said Draco trying to catch the dull gaze of Snape at the house table, who was refusing to look in his direction.
“If it’s that bad, we should take him to the hospital wing,” said Harry, looking back and forth between the group. “What is it?”
“Hey Granger,” he said, quirking an eyebrow. “I bet this will look great on your Department of Mysteries application.”
He didn’t even stop to consider that Harry’s assumption could be right. After all, it wasn’t as though being “saved by love” was real. That was just a fairytale that mothers told their children to keep them feeling safe. Wasn’t it?
The group carried on this way for a while, winding through the streets of London past crumbling office buildings and empty storefronts. All the while Draco’s mind was spinning, wondering what answers he was meant to get out of the diadem’s vision.
“Leave it to Al to give me one last puzzle to solve,” said Harry fondly, pulling a few items off the top layer of the box and holding up a spindly silver instrument that looked like a stick bug. “He was always telling me crazy stories about his life, I just never could have imagined they were about this place.”
he cried out, feeling a blast erupt from his wand and strike Charlotte who screamed and writhed. Seeing the pain in her face, the spell faltered and she was released into a heap on the floor.
“I suppose… If it’s in his best interest.” She withdrew her wand to begin preparations for the spell, casting a nervous glance back up at the squat windows and glossy shrubbery of number four. “Promise me we’ll look after him?”
Massive thanks to my beta, Honeybeet, without whom none of this would make any sense. Seriously so lucky to have you as my banter coach, kiss consultant, and checker of obscure lore minutiae. You’re the best, HB!
“Harry Potter,” said Harry, feeling incredibly silly to be shaking hands while dressed in his pyjamas.
“The lyin’ arse!” choked out Hagrid, big tears now welling in his eyes. “How could he do that to Lily an’ James? An’ little Harry here, huh?” He sniffled loudly and rubbed at his nose with the sleeve of his coat. “And I almost fell for it! He tried to take Harry as well, but I told him I was bringing him to you. Strict orders.”
“Alas, there are wishes even beyond my powers to grant,” said Voldemort, gesturing to a crumpled shape in front of the fireplace. “The boy will not survive. And he does not deserve to.”
“I was thinking it might be nice to go on a date first Hogsmeade weekend. You know, spend the afternoon at Madame Puddifoot’s. That sort of thing?” said Pansy, batting her lashes so feverishly that Draco had to wonder if she had a bug in her eye.
shouted Harry, as the burst of magic hit him, drawing his wand down the blade. Like a funnel of his magical energy, flames of Fiendfyre licked out like a blowtorch, turning the goblin wrought steel white-hot and glowing.
Sure, he was a half decent bloke who probably deserved more than his lot. And sure, Draco was handling his double agent role less adeptly than he would have thought. But was he really going to let a pair of green eyes lure him off track on his ascent to power?
As Draco focused on the leaves of a small sprout, a tiny face blinked into life. It turned up to him, its black eyes glistening, and a few leaves fluttered on the stalk.
Draco froze. How much had Harry sensed of his apprehension about the Dark Lord’s presence in the Manor?
“Harry,” she said into his neck. “I was so worried. There were people coming around the house and messages being delivered by birds and they said you were in hospital and might never come back. What happened to you?”
Al’s portrait leaned forward and handed the wand down the foreground of the painting, and as it reached the corner of the frame where Umbridge’s outstretched hand waited, it peeled off at the tip and a solid, three-dimensional wand emerged.
“You’re looking very happy lately,” said Hermione, as she and Draco pushed a trolley down the frozen foods aisle of a Muggle supermarket. “Care to share?”
“Our Lord continues to grow stronger with each renewed attempt,” said Lucius pointedly. “But you are correct, the
Draco lingered at the end of the meeting, noticing that Hermione was trying to stall by packing her bag slowly, and having a sneaking feeling that she was about to reveal some key information to McGonagall. He followed the others out of the room as Luna talked animatedly to Cedric about common causes for Wrackspurt infestations, and posted up in the alcove near the classroom, with an Extendable Ear snaking out from under the door.
Draco was so busy trying to find another excuse to spend time with Harry after the defence session that he nearly forgot that he had promised to take Pansy on a date over the first Hogsmeade weekend.
“You can have it if you like,” said Hermione quickly. “The book, that is. It might be nice to get to know what he was like in our world.”
Could he have been a relative of Harry’s; someone tasked with watching over him and ensuring he had a good childhood? If so, he’d done a ruddy awful job of it. Perhaps a Ministry official, or just a local Squib who sensed his magical signature. Hopefully not something more sinister, Draco found himself wishing. Potter had been through more than enough.
“Treason, my dear. Treason of the highest order,” said Umbridge, licking her finger to page through a hefty document that she tossed down in front of McGonagall. “Attempted collusion to overthrow the Ministry, racketeering with the vigilante group the ‘Order of the Phoenix,’ reckless endangerment of minors – you name it, really.”
Harry turned back to Voldemort, who stood alone, watching the battle between Dumbledore’s Army and his Death Eaters unfold in front of him. Only the snake, which coiled around its master’s legs, was by his side, as all others were occupied with the fight. Harry squared up to him, tuning out the noise of the battle behind him as the buzzing in his ears began.
In a moment of lunacy, Draco thought of suggesting they leave the Room of Requirement and get out of the castle for the afternoon, but he stopped himself before he could say anything stupid. He wasn’t ready for Potter to be discovered just yet, he reminded himself. That was still too important of a card to play.
Now was their chance. If they could leave after the Aurors, they may make it out without being seen. Harry shook Draco, and he nodded, understanding the plan. They began creeping around the perimeter of the room, careful to step over any of the spindly silver instruments and papers that littered the ground.
“It’s fine, Hermione,” said Harry, walking towards the bed and pulling the robes off over his head. “No harm done. I’m more concerned that I have to keep using this old wand for defensive spells tomorrow.”
“Seems like a pleasant place for somewhere named the Forbidden Forest,” said Harry as the two passed through low-hanging branches, stepping on a mossy carpet and suddenly surrounded by the musical sounds of the night.
He found the Potions Master in his dim office, slowly marking papers and drawing long lines through sections of student work. Snape did not look up as he entered.
“This doesn’t have to end the same way,” said Voldemort. “Just tell me where you are. I’d very much like to meet you, face to face.”
As Harry and Hermione raced down the stairs, they could hear voices and the sound of the Floo flaring up in the fireplace. He flung his backpack over one shoulder as they reached the first floor landing, taking the stairs two at a time.
Draco headed for the door muttering something that sounded like “pointless,” but Harry grabbed his arm before he could leave.
“This is pointless, Hermione,” said Harry, scrubbing his hands through his hair. “The new wand isn’t working, the stupid match isn’t even pointy yet, and I still can’t understand why I need to learn this spell in the first place when you’re supposed to be teaching me defensive magic. Can’t we move on to curses already?”
Voldemort chuckled at this, his shoulders rising and falling under the dark robes he wore. “We may use that to our advantage yet,” he said. Then, fixing Draco with a more serious look, “That’s all then. No… surprises?”
“Well, if we assume he was a pure-blood, that will limit the pool of potential suspects substantially,” said Hermione. “The war was pretty much fought over the point.”
, barring a few brightness inconsistencies they were still working through, and starting on levitation. Hermione, however, had flat out refused to attempt the sparks again until Harry had been fitted with his proper wand.
“Once we get everyone loaded up, you’ll follow the map in the lead and I’ll take up the rear,” said Tonks, looking up into the sky where the moon was now visible and checking a Muggle watch on her wrist. “We don’t have much time.”
“Not long.” Luna rose to let Harry sit on the couch. “There might be a lot going on – just try and focus on the answers you need.”
Draco backed out of the memory abruptly, unsure how long he’d be able to stomach the image of a man he knew to be dead, likely at the hands of the Dark Lord himself.
“McGonagall thinks he’s still alive,” said Harry. “If I survived once, maybe I’m immune to the curse. Maybe I can fight him.”
“McGonagall’s one to watch out for.” Malfoy nodded. “I wouldn’t put it past her to try and exert control over where and when you go. Just stay on her good side. Make it so she doesn’t have any reason to say you’re not ready.”
He allowed the old man to work on the ring for a few minutes longer, until the spells started making hissing noises, like water being tossed on a hot pan. Finally, at a loud crack, Borgin stepped back, pushing the glasses to the top of his head.
Draco’s father was like a ghost moving through the halls, constantly on one task or another for the Dark Lord. Death Eaters came in and out of the house, sometimes gathering for council meetings in the library, other times running news of Ministry goings-on or stifling threats to the Dark Lord’s claim to power.
As Draco let Harry slip into his consciousness, he was reminded of their first session. It had been like a freefall, dropping through a patchwork of the most important points in Harry’s life. A skilled Legilimens would be able to lay out a curated collection of memories to peruse, but he wanted to see where Potter would take him, so he let them drift.
“It’s kind of like the Muggle equivalent of magic,” said Harry, realising he had not thought about programming or Salerni or Edinburgh in months, and feeling a pang of guilt for how easily the ambitions of his Muggle life had been written over. “You use a special vernacular to give commands, and if you do it well enough, you can build a machine that does anything.”
“But you are,” said Voldemort, rising. His long black robes draped to the floor around him, making him look part man, part shadow. “You are here because of a prophecy, are you not?”
A crystal clear memory of a confrontation in a bathroom floated poignantly to mind; Draco pointed his wand directly at Harry with pure malice in his eyes, began to utter a curse, and Harry slashed the air with a jinx, sending ribbons of blood spurting from his face and chest. And then, a moment that made Harry turn ice cold: Malfoy in the astronomy tower. Pointing his wand at an unarmed Dumbledore.
“Are you mental? There’s three of them,” said Draco, shooting off stunning spells. “The Thestrals know where they’re going, I can help.”
Draco crept back into the common room late that night, his mind spinning over the last few hours with Harry. He’d finally accessed the memory that might hold the clues to the Potter’s defeat of the Dark Lord on that fateful night, and it had been utterly useless.
“Come on. You could have everything you were before, none of the mess that we’ve caused. You’d still be the Quidditch captain and all that.”
“Come now,” said Draco with a smile. “You’re going to have to ask a lot more nicely if you want me to teach you.”
The conversation shifted to the others telling stories that were quintessential representations of their house, and ultimately devolving into highlights from their time at Hogwarts. Cedric told of the harrowing challenges of winning the Triwizard Tournament, which had all of them on the edge of their seats. Even the other three, who had witnessed the events themselves, had never heard the entire story of the mermaids of the black lake or the dangers of the maze.
He couldn’t believe the things he was hearing. Potter and his little group had managed to figure out more about the Dark Lord in a few afternoons than Draco had pieced together over years. His survival after breaking into Hogwarts, his sustenance on unicorn blood in his weakest days, hell, Potter had even figured out his mental link – though he was still unaware that the periwinkle blue room he was seeing was the drawing room at Wisteria Hall, a Malfoy family property.
It was all making sense; McGonagall had said his parents had fought against the Dark Lord and fallen. She’d just omitted the part where they had been killed in cold blood for standing up for their beliefs. And the part where Harry was some freak of nature that both sides might want to exploit. It dawned on him that Petunia wasn’t the only one who’d been deceiving him.
Snakes really were peculiar creatures, thought Harry. To have no desire to return to the place where she had grown up, to so quickly abandon the one that had cared for her enough to save her from Dudley’s gang. And yet, she wasn’t wrong. The castle was fascinating, and Hermione, Draco, Cedric, and Luna, while strange, were incredible. In another life he would have given everything to have been able to spend his years at Hogwarts, among these people. His friends.
“We could, erm, go up to Sirius’s room? I wouldn’t mind listening to a record or two,” suggested Harry, feeling like the idea was a stupid one even as it came tumbling out of his mouth.
Well, this had certainly not been how he was expecting his first meeting with the legendary boy to go. He’d have to see what Snape knew of the matter. He turned on his heel and headed for the dungeon.
“That’s not how Al told it, but that version sounds way better,” said Harry with a laugh, dropping a few books back in the chest and turning to face Draco instead. “What was he really like?”
“It’s just an experiment,” said Draco, lying easily. “Sometimes having someone force their way in can cause the mind to leap to places you’re subconsciously protecting. A good Legilimens is like a pickpocket, spotting your hand as it darts to protect your prize possessions. If it doesn’t work, we can always go back to mind mapping.”
“Let’s start with something simple to build control, like the first time you rode a broom or your favourite Christmas present or something,” suggested Draco, waving a careless hand.
He probably should have been surprised by these words, but somehow he wasn’t. Knowing what he did of Draco’s past, the things he had kept from the group, Hermione’s suspicions. They had all been leading him to an inevitable conclusion.
“How about something that doesn’t end violently?” suggested Malfoy as they returned dizzyingly to the small room.
The pale woman who had greeted them guided them through the club towards a booth near the stage, passing crowded tables with beautifully dressed, boisterous groups of witches and wizards, who reclined over the plush furniture and sipped elaborate looking drinks. The drone of conversation could hardly be heard over the steady beat of the music. Other pale, slightly shimmering women could be seen pouring bottles and dancing gracefully throughout the crowd.
He rummaged in his school bag for a sack of items he’d taken off one of the insufferable Weasleys, certain he’d caught them using some makeshift listening device. Discovering a fleshy ear on a string, he held one end to his own ear, which adhered like a suction cup, and slid the other end through a crack under the door.
If he were on good terms with Draco, which he was not, there would probably be a Bond joke in there somewhere that they would both find funny, but as it was, they were on strictly working terms.
Voldemort turned his red eyes on Wormtail, who started stuttering. “W-well yes, b-b-but I have on good authority that this map is genuine. Besides which, our own Lord is positive of the boy’s existence, aren’t you m-my Lord?”
“I thought you were going to teach me how to fight,” said Harry, his frustration building as he pictured Charlotte in danger and his wand sending out a pitiful stream of fireworks that fizzled to the ground.
“I only meant,” Draco continued quickly, adopting a more sympathetic tone, “For the exercise, we were starting out somewhere you felt safe, right?”
“The others know. I told them finally, about what I've been hiding,” said Draco, placing the king back on the board. “It’s all out in the open now.”
“Where do they have those Jaffa cakes I like?” asked Draco in an attempt to steer the conversation from going down a dangerous path.
“Pesky bird,” said Umbridge, storing the wand safely in her purse and clasping it shut. “Dawlish, gather the others. Tell them we’re moving into phase two. All the professors are to be confined to their quarters while they await questioning. Take the students back to the dorms. We’ll lock down the school once the Dementors arrive.”
Hermione narrowed her eyes in his direction but didn’t respond, then turned up her nose to stalk off, nearly running into a waifish form that was crouched by a low hanging portrait.
“I just mean, Harry’s so interesting, I would have thought he’d go for someone a bit more outspoken,” she said. “Is she his usual type?”
Draco and Harry shared a nervous glance, but Luna barrelled on. “It was like I was looking through my own eyes, but things were different. Voldemort had already returned and they were rounding up Muggle-borns and half-bloods. No one was at Hogwarts anymore. I was with my father and a group of other rebels working on how to overtake St Mungo’s, where they were holding people captive and—”
“A Thestral,” she began as they walked down the dim hallway. “Is a very rare type of magical creature. Most people live their lives never seeing one because they avoid populated areas, but there’s a tame herd in the Forbidden Forest.”
“It’s true,” said Cedric. “The Ministry is growing divided. They’ve been suppressing information about these investigations for so long, they may already be turned. It could be any day that we start seeing unrest in the general wizarding public.”
She sidled up to him in the booth and was now talking incessantly about other acquaintances of note, which Draco was ignoring entirely.
“Not sure what you’re hinting at, Granger,” said Draco, bumping her back. “I’ve always been known to appreciate the finer things in life.”
He needed to take the opportunity to ask for what he really wanted before he lost his nerve altogether. “Will you show me what happened? Maybe I can spot something that you haven’t seen.”
He walked over to Draco and came to rest his elbows on the railing next to him. This close, Draco could see the lights of the city reflected in his round lenses. His face was flushed, and he swayed slightly, undoubtedly drunker than Draco himself at this point.
“It’s not that,” said Luna, tucking her hair behind her ears as a pretty flush appeared on her cheeks. “I like Neville. He’s changed a lot this year, and he’s really smart and good with plants.”
“Just because you can’t see them, doesn’t mean they aren’t there,” said Luna, doodling idly in the margins of the
“Well, another few days wouldn’t put us much farther behind,” said McGonagall with a curt nod to Harry, which he and Hermione understood to indicate their swift departure.
Harry found himself in the cupboard under the stairs. The place had a nostalgic familiarity to it now, and Draco’s presence was a comfort more than anything. Now that Draco had seen Al, the visions of his shadow self, everything, there was nothing left to hide, really. Draco knew as much about him as anyone had in his entire life.
“That he was resurrected by Quirrell and that he lives today, protected by his followers. As Dumbledore tried to make known,” said Draco, pretending to be preoccupied with refilling the glass of alihotsy and peppermint. “And Potter’s got the mad notion that our Lord has a weakness. But that’s ridiculous, right? No one can defeat—”
When the door burst open, Harry wheeled around expecting to see a familiar cloud of Hermione’s bushy hair, but it was Draco, looking completely winded and dripping wet in his green and black Quidditch uniform. Harry’s heart gave an uncomfortable lurch.
Far from being discouraged, Ollivander continued to grow more frenzied with each failed attempt. There were a few wands which reacted rather violently, shooting off showers of sparks. One had a greenish goo that dripped from the end, even when replaced in its box. “Kelpie hair. Always an inferior core in my opinion,” piped Ollivander, brimming with glee.
“Well, I just thought, how could I miss an opportunity to face off with my old Quidditch rival, you know?” Harry replied with a glint in his eye. Draco dropped his hand.
“Snape, no!” yelled Draco, dragging him back to the chair. “Shrub, get Madam Pomfrey, tell her it’s an emergency.”
“To be sure,” said Draco, thinking the loss was certainly not so great for his kind. “I imagine there will be changes to my Head Boy duties to keep things under control. Should we have Padma here as well?”
, and they popped open with satisfying clicks. He silently thanked Hermione for all her boring, if not practical, lessons.
Turning into the shop, Draco was greeted with a musty smell of old relics and dusty books. Borgin was loyal to the family and to the brethren, but Draco didn’t know him well. He’d only accompanied his father to the store on a few occasions to negotiate the price of dark artefacts the family tried to unload a few years back when the Ministry was nosing into their affairs.
“Angelica’s father offered me a job actually,” said Draco, not sure why he was continuing on this line of conversation, if only to prove to Harry that DuPont had thought him capable of the task.
The threads of a plan started forming as he took a few more turns down snowy streets. Before he knew it, he was at a park, with a canopy of bare trees overhead. On a small stretch of brickwork, three wrought iron tables sat out. Two of them had old men seated across from each other, playing chess and bundled up against the cold.
“No, if it’s not poison, that’ll put him over the edge,” said Draco, his focus locked on Cedric as his eyelids fluttered. “Any Alihotsy?”
“You’d think the wizarding world would have invented a spell with search functionality,” said Harry. “Maybe there is no cure for it. It’s been a lot more under control lately, maybe it’s just something I have to live with.”
“Yes, well, I’m quite beside myself,” said Draco, with a confident smile. He hadn’t been expecting it till the end of the evening, but he was pleased that Angelica had formally accepted the match. He could finally rest easy, knowing that his plans had come to fruition. “I couldn’t be happier.”
At that moment, the git turned around with a broad smile on his face. Draco froze as he felt a flutter of something that must have been hatred deep in his chest. Harry caught his eye and winked before turning and sloping off towards his ball. Draco was furious to end two strokes behind Harry as their scores on the first hole were tallied.
He smiled after her and attempted to exude a demeanour of nonchalance as he watched her line up her next shot, but internally his mind was whirring away, calculating how all the pieces of his plan would fit together with this new request. He’d been hoping he could ward off any intimacy until they were a few months down the track. Angelica had seemed so conservative at first glance and had been perfectly demure at the Manor.
He looked at Harry, dark hair falling into his eyes, who was so terribly hopeful it left an ache inside his chest.
“I’m saying this changes things,” said Harry. “It’s not just about the people we care about anymore. It’s up to us to save the world.”
An impossible task, to be sure, thought Draco. They were kidding themselves if they thought they could teach Harry anything more than basic charms in such a short time. McGonagall was too smart for that. She must have something else planned.
“We’re taking them on buses?” asked Draco incredulously. Of all the daft ideas, this had to be the worst.
“Hi,” said Gemma in a weak, breathy voice. She glanced over at the group with half-lidded eyes looking entirely unimpressed and then turned to look distractedly out into the foyer, as though trying to spot a more interesting group to sit with.
“Thanks,” said Harry, actually feeling grateful for the git for the first time. Malfoy’s self-confident smile wavered, then fell into his standard, neutral expression.
“Harry’s right. There has to be something about him out there. People don’t just appear out of thin air.” Hermione gently lifted Ivy out of the crease of the book so she could toss it aside.
Harry paused. Draco had been acting so much more at ease of late, he didn’t want to push him back into his shell of status and superiority. “It’s possible to be loved and feared,” he said finally. He should know, after all.
“So modest all of a sudden.” Tonks rolled her eyes “If I didn’t keep an eye on him, they’d already have him down at HQ with the rest of them, planning the next wave of the resistance. But he knows the front lines are where we can make the biggest difference today.”
And for some reason it gave him great satisfaction to imagine him quite small and withered. Perhaps too caught up in “video games” and hiding out from the Dark Lord to take in the fresh air and sunshine. Draco smirked to himself at the thought.
“Is that a premonition or guess, Darling?” Draco chimed in. Angelica raised her eyebrows but smiled at the challenge.
He still wasn’t sure if his plan would work, but he had to keep Voldemort talking long enough for the others to get into place. Too short and he might not have the backup he desperately needed to make it out of this room alive, too long and he might antagonise Voldemort into doing something rash. And above all, he needed to figure out where Draco was being kept.
“Right,” said Harry, casting his eyes to the pavement as they walked and trying to get it all out as quickly as possible. “It seems impossible, but what if I told you… it was real. My parents were magic, and somehow I’ve ended up with a power like theirs. I still don’t understand it all, but for some reason I have people after me, which is why—”
“Potter can give his own identity away, but we can’t,” said Cedric, realisation dawning on them all.
“Oh! Didn’t see you there, my boy,” said the bard brightly, propping a leg up on a nearby bench and strumming a chord on his lute. “I’m busy provoking the muse, as it were. Working on my crowning achievement – though I’ve only just started. It’s sure to be legendary. Care to hear it?”
“Do you think it’s something your mother will be able to understand?” Pansy asked, eyes darting back to the scribbled mess of a letter.
“It was luck,” said George, leading the way to the back. “I’ll never forgive Ginny for coming down with the fleurian flu the week of our last game.”
Draco glanced back at Gemma, slightly impressed by her endurance, but mostly wondering how she was still going on about herself. At any rate, he wasn’t dying to go anywhere else at the moment and at least he could think through the issues presented to him at his afternoon’s meeting while simultaneously tuning her out entirely. He sensed a pause in her babbling and smiled and nodded in her direction while signalling a waiter for another whiskey. She carried on about the difference between casting spells in Greek versus English, and he turned his mental energy to the problem at hand.
“Yes, but we don’t know where the real one went. Voldemort could already have it in his possession,” said Draco.
“Hm?” Her head popped back up and she fixed him with a look of concentration. “Oh, it’s nothing. You’re doing well.”
“Excellent,” said Hermione, looking like she’d bit a lemon. “We’ll alternate times depending on our class schedules.”
Harry’s hand closed around the cold metal and a sense of foreboding chilled him, remembering the way the locket had hung heavy around his neck in the diadem vision, but he pushed it to the back of his mind. “Draco said to contact someone called Nymphadora Tonks. He says she can help us reach the Order.”
“You have to say that because you’re already losing,” she said playfully, knocking into him. He snaked his arm around her waist and gave her a quick squeeze.
“If it’ll make you go away,” he said, brushing past her towards the side exit. He could hear Hermione’s quick steps following him and wheeled on her once he was in the side corridor, well out of earshot of the Slytherin table.
For once in his life, he let his anger consume him, embracing the wave of magic as it pulsed through him. He had no idea whether this would work, but it was the only chance he had. It was ending Voldemort’s reign today or die trying.
“Oh, it’s nothing really. Merely theoretical,” lied Harry, hoping that Luna would not run tattling on him for something that was clearly against the rules of magical safety. Her eyes flew over the matrix he’d scrawled out and he tried to tug it gently from her hands. “I was just about to throw it in the bin, actually.”
Draco hummed in agreement, trying to concentrate on deciphering the document in his hands. He could feel Greenacre’s eyes scrutinising him from across the desk.
“Yes,” he said. Then picked his head back up to look at Pansy, who met his eyes with a look of hesitant concern.
“Ready,” said Cedric, who was nearly unrecognisable under the glamours. He clapped Harry on the back and turned to follow Hermione toward the fireplace, his Auror robes fanning out behind him.
Minerva tried to see the humour in this, but she could only support Albus’s outlandish plans so far. Surely there were more capable hands than those of Rubeus Hagrid for this task. Silently she was fuming, but the elderly wizard next to her seemed not to notice, or was too interested in the lemon candies he was pulling out of his pocket to care. But it wasn’t till he announced his intention to leave the child with its Muggle relatives of number four that she finally spoke out.
“Come with me,” said his father, steering him down the corridor towards the north wing of the house. “The Dark Lord has requested your presence most urgently.”
He tried to answer, thinking she’d be able to piece it together if she remembered the Dark Lord’s recently renewed interest in the Potter rumours, but instead let out a groan at the shooting pain behind his eyes. The charm was definitely keeping him from giving away too much, but even a sliver of information today could become clear tomorrow with more context.
The wand tip sputtered and a few sparks crackled to the ground. Hermione yelped, but Harry quickly stamped them out with his trainer. “Whoops,” he said with a weak smile. “Don’t make me go back to the quill.”
Snape chuckled unexpectedly. “If I didn’t play the memories out in the Pensieve, I would only play them over and over in my mind. Madness would find me just the same.”
over the entire memory of their conversation. He could feel his throat closing up but stifled any tears as his mother’s eyes fluttered open and she said, “Darling!”
What was more worrying about this lapse of judgement was how close he was letting Potter get. He had guessed there was something off about the Manor. Draco was only fortunate he wasn’t a better Legilimens, otherwise he would have known the truth. The presence that had been a constant at the castle these last many years and the master that had taught Draco the very skill he was passing along to Harry was none other than the Dark Lord himself.
“I hate to say it, but we’re not making enough progress.” Cedric folded his arms resignedly. “Maybe it’s time we call for help. We should try contacting the Order of the Phoenix.”
“Toying with a mental link is not something you want to do,” said Draco decisively. “Something like what you’re describing is incredibly rare, I wouldn’t even know how to recommend controlling it, there’s no way to guarantee he’s not looking back the other way.”
“Hello Minerva, you seem to have a problem with your door,” said the woman, her eyes bulging slightly at the attempt at cheerfulness in her voice. “Didn’t you hear me knocking?”
Harry was immediately recognised as he made his way through, returning nods of greeting and sharing a few quick words with the Seeker of the Falcons, who jumped up to clap him on the shoulder as he passed. He seemed to be acquainted with most of the patrons in the room, who greeted him not out of awe but with a certain cursory familiarity. Harry, for his part, seemed genuinely happy to see them and be seen. It seemed slightly out of character for Harry, who in Draco’s memory, had often tried to slip out of the limelight, despite
Draco laid down on top of the covers, staring blankly at the ceiling. Sirius being a traitor, he knew, but Regulus’s death had been a mystery. And yet, all this time, the brothers had been fighting for the same thing. Sirius was loud about it and became a target of the Dark Lord’s, whereas Regulus might have been the only one to figure out where the Dark Lord truly got his power, but he failed by going at it alone.
In fact, he hadn’t been able to get the bespectacled idiot out of his head for days. He kept mulling over the bizarre conversation they’d had — the circumstances around his exit from the Auror force, his conspiratorial riffing on Lucius’s business dealings. And then there was something about this foretold betrayal. Further to Draco’s annoyance, he’d had a dream where the Knight of Wands, the third card in Angelica’s spread, had come riding up to him over a golf course and raised his visor only to turn out to be Harry bloody Potter.
“You put on a hell of a show of it,” said Cedric, crossing his arms over his Auror uniform. “Fighting Death Eaters with grade one spells. Not many would have survived as long as you did.”
“Then we’ll figure out how to get our hands on some Basilisk venom,” said Harry impatiently. “But that’s not the objective of this mission. The longer we wait, the greater chances that Voldemort fortifies his defences on the remaining Horcruxes. It’ll work, it has to.”
Draco followed her gaze to the wall behind Lockhart, which was plastered with framed newspaper clippings, signed photos, and book covers, all bearing Lockharts beaming face. Some waved frantically at the students, some grinned ear to ear in a way that looked almost painful. One was looking away until Draco realised it was just waiting for the right moment to throw a dashing glance over its shoulder.
“Not so fast.” Hermione crossed her arms. “If we’re going to keep up a lie to McGonagall that we’re still teaching you, you’re going to need to keep up your studies. There will be no overthrowing of the dark regime unless you stay on curriculum. Deal?”
Draco was floored. How could he have thought mere hours ago that this man was of the same ilk as Arthur Wesley? “So the Pharma business isn’t about helping muggles, it’s about—”
“Oh, it’s exceedingly dangerous,” said Luna, swinging her arms as she walked. “There are all sorts of deadly creatures in here; Hinkypunks, Hippogriffs, even centaurs will kill a wizard who wanders into their domain.”
“I should think we both know who cast it.” Borgin’s eyes narrowed. “Just as I know many who would pay a pretty price for this ring.”
“Yes, thank you, Shrub,” said Severus, accepting the phial. “I do not intend to make a habit of it.”
Ollivander opened the box with a flourish as his hands moved deftly across the wand, which seemed to hum with a magical energy. Harry accepted it with care, praying it wouldn’t let off a bang and send the old man flying.
“How could you?” he asked over shuddering breaths. “How could you do that to Charlotte? You had to want to!”
Hermione looked just as surprised as he felt to hear the words. “Oh. Well, have you tried sharing a memory from your end? A bit of reciprocity might help him feel like he’s not so alone.”
casting had much improved since the previous Friday, and the wands themselves had a certain hum to them that felt altogether different.
“For you, anything,” said Draco, keeping his eye on Hermione and Luna, who were still talking in hushed voices.
Harry must have read the passage a hundred times, each time wondering what his parents could have done to make themselves targets to such an attack.
“Like he’ll ever come around to it,” Draco scoffed. If the day ever came where Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy put old arguments to rest, he’d donate a thousand galleons to the Save the Hippogriff Foundation.
“No, no, this won’t do. We’ll never find one here,” the portrait muttered, angrily striking out a sentence.
Even in Defence against the Dark Arts (which he and his friends had taken for a laugh), Lockhart had assigned a detailed review of all curses, hexes, and jinxes referenced in the first 12 chapters of
Hermione took a deep breath and squared up to him. “Look, I know what you’re thinking, but now’s not the time to be hasty. Let’s think things through with Cedric when he gets back. None of us want Draco to be over there alone but—”
Draco knew he ought to tell the others about the diary, but convinced himself that it was pointless to do until they had a way to destroy the damn thing. Hermione’s book gave little insight into how to do just that, and the experiments they were able to set off in the house resulted in little more than a singed rug for their troubles.
What was happening? He’d come out on this balcony to find Harry, and possibly to tell him something quite personal and vulnerable, and here they were in a stupid spat again. In the same breath, he was feeling gutted by Harry’s disapproval and determined to prove his superiority. His heart was beating in his ears, or maybe that was just the ridiculously loud music.
Harry said nothing, but he could feel the Dark Lord’s presence pressing on his mind. He tried to put up a preliminary barrier of occlusion, but it wasn’t necessary. Voldemort could guess whatever Harry was thinking better than he was able to hide it.
She hummed a little noise of triumph, planting another tacky kiss on his lips and sitting up to her full height. She stared down at him with heavy-lidded eyes, biting her lip. He rested his hands on her hips, bracing himself and trying to recall the feeling of holding Potter in the alley. It wasn’t the same.
“I know it’s late, but it’s urgent.” He attempted to unlock the door but it held fast. Snape must have really had it with his intrusions. He thought about twisting Snape's arm – surely he would open the door if he thought Lucius would hear about it. But he was too exhausted for threats.
Draco’s head snapped in Angelica’s direction, but she merely beamed back at the group and patted his arm.
The leaves rustled as he entered under an ivy-covered archway, and a woman, crouching over a low planter, turned to look at him. The normally placid face of a young Narcissa Malfoy broke into a wide grin as he approached. Her hair was pulled back into a messy chignon with a few stray pieces falling by her face, and her normally immaculate dress was patched with potting soil as she knelt down.
“I assume you are familiar, Mr Malfoy, with the events of 31 October, 1981, when a wizarding family opposed the Dark Lord, resulting in their demise and effectively ending the First Wizarding War?” asked McGonagall.
“No,” said Draco, his voice a harsh whisper. He rolled over to his back, glaring at the ceiling, knowing how Regulus must have felt when he realised the error of his ways. He would happily throw himself into a cave full of Inferi rather than go through the pain of coming clean. “I told you, I don’t deserve to be forgiven.”
“Oh, yeah, I was meaning to tell you – Cedric and I had a breakthrough,” said Harry, jumping up to grab some notes he and Cedric had scribbled out for her benefit. “It turns out that what I struggle with most is the really precise, fiddly magic, but I’m faring pretty well when it comes to large, sweeping spells like shields or blasting curses. Check it out,”
Harry paused. “Regulus knew the Dark Lord, too. And he faced him in his own way. Imagine what he and the Order could have accomplished together.”
Draco smiled thinly at this display of familial affection and took an obligatory bite of eggy toast. As much as he’d love to sit and reminisce, he was here for some very specific information.
“It’s okay, Draco,” said Pansy, in a soothing tone. “I’ve had my suspicions for a long time now. I see the way you look at other guys. The fact that you only want to snog but you want everyone else to believe we’re doing something else.”
Where would he go? It’s not like he would ever go back to his life at Privet Drive. Though he had been surprised how quickly Charlotte had assimilated back in Surrey after a period of recovery from the trauma of her capture.
Before he could get close, Harry jerked them out of the memory. His eyes flicked open with a gasp. He looked around, regaining his bearings and breathing in heavily.
Draco had kept a respectful distance since the discussion of Charlotte and his Marking ceremony, making Harry oscillate wildly between wanting to punch the daylights out of him or fall into his eyes again and relive a memory of a better time.
“I know,” said Luna, unphased by her dismissal. “Only, if you unfocus your eyes, they sometimes form strange shapes. Almost like letters or… runic symbols.”
As he said it, a renewed cry of energy emerged from the room behind him as a group of wizards came zooming through the open windows. At the head of the pack was a young witch with bright fuschia hair, shouting orders as a new stream of spells were launched into the crowd of black robes.
“You’re right, professor. I won’t make your same mistakes,” said Draco, drawing close. “Even if he hates me, even if Potter never speaks to me again. I will protect him.”
“Water drunk from the cup will restore the drinker to full health,” said Hermione, reciting from her artefact notes and filling the glass with an
“I’ll take that as a yes then,” said Pansy. Then with a renewed hush as she cast a quick glance around the room. “Draco, there’s no point tormenting yourself over this. The Dark Lord has made his position clear. You are to join his ranks as soon as possible. The only reason you’re even here is to continue to serve him in masquerading among these Muggle lovers and blood traitors. But you are favoured.”
Draco turned to the painting of the bard who was now sitting on his tree stump, tuning his lute. “Thanks for the advice,” he said, and headed towards the Potions Dungeon.
Harry was overcome with the urge to bury himself under his covers and never show his face again. He stared resolutely through Snape, hyper aware of the warmth emanating from the man at his side.
“Thank you for everything, Professor,” said Harry, laying a hand on top of her own and feeling as though he may never be able to truly express his gratitude.
Luna fixed Draco with a knowing look. “Come on. You’re telling me you don’t know what it’s like to like someone just because you do? Not because it makes logical sense, or because it’ll look good on paper – just because?”
“Be that as it may, I do have concerns,” said McGonagall, looking down her nose with a crease of worry between her brow. Or was it pity? “With a bit more time and guidance, we may be able to help you gain more control over your magic.”
“Give it a rest, Ganger,” said Draco, coming to join her by the window. “Watching won’t make him come back any faster.”
“Now is not the time to be threatening the Ministry, Minerva. Not from your position,” said Umbridge with a chuckle, withdrawing her wand and tapping it in her palm. “Dumbledore was a threat to the sanctity of our government and had to be stopped. I only wish I could have been the one to stop him. Alas.” Umbridge sighed wistfully.
“Is there an echo in here?” said DuPont, jabbing Draco in the ribs with his elbow. “Of course I would have thought you knew all about this. Angie said you wanted to talk to me about the old issues between our family. Though if I know Lucius, I’m sure he didn’t give you the full story — but I won’t speak badly of a man in Azkaban. And I’m happy to set the record straight.”
“It’s nothing really,” said Harry, straightening up and pushing his glasses back up his nose. “I’m happy to host you guys.”
Draco steered her back down to the cushions by one slim shoulder. “It’s good to see you, mother. But you don’t look well.”
Draco sat back on his knees with a sigh, looking up at Harry, who was still hovering over the arm of the couch.
“If you please, Professor. How much are you really expecting us to teach him in a few weeks’ time? We’ve spent nearly seven years here and we’re still mastering the finer points of our study.”
“Right, you must know exactly what it’s like,” said Harry, raising his eyebrows. “Look, if it’s all the same to you, I’d rather skip the part where we bond and go straight back to practising.”
“You’ve just received a message beyond the grave from one of the most powerful wizards in history,” said Draco. “Are you sure you don’t want to take a while to think this through?”
“Lemon Sherbet,” said Harry, hoping the password was recently unchanged. The Gargoyle dutifully leapt aside and the two of them raced up the moving stairs and into the office.
“But my Lord, he’s still only 17, practically a child. Surely he’s been punished—” Lucius spoke in clipped tones.
“Please, Draco. If you think I didn’t learn how to tell your lies years ago, you’re more of an idiot than I am,” she replied, brushing his hand away.
“About time you got here,” said a lanky redhead in Muggle clothes, who sauntered to the bar and pulled out two pint glasses. “You were about to miss happy hour.”
“Look at you,” said Harry with a grin. “I’d have thought you’d thrown your whole Muggle wardrobe out by now.”
Harry turned to the books scattered around, flipping through the pages, not even sure what he was looking for but certain he had to do something.
Draco sighed a shaky breath. His mother’s endorsement, and the fact that he might protect her from ever being penetrated again the way he was, was the last thing he needed to firm up his resolve.
He remembered the memory of the green flash he had seen through Harry’s eyes. The reason Voldemort had offered to spare her was not out of kindness, but out of some halfhearted dedication to a promise he’d made to Snape.
The Thestrals were patient and accommodating of their new riders. Draco was surprised how comfortable he was mounting the closest one and leading the pack out into the chilly night air.
“Who are you and what have you done with Granger?” said Draco as Hermione pulled her essay out of her school bag.
“What about this?” asked Harry, pointing to a footnote about the effects of long term magical suppression.
The two of them stood for a few moments longer, and Harry wondered if Draco would break the silence. As he was racing through something to say, Draco turned and headed for the kitchen.
“Stop!” yelled Draco, flying at Harry and grabbing him by the shoulders. “Don’t you get it? I will not survive this!”
“Exactly, we’re running out of time,” said Harry. “The longer he has Charlotte, the longer she’s at risk of serious injury.”
The thought suddenly occurred to him that there was a very real danger of something happening to one of them within the next 24 hours that would separate them, and he found himself climbing out of bed and standing awkwardly among Sirius’s old contraptions and motorcycle magazines. The risk that he had been so quick to write off for himself only a few hours ago now seemed unreasonable when applied to Draco.
“Right. Well, I think we’re ready to attempt the deep recollection work again,” said Draco, dragging them back to the task at hand. “Perhaps what was different about the first time we attempted this was that I was pushing you deeper. If you trust me, why don’t I try taking a more active role in guiding the direction of your memory this time.”
Luna and Neville were side by side with a handful of others, positioned in the shattered window frames, using the high ground to target spells into the fray below, as the cold night air blew in from behind. Among them was Kreacher, who yelled with as much fervour as the rest of them as he flung himself into battle.
“Harry, listen to me,” said Draco, taking control. “If all he’s seen are me and this room, your location is still safe. When the others get back, tell them what you’ve seen in the vision, and contact the Order. Send an owl to Nymphadora Tonks, she can help you.”
“I would have thought it was obvious,” said Draco, rising to lean against the apothecary cabinet Snape was sorting. “From what my father has said on the matter, it seems there is nothing more valuable to our Lord than knowledge of Potter’s existence except, perhaps, knowledge of how to destroy him.”
As he stared at Draco’s back, he had the funny feeling that he was forgetting something. There was a strange tickling at the back of his memory, like a song that was stuck in his head. Familiar, yet distant. He shook his head to clear the thought.
“Well it’s worth reading up on,” said Draco, flipping the newspaper back to the sports section and pointing to a picture of the Falmouth Falcons star Chaser scoring a ripper of a goal against the Kenmare Kestrels. “Maybe you can even follow a team that wins for a change.”
Draco didn’t realize a tear had fallen on his cheek until he was hurriedly wiping it away. The storm raging within him seemed to momentarily calm, and he was struck with a moment of clarity.
Draco started to say, “Not at all,” but the words were hardly out of his mouth before the Dark Lord was boring a hole into his skull. His whole body clenched as his mind was invaded and he bit down to keep from screaming out at the pain.
“Incredible,” said Harry, feeling that Rowena Ravenclaw would have been proud that after all this time it was uncovered by a clever, unconventional witch from her own house. Even from an arm's distance away, he could feel the powerful pull of its magic; a cool, intriguing feeling so different from the dark, sinking feeling of the ring.
“Why? I’m already caught up on the levitation practice she set me, see?” Harry pointed at a chair and said, “
“I can see you, boy,” he said in a low voice. The snake cocked its head lazily in the direction of the voice, and Harry could feel his hand resuming the stroking of the cool, smooth scales.
“Fine, if you must know, I’m meeting with Granger for tutoring. Pansy’s already aware. Any other opinions you care to make known, Blaise?” said Draco.
“Look, I can hear the judgement in your voice, but it’s not like that,” said Draco. “You’ve seen my childhood. I’m expected to mix with a very specific group of people. Marry one of them, carry on the legacy, you know how it works.”
Borgin looked disappointed at this but hastened to clear the cogs and bits of spring from the worktable as Draco laid down the bundle. Borgin cast a quick diagnostic charm on the parcel before touching it, and a dark green glow emanated from within.
When it was time for Harry’s turn, he took aim and gave a practice swing. His hair was whipping about in the wind, but being as it was always messy, it kept landing in attractively ruffled shapes.
“Time for you to grow up and stop playing the hero, Potter,” spat Draco. “Some of us are beyond saving.”
“That is assuming that they haven’t deactivated my badge,” said Cedric, accepting a biscuit from Kreacher and indicating a path on the map. “If they’re following protocol, they’ll have Ministry officers at the entrances of the school here and here, but the only Aurors are the four that stay close to Umbridge. We can expect them to be wherever she is, which at lunch time is probably in the Great Hall here.”
“Very astute,” she said pleasantly. “But I don’t want there to be any animosity between us on this. I want us to be friends. I know I can be just as much value to you as you are to me.”
Voldemort looked momentarily stunned, stumbling back a step as a flurry of Hogwarts robes came diving through the window. Pansy could be seen with two rows of students flanking her, shouting commands as they shot off nonverbal stunners in quick succession. A handful of students on brooms including Cedric, Theo, Ron, and his sister were diving and swooping, dropping what looked like fire crackers on clusters of silver-masked Death Eaters.
Draco would never forget the image of a misshapen child form, growing like a tumour over the shoulder of the man while Quirrell’s face hung slack, dead eyes staring into nothing while red eyes fixed on his own.
“I’ve had the best time,” Angelica gushed, wavering slightly on her feet. “But I’ve been waiting for you to get back. The night wasn’t complete without you.” She blinked slowly.
“There’s nothing in here!” said Hermione in a panic. “No dittany, no wormwood. Should I try mistletoe?” She pulled out a phial of white berries.
“Harry in the other world told me that story once when I asked him how he learned to speak Parseltongue,” said Luna matter-of-factly.
“There’s one in Dumbledore’s office,” said Cedric. “I’ve been in there to take statements from the old Headmaster’s portraits as well. No one’s using it.”
Draco sighed and rubbed a sleepy hand over his face. But like it or not, he was interested in what the cards had to say. Angelica raised her eyebrows expectantly.
“We don’t have time to argue. Teach me the Fiendfyre spell. I’ll destroy the Horcruxes and head there now.”
“You can’t fool me, boy,” snapped Voldemort. “You think you know me? I know you just as well. Raised by Muggles in a loveless home. Forced to suppress any magical ability. Deceived by your mentor until it was far too late and even then only bringing you into the fold long enough to learn a few disarming spells. I can read it plain as day on your face, though it’s helped to have a bit of unplanned insight.”
He ran his fingers across the worn stone pieces before shrinking them down and gently packing the set between two jumpers. His hand hesitated over the 33rd piece, an extra black king that Al had brought him over the summer during one of their last meetings. He probably didn’t need it. After all, it was almost identical to the other king, except that it held a large square shield carved out of some black gemstone.
“So you’ve only known Potter for the last few weeks?” said Draco, trying to put the pieces together and suddenly feeling the whiskey’s effects as the wheels of his brain creaked into gear. If what Gemma was saying was true, something was definitely off. Potter had a near death experience which was not reported despite having
“What are you trying to say?” asked Draco, his hand tightening on his wand, in case the portrait knew more than he was letting on.
“This is what Hermione must have meant in the diadem,” said Harry, speaking in a quiet voice to the others so as not to upset Kreacher. “I can't believe I didn’t put it together before; she said the real locket was in the possession of a house-elf that belonged to my godfather.”
A large wingback armchair was situated in front of the fireplace, and another smaller man flitted about nervously. Approaching, Draco realised that twined around the legs of the armchair was an enormous green snake.
Harry hesitated. It had the ring of being a trick question. Draco was priming him for when this was all over, and their lives would eventually resume as normal.
Draco and Angelica trailed slightly behind, where Draco could glower at the back of Potter’s head without the others noticing.
Harry did as he was told, but after a few minutes of standing he was realising why Hermione was sceptical of anything that came out of Luna’s mouth.
“Go tell the others I need you to apparate me home, and I’ll tell Gemma,” said Harry, his voice controlled. “Then take the Italian restaurant exit we came in on and meet me in the side street in the opposite direction from the hotel.”
She hummed in acknowledgement and flipped over the second card. “Your present. What is influencing you today.”
Perhaps he would be ginger, like one of the stupid Weasley lot. And if he were raised by Muggles, he would likely be walking around in some kind of foolish fashions, with many-pocketed trousers or slouchy terry cloth track suits Draco sometimes saw when he was forced to walk through the Muggle parts of London.
Draco smirked. If he knew Potter’s level of defensive ability, he’d be able to take him down with ease when the time came. The weakness was always the same with people like Potter; too trusting.
“Cedar, Unicorn hair, 11 inches. Nice strong bonding properties,” said Ollivander. “Give us a spell then.”
“Thank you, Draco. It means a lot to me,” she said sweetly, putting on her best doe-eyed expression.
“I have, but I’ve got no idea where she could be, so it’s in the owl’s hands now.” Hermione handed him his backpack which clunked metallically.
Seemingly in response, a small hand reached out to grasp the closest item on the shelf; a rectangular piece of plastic with faded number buttons, like they’d been pressed a million times. Harry ran his hand across it, feeling the familiar clack of the number keys and Draco realised the hand was quite young. Potter must be showing him a place from his childhood.
“Never better,” said Draco with a humourless smile. “Now I’m guaranteed a position in the new world order. A coveted spot on the Dark Lord’s council. Hell, before too long, maybe a position in the Ministry. Then we can go about dismantling this broken society and killing off Mudblood scum – Is that what you want me to say?”
First, back to number four to get a few critical items for his life on the run. Then, over to Lilac Avenue, to pick up Charlotte, who had been informed by owl post to be waiting for him. The two of them would head to the train station and catch the last train of the night up to London, and from there they could go anywhere they pleased.
On one hand, Draco could sever ties and return his focus to the imminent rise of the Dark Lord. On the other, he could continue playing into the gambit, hoping for another opportunity to reveal the boy legend. He knew he ought to distance himself from the bespectacled idiot or he risked fanning the flames of whatever absurd feelings he was developing – and yet, the fact that he had returned here to the castle, seemed like a gift of sorts. A second chance.
Draco studied the portrait briefly. He’d never really known his Aunt Andromeda. There had been a few times in his youth when he and his mother had made quiet visits north to see her sister, but from the moment the Dark Lord showed up on the doorstep, their names were never uttered again in the house. It was as if they had never existed at all.
When she lunged at him, he almost thought to reach for his wand but was surprised to find she had wrapped him in a hug.
“Tonks reckons I could get into the Auror academy if I wanted to. My marks being what they are.” Draco said it offhand, but Harry got the sense he was testing the idea with him.
“Oh ho ho, take a look at this Blaise,” said Voldemort, circling the small group to lay a hand on the Slytherin’s shoulder. Blaise tried to hold an expression of steely resolve, but Draco could see fear behind his eyes. “It would appear that Draco has grown sympathetic for the enemy. How pitiful. It should be easy for you to climb the ranks in his stead, wouldn’t you agree?”
Draco stood rooted to the spot for a moment, trying to make sense of what had just happened. Had they been arguing? He couldn’t even remember. All he could think of was the kiss and getting out of this damn club and back into Harry’s arms.
Hermione was busy running healing charms over Draco’s arm as quickly as she could to stop the bleeding, though a few drops were trickling off his sleeve onto the floor.
He felt a gnawing sensation of being on the edge of a decision he would later regret. If everything went according to plan, wouldn’t he be playing right into the expectations Potter had laid out to him? Potter, who at this moment was looking on calmly with his hands in his pockets, wearing an infuriating expression like he knew what Draco was thinking. Draco glared back. Was he really destined to follow in the steps of his father, after all?
“Harry, he’s going to call me,” said Draco. Gone was the fear in his voice. What remained was complete composure. This only broke Harry more.
“Fine, you can tell her I’m ready to go,” called Harry after. “And we can all be done with this little arrangement for good.”
“Suit yourself,” said Gemma with a shrug, flopping back on the booth and taking a bump out of the tiny vial.
Malfoy whispered something in Pansy’s ear which had her in peals of laughter as Harry and Hermione turned the corner in relief. They walked on in silence for a little while before Harry ventured. “That was a close one. Lucky Malfoy knew her.”
“I hope that it’s not the case, but I can’t find anything else, even in the Restricted Section,” said Hermione, letting out a huff of frustration. She flipped past a few grim pictures of children in Victorian era clothing, surrounded by healers casting diagnostic spells and pacing about nervously. “Not to mention there have been so few cases in the last century that even the Healer techniques are more dated than Binns’s lesson plans.”
“What a disappointment,” said Draco airily, flicking his wand to tie off the dark cloth parcel again. He couldn’t have word getting out that he had the ring in his possession, especially now that he knew how recognisable it was. “I hope my father doesn’t have to hear about this.”
“Don’t bother,” called Harry, a smile spreading across his face as he aimed down the corridor. “I’d rather see what you’ve got.”
“I can’t say I fully understand it, but it was a direct request of Dumbledore’s,” said McGonagall. “It is quite fortunate we have Mr Malfoy as an expert. And perhaps each of you will find other ways to impart – yes, Miss Granger?”
“The point is, she’s alive! She’s at Wisteria Hall with other prisoners,” said Draco, rising as well. “It’s not like Alice.”
“Not in the slightest! In fact, this wand is incredibly clever, and may even act of its own accord,” said Ollivander with a laugh. “However, it takes after its owner in disposition. Holly wands tend to pick owners with a bit of a temper, you know, and they like an adventure. It’s rumoured that they seek an owner who is on a particularly dangerous quest.”
” called Draco from the other end of the hall, knocking Cedric’s wand out of his hand and sending it flying.
Then, just as the crowd was reaching a fever pitch, he saw it — the Golden Snitch. The Ravenclaw Seeker hadn’t spotted it yet, but as soon as he went into a dive, she was on his tail. He plummeted towards the ground, gaining inches on the Snitch as it darted in front of him, but when it took a turn, pulling the two Seekers out of their dive, he thought he had lost it for good.
“Are you tracking me or something?” asked Harry, looking accusingly at Cedric and Hermione, who seemed to be hiding something from him.
The card was inverted, depicting an old man seated in a stone archway looking out onto the green lands of an estate. A young couple embraced in the distance, with a child and a dog playing at their feet.
Draco felt numb. He was pretty sure his mouth was open, but he couldn’t think of anything to say. Mr Dupont was casually wiping at a smudge on one of his clubs before selecting it and taking a few practice swings through the air.
“I need to speak with you,” he said, crossing over to the armchair and grabbing Harry by the wrist, pulling him into a standing position.
“Luna!” said Harry, turning the corner down the last flight of stairs as a familiar blonde head poked her way into the hall.
“Oh er, he was back at the school too,” lied Harry, not sure he was ready yet to face the truth of what Draco had been in the other timeline. “It was like everything had progressed as it was supposed to except… there was no Fidelius. I think the diadem showed me what the world could have been if I’d come to Hogwarts when I was meant to.”
Draco felt an uncomfortable tightness in his chest. The few memories he’d seen during their last Legilimency session had been… enlightening, to say the least. Potter’s upbringing was certainly not what the wizarding world would have wanted for their child martyr, but he had a certain deep-seated resilience to him.
Returning his wand to his pocket, Harry gripped the fire-imbued blade with both hands and sliced it through the air, bringing it down on the bundle of Horcruxes with a decisive blow. A piercing wail flew through the hall, dimming the sounds of the battle raging behind him.
Mr Dupont stopped in his tracks and his magical trolley bounced off his ankles and wheeled quickly away in a worried manner. He fixed Draco with a look of surprise and let out a big belly laugh.
“I know,” said Draco, glancing around for anyone who might overhear them. A few portraits looked on with interest. “I figured as much when I read the papers. Gone, is he?”
“And how does it feel to know that a guy with four weeks’ worth of magic knowledge beat you in a duel?” challenged Harry back across the table. Draco snorted into his Butterbeer.
He barrelled down, catching up neck and neck with the yellow clad Seeker as they drove the Snitch to the edge of the field, and in a quick movement of the golden wings, it was veering left towards the centre of the pitch, just as Draco made the pivot himself. Summerby flew another few metres straight before he could double back, giving Draco just enough time to close his fist around the struggling golden ball.
Draco started to reply, but the words caught in his mouth. “Well, not anyone in particular, but people who fought for the right sorts of things. Most of the general public are too inept at politics to really govern themselves. But appointing a counsel of leaders who knew what was best for society, the right and proper order of things, it would maximise utility for the whole.”
“Oh Harry,” said Hermione, her face falling. “There’s so much I wish I could tell you. You would have loved Sirius. Maybe you can still find him? Let’s come back to it if there’s time.”
“The priority here is defensive magic; Disillusionment, diversion, shielding if we can get to it. If you want offensive magic, join the duelling club,” said Cedric.
“There’s nothing to be angry about,” said Draco, rising to follow him. “If anything, that’s progress. A little further and we might be able to access—”
“That’s supposed to make me feel better, is it?” said Harry, throwing his hands up. “Look, I’m really grateful for all your help, but I can’t just sit around here. It wasn’t just coincidence that those men were there. Someone knew we were coming. I’m sick of not knowing the truth about who these people are and what they want with me.”
The others seemed thrilled to be kicking on with the search, but only Draco noticed the slight shift in Harry’s demeanour. Where he was usually brimming with ideas, he instead chose to listen while Cedric and Hermione babbled on about the possible methods for obtaining and destroying the final Horcruxes. Where Draco was normally rewarded with a broad smile when he made a joke or a sly comment, they now only won him a tight-lipped nod.
Hermione turned away in a cloud of curly hair as they pushed into the Transfigurations classroom. McGonagall was seated at her desk across from someone in Auror robes. If it wasn’t the old winner of the Triwizard Tournament of ‘95 himself, thought Draco with annoyance as Cedric Diggory turned to glance at them. Draco had hoped his days crossing Diggory’s path had ended when Hufflepuff beat Slytherin in the last game of Draco’s fourth year. It was a grudge he was not quick to forget.
“You mean none of the wands are suitable?” asked McGonagall, failing to hide a note of exasperation in her voice.
His hands darted to a dusty box, but he laid it to the side, instead pulling out three remaining boxes to try first. As with the last time, the wands responded unpredictably, but Harry’s
“DuPont Pharmaceuticals / Flamel & Sons merger” read the top line of the page. “Deal initiated by Lucius Malfoy, 4th November 1994.” Draco kept his features in a carefully trained neutral expression. Even though he had logically surmised that the deal did in fact exist, it was a jolt to see his father’s name next to the familiar elegant signature.
“Well, Minerva, this is quite unusual,” he said jubilantly, turning to McGonagall. “I will have to consult my stores and see what we might have back at the shop that could be a fit for Mr Dursley here.”
“Well, pretty much where we left them I would imagine,” said Hermione. “Though if you want to hear your girlfriend’s voice, I’d be happy for you to turn on the wireless, if that’s what you’re getting at.”
“Hey, come here,” she whispered, crooking a finger at him. He leaned down to put his ear closer, and she threw her arms around his neck in a hug. “Love you,” she mumbled into his shoulder.
“Jeez Louise, you cut right to the chase, don’t you?” she said with a smile, the girlish timbre leaving her voice suddenly. She ran a hand slowly through her ponytail and regarded him with an intrigued expression. “That’s what father said about you too.”
As she smiled up at him, he felt the flutter of something warm and comforting in his chest. This Tonks was like a sister to him, a best friend, and right now the only person in the world that cared about him like family. He struggled to think of some meaningful parting words to say, knowing he might not get another chance before the vision was up.
“I saw it attacking Charlotte. It wasn’t touching her but it was like it was draining her somehow,” said Harry, dreading the answer but knowing he had to ask it, anyway. “Did that thing – did it kill her?”
“Get him up,” snapped Voldemort as two Death Eaters hoisted him to his feet. “Do it, Draco. Do it and earn my trust. You will not get a second chance to fail me.”
“I’ve been granted special access,” said Hermione smartly, holding up a porcelain tile on a tasselled ribbon. “As a privilege for all my help tutoring.”
Harry watched the door close behind them and turned to face Luna who was still standing by the couches, a strange peaceful energy emanating from her.
Draco was dumbfounded. Sure Luna was dotty, but she had a lot going for her. More than he knew at the beginning of the year, to be sure. He couldn’t watch her throw herself away on Longbottom, of all people. “Why?”
Lucius, ashen faced, said, “Please, my Lord, surely if there were secrets in his mind, you would have already found them.”
Perhaps it was the fact that the castle would be clearing out over the holidays, with Draco and Hermione both going home to spend time with their parents as if everything was normal. Harry might be missing family, as Draco certainly was, but he insisted he was perfectly happy to stay in the castle. On top of which, Luna had agreed to stay behind and Cedric made plans for weekly duelling matches with Harry, so it wasn’t like he’d be completely alone.
“Drinking unicorn blood gives the user a sort of immortality,” said Hermione. “It can save you from an illness or even resurrect you from the brink of death, but you live a cursed life for having sacrificed something so pure. If Voldemort was trying to regain corporeal form—”
Harry blinked back at Draco before brushing past him as he walked off toward the ball, knocking shoulders as he went. “Merlin, you’re insufferable,” he muttered.
“What’s Granger got you working on now?” asked Draco, glimpsing some advanced charms work in a book open on the desk.
“Yes, yes… what was your name, my boy?” asked Ollivander, beckoning Harry close with a knobby finger.
“Just a bit of context,” drawled Draco. “I thank you for bringing me in on this goldmine of information, but you clearly know something that you’re not telling me. And since there’s no one else I can really talk about it with…”
“I wanted to say thanks. For helping Beedle,” she gestured to the painting, who was still grumpily surveying the scenery from painting to painting. “He told me you gave him some advice on his first draft. That was very kind of you, I didn’t know you liked poetry.”
The group had come to a stop in front of a homely looking Italian restaurant at the base of a muggle apartment complex. A man with a pencil-thin moustache and a small white apron was talking to Harry before sweeping inside. Harry motioned the rest of the gang to follow him.
He had only just stepped out of view of the stands when a hand grabbed his shoulder, jerking him into the shadows.
Voldemort knelt down to be eye level with her. “Look me in the eye when you speak, girl,” he demanded. “Now. What would you like to say to the boy who has the power to save you?”
“Yes! Daddy says it was so many years ago now it’s stupid to hang on to. He’s probably already over it, but I know it would mean more hearing you say it.”
Cedric and Hermione swept through the door into the snowy street and were gone. He should have expected it, but it still hurt. Not that Draco could blame them – he would have done far worse to a traitor in the group if he had been in their shoes.
Draco looked innocently between the two professors, as McGonagall straightened her glasses and cast a glance at the silent Potions Master before saying, “Well yes, we will need to gather the Prefects tomorrow and discuss the best way to support the other students during this time. However our request of you tonight is something altogether separate.”
The memory he picked this time was one he’d played over in his head for years; the day Tottenham drew with Chelsea, ending a years-long plague of losses. He remembered the smell of the pub that he had sneaked into to watch, and the brawl his mates got into with a few Chelsea fans. And he could picture with crystal clarity the goal by Armstrong that tied the match 17 minutes till the end of the game. It wasn’t until Vernon caught him wearing the kit and threw him into the sitting room wall that the memory faltered and Malfoy had to pull him out once more.
“Keep your voice down,” hisses Lucius in clipped tones as he stepped close to her and wrapped a comforting arm around her narrow shoulders. “Think what you’re saying, darling. If it is him, he has chosen us among all his followers. We can quickly return to his good graces.”
“That’s 15 points, Longbottom. Don’t try it again,” he said. Then, as Neville made to scamper away, he called, “It’ll be 50 if you mention poetry to another living soul.”
Harry jumped at the thunderous knock on the door, and took small satisfaction from seeing Snape do the same. He marched to the door, hoping to Merlin it wasn’t another student with a singed body part, and wrenched it open.
Dumbledore sat for a moment in stunned silence. In all their many years of working together, she had never spoken back to him like this. Of course they’d had their fair share of arguments, but there was a level of implicit trust between them that was straining for the first time. Minerva’s hands twisted nervously in her lap.
“It’s not about me, though I doubt your Slytherin brain can comprehend that,” said Hermione, coming up empty on her search for Weaver’s book and squaring up to Draco. “Harry deserves a better hand than he’s been dealt. And if a bit of research on my end can help him, then I’m more than happy to do it.”
“Heavens! The mores of the young folk never cease to amaze,” said Ollivander with a laugh as everyone let out a collective sigh of relief. The wandmaker flicked his wrist, causing the trunk to fly open, revealing many long, slender boxes packed to the brim.
Harry studied Draco through the cloak. Where there would normally be a hint of a smile playing at the corners of his lips, they were set in a straight line, his jaw tight. The usually cocky raised eyebrow was flat with seriousness.
“Wow, I never thought I would be glad about knowing someone with Death Eater relatives,” said Hermione, who was positively beaming.
“We’ll find another way,” said Draco’s reassuring voice from behind. He laid a strong hand on Harry’s shoulder and guided him back against a bookcase, where Harry pulled the invisibility cloak around them.
“Oh,” said Harry, simultaneously feeling rather stupid and wondering what it would be like to witness a time spell gone wrong at the age of nine.
He was about to knock on the door and make his demands when a voice behind him said, “Bare your fangs too early and you’ll give yourself away.”
“Don’t be dramatic,” said Pansy playfully. “He’s an Auror. I’m sure he’s getting patched up for either all the time.”
Hermione scoffed. “What a load of rubbish – any number of people could have been born around that time.”
“Not just any boarding school,” said Luna, making the first turn. “Riddle had a special attachment to Hogwarts, remember? And besides, we don’t know how the room gets what it needs.”
Concentrating on bringing the memory into focus, he could feel Harry’s presence like a fluttering bird on his shoulder. It was so unlike the icy presence of Snape or the oppressive, looming darkness of the man who taught him Legilimency.
“Yes, I can see that,” said Draco, gesturing to Rodolphus’s signature. “However, it may be quite some time before my father experiences true death.” He could feel his voice catch slightly at the thought.
“Fuck, Harry,” said Draco, rising to stalk to the other side of the room, where he stared down at the spinning record player.
“Can it, Fred. I’m too desperate for a drink for that to be funny,” said Tonks. “Shacklebolt’s going to have my hide if I’m late to one more drop off. Is everyone ready?”
“I knew you couldn’t have got that far ahead of me without cheating,” said Draco, sloshing some Butterbeer out of his glass as he pointed at Hermione with a mischievous glint in his eye.
“Ignore him,” said Hermione, grabbing Harry by the sides of the face and turning him to face her. “He wouldn’t know good looks if they walked up and hit him with a Bat Bogey Hex.” Malfoy scoffed from the corner.
“I’m sure you can appreciate the delicacy of the news on the matter,” he said, fixing the old proprietor with a serious look. “I am, however, here on a related errand.”
Hagrid blubbered and patted the blanket as lightly as he could. When they had taken a moment, Dumbledore turned and glided down the stone path to the door of the Dursley residence, placing Harry gently on the stoop.
“I’m not the only one who thinks so. There’s a painting of a bard in the Transfigurations corridor who definitely knows something,” said Luna with a nod. “He said he’d tell me what he knows if I can help him finish his sonnet. So I’m headed to the library later to look up rhymes for ‘Thestral’.”
The house-elf Apparated away with a crack as Snape struggled in vain to get back to the swirling marbled surface.
“In a way I do,” said Harry, sitting next to her and scooping a pile of potatoes onto his plate. “But I guess you always miss what you know.”
“Really? Sounds like the words of someone who’s never had a chance to see what it’s like down at the broom shed,” said Malfoy in a taunting voice. “Don’t tell me you’re still chasing old what’s-his-name the sorry backup Keeper?”
Harry tensed, but Draco put a hand on his shoulder, trying to steer him back towards the Pensieve. “Forget it, Harry. It’s just a portrait. It’s not really him.”
“It’s a funny thing,” Voldemort continued, taping a long finger on the edge of his glass. “I don’t remember Narcissa faring poorly in the winter. And I resided here for many years at that.”
“It would have to be something of immense value,” mused Draco. “The only other object of lore would be Gryffindor’s sword. But that’s just a legend.”
Harry turned the page, knowing that he’d see the companion photo of Weaver and Patient M all grown up.
The pale woman finally stopped at a midnight blue booth with a low table, glittering with an enchanted light that slightly illuminated the space from below. She gestured with a graceful hand and slowly blinked her white eyelashes at them with a dreamy smile. Harry leaned over to speak to her over the noise of the crowd and she nodded and drifted away.
“It’s honestly just conjecture. I don’t even think—” started Harry, trying to downplay the situation as much as possible. He was positive if Hermione had found the list she would have snapped his wand by now.
“Right,” said Hermione, pulling on her robes and looking more unconcerned about breaking school rules than Harry would have thought possible.
The buzzing began to subside in Harry’s ears, but like a charged battery he was still pulsing with magical energy. Maybe if he could calm down, just negotiate with McGonagall, she’d see reason. He opened his mouth to apologise when a blinding pain split through his head, and he cried out, falling to his knees.
Draco still returned to the room at the top floor landing each night. Forcing himself to lie under the family crest as Regulus had and atone for his sins. The Dark Mark still hurt like hell, but he couldn’t bear to look at it, or even brew a tincture for the pain. He knew there was nothing besides time that would heal it, not really. The only way to accelerate the assimilation of the Mark was to commit more of the spell that had caused it, and he wasn’t about to do that.
She pictured James and Lily in their last moments. They were students merely a few years ago. She couldn’t imagine leaving their son in the hands of these people.
“What? But I want them,” said Harry, wheeling on Hermione. “Change me back. You said it’s all reversible, right?”
“Look, I didn’t come here for you people to change me,” said Harry, his temper rising. “I didn’t come here for anything, frankly, but since I’m here I’ve agreed to learn what I have to to protect myself, and there was nothing in the agreement about what my vision had to be to make that happen.”
“How though? It’s not like we haven’t thought about it, it’s just not as simple as putting out an ad in the paper,” said Hermione. “Anything we could do to call attention to the Order might get us noticed by the Ministry.”
“Oh, so it’s about Angelica, is it? If you’ve got your sights set on her, you can think again because she is head over heels for me. You must be confusing her overbearing personality for a semblance of affection,” he sneered, leaning into Harry’s space.
“You can still resist it,” said Harry, emotion rising. “He can’t find us here, you said so yourself.”
“I think I can manage,” replied Harry, without turning to look at him. For a moment, Draco was fixed on the green eyes and dark brows as Harry lined up his shot. He was reminded of the same fiery look of focus when they used to dive head to head for the snitch.
If everything was going to plan, he’d be hearing from his mother via firecall any minute. And if things had not gone according to plan, he would almost certainly be hearing from his father.
“I’ll even let you choose who we kill first,” he said, ghosting a kiss across her lips. “Who will it be? Granger? Then you won’t have to compete with her any more for my affec—”
The group stayed close through the afternoon. Harry even found spare blankets in his wardrobe when it started getting colder and they sat together by the fire, wrapped up and hypothesising in low voices about what it could all mean. By the time Cedric returned from his vision, Harry was dreading what Draco would see.
Draco turned slowly back to the group, realising that he was being addressed directly. He found himself staring at an overly eager Theo, a sly-looking Pansy, and a suspicious Blaise.
“And as such, we’ve been sanctioned on a confidential mission of sorts,” she continued, picking up speed. “We remembered you’d said you never forget the name of someone you sold a wand to. And we’re aware of a wand that has performed some particularly dark magic, but the owner has changed his name. If you remembered the wand, we thought you could remember the wizard.”
