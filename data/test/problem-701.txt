Looking around him now, Harry had never felt so grateful in his life. He had a place to call home, people who he loved and was loved by and a bright future ahead of him without the plague of a dark wizard hanging over his head. As his eyes took in the sheer joy that filled his home, he caught a glimpse of the golden numbers out in the park and had a private smile to himself, remembering the last time he’d strolled through that park fondly.
“You alright, mate?”
Entering Luna and Ginny’s cottage that evening Harry could feel his heart racing and his palms growing sweatier by the second, despite the cold winter’s night. Having replayed both his conversation with Ginny and the entirety of last night over in his head a million times by this point he was starting to see that he had, in fact, been perhaps a bit insulting towards Malfoy. It was a hard habit to break, unfortunately, no matter how much he realised that he wanted to snog the git senseless.
By the time his dinner had arrived, the pain had faded once more. Confused but glad for the relief, Harry pushed any lingering questions in his mind aside and accepted his plastic bag full of delicacies from the harried delivery driver before retreating inside once again.
hello i am a big fan of ginny telling harry all the shit he's unwilling to admit to himself and being a supportive friend no matter what (can you tell?)
“Why him?” He moaned into his hands. “Of all the sodding blokes, why him.”
“Merlin, no.” Harry shook his head perhaps a little too quickly at that, but if Ginny noticed she chose not to mention it. “Home now?”
“Why not?”
Stifling a laugh, Ginny reached for another glass of champagne from the waiter passing them. “Alright, so your love letters aren’t working. What’s your next plan?”
“Harry?”
Harry had barely made it through the door when he was pulled aside roughly and all but slammed into the nearest wall.
“I know,” Draco said, cutting off Harry’s protests. “You left for work. Thank you,” he added as Mary set their drinks on the table between them. “Now can we change the subject please? You can even give me hell for drinking my 'boring' drink. This is me giving you explicit permission.”
The image of perfection
“From what Al tells me, you’ve done a good job at showing Scorpius that you’re happy.”
Harry swallowed nervously as he thought about the Horcrux and debated telling her for a moment. It would be such a weight off his chest. He thought about his worries, fears, the deepest thoughts he didn’t even want to share with Ron and Hermione. What if there was still an attachment to Voldemort? Though Harry and so many others had seen him meet his end, majority of his nightmares featured glimpses of the torture and horrors he’d subjected others to throughout the war. Moments Harry couldn’t be sure he had witnessed prior to the dreams that kept his staving off sleep as long as possible.
Once the kids were in bed for the night, Harry found his feet taking him to the fireplace and Ginny waiting there expectantly, the look on her face torn between amusement and despair.
“Very interesting.” Letting the thread resume its entanglement, Healer Benson looked to him expectantly. “Can you tell me what you think the problem might be, Harry?”
Harry’s eyes found hers as he gave a tentative smile. “That’s good then, right?”
“You make it sound so simple,” he said, sadness creeping into his voice.
Laughing, Harry took a drink of the cocoa and was pleased to find that it tasted just as Christmassy as he could have hoped for. With the taste of cinnamon on his tongue, he took a steeling breath before throwing caution to the wind and casting a quick
He seemed too cool for you then
His heart threatened to escape his ribcage as Potter extended his hand, like Draco had done in this castle so many years ago.
Draco stepped into line behind the two of them as Andromeda led the way to the platform, keeping his pace slow until Harry caught up to him. “You seem surprised to see me, Potter.”
“No! Before that!”
“Wine please,” Harry sighed as he settled in on the loveseat. This was going to be a long morning.
“We were both very different people then,” Harry murmured. A solemn look fell over Draco as the icy wind brought Harry’s words to his ears, their truth undeniable. “Ginny helped me see that I was lying to myself about a lot of things. So while you may have been the catalyst, it wasn’t just about you. A lot has changed since then.”
“Oh yeah,” Harry said, turning back to look at the flames as he tapped at Draco’s hands on his shoulders in hopes of more massaging. “What about it?”
But as someone had once pointed out, Harry sometimes had the tendency to be slightly oblivious to the finer details. Even when it came to Draco.
we are on the home stretch now! only the tiniest bit more ~angsty times~ to go through, but it's mostly domestic fluff from this point onwards.
“That doesn’t sound very healthy,” Harry admitted, grimacing.
“Sounds like Scorpius has you wrapped around his finger already.”
“That’s when I was worried you were just curious." Draco hesitated, meeting Harry's eyes uncertainly. "I think we've too much history for that to have ended well.”
Like a bad boy you pine for
“I already told you—"
“Gin’s got the kids tonight,” Harry whispered, watching Draco pause before looking at him with questioning eyes. “After we leave these two with Andromeda, did you want to—”
“That wasn’t your fault,” Harry heard Hermione whispering to Draco. “George hasn’t quite gotten past the loss and Percy… Well, Percy’s an arse.”
Harry shook his head. “You know what? Moments like this, with the two of us and all of the kids… I don’t think I’ve ever been happier, Draco. I’m so glad we gave us a chance. If this was how I spent every day for the rest of my life, I wouldn’t mind.”
“Er… I mean, she didn’t complain when I chose it?”
“Well, Harry, they never really arranged marriages that way. I’m not sure how that would work.”
She tipped her head back further in his lap, sending a pointed look up at him. “Yes, well. Ron was smart enough to drop out of the Aurors so I can actually afford to continue doing good.”
Glancing back up he saw Draco’s gaze on his again, uncertain and trusting. He leaned in, ready to take the plunge…

“It was for work! I didn’t just up and leave.”
“No, you idiot. Aside from Pansy being the type of girl who probably needs sex, she’s also not my type at all.”
Harry snorted. “I can tell. You keep dodging all of my invitations to grab coffee, you claim that you’re never available—”
That was how Harry found himself spending a winter evening strolling the streets of London beside Draco Malfoy. They were both bundled up thick, Teddy a few steps ahead at all times and chattering non-stop at Nick about everything he saw without really expecting a response from any of them. It had been a few hours of enjoying festive lights, Christmas crowds and pleasant conversation with Draco.
Thinks back, remembering his kiss
He felt nervous upon realising that if it had been delivered by Hestia, Draco must be nearby. With shaky hands he picked it up and unravelled it, hardly daring to breathe until he laid eyes on the familiar handwriting.
“Harry James Potter,” she began, in the voice that Harry knew meant he was about to get an earful, “if you would be kind enough to stop mocking me, I would like to point out that of the two of us I am the only pregnant one and furthermore, this is my third pregnancy. I would also like to point out that this is entirely your fault, so stop being a prick and let me complain nonsensically.”

Swiftly cut off by Healer Benson’s raised hand, Harry shrunk slightly as he tried not to let his shallow breathing take over.
“Listen to me,” Healer Benson began, speaking gently still as she perched on the end of his bed. “It’s a very rare occurrence that magic will just flare up when triggered by nightmares at your age. We don’t usually see this beyond age fifteen and no, I’m not comparing you to a child when I say that.” She shot him a look as if she could hear the defiant response in his mind at her comment, before continuing. “My best guess at this point is that either you’re more deeply effected by whatever you’re keeping from me… Or there’s dark magic at play. We’ve run all the diagnostics that could apply, considering that you haven’t fallen victim to any curses that anyone is aware of. Sometimes we miss things. I would rather not let you leave until we get further into this, but you don’t want that and with nothing visibly wrong outside of your stimulant use I’ve got little authority to keep you.”
“Yeah. He’s my best friend.”
With a snap, Kreacher disappeared before materialising again moments later, carrying a vial of shimmering blue liquid.
“That is precisely what I think is happening here, Miss Granger.”
Rolling his eyes, Harry shook his head. “This is a bit different, don’t you think?”
“Are you even listening to me?”
“You do your best pacing there,” she said as she shrugged out of her coat. “That, and I saw the light from the street.”
“Hestia! I was beginning to wonder if I’d ever see you again.”
“I’ve been… Scared to come here. Too much happened, y’know?” He kicked at the carpet with the front of a scuffed trainer, keeping his eyes down. “Then I saw that you were here all the time. How?”
he was frequently there or what he did with most of his time; Harry had narrowed it down to something finance-related at this point. Many mornings later in the year had been spent in London catching up over coffee—
After a while he realised just how much Ginny had always been able to see through him; he mentioned coffee with Draco and a knowing look crossed her face as she listened to him explain, falling over himself in apologies for not seeing it for what it was sooner.
They’d have a bloody field day.”
Red stripes on his scarf
He slammed the glass down with more force than was necessary. “What’s with everyone calling me stupid lately?”
“Is that so?” Draco quirked a brow at him, eyes moving around his face. “There’s some in your hair, actually.”
He panicked internally but kept a straight face. “I suppose we can. If it happens again.”
“Er, of course. Just missed a few words.”
Harry gulped. “Not at that exact moment.”
for now, if you think you noticed any typos or inconsistencies, no you didn't!
across the table before turning back to the boys, Harry shook his head, amused. “Don’t believe everything the kids tell you at school, okay?”
eeeeee okay i was quite nervous to share this one because it's what i've been working up to (in case y'all couldn't tell!)
“You don’t have to do it right now,” Ginny said softly. “But hopefully one day you’ll realise that you deserve to be happy, however that looks for you.”
“When you put it that way, it doesn’t sound too great.” Hermione laughed, leaning back in the armchair and looking at Harry as she did so. He loved Hermione’s laugh; for all the time they’d spent being idiots in school, he felt that she laughed more now. Leaving a war behind would do that to someone, he supposed. The sound was light and melodious, her face unguarded and carefree. Like she had grown into her laugh as she had grown into this version of herself. With a soft smile taking its place, she quirked a brow at him. “You don’t really think that’s depressing, do you?”
Shaking his head as he looked away from Draco’s angry stare, Harry sighed. “So you don’t want this?”
“Our bodies are sturdy things, Miss Granger, despite how fragile they sometimes appear. A few weeks of misuse will not have impacted your friend’s heart beyond the point of no repair, indeed in the case of most wizards his age it should only take a few days to bounce back to normal levels of function.”
“Of course I do. Why would you ask?”
“Er…” Hesitant though he was to talk about his potential misuse of Wideye in the past month, Harry knew it would likely be painted in a better light coming from him. “Maybe?”
“Too much Wideye?”
“Harry…” Draco hesitated before shaking his head and sighing. “It’s your marriage. Who am I to tell you what’s horrible? Ask your wife if you really want to know.”
“I know you don’t.”
Shaking his head, Draco gave him a sad smile. “I’m not sure I can do more than this, Harry. I’m sorry. I know it’s not fair.”
“Er, would you mind not waving your wand around?” Harry said carefully. “It’s a small space and—”
Harry had to give it to her, Healer Benson barely faltered as she took in Hermione’s seething disgust. With a subtle flick of her wrist a pamphlet made its way to Hermione, who managed to grab it in one hand before it smacked into her chest. He watched as she took one look at the cover and seemed to deflate as her eyes widened, before she gave a curt nod to Healer Benson and grimaced.
. Like the promise of water given to a man in the desert, Harry had managed to keep him persevering for so long now. He wasn’t ready to say goodbye to that just yet.
Shrugging, Harry shot Draco a conspiratory look. “Why not? Second cousins?”
“He’s got a point,” Hermione said with a shrug. “They’re still not all that forgiving on Death Eaters, even at the Ministry. It’s a wonder he doesn’t go mad just being at work each day.”

“Not quite. He can’t marry for love because the person he’s in love with is already getting married.” Winking at Harry, Astoria smirked. “Congratulations, by the way. April is a lovely month for it.”
Scrounging around for some fresh parchment, Harry quickly scribbled a
He saw her jaw clench as she let out a deep sigh before glaring in his direction. “I will let you have Kreacher cook only because you’re going to tell him he’s not allowed to give you Wideye under any circumstance, or to continue cleaning up after you.”
“Are you fucking kidding me?” Harry snapped, collected approach going out the window. “Draco, you are describing exactly what you put me through when you left that night. “
“You didn’t have to do that,” came the voice behind him. “I had it under control.”
“Harry…” Hermione trailed off, voice wavering slightly as she said his name. “I’ve been thinking.”
With an exasperated sigh, Harry led the way outside and heard the second set of footsteps a few beats behind him. He continued to march until they were in the street and a few houses down from Andromeda’s, hopefully not visible from any of the windows. Turning around to level Draco with a look that hopefully conveyed just how unimpressed he was, Harry decided that now was not the time to let the other man dwell on his past mistakes.
A sad smile crossed her lips, breaking Harry’s heart all over again. “I know you love me, but you’re
“Bad boy” a facade
Which left Harry here. Alone in his cubicle—probably alone in the office, everyone was at lunch—and infuriatingly confused by the actions of one Draco Malfoy. Without taking a second to stop and think about the repercussions Harry decided he’d had more than enough of this; work could manage without him pushing paper for the afternoon. Taking off his Auror robes and shrinking them down as he made his way to the elevators, he felt the familiar rage beginning to build under the surface of his skin as he marvelled at the audacity of Draco blowing him off like this for the foreseeable future. What in Merlin’s name did the prick think he was playing at?
“We’re alive.” Draco replied softly. “A lot of others aren’t.”
“You saw me this morning,” he points out, apparently unable to do anything but state the obvious at the moment, but Harry looks so delightfully pleased Draco thinks it might not be such a bad thing.
Draco does, taking a few more deep breaths before nodding. His heart doesn’t feel like it’s going to burst out of his chest anymore at least.
Draco feels himself go pale.
But right now it’s Blaise who needs his support, not Pansy. And as much as Draco loves her, she has nobody to blame but herself. Which she already realizes.
“Don’t be silly.” Harry says eventually. “We’ll never get anywhere if you think like that.”
“Well you’re not a teacher, are you? Besides, Hagrid’s interesting when you get him started on the right subject. And loads nicer than you.”
Hermione and Harry share a look. “He’ll come around,” she offers up. “He just… doesn’t understand.”
“Shh!” They both shush him simultaneously.
Draco’s face shutters. “Awful. Even my parents hated it. The only one who didn’t was Aunt Bella.”
Draco forces a quick laugh. “I’m sure she’ll be fine. She seemed like a hardy old lady.”
Is Draco in trouble? Could this be to do with his Wizengamot sentence?
Draco's quiet for a couple of seconds before asking, quietly, "Why didn't you shake my hand that day on the train?"
The flower boxes stand empty at the moment, packed with soil and hardened with frost, but the bare trees are coated in crystals of frost and ice that sparkle with the light of the sun.
Luna, I told you,
Draco looks up at her miserably. "We were together. For the last half of the school year. I ended it." Her mouth thins.
Draco shrugs. “Slughorn’s still there but who knows for how much longer, poor bugger. He’s been ready to stop since our Eighth Year. Probably regrets coming out of retirement for Dumbledore.”
“It’s because I know what it’s like when friends fight that I know you should solve it quickly.” Something sad passes over her face. “Just be honest with each other.”
"I mean what would people say?" He continues. "A Malfoy with a- a Potter?" He shakes his head. "How disgusting. That would really finalize our fall from grace in the social standing."
Draco gasps. "Never then."
“Piss off,” Harry says, but the way he says it sounds more like
“You owe me for this, Weasley,” is all he says before grabbing his cup of tea ungraciously. “Now finish telling me about this case.”
Blaise rolls his eyes at the ridiculousness of the question. “I
Malfoy's eyes stop on the empty seat beside Harry.
It’s nice to get out of the house, Draco thinks as he watches Harry take in the animal-shaped hedges with a look that’s half pained and half amused. Unicorns, fighting trolls, goblins and more encircle the edge as the two of them make their way into the center of the flower and tree populated garden. Harry doesn’t say anything but Draco doesn’t need him to. It’s clear that this is exactly the sort of thing he finds… excessive.
“Yes.” She seems relieved that he’s reached the correct conclusion without her having to say it. “I don’t want to ruin anything for you all, Harry, but I just- I can’t wrap my head around it. You might not think it’s my business, but I’ve made no secret of the fact that you’re a part of this family, at least to the rest of us. And those children…” She purses her lips. “Maybe the others are different, I can’t say I know much about most Slytherin families, but Malfoy? After all he’s done to you? To Hermione, Ron and Ginny? I know what his father’s like-”
Draco splutters.
With one last lick Harry pulls away and Draco uses huge effort to turn over and look up at him. Which is probably the worst thing he could have done because Harrys lips are puffy and red and there’s a sheen of spit all over his chin which he wipes away on his arm while staring at Draco.
And it had been so strange to talk about Nymphadora and Teddy. Two people that Draco had always been aware of peripherally, two people that by all means should have been a part of Draco’s life but weren’t because of old family history. It didn’t help to remember that Aunt Bella had been the one who killed Tonks. Draco’s cousin. Her own niece.
“I need to think.” Draco knows he’s being unfair and the sight of the flash of pure fear on Harry’s face makes him feel even worse. “I’m sorry but I just- I need some time.”
Draco grins brilliantly, pulling him further inside the Manor by the front of his clothes. “Well as long as we’re on the same page.”
“Harry.”
“You should too. Get married for love, I mean.”
“What conversation? You heard Nick, I’m a monster. Even Teddy thinks so,” he added in a bitter undertone.
Green eyes crinkle as he laughs
“She doesn’t usually like strangers,” came the voice from behind the counter. “So I think you’ve really made an impression.”
“Forget about this,” Draco began, waving off Harry’s protest before it had even left his lips. “Forget about your Saviour complex for once in your bloody life and let me marry someone who yes, I may never love in the same way as what you have, but I still love all the same.”
, seeing that he only had about ten minutes until they would be flooing over to the Ministry. Behind his glasses he was fighting a losing battle with his eyelids, threatening to remain closed with every blink. The six—seven?—coffees he’d already had that day didn’t seem to be doing much for him by this point and he wondered if he could get his hands on more Wideye potion. Hermione wouldn’t approve but Kreacher had been so thrilled to have Harry home that surely he would be able to find some.
Shrugging, Albus took another bite of his pie. “Said they’d do it as soon as he got home, I think.”
Harry sat in silence for a moment, slightly stunned that he’d gotten such an honest and heartfelt answer. “Er… Will you be doing it again this year, then?”
Firm muscles under your touch
“Harry, Hermione! You’ll appreciate these. I found them in a
“Must you choose
Humming something he vaguely recalled being played at last week’s celebratory gala, Harry fished a white crewneck out from under his bed and shouted in triumph as a clean-looking pair of white socks appeared beneath it. Placing them on top of his dresser he silently thanked Kreacher’s love of cleaning as he noticed the thick layer of dust buildup beside them.
“You go ahead! We’ll be right inside,” Harry said, smiling as the two boys ran excitedly through the doors.
“Stop asking, please.” Draco shook his head, brow furrowed. “Just… I can’t marry for love.”
“It’s embarrassing to say aloud,” he admitted in a low voice as he glanced ahead, probably to check that the children weren’t listening. “But I was worried that you were just bored in your marriage and wanted to experiment. Or even that… well, it’s not really important. I guess I’m glad to hear you put more thought into it than that.”
“Oh, Salazar. Now he looks like he’s been stunned. Potter, I cannot stand here with you being a blithering idiot any longer. I’m sick of it, you hear me? Absolutely pathetic, the lot of you. You’ve clearly had some kind of breakthrough tonight, that much was obvious. Do something about it so the rest of us can regain our sanity, please. Please. Do you hear that? I am literally begging you, and Parkinsons don’t beg.”
Remembering gleefully that Draco had mentioned getting the Manor floo hooked up to the Ministry, Harry opted out of apparating in favour of throwing some green powder into the flames. He really didn’t feel like dealing with a long walk up the driveway today, or arguing with Cillor at the front door. Speaking his destination into the hearth, Harry held his breath and clamped his eyes shut as everything spun around him for a few moments before the world slowed to a more bearable speed. Brushing his clothes free of any stray soot, he stepped out into a pristine room painted in light beige tones with gold accents, deep red carpet and a ceiling high enough to make the Great Hall jealous.
“See you all at Christmas!” Teddy called as he ran full pelt towards the train, making it aboard just in time.
Harry noticed the way Draco’s eyes wouldn’t meet his, the tone his voice took seeming so alike how it had the first time they’d crossed paths in Edington. It hurt. “How is Astoria?”
Their eyes met, the cascade of emotions that passed between them enough to fill a million lifetimes. Above all there was hope, and the promise of something worth fighting for.
“Does it look like I’ve had any luck yet?” Malfoy snapped, before grimacing. “I mean… I didn’t really get far, before that man pulled his wand out.”
Hermione was the one to point out that perhaps they had overstayed their welcome when Teddy started to drool on her lap. They’d all lost track of time, of course; Christmas morning at Andromeda’s was only supposed to be a short stopover before they made it to the Burrow for lunch but after the week they’d all had it seemed to be just the reprieve they needed, with many exciting announcements being shared. Even Andromeda had gotten in on the celebratory eggnog as Ron passed it around, all the while looking thankful that Teddy seemed more interested in climbing all over the houseguests than being entertained by her.
“I know, Harry. Me too.”
Letting out a sigh as Ginny roared with laughter, Harry pushed his hair back with his spare hand and shook his head. These two women together was something he didn’t think any amount of preparation would ever have him ready for, and they’d barely known each other five minutes.
“Why does that—”
“I just don’t want any more fighting,” Harry sighed, not realising just how true those words were until now. “And I don’t think you really do either.”
Lifting his head at Astoria’s amused tone, Harry cocked his head to the side as he looked at her. “Yeah, Draco mentioned in his letter. I’m not sure there’s any reason for me to worry though.”
“When you ask so nicely,” Harry murmured, getting only a laugh in response. “Yeah, alright.”
With a sigh, Draco nodded. “You’re right. It just feels a bit…”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah. Easier for the kids that way.”
“Draco.”
The atmosphere on Platform 9 3/4 felt lighter, less coloured by the pain and losses of long ago and more filled with hope. Harry had driven again, this time bringing Draco along with the three of them after he had floo’d over to Andromeda’s that morning. They made quite the crowd, Harry navigating as Teddy darted quickly between people in a mad race to board the Hogwarts Express before it took off.

“What in Merlin’s name are you playing at, Potter?
“Yeah, I—er, what?” Pausing, Harry frowned at the casual dismissal. “I wanted to apologise.”
assumed that you were… similarly inclined.”
There was none of the mockery or sarcasm he’d expected from Potter and perhaps that was what led Draco to be so honest in his answer. Whatever it was, his guard finally dropped enough to feel the desperation surrounding them, a longing for connection, to be understood. He was too far gone to know if it was projecting from him or Potter, possibly both.
“You’re utterly hopeless,” she muttered fondly. “Yes, if only because I’m loathe to be seen with you wearing them as they are.”
The raw emotion in her pleading voice had Harry biting his lower lip as he felt a surge of emotions rush through him all at once. Affection for his caring friend clouded by a deep frustration; surely Hermione knew that he wasn’t doing this for fun? As if unbearable nightmares weren’t enough, there was the constant roster of events he was expected to attend and the fact that the entire world seemed to be leaning on his happiness for their own. He couldn’t afford to show any weakness, not even in the dark of night, for fear that he might give in to the pain as it became too much. It was easier like this. Ignoring it rather than facing his demons head-on and rushing into something, like he had for all of the past seven years. Shouldn’t she be proud of him for that?
“That’s rough, mate.” Seamus clapped Dean on the shoulder, grimacing. “Wouldn’t wanna be in your place.”
After what felt like an eternity there was a tapping at the window and Harry jumped to his feet so fast he felt something tighten in his back, opting to ignore the pain in favour of letting the owl back inside.
Harry called after him as he watched Malfoy rise from the table and start off down the hallway towards the front door. Cursing, he jumped up and hurried after him, managing to catch him as he made it through to the front stairs.
Letting out a nervous chuckle, Ron gave him a thumbs up. “Blimey, Harry. You don’t really think I’d be daft enough to worry her on purpose?”
“Yes.”
Sensing an opportunity to leave before things heated up, Healer Benson pointedly cleared her throat before wishing them both the best and encouraging Harry to come back at any point, should he feel the need. Harry wished she would stay as a pacifier but didn’t blame her for taking off and thanked her for her time. Turning back to Hermione, he winced as he saw the grim look on her face had only darkened during his momentary reprieve.
“Draco, I—”
Squeezing past an enclosure of particularly energetic crups, Harry turned and stopped dead in his tracks as he took in the sight before him: Draco Malfoy with a tiny ball of red feathers perched on his head. He took his glasses off and wiped his eyes just to make sure he wasn’t hallucinating. Malfoy’s expression was somewhere between panic and
Her words propelled him into a memory of a similar conversation years ago, making him pause for a moment before answering.
The sentence length was of little consequence; Draco knew that staying out of there in the first place would guarantee his survival, in whatever form it took, whereas being sent to Azkaban with the possibility of a shorter term meant little in the way of actually leading to his release. They may have mentioned early release to house arrest but considering the social status of his witness stand, he thought it wise to assume it was all a front for the public. They needed reassurance, of course, that Potter’s opinion held value! Therefore to give him a life sentence publicly would be to tarnish the very saviour they all held in such high regard. Clearly Shacklebolt had no intention of freeing Draco, given his history and the side he had chosen. Yes, this was all for public morale. Best to ensure faith in the Chosen One and also get Draco behind bars, so they could indefinitely extend his term until there was no future left for him to follow beyond insanity or starvation.
“We have heard the evidence against you, however before we reach our verdict we have a few additional witness statements to consider.”
Harry grimaced, resenting himself for his fast reaction. “It’s fine, really. Just a chest pain.”
, he thought.
He had no idea who was there or how many people were present. All he knew was that he had never seen the Wizengamot chambers so full. Draco suspected this was because the Ministry had started allowing onlookers from the greater public in; viewing trials of well known Death Eaters being sent away for life in Azkaban was sure to boost morale.
“Harry.” Draco cast a look around them, letting out a shaky exhale. “Please. It’s not just you who’s married.”
“I should have known. I suppose this is something to do with that plan you accused me of the other night?”
“What do you mean?”
“Nothing serious?” She asked, settling into her chair and picking up the mug she’d left on the table between them. “You’ve pined after that man for how many years and sit here trying to tell me it’s not serious?”
“George?” Harry asked. “He’s doing—”
“He didn’t! You’re lying,” Teddy said, voice desperate.
“Rich coming from you,” Harry muttered. “Why do you always insult me?”
“That’s… Unexpected.”
It was another case of right place, right time that had Harry running into Malfoy again almost a full year after the Eeylops incident. Harry was wandering back from town, appreciating the celebratory decorations that had been artistically placed through the park behind his house. Though Christmas was a few days behind them, the tree still stood tall and proud at the centre circled by countless light installations of various colours. Andromeda had told him that this was a slightly grander scale of festivity than the town usually engaged in over the holiday season, understandable considering the turn of the millennium only three short days away. Some of Edington’s residents had grumbled at the thought of such a display, their rural town gathering more tourists than was normal for the time of year. Harry was of a different opinion; he adored the fact that he could see a tangle of wires that lit up in all colours of the rainbow to shine ‘
Draco wasn’t the be all and end all of his existence. It was something he wanted to try, wanted to see if it could slot into the life he’d always dreamed of having. But he also knew that Draco was building his own life the way only he knew how. Maybe Harry hadn’t quite come to complete acceptance around knowing that he deserved to be happy—even when he wasn’t fighting everyone else’s battles—but he was close, and he wasn’t entirely certain that he could say the same for Draco. If the other man needed a stable family environment around him, who was he to deny him his penance in the guise of traditional family life?
Unfortunately, that plan was ruined by Luna handing him a present and instructing him to open the Secret Santa gift immediately.
“The Muggle-born was in the library and asked Kreacher why he was being here so late instead of at Hogwarts like Kreacher is meant to be when Master doesn’t need food. Kreacher is not knowing he isn’t telling Muggle-born about Master. Master told Kreacher to talk to the Muggle-born girl more after he got home from St Mungo’s last week.”
A chorus of jeers met him, more potatoes shooting in Harry’s direction as he shot up a subtle shield charm to catch the worst of them before they covered him.
Harry snorted. "Guess you could say that. Twisted sense of humour too. Permanent sticking charm on her, or we'd have taken her down long ago."
“It would be if it offered any explanation for what happened earlier.” She paused, pulling a purple thread out for closer inspection. “Interesting…”
Eyes narrowing, Harry shook his head. “Do you realise how you sound right now?”
“Mm. And the other Weasley?”
Laughing, Ginny shook her head as she met his eyes once more. “I think you should tell Draco how you feel. And yes, you should quit your stupid job. Let me go to work every day without feeling guilty for leaving the kids with mum.”
“Yeah,” said Harry as he stood from the table. “Excuse me one sec. Gotta go to the bathroom. Another round on my way back?”
“I did not! I only said that—”
Teddy squinted up at Harry, brow furrowed in confusion. “Were you listening to what I just said?”
As he watched Teddy boarding the train, Harry felt a nostalgia wash over him as he remembered just how different everything was the last time he stood on this platform. The wounds that perhaps would never completely close felt slightly rawer than they did most days, his most haunted memories threatening to rear their ugly heads. He took a steeling breath and glanced at Draco beside him, their eyes meeting for the briefest of moments. What he saw mirrored there was unsurprising, allowing a bittersweet recognition to pass between the two of them.
“You’re the one talking about getting married,” Harry pointed out.
“Great,” Harry groaned. “Just great.”
Taking a quick look around them to make sure nobody was paying attention, Harry cast a quick cushioning charm on Teddy and Nick before turning back to Draco, gesturing towards a low brick fence by the roadside. “They’ll be supervised enough in there for a few minutes. I just wanted to spend more than two seconds outside without the threat of getting a snowball to the face.”
Harry grinned, taking great pleasure in noticing the twitch at the corner of Malfoy’s mouth in response. “You should try it some time.”
“We’ll save that conversation for another day.” Malfoy turned to glance at the grandfather clock in the corner and shook his head slowly, standing and brushing his hands on his jeans. “Lovely as this has been, Potter—”
The tension in the air was thick enough to be sliced cleanly with a
An awful lot of his time was spent wondering about how his father was handling everything. Draco was concerned most for his mother simply because he cared for her so deeply, but he knew that she had always been strong and knew how to take care of herself. How to take care of all of them. She had gone into the war with one goal: to see her family come out the other side. She had acted on her own conscious decisions to do what she thought was best in the darkest times. Lucius on the other hand had made his choice far too early and started to fall apart as the years went by. While Draco highly doubted his stance on the cause had changed he felt that perhaps his father had started to think that the Dark Lord's measures were too much, too extreme, towards the end. That he had started to realise the grave danger he had placed his family in. It had driven him mad in those final months, realising that he cared a whole lot less about whether they won or lost but instead about his wife and kid, who he had dragged through hell and back for a madman's dream.
Rude, unnecessary and entirely untrue.
Harry shrugged. “Like I said, I’m hardly the one to put my loved ones through something like that without thinking it through.”

“—and I… Oh.” Harry felt his jaw go slack as he tilted his head back to look at Draco once again, watching him smile nervously as he procured a ring from seemingly thin air.
Recognising a nervous habit as Draco watched Harry pick at his fingernails, there were a few moments of silence before he spoke again.
Watching Ron walk off to the bar for their next round, Harry drooped in his chair as he felt the weight of the past few days catching up to him. It was hard enough to stay switched on all the time for the benefit of society, let alone to keep his best mate in good spirits. Maybe he’d have to give into sleep tonight after all. He’d managed, what, four days? Five?
Draco barked a hollow laugh, tipping his head back with a sigh. “Yeah. Real shame.”
“Blimey, Harry, you must really like Christmas, eh?” Dean spluttered over the top of his glass. “Don’t reckon anyone’s asked so many questions about it since my mum.”

Ron moved to clap Harry on the back, leaving Harry feeling like he almost dislodged some organs in the process. Hermione stayed firmly put, arms crossing against her chest as she looked between the boys and Healer Benson.
It was Hermione pulling the other end of the cracker he’d been handed that snapped him out of his reminiscing on Draco’s fleeting smile last Christmas. He mouthed a
Many great things had happened when Harry had quit the Aurors. Spending more time with his children—by extension allowing Ginny to go back to work full time—had been the immediately obvious benefit, but as the years went on he realised just how much he had tangled his own identity up with the idea of fighting the bad guys. The sense of self he’d managed to reclaim was unlike anything else he’d experienced, and having more free time to explore his interests was fulfilling to no end.
Draco had said. Most of it had been quiet, like Harry wasn’t supposed to hear him. Or maybe the wine had muddled his senses; it wouldn't be the first time.
Once the Aurors had come to the Manor and started to see the damage it had taken through months of being used as the Dark Lord’s torture house, there was no way his family was walking free. The fact that he’d been granted a few more weeks there should have been a small consolation but these days the Manor felt haunted. Feeling confident in the Malfoys’ inability to leave while under 24/7 guard, the Aurors turned the place upside down searching for surviving prisoners and additional evidence to use against Death Eaters in trial. Draco had felt sick watching it.
“You can’t really think—”
Sharing a grateful look with Hermione, Harry patted her gently on the shoulder before leaving to make the rounds and saying goodbye to the rest of the Weasley clan. Retrieving their things from where they’d ended up, Harry helped his wife and child through the floo and stepped through to their home waiting on the other side.
Draco tugged at his shirt and brought him back so that their lips were pressing against each other once more, mouths warm and inviting. How long they stayed there neither could say, kiss growing more confident as tongues explored mouths, ranging from tender, slow and explorative to rough, heated and needy. It wasn’t until they heard a cheer behind them that the two pulled apart, turning to see their friends standing in the doorway with grins across their faces.
Hermione laughed at this, and nodded.
That was innocent enough, wasn’t it? A simple congratulations from a friend. Before he could talk himself out of it, Harry called for Apollo to deliver the letter and watched the owl fly off until he was no more than a speck on the dimly lit horizon. Then he sat in the armchair by the fire and waited, talking himself out of rereading the
“—KREACHER!”
Harry began laughing so hard his stomach started to hurt as he sat listening to Hermione do her best at coming up with scandalous titles for the supposed expose they would run when they heard the news. They spiralled into crazier depths and he had to make sure to keep his volume down, lest the wake the babies with their self-indulgent idiocy.
“I want to,” Harry countered, walking across the room until he was only a few short paces from where Draco stood. “I didn’t expect to see you here.”
Draco is starting to seriously fear for his sanity.
But then she turns around to yell at him. “Oh, and it’s a costume party! So make sure to dress up!”
“Not this time, maybe.” Potter grumbles.
“Draco.” Blaise shakes him a little and Draco straightens automatically, going to pull back but Blaise doesn’t let him. His fingers grip Draco’s shoulders tightly. “Come on, pull yourself together.”
He’s dozing when he feels Harry’s fingers touch the back of his hand. A finger traces a circle on Draco’s skin before lazily moving up his arm, slipping over clothing to trail up and over his shoulder across his chest.
"Forget it," she says. "I'm being stupid. Still... it's Malfoy, Harry. Just because some Slytherins are alright doesn't mean they all are. He's a Death Eater, don't forget."
“Good at Potions?” Ron splutters, and it’s an eery imitation of their conversation from the beginning of the year. “Sorry, have you forgotten that this is Draco sodding Malfoy we’re talking about here? You wouldn’t have gone near him with a ten-foot pole in Sixth Year.”
“That was fun.” Harry says a second later and he sounds surprised. “That was really fun.”
Even Ron and Hermione are spending more time on dates than usual. Draco looks across the Great Hall at Harry at breakfast and catches him watching them with something like longing on his face before the other wizard seems to catch himself and quickly look back down at his food.
“Can’t believe I’m letting Malfoy and Parkinson see me like this,” Ron mutters to Harry. “You’re friends with him now, can you make sure he’s not a prick about it?”
Myrtle does the ghostly imitation of a blush. “Well, if you both want to.”
“Will do.” He replied just in time for Ginny to come down and the couple to leave.
He leaves before lunch and his mother welcomes him gladly with open arms and a proud smile at his N.E.W.T.S. results.
It hadn’t even been awkward between them after. The whole thing is just… in the past.
“More.” Draco demands. “I want all of you, don’t fucking hesitate or I swear to Merlin, Harry.”
“Go, Hermione, or you’ll be late.” He tries to smile. “Everyone probably heard us out here anyway.”
They’re here now, aren't they? Isn't that enough? They’re friends and- and maybe building towards more than that, can’t that be all they need? Why do they have to rehash everything? It makes Harry's stomach twist even though seconds ago he’d also been thinking of the things he needed to get off his chest and that the two of them needed some time.
“Apparently.” Ginny repeats and she smiles happily at him. “I know, I was as shocked as you.”
“I would like to know for how long,” she says, making everybody turn back to the two of them.
Fine then, he thinks while turning away to put a few slices of roast ham on his plate, followed by a small scoop of mashed potatoes. It doesn't bother him, and he'll make sure they know it before the day is done.
Harry nods. “But there’s all this- this Pureblood stuff that I don’t really get. Ron’s family doesn’t care about traditions like the Malfoy’s, and even though Draco says he knows they’re mostly bollocks and tosh, I know he cares about them too. It’s what he was raised with, what’s been instilled in him. He’s the heir; to the name, to the estate, the fortune and the reputation and all of it.” Harry looks away again. “What happens if he tells his parents about me and they cut him out for it?”
used to be different.” Cory says. “Both of you. Leo and I remember,” he nods down at the other end of the table to where Leo sits with the other kids and the teachers. “Not like Lydia thought, but not how you are now either. And you used to hate each other.” He frowns. “The whole school knows
“Oh.” Harry tries not to feel a bit mortified and fails. “Do you guys use decorations like this?”
“His parents,” the Slytherin supplies and Harry relaxes.
Draco had been expecting it, what with the invitation coming so last minute, but he can’t deny that he’s a bit disappointed.
Why is he just standing there, looking like he hopes this is all some kind of sick joke?
"Nothing out of the ordinary then," Harry teases, and Draco's mouth twitches as his hand keeps moving.
Blue twinkling eyes smile at him. Dumbledore looks between Draco and Harry before meeting Draco’s eyes again knowingly.
“Please.” Harry scoffs. “You’ve never once been that nice to me when we talk.”
“Well it was mostly Harry, really. He’s the one who
Draco wakes up in his bed with a blinding hangover. His stomach is tossing like mad and his head is pounding. All of the curtains are drawn and the room has barely any light except for a soft glow from a bedside lamp and that still feels like too much.
“Tell him to pull his head out of his arse then.”
But Ginny breathes out a little sigh of relief and Blaise definitely relaxes a bit once the words leave the red-haired wizard. Ron looks between them in astonishment.
He thinks back to the end of summer when he’d been getting only a few hours sleep and worrying constantly about his future, and Hogwarts, and what was going to happen now that the war was over and won. He remembers the trials and the funerals and the nightmares and can’t help but feel grateful that it all ended with this. And now here he is, sleeping full nights, most of them without nightmares, making new friends- something he’s never been good at, if he’s being honest- and happier than he can ever remember.
“Not at all.” Harry breathes before looking down at the object in Draco’s hands. It’s wrapped in green paper with a silver bow and ribbon on top and Harry raises an eyebrow, noting the use of Slytherin colours.
Draco doesn’t want Harry to have to go alone. Not if he wants Draco there.
“Yeah.” Harry says. “They used to bully him in school, Dad and Lupin, Sirius and Peter.”
Narcissa takes them in swiftly, eyes going from Draco to Harry and then to the bed, making Harry freeze in fear, but she doesn’t linger on it and her face doesn’t change. He lets out a breath of relief.
Harry touches her arm gently. “It’s possible, Gin.”
“I wonder if you two would be interested in becoming teachers here at Hogwarts.”
“How’s Ginny?” Blaise asks.
What makes it worse is that Draco agrees with him. Of course he doesn’t want to hide forever. Blaise and Harry might think he’s burying his head in the sand but he’s not. He knows that for this to work then he has to stop hiding.
Harry processes that before nodding. “The thing is for me, us being together hasn’t been an option for so long. And now you come here and say all of these things, everything I’ve been dying for you to say since Eighth Year, making all that I’ve wanted possible again. But you’ve been sending mixed messages for just as long. Can you- do you see why that might be hard for me?”
Ron shrugs. “As good as ever. Me?”
When Ron comes back minutes later he’s holding two cups of tea and is met with a glaring Draco and no Harry.
They share a look and then Harry looks out of the open doors, eyes taking in the part of Hogwarts grounds he can see. Draco just watches him, waiting for whatever he’ll say next.
A poster of the Bulgarian Quidditch team takes up part of one wall and Draco flushes when Harry glances back in amusement, one eyebrow raised.
“All of my mother’s favourites,” he explains to Harry as he watches him inspect the many colours of the petals. “More than anything else she loves-”
Harry nods when it becomes apparent she’s waiting for some kind of reply.
Except with Potter of course.
“Yeah.” Draco clears his throat. “Um, who else, let’s see. Snape left almost all of his things to Mum and Dad so we got any old photos he had. But it was your aunt that gave me the ones of him and your mum. I don’t think Snape had any. There weren’t a lot of him when he was young from what Mum and I saw.”
“Okay.” Harry says and they fall quiet.
“We shouldn’t.” Draco’s voice is throaty and pained. So rough against Harry’s neck that Harry has to squeeze his eyes shut even as his cock twitches in his pants. “We really shouldn’t do this.”
Harry’s face shutters. “Not great. I keep dreaming- well. It’s always things I’ve lived through before. People dying, memories of my parents, of the others. But it’s okay.”
“Morning Harry,” she greets warmly, blinking at him a bit sleepily. “Kettle’s just boiled if you want some.”
“Fine, fine,” Arthur replies, eyes bright. “We’ve got the tent set up, it’s similar to Bill’s, Ron, if you remember his wedding-”
After a little bit he gives up. “Okay, I see it. I know the myths behind that one.”
Draco sips his tea and listens attentively, mind already thinking of possibilities. When Ron leads him down to the deeper levels of the Ministry where potions are brewed and spells invented, Draco can’t help but look at the closed door of Harry’s office on the way and wonder.
“If you’re being targeted then it’s not unreasonable to assume other Slytherins are as well.” Her voice is gentler. “You might not be the only one not speaking up.”
Harry stops talking and looks at him.
“Fine.” Harry says easily, stopping for a second to check his own appearance. He doesn’t exactly relish the idea of Andromeda or Narcissa working things out because his hair is more of a mess than usual or his trousers aren’t done up right.
Silence falls on them all.
. At least no signs blatant enough to give Harry the confidence to just ask him out.
“Nobody’s at my table,” he says like this explains everything.
“Die?” Draco guesses. He knows Harry hadn’t died, obviously, because he’s right there and because Draco’s mother had told him all about that night. But Harry had gone there to seemingly be killed.
But then they pull away, and Harry is actually getting hard now, his lips and hands tingling, his shoulders burning even through his robes from where Draco has been touching him.
“Thought- you didn’t- use- Muggle-swears.” Harry pants before letting out a deep huff. “God Draco, how are you such a good fuck?”
Harry feels like Draco’s punched him.
That was when Draco should have left, he knew. It must have been well past curfew at that point and he wasn’t certain the Fat Lady wouldn’t rat him out to the first professor that walked by.
“Sorry, I seem to be missing the part where you went bloody mental,” Ron says to the two of them, ignoring the students filing around them. “Can one of you refresh my memory? Was it before or after you killed Voldemort?”
Then there had been that one instance when Draco had been handing Harry tea during one of their now shared breaks. Their fingers had more than brushed, they’d practically been holding one another’s hands around the cup. And Draco had been close, so close that their toes had almost touched. The feeling of Draco’s smooth skin had made Harry want to reach out and hold his hand, to grip it tightly and keep it in his grasp for as long as he could.
"Harry-"
Draco only just manages to stop himself from flinching. "Yes. That night was... a lot."
“But I don’t know anyone in our year who doesn’t.”
“No. Maybe. I hoped not.”
Hermione’s eyes widen. “But you’re so young!”
Draco takes a deep breath at that and forces himself to think about anything else while ignoring Potter’s voice and the way his first name sounds coming from his mouth.
“They didn’t.” Pansy gestures between Ginny and Harry who look at each other with red cheeks.
(“Really, Potter, why does it not surprise me that even house-elves give you preferential treatment?”)
The thought makes his smile disappear.
They follow in silence to stop at a stone gargoyle. Draco blinks in surprise, glancing up and down the hallway before McGonagall says, “Pecan Tart,” and the stone moves aside to reveal a stairway.
Harry’s eyes go wide behind his glasses. Draco wishes he wasn’t distracted by how endearing the sight is.
“Oh, erm…”
“Me neither,” he says mournfully, cursing his own body’s inability to handle endless foreplay.
“Mum-”
this, that he’s enjoying it almost as much as Harry.
Lydia nods. “My best friend is in Hufflepuff you know. She’s at home for Christmas but she’s really nice.” Her mouth turns down at the corners. “She was nervous around me at first. Everyone said at the start of the year we couldn’t be friends because of our Houses. But now it’s okay, isn’t it?”
His heart stutters all the same until Draco nods. “Yes.”
Draco sighs and Harry chuckles. “I know why
“Cheating certainly seems to belong to Slytherin.”
He’s realized that you can only really have a crush on somebody if you know them. If they let you in, at least a little bit. And where before Draco had wondered about and perhaps even been fascinated by Potter, now he knows he has a full-blown schoolgirl-kind crush on the prat.
“But it hasn’t.” Blaise prompts.
“Sorry, no, I meant a teaching
The relief he’d felt when Draco had told him he’d already known he was going had been too noticeable for Harry not to realize that it wasn’t exactly the reaction he was
Draco gives her a knowing look. “Don’t act like you haven’t charmed the place to let you know whenever anyone opens your gate.”
He has been to the Manor a couple of times before. Once had been an experience Harry never ever wants to repeat. The other… it had been nice.
“No.” Draco repeats. “No we’re not.”
Harry pulls out slowly and then pushes back in. He does it again a bit faster and unintelligible sounds escape both of them.
Ginny breaks up with him before the beginning of October.
The shorter wizard waves him off. “This can be my first round for the night.”
A few more seconds tick by with Draco not knowing what to say. From the looks on everyone else’s faces they feel the same way.
“Please say no.” Neville laments sadly.
Draco frowns. “No he wasn’t.”
? Harry's too good for a lot of people, and he's certainly too good for me." He squeezes his eyes shut tighter. "And I was scared. Of what people would think, and- and I didn't think I would survive it if eventually everyone talked some sense into him and made him realize how much better he could do. You think it would be easy for him to date a former Death Eater?" His eyes open, fierce. "You think the public would love him, you think he could have gotten where he has today in the
Hurriedly he picks up his two winter coats, a pair of earmuffs and a hat and his pair of gloves. He pauses a second, debating, before grabbing Blaise’s pair as well and then he is coming back down to find Potter sitting in a chair across from Pansy laughing.
avoided Azkaban, never mind a lower security prison altogether. I would have thought if anybody had learned the value of mercy it would be you.”
“No, but it’s your fault we’re stuck sitting together in them, isn’t it?”
It’s obvious what she means and they both freeze.
He just… wants something to hold on to. For now.
“Oh.” Again her expression turns knowing and Harry is thankful because he is feeling stupider by the second. “He didn’t tell you about the letters yet did he?”
“You too.” He says automatically. His entire body feels like it’s on fire he’s blushing so hard.
“I’m offended.” Harry says and Draco’s barks a laugh before it tapers into a moan.
The sweater stays on.
He thinks over the past couple of months, back to their library sessions and bickering in classes. The way Malfoy rolls his eyes and sneers anytime he sees Harry surrounded by groups of girls who “are just wondering now that he’s single whether he wanted another girlfriend?”
"I do."
The shorter one blinks at him. She has a Ravenclaw tie. “Um, Moaning Myrtle? Caused a flood in the bathroom?”
Ron narrows his eyes. “Do you? Because I’m not lying.”
“Draco, Draco!”
There are a few times the two of them get close to slipping. Once when Draco is working on a potion and Harry walks in, unannounced like usual, only to see Draco bending over the cauldron to check the smell.
Hermione worries and spontaneously appears by Floo to make him tea some days, usually ending up tidying one or two rooms during her visit, a habit that drives Kreacher mad. After the first few times, back before they left Hogwarts in their final day there, she hasn't tried to tentatively breach the subject of Draco. Which is good, because Harry doesn't want to see the shocked look in her eyes when he starts cursing the git and everything to do with him. When the trickle of men and women start Hermione just looks at him sadly and reminds him to use protective charms.
“It’s true.” He says quietly, holding Mrs. Weasely’s eyes now.
The silver image of a fully formed bird flies up before turning to face them and hovering in the air, beating its marvelous wings to stay up.
He’s made his peace with everything from Sixth Year, at least as much as he thinks is possible. He’ll never be happy or proud to think back to such things, but he no longer shies away from it either. It’s a part of him and always will be- he might as well accept that sooner rather than later.
“I’m sure I will,” Potter replies, looking a bit confused at her sudden change in attitude. “Besides it’s only a week and then I’ll be coming to meet you guys.”
None, thankfully.
“The usual.”
“Dragon.” Draco replies, sounding as if he is ready to be teased further. “That’s what the constellation is supposed to be too, although it’s always looked more like a snake to me.”
“Yes.” Draco thrusts it forward but as soon as Harry’s fingers grab hold he tries to pull it back. “Actually no. Wait.”
“Harry!” Hermione protests in exasperation but he’s moving past them too, grabbing a handful of
Before when Harry had asked him privately, he’d given more detail.
Well then, Draco thinks. That's one thing he might neglect to tell his mother in his letters home. Not that she won't hear about it some other way, he supposes.
“Because you felt bad.”
Draco nods, looking down. He’s blinking quickly and Harry’s heart wrenches itself against his rib cage but he looks away too and doesn’t say anything. “I understand. That’s- that’s smart. I didn’t expect anything, not after all this time, I just… wanted you to know. Everything.”
Draco’s mouthing down his cheek, trailing the bone of Harry’s jaw. “Hmm?” He hums in question.
“And?”
“Maybe,” he agrees. “I really am sorry though. About everything. You deserved a lot better from me.”
“Ridiculously handsome? Why thank you, but that won’t help you now.”
Seconds tick away in silence before she breaks it. “Will you tell me about Harry? The girls didn’t know much when I finally asked them. Most just ran away.”
aren’t enough when you’re already spending all of your magic on healing spells.
He blinks, caught off guard as a few people swarm him. His Aurors seem frozen in place and before Draco knows it a middle-aged woman with bleach-blonde hair is grabbing his arm.
He wants to say it isn’t that easy. That she doesn’t know what she’s talking about and can’t understand. What Harry is asking of him is a lot. Too much. Definitely too soon. He can’t just bare his heart and soul for Harry and trust that the other wizard won’t make a mistake or break it. Draco’s not a trusting person, and while he trusts Harry a hell of a lot more than he does other people, it’s still too daunting for him to be honest with everyone about who he is and trust that Harry will be there to pick up the pieces. Not when he knows how most of the world already feels about him.
“Don’t look at me like that.” Harry whispers and Draco blinks.
He knows Harry hates his father. They’ve talked around the subject a bit, but it remains one of those things between them. Somehow Lucius seems like their most insurmountable difference. After everything, it is Draco’s father that divides them most.
“Stupid things?” Ron looks furious. “Like letting Death Eaters into Hogwarts and trying to kill Dumbledore and accepting the Dark Mark? That can all just be chalked up to him doing stupid things yeah?”
The statue is simple too, like the church, but Draco still feels his breath catch. The sight of Lily and James Potter standing in front of them, even in stone, seems a precious, fragile thing and Draco’s eyes fell on the sculpted baby nestled between them in their arms.
The two of them being anything in secret is too close to home to be a pure fantasy.
“That’s too long.” She whines.
Chapter title from the song 'The Head and the Heart' by Another Story.
“It’s small.” He says as Draco starts tearing at the paper. The actual present is soft and square, and probably two hands width, but the present itself isn’t a big deal. He’d seen the store and thought maybe, with everything that had happened, it could be something to get Draco just in case he ever needed them.
“Her name was Hedwig, right?” He asks, for lack of anything else, watching as Harry moves to sit delicately on the bed.
Ron shrugs, chewing on a chocolate frog. "They probably wouldn't want to make too much of a scene though, don't you think? My dad said Lucius barely batted an eye when they came for him, it looks like they're trying to be..." He frowns and nudges Hermione sitting beside him. "What's that word you used?"
“You haven’t spoken about it at all!” Pansy cried. “Not to me, not to anybody! We’re all worried about the two of you, you’ve been acting bloody mental since school ended!”
Pansy’s eyes are narrowed.
He should have expected the question, he knows he should have. But he’s lost for an answer.
“Morning.” Draco looks down at where Harry’s fingers are moving on his chest over his clothes. “Enjoying yourself?”
Harry squirms a bit, watching while only Hermione and Draco don’t drink.
“Me too.” Draco murmurs and Harry’s relief is obvious.
He smiles. “I want it.”
Harry lets himself be manhandled into having one forearm pressing against the wall, parallel to the floor, and he leans against it, knees already shaking.
"He was the one who told me to be your friend, you know. My father. First he thought I could convince you to be like us. Probably wanted me to get you to eventually join the Dark Side." Draco laughs bitterly. "Then he thought you'd be a good safety net for the family if things didn't work out the way we wanted them to and we needed to betray the Dark Side."
Bloody Pansy. Always has to have the last word.
Harry groans. “How long do you think it will be until they give up?”
"Well, you two have practically been sworn enemies since first year." She replies easily. "Everybody knows how much you hate each other."
“Draco.” He jumps from where he’s been replacing a text on the shelf to turn and look at her. She’s smaller than him, always has been, but she’s no less fierce for it, and with her arms crossed and eyes glaring he feels that old sense of intimidation he’d used to feel around her. Of being wrongfooted and at a distinct disadvantage without him even having to open his mouth.
“I know.” Draco’s voice is soft. “No more lies, no more hiding. No more running. I’m going to be honest, to tell you everything, and maybe you’ll hate me even more or maybe you won’t, but you’ll know what happened. You’ll know however you feel after is real. You know me better than anybody, you know when I’m lying.”
The looks McGonagall and his mother give him are too knowing and he looks away.
So he’s been doing well, he would say. It’s what he does say whenever anyone asks. And Draco ignores the looks from his friends and Mother, ignores the ache he feels whenever Father sends a letter, and above all he ignores any mention of Harry Potter while he gets on with his life.
“I suppose.” She takes a deep breath and rests her head in her hands for a moment. “I suppose it’s just all so daunting. It seems like a big commitment and I’m not sure that’s something I want. A relationship where I’ll have to fight off other people’s opinions and be forced to justify and defend it. Especially right now, so close to the end of my final year here.”
Draco looks back at Dumbledore.
Draco accepts his own drink with a smile and then turns back to Harry when the server leaves. In a rare moment of bravery he says, “Alright, I’m going to ask you a question and you don’t have to answer but you absolutely cannot laugh.”
He ignores his minds immediate answer. Going up to Harry and confessing everything isn’t an option, Draco had decided that long ago. Just because his heart beat faster at the thought and it’s what he wants doesn’t make it a good idea.
doing that again.”
“Kidding.” Harry pushes him back down and Draco glares.
It’s not just Draco, though he’s obviously a big part of it. Harry doesn’t have to live afraid anymore. Or with a worry of dying young. He has more friends than he could have dreamed, friends who come from all corners of life. For Merlin’s sake he’s become friends with Slytherins. Good friends. He’s had to listen to Pansy complaining about her period cramps before she’d left for holidays, and if that didn’t make them close then Harry doesn’t know what will.
Draco frowns. “But hadn’t your Muggles… explained it all to you by then?”
Things are good. And for a while they stay that way.
He steps back a bit, just enough for Draco and Harry to finish their conversation.
“Thanks very much.”
“It’s Harry Potter, Pans.” Had been Draco’s reply and she had sighed again.
Now that Harry thinks about it, this week is quite busy. There seems to be exams in every subject these coming days, and then students leave after classes to go home for Christmas. How much time will Draco and Harry really have to spend together?
Hogwarts has become a home to him. Warm and caring, always open. Where Malfoy Manor had been ruined by Voldemort, Hogwarts and the yearning Draco always felt for its halls only grew.
-but no. That is a pipe dream. He’s here now and after all of his years of work, here is where he’s going to stay. What would everyone think if he let them all down and decided to become a teacher instead of staying on as an Auror? This is what he was meant to do, this is all he’s ever known. Everybody knows that.
Well then. If that's how it's going to be Draco won't make a fool of himself begging to try and change anything.
“Only choice is an oxymoron.” Harry says and then smiles at the look of surprise on Draco’s face. “Hermione told me that.”
Or no, Eighth Year. At the Eighth Year Christmas party. The memory hits him like a blow and he actually shakes his head, trying to focus and ignoring the feelings that are being stirred up.
Harry sucks in a sharp breath. "You bastard," he whispers and Malfoy just smiles coldly. "What the hell did I do, huh?" He asks suddenly, moving to push Malfoy with both hands. "What did I do to hurt you so much?”
He thinks it all over in silence. Harry has missed Draco, there is no denying that. And it’s true that when they had been together things had been amazing. He’s never felt anything like it since and in the years that have passed by Harry still wants it desperately.
He’s chosen to spend the evening relaxing in the Common Room. Initially he’d tried to catch up on some homework, but as soon as he’d finished the first task on his mental list he’d congratulated himself on a job well done and lost his motivation to do any more. When Seamus had begun a game of Exploding Snap- well. Harry had been done for really.
His mother's warning rings in his head.
Harry feels bewildered but, after glancing between them and seeing them both nod, he slowly takes out his wand. “Alright.”
“Roses.” Harry finishes for him, spinning to take in the sea of white, red and pink. “I can see that.”
"Harry." Kingsley's voice is slightly chastening but he relents after Harry meets his eyes. "Continue. Please."
“Or badges?” Harry laughs when Draco shoots him a look. “You know what I mean though, and it is your fault really. I can’t be blamed.”
"I do.”
It takes until the early hours of the morning but by the time they fall asleep Draco knows all about Harry’s Seventh Year. He knows about the horcruxes and Harry even mentions the Deathly Hallows, something Draco had always thought was a kids story. His father had heard things about them being real, and he’d heard Harry’s words during his duel with Voldemort, but Draco had still always dismissed it as lies.
“How is this hurting my chances? Harry’s perfectly happy.”
It’s not that Draco isn’t laughing along with everyone else as Blaise strips down to his pants and then gets yelled at by security until he puts his clothes back on. He helps stop Neville when he moves to go to save Ron from making a tit of himself while trying to give Blaise the threatening and stern big brother talk as both of them are sloshed. And when Theo starts tearfully recalling memories of Hogwarts, both before and during Eighth Year, Draco throws crisps at him along with Blaise because they certainly didn’t need any more angst tonight.
They both wait.
He’s been careful to keep it that way anyhow. When Draco had come in for the first time it had been Ron who’d shown him downstairs to the floor where potions and spells are researched and created. It has been Ron receiving all of Draco’s reports and Ron who handles any requests or questions the blonde wizard might have. Harry has stayed away because Draco hasn’t asked for him to do otherwise.
“Right then,” Draco says to himself and decides to just head down to breakfast by himself. He’s too hungry to wait.
After that success Harry’s signed Holyhead Harpies jersey (courtesy of Ginny) is less of a success than it otherwise might have been, though still gratefully received. The dragons continue to crawl and hover around them as they go on with the day. Teddy blows out all of the candles on his cake and gets icing all over his face. Harry takes a huge slice, suddenly starving, and he looks over to catch Draco watching him lick the icing off his fork.
“Why?”
“I’m sorry,” he offers lamely.
He waits but when Draco doesn’t do anything he holds his hands out, getting a bit impatient. “Well can I open it?”
“I didn’t think you would want me to!” Harry protests immediately, looking at Ginny in a mixture of betrayal and astonishment. “Back when we spoke you still didn’t seem entirely sure-”
He nods and stands up. She hovers with him. “I would hug you if I could.”
“Harry.” Draco stops him by putting a hand on his arm. “I wasn’t going to say boring. Actually I was thinking it was peaceful. It reminds me of the Manor, in a way.”
“Noble Cottage!” She calls and the flames flare green before she disappears.
It just seemed like he and Ginny had been together so
“Yeah.” Draco eyes him again, this time in consideration rather than concern. “Where’s this come from Blaise?”
“She didn’t look scared of you at all.”
They sit and drink in silence, Harry in the chair across from Draco’s desk. Eventually it’s the other wizard who breaks the silence.
The liquid is sloshing around the cup in his hand because he’s trembling so hard.
Look, I don't care if this is a rip off of Hagrid's gift in the first book, as someone with multiple photo albums the idea was too tantalizing for me not to write it. Also that is the only time Petunia features even a little bit in this fic. Some of you might think it's ooc, but again: the idea was too good to pass up.
“Parkinson.”
Millicent lets out a breath, suddenly appearing bored of the conversation. “I’m off to speak to Luna, actually. Ta for now.”
“Sounds lovely!” She says back and it’s then that Harry walks into the old-fashioned living room and spots his godson jumping around on the middle of the large rug playing with the Lego Harry had got him about a year ago.
(He fails.)
“Yeah. Mostly them. We both knew that it would be a big topic in the press, that Draco was already under enough scrutiny and fire, and after what happened when it came out that we were just friends… well neither of us really wants a repeat of that. And it’ll be a thousand times worse when people find out we’re seeing each other.”
For a second the thought of saying those three words to Draco goes through Harry’s mind but he pushes it away. The moment is already heavy enough and besides, everything is still too new and early. They have so much time left to figure everything out. There’s no rush.
“Coming?” Ron asks him and he nods, stepping forward.
Draco’s looks past Harry’s shoulder, wondering how he can put it so that Harry will understand. “I just… it never felt right, telling them. I wasn’t sure at first, and I tried to convince myself it wasn’t true when I finally was definite. I ignored it for a while. And after that, well. I know they would all understand better than anybody why being gay is tantamount to marrying a Muggle for a Pureblood. I didn’t want their pity or- or for them to think less of me. And then in Sixth and Seventh Year we had more important things to worry about.”
“If you’re still amenable,” Draco says quietly, not quite meeting his eyes as he grips a stack of papers in his hands tightly. “I think your idea was a good one and I’d like to try it.”
“Draco-” His mother makes a sound but he ignores her and so does his old Headmistress.
“Come on you two,” Ron grabs Harry’s sleeve gently. “Stop ignoring the rest of us and join in for once, would you?”
“Do you not want to?”
“Argh!” His friend makes a disgusted sound and sits back, looking away. “Forget it. I’ll figure it out myself.”
“And that it took so long for
They lay in silence for a bit, just comfortable to be in each other’s space, until Draco’s face lights up. “It’s Christmas Eve.”
“Well I was just thinking.” Ron leans forward. “It took Charlie a long time to tell us all even though most witches and wizards are fine with it. And I remembered something Hermione said a while back about how acceptance was still a big issue with a lot of Muggles.”
And he haltingly launches into a quick explanation of Eighth Year and falling in love with Draco over drinking games and House parties. He tells them that the day before they had been about to go public Draco had ended things and briefly confesses what had happened between them at the Christmas party, not even having it within him to blush, though Ron certainly does.
Draco silently agrees and looks around once more. The lighting in the tent is enough to make everything stand out clearly but not so much that it is overwhelming or harsh. Looking at Blaise in his green robes with silver trim, Draco thinks the lighting is charmed to suit everybody the best it can. The darker tone of Blaise’s skin is a nice contrast to the colourful cloth, and his hair is artfully styled into a short spike.
“Mum.” Percy speaks before Molly can reply. “Sometimes- people can get caught up and they can make choices they regret.”
“I also happen to have a lot of customers at my shop who are siblings or parents from students at Hogwarts.” George retorts. “Not to mention students themselves. Shameless gossips, I tell you.”
“Who told you that?”
He turns over on the bed.
“Thank you!” Teddy repeats. He’s currently laughing as he’s swarmed by what looks like six of the dragons crawling over him. “These are
Harry blushes darker. He hadn’t considered that anyone was still awake when he’d gotten back and desperately tries to remember whether or not he’d cast a
A blushing McGonagall is something Harry had truly never thought he would see. “I saw her last night.”
The fact that means House Elves had been in the room is not exactly one Harry wants to confront this morning.
He’s surprised at the bit of anger he feels looking at her now. He’s worked so hard to move past it and keep things civil with his parents. He’s never brought up the letters or being gay or Harry again and neither have they. At first it had been difficult, but he’d also been in France for six months. By the time he’d come back home Draco had resigned himself to everything.
And maybe, Draco thinks now, maybe it had been an apology gift, because this was after his Third Year, after the mess with the Chamber of Secrets, and though Draco hadn’t known about his father’s involvement until recently, he isn’t stupid enough to think his mother had been unaware. His parents told each other everything.
“Afternoon, Hagrid.” Draco nods at him before moving to delicately sit inside. He takes Harry’s usual seat so Harry sits beside him, taking in the litter of small cakes and pastries on Hagrid’s kitchen table.
“Hello Hagrid!” Hermione smiles widely. “I’m sorry I didn’t have a chance to visit but I’ll make sure to drop by first thing when we get back.”
because if his mum was anything to go by it was the biggest disgrace to wizarding Britain to date.’”
, which should be explanation enough. Eventually Harry does start to look uncomfortable. “Look, if it bothers you-”
Blaise actually laughs a bit.
"Now you're both just indifferent. Or pretending to be." She says, eyes seeming to pierce him. "Which is worse, in a way."
“She had a picture of Mum and Snape.” Harry’s finger hovers over the picture of the two of them at the train. “How did that happen?”
“You’re absolutely positive neither you nor Lucius wrote them?”
“I don’t care if it means I have you.” Harry says. “That’s the difference between us, isn’t it? All I want is you. We can do this if we’re together. The two of us… I don’t see an end date and I don’t want one. We’ve been through so much, don’t you think we can deal with everyone else? I just need you to choose me, Draco, and whatever happens after that we can handle it.”
He’s not sure who opens their mouths first only that soon the kiss turns wet for a reason entirely different than Harry’s tears. The kiss turns hot and wanting and earnest in a way Harry has felt only a few times before in his life.
“I’ve missed you so fucking much.” Harry says into his skin, not even sure if Draco can understand him. The music from the hall reaches them faintly and their panting is so loud his whispered words could be lost in the air between them forever.
"It's not my fault we're together in two classes, Malfoy!"
Blaise lets out a breath. “They call him baby Fred but he’s over two years old now.” He says as an aside to Draco.
Draco hesitates. He’s not going to tell Blaise he’s thinking about talking to Harry about telling some more people. Not until he’s surer. “Then I’ll decide at the time. There’s no point hypothesizing, it won’t do any of us any good.”
"No?" Draco prowls forward, almost predatory. Relentless and vicious, unlike anything Harry had ever seen from him before. This is Draco knowing how to hurt him, knowing better than anybody else how to wound him, and Harry should have known that it would come to this. To the two of them knowing each other so well that they know exactly where to aim their blows to cripple the other. "Remember how you begged for it, Harry, for anything I would give you? That doesn't sound like what you described. Or the way the simplest touches from me would have you falling apart. And then there's the way you begged me not to end things, you even talked to Blaise about it afterwards-"
It’s a long time later that he pulls away and Harry looks unhappy when he makes out the wet streaks on Draco’s face.
Ron appears beside Harry.
“Ah.” Draco rolls his shoulders a bit and shifts his weight. “He was just helping me with something.”
“Hey, I’m the sexiest goblin you’ll ever see,” Ginny says, and Dean wolf whistles at her.
He can already tell this year will be very, very different.
“Right, yeah. That’s good.” She smiles as Ron and Hermione settle on the floor beside Harry. “You look gorgeous, Ron, whose wardrobe did you raid? Or was it a special purchase for yourself?”
“Me.” Draco looks delighted. A new scarf is hanging around his shoulders and he’s holding an unopened bag of chocolate frogs. When Harry looks closer he thinks he can make out Neville’s handwriting on the tag. “I hope you aren’t disappointed?”
“No. Nothing at all.”
He pictures Draco in the morning, soft and sleepy. He remembers Quidditch games and his fingers flex from the yearning that tears through him to have those again. Harry thinks of the way Draco has always listened to him, always been interested in anything he has to say, not because he is Harry Potter the Saviour, but simply because he is Harry.
Draco closes his eyes tiredly. “Blaise-”
. How will three more people knowing about us help when someone else comes up to ask me on a date? Why do you expect me to just be able to sit there like you and watch from the side as people flirt with you right in front of me? How do you think that feels?”
He’s just opening his mouth to say something- a plea for Blaise to stay out of it, to say that he doesn’t have anything to say anyway, anything to get him out of the impending conversation- but Blaise cuts him off.
“You are!” Draco insists. “You’re mad because I didn’t invite you to Lovegood’s Halloween party?”
“Were we having one?” Draco takes another bite and looks at him, a teasing glint in his eye. “Can’t say I noticed.”
Hermione frowns again but Draco changes the subject before she can say anything. “Excited for Hogsmeade you two?”
“I’m too smart to take that bet. He’ll stop when he’s tired.”
“Harry, I’m worried about you.”
“There, Draco, fuck, keep doing that.” The blonde curls his fingers and Harry suddenly wishes he could see Draco’s face, wishes he could read what he’s feeling from his expression because the labored pants Harry feels brushing the backs of his thighs aren’t enough.
“I could keep working on developing new potions and research in any spare time,” Draco says. “More as a hobby than a job now, which I’m fine with to be honest. The pay is good, as you well know, and I suppose I don’t mind being around so many kids, even if they’re not all ours.”
He nods and finally looks up to meet Harry’s eyes. “I do think about it. And I miss it. I miss a lot of things.”
“Of course,” Draco murmurs, but Harry thinks he’s the only one to hear it.
He trails off, still avoiding the weight of her gaze. “And even during the war, he didn’t let me die, Molly. He saved my life. More than once.”
They’re quiet for a few minutes before Hermione tries again. “Harry-”
Pansy's eyes widen, but only fractionally. "You were on the train?"
Which Harry had to agree to. He’d had several conversations with Pansy since Halloween- actual conversations about things that didn’t make Harry want to rip his own hair out- and he had to admit he might have judged her too quickly when they were kids. She had this aura of being conceited and full of disdain, but the more Harry gets to know her the more he realizes she does most of that to watch how others react to it. As if she puts on a fake persona to get to know you before she allows you to get to really know her back.
"Talk to him."
why he's like this, he knows who changed Harry's opinions on love and relationships so much that he's now become everything he was never comfortable with before.
“Just thought I’d see how you were doing after last night.” She turns around to smile at him knowingly and hands over a Hangover Potion. “I heard you might be needing it.”
“They’re celebrities to everyone. Even to me.” He says quietly. “But I’ve known people who became just as famous, people who are remembered just as fondly. And I know it can’t be the whole truth.”
“Yeah.” Harry blows out a long breath and looks up at the canopied ceiling. “She was pretty much my only friend when I was back with the Dursley’s.”
He steps back. “What?”
“Don’t, Draco.” Harry gasps, eyes screwed closed. “It’s too much,
“Yes?”
Draco dips his head, his cheeks flushing. Harry finds it endearing. “Thank you.”
Harry pushes him a bit but can’t stop the short laugh that escapes him. “Tosser.”
Blaise does snort at that. “Complicated is putting it lightly, Potter.”
McGonagall shrugs. “I was curious and unwilling to believe you based solely on your word.”
Draco snorts beside him quietly but the rest are nodding and Harry nudges his friend in the side for being an arse.
“I never really got to know him.” Narcissa says after a long pause. “Regulus yes, everyone knew Regulus. He was one of the best Death Eaters the Dark Lord had in the beginning. But Sirius left my aunt and uncle’s home when he was quite young. From then on it was as if he never existed in our family.” Her lips twist. “Though of course we all knew that he was innocent of betraying your parents as the Ministry thought.”
But Draco bites the inside of his cheek briefly.
“Right.” Draco flushes. “She uses them for her perfume.”
He wastes no time shoving them to the side with his foot as well and then the two of them really come together, skin pressed to skin, legs intertwined as they stand as close as possible in the stall under the water’s spray.
Draco frowns. “Harry, what the hell are you talking about? If anyone should be mad or freaked out it should be
"What?" He asks in bewilderment. "No, I don't know what you-"
The two boys do not speak to each other in the months after Hogwarts. They forbid any mention of one another and avoid worried looks that belong to their friends and family.
“Fucking Christ!” Draco jerks. “I meant with lube.”
“Then what’s the problem?”
“I don’t know.” Harry says eventually. “But even if mine is a bit… on the nose, it doesn’t mean everyone else’s is. What about people whose name means something like tree? Or- or crooked nose?”
There are unspoken words between them, even now. They’re clear to see in one another’s eyes.
Harry moves up and away and Draco looks at him suspiciously before doing as he’s told. “Um, how do you want me?”
“We were wondering where you’d got to Harry,” Hermione is saying as she comes to sit beside him. “Then we ran into Pansy in the Great Hall and she told us you and Draco had been out all morning for a walk. We’ve been looking all around the grounds for you two before Ron suggested coming here. Aren’t you cold?”
on him, he can feel it, but he also has a sneaking suspicion that Kingsley and McGonagall hadn’t been entirely truthful about all the precautions they’d be taking. Perhaps he’s wrong, but Draco suspects there is at least one Auror tailing them to make sure he doesn’t try anything.
Draco moves to stretch across the bed, grabbing the bottle of lube from his bedside drawer. There’s still a bit of an ache from last night and his body hums with the knowledge that it will subside in just a few moments.
Harry quickly moves his hands up to grip Draco’s shoulders, pulling him into his body and stepping back. The spray hitting his back makes him lurch forwards, but that only brings the two of them closer together so he sinks into the movement. His arms move up to wrap around Draco’s neck and the angle of their mouths changes, making everything much wetter, but also hotter, somehow. Decidedly filthier.
“Forget it, Malfoy.”
A startled smile escapes Draco’s face and Harry moves a bit closer without thinking, just aching, somewhere, deep inside, to reach out, to touch Draco’s cheek and to softly press his lips against the other boy’s.
The games continue for a bit until people start drifting off to sit on the couches and talk. Harry leaves to chat with Blaise and Ron about the latest Quidditch match, which draws the attention of Ginny, Pansy and Draco. Eventually all of them are sitting comfortably around a knee-high coffee table, squeezed together in the slightly limited space, and Harry has a sudden feeling that this is what he wants his future to be like after Hogwarts. These people all together visiting one house or other and keeping in touch.
“Draco? He went to visit Hagrid and hasn’t come back yet.”
“Yes.”
She smiles in excitement. “Okay, I promise. Hope to die and everything.” She burst out into fresh giggles.
“Potter. Wait.” Draco turns to look at Pansy and Blaise, nodding towards the Muggle Studies room. “You lot will be late and get points knocked off for being tardy if you don’t get moving.”
It lasts an embarrassingly short amount of time. Barely five minutes and Harry climaxes with a choked groan, his eyes closing and mouth open from panting. Draco watches him, feels him and keeps moving until eventually Harry’s eyes open again and he pulls away with a tired sound.
Her lips twitch and it makes his eyes narrow. “You know, he said the exact same thing.”
He notices Draco shoot him a look but it’s Luna who says it. “So that’s why you were using Draco’s wand.”
Pansy will walk through his house, picking up stray clothing with her wand and muttering, "And we're friends with this slob?" under her breath. She'll say nothing else, but the looks she gives him are questioning and worried deep down, and he wonders if she sees Draco in a similar way. If he's doing any better or worse than Harry is.
He leads him to the Slytherin’s quarters, and they let go of one another’s hands but don’t stop at the Common Room. Harry greets a few of the younger years, which surprises Draco, but doesn’t hesitate to follow him back into Draco’s deserted dormitory. Draco feels him watching as he practically chucks his book bag on the floor at the foot of his bed and turns around to stare at Harry.
The two of them slip onto the Gryffindor bench and Harry keeps watching Draco even as the other wizard begins piling his plate up with food.
So they spend a lot of time together, he and Harry, and that’s nice and Draco is happy with it but there is always that little part of him that wants more.
Draco looks away, shrugging. “Mother said that it couldn’t be true, that I’d be messing up her future plans and ruining the Malfoy name for good. Father was much more detailed and said I would be kicked out of the will, disinherited, cut off and once you’d grown tired of being with me I’d be left to myself to navigate the wizarding world that hated me and my family. That I would inevitably end up disappointed, heartbroken and alone. So.”
She had stared at him for a while but he had watched her back. He was worried about her, had been ever since she started sleeping with Theo to distract herself from her feelings for Blaise. It was dangerous, what she was doing, not only for the boys, but mostly for herself.
“What?” Draco snaps finally. “What’s the problem? We’re only in Eighth Year, why do I need to decide this all now?”
Ron’s looking back and forth between them and Draco can see the gears turning in his head before he finally speaks. “Harry requested you work on this case since you’re the best when it comes to
“He shouldn’t have to lose his family.” Harry mutters. “Nobody should have to go through that.”
Lyrics taken from the song "Saturn" by Sleeping at Last
“Ron was being rude.” Harry finally answers him, making Draco scoff.
“Really.” Harry’s voice is flat. Disbelieving.
“Got it in one, Potter.” He smirks before the weight of memories fully sinks in.
“One second, Mr. Potter.” Donna holds a hand up to stop him as he moves forward to do the same.
And there’s nothing else he can do after that.
“Dunno, but I’m feeling all weird. Light. Giddy. That sort of thing.”
“Warm me up then?”
The award- a glass statue of a potion vial and miniature cauldron with a rectangular base and plaque underneath it- is actually quite comforting and he grips it tightly and begins speaking.
“Especially when those friends are former Death Eaters.” Molly comes bustling in with a tray in her hands, Arthur and Percy following, both of them laden with food as well. “So? What’s that about?”
Harry shifts, feels Draco pressed against him and tries not to squish the other boy who is talking to Ron. “Even if parents died most people have other relatives to spend the holidays with. It was mostly students who fought anyway.”
Draco tries not to wonder what that response means. Instead he just keeps speaking. “Father had this garden built for her a few years ago.”
Harry steps closer to him. "Whatever you're doing," he says lowly, "stop. Please, Draco. I don't know why you're saying these things but it wasn't- I know it was real. You can't- you couldn't have lied to me about everything. Not after all that you told me."
“Oi, what the
Harry stares. “That’s not like you, Gin.”
His mind races, trying to remember who it was Draco had said would be at the conference. Most of the names he comes up with were foreign, based out of mainland Europe or Africa, with a few from Canada and South America. Only a few had been from the UK. Draco and Thelonius had been the only ones from England.
Laleh nods, unflinching as she meets Draco’s eyes. “He wouldn’t like me very much.” When she catches Harry’s questioning look she clarifies. “I’m Muggleborn. And an immigrant from Iran.”
“And now you want to invite him to the Halloween party? Are you insane?” Ron hisses. “Do you value Hermione that little or are you just acting crazy because the war’s over and Voldemort’s gone, because I honestly don’t know anymore.”
we know you and Draco were together in Eighth Year."
“Myrtle, if I tell you you’re going to have to keep it secret.”
She doesn’t know about the Shield Charm he’s had up since they
“Harry.” Hermione speaks quietly, and he jumps before facing her, seeing Ron watching him with a curious expression. When he glances at Ginny she is staring at him in surprise. Hermione’s face is full of concern.
As it is, he just feels his stomach twist unpleasantly and he thinks once again that maybe coming here was a mistake.
He pulls away for a second, intending to kiss the corner of Draco’s mouth, to taste and lick the skin there, and Draco's hands come down to rest lightly on his chest -
Harry shrugs, hoping it’s the right answer.
“Go.”
He meets Draco’s eyes before looking away quickly again.
More than anything he wants that look, the resigned acceptance in Harry’s eyes, to fuck right off.
“He was a good man.”
He closes his eyes and groans, hiding his face in his hands. “I don’t know.”
It was after that night that he was walking back with Ron and Hermione to the Common Room, the three of them arm in arm with Harry in the middle, that they brought up him and Draco again.
“Look,” he makes an effort to soften, to reach out and touch her elbow lightly, “I’ll speak to him. Today, later, whatever. We’ll sort it out.”
“Are you alright Mr. Malfoy?”
And Harry has no trouble making himself seem at home in the Slytherin room either. He doesn’t have the same fear of getting hexed that Draco did, but the first time had been a bit awkward with everyone watching them. Luckily Pansy and Theo were a good buffer for attention, and Blaise and Millie had been there in solidarity the first couple of visits, so eventually not only is Harry a common feature of the Slytherin Common Room, but some other Gryffindors like Ginny, Ron and Hermione were as well.
McGonagall doesn’t look convinced. “Don’t try to lie to me, Narcissa.”
“No, it’s not that.” Draco murmurs, finally turning to face him. “I just- after all the times I’ve hurt you I want to prove that I mean it this time. I need to show you I was telling the truth. No matter what comes I’ll face it. As long as I get you at the end of it all.”
Harry and Hermione share surprised smiles.
He’s shocked they haven’t had any explosive arguments like their old days, but at the same time… he’s not so surprised by it really. Before, half of the time they fought was just to release tension and get each other’s attention. These days they have no shortage of that, and now they have found new ways of working off steam.
At least that's what Kingsley had said. Since Harry is such an influential figure now and all.
Then he stops quickly into
And he is trusted in return. Harry asking him to visit his parents grave… it’s more than Draco ever would have expected.
“Come with me.” He requests and pulls back just enough to see Draco nod while both of their eyes darken.
Draco looks away.
Draco raises an eyebrow, looking at the finger of whiskey left in the bottle with an unimpressed look. "Seriously?"
“Oh do you? I thought you were too busy being insulted.”
“What?” The Gryffindor asks, but he’s ignored by everyone except Ron and Hermione.
“Thanks guys,” Ginny is beaming. “Alright that was it. We just wanted to let you all know.”
“Please tell me it gets a bit more lively than this though. I expected better from our Ministry, I must say.”
He has no idea what’s going on but Ginny seems serious and Harry will do his best to be there for whatever she needs.
“I don’t know!” She says but her hands release his to flutter back to her own lap as she straightens. “I had no idea what you would say, that’s why I was so nervous.”
He clears his throat, ignoring memories of sneaking from his room to his mother’s, memories of hearing Voldemort prowling about the house, or the random screaming that came from downstairs. The sound of Aunt Bella’s maniacal laughter tickles at his ears, almost audible now, and Draco closes his eyes, breathing shakily, and shakes his head sharply, not looking at Harry anymore.
Slowly Draco looks at him, one eyebrow delicately raised. “Is that so?”
Only to be met with an obviously tired Draco slowly straightening and taking stock of the situation.
But when he looks over Harry is smiling. “That was brilliant, Draco! Honestly. Good for you.”
The other wizard looks doubtful.
A choked noise escapes him, making the eyes in the flames shoot to Draco behind the spectacles. The face of his old Headmistress immediately softens. “Oh, Draco. How are you? Did you need something?”
He looks like a teenager, trying to do well in school and keep his head down. Like a boy who, Harry is starting to suspect, takes notes in Potions just in case Harry doesn't pay attention and ends up needing them, because Malfoy doesn't seem to ever look back and use them at all.
"Harry is very passionate," Ginny says. "But he has a hard time showing it. With you though... it was always obvious, right from the start. You got under each other's skin in a way nobody else could."
“Oh.” He wonders how he can politely answer her question when the immediate answer that springs to his mind sounds so condescending and sarcastic.
There are fights. There are tears and kisses and apologies. There is teasing and comforting and children.
Nelson lets out a gasp and Harry glares at Draco as Lynne laughs. They’re interrupted by Laleh sliding in to sit on the other side of Harry and looking between them all in confusion.
They make it to the bathroom in silence, the two of them working together to get Harry up the stairs. Draco leaves him to brush his teeth and wash up for bed after he checks the cabinet to make sure there are a couple of Hangover Potion bottles there. He grabs one and takes it to Harry’s room, having to check several rooms before finding the right one, and he leaves it on the bedside table.
“I know I could have gotten you a gold cauldron or something, but I thought… well, I figured no one else would get you this.”
They break off into huddles, deciding who will play what position. The only other Quidditch team player on Harry’s team is Keanu who usually plays Chaser.
All he wants, he realizes suddenly, is for Draco to be happy. Carefree might be too much to ask, and Harry doesn’t really think anyone is carefree after Voldemort, but happy shouldn’t be too much to hope for, is it?
His friend’s lips settle into a thin unhappy line. “Fine. Then I’ll leave it.”
So he’s completely surprised when the words he actually says are, “I kissed Potter last night.”
“I do.”
No, it’s the flush on his cheeks and the brilliant happiness in his eyes that has Harry staring at him. Even while Draco carefully puts his wrapped present on the table and turns to face him, Harry’s eyes are still roving over the blonde, taking in every detail he can as quickly as he can.
“Distantly,” Draco says, “but yes. We are.” At Harry’s raised eyebrow he rolls his eyes. “Please. I’ve had to know my family tree since I was three.” His grin turns wry. “You don’t know how much torture it was all these years to know I shared some small part of my DNA with Ron.”
A look of relief takes over Draco’s expression and he agrees quietly before moving to go and sit at Gryffindor table beside Harry. They ignore the familiar looks they get, though Harry notes it’s much less than they’d used to, and he has to hide a smile at the fact. Truthfully, it’s not just their friend group who dare to break the House table rules. So far Harry’s never seen any of the staff comments on it.
“No.” Draco says firmly.
He stumbles out of bed, going to the bathroom and brushing his teeth before grabbing his bathrobe and heading downstairs.
“Hey there big man,” Harry says and can’t help the flare of warmth that goes through him when Teddy’s pink-haired head shoots up and he immediately starts babbling in excitement.
For a moment Draco looks horror struck. “What?”
Harry’s staring at him. “You can’t be serious?”
“How could anyone ever fit one into a room?”
"It's because you were mean to Hagrid." Harry blurts out.
It isn't as if Pansy hasn't heard it from him before.
“I-” Harry starts but a woman’s voice interrupts him.
it. He knew if it had been Draco with the broom things would have gone the exact same way. “Me neither.”
The conversation has been dangerous, sure, edging around painful memories, but the way Draco is looking at Harry now hits him like a
Despite the battle, despite the Carrows stalking the hallways and the bloodshed of Seventh Year or the horrors of Sixth, this place has too many good memories to be completely ruined. Even for Draco. Especially for Draco.
“No,” Harry says, smiling up at Hagrid. “Are you busy?”
“Dumbledore had a
“It absolutely is not! Harry back me up here.” Draco demands, making Ron splutter.
“I know!” He bends down and shifts the wrapped gift under one arm to hoist Teddy up, feigning struggling under his weight to make the birthday boy giggle. “How old are you now, huh? A hundred?”
Of course, while watching Potter for years it had been impossible not to also see the bags come and go from under his eyes. It was difficult to ignore the exhaustion that made the boys shoulders turn inwards, his pained smiled to his friends, the words that made him flinch, the way his hand trembled sometimes when he held his cutlery to eat dinner.
For now.
Draco’s thoughts halt and he looks back at Harry. Eventually though he realizes Harry is right. He nods.
Her smile is brilliant and Harry finds himself returning it.
“Harry.” He looks slightly desperate, eyes roving Harry’s face, meeting his eyes with a plea shining clearly. “I regret it. Not knowing him.”
“Thanks for all your help mate.” Ron smiles at him. “If it doesn’t pan out I’ll owl you.” His grin grows. “And I’ll owl you if it does.”
Harry grins, suddenly proud. “I have stories.”
Draco decides not to care.
Harry speeds up and Draco responds in kind and soon the only sound is them panting, their skin coming together and separating over and over again. Sweat slickens their bodies but Harry only presses closer to Malfoy and relishes the feeling when Draco presses right back. He can’t help his head dropping to the upper right corner of Draco’s back and he mouths at the skin there, not quite kissing but needing to feel Draco under him, wanting to have as much of him as he could.
“Not when we could be kissing instead, it’s not.”
“And what about me?” He asks quietly. “Do you think my parents would enjoy hearing about our relationship from a news rag instead of from me directly?”
“To be fair you did.” Draco says as they head towards the suddenly full living room. “I told you that you were wrong.”
The only time he remembers feeling like this was in the Forbidden Forest the night he had died. There is emotion fighting to break through a barrier inside of him, he can feel it on the edges, but something is stopping it for now. And he knows he should be processing everything but all he can really think of is the day Draco had broken up with him and tried to ignore him and how Harry had been right not to give up hope all this time.
“Oh yes. We’re leaving in about twenty minutes and I was wondering whether you’d all like to walk together?”
Draco’s mistake is taking a beat too long to answer the look with one of his own. His hands are still trembling so much that for the first time he curses the fact he doesn’t wear Muggle clothes, and thus has no pockets to hide them in. For the first time Harry seems to notice Draco’s state because his eyes take him in from head to toe before the wizard frowns.
Blaise actually looks a little frightened when Draco finally meets his eyes.
But nothing had happened.
“Well I don’t have to have anything to do with it if you’d rather.” Harry shrugs still looking away at some papers littering Ron’s desk. “But I’d like to be involved if you think it will work. It would be easier to be able to ask you things directly instead of talking through Ron. I promise no nasty comments, no looks, nothing. I’ll be professional. It might make things easier if- in the future.”
Pansy, for instance comes and sits with him in the Common Room the same day as the Potions incident.
Ron swallowed. “Right. But-”
Neville is frantically trying to wave down a passing server for a pitcher of water, Seamus and Dean are both dragging his hand down because, “This is a party, Neville, we drink and die of hangovers tomorrow like men.”
stuff, we never talk about that. The war and everything that came with it, both of us just skip over it all. And it’s not just you or me, but both of us. And I guess what I’m trying to say is that I need somebody I can talk about that stuff with.”
Not that Draco seems to be complaining.
She shakes her head. “Not without bringing ruin upon my own family.”
“As if this isn’t.” Pansy mutters and Ron nods frantically.
“More than anything,” she promises and then pulls away and stands quickly. “Now then. I think I’ll go see if the roses need trimming.”
When his eyes find Draco he sees the blonde watching it intently before feeling Harry’s eyes on him and turning to grin in challenge. With an answering look Harry mounts and kicks up, feeling the wind whistle in his hair as he and Draco move to hover in front of each other in the pitch, their teams spread behind them.
“Pansy!” He yells, getting up off of the bed to stand and glare at her. “Just shut up, okay? Whatever you and the others seem to hope is going to happen, it won’t. You’re right, we saw each other at the wedding and it ended in a total fucking disaster. Which surprised nobody except you. Potter hates me, always has and always will. I don’t need nor want to beg my way back into his good graces.” Draco takes in a deep breath. “And if you’re going to keep going on about it after I’ve repeatedly asked you to stop I’m going to ask you to leave.”
“Definitely.” Draco says, moving to sit over on the faded stone bench underneath the window. A soft light is shining in and when Myrtle comes to sit beside him it shines right through her, making her nearly invisible.
Nerves fill Harry suddenly, and it isn’t because of Ron’s appearance. He wonders if the Room is actually fixed, or if signs of the fire will still be obvious.
Harry immediately feels himself close off. “It was alright.”
She doesn’t.
“Because it’s her
But the other wizard says, “If you had then I’m positive you would be more sure of the fact.”
Blaise nods. “I know. Even Ginny’s getting a bit exasperated with it though.”
Harry starts in surprise.
“Oh I’m not the one about to be satisfied.” Harry says and while Draco is lost giggling to himself at the horrible line the other boy moves further away. If Draco weren’t so busy laughing at him he might have been wondering what Harry is doing.
"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad," said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.
"You know perfectly well what I mean."
But what they were, they didn't find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a night-time visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower.
Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid. He had written only two words: '
"I?" Dumbledore seemed to hesitate, Harry saw him glance at the mirror. "I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks."
"You've got to eat some breakfast."
"Don't you care about Gryffindor? do you only care about yourselves? I don't want Slytherin or any other house to win the house cup, and you'll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells!"
It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.
"Well I think it's a load of bollocks."
"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone."
The mail came a short while after and, as always, Ulysses dropped a letter and package onto his lap and landed on the table beside him.
Bane kicked his back legs in anger.
Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.
"Double Potions with the Slytherins," said Ron. "Snape's Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favours them- we'll be able to see if it's true."
"Won it," Hagrid replied with a hint of pride in his tone. "Las' night. I was down in the village havin' a few drinks an' got into a game o' cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest."
As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn't too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?
Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside.
"Oh, move over!" Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, "Alohomora!"
"I'm serious, Harry, don't go."
"Ten weeks," Hermione snapped. "That's not ages, that's like a second to Nicolas Flamel."
"D'you think I'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I'll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up."
"Of course there are," said Ron. "Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who've spotted them, to make them forget."
"Resign?" Wood thundered. "What good'll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can't win at Quidditch?"
The caretaker, Argus Filch was extremely unpleasant. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn't believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing. Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-coloured creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch's. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she'd whisk off for Filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.
"I'm sayin' nothin, said Hagrid flatly.
"That's your problem," said Ron. "We've got to go, we're going to be late."
"Obviously, you've just done so," Dumbledore smiled. "You may ask me one more thing, however."
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.
Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it.
"Happy Yule, Harry.." said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his dressing gown.
Then she suddenly smiled.
At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid's binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.
Ronan pawed the ground nervously. "I'm sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best, " he said in his gloomy voice.
"Mrs. Norris?" breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.
"That wouldn't surprise me." Harry joked, He picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was '
"I don't want more trouble," he mumbled.
Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-turn and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.
"Ah, Hagrid, the last tree- put it in the far corner, would you?"
The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:
"Nearly there!" Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.
"Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?" he asked excitedly.
An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, "- your little bit of hocus-pocus. I'm waiting."
"Harry!" Neville burst Out, the moment he saw the other two. "I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag-"
Professor McGonagall, in a tartan dressing gown and a hairnet, had Malfoy by the ear.
"Absolutely," said Professor McGonagall crisply. "The boy's a natural. I've never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?"
Anyway, I hope you enjoyed!
The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy because he shouted "Catch it if you can, then!" and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.
"Throw it away and punch him on the nose," Ron suggested.
"Hagrid!"
"You can see them any old time," said Ron. "Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren't you eating anything?"
"Oh, we're not working," Harry told him brightly. "Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we've been trying to find out who he is."
He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.
"What am I studying for? Are you crazy? Do you realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? They're very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don't know what's gotten into me..."
"Harry, you need your strength," said Seamus Finnigan. "Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team."
"I bet on merlins baggy underpants that his broom wasn't even acting up."
"And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry," said Ron. "He's not exactly recent if he's six hundred and sixty-five, is he?"
Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them.
"But... Why?" Asked Goyle.
"Would you mind moving out of the way?" came Malfoys drawl from behind them. "Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose- that hut of Hagrid's must seem like a palace compared to what your family's used to."
Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the register, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name.
"Bin watchin' from me hut," said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, "But it isn't the same as bein' in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?"
They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.
But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn't speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him "the Seeker."
As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell Harry?
Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry's question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.
The Weasley twins' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.
They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.
Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back- his father's cloak- he felt that this time- the first time- he wanted to use it alone.
"What's going on with Potter's broom?!" Goyle finally piped up,
"I mean, after that open and revolting foul-"
"Fluffy!?"
Neville shook his head.
"Just looking," he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.
Hagrid wasn't listening, however, He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire.
"Sorry," She said. She pushed the cup of coffee towards Draco and then picked up a box of cereal.
Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.
"What's going on?"
"Crabbe," he said. "Midnight all right? We'll meet you in the trophy room; that's always unlocked."
Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn't think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell's footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he'd promised himself about not meddling.
A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence- the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside- stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears.
Harry placed the lid back on the box of spoons and put it to the side while Ron opened a box of Every Flavour Beans he'd gotten from Hermione.
Things couldn't have been worse.
His next present also contained sweets- a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.
Hi! Again, not much changes this chapter- I just made it flow better and cut out the unnecessary parts. also, let me know what you think of Parvati's name change!
"But I expect you've realized by now what it does?"
And speaking of Snape...
"It's not just my hand," he whispered, "although that feels like it's about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me- I've told her it was a dog, but I don't think she believes me... I shouldn't have hit him at the Quidditch match, that's why he's doing this."
They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn't hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them.
It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goalposts; he had half a mind to ask Wood to call a time-out, and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn't turn it. He couldn't direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him.
Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Philosopher's Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and colour coding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.
Snape's face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped and felt all of his confidence fly out of the window. He felt like he was back at Privet Drive.
The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they'd do with a Philosopher's Stone if they had one. It wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.
Malfoy didn't move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze.
He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons.
"No- he wouldn't," she said. "I know he's not very nice, but he wouldn't try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe."
"I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don't go back tonight."
She turned to the rest of the class.
Pansy let out a small gasp and stopped pouring, laughing embarrassedly as she put the cream jug back down onto the table.
Harry didn't sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn't think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they'd done?
This only left two parcels. One was a small, thin box and the other was a rather large package wrapped in brown paper.
Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely.
When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys' wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.
"Take him up to the hospital wing," Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.
Hope you enjoyed this chapter! I decided that Charlie would not pass up the opportunity to transport an illegal dragon and included him just a little bit! I didn't add much, but I can't wait to really get the tension going between some of the characters!
"Unless you'd like to tell us and save us the trouble?" Harry added. "We must've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him anywhere- just give us a hint- I know I've read his name somewhere."
And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them. Harry didn't have a clue what was going on.
"You're worth twelve of Malfoy," Harry said. "The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn't it? And where's Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin."
"-The one we've all been waiting for," said George.
"Right. It's time. Good luck, all of you."
"That's enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now."
"No!" shouted Hermione Granger. "Madam Hooch told us not to move- you'll get us all into trouble!"
All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn't exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes. It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.
"Yes-- thank you...uh- what was that...?"
Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared.
"-Bet you could," Ron muttered.
"Okay, men," he said.
"I've got the Snitch!" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion.
The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry's invisibility cloak. He had been down at Hagrid's hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.
"The floor?" Harry suggested. "I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads."
"Dumbledore?" he asked, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard.
The blond's eyes wandered to the Gryffindor table and he immediately spotted Potter, who was surrounded by his little friends; it looked like they were trying to feed him- Draco saw the Irish kid wave a bit of toast in his face while sporting a worried expression. He also noticed that Potter looked rather sick- kind of green.
Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.
"It's a Remembrall!" he explained. "Gran knows I forget things- this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red- oh..." His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, "You've forgotten something..."
"Are we allowed to speak yet?" asked Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.
When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.
Later that day Draco, Crabbe, Goyle and Pansy all left the Slytherin common room and headed towards the Quidditch pitch- It was about four-thirty but the autumn sun was already beginning to set. Once they arrived, Draco beckoned the other three to hide with him underneath the Slytherin stand- they all stayed low and kept out of sight as they watched the Gryffindors play.
"I'm disgusted," said Professor McGonagall. "Four students out of bed in one night! I've never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions- yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it's very dangerous- and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor."
“Then why—”
It was a voice he would have recognised anywhere, being one he’d heard almost daily for six years. Though at one point in his life it would have given Harry great pleasure to hear Malfoy being harassed, these days it seemed to only leave a sour taste in his mouth.
“That’s good, right? Three replies is better than none.” Ginny paused, taking in Harry’s sheepish expression. “Merlin, Harry. How many letters have you sent?”
“Sorry, enough of what?” Looking back and forth between the two of them, he felt himself frowning as his eyes widened. “Why would I get in the way of that?”
hair and the entirely
“Did you ever—”
“Draco…” Harry paused, his breath shaky as he shifted beside Draco. “Remember that first night?
“Just… Forget any of that ever happened, alright? I suppose I can owl you or something. How’s that?”
It was strange, really, how though he was absolutely certain he hadn't experienced half of what his brain was telling him had happened, it was so vivid and real to him. The memories weren't muddled or hazy at all; he could remember everything with absolute clarity. He just logically knew they were fake. His mind seemed tampered with, invaded. It felt like someone had gone in and messed with his memories, yet he didn't think anyone would either want to do that or be able to do it without him realising. He couldn't pinpoint the time that his recollection of the year spent at the Manor in fear had shifted in his mind's eye. The only thing he knew for certain was that he was completely uncertain about what had actually occurred.
There was a moment as their eyes met without malice or aggression for possibly the first time since they were eleven years old on this very street. It was almost nice, until it became horribly uncomfortable and Harry had to turn away, though not before noticing the red flush that had come over Malfoy’s cheeks.
“About bloody time,” Ron said with a grin.
Ignoring him, Harry lowered himself to where Teddy was bouncing around on the floor. “Can I see it then?”
Hearts eternally tangled
this chapter contains mentions of ginny/harry
Harry walked over quickly, ready to separate whatever was going on. “What’s the problem?”
He turned to glare at her grinning face. “I don’t like him.”
Harry knew from the tone of his voice that he wasn’t going to owl. He also knew that fighting was a pointless endeavour. Dejected, he nodded a second too late as he heard the distinct crack of apparation and Draco was gone.
Glaring unrepentantly, Draco shook his head slowly. “You mean like I did in the war?”

Draco remembered flashes that he knew were real. Obviously he wasn't going out of his way to recall those horrible long months filled with fear and tension. They just struck him when he was unsuspecting. A smell, sound, certain phrase that fell from the guard's mouths in their casual conversations through the halls; it didn't take a lot to suck the breath from his lungs and draw his mind into a dark place. The dreams hadn't stopped, not yet. He didn't truly think they ever would. Some things just shouldn't be experienced in a wizard's life and even if he had been allowed his wand in the cell, he was yet to find a spell to take the feeling away. He would wake drenched in his own sweat, twisted in the ragged sheets with the feeling of a trapped scream in his throat, begging to be let loose. Not knowing how to take it all away, how to make it all better. Sometimes he worried that his parents were facing the same problems that he was. That they got trapped inside their minds, with no idea of how to escape.
“I know,” he said with a quick nod. It was something he’d thought about an awful lot since he and Gin had split, and he knew that forcing Malfoy’s hand would never end well for anyone involved. In truth, he should have learned that lesson in school. “I’m not asking you to, Draco. I didn’t do this for you, believe it or not.” Smiling to himself, Harry thought of how much things had improved for him in the past few years. A better relationship with Ginny and his children, more time at home and with his loved ones. How the kids really didn’t seem to mind—maybe they didn’t quite understand yet, to be fair—as long as their mum and dad were always there. “I did it for me.”
The shrill shout came from the other side of the room and Harry took an abrupt step back from Malfoy, turning to give Teddy a sheepish grin.
Thoughts of him still all you know
She raised an eyebrow but chose to humour him. “Fine. Next time though, we’re getting you checked out at St Mungo’s again.”
He shook his head, then remembered the man couldn’t see him. “No, that’s all. I’ll come down to the door and get it when it’s ready.”
Seamus grinned, reaching across the counter to slap Harry on the shoulder. “Absolute legend, mate. Thanks, Miss Chelsea. Reckon you could grab me one of those Scrambler kits, then?”
Harry felt himself blinking rapidly a few times, the words not quite making sense. “But why would that ruin your marriage? Even if I was… er, similarly inclined, for it to ruin
fault that you’re really sexy when you finally own up to being an asshole and start talking about your feelings.”
There was a pause and he turned to look at Hermione fiddling with the glass in her hands. “You do love her right?”
Feeling slightly embarrassed but mostly relieved, Harry tried to ignore the flush he felt creeping over his cheeks as he looked down at them. The gloves were shaped like hedgehogs, with fluffy bristles on the back of his hands “Teddy got them for me, actually.”
“Walburga,” breathed Hermione. “Yes, it’ll cut through a sticking charm like it’s nothing!”
Harry snickered, thinking perhaps he hadn’t been too far off the money when he said there was something seriously wrong with Pansy after all.
Finally crossing the magical border surrounding The Burrow, Harry did a quick spin on his heels and felt the ever unwelcome feeling of being squished inside a space too small for his body before coughing as he felt himself reemerge on the front steps of Number 12.
Harry shook his head with a smile. “If you won’t tell me, it’s hardly fair…”
They were giving each other space right now. He chalked it up to Fred’s death and all the injuries her brothers had received, but deep down Harry didn’t even know if his heart was in it anymore. He wanted it to be. He wanted it so bad. There were so few times throughout his life that Harry had felt calm and at peace; when he had been with Ginny it seemed like maybe there was something worth fighting for on the other side. But now that he was faced with the reality of the win, well…
He tries to look unconcerned but thinks it comes out as more of a grimace. Either way he makes it work. “Me? I’m sure you sprinted out of the room.”
Now it seems as if it’s too late.
And then there is just the battle to talk about. Draco had wasted time coming up with excuses to Crabbe to stop them from fighting. In the end he’d decided to say they would hunt down Harry so they could claim the glory of bringing him to Voldemort. Draco had never actually expected to find him with Ron and Hermione. For some reason the idea that Harry would just be anywhere fighting in the castle like the rest of them hadn’t sunk in for Draco. Potter had been gone for so long, a distant idea, that having him reappear so suddenly had shocked him.
Draco raises an eyebrow as he settles on his bed. “You didn’t already know?”
“Sure.” Harry says but he’s not watching Blaise anymore. He’s too busy trying to covertly stare at Draco.
He can’t really understand that, given who his own parents are. He would give anything to not know all the wrongdoings of his family and what his mother and father had believed and done years ago. What they’ve done in Draco’s own lifetime, and dragged him into with them. Draco loves his parents and always will, but he will never again be able to think that they have always been good people.
“I mean it,” he whispers, eyes searching Harry’s for an answer Harry doesn’t know how to give. “You deserve all the love in the world.”
Blaise grins at him. “Like it, Potter? I tried to get as close to the original as I could.”
“Tell me what happened at Hogwarts. Why did you change your mind about us? Why did you run away just now?”
“Listen.” Malfoy said, voice low and earnest, making Harry blink in surprise as Malfoy rounded on him and leaned in close. “Just because for whatever reason you’ve decided I’m a pet project, or interesting all of a sudden or- or that I’m now worth your attention, doesn’t mean everybody else has. I don’t know what you’re playing at Potter, I really don’t. I can’t figure it out, which frustrates me to no end. For the record, I don’t know what I’m doing either, or what in Merlin’s name we’re attempting by sitting together in class and studying in the library and laughing and-” He had paused, took a deep breath.
"Breaking up with you?" Draco sneers viciously, pressing on. Forcing himself to keep speaking. "Potter, we were never together. I don't know how else to tell you- it wasn't real. It was for my image, nothing more, nothing less. You were most helpful, and I'm thankful for that, but-"
Draco swallows. “Yeah.”
“Wh- mate?” Ron asks Harry looking betrayed.
Draco sits down beside Ron in the newly vacated chair. “I thought you were leaving with Harry?”
Luckily they reach the two Aurors the next second, which means they’re that much closer to getting home. It’s a man and a woman and Harry doesn’t recognize either of them. The woman is short, blonde and wears light blue robes, which isn’t a typical Auror uniform.
