“Albus, that is quite enough,” Draco reprimanded. “You may shape up and apologise to your cousin, or Scorpius can return home with me this evening.”
He wrote out. He realised the truth of the words like thunderclap. He was so fucking relieved Draco was there; that their home was where he’d gone to be safe. The thought of Draco leaving it, leaving him, made him dizzy with an untenable hurt. He kept writing.
“Hm,” Scorpius assented, leaning in to get a better look at the spine of the books the two older students had stacked in front of them. He read:
“I don’t want the publicity, not really,” Harry agrees, “It is something I’ve thought about, but I also know—Merlin, I sound so cynical—but it gives me a platform, doesn’t it? I’m a figurehead whether I want to be or not. So I thought maybe I could use it to keep speaking out, reminding people what we’ve lost and what we stand to gain.”
“Pansy and I have been through the post you picked up from Hogsmeade last time,” Hermione told Harry that evening, handing him a slim stack of letters, “I think these are the ones you might want to see.”
“It’s just that Mr. Weasley had these Homunculi Humbugs, little striped creatures that stomped across the counter and grumbled as you ate them. It sounds awful now, but it really was terribly funny. They tasted of peppermint.”
“We need to get them help, they were all unconscious from the smoke, but I think they’re all breathing.”
“There’s not much in the way of leftovers,” Harry commented, guiltily. “I think the kids were too excited to be eating decent food for once.”
Ron took a thoughtful sip. “Yeah,” he said, finally. “I think he is. Him and Fred...he’ll never have that again. He’s a bit hollowed out, you know? It’s not just grief, it’s anger, and there’s nothing for it, nothing but patience, maybe, and time. I’m sorry, mate. I’d tried to convince him if I thought it would help.”
“Yes, James,” Harry retorted, knowing he shouldn’t, “because it makes so much sense to buy you a brand new History of Magic textbook when the edition hasn’t changed since I was at school. But, if you’d rather have that than new Quidditch gear, then by all means…”
“Our Lavender always spoke so highly of you, Harry, love,” a pale, round-faced woman was saying. Oh Merlin, Harry wasn’t sure he could do this, “I still remember that letter she wrote home from school, telling us she’d been sorted into the same house as
“It would be, yes,” Professor Malfoy agreed, bringing out a sheet of labels and a pot of ink. “But it is more potent freshly ground. Too much uniformity detracts from the character of many potions, I find. That is why I prefer to brew many myself, instead of purchasing them. As for the hooves, the seventh-years will be using it tomorrow for their Poultices of Invulnerability.”
Clark gaped at the shimmering stag. “Wicked,” he breathed, too stunned to ask about the remedial potions bit, “What
“There’s a bit of an ornery portrait in the hall,” Harry warned them, “it’s best to keep quiet until we get to the kitchen. Oh, and Clark, you might see Kreacher, he’s a  house-elf. Er...try not to stare.”
“What were you two up to out in the garden, then?” Harry interrupted, trying to puzzle out this confounding conversation. Remy started fussing from his bassinet nearby, and Harry scooped him up, bouncing him on his hip while he hovered near the dinner table.
“Hullo, Harry!” The large bloke called out, reaching out to shake Harry’s hand, “Fitz Hops, such a pleasure, really.” He was so affable that Harry felt himself smiling at once, returning the greeting.
He wouldn’t though, not with the way Jamie had been sticking by his side in a way he hadn’t done even in childhood. Ever since their talk, there was a nervous edge to his son, as though Harry would flee if Jamie let him out of his sight for too long. The behaviour was so unlike the cocksure, fearless boy Harry had sent off to Hogwarts only a year prior. Harry would eat and breathe memories if it meant unearthing Jamie’s past brash brilliance, if only in part.
“I dunno,” Clark mumbled, “It was just some lady, posh accent, would not shut up, but mostly just said the same things over and over, like instructions. 'Fetch the sheet, boy, fetch the sheet,' stuff like that, she didn't seem to know my name. ”
Silently, Scorpius cursed dratted Francine Mulligan and her sneaky, snitchy ways. She was every bit as much as a tattler as Rose Weasley, but at least Weasley was obvious about it.
“No, I definitely think so. I mean, I want to. Take you out. If you’d like that, too.” Harry berated himself inwardly for the inelegant string of words.
This response did nothing to soothe Scorpius’ worries, from the furrow of the boy’s brow. “What were you arguing about?”
Draco appeared behind Jared and put a hand on his shoulder and squeezed warmly. “A clever ploy. Very Slytherin.”
“She’s not a drinker,” Clark mumbles. “Not usually. But when she does, she overdoes it. And then she sleeps the whole day through and is too tired or sick to take her meds and too miserable with herself to do anything else and everything falls apart again.”
“I’m afraid I’ve not time to chat, unfortunately,” Scorpius decided, making a show of checking his watch. “I’m expected elsewhere.”
“Well?” Januarius prompted. “Shove over, Jamie, and you two can fill me in on whatever you’re plotting.”
is where you want to be seen. And Tennyson always takes good care of my clients. We need to influence the opinions of those who, in turn, will influence their peers.”
Hands still clasping his elbows, Draco did as he was bid, shuffling ungracefully backwards until his feet were tucked under the bed, his back and head pressed against it. Usually, Draco prided himself in the lithe efficacy of his body’s movements, and being robbed of that left him clumsy and debased and painfully hard. He felt his contained erection lurch impotently in his pants.
Ron adopted an unconvincing expression of nonchalance. Hermione gave him a curious look, but didn’t press the issue.
Now, though, it was just past midnight and the dormitory would be asleep. Al doubted very much that Scorpius would have ventured out on his own, just as he knew Fife wouldn’t break the Slytherin code and rat Al out for being out past curfew, no matter how much he itched to. Surely Fife and the others would be asleep now, though. The Ojo twins slept through anything, having expended so much energy in endless horseplay during the day, and Fife and Bingham weren’t night owls, either. It was time to end his cowardice, Al decided.
He shrugged as if to change the subject but Pansy stopped him. “But you left Scorpius with him anyway?”
Harry went to protest but the adrenaline was slipping away and he became achingly aware of the rough, charred lining of his trachea, the burning rub of his lungs, how he was struggling to fill them. In his haste, he’d not cast the bubble head charm for himself soon enough and the smoke had done its damage. He transferred the child into’s Draco’s arms and then Ron was at his elbow, supporting him.
“Oh, chin up, Clark,” Harry chided, “presentation isn’t everything.” Harry’s own ragtag team was trickling in, mostly by foot, mismatched cloaks and looking—save for Fitz Hops, who was relentlessly cheerful—appropriately intimidated. “Alright, you lot, circle up. Hear you’ve got a team name! Excellent, any of you artists? Want to sketch something up and I’ll get some badges made?”
Eighth year potions that morning had been cancelled—the last thing students needed, it was decided, was to have any sort of telepathy, no matter how finite. Instead they were slated for double DADA.
Draco turned slowly, fixing cold, despising eyes on her. “Look around you, Jones. You may have been on the right side of the war, but where are you now? Have you got any friends left, I wonder? Besides that Pushbottom beast over at
“No, Harry, I’m sorry,” came the muted response. Draco’s eyes were downcast, his cheeks flushed with pink streaks of exertion and shame. He was glorious.
A silvery jingle sounded in the air above them. Harry glared at Draco, who by all appearances was unaffected, and adjusted himself.
He bent close against his broom, dipping below the bludgers that shot along like high speed bumper cars, trying to conceptualise their rhythm. They seemed to slow down until they hit the wall which imbued them with a new energy. The trend was for them to angle downwards, not upwards.
“Not officially, I don’t think,” Scorpius noted, extending his hand. He’d heard the gossip, though. There weren’t that many out trans students at the school, and the rumours that first week had been flying. “Nice to meet you.”
“Right.” Harry studied the healer—Zerk—again. He was also in jeans with some dark trainers that were sleek, and soft and fitted. He was compact, probably Draco’s height, but more muscular, and he had one ankle propped up on his knee. “Are you a mind healer?” Harry asked.
His bed felt overly soft compared to his weeks on a bedroll, but nevertheless, sleep took him easily.
The server reappeared. He was in his mid-twenties, perhaps, more of Draco’s body type than Harry’s, lean and lithe with neatly styled short hair and an oiled mustache that turned up at the corners.
Thankfully, his faint praise was taken at face value and was not too deeply examined by the would-be thespians. Grinning, Rose and Lily offered an encore of one of the little rhymes from the same book, but at last it was time for bed.
“Me?” Harry asked, flustered, “Oh, I’m well enough. Just…” He trailed off, looking into her eyes which were shaded by her hood. Her wide pupils made it difficult to read her expression. She wasn’t smiling, but her head was tilted to the side, listening. “How do you change someone?” He burst out, surprising himself.
“Well, that’s crap,” Ginny announced, “that’s not the point of the DA at all! If they’re not going to use their powers for the common good then maybe we should just disband entirely? We only kept it running because so many students still were keen on the practical aspect of it.”
“Mr. Malfoy, this simply cannot continue,” she chided, an efficient spell transplanting Malfoy from Harry’s side to the crisp sheets of an infirmary bed, “you’ll need to name names, eventually. You’re not being a hero, you know.”
Harry shuddered, the bitter dread of a month prior stirring in his chest. “You weren’t there, you didn’t see him, the smoke, his lifeless fucking body. Merlin, Draco, I thought he was dead, he very nearly was.”
Malfoy snorted, “Greg, in advanced potions? Can you imagine? No, I’ve sent him off to muggle studies, hope he can somehow get through.”
That earned him an especially jarring thwack and Draco gritted his teeth at the flash of pain, which was followed by a rapid onslaught of Harry’s palm. He gripped the covers tightly, bracing himself, his cock swinging humiliatingly, full and neglected.
“Yes,” Draco admitted unhappily. He was doing his best to stand still, to not press forward and seek release, Harry could tell.
“Yes, Matron,” they answered and she smiled tightly in return, then strode off in the direction of her office. Harry perched on the edge of an empty bed while Malfoy dressed. He kept his eyes diverted but they were drawn back to the other boy when he heard a quiet, pained gasp. Malfoy had one sock in his hand and his injured knee half pulled up in an effort to put it on. He was biting his lip and his eyes looked to be watering.
“It’s bollocks,” he muttered, feeling like he was whinging, but also it really, really was bollocks. He was so very tired of it all.
Draco had wondered if Pansy would be proven right: that Potter would fumble and apologise his way through the encounter, but any such impulse seemed to have fled the moment Potter had felt the tawse in his hand. It had been exciting, Draco had to admit, to be strung up like that. Typically, Draco refused to be restrained. He savoured the feeling of having to bear it, of
Hey all. Just wanted to say thanks so so so much to everyone who commented on the last chapter. I've been feeling a bit anxious because I truly wasn't expecting this story to have such heavy OC involvement. I've always avoided major OCs in fan work and I worry about alienating people. So thanks to those who left encouraging comments, I'm relieved you've not all unfollowed in frustration!!!  I suspect it will not be quite this Clark-centric for too much longer, so hopefully if people are less than thrilled, they can look forward to that. Otherwise, I understand and thanks for sticking it out this far!!
“It’s nothing,” the boy said finally. “Or, it’s not one thing. There was no traumatic event or anything, nothing you have to worry about.”
Like, don't quote me on this, but I think this story is getting close to done (still probably 5-10 more chapters because I am nothing if not verbose, but still!). I have very few plot points left I want to hit. Feels very surreal. I don't know what I will do with myself! (That is a lie, I will probably start on the stories I have been dying to work on but haven't let myself because then I might not finish this one.)
“I always go with you to breakfast,” Draco reminded him, pulling Harry’s trousers up and fastening the flies before guiding Harry’s heavy arms through the openings in his shirt.
“Yes, of course, Headmistress,” Malfoy replied, and Harry could hear an edge of surprised pride in his voice, as if he’d forgotten what praise felt like.
“Well, that’s a relief. I hate to see a child suffer. Remy was a bit fussy, but I think he’s gone down for the night. Lily was her usual self, full of vim and vigor! Never a dull moment with that girl!”
Professor McGonagall’s mouth thinned and she gave him a thoughtful nod. “I see. Well, let us not panic preemptively. Run and check with Professor Flitwick and let me know what you find out. I assume you’ve checked your map?”
“Well, now you do,” Malfoy replied, coldly. Harry placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder, gave it a squeeze.
“If anyone would let me within fifty miles of St. Mungo’s, I think I’d enjoy healing. Every patient is a puzzle that you get to sort out. I’ve always been quite quick with puzzles. Sparing that, perhaps I could at least work in medicinal potions. More likely though, I’ll end up in industry, brewing and bottling in a back room somewhere, where my name can’t poison anyone’s good reputation.”
“I learnt to cook from that book,” Draco elaborated. “I’ve committed half the recipes to memory by now, I’m sure.”
Dudley held up both palms. “I had no idea she was going to say that. I understand that you’re angry and you’ve every right to be. She means well, but that stuff is Harry’s to carry, and mine—”
“Don’t worry!” Al demanded. “I kept a journal. I'd write down the memory before I snipped it, mostly just to see if it worked, but that's the thing: It did! I could read the memory I'd written down afterwards, and I couldn't picture whatever scene I'd jotted down beyond the words on the page. And I think it's helping me. I’m not all crabby like Jamie, and I don’t cry all the time like Lily used to. And I was teaching it to Scorpius, so he could do the same thing, skipping ahead on his prophecies until they were over. Only he’d never had to do it in public before today, so I think he panicked. It’s good magic, though, Dad, I promise. I have the theory written out, I can show you. I was really careful.”
Harry chuckled, "I swear, sometimes it is like there are two of you, you bossy, submissive little prat. Shit, sorry, oh bugger."
Jamie gave a look that said he thought Harry was pretty damn naïve.  The child appeared tired, and Harry didn’t like the shadow of sadness that seemed to cling in the air around his eldest son. “You sound like Fort,” Jamie said, with a fond shake of his head. “She has no patience for people who can’t learn to get along. Like her parents.”
“Professor Haberdash-Pewter has been reaching out to her northern contacts. Cwalu are rare and poorly understood. The most applied strategy has always just been aversion: entire woods have been relinquished to such unfriendly spirits. Her current theory is that the high emotionality of a so-transformed witch or wizard gives them an ill-defined presentation, which in turn is why reliable information is so scant. Add in the werewolf element, and we are dealing with an entirely unknown creature.”
The girls, maybe fourth years, Harry guessed, and judging by their scarves, two Ravenclaws and a Hufflepuff, giggled, “No,” responded the Hufflepuff, “we...we just wanted to say hello.”
Harry was surprised that Draco stepped in, but he was not nearly as astonished as Ron appeared to be. Ron’s face was frozen in shock, mouth open around a bit of half-chewed beef. Harry couldn’t quite discern if the reaction was because Draco stood up for Rose, or because he’d scolded Al and Harry had let him. But as far as Harry could tell, Al deserved it, and, amazingly, even looked remorseful about disappointing a teacher Harry knew he respected. It was a much more earnest reaction than anything Harry could hope to elicit had he taken a similar tone.
“She’s very lively and game for adventure,” Draco agreed. “Children are drawn to that. I don’t have a doubt she will usurp or at least join forces with this Anthea.”
“It’s not impossible,” Harry agreed, looking unhappy. “I can ask Andromeda for her view on things. She mentioned they’ve been corresponding these last few years, attempting to make amends.” It had always felt strange to Scorpius when he was reminded that the Potters were all but family with the great aunt he had never even met.
“It’s not,” Draco spat. Harry’s eyes opened wide and Draco cursed himself inwardly. Now he’d gone and rattled the man, which was hardly his intention. He took a breath and pressed the scar to his lips reverently. He extinguished his wand, and settled back into bed. Harry came willingly when Draco pulled him in, his cheek to Draco’s chest, his head tucked beneath his chin.
“Shove off, Fife,” Al demanded coolly. Fife’s nonsense never bothered him or the Ojo twins, but he knew it laid Bingham low. “You don’t need to be an arsehole about it. Go on, Corin, I’m listening.”
“I know,” Harry agreed. "Andromeda’s frail, but she is still plenty sharp. I wouldn’t say she’s even entirely put aside her suspicions, but I guess folks get to that stage of life, you know? Looking back and wondering what they could have done differently?”
It was late and Harry was quite drunk. Hermione had just hauled Ron off to bed, kissing Harry’s cheek and wishing him a good night as they went. Most others seemed to have kipped it as well, Harry hadn’t noticed exactly when. He was that sort of drunk where time skipped ahead without his noticing. He was staring out the window. Outside, some builders were still working into the night, bright lights illuminating the damaged ramparts of the central tower. It felt good to watch something be made whole.
Potter didn’t quite choke on his tea, but it was a near thing. “Er,” he said, risking a glance at Draco, who held his expression neutral and unwavering. “I don’t know, Al, we’ve a lot to do around the house.”
Before Harry could respond, Metatron arrived with a thin package of letters, already vetted by Raulo, the Latvian hexbreaker. Draco slipped a substantial role of parchment into his pocket without looking at it. Harry had a suspicion as to who that was from, but if Draco didn’t want to talk about it, he didn’t want to talk about it, and Harry wasn’t about to force the issue.
Draco didn’t push the boy to talk, instead he just reached out and gave James’ shoulder a gentle squeeze.
Harry didn’t know. He gripped his fork much tighter than necessary, looking down at his plate. The bacon he'd been previously been enjoying now looked slimy and unappetising. He felt the back of his neck grow hot and was overcome with the uneasy sensation that every whisper in the breakfast hall was once again about him. “I’m fine,” he said tersely, “and I’d rather not talk about it, if it’s all the same to you.”
“We have victory!” cried out Luna, face flushed pink and eyes dancing, “Draco Malfoy sacrificing himself for glory!”
Harry was about to offer some sympathy, but Draco’s scowl made it clear that that would not be appreciated, so instead he busied himself with shrinking Clark’s trunk down to save them from having to lug it up three flights of stairs.
do, Malfoy!” Harry seethed, “I know moral principles are just vague guidelines for you, but they're not like that for me. I can't rifle through people's minds simply for practice!”
“Coldwell, Grimwood, with me!” Owens shouted, as though he were on a battlefield, and not having a go at a simple Defence exercise. In a tunnel somewhere, Scorpius knew Al would be rolling his eyes.
She scanned the room with her dilated eyes. “I hope I haven’t interfered with any freshly healed scars, I just wanted to acknowledge and recognise your plight. This year will of course involve all necessary preparations for your N.E.W.T.s:
“Are you going to read with me and Auntie Hermione, Professor?” Lily demanded from the doorway to the kitchen. Draco was icing his head and flicking his wand to aid in the clean up, with Al experimentally emulating the spells and Scorpius offering helpful corrections to his friend’s wandwork. Al seemed to take them in stride, eager only to perfect the task, and not at all defensive like his elder brother could be.
Draco didn’t know if he was upset. He didn’t know what he was. “It wasn’t supposed to be like that,” he ground out, still smothering himself in Harry’s chest.
“We were never not together,” Harry said, puzzled. Then the realisation dawned on him: Clark’s readied defenses, his uncertainty and concern. He reached out and squeezed Clark’s shoulder. “Oh, love, were you worried about that?”
“Yes, Professor,” Al acknowledged, sounding genuinely guilty. “Sorry.” No one liked to upset Professor Longbottom. He always sounded so dejected when he was forced to reprimand someone.
Harry wasn’t sure what bothered him more: that Al had been needling his brother, or that he’d been doing it and getting away with it.
His mum held up an apologetic palm. “You’re right, of course. Outdated thinking, no doubt. Not everyone fancies the bronzed look. I’m terribly sorry, Clark, love.”
“Is Pansy alright?” Harry asked as they sat down over tea in the common room a little while later, “I mean, I’m obviously not asking you to share her private business—”
Once inside the master bedroom, Draco made quick work of stripping off the large T-shirt without turning to face Harry. He heard the other man’s breath catch and Draco liked that. He liked it even more when Harry came up behind him, firm fingers finding Draco’s hip bones, and the keen edge of his teeth digging into the ropey muscle where Draco’s shoulder met his neck.
Harry had laughed affectionately, but then admitted, "I thought she was kind of sweet. Well meaning, and I really did never think much of what it is like for siblings at home. It filled my aunt with such rancor, I think it's tainted her whole life. She treated magic like it was, not a disease as much as a moral failing, a corruption she wanted to yank out by the roots."
“Well,” Ron said, sounding a bit guilty, “I think we were all a bit surprised, so there were a few of us…”
Harry's mouth opened and closed for a moment like a stunned guppy. He rather liked that Malfoy was planning to spend the holidays thinking of him. Of course he wanted to be with Draco, but...not at the Manor. He wasn't sure he'd ever be able to face the Manor. He scrunched his nose.
“I know, darling, I do,” Draco's tone was kind and direct. “But eat first, please. You need a clear head about you.”
“You saw me loads over the break,” Draco reminded him, lazily scrubbing some citrusy smelling shampoo into Harry’s hair. Harry didn’t recognise it. He suspected replacement might be the fate of most of his stock toiletries, but he found didn’t mind. “More than either of us was expecting.”
Draco sank forward, pressing his forehead towards Harry’s thigh. He half expected Harry to disallow it, to wrench his head up and force him to confront his action, but that didn’t happen. Instead, Harry’s fingers were surprisingly gentle as they found Draco’s hair and began stroking his scalp with tender little movements.
“You guess? Which part of this statement has room for guesswork? You guess it is a house? Or you guess that it belongs to you?”
Harry shook his head, “I wish I knew, maybe she did just forget the dates, she does come across as a bit scattered. My guess is she is having an episode of sorts, but I don’t know enough about it. If we can’t reach her tomorrow, we’ll have to call social services, they should at least look into the welfare of his brother. But what if then Clark has to spend Christmas in some sort of muggle foster situation? Merlin, it would be better for him to just go back to school than that.”
“The way you fuss,” Malfoy said, shaking his head, “honestly. I’m fine. See? Had my wand,” he waved it to demonstrate his point, “would have easily taken a few of those little bastards down.”
“I’m going to talk to her,” he growled, tearing off a piece of toast with his incisors, “as soon as I finish.”
Claire set her jaw and yanked a couple of girls—the ones Harry’d seen in Scrivenshaft’s in the autumn, and trailing Claire ever since—forward. Another trio of students followed them.
“I can throw them off, anyway,” Harry growled, agitation growing, “If I could resist Voldemort’s, you best believe I could resist Draco’s. Not that he would.”
“Simply a well-wisher,” Draco said in that same tone. Harry recognised the lie, along with the subtext:
Before the lecture could continue, the lunch hour burst upon them. Students flooded the great hall, Slytherins accompanied by DA members of various houses, expressions running the gamut from proud to harangued.
“I just think it’s a bit amusing. All I ever wanted was to be extraordinary. I worked myself to the bone just to earn a professorship and a scant slice of academic renown. And then here
“Exactly!” Albus nodded emphatically. “Would it be easier if you just tried it yourself? We could show you how."
“Oh, I think you can afford to skip the formalities, I think, Harry,” he looked like he was about to say more, but then, noticing the eyes on them, motioned Harry towards Ms. Provincel’s office. Kingsley knocked briskly once, and then they entered.
?” Fife demanded, with an irritatingly practiced accent. He sounded jealous. Al suddenly very much wanted that to have been the carnival Scorpius had attended.
Finally, he put his hands on Harry’s chest, pushing him back slightly, “We’ve got to stop,” he said, “before we get into it all over again. You need more sleep and so do I. You go back first, I follow in a bit.’
“Alright, you lot, listen carefully. We don’t want to get trapped on the stairs,” Harry announced. “Arrange yourself into groups of five or six. I’ll take the first group first, and as they tire, we’ll send for fresh groups. Harry caught sight of Claire. “Gibbens, you’re group is with me, let’s go.”
“Potter’s honour means a lot to him, and it extends a lot of protection to you. Firstly, he would never share, with me, nor with anyone, what he experiences inside your head. And he’s certainly not laughing at you. Neither Potter nor I had particularly sunny childhoods, we’re not looking on you suffering through this with anything but respect for your willingness to be here, and compassion for your hardships.”
He looked towards Dean and Seamus who were now joined by Ron and Hermione. They were turning the unconscious body over. A small, chubby Asian girl in a Slytherin tie.
“Malfoy,” Fife sniffed, flipping his dark braid over his shoulder. “Rumour has it you were out sick. I presume you’re not contagious?”
“Fine,” Harry relented, “it’s not. Or Merlin, it might be. I don’t know. Because I don’t know what’s the truth and what’s a lie. And I’m scared that the truth is I’ve been a bit had, that he’s tricked me somehow. Makes me feel like a damn mug.”
Harry looked down the length of the eighth year table and realised that the house groupings among the older students had started to disperse. Daphne Greengrass and Padma Patil looked to be reviewing some astrology charts over their eggs. Justin Finch-Fletcley and Hermione were reminiscing about childhood cartoons. Ron had joined in the conversation with Malfoy and Goyle. And Malfoy’s leg was still firmly planted alongside Harry’s, giving him a confusing rush of anticipation.
of this before. His stomach flipped in horror as he realised what had happened. He’d forgotten. He was supposed to have gone to his father’s office to get his potion, but he’d fallen asleep and now, Merlin, any minute now—
“There is no dealing with that blasted portrait,” Harry explained, “We’ve tried every possible spell. It’s immune to fire, to ice, to sharp objects.”
Clark made a frustrated sound and propped his elbows up on the table, one hand going to his temple. Draco bit back a comment on manners; he had a pretty good idea of Clark’s opinion on what he called ‘respectability politics’ at this point.
The title for the fic is from Anchor, by AG & Lindsay Ray, which really feels like a theme song for the first story in this series.
Draco snorted. “Oh, yes, how boorish of me to comment on something you'll demand admiration for in as little as three minutes.”
“I—” Potter leapt to his feet, then forced himself to sit down again, his fingers curling and uncurling over the denim of his jeans. Jeans that fit poorly. Draco wondered if Potter would notice if someone were to spell them just a shade more snug, subtly, of course. Potter groaned and raised a hand to knead his forehead. “I’d hoped they’d stopped asking,” he muttered.
“She wouldn’t mind my discussing it,” he assured them, “It has, yes, and Mother’s reverted her surname to Black. Were you at school with her?” he asked the Weasleys.
Harry didn’t know what he had been expecting. A lecture, perhaps, or at the very least frustration at his stupidity. Instead, Hermione met him with only understanding, even though he’d tried to keep secrets from her, and had only just separated from Hermione’s very dear friend.
“Granger,” Draco stated when Harry pulled back. Harry spun around to see Hermione, Remy balanced on her hip. He didn’t know what expression he expected to find on his friend’s face. She knew, of course, but knowing and
Draco and Clark and Mum appeared beside them, then, and while Not-Gran went over to greet them—hugging Draco and Clark, and shaking Mum’s hand—Jared hid his face in Harry’s neck.
Draco was rather enjoying herding Potter and his lot around the shops. This realisation dawned on him just as they were leaving Quality Quidditch Supplies, Potter sliding a paper bag containing Jamie’s new kit onto the bottom rack of the pram (he really was the most indulgent father).
Harry crossed his arms and turned away, but to his surprise, Draco placed a hand on his forearm and leaned to to ghost his lips across Harry’s cheekbone. He nudged his forehead against Harry’s temple for a suspended moment, whispering an apology, and Harry felt the tension coiling within him begin to give. He let Draco take his hand, but he wouldn’t look at him.
“If you like,” Draco shrugged, sounding utterly unbothered. He took the mug from Jared’s hands and placed it on his bedside table. Jared cuddled closer into Draco’s chest with a huff. “I might read for a bit.” Draco announced, reaching for his wand and one of his large medical tomes. He cast
Harry wished he didn’t have the same question nagging at him. “He’s keeping himself safe,” he said curtly, “from those who are too quick to jump to my defense based on shoddy evidence and without awaiting my request.”
“I don’t think you’ve anything to worry about on that front,” Harry assured him. Instead of arguing, Father simply let out a long, slow breath and, closing his eyes, tilted his head back, so it was resting against Harry’s ribs in a shockingly intimate gesture. Scorpius had never seen him so physically comfortable with anyone, not even his Aunt Pansy. He couldn’t make sense of it and he couldn’t look away.
“Let me guess, Potter,” Draco said, shaking his head, but giving Harry a soft smile, “another stray for your collection?”
While perhaps a few years older than Draco, Rudá’s lifestyle made him a pleasure to watch and to touch. The man never seemed to wear a shirt, opting for well-worn linen shorts, or, on particularly hot days, a flowing turquoise garment which covered very little. He was not tall, but he was well built, muscles shaped by long years of navigating the landscape. Much of his skin was decorated with starkly lined tattoos, and more often than not, he had a lip full of tobacco.  No matter the weather, he wore the same grubby trainers, hopping over stones and making a show of always having to wait for Draco to catch up. Draco found he didn’t mind the teasing, and they spent evenings under the stars, Rudá telling him the legends of his people, a small enclave of witches and wizards who’d magicked their homeland invisible with the coming of the Portuguese.
Harry knew when he was being tested. He lunged at Draco, trapping him midway down the bed. One of his arms was caught at an uncomfortable angle beneath his torso, and Harry held the other one in a grip tight enough to leave marks. He had one knee beside Draco’s thigh, the other planted on his abdomen.
Harry took a sip from the glass Ginny handed him. Tasted a bit like perfume to him, but Draco seemed genuine in his praise. Maybe the other boy just had a more refined palate.
“No!” Clark growled. “Jesus, no, nothing like that. I just...I get stressed, I guess. That’s when it happens.”
Harry had been embarrassed to identify these responses in himself when he’d left Hogwarts. He’d expected the nightmares of Voldemort, the grief of losing so many friends and mentors. Those emotions were clearcut, and easily divulged to Ginny or Ron or Hermione or anyone, really. It was a shared sort of trauma, and understandable. It was the activities of daily living that had unwittingly unnerved him. He’d spent his first year out of Voldemort’s shadow ostensibly living at Grimmauld Place, but actually staying more nights than not at The Burrow. Being alone had never appealed to him.
“Come on, Scor!” Al urged, embracing the thrumming enthusiasm all around him. “I’m going to hit up Dad for some pocket money!”
She looked to the window, her translucent form reflecting sunlight like the surface of a lake. “Leave me now, Harry Potter. I must think on such things.”

Draco stood, wiping off the knees of his dark trousers and turning to fix Harry with a triumphant look.
“Good,” Hermione remarked, approvingly. She always did like to teach. “Well. That was quite the story, Harry. Never thought I’d see you willingly seeking out Draco Malfoy’s company, Merlin.”
Ignoring that particular ethical dilemma, at least temporarily, Clark excitedly pulled a dog-eared flyer out of his trunk. “Well, I’ve looked them over, but I really want your input, Harry. You went through trials. What are most people riding these days? What's all show and what's actually decent?”
“I wet the goddamn bed, Jesus!” Clark cursed, crossing his skinny arms over his equally skinny chest and looking, if possible, even more miserable. “And I said I didn’t want to talk about it.”
“Perfect. Well, Mr. Potter, welcome to our Trial Day! We are very honoured to have you. Head on it, you can put your change of clothes in the locker room to the right." She extended a hand to the gates behind her. Harry took a deep breath, and proceeded.
Draco only stretched back his graceful neck to look up at him. “Thank you, darling,” he said, his voice conversational and at a normal speaking volume, “Why don’t you peruse the wine list.” The only hint that he had heard was the wicked little half-smile that tinged his lips.
“Mother?” Father said in response to Harry’s question, and Scorpius jumped back to attention. “Merlin, I don’t know. I don’t know her at all any more, do I? It’s been 20 years.”
“I know he does,” Harry agreed. “I can tell how much he admires you. He’s shared a lot with you, and you get on so well.”
“But he had such a, oh, I don't know, a look. A charisma, a way about him,” Harry tried, inarticulate and helpless.
“Shit,” said Clark, “Jesus, I really keep putting my foot in it today. I’m sorry, Harry, I should have thought.”
“Get undressed then,” Harry suggested, and Draco felt the edge of panic he’d been riding dull a little. This he knew. This was familiar.
“Merlin, if there is any justice in the world…” Ron uttered darkly, glaring at Jones who was still down on the field, surrounded by her chartreuse-robed Pygmy Puffs and enaging in some sort of a rhyming, energetic chant.
“You’ll know,” she assured him, “do the same to the rest of the distal phalanges and then the middle, proximal, and the metacarpals.” She illustrated the areas she was referencing, pointing to Draco’s fingers with her wand, just past the junction of each joint and into his hand, “You’ll have to leave the wrist to me, too many little bones, and difficult  to visualise if you don’t know the anatomy, but let me know when you’re done and you can do the long bones of his arm.”
, not even quidditch stars or music icons. I think it is very possible that if we expose Draco as Harry’s boyfriend too early, it could get ugly, violent even, and that is what I am trying to prevent. I don’t think it’s out of the realm of possibility that attempts could be made on Draco's life.”
“Why can’t you?” Harry asked as Draco knelt, directing Harry’s foot to the leg hole of his pants like he was a child. “You’re doing it now.”
“Oh, yes, of course!” Her wide blue eyes slipped from the cot, back to Harry’s face, and then over to Draco, who was standing to Harry’s right, examining cot bumpers and bedding. For a terrible moment, Harry thought they were being absurdly blatant, but then her focus returned to Harry, without any trace of shock or suspicion. Harry tried to convince his jittering heart that he was being silly: There was nothing odd about a couple of mates running errands together. “Once you’ve gathered all your purchases, just pop on over to the counter and I’ll ring them up for you. I’ll make note of the cot as well, so you don’t have to lug it about.”
Harry levitated the three boys closest to him, save for Clark, and Professor Haberdash-Pewter muttered a spell in a language Harry couldn't place. The bobbing bodies started a macabre exodus through the door, heads lolling at awkward angles as they floated lifelessly through the doorway. Harry slid an arm under Clark’s knees and shoulders, picking him up. He knew he should just levitate him like the rest, but he needed to feel the warmth of the boy’s body, and hear the rasps of his breath to know he was still with him.
Harry hadn’t even prepared for bed yet. He still needed to brush his teeth and change. He wasn’t sure he had the strength.
The serious Ravenclaw had her sheet of shining black hair tied in a neat topknot. She nodded and gave Harry a shy, pleased smile. Claire blushed miserably and pursed her lips, looking away.
Thanks ever so much for the kudos and comments on the last chapter. Please believe me when I say I live for that shit.
“You have been good, sweetheart, so good. I’m so proud of you. All I want is this last thing. Just once. Show me your dedication, show me you mean it, show me now, Draco.” He waited for Draco's words, the ones that would change his actions, but they didn't come and Harry didn't expect they would. He grinned against the shoulder of his stubborn Skytherin. Merlin, he loved him. And then, Harry’s orgasm slammed into him and he emptied brutally into Draco’s arse.
Just then, Harry stirred, shifting closer, a sturdy arm encircling Draco from behind and pulling him close.
“I didn’t want him to. You never tell me what it was like, Dad. I know you were there and everyone says you were this big deal, that you ended the whole war. I’ve even read about it, but it doesn’t seem real, because you always brush me off, like it wasn’t this whole thing. But it was, and I want to know about it.”
“Hips aren’t what they used to be!” she laughed, but Harry could only offer a shaky smile in return, as he tried not to wince. He hated to acknowledge her mortality. She’d become markedly more frail in the months since Arthur had passed. Harry could hardly blame her, it had not been an easy time for any of them. It had all been so sudden: Arthur's heart had given out one day while faffing about in the garage, and Molly had found him there hours later when she’d gone to fetch him for dinner.
But Malfoy had provoked him, Harry tried to tell himself. He had a right to protect Albus, to overpower Malfoy. Then why did it feel like a failure to enact violence upon the man, like it somehow meant that Malfoy had won? Harry groaned miserably, pacing the tiled floor between the cupboards. A muted creak sounded in the hallway and Harry spun to look, but there was no one there. Had he reset the wards? It didn’t matter. Malfoy may be an arsehole, but he wasn’t stupid. He’d not just show up at Harry’s house in the middle of the night, and the wards would have sounded if it were anyone else.
“I’ll be better. I mean it,” Al declared, matching Scorpius’ volume. “I know you don’t like fighting.”
“Not bad,” Tiering remarked, “I haven’t missed a day.” His tone was a strange mix of hopeful and proud that Harry recognised as seeking Malfoy’s approval. Harry was surprised, as that didn’t quite fit with the kid’s rebellious exterior. He examined the boy: heart-shaped face, strangely cherubic—it didn’t suit his long limbs. He had a spray of freckles across his nose and cheeks which made him look his age, despite his height. He wore torn jeans and a t-shirt with what Harry assumed was the logo of some muggle punk band across the front. His arms were shoved deep in his pockets.
Panic clutched at Draco’s heart, but he didn’t have time to heed it. An episode hadn’t occurred in public in years. The dosing by all accounts should be working, and he’d given Scorpius his medicine the evening before, he was certain. Damn Albus Potter and his dangerous meddling. They needed to get out of here this very instant.
“Happy Christmas,” Harry said to Clark’s mum, and then they left, footfalls creaking against the old floors.
“Yes, well, from what I heard, she was a cakewalk compared to the Carrows, so I should count myself lucky.” Harry went to bury his face in Draco’s neck, presumably in an effort to end this conversation, but Draco wasn’t having it. He wrenched his head around, while fumbling for his wand to cast a
Clark nodded as if finally accepting it. “And Draco’s Dad, he really did that? Hired someone to beat the shit out of him?”
“Yes, certainly. I’ll tell them I’ve secured a candidate, but I’ll not spoil the secret until Sunday, how’s that? Gives you a few days to spread the good news?”
“Yeah, alright then,” Harry remarked, “I’ll ask McGonagall. You sure you want me at tea with your mum?”
Thanks to everyone who stopped by, especially folks who left a comment. You are so wonderful and kind!!! Sorry this is so late, I lost power for like 6 hours yesterday, it was very inconvenient!
The tap was running to fill the sink, and Potter stood over it. Draco wanted to touch him. And why shouldn’t he? Potter hardly seemed opposed to it. Draco stepped in close and Potter stilled. Draco dipped his head, pressing his lips to the slope of Potter’s trapezius. Draco flicked his gaze up to observe Potter in the reflection of the window over the sink. The man’s eyes were downcast, his fingers clutching the lip of the discoloured porcelain. Draco shifted his mouth upwards, seeking the hinge of Potter’s jaw.
“Give him a bit,” he said, quiet and resigned, “you go after him now and you’re more likely to end up with a bloodied nose than anything else.”
“I know it’s upset you,” Harry says carefully, “but I don’t think anyone else noticed as much as you think they did. Charlie flirts with everyone, no one will give it a passing thought. And almost everyone had something to drink, some more than others.”
The condescending words seared through him, even as Draco grumbled out something low and bitter. Harry just smiled and patted his cheek and it was belittling and enraging and yet so damned arousing that Draco thought he might lose it entirely.
“Thank you,” he said, then jumped back, as a cold spell smacked him directly on the belly. He clutched Remy close as the spell began to spread. Harry could feel it in his chest now, then his limbs. “What the hell was that?” he hissed.
“Oh, it’s nothing as dramatic as all that,” Draco admitted. “Only I suspect an offer is coming your way, and it could...complicate things.”
Draco didn’t want to examine too closely how Potter had already become something of a fixture in his days, even if it was just to share a glance and a nod across a corridor. He likewise ignored the bubbly sensation that was far too akin to yearning and which had only mounted as he had taken advantage of the lovely weather to fly into Hogsmeade.
“No,” Al agreed. “I can’t quite get a handle on it, especially not for other people. But I could understand it enough that I could turn it into something else. So I made a, oh, I don’t know, some sort of thought-editing spell. Any time I thought about Mum I would just snip away my next five seconds of thought. I’d skip ahead, and if I was still thinking of her, I’d do it again and again until I wasn’t. And if I was dwelling on a certain memory of her, I’d snip that away, too. So it didn’t hurt so badly.”
Harry nodded. He stalked around Malfoy, surveying his prey. He contracted his fingers once or twice around the handle of the tawse, grounding himself. Then, with the sounds of Malfoy’s anticipatory breaths in his ears, Harry drew his arm back and swung it forward. It came down with a satisfying thwack across Malfoy’s flank.
, Draco’s voice sounded in his ear so hot and filthy and crisp it was as if he was there beside him. For a long moment, Harry thought he might be losing his mind, but no, it was just his subconscious, borrowing Draco’s unquenchable cockiness, spurring him onward. Harry let out a loud, victorious whoop and the light turned red.
Draco gave him a puzzled look, “You’re right fit, Harry, you must know that; it wouldn’t kill you to dress yourself with that in mind.”
Al snorted. “Oh yes, I’m so incredibly jealous of you always doing exactly what you’re told and not thinking a single thought that hasn’t been fed to you by one professor or another.”
“Look,” Harry said, gently, “Leave her a note, say you were here and you’re going to spend the night at a friend’s. You can call her in the morning. I’m sure there’s a telephone box near my place. You can come stay with us. I’ve got plenty of space.”
"I think I am already," Draco observed. "Just being with you, seeing how you care for me and Clark and your friends, your adopted family. It makes me want to do the same, to be that for you. Generosity was something I was taught to see as a weakness, but you make it glorious. I love that in you. I love so much of you: your graciousness, your kindness, your sweetness and strength. All I've been thinking these last few days is how I had all that and I tossed it in the bin because I was too much of a coward to confide in you. That was an egregious error, one that I won't repeat. I won’t bungle this again, Harry, not like that. I’ll be someone you can trust, I swear to it. Please, baby. Believe me.”
“Tonight’s practice is just about getting to know each other” he explained, “This isn’t a tryout, don’t feel like you have to impress anyone here, it’s just a bit of fun. As you know, we’ve got several players without much experience, so I’m going to pair younger students with older students. If you’re only comfortable flying tonight, then just fly. If you’re up to it, we’ll add in a few easy drills.”
It was decided that Malfoy and Scorpius would return home to change (Malfoy, it seemed, found the idea of appearing in public so casually dressed nothing short of appalling) and they would all meet in the Leaky Cauldron at eleven.
“Talk to me about what?” Ginny asked, popping up over the hill. “I was just coming to find you all. Merlin, it’s beautiful out, isn’t it.”
Mrs. Weasley returned, followed by a hovering crystal punch bowl and several matching glasses. The dishes came to rest gently on the coffee table, which had been covered with a freshly-ironed tablecloth and two trays of baking. The crystal was too flowery and ornate to be of this decade, but if Malfoy noticed, he didn’t remark on it.
“Not Lavender, exactly,” Ron shrugged, “but maybe some sort of corrupted echo of her. Maybe she can enter students' heads at any time, but she can really only channel magic when she’s at her most powerful, around the full moon.”
The professor ushered the students down the twisting stairwell before bringing up the rear. Harry knew he should let go of Malfoy’s arm, didn’t have a reason to be holding onto it, but instead of releasing him, he slid his palm flush against Draco’s, interlocking their fingers as they followed the class down the stairs. All this was in full view of Professor Haberdash-Pewter, but Harry just couldn’t bring himself to care.
The room was nearly as ridiculously dim as the rest of the building, thus far, and Harry and Draco’s table was illuminated with a single, narrow candle. Harry wondered how they were supposed to read the menu or even make out what they were eating, but the dark did allow the illusion of anonymity—not that he was about to take any chances. He helped Draco out of his cloak and pulled out his chair, like he’d done that day when meeting Narcissa. Draco seemed to like the attention, and both actions were on Hermione’s approved list. As Malfoy sat, Harry leaned in and murmured in his ear: “Wealth addles the brain, if this is anyone’s idea of a good time.”
“I really don’t need you to walk with me. The Slytherin dormitories are hardly on your way,” Scorpius reminded the other boy.
“We’re not hiding it so much because we’re...gay,” Harry almost choked on the word, letting his hand drop. He wasn’t sure he’d said it out loud before. Not about himself.
Harry spotted the bag on the other side of the sofa, and slung it over one shoulder. He scooped up Remy, who made an unhappy noise at being taken away from his toy. Harry stepped towards the fireplace, only to remember it was the lack of Floo powder that had caused his current quagmire in the first place. It was then that he noticed his coin pouch on the mantle, beside where the Floo powder was normally housed. He knew he’d not put it there, in fact, he’d not seen the bag at all since he—since he gave it to Malfoy.
Harry awoke in the night. He might have cried out, but he couldn't say for certain; his memory was a mess of loss, hurt, and indistinct images he couldn't place.
“Of course you’d know about a thing like this,” Draco said dryly as they entered the passageway towards Hogsmeade. There was a forced quality to his words, as though he was trying to pretend this was all perfectly ordinary. Harry knew it was an act. They lit their wands to light the way.
“Oh, don’t get all misty-eyed, Dad,” Jamie recoiled. “You really are getting barmy in your old age. I only did it because Professor Malfoy told me to.”
Draco curled tighter to Harry’s back but even the reassuring press of their bodies didn’t soothe the frayed, persevering thoughts. He sat up.
He wiped a hand over his face and stared at her in awe. “How do you do it? Keep all these confidences? I couldn’t hide this from you for even one night.”
“How did your parents take it?” Harry asked Ron, as he sat transcribing Hermione’s letter. She had left for Hogsmeade to sort out Harry’s post, and Draco had taken Clark to the Manor to do some enforced flying, since the boy had complained about being bored one time too many.
“I can’t...promise anything. I’ve no idea if I’ll be good for him or if us working together will end in utter disaster, but I don't wish him any ill. No matter what happens, I wouldn’t wish that. He’s been through enough, and so have the kids. I know that.” He let out a tense breath, feeling suddenly laid bare. “Merlin, Granger, did you put Veritaserum in this tea?”
All the upset upon arrival also seemed to traumatise Harry's massive owl. He'd released her from her cage and she was now gawking at him with pitiful yellow eyes from her hiding place in the exposed beams of the sitting room.
“Fine,” Malfoy muttered. “Maybe I did. I’ve allowed myself to become quite isolated in the past few years. I suppose it was nice to...not do that.”
Jared’s hair was getting long, blond curls falling over his ears in a way that only served to make him look more cherubic, what with his blue eyes and rosy round cheeks. It was a stark contrast to Clark, who still had a bit of a hungry dog look, lean and scrappy, with his lime green mohawk and predilection for black T-shirts and torn jeans. But no matter what Draco had thought when he first saw Clark nearly two years ago now, when he looked at the boy now, he felt nothing but a swell of pride and affection and love.
Hermione grinned at him before chiming in with, "I could go for a cocoa, if the elves aren't too busy."
“Merlin, are you trying to out-compete Hermione for number of exams? Or do you just have a death wish? I’m barely writing half that!”
“He’s tired and a bit glum, Pans, he’s not incapable. Besides, where else do you propose I leave him? My parents, last I checked, were still in Azkaban, I can’t trust Astoria’s parents not to let her see him, Daphne’s on holidays of her own. I can’t take him with me, and I need these supplies to do my job.”
Eventually, they arrived in Hogsmeade and walked the quiet streets to Crabapple Cottage. The Harry-shaped hedge waved at them.
“Of course not. And I don’t suppose if Clark let you out, you’d promise to stop trying to off Slytherins?”
Harry felt a warm swell in his belly, Draco much preferred to receive affectionate terms than to use them, and Harry didn’t think he’d ever been on this end of things. He found he rather liked it. He wondered how he could get Draco to do it again.
Major thanks to everyone who took the time to read/kudos/comment. I'm so sorry I'm not updating as much as I would like. Studying is frustrating and the world is weary. Hope this can be a bit of escapism for anyone who needs it.
“That’s quite sweet, isn’t it?” Harry remarked, vaguely impressed. He would have just grabbed the first one he’d seen.
,” Harry couldn’t help but notice Draco preen a little at the words, “and I mostly can’t be arsed, but I don’t think I’m an
Hermione shifted beside him, dropping her head on his shoulder. Harry pressed his cheek to her hair as the last of his melancholy ripened into hope.
But things largely felt just as they were before, with the added benefit of being able to touch Draco casually in the corridors and wrap an arm around him in the evenings in front of the common room hearth. Malfoy was surprisingly amenable to public affection, provided it wasn’t crass, and Harry savoured the newfound freedom. He was also sleeping better, now that he didn't have to scarper back to his own bed early in the mornings.
“How are you doing, love, are you okay?” Harry asked between deep, searching kisses. With a sigh he pulled back so he could see all of Draco’s face.
“It’s no trouble to keep him here for the night,” Harry blurted out. “You can Apparate home and Floo back in the morning. Or I can make up one of the guest rooms if you’d rather stay close. With a family as big as Gin’s, we have several.”
Draco held up a palm and the boys fell silent. “It’s my fault,” he stated quietly. “I didn’t realise the time. Scorpius is overdue for his potion.”
“It was her voice,” Harry determined, “In Clark’s memories. It was similar enough to Mrs. Brown’s that I didn’t put it together. It was all sickly sweet like she used to talk to you, Ron.”
“Will you take care of Constance?” Harry said suddenly, “She gets lonely and hungry and she sometimes hides in the canopy of my bed. I think the other owls bully her.”
Malfoy swept toward the kitchen, Harry following hopelessly along behind him. Harry tried not to notice the way those smart wool trousers fit snugly to Malfoy’s arse.
“You’re brilliant, Pie,” Harry told him. Meat Pie nipped his finger with a bit more force than necessary, and took off into the dark summer sky.
A few minutes later, Harry sat down with his tea at the table near the window and opened his potions textbook to review for Monday’s lesson—something he had been doing more often lately, at Draco’s decree. He couldn’t concentrate. He just kept looking from the entrance to the window, watching the workers hoist blocks, transfigure rubble, discuss plans. They’d recently finished the central tower and were moving on to the astronomy tower. Soon, all that would be left to fix was the seventh floor corridor, but Harry knew that would never be the same. The room of requirement was gone forever.
“How does an 18 year old get to be rich as you, then?” Clark demanded, over the thrum of the cart wheels and the rush of cold air, “You get all that from the war? Do you get paid for being a war hero?”
The kettle whistled but Harry ignored it, rooted to the faded tiles underfoot. Ginny had chosen them herself, a golden sienna she said made her feel warm inside. Hermione stepped around him to get the kettle, pouring the boiling water into the teapot.
“I tried the spell Granger taught us,” the boy who must have been Marvin explained over Hiram's fretting, “The one that treats fiendfyre? And it worked a bit but I couldn't manage on my own.”
There was no hesitation in the kiss: In an instant, Potter’s hand was grasping the back of Draco’s skull, steadying him for the heady onslaught. Potter’s lips were rough and sure, and then they were gone, leaving Draco gasping. It had been everything he’d craved: Potter’s mouth had been bullish and intent despite his professed misgivings. Draco could have sworn he’d tasted Potter's want, and now it was gone he felt suddenly bereft.
To Harry’s surprise, Zerk laughed. It was a rich laugh, deep, appreciative and a little contagious. Harry felt himself returning it with a little grin.
“It’s hideous,” Draco observed, some measure of awe in his voice, “like centuries of inbreeding hideous. Granger, is this thing
“So good, sweetheart,” Harry cooed. He stepped in close, the strained fabric at his groin brushing along Draco’s flushed cheek. “Can you feel what you do to me when you’re good for me?”
The hall was in chaos when Harry and his contingent returned: students bunched in little groups, talking over each other; others loudly practicing their new counterspell; and still others comforting weeping first years. Harry found Hermione at the front of the room.
“For your sake then. I hate them doubting my affection for you. If it would make you feel more secure, I’m happy to do it.”
“Why shouldn’t I?” Harry said earnestly. “You don’t get to choose how the people in your life hurt you. It’s inevitable. You only get to choose how you react. Hell, you taught me that, with how you are with your mum.”
“Not that she was violent or vindictive like this in life,” Hermione was quick to correct him, “but it was a bit of her essence so I can sort of, er, see it, I suppose.”
“Well, what do you want me to do about that?” Harry prompted, feeling suddenly very tired of conflict and of memories. He felt his own anger gathering behind his breastbone, but he knew allowing it to flare and match Ron's would end poorly for them all. Instead he maintained a low tone, subdued and reasonable. “Assume the worst and not allow anyone a chance for growth or change? Doesn’t sound very practical, mate. Hatred isn’t bred in the bone. You’re perfectly aware of that fact, we all are. It’s learned, and it can be unlearned. And I truly believe Draco’s done that work. He’s not the boy he was, Ron, I’ll swear to it.”
Clark’s eyes narrowed angrily, “Well, I’m muggle-born, aren’t I? Barely know a thing about any of this. I just know its fucking weird and I miss my mates and I can’t charge my mp3 player in this bloody castle and the battery ran out weeks ago. How does anyone in this world listen to music? Besides,” his voice dulled, “my mum, she’s….not well. I sort of thought I might just be getting what’s she’s got. But then after I did what the lady in my brain told me to, the feeling went away and I was just relieved. But then the next morning it was gone so I thought maybe it had been a bad dream? Or I hoped it was, maybe.”
Malfoy responded so gloriously, cheeks hollowing, a devastating suction on his fingers, the warm muscle of his tongue firing up all the nerves along the surface of Harry’s fingers.
Scorpius had never thought about his Father having a beauty regimen. It seemed a somehow dangerous thing to say, especially when it didn’t quite sound like a joke. Such a remark certainly wouldn’t fly in the Slytherin boys’ dormitory, and yet Harry didn’t look at all interested in mockery. Instead, he stepped in closer until he was standing behind Father. Harry’s hand fell onto the place where Father’s neck met his shoulder and squeezed companionably.
“I’m not the cleverest bloke,” Potter spoke over Draco’s plaintive excuses. “But I know my own mind, and I’d thank you not to assume I don’t. I’ve never seen my magic respond the way it does to you. It means something, Draco, I know it does. And I fancy you, don't I? I like it when you're around. And we’re pretty alright together, aren’t we? Those few days, with the kids, it just...worked. Seeing you with them, the way you manage everything...us together, it’s not totally unthinkable is it? I’m not naïve. I’m perfectly aware we have no way of knowing how this thing between us might turn out, and I’m not asking to rush into any promises but I think we owe it to ourselves to follow this thing where it leads. If I thought you felt differently, I’d let it go, but—”
“I’ll take your word for it,” Draco had assured her. He’d not thought it would be worth getting into how Edward Lupin was the closest thing Draco had to a living cousin, and how he knew the young man only as a student and now, he supposed, as Harry’s godson. Draco’d never pressed the family connection. He’d assumed being a Malfoy relation would not be something of which one would be proud. At that thought, Draco had shaken his head and turned his attention back to the story.
“What level of damage control is required for your current crisis of self or what have you?” Malfoy clarified. “Would you like me to tell you it’s perfectly normal for blokes to need a bit of comfort in stressful times? That what we did doesn’t have to mean anything? That it was simply a massive error in judgment and we can pretend it never happened?” Malfoy’s tone was mocking in its sarcasm, a challenge.
“Come along, Sparrow,” Draco insisted, giving Harry one final kiss, and tucking his shirt back in, “Those jumpers aren’t going to try on themselves.”
“Hm?” Draco asked absently, petting Crookshanks who had slipped inside the canopy a few minutes prior and was currently settled beside Draco’s attentive fingers.
Wow, okay I have been dreading writing this chapter because it is not as dialogue heavy and action is not really my comfort zone, but I'm, like, fairly pleased with it over all which is a major relief. Hope it doesn't disappoint!
“Really does,” Harry sympathised, “Let’s call it there for the night. Keep meditating and we’ll meet again in a few days, if you’re game.”
“Is one supposed to buy a gift for Valentine’s?” Harry asked uncertainly. Other than agreeing to the dinner, he’d not put any thought into the following day at all.
“A git!” Harry choked. “He nearly murdered Ron, and Katie Bell, and Dumbledore! That’s hardly nothing!”
Potter stirred again, unsurprising as it was early yet, and ran lazy fingertips over the back of Draco’s hand. Draco had an absurd instinct to turn his hand over and link his fingers through Potter’s and just give in to sleep. He clamped it down, lying still.
“And I certainly didn’t want to choose you. Denied myself for weeks even though all I wanted was to press you against various surfaces and snog you senseless. But here we are, and it’s pretty fucking glorious, I think. So maybe I don’t mind not having full control in what I feel. It’s worked out pretty well, so far.”
“I don’t think I am,” Pansy considered. “It may get you off, I'm sure it does, but I also think you've got something to prove. Maybe only to yourself, but maybe not.  You need to test yourself, produce evidence that you can withstand the pain, that you can forebear. I think you like to be told how strong you are, how brave, how good–”
Harry barely slept the night of New Year’s Eve. He awoke that morning wired with anxiety. Malfoy, making a social call to The Burrow, eurgh—it made his stomach turn. Thankfully, Mrs. Weasley heaped him, Ginny, Ron and Hermione with household chores immediately after breakfast. The Burrow might not be upscale, but Merlin, it would be clean.
Draco’s voice cut off in a sob and Harry wrapped his arms around the other boy, pulling him close. “I don’t know why I did that, Harry,” Draco cried, “I didn’t want to, I just heard the words coming out and I was screaming at myself to shut up, but I couldn’t, I just served you up to him like some sacrificial lamb. How could I do that? I’m a fucking monster.”
But Draco only fixed them with a cold glare. “I’m stabilizing her neck, which the lot of you should have done before just fishing her willy-nilly out of the Thames. Now I’m going to cast a warming spell, which I notice still hasn’t been done, despite the fact that it is the middle of winter and she is sopping wet. Is that going to be a problem for anyone?”
Narcissa’s upper lip twitched in distaste at the mention of Gladrags and Harry almost laughed with nervous relief. Some things didn't change, at least.
“Well done, Gibbens,” Harry proclaimed, “This is excellent work, truly! I’m sure the team will be very happy with it. And Hermione here has agreed to help me transfigure us some badges.”
in all the kissing. And then Harry had thrown the scraps of his dignity to the wind and begged Malfoy to stay the night. In Harry’s bed. No, in Harry and Ginny’s bed. Staying the night was the least of it, Harry had to admit to himself, because in reality, Malfoy had
“It’s not about me!” Clark cried out. The exclamation launched him to his feet, and Clark paced the glossy granite floor of the library, his hands shoved into the back pockets of his jeans. His elbows stuck out behind him like spiky vestigial wings. He was all sharp edges tonight.
“Are you doing Harry’s laundry? Actually, you know what? Never mind. Not important. And I’m not just sorry about the accident. I owe you a proper apology for what I did and said.”
“You cold, babe?” Potter’s words were heavy with sleep as he kicked down the duvet low enough so that he could yank it back up and cover their bodies. Draco bit his lip at the wholly
“Go wash up and make sure your sister does the same,” Harry told Al. The boy seemed happy enough with the instructions and left the room.  Harry looked around at the mad eruption of trinkets and loose parchment that was Albus’ room. At the slight rise and fall of Scorpius’ shoulders as he slept. At the sketches and notebooks and little diagrams Al had Spellotaped to the wall. How could Harry have been so oblivious? He’s put his own pain above his children’s; it was reprehensible.
“Not a lot of other people crawling into my bed at…” Scor yawned and reached into the shirt his flannel pyjamas and retrieved his ever present pocket watch. The cover sprung open, emitting a faint light. “Seven past one in the morning.”
“Merlin, I don’t remember!” Jones whinged. “A week ago maybe, likely just in the bin in the common room.”
Harry’s knee-jerk reaction was to bark at her: of course he had, how could she not see that, but he tamped down on that response and instead gave Hermione’s question some honest consideration.
“With a massive trunk and a birdcage? Not likely. Just a few more years and you’ll be able to apparate,” Harry promised, standing to give each of the boys a hug.
CWs: Sex after the ***** (five * not three!), D/s dynamics, anal sex, light spanking and choking,  orgasm control, maybe light humiliation depending on how you interpret things.
Before Malfoy could say another word, Harry was pressed against him, kissing him ferociously.  Crookshanks darted off the bed, affronted by the sudden movement. Harry wrapped strong fingers along the base of Draco’s head, anchoring him.
“No,” Potter agreed. “And here I am moping again. Sorry. My problem is that it’s only ever one branch of the Weasley family or another here for a visit. I’m not used to actual guests. Merlin’s teeth, I really am pants at this whole hostessing thing.” He gave Draco an abashed little half grin.
They walked another block, Harry inwardly reviewing the last couple of hours: how witty and charming and warm Tennyson was; how at times, he and Draco seemed to be speaking in a language Harry only half understood. The words were familiar, but their meanings shrouded. Names of designers, socialites, products, events, all skirting over Harry’s brain, refusing to consolidate into something sensical.
“You’ll get in touch if they're not,” Draco decided, “Be sure to address any communication to me, not Harry, he never checks his post.”
. I understand that many of you know these spells already, out of necessity. I encourage you to continue with your extracurricular approach. For my part, I will attempt to supplement your knowledge with some more esoteric spells:
Most of the team gave friendly good-byes and took off towards the shed. Clark tried to make a hasty escape, but he’d been avoiding Harry since the Occlumency lesson and Harry wasn’t about to let that slide. “Tiering,” he called out, “help me pack up.”
Draco didn’t suppose he should focus on the idea of Potter’s insatiability when it came to Draco, but he lingered there for a moment anyway, flashing the other man a smug smile.
“Really? Because I love being kidnapped, and was hoping to make it an annual occurrence,”  Scorpius drawled.
The cold spur of guilt transformed into something much warmer and far more pleasant. Harry felt a bit afraid to examine it too closely, lest it be fleeting.
“Ha,” Malfoy replied, straightening his jumper as if hugging put undue wrinkles into it, “I meant generally speaking.”
“Thanks,” Harry replied, too exhausted to take the bait, “Merlin, have I done the right thing? Bringing Clark here? I know this was just supposed to be time for us, for once. I'm sorry.”
“I know you’re not, but he misbehaves when he’s hurting, and unfortunately, you bear the brunt of it, while I don’t even know it’s going on! He lashes out in different ways. They can be quieter, I think, and maybe more cruel, and you certainly don’t have to deal with them. I’ll speak with him. You’re plenty admirable.”
“Nothing reprehensible. Bringing me refreshments. Keeping this incident private. Perhaps some Hogsmeade shopping on weekends.”
Harry made a little show of looking around the newly constructed room, “Great hall, Hogwarts,” he commented, “no, think I’m alright, Parkinson, thanks.” He proceeded to dish up some sausage and toast, first for Malfoy, then for himself. Pansy gave them a scrutinizing look but no one else seemed to have noticed.
They took to the dungeons, since Harry felt like he could always get lost in those labyrinthine passages, and maybe getting unlost would distract the both of them from their heartache. So far, it was ineffective.
Scorpius scoffed, his lips pursing and his pace quickening. Clearly, Al wasn’t the only one he was mad at.
Clark scoffed and jutted out his chin. Sunlight through the window lit up his freckles as he stepped forward. He looked so young and determined it made Harry’s heart ache. Like he was ready to fight for this thing, even if Harry wasn't. Clark didn’t even dignify the cliché with a response, only scowled up at Harry expectantly.
Draco sniffed, “Rather obsolete now, since my status is dashed to hell and Potter will never use his status for anything interesting. It’s all orphans and acceptance with this one.”
The witch pursed her lips, “Difficult to say. The ones who aren't awake are at least breathing on their own, which is a good sign. Depends how long they were unconscious for, really. It’s the brain we worry about in situations like this.”
Harry curled inward, feeling the urgent panic disperse a little. He brushed the hair from Draco’s face and kissed the line of his cheekbone.
He watched the other boy scan the note. The muscle in Draco’s cheek tensed and his lips flattened. Then, without hesitation, he tossed the parchment in the fire.
“So you’re keeping it a secret? But nobody seems to hassle Dean any,” Clark pointed out, crossing his arms, “And you could have told me! Not really fair that you know all my secrets and I don’t know yours.”
“Yeah,” Harry conceded, taking a quick peek at the baby in the crook of his arm. He stepped in and pressed a brief kiss to Draco’s mouth. “You’ll stay? Please?”
“Yes, alright, if you’re hungry,” Potter agreed. “Al, would you cut another slice for your sister, please?”
? Harry, you robbed a bank? Why aren’t you in prison? Does the minister know he just handed me off to a criminal?”
“Remind me again why we’re doing this?” Malfoy muttered darkly as he, Harry, Goyle and Ron traipsed their way down to the newly rebuilt quidditch pitch that evening.
“I’ve been living what it is to be without her,” Harry murmured, his voice rough and catching in his throat.
Molly smiled and patted his cheek. “Well, you go take care of your charges, but do call me if you need anything. I’ve a wonderful hearty oatmeal recipe from Mrs. Warble’s cookbook—”
Draco eyed him warily for a moment, then his face softened. He rolled his eyes a bit, shaking his head, “Oh alright then,” he conceded, “We can meet with this Clark kid, but I promise, we’re wasting our time, so don’t you go expecting miracles.”
“We’re going flying, Harry, now,” Ginny announced after a hearty breakfast, courtesy of Mr. Granger. Harry didn’t bother arguing, just went to fetch his
“Not more than usual,” Jamie muttered, rolling over, finally. His eyes were red-rimmed and his cheeks indrawn, as though tonight’s supper wasn’t the first meal he’d missed. “He really is a bossy git, though," Jamie sniffed.
“Need you fucking in me. Right now,” Draco growled, yanking his own shirt off his head. “So fucking hot, so gorgeous, laying into them like that. Telling them you’re mine, the whole fucking world knows it now, Harry, and Merlin help me, I want them to.”
was, you know, pretty ridiculously content. The kids were exhausting but so much fun and so clever and bursting with energy and ideas, and work wasn’t the most exciting thing ever, but I was decent at it, and Gin was there and we’d been together since we were kids, basically, and everything was so...beautifully mundane. I know it sounds quaint and small and terribly dull, but it was just what I’d hoped my life would be.”
Tanya beamed, linking her arms through his and Draco’s and leading them to one of the grey, plastic tables. She sat herself between them, chatting happily about Wizard History Month and the club’s forays into what she dubbed cross-cultural education. Harry just nodded along, avoiding looking at Draco for fear of dissolving into bubbles of absurd laughter. Tanya introduced them to the other folks at the table, a couple of friendly muggles a few years older than them and a witch, their aunt, who looked just as amused as Harry felt.
“What were you even doing there?” Malfoy demanded, once the two were out of earshot of the infirmary, “you better not be back to your old stalking habits, Potter, so help me.”
Thanks for reading and double thanks for commenting! I know it's all chat, back to plot next chapter, promise.
Before Draco could find the words to reply, a knock was heard at the bedroom door, which was then opened to reveal a house elf in a satin gown and wearing a towering powdered wig. The thing had a soft turquoise colour to it, and cast a sickly pall onto the elf’s mottled skin.
“Ginny hated that tendency,” he continued. “She was always on about the silent treatment being an emotionally manipulative and small minded tactic and no substitute for open communication and all that. When we were first married, she was very frank about things, chiding me and being a good sport even when I was forgetful or distracted or untidy.”
Over the noises of Greyback, Harry could still hear the wet crunch of Draco’s bones and the unnatural shifting of marrow as Wilma Brown popped his vertebra like ripe cherries.
Harry and Draco found him sitting on the cold stone steps a few minutes later, wiping at his face with angry, balled up hands. To Harry’s surprise, Draco didn’t hesitate. He simply dropped down beside the boy.
Jamie said ‘everyone’ but Harry had a niggling suspicion that what he meant was ‘Professor Malfoy’. Harry didn’t press.
“Do I miss being carted around listening to my father expound his bigoted opinions on every person and place and being entirely at the mercy of his peevish temper? Not at all. But I do miss the sights.”
“Please don’t worry yourself, my love,” Draco said, squeezing Scorpius’ shoulder on his way out of the kitchen. “Sometimes adults misbehave, but we’ll make up, at least for Mr. Potter’s sake, I’m sure.”
Januarius was standing near Fort’s shoulder surveying them, impassive as always. His strawberry blond hair was styled into a sleek pompadour. It was quite a departure from the long sheets of hair that he’d hidden behind for the last few years. With those clipped short, his thin, pale neck and petite features were exposed. His little bow mouth and button nose were simply
. I wasn’t expecting such a quick turnaround! Not that I’m not thankful. I really could use the sleep.”
“Lily, leave him,” Draco interrupted quickly. "Your father’s tired. Let him have a bit of rest, hmm?"
“I had myself just as convinced,” Harry explained. “But since coming back from Molly’s... Well. Jamie’s been struggling.”
“It’s been two months,” Hermione’s voice was gentle, but it tore at him like incisors into meat. “I think you might have to consider what your life might look like without her.”
Harry watched the fluid, open movements of the interviewer as he explained the morning’s proceedings and offered them tea. He tossed his mane and grinned and sparkled through it all. His every gesture was mesmerising and Harry started, identifying his feelings as those of attraction. Harry knew he was attracted to people who weren’t Draco. He also knew that was natural and normal and all that, it just startled him when those people were men. It still felt new and if not unsettling, at least a bit surprising. He tightened his arm around Draco and was relieved to feel Draco give his thigh a little comforting squeeze in return.
Myrtle blinked behind her spectacles, shocked with Clark's cheek. “Would I like to be trapped in a tie clip for eternity? Well, no, I don’t think I would. That would be even more dull and lonesome than haunting this bathroom. At least here I can explore the castle when I get bored, visit other ghosts and get the news.”
“Good plan,” Hermione agreed, “Let’s get back while there’s still a bit of time to eat. By the way, you know I love you two very, very much, and I’m glad you’ve made up. I’m trying to make a point of saying that more. Now that we know life is a fleeting thing and all that.”
“I’ll take it under advisement,” Draco replied. He kissed Harry’s head. “Why don’t you shower. I’ll have Kreacher make you up some tea and breakfast. I think he’s a bit pleased we’re here, don’t you? I'm quite sure I heard him
“He did!” Teddy insisted. “I’ve been here a week and he’s not missed an evening, Professor, I swear.”
“And part of me wishes you would. But for Dudley’s sake...leave them be. I won’t have you going to Azkaban on behalf of them.”
“Er, yes, alright. Fine. Lily, teeth and pyjamas and then I’ll come sing,” Potter caved, looking helplessly at Draco. “And, ah, yeah, Remy sleeps in my room still, but his change table and footie pyjamas are in the nursery. I’ll show you.”
“Don’t be petulant,” Draco rebuked, but his fingers were gripping the delicate handle of teacup too tightly and he wasn’t meeting Harry’s eyes. “It’s best if we keep to ourselves, if we don’t muddy our circumstances with a damn affair.”
Harry took off his glasses and stored them away before rolling over and burying his face in Draco’s stomach. He pushed at Draco’s vest, moving it out of the way, he wanted to be skin-to-skin. Malfoy stripped off the shirt, and began to stroke Harry’s hair.
“Well, that’s quite nice,” Harry admired, “Well done, Hops. Will be easy to spot out there. Now, remember, play fair, take risks, enjoy yourselves.”
Fort had been instantly charmed by the cosy little space, and when she’d stumbled across some rather battered furniture in a storage room during detention one evening, she’d recruited Jamie to help her lug up the best of the lot. So now they had both the legless chair that Jamie preferred, a yellow and purple striped chesterfield that looked as though it had been shredded by a single swipe of massive talons, and a table that stood on precarious, spindly legs, no more than three of which ever touched the floor at the same time. In the corner was a large sculpture of a large toadstool shielding a rather put-out looking kneazle. That one had been a beast to drag to the Alcove, but Fort had absolutely insisted. Occasionally, the kneazle would pace around the stalk of the mushroom, and then settle back down, glaring at them.
Harry elbowed him, “Oh, don’t tell him that, then he’ll just get one to please you. I had a snowy owl, and she was, well, a bit ornery, actually, but wonderful.”
Harry studied him and Draco felt pinned like an insect in a Herbology lab: exposed and examined without his say so.
Albus was an expert at staying out past curfew. He’d explored the castle from dungeon to turret in his first month there and he knew all the corridors the prefects never wandered (nearly all of the fourth floor), the best bribes to exchange for Peeves’ silence (anything from Uncle George’s shop) and that if he brought the little oil can he'd inherited from Grandad, he could even appease the animated suit of armour that guarded the north wing by spritzing its joints.
“Aren’t you supposed to be, like, supportive or something?” Jamie wondered. He had, until a week and a half ago, known their good friend Januarius Boone as Linda Boone, but on the first day back at Hogwarts, Jamie and Fortitude had been informed of some important changes. Jamie had been taken a bit by surprise by his friend coming out, but while he still slipped up occasionally, he’d found the adjustment easier than expected.  “Like, what if you hurt his feelings?”
Also, some of the ideas (especially erasing painful memories) from this are borrowed from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I just think it is such an intriguing philosophical idea that I wanted to play around with it some!
“Draco's hardly helping, he's being a git, and I know it. Ron’s not wrong, is the thing,” Harry acknowledged. “I’m sure I’d react the same if I found out Ron was carousing with Theo Nott or the like, and Nott didn’t nearly kill me.”
“Your words, not mine,” Draco replied magnanimously, rooting through the pocket on the headboard, giving Harry a rather nice view of that pert, pale arse.
Malfoy was fastening the buttons on his shirt sleeve. The man was all lean lines and cut angles and even in yesterday’s clothes he appeared neatly pressed and striking. Because apparently Harry found men striking now.
Ron shrugged, “They were some awfully overwrought reactions. Took things to a bit of an extreme, didn’t she? Reminded me of when I dated her.” He scrunched up his nose, “Just a bit much, you know?”
The bathroom was suspiciously quiet. None of the sniffles or whimpers that Harry had heard in the past were echoing from the grimy stone walls.
“We tried giving you space, because that seemed to be what you wanted, but I don’t think that’s making anything any better. I want to help you, Harry, we all do.”
“Draco, stop,” Harry cut him off. He covered Draco’s free hand with his. The man didn’t pull away. “I know it’s too much too soon and seeing me everyday is more than we bargained for. But for my sake, it’s not something I can just turn off. I still want it, still want you.”
“It’s actually pretty common,” Tanya piped up, “magic can really divide families. Magical children are shunned, or normal children are, depending on the dynamics. It can really be a bit of a kick in the teeth. I’m not sure I’d even talk to my step-sisters if it wasn’t for the LMU, but we actually have a wonderful relationship now. They even got me an owl for my last birthday so I can write to them!”
“Oh, er…” Harry started, his brain scrambling to come up with a way of saying it was mostly just trying to mix up years, houses, and positions without hurting her feelings. Before he could come up with a coherent explanation, four more players arrived, most with broomsticks slung over their shoulders.
with this mounting pressure constricting his chest. He walked to the mantle, hoping desperately that there would be some Floo powder after all. He wondered if he could get home on just the dregs. Instead, his eyes fell on Potter’s Auror portrait. It was old. Potter was perhaps twenty: handsome and youthful, and a fair bit scrawnier than he was now. He was smiling warmly from the frame, determined and excited for his future. Despite everything the boy in the photo had just survived, his light had not been diminished. It had taken the Weasley girl walking out on him to do that. And even still, Potter was all compassion and patience, refusing to say a word against the woman. It was ludicrous. Well, perhaps Potter couldn’t keep his own grudges, but that was alright. Draco could keep them for him.
He walked towards him, Malfoy’s eyes opening. He jerked his head in a lazy greeting. Harry positioned himself in the adjacent stall, elbows propped up on the partition.
“Professor Malfoy knows about things,” Jamie told him. “It’s like he teaches all the time. Which I would think should be boring or infuriating, but it somehow isn’t. It’s like...he’s really hard to impress, but sometimes you get the answer right and he’s quite pleased with you, and that feels good, you know?”
“I disarmed him at the same time as he fired a killing curse at me. His spell backfired, ending his life.”
“Merlin,” Potter breathed. He leant forward, forearms resting on his knees, that familiar crease etched between his brows. “And he couldn’t control it on his own, I presume? That’s what the potion is for?”
They were just about to turn down the corridor when Jamie caught sight of a familiar bright blond head. The scene from the evening prior came unbidden to Jamie’s mind and he winced. It must have been a pretty rotten ordeal for the poor kid.
Harry had not felt like a guest in The Burrow since he was a teenager, but he felt very much like one now, even as he placed the tea pot, cups and saucers down upon the broad, crocheted doily that covered the coffee table. He'd been welcome here because of Ron, and then later because of Ginny. Being here without either of them felt jarringly atypical.
Instead, Harry said something like, “Oh, love,” and put an arm around him and ushered him to the room, sounding just as concerned as if something bad had actually happened.
Draco reached out to fiddle with Harry’s collar, not meeting his eyes. “He said I should make you feel responsible, and say it was DA students. If you felt it was your fault, at least partially, you’d try to make it right. It sounded likely to work. So that’s what I did.”
Jamie was a little late for lunch, having just met with the Gryffindor Head of House to discuss switching from Care of Magical Creatures to Hexbreaking. He was feeling peckish by now and started to put together a sandwich for himself from the cold meat and cheese spread. Jamie was always partial to sandwiches.
Harry was shocked to be confronted with two pages of photos.  The first showed a stern and beautiful Walburga holding a squalling, dark-haired infant wriggling in her arms. Next to it was a portrait of a young Sirius, maybe seven or eight, a defiant tilt to his chin, wavy hair gelled into place. He was wearing plaid trousers and balling his fists, eyes flickering from side to side, as if to determine if he could make a break for it. On the page opposite was Sirius in his Hogwarts robes, a smirk on his face. Below, the portrait description read, “Sirius Black, Christmas holidays, 1971. Orion and Walburga’s son was the first Black to have been sorted into the Gryffindor House at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”
“Is it possible there is another actor at play?” Hermione asked, “Someone who was responsible for the Legilimency?”
Draco coughed on a sip of tea. Harry shot him a brief glower. “Not quite, love,” Harry told Lily. “Though it is kind of you to think so. More because...well, this particular wand saw me as its master.”
He didn’t know why he was still in Potter’s house, pretending like it was an impossibility to carry his son the blocks required to Apparate home. He didn’t know why he’d decided to cook a large family dinner, or listen to a bedtime story, or change a nappy, or wash Potter’s dishes. He just knew that for some indiscernible reason, he found he liked it here. He liked the chaos, and the guile it took to shape Jamie into someone agreeable. He liked the warmth and heft of having a baby in his arms again, after so many years, and he especially liked Potter’s furtive glances, rife with relieved confusion.
“That’s about the long and the short of it,” Ron agreed, “Thought I suspect the first led to the second.”
Harry shook his head. “I kept things to myself on purpose. You were my friends, I didn’t want you to look at me differently; I was terrified of your pity. None of this is your fault, Ron—”
Albus hurried to his feet, and Scorpius hopped off the back of the chair. Talking over one another in their excitement, the two boys demonstrated the lurching, truncated figure they drew with their wands in the air.
“I’ll speak to Awling this weekend after practice,” Harry determined. “If she can convince the seventh year girls, that’s a decent start.”
“If Mum doesn’t need my help then I’d love to,” Clark said, blushing beneath his freckles, obviously pleased. “Thanks.”
“We won’t let that happen. You can go with Draco to see his mum, or go with me to Ron’s, or even back to Hogwarts, if you like. But there’s still more of a chance your mum will show up and we’re just borrowing trouble worrying about all this.”
“I’ll deal with it,” Draco heard himself saying. “You’re exhausted. You’ve been exhausted all day. Go to bed. I’ll manage.”
, behind. On the other hand, this just confirms my fears: they didn’t accept me before not because of my capabilities but because of bloody gossip and I honestly don’t know if I want to play for a team like that.”
“A proximity ward and your silencing charm. We’ll hear him if he needs us, he won’t hear us. And now, I’m placing a moratorium on any and all Tiering-related content because we’re finally alone and I’ve been waiting actual weeks for you to fuck me and I don’t intend on waiting any longer.”
With effort, Draco shuffled forward until he was straddling Harry’s leg. His heart was beating frantically, both with excitement and horror at what he was about to do. He went to rearrange his cock with his hand, but Harry batted it away.
“I know, sweetheart. It was very decent of you to try and protect your friend,” Harry told him. “But in future, can you please make an effort to talk to me before you make big mind-altering decisions? For yourself or anyone else?”
“Hardly,” Harry said, “not even a team name, but I was thinking it would be good to know how to complete the charm for when we do. Give them a little sense of unity. ”
Harry couldn’t help but wonder if those words would still hold should the other man learn of the true nature of his and Draco’s relationship, but then he shook the thought away. Ron loved him, Harry knew that to be true, and they’d weathered much worse together. He would tell Ron about Draco, he determined, should their tentative attachment continue past the first term. Until then, it would just be a lot of fuss for what, from the outside, would appear as nothing more than a summer fling. Harry didn’t see the point in getting into it.
Harry gave a vague wave of his hand. “Sophisticated, witty, in the know. A bit camp. Sometimes I feel like I’m not very good at being bent.”
That wasn’t all that he needed to ponder on, however. There was also the news that his grandmother, an accused Death Eater who had been complicit in two wars, was being released from Azkaban. He knew very little of his grandmother. Father had said she was a cold woman, who had spoilt him nonetheless, but who had been too weak to stand up against the Dark Lord and his cruelty. Father had said her actions at the end of the war, in helping Harry, were just a selfish bargain to save her own hide and Father’s. Scorpius wondered if he’d ever meet her. He wondered if she really would end up tucked away in the Manor while he and Father spent more and more time with the Potters. He wondered if prison had changed her, and what she was like, and if she knew about him or wanted to meet him. Most of all, he wondered if
Draco gave a shaky nod and Harry seated himself on the adjacent chair. Malfoy reached out almost involuntarily, and Harry wrapped the boy’s hands in his.
Molly clapped Main on the shoulder. “Rotten luck,” she said sweetly, her charmed voice soaring clearly out over the mass of chattering students. “But I think we all know how to be decent, thanks all the same. Now, can we please get a warm welcome for the
Draco gathered towels, toiletries and fresh clothes and then shepherded Harry down the corridor of eighth year boys who all stared curiously. Harry kept a hold of Draco's hand, even as everyone looked at them. He didn't mind being looked at. He just liked the feeling of Draco's fingers slotted neatly between his like they belonged.
Draco blinked again and swallowed. Then he rolled over again, shoving Harry to his back and planting his face into Harry’s stomach. He shuddered once, gripping the fabric of Harry’s trousers over his hip, then stilled.
“This is...worrisome,” McGonagall reflected. “I have been distracted by planning for today, and have failed to pursue the issue of the theft of Mr. Malfoy’s letters, for which I apologise.”
“Fine,” Draco agreed. His tone was one of exasperation, but a slight blush across those enviable cheekbones revealed something else entirely. “Since you’re determined to be stubborn about it. I suppose we can give it a go. Don’t blame me if it all ends in rubble.”
“Better than I wanted to,” Harry admitted, “part of me wanted to lash out or interrogate them, find out if they are connected to all this Slytherin business.”
“Wizard’s honour,” agreed the healer, setting his wand alight. Clark opened his mouth. “Do you mind if I show your friend here what I’m looking for?”
Harry caught him on the upper thigh. Draco didn’t cry out this time, only hiccuped, his shoulders shaking.
Draco handed off the baby and then went to brush his teeth and wash his face in the little en suite still littered with Ginevra Weasley’s things.
Ginny blew her whistle again, and the players took their positions. She released the bludgers and snitch and tossed the quaffle into the air.
“I’m sorry for acting out,” he murmured, “especially after you’ve been so generous all day. I don’t know why I got so mad about that painting, but I shouldn’t have let it make me act all ungrateful. Thank you for the lovely coats and the new quills, and the haircut, and my owl, I love him.”
The soup and bread Harry begrudgingly choked down didn’t seem to have the desired effect. His heart continued its frantic rhythm of worry that he could scarce believe had persisted hour after hour. His limbs were heavy with dread, his head pinched and aching. Even Draco’s sure hand against his back did nothing to calm him.
He examined the circular common room: the sofas were torched and the beautiful arched bookcases carved into the rounded walls of the sunny area were singed. He couldn’t see anyone, though, and when they looked, the dormitories appeared undamaged and vacant. As they turned to leave, the Fat Friar appeared beside the grand hearth at the far end of the room. He looked melancholy and confused, and quite unlike himself. Harry gave him a wave.
“You know those three, Mum,” Ginny rolled her eyes, “always keep the action to themselves, even when their very talented friend and sister could have helped. Can’t believe I don’t get even a year outside of Ron’s obnoxious shadow.” She eyed Hermione, Harry and Draco, “Hope you three know how lucky you are not to have scads of older siblings. They always insist they know better.”
“Fucking hell,” Draco said, when he could catch his breath again, “Didn’t know you had it in you, Potter, honestly. You barely needed any coaching that time.”
“You ever consider a career in mind-healing?” Ron grinned at her, that lovestruck expression he often wore alighting his features.
for his wand. The bit of holly wood zipped into the kitchen from Merlin-knows-where and settled into Harry’s palm. Harry couldn’t quite remember when he’d last had use for it, as the majority of his magic was wandless these days. Nevertheless, he still preferred to learn new spells wand in hand.
“You still could,” Harry replied, “Despite all the rubbish I used to talk, you are a talented seeker.”
There was no response. Harry tried the door. It wasn’t locked. He entered slowly, giving Tiering time to tell him to fuck off, but he didn’t. The boy looked impossibly small, limbs tucked into himself so he was folded into a small ball leaning against the headboard.
“He’s very protective, your father. But I doubt what I have to share would cause any harm. As you know, all magic deals with intent, but some curses arise involuntarily, perhaps unwillingly, when a particularly powerful practitioner feels very strongly about something, and when they brood over it for a long period of time. I suspect if the Dark Lord had wished to curse the position directly, professors would not last a month in the role. Given that is not the case, and provided that the curse exists at all, I would expect it is a more insidious, noxious thing that hovers in the castle’s magic.”
“No, like everyone else in this damn school, you refuse to acknowledge his existence,” Jamie muttered.
“Never too early to start thinking about my career,” James sniffed. “And I’m decent at potions and they’re useful. I’d feel like I was doing something.”
“I’m not mad you talked to her about it,” Harry replied, “You’re right, you were a kid and you need someone to try to make sense of it all with just as much as I do. I just wasn’t expecting to have my, like, most painful secrets on display like that.”
“Jamie’s just using him to bother me! He doesn’t even like Scor!” Al erupted, freckled face shining red in the candlelight. He all but stamped his foot in his obvious fury, arms crossed over his chest and his chin jutting out indignantly.
“Quite right,” Harry more amicably than he was actually feeling after the late night, “I fancy myself far better than any other wizard who has ever or will ever live and demand special treatment at every opportunity. You’ve found me out, Malfoy, well done you. Now please, eat your banana.”
“No,” Ron said firmly. “I’ll work with George at the shop. It’s doing well and he’ll pay me decent wages.”
“Alright,” Draco considered. “Do you have some sort of an infection or something? Do we need to take you to a healer?”
“Dad!” Al cried, when Harry stepped out of the fireplace. “Jamie says he’s still reading the latest issue of
The threat to Scorpius’ safety was a blow and Draco had to hold back from flinching. “Merlin’s tits, Weasley, this obsessive grudge is pathetic. I’ve apologised. I’ve admitted my wrong-doings. I’m contributing to society. I teach your daughter, for Merlin’s sake. I can’t imagine what it is you want, truly.”
Ron gave a sharp inhale and Hermione pursed her lips, “Whoever it is is still at it, then. What happened?”
“She was trying to get me to shut up about Voldemort’s coming back. She used a...I don't know exactly, an evil, nasty sort of quill.”
“Master is not required to keep Kreacher informed of his comings and goings,” the old elf informed him dourly, “Kreacher knows when children come home from school.”
“Any particular reason we’re heading to potions twenty minutes early?” Harry inquired casually, as he altered his pace to suit Malfoy’s more hesitant gait.
“Never again,” he told Malfoy as they walked back to the castle with several bulky Gladrags bags from the Hogwarts gate, “I feel like I just got hit by a hurricane.”
Harry yawned again and nodded, "Yeah, probably should," he agreed. He gave Clark a final squeeze and then extricated his arm from where it was trapped between Clark’s back and the pillows. "You alright now, sweetheart?" Harry asked him and Clark make a noise to indicate that he was.
“Hm, I think my head is precisely why I should have it,” Draco countered. “Is that what you’re developing premature wrinkles over? Concern for my health?”
Scorpius was confused. Harry sounded so fond, and Father gruffly irritated. Scorpius couldn’t decipher the exchange at all. Father never weathered fools, and he was nearly always sitting with Harry at meals at Hogwarts, so clearly he liked the man, and yet he seemed quite vexed by Harry’s behaviour.
Harry pulled back, observing the lust and desperation smeared over Malfoy's features. Moving quickly, he forced a forearm against Malfoy’s neck, trapping him against the wall. He watched those blue eyes flash dark, pupils dilating, an almost imperceptible nod. Harry pushed just a little harder, curious, the long bone of his arm tilted up at an angle into Draco’s Adam’s apple. He liked the rasping sound Malfoy made with the partial obstruction, perhaps more than he thought he should. Harry tweaked a nipple, cruelly, watching Draco’s pale face twitch in response. The blond lashes closed, as if to savour the sensations without the distractions of sight. It was then that Harry felt the unexpected lurch of Draco’s hips, rutting his full, slender cock against Harry’s body, as if he couldn’t help himself. Harry was painfully hard, too, could swear he’d never been so fucking aroused. It was this overwhelming rush of power and strength and
“Hm,” Harry considered, “Come to think of it, why haven’t we tried to track her down? Her parents obviously were able to, so why couldn’t we? Would give us a better idea of what we’re dealing with. We’re not finding anything in these damn books, anyway. Might as well just go to the source.”
Harry considered her: her fire red hair and her thick braid, her strong and capable hands, and the face he still found so striking and beautiful,  “Sounds like you already know the answer, Gin.”
The sight before them was a bewildering one. The first person Harry saw was Scorpius, his small face flushed and his pupils blown wide, and, most bizarrely of all, Jamie’s hand shoved half-way into his mouth. Jamie was wide-eyed and panicked, clenching Scorpius’ lower jaw. It was not enough to silence Scorpius’ vocalisations, but it was enough to render them unintelligible. Behind them, stood Sterling Main and another Slytherin seventh year, Dermot Mulligan. Their matching glossy hair and wood-framed glasses reflected the moonlight.
“It’s still new,” Draco promised. “I’d probably be just as stunned if I suddenly realised that witches really do it for me. But honestly, Harry. You’re obviously welcome to explore whatever you wish to, but really you’re fine. It may be trite, but I quite like you how you are. I like
Harry kissed the expanse of skin between Draco’s scar and his navel. He drew his thumb along the bottom of his ribcage. It rose and fell with every breath. Draco was warm and alive.
Harry bit his lip. “When the fire was happening it was more important. I was terribly worried about Clark, I couldn’t think of anything else but him. But he’s fine and the rest of the Slytherins are alright, too. But the quidditch situation isn’t fine, and I can't seem to just push past it. I didn’t make the fucking team and I don’t know if it’s because of a lack of skill or because I’m with Draco. I’ve taken this lovely, rosy future I’ve dreamed up and I’ve had to toss it in the bin. What if I can either have Draco or I can have quidditch but I can’t have both?”
Thrilled with the desire lacing Malfoy’s voice, Harry obliged, scraping his teeth over the bared jugular, the ropey muscles, the swell of his trapezius. There, he bit down harder, imagining the neat row of indents he would leave in Malfoy’s skin. A wild, reckless part of him wished he could mark him like that forever. Draco shuddered, crying out.
And they had been: a couple of thrown together eighth year teams, Draco and Harry pitted against each other but with none of the stakes, none of the anger or ego from years past, just good times with mates. It felt great to be on a broom again, scouring the skies for that flash of gold.
there. And you sorted out the full moon business, and Granger and Weasley and the rest took that and ran with it, and now there’s a very solid plan in place. We’re not going to lose anyone today. Least of all, Clark.”
“I’m just curious as to how you developed such empathy for non-magic users when your own experiences with them were so wholly negative?” Tanya asked.
Scorpius knew he wasn’t athletic or gregarious like Jamie, or wickedly bright like Albus or Januarius Boone, but that didn’t mean he needed protecting all the time. “A bit tired is all. Corin Bingham snores like you wouldn’t believe, and it keeps me up all night. I’ve got to readjust, that’s all.”
“Er…” Tanya interrupted before Harry could get to an explanation about the postal service, “We actually don’t love that word.”
“I can go,” Harry offered, “you two can chat and Draco can come meet me at Gladrags, it’s no problem, truly.”
“That’s not a bad way of describing it,” Harry agreed, “My dad, Lupin, Sirius Black, and Peter Pettigrew made it back when they were in school.”
him the whole night long, save the few instances Remy had fussed them both awake. Malfoy had dealt with that, too, squeezing Harry’s shoulder and instructing him to get some rest for once. Harry had accepted both the comfort and the help, sliding back into sleep each time, stirring momentarily when the warmth of Malfoy’s body reappeared along the length of his back.
“Go ask him,” Draco ordered. It was Saturday morning. McGonagall had announced Hogwarts’ endorsement of Ron and Dean’s interhouse Quidditch league earlier that week with some stipulations: each team was required to have an eighth year coach, and at least one player from each house. As this was more a recreational league, and in order to provide more opportunities, students who already played for their house teams were not allowed to apply. Interested students had submitted their names, houses and preferred positions (if any) to a main list, from which the coaches were forming teams. Enthusiasm for the idea seemed high, students' names were pouring in. Clark Tiering, Harry had noticed, without surprise, was not one of those names.
“Hardly a compliment so much as a statement of fact,” Malfoy responded and Harry saw heat rising to Malfoy’s pale cheeks as well. It stirred up something within him, something base and wanting. “Well, this is me,” Malfoy said, stopping and motioning to an open classroom door, “I’ll see you here at half past.”
Once she’d disappeared from view, Harry turned. Draco was standing on the rug, retreating back into himself after his burst of forced pleasantries. Harry knew the other man was drowning in self-blame.
Home at last with time on my hands! Thanks for your patience and a serious thank you for the comments aka my life's blood.
“I hardly know. He’s always been a bit secretive. Lily was the easiest somehow, she got all her feelings out and is back to her usual self, for the most part, although I know she misses her mum sometimes, and she doesn’t understand.”
“So he bought the allergy bit?” Fort prompted over the hum of lunchtime chatter. It was good to be back at school, Jamie thought. It felt normal. He was happy to be back with his housemates and in his dorm, and he wasn’t even fed up with homework yet, despite Professor Malfoy having already demanded an essay on the various antidotes for Tickling Tonic. Fourth year felt more important than third year, somehow, like it was time to start sorting out his future. To hell with what Al said, Jamie was going to make something of himself one day.
"I just...I suspect I might fancy having kids one day," he managed, the words tripping out like a confession.
“But that’s the thing, now, isn’t it?” Harry urged. “You seemed fine, so I assumed you were. And yet Gin seemed happy enough too, and it’s only now I’m realising that I missed probably 99% of her hints. And so I find myself completely doubting whether or not I can correctly, you know, read the room, or what have you. Like, what if you’re pissed and I simply have no idea?”
“What were you going to do with him?” Lily demanded, her eyes bright and her little chin jutting out protectively.
Arrangements were made with Headmistress McGonagall for Harry to Floo back to Hogwarts the following day. She hugged him again before departing, which Harry suspected was more sentimentality than she’d shown in any two hour period in perhaps her whole lifetime. Under another disillusionment charm, Harry was led to a small, neat room with an adjoining bathroom. He undressed and brushed his teeth and sat on the bed. He felt hideously lonely already, wishing he had a Connection Cordial or a mobile or
“That’s not what this is about,” Harry replied in the same gentle tone as before. “I think you know that. Look, love, I can understand if you’ve been hurting since your mother left. I know I’ve been preoccupied with the baby and your sister and my own grief, and I’ve not been there for you in all the ways I would like to have been, and sweetheart, I’m sorry for that, I am. But all this endless squabbling is tearing apart the family we have left. I’m sure it feels justified, but James, all the anger in the world isn’t going to change how things are now. No matter what you fling at me, I can’t make your Mum come back.”
Within an instant, sparkling, golden paths of crowded footsteps appeared throughout the great hall, marking Clark’s comings and goings over the past several months.
“It’s worth researching at the very least,” Hermione agreed. “So let’s do that before we do anything rash.”
“It’s just more of the same,” Harry agreed. “But Clark’s gone and called me a coward and I think he might be right. So I can add letting him down to the list of ways I’m fucking this up.”
“I do, yes,” Malfoy confirmed, “and I expect you could. I shouldn’t think this would come as a surprise, Potter. I thought I had been rather transparent. Does it bother you?”
‘Yes, of course’ is what Harry went to say, but before the words came out, he stopped himself. He raked a hand through his hair and considered it.
is a very particular spell, Harry,” Charlie remarked, almost conversationally, “it requires the caster to have a very earnest desire for, and a very clear sense of, safety. It says something that the place Draco Malfoy’s subconscious feels the safest is with you.”
Malfoy’s gentle mockery continued throughout the meal preparation, but Harry found he didn’t much mind. It was a bit ludicrous that at 38 Harry still wasn’t entirely comfortable in his own kitchen. Having Malfoy there helped distract him from that anxious knot of hypervigilance that occupied the hollow of Harry’s spine whenever he worked in the kitchen, as though Vernon’s palm were to connect with his skull at any moment, or Petunia’s criticisms were to start up in earnest.
Scorpius wanted very badly to roll his eyes, but that was rude and really rather common, so he didn’t. No one would ever say that Al was a ‘good kid,’ when really Al was much closer to chaos incarnate.
From the pocket of his trousers, Clark fished out some folded, smudged parchment, offering it to Harry with a flourish. For a moment, Harry was confused, then recognition set in.
Malfoy was shaking with quiet rage, and Harry felt shame creep down his spine. Of course. It was obtuse of him not to realise that all. Malfoy was right, his father had left him with such a burden.
“Oh, that’s quite changed under my watch,” Penelope assured him. “My daughter Jerica—”she motioned to one of the framed photos behind her, where two girls grinned brightly with their mother’s smile “she’s on the right there, with the curls, researching ancient artifacts in the Americas now, if you would believe it—well, she went through it when she was about James’ age. You wouldn’t have known. Such a bright light, seemed unsinkable, but one night she came to her father and me and admitted that wasn’t the case at all. Well, she’d had us all fooled. Of course Carl and I were overly-focused on our careers at the time, and my mother had passed, and she’d been so good to the girls. Anyway, I thank my stars every day and night she said something. We got her sorted, mind healers and all that, but it felt very touch-and-go for a while. You’ve no idea what a relief it is for me to see her flourishing.
Draco attempted to crawl beneath the covers without disturbing Harry, but it was a fruitless endeavour. One heavy, welcome arm curled round Draco’s midsection, pulling him nearer.
"Yes, I am getting to it. I just don't know how. Fuck. Alright. So. Last night, Clark and I were on the sofa and he was showing me some comic his mate lent him, and he kept inching closer until he was like right next to me and, well, I think he kind of wanted a cuddle.”
Draco swept into the throng. “You!” He shouted, pointing at a wizard with an almost comically large mustache, “Get to St. Mungo’s and let them know to expect a…” he glanced at the unconscious witch on the deck, “twenty-something young woman with expected head injury and possible hypothermia.”
Draco let his pyjama bottoms slide off his hips to pool on the floor. He rested his palms on his lower back and arched, grateful for the return of his confidence now that he was once again in familiar territory.
“It is,” Bingham agreed with an emphatic nod. “They’ve a team of sprites who put on the most epic light show—”
“What the fuck do I do?” Harry whispered, putting his glasses back on and blinking helplessly at them.
not be pleased with this ridiculous quarrel, but he couldn’t help himself. The Weasel was being just an irritating, petty fool, determined to misjudge Draco’s intentions. Well, Draco wouldn’t stand for being defamed like this, not when he’d not done a bloody thing to deserve it in two long decades.
Harry looked saddened for a moment, as though the thought of his children growing up was physically painful to him. Then he just smiled. “Sorry, love. Have I missed the show?”
“You’re wrong there, Weasley,” Malfoy was saying, his tone slightly less patronizing than usual, “Ryan would be useless without Quigley, Ireland’s strength is symbiosis, not a fixation with quidditch celebrities. Quigley’s flashy but Ryan’s stalwart.”
Harry laughed, “No, that one was born of the moment. I just thought...you like being held down, I like having my cock sucked. Best of both worlds.”
Between Harry’s lips, Malfoy seemed to grow impossibly harder and the sounds he made as he tossed his head left Harry feeling reckless and mighty. He increased the pressure and pace until he sensed the muscles in Draco’s abdomen tightening in anticipation.
article was released. Harry cringed nearly as violently as Ron did when Hermione dropped the issue in front of their breakfast plates. Harry had felt terribly awkward during the photoshoot, but the editorial staff had somehow managed to disguise that. In the photo, he and Draco were clasping hands and giving one another tender looks. They were dressed in non-threatening jumpers of Gryffindor scarlet and Slytherin green. It looked very much like a sequence from a holiday made-for-television film.
“Nothing,” Jamie said quickly. “I was just pissed at Al, but it’s whatever, I’m over it. I’m sorry.”
“I wish you wouldn’t,” Harry grumbled embarrassedly. He took a gulp of his beer, shifting uncomfortably.
“Er, hello.” Harry gave an awkward little wave. “Ah, just wondering, would it be possible to have this—” he motioned to a basic cot beside him, “delivered?”
“Time for a demonstration,” Malfoy announced, “Potter here will try to get inside my brain, and I will reject him. Typically I would do this without my wand, but for your sake, Tiering, I will use incantation and the hand movements you have just practiced.”
“Keep scowling and that,” Draco pressed a fingertip between his own eyebrows to demonstrate, “will become permanent.”
One of the dormitories ahead of him, still untouched by the fire, burst open, and Marcia Awling and the other seventh year girls spilled out, looking distressed and disoriented.
“You’ll do no such thing!” Molly insisted. “I want them here. All of them, Teddy too. He’s not getting out of seeing his old Granny. And your timing is excellent, really. Percy and Ralph will be here the day after next with their girls. You know how Lily idolises Molly and Lucy, and how they adore her right back. No, it will be a lovely, bustling full house, just how I like it. And what’s more, Harry dear, I expect you need a break: some time to get your ducks in a row. Of course you’re welcome here, too, if you like, but I feel like a bit of solitude might do you good.”
Draco felt the wicked grin against his chest as the first tendrils of Harry’s magic started creeping round him.
“Lovely,” Harry smiled, “Thanks.” He gave Hiram and Raoul a broad, reassuring grin, and set off for the dungeons.
“Yes, Harry,” breathed Malfoy, eyes not leaving his. His cloak folder over the stone table, Draco next removed his jumper. He was about to toss it to the floor when Harry interrupted him.
Only silence greeted Harry this time. He walked through it, his appetite gone. All he could do was hope that it had been enough.
“He has,” Harry swallowed. Firing up the oven, he felt a blush rising along his neck which had nothing to do with the glowing element before him. He tugged at his collar. “Draco’s, er, spent some time here. Just helping out, you know. And he’s the boys’ professor. I’m sure he’s told them off just as often as I have, nothing new there.”
Remy didn’t need another bottle, and everybody knew it. Harry hid out in the kitchen for a little while, doing the dishes by hand and trying to ignore the fact that he was still bloody crying. His glasses were foggy and his nose was stuffed and he felt like a right mess.
“I thought it was my only chance,” Draco murmured, his voice close enough for the words to caress the skin of Harry’s neck as he spoke them. “I knew once we left Hogwarts that would be it. We wouldn’t be in each other’s lives. I didn't have much time, only this year. I didn't have time to court you properly, so I had to expedite things. This seemed, at the time, like an acceptable option."
Draco heard Potter shuffle into the kitchen, greeting the baby with a “Hello, little chappy. Catch any sprites yet?” The man yawned and looked about, blinking at the sparkling kitchen. “You really don’t have to keep cleaning up after me, not that I don’t appreciate it.”
“You can’t be serious,” Draco knew he was gaping like a damn codfish but Potter couldn’t truly be this thick, could he?
The oxygen in the room seemed to disappear entirely. Harry was pinned in place beneath that determined stare. Draco spoke the truth, it was unmistakable.
. Harry held up a hand to stop her protests. “Awling is committed, hard-working, and sharp. She’s got the tactical mind necessary for the game and I trust her to make the Wyverns a strong and cohesive team next year. I’m only sorry I won’t be here to see you play under her direction. Anyway, I’m immensely proud of each and every one of you." He paused, looking around at the earnest faces. He'd miss them. He let his serious tone disperse into one of levity. "Usually, I’m all about the love of the sport, but I’ll admit, for personal reasons, I would really love to to win this one. That being said, I want clean, fair play, and no messing about out there. Stay focused, don’t get drawn in to their team dynamics. Let’s make this final game something to be proud of!”
For a moment, Harry stood there, frozen, hearing the murmurs begin almost at once: the stares and the hurried whispers, the press of so many eyes. And yet, the only eyes Harry cared about, he realised, were the haughty, familiar grey ones right in front of him.
“That is something I cannot relate to,” Jamie joked. “I love winning. But I won’t make it a contest, I promise. Just an easy fly over the lake or something. You have a broom of your own, right?”
Pansy only smiled. “Yes, darling, but we’re hardly the same. I’m alone because I love it. You’re alone because you feel you somehow deserve it.”
“You’re doing it again,” Ginny rebuked. “I know this is hard for you to believe, Harry, but you don’t, in fact, have to spearhead every project. Have a little trust, would you?”
“Ready to go down now?” Harry asked but Jared clung harder and shook his head. Harry chuckled. “Merlin, you’re getting big for this. Let’s find a chair, how ‘bout?”
George cackled while Ron muttered, “Harry, then, since he’s the only one here not a blood relative. Though I suspect laying one on him might get me killed.”
“I...I don’t know,” Draco admitted, feeling another jab of irritation like he used to back when they were in school. Decisions had always seemed to come so easily to Potter: The righteous path was never shrouded in doubt for The Boy Who Lived. “I suppose you think I should. It’s the noble thing to do.”
“Of course not. I’m hanging on your every word,” she promised, flagging down a server and ordering some sugar-laden frou-frou drink. “Tell me everything.”
“The way you indulge that elf,” Malfoy shook his head, squeezing Harry's hand and glancing down to where their palms met around the key. His expression changed to one Harry couldn't quite interpret. "Potter, your watch."
Harry sat up properly out of curiosity, reaching out reflexively to catch a small black box about the size of a fist that Draco tossed his way.
are, the most extraordinary wizard of our times, your own professorship all but falling in your lap, and what’s more a celebrity, a figurehead, just desperate for normalcy.”
“No,” Harry agreed, relieved and smilling, “you’re definitely not that. Come here.” He drew Malfoy in kissing him soundly, “You’re fucking unbelievable.”
Clark didn’t look at him, just dropped his eyes and started flipping through the pages of the ‘zine. Harry felt his heart clench, certain he’d messed it all up.
Harry ignored the quivering lip of the child, which he suspected was what Clark wanted. Tiering reached for a toffee and shoved it in his mouth, his hands in his pockets.
“And that was just in Hogsmeade,” Draco smiled cruelly, “just wait until I get you somewhere with actual selection. Merlin, Potter, you won’t recognise yourself.”
Harry appraised them, he could feel their giddy energy, knowing they had talked themselves into coming over here. He knew he shouldn’t be irritable with them, they were just kids and their intentions seemed genuine enough.
Scorpius sighed. That was likely at least partially true. What if right this very moment Father was deciding Scorpius was too much of a liability to be kept in school?
Harry opened his mouth to protest and shut it again. He didn’t want to admit it, but Malfoy was probably right. Teams had to care about more than skills to sell tickets.
"That's one way of putting it," Malfoy laughed humourlessly, "or as my father would say, a mincing, intolerable little ponce. Ah, well, six of one, half dozen of the other."
“Not great?” Ron gulped. “I guess that’s one way to put a purposeful injury used to manipulate you into caring for him.”
An icy, panicky fist gripped Draco’s stomach and he stood there frozen and resisting. There was only one chair. Harry clearly meant for Draco to sit on his knee.
do anything. Plenty of couples weather all sorts of breaches of trust, if that is what they want to do. There's no playbook for this sort of thing. Is it the lying that bothers you?” Zerk asked, curious.
“It hasn’t happened again, and I don’t fancy anyone digging around in my head,” Clark was saying, leaned up against the wall just outside the great hall where Harry had stopped him. This time, Harry had brought Draco as back-up, which had taken some convincing on its own:
This was a not a first kiss, he realised. It was easy, comfortable, Seamus even copping a feel of Dean’s arse before getting shoved off with a laugh, and just like that, the two were bounding back toward the goal.
Draco’s mother shook her head, “I don’t think that’s wholly so, but I can understand why you would feel that way.”
Draco traced a knuckle along the ridge of Harry’s jaw, stopping beneath his chin. He tilted Harry’s face upwards, until Harry felt obliged to meet his eyes. “Don’t I?”
“I think,” Clark answered with a hint of amusement, “we’ve found we don’t get on quite as well without you, Harry.”
“No, Fife, you absolute muttonhead. Because they’re ignorant and they make no one want to be your friend!” Scorpius informed him sharply.
Gahhh I love all you fellow Hermione stans, just thrills me to pieces. Thanks for your lovely, supportive comments!  I wasn't intending Christmas break to be one million chapters, but I can't help but be precious about everything, so guess it will be, thanks to who I am as a person.
“Right. I don’t see what that has to do with me?” Harry replied obstinately, leaning back against the kitchen counter, arms crossed. He could feel a headache pricking at his temples. Lovely.
“I think maybe to me it does," Harry considered, "I want him to agree with me because he sits down and has a think and realises I’m in the right.”
Thankfully, Harry didn’t seem to mind. “Hell yes, sweetheart. You were incredible, so fucking good. And when you—shit, I didn’t even know that was a thing. I didn’t lay a hand on you. Seriously brilliant.”
Draco leaned in closer, letting his head fall onto Harry’s shoulder, “I’m sorry I called you a sanctimonious prick.”
Harry had been so caught up in the new, hopeful feeling that he’d failed to register the footsteps in the hall, or the shift of Draco’s gaze.
Harry hooked his little finger round the tang and set to work. It was an oddly meditative task, dragging the edge gently along the grain of Draco’s stubble, from the plane in front of his ear to his elegant jawline. Harry worked carefully, studiously, mapping the specific geometry of Draco’s features as though he could secure them in his memory. He propped a thumb under the other boy’s chin, tilting it upwards. The familiar rush of power he always got when Draco was all subdued and docile emerged and Harry savoured the rolling pleasure of it. The sharpness of the blade contrasted against the human frailty of Draco’s neck, and Harry thought of how easily he could draw blood, or worse, and here was Draco, trusting him anyway. Draco's breath hitched as Harry slid the razor over the swell of his Adam’s apple, but he stayed perfectly still.
Fife pursed his lips, hating to be disobeyed, but refused to acknowledge Al’s facetiousness otherwise.
Draco could tell the boy thought he was pretty clever to come up with this theory, and that stating it aloud made him feel bold and brave. Draco chuckled quietly.
“You know.” Scorpius retorted. “He wouldn’t be so mad about us being friends if you two got along in the first place. You could make an effort to be kind instead of needling him when he’s already got detention.”
Everything was dark and green and rushing when Jared awoke. He was frightened and someone was holding him. He was about to scream when they lurched forward into the drawing room of Number 12, Grimmauld Place. They had traveled by fire. Jared hated when they traveled by fire. The first time he’d cried for ages and Harry had said he’d not have to do it again.
Harry gave a watery smile. “Thanks. Erm, I’m going to be late for class, but I want to get it out first thing. Will you tell Professor McGonagall I'll be along shortly?”
Draco’s only response was to snake an arm around Harry’s waist, burying himself impossibly deeper into Harry’s torso.
“Yes, but for how long?” Draco knew his voice sounded too high and tinny, he felt panic rising and he didn’t know if he wanted Potter to push him from the bed or draw him impossibly near. “When your wife shows up again—”
Draco didn’t answer, just bounced Remy in his arms, smiling sweetly at the redheaded baby. It was a possessive, meaningful gesture that even Ron—who sometimes didn’t pick up on things left unspoken—couldn’t fail to understand. He made a noise that sounded a bit like a growl.
"Hm, I see what you mean," Pansy replied. "Although I would posit that could be because you've yet to really try it. Potter’s the earnest sort, and loyal, from what I know of the man. He could be just the thing. When do you see him again?”
“When I was young,” Draco confessed, “I used to fantasise you’d become terribly homely. I had dreams that puberty would absolutely
“That and I said, maybe words that felt so physical weren’t the best idea,” Scorpius inserted. “I didn’t want my brain to get sliced open or anything.”
“What I want,” Hermione clipped, “is for nothing you say to be misinterpreted and used against you. Now, other suggestions: slight PDA is encouraged, but don’t overdo it. No kissing on the mouth, remember: we’re easing people into this, we have to start slow. I think it’s best if Harry foots the bill, but Draco, pretend to have ordered the dessert beforehand—don’t worry, I’ve already arranged it. Harry, act surprised when it arrives. Don’t exchange gifts at the table, but thank each other for the thoughtful gifts given earlier, without revealing what they were. There’s too much room for misinterpretation of gifts, and again, we want to avoid Draco looking like he is buying Harry’s affection.”
“Me too,” Harry confessed, “I haven’t even RSVP’d yet. I...I thought about just not going. Throwing the thing in the fire and pretending I'd never seen it.”
“Headmistress Clearwater has extended me an offer. To teach. It would mean Lily and Remy and I moving to Hogsmeade, and Merlin knows you and Al would grow sick of me being there all the time, having to endure me as your professor, and waiting for me to inevitably slip up and call you sweetheart in front of your friends. But you’d see me every day, could come visit Lily and the baby on Hogsmeade’s weekends and holidays, and I could come to your games. It would be a big change and it’s not on your shoulders to decide, of course; we’d need to talk about it as a family, but it’s an option, something we can discuss…if that would make things better? Or maybe not, I don’t know—”
“I know what you mean,” Harry sympathised, “think I might go get a couple more hours sleep. Bunch of us are heading to Hogsmeade for brunch, later, though, you coming?”
Despite Draco’s misgivings and the shadow of the mess that was yesterday still looming over him, the morning went fairly smoothly.
Tiering gave an emphatic nod and Harry recast, arriving into the same scene. There was vomit on Clark’s mother’s blouse.
“Okay, well, I sort of fiddled with that spell. Teddy left one of his Magical Theory books here over break and I’ve been studying it. It said that making a new spell was tricky, but changing a known spell wasn’t quite so complex. And before you lecture me, I know we’re not supposed to be doing magic over the holidays but no one ever says anything if it’s in a wizarding home. Jamie summons his broom all the time, and you’ve never said anything.”
“I asked for a massage, Potter, not a chat,” Malfoy informed him, then groaned as Harry’s hands reached the hardened muscles of trapezius. Too much studying, Harry thought, Draco was hunched over books day and night, lately.
Walburga’s rage overwhelmed her, she burst forward against her frame, an ugly, blotchy red colouring her fine features, her face distorted with a furious passion. For a moment, Harry thought the strength of her emotion might make her materialise, spring forth from the afterlife into the decaying halls of Grimmauld Place.
“Oh fuck off!” Harry said. “Both of you! I’m done. You do realise the whole school has been searching for you for 24 hours? I’m exhausted and I’m fucking hungry and I’m not bloody dealing with this. McGonagall can take care of this mess. I’m going to bed.”
“Right,” Harry agreed, “Well, er, thanks for the tea, delicious crumpets, truly,” Merlin, what was wrong with him, “‘Til tomorrow then.”
“Jamie,” he began, keeping his voice steady and low, “this has to stop.” Harry furrowed his brows as he turned to face his eldest child. The explosive rage he’d felt moments earlier had wilted into exhaustion. “Can you please just tell me what is going on with you so I can figure out how to help?”
Draco sniffed despondently. Harry tapped the other boy’s jaw with a finger so he’d turn his head and look at him. “Can you do something for me now? One last thing?”
The professor nodded, “The second year boys were across the hall, and it was the same story. They will be seen to. Let’s get them up to the great hall.”
“Oh no, I couldn’t be trusted to do that properly," Draco muttered darkly, "Father sent someone in to take care of that.”
"Shut it, Potter," Draco informed him, "If you think I'm not still furious, you've got another thing coming."
Harry thought about the quidditch letter tucked in his pocket. He thought about how quickly they would retract their offer should it come out that Harry was snogging Draco Malfoy. The thought settled like cold lead in his belly. Maybe he’d forget all about it; fuck quidditch, he’d take Draco any day.
“I’ve taught a lot of students,” Draco informed him. “And more or less, they mostly come out alright in the end. If I was redeemable, with my parents being the cold, unfeeling sycophants they were, I’m certain your children will turn out fine.”
“Er, right,” Harry replied, not sure how he felt about being spoken to in such a way in his own damn home. Then again, he wasn’t serving beans on toast, and Jamie wasn’t whinging endlessly and
“Well, Potter,” Draco said coolly, “Are we going to have it out, or are you just going to continue snipe at me until you’ve recovered from this tiresome little snit?”
Draco rose, hand not leaving Harry’s back. When he spoke, his voice was ice cold and fierce. “Unfortunately, there is a well-established pattern of people putting their grand causes before Harry’s wellbeing. Even people who purport to care for him. Tanya's just added her name to a thoughtless, cruel list.”
Harry commenced his duties immediately, stroking the fine hair, running fingertips over Draco’s scalp. He loved Draco like this, demanding and affection-seeking.
Harry was standing outside Flourish and Blotts sorting out a bottle for Remy, when Lily sprinted out the door of the shop, grinning wildly. Jamie, Al and the Malfoys followed along behind her
“Speak for yourself,” groused Draco from under the bedspread, “I’m going back to sleep until I forget this entire exchange ever happened.”
“Ghosts can’t do magic,” Draco assured him. “And that’s what she is now, I’m certain of it. Also, will you mind terribly if I write all this up for academic purposes? I think it might look good for future employers. No one’s ever documented defeating a cwalus before.”
.” The box shone purple for a brief moment, the seal between the two halves disappearing entirely. “Should misfortune come to your belongings, the Appleby Arrows takes responsibility for the replacement or recuperation of said items,” she explained.
Maybe Harry was being selfish again. Would it be better for his family if he just accepted the damn thing? But what kind of parent could he be if he was burdened with all those too-potent memories day after day, the bloody battle and all the fallen still lingering in every corridor? Besides, taking the position would throw a spanner in the works of the whatever-it-was Harry was pursuing with Draco—not that Harry should even be prioritizing that right now. Silently, he berated himself.
Draco turned away from the bewildering machines to give the child a concerned glance. He felt suddenly like he ought to fix this, but Draco didn't have a lot of experience in
Draco nodded hesitantly, knowing there was no way Harry was letting him off with that little effort.
“It seems there is a change of plans. Two of our students, a fourth year Gryffindor named Karanjeet Atwal and a first year named Clark Tiering, a Slytherin. If you believe you know one of these two boys well enough to identify please stand.” The headmistress divided the students into twelve groups accordingly, assigning each group a different part of the castle to search. “I will inform Professor Haberdash-Pewter not to expect you for your next class,” she assured the eighth years, and their Slytherin tag-alongs, and they set off.
Harry hurried to unravel the bit of parchment fastened near Metatron’s not unimposing talons and read:
"What is it, Potter?" Malfoy yawned, arm creeping around Harry's waist. "I can tell you're letting some ridiculous idea or another worry away at your brain. It's no wonder you never learned Occlumency; I'm surprised they even tried with you."
“Not me,” Harry said. “I’m quite sure. He has said he sees us like teachers, but he does hero worship Draco a bit. It’s eased off, now that they’re closer, but I think it’s still there. If it’s romantic or something, I couldn’t say.”
“You know, Tiering,” Malfoy drawled, and Harry tensed, hoping Draco wasn’t going to go and say something horrible.
Harry thought that must have been hard. One more secret Draco had been attempting to contend with. “Because of your parents?”
"You do realise you've gone from one night of cuddling to imagining a future with the man," Pansy noted. "You don't think that's a bit much?"
“Oh, Harry!” Hermione bemoaned, covering her head from the onslaught, and shouting to be heard among the rumbling, mass flap of wings, “I thought you had this sorted!”
Draco examined the other man. Potter was still a mess, his hair flattened to his skull on one side, and its typical gravity-defying shaggy mess on the other. He was wearing only boxer shorts and a faded Chudley Cannons T-shirt, and sleep was still crusting in the corner of one of his eyes. He looked a bit like an overgrown boy, not much changed by the years, except for taking up so much more space. Draco never felt like his own body had filled out quite as he expected it to, but Potter was bigger and broader in every sense. He wasn’t a bear of a man, not like Greg Goyle, but nevertheless his thick, exposed limbs looked intriguingly capable.  Draco had to look away, although he supposed it was pointless denying his attraction at this point, at least to himself.
Jamie laughed. “I’ll teach you a spell for that. Clovis Dawe is louder than thunder, but now all the blokes in our room know the Snore Silencer Charm.”
Harry paused, biting back the 'of course' that manifested on the tip of his tongue. Three weeks ago, he might have wanted to believe that dream. Then, he would have taken Ginny back the moment she walked through the door with nothing but tearful apologies. Something had shifted recently, however, and Harry realised that that certainty had wavered.
“I...I don’t know what to say,” he admitted, as they turned to observe him. “I should have helped. You’ve all done an incredible job of this. Thank you, truly.”
“Harry,” Draco reprimanded, and Harry’s eyes jumped to Draco’s icy grey ones. “That is exactly what you and Longbottom did.”
Harry and Draco stood outside the phone box waiting for Clark to make the call. They both knew before he exited that it wasn’t good news. Or, rather, it wasn’t any news at all.
Harry himself was significantly less convinced. Indeed, the unflagging humdrum of his office life seemed almost enviable now, when compared to this vast unknown. Harry could handle his own children, certainly, but a whole class worth? Fourteen classes worth? How did he make them listen? How did he reprimand them for speaking out of turn? How did one even begin to formulate a lesson plan?
“Well, that’s good then,” he said brightly, and resumed petting Draco as though he were some overgrown housecat. Draco attempted to summon the energy to be irritated. He wanted to bristle, to regret this. It was too unwieldy, there was too much room for complication, it could all break so very badly. But Potter’s hand was steady and warm, offering reassurance. Potter clearly could fall into this thing as though there were nothing so easy in the world.
.” The words popped out of Harry's mouth in a fit of self-deprecating exasperation but Draco froze, the precious pink of his blush spreading high over his cheekbones.
“Shouldn’t be looking at homework over the break,” Harry scolded, darting in to press a kiss to the exposed skin of Draco’s neck.
“Less apologizing, more slicing,” Malfoy commanded, but, ever so slightly, Harry felt the muscles under his hand begin to uncoil.
“Very well,” Malfoy announced, conclusion reached through some reasoning Harry couldn't hope to parse. He held out a small phial to Harry. “Scorpius has a medical condition. Please ensure he gets a drop of this under his tongue every evening.”
“Wyverns,” Harry informed him, taking the seat Ron had saved for him. He looked out over the pitch to see the game was unexpectedly well-attended,  “Not a bad turn out for a rec match,” he noted.
“I think you’re sick,” Lily decided, clearly not listening. “Jamie and Al are never home from school like this.”
“You son’s right,” Malfoy concluded softly. The previous anger had been replaced with a tentative consideration. “I’m sure we can settle this matter like adults. I cannot begrudge you your concern for my child’s welfare, Potter, but I assure you: you are quite mistaken as to my intentions.”
“Forgets the rest of the world wasn’t born into the goddamn wizarding aristocracy that nobody actually seems to know anything about, and might as well be the bloody Illuminati?”
“The optics are poor, me living alone here, like Clark pointed out: all this space, the antiques, the artefacts. There’s been some talk, well, more than talk, really, we’ve taken steps—with your permission of course, Draco, darling, since the property naturally falls to you—but we’d like to turn the place into a memorial museum. For a fee, people could come explore the house and grounds. Proceeds not going to upkeep would then go to the foundation. The family quarters would be closed to the public, mind you, and nothing is set in stone, but I’d like to hear what you think. I would set up parcels of land for you and Harry and the boys to hold in trust, it goes without saying. I want you each to have a bit of a nest egg.”
Harry put away his quill and gathered his school books for the day. He then poked his head inside his own bed curtains.
Potter’s shuffling stance gave away his reticence, but Granger-Weasley wasn’t having it. She gave Potter a reproachful look.
Al didn’t see how a creature the size of a dragonfly could lift a Knut, let alone a Galleon, and he was about to say as much when one sprite shot away from the group to sink two tiny teeth into Fife’s ear lobe.
“I suspect it was intense between us, as you say, because I was a brainwashed little bigot and a bully. I was hideously jealous that Potter was some sort of chosen one, when I wasn't. I should hope that after twenty years I’ve grown out of being an insecure cretin, but thanks for that particular vote of confidence.”
like it. I find it...satisfying. Oh, Merlin, that sounds filthy, I don’t mean anything like that. It’s like...emotionally speaking. I just...really like it. Fuck, I don’t know what I mean.”
“You don’t,” it was Molly Weasley who spoke this time, her voice cracking. “Harry, this is your home, you don’t have to leave.”
“Clark, love, is that you?” The voice was familiar as Harry had heard it many times in the boy’s memories.
Harry knocked at Clark’s door. Hermione and Ron had left for The Burrow, promising to see him and Draco that night at the pub. Kreacher was cooking what smelled like a rather heavenly roast. Harry thought he might just have to have Draco come round more often, if this was the treatment he was going to receive.
“It’s a start,” Hermione agreed, “If we saw them wandering around after construction had ceased for the evening, that would be a pretty significant clue.”
“Boys, that’s enough,” Harry said sternly. He was relieved he was able to keep from shouting again. “A bottle. Please.”
Before Harry could find more words or step in to embrace her, there came the yelling of children, the clambering of footsteps and a girl’s cries filling the dining room, and Ron’s frantic bellow: “Get the hell away from her!”
Clark gave a non-committal roll of his shoulders, “You’ve seen the worst of it,” he said, “but there’s normal times, too. So hopefully we’re more on that end of things.”
“I know you did. I just...I want you to stay here at home, not go to Hogwarts.” Lily whispered. “Bad things happened when you were there.”
“Far enough away that when you bend over only your hands and head touch the bed,” Harry went on. Draco fell into place, bowing at the waist and bracing his head in his arms on Harry’s homey eiderdown. “That’s it. Feet apart. Lovely.”
“And I’ve been stuck on you since puberty, much to my dismay,” Draco replied, “not to mention I’ve likely been exposed to anything you might have. Which is nothing since we were both painfully virginal setting out. So, I think we’re safe to do without? Do you think? Unless circumstances change?”
“Teddy!” Harry breathed, his adrenaline spike dissipating. He looked helplessly up at the tall, lean young man, whose long, dirty blond hair was pulled back into an effortless knot at the back of his head. “I didn’t know you were coming today.”
Not knowing what else to do, the students, murmuring in shock and excited, accepted Draco’s authority. They staggered themselves around the house tables, pushing in benches as necessary. Karanjeet hauled Clark into line and Draco amplified his voice with a
Draco cowered in close, his forehead leaning into Harry’s thigh, pressing small kisses to his quad before looking back up at him.
The little verbal tic was clearly adopted from Potter’s boys, and Draco tried not to be irritated by it.
“Many apologies, Master,” Kreacher said, bowing deeply so that he disappeared from Harry's line of vision and then bobbed back up, “but Master has visitors.”
Atwal was a decent bloke, Harry knew, although he’d not even know the boy was in the DA. Again, he felt a pang of regret at not keeping up this responsibility. He scuffed the toe of his trainer on the stone, trying to think of something to say.
“And I really am sure that once you’re back at school, your friends will be happy to see you. It really has only been a few weeks. But like I was saying, you made loads of friends and Al...Al’s never been like that. He was always a bit more of a loner. You know, he’s wonderful, but he’s intense, he’s particular, he gets lost in his own world. Maybe he feels jealous of you getting friendly with Scorpius.”
“Merlin, Harry,” Hermione gasped, “You’re right. I didn’t believe they existed. Professor Binns said Ms. Bloodstone was really out to lunch for believing in them; and he’s a ghost, he should know.”
Harry, despite his reservations, had agreed to let Draco to take the lead on things—”but only if you at least try to be nice,” he’d argued, to which Malfoy had archly replied that he would “be fair.”
“You've nothing to be embarrassed of,” Harry tried to reassure him, standing up. Malfoy followed suit and Harry was surprised when Draco let himself be led by the hand like a child, “I was all weepy earlier, remember? Hermione likes to warn me that alcohol and war memories are ‘a coping mechanism, but not necessarily the healthiest one.’ Never quite know which way the evening might take you, do you? But believe me, I’ve been there, okay?”
Lily looked momentarily disappointed at not getting to show off her father-rousing skills, but then shrugged.
Draco tried not to marvel aloud at the child’s intuition for magic. How had he missed it this past year? It must only be fully tangible when coupled with Albus’ peculiar fascinations. The immeasurable brilliance reminded Draco very suddenly and painfully of the boy’s namesake. Draco himself had quite a lot of uses for Albus’ discovery, he realised dryly. He wouldn’t dare, of course, but blast it if the idea wasn’t tempting.
The social services witch, Ms. Provencal, or, more accurately, her head, bobbed in the green flames of the sitting room.
Harry eased back, his softening cock tugging free of Draco’s arse. He propped himself up on one elbow, peering over Draco’s shoulder so he could see his face in profile.
“Clark?” Harry called out quietly from the closed door. He heard the muffled sobs stop suddenly. He knocked softly, “Can I come in?”
So with a lot of regret, I have had to close comments from non-users. This was just supposed to be a fun quarantine project to keep me occupied, but unfortunately, I've been getting some pretty vitriolic comments and it feels bad.  I used to be excited about posting new chapters and now I find myself dreading it, and I don't want to feel like that. This is just a bit of escapist drabble and was never intended to get people all up in arms.
Harry gave a tired groan. “For goodness sake. And am I supposed to trust you won’t pull something like this again? How can I when the ethics of your actions depend simply on me not finding out?” He yanked off his glasses and tossed them onto the bedside table. He flopped on his back and pressed the heels of his palms into his eyes. He didn't want to see Draco's stricken face the moment he pulled away. His thoughts went round and round.
“I don’t know,” Draco replied, doing his best to seem cavalier. “The courts, of course, were told some version of the truth and as such awarded me custody. After that, I made her forget about Scorpius’ illness: I plucked every last tendril of it from her memory myself. Of course, now she thinks I’m keeping him from her out of a sense of my own superiority and the resulting judgmental spite. I’ve told her she is welcome to see him should she leave off on her dependence to potions, but she declares she cannot so long as I am keeping her child from her.”
“Very well,” Harry consented, but turned to Draco, concern rising, “Does that work for you? You’ll be the most-likely target.”
“Hardly!” Harry hastened to assure him. “It’s all come together only within the last few days. I wouldn’t leave you in the dark like that; this was a very last minute decision.”
Harry was just sorting himself for bed when he heard the screams coming from Albus’ room. He raced down the hall, and burst through the door, wand at the ready. Al flew to him, curling into his side. Scorpius was trying to flatten himself against the wall alongside the little cot Harry had transfigured into Al’s room, whimpering. He was staring ahead at something Harry couldn’t see.
Draco looked at him like he was Christmas come early, “Harry, I think that’s the most perfect thing you’ve ever said to me.”
“Scorpius and I looked you up in the library last year,” Al confessed. Scorpius emitted a tiny, miserable moan and looked down at his plate, flushing.
“I’ve news,” he smiled, once he felt he could speak without his voice breaking. “Your mum, she’s okay.”
For another moment, he was met with nothing but Draco’s silence. Then, Draco gave a long-suffering sigh. “You never make anything easy, do you, Potter? Stop squirming, it’s unbecoming. Sit down. I’ll get us some tea.”
“Maybe don’t talk about what you don’t understand,” Draco replied, icily. “That way you might actually shut up for once.” His hand swept over Harry’s arm to land on the small of his back, coaxing him away. “Come,” he said. “We’ll just have to keep looking.”
“Harry, if you would be so kind as to release my husband before he suffocates, I would truly appreciate it. And then perhaps you could see to Remy and help the professor to his feet?” Hermione continued her crisp, rapid-fire directions. Her voice was sharp and clear as it rang through the air to bring order to the pandemonium.
Harry paused for a moment, enjoying the feeling of the Draco’s body trapped beneath his own, examining the picture before him. Malfoy’s eyes intent on his, rounded lips parted with desire. He looked small like this, almost fragile, and Harry found that he liked that. It gave him a heady rush of power. That Malfoy wanted it, wanted
“Perfectly. Come on, why don’t we all get some breakfast,” Harry suggested. “Then we’ll make a decision from there.”
“Well,” Harry started, trying desperately to think of something light and meaningless to say, but Jamie didn’t let him.
Draco hmm’ed under his breath, less than thrilled at the idea of Albus Potter’s untried magic interfering with Scorpius’ mind.
Harry was taken aback, it all suddenly felt less like a game and more like something important. Something he needed to do for the other boy, and what's more he wanted to. It felt like an inseverable tether between them.
“C’mere,” Harry muttered, shucking off his pants and trousers then groping for Draco’s arm and yanking him, unresisting, upwards. Harry kissed that gorgeous, filthy mouth, then collapsed backwards onto the unused bed, pulling Draco with him. “You’re fucking unbelievable, you know that? Amazing, bloody perfect.”
“Sh-she said she’d be there. God, I'm so stupid, I can't believe I still get upset when she lets me down. I never fucking learn,” whimpered Clark and apparently that was about all the restraint the poor kid had left because he was sobbing in earnest again. Harry wrapped an arm around his shoulders and Clark allowed himself to be drawn in for a hug, weeping into Harry’s jumper. Harry patted the boy’s back and made what he hoped were kind and comforting sorts of noises.
“His aunt Daphne should be returning home from her holidays any day now. I could probably arrange for her to look after him for an evening.”
“What if I’m not?” Potter blurted out. He seemed both shocked and horrified at the very words flying out of his mouth, but also powerless to stop them.
Harry bit his lip. Maybe Draco was right. He would have told Clark whatever he wanted to know because that was just his response to questions he knew the answer to. And then he'd be yolked to that creeping sadness that would more likely than not spoil his day, like it spoiled so many days, especially in the summer. Maybe it was alright to only talk about these things on his own terms.
“Maybe she did, but I’m not so sure. It’s complicated. I understand where she is coming from but I’m not at all convinced she’d done the right thing here, certainly not when it comes to the children. But that’s on her, not you. When it comes to you, no one is feeling anything but helpless, because we care for you and we care for the kids and we miss you.”
“Preying on him when he’s fucking vulnerable. Insinuating yourself into his life. Caring for his kids—”
“Everyone’s fed and clothed and has all their limbs, Potter,” Draco reminded him. “You’re getting by.”
“Why Professor,” Draco murmured facetiously, keeping his voice low enough that Harry would have to lean in to catch the words, “am I in for a scolding?”
Professor McGonagall, Ron, and Hermione leaned in, skimming the passage. A bloody death, metaphysical means, repeating violent ends, it all fit.
Malfoy sat up, looking hazily around the room, obviously not exactly sober himself. Pansy then gave him a bit of a shove, knocking him into Harry’s lap, instead.
Harry flushed harder. “A bit, yeah.” Before Harry could rush in with reassurances about it just being a passing thing and not anything like his feels towards Draco, he was silenced with an amused kiss.
Draco snorted, but held out a hand. “Yes, yes, we’d hate for you to feel left out. Better climb up here then.”
Draco crossed his legs and continued. He tried to be objective in his telling, to suppress the anger and frustration that he knew came across less than admirable. “Astoria’s anxiety grew. To cope, she turned to potions promising euphoria. It was her life, I told myself. That was the agreement, it was hardly my business. So long as I didn’t feel it was affecting her ability to care for my son, I stayed out of it. In retrospect, this was likely the wrong decision. Had I reached out, had we forged more of a connection, even one of friendship, it might have helped—or it might have hurt. Astoria is a very proud woman. She never took kindly to being told what to do, and any comments on my part were met with derision and scorn.
No one said anything. Harry stepped away from the warmth and comfort of Arthur’s hands, clicking at Constance.
“As you’ve no doubt discerned,” Professor McGonagall started, “Wilma Brown does indeed seem to be at the centre of this whole ordeal.”
Draco turned from where he was watching Ginny and Hermione zip around the great hall, checking off names on their long scrolls of parchment. “Darling, I’m moderately fond of the boy. That does not equate to memorizing his timetable,” Draco informed him, archly.
“Hm, another thing Potter and I can bond over.” Draco’s smile had far too many glinting white teeth. Harry wanted to knock both their heads together over this juvenile competition for his allegiance.
“Excellent,” Draco stated. “Finish your fruit, boys, then teeth, please, and get to bed. And Scorpius, you’ll need your medicine, so let’s do that shortly? It’s late.”
“I’ll tell you what I know. I didn’t go down that path for long, however, your father would know better than I.”
The showers in the boys’ dormitory were divided by little stone half-walls, five to a side. All were vacant but one, where Draco stood under the spray, blond hair soaking and pushed back from his face, trailing down the back of his neck. His eyes were closed and Harry was struck yet again by his infuriating beauty.
A special thank you to my infatigable beta, Mimbelwimbel, for de-capitalizing all my "He said"s and so much more.
“Your chasers could use some work, mate,” Dean informed him and Harry had to agree. Draco’s offensive had an almost militant precision that Harry’s younger students couldn’t match.
“It just felt like it wouldn’t ever release,” Malfoy said, flopping back and drawing his hands over his face.
“It was right decent of you,” Dudley insisted, “especially after, well. Everything. We didn’t give you much of a home.”
“Draco,” Harry warned, “It doesn’t matter. We’re happy to use whatever terms make Dudley and Tanya comfortable.”
Clark gave a long-suffering sigh, as though the world was outrageously unfair and he was the one to suffer for it.
"Even if I wanted...both," Draco pondered softly, "I've no idea how one goes about it. What if I let in all his noise and chaos and then I resent it? Or what if I'm not
“I see,” Malfoy said, not perceiving any deceit in either of their faces. “Well, thank you for seeing to the well-being of my son, Potter. I’m sure you’ll want to get home.”
The intensity of Draco’s response intrigued Harry, and he dipped forward, taking the head in his mouth. He sucked slowly, infuriatingly so, he knew. He could sense the tension in Draco’s thighs, where the harsh welts from the tawse contrasted against pale skin and white blond hair. Harry dragged unrelenting fingertips across the irritated stripes. Draco tried to press forward into the pleasure and the pain, but in doing so, lost his footing—his binds not allowing him any such leeway. Reflexively, Harry gripped a bony hip to steady the other man before encouraging one lean thigh up and onto his shoulder. Draco’s heel dug into Harry’s back with urgency.
Swallowing, Draco forced his lips apart, trying to overpower the thrum of shame with the louder tattoo of obedience. Harry eased his thumb over Draco’s tongue and Draco closed his lips around it, refusing to think of the specifics of the action. He wasn’t
Harry gave a light chuckle, still stroking Jamie’s hair. “Always has been.” Jamie leant into the touch.
“It’s alright, love,” he said, more calmly than he felt. “I think Scorpius is just having a bit of a nightmare. Why don’t you go bunk with Teddy for a while, and I’ll get him settled down.”
Harry heard himself chuckle, “Better luck next time, Malfoy!” before sprinting down the steps to congratulate his team.
Thanks to everyone who is following along! I know I'm not updating as quickly as I would like, but hopefully I am making up for it with significantly longer chapters!
“You knew it was me,” Harry stated. He felt stuck in two places at once, part of him rooted in the past, part of him struggling to keep afloat in the present. He’d never given that moment much thought, it was just another nightmare in a heap of terrors that Harry had cast aside from those brutal months: Draco’s pale terrified face, his refusal to identify Harry with any certainty. “You must have.”
Hiram looked so surprised at this exchange and his sudden, relative safety, that he froze in mid-air, glancing around as if wondering if some sort of a foul was underway.
“This...with Potter and I…We...” The false starts clogged Draco’s throat and he tried to clear them away with a swallow of hot tea. When he did speak, the words came out in a humiliating rush: “I’ll admit it feels like it could be something. But beyond that I couldn’t tell you,” Draco informed her, cursing the flush he felt bloom high on his cheeks. “Because I don’t rightly know myself. I am, however,
“Who’re all these people?” Ron asked, following the movement and squinting at the cluster of dots and names beside the bottle-brush length of fur.
Harry sunk his teeth into his bottom lip, wondering if it was as easy as all that. If he would still feel like
“Oh,” the headmistress remarked. “Oh, I see. And...forgive me for asking, but I’d hate to perpetrate any family strife, so for transparency’s sake, she doesn’t mind you relocating the children?”
The sprites were humanoid, but absolutely tiny, each with a glowing light behind their sternum.  Two sets of rounded honey bee wings sprouted from each miniscule back, and when in motion, they beat as fast as hummingbirds’. The sprites were pantomiming little dances and aerial acrobatics, but wouldn’t stay still long enough for Al to get a good look at their features.
“I suspect that what the unfortunate girl wanted was for you to denounce me and run away with her, or at least beg for her to stay," Draco explained.
Scorpius felt a pang of envy. He understood why Harry had sidelined him, but the way the other Slytherins and Ravenclaws had raved about the adventure course the rest of the day left Scorpius with that unsettled ache of having missed out.
“No, that’s alright,” Harry assured him. The man gave him a small smile and walked smartly away. Harry knew objectively that the man was attractive. He wondered suddenly why he should feel things for Draco and not for this man, who was so physically similar.
“Shush,” Harry told him, a note of playful disbelief in his voice. “It was fucking hot, that’s what.”
had an evening together and he was disturbingly pleased to be here. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d looked forward to another adult’s company like this.
