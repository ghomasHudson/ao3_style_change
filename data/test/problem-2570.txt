"Hurry up, Ron," Harry called out when he was ready to go. "We'll be late and I don't particularly fancy having bats fly out from my nose in public."
The elf shook his head. "Mistress is asleep. And the letter is for Master. Magic says so."
"But what, Draco?" Pansy sighed. "You've always tended to do this, even in school." At Draco's confused look, she raised an eyebrow. "Oh, come on, you always used to overanalyze everything, reading it all wrong, and then blaming everyone else for your own mistaken assumptions."
"Why did you mention your nightmares?" Potter suddenly asked, his voice laced with worry. "You keep going around the question. Why did you need to see me?"
"But that's exactly it," Narcissa said quietly, looking around before speaking again. "I can read people quite easily, dear. And so far, I've been gaining the impression that all might not be well with you and Astoria, and it was a cause for my immense concern."
"I'm not sure, but given the tone of Harry's Patronus, he's likely wearing down the corridor at St. Mungo's by now. Haven't heard any updates about Ginny either, just that they had to rush her because she was in pain." She took a deep breath, probably to steady herself. "Thing is, neither Ron nor I can go there right now, though I think I can make it in an hour and Ron as early as four o'clock."
"If memory serves, you weren't exactly just sitting, nor were you the slightest bit useless. Look, you've even managed to polish this part of the marble to a terrific sheen, and only with your shoes. Job well done."
Honestly, he had no idea how to feel. He thought back to the conversation he'd had with Ron and Hermione after the pathetic failure of a date with Cho. What had she said then? Something about Cho having so many feelings in one go that it made her feel torn up inside and so difficult to deal with.
"Darling?" Astoria's voice carried from the hallway. Draco savored the last gulp of burning sweetness before pulling himself out of his comfortable seat.
been called the cleverest witch of our age by almost everyone, and that’s because it's true!"
Something suddenly dawned on Harry. "Has Draco's behavior changed at all in the last year?"
Draco felt his heart stutter at the sound of the gruff voice, but faced his kidnapper with all the haughty dignity he could muster. "And you are?" he demanded, voice dripping with barely contained venom.
At least until
When Narcissa had finished chanting the first half of the spell, Draco felt the stirrings of magic around them converge on his newborn son. He couldn't stop staring with longing, but he knew that he couldn't hold him until after the Naming.
Harry laughed hollowly. "To be honest... I can't decide which ones were worse. After the war, I’d wake up screaming to drown out all the noise of people dying all round me..."
Harry cringed. No, he definitely didn't want Malfoy to know about that. Perhaps he should go and give the Minister a piece of his mind. "No, you weren't supposed to know that either." This conversation was not at all going well.
To be honest, Draco couldn't imagine Potter playing some sort of relationship expert. He had always had the impression that the Gryffindor was socially inept, at the very least. He wondered about what Potter might have said to Hermione to have changed her perspective so much.
"What is it, Dray?" Harry asked concernedly. He rarely saw his friend at a loss for words. Even under pressure, Draco could talk his way out of anything. His sudden reticence just made Harry all the more sure that nothing good would come out of this conversation.
"Yes, I surmised as much," Draco drawled.
"Finally," Astoria breathed out with a weak smile.
"Of course! The more, the merrier."
"You'll offend a lot of people talking like that, Ron," added Ginny. "You should watch it." This time there was a glint in her eye when she looked pointedly at her brother.
. I think making those kinds of decisions, you know, having kids, settling down, it needs more than just love or compatibility. It needs two people who already know what they want and are sure that they can and
: Mr. Weasley, do you think this will affect your future marriage in any way?
"My son!" Draco could feel a heavy knot forming in his throat, threatening to break his voice. His mind filled with thoughts of his precious… his beautiful… "Don't you DARE even -"
Hermione sighed. "Perhaps this is Fate's way of shaking you up and telling you to take another look."
To Draco's horror, the man took out his wand and pointed it directly between his victim's eyes.
"I forgot!" Harry cried. "C'mon, there's a cafe downstairs that I'm sure you'll love." He led her back into his flat, and after a quick look around his new place, Harry magically locked the front door behind them, feeling ecstatic that everything seemed to be falling into place.
"As Minister for Magic," he said, "the power is vested in me to decide whether or not to award Mr. Harry Potter the right to
"For what?"
She swatted him on the forearm. "You could have gone pro, too, you idiot. Youngest Seeker in a century and all."
"Errr...that'd be my fault," said Potter, shifting uneasily on his feet under the blonde's glare. "We... I... just did a bit of convincing for the mediwitch to let me in, said you were a good friend and that you wouldn't mind the surprise visit."
: I'm sorry?
"I'm not stupid," he said matter-of-factly. "I learned all the intricacies of S
the silent signal that Potter wasn't cutting him off, he just had to deal with his own. How he instinctively got that from one significant look was beyond him.
"Any news?"
"Oh, don't you worry, Draco. You can owe me sometime later, when all this is taken care of." Her smile turned into more of a smirk this time. Draco had never felt prouder.
It took a couple of seconds for the words to sink in, but the redhead nodded just as enthusiastically. "Yes! Of course!"
"Playing with him again?"
Harry stared at his best friend with sympathy. He had no idea they were in such similar situations. "Wow," he said. "Who'd've thought we would both be here, barely 25, trying to get pissed because of relationship shite."
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco wondered if that could have helped him, too. He mentally noted to ask for Hermione's help, Malfoy Pride be damned.
If possible, the mediwitch looked even twitchier as she tried to meet the blonde's eyes. She mumbled a reply, but it was so indiscernible that Draco rolled his eyes and kept his verbal insults to himself, to his wife's amusement.
"Can you kindly elaborate for us non-Muggles?" Draco prompted, both scandalized and intrigued. As a Potions Master, he was very well versed in the art and science of magical potions. He had heard and dabbled a bit in Muggle Chemistry in France, but it was mostly for inorganic or inert substances - he knew very little of what Hermione meant.
He'd only been gone for six months, but Draco already felt like a stranger in his own home. In the good way, of course. The time he had spent during his apprenticeship in France had been filled with fresh air, bright sun and a certain liveliness that he now noticed was missing from Malfoy Manor. Upon stepping into the great Entrance Hall, he, for once, felt like he didn't belong. And he took it as a compliment to himself that he now felt like a much better person after being away from his old home.
Harry let out a breath that he had been holding. "I didn't expect you guys to actually argue about this. I was thinking of just letting out some of my frustrations and thought you'd deserve at least an explanation. Please don't argue for our sake. Ginny's back where she belongs-"
“Even with Ron and Hermione around?”
“So basically, every time I look at him I feel kind of sick but in a good way and I really want to kiss him.”
Draco glared at him. “Like precious Potter ever had to lift a finger in his whole life.”
“I just found it,” Harry lied.
The one thing he took comfort in was that nothing could go drastically wrong.
Harry groaned.
“We could make sure someone’s with Harry at all times,” Ron said, the ultimate act of betrayal. “Hermione and me are in all of his classes already.”
“You know there’s a difference between goons and friends, Harry. Would you compare Ron and Hermione to Vincent and Gregory?”
The day flew by. Pansy was kind enough to refrain from teasing him whenever Potter was near, and Draco found himself not too worried that she knew his darkest secret. They were normal again.
Draco’s heart skipped a beat. It was nice to feel Harry’s hand around his, and he wanted more. “I’m perfectly fine on my own, thank you.”
“Last night.”
“You broke your thumb?” Harry said, humorous disbelief flooding his voice.
Hey hey hey! I just got a job so if chapters are wayyyy more sporadic after this... that's why.
The door opened, and he and Potter both turned to see Professor Snape. “Minerva,” he said, with a slight nod. “I’ll handle Draco’s punishment from here.”
“Why would we?” Hermione rolled her eyes after Harry said this.
Potter noticed him before he reached the Gryffindor table and frowned. He nudged Weasley and Granger, directing their attention to him. “What do you want?” He asked.
“Why did you ask?” Draco asked.
“It means I buy you food-”
Draco bit his lip. Daphne had always seemed genuinely nice; while he could imagine other girls Pansy talked to immediately revealing her secrets, he felt Daphne was better than that. “I don’t think she did this intentionally. She probably got a letter from her parents, too. It’d be a good bonding moment.” Pansy shrugged, turning away from Draco and instead looking in the general direction of Crabbe. “Did you?”
“Exactly!” Draco was blushing again, and Harry wanted to punch him for real.
A wisp of blue leaked from the wand.
O shit gays y'all dig this huh. Thank you so much for reading and I hope this update didn't take too long. I just got a job and I start on Monday so let's see how frequent updates are gonna be? That being said, I'm super good on homework right now and spring break is SO CLOSE. Until next time~
Potter tossed another piece of meat. “Are you going to keep complaining, or do I have to keep forcing you to help?”
“I hope he gets in,” Goyle said. “Maybe he’ll finish the job on Potter.” Draco looked up at him and Crabbe. Death was less of a foreign concept when you were surrounded by ghosts, but he could hardly imagine someone their age being killed. He wasn’t sure he would want any of the kids are Hogwarts dead, even if it was Potter and his crew. He believed Crabbe and Goyle felt the same, though it was impossible to ignore the odd gleam in Crabbe’s eye.
They were being incredibly stupid. “Fine! We stay here then!”
“Okay,” Harry replied, his heart twisting. Draco sat beside him and threw one shoulder over Harry and another over himself. It was certainly bigger than either of them, but not necessarily so large they could both sit under it without half sitting on each other. Dracos right leg was slung over both of Harry’s, and he his right shoulder was pressed against Harry’s chest. “Right then. Cheers?”
By their third event that week, word had already gotten around, and Astoria was joyful at the positive commentary they received for continuing to project a united front as a model pureblood family with a modernized approach to wizarding culture. Several traditionalist diplomats had already approached Draco several times to congratulate him on his success at reestablishing the Malfoy name, while Astoria was celebrated among the society's ladies for being the epitome of a perfect pureblood wife and mother. Local papers and gossip mongers latched onto the introduction of Scorpius to the public world, with nothing but praise for the gentle heir of the noble House of Malfoy.
The Weasleys were his family, even after his technical separation from Ginny. But he never could find a sense of solitude because he was almost always in the midst of some sort of family gathering.
Draco rolled his eyes. Only Potter would have the gall to refer to the Minister by his name in such a tone. "Well, I'm glad he did, because now I get to thank you for all of it."
Draco glared at the owner of the guilty elbow, a man of nondescript looks who leered at him before stepping out of the shop. Huffing under his breath about allowing people into bookstores when they didn't look like they could even read, he awkwardly tried to use his wand to levitate the books back up. Before he could, however, delicate hands had already picked them up for him. He turned to thank her, but gasped when he saw her face.
She nodded morosely.
"How are you? Why the urgent call?" he asked after she hastily returned his greeting.
He didn't have to ask why Potter was here. Just as he had gone to him in his time of need, he knew Potter needed his company right now.
"Yes, Mother, I understand." Draco nodded, already knowing where the conversation would eventually end up. "I will trust your judgment."
"How is Ron?" she asked quietly.
Potter shrugged his shoulders. "Why not?
"We should just elope."
The silence that followed was so loud that Draco wanted to cover his ears.
"No, stay!"
"It's not like we can just give up on this," Harry said, perhaps a little scathingly. "Yes, I know that this wasn't part of our plan, at least this early on, but we've got to make this work somehow… and we're struggling as it is."
Their hour at the cafe earlier had been filled with Harry's overflowing river of worry and frustration, which Malfoy had taken in stride. He made the proper disgruntled noises at the right times, and even included some choice insults that were like music to Harry's ears. For some reason, the aloof, apathetic, egotistic friend he had in Malfoy was actually enough to distract and de-stress him.
"I am. But it's nice to see you've been keeping up with my social calendar, Potter," the blonde answered. Harry was about to think of a comeback, when he immediately noted the tension in his friend's expression, the tight pull of his frown and the uncertainty of his tone. In a second, his brain switched modes.
It only took a half hour after that, and then the Breaking News Special Edition Prophet could be seen everywhere, detailing how one of the staff writers had personally witnessed the Savior of the WIzarding World with Ginevra Weasley. No photos, of course, but that was that. People couldn't stop talking about Harry and Ginny, Harry with Ginny, and Harry dating Ginny.
Ron looked aghast at Harry's calm demeanor, but didn't say anything. Harry knew that it was a difficult position for his best mate to be in - caught between his best friend and his sister. He had thankfully grown past his teenage urge to implode and rant impulsively, which meant that he was still probably coming up with the appropriate response.
and that is obviously beyond our magical capacity and standing. Draco is lucky that Potter had even included him under his magical bindings. Scorpius could be well protected by this, but we must find why it won't latch onto his magical core."
A good glass of Ogden's finally brought down Harry's nerves. Immediately after he ended his Floo-call with Ginny (who had told him all about the different styles of brooms from Beijing), he had put James to bed in order to have some much-needed quiet time to himself.
At that moment, a disgruntled Ministry intern knocked on their open office door and indicated the file box he was holding.
He had expected Malfoy to be offended that he hadn't been named the Black heir, considering that he had the right of blood and Harry had none. But the blond didn't seem to care. Harry realized that maybe he wasn't the only one to have a particular dislike for this house.
"Astoria herself has no problems with the old ways of child rearing," he remarked thoughtfully. "And I used to agree with her. After all, it is the status quo, and nothing much has changed in the system for the last few decades. Wizards and witches of pureblood status are raised to understand familial duties and obligations, but not familial relationships. And look at me now, I can't possibly imagine leaving Scorpius in the company of nurse elves during his infancy even though I was brought up to expect such a practice."
That laugh again, rough and unrestrained. There was definitely an edge to the voice. "You've been at my mercy for
That was not to say that he was a little disappointed, because of course he wanted to at least be
"You seemed so ready, though," Hermione said.
"It's very different, having to worry for someone because they can't do it for themselves." Draco was still avoiding having to look at Harry, opting instead to gaze into the fire. Harry immediately understood it to mean that his friend was feeling vulnerable. He didn't press the issue.
He felt like an immense weight had lifted from his chest.
"But I do," Draco said meekly. When it was his family on the line, he meant business.
George appeared to be thinking something through. "You know Harry, maybe we should petition to add 'Bad Arse Mother Fucker' to your growing list of accolades..."
He found himself pacing in slight agitation, but his Mother's presence helped him to calm down in order to think about everything going through his head at the moment.
"Okay, okay..." Harry took a deep breath. "I'll get together a team, and we can address your problem as soon as you get back in. I'll be working from home and not on the field, but Ron is fully capable of leading the investigation from the Ministry."
: Yes, that's right. Ron and I have decided to marry before winter.
Harry felt proud that the effort he and Andromeda had been putting in teaching Teddy some basic ethical principles was now showing,
They had decided to spend this first day of freedom by going out in the open and enjoying each other's company for the first time without any reporters or stalkers. They were now perfectly safe, with Harry's magical binding extending to whomever he wished for as long as they were close to him. So the Weasleys, and therefore Ginny, along with Hermione, Neville and Luna, would benefit to an extent.
Narcissa's expression told Draco that she was slightly shocked. She had always been more supportive of his latest decisions, but always made sure to be graciously neutral. She always did make a great Devil's Advocate.
"D'you mind stepping out for a bit?" Potter asked his assembled team. They mumbled their acquiescence, and Weasley efficiently herded them out without so much as a questioning glance. It appeared that Potter really was the boss around here.
"Astoria. Her name is Astoria Greengrass."
When Potter quirked up an eyebrow, Draco sighed. "Of course the more affluent family, in this case, mine, has the honor of bestowing the child's name. Due to certain, er, complications with the family situation, I am the acting Lord Malfoy, but the happy power still belongs to my mother, the Lady Black. That line is still above the name of Greengrass, so I am quite sure that my son will end up having a constellation or star for his name."
The two Aurors were currently in the process of giving him a thorough briefing on the case. To the outside world, it was just one of the owners entertaining a couple of friends at his pub. But that was only because of the extensive list of privacy wards around themselves, of course, combined with the
Breaking expectations by his very popularity, Draco Malfoy has proven to be more than his family history and has in the last years reestablished himself as one of the most respected professionals in the country, (not to mention being elected several times as Most Desired Wizard in Witch Weekly.) Originally expected to languish amongst the former followers of You-Know-Who, he has instead made a name for himself and gone out of his way to break the prejudice that was bound to be against him. Now he is back in the limelight, sharing easy conversation with political dignitaries and in the good graces of his former school adversaries. It has not escaped the attention of this reporter that his relationship with Auror Potter has been pleasantly civil. This very observation can be taken as proof enough that Draco Malfoy has indeed changed for the better.
Narcissa and Hermione had been taken to the MMI office as soon as the securely direct Floo travel was established.
"You mean you had doubts about the amazing success of my idea?" Harry asked.
There you have it, folks. Our three young heroes, still on their way to changing the world, albeit in different ways. My hour at the Burrow was a pleasant opportunity, and more than enough for me to gain a new and deeper understanding of the Trio. It seems obvious that Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger will soon become the model of a perfectly new breed of family, with the healthy and playful relationship dynamic that they clearly have. And it warms my heart to learn of Harry Potter's continuous crusade against the Dark, showing us that he really is a true Savior at heart. behind his wall of privacy. Perhaps they will grant us another peek into their private lives, but that might be a while. It did, of course, take almost four years to be granted this highly personal interview. But until then, we may honor our own heroes by wishing them well on their way towards the bright futures ahead of them.
"We both know how you really felt about my father, Potter," he said with a wave of his hand. "No need for niceties when all the man wanted was to deliver you to his madman of a boss."
early in the morning, when the Floo finally rang and Harry rushed to the fire in time to see Ginny's face form out of the green flames.
"Lady Greengrass," he bowed low, taking the matron's delicate hand and kissing the air above it. "Daphne," he added, this time bowing towards the woman's daughter. She gave him an impassive look, merely nodding an acknowledgment. Lady Greengrass gave her daughter the evil eye.
"Yes, but it's close enough."
Both mother and son turned abruptly to stare at Astoria, who was now visibly shaking. She disengaged her hand from Draco's and ended up hugging herself, as if trying to keep warm despite the lack of cold around them.
Both Aurors turned around and found themselves looking incredulously at Draco Malfoy. After getting over the fact that the blonde had even noticed them, Harry finally found his voice and greeted his former adversary. Ron gave him a sort of wave before staring down at the table, apparently back to his own sorrows.
The threatening messages ceased for a while, which Macmillan told Draco was typically expected.
"-And now the Healers say they've stabilized her, whatever that means, but then she might have the baby soon, which is two months too early, and I can't help but worry for her safety, and the baby's as well, I mean, aren't babies supposed to keep developing 'til the full term? Merlin, there's so much that can go wrong if we have the baby too early, and Ginny's probably having a hard time, too, and there's nothing I can really do to help at this point and I hate feeling absolutely useless and - I'm sorry, I'm rambling, aren’t' I?"
"Da - ah ah ah wah mah!"
Ron looked flabbergasted, but obviously didn't want to fight with his wife. "It's true though, Herm, look at Harry. He's had to work from home and pass Jamie around my mum and Andromeda just because Ginny can't seem to find roots where her fiancé is. That's a bit messed up, I tell you."
They had both experienced near-death first hand, so the two of them had the tendency to celebrate the simplest pleasures and find joy in the most ephemeral moments. That was how they were in sixth year, stealing away to snog in dark alcoves, or sitting by the lake and talking of their dreams, punctuating serious heart-to-hearts with a few jokes in between. They never felt the need to cling or nag, since they both had gotten used to the idea that there was so much more to take care of outside of their relationship. Even their breakup didn't bring up negative feelings, because it had been necessary at the time. One of the things he had loved about her was that there was never any regret after the fact, because they had broken up with the utmost understanding of what the other needed to accomplish. Harry was grateful that Ginny had fully supported him during the war, especially during the Horcrux hunt. He remembered how difficult it had been for him to be huddled in his bunk in the middle of the night, Ron and Hermione's steady breathing echoing in their tent. He remembered the ache in his gut while watching Ginny's dot in Hogwarts, he had been so happy just knowing she was still alive.
Ella Perkins might have jumped a bit at Harry's sharpness, but he didn’t feel like apologizing at the moment. There were more important things on his mind.
Had Draco mistaken what he heard? "Pardon?" he asked somewhat sharply. Astoria flinched.
Today was different. Today, he was finally free.
: That's a very different style of law enforcement, I notice.
"They're very serious about helping us, you know," Draco mused. "It would probably be better if we actually trusted them to do their job."
Malfoy scoffed. "So dramatic," he admonished. "Now, where were we? Ah yes, Scorpius is doing very well, we have the nurse elves on him all day and night. Merlin knows Astoria needs to be away with her friends after being trapped here for so long."
"I was alone, and I was about to die, but you know what? I reminded myself that I was doing it for the people I loved. I was scared, but that made me realize that the love I felt for my friends and my family, and the love they felt for me, that was a kind of strength that shone from inside. You - you have to be strong to be able to carry someone else in your heart."
"Harry?" Ron's voice snapped him out of his darkening thoughts. When Harry looked at him, Ron gestured towards the other end of the sitting room, where James seemed to have woken up from a nap.
Love,
"What!" Ginny said defensively. "I'm asking for Helen's professional advice."
Draco looked doubtfully at the man, while Weasley and Hermione grabbed the opportunity to voice out their own concerns.
Potter nodded, still speaking in his History of Magic voice. "It was effective. It was activated independently right after we had caught him. At first we didn't think it would help him, because usually the Obliviators can unblock even a complex Memory Charm. In this case, however, the actual memories were gone, with no chances of being recovered so far. It's worse than the one Lockhart got, because at least he had residual traces of his past, and the ghosts of old habits are still present in him even now. In Pince's case though, it was almost surgical, really precise. The only memory we managed to retrieve was this, we think it's a list of ingredients." He handed Draco a copy. "The Obliviators believe that this wasn't erased because it held no personally incriminating significance to Pince."
"Morning, all!" Percy greeted, settling in a seat beside Ron and grabbing some toast. "Sorry I'm late, had a bit of a mess this morning at work, you see." At this, he winked at Harry, who had no idea what he meant.
: (fixes hair) Oh, well, thank you very much. I had no idea, but that's - wow, I hope I've done alright by them.
Potter had spent half of their impromptu meeting in pensive silence, and the other half sharing his thoughts about him and his - well, now that Draco realized, Potter had NEVER even mentioned the words 'girlfriend', 'fiancée' or 'betrothed' in any conversation that he could recall. Odd.
"But what?"
"Look," he said, trying to even out his tone. "I don't know how many more times I can say this, but please,
Draco could remember how he had been in the same position, waiting anxiously and alternating between sitting restlessly and pacing incessantly. Which Potter had been doing for the last two hours, driving both Hermione and Weasley mental.
Harry sighed. "Honestly? I think we were both too naive and idealistic after the war. I can't speak for her, but I'm only now starting to realize how... well how much I needed to figure out on my own before diving into the idea of having a family."
He just realized that he very much wanted to become a part of his son's life, and not in the way that Malfoys were 'bred'. He hated the word. He wanted his son to have the kind of life that he, Draco, had never even thought he had wanted. Now he did, and he was damn well ready to turn his back upon his family's traditions for the little boy who had captured his heart and soul the very first moment he laid eyes on him.
Malfoy cocked his head to the side. "That's true. Less pressure sounds good. I've got enough going on as it is."
And what a night it was. Draco sighed heavily as he attempted to reorganize his new facts about the Chosen One.
Hearing this from his mother was too much. He was taken back to the times when his mother would utter the exact same words right after Draco had shared some sort of dilemma or made a rash decision. It was her tone that did it. The one that told him she was sure that he was wrong.
"Don't you worry about that now, mate," Ron said soothingly. "We're making progress on his investigation. We'll update you as soon as we can about that. For now, just make sure you keep your family inside Malfoy Manor, alright?"
"I don't need-"
"The years I spent at Hogwarts had been a matter of public interest, and I'm sure that the writers over at the Daily Prophet can attest to that." He grinned pointedly at a flushing Rita Skeeter, who gave a shrug. "Everything I did, and didn't, were never mine to keep to myself or share only to those I cared about. Each triumph, humiliation, speculation and condemnation was free for all, and I would wish for all that to end."
Draco felt his breath catch. Were they asking him,
"Privacy charms," she supplied. "The more extreme kind that your father favored."
"Of course," Draco answered. It was his turn at the till, and he excused himself to pay for his books. When he had been given his change, he turned back to the lady, only to find that she had gone. With a frown, he looked around, but realized that she must have left the shop.
Percy laughed. "Harry, you had every right to do that. Really, it's the least that the Ministry can do, to keep out of your life for once."
Draco caught a guilty look flash on Potter's face. "Actually...I learned well enough when I was seven. Or maybe eight? I'm not exactly sure though, to be honest."
Astoria sniffed. "Of course our baby deserves no less!"
The brunet nodded, and there was no sign of having been offended by the conversation not more than a minute ago. "I meant it, you know," he seemed to insist. "I wanted to thank you for... for just being here. I guess I never knew how much I'd been relying on Ron and Hermione in times of, er, crises, until I had to make do with you - wait, that came out wrong," he added hastily, laughing.
Draco wanted to strangle Potter by this point, but now he almost felt sorry for the Auror. "The only known limitations of the
"Ron!" the brunet cried out excitedly. "D'you remember a few weeks back, when Malfoy gave you permission to place that new tracking charm on him and Scorpius?"
If he could just get away from the allure of little Scorpius, that is.
"After eating, I felt sick," Astoria continued. "Nothing too serious, because I've been having such attacks lately, but never anything too serious."
"You don't have to tell me if you really wish not to," Malfoy said suddenly, his voice slightly laced with ice. "But I hope you don't take me for someone stupidly thick."
"What potions?" He honestly felt like he'd been asking unanswered questions since he walked in.
“No way,” he said out loud into the empty bedroom. “No
as a distraction until they got here."
: Your wards, Harry-
and had made headlines by being the sole witness to defend him and his mother. He remembered the feeling of dread and cool acceptance that he and Narcissa had accustomed themselves to. They had not expected a fair trial at all. Suddenly, his domestic woes seemed inconsequential to the topic at hand.
"Nothing much, but…I was wondering if I could come through and we could just - perhaps talk and while away the time? Are you busy?" the blonde asked quickly.
: How so?
"I think it's high time that the Prophet reported about something that makes me happy, instead of all the horrible stuff from before."
When Draco had offered Scorpius earlier for Astoria to hold, she had silently refused, and Draco could see that his wife was badly shaking. He had taken her wordless plea and kept holding their son, perhaps in a vain attempt to shield him from whatever new threat they were now facing. If anything, however, he became more agitated as his mind came up with even more dangerous situations that might befall his wife and son.
"We all went out last night, and he and Ron stayed over. Malfoy's been working with us on the case, if you recall what I've told you over the Floo." He didn't know why he was suddenly defensive of the blonde, but he knew that his fiancée wasn't exactly a fan of his former adversary. "And since your brother was as functional as a flobberworm, he's been kind enough to help out with Teddy and James this morning, actually."
To her credit, Hermione did not seem to think any less of him, but gently took the proffered sheets. Her eyes quickly scanned left and right, top to bottom, at a speed that was somewhat alarming to Draco. It was when her entire face turned white that he began to worry.
Unbecoming of a Malfoy and everything.
An owl fluttered into Harry's open window, and he recognized it as one of the Weasleys'. It was pretty late, but he got up anyways in case it was an emergency. Handing out a couple of owl treats, he took the piece of parchment and read it in the firelight. Suddenly, he gave a loud whoop and pumped his fist in the air, startling the owl. He apologized to the bird, then hastily scribbled out a reply, attaching it to the owl's leg and sending him off into the night.
"Thank you."
"And oh, what a wonderful happenstance that you just bumped into the loveliest and most intriguing witch you'd ever laid your eyes on!" His tone was dripping with mockery once more. "It was just good luck that your future wife was there looking for the same exact book, eh?"
"You forgot the tendency for detachment, isolation and being a hermit," Ginevra added, which made Potter scowl.
"I'm sorry," Dream-Malfoy whispered, dropping his wand onto the flooded floor.
"I see," the blonde answered, seemingly deep in thought. Harry was surprised that there were no follow-up inquiries, and he wondered what he could be thinking about so thoroughly, when Ron interrupted Malfoy with his own questions.
With a sigh, he went through the doors into Kingsley's office, hoping that this meeting would at least keep his mind away from his drab future, and maybe bring good news for once in his life.
The idea seemed to relax Potter a bit; his shoulders were no longer held as stiffly as earlier. In fact, there was a hint of a laugh in Potter's eyes despite the slight frown still on his features. However, he didn't seem to have much to add, or perhaps he had lost the motivation to speak in sentences, so Draco decided to move the conversation onwards.
Draco couldn't help it - the panic in his voice was evident and
"He asked if he could place some diagnostic charms on me to find out if I had caught something. You know how those take at least one day before they can be interpreted by Healers?"
Harry felt the weight of the bag. “Merlin. How much did you bet?”
Pansy glared and turned as dramatically as she could, her short, black hair swaying as she walked away. “Nice,” Blaise said. “You pissed off your girlfriend.”
And then the verbal barrage started. “To think I wasted thirteen years raising such an ungrateful disgrace, an utter disappointment, someone willing to throw the Malfoy bloodline away for trash, because he’s too weak to get over-”
“Told them what?”
“Completely unfair.”
Draco frowned. “I can’t tell you.”
Draco quickly kissed Harry and checked outside before fully stepping out. “See you on the pitch!”
Together they half carried Draco out of the classroom. “Should we take him to Madam Pomfrey?” Blaise asked, supporting most of Draco’s weight. Draco found himself blushing. It was a short-lived crush, but Blaise was aggressively Slytherin and handsome in a put-together way as opposed to Potter’s I-rolled-out-of-a-dumpster-but-it’s-kind-of-working way.
“Not many Muggles are… Like that. And the ones who are don’t say it, really, because people can be really cruel to them.” Hermione looked almost ashamed to say it.
Hey hey hey, college hasn't gotten too rough yet! So have a chapter my lovelies, I was really happy to see that with one short chapter everyone still seemed excited. Feel free to leave a comment, I love to hear what you think! Until next time~
“Is that her name? I never knew, and I doubt he did, either.” Draco looked forward, almost vacant, to the wall. “He’s not an evil man, but he’s capable of evil. And that’s all anyone sees. And then they see me, and they connect dots, and the good families tell their kids to stay away from me, and my only friends are playing their cards right to cozy up to a pureblood family.”
Draco grabbed one end of it to get a better look, and Harry surprised himself when he didn’t immediately take it away. “This is insanely complex stuff. Look, there’s us. Your two friends in the tower-”
She handed the box to Potter, who did not look excited for the menial task ahead of him. Them. Ahead of them.
“I’m not like you!”
“Then stop acting like it!”
Harry did. “I’m fine,” he said, and hoped he looked better than he sounded.
Harry looked at the dresser, which was thumping and shaking, and nodded. He had suspected as much when he told Lupin he feared them. “Okay. I’m ready.”
“I could’ve gone my whole life without going back into the Slytherin common room,” Ron murmured as, huddled underneath the invisibility cloak, they waited next to the door. Hermione was nearly vibrating with nerves and Harry couldn’t blame her.
Weeks passed. Harry’s days were split between homework and classes, Quidditch practice, and slipping away to quiet corners for a few minutes to see Draco.
Out of the corner of his eye he saw a gold glitter. His stomach tightened. He could likely depend on Draco being so reliant on Harry to react that he wouldn’t even look for the snitch, but if he did see it Gryffindor would suffer an embarrassing defeat.
Draco smiled, but it was a small one. “What else. Because I think you’re handsome. Too handsome for your own good, and you’re so dumb! But so clever, and the combination makes me mad and I just want to snog you. I hate it! I thought you were just eye candy but I enjoy that we’ve just been talking more. I want to talk with you more. Maybe just hang out like this more often.”
In about a split second, a series of thoughts ran through his head. He didn’t know what his greatest fear was. Not snakes. Not heights. Probably not spiders. Not vampires. Not werewolves.
They both looked around. They were still alone, and they were whisper-yelling at each other so as to avoid detection. “You don’t have to lie to me, but don’t you dare lie to yourself. If we can’t rely on each other, then who the else can we rely on?”
Draco was white with fear, but he took a deep breath and asked, “What did they say?”
He didn’t dwell on it for long, though. He hadn’t eaten yet, and he should grab a meal before Herbology.
“And we both can fit and walk and stand underneath it?”
“What, you’d want to be seen with me in the Great Hall?” Harry asked. He certainly didn’t want anyone to think he was suddenly friendly with Draco. And Draco probably felt the same.
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter clenched his jaw and said, quietly, “You can leave. I won’t force you to stay here.”
Hermione frowned. “Something happened.”
“Nine works,” Harry replied, and they both led their friend groups away.
“You read the letter. Daphne ratted me out. All the others would probably do the same.”
“It’s an imposing name,” Blaise said. “Remember, Draco, just because we supported the movement doesn’t mean most of our parents didn’t also fear it. I’m willing to bet your father felt the same. Him being in the inner circle intimidates plenty of us.”
“She’s not my bloody girlfriend,” Draco scowled, starting to walk back to the common room. To his dismay, Blaise followed. “Don’t you have somewhere better to be?”
“Uh.”
Third: I hope you guys enjoyed. I am so grateful for the support you guys gave me. Until next time~
“I’ve got time,” Pansy replied. “Besides, I don’t want to leave you alone.”
Pansy stroked his hair and he frowned. He could guess that she was bored of his favorite conversation topic and, in all honesty, he was too. Yet here they were; he was laying on one of the common room couches with his head on her lap to vent about Potter’s existence. It was well into the morning, allowing them privacy that was rarely found in the Slytherin common room.
She flushed. “I don’t have a problem.”
Potter clenched his draw and pocketed his wand, the beetles now restored to their original form. “Stop insulting my friends, Malfoy. I don’t care how many detentions we get.”
Lupin frowned. “Alright. Think of something happy. Whatever it was last time wasn’t enough.”
“After breakfast.”
“Hey, maybe you’re in love with Potter.”
“I couldn’t remember all of the passwords,” he whispered.
Draco yawned, then said, “Right. Sorry. Habit, I guess. You can handle the beetles this time, I’ll do the matchsticks.”
“Of course he likes him, they’ve been swapping spit for a while now.” Hermione and Harry both made disgusted faces and turned to glare at Ron. “What?”
“Absolutely not. I don’t think they will be for a few days.”
“I can walk there on my own,” Draco said. “Pansy, you need to get to Arithmancy.”
“Was not!”
“Nothing,” they replied.
Harry hoped it was dim enough to hide his blush. “Thanks,” he murmured.
They stayed until he was marginally better, and left knowing they shouldered the weight of Buckbeak’s life. “Just tell your boyfriend to make his dad lay off,” Ron grunted.
“Harry shouldn't have provoked him,” Hermione said weakly.
Seeing amusement in their eyes, Lupin said, “Exactly. Another thing that’s important to note; the boggart can only take one form at a time. Sheer numbers can confuse the boggart, as it will attempt to take multiple shapes at once. That’s how we’ll finish it off. To start us off, everyone line up.”
Draco glowered at him. In two hours, he would find himself with Potter in Lupin’s room, where they would be helping him clean out tanks and whatnot. Draco was incredibly tired. It had only been one day, but being alone with Potter was a painful experience. He was annoying and handsome and too much to bear. And seeing Lupin again might open up questions about his boggart.
Potter’s face was red and he was pressing his lips together firm, almost as if he was forcing whatever he was thinking to stay inside. Draco was too fixated on his lips to raise any protest. Finally, Snape said, “Let’s go, Draco.”
Draco almost said something snappy and witty in response, but McGonagall coughed and gave them both a very pointed look. “Just… Take care of the needles.”
He looked down at his now clean hands and arms, and said, “Thanks.”
“Where do we hide a Hippogriff?” Blaise asked, not unkindly.
Nott was first, and a large, black cat sauntered out of the dresser, it’s eyes large and yellow and pinned on him. It was a panther, Draco realized, and it silently moved closer to Nott, its impossibly large mouth opening to reveal many sharp, white teeth. Nott forced out a shaky, “Riddikulus!” and the panther transformed into a small, fluffy kitten. He let out a sigh of relief and the class laughed as Daphne, who was behind him, pushed him out of the way.
More like his dad. Lucius Malfoy was standing in front of him, and he was confused more than all else. He loved his father. He got along quite well with him.
When McGonagall returned his broom, he nearly cried. Dear Merlin, they had a chance. No, much better than a chance, they would win.
Draco was in the common room doing homework. Classes were wonderful again with Pansy talking to him, and Blaise was slowly inserting himself into their friendship. It was probably desperation, but the second day of this happening made Draco feel like he was invincible. He was happy.
Hermione looked torn between guilt and suspicion. Ron was too busy staring across at the Slytherin table. Draco was staring at them (it was easier to lump them together than admit he was looking only at Harry). “Honestly, the nerve of him. He got you into detention for a week and still wants to sit over there all smug.”
to do with being clever. It's absolutely
Harry trusted Ron's predictions. After all, their field experience was enough to make educated guesses. The two had been exchanging updates about the reports while Harry was back to working from home. He knew it must have been unsettling for Draco to learn that his stalker was following him so closely, but he himself had experienced it with various other criminals who all thought they were being creative. At this point, Draco's dismissal of the first two threats would result in a need to be taken seriously. They needn't have waited for too long.
Draco flushed. He had no idea Potter could guess at his possible motivations with such accuracy. Maybe he underestimated him.
"I don't want both of us to be so far away from our son, even for just one night," he quickly interrupted.
Harry winced at the reminder. "Er... share a lot of secrets last night, did I?" he asked nervously.
"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder," Potter replied. "We all had it bad, but I think Hermione was able to treat mine better because she didn't make it seem like a debilitating disease for me. Didn't make it seem like I was mental after everything. Kind of eased me through it, her and Ron."
He got the surprise of a lifetime when he answered. "Draco!" he exclaimed. "What's wrong?"
work together towards the same goals. Goals that are concrete and tangible, not arbitrary."
"I didn't want kids so early, Draco," she said in a soft voice, as if afraid of actually saying it out loud. "Now we've got two, and I'm still getting used to being the stay-at-home mother when part of me still yearns for the career I had so carefully planned out..."
Andromeda appeared lost, but quickly gathered herself and returned his polite tone. "Yes, I'm afraid though that I have been, ah, out of touch with your side of the family for many years."
Of course, Harry knew that they were no longer fighting in reality. Then he saw that Dream-Malfoy had morphed once again, now appearing to be no older than eleven. When he looked down, Harry saw that he himself had somehow become skinny and scrawny once more. He felt his dream-self drop his wand as well. "I don't want to fight anymore, either."
Hermione's eyes started to fill with tears one again, the third time since he had started explaining the whole situation to them.
It wasn't as if he had her natural charm or offhanded beauty-
Making breakfast with the potions prat had been awkward enough, but proper manners pretty much dictated that Malfoy could hardly refuse Hermione's invitation to dine together as '
As Potter led them into the hallway, Weasley remarked on how much better the place looked after Potter had "taken an axe to it."
He had grabbed Ginny and spun her around, then almost immediately dropping her gently, worried for the baby.
"I can't be sure," Narcissa pleaded. "I can attest to the strength and integrity of the wards, especially now that I have gone through the historical accounts. They're one of the most formidable defenses dating from the twelfth century, and are meant to be, well, impregnable. I know it seems a small detail, but I thought you ought to be informed."
"Thanks, Malfoy," Harry said sincerely. Ron nodded, and in a second, Malfoy had gone. The two of them brushed off soot from their robes and went back to the hallway where Hermione and Ginny were still busy exchanging stories.
"There's something I've actually been wanting to talk to you about…"
Harry nodded.
The week following Scorpius' birth found several changes in the Weasley and Potter households, or at least Harry thought so. Hermione and Ron seemed to have rediscovered something in their relationship and were now much more involved in tending to Rose and Hugo. Harry himself noticed that Ginny seemed to be putting more pressure on herself to play the part of mother to James. That part had affected him strangely, if he were being honest, and after a couple of day thinking about it, realized that it was because he didn't want Ginny keeping his hopes up until the other shoe dropped.
He proffered his arm to her, and she accepted. "I'm really starting to believe that your vanity makes up more than three quarters of your personality," she teased. Draco sniffed, playing the affronted husband.
"I am happy," Draco argued, frown back in place.
a Slytherin, you know. I could read you like a book, and despite all your formal training, I think your Gryffindor transparency has betrayed you. I can tell that you both desperately need to get piss-drunk, so consider this a parting gift from someone who would rather not be present for your sob stories. Cheers!" And before the others could say anything, he winked, turned on his heel and walked away.
"Er... yeah, kind of..." Harry mumbled, suddenly regretting ever calling his best friends over. He hadn't exactly foreseen them to be on the extreme opposites where Ginny was concerned.
Draco had thought about that angle as well. He knew enough of Potter to guess that he was a family man, but he couldn't imagine how odd of a life that would be, to hide away your family in a box and stuff it in a corner where no one could find it.
He had expected his mother to react negatively to his blatant disregard for the customs of his House, so he was surprised when she radiated with pure happiness. When he looked confused at her expression, she laughed.
"I still can't believe it, either," she said softly, sipping her tea with finesse.
The Healer gave them a brilliant smile. "I appreciate the trust that you both grant me," she said humbly. "I assure you, Harry, that it's better to do this now that wait for further complications."
He had spent the last year doing exactly what he wanted to do, even on a whim. It took a while to get used to, but finally Harry had learned to take control of his life, as well as answer to the consequences of his own actions. He no longer had stalkers or reporters hounding him wherever he went, so he had more time and privacy on his hands to try out some things that he couldn't have done before. He had gone out on a lot of dates with Ginny, gone around the country every week with Ron and Hermione. He had also taken Teddy out a lot to do whatever fun activity the boy could think of. He'd even caught up with his Hogwarts friends, since they no longer had to worry about being overheard, or hounded by the crowd. Some of those activities, he decided to turn into habit, so his quality time with his friends and family had improved quite a lot. It made a big difference, his not having to fear either loss of life or of privacy. And he was very grateful for it.
"No," Malfoy said, deflated. "No one really stays here except me, Astoria, my parents and the elves."
It came through the Malfoy wards once again. This time, it said, '
Just like the last time, Harry and Ron had arrived on time, but Malfoy, ever the gracious host, had arrived just before they did in order to welcome them inside. As it was after dinner, Viridian was packed with patrons. However, Malfoy had had the foresight to reserve their usual booth in the corner ahead of time. Of course, he also had ownership rights to throw around just in case, but thankfully, in Harry's opinion, it never got to that.
Harry actually thought there was a bit of tension in their relationship, but not the aggressive kind. It was very different from the time back in Hogwarts when being in the same castle as Malfoy was enough to make him want to throttle the magic out of him. But this kind of tension was different, though Harry didn't think it was anything negative.
"So... anything else wrong with, er, her magic?" Harry inquired curiously.
Potter, perhaps seeing the familiar expression on his face, seemed to liven even more, which Draco hoped meant that he knew it was all in jest. Hard to say with a Gryff, really.
: You're welcome.
Harry shook his head. "I honestly don't know, Ron. Really. I'm so excited to have this kid, and Ginny's been acting as if it's holding her back from training. She only comes home one day a week now, since she's decided to stay on for training even if she's banned from flying, and Merlin knows we haven't even properly celebrated the fact that we're going to have a son!" With that, Harry took a big gulp and set his mug down heavily. "We're alright, Ginny and I. It's just- I hate that she's away during this- this special time for us as a couple. But I would hate myself if I took away the one passion she has in her life. I'm afraid that this is all my fault, that I can't give her what she wants, what she dreams of."
"What kind of mess?" asked Ron, who apparently didn't get the joke either.
"Yes, I thought some time alone with her might give you the same burning joy. But when you came back, you seemed to have dimmed further."
Draco pouted. "Another family meeting?"
Malfoy's breath seemed to hitch.
"Oh, it will be so odd not to have to fuss over our Harry when there's a particularly nasty crowd around, won't it?" gushed Mrs. Weasley, thinking of those countless times they were harassed for an interview or a photo.
The redhead, bless him, merely rolled his eyes at Harry's outburst. "I meant, if you think the person who poisoned Malfoy is the same one giving the threats?"
"I'm surprised Astoria even considered this," he mused.
asking for it."
"We?! Who-" Before Draco could finish his outraged question, in stumbled the rest of the Golden Trio, looking slightly embarrassed.
Narcissa cleared her throat, which made Draco realize that he had been silently seething while his mother watched amusedly. He shook his head imperceptibly and started on the platter that had been waiting in front of him. Breakfast that morning was a wordless affair.
His eyes once more glanced towards 'their' booth. Ginny was still talking, he realized.
When Narcissa's expression brightened at his words, Draco couldn't help but smirk. "We'll see if your theories have any basis in fact."
Harry knew that while Arthur Weasley had agreed with Ginny regarding the belated wedding, Molly had remained adamant on arranging their bonding ceremony as soon as possible. Since they'd announced the pregnancy to the family a couple of months ago, Molly had taken to confronting them individually whenever she could, berating them about the consequences of their final decision.
?" Hermione asked uncertainly.
He couldn't help but feel a happy flutter in the pit of his stomach.
Ron shrugged. "He doesn't have a high enough status to request for top level warding..."
Harry nodded. "It does make sense, though. It could happen… I just wasn't counting on it."
Potter took a huge gulp before speaking again. "Ginny's going away for another six weeks. Montreal."
"Can't help it," Potter quipped. "Kreacher just likes overstuffing people with food until they explode."
"Tell me how you see yourself a year from now. Two years from now. Five years. Tell me, now, the first thing that comes to mind."
Odd as it was, a part of him still felt rebuffed by Potter's rejection of his handshake in their First year. Over the years, he had always counted on just a civil acquaintance with the Chosen One. The last month they had spent exchanging owls and talking on Fire-calls, however, made Draco realize that they could, in fact, be good friends. With Potter and Weasley inviting him into their fold, he felt a bit vindicated somehow. He would deny it, of course, but deep inside, he knew that Potter was silently holding out his hand in friendship, and Draco was more than happy to take it.
"Oh, right," Harry said, forcing himself to pay attention. He was being really rude. "No need today though, from what I know, Malfoy's been over already. So at least we know she gets company apart from us." He still thought it was amusing that Hermione and Malfoy had taken to each other quite well.
Harry couldn't keep the grin from appearing on his face. "We aim to please," he quipped.
"Yes?"
Narcissa glared at him. "I am not being irrational. I only mean you well, Draco. There have been so many opportunities for me to play you like the obedient heir that you might have been groomed to be, had the second war not happened as it did. But I have always been against all of that, and everything I have done since having you has been to ensure that you are able to grow into yourself and make your own decisions. I admit my mistake now because I assumed that you were neglecting your marriage. But now it appears to me that you cannot be completely happy just acting the part of husband to your wife."
Upon slamming the door and casting every locking and privacy spell he could, he finally let himself collapse into an armchair with a held back sob.
This time, he felt the full weight of the young boy on his stomach, and he let out an undignified 'oomph'.
It seemed like it was Malfoy's turn to be surprised. "So none of the old stipulations? How does that even work?"
Malfoy nodded. "It's not exactly open information, but seeing as you value privacy, what with your invocation and all" (Harry chuckled at that) "I guess I can be forthcoming with you two." He took another drink before continuing, and both Harry and Ron leaned closer with interest.
"Exactly," Ron said, smugly. "You should go and talk to Odair yourself and make him understand that Ginny has to rearrange her priorities a bit first, at least until James is a bit older, you know?"
His mother nodded and squeezed his hands back. "That's all I ask."
"I find it quite easy to talk with you. Whatever the topic, actually. I'm sure we could spend hours and hours just exchanging banter and not tiring of it.
The news still didn't distract Harry, however, from the intense feelings of concern that were eating away at his stomach.
"Haven't we just eaten less than two hours ago?" Ginevra cried in disbelief, patting her tummy. "I'll never get my figure back!"
"Harry."
: (gulps)
Deep inside, he wondered how it would have been if he had made such a proud announcement when he and Ginny were expecting James. Sure, they had told it to their family and closest friends, but it had been hushed up for James' own safety, and Harry didn't regret it. but reading Malfoy's message brought to his head a picture of the blond and his wife, happily (and exuberantly) celebrating the coming of their long-awaited heir, to the flash of cameras and the scratching of quills. He was sure that this would be on the news, and that witches around the country would be swooning about their adorable little blonde family-
The unexpected voice broke into Harry's moment of sorrow. It sounded as if... but it couldn't be... He wouldn't...
