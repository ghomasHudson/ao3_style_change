He settled at the table, nodding in acknowledgement when Parvati's eyes flicked meaningfully towards Fathi, clearly wondering if Harry was seeing what she was. Harry could barely contain himself, his entire body thrumming with the need to hear the news. But he made himself wait, knowing Fathi would prefer not to repeat himself.
"Err, yes. Like whips and blindfolds and stuff?"
"No," Harry replied, reaching for the section Draco had passed his way.
"You had your Portkey calibrated to send you directly to your bedroom?"
"Oh, Harry," Draco breathed, so quietly that Harry almost couldn't hear him. He looked at Harry for another long moment, the intensity of his gaze making Harry flush and squirm before Draco withdrew his wand. He Conjured up a glass and filled it with a muttered
Harry imagined himself in Emily's place, his cheeks burning with shame at the squirmy pleasure that suffused his body at the image. He knew he shouldn't desire it, that it was weak to want to act like a baby, that he should be strong enough not to desperately crave such freedom of responsibility. But now that he'd seen the possibility, he was powerless to ignore its allure. How lovely would it be, to be the one taken care of instead of the one always doing the caring? How liberating, to want for nothing more than to play, and to please?
"Yeah, okay, anything," Harry babbled, too lost in the sparks of pleasure shooting out from his groin with each roll of Draco's hips to pay his words much mind.
He wonders why Potter bothered and the thought keeps him awake for the rest of the night.
Parvati's expression grew pained, and she opened her mouth as if to say something before seeming to think better of it. Good. He knew people had plenty of reasons to dislike Draco for his role in the second war with Voldemort, and they had every right to their anger. But the war had ended seven year ago, and he and Harry had been together for several years—plenty of time for his friends to get used to the idea. It wasn't like Parvati to hold a grudge, and she'd seemed to get on with him well enough the few times Harry had brought him to their Auror Department get-togethers, but perhaps being in the midst of this war was stirring up bad memories of the last one she'd been involved in.
. He ended up snoozing his Alarm Charm four times and was almost late to work anyway, totally ruining his plan to get up early and look over the lists over with a cup of coffee and a clear head.
"Harry," Draco said, his voice severe and full of reproach. "Tell me you're not thinking of volunteering."
"So today, when we showed up, they were… playing?"
need if you aren't going to be into it."
After they finished eating, and Harry had finished spelling out words with the dregs of his pasta letters, Draco cleaned up the dishes with several quick spells.
Draco flashed him a somewhat sheepish smile. "I think that might have been an unrealistic aspiration, given our history."
Harry didn't look at the list until after work the next day.
This was always Harry's favourite part, when he not only got to watch Draco work his literal magic, but got to
There was a mirror hanging on the wall and Harry peered into it with a small amount of reservation, unsure of what he would see. He was immediately captivated. It was wild how much a set of clothes could age somebody, or rather,
"I was planning to tell you about all of this eventually, of course. It's something I enjoy, and most of my past relationships have had an element of kink, but it's not… it's not something I
"You can make a difference here!"
inside of him, rubbing right up against his prostate as Harry rocked up and down on Draco's cock. He could already tell this was going to be over embarrassingly quickly, but he didn't mind, not when they'd already agreed they'd be doing this again, that this wouldn't be the first, last, and only time.
"Of course. It's good for me to get out every once in a while and become better acquainted with your friends."
off. He wasn't sure he'd ever be able to look Draco in the eye again if he called him
Harry huffed out a frustrated breath but nodded and released his hold on Draco's robes. Draco gave him one last measured look before heading up after Graham, leaving Harry to follow.
He wasn't so sure about that Daddy bit, though; that seemed to be taking things a bit far. Particularly given his plethora of issues related to the death of just about every person who'd ever been a father figure to him. But Draco had said that kinky relationships came in all different shapes, so maybe he didn't need a
so casually set Harry's entire body on fire. He cleared his throat around the sudden dryness.
"Okay, Cara, get ready. Do you see that hazy ball of light way across the foyer?" He gestured to the white halo of smoke and she nodded. "That's the exit. We're going to make a break for it." She looked nervously up at the ceiling, which was looking increasingly unstable, but there wasn't much for it. "I'm going to provide cover for you and Sean, and I want you to just focus on getting there as quickly as you can, all right? Keep low. We don't know yet what's on the other side of those doors, but we've gotta get out of this building. Wait for me before you go through."
"No, I suspect you're right. War is almost inevitable at this point, it's just a matter of time." Draco's jaw clenched with a helpless fury Harry knew all too well. They were all still healing from their own war, and there was quite a bit left unsaid between the two of them. Harry knew they needed to have those tough conversations eventually if they ever wanted to make a proper go of things, and they'd already started making progress, but he didn't want that for tonight. Tonight he wanted to think about the future, not the past.
"Thought"—Harry scraped his teeth along Draco's throat and Draco gasped—"you'd be more pissed about losing."
"I'm going to have to beat you at Quidditch more often if this is what I get for it," Draco said as he stared down at Harry. He wasn't sure he'd ever seen a hotter sight than Harry Potter decked out in Quidditch gear and on his knees for Draco.
"How long was I sleeping?"
"All right then, that's settled." His expression took on a more predatory gleam, his eyes smouldering with sudden heat. "That frees us up for our final activity of the evening."
sorry, but I'm afraid I'm working that night. In fact, I'm working every night for the foreseeable future. Too bad."
something. It would be his pleasure to take each and every one of these bastards down. Just as soon as Fathi gave the bloody signal.
Harry climbed up the front steps, Draco a solid presence behind him as he reached out to give the door a firm rap. They only had to wait a few moments before the door swung open, revealing an attractive gentleman who looked to be in his mid-forties. His brow was creased with annoyance but his expression quickly cleared when he caught sight of the Auror uniforms.
No, really, he wasn't. He was… processing. Just like Draco said he should. And if he spent all day Saturday
"Li's still out," Harry said. His Auror partner, Sue Li, had been one of the first to come down with the flu and she'd been laid up for nearly a week now, though she'd sent Harry an owl last night to say she was feeling much better and should be back to work soon. "Should I go alone or do you want me to take somebody else with me?"
Draco sighed, something resigned and wary and a little regretful crossing his face.
Harry flashed Draco a somewhat shaky smile. "You're right. Better to jump in quickly before I lose my nerve."
"Did you know," Draco finally said after a long pause, "that you're still wearing your little outfit?"
"Oh, Harry," Draco said, his voice softer and filled with regret. He stood up and reached out, tentatively at first, and then more boldly when it was clear Harry welcomed his advances. Draco pulled him off the armchair and into a hug, squeezing him tightly and pressing a kiss against the side of his head. "I'm sorry. I'm afraid I'm not very good at talking about my feelings." He stepped away, sliding his hands down to Harry's and tangling their fingers together as he looked him in the eye. "You asked what I get out of caring for you while you're in littlespace? Well, you're not the only one who gets into another headspace when we're in a scene. My childhood… it was charmed in a lot of ways, and I know that my parents loved me, but they weren't what I'd call demonstrative or affectionate. Hugs and 'I love yous' were rare occurrences, and more often than not, I was in the care of our house-elves. That kind of distant, slightly cold affection is my default, but I know that isn't what you need when you're little. I was worried I wouldn't be able to give you the care you deserve, but instead you've brought out a side to me that I didn't know I had. It gives me an immense amount of pleasure and satisfaction to be able to care for you, to receive your open and unguarded trust and to shower you with the kind of praise and warmth and devotion that I sometimes wish I'd had as a child. This isn't a one-way thing, Harry. I might not be playing the same role as you, or getting the exact same things out of it, but you're not the only one benefitting. I've
"Got a new case for you," Head Auror Robards announced as he stopped by Harry's desk.
"Spread a little wider for me, Harry," Draco said in that petal-soft purr of his, the one that made Harry want to drop to his knees and do whatever he commanded. He inched his legs a little wider, giving Draco better access, and Draco pressed a kiss to his thigh in approval as he began to slide a single finger inside.
"Less than expected," Malfoy replies. "It's very high quality. Swiss."
"Oh, you like that, don't you, sweetheart? You like being good for me, pleasing me."
"But…"
would be where she'd sneak out, though, some instinct that Harry had long since learned to trust. Anticipation thrummed through him, threaded through with something darker and more primal, a hunter waiting patiently for its prey.
"And yet somehow the rest of your colleagues manage to go entire months without gracing my examination room," Malfoy said with a sniff as he looked down at Harry's chart. "It says here you believe your arm is broken?"
The door burst open.
One down, then two, and Harry was working on the third while his allies duelled the others. Harry could vaguely hear the sound of sobbing and screams, and he wondered if the resistance had been escorting more civilians out when they'd been attacked, or if the anguished sounds were all in his head, echoes of past battles that wouldn't ever truly leave him. Either way, the sound only fuelled his inner fire, pushing him harder. Nothing existed beyond this moment, beyond the throbbing call for vengeance pulsing through him with each fevered beat of his heart.
Graham's jaw hardened. "Yes, yes, that should be fine. You actually might get better answers out of her if you speak to her now. Emily's got a history of blocking out past trauma, and the Healers at St Mungo's weren't able to get many details about the attack when she first came in. She was starting to respond to me a bit just before you got here."
Harry flushed. "I needed some space to think, and they're all always on me about going on holiday…"
"That's fine." Harry scans the parchment quickly before signing with a flourish. Their fingers brush as he hands back Malfoy's quill and a kick of adrenaline surges through him. Malfoy is infuriatingly handsome. "Did it give you any trouble?"
Draco's brow furrowed as he thought it over. "Yes," he said slowly. "I suppose the concepts are… similar."
Draco flapped his hands dismissively, his breathing speeding up and his hips shifting restlessly beneath Harry's bum, as if he was holding himself back from thrusting. "We can work out pet names later."
Harry didn't stay to hear more, just took off sprinting down the corridor towards the Apparition platform. He wasn't sure he'd ever felt so panicked, so terrified. Draco was supposed to be
"I can only imagine," Draco said kindly. "Is she too far down to speak to us? If not, and if it's within your limits, I assure you my partner and I won't judge. Since we're already here, it really would be preferable if we could speak to her now so that we can get to work on bringing her assailant to justice."
helping, that I'm making a difference. But I don't feel it here." He placed Draco's hand over his heart.
Healing spells are top notch," he said, pitching his voice into something earnest and complimentary.
dick and about to make things super uncomfortable. Draco, however, managed to solve this problem by not saying anything at all. Instead, he reached out and tugged Harry into another heated snog. Which was good,
Draco was still waiting for an answer, growing visibly more agitated by the second. "You don't have to, if you're not interested," he finally said, his voice strained. "I didn't mean—"
Harry's cheeks grew warm. "This, err, seemed like the kind of thing I shouldn't be late to."
, so empty. He hadn't set out to die, but he'd been living on borrowed time from the moment he came back from that platform seven years ago. He'd been ready then, and he was ready now.
She hesitated, but it seemed she'd decided to trust Harry. "This is my brother, Sean," she said, sounding frantic. "He's only three and hates crowds. I couldn't get him to leave when the Healers were ushering everybody out." He peeked out from behind her legs, his round face wet with tears. There was a bandage wrapped around one pudgy little arm.
"Hey," he said, trying to keep his voice low and soothing. "My name's Harry. Lady Foley's attacked this hospital and the resistance is working to bring the bad guys in. I'm here to help get everybody out safely. What's your name?"
There was rustling from within, a whimper and a shushing sound, and then a young face edged around the door, looking wary and defensive. The girl couldn't have been older than fifteen, her dark gold hair tied up in a hasty bun, a wand in one hand and the other pressed protectively out to her side, as if keeping somebody back and away from the open door. Harry put his hands up in a calming gesture, though he didn't let go of his wand; he needed it to be accessible should they be attacked.
it'll be worth it."
"So how do
"You're right, Draco, you're so fucking right, and I don't mean to imply that it isn't important or necessary. You know I've been helping Hermione with a lot of that here, and I'm not above using my influence to help, but I'm not built for that kind of activism, Draco, not long term. I hate it, and I'm not good at it. But fighting… that I know how to do. I'm meant to be out on the front lines."
Harry offers a sheepish smile. "Thought I'd see how it went."
"I hope you don't mind, but I've invited myself to spend the night."
Harry agreed. Then again, he also thought any government willing to acknowledge Lady Foley's claim to power and ignore the gross violations of human rights and decency she was committing daily must be a bit mad already. At least with power and greed.
Always so concerned for him. Harry tried not to clench his jaw. "Don't you?" Harry challenged.
Sometimes Draco feels like a Boggart. Like a shapeshifter, he's had to turn himself inside out to learn and unlearn, trying to discover who he is with the Malfoy stripped away. Then there's the way he seems to remind people of things they would prefer not to see: the Muggle-borns who leave Diagon Alley shops to avoid him, the former friends who distanced themselves shortly after the trials and the older generations who murmur,
Committed to his course, Harry dragged himself out of bed and hurriedly got dressed. He stopped at a café down the street for a flat white and a croissant, and was finished with both by the time he arrived at Finsbury Library. He settled in at one of the free public computers, cast a gentle Privacy Charm to prevent any nosy Nellies from getting an eyeful, and got to researching.
"Oh, oh
"Oh, not long. Twenty, thirty minutes maybe?"
Harry did, reluctantly, immediately losing himself in the grey depths.
who I've found this happiness with… Now that I've got you, I don't want to give you up, not for a second, not if there's any other option. I know it's selfish, wanting to keep you for myself, but I can't help it. The thought of losing you makes me crazy."
"So," Harry said, eager to change the subject. "Have you heard about what's been happening in Ireland?"
"I'm afraid I shouldn't stay much longer—it
There were several boxes stacked against the wall of the spare office, which Harry noticed had been mostly cleared of furniture. The boxes were glossy and covered with brightly coloured moving images of the toys contained within. Harry's gaze immediately went to the grouping of boxes that clearly contained the various Merlin action figures and accompanying sets, watching as knights raced around the corner of the largest box while a dragon swooped behind them. Harry's fingers itched and he bounded over to the box, tearing it open before freezing when he remembered the fact that these were technically Draco's toys and he should probably ask permission. He looked guiltily over his shoulder and Draco laughed.
Draco frowned, an adorable furrow forming between his brows. "My Healing spells are impeccable," Draco said with a sniff. "Your side probably looks better than it did before you got cut up."
"What kinds of toys?"
Harry chewed on his bottom lip before forcing himself to look at Draco and reply: "The second one."
"Okay," Draco said, clearly stunned and trying to process what Harry had said. "All right, I hadn't realised that was something you were worried about. If I've been unclear about how mad I am about you, then I should apologise."
"Me too," Harry replied, pulling Draco's arm more firmly across him as he thought once more of the ring in his desk, just waiting to be slid onto Draco's finger. "Me too."
"I'm so sorry, lad," he said, and he sounded it, too, though Harry knew he'd never fully approved of Harry's relationship with
Byrne had been feeding them information for the past few weeks, but thus far he'd not had much to offer. It was understandable that they might not trust their newest recruit with all their most sensitive information right off, but they didn't have time to wait around forever while Byrne proved his mettle. For Fathi to be calling an emergency meeting, it meant that Byrne must have finally brought something they could take action on.
Thankfully Byrne was experienced enough not to let the man's accusation get to him—Harry would have worried about his placement in Lady Foley's camp if he'd been ruffled. Working undercover required an unflappable temper and the ability to think on your feet.
"Oh, what are you doing here?" Malfoy asks when he exits, clearly startled.
"Ugh," Harry said with a petulant sigh. "More talking?"
"What? You know how bad it's getting over there! It's not exactly a surprise that I'd want to help."
Helpless anger and despair welled up inside of Harry, threatening to choke him even worse than the smoke filling his lungs. Hadn't they all suffered enough? Hadn't
thing) for competence—not to mention lithe physiques and fluency in snark and sarcasm—and getting to see first-hand how good Malfoy was at his job made Harry's heart race.
"Why don't you get on the bed for me, sweetheart." Harry shuddered at the endearment, his cock twitching appreciatively, and Draco's lips stretched into a satisfied smile. Draco nodded towards the bed. "Go on, then."
"All right, what seems to be the pro—
was really called, or what might be on offer, or what he even fully wanted. Draco might have had more experience in the world of BDSM, but he'd also admitted that this particular kink was outside his normal purview. They were due for a lengthy conversation, and Harry knew it would be soon, but he didn't want to go into it totally clueless. Harry could rely on Draco to guide him to some extent, but it would be a good idea to look into it himself as well.
much interested in seeing what other restraints they could play around with.
Draco nodded and gave Harry a gentle smile before leaning forward to brush a soft kiss against Harry's lips.
Draco couldn't be gone. This couldn't be real. That wasn't the last time he got to see Draco's face, to hold him in his arms, to see that smile. This was all just a dream. A nightmare.
"Right, shirt off, then," Malfoy said crisply, like asking Harry to strip off in his bedroom wasn't the kind of statement that could give a bloke
Harry growled, helpless frustration churning in his gut. "You know how I feel about it, Draco. You know I want to be over there fighting, making a difference!"
nice of Blaise to make the offer, but Harry didn't imagine he'd ever actually take him up on it.
again and see what happened.
"Agreed." Harry stood and grabbed his scarlet Auror robes off the hook next to his desk, shrugging them on before gesturing in the direction of the Ministry Atrium. "After you."
to make sure.
Or what was left of it.
"Can't. I've got to see a giant about a Mountain Troll." Potter holds out his hand. "Welcome to the team, Malfoy."
Malfoy flushes, his expression soft with surprise. "Is that really why you're here?"
"Yup, me."
"Can we—?" Harry broke off and took a deep breath. "Look, can we talk about this later? I'm not upset at you for pushing, that's part of your role here. I just need time to process, and in order to do that, I need some space."
Oh, sure, he'd gone out every day and explored nearby Florence, but the sights barely registered. The gorgeous city and scenery were leached of all colour and passion in his current state of mind.
"Back at their flat, you recognised him. Graham was all set to kick us out before you all but told him that you knew he was into some kinky shit and that we wouldn't say anything about it. He just looked like a normal bloke to me, so how did you know about the Daddy stuff?"
The building was in shambles, more a burning, charred mess of beams and metal than an actual structure. What was left of the centre appeared to still be on fire, with teams of wizards directing jets of water from their wands in an attempt to control the blaze. The air was thick with smoke. Harry's eyes began to water and he gagged before casting a charm to clear the air around him. Aurors and other Ministry officials milled around the perimeter that had been set, and Harry scanned the area, looking for the pearlescent bubble that, as per protocol, Aurors erected first thing to serve as a triage centre of sorts. Critical injuries would be treated there as necessary before the patients were transferred to St Mungo's, and those with lesser ailments could be found there too, receiving care while they waited to give their statements.
"That doesn't mean I want to sex to be entirely vanilla though."
So for now they were taking it slow and seeing where things went, feeling one another out to determine if the heat between them had any real potential or if it was just flashpaper, burning hot but brief. Harry knew it was smart not to rush into anything. He knew it was the reasonable,
Draco's lashes fluttered as his arse settled into the cradle of Harry's hips, Harry's cock buried to the hilt inside of him. His eyes slitted open, lazy and content as a Kneazle's, his smile equally indolent.
Draco barked a sudden laugh. "Oh, neither, really. I mean, I suppose I'd say I'm more like Graham than Emily, but you remember how I said the dynamics are different depending on what you're into?" Harry nodded, and Draco continued, "Well, most of the men I've been with weren't really coming to Draco Malfoy for the nurturing sort of Dom." He flashed a small, self-deprecating smile. "I can see the appeal of that kind of dynamic, for both parties"—he gave Harry a strangely penetrating stare—"and I've gone there a few times before for partners in the past, but it's never led to any kind of sustained arrangement."
Ron laughed. "Better let him tell you when he gets back from the loo. He seems legitimately narked off this time but it's Seamus, so…"
, seeing as how getting injured ended up with him half-naked in his bedroom with Draco Malfoy, maybe it wasn't
"No, Harry. You don't want to see that. There's not"—he cleared his throat—"there's no way to make a positive identification."
Draco's expression grew firm, though it was not unkind. "It's non-negotiable, Harry. It's obvious that you're out of sorts. That can happen after a scene, and it's something I should have prepared you for. I didn't"—he ran a hand over his face, looking tired and a bit guilty—"I just wanted to test the waters. I didn't expect you to become so affected, but I should have, and that's my fault for not properly preparing you."
"I wasn't
"I'm almost there," Draco continued, running his bottom lip through his teeth. "Be a love and wrap one of those big hands around my cock and help finish me off." It wasn't a suggestion, but Harry wouldn't have resisted even if it had been, more than willing to take hold of Draco's pretty, flushed dick. Draco groaned as Harry grabbed hold and began to stroke. "That's it, sweet boy, just like that. 'M so close. You've been so, so good."
"You said dinner was my choice so I brought Thai," Harry said, happy his hands were full so he couldn't brush his fingers wonderingly over the hot spot on his cheek where Draco had kissed him. He held up his bag of takeaway, the mouth-watering smell of Pad See Ew and Coconut Curry wafting from the plastic containers and providing a tempting distraction.
, looking even more fuckable than usual when he was within pouncing distance of Harry's mattress. Another throb of arousal pulsed through him and he swayed on his feet, feeling light-headed.
Harry reached for his fish and bit into the no-longer-searing morsel. It was delicious—crisp outside, soft and flaky inside—and he tried to focus on the warm, tasty food instead of the chaotic thoughts bouncing around in his mind. He was completely out of his depth with whatever they'd witnessed today, and he had so many
Harry,
The barman placed a foaming beer down in front of Harry and Harry handed over several Sickles before making his way back to the table. He settled into the free chair next to Blaise, who'd become a regular at these outings about six months ago when he and Ginny had started dating. Things had been a bit tense at first between him and the rest of the group, but he'd doggedly continued to show up, and eventually the tension had more or less eased. Harry had discovered, much to his surprise, that he and Blaise actually got on quite well. They'd formed a friendship of sorts, albeit not one that had progressed beyond the confines of pub night or the occasional Sunday lunch at the Burrow when they were both in attendance.
They made their way to Draco's living room, sitting down together on the sofa close enough that Harry was painfully aware of every move Draco made, though not quite close enough to touch. Draco turned on the telly and flicked through the channels, finally settling on some kind of baking competition that made Harry's mouth water despite the fact that he was currently stuffing his face with food. They both relaxed, eating and drinking wine and chatting about their week as Muggles panicked about deflating soufflés. It was nice, comfortable, almost like hanging out with any of Harry's other mates, besides the persistent desire to reach out and run his fingers through Draco's hair. That, and the flashes of the various fantasies Harry had been having over the past week, ever since that fateful interview, that kept popping into Harry's head and making his heart race.
"Fuck," Draco growled, his hips continuing to bounce on Harry's slowly softening prick as he batted Harry's limp hand out of the way and began to fist himself quickly. It didn't take much longer before he reached his own climax, his arse clamping down around Harry as he spilled onto Harry's stomach.
Now that the fight was over, Harry felt empty and drained, all of the buzzing adrenaline gone in a flash. He should feel elated. They'd not only captured Foley but quite a few of her top followers to boot. With any luck this would all be over soon. Instead, Harry only felt a creeping sense of numb dread, which he tried to shake off as best he could as he listened to Fathi bark instructions on taking their prisoners back to the dungeons at his family Manor. With Foley captured there was an endless list of things to do in order to take back the Ministry and Harry didn't envy Fathi his task. He hadn't realised back when he'd been fighting his Voldemort just how much more there was to war than simply capturing the main baddie. It gave him a greater appreciation for Dumbledore and all the work he'd done, the many weights he'd had to balance and manage. It wasn't an easy job, nor a simple one, and though there'd been times when Harry had resented Dumbledore for his manipulations and secrets, he understood his task better now, that he'd done the best he could to fight for the greater good, taking responsibility for making the tough calls so that others wouldn't have to.
"Easy there," Draco murmured, running his hands through Harry's hair and tugging a little to get him to slow down. "There's no rush."
good. Harry hadn't ever been a patient man, but something told him Draco would be worth waiting for.
Malfoy sighed. "Why on earth are you so determined to date me? Have you forgotten the fact that we don't actually get on? Childhood rivals? Opposite sides of a war? Hero and villain? Does any of this ring any bells?"
suffered enough? Was he doomed to bring death with him wherever he went, leaving a path of devastation in his wake?
Harry grinned at the thought, a gentle wave of desire cresting over him as he thought about all the filthy things he wanted to do with Draco. It had only been a couple of days since they'd last been together, but Merlin had Harry missed Draco's mouth. And his arse. And his cock. And
Harry couldn't allow that to happen.
"Right on time," he murmured, his tone amused. "How unlike you."
"All right," Fathi said after a long moment. His voice was rough, his eyes glistening strangely in the low hallway light. There was something oddly foreboding in his tone, a grim finality that shivered down Harry's spine but didn't alter his resolve. Fathi straightened and gestured towards the main hall.
understand that whatever it was she was telling Fathi, she was backing Harry up, and he felt a rush of gratefulness to her.
. Harry did his best not to judge, but it seemed so bizarre. Did Emily truly enjoy giving control to somebody else, playing with toys and pretending to be a child while her partner, whom she called
Harry was happy, and he wasn't planning to give it up, not even if his friends disapproved.
"Oh, yeah, I'm fine," Harry muttered. She gave him a sceptical glance that sent a pang right through him. He and Parvati had grown quite close over their years working together as Aurors, and closer still since they'd both come over to Ireland, but she wasn't Ron or Hermione. Her gentle concern, while touching, mostly just served to make Harry miss his best mates all the more. It didn't feel right, fighting a war without them by his side. He knew why they couldn't come, given Rose was still just a baby and Hermione was pregnant again with their second child—he would have stopped them himself if either had tried to volunteer. But this was the longest he'd ever gone without seeing either of them in person, and he missed them.
don't want to go to St Mungo's."
before announcing it to all and sundry. Besides, Harry couldn't help but remember his friends' frosty reception of Blaise when Ginny had first brought him around, and he wasn't even a Marked Death Eater the way Draco was, nor had he been so personally nasty to them back at Hogwarts. Everybody Harry cared about had plenty of reasons to despise Draco Malfoy, and though Harry didn't plan on keeping him a secret forever, he couldn't help but be wary of the inevitable growing pains that would follow the announcement they were together.
Before he could talk himself out of it Harry folded up the lists and stuffed them into an envelope, scrawling Draco's name on the outside. He cast just about every privacy charm he could think of on the bundle, ensuring that Draco would be the only person who could see what was inside. He whistled for Apocrypha, the brown owl of unknown origin that had shown up at Grimmauld Place a few years ago out of the blue, apparently deciding to adopt Harry as her own. He attached the envelope to her leg and told her to go straight to Draco Malfoy, and was promptly overcome with doubt the second she disappeared out of sight.
Draco seemed to understand, giving Harry a kind smile and another ruffle of his hair. "Why don't we start with the action figures? I… may have gone a little overboard and purchased all of the accompanying sets and settings to go with the figures. We can use the other study to set up the castle, enchanted forest, and town village."
they need. Even more than money, what they really need is a shift in ideology. They need people to continue to do the hard and unseen work for years to come so that they don't have another uprising and a bloody repeat of history. Hell, we still need that here." He gestured furiously as he paced, the Dark Mark on his arm standing in sharp relief against his pale skin. "It took less than twenty years for Voldemort to regain power and restart the same fucking war with the same exact principles in the same fucking country! And he was able to do that because we let him! Our culture and society was built on the idea of blood purity and magical power, and people like me and my family were still here and ready to take up the cause the moment Voldemort came back. The people opposed to him the first time around were content with his death, as if he was just one bad egg and with him gone they could go back to the status quo, as if the status quo wasn't what allowed Voldemort to gain power in the first place."
He looked down at his regular clothes and debated pulling them on over his pants, but the thought of being curled up with Draco skin-to-skin was unbelievably appealing. Harry felt a bone-deep need inside himself to be as close to Draco as he could get, so he grabbed his clothes in a bundle under his arm and made his way to Draco's bedroom.
"Harry?" Parvati prompted when he didn't respond, her tone more concerned as she gave him a gentle nudge that pulled him from his musings.
"Okay," Harry said, nuzzling his nose briefly into Draco's soft hair before stepping back and pulling off his shirt. Their discussion had interrupted their preparations for bed, but Harry was ready to be out of his clothes for the day. "I can't promise I won't still feel the urge to go over there, but I
Harry grinned, pleased that Draco had made the decisions and was excited to play. He followed Draco out of the room and down the hall, marvelling at the change that had come over Draco, the subtle shift of energy. Harry had been worried that he wouldn't be able to see Draco as anything other than his boyfriend, but from the moment they'd decided to play, something changed within them both. The connection between them was altered in a way that was hard to define. The man in front of him was still Draco, but he was different, too. This Draco made Harry feel comforted and safe, he made him feel small—not in a bad way, but like Harry was something precious to be protected. Not that Draco usually made him feel uncomfortable or unsafe. Harry trusted the man with his life; he had to, in their line of work. But the things Harry felt for Draco, the desire and admiration, the thought that
Before Draco, Harry hadn't ever wanted anything like this, hadn't craved a—a
Draco nodded, and Graham held open the door, ushering them inside.
Once again, the silence dragged on between them, and Draco bit his lip, his expression nervous and unsure.
They hadn't snogged since the end of their first date, when they shared that goodnight kiss that had made Harry's toes curl inside his boots. Harry had had plenty of time in the intervening week to dream about the next one, and somehow this kiss was even better, slow and thorough, gradually building heat until Harry thought he would combust on the spot. He tangled a hand in Draco's hair, angling him closer while his other hand slid down Draco's back to grab hold of his perfect arse. He tugged until Draco's body was flush against his, shuddering as he felt the hard evidence of Draco's arousal nudged up against his own hardening dick. They'd said they were going to take things slow, and Harry was pretty sure this didn't qualify, but right that moment Harry didn't care. He wanted this, wanted
a schoolboy. Just hearing Malfoy's name from Robards had Harry melting in his seat, giddy anticipation flooding his system at the thought of getting to spend the day with him. Which was probably a bit fucked up, considering they were spending time together to interview a likely traumatised young witch about her recent assault.
looking at the lists meant he stayed up half the night anyway, tossing and turning in bed
"Oh… a week?" Harry's not sure what suddenly has Malfoy wrong-footed, but Harry's happy for him to lose some of that veneer of indifference. He flashes Malfoy another broad smile, his own heart skipping a beat when Malfoy smiles back at him, small and tentative.
"Which has been our aim all along, and thus far we've not had an opportunity for it," Parvati said, her eyes narrowing, apparently taking umbrage with some aspect of Fathi's delivery. "I take it something's changed?"
Draco nodded, seeming somewhat relieved. "That's understandable. And that actually brings me to the first thing I wanted to discuss. I need you to choose a safe word. It should be something that's easy for you to remember, but not something that you might say accidentally in conversation."
was certainly looking forward to finally letting go of the stress he'd been carrying over how badly he wanted his friends to get on with his boyfriend. Apparently he'd missed the mark, however, because Draco pulled back and stared at him, his eyes wide with sudden worry.
Harry blinked up at the ceiling, his eyes dry and aching from the complete lack of sleep. Judging by the light now pouring in from his window and the birds chirping far-too-loudly outside, it was now officially morning and Harry was no closer to figuring out what the hell he wanted. He'd tried to sleep on it, but sleep had evaded him. Instead, he'd spent hours lying in bed, his stomach churning and thoughts racing.
Harry moaned and sucked harder, unable to tear his gaze away from Draco's hypnotic eyes.
"I can live with that," Draco said, stepping close and running his hands appreciatively over Harry's bare chest. "It's just… against all odds—our history, your fame, my infamy, my family and upbringing,
, and then he'd need to move to Antarctica where there would be plenty of snow to cool his permanently flushed face. No, if he wanted books on the subject, he'd definitely need to get them in Muggle London.
It's Harry's turn to flush. "I thought I'd take you up on that drink, actually, if you're free?"
"As lovely as that would no doubt be, this was just for you. It really is getting late, and I've got an early start tomorrow."
"Oh, can I?" Draco said with amusement, but he obediently switched his attention back to the book hovering in front of him. Harry smiled as Draco's cool voice washed over him a moment later, watching as the pretty lights formed a bright and playful Crup.
"Might do," Seamus began, a gleam in his eye. "Let's say,

feeling surprisingly well-rested; usually naps left him feeling more exhausted than before, but right now he felt invigorated.
"Of course you'd be hung like a bloody Hippogriff," Draco continued, his voice low and lips twisted into a smug little smirk that made Harry's dick throb in Draco's hands. "I can't wait to watch this big cock of yours swing while you're bouncing up and down on
It didn't take long to finish out the fight after that, the ending sudden and rather anticlimactic. Fathi managed to incapacitate Foley with a Stunning Charm that Parvati expertly followed up with an
Was Harry interested in punishment and discipline? How did he feel about spanking? Did he want a dummy or a bottle? Did he want to wear a
"What about you?" Harry finally managed, his gaze catching on the bulge in Draco's trousers. His mouth watered at the thought of getting a good look at Draco's cock, at putting his mouth on him and returning the favour.
Draco nodded. "That's absolutely normal. I've been involved in the community for years and I never would have got far if somebody hadn't taken me under their wing and showed me the ropes"—he smirked—"in my case, quite literally. I know it's overwhelming, so if you have any questions, please ask me. If I don't know the answer, I have other resources. I want to make sure this is good for you, Harry, whatever comes from it. Your comfort is paramount."
as rubbish, preferring to read other, more reputable, papers, though they'd both maintained their subscriptions to keep a pulse on what was being said there. It was rare that either of them took it at all seriously.
"Oi, Harry," Ron called from across the table. "Seamus has an Auror question for you."
"I just thought, given… I mean I know that your…" Fathi floundered, uncharacteristically at a loss for words. He exchanged a loaded look with Parvati that Harry couldn't interpret. Harry growled.
"Good?"
turned out perfectly, well worth the lingering ache in his arm from all that stirring. He was sure Molly could have told him a spell to keep the wooden spoon moving, but there was something about doing it himself that made it taste all the better. Besides, he enjoyed the ritual of doing it by hand.
, partially because he couldn't help but remember how good it had felt, how happy and relaxed he'd been doodling at Draco's feet. As much as he wanted to instinctively deny the whole episode as an aberration never to be repeated, there was a part of him that cried out at the thought of never getting to experience that freedom again. Draco was right. He needed time to think.
He had quite enough on his mind lately as it was.
Harry's heart leaps as he gestures towards the Atrium. He wonders what it is about Malfoy that has him so intrigued and why he can't stop staring at his shoulders. When Malfoy offers him a small smile, Harry smiles back.
"I'll see you at work, okay?" Harry said, not turning around as he walked out the door. He didn't want to see the emotions on Draco's face that had made him sound so defeated when he'd said Harry's name.
Harry reached for his wand, Conjuring a palmful of lube and reaching down between them to pet Draco's hole. Something about the unique feeling of that wrinkled rim always ramped up Harry's lust even more, and he slowly eased a finger inside, relishing the tight heat. He knew Draco enjoyed the stretch of being fucked open, so Harry didn't spend too much time fingering him, just long enough to get him slick.
Salazar, Draco loved winning.
his father, couldn't be further from him in fact, so would it really be so wrong to play pretend?
not regulation. Harry raised a brow, shocked and oddly pleased at the small show of rebellion. Draco's cheeks tinged pink, but he ignored Harry's pointed glance at his socks in favour of a proper greeting.
"All right, then. Care to share with the class?"
"I think the victim's flat is just a couple of streets away," Draco said, glancing down at the file that he must have taken from Harry at some point while Harry was distracted by Draco's… everything. He started off at a brisk pace down the road, and Harry scurried after him. Draco wasn't more than an inch or two taller than Harry but it was apparently all in his legs, and Harry had to practically run to keep up with his stride.
Harry swallowed, his gaze locked on the folded parchments Draco had set on the coffee table.
"Harry," Draco began, clearly concerned, but Harry waved him off.
bloody delicious.
surprising was just how appealing the thought was. He'd never been a particularly jealous person, but it had hurt as a child, seeing Dudley with a shiny new outfit every week, clothes he'd use and discard without thought or consequence while Harry was stuck with the same three, faded shirts. By the time Harry had money of his own to spend he was off to Hogwarts, where there was not only a uniform but an entirely different manner of dress, where people wore robes instead of jeans and flashy T-shirts. Harry had never liked drawing attention to himself, so he'd stuck with muted, solid colours, even if his gaze occasionally strayed towards something loud and flashy,
"After, then." Harry shrugs. "I'll buy you a drink."
side.
The only thing Harry was clear on was that he needed more time. Time to get his head on straight, to figure out if he could come to terms with these things his heart wanted that his head told him were wrong, or if he could live without them now that he'd had a chance to experience them. Neither option sounded particularly appealing, and there was a rumbling anxiety thrumming through him saying the clock was counting down on making his choice. Harry felt like shouting, begging the world to just…
who was giving it to him, the bloke he'd been pretending not to have a crush on for ages now…
"Ready?" Draco asked, settling his arm comfortingly around Harry's shoulders. Harry nodded, burrowing more firmly against Draco's chest.
Harry let out a somewhat sheepish laugh as he picked up his spoon. "No, it's great! I was just… distracted. You seemed like you were enjoying it enough for the both of us."
"Essentially, yes. They were in the middle of an ageplay scene. Part of the appeal for the submissive in that kind of relationship is the opportunity to let go of all the responsibility of the adult world and drop into a headspace that's more childlike and carefree. Playing with dolls and dressing up in bows and frilly dresses and knowing that she has a Daddy to care for and protect her helps get Emily into that place. And it sounds like she was in particular need of it after the attack."
Draco huffed a laugh. "You're usually a better liar than that."
"You want us to attack before she leaves," Harry said, knowing his grin was a little too wide. The plan was risky, but these days Harry lived for a bit of danger to break up the monotony. "It's going to be a tight window between when she leaves the protection of the Foley Manor wards and when her Portkey activates. And she'll be on the lookout for trouble."
Their relationship was never going to be simple, but things between them had become so intense so quickly, and Harry couldn't have anticipated the additional confusion that the kink had thrown into the mix. Every time Harry had thought he'd made his peace with it—that there was nothing wrong or shameful about his desires—he remembered the hot shuddery feeling he'd felt at the idea of calling Draco
Several years ago that retort would have got Harry's back up, but he knew Draco well enough by now to be aware that he got extra supercilious and snarky when he was freaking out. It was something Draco had been working on and, sure enough, he shot Harry a regretful look a moment later.
Harry gasped, his hips twitching upwards. He liked it when Draco looked at him like that, liked it when he called him baby.
Draco's lips twitched. "Ah, yes. I suppose that would be… prudent. I'd hate for Weasley to come after me should your wounds reappear in the night."
"Be careful," she said, and Harry was off, disappearing back into the smoky, perilous hospital.
"Take me to bed," Harry murmured against Draco's lips, too addicted to his kisses to pull away entirely.
Draco's lips pulled into a reluctant frown, but if he knew Harry at all, he'd know that Harry wasn't about to let this one go. He sighed, seeming to come to that very conclusion.
Harry's eyes went wide with shock and he made to pull off Draco's cock, his cheeks flaming, but Draco shook his head and clenched his fingers in Harry's hair, stilling him. It was just enough to indicate his preference before he immediately unclenched, letting Harry know he could pull off if he really wanted to, if it made him too uncomfortable. Harry hesitated.
Harry narrowed his eyes. It wasn't like Fathi to be so accommodating, and after doing everything in his power to keep Harry away from Foley, it didn't make sense why he would suddenly be giving Harry full control over her safety.
"Just think about whatever you've got planned for us after we get back from dinner," he said in a throaty murmur, nuzzling into Draco's neck. "It'll be our reward for making it through in one piece."
thing to do, but fuck if he wasn't already tired of waiting. One date, and Harry was all dreamy sighs and stomach flutters, feeling more like a schoolboy with his first crush than he'd ever felt when he was
Draco let out a rumbling growl of approval that made Harry's entire body grow warm with pleasure. Draco's fingers wrapped briefly around the nape of Harry's neck and gave a comforting squeeze, and the lingering tension Harry had been carrying melted away. He was safe here. There was nothing to worry about.
"All right, then. I'll see you tomorrow?"
"I'm not an imbecile." Draco clutches the letter and meets Potter's eyes. "Do you want a… drink?"
, you're keen."
"Later?"
His hand found his dick, sliding slowly up and down as he coated it with the rest of the lube, hypnotising Harry with his movements. Fuck, but Harry wanted to get his mouth on him, wanted to feel that thick length on his tongue, but that would have to wait for another day. Tonight, he'd rather have it in his arse, and he spread his legs a little wider just to make that fact abundantly clear. Draco huffed out a laugh as he shuffled close, rubbing his cock along the cleft of Harry's arse.
Draco's cheeks flushed a pale pink with pleasure, and all Harry wanted to do was reach out and muss him up further. "That makes me very happy to hear. It's important that we're on the same page and imperative that we trust one another or it won't work. As I've mentioned, the world of kink is vast. Even within ageplay there is a broad spectrum of activities which may or may not appeal."
changed, or if he'd just become a much better actor, but he found himself hoping it was the former. "I'm not asking you to marry me, I just want one date. If it's awful, then we don't have to go on another, and I'll even stop pestering you about it."
before pressing it into Harry's hands.
at the end went unsaid, but not unheard.
As with the first list, Harry worked his way through, trying not to be a judgemental twat over some of the activities as he marked them down as a hard limit. Others had a much more pleasurable effect, making Harry squirm in his seat and warming his body with a mixture of arousal and shame as he wrote
"Sorry, Parvati, but would you mind if we pick this up later? The battle's left me wiped out and if I don't get some sleep now I'm worried I'll pass right out. I want to make sure I'm up tomorrow in time for the interrogations."
on some of the scenarios that had been dominating Harry's thoughts.
"Are you close?" Draco asked as his thrusts became faster, harder.
"Is she playing?" Draco asked quietly, and Harry glanced over at him in confusion, baffled by the sudden line of inquiry.
Harry had to rescue them. He couldn't let another person die, not if there was a chance he could save them.
Harry hadn't ever had a proper parent, nor a traditional childhood. There'd been nobody to love him unconditionally, nobody to make him feel safe and cared for and adored. The only toys he'd had to play with were Dudley's broken hand-me-downs, useless and discarded, castoffs much like Harry himself had been. He usually did his best not to think about it; there was no use crying over the past, especially given all the true horrors he'd eventually had to live through. Yet the pain of it had lingered like a bruise, forgotten until pressed against, bringing forth a tender ache.
Harry's face scrunched. Come up?
Unfortunately, as they made their way down the stairs and came out onto the main floor, it was clear that the reception area was one of the locations Foley's followers had targeted. They were hit with a sudden wave of heat as Harry pushed open the door, and Harry pulled Cara down to the ground, getting them beneath the thick cloud of smoke and ash that hovered in the burning air. There was a tipped-over supply cart next to them, and Harry grabbed a slightly singed bedsheet, severing it into squares and doused each with an
"I'm into it," Harry said, adjusting his position until he was lying on Draco's stomach, looking down at him with heated eyes. "I like it when you're in control." His cheeks grew warm but he pressed on. "I'm not sure I want a proper scene just yet, but I like the idea of playing around a little bit with some of those activities I said I was interested in."
"Of course not," Harry said miserably. That was part of the problem. "I get it, you're an understanding bloke when it comes to kink—or whatever the hell that just was. But in case
starting to feel a bit light-headed. Not that he was going to admit as much to Malfoy. He might have changed from the horrid boy he'd been at Hogwarts, grown into somebody decent and competent and unfairly fit, but that didn't mean Harry was keen to show him any weakness.
"No laughing." Potter shakes his head. "Maybe the first time, mind."
"It is when you're a pure-blood Slytherin," Draco said with a shrug and a shaky grin.
Draco nodded slowly. "Of course. I'll wait right here for you." He sat in the armchair in the corner by the window.
Quill in hand, he went back to the beginning of the list and began to slowly make his way down, pausing at each activity and really trying to picture it before making his decision and writing his preference. Heat began to ebb and flow within him as he imagined all kinds of kinky, sexy scenarios—interspersed with less enjoyable possibilities—and he learned a whole lot more about himself and his desires than he'd been expecting. Like that the idea of wearing a collar was a shockingly hot image, and that he apparently wasn't entirely opposed to a bit of edgeplay. There were quite a lot of hard limits—anything involving intense pain or another person were immediately out—which once again made Harry worry that he was being too particular, that there wouldn't be enough activities left for Draco to enjoy. He had to remind himself that Draco had said he'd be content even if kink was off the table entirely, but it didn't stop the little niggles of worry from burrowing deep.
Harry nodded. "Yes, you're much smarter than that. So smart, in fact, that you'll see the wisdom in finally agreeing to go out with me. This Friday at eight?"
"Why, because I like being in control?" He swivelled his hips and clenched around Harry's cock, a smooth, graceful move than had Harry moaning with pleasure. Draco smirked. "Having a cock up my arse doesn't change that." His gaze softened and he reached down to cup Harry's cheek. Harry nuzzled into the touch. "I'm still calling the shots, aren't I, baby?"
, Parvati, and I've questioned my share of witnesses. It's a little insulting that you all keep acting like I'm going to fly off the handle at any moment. What the hell are we here for if Fathi doesn't make use of us?"
Malfoy had been brought on as a Curse-Breaker consultant three months ago, when Ron and Harry had first been assigned the case. In a surprising show of foresight, the DMLE decided having a Curse-Breaker on hand would probably be helpful when taking down the country's largest underground Dark and cursed object auction house. Malfoy, with his particular history and skillset, was a logical choice, and Harry'd had no choice but to accept Malfoy back into his life once more. Sure, Harry had been aware of Malfoy: he'd unable to avoid hearing talk of his brilliant work from Bill during dinners at the Burrow; he'd seen flashes of his white-blond hair at every charity gala Harry had gone to; and he had listened to Hermione's grudging praise of the lobbying he'd been doing for anti-blood-purity legislation. It had all painted a very different picture of Malfoy from the one Harry'd had in his head, and he'd had to work hard to fight off the instinctive curiosity to find out more. Malfoy was a part of his past, no matter how interesting (and fit) he seemed to be these days.
"Morning." Malfoy gives Harry the quick once over, his cheeks taking on the familiar dusky hue from the week before. "Your watch is ready. I need a signature here and here." Malfoy unfurls a roll of parchment, pointing at the places Harry needs to sign. "The cost is ten Galleons for labour and parts."
Harry didn't answer, just grinned up at him before swallowing him down. Draco bit back a groan and threw his head back against the wooden scaffolding, threading a hand through Harry's wild curls to try and keep himself steady as Harry sucked him off.
There was no need to panic.
family and upbringing—we found each other. I never could have imagined this, that we'd make such a good partnership. After the war… well, I didn't think I'd ever be worthy of
"Well I happen to have a villa in Italy. Tuscany, wine country, absolutely gorgeous," Blaise continued blithely. "I'd be happy to let you stay there if you ever get the urge. Just let me know."
"Salazar, what a bloody nightmare. I was really hoping we'd have a bit longer to figure things out between us before I scared you off with the whole kink thing. I mean…" He paused and made a face before seeming to force himself to continue as he met Harry's gaze, "I still want to see where this thing goes." He gestured between them. "We both know the odds are stacked against us, but I don't want this to be the straw that breaks the camel's back. If it freaks you out, I promise it's not something we ever have to pursue. We can forget about it"
"I'm fine," Harry snapped, guilt prickling at him immediately at Parvati's hurt expression. He softened his tone as he continued, "Sorry, but I'm all right, really. You know that stuff's addictive, and I don't like the way it knocks me out." For every nightmare Harry had, there was an amazing dream to balance it out, dreams of home, of his friends, of the man he'd left behind. They were the closest Harry had to the real thing, and he wasn't giving that up.
The manor butted up against a large forest, and given the natural cover it provided, they'd decided to have the majority of their strike team waiting for Foley in a secluded clearing they estimated would be her most likely point of exit. Fathi had stationed a few other groups at other possible locations around the perimeter of the manor, and Harry had provided each team leader with an updated version of the message coins Hermione had created for the DA back at Hogwarts so that they could communicate as soon as Foley and her team made an appearance. Something told Harry that
"It's a sort of informal or casual gathering in a neutral space, like a park or a café. Basically, it's just a hangout session with like-minded, kinky people minus the leather and bondage gear. It's great for introductions and a low-pressure way to meet people and get involved in the scene without jumping straight into something a bit more intense or explicit."
Harry had no intention of stopping, not until they were both sticky and sated. Draco felt so fucking
In his heavy, sluggish mind, Harry had the thought that he might be dying. The idea of it was accompanied by a profound sense of relief.
"No, I can do it on my own."
Harry hadn't ever made that connection before. He'd never considered that Draco might have struggled with his own desires the way that Harry had been struggling with his. He always seemed so confident and sure.
"Good," Draco said with satisfaction, and then he leaned in and kissed Harry.
Harry's orgasm came out of nowhere, triggered unexpectedly by Draco's unending praise.
All too soon they reached Draco's doorstep, and though Harry's body was yearning to be invited up, he knew it wouldn't be happening tonight. That was all right. He felt confident that it
Harry obeyed without question, suddenly realising as Draco spoke how incredibly thirsty he was. He took a massive gulp before Draco chided him to take smaller sips. Something about the gentle yet commanding tone of Draco's voice was irresistible, and Harry followed his instruction, taking tiny drinks until the glass was entirely drained. As he sipped, clarity slowly began to return to him, a veil slipping from his mind that he hadn't even fully known was there.
Harry sighed and attempted to tune back in to the conversation around him, only to realise everybody was leaving. The majority of the resistance members had their own homes and lives to manage, keeping their participation in the resistance under wraps—it was only Fathi, Harry, Parvati, and the increasing number of people who Foley had attempted to arrest or kill who stayed under Fathi's manor protections full-time. Luckily the house was massive—and Unplottable—so there was plenty of space for those that were there, and room for more as Lady Foley drove others underground. But they couldn't hide behind Fathi's wards forever, and Harry was itching for a proper fight. Unlike Voldemort, there were no Horcruxes that prevented her from dying for good, and no mystic prophecy foretelling her downfall could only come at the hands of a teenager. All they needed was to work out her movements in advance so they could attack when she was least expecting it.
what she thought. He stiffened and made to push himself up, but she reached out, grabbing his arm and pulling him down.
"So what's next?"
Malfoy hesitates but eventually nods. "Sure, why not."
"Yes," Draco said grimly. "The
A pang of loss and longing went through him, but those were more emotions he couldn't entertain right now. He needed to get these children to safety; everything else could wait.

a hospital and they still had to treat patients.
"All right," Draco said several minutes later as he finished casting the spell. The lone bead of sweat dripping down his forehead was the only sign of the effort he'd just expended in healing Harry with his magic. "You should be all set."
do that." Draco took another sip of his wine, settling himself more comfortably on the sofa. Harry hadn't realised how tense Draco had been before now, and it made some of Harry's own tension ease knowing he wasn't the only one who was nervous and unsure. "As I've said before, I've only dabbled in this particular subsection of kink. But I've been doing some more research and spoke to a friend of mine who's more experienced with the Daddy/little dynamic."
"What do you want?" Harry asked in between kisses as they rocked together, hard cocks catching and sliding in the most delightful ways. Tonight, Harry wanted it all to be about Draco, wanted to spoil him and give him whatever he wanted.
Harry didn't bother drawing things out, they were both too far gone for that. He nestled the rounded head of his cock into the cleft of Draco's arse, feeling around for his arsehole before pressing steadily inside as he stared into Draco's eyes. This was one of his favourite parts of fucking Draco, if he had to choose. Harry loved watching his expressive face when Harry first pressed inside, observing his micro-expressions as Harry sank all the way in, filling Draco up. It was all there, the pain and pleasure, the overwhelming intensity of being so full, the trust and the love as Draco opened himself up to Harry. It was beautiful, and humbling; it made Harry want to offer Draco the world.
"I'll do it," she said immediately, bending down to scoop him into her arms. "I've got him."
All week he'd carried the black ring box with him in his pocket, a small, steady weight to remind him of his plans, his future. He'd been planning this for months but as the event grew nearer, Harry became more frazzled, eager for the day to finally arrive. Harry firecalled Draco every night, and it was clear Draco knew there was something going on with Harry, though he'd thankfully left it alone beyond a couple of penetrating looks. They knew each other well enough by now to know when to push and when to wait for the other person to come to them. Harry hoped Draco was able to hold off just one more day because Harry wasn't sure he wouldn't blurt the question right out with the slightest provocation. A part of Harry would have almost preferred that—the wait was positively killing him—but he'd been planning this moment for far too long not to see it through now.
"I lost track of time," Harry said with a sheepish smile that quickly turned teasing. "Sorry, Daddy."
"Come on then, the kitchen's this way."
"Malfoy, can you make sure he gets himself checked out?"
It's a surprise to find Potter standing on the Manor doorstep with a smile on his face. His easy manner does nothing to suggest that seeing Draco reminds Potter of their acrimonious past.
headlines was enough to make Harry break out into a cold sweat.
me that, and I didn't know if I could handle going without."
"Okay," Harry replied softly. "We'll talk. After we've
She leaned against the door jam, waiting as he tugged on a pair of shoes and threw a set of
"Yeah," Harry breathed, his skin growing warm as Draco trailed his fingers over Harry's body, looking into his eyes with love and heat. "I don't want to lose you either, Draco. I
Harry pulled back and beamed at him, and Draco blinked in apparent surprise before his own face melted into a matching grin.
"I didn't get on with the person you were when we were back at Hogwarts, but I know full well people can change," Harry said. He wasn't sure yet whether or not Malfoy
"I can see that," Draco said, letting out a moan as Harry cupped his cock. "And you can't wait until we get somewhere more private?"
"Listen, Harry—" Parvati began urgently, but all this talk of Draco had given Harry the urge to write to him immediately. He might not be able to tell Draco about his heroic capture, but he could talk about other things. He could tell Draco how much he missed him, how sorry he was for coming to fight this war instead of staying home. How sometimes he wondered if he'd made a mistake. He could beg for forgiveness and daydream of what it would be like to hold Draco in his arms once more. All of that sounded better than thinking about the monster they currently had locked up in the dungeons below.
"Wait!" Harry called before Malfoy could leave. Malfoy heaved a heavy sigh before turning around with the air of somebody greatly put upon as Harry continued, "What are you doing this Friday?"
