He hadn’t intended on getting a cat. He never particularly liked them, but when a kitten started following him home from his daily runs and started sleeping on his doorstep, he couldn’t exactly refuse to let her in. She was so skinny and her big green eyes were hard to say no to, so Harry had found any leftovers he had in his almost empty fridge and let her eat as much as she wanted. Then he had asked Hermione if she wanted a pet since he knew she liked cats. She had agreed to take her off his hands but when she came to pick her up, she had escaped her clutches as soon as she tried to take her out the door, running back to Harry every time. Hermione had been more offended by the rejection than she had let on.
“It’s not really,” Hermione interjected. “He’s not going to go picking a fight with Harry after everything that’s happened.”
“I don’t see any reason why you two can’t share a room. You are both adults and I hope you are mature enough to be civil with each other. And Mr Malfoy knows well enough that any harm he causes you will result in expulsion. You will be fine Harry.” He was sure the pointed look McGonagall gave Malfoy was meant as a warning, though he could have been imagining it.
He had tried to let the boy rant at him until he felt satisfied enough to let Draco walk away but that only seemed to annoy him more. Then, when he had pushed him painfully against the stone wall, Potter had appeared around the corner as if he had some sort of sixth sense of when someone was in trouble.
“Go back to sleep Draco,” Harry whispered, somehow knowing without looking that Draco hadn’t followed his lead and was still staring intently at him. Draco had never liked the sound of his own name more than when it slipped from Harry’s lips, almost as if by accident. Finally, Draco copied him, forcing himself to squeeze his eyes closed and be fully consumed by darkness. He focused on the sound of soft puffs of air escaping Harry’s slightly parted lips, letting it relax him until his heartbeat had calmed down and he was drifting off into a dreamless sleep.
Maybe it was the lack of sleep clouding his judgement, or maybe he really had come to enjoy Malfoy’s company more than he had anticipated, that lead to him asking-or telling really-Malfoy to walk with him. Either way, he didn’t regret it. He’d never felt more awake than he did flying around with Malfoy with the sound of their laughter mixing with the wind rushing past his ears.
This was too much. He could deal with Harry deciding they were the ‘best of friends’ but he drew the line at
"What are they for?" he asked as Potter dug through his trunk until he pulled out a bundle of silky material and a worn piece of parchment. Instead of answering he unfolded the bundle so Draco could see it was a cloak, then he wrapped it around his shoulders, his body seemingly vanishing. "Ah, of course you have an invisibility cloak. What about that ancient piece of parchment?"
"I didn't bring my quidditch robes," he said when Potter shrugged off the cloak and opened the door to the broom shed and changing rooms. "Or broom."
Harry let out a soft laugh and didn’t reply. Harry listened as Malfoy turned page after page-he was a quick reader, Harry observed. Harry blamed Malfoy’s warming charm for how quickly his mind started to drift in and out of a dream, his breaths evening out. Soon enough, he was asleep.
He tore his eyes from Harry’s chest and to his face and realised Harry was speaking. He was honestly proud that he was able to understand a word of it.
“Oh, come on. It’s not that bad.” Harry grabbed Draco’s arm and yanked him up. “You have to eat something.”
Potter only started to stir another hour and a half later. He was relieved. He’d started to think he might have to wake him up himself. He had already missed breakfast, but Draco had decided that wasn’t important enough to disturb him. He placed the cat back onto the floor, who seemed to be offended that she was so abruptly awoken from her nap, then headed out the door to class.
Frowning, Draco leaned over and opened his curtain to look at him. He was facing away from him, wearing red checked pyjama bottoms. Without a top. Draco swallowed as Potter stretched for a moment before bending down to retrieve a discarded jumper that was lying on the floor. His muscles shifted under his skin and Draco suddenly very aware that he had never seen Potter shirtless before. What a pity. He had been missing out. He then turned around with his arms half in the sleeves of his jumper giving Draco a fantastic view of his chest. He was toned but not too much, just the right amount in Draco's opinion. He itched to cross the small space between them and run his hands down his smooth brown skin. Draco's thoughts were interrupted when Potter pulled the hem of his jumper down over his chest. His golden brown skin was now obscured by a big blue H stitched on the front of a scratchy looking jumper that was slightly too big.
She wished the papers would stop writing about him. Luckily Harry refused to read anything but the Quibbler, which Luna gave to him for free. That didn’t stop him from catching glimpses of articles about how he was coping after the war and who he was dating and how he was doing at school. Most of it wasn’t even true. The other week they’d once again decided that she and Harry were secretly in love. Ron had just laughed at that one. She was glad he didn’t take it seriously, his trust meant a lot to her, especially when she knew it didn’t come easily to him.
No matter how much he was enjoying the feeling of Harry’s nose pressing gently into his collarbone and his warm breath fanning across his skin, he didn’t want him waking up and pushing him away. Gently, he put a hand on Harry’s opposite shoulder and shook him, managing to push him away at the same time. Harry frowned, his lips forming a slight pout as he blearily blinked his eyes open. Draco was once again reminded that Harry had the most gorgeous eyes and the sight of them under half close eyelids almost made Draco gasp. He hoped Harry didn’t notice.
The door shut behind Hermione as she walked out of the room. Harry looked back at Draco who was closely examining his own nails. Clearly, he had got bored after finishing his own and decided to start on Harry, without his permission.
“We’re only supposed to have one partner,” he pointed out. “What do we have next? Charms? Did we have homework?” he then added quickly, so she couldn’t interrupt. The best way to distract Hermione was with school work.
He was considering skipping dinner. The quiet of being outside was so much more appealing than the rowdiness of the Great Hall when it was full of students. Draco remembered telling Harry the night before that he hated eating in the great hall and Harry had said he did too. Draco had just frowned at him. He found it hard to believe. Draco hated it because being around so many people made him feel more alone than when he actually was on his own. He felt bad about being so distant with Pansy and Blaise. They did try to include him but he couldn’t shake the feeling that they were fed up with his moodiness, and that made him feel even worse. Other students wouldn’t even glance in their direction unless it was to glare at them. And when he’d look over to the Gryffindor table, he would see Harry laughing along to something Weasley or Granger had said. So he didn’t understand how Harry could hate it.
Since his attempts at annoying Malfoy until he talked to him were not working out how he had planned- and he honestly didn’t feel like it anymore- he decided to rethink. It wasn’t fun fighting with Malfoy now that he didn’t even react. He had thought about it while staring up at the canopy of his bed and had decided the only option he had left was to just be nice to him. At least that way he would have the satisfaction of confusing the hell out of him.
"What?" Harry said defensively, inexplicably confused at Draco's reaction. His hands had stopped playing with the grass and were now resting on his sides, arms wrapped folded over his stomach. Draco wondered if he was cold. He had put his Slytherin jumper back on over his quidditch robes but Harry had refused to put his own on, claiming he didn't feel the cold.
He looked up at Draco with wide hopeful eyes and Draco was forced to reconsider the answer he was about to give.
This is my first attempt at writing a Drarry fic so please let me know what you think! I have already written most of this story already and I just need to edit everything so I will hopefully be updating every week.
“No. Sod off I’ll start again,” he pushed Malfoy’s hands away before he could get hold of the knife and put more fluxweed onto the chopping board. Surprisingly, Malfoy gave in straight away, going back to stirring the cauldron.
“Do you think Harry’s been acting strange lately?” Ron asked, breaking the silence that had settled between him and Hermione for the last half hour. They were lying on one of the longer sofas in the common room, Hermione sitting between Ron outstretched legs. She was reading an old book from the library about Magical law and Ron’s arms were wrapped about her waist and his chin rested on her shoulder.
He also wanted to argue, but he didn't think he had any right to make Harry talk about anything he was uncomfortable with. He opened his mouth, about to change the subject but all he would think about was little Harry, being forced to sleep in a cupboard by the people who were supposed to love and protect him, and found he couldn't think of anything to lighten the mood. Harry was the more cheerful one of the two and Draco had next to no experience with comforting people. He felt a little lost.
“It’s none of your business,” he mumbled. Harry might have assumed he was angry at his nosiness but something about the way his eyes sifted away from him told him he was more embarrassed. Actually curious now, Harry subtly craned his neck to read the words at the top of the books pages. It was a muggle book.
Ginny reached out a hand and pried Harry’s free and unfurled his fingers. “Who did those? Because it definitely wasn’t you, they’re too neat,” Ginny said, admiring his fingers.
Draco retracted his hand that had wandered across the bedsheets towards Harry’s in his sleep, just the tip of his little finger touching the soft skin of Harry’s hand.
Harry walked through the doors and to the Gryffindor table while Draco went in the opposite direction to meet his friends at the Slytherin one. Draco tried to keep his attention on them and not the other side of the hall. He really did.
To his surprise, Harry stepped back up to his bed and carefully sat down. He muttered ‘nox’, extinguishing the light from his wand and set it aside. Draco could only make out the outlie of Harry’s body and a few features from the moonlight streaming in through the window. One of them should have closed the curtains before they went to bed but right now Draco couldn’t move. He took a deep breath, still staring up at the canopy blinking just a little too often, his jaw tense. Harry twisted round so he was looking at Draco. “Do you want to talk about it?” he asked quietly as he tried to meet Draco’s shining eyes.
He told himself that he was doing this so he could have a roommate who didn’t hate him and firmly ignored any thoughts that there might be more to it.
But now he had someone to talk to, even if the conversations were very one sided, if you didn’t count the meows he sometimes got in response. She reminded him a lot of Dobby. Maybe it was her eyes or maybe it was the way she had inserted herself into Harry's life without his permission.
"Long story. It doesn't matter." He opened out his palm, allowing the snitch to spread its wings and fly up into the sky.
It wasn't his destination that caught Harry's attention however, but the looks Malfoy was getting from other students. As he walked past, people would glare and mutter comments to their friends. Sometimes people would purposely bump into him, almost knocking him over. Harry was surprised by their clear dislike for Malfoy. Yes, he had been a Death Eater, but Harry thought it was obvious that he had hated Voldemort just as much as everyone else. The only reason he joined the Death Eaters in the first place was because he was scared, he had been miserable ever since Voldemort had given him the dark mark. Malfoy was an asshole sometimes but most of the time it was harmless. But maybe other people didn’t know Malfoy like he did. The thought was strange to Harry, did he really know Malfoy that well? Did Malfoy know him that well?
“Can’t you just do it for me?” Ron suggested, giving her a hopeful look through a gap in his fingers.
Draco had to turn his back to Harry, pretending to unfold his black trousers, to hide the scarlet blush that rose to his cheeks. To his credit, he refrained from choking on his own breath and stuttering out some lame denial, instead scoffing as if that wasn’t exactly what he wanted to do.
Potter, Weasley and Granger pushed open the door at exactly 9 o’clock, the latter clearly frustrated with the other two’s lack of enthusiasm. They went straight to the only remaining table, the one in front of Draco, pulled out their chairs and sat down. He noted that Potter ended up sitting on the end of the table that was meant for two. He would get away with it of course, while Draco would probably lose 10 points for not having a partner.
“Did you finish the book?” He asked as he stretched his arms out to the side, almost hitting Draco in the face.
“Was Malfoy bothering you?” Ron asked, looking ready to go after him and defend his friend. Harry appreciated it but shook his head.
“Fine, if you’re so hell bent on spending time with me…” he said, looking away from Pepper and at the Gryffindor. “But only so Pepper can stay.”
“So Draco,” Pansy said as she sat down next to him at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, he knew from her tone that she knew something and was going to tease him about it. She paused dramatically as she started pilling food onto her plate. “When did you and Potter become the best of friends? Is there something you want to tell us?”
So, to avoid talking to people he waited till the halls weren’t too crowded, put on his invisibility cloak and snuck around till he found a quiet corner to hide in. Thankfully he still had the Marauders Map to help him find any secret passageways where he wouldn’t be disturbed.
He tried to take a step forward but found he couldn’t move his legs. He made a sound of surprise and wobbled forward for a second before regaining his balance, holding his arms out in front of himself. He looked up at Malfoy and found the Slytherin looking at him with an amused glint in his eyes and a small proud smile on his face. Harry felt an inexplicable warmth spread through him at the sight. He couldn’t help but grin back.
A month of this passed by the time Harry finally got Malfoy to speak to him. Though it was, perhaps unsurprisingly, not due to any of Harry’s provoking tactics.
“I just thought you might like to talk about it,” Harry shrugged. This was true, but it was also because Harry felt like he always talked about himself when he was with Malfoy, trying to fill any silences before it got awkward. He didn’t want to be the only one talking. He wanted to know pointless things about Malfoy. “Is it good?”
In the back of his mind Draco knew he’d let this go too far. He couldn’t be friends with Harry. It would only end in him getting his heart broken. Harry didn’t even want people to know they were
"Well, there's plenty of brooms in here and I have a spare set of robes... if you want to use them," he reached into his locker and pulled out a bundle of red and gold and held it out to him. "Or you could play in those fancy pyjamas you're wearing, but they don't look very wind proof."
"Really? Aren't you playing this year?" he asked, confused. Quidditch practice had already started but of course he shouldn't expect Potter to notice if he was attending practices or not. He had started getting up even earlier than Draco to practice with the Gryffindor team, he would come back muddy and smelling of sweat but with a beaming smile on his face. Sometimes he'd tell Draco about the stupid things his teammates had done-usually Ron-which Draco would listen to with a fake bored expression. "Come on, that's funny" Harry had said once, when Draco hadn't laughed at his enthusiastic retelling of how Ron had face-planted while trying to catch a quaffle. "Gryffindor's are all morons" Draco had replied.
“Yes! Anything for Harry Potter, sir!” the elf nodded over enthusiastically, rushing off to get them some plates and telling the other elves to set up a table for them. Harry started to protest, to tell them that they could do it themselves but gave up when he realised he was being ignored.
Then he had started accusing him of things. Saying that it was his fault that his sister had died fighting Voldemort. He didn’t know who his sister was but he definitely knew he hadn’t killed her. He’d never killed anyone.
“Not anymore,” his voice was calm and confident but it felt like a feeble answer, he knew this boy wouldn't care how sorry Malfoy was now. No matter how much he regretted his actions, he still did them. But Harry knew a thing or two about regret and he wasn't going to let him hurt Malfoy. The boy continued to push him against the wall, glaring and almost choking him. Malfoy winced and Harry took another step closer.
Harry gave him a sad smile. He didn’t say anything more and Draco didn’t want him to. To know he wasn’t alone, that he was safe, was enough. Harry made him feel safe.
While he worked, Draco could feel eyes on him but every time he looked up everyone was concentrating on their work. He shrugged it off as paranoia.
Harry just groaned in response, rubbing his eyes with the balls of his hands. “What time is it?” he said in a sleepy voice.
Potter had been consistently bothering him for a few weeks now. Draco was still stubbornly trying to refuse to engage in the conversations but sometimes he couldn't help himself. It was frustrating how persistent he was being. But he couldn't get rid of him. No amount of eye rolling or scowls could get him to leave Draco alone, and he was left with no choice but to accept Potter's weird behaviour. He hadn't yet told him to stop, but that was irrelevant.
Harry pretended to search for something specific, but it wasn’t a book he was looking for. He had almost given up, thinking Malfoy had slipped out again without him noticing, when he reached the very last aisle, one people rarely went down and spotted a slender figure in Slytherin green robes. He was facing away from Harry, sitting at a desk in a hidden shadowy corner at the other end of the row of shelves, lit by a single lantern. Harry knew it was Malfoy, no one else had hair that blonde.
“I’ve explained it to you four times now,” Hermione said quietly. Harry thought it seemed more like ten. She was trying to be patient with him but there was underlying frustration in her tone. Their study session had been going fine, Harry had written almost half of his essay when Ron first asked for Hermione’s help. Now, after hearing her repeat the same thing with increasing annoyance, and volume-she had been asked to lower her voice more than once-he had made no progress and was starting to get a headache.
"Fine! But if I get expelled for being out after curfew, I will murder you," he muttered, as he stepped under the cloak and Potter's arm. He pushed his arm away in annoyance, making the other boy snicker. He grabbed the cloak and tugged it further around himself. "I don't know why we're even doing this."
The only reply he received was a meow and the soft pat of a paw. With a resigned groan Harry shifted onto his back and grabbed the ball of fluff that had fallen to the side from his movements. “Remind me why I kept you?” he asked, as he wrapped his arms around his needy cat, hugging her to his chest. Instead of curling up on top of him like she usually would, she wriggled free and meowed loudly at him.
“They will?” Harry hadn’t thought about that. Maybe if he wound him up enough, he could get Malfoy to hex him and he’d have the room to himself.
"A cupboard?" he said with a confused laugh, thinking Harry was making some odd joke. It was a strange thing to say, why would he be living in a cupboard?
“You need to learn to let things go.” “We were stupid teenagers. What if he really does want to be better?”
Harry sputtered for a second, feeling weirdly uncomfortable talking to Ginny about Draco. He still didn’t know where he stood with her. Though their break up had been mutual he worried it was because he was a bad boyfriend. Sometimes he wondered if she held a grudge against him for not being better. She seemed fine, but then Harry had never been very good at reading people.
He gave a clearly confused Ron his broom with a promise to meet him and Hermione in the great hall, then started walking across the grass field to the edge of the forest, hoping Ron wasn’t paying too much attention to the direction he was going.
“I think you’re being a little harsh,” Hermione said, only half believing her own words. She didn’t know why she was defending Malfoy, but if anything became of Harry’s possible feelings, they might be seeing more of him and it would be better if they all got along.
Harry was absently aware that this was becoming a bit of an obsession. Making a mental step by step guide to befriending your once ‘worst enemy’-which, now Harry thought about it, was a strange way for a boy who had enemies such as Voldemort, to refer to someone who tried to knock him off his broom every now and then-wasn’t exactly normal behaviour. But when has Harry’s life ever been normal?
Malfoy was still frowning but he seemed to have decided pretending Harry wasn’t there was the best way to deal with him. Harry searched for something to say, he would get Malfoy to talk to him, whether he liked it or not.
“Well he’s not really got a choice, has he? It’s either that or be miserable for a whole year. Right Harry?” Ron said because he was a good friend and knew when Harry needed saving.
“Stop complaining and take the bloody food,” Harry said with exasperation. “You’d be eating it upstairs anyway.”
"Not like... a kitchen cupboard, it was a cupboard under the stairs," Harry clarified, as if Draco would now understand and not be completely disgusted.
He wondered if maybe Malfoy had said something to cause this reaction. But he had been keeping to himself since the start of term, why would he start causing trouble now? Besides, Harry had seen the way the other students treated him, and that was with other people around. He wouldn’t be surprised if this boy had followed Malfoy until he was alone.
"Yes Potter, that is how you play quidditch," he deadpanned. Before Potter could reply, he climbed onto his broom and took off after the snitch.
Draco had heard him get up the night before and leave their room. He wondered where he was going. It was oddly nice to know he wasn’t the only one who couldn’t sleep, which he knew was a selfish way to think. Despite him having less nightmares now he was back at Hogwarts, he still had them occasionally. He had woken up shouting out and clutching his pillow in such a tight fist he was worried he had torn the material. Luckily he knew he was prone to waking up like this and would routinely cast silencing charms around his bed every night. He had started doing it when, while still at the manor, he had woken his mother and frightened her half to death with his screams.
“Merlin, you stink,” Malfoy said, drawing Harry’s attention back to him. Harry glanced down at himself. He was still in his quidditch robes. The material around his knees and elbows were entirely brown where he’d been knocked off his broom by a bludger and landed on the muddy ground. He couldn’t see his reflection but he knew his cheeks were probably flushed and his hair a mess. He saw movement out the corner of his eye and looked back up at Malfoy. He was putting his wand away. Harry felt a shiver run down his body.
"You'll see," he said evasively. It was almost as if he knew Draco was curious where he went on his midnight walks and was using it against him.
“Harry!” a familiar voice shouted. His eyes searched up and down the train until they found Hermione leaning out of one of the doorways half way down the train, waving him over. “Why are you so late?” She looked somewhere between annoyed and worried as he reached her.
The rest of the lesson went by uneventfully and soon enough they had a vial full of glittery dark purple liquid. Harry was proud of how perfect it was. Except with the help of Snape’s potions book, he had never been able to complete a potion as accurately as this one. Perhaps being Malfoy’s partner had more benefits that he initially thought. They made a good team. When Slughorn reached their table, last since it was the furthest from his desk, he praised the potion and exclaimed that it was the best one he had seen so far. Harry grinned at Malfoy and received a scowl in response.
Standing in the middle of the new 8th year common room, Harry gaped up at Professor McGonagall. “You have to be joking.”
"It is," Harry said, still lost in his thoughts, Draco didn't think he meant to continue speaking when he mumbled, "but it's better than a cupboard."
Harry knew he shouldn’t feel bad for him but he couldn’t help it. The way he kept his head down and his shoulders hunched was so un-Malfoy like that Harry hardly recognised him. The Malfoy he knew was so confident that no one dared make fun of him. The boy standing in front of him then was defeated and looked like he wanted nothing more than to disappear. He was even worse than he had been in 6th year.
“I would have been even later if Pepper hadn’t woken me up,” Harry said as he shoved his trunk under his seat and sat down with a sigh. The train slowly started to move as Harry got settled. “Turns out she’s actually useful for something.”
“Of course. I remember all my house elves.” This was true, out of everyone in his family Draco was the one who treated the elves the best. Though he didn’t see this as an act of kindness but rather the result of disinterest. Having grown up with house elves, he hardly noticed their presents. But unlike his father he had never harmed them and would refuse to punish them when they made a mistake. He had never enjoyed violence.
“I don’t know. They’re always laughing together in potions,” she said, deciding Ron at least needed to get used to the idea of Harry and Malfoy being friends.
“Let me guess, you think he’s ‘up to something again’” Ron said in a poor imitation of Harry’s voice. “You’re not going to start following him everywhere again are you?”
Harry had noticed that Malfoy was a bit of a clean freak, if the orderly way he had arranged his things was anything to go by. So he started leaving his side of the room messy and ‘accidentally’ crossing the line onto Malfoy’s side. He was sure this would at least get him a sneer but disappointingly for Harry, Malfoy would just give the mess a disapproving look and then tidy it away when he wasn’t there. He tired being a distracting as possible, tapping his fingers on a table or humming along to whatever song came into his head whenever Malfoy opened a book to study. This received no reaction at all besides a clenched jaw, which he could have imagined altogether. He even started letting Pepper climb onto his bed and curl up on top of the sheets, no doubt leaving black and white fur behind. But Malfoy didn’t seem to mind. In fact, he seemed almost fond of the cat, stroking her head before gently shooing her off his bed.
Draco woke up the next morning to the sound of birds chirping and for a few blissful seconds his mind was completely blank but for the feeling of the soft covers surrounding his body and the warmth of sunlight on his face. He squinted against the bright light and blinked his eyes open. He knew he should have shut that curtain. It would have saved him the torture of seeing Harry’s adorable bedhead and Pepper sprawled out next to his chest, hidden under his arm. Draco almost jumped at the sight of another person in his bed but relaxed when the memories of the night before came flooding back. A blush had darkened his cheeks before he could stop it. This was why he put up silencing charms around his bed every night. To stop this exact thing from happening. He must have forgotten to cast them, been too distracted. He and Harry had been talking. He didn’t even remember going to sleep.
Harry’s attention was pulled from Draco’s arms to his face as he tilted it to see better. He had never really looked at Draco properly before. He was actually quite attractive, Harry thought. Pretty even. It felt somehow fitting that Draco had perfect bone structure, everything about him had an air of superiority. His cheekbones and jaw line were sharp enough to cut and his hair, even now when free of jell, was that kind of effortlessly neat that Harry could never hope to achieve.  His nose was perfectly upturned, in contrast to Harry’s broken one (courtesy of Draco himself), making his features look delicate. And of course, his lips were a lovely shade of pink, plump and curved into a permanent frown, the only contradiction to his air of elegance.
He’d sat out in this spot a few times and found that no one liked to get close to the forest. Everyone else would sit scattered around the grass field in groups, as if they were afraid of what might be in the forest. Draco had been in there enough times to no longer be afraid.
Draco’s feelings towards Potter were never that straightforward. Back in their first year, he had been so excited to meet him, this powerful wizard who had defeated the Dark Lord as a baby. Draco had thought he was amazing. He sometimes thought back to when he first met Potter in Madam Malkin's, when neither of them had known who the other was. They had been friendly. It was probably the only conversation they’d had where they hadn’t insulted each other. He sometimes wondered if Potter remembered too.
Harry was about to follow him when he saw Hermione and Ron at the top of the stairs. They passed Malfoy on their way down and eyed him suspiciously as they passed, probably noticing how upset he was.
It was weird how easily they could talk to each other and Draco was struck by just how much they had in common. He had shown Harry the Draco constellation, pointing out each star and telling him their names. Harry had listened intently and told him that despite their many astronomy lessons, the only constellation he could remember was the Big Dipper. Draco then listened as he explained how he would look for the Dipper at night when he looked out his window of his aunt and uncle's house, wishing he was back at Hogwarts. When he had asked why he wouldn't want to be with his aunt and uncle, Harry had seemed uncomfortable, so he dropped the subject.
He pulled out the stall next to Malfoy and sat down. He could feel Malfoy’s eyes on him as he took out his books and placed them on the desk. As he expected, when he looked up, Malfoy was staring at him as if he had gone mad.
Talking about it meant thinking about it and he planned to never do that again. It had worked to a point so far, why should he put himself through that just because Harry asked him to? He didn’t want to hear about Draco’s problems. He’d been through far worse. He’d probably think Draco was weak, and he wouldn’t disagree. He didn’t want Harry to know he was weak.
Even if for a few moments it had felt like they were almost friends, even if Draco still didn’t believe Potter was being genuine in his advances of friendship.
He came to a stop a few feet away from Malfoy, who must have noticed him approach but didn’t look up.
Draco’s eyes quickly darted back up before Harry could realise he had been watching him. Oblivious, Harry slid back on his arm and lifted his legs onto the bed, until he was settled on his side on top of the covers, facing Draco. He put an arm under his head, the other resting on the sheets between them. Draco could feel his gaze on the side of his face but refused to look. Of all the times he’d imagined Harry in his bed, never had be pictured himself unable to look at the other boy. In fact, it was usually quite the opposite.
“Wait,” Draco said, finally catching his breath enough to speak, his mouth moving before he could think better of it. “Don’t go...”
Before he could spiral into a haze of depressive thoughts and do something stupid, like start crying, he got up. The curtains around Potter’s bed were open but he was still curled up under the covers, his cat sleeping on his pillow next to his head, both were snoring softly. Draco scowled at them.
“It’s not actually.” At least Draco didn't find it awkward, he couldn't speak for Potter. But when he wasn’t trying to irritate him, Draco actually enjoyed having Potter hanging around.
“There’s nowhere else to sit...” It was probably true. Draco chose to sit on his own to get away from everyone else, but today he didn’t have a choice anyway, there were very few places to sit in the library and every one of them was currently occupied. But that was just a convenience.
Satisfied with their portions, they sat at the table that had been set out for them as the elves ran around cleaning up. The food had vanished from the tables, transported up into the Great Hall above them.
There are some things in the previous chapters that I really want to change but I’m going to wait till the end then edit the whole thing
Draco would have tried harder to refuse, but the problem was, he kind of wanted to go for a walk. He didn't want to spend another minuet in this stuffy room, staring into darkness, unable to get the images of his nightmare out of his head.
“Yeah, no shit.” Draco said. He automatically slapped Harry’s grabbing hands away but obligingly took them off, turned them around and placed them onto his face.
Potter scoffed but Draco sensed amusement hidden underneath and couldn't help the small smile that made its way onto his face. It's not like Potter could see him anyway.
"Harry..." he said softly, unaware that he had used his first name. "Please tell me you know that's not normal."
He couldn’t seem to rid his dreams of the image of Voldemort torturing people or of him torturing Draco. Those were the worst dreams. He would wake up covered in sweat and shaking, unable to get back to sleep. It was while he laid awake after these nightmares that he would listen for the sound of Potter’s rhythmic breathing, he found it comforting. At least, he did when Potter wasn’t tossing and turning all night, panting and mumbling incoherently. Draco wasn’t surprised he also had nightmares. But he hated the listening to it, unable to do anything to help. What was he supposed to do? Wake him up? Potter would probably punch him as soon as he opened his eyes and saw Draco standing over him.
Ron turned to look at her properly. Seeming to realise she was being serious, he frowned. “Do you believe that?”
“I didn’t know wizards read muggle books,” he said offhandedly. He thought this was an acceptable way to start a conversation with Malfoy. He was always reading, Harry thought maybe he’d appreciate being asked about his books. Apparently not.
“I don’t think so,” he said, appreciating the slight change in subject. “We don’t talk much. Or at all really.”
“Ok…” he said anyway as they moved to stand across from each other. He did the same, standing a few feet in front of Malfoy, facing him. “You try first.”
“What do you want?” Draco interrupted, slightly annoyed at the other boy’s inability to take a hint.
Harry didn’t give up easily, and he didn’t think the lesson had gone that badly. Him and Malfoy hadn’t even really argued, like he had expected, and even when they had it was almost pleasant compared to their usual interactions. So, rather than being put off by Malfoy’s unwillingness to be friendly, he decided to persist.
“What? What’s the matter?” Harry asked her, even though he knew he wouldn’t get a reply. Pepper jumped off the bed and ran across the room until she was standing beside Harry’s trunk. The trunk that he had spent the past week packing full of everything he’d need for his eighth year at Hogwarts.
It was 1 am and Draco was, in fact, awake. But still, he paused. The sound of Potter's voice, breaking the deathly silence of their room, had startled him. He had heard him shuffling around but Potter was always fidgeting and Draco had thought he was alone in his inability to asleep. He should ignore him. Pretend to be sleeping and not to have heard him speak.
I hope you guys like this chapter! The next ones will be more eventful I promise, these first two are just an introduction
Once he was close enough, he peered around the corner and into the dimly lit hall to see two figures. One was pressing the other against the wall, an arm against his throat and another pointing a wand under his chin. Harry recognised the second figure straight away, his blond hair giving him away. He wasn’t sure who the other boy was, but he was wearing Hufflepuff robes and he looked no more than two years younger than Harry.
He missed having a girlfriend. Missed having someone to hold and kiss and talk to. He had liked being with Ginny. But it turned out he hadn’t really love Ginny like he thought he had. Their break up was mutual, both agreed it wasn’t really working out. But he still missed the closeness of being in a relationship. He loved his friends but sometimes their love for each other just made him feel sorry for himself. He wanted someone to play with his hair, to hold his hand and kiss him softly.
Harry started leading them back towards the doors but before they could reach them, an owl suddenly flew out from the big fireplace taking up half of one wall, a letter clutch in its beak. Draco automatically held out his elbow for the owl to land and took the offered letter. The owl belonged to his family so it wasn’t a surprise when he turned it over and saw the curling letters of his mother’s hand writing.
They were lying side by side in the middle of the quidditch pitch, looking up at the stars. Harry had won two of their three games, which Draco had said was purely because he had a better broom. Harry had told him he was a sore loser. Both games had taken longer than the first and by the time they had finished it was almost 3 am. Somehow, Draco had ended up lying down on his back next to Harry and talking about nothing and anything. They were both probably over sharing and would regret it later, but Draco couldn't bring himself to care.
“You were having a nightmare... I- you were talking in your sleep,” Harry said. He looked as panicked as Draco felt, like he was expecting Draco to start shouting at him any second and wasn’t really sure what to do about it. When Draco said nothing and continued to maintain his glare, though his heart wasn’t in it, Harry averted his eyes and awkwardly pointed his thumb over his shoulder and said, “Um… I’ll just...”
Harry and Draco’s late night quidditch games had become a regular thing, and after not sleeping all night, Harry had formed a habit of sleeping during the day. Usually coming to find wherever Draco was sitting quietly reading and falling asleep next to him. Draco didn’t seem to mind. Which was why today, before he was rudely awoken by Hermione, he had left his friends in the common room and come to find Draco in their room. He did not however, come for a manicure.
Malfoy’s reaction to what he’d told him about his childhood surprised him. Hermione and Ron had had similar reactions but he didn’t expect Malfoy to care. He almost thought he’d make fun of him for it. But, as Harry had to keep reminding himself, Malfoy was trying to be better.
Hermione narrowed her eyes but recognised the subtle dismissal and turned to leave. “Ok,” she nodded, hesitated by the door, then finally closed it behind her.
“I don’t know Hermione, is Malfoy capable of being anything but terrible?” Ron asked sceptically. Harry thought that was a little harsh. “He didn’t seem to care before.”
Despite her suspicions of Malfoy, she was glad Harry now had someone else to talk to. It was obvious Harry felt awkward around her and Ron sometimes, like he was intruding on their relationship. It wasn’t true, obviously. They always had time for Harry. But if it made him feel better to give them space, she’d rather he wasn’t alone.
The lesson started and Slughorn explained what potion they would be learning. Harry flicked through his potions book to find the instructions and read through, it sounded simple enough. Silently, he got up to get the ingredients while Malfoy set up the cauldron. He returned with his arms full of jars and struggled to put them down without dropping them. Malfoy tried to ignore him until Harry almost dropped one on the floor and then he begrudgingly helped him place them on their desk.
He turned to see Malfoy clench his jaw, clearly offended. Once again rolling his eyes, Malfoy picked up his trunk and started up the stairs that lead to their new room. Harry was expecting a snide comment but Malfoy remained silent.
Draco spent the rest of the lesson discreetly watching the trio of friends bickering over how best to make the potion, while pretending to be finishing up with his own. Slughorn had ignored his raised hand for about five minutes and in the end, Draco gave up trying to get his attention.
“Where are my glasses?” Harry said, clearly unaware of Draco’s internal crisis, whether because he couldn’t see the expression on his face or because he was just that oblivious.
“Then why do you keep bothering me?” There was an underlying tone of desperation to his voice that Draco tried to cover up with another glare. Still, Harry paused, looking slightly guilty. If he was going to force his presents on Draco, he would at least get an explanation on his strange behaviour.
Sorry I haven't posted in so long but I've been really busy. I finally got all my assignments done so now I have time to write again!
“That can’t be right,” Ron joked. “I doubt Malfoy’s sense of humour extends past laughing at other people’s misfortune.”
Hermione shot him a guilty look and apologised while Ron just grumbled into his hands. She rolled her eyes at him but gave in and pushed her own answers towards him. “Only to help you, don’t you dare copy.”
“Why not?” She sounded disappointed and Draco felt slightly guilty. He didn’t mean to push his friends away but he felt so disconnected from them. He enjoyed their company but he preferred being alone. When he was with them, he would feel fine and then suddenly he would want nothing more than to be alone. But the most frustrating thing was that once he was alone he couldn’t help but feel lonely. It made no sense and it made him angry with himself.
“Please just let me switch with literally anyone else,” Harry lowered his voice, all too aware of Malfoy’s presence behind him. Still, he heard Malfoy scoff and could practically feel him roll his eyes. Harry wasn't sure why he was offended, he knew Malfoy didn't want to share a room with him just as much as Harry didn't want to.
“Well yeah, because he doesn’t want to get expelled. That doesn’t mean he isn’t still a prick on the inside.”
He had noticed that Draco never ate breakfast and assumed it was because he didn’t like being in the Great Hall. He had also noticed that Draco was very skinny. His wrists were bony where they stuck out from his sleeves and his cheekbones were even more prominent than usual. He wondered if it was a conscious choice to eat less or a result of feeling uncomfortable around the other students. Either way, Harry was determined to get the him to eat more.
He had been subtly looking over at him while also pretending to be invested in Pansy’s story but apparently, she had noticed.
He honestly wouldn’t want to share a room with anyone else. Maybe not even Ron. With Draco, there were no expectations. He didn’t have to be ‘the boy who lived’, some hero he didn’t feel like he was, because Draco didn’t treat him that way. He treated him the way he always had, albeit a little nicer, and Harry appreciated that. He needed people who didn’t take his shit and that understood what he’d been through. The expectation and pressure he’d been under from such a young age. There were very few people who understood, but Draco was definitely one of them.
“No one,” Draco scowled, sliding the letter into his pocket, promising himself he would write an extra long reply as soon as classes were over. Harry scoffed but didn’t push him to answer and, even if Draco would have told him if he had, he appreciated it.
“Waiting.” Harry rubbed at his eyes sleepily. His lack of sleep and two hours of exercise were catching up to him. He closed his eyes for a second. Just to rest them.
. “7:45 am,” he said, turning back to Harry. He was looking up at him through sleepy half lidded eyes and Draco suddenly found the wall extremely interesting.
He had completely forgotten. He hadn’t replied to the last letter his mother had sent him, though he had fully intended to. It must have slipped his mind.
“I get nightmares too,” Harry mumbled after a while. Draco’s heart clenched inexplicably. It was nothing he didn’t already know, but something about how small Harry sounded made him want to close the distance between them and wrap his arms around him, whether to comfort Harry or himself he wasn’t sure. Perhaps it was both.
Potter was once again, inexplicably, talking to him willingly. He had been doing this all week. Every potions lesson he would come and sit in the seat besides Draco as if it were the most normal thing in the world, which it was anything but. He may have believed Potter’s flimsy excuse of needing a partner, after all it did make sense for him to sit next to Draco rather than on the end of Granger and Weasley’s desk, had he not then done the same thing the next day in defence against the dark arts.
“Fine!” Harry flung the hand that wasn’t holding Pepper into the air in defeat and picked up his own trunk.
Blocking out the wave of inappropriate thoughts that filled Draco’s mind, he averted his eyes and walked over to help Harry look for his glasses. Harry took a step aside, not putting nearly enough space between them. Draco scoffed as he leaned over and plucked Harry’s glasses up from where they sat on top of his book. “Merlin, how blind
Plus, he would finally let himself admit it, he knew, for some reason, Harry enjoyed his company. Even if it was just to get away from his friends and their dopey eyes. He didn’t want to cause Harry any more pain. He’d let his heart be broken into a million pieces if it meant Harry never felt anything like that again. He’d been hurt too many times already in his life. Which didn’t make sense. He didn’t put other people before himself, besides maybe his mother. He had always been selfish.
She turned to look at him, her perfectly shaped eyebrows raised and a knowing smirk on her face. Pansy lived to tease Draco. She hadn’t had the chance to these last few months, both out of pity and lack of things to tease him about.
He wasn’t wearing his glasses. He looked different without them. Draco wasn’t sure if he liked it. Those hideous things somehow suited him.
So yes, she’d noticed that Harry was acting strange. She hadn’t mention it because she was almost sure she knew what was going on and she wished Harry would just talk to her about it because she was just as sure he didn’t. She was worried Harry was too scared to talk about it. She didn’t think she’d ever done anything to make him think that she’d judge him. She hoped she hadn’t.
"Yeah." He smiled fondly at the memory. But then he seemed to deflate and his smile slowly slid away. "I wasn't exactly popular as a kid."
He leaned his head against the raindrop spattered window, eyes still heavy from his nap. He sighed softly as he watched Draco dip the brush and gently grab his hand again. It was silent but for the heavy raindrops hitting the window pane and Harry’s eyes travelled from Draco’s long fingers up his arm to where he knew the dark mark was hidden beneath his sleeve. He could almost see the outline of it beneath his thin, white shirt. He was always wearing long sleeves. In fact, Harry couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen him wear anything but his plain white dress shirt since 6th year. He wasn’t surprised, people reacted badly enough to Draco without him displaying a reminder of his mistakes on his arm.
He set his trunk down against the end of his bed before flopping down on the mattress. Instead of the usual Gryffindor red sheets, the ones on the bed were plain black. Pepper climbed up beside him, watching expectantly, Harry scratched her ear and she purred quietly.
“Ok, how about I chop everything up and you put them in and stir?” He could tell that Malfoy wanted to argue for the sake of it.
He looked over at Harry for the hundredth time, giving up on the paragraph he had attempted to reread just as many times. The beams of orange sunlight that shone through the leaves of the tree they sat under made Harry’s skin look almost golden. He was reminded of an article he’d read in the Prophet, they had called Potter their ‘Golden Boy’. He’d scoffed at it at the time, but now he could only think that it was fitting. Even his Gryffindor tie had stripes of gold. He shone so bright Draco forced himself to look away.
Harry hummed around a mouth full of food in acknowledgement. He dropped the subject and they ate in a comfortable silence for a while. Draco was enjoying being able to eat without feeling like people were glaring at him. He could get used to this. He wished they could do this every day but he knew Harry would rather be with Hermione and Ron, there was really no point in suggesting it.
“What about all the other years? Was that just for fun?” Ron was joking but Harry felt like he was accusing him of something.
I don't usually ask for comments but feedback would be appreciated because I'm not sure about this chapter. Anyway I hope you liked this, it was meant to be a fun filler chapter where Draco paints Harry's nails while he's sleeping but it turned into Hermione's thoughts on Harry's crush on Draco.
“Yeah, long ways not horizontally,” he said it like Harry was an idiot for not knowing. He looked down at the chopping board. Now he thought about it, it did make more sense to do it Malfoy’s way. He suddenly knew how Hermione had felt in 6th year when he had smugly corrected her. Malfoy had been watching him as he frowned down at the desk before he frustratedly tried to take the knife from Harry’s hand. “Just let me do it.”
Professor Slughorn started the lesson and told everyone what potion they would be making. The potion was meant to be made in pairs but he didn’t ask Potter to move, unsurprisingly. Draco was still sitting alone but Slughorn hadn’t even looked at him once, so he got on with collecting the ingredients and brewing the potion on his own.
Harry started to panic, he’d never been very good with emotions. He considered letting Malfoy to get over it on his own, that was clearly what he wanted. But Harry couldn’t help but think of how lonely he must be at the moment. The few friends that he had never seemed to spend any time with him. Not many Slytherins had come back for eighth year, most of them too cowardly to be back at Hogwarts. Maybe Malfoy wasn’t as much of a coward as Harry thought.
Draco continued getting changed and heard Harry getting up behind him, doing the same. He had just finished tying his tie when he heard Harry rummaging around and muttering to himself in frustration. He turned around and immediately regretted it when he saw Harry half dressed, bent over his bedside table. For about the hundredth time in the last 24 hours, Draco felt heat rise to his cheeks as he watched Harry’s shoulder blades shift under his skin.
He was distracted from his thoughts when he heard voices from behind him. Turning his head in the direction of the noise, he found himself facing the hallway that lead to the library. He strained to hear what they were saying but the voices were hushed, probably not wanting to be overheard.
"Of course I know it isn't. It's just not that big of a deal." He looked as if he'd rather be talking about anything else and Draco wondered if he had ever told anyone this before. Surely he had told his friends? They seemed like the kind of friends that told each other everything.
He was starting to get frustrated with Malfoy’s seemingly unbothered attitude. There had to be something that would break the easy-going facade that he had decided to maintain.
He told himself he would avoid talking to Potter as much as possible. That way, nothing he said could be taken the wrong way and get him thrown out. Potter tended to provoke a reaction out of him even when he wasn’t trying to.
“I do not have a crush on him.” He felt childish saying it, Pansy had a way of backing him into a corner and forcing him to tell her the truth. He knew he couldn’t convince them but he could try. He gestured to Potter, “I mean look at him, he’s so… fucking annoying.” It was the best he could come up with. He was ashamed of his lack of creative insult but his heart wasn’t in it. And Potter was annoying anyway. He was the bane of Draco’s existence, with his stupid concerned looks and pretty eyes. Fuck him.
His long blond eyelashes obscured clear grey eyes that changed colour in different lighting. Eyes that met Harry’s as Draco glanced up for a second then did a double take, looking startled. “What? Have I got something on my face?” He reached up to touch his cheek, forgetting about the brush he was still holding and smearing a line of green onto the bridge of his nose.
Harry reflexively retracted his hands from where they were resting besides his plate and closed them into fists to hide his nails. “Huh?”
"Merlin, do you really not know your way around the castle by now? It's a wonder how you have lived this long." Potter glared at him as he got up from the bed and plucked the parchment from his hands, examining it with amusement. "You do realise this is blank?"
For once Draco was being honest, he really didn’t want any company. He may secretly- or not so secretly if Pansy had anything to say about it- enjoy Potter’s company but he needed to write his essay. And Potter had a habit of fiddling with the first thing he could get his hands on. Besides, Draco was still suspicious of Potter’s intentions and he wasn’t interested in playing any games.
The two boys looked at each other, neither wanting to be the first to move and both wondering exactly what Draco had meant by ‘don’t go’. Draco knew what he wanted it to mean. But the thought of actually asking made his stomach churn even more than it already was. Draco looked away and settled back under his covers, leaving a space next to him. He crossing his arms over his chest in a subconscious gesture of vulnerability, as if that might him stop him from falling apart. He knew Harry wouldn’t take the hint but despite himself, he hoped he might anyway.
“Can you two please shut up,” Harry snapped. He loved his friends. And he was happy that they loved each other, but he couldn’t stand it when they argued. It wasn’t that they didn’t get on. They were still sickeningly in love and spent most of their time blushing and flirting with each other, but the rest of the time they were bickering over something pointless. They also had a tendency to forget he was there, especially when they were wrapped up in each other. When they were arguing, they would forget his presence to a point until one of them demand he side with them. It was maddening.
Before he could worry too much about Harry noticing, another weight joined them on the bed and Draco felt four paws on his chest as Pepper climbed over him into the space between him and Harry. He exhaled sharply in an almost laugh, not quite relaxed enough to smile. Pepper looked at him like she knew exactly what he was thinking and pointedly positioned herself between the two on the mattress, creating a kind of barrier. Feeling oddly comforted by this, Draco chanced a look at Harry and found him looking back with blatant, unconcealed concern written on his face. His eyes were roaming Draco’s face, searching for any sign of lingering distress. Giving in, Draco took a deep breath and shifted onto his side so he was facing Harry properly.
It gave up waiting eventually and Draco thought the thing would finally leave him alone until it jumped up onto his lap, knocking his book out of his hands and onto the floor. He sighed in exasperation, trust Potter to have a cat that was just as irritating as him. He picked the book up again, glaring at the cat. It meowed defiantly and nuzzled its head into Draco’s palm. It was quite cute. And he had always liked cats. They were independent and only affectionate when they wanted to be, which was something Draco could relate to. So instead of shoving Potter’s cat back onto the floor, he let it curl up on his lap, patted its head with one hand and continued reading with the other.
He had almost decided to ignore the them when the voices started to turn more aggressive followed by a thumping sound. He pushed away from the wall and made his way over to the hallway, careful to be quiet so he wouldn’t be noticed.
"What if we get caught?" he asked as he slipped his shoes on. He knew that if he was with Potter he would probably get away with it, but he didn't want to risk it. No doubt Potter was allowed to break curfew whenever he wanted, being the saviour of the wizarding world and all, but Draco was still being watched for bad behaviour.
Oh shit. He threw his covers aside, getting out of the bed so fast, stars appeared around his vision. “What time is it?” He grabbed his glasses from his bedside table and shoved them on so he could see the clock on his wall. 10:04 am. The train would be leaving at 11 and he still had to finish packing.
Even just now, Harry had been sitting with them until he suddenly got up and said he was going to get something from his room, where she knew Malfoy had been all day, only to not return for an hour.
Harry wanted to tell Ron to lower his voice since Malfoy might overhear them and that would be embarrassing but then he remembered that he’d never actually seen Malfoy spending time in the common room. Had he always been this much of a recluse?
The night before was different. As he had laid in bed, trying to escape the images his mind had conjured up, he wondered if maybe Malfoy was awake too. He never heard a sound from the other side of their room but that didn’t mean his roommate was asleep. Malfoy had seen just as many terrible things as him, it wouldn’t be a surprise if he also suffered from insomnia.
After a moment he gave in, making sure to grumble and sigh just the right amount so Potter knew just how much he didn't want to be spending time with him. Potter just grinned. He unhooked his Slytherin jumper from his wardrobe-he took pride in his appearance, unlike Potter who walked around unashamedly in permanently wrinkled clothes-and pulled it on over his silk pyjamas. There was no point in getting dressed, there wouldn't be anyone walking around at this hour.
She smirked, his lack of comeback meaning she had won. Her eyes flicked from him to across the hall to the Gryffindor table. “He’s looking over here.”
Harry, having been disturbed by the sound of the door opening, shifted and slowly blinked his eyes open. He looked over at Malfoy and then at his hand.
Him and Malfoy had come to a silent agreement in the few weeks that they had been back at Hogwarts, that Malfoy would stay in their room and Harry would go elsewhere until curfew at 10pm. Ron and Hermione were getting on well with their roommates. Hermione was sharing a room with Hannah Abbot and Ron with Terry Boot. They had both been in Dumbledore’s Army so they were kind of friends already. Harry was jealous. He wanted a roommate he could talk to. Malfoy still hadn’t said a word to him, which Harry found infuriating. He’d rather get a rude response than nothing at all. He’d ask him simple questions like ‘Have you seen my charm’s textbook?’ and all he’d get in response was a shrug or a gesture towards the book where it would be hidden under a pile of clothes. He was certain this was Malfoy’s way of pissing him off without getting himself in trouble. He couldn’t exactly complain to McGonagall about how Malfoy wasn’t insulting him enough.
“Because she likes me better,” he said smugly. As if to agree, Pepper started purring. Draco almost laughed when he looked up at Potter’s face, he looked betrayed.
I feel like I sometimes waffle on and nothing actually happens? I hope you guys don’t think that but I promise stuff will actually happen in this fic
Then again, she should have a bit more faith in Harry. If he thought Malfoy was trustworthy, then so should she. Maybe Harry knew exactly what he was doing and she was worried for no reason. Maybe she had misjudged the whole situation and they really were just friends. It was none of her business anyway.
No. This was marginally better. At least he wasn’t willingly part of a cult lead by a sadistic maniac anymore.
“Great! I could lend you my Gryffindor jumper and you can cheer me on.” Harry teased as he casually slung an arm around Draco's shoulder, something he had formed a habit of doing in the past few weeks. It never lasted long, the angle was too awkward since Harry was a few inches shorter than him, but he always enjoyed the brief feeling nonetheless.
It was Hogsmeade weekend and he had decided to start heading down to the entrance hall so he could meet Ron and Hermione and start walking into Hogsmeade. He assumed Malfoy had already left as he didn’t seen him when he woke up, early as always. He reached the bottom of the stairs before his friends so he lent against a wall while he waited. Excited voices echoed through the entrance hall as students rushed past him and through the doors to escape from the castle they had been stuck in for the last month. He understood their excitement, being in the castle for too long could be maddening sometimes. The hall started to clear and Harry wondered absently why Hermione and Ron were taking so long and rested his head back against the stone wall.
Harry didn’t want to admit it but he was kind of missing the old Malfoy. And that’s why, after almost two weeks of silence from the Slytherin, Harry found himself looking for ways to provoke him. He discarded their previous arrangement and started sitting up in their dorm most evenings. He almost expected Malfoy to get up and leave as soon as he realised he was staying. Instead he just eyed him suspiciously for a moment, then continued to ignore him.
Potter ignored him, pointing his wand at the parchment and muttered something Draco couldn't hear. Coppery ink spread out over the parchment, forming a map of Hogwarts. Draco subconsciously moved forward to get a better look, peering over Potter's shoulder. "It lets you see where everyone in the castle is. See, there's us."
“Harry have you painted your nails?” a voice said to his right when he finally sat down at the Gryffindor table for lunch. He turned to see a head of long ginger hair and Ginny smiling at him. Across the table, opposite Ginny, sat Luna. The two girls had been spending a lot of time together since the start of the year, enough that no one questioned why Luna wasn’t sitting at the Ravenclaw table. They had been lucky enough to be put in a room together and were now inseparable.
By now, he had come to expect Potter’s presents in potions and had long since grown used to the sound of his breathing in the bed next to his. But he did not expect him to follow him to the one place he got to be alone. He was both annoyed at the intrusion and pleased that Potter would bother coming to find him. He fought the feeling down and plastered his usual frown on his face.
As soon as Malfoy disappeared up the stairs Harry turned back to McGonagall. She was looking at him with a challenging look, as if daring him to keep arguing with her.
Now, Harry knew him well enough to know something was bothering him. As soon as Hermione had come in, he’d tensed up and drew back into himself. It was almost as if he was embarrassed. Harry hoped Draco wasn’t embarrassed to be his friend.
Harry had fallen asleep. This wouldn’t have been an issue if he didn’t look so goddamn beautiful in the orange light of the setting sun. Draco tried to concentrate on his reading. But all he could think about was the point where this shoulder met Harry’s and the way he had casually sat so close to him as if it were the most normal thing in the world.
The peaceful quiet of the morning was a startling contrast to the tension of night before. Never had he woken up the morning after a nightmare and not felt like complete shit. This was the complete opposite; he could sit right here in this moment forever.
“Why? He’s a death eater!” He could tell the boy was unsure, especially once he realised who he was talking to. Still, he didn’t move away. Malfoy was looking at him with a mixture of shock, confusion and annoyance. It was the most emotion he’d show lately and Harry felt weirdly triumphant at having caused it.
“I wasn’t planning on it... Pans and Blaise probably won’t,” Draco said. Honestly, he didn’t want to. It would only make him feel left out and he had no one to sit with anyway. But Harry’s hopeful expression fell into disappointment and Draco couldn’t resist his pout if he tried. “But I guess I could go on my own…”
“Is this... something you do a lot? Eating down here?” Draco asked. Harry seemed like he’d been down here before, he even knew some of the elves by name, and Draco was curious why.
He rested his elbows on the desk and fiddled with his quill until the start of class, glancing over at Malfoy a few times only to see that he was again fully focused on his book. As Hermione and Ron walked into the classroom, they gave him matching odd looks when they saw where he was sitting. He shrugged at them innocently and before they could question him Slughorn cleared his throat to get the attention of his students, indicating the start of the lesson. They let it go, taking their seats and facing the front, but he was sure they would be bringing it up later.
She expected to hear muffled voices as she approached the door but she was met with silence even as she knocked lightly before pushing the door open. What she hadn’t expected was to find Harry and Malfoy both sitting on their window seat, facing each other, while Malfoy painted Harry’s nails.
Harry was in the middle of slicing open some fluxweed when Malfoy glanced over at his chopping board. “You’re doing it wrong.”
"That doesn't make it any better," he said, all humour disappearing when he realised Harry was being serious. He had lifted himself onto his elbows and was looking down at Harry sideways now.
Hermione was caught off guard. It felt like something she wasn’t supposed to be seeing. So far Harry hadn’t really been open about his friendship with Malfoy and she felt like she was intruding. She struggled to start a sentence until finally she got out, “Um... Harry, me and Ron were going to head down for lunch. Are you coming?”
He lugged his trunk up the stairs and clumsily opened the door with his foot, apparently making too much noise if Malfoy’s annoyed look was anything to go by. He was standing by a big window, one that had a seat, the setting sun giving him a soft orange glow. He had already chosen the bed on the right and was currently putting his stuff away neatly. The room was a circular shape with a chunk cut out of it like a crescent moon, where the stairs cut into the room. They were in one of the turrets that stuck out from the tower. Two beds were placed on either side of the window, beside each of the beds was a desk and chair. It was nice.
“My mistake,” Harry laughed. They lapsed into a comfortable silence as Harry got dressed and Draco tidied his side of the room, straightening his sheets and folding his pyjamas. Harry had barely pulled his jumper over his head by the time Draco was reaching for the door handle and pulling it open. Harry rushed to follow, straightening his tie with one hand and tucking in his shirt with the other.
"Maybe they do now," he sounded sceptical. He had started fiddling with a long bit of grass. "My aunt and uncle didn't like me much."
When sitting around became unbearable Harry started to wander around the castle or the grounds and go visit Hagrid. But the problem with that was, the other students wouldn’t leave him alone. Wherever he went people would come up to him and thank him or in some embarrassing cases, asking for an autograph. And if they weren’t coming up to him, they were staring at him, which he wasn’t sure he actually preferred. He just wanted some peace and quiet.
“Well I won’t let you,” Pansy said defiantly. So far they had let him mope around and avoid them but apparently they’d had enough.
“I am not and I don’t want to hear any complaining, Mr Potter,” McGonagall said sternly. “I have made my decision and it is not going to change.”
“Can you even remove this stuff?” He held his hands in front of his face. “Why exactly did you feel the need to paint my nails?”
He hadn’t known at the time that he was jealous. It was only when looking back at his time at Hogwarts, that Draco realised he only resented Potter because he hadn’t wanted to be his friend. He’d never been good at handling not getting what he wanted. He blamed his parents for making him believe he should have whatever he wanted whenever he wanted it. For spoiling him. He blamed them for a lot of things.
Harry may have talked a little more than he had intended. When he suggested the quidditch match, that was all he expected to happen, the talking was just an unexpected bonus. And it was nice. He never would have thought he’d enjoy just talking to Malfoy so much. He feels a little out of his depth if he’s honest. He only wanted to make things less awkward between them, but he seems to have gotten carried away.
in bed together (not that they did much snuggling, unfortunately). He may as well rip his heart out now and be done with it. It’s not that he would have preferred to wake up to Harry gone, that would have left him hurt and worried he’d ruined everything. But this was encouraging the feelings he had worked so hard to stamp down for years.
He reached for the tissue Draco had set aside in case of any mistakes and balled it up in one hand. Draco’s eyes widened slightly and he tensed as Harry leaned forward and reached up to gently hold his face still. His skin was warm and soft beneath Harry’s fingertips and as he accidentally brushed past Draco’s bottom lip, something stirred in the pit of his stomach that he forcibly pushed down. Draco’s unreadable eyes searched his face as he lifted the tissue and pressed it to his nose. Harry felt overly aware of how close they were in a way he hadn’t been before. The paint hadn’t had time to dry so it came away easily and Harry smiled and gave Draco’s cheek a pat, leaning back and averting his eyes a little too fast to be natural. “All gone.”
He clenched his jaw but ignored her question. “Why were you waiting for me?” He was planning on sitting in the common room all day since no one would be around.
“Yes, he does. Thanks Harry, saves one of us from having to put up with him,” she said with a wry smile, giving Malfoy a pat hard on the arm. He gave her a flat look. Harry was confused at the interaction and surprised at how friendly she was being. Though he guessed it was probably more for Malfoy’s benefit than his.
Draco got to the common room at the same time Pansy and Blaise were coming out of it. He rubbed furiously at his eyes, probably making the redness worse. It was bad enough that Potter had seen him so upset, he didn’t want his friends fussing over him.
As always, she was worried about him. Harry was the kind of person to follow his heart without thinking, and right now it seemed to be pointing him towards Malfoy and possibly towards heartbreak. And as much as she thinks he’s changed, she didn’t trust Malfoy not to hurt her best friend. She felt an irrational need to protect him. She knew he could take care of himself, but sometimes he made questionable decisions when left to his own devices. Like giving his heart to someone who, as far as she knew, would likely throw it away without a second glance.
Potter looked at him expectantly and Draco realised he hadn't said anything, too distracted by the way Potter had balled the cuffs of his sleeves in his hands and his tousled black hair that was even messier than usual.
He knew how Vernon and Petunia had treated him wasn’t ok. But his default was to pretend it was normal. It made him feel slightly less broken. And he was ok with that. He would rather bury his feeling deep inside than confront them. But the problem with that was you can only bury so many things before you start to overflow. And that was what he had done, spilled all his feeling for Draco to see, and he had listened. It was like a weight had lifted off his shoulders.
They didn’t have potions the next day but when he walked into the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom, the desks were pushed against the walls to clear a space in the centre of the room. Everyone gathered in the space and waited for the new professor to give them instructions. She explained that they would be practicing in pairs, which was convenient for Harry. He scanned the class and found Malfoy, Parkinson and Zabini standing at the back. He subtly edged closer to them, only half listening to the professor, until he was standing right next to them. He vaguely registered that they would be practicing casting non-verbal spells.
Most of all, he didn’t want to be friends, not really. But he would take any part of Harry he was willing to give. Even if it hurt him when Harry eventually remembered why he hated Draco in the first place.
“You were snoring,” Draco lied. He avoided looking at Harry, feeling tense. He almost expected Harry to start accusing him of being a creep.
He looked around. It was a nice spot. They were sitting under a willow tree and the branches of the tree hung down around them like yellow and green curtains, partially obscuring them form view. The sky was red and made the already autumnal landscape glow even more orange.
Draco thought of his mother, all alone in the manor with no one to talk to and nothing to keep her mind occupied. At least he now had Harry (whatever ‘had’ actually meant), but she had no one. He’d been sending her letters every week and she’d responded to every one straight away. He wished he was a better son. A better son would have insisted he stayed with her instead of abandoning her to go back to school. A better son would wright her every day. But he’d been distracted. And he found he didn’t really know what to tell her about what he’d been doing and how he was. He couldn’t exactly tell her he’d been spending most of his time pining after Harry Potter and thinking about him non stop. He could hardly find the words to put on the blank parchment every week beyond asking how she was and reporting how his classes were going.
“Well that’s not surprising when he’s being forced to share a room with Malfoy,” Ron said his name with disgust, like he couldn’t believe his friend was being put through something so terrible. Hermione rolled her eyes. “He’s probably terrified for his life. But that doesn’t explain the other stuff.”
Seeing Potter at the welcome feast with the newfound knowledge of his feelings and without a war or trial hanging over him, Draco wondered how he hadn’t noticed it before. His obsession with him was so obviously more than just hate. He craved his attention. He longed to be sitting on the other side of the Great Hall next to him. It made him feel pathetic.
"The ones you live with?" He had assumed Harry had some relatives that looked after him but he always pictured a perfect family. He definitely didn't expect him to have the kind of family that made him shrink in on himself as soon as he mentioned them.
Since he wasn’t awake, Harry couldn’t bother him with his incessant talking. But it turned out, even when unconscious, Harry found a way to torment him. Forty pages from the end of his book, Draco felt a pressure on his shoulder and something tickle his neck. He almost jumped at the contact and looked to his left, finding Harry’s head of messy black hair just a few inches from his face. Without Draco noticing, Harry’s head had lulled to the side until it rested lightly on his shoulder. He tensed up, staying as still as possible.
“Hey Draco?” There it was again. Harry saying his name, sending a thrill through Draco’s heart in a way only he could. He wasn’t sure he’d ever get used to it. It felt like a privilege he had to hold on to and hope to never loose.
Harry looked towards the stairs and sighed. He just wanted one year at Hogwarts without any complications. He was too tired to be constantly fighting with Malfoy.
Before he could stop himself, Draco looked up and green met blue as he caught Potter’s gaze. He was still wearing the same hoodie as earlier and Draco was staring to wish he would never wear it again, if only so he didn’t have to see him looking so soft. Potter looked away, embarrassed to be caught staring. Then, as if by reflex, looked back and when he realised Draco was still doing the same, he gave him a small smile.
As always, he was on his own. Though Harry had noticed that recently he was spending more time with Pansy and Blaise again. He felt an unexpected sense of relief to know that he wasn’t alone all the time. Harry had found himself worrying about Malfoy’s wellbeing a concerning amount over the last few weeks. Harry knew that really, Malfoy making up with his friends meant that he was no longer in need of another one. But all that did was leave Harry with the realisation that that he actually did genuinely want to be Malfoy’s friend. Plus, he still didn’t like how quiet it was in their room and he wanted to be able to talk to him.
Draco was almost certain McGonagall had put him with Potter so he could keep an eye on him. Or maybe she just thought he was less likely to mess with Potter, now that he was everyone’s Golden Boy, than the other eighth years. She would be right, if that was the reason. Draco wouldn’t dare touch a hair on Potter’s head. He didn’t even want to hurt him anymore. Maybe he never did. They sort of just decided to hate each other and that was how it was.
“Stop staring at Potter,” Pansy said in frustration. She had been talking at him and Blaise for the last hour, while they listened and drank their butterbeer. He had got distracted about ten minutes ago, when she had started talking about a girl from Durmstrang she had met during the summer. Usually Draco enjoyed talking to Pansy about girls but at that moment Potter and his friends had walked into the Hog’s Head. They’d pushed their way through the crowd and sat at a table with the other Gryffindors. Draco could see Potter through a gap in the crowd.
Pansy still looked concerned but she let it go. She knew it wasn’t easy to get Draco to talk about his feelings. “Because we’re going to Hogsmeade,” she said, as if it was obvious, as if they had talked about going together.
The movement had knocked his glasses from one ear and they had hung awkwardly, digging into Draco’s skin. Gently, he had taken them between his fingers, pulled them off and placed them on the grass.
It shouldn’t be too difficult. He could be nice to Malfoy, as long as he wasn’t being a dick back. And even that he could deal with, Ron could be an ass sometimes and that was one of the things he liked about him. Maybe he liked a bit of conflict. Did that make him weird? Probably. But he didn’t give a shit. He was determined to make Malfoy smile at least once this year. He was sick of looking at his moody face.
Harry picked up a knife and started cutting up the ingredients, following the instructions as best he could. They worked in silence together as he handed things to Malfoy and he expertly mixed them together. He seemed to know what he was doing without even looking at his book. Harry wasn’t surprised, Malfoy had always been better than everyone else at potions, except maybe Hermione. He used to think he did so well because Snape was the teacher, but watching him work with such precious and certainty, he could tell it came naturally to him.
One of the elves, who had previously been placing a plate of sausages on the Ravenclaw table, noticed them and immediately hurried over. “Harry Potter, sir! How lovely to see you! Can we get you anything?”
“I’ve told you; I’m not sitting with your stupid Gryffindor friends. I have my own.” Draco said. He had in fact told Harry this when he had brought up the fact that he looked miserable every time he ate dinner. He resented that comment even if it was in fact true and also implied that Harry had been watching him.
“Aren’t you cold?” Harry wasn’t cold, but he had been flying around a quidditch pitch for the last two hours. Malfoy, however, was wearing a thin blue jumper-which Harry noted was the same shade as his eyes when they reflected the sky-and had been sitting out here for Merlin knew how long.
Harry huffed and crossed his arms. He was suppressing a smile. He hadn’t scared Malfoy off. Somehow, he had forced himself into his life enough that he didn’t even question it anymore. He pointedly ignored the small nagging part of his brain that was asking why he cared so much. That was a problem for another day.
“Come on.” Harry walked up to the table full of food that hadn’t been sorted through yet and started filling up his plate. Neither spoke as they piled up their plates, Draco with more uncertainty than Harry.
Harry used to find it impossible to tell what Draco was thinking, his perfect poker face never giving anything away. It was like he constantly had a guard up, as if he was trying to hide what he felt. It was frustrating, but it also made it all the more rewarding when Harry caught a glimpse of emotion. He had started trying to make him laugh at every opportunity, just to see his eyes light up. It was the only time he was completely open.
Potter looked peaceful when he was asleep. Awake, he was always so tense and fidgety. It was one of the most irritating things about him. And perhaps one of the most endearing. The line that usually creased between his eyebrows was non-existent and his untameable hair that had always driven Draco mad, was a soft mess over his forehead. Draco’s heart hurt just looking at him.
“I-” Pepper, apparently unhappy with the lack of attention she was getting, jumped up onto the table. Draco jumped, he hadn’t seen the cat approach behind Potter. Subconsciously, he lifted a hand to pet her, then remembered that Potter was watching him and retracted it. He balled his hand into a fist and lowered in onto the table. Potter slid Draco’s ink pot away from Pepper’s swaying tail and said, “sorry, she sort of just does what she wants...”
So, he came up with a plan. First, he needed Malfoy to get used to him being around without thinking it was weird. He had already permanently moved to the seat besides Malfoy in potions. The first and second time he had done this, Malfoy had regarded him with confusion and surprise, now he would just sigh as if it was what he expected. They’d work together in silence, Harry occasionally attempted to start a conversation, which Malfoy responded to with short answers and refusal to hold the conversation.
"It is a big deal." Draco couldn't believe Harry seemed so unbothered by this. Who makes a child sleep in a cupboard? He wasn't sure what else to say. He thought Harry had had a perfect life. He could tell by Harry's reluctance talk about it that there was more he wasn't telling him. He hadn't even meant to tell him this much.He felt suddenly angry towards Harry's family for treating him so badly. But that felt hypocritical. Hadn't he treated Harry just as badly? Draco felt a wave of guilt and frowned down at the grass.
“Maybe you shouldn’t stay up all night playing quidditch,” Draco said just as quietly. He was irrationally unsure whether he was allowed to mention the night before. He was still waiting for Harry to get bored and stop talking to him. It felt easier to give him the option to back out if he wanted to, to pretend this last month never happened and go back to hating each other. But now Draco knew how it could be, he desperately didn’t want that to happen. He wanted Harry to seek him out when he thought he didn’t want to be found. It was becoming apparent he always wanted Harry to find him. He wanted Harry to smile at him the way he did last night, with his eyes crinkled around the edges and his nose scrunched up in the most adorable way.
He started to protest but then caught Hermione’s eye and gave up. He narrowed his eyes at her and she shrugged. “Malfoy...” Harry mumbled.
“Oh please, Draco it’s so obvious. We’ve known about your crush on Potter for years.” Draco almost choked on his drink but played it off as if her words didn’t affect him. He gave her an offended look, as if he was repulsed by the idea.
He got up and held a hand out to Draco. With a resigned sigh, forcing himself to let the subject go, he reached up, took his hand and let Harry pull him to his feet.
“Why were you sitting with Malfoy?” Ron asked, making it sound like he was worried for Harry’s mental health.
He planned to lay low, keep out of trouble and get on with his work. If he was a perfect student they wouldn’t be able to find an excuse to expel him, which he knew they would at the first opportunity. He told himself he was probably being paranoid. Why would they have invited him back to Hogwarts if they weren’t willing to give him a chance? But it was hard not to think that way. People had been nothing but cold to him over the summer. He had been to Diagon Alley a few times to get things for school and for his mother. The way people had looked at him had made him want to disappear, to hide away from their glares. That was something he never thought he would hope for. He was an attention seeker, always had been. But now attention was the last thing he wanted. All he could think about when they looked at him like that was that the looks were justified.
He didn’t realise he was shivering until Malfoy pulled out his wand, waved it around a bit and then felt the air heat up around him.
Harry went to agree, because that was the reason he started bothering Draco in the first place, wasn’t it? But then he stopped. He hadn’t really thought about it since he’d first sat with Malfoy in potions, something he did now without thinking. But it wasn’t like that anymore. He liked Draco, and he liked spending time with him.
The whole time Harry was at Hogsmeade he had been distractedly thinking about his short interaction with Malfoy. He knew the other students weren’t very friendly with him, he’d seen so much himself, but he didn’t think they would actually attack him. And he could tell it wasn’t the first time it had happened. He saw it in the resigned look in Malfoy’s eye and the way he didn’t even try to defend himself. He had just let the other boy push him around. Harry wasn’t sure what might have happened if he hadn’t been there and he didn’t want to find out. It wasn’t like Malfoy couldn’t defend himself either, he was a talented wizard. Though Harry would never let him know he thought so. He was already so full of himself. Or he used to be…
It was while he was looking for one of these hiding spots that he ended up accidentally following Malfoy through the halls. At first, he had genuinely wanted to go the same way as Malfoy, but then curiosity got the best of him. He wanted to know where Malfoy went when he wasn’t hogging their room. At first he thought he was aimlessly walking the halls like him, but then he stopped at the doors of the library and went inside. Only then did Harry realise he was no where near where he wanted to be and had to walk back the way he came, glad no one could see him under his cloak.
“Yeah, but he keeps sneaking off and he’s so distracted all the time,” Ron insisted. “And he’s nearly fallen asleep in class at least three times this week.”
“Right. Obviously.” Having grown up with Muggles, Harry didn’t naturally turn to magic as the solution to all his problems. “Can I sit?”
He was already in dangerous territory. His stupid little school boy crush had turned into something much more destructive and terrifying. He could deal with a crush. He could ignore it, pretend it didn’t exist and wait for it to go away. But love? What the fuck was he supposed to do about that?
“Please,” Pansy said, pouting. She had clearly deciding that emotional manipulation was the best way to get Draco to agree with her. And it was working. “We never see you anymore.”
Malfoy gave him a bewildered look. For a moment he looked like he was going to argue, his lips parted, but no words escaped. He abruptly shut his mouth, his features that were previously set in an expression of confusion, now in one of annoyance. He pointedly ignored Harry and looked back to the book he had been reading. A few strands of his blonde hair fell loose with the movement from where they had been neatly pushed back. Harry had the sudden urge to brush them back into place. He noted that he no longer slicked it back but rather let it fall in natural waves over his forehead, which he brushed back with his fingers to keep out of his eyes. It made him look less severe and more soft. Harry preferred it that way.
Hermione thought of Harry switching tables in potions to sit with Malfoy, of all the times he’d snuck off to the library or to hide up in his room. She thought of all the times she’d seen Harry looking over at the Slytherin table and the grin that formed when he caught Malfoy’s eye. Malfoy would just roll his eyes and look away but even from the other side of the hall Hermione could see that he was suppressing a smile. It had been slightly jarring the first time she’d seen it happen. Now it was a common occurrence and the only thing she took note of was the fact that Malfoy had relented and started smiling back.
He felt that same longing as he looked at him then. He was laughing at something Weasley had said, his smile lighting up his face and the room around him. With a lump in his throat, Draco turned back to his cauldron. The frown didn’t leave his face for the rest of the lesson.
He turned to look at him then. He had always been infuriatingly handsome. It wasn't fair. It would be so much easier to hate him if he wasn't so goddamn attractive. With his scruffy black hair that was practically begging Draco to run his hands through it, either to smooth it out or mess it up more. He wasn't fussy. His brown skin was perfect and smooth, not a spot in sight, the only imperfection being the scar on his forehead. And even that was to be admired, though Harry had a habit of hiding it under his hair, as if that would stop people recognising him. His eyes were so green it almost looked unnatural. Draco had wondered on more than one occasion what he would look like in Slytherin robes. His eyes found themselves drifting down to his lips, they were slightly parted and so very tempting. He'd never looked at him up close for this long before.
“Not really. I used to visit Dobby a lot... when he worked here.” Harry’s good mood seemed to dampen considerably at the mention of the dead elf and Draco was reminded of how different he and Harry really were. He hadn’t thought about his old house elf since the last time he’d seen him. Harry on the other hand clearly cared just as much about the loss of a lowly elf as he did about the death of another wizard. And although Draco found it odd, he couldn’t help the twinge of sympathy at the sight of Harry’s small frown.
Harry’s face lit up again and despite himself Draco’s lips twitched into a smile. Something about Harry wanting him there supporting him made his heart grow about three sizes.
Harry smiled at him when they reached the doors and clapped a hand on Draco’s shoulder. It was the kind of gesture you saw guys do with their friends because they thought they were too manly to hug. “See you later, then.” Harry let go of his shoulder with a squeeze, his fingers brushing down Draco’s arm as he lowered it and walked away. Draco’s hand followed as if it were magnetically attached to Harry’s.
With the ease of someone with casts wordless spells all the time, Malfoy flicked his wand in a small and precise movement. Harry waited for the spell to hit him, bracing for some kind of pain or discomfort but he felt nothing. He looked down at himself in confusion. “Did it work?”
Just like always at the mention of eating in the great hall, Draco seemed reluctant. Harry understood. He had tried to convince his friends to come with him to eat in the kitchens. The house elves had been very welcoming when he visited them a week into term, telling him they would cook anything for the saviour of the Wizarding World. He wasn’t one to abuse his power as the ‘Chosen One’ but when it came to food, he might have to make an exception. Besides, they seemed more than happy to set aside a meal for him. But when he had proposed this idea to his friends, they had called him antisocial and told him he should try to enjoy Hogwarts as a normal student for once. Ron had been more reluctant at the mention of extra food but in the end, he had sided with Hermione.
Malfoy stopped when he heard Hermione open the door and quickly drew his hand back. He didn’t look guilty, just a bit startled at being caught. Probably because Harry wasn’t actually aware of what he was doing, since he was asleep.
Harry had always been bad at naming things. He had sat in his dreary kitchen at the table, watching his new kitten eat from the bowl of food he had brought for her and tried to think of a good name. After about five minutes he had already given up and slumped back in his chair. His eyes had settled on the salt and pepper shakers sitting in the middle of his wooden kitchen table and thought, that’s as good as anything.
And then he had refused to shake his hand, and all his childish expectations were crushed. Granted, he had just made fun of Harry’s new friend, which was probably not the best way to go about getting on his good side. It’s not his fault his father had taught him to dislike the Weasley’s. He can’t say that Weasley had done anything to change his mind anyway.
“I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to scare you,” Harry said, taking a step back from his bed. He had his wand in hand, lit so Draco could see him clearly in the darkness.
"Just get under the cloak," he insisted as he lifted one side of the cloak, gesturing for Draco to stand next to him.
Harry faltered for a second, thinking maybe he was going to be partnering with Pansy or Blaise. That would leave him stuck with the other as he’d abandoned his own friends. In their first practical lesson with her, him, Hermione and Ron had tried to work as a three, but she had told them she wouldn’t allow any special treatment and that he would have to find a partner like the rest of the class. He would usually pair up with Neville, he felt kind of guilty about leaving him on his own now. He could see him looking around for him, wondering why he wasn’t there.
“What are you doing?” Malfoy was looking at the other students as if checking that they weren’t watching and Harry was pulling some kind of prank. Realising that they were all absorbed in their own conversations and paying no attention to them he looked back at Harry and frowned.
Despite being fully aware of this, he knew he would just let it happen, because what else was he going to do? Tell Harry to stop, to never speak to him again? Like he had the will power to look Harry in the eye and tell him to leave him alone. Harry made everything easier. When he started to believe the words of other students, of the Prophet, Harry would be there to show him it didn’t matter. If
Potter pointed at the miniature eighth year dorm rooms where he could see each of his classmates labelled and sleeping in their beds. Just under Potter's finger were two footprints, one standing just behind the other, labelled 'Harry Potter' and 'Draco Malfoy'. Draco said nothing for a second. It was an extremely impressive piece of magic, but he didn't want to admit that to Potter. Instead, he did what he always did, tried to irritate Potter as much as possible. "Is this what you used to stalk me in 6th year?"
“Malfoy’s coming back?” he asked, sounding slightly more interested then he had intended. They didn’t seem to notice however as they just grimaced and nodded in answer.
Neither had Potter apparently, Draco still thought he was amazing. Just like everyone else, maybe even more so. He was still brave, strong and good, everything Draco wanted to be but wasn’t. He wanted to hate him so badly, and for a long time, he’d convinced himself that he did. It took seeing Potter’s lifeless body in Hagrid’s arms to make him realise it wasn’t true.
"Really?" An image of eleven year old Harry in his oversized clothes and cute little smile popped into his head. He didn't know how anyone could not want to be friends with him.
He had decided the universe must have a wicked sense of humour, putting him in a room with Harry bloody Potter of all people. He felt like he was being punished. Someone, somewhere was definitely laughing at him.
“What are you doing?” Draco’s voice wobbled, making him realise only then that he was shaking. He balled his hands into fists, trying to hide their tremor from Harry. Through his dwindling panic he felt embarrassment start to rise up, and with it a guardedness. Harry wasn’t supposed to see him like this, vulnerable and fragile. He did the only thing he knew how to do when he felt venerable, he glared at Harry as if it were his fault.
Malfoy still didn’t look up. He turned to the next page of his book as if he was hardly aware of Harry’s presence. “It’s called a warming charm Potter.”
“I said, let him go!” There was a warning in his voice that seemed to make the Hufflepuff reconsider his chances. It was two against one and Harry wasn't backing down.
“Alright,” Malfoy agreed, his refusal to speak to Harry apparently winning against his want to disagree with him on principle.
Hermione paused then, choosing her words carefully, she said, “Him and Malfoy seem to be getting on fine…”
Malfoy gave one last glare towards his friends before facing Harry properly and raising his wand. It was odd standing in front of Malfoy while he pointed a wand at him and not feeling at all threatened. He supposed he should feel at least a little wary but he found that for some reason he trusted Malfoy not to hurt him.
He was thinking about why Potter had defended him earlier. He hadn't meant to snap at him but he was confused and embarrassed that Potter had seen him being so vulnerable. He didn’t want his help. He was able to defend himself. Not that he had been trying to. He couldn't, it would only end in him getting the blamed for starting the fight in the first place. He hadn’t started it, of course. He had been walking back from the library, when he realised he was being followed. Before he could even register it properly, he had felt a hand on his shoulder that pulled him around to face an angry looking, brown haired Hufflepuff. He had almost laughed, Hufflepuffs weren’t very intimidating. But the look in the boys eyes was so hateful he kept his mouth shut.
House-elves were rushing around, setting up the four large tables in the centre of the room. The overwhelming smell of sausage, bacon, egg, toast and more filled his nose as he stepped into the room. It made his stomach rumble with hunger.
Most of the time he wasn’t in classes, Harry was spending time with Hermione and Ron in the common room. They’d play wizard’s chess or Hermione would force them to do their homework or sometimes they’d just sit in silence, enjoying each other’s company. He liked spending time so much with his friends again, but more often than not he would find himself being either too restless to be sitting around so much or wanting to be alone.
She mentally shook herself out of her thoughts. Eventually she would talk to Ron about it, but she wanted to be sure before she did that. She wanted to put off Ron’s inevitable freak out at the idea of Harry liking Malfoy for as long as possible.
He had been jealous of her and Weasley ever since they befriended Potter in first year. At one point he had hated her more than anyone else. In fourth year, when everyone thought her and Potter were together. Of course, it was stupid of him to believe any of those articles in The Profit. It was clear to anyone with eyes that Weasley was in love with Granger and that she felt the same, no matter how much she would have denied it.
“Yeah, can you believe it? We have to spend another year with him.” Harry wasn’t sure how he felt about Malfoy anymore. He was still a pompous git as far as Harry knew, but he’d defended him at his trial for a reason. He believed the other boy felt guilty about what he had been a part of and wanted to be better. But that didn’t mean Harry would be happy to see him again.
When he did wake up in the middle of the night, breathing heavily with sweat dripping off his forehead and soaking into his pillow, it was impossible to get back to sleep. His late night walks had become a regular thing, every time he’d slip out the door, hoping not to be overheard and would return just before he usually woke up. He had hoped no one had noticed, especially Malfoy.
Everyone else had gone to their rooms to unpack, leaving only Harry, holding Pepper, Malfoy and McGonagall standing in the middle of the common room. Hermione had been right, about half of their year had returned, the amount of Gryffindors making up for the lack of Slytherins. Malfoy, Pansy and Blaise were the only Slytherins to come back. They had stood awkwardly at the back of the group as McGonagall read off the names of who would be sharing a room with who. Every student was sharing a room with someone form a different house. McGonagall said they had decided the house system caused too much rivalry between students. New students were still being sorted into houses but they were separated by year for their dormitories and common rooms. The eighth year common room was very similar to the old Gryffindor one but with neutral colours. It was a large circular room with a few archways that led to the dorm rooms and there was a huge fireplace with lots of sofas circled around it.
“Harry agrees with me! Don’t you Harry?” At the sound of Ron saying his name, Harry whipped his head around from where he had been stating at the bookshelf Malfoy had just disappeared behind.
In the end he decided, or was forced really, to keep her. He had to admit she was good company. It got kind of lonely living in Grimmauld Place on his own, it was a lot of space for just one person. Hermione tried to convince him to decorate the house to make it feel more homely but he couldn't find the motivation. He didn't plan on staying there for long anyway, it was just convenient for now. He had connected the building to electricity though. He didn't care if the wizarding world refused to use it, he wanted to watch TV when he got bored. Mr Weasley had been beside himself when Harry had let him use the remote when he'd invited him and the other Weasley's round for dinner.
As usual Draco finished before everyone else, not even Granger was better than him at potions. Though whether that was because she had to supervise Potter and Weasley or because Draco was actually better, he wasn’t sure.
Draco had his feet up with his knees to his chest while Harry’s legs were sprawled half on, half off the seat, with one knee bent up and the other hanging off the edge. Malfoy was leaning over his bent legs, the pot of nail varnish in one hand and the brush in the other. Pepper was curled up on the seat between them looking very comfortable. Had Hermione not known that Harry and Malfoy had formed some weird friendship over the last few months she would have been surprised. Pepper generally only liked whoever Harry liked and tried to scratch anyone else, but she seemed perfectly happy with her head against Malfoy’s ankle. They looked cosy. Like it was something they did all the time without a thought, sitting together so close and comfortable.
“So are you going to tell us why you’ve suddenly decided to ditch us for Malfoy in all our classes?” Hermione asked later that day in the common room. She was sitting with her back against a sofa that Ron was spread out over. Pepper was curled up in her lap while Ron played with her hair, attempting, and failing, to plait it. Harry was sitting in a worn puffy armchair across from them, trying to ignore the small pang of jealousy he felt at their closeness.
