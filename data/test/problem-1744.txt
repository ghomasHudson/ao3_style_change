“My apologies mother, I should to go floo Blaise about this, see if we can get the Prophet off my back and then I’m off to the ministry for my interview with the Aurors.” Draco sighed as he kissed the back of his mother’s hand and left the kitchen holding his tea in one hand and the paper in the other. The day promised to be a miserable one and he wanted to make sure he was prepared for all possible outcomes. All Draco could hope for was that this new development did not make things with Harry worse than they already were, if that was even possible
“Will you open it already!”
“Yes but…”
"Auror Potter, as you can see the summation of my investigation is that Solicitor Malfoy, while he broke the law by creating the cursed object, did not in fact curse you." Auror Wheeler informed Harry as he too removed his head from the pensive. The Auror had shown Harry professional curtesy and allowed him to see his findings before anyone else. "However, there is no doubt in the mind of the Unspeakable that tested you after you were admitted into St. Mungo's that early on in your courtship of Mr. Malfoy that you were indeed under the influence of a love spell." Wheeler informed him, like Harry needed reminding of the embarrassing fact that he had allowed a mild gag of a spell to take hold on him. "Now of course the questions are, who and for what purpose."
“Why are you being so stubborn, darling the best way to get over a bad relationship is to have a good hard fuck, trust me.” She smiled her lightly glossed lips glinting delicately in the romantic lighting. She had changed over the years, soften her look. She was deceptively approachable with her expertly cut hair, feminine light pink robes and soft make up. Deep down Pansy was a vicious and jaded viper who protected her friends fiercely, her hatred for Harry more intense than ever. It had taken Draco nearly a year to mend the bridge that had been destroyed between them when he had started dating Harry. She hated the man on principal and refused to relent, but she had missed him as much as he had missed her and eventually she had come around as she always did. However, whenever Harry had been around her eyes sharped and her demeanor changed, while she had wanted to keep her friendship with Draco, Pansy had refused to accept the Boy Who Lived and with good reasons she was fond of reminding Draco every chance she got.
“Harry, oh fuck yes!” Draco screamed nearly lifting of the desk as Harry brushed his prostate, Draco was such a vocal lover something he had been pleasantly surprised to discover the first time Harry had made love to him. Draco continues to moan and call out Harry’s name as the brunette quicken his pace, soon he was moving at a near brutal speed as Draco shoved back against him meeting him trust for trust. Pleasure wrapped around Harry as the he buried himself in Draco over and over again, letting the lure that seeped from the blonde sweep him away and pull him into a world were there was only Draco and their bodies buckling frantically searching for release
His mind supplied as he stared at the blonde. It had been too long since they had spent any time alone at all and Harry craved the intimacy they had shared.
“Ok now you are over estimating that Bitch Seeker’s reach and credibility, besides now that you’re a dark wizard again you are even sexier.” She persisted, Draco knew she would continue to push him towards dating and sex even if it killed her.
“How are you Madge,” He said sitting behind his desk and rubbing his temple trying to alleviate some of the throbbing.
“I’ve already filed charges of discrimination against the Ministry Prosecutor’s office they had no right to suspend you without cause. We have been over all your cases at the firm and there has not been any prosecutorial misconduct on your part and the fact that you are under a personal investigating has nothing to do with your job.” Blaise said heatedly, Draco knew he would never find a more loyal friend. He also saw right through Blaise’s scheme, he was trying to distract Draco from the ashes of what once had been his nearly perfect life.
“Because you are ridiculously rich. Besides you love blowing away Lucius’s money.” Blaise reminded Draco who saw no point in pointing out to Blaise that he and Pansy were equally as ridiculously rich as he was, well nearly so.
“While he can’t see it now, I do believe that the end of his marriage to Harry is the best thing that has happened to Draco in a long time. He now has the chance of finding someone who will love him like he deserves, for exactly who he is including his faults.”
Harry looked around the library at Spinner’s End where most of the dark artifacts in the home were located. He and Ron had performed a diagnostic spell to match the list of dangerous artifacts and nothing came up missing yet the place had been ransacked, chairs and tables turned over, most of the books were thrown across the library floor along with parchments and other nicknacks that had once belonged to Professor Snape. Obviously the intruder had been searching for something specific and had trashed the entire house in the pursuit.  Nothing seemed to have been taken but Harry knew it would take weeks to sort everything out.
Draco caught Harry’s death glare as he and his solicitor quickly left the courtroom. Draco allowed himself to be dragged out of the courtroom through opposite exit. How he wanted to chase after Harry and make him listen, but he knew it would be useless. Harry Potter was the most stubborn person he had ever met and until he was ready to talk Draco knew there was no getting through to his soon to be ex husband. The pathetic truth was that Draco was willing to wait for Harry for as long as it took. He would do anything to get Harry back, his pride be damned.
If it at was possible for Draco to look more flustered, Harry didn't care. He wanted the blonde as intensely as he always did, clearly Draco wanted it too after that stunt he tried to pull. But Draco wouldn't be in control today. "Take off your robes," said Harry evenly. "Now."
"I know how the rest of the story goes, thank you." Harry interrupted Wheeler, unable to hear anymore how royally he had screwed things up with Draco. He was feeling confused and angry at himself. Harry needed to get out of the lab, out of the ministry. He needed to get fresh air and clear his head. He walked out in the middle of his conversation with Wheeler unable to hear anything else. He apparated directly to Ron and Hermione’s flat.
“Papa, can I ask you a question?” Rory finally asked tentatively as Draco guided the four year old to sit in her favorite spot under the large willow tree next to the pond in the back gardens of Malfoy Manor. Hermione had brought Aurora to the manor after breakfast for their first supervised visitation, after the first ten minutes of hugs and kisses from both Draco and Narcissa they had moved outside to the garden for tea and biscuits where the little girl had excitedly explained all she had been doing for the past several months, the little one was so animated that the warming charms Draco cast over her seemed pointless. The moment was extremely bittersweet for Draco. While he was bursting with happiness at being able to see and touch Aurora for the first time in months, listening to the little imp made him realized how much he had missed.
“We should get a few trainees to run inventory.” Ron said walking back into the dark library.
“Mr. Malfoy you have just admitted on the record that you created the curse that was cast on Auror Potter.”
“You can keep lying to yourself, but I’m finished playing this game. You are going to an engagement party. Your engagement party!” Harry spat back turning Draco around to face him. All Draco felt at that moment had been frustration. He had explained a million times that the engagement would not be real. He would talk to Astoria in private and let her down easy. After that he would tackle his parents but that would all take time. Astoria and his marriage represented the respectability amongst their peers that his parents so desperately wanted to regain. The war had been hard for them and they saw his marriage as a last hope at respectability once again.
“Please don’t cry mon petit ange, I promise we will see each other very soon.” Draco said hugging his crying daughter one more time in an effort to soothe her. The fact that his life had come to such moments left a bitter taste in his mouth. Draco would do anything to spare his little girl the pain and damage the situation was causing.
“Don’t say it, everything will sort itself out and we will be back in business. They can’t afford to lose you; Roshan is great but she can’t run the prosecution on her own.” She interrupted in her ever optimistic and frankly overly idealistic views. Draco remember the first time Harry laid eyes on the young girl with her perky attitude and even perkier body, he had been annoyed and jealous stating that Madge with her good looks and pure blood status would make him a better spouse, Draco had gone on to show him on that very desk who was the perfect partner for him. He sighed deeply, it was impossible to go anywhere without remembering Harry.
“That’s a bit of pot kettle, darling. Since you’re the only whore at this table.” Blaise shrugged his shoulders in agreement, a sly look on his face causing the other two to barely contain their laughter.  “And now I think it’s Draco’s turn to whore around a bit. Honestly darling besides that dimwitted creature you married how many sex partners have you had?” The question brought Blaise to attention as well, both his friends looked at Draco intensely as the waited for him to answer. Draco knew that they both thought he had only ever slept with Harry, which of course wasn’t true but he would never admit his lack of experience and the fact that there had only been a short lived relationship with a wizard who had also had messy black hair and green eyes. Facts which Draco was not prepared to explore too deeply, he already knew he was pathetic.
“There is no question about it. You messed up royally. What are you going to do about it?”
“Give me twenty minutes to get ready.” Draco said and Blaise burst out laughing loudly, he could hear Pansy’s giggle in the background.
“Please call me Narcissa, how many years now have we been interacting in the same circles?” Narcissa turned to watch the young woman carefully, her blue gaze intense all softness gone from her face.
“That is correct, I searched for months until I found what I believed to be the right curse. I needed help procuring some of the ingredients but once it was all done I couldn’t go through with it.” Draco confessed, he knew he sounded as pathetic as he had that night all those years ago, he couldn’t help it the Veritaserum wouldn’t let him lie. Wheeler flicked his wrist and the parchment and quill lay in front of Draco on the table.
It had started with a fight, just like everything else between them always had. But that night as Harry bumped into Draco late in the deserted hallway leading to the dungeons things had gone differently. They had sneered, insulted and as always came to blows, but when his hand came into contact with Draco’s skin Harry had felt a searing jolt of magic pass through him. A delicious burning began at the pit of his stomach and made its way through is entire body, his fists softened and he held on to Draco for dear life trying to make the sensation last for as long as possible. The best part had been seeing Draco come undone by the mere touch, they had come together as if by an invisible force and snogged madly. After Draco had pulled a great disappearing act, leaving Harry wanting and frustrated. That’s when Harry had developed his stalking skills, once he had found the object if his new found obsession, Draco had finally admitted his Veela heritage and his theories concerning Harry while the dark haired boy sucked his cock as if his life depended on it. The relationship developed slowly, and both reluctantly gave into the pleasure that a mere touch would cause until they were meeting nearly every night unable to be apart from one another longer than a day or two. Until what Harry was now referring to as The Big Fight.
“Mr Malfoy, we just gave you something to calm you down. Your parents are on their way.” Draco heard a muffled voice inform him as he was guided to lay down on a stiff hospital bed. He felt someone taking off his ruined outer robes and the silk scarf with it. Draco tried to protest but the sedative dragged him under a sea of darkness. Maybe when he woke up Harry would be there telling him that it had all been a nightmare. Thunder always gave Harry nightmares.
Draco tried again to use his charm but Harry was ready for it and he flicked it away with the small amount of occlumency he was starting to learn. He knew Draco well by now and understood his charm in such a way that he knew how to deflect it with only some effort, he was going to be in control as he made Draco his. As the influence left him, though he felt it enter Draco's body instead and Draco suddenly couldn't control himself.
“I...” Ron started a deep flush on his face, but Harry put his hand up and silenced his best friend, what was the point of continuing on that conversation. Everyone seemed so willing to give Draco the benefit of the doubt, even Ron but the only reason they were so opened minded was because they had not been the one lied to, manipulated and cursed! They had not been the one who loved the man with a desperate passion that wouldn’t go away, and that was the crux of the matter, Harry couldn’t stop loving Malfoy. He tried very hard to hate him, but he just missed Draco, he missed him with every fiber of his being. He missed waking up next to him in their cramped flat, Rory and Teddy barging in to their bedroom in the mornings. He missed the chaotic family life they had shared, sitting down by the fire at night after the kids were in bed and just being held by Draco. Harry missed being loved by his husband and it was killing him to know it had all been a lie. Draco never really loved him, their entire relationship had been a magical curse.
Harry couldn't take it anymore and pulled his head out of the pensive, his own eyes moist with unshed tears. Draco didn't do it. He had been telling the truth the whole time and Harry had pushed him away, accusing him of lying and being low and conniving. He felt his heart break a little as he thought back at everything he had said and done to Draco for the past two months.
“We might be able to get you visitation rights depending on who’s hearing the case, but Draco you must be prepared for the worst. I’m truly sorry.” Once again Draco could hear the sincerity in his friends voice, Blaise and Pansy were the only ones that truly knew the depth of his pain, they were the only ones that knew the whole truth behind the wizarding world’s latests scandal.
“Twat.” Draco yelled when he heard Blaise telling Pansy to get comfortable as the dark haired wizard disconnected the call.
“I know, it’s a sign the nargles are coming for you.” Draco always teased back, making Harry laugh and shove at him playfully.
“I thought that the current owner refused to sell you the house.”
“No,” He cut her off, sipping from his own glass. Draco looked around the fancy restaurant located in wizarding France and felt out of place. It had been years since he had stepped foot in a place that required dress robes. For the past five years he had gone to dinky, questionable looking establishments. Harry always insisted on obscure, small checked tablecloth restaurants, places were muggles wore simple jumpers and torn jeans. The opulence of his surroundings only served to remind him of the parts of his life he had given up in an effort to keep Harry happy, to show the man he loved that he had changed and deserved to be his partner. If he was truly honest with himself he had missed the glittering chandeliers, the tuxedoed waiters and culinary delights of a classy restaurant.
Harry pulled nearly all the way out before he slammed back into Draco with hard sure strokes, the blonde nearly screamed grabbing the edge of the desk in a white knuckled grip. After a few more strokes Harry found what he had been looking for
“I’m not hungry, I’ll see you guys in the morning.” He rushed out of the great hall hoping to catch up with Draco and Theo, there was no way in hell he was allowing anyone touch what was his, because regardless of their fight Draco was his.  Five minutes of frantically searching each possible hallway Draco could have taken Harry glimpsed a flash of white blond hair disappear into a rarely used classroom on the second floor. He took a deep breath hoping to control his anger, the last thing he needed was to open that door and kill Theodore Fucking Nott on the spot. That would not be the best way to win back his mate.
Malfoy quickly composed his face back into the cold stare he had taken to giving Harry lately but it was too late. Harry had seen that Draco wanted him. He saw his opportunity and knew he had an advantage. He didn't hesitate to press it. Harry looked at Malfoy intently and made his way over to the desk where he sat, his look frozen in his face as Harry came closer. It wasn't often that Draco relinquished control of their private moments but Harry had had enough of being rebuffed and ignored, their relationship treated as if it had been a figment of Harry’s imagination. Draco’s blatant flirting and using his allure on others, enough was enough.
“I’ve already told you, I will tell them. Tonight simply is not the right time.”
“Yes well now I have another reason to cross paths with Malfoy.” The universe was conspiring against him. Draco Malfoy was Snape’s only living heir.
He handed Ron the note and watched the emotions run across the expressive face. “Lion-Heart Manor. Isn’t that the Potter family’s ancestral home?”
“I wanted to thank you Mrs. Granger-Weasley for bringing my granddaughter for this visit.” The older woman said as she held her dainty tea cup delicately in her slim hands. The years had been kind to Narcissa who looked as if time did not dare mar her beauty. With the slight breeze blowing through her blonde hair and her face relaxed in a sweet smile as she watched her son and granddaughter Narcissa was possibly one of the most beautiful women Hermione had ever seen. Yet she still felt slightly uncomfortable around the older witch, never really able to relax and enjoy the other’s company. Perhaps it was the setting or the fact that no matter how valiantly they all tried to forget the past certain things just lingered bitterly in the fringes of the mind.
“I don’t know Harry, maybe you should talk to him. Find out what is going on.” Hermione said, always the voice of reason but Harry wouldn’t have any of it, if she’d seen the images of a young Malfoy cursing Harry she wouldn’t be so reasonable. Harry remembered how shock everyone had been when he had publicly pursued the Malfoy heir even though he had been set to marry Ginny.
Draco couldn’t help the unnatural need to speak, to spill all his deep dark secrets to the people in the room and his inner Slytherin rebelled against it. He could feel a few beads of sweat tickling down his forehead and his heart beating erratically, it was the first time he had been hit with such a strong dose of veritaserum. The healer checked his vitals and declared him ready to be interviewed.
“I could never be angry with you mon petit ange.” He reassured her, soothing her fears and cursing himself and Harry for causing their daughter anxiety. She was just four years old and the whole nasty manner should had never reached her, he had swore he would be a different father to his children than his own had been to him, yet here was his little girl suffering because if his actions. His heart harden a little towards Harry, how could they both had allowed this mess to touch their children.
“M’Lords, my client is not satisfied with the ruling. He feels that the welfare of his child is compromised while in the company of Solicitor Malfoy...” Warner, Harry’s high power solicitor argued from the opposite side of the room where Harry sat stone like and staring solely at the members of the Wizengamot hearing the custody case, never allowing his eyes to wonder to the table where Draco and his team were arguing their own case for custodial rights. Draco couldn’t help stealing glances of Harry’s rigid form wishing he would glance his way even if just for a second. The whole scene had a sense of deja vu, as if they where back in Hogwarts and Draco was vying for Harry’s attention. Draco wanted nothing more than to have those emerald eyes trained on him was again.
There was only Draco, Draco’s taste in his mouth, Draco’s tight hole like a steel grip on his cock. Draco’s horsed cries of pleasure, a pleasure only Harry was able to give him. Draco writhe desperately under him as Harry slowed his movements to a painfully slow rhythm that brought the blonde to the edge but didn’t allow him to crash back down to earth. Harry lowered his body to cover Draco’s as he sought out that spot on his neck again, sinking his teeth making Draco arch his back as he came chanting Harry’s name like a prayer. Harry nearly died of pleasure as Draco’s hole, hot and wet tightened almost painfully around him drawing all the air from his lungs as he shot his seed in long hot spurts into the inviting body wrapped around him, filling the blonde like never before.
“Face it Pans we all know how quickly you get around.”
“Its covered in blood.” The mediwitch said softly and Draco’s eyes blurred from the intense focused on the now red scarf. His chest tightened and he felt dizzy. It was his blood. Harry's blood had soaked the scarf and made it an angry red. Draco’s hands began to shake and the mediwitch touched his slender shoulder lightly. “Honey, you need to go home and rest. I’ll tell whoever you want to pick you up. Who can I call?” But Draco ignored her words. In fact, he couldn’t make out what the woman was saying to him because his ears where ringing from the rush of blood and his eyes burned from all the tears he had shed in the span of an hour. He withdrew into himself, to a place where Harry still laughed brightly at everything, where he trained gracefully, powerful magic swirling around him. A place where there was no thunder, no crowded impersonal emergency room, and where Draco was not alone. Draco fidgeted with the diamond ring on his finger... he had forgotten it was there.
“A little over ten years ago, I was sixteen and a student at Hogwarts.” Draco said answering more than he had been asked, and all he wanted was to ripped his own tongue out.
“He said I was ashamed of him.” Draco whispered sniffling, when he went to wiped her nose he saw it again, the silk scarf still spotted with Harry’s blood. Draco had been clutching it since the same mediwitch had come out to see him holding a clear  bag with the words “Patient Belongings” printed on it in blue block letters. The scarf had been a gift, a ‘we’ve only been seeing each other for two weeks but I’m crazy about you gift’. Harry had spotted the beautiful silver scarf when they had been looking for a set of dress robes for Draco and fell in love with it. Draco still remembered Harry’s look of disappointment at the price tag and how he exclaimed it would take him six months or more for him to afford it. So Draco bought it for him without blinking and demanded he accept it as an anniversary gift. “This used to be silver.”
“Why do you do that to yourself?” Blaise’s concern voice broke though Draco’s dark thought and the blonde looked up at his childhood friend with red rimmed eyes and despair clear.
“The only words I’m willing to exchange with Malfoy are the words for the spell to break our bond. He destroyed my life Hermione, I was in love with Ginny. We were going to get married, I was finally going to be happy and have a normal life with a wife and kids.” Harry said tears flowing freely once again.
Harry decide to ignore the pointy git and his blatant flirting with Nott, what Draco Malfoy did these days was absolutely none of Harry’s business. That was the beauty of breaking up, Harry no longer cared what Draco did or in this instance whom he did. That’s what he told himself as he tore his gaze from the Slytherin table and tried to focus on what Hermione was saying in regards to their potions class. The class he had spend staring a hole into the back of Malfoy’s head and praying he would look back and make eye contact with him, of course Draco ignored him as if he was invisible and worked diligently with his new potions partner, Theodore Fucking Nott.
“I fail to see how my sex life is any of your concern.” Draco answered primly. Blaise went back to his dessert, fully aware they would get no answer and Pansy just rolled her eyes and took another sip of the rich red wine.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m fine, a bit overwhelmed trying to divide your cases up between Solicitor Gibbon and Roshan.” Draco rolled his eyes at the news, Roshan was an eager and competent Solicitor while Gibbon was barely worth the title. “Indeed, you can only imagine all the clean up work we will be doing once you’re back to work. That old coot Gibbon can’t even make it to court on time.”
"I take it things didn’t go your way?” Ron asked as Harry slammed a couple of files on his desk with enough force to send a few loose papers tumbling down to the floor.
“I thought you approved of Draco and Harry’s marriage.” Hermione asked her curiosity overriding her sense of caution.
“Good, in that case I demand that you take me to an obnoxiously expensive dinner to celebrate this monumental win.” Blaise smiled and Draco couldn’t help but smile back and follow his friend out of the Ministry. Once the investigation in to the curse was concluded and exonerated him Harry would have to listen to him, let him explain his side of the story
“And that is why we are here today,” Wheeler stated as he sat across form Draco, all business even though they had work together several times in the past. Draco felt completely alienated from the people he called colleagues. “As you know a healer will administer the strong dose of veritaserum and after a brief interview where we establish that you are fully under the influence of the potion, we will proceed to remove the necessary memories for review with your previous written statement.” Once Draco acknowledged that he understood the process, Wheeler nodded towards the two way mirror and within seconds a middle aged woman whom Draco knew to be a ministry appointed healer walked in to the small room. Draco drank the potion and went through the motions as he was asked mundane questions such as his middle name, where he was born and so on until the auror and healer were satisfied that the potion had taken hold.
“How is that even possible?” Ron asked forgetting Harry’s problem for a moment. The fact that someone could break in to Spinner’s End which had been sealed off and reinforced by the ministry until the estate could be settled in private. Whoever broke into Spinner’s End had to have been an uncommonly powerful witch or wizard.
“Only if you will return the favor and call me Hermione.”
“Honestly Draco must you be so vulgar?”
“Draco, you can’t just sit in this big house and waste away. Getting back to work will be a good thing for you, besides you are a brilliant solicitor and honestly you were just wasting your talents working for the ministry.” Blaise continued. Draco turned to look at his friend for the first time since his school days and wished he had fallen the devilishly handsome wizard in front f him instead of pinning for the impossibility of Harry Potter’s love. Had he taken Blaise up on his offer of love and companionship during their eighth year at Hogwarts, things would have turned out different for him, Goyle would have had to find a different way to enact his revenge.
“Promise?”
“Just a few personal letters that I was going to forward today.” She said leaving the office. She came back shortly with a strong cup of coffee and a stack of letters, he gave her a grateful smile and took a much needed sip of the rich hot liquid. Once he was alone Draco looked through his pile of letters, nothing too interesting. A few invitations to dinners, an angry letter from Pansy and a blank envelope. He put Pansy’s letter aside for later not really in the mood for her hysterics and opened the envelope inside there was a short note written in block letters, just one sentence yet it made Draco shiver with foreboding.
“Harry,” Hermione said quietly as she entered the small guest room, she had intended to say goodnight to her forlorn friend and leave him be. Ron had warned her that meddling at a time like this would be a horrible idea but her resolve quickly evaporated as she saw her friend, gently caressing Aurora’s blonde hair with tears freely streaming down his face. He didn’t seem to notice anything but the sweet little girl who slumbered peacefully on the center of the full sized bed. “Harry.” Hermione said again with a little more force, this time getting his attention. He quickly dried his tears with his free hand and straighten to look at her, what she saw in his eyes nearly brought her to tears on the spot. He was the definition of despair as he sat next to his daughter face contorted in pain.
“Yes.” Harry answered, holding back the trembling of his voice. There was no use in crying anymore, he was in the wrong and he would fix it somehow. He had to because with Draco Harry had found the happiness and family life he had craved since he was a lonely miserable child with the Dursley’s.
“What was the purpose of said curse?” Draco nearly rolled his eyes at the question, everyone knew the purpose of the curse it had been in the papers within seconds of the Unspeakables testing the stone.
“Ron, I judged him the instant one thing went wrong in our relationship. I wouldn’t listen to him and I left our home took our daughter away, kept Teddy from him...” Harry couldn’t finish, he felt a lump in his throat as his grief grew. He had thrown away everything he had ever wanted because he was too hot headed to stop and think. He still on some level had not trusted the man he loved. He needed to go to Draco, talk to him and beg for his forgiveness. “I have to go to him.”
All those memories had been clear with no distortions at all. He had seen himself lust openly over the former Slytherin and face the public about his sexuality and choice of partner. He had been himself when he had faced down the Weasleys' about his intentions to date Draco. He had willingly ended friendships and severed relations to be with Draco. The consuming passion and encompassing love came solely from him not from a spell or potion, not from a curse.
“Ok.” Draco gritted out quietly while staring at the man he loved with cold anger in his eyes. Harry blinked, surprised as if he had been waiting for another fight but quickly composed himself.
“I’m sorry that Auror Potter-Malfoy is not satisfied with the ruling but until the investigations on Solicitor Malfoy has concluded we do not see any real danger to the child by allowing Solicitor Malfoy supervised visitation.” Lord Plukket, the hearings speaker replied rather cooly. They had been hearing arguments back and forth from both parties and had finally come to a decision which left both parents unsatisfied but Draco was at least relieved to know that he would be allow to see his daughter for the time being until the investigation against him concluded and that very same Wizengamot decided on his fate. However, he was heartbroken to know that because Teddy was not his child he could not fight to see him as he did Aurora.
“Don’t you dare laugh, thunder is scary.” he had whispered burying his face in Draco’s neck, tickling Draco with his breath.
That had been his new routine, staring at Draco move on with his life while perfectly ignoring Harry’s existence. Two weeks, it had been two weeks since the argument that finally broke the tenuous string that had held them together. At first Harry had said good riddance, Draco was too high maintenance anyway, it was difficult keeping the moody git happy and Harry was perfectly ok with no longer having to so. That attitude had lasted a whole six hours before he started missing the Slytherin Prince, wanting to have that grey gaze upon him intense and full of promise. He missed meeting in secret alcoves to snog each other silly in between classes, Harry missed sitting in the Astronomy Tower late at night and talking about things that he didn’t dare share even with his best friends. Harry missed sinking his hard cock into Draco’s eager and welcoming heat, having mind blowing sex and then cuddling together in the afterglow. Gods he missed the cuddling, Draco always accused him of being clingy and Harry guessed he had been right.
“It’s already as worse as it can get Blaise, I haven’t seen my daughter in almost six weeks, I’m under investigation by the ministry and I just had an owl deliver divorce papers.” Actually the owl had been what prompted Draco to relieve the last morning of happiness he had had six weeks earlier, the morning Harry had given him the ring and he had helped Aurora prepare for her weekend with her grand-mere. How he missed the little imp with her bright green eyes and silvery blonde curls. Draco could feel tears rolling down his face again and he tried to control himself, how Lucius must be rolling in his grave right at that moment.
“Thank you Blaise, thank you for always being there for me even when I’m a total prick which is more often than I care to admit.” Dark eyes bore into him and Draco looked away at what he saw in them, he couldn’t deal with anything more than he had on his plate at the moment. If only he could rip Harry out of his heart, but he couldn’t. Draco knew that for as long as he lived he would only love Harry James Potter, even as Harry pulverized his heart and rejected his love time and time again.
“No Ron it's not. If you and Hermione separated she would not have to fear that you would violate her trust and take Rose away during visitations. Can you guarantee that Malfoy with all his wealth and properties all over the globe won’t take Rory and run?” Harry demanded nearly vibrating with anger, why couldn’t anyone else see what Malfoy was capable of! Is not like the man had not shown his true colors over and over again. “If he is capable of cursing a person for his own sick thrill then what makes all of you think that Aurora is safe with a person like that?”
“Of course. Tell me, Hermione, are you strictly following court orders or do you believe my son deserves to see his daughter? He is innocent of all charges he’s been accused of as of late.” Narcissa put down her tea cup carefully keeping her eyes on Hermione the entire time. Hermione tried not to squirm under the stare, she was a grown woman and would not be intimidated for Merlin’s sake.
“Harry are you all right!! We’ve called Mungo’s someone form spell damage is on their way here.” Ron screamed in Harry’s ear trying to get his friend’s attention to make sure Harry was going to be ok. Harry began to shake, his bones rattle as the weight of the knowledge the stone had given him sunk on. Images of a younger Draco cursing the stone, chanting the necessary spells, dropping a piece of Harry’s hair on the stone mixed in with his own silvery strands.Draco had cursed him, his Draco, his husband and lover for the past five years of his life had cursed him. Harry doubled over and vomited all over the floor by his desk and felt his body releasing raw magic around him, he heard a few terrified screams as he closed his eyes and concentrated on the treacherous face of the bastard that had lied and made a fool of him for the past five years of his life. After that he remembered nothing of the confrontation that he apparently had in front of half the wizarding world with Draco Malfoy. All he remembered was waking up in St. Mungo’s and the healers explaining the kind of curse he had been under and the effects that he would feel from using magic while his magical core had been so unstable.
“Ok you’ll take me to your parents? or Ok we are through?”
“What are you talking about?” Draco said not really paying much attention as he poured himself a steaming mug of tea, he knew he shouldn't have listen to Blaise. Now he was suffering from a hangover and feeling completely ridiculous for having imbibed so much the night before, even if it was a celebratory dinner. He could practically hear Lucius’s disapproving tone, ‘Malfoy’s do not become intoxicated in public’
“I had a feeling you would be home. Are you busy tonight? Never mind of course you are not busy.” He said, not waiting for an answer. “Care to join Pansy and I for a fancy dinner on you?” Draco rolled his eyes in the same manner Aurora had earlier that day and was about to decline when he realized he truly had nothing better to do than wallow in self pity and get vulgarly drunk. If one must drink it should never be alone.
“I never saw the stone again after I cursed it, not until it was send to Harry nearly two months ago.”
"I want you to fuck me..." Draco finished in a strangled cry as Harry ripped his shirt open and seared his skin along with white hot kisses as both their needs mingled and became a frenzied fight of wills. Harry latched on to one pale nipple and the moan that his suckling pulled from Draco went straight to his already painfully hard cock. He pulled the blond up against the nearest wall and captures his lips in a demanding kiss as he rutted against him, rubbing their erections together through their trousers, the feeling so exquisite he had to pause for a moment or he would have come right then.
“Let’s just drop it, we have a new case.” Harry said pointing at the files he had unceremoniously dropped on their joined desks. “There was a break in at Spinner’s End. Robards wants us to go check it out.”
After about five seconds of nearly hyperventilating and firmly putting his wand away Harry swung the classroom door opened and was surprised to find Draco sitting at a desk carefully placing parchment and quill in front of him.
“She had. I guess Draco must have convinced her somehow. Merlin, Ron I fucked everything up so badly.” Harry said voicing the obvious. Ron looked at him with pity and left the living room, coming back shortly with a couple of glasses of firewhiskey and handed Harry one of the tumblers.
“Fuck, oh Salazar Harry…” Draco screamed in ecstasy as Harry’s tongue plunged into his body over and over fucking him mercilessly, loosening the muscle with need.
“Mr. Malfoy?” A short stubby mediwitch dressed in green robes crouched down in front of Draco, looking up at the stunned Draco with big friendly brown eyes, pity clearly depicted in them. “Mr. Malfoy, is there someone I can call for you?”
Draco looked at him, mirroring Harry’s anger as he curved his lips into an unattractive sneer. “As thrilling as this show of masculine possessiveness is. I’m quite sure that you no longer have a claim on me.”
“As a matter of fact, I am.” Draco lied, quite badly and unable to convince either of them, proof that Harry’s proximity was affecting the Slytherin.
“Yes well that’s the other reason why I’m here, the custody hearing is tomorrow and...”
“When was the curse enacted?” As he asked the question Auror Wheeler’s demeanor changed slightly, he became more serious, showing the tough, smart Auror he truly was. Draco paused for a second and looked at the man closely, finding it remarkable how closely the man resembled Harry. The eyes were wrong of course and he was missing the glasses, but at that moment it seemed to Draco that it was Harry sitting across from him. That alone compelled him to answer truthfully and in earnest, he wanted Harry to know the truth.
Harry took Draco into his mouth as deep as he could and Draco's hands covered his face as he moaned with pleasure. Harry stopped to rip the rest of Draco's clothes off of him and then pulled the nearly incoherent boy gently to lean over one of the desks. Harry meant to take him savagely when he first set out to find him but looking at Draco's beautiful pale skin positively glowing in the candlelight made him pause, he really did love this boy his feelings overshadowed his earlier anger as he thought. Everything about him is perfect... everything.
“That was more difficult than I had anticipated.” Narcissa patted him on the back and walked out of the receiving room claiming a headache. He was grateful to be alone. He needed time to think things through, to plan for a future without Harry and only partial custody of a child he had in his life for over four years. The visit had been wonderful. To see her, to hold her had been better than he had imagined. Yet now she was gone and he felt empty and hollow. Draco made his way to his father’s library and poured himself a drink, something he had been doing entirely too often as of late and settled down to do some pressing paperwork, anything to distract himself from the shit storm that had become his life. A few hours later he was snapped out of staring blankly at parchment by Blaise’s floating green head in the fireplace.
Draco felt a prick on his arm bring him back from the worst moment of his life. Maybe it had all been a dream and he wasn’t at the hospital clutching Harry’s belongings, waiting for Harry’s friends to collect his lifeless body. Harry hadn’t volunteered to run drills through the forbidden forest that night in that horrible storm, he had not been attacked by a crazed werewolf who mistook him for a threat and ripped out his throat before anyone even knew what was happening. Harry had not bled to death as he waited for healers to descend on him.
“Maybe so, but can you explain this photograph? Draco what if Harry sees this?” Narcissa said her tone concerned as she slipped her slim hand into Draco’s larger one.
“It’s cruel Draco, you can’t keep doing this to yourself.”
“What is that supposed to mean? And stop moaning at the table you’re disgusting.” She shrieked in mock indignation.
“In that case M’Lords, Auror Potter requests that the supervision be done by someone of his choosing.”
Harry watched as Theo leaned in to Draco and whispered something in the blonde’s ear, his lips nearly touching Draco’s earlobe as his hand touched Draco’s shoulder and rubbed slow lazy circles. Harry noted the pretty blush that crept up Draco’s neck at whatever the dark haired wizard had said, Draco nodded his head and smiled seductively at Theo. Harry’s cup filled with pumpkin juice shattered in his hand drawing the attention of those sitting close to him.
“Just answer me one question Hermione, why? Why did he do this?” He said voice raspy from crying and disuse, the first two weeks he had locked himself in the tiny room and refused to see anyone. Not even little Aurora who had been sent to spend that time with Molly and Arthur, shielded from the reality of what was happening to her parents.
Harry grew impatient but was also amused at seeing Draco grasping for control and being unable to regain it.
“Too many dangerous artifacts and potions, they would just blow the place to high heaven.” Harry told him picking through a pile of parchment in front of the over turned desk. They were mostly notes on teaching plans, seeing his old professor’s handwriting and lesson plans brought back so many bittersweet memories. “It’s going to be you and me mate, this is going to take an eternity.”
“It seems like you had a very good time last night,” She said lips pursed, her disapproval quite clear. “Although this is not the behavior of a parent trying to regain custody of his children.”
There would be no ignoring him this time. Harry steeled his expression in a way even he didn't recognize. The weeks of having been overlooked and sneered upon had taken their toll, and his anger mixed with his desire in a way that made him determined to get what he wanted. He walked over to Draco with that purposeful power in his eyes, feeling a foot taller than he was and infinitely more powerful. His steps were even and measured and his gaze never left the face of the boy before him. Draco faltered under Harry's intensity and for a moment didn't know how to react. Harry moved forward as a flush crept up Draco's beautiful neck. Draco tried to look down at his schoolwork again but Harry was already there, a gentle but firm hand under his delicate chin.
“Harry be reasonable; I need time to tell my parents not just that I’m not going to marry Astoria, my girlfriend for the past two years but that I’m also in a committed relationship with none other than The Boy Who Lived.” Draco had said rolling his eyes as he donned on the royal blue dress robes had bought for the party his parents were holding in both his and Astoria’s honor.
“My point is that you have no sex life Draco, you’re young, successful, and sexy as hell now that you don’t glue your hair to you’re scalp. Oh and don’t forget fabulously rich, there are so many wizards and witches just dying for their shot at you.” Draco rolled his eyes at her again, if all the hate mail and howlers he had received since the Prophet’s piece on how he cursed the Boy Who Lived where anything to go by those shots she spoke of would most likely be fatal.
“What are you doing here, Potter?” Draco sneered quickly recovering from his shock. Hearing the harsh words coming from Draco’s lips hurt like hell, so he was Potter once again.
After Aurora’s visit to Draco’s the little girl had returned weeping and begging to see her Papa again. Once Harry had managed to calm her down Aurora had remained withdrawn, she had refused dinner and asked to be excused. With a broken heart Harry had help her get ready for bed and tried to engage her in picking a bedtime story, but Aurora had just cried asking why she couldn’t go back to her own room and that it was Papa’s turn to read her a story. Harry had hugged her until she fell into a fitful sleep on the bed they had been sharing in Hermione and Ron’s small guest room. He had to do something, his little girl was suffering because of his rash actions and he had to fix it somehow.
Harry slumped on top of the blonde nearly crushing him as they both laid perfectly still unable to move as they tried to catch their breath, panting and exhausted with the after shock of their orgasms still lingering. Once he was able to move again Harry kissed Draco’s neck lovingly where his teeth had left small bruises, but no mark. He wanted to mark Draco when they were both conscious of their actions and not seduced by the pleasures of their bodies or the allure of Draco’s Veela seeking out its mate.
“But nothing! Take me with you and tell everyone the truth or we’re finished. I won’t be your dirty little secret just because you are ashamed of who you are.” Draco hadn’t seen the angry and unreasonable side of Harry since their Hogwarts day. Since the war Harry had always been the peace keeper in their Auror class, he never raised his voice or said anything cutting. He had been calm and collected, sure of himself and comfortable in his own skin. Draco fidgeted with the engagement ring the diamonds catching the light and mocking them both in it’s brilliance. It wasn’t just the engagement that bothered Harry, it was their difference in social classes. Just another barrier between them as Harry saw it but it was just ridiculous to Draco, Harry was beneath no one he was a war hero for Merlin’s sake.
Harry pushed Malfoy's face away from him and his anger intensified but so did his desire.
“Oh Solicitor Malfoy! It’s great to see you, how are you?” Madge Ridgebit his young and bubbly blonde assistant said bouncing off her chair and following him excitedly to his office, Madge was in a constant state of excitement. “I didn’t think I would see you in this week.”
Draco looked surprised his grey eyes widening slightly before he schooled his features back in to that damn Malfoy mask, Harry thought he was done with that look. It had taken him nearly six months after they had started having clandestine meetings to thaw the ice Malfoy mask. As soon as he entered the room and locked the door behind himself Harry felt it once again. Draco’s magic humming around him calling to Harry, making his blood boil with need.
He had been hysterically harassing the mediwitch staff and warranting the attention of a big burly ward guard whom had given him a dirty look and a stern warning. The eternally chilled hospital air gave him gooseflesh and he hugged his arms tightly around his body trying in vain to find comfort within himself. The effort squeezed some of the moisture from his expensive designer robes. It’s probably ruined now he thought disinterestedly. His hair felt cold and sticky and he could still hear the rumbling thunder in the distance, the storm raging, furious, and uncontrollable. Harry hated thunder. He would shriek like a small child and curl into bed with Draco giving him a warning look.
“Ugh. I hate my life. At least we only have to account for the dark artifacts, then we turn this mess over to the solicitors involved in the estate.”
At the end of the note there was a skeleton key attached with a mild sticky charm. He was a complete arsehole and he only hoped it wasn’t too late to fix things with Draco.
“My life, the one part of my life when I have had true happiness has been noting but a lie. I knew he hated me when we were young but to...It’s just so cruel even for him.” Harry finished trying to muffle a sob so as not to wake his daughter, his beautiful daughter born form a curse. Harry would never forgive Draco for as long as he lived. The only reason he had not killed the evil bastard when the curse was lift was because of Aurora.
“You are mine, and I’m not keen on sharing Draco.” Harry said firmly trying to hold a grip on the white hot jealous rage that engulfed him anytime he imagined Draco with anyone other than him.
“I am not ashamed.”
"No. Solicitor Malfoy gave unrestrained access to all of his memories regarding your relationship. While he had been surprised at your initial perusal of him he had been genuinely pleased and accepted of his own free will." Wheeler stated looking through his notes to make sure. Harry had seen both his and Draco's early memories of their whirlwind romance. Draco's memories had been clear and uncorrupted while Harry's had been tinged with red around the edges, a clear sign of a love spell.
“Shut up and kiss me.” Those had been his words earlier that night when they had been reluctant to leave what had now become their bed. The other bed remained neatly made and lonely looking across the room. It hadn’t been slept in since the beginning of Auror training. Harry will never sleep in it again. His mind cruelly supplied the memory. Draco’s bright grey eyes clouded with fresh tears at the thought. Life was painfully cruel and tonight Draco discovered unreasonably short.
“Congratulations on your engagement. I wish you a happy life with Astoria.” With that he grabbed his wand from the clutter dresser and walked out of the room closing the door with a definitive click behind him.
“Oh Harry,” Hermione walked closer to the bed but stopped when he raised his hand palm out. He had been avoiding the world for the past six weeks and it killed her that he wouldn’t even confide in her or Ron, he was so alone while all his friends tried to rally around him and protect him from his pain as he had once done for all of them.
“I wasn’t.” Draco lied
“Just leave it alone Pans, here try the creme brûlée.” Blaise said surprising her as he shoved his spoon in her mouth, they all knew he would pay for it later but Draco was grateful, he smiled at Blaise and mouthed a thank you.
"That's its baby, tell me what you want" Harry demanded as he buried his face in the crook of Draco's neck, Draco's scent enfolded him drenching his senses with everything he had been deprived of. Harry bit down gently on the pale flesh barely restraining his impulse to mark the veela to claim Draco right then and there. Not until Draco voiced his consent, until he could no longer deny he needed Harry as much as Harry needed him.
“You don’t have to thank me Mrs. Malfoy, I’m just following court orders.” Hermione answered grabbing her own cup and taking a sip of her tea, it was exquisite after all, nothing but the best would do for the Malfoys. Certain things never changed.
“It’s not the same thing Ron and you know it!”
So sorry this is taking so long, I am buried under school work. In fact i'm supposed to be doing homework but the story took over. next chapter already finished just need to edit!!
“I’m referring to this!” Narcissa exclaimed as she slammed a news paper he had not noticed she had been holding on the plain oak table, her blue eyes accusing. He walked towards her and pick up the paper, right on the front page was a photo of him draped indecently over Blaise and leaning in as if to kiss the dark wizard as they were leaving the restaurant
Draco and Harry had started dating when Teddy was nearly five years old and the little boy had been a staple in Draco’s life ever since. He had grown to love impish child as if he were Teddy’s father as well, not being able to see him was another harsh blow dealt by Harry. Draco looked back towards Harry’s table, silently watching as Harry’s lawyer leaned down and whispered something to him. Harry nodded stiffly and pinched the bridge of his nose, something Draco knew he did when highly agitated.
“That’s right little one, I had to go away for a while but I’m back and I am going to spend as much time as I can with both you and Teddy” Draco promised as he pressed a kiss to the top of Aurora’s head. They stayed in that position for a few quiet minutes just enjoying being in each other’s company once again. Then in the usual four-year-old fashion Aurora jumped out of Draco’s arms and started running circles around him and begging him to do the fun bubble charm with his wand.
"The spell wasn't Draco either was it?"
“I do not know.” Wheeler knitted his brows and the corners of his full lips turned down slightly in a confused frown.
“What about dinner, Harry you barely touched anything.” She asked concerned, unlike Ron she had noticed his moody withdrawal for the past fortnight and had been watching him nearly as closely as he had been watching Draco.
"Auror Potter are you alright?" Healer Lovell asked as she checked his vitals. The woman looked at him with obvious pity. He had destroyed the man who had loved him unconditionally for the better part of his life. No, he was not all right and he hated himself for being a self righteous bastard and lashing out at Draco without hearing the truth he had been trying to tell Harry so desperately.
“Merlin’s bear! Harry what the hell? You just apparated right through the wards!” Ron snapped, holding his chest trying to calm down his heart. When he saw Harry’s face he quickly walked to his friend and put a hand on his shoulder. “What’s happened?”
“No. Please do not lie. You Gryffindors are terrible at it. None of you can shake the image of his youthful self and indiscretions. I just wished all of you to consider the fact that as a child he didn’t have a chance to develop his own personality. Lucius was a harsh man who ruled with an iron fist and until his death neither Draco nor I had the freedom to just be ourselves and not the versions we had developed to please him.” Narcissa let go of Hermione’s hand and turned back to watch her son and granddaughter, having apparently had her say. The conversation left Hermione feeling lost and uncomfortable yet she had to admit that to some extent Narcissa had been right.
“My opinion is of no consequence,” She said staring at the older woman just as intensely.
Harry carefully caressed the slight muscles of Draco's exposed back and placed gentle kisses along the curves of his spine. Draco shuddered as Harry slowly kissed him lower and lower, eventually spreading Draco's perfectly tight round ass and looking longingly at the puckered pink ring. Harry licked and kissed and made love to Draco's ass with his tongue, lips, and mouth savoring every moment and every moan that escaped Draco's mouth until he couldn't take it anymore.
“I wont, Salazar knows I want to but I wont. There is still Aurora.” Draco said with a heavy sigh and walked towards the enormous library windows, he looked out into the darkened back gardens and could almost hear his little girl laughing and running out there being chased by her daddy.
She couldn’t remember the last time any of them had spend time with Draco without Harry or Aurora, how they all, herself included had thought him guilty during the first days of discovering the curse. Draco had not done anything too untoward since they had left Hogwarts, besides being his usually mildly irritating sarcastic self. He had become a solicitor and joined the Ministry as a prosecutor, married and bonded to Harry and led a very normal routine as a husband and father yet she could not honestly say that she fully trusted the blonde ex-Slytherin Prince even though all traces of the boy he had been were seemingly gone.
“I just don’t know why he did it? What was the point?” Harry said to Hermione breaking free of the haunting memories.
“Then prove it. Take me with you to the party.” Draco sighed and pushed his bright blond hair behind his ear, a habit he had developed as a young kid whenever he was annoyed. He was also getting exasperated with the whole conversation. They had it more times than he was willing to and it irritated him to no end.
Draco walked through the dark halls of Malfoy Manor and a chill ran up his spine as he got an eerie sense of deja vu. He hated the damn place and had begged his mother a dozen times since he graduated from law school to sell the mansion, it bore more bad memories than it was worth. Bust she had refused, always stating that it was their ancestral home and while Draco was not interested in living there his children might feel differently. He walked down the back stairs to the kitchen too used to the domestic life he shared with Harry, Aurora and Teddy to actually use the services of the house elves. If he was honest Hermione’s constant badgering through the years actually made him feel guilt whenever he crossed paths with one of the many Malfoy Elves.
“All memories from creation of the cursed stone to the morning of the break from the curse.” Wheeler informed Draco calmly, as polite as he had been from the moment Draco entered the interrogation room. “Be assured that the only memories we will be reviewing will be the ones directed to Auror Potter and your relationship with him, anything relating to your work will be blocked for obvious reasons.” The man was clever and good at what he did, he also seemed fair and Draco was glad that he was the one handling the case he knew enough of Wheeler to know the Auror would remain unbiased during his investigation. Draco nodded and shook the Auror’s outstretched hand. “As always it was a pleasure and I will be seeing you real soon. Take care Mr. Malfoy.”
He could almost picture the blonde rushing about the bedroom, because he had overslept or because instead of getting ready he had pulled Harry into bed with him and performed every wicked act his dirty mind could come up with. Harry sobbed, crushed under everything he had lost by his own doing. He had to speak to Draco, to try and put the pieces of their lives back together but he was too ashamed to face his ex husband. Another loud sob escaped his lips at the realization that Draco no longer belonged to him, that he had tossed him out of his life and tried to take their daughter from him. How could he ever ask Draco to forgive him when he had done the unforgivable, had the tables been turn Harry had no idea how he would survive without his daughter? Without Teddy? Harry cried himself to sleep in the bed he once shared with the man he still loved, he would fix things between them, he had to for Aurora’s sake but also for his own. Without Draco he hadn’t been living, just coasting through the days trying to convince himself he would be all right again, when all he wanted was to have his family together again. The family he had single handedly destroyed by jumping to conclusion and believing Draco to be false, gods how that had hurt, it had sliced through his heart mercilessly. The idea that it all been a lie, that Draco didn’t truly love him that it just been some twisted sick trick, a curse. He had to fix everything, put the broken pieces of his life back together he just had no idea how to begin or if the jagged edges that were left would fit back into their proper place.
"Do not use that on me. If this is what you want it's exactly what you'll get. Take off your robes."
Across the garden form the gazebo Narcissa and Hermione sipped their tea and watched Draco blowing bubbles for the little girl as she ran around popping them.
“Your mother called me, she’s scared that you might try to harm yourself.” Blaise said with rare honesty, sitting on one of the plush library chairs by the roaring fire in the room. Of course his mother had called reinforcements, lately all she did was lay eyes on him and burst into tears herself. He couldn’t blame her, like him she had lost a great deal and was afraid of losing the only thing she had left.
“The entire world thinks I’ve cursed Harry Potter, Pansy. The only thing they want from me is my head on a platter.”
“Well you still have your license and and you know the doors are always opened for you at Malfoy, MacDougal and Burke. It still belongs to your family.” Draco knew he sounded bitter, but the truth of the matter was that he was bitter and angry and falling apart. He lost the love of his life, his beautiful daughter and a job he had worked so hard to earned with the ministry prosecution. Blaise was right he needed to do something to distract himself.
“Isn’t it though, mate?” Harry took a deep breath to calm down and hold back the tears that threaten to spill at any moment. How he wished his life was different, boring, uneventful and uncomplicated. However, he knew that wishing and what if’s were nothing but a waste of time. He knew that keeping Aurora from Draco wasn’t fair to either his daughter or the man he had loved so passionately for five years but he was in no mood to be fair. He was hurt and confused and the bottom line was that he did not trust Draco. How could he after everything that had happened. Draco had lied to him, manipulated his feelings, he had cursed him for Merlin’s sake and yet everyone expected Harry to be reasonable, how?
“Always, you know I will always be there for you.”
“I don’t know Harry, I’m baffled by what is happening. I truly believed he loved you.” Hermione said holding back her own tears, it was true. She had seen them together and believed that for Draco the sun risen and set with Harry, then to find out that their lives together had been nothing more than a cruel trick, a curse it just didn’t make any sense.
“That’s what we have to find out.”
“You know Rita Seeker prints nothing but rubbish, just focus on what you want to do next. No matter what don’t make it worse.”
“Alright, Ron.” Harry chuckled and ripped the brown paper to find a blood red stone encased in a glass box. Harry looked at it confused, he had no idea what he was looking at. He opened the glass and the moment he touched the stone it began to glow and burn his hand. Harry could feel a surge of dark magic coursed through his body, blood rushed to his head making his ears ring painfully and spread to his body. Harry lead out a hoarse cry and doubled over as his body boiled from the inside out, for a moment he thought he would die from the blinding pain. Then it was gone as quickly as it had started and it left behind the worse emotional that Harry had ever felt in his life.
“I am thinking of her, making sure she is as far away from his influence as possible. She’s still very young she will forget. Good night Hermione I’m very tired.” Harry dismissed his best friend laying down next to his little girl and closing his eyes. He heard Hermione sobbing quietly as she closed the door on her way out. He knew he was doing the right thing and he would not let anyone convince him otherwise. It didn’t matter why Malfoy had cursed him, ruined all the plans Harry had once had for his future. What mattered now was that Harry had finally opened his eyes and was ready to break free from his past, ready to truly start his life and find real happiness, find someone that truly loved him. No curses, spells or magic, real tangible freewill type of love.
Draco just stared, not sure what to do. Throughout their relationship there had never been a time when he wasn't in total control. Since the first kiss, his Veela had manipulated the Gryffindor. Maneuvered and lured the shorter boy into doing exactly what Draco wanted without any resistance from Harry. However, tonight was different. He needed to claim Draco and the only way he would do that was to show the Veela that he was just as powerful and commanding as the blonde.
“‘I hope you will always know the meaning of true love.’” Harry read the note out loud a small smile forming on his face, it wasn’t signed but Harry recognized the elegant handwriting and knew right away that it was from his husband. Ron made a gagging sound good naturelly and leaned forward a little closer to Harry’s desk curios about the small parcel.
“Are you angry with me Papa?” Her big green eyes looked vulnerable as she stared up at him determined to know the truth no matter what that would be. A future Gryffindor, perhaps, she was brash and brave already. Her words hurt him beyond belief and he crushed the little girl in a too-tight hug, to reassure them both that was all as it should be.
"I want it... please... Harry... I want you."
“Why is it that I am always picking up the check for you and Pansy?”
“OK we are through.” Draco told him stonily. Inside he felt a cold creeping around his heart and his mind panicky, told him to take those words back but he couldn’t. Anger overrode sanity at the moment in a way it never had before. Harry’s face crumpled and he moved away from Draco shakily, taking a few shuddering breaths he moved to the closet grabbing his coat and a pair of rain boots, the silver scarf around the coat’s shoulders.
“I saw Draco’s memories. He didn’t curse me.” Harry said simply sitting down on the worn old couch in the small living room. Ron sat down across from him. “Ron, he didn’t curse me. Bloody hell, the things I said to him. I hurt him with my magic.” Harry cried the first tears finally breaking free as his own memories assailed him. Draco had rushed in to his room at St. Mungo’s, worry clear in his grey eyes. The moment Harry had seen the blonde his emotions had gotten the best of him. He had screamed at him to get out and when Draco had refused, Harry’s uncontrollable magic had physically lashed out at the blonde cutting him in the face and slamming his body to the opposite side of the room. After that he lost consciousness.
Draco Malfoy sat in the Great Hall between Blaise Zabini and Theodore Nott, laughing between taking delicate bite of his dinner. His perfectly groomed platinum hair glowed underneath candle lit ceiling as he flung his head back and laughed at something Nott had said. Apparently everything Nott said for the past twenty minutes was comedic gold and had Draco constantly in stitches. Then there was the comedian himself who looked at the blonde with such hunger that even a first year could decipher what the dark haired wizard had going through his filthy mind. Harry clenched his fists tightly barely holding back the need to walk over to the Slytherin table and pound Theo’s face into a bloody pulp.
“Harry, Harry are you listening to me?” Hermione asked waving her hand in his face distracting him from the torture chamber his mind had created for him the past two weeks. “Honestly you two, how on earth do you plan to pass Potions when neither of you can pay attention for longer than three minutes.” She huffed in frustration and both he and Ron bowed their heads in shame, she was just trying to help them. Harry vowed that he would focus on Hermione and only Hermione for the duration of dinner, he was doing great too until he heard that sexy low chuckle once again and did what was now an automatic action, turned to stare at Draco.
Recently single Draco Malfoy back to his wild ways?
“Same to you sir.” Draco said as the Auror left the small room and the Healer began the slow painstakingly delicate process of removing so many memories at once. Ten years of his life, and five years of extremely private memories of times spend with his husband in the most intimate of situations, the thought of all the people that would be privy to his sex life with Harry made hi sick. Once she was done the Healer looked at him sympathetically as he drank the antidote for the veritaserum and refused the pain potion for the pounding headache that was left behind by her probing and the night of drinking. After he was assured that only the Aurors in the case would be reviewing his life, Draco made his way to his cramped office on the second level located in the Winzengamot Administrative Services. He was surprised to see his young assistant behind her desk hard at work.
“I have no clue, I just hope I’m not too late.” Harry stated in a pained whisper as he remembered the Prophet article that Ron and Hermione had so valiantly tried to hide from him, when he first Draco nearly kissing Braise in slow motion he had felt anger burning through him. In his mind it had been proof that Draco’s love had been a lie, now he just hoped for Draco’s forgiveness and that Blaise had not taken permanent residence in Draco’s heart the past few months.
“I think we have enough of what we need for the investigation, please sign and date your written statement.” He then turned to the meek looking Healer and signaled her. “Thank very much for your cooperation Mr. Malfoy, Healer Lovell will be removing the memories that pertain to this case only.” It all sounded great in the surface but Draco’s legal Slytherin mind demanded to know more.
“Whatever gave you that idea?” Harry snapped, sitting down behind his desk and trying to reel in his anger. Nothing seemed to be going his way. First his lawyer informed him that it would be impossible to have a quick divorce without having to cross paths with his soon to be ex husband and now Draco got supervised visitations with Aurora when all Harry wanted was to break free from the man and start his life fresh, because picking up the pieces of his heart was decidedly harder with the man who had used him so dastardly a constant presence in his life. “The Wizengamot allowed Draco supervised visitations twice a week.”
“You were happy Harry, you have everything you ever wanted. A loving spouse, a beautiful daughter. Just talk to him, you know he tried to see you numerous times these last few weeks. Hear him out.” Hermione begged. It was not that she was siding with the blonde as Ron kept accusing her off, it was that she had seen them together, she had seen their love for each other for their daughter it couldn’t all have been because of a curse. Harry’s eyes harden at her suggestion and she knew he wouldn’t listen, he was too hurt and way too stubborned she just hopped that it wouldn’t be too late for him when he came to his senses.
Draco pulled his head out the pensive, tears running down his face. It was his favorite form of torture, to relive the memories of the one time in his life when he had been truly happy.
