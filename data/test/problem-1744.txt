Harry shook his head. “Not like you,” He stood as Draco fused over him, pulling his shirt out, and unbuttoning it. Draco ran his fingers through Harry’s hair and Harry patted it down.
“They do look quite fetching on you darling,” Narcissa added her support, before calling to the house elf.
Harry shrugged. “Pretty much.” He just wanted to take Draco back to their room and take nap. Instead he resigned himself to whatever they wanted to know. He slumped back next to Draco.
They were talented and powerful, but more so, they were creative. She could see many schools of thought and skills meshed together. She could only surmise it was an acumination of Dark Lord’s inner circle vs the Order of Phoenix’s teachings with a little of Dumbledore sprinkled on top.
Harry sighed, unable to remember a time when his wants had ever mattered and opened the door before he could change his mind. Thankfully Healer Murphy was already seated, and it looked like they were the last ones to show.
The bracelets led them through the building and down some stairs into a room in the middle of nowhere that Harry could tell. It had taken longer than he’d thought as the circle seemed ready to go when they walked in. Thankfully there was already an older lady sitting among them. That girl, Mandy, was sitting with the 4 girls and 2 boys, the others Harry hadn’t seen before. There were two chairs set away from the others and Harry dropped into one, Malfoy next to him.
The woman paused and stammered. “Well, she’d be excited if I could tell her, which I can’t of course.”
do this without you. I’ll defend you. I’ll fight for us and when I fight, I fucking win. I just need to know that you want me too.”
Draco crept closer, careful to be soundless. It took a few moments, but Draco moved close enough to peer through some shelves. It was only his mother and father and normally Draco would’ve announced himself, but something about this scene kept him quiet.
Harry scoffed, “Ginny, Draco, her name is Ginny. We’re friends and that’s it. If I had felt about her even half of what I feel for you, I’d never been able to let her go. We broke up and I wasn’t even really upset.”
Tawy tossed the empty vial to Helen as she caught Draco and eased him onto the bed, “there we are young one. Looks like it’s been a far while since you’ve had a good sleep.” She lifted his feet and deftly removed his shoes before throwing the soft blanket over him.  “Alright let’s get started, he’s going to be groggy when he gets up. I want to give him as much time as we can before we take him back. Call in Vos and Sentez the more the merrier, tell them we’re doing a full workup.”
“Yes.” Ron shook her hand, already feeling better. If this woman was on their side maybe Hermione had a chance. Her and her army, he took note of the group behind her, the best dressed army he’d ever seen.
“Now that we’re all here, let’s get started.” Murphy glanced around the group, “anyone have anything they want to start with?”
He clicked the picture bigger and realized he did something wrong when Draco paled and Harry gasped. Harry stood, “why?” Draco took his arm and Harry grabbed his hand. Teddy was thankful they got a chance to see it over a pc screen rather than in life if this was their reaction. The statue was considered a symbol of the whole war. Robed figures, faceless due to their hoods, stood around the figures of Harry and Draco. Harry was kneeling, while Draco stood in front of him, wand pointed towards Harry, dangerous until you realized it was the handle of the wand and not the tip. The only colors on the whole of the white marble were the Gryffindor crest on Harry’s chest and the Slytherin crest on Draco’s.
They walked from castle together, “not so fast,” Neville admonished, “we want them to see us coming.”
George tilted his head towards her with a nod. “Yeah. I can see Harry getting his chance and diving on it. If so, good on him.” Merlin he hoped he wasn’t anywhere around when Ginny caught wind. They may have broken up, but George was under no disillusions that Ginny had given up.
“Surely she’d give it to them,” Ella announced slyly smiling, flouncing her hair, and looking them over.
“Any preferences for lunch? Somewhere close so we’re sure to make it back in time.” Hermione asked as they started towards the door.
Harry nodded, crawling so he was in front of Draco. “I know, I know you are. You’ve changed so much, or maybe not changed but let me see under the ice and Merlin I find you incredible.”
She quickly raised her wand and sent out fireworks with plenty of noise. “Enough!” She called out with a friendly yell.
“I’d like to thank the court for seeing me and for considering my plea. Rather than hocus pocus around the topic allow me to come to the point. In the last 10 years, I have petitioned the Ministry’s division of Child Well-Care 12 times to remove my nephew, Draco Malfoy, from his home and to place him into my care. Each time I was refused, without investigation, because some wizards care more for gallons than they do for children’s welfare.”
After Molly pin-pointed her first contention, she asked Ron and Hermione to step into the hallway, promising to re-call them so they could say goodbye to Harry. They did as she asked but it was a near thing and she could see their unhappiness about it. However, she felt they didn’t need to be included on such a matter they could do nothing about.
Harry listened to the buzz of the reporters. The American one specially seemed excited. Titles of any kind seemed to bring it out in them.
Charlie wanted to argue. Ron certainly didn’t look fine. He hadn’t interacted with them all morning. He’d kept his chair turned from them and towards the window, overlooking the nothing in the backyard, but mom had barked him to leave Ron be, so he did, but he didn’t like it. “Harry and that Malfoy kid will be here soon.”
Mandy hefted her bag higher on her shoulder. “I bet my sister is already here. She gets here pretty early.”
Malfoy chuckled as he took the seat across from him. “You can’t escape it Potter. You’ll have to take it 8
After the first time, the owner of the room hadn’t tried to talk to them, he barely looked at them as they left. Draco could tell people were looking at them and maybe talking about them. None of them actually tried to talk to them, which was the way he liked it. They made it back to their room, without having to speak to anyone.
George looked around the group and nabbed Neville’s arm, pulling Neville away as he called out, “just a moment.” He took them a few feet away and with a flick of his wand raised a privacy shield, hoping none of the group knew Harry’s little trick. “Look, you need to only bring in the people you trust. I know Ron and Hermione met with this group before they left out, but this is going to get hairy…
Lucius studied him for a moment. “They suit you.” He nodded, approvingly, “yes, very nice. Perhaps I should retain myself some.”
Tawy didn’t give him the time to consider going back to comfort her as his sleeve was taken and she apparated them.
An undertone of sound spread throughout the area, which quickly fell off again when the solicitor returned, holding the door open behind himself as Andromeda Tonks entered the room.
“That’s not an answer,” Frustration bled into his tone, Harry had about enough of adults keeping things about him from him.
Lucius nodded. He had known what they were, he did work with muggle’s who were worth his business time, but wanted to hear this from Draco. They both knew what he was really asking, “those are muggle, are they not?”
“After any type of school break, Headmaster Dumbledore always had the kitchen elves add one of my general healing potions to young Draco and Harry’s drinks. Sometimes for as long as a week afterwards.”
Neville didn’t think he’d even seen Draco grin like that, carefree and young. He thought he might now see why Harry was so taken with him. Then he chuckled as Hermione let Harry go and threw herself into hugging Draco, who seemed pleased but unsure how to act, rather like an owl getting its feather’s ruffled. Neville grinned at Harry.
“They mentioned going to back to Hogwarts in group,” Murphy pressed. He glanced around room and leaned forward, his voice low, “Is that happening?”
He immediately paused, “yes, Healer.” She raised the shield. He put the green marker down and folded his hands over the sheet. “Should I move back to the couch?”
Hermione scanned the grounds for what Neville had called them over for. There, at the largest statue, a boy stood with his trunk.  Her eyes whipped to the movement of someone coming around the statue. There they were, unmistakable it was Harry and Draco, circling the statue. Draco pointed and shook his head, while Harry’s body language screamed disgust. Harry kicked the statue with the side of his foot for good measure.
“The manor is under watch. If there was a portkey or dark arts, they would have been alerted.” Pansy reminded her, even if she wasn’t too sure about it herself. “I’ll leave it for Draco to decide and if he decides he doesn’t want it then I’ll hand it off to someone else and it’ll go back to the manor.”
At first Ron had been terrified. Hermione arrested in a foreign country so far from home and any help. Then the platitudes from the Ministry had arrived, they were sending help, it was all a big misunderstanding and then he had laughed for Hermione’s sake. Trying to downplay this and trying to get her to laugh with him during his visits. He hoped she wasn’t as worried as he was, and he was worried. He spent hours walking their hotel room for two, now one.
“Me too,” Hermione answered. Ron’s mouth was too full for his reply to be really made out, but the other two gathered it was an agreement of the same.
“Where will we go?” Draco asked, “my mother is under house arrest and my father is in Azkaban and your place is surrounded by the press.”
Draco inhaled and after a moment exhaled, smoke wafting around them. Draco leaned back. “Insane every one of them and we deserve everything we get.”
Tawy nearly swallowed her tongue and heard gasps of awe when Draco flew unaided. She thought the match nearly won when Draco launched an attack mid-flight, his expelliarmus disarming Harry. Draco caught Harry’s wand, though Harry’s wandless casting of the same spell had Draco’s wand shooting into his palm. Switching wands did not stem nor constrict the battle as neither boy seemed to be handicapped using the other’s wand. Tawy made note of this significant fact.
“So, while I was getting the drinks, I realized something. You’re going to marry me.” Harry announced to Draco with a grin.
“It was a mistake. He’s allowed those. He’s mine. I’ve had enough of losing people and I will not let you.” Harry growled, fine lines of magic, rippled from his hand and down his wand, red, crackling, and furious. The magic filling the room now toxic with rage.
Draco set the soda down and smoothly took the paper from Harry’s slack hand. He read it over quickly. He thought momentarily before pushing the paper onto Harry, “read it.”
“And if they tell us to shove off about everything. I’ve wasted good shit and got nothing.” She glared at Rey.
The owner of the room jumped up, a few others sitting on bed, looking expectant. “So hey Malfoy and Potter,”
“I don’t,” she started, but then rolled her eyes, “fine.” Mandy pulled out a little box and expertly lit the joint she pulled from it, taking a puff before handing off to Ben.
Mandy shrugged. “Harry’s the white knight, who died and was reborn twice to save us all and defeated the manic.”
Ron looked at her with panic but sighed and didn’t say anything about being left alone with the Slytherin trio.
“What do they want then?” Harry point his chin towards the group still huddled together and staring their way.
“Draco,” Pansy faltered. She had been thinking about it so much. It had become so important that Draco understand, though now that he did, well it didn’t change anything did it?
“I think you’ll both be just fine gentlemen,” She stood. She wanted to give them time to talk as she was sure there was an iceberg of emotions they didn’t feel they could show her. “The practice room is open if either of you have need, anytime.” She turned back towards them, “Also I can try to keep this out of here.” She patted her pocket where the paper was.
She couldn’t speak, for her tears, but he saw the destroyed paper and took the crumbled pieces from her hand.
The girl sitting next to Ben rolled her eyes with a scowl, “Maybe we should ask the experts. Potter, Malfoy care to share?”
“And this is Sirius Lupin, my step-grandson from my son-in-law’s first marriage.” Jeannie looked to the other boy and realized Severus had brought his only real competition for the girls with him. Sirius was stunning. He had light brown hair styled into a relaxed mess, sunglasses perched among the strands and his large jade eyes were amazing. The senior boys were going to hate her for letting these two through the doors. She glanced down to the baby carriage and saw Ms. Black’s youngest charge fast asleep, as she looked up to address Sirius’ greeting, she noticed the boy’s intertwined fingers and grinned.
“The new charges will be dealt with after the original have been handled.” Judge Fumeurs announced while pulling a pile of pages to the forefront, “in the 1
“Your Grace, are you sure you’re up to this?” Judge Fumeurs asked gravely, “I want you to be fully aware of what’s happening here, it’s very important.”
“But I need to know if something happens to you immediately. We cannot allow ourselves to be used against each other. We need every piece of knowledge we can get. Even the smallest scrape of information we can pass between us may help us survive. We need to be able to move as one without outside communication.”
Tawy smiled as she approached, “I’ve been looking everywhere for you two. You’re late for your session.”
“What you should be thankful for is that the H.A isn’t a muggle born or a wizard whose spent time in the muggle world like Tawy has.” Rey commented. “So how does the ‘get Potter and Malfoy high so we can pick their brains’ plan work exactly?”
Draco laid on Harry’s bed and exhaled with a surprised chuckle as Harry pushed him down and straddled his hips. Harry leaned over him, bangs hanging down and Draco tugged on a dark lock. Harry studied him for a moment before he said, “Do you not want to go back?”
Harry reached out and stopped Draco’s hands and held them as Draco continued, “Stop. Stop it. Draco stop it!” Draco froze. “Look at me,” Harry demanded, silent until Draco’s eyes met his. “It wouldn’t have hurt her. It doesn’t mean anything. Except as a mark of your ability to survive.” Harry rubbed his hand over the mark, soothing the red and scratched skin. He lifted Draco’s arm and kissed the mark, several times. Draco shivered, and Harry mumbled a healing spell onto the skin, sealing it with a kiss. “See it’s just a tattoo now.” He rolled Draco’s sleeves back up. “There, alright love?”
Tawy leaned forward in her corner. She could practically feel the magic rise and the anticipation and room’s tension with it. The other kids backed away, wands held limply, staring avidly. She guessed the Dog and Bat to be references to Black and Snape but couldn’t guess how or why. She wondered if she were the only one to get the reference.
Clara shivered. She remembered the wanted poster of Black and she’d seen Potion Master Snape once, his very walk had been fearsome.
“I don’t understand, why did you defend me?” Draco didn’t sound angry just defeated and Harry hated the lack of fire.
“I don’t think they practice the type and amount of torture it would take to make myself or Potter talk.”
She smiled, “It’s okay. It isn’t rude when I insist, so go ahead.” Draco watched her as he picked the marker back up, as if it was a trick or a quiz. She nodded and smiled, encouraging him. “Have you ever used markers before?”
“I think you’ll find that’s exactly what we did.” Draco said softly, breaking up Murphy’s reprimand and Mandy’s demands.
The tube widened, “Siphoning is when, within that time of expansion, someone gave you both a potion.” She conjured a straw and inserted it into the tube. “So every time you used your magic,” She showed them the light shining through both the tube and straw. She drew out her wand, showing the light inside the straw being led away. “As you had no idea how much your magic had grown you wouldn’t have any indication something was wrong. Any tests measuring your levels would have measured the tube and missed the straw. However, when I gave you the cure,” She removed the straw and waved it away, “things went back to how they’re supposed to be. Now it might take some time but you will learn how your magic feels now and nothing like that will ever work again. Now is that clearer?”
However, all that aside, it still begged the question of what to do. Draco was not suited to become the next Lord of Malfoy, nor would he ever be if the information he’d gathered was even partially correct. This was a problem. They were certainly young enough to have another child and physically nothing prevented them. Nothing but Narcissa’s flat refusal. She had told him in the past she could love no other child but Draco and had never changed her stance. Draco would be the only child she would carry. There was a high chance she would kill any other child before birth to prevent the infant taking from Draco. There was a chance, though smaller, as he knew she loved him, that she would kill him to prevent him from giving any of Draco’s inheritance away.
Harry thought Draco was just awkward because they were in a muggle place, turns out it was just the wrong place. They walked into Louis Vuitton and muggle or not Draco had found his people. The awkwardness faded to understanding and the assistants in the place knew one of their own, even if he looked as if he’d just checked out of a hospital.
Harry stepped back from her, “We’ve both made some shit decisions Malfoy and I, but we had less choice than any of you want to believe. I had as much of a choice to kill that bastard as Malfoy had to serve him, which was less than none. It’s easy to blame him, but unless you were in his shoes, fuck off. You have no idea what he
Murphy, seeing he’d mostly lost his audience, let them go early. The group quickly headed towards the door. Harry and Draco hung back just to save themselves from being knocked into.
Draco closed his eyes as a slip of an idea began to form. If all Harry really needed, was to know Draco would never leave him, perhaps he had the cure for both of them.
Draco had always felt comforted by the shadow his mother cast over his thoughts, smoothing down his terror. He’d always attempted to hang onto his mother’s Imperius for as long as he could. He took a puff and felt his shoulders untense a little as he released the smoke. He glanced to Harry, who look heavy-lidded and rather comfortable.
“It’s not just that,” Healer Tawy calmly interceded before Molly could do more than open her mouth. “They’ve been through very traumatic experiences for long durations. They’re underweight and suffer from a long list of health, magical, and mentally related issues. Their magic cores have been taxed beyond measure.” She glanced to Shacklebolt, he nodded, and she added with no little consideration. “They’ve been siphoned as well.”
Draco figured it was test of their truce. He thought about what he knew and offered it. “It means someone gave us a potion, which allowed them to take magic from our magical core and to use it as their own.”
The Judges took a few moments behind their wall of silence to discuss the Malfoy’s sentences. Judge Fumeurs took a moment to send a court official out of the room. When they removed the wall and began the sentencing, it was pretty much as Harry figured, though Ron was seething.
Hermione thought to apologize for jumping ahead but, as she looked around, she realized every person in the place was smiling and no one seemed upset at all. People patted Harry’s back and shoulders with wide grins as he passed, and everyone stepped back so he had a clear path to the front counter.
“Without question. Healer Robertoun was not here during our dark times. She doesn’t understand why we did what we did, all she sees is what it did to Draco and Harry.”
Teddy shook his head. “Cards, posters, books, movies, fan clubs, classes. You two are the most famous wizards the world over. I’ve written countless papers about the two of you and, though I was tempted, I never mentioned you both leave wet towels on the floor.”
“If she’s on the floor up, how do we even go about asking her?” Harry figured the worst she could do was say no.
“Ah, well the wizarding world may consider you out of the realm of pediatrics; however, we of the medical community know better. We don't finish our growth into adulthood until 24 or so and magic continues stabilizing well into that. You’re in the right place.” She led him into a small private room, where she commanded the two Aurors to wait outside. They didn’t look happy, but they didn’t say anything to her either, as she shut the door and turned to him. “When was the last time you were in St. Mungo’s?
“Lestrange’s gonna get the kiss,” Ella sat down across from her, grabbing a magazine to glance at, “Everyone knows it. People are really pissed off. They’re like calling for blood.”
Tawy nodded and left the topic, “Alright so no muggle toys?” Draco didn’t un-tense as she thought he would, his back remained ridged as he drew a… “Draco what is that?” She watched as he coloured in the cube he’d drawn, small multi-color boxes on the bigger cube.
Draco paused and glanced over. He grinned and grabbed Harry, quickly moving their way. “Pansy!” He threw his arms around the girl, hugging her tightly. The hugs and greetings took a good five minutes. When they were finally ready to sit down, Mandy excused herself. Blaise, wand up his sleeve, cast a peace and quiet charm over the table and chairs.
Harry heard the Healer go. Malfoy didn’t look up, didn’t even move as the lights dimmed. Harry bit his lip and wrapped his arms around his knees. “Like we weren’t fucked up enough,” Harry whispered. Malfoy replied with a broken chuckle. Harry glanced at the white curtain of hair. “Can I come over?” The hair nodded. Harry got up and walked over. He thought about sitting in front of the other boy and realized he couldn’t talk to anyone about this face to face. He knocked Malfoy’s shoulder. “Shift over.”
Teddy looked to Sev too, as Siri tended to dance around topics, but Sev always just said what they wanted. Teddy liked that about Sev.
Harry glanced to Draco, who gave a slight head tilt, telling him to go ahead. Harry rolled his eyes. “Um, yeah, we do,” He stressed the ‘we’ so Draco knew he wasn’t getting out of it. “We wanted to talk about that siphoning business.”
Harry didn’t bother jumping up this time as the door opened after a pause and the same lady from last night stuck her head in. “Oh good.” She came into the room, glanced around and relaxed when she saw the closed bathroom door. “I don’t know if you remember me? Yesterday was pretty filling for you. I’m Healer Assistant Deana.”
“What is going on here?” Murphy, so busy studying the doors, he didn’t even look Mandy’s way. “The doors, how?”
“Don’t be silly,” Draco rested his head on Harry’s shoulder. He darted forward and pressed his lips to Harry’s neck, “She’s my friend nothing more and believe me, she’s got her own problems. I would never want anyone the way I want you Potter,” Matter of fact, like the sun shall rise tomorrow, “Shouldn’t I be the one worried? What about Girl Weasley?”
“No. Vincent and Goyle were the only children that were invited to the manor and they certainly didn’t know any. I never played any muggle games. We played hunt the muggle, but I didn’t like that game. And one of them always ended up crying when they got the hex.”
He tried to shove the last of his stuff into his truck. While Sev and Siri might have been apologetic about it, Teddy really didn’t mind going directly to the school.  It might have been a mob scene if anyone recognized them anyway and this way they could plan to meet with their friends out of the spotlight.  Teddy shoved and then sat on his trunk. He might need to ask Sev to help. Sev could pack anything.
Healer Murphy looked between them, “As you just heard, I’m Healer Murphy. Thank you for coming to the Trauma group. I’d like to welcome you both. This isn’t anything formal and I hope you’ll speak up in time but don’t feel pressured to. We just talk about whatever comes up.” He headed off towards the circle.
All the times he had berated himself for caring about what Potter thought, about losing his chance at Potter’s friendship and this had been waiting for him. Merlin he was such a fucking idiot. “Potter listen to me. You can’t leave me either. If I let you in, if I do this, then you can’t, can’t leave me, cause if you do…well I don’t know,”
“Maybe.” Draco allowed. The reason children went to magic school at 11 was because that’s when they experienced their magic increase. If they’d been given the potion around that time, they probably wouldn’t have noticed.
Judge Fumeurs glanced towards the reporters, who were rabid for every word and then to the generally uneasy and confused masses of the courtroom. “His crimes were extracted from his memories,” he could tell by the look on Andromeda’s face what she thought of that and went on before she could wrack him over the coals. He felt bad enough that it had been done. “They could not falsify his involvement.”
Tawy held up the papers. “I’ll get this taken this care of. Will you need a couple of overnight bags?
“I’ve set up times for Saturday. That way we can have Sunday before we have to go Hogwarts on Monday. You’ll still have a couple of days there before the train arrives.” They nodded but didn’t offer anything else, “Do you remember what the goal is for this year?”
Sev shook his head with a smirk, “It certainly wasn’t. You’d gotten that letter if you lived in Antarctica, but that’s not the question here, is it?”
She didn’t seem to notice as she attached the bracelet to Potter’s wrist, though the boy-wonder didn’t look to sure about it. “Nothing too taxing just lunch and some groups. You’re welcome to go anywhere you like on this floor. There’s a social room with all sorts of fun stuff and a library. Just don’t leave this floor. If you do, the bracelets will alarm, and the other floors are for patients who need calm. Understand?”
They sat quietly for a moment. Harry thought about going back to his own bed, but it was so nice. As much as touch bothered him, he was also touched starved. The whole thing made for a horrible circle of disgust and want and just sitting next to someone, who didn’t make him feel that disgust, was bloody brilliant.
The Judge leaned back while taking off his glasses, “Under these unusual circumstances, we know no other recourse but to remand them into the Ministries custody. As of today, Ministry custody supersedes any previous custody or claims, which have been rescinded or annulled.”
And no, this was not happening, it was not. Harry would not have it. Not after wanting this as long as he could remember, no. The magic turned from a wave into a hammer, “No, no one is taking him away from me.” He stomped his foot, the room’s floor jumped, knocking nearly everyone down. Draco grabbed a hold of the back of Harry’s jumper.
Harry hadn’t but nodded anyway, happier when Malfoy came out of the damn bathroom in time to say, “of course we remember you, Healer Assistant Deana.”
“Draco’s parents gave him over to the cause. I don’t know much, but the papers said the evil manic liked the idea of death and pain being delivered by lovely face. Draco was the Dark Lord’s torturer.”
“And you’ll be continuing the therapy groups and sessions?” Tawy asked, her quill paused, as she looked up.
Madame Tonks had done Draco an incredible service. He wouldn’t be here at all if he hadn’t been brought to her attention and Tawy was ever so grateful. Draco was a magnificent child. So intelligent and powerful and she’d almost lost the opportunity. She couldn’t imagine things would have gone so easily with Harry without him. She called them over just after they decided an ancient medical device was a magical banana peeler.
Neither Sev nor Siri had ever lied to him so he took them at their word and the excitement over took him. He was going to Hogwarts.
years stood talking, mostly about Harry and Malfoy. She was just glad they’d hashed out a working setup. Most weren’t happy but really when it came to Harry very few people had more say than herself and Ron.
Normally the Grand Wizengamot would have been led by the Minister of Magic. However, since he was so new to the post and had been in the field during the action, it had been decided the highest court would be led by a senior Judge. This allowed Shacklebolt to speak for the prosecution when he was needed.
She nodded, “it’ll cut like butter,” her face went far-away, “you won’t even feel that you’ve cut at first,” her eyes cleared, “so be careful, don’t cut deep. When you’re done, say finite.”
“I think I’ll be the judge of that.” The Healer said and while her Scottish burr was soft and even, Draco knew he’d see nothing but contempt on her face. He forced himself to look anyway. He’d have to get used to it. After all it was how everyone looked at them now. Except the dark glares she’d been throwing around melted off her face when she met his gaze and into something softer which was even more disturbing. He quickly looked away.
The cab ride took a half hour and while Violet kept looking at the meter, neither Harry or Draco spared it a glance, so Mandy worked to make sure Violet didn’t either.
Mandy snarled. “Don’t what? Don’t question why they’re here? They’ve got money and power and they’re sitting here! Why? One of them is the fucking savior! The other a fucking death eater! Why are they in here with us?”
in their lives they’ve ever chosen for themselves are each other. They will fight to protect what they’ve found together. They will use everything you people put into them to do it. Without hesitation, just as they were taught.” Tawy scowled, “Hence, if I find reason, any reason, I will remove them.”
Hermione grinned. “Yes, but they’re masses you know. Draco, Pansy and Blaise are here. They are so sorry they weren’t here that last year. They’re dying to make it up to you.” At their looks she added, “we got close after graduation, when Blaise dated Luna.”
Harry glanced to Draco, who still didn’t look happy, but it seemed like he had pressed it as far as Tawy would go right now. Harry figured he’d try again later. He glanced to Draco, who shrugged slightly. “I guess not.”
“I can’t give them anymore,” He whispered down to Harry, “I have to take what I’ve got left and try to make something new. Something worthy of your love.”
Judge Fumeurs glared with obvious annoyance, “one of you, approach the bench, and this had better be good.”
Lucius bristled and the female Auror scowled at her partner, “if the parchment doesn’t say then we don’t know. Let’s not make this unpleasant. He will submit to the exam.”
People moaned and groaned (the reporters loudly). Judge Fumeurs scowled and raised his wand and silence reined, “the spell remains in effect until you leave my courtroom and for those of you not in the know, there are serious protections against any type of spying.  Now I’ll thank you all to
Draco moved away from her, “I’ll be fine mother.” He didn’t glance back as he left, his parents wouldn’t have appreciated the gesture. As soon as they left the cells, he put his head down and kept it there. He was finally thankful for the hair lengthening potion that had gone awry. He’d been bored, locked within the cleared-out mansion, under Auror watch, and awaiting the court’s call. He’d planned to cut it some, but there hadn’t been an opportunity to find anyone. He now found it long and thick enough to hide behind. Normally he’d be glaring straight ahead, daring anyone and everyone to say or do anything. Now though, his head hurt, the pain pounding behind his eyes and he was so damn tired. Too damn weary to face hate from every person he saw without the comfort of a wand. Next to him, the Healer’s steps matched his and he heard the Aurors’ chatting behind them.
Charlie looked around the room with wide eyes. He hadn’t been around much recently. There was a lot to do in a postwar Wizarding world, even for a man who worked with dragons. Last, he’d seen Ron had been fine, but mum had said as time went on, he’d gotten worse. Like it had taken time for it to catch up with Ron what exactly he’d been through. Charlie felt guilty for not being around more, for only showing up now to see Harry. He thought this might be the first time the family had been together for more than a month. Still he couldn’t believe the changes in Ron, he looked haunted.
“Healer Robertoun,” Shacklebolt quickly got up and walked Healer Tawy’s way with purpose. They ignored everyone around them, throwing up a privacy shield once close enough.
Ron choked on his pint. Blaise patted him on the back, with distracted precision. Hermione rolled her eyes and Pansy grinned with glee, “Really?”
“Don’t say, just an article congratulating Malfoy on the commencement of his title. I’m not calling him Your Grace that’s for bloody sure.” Mandy wasn’t sure what she felt about Malfoy and Potter. On one hand, it was fantastic to have actual celebrities in the place. Pretty exciting to look up and see the people everyone was talking about a couple of tables over. On the other hand, they were freaky as hell. They were so powerful even when they didn’t have a wand between them. And their lives were one extreme to the next. They just had no concept of normal. She couldn’t put up with snooty air titles on top of it.
People had started talking louder the moment they’d sat down. Harry could hear their names among the noise. “Do you think we have to sit here?”
time, she’s said to stay away from wizarding places.” They turned to see Mandy shaking her head, “Like my sister would take you to the middle of Wizarding London and sell you to the highest bidder.”
“You best get used to it. If you think this lots jumpy, wait till you go back to Hogwarts where they know us.”
George just happened to know there was a particular closed group that met at 4 o’clock, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Friday. On Wednesday, at 4:45pm, George Weasley took a seat outside the Hogwart’s classroom he’d learned the group met within. He hoped this was the right step to take, without Fred he felt unbalanced and unsure. He second guessed himself, which he’d
Lucius leaned back from the floo. Sadly, he had little power these days, it had taken more money and favors than he was used to giving out to gain the information. It had been worth it. At least now he knew what was to come of Draco.
Ok, Mandy could totally see what Ella had been going on about when Harry smiled. She didn’t even know Draco could smile, but when he did, she looked away. There was no damn way she was going to blush, but yeah, she could see it.
Tawy paused, “the Dark Lord had a pot? Really Murphy? Marijuana Murphy, they’ve had marijuana. Have you had some?”
“It drags up all the shit that made it a trigger in the first place.” Ben tossed out over his folded arms.
Tawy scowled. “Really? The wands that dueled Voldemort and belonging to those two. Couldn’t keep them safe there. We can discuss this later. Wands. Now.”
Rey nearly fell off his seat. “You can’t be serious! That’s the last thing we should do. Who knows how they’d react to that. They could be dangerous.”
Harry frowned. This was a lot more enforcement of privacy. The privacy shield rippled across his shoulders and he noticed Malfoy tensing. He frowned, “Wait a minute, what is this group for?”
Shacklebolt leaned towards an Auror, whispered a few words and the man took off for the court’s floo. Not even 5 minutes later, the man was back with a small older man, who Shacklebolt introduced with a wave of his hand. “Director Tips, head of the Child Well-Care department.” He turned to the man, who was running nervous fingers through what little hair he had. “We would like to discuss the Malfoy boy, Director Tips.”
“Who knew watching Death Eater’s get theirs would be so bloody boring?” Ron stretched as well, one of his arms nearly hitting the witch leaving the bench behind them. He apologized with a blush and pulled his arms in, watchful of the other benches clearing out around them.
Teddy shrugged. “You guys were in the Outback when the big ones came out.” Teddy snorted, “I went in a group. The girls fought for weeks afterwards about which of you was hotter.”
years, and because she knew they wouldn’t believe her when she told them Harry hadn’t gone there, she let them go check. She sent Ginny back to her common room. Several minutes after they’d left, they re-graced her fireplace and told her what she’d already had known. McGonagall allowed them to brainstorm in her office before giving them enough platitudes to get them to go back to their common room. She told them she’d contact Kingsley and anyone else she could think of and she would, but the fact was, if Harry and Draco didn’t want to be found, well. They were rich and magically powerful enough not to be found and large part of her thought they deserved to be free.
The solicitor spoke about a prearranged fine that the court had signed off on. It turned out the Malfoy’s had signed over to the Ministry a personal gold mine that produced nearly a million gallons a year, the public was astounded. The solicitor gave a small speech about how the Malfoy’s were, from their own generosity, paying more than any other family due to their genuine want to help out those harmed by the war. People whispered in shocked but pleased tones.
Draco shrugged and waved a hand, “Australian native magic is so different. Don’t even ask; just know Harry got the blessing of a whole other nation, per usual.” Draco grinned towards Harry.
“So Teddy got something to tell us?” Siri asked him shortly after they’d finished the cake and ice cream.
A hush came over the room as two solicitors entered through the double doors, one held the door as Lucius entered and behind him Narcissa glided in.
Draco ignored the arch of jealousy and concentrated on the ached that if he lost his mother’s cold love. He would be left with nothing. The thought was horrific. “I can’t lose her Harry.”
Harry’s grinned, “She’s like my saving grace. She’s never doubted me. She never ran away. Never had to love me but she does and did, even when it made life so much harder for her.”
“I think we said something wrong.” Harry said softly. Their friends looked upset and Harry couldn’t understand why unless it was something they said.
“Like flexing a muscle that’s been hurt and healing.” Draco narrowed his eyes in thought. “It’s our magic healing from being siphoned.”
Then Neville Longbottom came over and gave Teddy a hug and it was everything he could do not to shout or do a happy dance. Teddy had had a poster of Longbottom in his room, brandishing his wand. Everyone knew Longbottom had led the Hogwarts rebellion and had killed Vortemort’s snake. He’d never thought to have this opportunity much less to be hugged and treated so warmly.
Draco rolled his eyes. Cor the speckled git was predictable. “I’m not even sure I’m returning, so worry about yourself.”
Violet seemed a little shy as she opened the door to her flat. “It’s not much, certainly not what you’re used to, I’m sure.”
Murphy sighed down at his lunch. “They traumatized the other kids. They traumatized me. It took me an hour to calm them down. Potter and Malfoy cannot talk to regular kids.”
Draco nodded, “All right Potter,” Harry raised an eyebrow to which Draco rolled his, “fine Harry, I trust you.”
Malfoy shrugged, “I may still be locked away here when it starts and if not, I don’t know if I could go back there. I don’t think France has changed its age of maturity. My parents may want to move there.”
Harry sighed, relaxing. His hand brushed over the hair at the back of his neck, he bit his lip. He hadn’t shown it to anyone. But maybe…before he could change his mind, he leaned forward and pushed up his hair. His movement caught Draco’s attention and he felt more than heard the gasp the other boy let out. Then there was a careful finger tracing the half-moon scars on either side of his neck. Draco made a hurt noise that Harry barely heard over his loud breaths. The finger left, and Harry blinked fast before he turned his head to look at Draco.
“Fluff!” Mandy greeted the barn owl, which looked down on them from her perch. She chirped a greeting and came to Mandy’s raised arm.
All of her contacts answered their floo save Mrs. Tonks. So instead of leaving a message she left some files and then reconnected with the Ministry.
“Would have I suggested it otherwise? You would’ve likely mentioned it yourself had it been Malfoy family magic instead of Black.”
The staircase was further back than Harry had gone. Draco mentioned he’d seen it as it was close to where the potion books were kept. They climbed the stairs and got about halfway before Mandy waved them to wait, she went ahead and whistled.
Hermione shared a glance with Ron, who looked pleased as punch as he smiled at her. She knew he was thrilled to just get to eat. They wait patiently while Harry had a few words with the elder Bones and by the end of it all three of them had not only gotten a free lunch but a table in the corner as well. Harry opened his sandwich with a grin, “that was nice of him. I’m glad Susan is doing so well.”
Hermione’s hand squeezed the back of Ron’s neck protectively and then ruffled his hair playfully, “Then it’s time you get yours cut Charlie,” she grinned.
Draco sat thoughtfully for a few minutes and then said softly. “Do you know what the first thing I did was, after I received the title?”
She pondered while Helen traded him potions back and forth with the soda, “we’ll just put his robes on over the scrubs. He’ll be fine and more comfortable. He’s going to be too sensitive for those clothes anyway. Is that alright with you Draco?”
Even as Draco bristled next to him, Harry just felt exhausted. He touched Draco’s hand, “Is that what this is about? You want us to tell you all the ways they fucked us up.”
“They said they needed to destroy something.” Mandy replied and quickly added. “Malfoy said the wandless they knew was nasty and to get their wands.”
Harry glanced at Draco’s band as they turned and took off down the stairs, sure enough red. He couldn’t believe they hadn’t noticed.
She smiled though it was one of the hardest things she’d ever done. It just hurt her heart how they tried to reassure her that being treated like less than human was alright, what they expected. “I’m glad you have each other. I hope you can share with each other the things you can’t share with me or anyone else.”
Teddy twisted in his seat, anxious and a little mad at his grandmother for telling them. He wanted to be loyal to them. He wanted to forsake the place that had caused them both so much pain. Yet he’d heard so many very cool things about Hogwarts. His parents had gone there. He kicked the legs under his chair. “It was probably a mistake. None of my friends got a letter. It’s only supposed to be for kids in Britain.”
Harry shrugged at Draco questioning look before following the others into the room. The boy, who had called them in, lay on his bed, book propped in front of him. The room didn’t seem any different than theirs, just further from the healer’s station. Harry couldn’t see how that would make this room any safer from getting caught.
“I think she said, a week? So, we could get our stuff together and arrive early.” Harry nudged Draco, “right?”
“Me either, so let’s find out.” Harry pulled on Draco’s hand, starting the boy to run along side him.
Tawy shook her head minutely but then did her best to look between them and convey understanding. “I know I’ve explained this before, but I need you to hear what I am saying. The night staff going into your room like that was a mistake, it will not happen again. Regardless to what is happening, no matter how bad your nightmares are.” They nodded but she felt like it was something they still feared. She wished she could go back and reprimand everyone involved with that mistake harsher. “Last night was no one's fault and I’m not placing any blame. Can we talk about it?”
Draco’s smile was bright but fleeting, even as he busied himself, taking longer than he needed and dropping his head to affix the sunglasses back to his shirt.
“This is preposterous,” Kade scowled, “Mr. Weasley, I don’t believe you should accept the help of this woman.”
Harry grinned at her and it nearly took her breath. “Yeah. I’m going to marry that boy.” He stopped, and she nearly ran into him, he looked at her in amazement. “I’m going to marry that boy.”
“Thanks?” Harry replied. Harry glanced over his shoulder in time to see Draco nod and tried not to smirk at seeing Draco at his ice prince best.
Neville felt sick, he passed the paper over to Seamus, “can they write that? It can’t be right to tell the whole world.”
“Fluff, do you mind taking a message?” Mandy ran her fingers over the owl’s head as she asked. The owl cooed and stuck out her leg, trying to look puffed and important. Mandy laughed. “I guess not.”
Blaise side-eyed Pansy and said, “We mean they love you, but they seriously lack the skills parents need.”
Harry grinned and Mandy’s eyes widened, by now she’d seen a million pictures of Harry Potter and in none of them had he smiled like that.
Pansy sniffed, “I never did like him, arse. Pulling this shite on Draco, dropping this on him. Draco didn’t want to be his leader. He tried to get rid of them a million times and the stupid things just came back. Draco told them he was dangerous and that idiot has the audaciously to blame Draco for his fucked-up life.” She looked to Ron and Hermione and waved a hand over the parchment, “what do we do with this?”
While Harry was happy for the opportunity, he did wonder why Tawy had signed for them. He looked to Draco and saw the same question. He met Draco’s eyes and conveyed that they’d have to ask Tawy. Draco nodded and returned his attention to the group. They covered a few more topics, of which Harry could mostly ignore for the building excitement of having his wand if only for a couple hours. It seemed like he’d barely held it since affixing it.
The senior Judge chosen was a rather young looking 100 years old. Harry thought him to be pretty fair so far. He didn’t seem to like the reporters, which Harry could totally agree with. Senior Judge Fumeurs picked up his wand to begin court proceedings. He was suspended in his action by the courtroom’s double doors flying open and as one the room turned to look back at the entrance.
She looked up from her muffin and reminded herself that if she’d wanted to eat in peace, she should’ve gone to her office, remaining in the staff room was asking for interruptions, “Yes Murphy?”
Harry looked at Draco and Tawy could see his joy and love, his happiness even in the wake of such news. Her smiled warmed and grew more real by second as Draco smiled back and it was so sweet and love-filled. They were both so filled with emotions that a month ago she wasn’t sure if they could express anymore much less feel. It made her so happy for the both of them.
Ben frowned. “I kind-a thought it would be exciting, being mixed up with all those famous wizards. Calling them by name and tangling in their adventures. Thought it’d better than being kicked around by my dad.”
Only seven or eight of the group stayed to hear what he had to say, and it was George’s luck that it was pretty much the group he wanted to speak with.
They reached the bar, Violet leaned over. They ordered enough for everyone and as Violet stood before them pouring Ron’s pint, Harry said, “Violet, I’m going to marry Draco.”
Harry watched him go with lead in his stomach. He threw off Hermione’s hand when she reached for him again. The lead turned to molten lava when someone began to clap and then everyone was clapping and laughing and Harry knew this was where he lost it too.
Draco’s whole body relaxed, his smile widened, he swung Harry’s hand, “Have you ever seen the gazebo Harry?”
As soon as the Malfoy party reached their table, Lucius leaned into their solicitor. The man quickly nodded and then looked to the judge. “Your Honor, we seem to be missing,”
Tawy sat the furthest away. She found a chair and sank into it with a sigh. Molly’s greeting had been gracious but cold, which was expected. She was relieved that coldness hadn’t been extended to Draco, only decorum that once turned away, seemed to melt into pure interest on Molly’s side. Tawy didn’t notice at first, her attention taken up by Percy Weasley, who insisted in reintroducing himself and speaking about the new ministry. So, it wasn’t until Tawy saw her stand that she paid attention. Ginny didn’t sound angry when she requested to speak with Harry alone, which Harry granted, though he looked anxious and not quite happy to do so. Draco even less so. The glare Ginny twitched towards Draco told her that Ginny might be a problem. It seemed, from what Harry had revealed to her, that Ginny had been much more invested in their relationship than Harry had been. Though Tawy didn’t think Harry had been aware of that.
“Okay then, let’s try this," he paced the table, stepping over the mashed potatoes, "who here has learned Occlumency by being mind-raped by Snape and Bellatrix until you can stop them? Having to work 24 hours a day to keep Dumbledore and Voldemort out of your head, because they try to sneak into every single fucking thought you have.” He rubbed the side of head, “they’re all dead and my head still hurts,” he chuckled. He looked around at the horrified faces, some shaking their heads and looking to their friends. “Oh come on, that can’t be just me and Malfoy again, can it?” He looked around but no raised a hand or even met his eyes, “Well just us again then.”
“Hello boys, got yours right here, finish the shakes, yeah?” The lady handed over a tray to each of them and Harry quickly scanned for a table. He found an empty one by the wall and headed towards it.
Hermione shook her head. “No, they did date, they broke it off. Actually,” she blushed, “I’ve been seeing a lot of Blaise since my divorce from Ron.”
How could it be that he was so angry with his parents, and yet, he yearned to be with them? In the past he would have gone to them and let them use him again. He would have taken the pain, hurt, rage, and shoved deep inside himself. Draco couldn’t do that anymore. There was no more room in him.
Harry wrapped an arm around his waist and Draco appreciated Harry’s palm, warm and comforting beneath his ribs.
Draco glanced around the small room. There was a single hospital cot with a table next to it, a small rolling table, a standing armoire and a couple of chairs. “I haven’t been,” he stood with his back to the wall next to the bedside table.
Judge Fumeurs sighed unhappily, “Continuing onward, I wish your report had been of some surprise Healer, but unfortunately his condition is much as we had predicted.” He nodded to Andromeda, who nodded back with a look of vindication. The Judge straightened, “well let’s not keep him waiting.” He waved his hand and it was announced, “The court calls forth His Grace Duke of Black, Draco Malfoy.”
“Proud?” Harry blinked in shocked surprise. People didn’t say that to him. Well Remus and Sirius had, but really, they were it and it hurt to remember how good it felt to hear it.
Ella nodded and slowly took a sip from her drink, dragging it out, as she held their attention. “I saw the memo at the healer’s station. Along with the number allowed viewing at one time and a reminder that taking any pictures of them is strictly prohibited.”
Rey rolled off his beanbag and then grabbed Clara, pulling her away. “Shite…shite,” the boy mumbled, while Clara tried to ask him what was going on.
Later he’d traced the new markings on his mother’s arm, she’d let him, but had never told him what they were from.
“Horribly mistreated,” he smiled with sickening delight, “huh, that must be the reason we can’t sleep and have some lovely addictions to potions going on.”
Harry was getting far more amusement out of Draco frightening these blokes than he knew he should be. He should’ve been trying to rein Draco in, but it was fun to watch and he wasn’t hurting anyone. Besides, even if no one else could see it, Harry could see the upwards curl of Draco’s scowl and who was he to ruin Draco’s fun.
Arthur rubbed his wife’s shoulder and sadly shook his head, “there is a difference between caring for your child because he is your child and caring for him because he carries your line.”
“And where does she come by that theory?” Rey moved what was left his lunch over to make way for his book.
Ron nodded and sighed at the change in Charlie’s tone at the Malfoy part of the sentence. “Give Draco a break Charlie. Harry loves the guy, like loves him. I’ve never seen Harry get anything he truly wants so don’t throw mud at it, right?”
He shrugged, “no choice. Had to take something. I don’t wanna go to Azkaban,” he blinked tearful, “I’m trying to be good.”
Violet sat next to them, where an attendant had set them out of the way with bottled water. She watched with wide eyes. “Look at them, jumping to for him. That boy is something else.”
Harry sat back; braid held limply in his hands as he blinked. He had wondered why suddenly he could give Sirius a title when he’d been told he couldn’t. He’d thought it was because Sirius had been found not guilty of any previous crimes. He’d thought it was because of all the awards given to Sirius, and here it had been Draco. “Thank you.”
“That’s fine Mandy. Anyone else?” There was silence as everyone delayed and hemmed their attention around. Murphy sighed, “Okay, let’s talk about things that calm us down after something upsets us. Ella?” He nodded to the girl who had shyly raised her hand.
“Hmm,” She leaned down to look at the fine line of blood that had rolled from out Draco’s sleeve and made the cuff of his shirt bright red. She turned her head to studied Harry. She leaned back, straightened, “it would be easier to look at Potter first. His sleeve is raised, which means we’ll only have to turn his arm over to see what we’re dealing with.” She pulled her wand, “may I move the bed further back?”
Draco took another drag just to spite him, but then offered it. Harry took the joint with one hand, grabbed Draco’s wrist with the other and pulled until Draco consented to sharing the beanbag with him. “This thing won’t blow up or anything?”
Three months later and Teddy could barely contain himself. It was hard saying goodbye to all his friends. It was harder still to say goodbye to his grandmother, who had found life and a new love in Canada and didn’t want to go back, though he would still see her over the longer breaks.
Ron nudged his other shoulder, “It’s his own memories which are going accuse him mate. You say whatever you have to say to make it alright with yourself. Just remember, in the end it’s the court’s choice.”
Rey jerked and looked to see Draco studying him, like the blond did before he got annoyed, his hand out.
After a few breaths, Harry jogged over to Draco, laughter bursting from him. “That was so much fun. We’re doing that again!”
He thumped his head against the wall, cursing himself for his weakness. If he didn’t answer she might use veritaserum. For all he knew any lie or misinformation might get him a steeper sentence. He thumped his head harder, “I have horrible nightmares.”
Judge Fumeurs leaned back as the Judge to his left and right slanted towards him. The three conferred for a moment, before Fumeurs straightened and looked down to Healer Robertoun. “Madam Healer,” he sighed and, for a moment, looked every moment of his one hundred years, “please continue.”
She sighed with a for-longed breath and let him go, blade in his hand, “You better go Harry, you’re blinking.”
Neville shrugged, “I don’t think they’ll have a choice. Once Harry realizes it’s his only way out, his only way to see us. I think he’ll demand it.”
Harry studied him momentarily before nodding. “Okay, that would be good. You can’t be slinging mudblood around everywhere, and I’ll try not to push your buttons.”
Fumeurs raised a hand. “They should have never put you in circumstances where the only way to keep you safe was to lock you away. Parents are irresponsible when they bring their child into a house of insanity and those people were insane.”
The Dr.’s smile dimmed somewhat faced with Draco’s cold look. He coughed, looked next to himself, and brought forth a woman to stand next to him. “This is my consultant, Penny.”
“In mass, nearly as many as the Malfoy’s have.” Pansy replied. “They’ve all returned, most confused and in a couple of cases with a cease and desist Ministry letter attached.”
Then there was Draco. Harry always loved Draco, always craved his presence, regardless to any other feelings or numbness. However, as much as the ties between them helped him and gave him strength. Sometimes, they guided each other to some very dark places. Places where all he could do was cling onto Draco and hope they pulled each though. Places that without Draco he wouldn’t have wanted to pull though.
“We have need for a knife.” Draco said, studying Vane with a tilted head as he spoke calmly, “would you be the one to ask for such an item?”
Mandy’s face pinched. “People always say something. Pity the poor girl whose mother sold her for potions.”
“Yep,” Mandy grabbed another magazine and ended up pushing it away. Everything her sister had brought this time all covered the same thing. It was disgusting. She couldn’t imagine the whole world knowing. People were writing in and giving opinions on it, like their opinion mattered, like giving an opinion was okay.
Muggle music was fantastic. Draco loved Queen and everything else he’d heard so far too. He wasn’t sure about tv, most of it was rubbish, but he liked movies. Not the ones with magic, through the other kids at the hospital had a lot of fun tearing them apart. So far Die Hard was a favorite as was Men in Black. He’d hated the Titanic movie though. Recent experience had taught him, something told to be un-anything, would certainly befall whatever it was meant to be safe against.
Draco didn’t look at the Healer or even Harry though he was facing him and he hadn’t pulled out of Harry’s hold. “Afterwards in the manor, we were there for months, and neither ever came and spoke to me. They didn’t even come into my wing of the house. Once I blew up a potion and the Auror guard came to check on me, not them. She sent me a letter to tell me the solicitor had secured my Black title.”
Siri quickly nodded, “of course. We’ve houses there. You could visit us every holiday. Call us whenever you needed.”
That sounded about perfect to Harry and he let Draco pull him up. They had learned sharing a single joint was about all they could handle, so decided to leave before another was started. Mandy understood and waved them off as Ellie, Cora, and Rey, entered into the secret room.
She nodded, mentally blaming herself for even coming, but knowing Draco would love getting some word from his mother. “Yes, Mr. Malfoy.” She pocketed the chain, just as Narcissa rushed over with a parchment, sealed with the Malfoy emblem.
Harry sprawled a quick note to Hermione, detailing the address and name of the club and what time they’d get there. He hoped she got it in enough time to gather everyone.
Draco studied Andromeda, taking a slight step back at the sight of her. Harry could practically see him trying to work out if it was Bellatrix and his relief when he realized it wasn’t. Having worked this out and not sure who she was, Draco dismissed her and looked his mother’s way, as Tawy announced. “My apologizes your Honor, he’s still groggy from the potions. Though he is fully able to comprehend, his body hasn’t quite caught up to him yet.”
Harry ran his fingers through his hair nervously, “Um Violet, we’d like to pay for a cab, if that’s alright by you?”
“They aren’t normal kids Murphy. They’ve never been normal. For the last couple of years they’ve been living weapons. They need the groups they’re in, let them stay.”
Draco shrugged, “I’ve called him lots of things, one of them da, he answers to it too.” He smiled at their laughter.
Draco grabbed Harry’s hand and pulled him close. “You’re equal?” and Harry looked so earnest as he nodded, he really meant it. He saw them as equals, loved him. Draco kissed him, “Maybe I can take care of myself, but Potter you’ll always be my hero.”
Harry growled and hissed lowly, “you will not call him that,” Draco’s hand on his arm physically stopped him from charging up the stairs, but it was clear he wanted to.
Draco huffed in wounded aggravation. “I’ve always known that if I wasn’t what they wanted me to be, they wouldn’t want me. And I’m not, I’m so not, I’m so far from what they want, what they expect of me. I’m a coward. I’m not strong. I don’t agree with what they want. If you kill everyone you’re better than then who are you better than? I’m glad the Dark Lord lost. I’m glad he’s dead.”
She nodded, “He’s been subjected to the cruciatus curse so many times that we had to administer nerve regenerator potions. He’s damaged his vocal cords, but we were able to repair them. He’s had some vascular and neuron damage that were causing him severe and nearly constant headaches. The list goes on for some time as the child’s in a bad way but in the end, he’s suffers from abuse plan and simple. We’ve had to put him on a step plan to reverse the damage.”
Hermione reacted to the question as she would any questions asked of her, with an answer. “Someone licensed by the ministry to oversee the ritual, a witness, ah I think that’s it.”
Harry glanced up and down to the end of the bed where Draco was drawing a, he looked closer, a damn fine dragon on his leg with markers, which showed a lot more creativity than the ‘property of H. Potter’ he’d written on Draco’s calf.
Harry blinked. “What do you mean? I went in and claimed my parent’s vaults. The goblins didn’t say there was anything else.”
George stood as the door opened, overlooking the group as they spilled causally into the hallway. The core group of seventh years, soon to be eighth years. Every Hogwart’s child (under their year) owed their life to this group. As this was the group that had successfully fought off every attacker who’d tried to get into the common room where they’d put all the younger students.
If Lucius hadn’t been under house arrest, Tawy would have certainly chosen to meet elsewhere. She didn’t press them, waiting patiently, if they chose not to go in, she wouldn’t make them.
Harry smiled sadly. “My mum is the only person who ever loved me without that love being conditional. Everyone after her loved me with a reason, Dumbledore, because I was his great hope. Sirius and Remus, because I was all they had left of James. The Weasleys, because Dumbledore told them to. I’m not saying Ron doesn’t love me. I think he does now, but he was my first friend because he was told to be.”
Mandy opened the window and owl took off with a hoot. “She’s a real good flier.” She noticed Harry watching closely, “You don’t have to worry about her.”
Tawy was sure he did. “I see. Anything else I should know?” She saw even revealing this much bothered them, but they loved the boy enough to try. They had nothing further for her and she lifted the bubble.
The bench was hard, and another headache was gaining power, but it could have been worse. Draco glanced from their holding cell to the one across. Where several of his father’s ex-cohorts paced and argued among themselves while frequently throwing dirty looks their way. One of them caught Draco looking and licked his lips lewdly before winking. Draco quickly looked away. When they’d first been brought down here, one of the two Aurors had meant to put them in with the other accused. Thankfully the female Auror had stopped him. Draco had been so relieved. He hadn’t even reacted when she had said to put the child and his parents in a separate cell.
“Hermione Granger-Weasley has a blog about trying to find you guys. Sometimes she writes letters to you on it, it’s seriously popular.”
Mandy smirked. “Yeah, you don’t really hide it well. Violet thought you were flinching at the prices not the fabric. I got an idea.”
Draco knew someone was coming down the walkway, simply due to the pickup in noise, but since neither of his parents reacted, he didn’t either. He didn’t know what to think when a Healer in light blue robes, sandwiched between the two Aurors from earlier, stopped outside their cell. The Healer was a middle-aged woman in her mid-seventies with grey streaking her light brown hair. She was stout, perhaps slightly taller than him, and looked to be a no-nonsense type of woman. The disgusted look on the Healer’s face when she looked at his mother made Draco blister with righteous anger.
Draco sighed. He simply had no idea of how to conversate with his parents. He’d never attempted to meaningfully interact with them before. In the past his parents had ordered and he had followed. Superficial temper tantrums had been tolerated by his mother when he was little, but that had been the extent of his rebelling. Looking at them now, he just didn’t know what to do. He knew they were trying. He also knew they would never say anything meaningful to him while Tawy and Harry stood by.
Draco didn’t want to make an excuse and jump away. Harry’s touch didn’t make him flinch. He knew if he didn’t say something Harry might leave and right now, he actually wanted someone to stay. “Have you ever done that to a privacy shield before? Like we did today?”
Draco couldn’t believe how nonchalant she sounded, like it wasn’t a big deal. She was still calm as if he hadn’t ruined any of her plans. She didn’t even raise her voice. He didn’t know how to deal with it, so he thought over the suggestion. He was sure they would do something no matter what he wanted or what he thought, and a dreamless sleep sounded better than most of the things he could think of. He nodded.
Tawy tapped her chair and it moved to the front of the couch. “I promise it is not nearly as horrible as you seem to imagine. How about this, what if,” she waved her wand and held out her hand as a basket flew into her grasp. “How about if you both stay in here? You can take turns under a privacy bubble with me and then we switch. Can we try that? I even have something fun I think you’ll like to work on.” She pulled out two tiny little pads, which grew to huge sizes when she tapped them and then two boxes she enlarged as well.
Draco found the mall horrifying. They’d been there an hour and bought nothing even though Violet had pointed out several things that would be good enough. He leaned into Harry as Violet and Mandy pursued a sales rounder a few feet away. “Harry all this stuff is cheap. Look there’s lots of the same thing, nothing is original. They don’t even measure you and I think some of it is made from things not fabric and the leather feels wrong.”
Partially down the article Neville heard Pansy chant ‘no’ beneath her breath. She turned her head away, blinked rapidly, before she turned back with fury. “I’m going to sue this rag to the ground the moment Killsmen gets back.”
Draco nodded and kept the disgust off his face. It wasn’t like he had a choice. He rather wished the woman would stop asking him like he could say no.
“Muggles can’t see the true cover of the magazine. Just like other stuff, flowers or something. Also, there’s a standard muggle ‘lack of interest’ charm on them.”
She grinned. “That was brilliant. I’ve never seen anything like it honestly. It’s so hard to believe you’re just 16.”
Harry laughed at Malfoy’s straight face, for once able to take joy in the others perfect sense of sarcasm.
Harry nodded. Tawy looked to Draco. Draco’s mouth twisted in thought, his eyes trained on Harry. Several minutes, she waited while the blond seemed to struggle with what to say, finally his eyes regained focus. “It’s like I hold a string which connects me to him. I know if I need him, he’ll know it, if I need him to hear me, he will.”
Teddy shook his head, looking between his brothers. He owed it to them to be honest. “I want to go, but,”
Minerva sighed and carefully didn’t roll her eyes. She picked up her cup, “Indeed,” she didn’t see how anyone could have missed the signs. Even Severus had noticed. What she really wanted to do was remind Molly that she was not in fact Dumbledore and had no use for meddling. Especially in Harry’s life. She actually thought removing Harry and Draco from their adult influences might not have been such a bad idea, through the ministry had cocked it up in the way of removal.
Ron’s bellow seemed to carry. Hermione elbowed him, before Harry had the chance, but the whole place was already looking their way. Ron gulped, and Hermione sighed, but the elderly man at the front of the line paused in his order and looked back with squinting eyes. “Mr. Potter? Is that you lad?”
Draco yanked his arm back. The idea of Violet, a muggle, a muggle he liked, who had treated him so nicely touching that thing made him sick.
Ella’s eyes widened, while Mandy whispered something to Ben, he nodded and leaned forward as if they had the wand on them.
“I know,” She leaned forward, “I’m not angry. I wish you had come to me before attempting blood magic, but I am not angry.”
Harry nodded. He figured it was his best bet. That way Draco wouldn’t hear his problems, but Harry wouldn’t be alone.
The man sighed, huffed a little and then went lax with slumped shoulders. “In the past my superiors,” he now spoke clearly and with strength, “ordered me not to make a file and to ignore Madam Tonk’s requests.”
It wasn’t as concise an explanation as she’d like but she thought it was likely as close as she was going to get. It was obvious the sigil didn’t have any immediate adverse effects or at least none they didn’t like or want. “Alright.” Demanding inquires would likely only cause them to pull away and influencing a sigil was not recommended at all.
“One of them would play at being a muggle and then me and the other would hunt the muggle down and give him a stinging hex.”
“The library,” Rey answered, but seeing their confusion, added, “there’s a staircase in the very back with books all the way up. The staircase connects the two floors and if you’re standing on it, the bracelets doesn’t alarm from our side. The ones at the top can’t go on the staircase and we can’t step onto their floor, but we can pass stuff over the top stair.”
He picked up the fine golden chain from his desk. He’d gone above and beyond on this little piece of work. Narcissa’s blood had been the final piece and getting the blood of wizard without their knowledge even between them had been neigh impossible. However, it was now done.
She shrugged, “I am, though our most notable family members were squibs, a musician and a doctor. I guess healing runs in the family.” She smiled, “we’re going to apparate to St. Mungo’s, and you’ll side along with me, alright?”
“I would like a copy of the custody decree.” Molly announced, perhaps in looking it over they could find a loophole or a measure of comfort.
Andromeda studied the pictures and twisted her fingers, “I believe, and I’m not certain, but the longer it takes to build the bond the deeper the bond.”
Draco bit his lip and played with the apple slice. Likely anyone they met would worship Potter and hate him, but if he was on somewhat good terms with Potter, well maybe people wouldn’t outright hex him. “Yeah.” And honestly, he was rather over fighting.
Harry turned and stared. Draco had changed clothes, fitted jeans and sky-blue collared shirt with the top buttons undone. Sunglasses perched in his hair. “They make the best shoes here Harry. I’ve picked out a pair and some clothes for you. I need you to come try on.”
The Judge’s chambers were more populated than Harry had counted on. He wasn’t sure why they were even there. Molly had some idea that they were called in to speak up on Mrs. Tonks’ behalf and ability to care for Draco. Harry wasn’t sure why that meant
