Draco glared at them fiercely, but they weren’t cooperating with him by flinching in return, having both casually glanced away from him, staring out as one great lump of disinterest across the excited masses. Irritated, he turned his focus back to the victorious Gryffs, across the way.  They were totally barmy over there: all he could see was a horde of scarlet-and-gold, roiling.
“Yes?” Harry looked expectantly at Hermione. “Do you think we should simply sell off the properties, then? Because if that’s the logic, then it’s not going to stop on its own, this campaign to make us both become parents. But if it's not personal, then I'd rather not stick about and be continually browbeaten. I've gone off eels altogether and red velvet does less than nothing for me. Not exactly helping me do well at work, either.”
"Hmmm?" Harry smiled sleepily. He was so very comfortable—wouldn't hurt to have a little snooze right here, either. Their private island was very private indeed. "I beg to differ, prat. You cry at the drop of a hat."
To expose them. Or Harry, rather. Specifically. Of course, there'd been no earthly need to come out with such a earth-shattering thing as this, not now. Not ever. No, as Harry knew for ruddy bare-faced incontrovertible fact and to his own ragged despair, he'd just accomplished his very own species of personal doom all by his lonely, with no help from anyone nor any circumstance acting as
"I may, then? You're not stuck in the thick of it?"
Draco cleared his throat a second time; coughed genteelly when his Adam's apple must've stuck, mid-swallow. He'd gathered himself together, preparing to move in some decisive direction; Harry felt the vibrations through the conduit of the mattress. He tensed, helpless in the near-Stygian darkness that had done nothing useful to muffle ill-conceived confessions.
"No!" Draco closed his eyes. "I—forget it, Potter! Just forget I ever said a word!"
"Oh! That's right, poor girl!" Parkinson shrieked. "Let's sign her up straight away, shall we?"
Harry…" he added breathlessly but with a snap to it, bound and determined to make that known for all to hear. For it was crucial; he knew it for certain—in the way far back of his mind—to point that out.
"Not distracting, precisely," he grinned. "Just, erm, resetting your channel, a bit, tosser. You seem…tense. Too tense. For a Friday night. I want you not to be, yeah?"
"And—"
Harry bit viciously into his chosen muffin. He rolled his shoulders to ease the tension in his neck and scowled miserably at his long-time friend, both green eyes in play now and all his attention focused on that grinning freckled monkey-face.
"Hmm. Still, darling, I do think you should floo him,” she insisted. “At the Ministry. Leave a message if naught else. It’s been simply ages since you two spent any decent amount of time together and I know you’ve missed him. He might even be able to offer you a few suggestions--or perhaps that dear Hermione Granger-Weasley will. She’s incredibly competent, as we all know, and I’ve heard from a little bird lately that Grimmauld Place has not been the easiest to manage either.  A bit of a sticky wicket going on there, from all I’ve heard tell.”
"Yes," Draco shrugged his resignation. "Well, what choice do we have? Really? I mean,
“Shut up!" Harry thrust an elbow into Malfoy's stomach, but gently, smiling at the under-the-breath 'Oof!' which resulted. "Doesn’t mean you can lord it over me any time you please. I
"Go." Harry's soft command, a literal leitmotif of denial, was a hammer to Draco's ears, never ceasing. "
“Well,” Draco said, staring about, sharp eyes picking out the newly updated and apparently now also Harry Potter-biased design features. “There weren’t. But now there are.”
Draco blinked at him, long and slow, as a kneazle does, stretched out in the sunshine. Or a dragon, happily safeguarding his horde.
"Which one do you like, Draco?" he asked, his enunciation very slow and excessively patient, rather as if he were addressing someone mental. "Those are the friendship rings, Malfoy, there. And—and the other, too. Which one do you like the most? I'd like to give it to you."
"Well…what d'you want me to do, then, Draco?" Harry grumbled back. "He's got a crush. Can't do much about that but wait it out."
"Ye-yeah?"
"Ick! Ack!" Draco shuddered. "Fucking
! came the sound of a Bludger and its unwary Ravenclaw target, as both spiraled away to the ground below, the latter shrieking like a bloody banshee.
But Potter was in action again, seizing Draco's wrist and dragging him straight to one of the maroon upholstered armchairs stationed before his desk.
Harry, now irked in at least three different ways, noticed Malfoy was glancing their way, attracted by Ron’s commotion.
“Nor that your bloody house had such a burning hot penchant for red velvet swagging and jellied eels, I'd imagine," Draco teased. "Ah, the things we learn, yes?”
say he will. This is unusual, even for Draco.”
Malfoy slammed home, Harry's knees bent in half against his collarbone and whitening with the applied pressure, propped up against yet still sliding clumsily off the planes of his broad shoulders what with all the sweat mingled, his face pointy-sharp with intensity and his cheeks hollowed out with visible want. Harry thought he was absolutely mind-boggling beautiful, this impassioned Malfoy; he could gaze for hours…if he didn't die of painful bliss first. His intestines rocked on their pinions as Malfoy ploughed in; he was jangled up and rearranged on every level.
Granger's eyebrows met her hairline briefly and then disappeared entirely. She parted her lips but said nothing.
Gods, but he loved him—
Silently, and without the teeniest creak, the door finished its grand opening arc, revealing an absolutely gorgeous suite, filled with lovely light, beautiful furnishings, delightfully aromatic scents, truly pleasing to the senses in every possible manner, and clearly the best possible place ever to house an Heir to the House.
"No! Not just," Potter waffled, then set his chin. "I mean-I
"Nor see anyone," Harry continued, undeterred by the continual smartarse interruptions. "And the main library's pretty dimly lit now; all the sconces snuffed. Huh. Hmmm…"
Then there was the Muggleborn bint and Weaslebee to contend with; likely they'd be climbing the walls by now, awaiting their Hero. Draco would be hexed to sodding pieces.
“Mm-hmm, okay,” Harry hummed, and bumped a shoulder against Draco’s tense form, propelling them forward. "Sounds horrid. Keep on, then, if we're doing this."
“Er...yes. Um. Try moving out?” Hermione grinned weakly, humping a hopeful shoulder at them. “I mean, there’s not much else you can do, really. Short of selling up altogether. It's another option, is all. Put them to let, perhaps, find yourselves a decent flat together, and wait for it all to die down and blow over. Eventually they’ll probably give it up, you know, Ancient Magic or no. No House, not even a Wizarding one, can maintain that level of stress for too long. They'll go quiescent again, as Harry said.”
“Erm…sure, Harry,” Hermione smiled feebly, reluctantly nodding. Her toast—whole wheat, buttered, gooseberry jam-spread—seemed to be disagreeing with her.
"Y-Yeah? S-Sorry!"
A hidden philharmonic played 'Pomp and Happenstance'; petals filtered down from the Charmed ceiling.
under—"
“Man up, Harry!” Hermione hissed, jabbing him painfully with a wicked elbow. “Give the arse a whack, will you? And make it sharpish! He deserves it!”
Of all things, Draco knew Quidditch, and thus flying, and Potter really was…really, he
"No," Harry replied, easily enough, casting away his spent fag with a sneer.
"Alright, Ron; calm down," Harry soothed. "It's alright. Really."
, Hermione. How could he?"
“…No,” Theo replied after a moment, sulkily.
"That sounds brilliant, Draco!" Potter's gaze was glowing; Draco caught tiny flecks of gold swimming in it, visible now that they seemed lit from within. And the little berk hadn't stopped his pointless grinning once—in fact, it was far worse now than before.
Ron, unheeded, gasped beside him; neither Harry nor Hermione spared him a second glance.
It struck Draco again, the force of his requirement. Harry needed to agree, preferably right this moment. And he must wear Grandme're's lovely ring to prove it. To show the rest of the wankers in Hogwarts and the world that Harry Potter was Draco's own. His-his-his! For there were a great many people who professed to loving Harry—who wanted him for their own. All people whom Draco hated on general principle and whom he was horribly jealous over…and fearful of. For some, he knew, were likely far more suitable for Harry than he ever was: more powerful, more learned, more…Gryffindor.
“Indeed. I shall be frightfully honoured, Potter, to accept your so gracious invitation to dine. So, the usual time? The usual wine? Swill, rather.”
“Ummm, Malfoy!” Harry gasped, wriggling fitfully. “More—more, you git. You can’t stop there, berk! I need this! All day long, I’ve needed this!”
"Oh, no," he muttered, his features sharp and predatory. "Not now, Potter. Not when I've finally got you all to myself. No bolting."
"Of course," Hermione echoed, smiling, as if that made perfect sense and could be used as a valid excuse. She nodded with some species of arcane female satisfaction, still rummaging through her bag for the requested notes. "It is, isn't it?"
, kneeling pathetically and offering up his pathetic little heart gift-wrapped for all to see. To a Plebe, who simply had no concept! "Look at me, berk! Down here!" he hissed.
"I like it, I suppose. And yes, again--it's all true. I am indeed home to stay and for the foreseeable future. Bloody Grimmauld Place certainly seems to believe I am.” He chuckled ruefully, shrugging. “Judging by the way it's been acting up since I set foot back into it. I mean, it's always been a little odd, but this! Which I actually wanted to ask your advice about but we'll get to that, yeah? Thanks, though. I'm chuffed you're happy. Not that I wouldn't expect you to be, but still. It’s good, all of it. Brilliant to finally see you again, and in person, too. I've missed you something fierce, you know. I said, didn't I? Earlier.”
“Draco! Really! His arse id gripping the stick!”
How he refrained from screaming, Draco didn't know. He blamed it squarely on Harry, though, and clamped down on the acid welling in his gut. Fiercely!
"But never
think!"
New specs; quite stylish, Draco noted, letting his gaze slip down and proceeding to conduct his own sly once-over: Same old hair; perhaps a shade longer. A marvellously tailored suit beneath the departmental robes; likely Italian. Not a single extra ounce on the man beneath the suiting either; Potter was as wiry and leanly built as always.
do, now." He sneered, and it was all Malfoy; learned behavior, obviously. Draco nearly sneered right back, defensively, but caught himself just in time. "Go away. Go back to your friends, Malfoy, go back to the flat, carry on with your life.
!' in hellish chorus.
be the superior build;
Draco stifled himself sufficient to admit, "Not that I mind, Harry. You've good taste, at least."
"If you insist of course I shall," he replied. "Obviously the only remedy for Bulstrode's curse is for me to humour you whilst we wait for the curse to wear off on its own, your ArchMageness,” Draco flipped a mocking half-salute; Harry only smiled back at him like the utter loon he was. “Your every wish is my command. Who am I, but a mere plebe, a civilian, to argue with our ensorcelled Saviour?” He turned to the door. “Do excuse me. I must scour my wardrobe for garments suitable to accompanying the great Harry Potter into public view. I'm certain the Press will be present for such an amazing excursion.”
“Well, yes,” Harry replied blankly, as if he was surprised to be even asked the question. “I’d not have said it if I wasn't, Malfoy. Um, where are you going? Because I’m not quite finished and you’ve not really said anything to the point. Like, um, you know, ‘yes’...or ‘no’?” He shrugged, blinking fast. “Well, hopefully not ‘no’, right, Malfoy?”
“Draco, do cease snorting at us,” Pansy requested calmly. “We’re not doing anything wrong, just sitting here—waiting patiently on your slow arse, might I add? It is cold and Theo is hungry and I would like revive my toes before the end of this century, though. Please keep that in mind as you ogle your Potter.”
"Cheers for him," Draco smiled at Harry's obvious pride in his friends. "And of course Rosie's grown a foot or more--"
"Oh, no, Father. Nope."
"Harry, no."  Draco's mind filled with the torrent of recollection of endless dreary days and nights, left alone; he cringed away from them. He couldn't be left again. In a dirty old alley, filled with rubbish and the odour of gone-off butterbeer, bottles discarded in bins, and
"…Harry?"
Harry laughed at him, the skin 'round his green eyes crinkling, and used that wicked, sly hand to fondle Draco's bits. Shed his spectacles, too, carelessly discarding them over the arm of the sofa.
boyfriend.”
“Ahh,” he sighed eventually, wriggling his sock clad toes on the cleared table and patting his very happily fully belly. “It’s so strange. I’ve had the real thing, you know? The actual dish, I meant. When I was abroad. But somehow I still missed our version. Why is that, you think?”
—and would Headmaster Dumbledore even allow such a thing?
“Shut it,” Draco ordered, but he truly didn’t mind it—leastways, not the warming charm. That was but the work of a second.  He did so, and the bench seat fairly glowed. “Pansies. No cocoa, I am not your Elf, arsewipes.”
“Fine!” Draco snapped, and thrust the yarn aside. "Go on!" All the while Pansy’s hooked sticks clicked and clacked as she continued churning out the latest multicolored whatever. “Say your piece, then. But tell me, do you have any alcohol about this place?" He glared round at the posh but cozy surroundings of Pansy's parlour. "Because I’m in need of a fucking drink!”
“Yes?” he gritted. “Hermione?”
“Yes, Mum. I said I would, didn’t I? First thing tomorrow. But don't count on me for the races, please.”
how I'd put it." He lunged, for evidently events weren't moving along quickly enough for him. "Hah! Gotcha, Harry! Now it gets
"Yes!"
interesting.”
" That's right, that's right," Malfoy was beyond pleased; he was triumphant. "Oh. Perfect Harry. That's what I need to hear, Harry—
Two days previous he and Luna had been busy in Poland; a day prior to that, racketing about Norway. There, yes, there were always Dark Magic forces at work, attempting to wrest the power of the Elder Signs to their own petty nefarious purposes. But Nazca had generally proved smooth sailing until recently, the last real Dark flare-ups in the area having occurred more than fifty years before his and Luna’s Journeymenship.
Draco, having bagged Harry Potter, was damned proud of it, but the Brown bint was a slag and a baggage and Draco was fuming. Pacing and fuming and reviewing his favoured hexes.
, if you’re so curious,” Draco sneered at her, but he kept his eyes on Potter, circling and weaving two hundred yards above the stands. “Got a good seat on him; look at that arse, gripping the stick. He’s a natural.”
"I'm sorry," he murmured to the moonless night and the empty breeze, and then a warm wind rose up beneath his flying feet, his woefully slow wings, and bore him off, thankfully. For of all things Draco required right then it was a safe place to tend his wounds. "I—I'm so sorry. Harry. I'm sorry."
Potter meanwhile completed a triple loop-de-loop, ‘round and through the smallest hoop, whooping all the while, and the Snitch was so close to being his, Draco could practically taste that, too. The Ravenclaw Seeker was reduced to simply staring, bug-eyed, from a distance.
"Harry?" Draco wanted to ask if he should pull out; if he could be doing something to make it better, but the damage was done and he could only watch Potter's face as the grimace slowly faded, and his firm lips finally twitched at the corners and then parted slightly, revealing a glimpse of that pink tongue. Then there was a whole great sea of green-gold for Draco to fall into and Potter's bloodied lower lip curving into something approaching a classic Malfoy smirk.
The thought of going and coming left Harry a right oozy mess in his bits. He moaned, incapable of thanking his friend even for the sympathy.
“Mnhm.” Potter licked his lips and painstakingly turned another fragile-looking page, grunting. "Nmgh."
“Gnh. Meh.”
Harry—was under the impression he was being a friend to the snot-nosed wench! A very true-blue one, all because the little skank had had her wittle grubby heart injured by that nasty cheating Finnegan sot, and now she was bereft of male company and sorely in need of a keeper.
Harry tilted his head back and looked up at the night sky. Utterly brilliant, sparkling like a cloth solidly woven of diamonds, the occasional red or blue tinged one leaping out to the naked eye. Nothing like what he’d be able to view in, say, London. The sky above went on forever, dizzying and rendering him more than a little breathless.
In no time she'd corrected course and was flying strongly once more, her lips set in a thin determined line and her eyes fixed upon the darting figure that was Luna, leading them in an ever-larger spiral about the sky till every last sacred Line was Conserved and Protected.
. You swore it to me, I know you did. I remember—I remember every word, alright? Was as good as a vow, what you said. So—so?" Draco was struck again by the unreality of all that was being said between them. Appalled, more like. This couldn't be happening; he'd wake up any moment…wouldn't he? "Er—ah? What exactly even happened? Because it can't have changed that fast—you can't
“Buggers,” Draco murmured, sparing them a sideways glance. “Bloody non-believers! Philistines!”
Draco snorted and took hasty refuge in his wine, gulping down a mouthful so to avoid answering. Hermione was correct in her educated guess--he wouldn’t mind a steady partner and maybe even some children, one day--but decent relationships didn't fall off trees and all the good ones, the Wizards Draco would even consider as possible partners, were essentially taken. Even Theo, finally. Besides, it wasn't as though he really needed to have someone else in his life, no matter what the Manor had to say about it.
They say Wizarding houses have feelings. They say they’re semi-sentient. They
Harry, in marked contrast to his former flat-mate, was clean and well dressed and smelt very good. And he was deathly calm now that he wasn't giggling like a mean schoolgirl up his damned sleeve.
"What?" Draco elevated his chin abruptly, twisting in his chair, attempting to re-engage his ex-lover's gaze. "Blaise? Me, cry on his shoulder? What the hell are you talking about, Harry? Blasé doesn't even come into this, except as a bloody nuisance, alright? And I'm not going anywhere, not a fucking inch. Get used to it!"
Very amusing, and quite ironic, too. Rather like discovering Snape had him polishing cauldrons nightly so that Headmistress McGonagall wouldn’t crucify their arses for shagging improperly on Hogwarts premises. Snape’s Notice-Me-Nots were industrial strength power—and hadn’t
"No, Squidhead!" Harry growled, rushing up the spiral staircase to the room the Eighth Year boys shared. "You've got it all wrong-way-'round, as usual!"
“Well,” Harry grinned, casting his glance covertly about the other diners. “Spain doesn’t lack for lovely people, does it? And a nice shag goes a long way to soothe away the pain, right? I’ll do, Luna. Don’t fret over me.”
. There was more than one way to tickle them.
"Harry?'
"Of course you may have it, son," his Mum went on, kindly enough. "I'll have Twimbly dig it up as soon as we're finished our tea, dear. You may take it away with you, my love, with all my good wishes, and use it wisely and well with your dear little Potter. Oh, and your blasted Father's blessing as well, sod him," Narcissa added with a decided snap before Draco could thank her. "Do convey his most sincere polite sentiments to Harry, Draco. Though I'm certain he'll suffer apoplexy when he learns, Draco dear, but what he doesn't know at the moment won't harm him, of course. Besides—I'm fairly sure he'll grow accustomed to it…after a while. A great long while. Thankfully, we rather claim that advantage, yes? It'll be literally years before he'll be available to stick his oar in, son. Thank Merlin."
? I did spend all those years believing he was a serious git. I did torment and insult him and basically act like he was a wart. I wouldn't believe him either if he tried it on me. Stands to reason."
"Oh?'
Took not much time at all, Harry's Slytherin diversionary tactics. But…
Potter never shifted under his scrutiny for an instant, but simply stood right before Draco and went on gazing down at him bright-eyed, clearly awaiting some sort of explanation.
“Urrrgh!” Ron groaned, and clutched his stomach as if it were nigh on rebelling further, in Technicolor glory. He collapsed sideways along the shared bench, effectively squishing a still yelping Seamus and thus toppling poor Neville, starting a crippling domino effect down one entire side of Gryffindor table. Yet more students were felled, with accompanying squeals and shouts.
Harry had always been a little excitable, of course--Gryffindor, what?--but he’d really settled into his skin and been far more at ease when they’d both attended Flamel. Interestingly enough, it was Harry who’d pursued the more heavily weighted academic course of Advanced Ancient Runes whilst Draco had opted for his childhood favourite, Astronomy. A lark, that, but one he truly enjoyed, and could bloody well manage in his sleep if he had to. Harry had worked hard, too, really putting his back into it. It wasn't every Runes Mage who was recruited in Fourth Year, certainly. One simply had to respect that.
“Alright?” Potter bobbed his chin, eyes bright, like a bird’s.
was the general consensus
"A 'condition'?"
"Um, neither's mine, really." Harry stared intently at the coffee shop's posters: lovely verdant images of Costa Rica, sunny climes. It was frigid in London and the sky was lowering with unshed snow. "Just a little…something."
Down the table, Seamus sputtered.
“Er? You about? May I come through?”
he noted, licking his lips) and was more versatile, too.
Now that Harry recalled, Draco had mentioned…well, he'd mentioned a very startling topic. Harry had rather blanked out on that bit, he'd been so startled.
Yes, then. Nice and casual, Draco decided. Incredibly casual, as if he’d not an ulterior motive in the world. He’d information to impart, in a non-combative manner. Truly. And he could do this, even if he and Potter had never particularly rubbed along; besides, he’d practiced for hours, before his mirror.
"If it wasn't that, then what was it? I have to
"...oh gods, yessss..." Harry hissed contrapuntally and the Weasel did indeed shut his trap right smart.
Draco flushed lightly at the accusation; couldn't control it, not whilst Harry was trailing his fingertips—his messy, untrimmed, bitten-over fingernails, scratchy and unkempt, the heathen bastard—down the sculpted planes of his bared torso. He shivered in reaction, tossing his head regally.
"Mmmm," Harry murmured sleepily, rolling over, "Draco. Have I told you I love you yet this morning?"
Harry gulped. Forgive him? Forgive him for what, precisely? Draco hadn't done a thing but mumble, froth a bit over something, shout about rings and-and leave as if the demons of Hades itself were chasing him—oh, hey!
“Give it up, Nott. He’s not listening,” Pansy nodded sagely. “He’s smitten—with Potter. Of course.”
"I'm sorry, Draco," Harry said quietly, clasping Draco's upper arm for an instant. "I wish it had been--"
"Did we?" He was chuckling as well, and it seemed as he couldn't stop. Nor did he want to. "Did we really, Draco? The exact…?"
"Tell me about it, Harry."
He breathes in, breathes out, and determinedly thinks of all the good in his life, renewing the bracing magic he’s intent upon pouring into the core of the cape-shrouded Wizard standing six or so feet away. It could be Mils or it could be an acquaintance, or perhaps an utter stranger; it makes no never mind, for this is a place without honour.
"Oi?" He turned his head to see if Potter had heard it too, his embarrassingly loud gurgle. “Hey, have you dined?” he enquired, gently elbowing his friend the lump again for good measure. “Potter!”
"No, I don't," Harry said promptly. "Wanker." He sniffed the air about Draco, pulling a face. "Huh. Smelly wanker. You reek."
!" Harry breathed, and it was a benefice, that word. As if 'you', uttered just like that, in precisely
“Ahhh!” Malfoy reared back and off Harry, clearly horrified. “No! No, Pusillanimous Potter, how dare you say so? That was a bloody low friggin’ blow! Take it back!”
"Thanks."
that. Just as he was positive beyond certain this would blow over.
“Uh-huh!” Harry gargled, sitting straight and still as he possibly could manage, and decidedly not leaning into the curve of Draco’s arm at his back as he so fervently wished to do. “Yes, those!”
had bloody well burst into a fit of messy tears, sobbing wildly and dripping snot all over Draco's imported cheese tray!
Malfoy, as I live and breathe! You bloody buggering git, where’ve you
"…No."
“Destroy you, yes,” Pansy nodded, her sharp gaze zeroing in on Draco’s anguished expression. “And Harry too, most likely. But you shan’t either of you know, darling, unless you try it.”
"Well, fuck that with a swizzle stick. We're running out of time for this blasted assignment, damn it. Needed the old bat around…for once in my life."
. He thrust his hand out blindly after, seeking Draco's thin wrist. Seeking to call them back, but too late. His mouth had run away with him; joined a fucking circus.
"Now, you see, I—" Malfoy indicated himself with a poke to his chest, "snog you, and you—" and then he poked Harry, similarly, "love every sweet second of it. Alright?'
"Oh, I am," Malfoy was all smiles; they wreathed his face and rendered him completely gorgeous. Harry, with blunt nails gently scraping the inner ring of his clenching arsehole, felt his mouth drop open in wonder. "And you're beautiful, Potter. I can't wait for this—have been wanting you for ages now, you know?"
"Oh!" Draco flapped hands at the room, giving it up as a bad job. "Never mind, will you?" He glanced around the office again, searching for any old thing as a distraction. "Ah, Potter! Meant to say, pretty posh digs, these. What is it exactly you do here again? Because this cannot be the norm for neophyte."
, Ron, if I didn’t think it, now would I? Besides, it’s right there, Ron,” Harry waved his goblet of juice in the direction of Slytherin table, causing it to slop over the sides and soak his sleeve. “It is like Lake water, Ron…take a look for yourself, git. I mean,
"Um, no, actually, Dad," Draco shook his head. "I, er, engaged in a bit of that last myself, so you can't blame Harry for
"Har--"
This is a place of death.
There was no purchase to be had; nothing to thrust against. It was freefall entirely, excepting the perpetual centrifugal spin. And that was harsh and quite sadomasochistic—and alarmingly excellent fun.
be allowed to happen. He did so want to have a bit more time in Potter's company, and it was only a day out to Hogsmeade, nothing major.
It was in the Altamira caves in Cantabria, and a little over a month into their tour that Harry spontaneously sorted the hard, nasty fact that, of all the many people he ached for, all the ones he so wished to see and to speak to, it was Draco fucking Malfoy he missed the most. In a
…The curve of the arse; well, he couldn’t manage to keep other eyes off it no matter what. No incantation, no cloak of invisibility would ever hide a Malfoy. They stuck out, like Purebred thumbs. The height and the slimness and the elegance—all that was common fodder, known fact.  There was no way those attributes of Draco’s would ever be private between them; no more so than would Harry’s eyes or Harry’s flying or Harry’s horrible hair. Too common, all of that—too much used to the public eye.
“Yes?” Harry cocked an inquisitive eyebrow. “What.”
own that height, those ranks of manly toned muscles. The sheer stone of him—the way it all flew together into someone highly desirable and heavy as a pile of boulders when sleeping.
“Gits,” Hermione shook her head at them and returned to carefully choosing her next helping of a well-balanced breakfast. “Right, don’t know you, either of you. Cheers.”
"What about the wards? And do take yourself off, please. Right now, Malfoy." Harry, it seemed, was stuck on the same old song. Not even the lyrics had changed.
house. Draco calls it the Bawdy. I think it's only just waking up again to the full possibility of housing a proper Wizarding family again, and I suppose I’m the real reason for that. Living in it properly, at long last.” He jostled Draco as he sat back against the curved wooden back of the cushioned built-in. “Which isn’t a bad thing, you know? It’s just unlikely. Me, I meant. As a dad. A proper father-figure.”
of it—"
He’d been just going along with the crowd, really. Theo and Pans; they were simply dastardly non-believers, the two of them; more caught up in ill-bred annoying gossip than the noble art of sport. Sport! Quidditch, the truest, bestest, most honoured of all Wizarding games.
"Do find yourselves a room, dears." One spry elderly matron took it upon herself to lean over her tea set and whisper in carrying tones. She sent a surreptitious glance around the crowded café. "That's the ticket. In my day, you know, we never hesitated to have a bit of fun."
"It's hopeless," Draco repeated numbly, not noticing. "What
Truth was, he’d spent a rather difficult morning coaxing the Abraxan foals through some much-needed halter training, following by an even more strenuous afternoon in the Home Farm Apiary, coaxing the famous Malfoy Bees to shift hives whilst not stinging him silly. He’d spent a large part of the wee hours the night previous tracking a lovely newly discovered nebulae and recording it on both his Magical and Muggle cameras for the greater good and further research purposes of both the Wizarding and Muggle scientific communities. Naturally, he’d rejoiced he’d so much data to submit to the journals he regularly wrote for but the the compilation promised to be mind-numbing. Truth was, he was bloody knackered, and his stupid house was not helping.
And the situation needed fixing, at least in Draco's opinion; required it, even, and to that end he was in overweening need of a ring. A ring that symbolized a union—an unbreakable, unalterable bond. A special band that would stridently proclaim Potter his, Draco felt, which was exactly how it should be. For such an object would flash on Potter's finger like a bleeding beacon and warn off every potential rival. A ring…well, it would be Draco's polite mark upon Potter's person, more even than the love bites Draco liberally scattered down the tawny palette of Potter's perfect throat, more even than the fine silver chain he'd purchased on a whim in Hogsmeade just last week and presented Potter with a blush and a whole case of Frogs—more even than the fact Draco was in constant satellite motion about Potter's person, morning, noon and night, and much to the consternation of Potter's assorted mates.
“I, uh, have been thinking and also I talked it over with Hermione and she agreed that I wasn't insane, and that yes, it was actually a decent idea,” Harry said, starting slowly enough but ending in a rush. “For both of us, really. I think we should listen to our damned houses, Malfoy. I think we should try it on, what they want. Go the whole route, get married, and have a kid. Kids, plural! I mean, I’d not just want one, I don’t think. One is so lonely, right? Malfoy? Malfoy, are you alright? You look...funny.”
“You’re not helping in the least! Control him, why don’t you?” Harry grumbled. Ron hadn’t given up on his neophyte stage career yet, the prick.
"If you must know, Potter, I've grown tired of him poaching on my territory!" Draco hissed quietly, whipping his jaw around, just to firm it in Potter's direction, two tattletale spots of scarlet blooming high up on his chiseled cheekbones. "Tell him to go get his own S.O. and I'll drop the idea entirely, alright? We can play something else."
Oh, Merlin,
Draco smiled to himself, stupidly, feeling all at once terribly fond of his Harry. A grave error, as it set his belligerent Papa off again, full steam ahead, no holds barred, no quarter given.
Draco could relate. If Harry ever left him, then so would he take leave of his bearings, even if he lived on. He wouldn't care what he got up to after, if Harry were to…die.
And Draco had replied: “Really, Potter? What, did you want to? I’m game.”
, more like. Hated it! With a passion!
"No."
That move was well beyond a Wronski! That was poetry in motion!
“Right. Yes. D-did you—did you realize that if you jerk your right wrist five degrees upward when you’re incanting Expelliarmus it’ll increase the spell’s efficacy by nearly ten percentage points?” he blurted, in a rush to spew all the words he’d memorized so carefully. Best to offer Potter a useful tip of his own, in exchange for a…a closer acquaintanceship. “I noticed you were going about it the old way in DADA and—and if you’re truly supposed to saving the world and all, Potter, from whomever else pops up to plague us all after you join the Aurors—you’ll need to keep up with the programme. I mean, it’s not as if this is anything new—this method. It’s all over the Continent; has been for ages. Scientific progress, yeah?”
first, I'd've covered the cost out of my pocket money."
He thumbed toward the front entry hall, barely visible around a freshly painted archway and a short step down a newly re-papered stretch of wall. Curled a despising lip and pushed his specs up his nose dismissively when Draco made no move to depart. And all but screamed out wordlessly how Draco was completely and totally unwanted, unwelcome, unnecessary. Draco flinched, defensive in the face of so much silent dismissal.
The sound of
"Right…right." Draco moved his gaze from the plate glass windows and stared at the small item Harry had shoved forward as he drew his own present toward him. "Surely." He never once looked, but only touched a fingertip to the loopy oversized bow. "Nice of you, to think of me."
Except that, well…Harry had no bloody idea, the fool. Blinkered git-he'd not a clue that the little bitch was actively employing every wile in her petty arsenal to lure him in: breasts like Muggle torpedos, magically enhanced faux eyelashes and that horrible, helpless little whinge she'd perfected recently—springing from the same species as the evilly tiresome squeals she'd regaled the Great Hall with in their Hogwarts days. The one that left Draco wincing and with a furious migraine pounding away at his temples.
“Now look what you’ve gone and made me do, arse!” he growled, eyes narrowed on Malfoy as the git sipped his tea, all unawares he was under a Harry-scope. “I’ve ruddy missed five minutes, Ron. Bastard.”
"Mmmm," Harry mumbled lazily, not really wanting to be roused. He was comfy, but that damned Draco wouldn't let up; he knew that. "'M'kay. Whatever. Yes."
, Harry! Ow!"
“This cannot wait a moment longer; it’s bloody driving me
But the Manor Floo didn't vouchsafe an answer, being firmly shut behind him, and all Draco was left with was a small velvet covered box and the memory of his Mum's weirdly twinkling gaze.
Besides, Draco was
Ethelred was Draco's long-eared owl, to replace the eagle owl he'd lost in the war. Ethelred was aptly named, too, being a total twit, with little to no sense of actual direction. Ethelred might or might not go where he was sent, on any given day; they both generally employed Ernestine to actually Owl something. A useless waste of feathers and good cage space, that Ethelred. But Harry loved him too, the silly sot, and so Draco kept him on, the useless thing.
"Well, Potter?" Malfoy tapped a toe at him, and then prodded Harry's elbow with same, gingerly. "Nothing to say for yourself?"
“Arsehole!”
Oh, how he despised that, being thrust into a day before he was ready for it. Being caught short and being grumpy. Being half a person because Draco had already left him, hours back. In the night.
"But, it doesn't matter, does it, Draco?" The green eyes were pleading and Draco's jaw dropped. He'd never had Potter—
Draco only smiled, tapping his chin with an idle forefinger.
Draco stiffened, an unwelcome thought striking him.
getting into this now. I've a right to a little enjoyment in my life—"
“Not really. Just that struck me, really. Odd, yeah? Dunno’ why now, but it did, so…so, erm, leave off, alright? Asking me about it? I’m allowed to notice things, Hermione. Rather should be, for Aurors. Don’t you think?”
do not.
"Oh, for Merlin's Sake, Longbottom!" Draco snorted. "Dead horse, damn it! Just cease and desist, will you, mate?"
“Merlin!” Harry stopped in his tracks, and Draco followed suit, but a step farther on. He reversed himself neatly so that he was right by Harry’s shoulder; it was their unspoken agreement that they were always far better off together. “That’s fucking insane, Malfoy! And your mum said she can’t help at all?”
," Draco grinned. "I meant your bloody bent for fucking success in all things--and your bloody humility over it!” He raised his glass in a wordless toast. “To you, Potty. Not that I’m complaining, particularly," he went on, his tone fond. “It’s rather a pleasure having mates in high places. Or posh basements, rather. Now, you said this morning you’ve been promoted yet again? Thrice? Can you at least tell me what I am to address you as, oh Great Panjandrum? And are you really, truly back in Town for good? Because--correct me if I am recalling incorrectly, do, Harry--that wasn't how it worked out the last time you told me that exact same thing--not at all! I still hold a grudge against you for that and don't you dare forget it.”
His mum smiled that calculating smile again; Draco felt a chill crawl across his nape, raising all the fine blond hairs there.
“Luna-san, I believe a Muggleborn colleague at Yamagata has contacted the Magical Attaché there, yes, but nothing much has come of it yet,” she replied, her soft voice nearly carried away by the constant steady wind. “Takahashi-san has persisted but the organization is always very busy. They barely have time to spare for us here.”
What clearly was ‘very important’ was that there were actually some ginger highlights riffling through Malfoy’s hair as the angle of the morning light altered, now that he was examining it more specifically. The combination of pale torch light and the heady golden beams pouring endlessly down upon them from the high windows and the ceiling caused the odd strand to flare a reddish-gold, like molten bronze, hither and thither about the smooth cap of Lake water-coloured strands. The effect was magnificent. Highly evocative of the prettiest scenery Harry knew of: the Lake.
Finnegan chortled into his butterbeer, so hard it came out his nose.
"I can't—you mustn't! Oh,
"Gebo:
"That thing—that position we were talking over the other day, the one that would need a decent levitation spell? And loads of room to maneuver? We go up—right? Up and then turn, like key into lock? Slot together. The Hippogriff."
“Yes! But I’m counting on you to help me, Potter. You must have learnt something useful in all those secret courses you took and couldn't tell me about. And I know Hermione’s been Owling you advice about Grimmauld Place and its troubles--at least enough to ameliorate them. Well, now’s the time to show
done with you. And—I hate you, don't forget. That's why—"
“You’re ridiculous,” Draco informed him. Because he was, really. "Too much."
It was a brilliant dichotomy.
“His shoulders have really gotten broad, have you noticed?” Harry asked Ron this on the way to Transfigurations. “For his height, I mean. Makes him look taller still, that. I think it’s his hips, too. He’s not exactly looking overfed, is he?”
Harry shifted his hips, adjusting his legs more comfortably where they rested against gingerly Draco's shoulders. Draco straddled him and leaned in so that their bellies pressed together, his lips travelling over pert nipples, raising a flush across Harry's skin as he went.
"Hardly. I'm very mature, Harry."
"Yes," Draco nodded, sighing. "We all know that--"
they'd built together, he and Harry—were the absolute
“I, ah.” Harry stopped, swallowing. The surreal pressure was vanished, his body was all returned to normal, the effects of the Veritus well and truly gone. “I care for you, very much. I do.”
would have a field day, wouldn't they?)
"Right," Harry chuckled softly; he'd almost all Draco's knotted frogs unclasped and Draco shivered a bit as the cooler evening air wafted against his sensitive nipples. "Don't think so. Mmmm, you taste so good, luv," he added, squirming 'round in Draco's lap to latch on to one perked pink nub and nipping it lightly. He sucked at bit harder and Draco shuddered happily, arching his spine with a groan. "I've missed you. All day, I've missed you."
Now, that
“Fuck!” Malfoy griped, wincing. “Slice it the fuck off, will you, Potty? We’ll see about that! Saucy little puss!”
Delightfully.
. Incorrectly, of course, but…proceeding. And
"Hush," Draco scowled over his shoulder. "I do say so and it's worth a damn good go. Come on, will you?"
"I do," she vouchsafed, tilting her chin at him. "Oh! But darling boy," she cooed. "There's no earthly need for that odd face you're making. Do cease at once, Draco. You'll wrinkle prematurely. Or perhaps the wind will go and change on you—you never know, dear."
Draco was absolutely not 'alright'; he was a million leagues removed from ‘alright’ and he was afraid it showed. No--he wanted it to show, actually. There were times when he’d really, really missed having Harry available and now he didn’t have to, finally.
"Cheeky!"
! Pince'll
"Ah? Urrr?"
"I didn't catch hide nor hair of her nor of anyone else when I was poking around." Draco cocked a cheery thumb, gesturing to the special Section-within-a-Section in Restricted that only NEWTS-level 7th and 6th Years had been provided access to. "No on up front either. All that time; must've been a half hour. I'd say you're shit out of luck, asking Pince anything. Missed the boat, Harry. Try tomorrow."
“Shut up.”
"Seventh Year's been pretty much decimated," Weasley was telling Bulstrode, loudly, "but I know a few kids from the Village who might participate—"
"Could you-I mean would you—might you even consider, ah—ah—ah?" Draco fumbled at the very start, his hands shaking as they crawled over and about the slippery velvet box, his tongue tied in a variety of knots unrecognizable to the most savvy of Wizarding Boy Scouts. "Er, Pot—um, Harry—possibly? M-Me? M-Marry?"
The room did a languidly rollicking spin about him and his gut roiled unpleasantly in reaction. He blinked hard several times at Draco, bringing his disapproving expression fully back into focus.
"But really, it's for always, Harry. How I want you. Want to shag you blind, want to hold you tight—keep you 'round me for always—ever…"
him what a Pureblood Betrothal Ceremony
“I’m going to bed and hopefully also to sleep. And if you really want to talk this through, Harry, well tomorrow’s the start of the weekend, and you technically have the free time available. I’ll be right here, in our flat. That we share. Together. So! Like I said, good night.” He bared his teeth, scowling sufficient to cow any number of Wizards lesser than bloody Potter. Potter, however, merely scowled right back at Draco. “Fine. I won't wish you good dreams then,” Draco felt compelled to add snippily. “I hope they’re all horrid, actually. Bloody oblivious wanker!”
"Yes. Arse up, berk, and bite hard on that pillow, will you? You'll be walking quite carefully for the rest of the day, when
! Please! Now! Give meeee!”
“...Tempus.”
“Stand over me on your tiny tippy-toes and menace me or something?" Malfoy didn't shut up; he kept on, wagging his finger at Harry in a reproving fashion and smirking himself. "Hah! You should have climb upon a footstool to do it! Hmm. Maybe you'll set the great huge Weaselbee of yours after after me? Or the smaller one. Ginevra's rather fierce, really. See? Terrified—just terrified, Potty-pot-pot. See how I am? I’m shaking in my loafers.”
“Hmmm,” Malfoy hesitated, hand going to stroke his dick meditatively. "Huh. This causes me to wonder now." He tilted his pointy chin at Harry and mimed pulling an invisible beard, maliciously. “Nah. I don’t know…maybe I shouldn’t. You
“I know you did, and I appreciate it,” Draco offered up after a long quiet moment. “Appreciated it then too, even if I never said it.” He shook his head, not caring particularly that his hair flopped into his eyes, tangling in his eyelashes. He blinked it out, shaking his head slightly. “‘M’not so good with asking for help, Potter, but at least with you, I don't have to. You're always there for me, even when I’m not sure where you actually are, you know? And I--I’m there for you too; goes without even saying.”
"Wa-wait!"
? Merlin!”
“Arsehole!” Harry snarled, introspective mood completely fled for the morning. He scowled and all the platters and dishes trembled. Lavender squeaked in fear. “Shut your damned gob and sit your arse down, Ron! Right now! This is entirely uncalled for. You will pay for this, git! I’ll make damned sure of it!”
“I’ll bloody kill you, Blaise, I swear it,” he hissed. “And whichever one of you collective pack-of-arses put you up to it! It was Weasley, wasn’t it? You and bloody George never should have been re-introduced!”
Draco grinned. Slyly, goofily—like the veriest ninny. Instead of answering, he scooted his plain brown study carrel chair over so abruptly that Harry was practically tipped arse over teakettle into his waiting lap, so closely were they aligned down the one side. Harry allowed it, naturally, as the Library was deathly quiet—no Hufflegiggles in sight. Merlin, he even let go of all the residual tension that had lingered long along the line of his shoulders, tucking himself neatly by Draco's ribcage with a tiny sigh.
"Draco." So sensible, so sane. Harry so matter-of-fact, as if there was no other way. As if it were inevitable, that horrible day. Which was mad, completely, and Draco's head was spinning with how very mad it all was. "
He—well, Malfoy was once again taking Magical Creatures, which he'd not done in years; likely aiming for an easy NEWT, and thus he, Harry would be subjected to yet more wild-arse crazy Malfoy pheromones in the morning, straight after their shared Potions lecture. A double dose, then, with barely any time to recuperate before they trotted off to Transfigurations for an extended afternoon lecture. Throw Sinestra's required Astronomy practicum in the evening into the mix and Harry wagered he'd end up far closer to death via prolonged over-exposure to Malfoyshness than he'd ever been, back in the good old uncomplicated days of dodging absurdly powerful, completely mental, megalomaniac Wizards.
can--and do." He turned pleading eyes to his best mate. "So, anything to give us on that front, Hermione? Thoughts? Suggestions? Solutions? Since it’s both of us now and it's crystal we're a bit fucked, currently.”
“No,” Harry shook his head. His interest in Malfoy’s person was nothing new, actually. He’d always been interested in Malfoy’s person, one way or another. Malfoy’s intentions, certainly. Malfoy’s height (superior to his own and thus very irritating); Malfoy’s arse (in contact with a broomstick during Quidditch, only!); Malfoy’s fists…
"Oh! Merlin! You alright, mate?"
She tilted her chin, cogitating, and then nodded firmly.
He'd not mucked it up then; there was a warm glow within him that could light up any glowering damp city skies that could keep him toasty through any length of boring meetings to come.
"I am, I am; hold your frickin' thestrals!"
"Hmm." Draco sneered, his eyes finding the evil awful image of Granger and Weaselbee, pumping and jumping, ruining the cushions on their own damned sofa. It galled him no end, having to see. "Right—
The implosion of mutual feeling was shocking—and they were, both boys, as never had either of them even conceived of such a thing as this! This—this laced together, locked together, planted side-by-side within the other and then shifted minutely feeling, with ribs tight with breaths they dare not breathe. Their fingers curled or flapped helplessly about, Harry's spectacles flying off to land precariously in the Muggle Cookery stacks—and both sets of lips parted on a silent scream of "Oh!"
“...Okay,” Draco sulked, subsiding into the squabs of the settee. “I’m listening. Said I was, didn't I?”
“Because I sat proxy in several of your courses--remember? I do take in things, now and again, and sometimes they even stick with me.” Draco rolled his eyes again, but fondly. “Now, look, here’s the plan. Something stupidly simple and powerful, Potter. That’s what I want you to cast. That’s what you do best, isn’t it? Oh, no, here it is!”
Without a single word said, the pall lifted. Silverware clinked; Ginny and Neville could be glimpsed toasting glasses of superior chardonnay and grinning like maniacs. The majestic maître 'd stopped his interrupted descent in their direction—no doubt he'd been thinking to toss their arses out the the door for making all that ruckus in the loo—casually settled his snowy white arm cloth and wheeled abruptly off in another direction.
That six years of hatred, jealousy, rivalry and pranking of greater or lesser degree amounted to naught but a tiny hill of candied Every-Flavour beans. No, he was absolved because he hadn't meant it, really. He hadn't clearly understood the consequences and ramifications and since he was, thankfully, still a student at Hogwarts, though only a few short weeks away from ceasing to be a minor, he could go scot-free. And it was this very boy—young man-the bloody idiot wanker git with his laughing mouth currently sliding through Draco's hair, tumbling it every which way from where Draco had arranged it, perfectly; this prat molesting him—who'd been the one to step in and halt all that needless, self-inflicted torture right in its tracks. Like flagging down the Express, on a sodding whim.
Knowing full well he'd flubbed his first fence, he fell back on to the old familiar and tried for a teasing tone. Perhaps it was too soon to broach the subject of his Manor's misbehaving. Perhaps this was a foolish venture entirely and he'd really only come to the Ministry because Potter hadn't come to him and he was indeed feeling vaguely slighted, just as his mum said? But, fuck's sake, they'd only just met again, and it had been quite a long while. It had to be far too soon for him to beg Harry's aid with his hellish Nursery. Better to delay, really. Too much too soon was a rookie mistake, a common error that could have dire consequences. As an amateur status apiarist and airborne equine trainer, Draco definitely understood that part.
And free. At last.
Arithmancy. Three plus two should equal a decent gift, right? Like jewelry. He'd taken the chance; had searched out and bought this thin platinum wristlet. Had had the shopkeeper add a tiny but very powerful charm to it and paid through the nose for the pleasure: a fine golden snitch, minute wings spread like an angel's, spelled to hum and buzz in Harry's ear if ever Draco should be in danger. It was, Harry decided, the least he could do. To keep his love safe, or at least have his back.
Draco made a fuss of yanking up his dressing gown sleeve and pinching himself a second time. The thin skin of his wrist--the unMarked arm, naturally--and in plain view. Wincing, he noted Potter's immediate sympathetic grimace with a certain degree of bitter satisfaction.
leave. I can't stand the sight of you, Malfoy. I bloody well hate you, now."
"I!" Draco exclaimed. "You!"
“Yeah,” Theo agreed. “Big deal. Fucking wow, yeah? I’m so impressed…not”
Harry nodded jerkily. "Alright. On your count."
A little splash of cold water on his face should do the trick to settle him down, Draco concluded—and mayhap a quick one-off in the loo. He’d missed his usual wank this morning, what with all that considering of tactical approaches for proper Potty-luring and he could feel it now, what with all the unseasonable, unreasonable heat.
A rubbishing friend, an insensitive lover. All that Harry said he was. All Harry's
the younger one, Pottyhead. It might be a scandal, me shagging you. P’raps I shouldn’t.”
"Gods," Draco tensed, stark-eyed and severe when he lifted his head to stare down and meet Harry's gaze full on. "You little fool.
"Fight?" Finnegan eagerly asked of no one.
Draco only shook off his feeling of vague foreboding with effort as he stepped out of the Three Broomstick's capacious hearth and made his slowly back to Hogwart's grounds. At least he had the ring in his hot little paw, though, as well as his Mum's hearty (terrifying!) approval, and he supposed that was all that mattered in the long run. He was now officially able and ready to tackle the hugely daunting task of asking Potter to bestow a lifetime of sharing upon him and that was something amazing, at least.
"But," Corner twinkled, scenting romance, "we can guess, can't we?"
was in any position to do a damn thing about it, the offspring idea. It had been close to two years since he’d had any manner of a serious relationship and none of the various Wizards he’d pulled since interested him in the slightest, not beyond a quick fuck. He had standards, didn’t he? Surely the Manor could understand standards, steeped as it was in centuries of assumed privilege? He hoped so but he wasn't sanguine, no matter what he'd said to Harry.
you propose to do it for them, Potter? Here—or over there?"
“Not so many good ones, back then,” Draco remarked, as if the years of taunting and bad blood between them had been merely a blip in their existence. “But all much better now, I daresay. Wouldn't you agree?”
He paused, telling himself it was for proper conversational emphasis, but really, it was more he needed to take stock. It wasn’t only Harry who was more than a little miserable and irate.
The Manor was just being really self-serving, Draco decided. Grimmauld Place too. Selfishly wanting the patter of little footsteps and offering no real solutions as to the actual acquisition of same.
"Draco!" Harry seemed frustrated, leaning forward with a palm cupping his one ear. "Draco, I can't hear a word you're saying, git. Stop that infernal flapping and do get your arse up off the damned floor now—come on!"
“No time, not for that,” he testily informed the unfurled scroll, wincing at all the handwritten notes Mills had scribbled helpfully along the margins. “No time a’tall. I just hope it’s a decent curry and not that shite from that new place she brought me last time. Ho! To work, Harry. It’s not going to do it on its own, now is it?”
“Oh yes,” Draco replied grimly, doing just that.
Then he couldn’t see anything at all as Ron tackled him in return and they fell straight into the steak-and-kidney pie. It was a grand mess and almost beautiful, that. Poetry in motion.
“Could be. Who's to say, though? Hermione says sometimes it happens this way; these old places have minds of their own. But getting back to our plans, I’m so glad you popped by, mate. I really have missed your pointiness. Two years is a bloody fucking long time to be completely cut off, you know? Andy said you were absolutely brilliant with Ted the entire time I was, erm, gone. Thanks for that, you know? Made all the difference to me, Draco. It was difficult enough, leaving. Worse, leaving him behind. You know?”
They were private and cosy-warm, within. Harry caught a glimpse of sizzling grey eyes as Draco gnawed his way across his throat and simultaneously pumped his hips. Harry lost track, his expression twisting into mindless glee as he was wrestled about, legs flying. A hungry snarl sounded in his ringing ears—but more in his head, or perhaps his chest.
He'd been really very rash. Hadn't he?
“Oh, Potter,” Draco sighed again, rolling over. “Look, if it’s just simple pulling it doesn't matter, does it? And that’s a start for you, at least. You might find someone you can talk Quidditch with, or travel, or something innocuous like that. You mustn’t just bury yourself away, though. Not like you’ve been. It rankles me no end when you do that. Such a waste.”
“Badges?” Hermione piped up. “Hmmm, badges…what would they even say, Ron?
"Ohhhh!" The Weasel clutched his stomach with both paws and began to rock. It was rather...pathetic. "Oh-ho-ho-ho!"
His traitorous ancestors, who were apparently in full cahoots with his damned house. It must be a conspiracy, Draco believed, as all the normal adult portraits had been mysteriously removed and replaced with versions of the same august persons, excepting painted from when they were but puling infants and tattling toddlers. Great-great-great-Uncle Gaulderoi, for instance, had one hellacious set of lungs on him and he didn't hesitate to use them when wanting his painted bottle. And Great-great-great-etcetera Auntie Angharad was forever babbling on and on about her toy knight. Perry, was it? Something like that. In any case, they all became quite unsettled whenever Draco chanced to leave the Manor and made no bones about willingly ratting him out to the Evil Nursery!
, Draco. Most importantly."
Draco laughed aloud at him, or perhaps it was only Harry's expression, and truly, Harry wasn't capable of not. He lunged, even as Draco shifted, and couldn't look away for the life of him, no matter how the other patrons were staring. Draco laughing was a smashing sight: all white teeth and nostrils flared and that rich chuckle sounding from a throat made for sucking ardent love bites on.
“It’s pretty,” Harry remarked innocently, both eyes returned to the shiny, not minding that. “The water in the Lake.
“Shrinking Scarhead!”
Secretly, and only in the privacy of his own mind, Draco admitted he was fucking terrified to even venture down into the cellars or up to the attics, for fear of what new horrors he might discover.
“No, git!” Harry protested, flapping his free hand before him and scowling. “I meant Malfoy’s. See him, up ahead? Nice and broad, there. And tall, too. Taller. Grew some more, I think, over the summer hols, the twat. Wish
He was, Draco admitted to himself in his most private moments, still reeling. With the wonder of it all, with sheer gasping awe that Harry seemed to return—no, match almost exactly!—the depth and breadth of Draco's runaway emotions. Staggered, too, by the heartfelt relief he felt, engendered by finally locating and latching onto the most important person in any young Veela's existence: his mate. His true love, his partner. For Harry Potter was exactly that and every day Draco counted himself the most fortunate of beings: Harry loved him.
Hermione ducked under the table, burrowing out of the way, pink-cheeked and gasping. All Harry could see, as he ducked and twisted, was her hand, tugging her bookstrap closer.
“That’s it!” Draco announced, jumping up. “That. Is. It,” he repeated, his voice absolutely deadly, a poison so rich as to drown out Potter’s puling noises completely. “That’s enough. We’re both knackered and you--you clearly have some issues to sort. Maybe I do too, alright? ‘M not fucking perfect and don’t I know it, okay.  But I am going to my room now, and I am going to have a decent sleep and I strongly suggest you do the exact same. So. Good fucking night.”  He spun on his socked heel, gritting his teeth, and started walking. “Hope you feel better in the morning, truly I do.”
fancy him, don’t you, Harry? I can tell! Wouldn’t be stuck on his bloody hair otherwise. Gods, Harry—it’s brilliant, this! First time you’ve fancied anyone in absolutely ages! Thought you were dead there, for a while!”
"Public!"
"Oh—oh, yes!" Draco flushed and paled instantly, wincing at his hurry. "Sorry—sorry, I wasn't thinking." His snapped his fingers and Harry's arse went from chilled and flinching to toasty-warm and almond-oiled in the blink of a Squid's One Great Eye. "Harry? I—is that alright?"
Thankfully he’d chosen not to make a further spectacle of himself  and had reverted to belting out his untuneful ditty at a marginally lower volume. He also grudgingly sat his arse back down on the bench they shared. This was perhaps out of some remaining deference for their lifelong friendship, his and Harry’s—but he didn’t stop singing, so that was doubtful.
The campaign started small, by first reprovingly installing an extremely upscale padded changing table and then shortly thereafter accelerated, via enlarging the already voluminous toys-and-books collection exponentially until an entire separate Children’s Library elbowed itself into existence, right next door to the Nursery proper.
Draco didn't quite take in what Granger would do to him if he didn't go straight off and apologize to Harry; how it would hurt, the hexes she'd throw his way. He just…couldn't quite think how to go about it, apologizing; not in a manner that guaranteed success. He wasn't so good at saying he was sorry, he knew that. And he'd his pride, once. When Harry had walked he'd still had all his pride about him, bolstering him. All his courage. Now he'd nothing, three weeks from that fucking horrible day. Tatters, maybe.
"Oh-gods!" Draco whispered. "Di-Dizzy!"
—that was Draco's latest craze. Amazing position, that…but it was damned near impossible to accomplish. Certainly couldn't be done in an alley, or a fortuitously empty school corridor, nor even an abandoned classroom. Needed plenty of free space—and heaps of cushioning lube.
Oh, bliss. Draco smiled beatifically at his inner vision, lips parted and grey eyes hazy and soft, seeing only Harry, forever and after.
"I mean."
But needs must, as they say. He would Floo Potter. Just...not yet. Potter might possibly be home again, but Potter might also be just as Draco told his mum he was: totally rushed off his feet and buried up to the neck in work, after being away for 17, 520 hours, give or take a few.
Even if it cost him.
. Did you just see what he did there? That’s well nigh impossible!” Draco replied heatedly, his eyes fixed on his long-time rival—and possibly twirling in their sockets, too, to keep up. “Bloody impossible! Don’t rightly know how manages those tight turns,” he added, more to himself than either of his mates, his expression losing its fire to slide into the knowing gaze of the true connoisseur.
!—I'm-not-quite-finished!—
” he and Luna cast together, ululating the syllables and overlaying the strengthening spell atop the
“I’m not,” snapped Draco instantly, “but--”
"Well, there's your answer, Harry," Draco murmured, rolling his head on his shoulders to crack his neck and sprawling all over his chair as it was clear no one was about to reprimand them for proper comportment. "Seemed pretty dead to me, before. And if Pruney Pince has already booked off for the evening, then logically so did all the rest, right? Stands to reason. Likely the entire floor's cleared out."
“Erm,” he mouthed, gaping, cheeks flushed with blotchy colour. “You—you’re
But not Draco Malfoy. Draco Malfoy was highly resistant. Too, he had a plan, he did, and he was very fit and healthy—his mental mirror had said so.
"Well, dear, you'll recall he didn't stay long the last time he stopped over? Most unfortunate, that." Narcissa bobbed her clefted chin in a regretful moue. "Had I known then he was to be my future son-in-law then, darling, you may be assured his welcome here at the Manor would've been very different, Draco—at least on my part. Can't speak for our poor dear departed Bella, naturally. But then Bella was never all that interested in family, either. Not your Father, either, except his own blood, nor even you, Draco…" Narcissa frowned at him for a fleeting moment.
“Alright,” Hermione nodded happily, and flicked her wand at the wine bottle. It promptly refilled their glasses and then bobbed off discreetly. “It's settled. Let’s drink to that, shall we? And tomorrow I’ll help you two with your flat search. I daresay neither of you have ever even gone through that
“Arse,” Harry muttered affectionately, “that was purely a miscalculation on my part--which you know full well--and you may address me as simply as Archmage Potter or Runes Head now--though you know I’ll have to kill you if you do it in public. We don't bruit titles about, not in DoM.”
"In fact, stay the bloody hell away from him, Dad. I know what I'm doing, thanks ever so. Better than you, at least."
"I always see you." Draco groaned pure despair to Harry's explosive 'Pah!' and gave it up for a bad job, this straining to read Harry's expression. "Oh, please. Don't you know?" He dropped his aching head fully upon Harry's collarbone, wrapping his arms tight about Harry, holding fast still when logic would've presupposed they'd move apart. He couldn't budge; he was stuck fast. "Oh, gods, I always, always…just always, Harry. Don't you know?"
"Huh." Draco made a nasal noise of disbelief. "You'll manage not to do it, Potter. Don't forget I know you very well; always skiving off when it comes to commitment. I don't trust you."
"Of course we can, Potter," Malfoy sighed gustily, dropping a stray kiss on the corner of Harry's mouth, the tip of his tongue picking up the tiny red velvet pearl of blood that welled in the centre of the lower one."What did you think I ventured all the way down here for—mere handholding? Hah!" He emitted a short, sharp bark of amusement, and Harry revelled in it: the gleam in grey eyes, the tiny curl of twitchy upper lip, thin, pink and highly snoggable.
He gave into the urge to ask, more loudly; if he did, Draco might hear and might answer to the positive side and then they’d kiss to celebrate it, long and lazily whilst Draco woke slowly and in baby-step stages, and Harry would taste him on his tongue for the remainder of the day.
“Draco, darling,” Pansy whinged beside him, “do we really have to stay through the whole thing? Really,
! Don't dare touch me, you wanker! I keep saying that to you and you don't listen, do you? Are you frigging deaf as a post as well as stupid and blind and bloody fucking selfish?"
"Yeah," Harry agreed, panting. "Me, too," and they both shut their eyes for just a quick moment—a moment.
Draco—and he was really a difficult, contrary git, even if Harry had realized he was as dependent upon Draco's many flaws and faults as he was upon his cock and his courage and the very occasional warm light that filled those expressive eyes, now and again, as they turned upon him. Now, he snapped his teeth as he twisted his head upon that pale column of neck to confront Harry, the tumbled sheaves of hair shifting across his high furrowed forehead. Regarded Harry most seriously, as if he were a stranger come stumbling into the quiet little room. Or perhaps a stray erumpent, found lurking unsuspected in a dim corner.
It was a torrent of words, and this time articulate indeed, assaulting Harry from within and without.
. Me, I mean—what you're smelling." He cocked up an eyebrow, inquisitively. "Get it? You follow?"
"That's…well, that's unconscionable, Draco!" Appalled won out. Harry glared. "I'm not doing it!"
"Mmmm…come a little closer, why don't you?" he purred, liking all of it. Draco scowled at his cheek and took a second away from stripping Harry to poke him sharply in the chest.
. Before Draco's boot tips, head tilted way back to blink up at Draco's shocked visage. Supplicant, even, and so unnecessarily so! That Harry's dark locks were darker than Hades midnight in the bright morning sunlight, that his lovely eyes to colour of a sultan's fortune in emeralds was by the wayside—an unimportant sidebar in Potter's latest scheme to stampede Draco in what he believed to be the correct direction.
Draco also nodded, wordlessly. Sighed soundlessly, eyes on the floor, shoulders slumping down and barely noticing just how sickly white was the skin of the knuckles on Weasley's punching hand, clenched so tight like that. His lips twitched wryly after a long moment, the faintest of scoffs coming out of the dark, dead space where his heart once beat so strongly in his chest.
Potter was Hogwarts’ esteemed Quidditch god, incarnate. Universally adored, even by the Ravenclaw fans. And the younger Years of all Houses weren’t afraid to show it, ‘specially the girls. Swooning and squalling over Potter, the lot of them! Even Bulstrode, seated on the other side of Nott, was roaring her approval of the Gryffindor’s senior Seeker, and Millie was not easily impressed by much of anything…unlike Draco’s seatmates, who were soulless slags, with no appreciation for this, the noblest of all Wizarding sports!
And with that cryptic
Ron only shrugged, unrepentant. “Hmmm,” he muttered, eyes fixed on Harry’s piercing scan of Slytherin. “This is verra, verra interesting, mate. Must admit I’m intrigued, yeah.”
Hermione blinked at him, slowly. What might’ve been a smile appeared slowly upon her puzzled features. Or…maybe not.
“Snog?” Draco suggested hopefully, eyes wide, brows waggling suggestively.
about this situation?" Hermione demanded. "

Draco was not at all surprised to find Harry not in his bed in the morning. Nor in the flat, either, although there was a half pot of tea left under a stasis charm and the

lover coaxed. "It was all for a good cause, admit it. Now we can go wherever we want, sit with one another whenever we wish—meals here; even Hogsmeade, come Saturday, if we care to—and
…on a string? What's that mean, Harry? What good would that do you?"
“Oh, fuck—oh fuck
“I didn’t, but I believe…there’s loads, yet.” Harry gave Malfoy an affectionately sloppy smack right on his nose, the wanker. “Loads of time yet to come, and I’ll have more of it, I shouldn’t wonder, than
“Well,” Harry said slowly, laying the book aside, and setting down his own mug, his gaze never leaving Draco’s face. “I rather wanted to talk to you. I was going to lead up to it, but I’m not so good at that, really, so I just. I just wanted to say it. Get it off my chest, so to speak. I’ve been thinking, Malfoy. Rather a lot, but especially since last night.”
"Nnnn," Harry shrugged, ignoring the edge apparent in Draco's tone handily and plopping his very nice arse across Draco's waiting thighs. He'd evidently decided Draco wasn't really all that overtly dangerous at the moment, despite his thinned lips, twitchy eyebrows and narrow-eyed glacial glare. "Maybe a bit, but…I dunno. Think it really took the stuffing out of her, what Seamus did, running away like that with Dean. Not that I blame
, Harry?"
All of these last few exciting Potter-filled hours, Draco assured himself silently as they made their way down and out of the stands, had been merely a spot of very understandable reconnaissance on his part—and solely for the overall benefit of the Slytherin Quidditch team. He’d go to his grave swearing to it—really, he would. And Nott and Pansy should realize that, the silly wankers. Just because he was Slytherin didn’t mean he was above appreciating art!
,” Draco growled, the unlooked grin of Potter’s have unsettled his innards something fierce. Damn, but those eyes were like…like none he’d ever seen.  “
thinking of marriage, believe me!"
. Pah! Even if Harry couldn't materially assist, at least there would be the blessed relief of having a comfortable rant in the company of a dear old friend.
Together.
The remainder of their side of Gryffindor breakfast was still setting themselves to rights; Harry fielded a stray glare or two when he ventured a glance beyond the still scowling Neville. All of this botheration was seriously cutting into Harry’s available Auror practice time; he felt the ominous beginnings of his hero-sized temper forming…which was all Ron’s fault. And Hermione’s, because essentially she was enabling the ginger-haired demon git.
He snapped his fingers. Immediately both a tea tray and a drinks tray appeared upon the gleaming polished surface of a nearby sideboard, the crystal and porcelain clattering gently as they settled upon a  pristine linen cloth.
marrying you, Potter," Draco insisted flatly. "Not Bonding. Never, ever, not in this lifetime. Not like that. Not."
he was. He was sometimes—and this only sometimes—a bit of shabby person.
Those Nymphs and those Satyrs, eyeing each other with lascivious interest from their hiding spots 'neath trees and vines overladen with--cough, cough--grapes, pomegranates and fecking golden apples.
“Hmm. It's better. I’ve been on my own too much, I think,” Draco explained. “At least in these last couple of years. I mean, you were gone abroad nearly as soon as you joined the Ministry, and Theo and I parted ways fairly shortly after that.  It’s sincerely a pleasure, I think, living with a friend again, sharing space with a mate. Especially someone I already know as well as I know you. Comfortable, I guess I’d say it is, in ways the Manor just isn’t.”
"Right—whatever," Harry shook his head, letting it go. "So…what'll we do, then? You know any cleaning spells, Mister Sexual Impresario of the Twentieth Century? I sure hope so, because all I know are Muggle ways."
"And now, Harry—what of now?"
It wasn't supposed to go like this.
"Um," Luna piped up, having been filled in on the rising chatter by a friendly, helpful Bones. "I'm in. Are the Fifth Years considered gaol-bait still, Draco? And what about the Profs?"
Still. Harry wishes he’d done as Mills had and poured his glass of exceptionally nice red wine down his gullet before he’d yanked on his cloak and grabbed hold of a section of the old wellie Chaz was using as a Portkey. But he hadn’t and is thus rather wistfully entirely sober, with little to do but wait for the signal from the local Mage and stare up at the stars in wonderment.
Not that
“Yes, thank you both,” Harry replied. He cleaned his own mug and handed it over promptly to his impatient assistant. “I’ll just continue to slog on through, I suppose, meanwhile.”
“Fine,” Ron pouted. He stuck a freckled hand Seamus’s way, though. “Sorry, mate. Excess of spirit; you know how it is, right?”
His wings were drooping, dragging dolefully over the scree. He was sitting Indian-fashion upon it in a scraggly unkempt mass of feathers and damp torn cloth, scraped moss and lichen staining his trousers . His face was streaked with thin silvery trails and his nose was red and runny; Draco wiped it with a swipe of his bare wrist even as Harry pounced upon him.
as he did so--and he'd yet to find a single solitary moment that seemed quite 'proper' enough to correct his disquieting feeling of missing Malfoy and simply Owl the bloody man asking for a meet-up.
"No!" He scowled up at Malfoy. "I am certainly
"Malfoy?" Draco gasped, shocked. At Day 3 they'd already been beyond 'Malfoy' and 'Potter'; why go back to that now? Didn't he deserve better? "Harry, come on-!"
gripping Muggle mystery novel he wasn't really reading sent sliding carelessly away down the slippery cushions, his particular page lost in the shuffle. "Idiot, I told you, didn't I? More trouble than she's worth, La Brown. Tell me—is she any better yet? At least ceased with that horrible endless whimpering of hers? So tiresome, that; like a kneazle in heat. Loathsome. No wonder Finnegan left her."
“Hair, huh?” he probed, testing Harry’s waters. “Watery qualities. Right…right.”
! You’re for it, arsehole! Arghhh!”
“Budge over, will you, and hand me the telly wand thingamajig, please?”
“Fine. Done…but I’ll take Saturday next—Hogsmeade weekend, remember? Tuesday’s too soon—Draco’s daft but not that daft. He’ll never sort out how to go about approaching Potter by then, much less do anything useful about it. Tuesday’s too soon.”  And that was Pansy, plotting.
After another too-long moment Draco averted his eyes, idly examining his hands where they lay clasped. They seemed oddly nervous and somewhat artificially posed so he promptly folded them neatly in his lap, uncrossing his legs and sitting forward.  The armchair was comfortable enough but
," he repeated, his voice worn thin from over-use. "Really awful, how quiet it is." He'd rubbed his forehead, ducking down his chin to avoid Harry's gaze, vaguely shamed. He'd not said this much about his feelings in years, if ever. Harry likely despised him, on top of everything else. But it made no difference; he wasn't budging. "So lonely, Harry. I'm so lonely now. I miss you. Please come back."
"No, really—forget it," he muttered, grateful not to have completed the original impulse. Or at least not to have put his thoughts into words. "S'not important." And it wasn't, nor even practical. It was just that he didn't quite know what else he was supposed to do, given the circumstances. The bloody circumstances.
walk away, Draco. Don't you dare!"
is!" Harry snorted, giving a scoffing laugh. "No worries. It's not that, trust me. Ted's alright. That lad's indestructible, thank Merlin, despite all the mischief he gets into.” He held his hands up defensively. “Look, I stopped by to see him first thing on my way home from Nor--uh, um. Er. Where I was last, working. He's fine.”
them, going at it like bloody rabbits, right after each other. If they so much as say a single word against you from now on—"
Harry blinked, narrowed his eyes, sorted the facts and brightened considerably—all in the space of five seconds.
"Um, let me think?"
"Fuck!" Harry yelped. "Easy there, Malfoy!"
"I admit that, Granger, but this is still a new twist to the crup's tails, as they say," Malfoy's eyes glittered with more enthusiasm than he normally allowed on a Friday night at about ten o'clock. "We'll team up—"
“Draco!”
“But I’m not, am I?” Harry protested, finally unclenching his fingertips from the edge of the desk. He folded his own arms across his own chest, albeit somewhat sloppily. “I’m here, safe as houses, right where I should be, alright? Now, may we please get on? We have the report yet, don’t we? To finish and turn over. Peesely’s waiting, the old trout.”
"Shut up, wanker, or I'll shut you up," Draco felt constrained to threaten the git, poking at his ribs ever so gently.
Still, it was a long moment before Harry dragged his fascinated gaze forcibly from the sparkly, wondrous substance seated at Slytherin.
He glanced swiftly and pointedly about the office.
"Oh, but--"
. Draco wrestled his way out from underneath his lover, Harry's softened cock leaving his slightly sore arse behind with a faint squishy sound.
"Wedding to be in June, right after we graduate," Harry moaned his miserable way through the dreary litany of Malfoy's soon-to-be life choices, impervious to reason. "Honeymoon in the Lesser Antilles. So it's hopeless, really," he sighed and rolled over again to hide his crumpled-up, horribly unhappy face…though he did frankly acknowledge he was fully squashed flat, feelings-wise, and likely to remain that way for some considerable time. What was the point of hiding it? "Hopeless, Hermione."
"Let me hex him, Harry!" Gin-appearing mysteriously at Harry's elbow joint—took the opportunity to poke a supporting elbow into his ribs, eyes sparkling with a frightening fierce form of minatory sisterly protectiveness. Harry shrugged it off, casually enough;
Not that Draco didn't care for children. He rather did, actually, and had an excellent relationship with his young cousin Teddy. Had had himself an excellent relationship with young Teddy’s godfather too, but that was well besides the point, given that Potter was not in the picture, as it were. And not that the Manor wasn't meant to hold a family made of up literally scads of young people--because it was, too, and especially after Draco, his mum and his mum’s professional Magical Renovators were through with it. It could contain a whole village, not that the prospect of that was especially appealing.
. I mean,
There was a sudden scrambling…or, rather, a floppy struggle. Harry extricated his tangled legs from Draco's gingerly; Draco managed to remove his manicured talons from Harry's scratched and sluggishly bleeding shoulder blade and waist.
"...Good to see you, too," Draco said faintly, hastily recalling his manners. "You're, um, certain it's alright?"
"Shut up, Foureyes. Yes,
“Meh.” Harry shrugged off Draco’s remarks. “It’ll do for the moment, which is what’s important.  Shagging is happening at Grimmauld, much to its delight, presumably. I can think up something better later. Oh, ah! Um? When is ‘later’, anyway?" Tilting his head like some demented canary, Harry blinked curiously at Draco. "How long, do you think, before we can move back to our respective homes? Hermione was saying she thought at least six months, maybe longer.” He sighed glumly, waving a hand. “P’raps even nine.”
"Um." The young man in question scowled a bit more than he smiled, peering down at Draco with a distinctly perplexed set to his dark eyebrows. He poked Draco's upper arm with a hard forefinger. "Draco, um. Are you…are you alright, mate? You look funny, git. Do come up. This is weird."
"--to marry. Did you nod just now? Yes, you did! Brilliant!
That would never fly.
They shut Draco out, those eyes, and the chin he loved to kiss was turned sharply away. Every muscle was tensed in that shorter length of body caught between Draco's form and the filthy bricks of the Leaky's rear wall, as if Harry were but a moment away from simply turning a heel into Apparate in place, no matter how cramped the space was he had was to work within, no matter how much Draco flinched at the thought of Harry dissipating like smoke when he had him nearly in hand's grasp…and then he'd bloody well do so and then Draco would be left again. Bereft again. Alone.
“One for good luck, before we go? Just a little taste, that’s all. Like this.” Draco brushed his lips meaningfully against Harry’s, the barest tip of his tongue snaking out to moisten them. He drew back his head just as quickly, smiling wryly. “It’s been a long time I’ve been waiting, alright? A damned long time, really. Eternity, feels like.”
He couldn't manage words in return, really, not real ones, said aloud, and barely thought—but
"S’alright w’me," he allowed, letting the dregs of the night's tension slip away. "Wha’ever. Just...you know. Sleep, now. No more talking.”
“Right, thanks,” Harry smiled, stifling the wince the stack invoked. “Mills, you mean that literally or figuratively? Because I am transitioning as fast I can possibly--”
The voices, stark and silent, were insistent, even contained as they were before him in the fastnesses of old scrolls and thick tomes. Harry signed himself up for the Mage level coursework with absolutely no hesitation and then bloody excelled at it, surprising not only a few of his old Hogwarts profs and his mates, but also himself with the degree of his devotion. Malfoy, however?
On impulse, Harry selected a second gem and held it out to the shopkeep. It was a starred stone, far paler blue than the rest, the colour of Luna’s tranquil gaze in a certain light. Or more of Draco’s perhaps, reflecting marine in the mottled faint light of his Will O’the Wisp Orb charm and the violet-dawn shadows, glimpsed atop the Observatory Tower at Flamel at four o’clock of a morning. Harry spent many long weary hours there, yes, keeping his mate awake with idle chatter and coming over to his 'scope to exclaim with hastily mustered enthusiasm whenever Draco seemed especially chuffed by some configuration or coordination or con-whatever. A form, made of gas balls floating about billions of miles away; meaningful to
Harry's mind contained very little of import. Three words, max. A gift from his lover.
“Merlin, no!” Harry huffed out a breath and tried his damnedest to look scandalized by the very suggestion. “I did not, and no bloody thanks for asking, Mills. Look, weren’t you in a hurry? Had something else to do--better to do, even, with your time at work?” He cast a Tempus with a quick flick. “Because it’s passing eight o’clock already, you know.”  He frowned with mock concern. “You’ll be late, probably, and then blame me for keeping you gossiping later, see if you don’t.”
“You say this,” Draco sniffed, not entirely convinced. “But I--”
Harry. Willing and snarky, snippy and guileful—bold as brass; Harry was all these things, and so very precious.
He'd been counting on Harry being in the same place. Rather. Draco had.
Harry was a damned fixer-upper, that's what. Draco knew this, as well as he knew his own three middle names. The prat positively lived to spring into action for a cause. Draco understood this, perhaps more than anyone alive could—really, how could one not? He'd been bloody saved by the arse! Along with every-bloody-else in the Wizarding world!

." Seeking a kiss, for surely a kiss would realign those bitter-thin lips into something more familiar? A Harry Draco could understand again? "Harry, stop this. Stop."
“Millie!”
may, no matter
"I still hate you, Potter," Draco grumbled. "Don't talk to me."
"Harry, he doesn't," Hermione sounded as though she was hanging onto her 'reasonable' tone of voice by the merest thread. "He's not like that at all, this year. Lay off, do."
"D'you—I mean—what if we were to—ah. Ah-hah!"
"What—what!" Harry gabbled, pink and flushed and gone dizzy. "You—aren't you—gah!—engaged or something? What're you d-doing?"
"He's not available, Mum. You know that."
—was excited as a little kid over Draco's stupid excuse to scrape up a bit of time to spend together! Draco wondered how that could be, utterly bemused, his own barely stifled enthusiasm rising, and then he hoped like Hell their little excursion
to come through! And it needs be now, please.”
"And so," Harry was saying, "You would make me a very happy man, Draco Malfoy, if you would only accept this ring I got you as a token of my strong aff—"
"Friggin' Godric!"
"Oh, come on, Malfoy. I'm sick to death of it and they just won't listen."
…And further, he’d noticed Potter was wearing his knitted Gryffindor abomination as well, even though it was against regulation to wear House scarves during games; something about safety measures, what the ends trailing after; maybe ending up caught in someone’s bristles.
. Look at those rings—right there, see? The braided ones with the stones? Which one d'you like?"
C'est incroyable! as his Grandme're would've announced in her lovely French-tinted accents. C'est magnifique! Grandfather Abraxis had been the last Malfoy to adore his helpmeet in this fashion. It was only that cruel accident claiming his wife's life that had turned him to the Dark.
. Because you've gotten nowhere with me, Draco, and you never will. I could care less."
! You can't seriously say that, Harry!" he burst out, loudly, speaking above the low-level noises emanating from the Leaky's rear door. The pub was buzzing away within, full of happy people mingling, full of people having a nice time, and it seemed so foreign at this moment, when Draco felt he was fighting for his very life, all alone and on the outside, in the cold. "I've always cared—I love—
It was perfectly all right for him to present Harry—
“What in Hades?” Dean exclaimed. “Ron!”
"Oh, la, lovie!" His Mum tinkled her signature titter—with a decided middle-aged ladylike leer tossed in for good measure; Draco shuddered grimly hearing it, his toes curling in fright. "You do wish to spoil all my fun, don't you? But very well, my dearest; I'll save all my questions for another time, when we may be leisurely over it—provided, of course, you bring your young man to visit me, Draco?" She cocked an imperious eyebrow at him. "As I'm positive the family portraits would also appreciate a gander at your Harry, son, if he's to be one of us."
"Oi! Erm, what
"Yeah?"
And Draco was shaking all of him about like milk in a churn; likely they looked utterly ridiculous, as rutting animals so often did, what with their mouths glued half-arsed together and slipping on saliva and Harry jouncing about constantly across Draco's lap with each short, sharp thrust. Likely, too, this was why Harry hadn't wanted to die—why living was important. He'd needed to find this one person—
"Whatever," his ex-lover huffed at him. "Nothing! Whatevers, Malfoy. Just go away now. Piss off. Leave me alone."
The urge to move was too strong to resist. Draco bounced up and out of the armchair and took a quick spin about it before making a business of buzzing over to the Picasso for a better look-see. He felt Potter's intensely concerned eyes burning like brands between his shoulders, and twitched uncomfortably under the intangible weight.
