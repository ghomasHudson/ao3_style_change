Harry quickly left the room, pulled his pants on there, and then made for him back inside. "Delete it!" he exclaimed.
"Mate, why did you even agree?" Ron questioned. "You should have told him to bugger off right then and there."
Strange how his insides twist for a boy that he once thought he'd loathed more than anything. Strange how the thought of him tugs at his gut, leaves him wishing he'd come back. Strange how often he thinks of him, of their time at St. Mungos, more than any of the hundreds of things that could be on his mind after a war.
Harry didn't know what he wanted, but he knew becoming an Auror wasn't it. Eventually he decided to open a book shop in the wizarding districts of London called
Harry started coming down to the drawing room in the evenings, when the violins would begin to play up. He would pretend to be reading, or painting, and just watch Draco play over the top of his book, or his easel and canvas, only half-paying attention to it.
Draco is standing so close to him, the tips of their shoes inches apart. His movements were precise, practiced. Harry can't find it in himself to stop him, stilled by the way his heart's fluttering into his gut, by how close Draco's face is to his, slightly bowed as his hands work. It feels very different from when Ron does it for him.
Then the class starts talking to each other in a loud chorus as Draco loses all their attention. He awkwardly stands there now that nobody's listening.
Harry was tracing his fingers very lightly around the shape of Draco's nose, his mouth, his eyes. Stroking his thumb over his brow.
Malfoy shrugged carelessly, but Harry caught the apprehensive flex of his throat. "I already know. You should go, Potter. Your friends must be thinking I murdered you by now."
The first time anyone tried to teach him was Ron who, bless him, spent many patient mornings in First Year trying to explain it to him, doing it for him to show him all the steps. For whatever reason, Harry's brain never quite managed to catch on to most of it. Ron left it alone only when he managed to succeed in making it into a somewhat passable imitation.
"How long?" Harry asked, brushed his fingers at his temple, pushed a lock of his hair behind his ear. Draco's hair was hanging in his face, tilted over Harry's, elbow atop Harry's chest. Harry smoothed a hand over it, brought it up to Draco's wrist.
There was nothing then. There was just the sound of night winds whipping past his ears in the silence, rustling grass and leaves and clothes and hair, and Harry thought, maybe he didn't want to know. Maybe he shouldn't have asked.
"I mean," Ron gestures vaguely at him. "I mean. Are you both going to, you know- I guess, pick up where you left off? You have feelings for him, and... and you said he didn't do that obliviation thing, right? So that has to mean…"
Luna hums. She is brushing her hands over the top of the nettles of grass. "There were times when he couldn't bring himself to use the Cruciatus Curse on me, no matter how much Bellatrix screamed at him." It still astounds him at times, how straightforward she can be, how she had a way with talking about such things so calmly. "I couldn't understand why for a long time until he told me that I reminded him of you. He'd then weeped and apologized to me."
Other times, it's only him and Luna together, having a stroll on the grounds of Hogwarts or edging around the skirts of the forests, where she teaches him wandless magic or where they sit together near a lake or a pond and create ripples in the water. Some days he  spends a fair amount of time searching for her things with her, which she claims have run off to explore the world and
And then he thinks of brilliant green eyes. He thinks of the ebony of wild, unruly curls. He thinks of glowing golden-brown skin. A faded, grey lightning scar. A quirk of a pink smile. He feels the foolishness and fragility of his own heart, the way it beats down into his gut.
It is at the Great Lake that he sees them. Potter, standing uncertainly by a tree, Ginevra taking his hand in her own, stepping a bit closer to him. Potter's eyes lift on her, brows twitching into a frown. Draco's heart is twisted ugly, on fire, and he turns around, doesn't look back.
Malfoy shifted his jaw, looking away, and then down at the hat in his hands, as if he was feeling too exposed and vulnerable and uncomfortable about it. "It's just one day," he said quietly. "You won't have me anywhere near you again after this, Potter. I promise."
Harry fell asleep somewhere around five in the morning. By the time he woke up, it was nearly twelve.
Malfoy, apparently, found some of them rather hysterical, laughing with a knuckle to the teeth of his grin.
Harry's lips quirked playfully, laying his chin on his palm. He knew Malfoy probably didn't mean it to imply having Harry here was a special occasion, but it was still hilarious to watch the man squirm.
They walked down the cobble-grey path like that, with Teddy waddling between them, his little shoes squeaking with each step. It was nice. It was nice to just be walking down a park with him, even if they didn't talk much, and then to settle down on a bench, watching him guard Teddy with an arm to his front, turned sideways to him. His other arm was resting on the back of the bench, having a mock-serious conversation with Teddy's gabbling of a story only he understood. He was telling it as if he was appalled by something, though he was only stringing together nonsensical words and noises, baby brows all furrowed and tiny fists clenched.
"It's why when I saw her walk into your compartment in the train, I was terrified of how she'd feel, seeing you there."
"I'll tell you, okay?" Malfoy said, his voice low and earnest, staring up from beneath his lashes with a quiet sort of pleaful persuasion, an expression that looked very out of place for him. Then again, Harry wasn't used to the sight of many expressions on that face, besides his typical sneer and deadpan, and nowadays, that awful, gutwrenching blank and lost one.  "I'll tell you everything. You just have to wait and be patient, Potter. It won't be long now. Can you do that?"
Draco had woken up better than he had in awhile, considerably energetic. The first thing he'd opted for, and a sign that he was feeling quite well, was that he wanted to have dinner with his mother at the Manor, for her birthday some days from now. She visited him everyday, visited him this afternoon as well, but it wasn't quite the same thing as that, and he wanted for the two of them to have a proper birthday dinner. He didn't know how long this would last, and he wanted to use it well.
He brushed ash off his shoulder. Draco stood there leaning a hand against the top of the fireplace for a moment, as if he was waiting for his feet to steady.
Malfoy smirked briefly at that, and then let it fade. "Haven't you? Hasn't everyone, after the War?"
Draco looks up at him. Harry doesn't really know what to say. But maybe Draco isn't really waiting for him to. He just takes Harry's face in with fingers to his jaw, kisses him sweetly, lingering.
Draco is telling him about where he'd gone after St. Mungos, and what had happened, though Harry felt as if he'd left something out with the way he faltered, silenced, and then continued on. In the back of his mind, Harry is still wondering what it was, if he's only imagined it.
"It's alright," Potter murmurs. His hand is tentative and light on his arm, the warmth of him grounding. "It's alright. You're alright."
"Luna?" Harry asked, surprised. Draco glanced at him, raising an eyebrow. "You and Luna are friends?"
" His face fell, flushed, but he straightened quickly as if to compensate, clearing his throat quickly as well. He was doing everything too quickly. He raised his head to look at Harry, just a bit too high. "I believe this may be related to…"
Potter doesn't move, his smile faltering, staring at her. "Oh," he finally says, trying to hold onto his expression. "Yes. I'm—I'm sure it is, Luna." He clears his throat. "Ron and Hermione can, um — can attest to that. Because… you know, Ron almost never returns at night anymore."
Harry hadn't spoken with Malfoy since the beginning of the school year. There were occasional, awkward run-ins with one another, nearly bumping into each other in the hallways, but hardly ever any proper conversation.
Harry kept them all shrunken in a box under the bed until they exploded back into their full sizes one day, crowding their room. Draco had to consistently badger him to throw them away.
, Draco thinks, droopy eyes roving up over wild raven hair—down to the slight crook at the bridge of a nose, and the lashes on cheeks, lining the edge of closed eyes, and him, swathed under dim blue lights. Potter's chest is a gentle heave of slow, steady breathing against Draco's chin, face so close their noses were brushing, his arm warm and loose around his waist. Draco's eyes burn, gritty with fatigue, locked still on the sight of his comfort.
It was his fifth painting of him. Of Draco. Here, he was simply laughing, the crescent moon dimples in his cheeks, the crinkle of his eyes.
Pansy looks down at him, bewildement at first, and then sadness, and Draco doesn't know what he looks like, just that he sounded awful. He knows her, and he knows she wants to ask him a million things about that, but he loves her for not asking anything at all. She squeezes his hand, the one still holding hers, whispering, "Oh, darling."
"I just wanted a good day," Malfoy said softly. "Just a good last day, you know? Sounded boring and lonely as fuck, the thought of spending it all alone."
They had changed into hospital gowns, thin and loose, legs covered under blankets, laid on twin beds. Malfoy was ashen, his mouth small, his brows creased. His eyes darted down at his hands, before he seemed to remember himself and straightened, all haughty composure. Narcissa had been due to return from France just two days before to be at her son's side, but an outbreak of Dragon Pox in her area had the borders closed down, restricting all travel by Portkey.
Ron lets it go, but Harry gets the feeling that it's more out of not wanting to argue than that he believes him. "So you're just worried about him?"
It was in the midst of the loud and hard applause, Harry perhaps clapping the hardest, that he glanced over at Draco, grinning like a loon, and saw the look on his face. He was clapping, but there was a strange and wistful sort of look to the hint of his smile, the tilt to his head. Harry's grin faded a little, looking at him. Draco must have noticed, a little while later, looking back at Harry quietly in the midst of the chaos, his face smoothing, brows raising in question. Harry smiled at him, in the way he did only for him, shaking his head.
"I just—don't remember. And I think I must have always teetered somewhere on the edge of it, in some way, and I never noticed when. As if I'd just woken right in the middle of having fallen for you."
The thing is that it can be so very easy. All he has to do is tell Draco, and he is his. But his feelings are muddled, difficult to decipher, and he's never tried very hard to understand these things, especially the more complicated and nuanced. He's never known how to. And he is still trying to process the idea that there's been something that has been a part of him for a long time, but he hadn't known it was until now. The way he'd thought of Oliver Wood sometimes, and Cedric Diggory. Draco Malfoy, fascinated by him half of his life.
After Quidditch practice, Ginny pulls Harry into an empty broomshed and tells him she can't be with him anymore.
Madam Aileen shifts on her folded hands, thoughtful. "Well... what we talk about here, Mister Malfoy, is something far more thorough and complex, indeed. We are talking about erasing an entire set of memories so thoroughly that not even the faintest trace of familiarity is left behind. This can involve erasing the memory of certain people as well, particularly ones that featured most in your dreams."
Harry wasn't sure what that meant, why he had stayed there for so long, if there was some other reason he had gone there, perhaps to set up or prepare something.
There, Harry's hand takes his. He breathes, not looking at him. They stay like that for a long minute, until the turmoil in his chest settles somewhat. There's a shift of Harry's hand down his wrist, fingers on his arm, trailing at the hem of his folded sleeve.
I'm sorry for the delay, guys! This has been sitting around in my docs in a pretty awful shape, so I've been struggling to edit into something worthy of satisfaction, but then I sort of gave up in the middle because I didn't know what to do with it. I came back to it just recently, and finally whipped it up into something that seems of shape.
They shared a slight, tentative smile, Draco's so light it was a mere apostrophe at the corner of his mouth. He looked warm and tempting and lovely like that, looking back down at the frypan with his shower-damp hair and still that sweet apostrophe smile. He looked like somebody Harry wanted to wrap his arms around, tuck his nose into the hinge of his jaw, kiss his neck.
He's smiling a lot, gesturing with his hands as he tells him, rapt, about the most peculiar cases he's had through his work. Every now and then, he glances over to find Draco's eyes, as if searching for his reactions. Their faces are close, but not too much so, and Draco keeps having his attention stray to the movement of his mouth. His smile. A small laugh to himself at a certain part of his story.
"You're alright," Draco said, still holding his hand, stroking back and forth over the side of his hand, grounding him. His calm and comfort. It was a while after that he said, low, "do you know, my Mind-Healer once said that, just because something is no longer on our minds doesn't always mean our bodies don't remember."
"I'm perfectly capable of helping myself," Draco cuts him off. Scorpius straightens beside him, fixing up his hair and frowning in confusion.
Harry just manages to mumble a confused, "I'll—I'll see you later," before he's turning around, walking away, leaving him there.
it anymore, I'm just— " He inhaled, and then exhaled out shakily, trying to regain composure. "I just want to sleep. I'm just so fucking tired, so sick of waking up every shitty day to my mind all fucked up and—and always being tired and alone—"
Perhaps Draco's something easier to think of than all of them, something puzzling and fascinating the way he'd always been, even if mostly infuriating once, and they'd been something there at the hospital, hadn't they been? Something greater than strangers, than old childhood rivals. Somewhat friends.
Luna leans a little close. "I think he found your wandless magic very impressive," she says, in that conspiratorial way she did at times, like there's a cryptic meaning hidden under the surface. She retreats back again, smiling at him wider.
to magically read his mind.  When Harry obviously didn't, he pressed his lips together. He opened his book, quickly again, muttering something to himself that may have been
"Will you be going back for Christmas, then? To your mum?" Harry asks him, pushes his hands into his pockets again.
Harry stood up and crossed the short distance between him and the door. He gripped the door knob and twisted, flinging it open, hiding his lower half behind the door.
Harry didn't know what to say to that. Draco's face was that of somebody calmly bracing themselves for a terrible reaction. Harry just began moving his fingers through his hair again, the side of his head. His forearm was around Draco's clammy skin, and he could feel the clear jut of a sharp hipbone. He knew the truth already, but he hadn't known if it had been a deliberate misinformation. "Why did you?" Harry asked. "Lie?"
They're learning Transfiguration now, which is much harder in wandless magic. Wands are what focuses magic in order to cast a spell. When one is only using their hands, and even moreso, their mind, it should take a greater deal of concentration and energy to focus that magic by themselves. Transfiguration takes extra effort in this case.
He didn't recognise it at first. He only connected the voice to a face when he turned, saw who it was.
The words filter in through his thoughts, the shadow of a presence coming to loom above him. Draco lifts his head, blinking, his gaze flitting upward.
Ron rubs the back of his neck, uncomfortably. "Yeah, I suppose. What she said." He clears his throat. "So what? Do you like him now or something? Isn't he still sort of a twat?"
It was easier not to before, with Potter's voice and company keeping him occupied. His chattering, drawing him back into reality, keeping him here. His silence, but the presence of him a vivid, painful awareness in the back of Draco's mind.
Who had suddenly halted still in his tracks. There was an expression of quickly growing horror on his face.
"Was it…" Harry said, the sickening burn in his chest making his voice a rough, uneven rasp. He took a second to let that settle, speak again when he sounded more controlled. He tilted his head slightly down and closer, wanting to see Draco's face. "Was it somebody you knew?"
On a day like this, he takes Draco to a deserted alcove and lets him rest under his arm and against his shoulder, quiet and tired, with their backs against the bricked walls, the Lumos of a torchlight casting them aglow. They huddle together, and Harry talks into his hairline, because he always thinks that maybe Draco finds that comforting, the way he did when Harry had sat at his bedside and talked until he was hoarse, except that it means something entirely different now.
The words of denial don't make their way out through his throat going tight, his lips parting ever so slightly, working around an answer that won't come. His heart has begun to batter harder. "It's not…I don't..."
Draco bites his lip as he glances away, and then scoffs, exasperated perhaps more at himself than anything, at his fool of a heart. He turns back and takes the plate from Potter's hand. He doesn't look at him again for fear of his transparency.
Half-way through the explanation, he was trying to demonstrate it by casting it on Harry, but his magic fizzed out, and he went quiet, his wand held still in his hand.
The golden glitter around his finger wavers and dissipates. He lowers his hand. Fitting, he supposes, that Potter should only fall for someone as good as himself.
For a second, there isn't much to do but look at each other in the distance between them — the uncertainty. Draco's face has gone very still, grey eyes cold and bare with something that can just as much be anger as it can be hurt. The shame makes Harry feel small, shrivelling up in his chest.
Draco hummed, inquisitive, head tilting a little towards him as if he hadn't registered yet what was said. "No. I was just thinking of… how much trouble we could have saved ourselves if even one of us had been brave enough to confess."
Throughout the class, Harry keeps glancing up from his cauldron, vague thoughts of stars and night skies filling up his head, of conversations in hospitals, of a warm and soft body in his arms, of robe shops and a phantom kiss and a murmur against his lips every time he finds snow-blond hair and pale profile and a glimpse of silver eyes.
"Is there no cure at all, Ezekiel?" Bill was asking. He sounded irritated, but like he was trying to keep himself controlled. "What of the previous records of such a curse?"
Here is a boy that he's wanted since forever, has had and yet not at all for another forever, and now here he is, finally,
“I’m really happy you got to have him back,” Hermione says, tentatively. “And that he’s alright now.”
, here he is, right between his hands and holding his fingers to Draco's face with a fragility as sweet and careful as the way he's kissing him.
"Hello Harry," Luna says, smiling at him. She glances at Draco, and then back to Harry. "I was just saying to Draco, isn't it nice to be sleeping next to somebody?"
In the quiet that follows after, Draco falls asleep, bathed in the dim blue lights of astronomy. The next time Harry looks over at him, his eyes have slipped shut. His chest is rising and falling to a slow, even pace, his breaths audible and steady. The sound of him being alive and here.
Pansy doesn't seem entirely convinced, and maybe after what she was there for, nothing will be enough to convince her for a long time. Maybe Harry will just have to show her, that he will be there for Draco this time. That they will face it all together.
Draco was just standing there, his face very still, controlled, his eyes unwavering past Harry. "Done then?" he asked, in a low voice, when the silence persisted after, long and hollow.
Her eyes are distant, and it's a long time when they fill again with herself. When she manages to compose herself, pull her hand away. She closes her eyes, her chest heaving, as if to put away the last of what she felt. She does not leave, even when she seems like she could use some air away from a room suffocated by the weight of what he's told her.
"Guys, it's alright," Harry pacified. He shook his head at his friends' overprotectiveness. They could be quite unreasonable at times, no matter how endearing. "You two go on."
Harry stared at Malfoy's face, his blue lips, his half-mast eyes. How sickly he looked. He looked away when he couldn't look at him any longer. The fear pulsed through him, left his throat dry and closed. What if it wasn't enough? He still didn't entirely understand how this bond worked, how complicated it was made by its basis being cemented in things as complex as emotions of all things. And what if this was all out of Harry's hands now? What if it was his fault that Malfoy
"Harry?" Everything sounded too loud, Hermione's whisper, the scuffle of Ron's footsteps as he came into view beside her, closer. He was a blur of red-hair until he placed Harry's glasses onto his face. The lights were much too bright overhead, shadowing at a side of their faces, highlighting the frizz of Hermione's hair.
Just to do something with his sweaty palms, Harry reached out and grabbed the menu. He opened it, flipped a few pages to a random one, and nearly balked at the prices.
Maybe it's his voice, the way Harry finds Draco's voice comforting on his sleepless nights. Maybe it's Harry. Just Harry. Something about that thought makes his heart hurt.
Draco shook his head, and his face twisted painfully into the side of Harry's throat, soaked cold and wet. "I don't want to. I have to do this. I can't—I can't
More than anything, it's a jar that he's put away somewhere into the deepest corners of a shelf, simply because he doesn't know what to do with it. He knows it's there, but that's all there is to it.
Sometimes he catches Hermione eying Draco some way, whenever he, Luna and Neville join them at the pub. If Harry wasn't painfully aware of him before, he certainly is now, of the heat of him, the little space between them, of the brush of their arms and knees under the table. Maybe they sit too close, or Harry looks at Draco too much, smiling, his attention lingering on the sight of Draco's, or just on the sight of his face. Harry makes a conscious effort to do a lot less of that.
What Hermione had to say was, there were thousands and thousands of types of bonds. Some bonds could be surgically untangled and broken. Others were much more complicated. Some were dark, others were not. Some had symptoms, others not. Some were driven by lust and sex, others by mere proximity and physical contact, and by far the most complicated, were those that were rooted in emotions.
Draco laughs, derisive, and stands up. He hates that he isn't wrong, that he was able to read that at all. He rubs his hands down his face, his back to Harry, trying to gain some composure. He turns only when he thinks he can speak again, and when he does, his voice wavers only slightly, "And is that so bad? Is that so fucking bad after — after
"He loves you," Hermione told him, grabbing his hand on the countertop, meeting his eyes sternly. "Bill
It was an outdoor, autumn wedding, dry red leaves by trees and a cool breeze that played up Hermione's veil and dress full of pretty, silver embroidery, Ron's heavily decorated robes over a formal suit. It was as beautiful as the two of them were.
Potter's throat shifts, and he looks like he's trying to reign in his anger, not say something unkind.
Instead they had several more fights after, mostly regarding the alteration, one uglier than the other. One of them had Malfoy sardonically quipping how Harry must have really enjoyed nearly dying through school to have taken such a grand risk now. Another had ended in Harry shouting, "
"I think he wanted…" Harry said, hoarse. "He just wanted things to stay the same. And maybe he wanted to… save you from…"
The shards of sunlight drew over him, pouring through translucent white curtains, all over him. A feeling stirred in Harry's chest, a sort of ebb, a swell that blew out as quick as it came.
For a while, there was nothing said, and then, "Like what?" Draco scoffed, a small movement in his chest. "What can we even do with this damned curse on us?"
'You can say. Um… our… wedding…was not very…" Harry searched for a word. He cleared his throat. There was a lot packed into that, that he obviously couldn't say. "conventional. Or… or nice, really. So I just… I don't want us to stay stuck in that, you know? I want him to have something good to replace that with, and to make up for it. And I can tell he wants… he wanted more. So did I. Can't be a wedding now, but maybe a proper proposal, at least, and a reception party."
Then, something breaks into his face, a ripple of emotion, and then a wave through him. He laughs, nearly a silent breath, tremulous. He crosses the inch between them quick, kisses him hard, and Draco loves him better like this: real, and true, honestly wanting him back. Not the snatched love of a falsified dream, nobody truly there behind that perfect, empty deity.
"Frankly, it's not something within my specialty. Mind-Healers of a higher level would be more suited to help you with this, but there's no reason why you can't still talk to me about it."
"Maybe," Draco says, in a tone that sounded like a shrug. "But I couldn't make myself mean anything to anybody outside of them. Understandably. I was not, ah, a very—likeable—person. I was entertaining, yes, but not somebody anyone could give much of a damn about. This is only to say—" He clears his throat, obviously uncomfortable. "It's only to say that one would have to be a certain sort of person to mean the way you do to them—" He pauses. He pauses for a very long time, until Harry isn't sure he'll say anything more. And then, lower, with an indiscernible sort of huff, "and you...well, how can anyone not..."
feel whatever this sick curse wants me to feel and I want you out of my life already!" He breathed, heavy and hard after his outburst, the confusion at his core tangling him up further. Nothing he said made him feel better, or felt like the reason why he was angry right now. It drained out of him. His chest heaved, slow, and he swayed slightly on his feet. The world looked surreal, too bright. He was left with something that only made him feel weak and tired, croaking, "I don't want you."
"I'm sorry." Harry's voice shook. He swallowed once, and twice, and didn't let himself cry into his hair, holding him close. When the illness and pain abated and Draco fell asleep, Harry carried him back to the bed, and went out the room, into the bathroom where he closed himself inside. He sat alone against the door for a very long time, a blurry and distant stare fixated beside a white bulb light.
Harry had woken up not knowing why, only felt the tinge of something empty and going against habituation in his arms, and then something uneasy. A faint wave of magic. The space beside him was empty.
"It's not my fault that some idiot misconstrued what I was saying," Harry mumbled instead, looking away. It sounded weak, even as stubborn pride kept him from apologising.
It was as Draco was turning, as if with effort to break himself away, that it crept in  — the sickeningly fierce urge to stop time where they stood, Draco losing himself in paintings, Harry losing himself in him.
Still, he had to come down at some point, when his body began to grow too sore and stiff from being in the same position half the day. Ron and Hermione were sitting in his kitchen, talking softly amongst themselves, quieting upon seeing Harry in the kitchen.
Malfoy's last day in this country, in the place he grew up and where laid everything he had ever known, and he spent it with Harry of all people. Why?
He’s looking at Draco’s face, thoughtful as he tastes around the food. “It’s good,” Draco says, and reaches for more.
Better, however, did not necessarily mean good, and certainly not enough for Harry to believe that the Malfoy name should ever regain any sort of status or power ever again. Status and power changed people, and Malfoy was not someone Harry had enough faith in to assume he would use it well.
“How are things going with you and Draco?” Hermione asks, head against Harry’s shoulder. On her lap is Ron’s head, fully engrossed in the film they’re watching, the three of them under the drape of a large blanket.
He kept this one away from the others. He waited for it to dry, shrank it and closed it inside a box, tucked the box into the corner of a locked drawer of his wardrobe.
"You've never learned to accept nice things, have you, Harry?" She smiled slightly. "You don't have to worry. I've been saving. I'm earning quite well. And you'd make me happy if you kept it."
"Good, you didn't run away. Well, you didn't tell me what you wanted, so I brought a bit of everything, fresh out of the kitchens." Potter drops down in front of him, next to his outstretched feet. He begins to lay it out on the little space beside Draco. Two roast beef and corn sandwiches, crumpets, caramel pudding and treacle tarts. "I missed breakfast, and I'm famished, so without further ado, please, your Highness..." He waves a hand at the set-up with a brandish.
Olivia was lovely, treated Harry with utmost hospitality, care and kindness. She was telling him, in a loud voice from the kitchen, how she had met Dudley, spinning a funny story out of how she'd given him a piece of her mind for spilling coffee on her. They'd married young, at nineteen, when she got pregnant with Emelie. Dudley was overly kind too, in a nearly anxious sort of way. At some point, Vernon had come up. He'd died of a heart attack two years ago. Petunia was seemingly fine with Emelie, not entirely amicable and open with Olivia, distant and tense for the most part.
Harry's face softens and he smiles. "Bye Scorp," he says, waving back with his hand full of car keys.
His jaw shifted, his tongue between his teeth. He was still not looking up at the camera properly, like he could already feel Harry's eyes on him through the screen, even whilst Harry had been asleep behind him at that very moment.
He didn't want to think about it, had been trying not to, what would happen, when there would be no wireless playing in the mornings, and no violins in the evenings, and nobody on the right side of the bed — the thought of Draco —
Draco traces his eyebrow, the space under his eye that has gone tight with his breathlessly desperate shame and distress. It is a silent forgiveness. It seems to soothe Harry, the furrow at his brows relaxing minutely.
Ron blinks. "Oh. Er. Sorry, just...never thought I'd see this day. You and Malfoy being chummy." He heaves a slow, long sigh, mumbles under his breath, "Still better than you hiding a secret girl while you're dating my sister, I guess."
For a moment, there was nothing, but for a tilt of his head. He seemed very lost in his own thoughts.
He had listened to him go off on tangents about fucking Hitler trying to get to the top of the Eiffel Tower and the elevator cables being cut down by the French and all he could think was,
"You humiliated me," Malfoy said, low, a curl of his mouth that Harry wasn't sure was a snarl or distress or both.
Harry took the camera off his hands and put it aside on the night table. He pulled him on top of himself and close to his chest and kissed him gently on the lips.
Draco led him over to the couch, sat him down there before he left and came back with a glass of water, kneeling down at Harry's feet as he handed it to him.
The Healer's knowledge regarding curses was limited, however. Now that the curse-breakers were here, they would be giving further explanations once they were all at Malfoy Manor, which was where they would all be heading tomorrow, because Draco Malfoy was an "affected party" and "primary source"
Ronald, Ginevra and Granger are calling out for Potter, beckoning him over. Ronald pauses and squints oddly when he catches sight of him, turning to Granger. Longbottom's jogging over to them, leaving Thomas and Finnigan behind.
Malfoy looked away, clearing his throat uncomfortably. His lips were pursed. He was watching the other patrons.
for it, and others afraid to even look at him wrong, from what Dean's told me. And I mean… yeah, you know. You did sort of go barmy on Smith."
"Since...you know." Since the whole thing with Malfoy started, and the papers were just filled with a lot of bollocks, a lot of bollock opinions, a lot of bollock advice and bollock conspiracy theories
Luna jumps up from her seat when her eyes catch Draco, sliding through people and over to him. She is seemingly insistent on calling him over to their group, despite his protests, and then she swirls a thread of magic around his hand, smiling woozily, pulling at him. He's still protesting, annoyed, but his words die out right when he sees Harry, flicks to somewhere beside him. Quieter, to Luna, he says, "I have homework."
In the euphoric affection, after sex, Draco was tracing his fingers over Harry's lips, hair all mussy and damp with sweat. He had a smirk, all contented leisure and allure, a silver of his tongue between teeth as he followed the pad of his finger over Harry's mouth, mouthing the syllables of his own name.
So, even when Potter is lovely and beautiful, even when Potter kisses him and smiles at him and looks at him like Draco genuinely makes him happy—
She would settle against Draco's side, show him all the pictures she took of wildlife throughout the world, or just lean against his shoulder while he slept, holding his hand, either entirely silent or speaking to Harry in murmurs so as to not disturb his rest. When he was awake, she would lie against his side and tell him all about the different magical creatures she had come across, both terrestrial and aquatic.
He lurched forward, and he grabbed the other man by the face and turned it around and smushed his mouth against his in a hard, desperate kiss.
Then they had another night like this, days later. Then they had another, and another, until it started to get easier.
"You were the one with a lot more at stake, weren't you? You couldn't have said anything, because what if I rejected you, and made everything worse? Or maybe you wouldn't have been able to believe me because of how weird this bond made everything or you'd think you forced me into
"You must not have a lot of faith in them, then," Draco says, coolly. "Even after they've gone through a war with you."
Harry and Blaise get along well enough. He does not seem to hold the same protectiveness and fears that Pansy does about their relationship. When Harry asks him why, he says, very calmly, "because I'm going to hex you if you hurt him in any way, of course."
If he looks up, he will see the daylight streaming in, blazing yellow and white over the room, casting shadows beneath objects. Outside the window, there's greenery on the plains and prairies, the white of clouds, the distant grey-brown of mountains. He can see colours, but they all seem interspersed with an empty, dim grey. All his other senses seem to have faded as well, like everything has a hazy film over it that he can't reach through. Everything was so bright and vivid there, in his Dreams. It's like nothing here can ever come close.
"I was fourteen when my father caught me kissing Blaise in my bedroom, under the guise of studying. He was…I'm sure you can imagine,
The trains are halted still on the rail tracks, the smell of smoke filtering through the air. People pass by on their way to them, cutting through his vision. Potter looks up at Weasley as he says something, his smile breaking into a grin crinkling at his gaze, glancing over at Granger to share his amusement.
He was rather hoping he'd get to share with Ron, who has been paired with Dean. Maybe they could discuss switching roommates, which surely the other two parties would agree to.
Malfoy took his trembling hand in his own gently, cold palm wrapped around the back of his, and slipped the silver ring onto his second finger. He knelt upright on both his knees, hands on Harry's thighs, and kissed him hard on the cheek, nearly making him fall off his chair with the force of it.
By the time they got to Dubai, they were spending relatively less time going to many places, due to the fatigue taking Draco faster, and the headaches that were at times so severe that they left him too sensitive to noise and light. When they could, they went to the very top of the Burj Khalifa, which was so high that the small stars in the sky illusively seemed aligned at their eye-level. Below, they could just hardly see the dancing fountains, the coloured beams. All of the city stretched out ahead of them like golden and blue and white pinpoints of light, lines of blurry golden roads, the dark shapes of architecture.
Then, turning his face into Draco's hair, began to tremble with his entire body, pulling him closer with an arm and trying not to cry.
Harry shrugged. "They just didn't want to." A memory came to mind, and he snorted. "I remember… when I was about...four, maybe five... my aunt would sit beside the tub and give me all these instructions on bathing myself, right? And every time she would have to correct me, she would — I'm not joking — she would touch me like this." He poked Draco's hand with the very tips of his fingers, and his breaths trembled on a laugh. But Draco wasn't laughing, and his hand had gone still in Harry's hair. "What?"
therefore an important component of the curse. The assigned cursebreaker would go to the Malfoy Manor and, if all went well and with full cooperation, would extract a thread of magic from Malfoy's magical core. They would do the same with Harry. Results were promised sometime later in the day.
The annoyance had collected into anger by then, the alcohol in his system making him loose and a little more out of control than he already felt when sober. Harry did not know what came over him, only felt like they were making light of an awful thing, even though a corner of logic acknowledged that they didn't really know what had happened.
Draco blinks, a furrow twitching into his forehead of its own accord. He continues walking back to his dorm.
Draco's lips tighten together, showing those pin-dot dimples again. "You keep trembling like an old man. It's irritating to watch."
He glanced away, nodded. It took him a while to speak again, mouth opening, his mind hazy. "How long — how long does he have then?"
Malfoy faltered in his movements, pausing for only a moment, and then began to clink and clunk through glasses and bottles, a little more careful and pointed, as if too aware of himself. He found something, rotated the bottle to read the label, and then poured it out, his elbow flexed laterally as he measured the drink. Harry sat down, finally, hesitantly, waiting.
Draco's forehead furrows for a split second. Only a split-second. Then he catches on, halting to a still with his mouth ajar.
As he ascended the stairs, grip tight on the railing, he had the odd and terrifying sense, going by Malfoy's demeanour, that he might just deliberately take forever before he came upstairs.
He had caught Draco looking at him unfathomably at the dinner table, as if there was something he was trying to work out. Harry had smiled, said again,
In the winds is an open space for Harry to speak. Draco is there only with his presence, his solidity pressed up all against Harry, inclined into him.
It was supposed to be okay, was what he would think a long minute after she was gone, holding Draco whilst they laid on the bed sideways. He was still reeling, hearing the words echo back in his head from the end of this very long tunnel, still trying to absorb what wasn't sinking in. The only thing that made it any real was this distant, horrible fear gnawing at the pit of his stomach.
Harry dreamed in a delirius haze, falling in and out of a faint awareness of himself, of a feather-light brush over his hand, upturned on something soft
There is too much wrong with all of this, too much that Potter doesn't know, too much he will never understand and feel the way Draco feels for him, and he is Potter. He is not Harry.
"I'm not—very good with pain," he whispered, terrified. His breath hitched. Harry moved his hands up and down his hair, the nape of his neck, his spine.
And then Ron reached into his pocket and took out a box himself, breaking into a shaky laugh as he held it up, still half-shocked. And the room broke into a laugh right along with him, a raucous full of applause and whoops from several people, Harry grinning so hard his cheeks hurt.
Silence came over them, long and uneasy, fear and uncertainty coiled up in a corner of the room, and they were all looking away, trying not to acknowledge it.
Draco thinks. His chest is rising and falling a little too fast, air not quite reaching his lungs. His hands are beginning to tremble around the arm of the chair.
Harry laughs, pushing his arms quickly through the sleeves as Draco went off to grab his scarf. "It might help to have a snooty, bossy boyfriend around to wake me up on time."
Harry wanted him to have been with somebody he loved, but he wanted Draco to have loved him. He wanted Draco to have been married to the right person, but he wanted to have been that right person for him, and he wondered if it was this that Draco was so sad about, that it was Harry he had to have all this with—not somebody else. If he was sad that he could not have had somebody that meant more to him in these spectacular moments of adventure, somebody he would never have chosen if he had a choice. Somebody that wasn't Harry.
Harry tried to keep up with the following conversation, seeing as he was his client, and he would have to spend two hours with him the week after, but ultimately, he wasn't doing all too well, because small talk was just not his forte.
"What happened?" Draco asked him, once he'd drank it down. He took the glass from him, put it on the table behind him, taking Harry's hand when he turned back.
said something, but then he was waking up again, trying to sort through his delirious thoughts. A hazy memory of Hermione and Ron's faces came back to him. It was night, and there was nobody there but him now, in what looked like the same white-painted room, just greyed in the dark.
, and certainly not about the after, and surely neither does Potter. His lips twitch at the corners in a tentative smile. "I just reckon that's more than enough reason for us to be now."
He caught Draco's eyes, who roved them over his body with an appreciative quirk of his lips. Harry huffed out a shy grin, shaking his head.
Draco was easing himself to lie on his side. Harry put the tray of an empty plate aside on the night table, doing the same. He folded an arm around him, a hand at his spine.
way, Harry," Ron said. "Bloody Hell. He was a lot less creepy to me when he was minding his own business.
He spent Saturday cleaning up his house thoroughly, and then in the evening, he painted a piece and read a thriller novel, waiting for the violins to play up from downstairs, and then remembered there would be no violins playing up from downstairs.
"Fuck," Harry whispered, and then found himself running again, skidding at Malfoy's feet and shaking his shoulders. "Merlin, Malfoy? Malfoy!" He patted his cheek, trying to keep him awake, but Malfoy's head only lolled against the cabinet, gaze unfocused. Harry's heart was in his throat, wild and racing. He blinked hard at the floor, unable to think, not knowing what to do.
Harry leaned himself against the doorway, folding his arms over his chest. He was watching Draco bustle around in his lab, working on whatever it was he was working on these days. He never answered Harry when he asked, trying to talk to him, shamefully desperate for him to.
And maybe Harry will really lose him now. He's already lost Draco, and maybe he loses Ron now too, but he wants to say it. As if he is making up for something. As if he is, somehow, choosing Draco now by telling them all, because he realises now he should have taken that risk. He realises now that he loves him more than he is afraid of anything, but now he is gone and all he has are his letters and his drawings and a coin that won't talk back to him, and nothing ever feels right anymore.
Draco had shown up a little late. He had dressed up nicely in a burgundy suit and trousers, a black shirt. His hair had grown long enough now to be swept back from his face in a wavy half-up, half-down.
She calls for Mimi and requests for lunch. Draco surveys the interior of the vast manor as he follows after his mother, familiar and strange all at the same time, full of his father's absence and drenched in something black, suffocating, as if perhaps they'd all left their sickening energy behind in every corner of the walls. He keeps one hand in the pocket of his trousers, hidden and detached. His other hand runs over the rough wood of the stairway railing, traces over the old paint of the walls, the tips of his fingers tentative and distracted over it all.
Somehow Harry was aware and forgetting, all at the same time, of what had happened, of the truth of their bond now, and how dangerous it could be. Perhaps because it wasn't so clear to the eye. Perhaps because Harry was still reeling, trying to pull away from how everything felt like a numbed dream, trying to connect back to reality.
Breakfast goes on as usual, except that Harry feels strange and uneasy at the sight of the empty seat across the room. Somehow, in a bout of distraction, he doesn't notice a floating drop of love potion making its way to the cauldron cake in his hand. Neville points it out first, Seamus following up with a bemused clarification, both their gazes fixated and trailing as it nears Harry.
They stand there just like that, in the doorway, in the dimness of the moonlight, barely reaching them through a window across Draco's dorm. In the quiet of the sleeping all around them.
"I'm here." Draco smoothed a thumb over his brow, under his eye. "I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere."
Harry pressed his temple against her shoulder as they waited for Ron to bring over the last of the food to the table. She pressed her cheek back to his head, a soft, amused laugh against his hair. "Are you alright, Harry?"
He's taking his hand in against his, palm to palm, fingers entwined together. His other hand is warm at the middle of his back. The wireless is singing on, left on the grass. Swaying their shoulders and waist, they turn in the small steps of a dance.
Except that the rest of him hardly seems concerned. Except that the rest of him is more interested in the way Potter feels like a home that is an intangible universe away, and the way he holds his face and tries to make him laugh through his horrible, overwhelming tears, and how that rises high above his father's shame overlapping with his own.
The ending is definitely meant to say that Draco won't care, that he's fully certain of Harry's love for him and he has no doubts and it won't hurt him irrevocably the way Harry is so clearly afraid, because he has seen all the proof he needs for it (including the fact that Harry is even willing to switch places with Draco so that the curse is more redirected towards Harry instead, pretty much willing to put himself in the line of danger for him)
But then, little by little, it begins to fall away, and it becomes easy to be with him again, and Harry doesn't get sweaty hands anymore when he takes Draco's, not out of nervousness anyway. He doesn't constantly doubt himself and wonder if Draco likes what he's doing, despite Draco seeming fairly open, if moderate in his reactions — does he like it when Harry kisses him on the cheek when they're alone, trails another two down his jaw and neck when he's particularly excited to be with him? Does he like it when Harry grabs him by the waist and kisses him like he's always dreaming through classes of doing? Does he mind that Harry's hands are sweaty and hot when he holds his and that he sometimes laughs a bit too much at everything because Draco makes him nervous and warm from his chest to his face?
, let him sense the disintegration of his core underneath until he could fully string together the entirety of it. She was saying, "Mr. Potter, your husband is very ill. His core is burning out due to high levels of unstable magic — a fraction of it already has — and I'm afraid there isn't much that can be done."
"And Harry? Ginny?" Ginny nods, a squinch of her lips. Hermione turns to him. Harry pauses, wavering under her pleaful stare. "Please. Just give it a try, okay?"
no wireless rambling the day's news, or an old English song, or one of those French songs that he sometimes heard being hummed in the shower. The kitchen table was clean for the first time in months.
The glow of the light colors the room a faint yellow, the floorboard of his mother's room hard under his back. He can hear her breathing, the light sound of the currents of air moving in and out. Draco thinks she's sleeping, but it turns out soon that she isn't.
until Harry finally caved, moving to the left with a roll of his eyes and throwing the blanket over himself, just wanting to go to sleep.
strangely anxious he had been about it until he saw the familiar, snow-blonde hair and silver eyes again.
"Why..." Draco said, the word a crack. His breaths quivered in a sort of laugh, hair riding up against Harry's shoulder. He swallowed, eyes closing, as if to regain his voice to speak. "Why a heavy metal singer?"
"I don't know," Harry says, rubbing the back of his neck. "He's only been here for a day. I don't know if he still feels anything like that for me."
, named after his mother. He donated a good portion of his money to causes that would help better a post-war world, and spent much of his free time renovating 12 Grimmauld palace.
"Good food. Travel. Experience. Adventure." Every word Draco said was a step closer to Harry, and Harry kept himself very still, eyes following his face. He paused, in front of him, smirked, a flick of his eyes down, up. "Sex," he whispered. "I want it all. And if I could have had love..."
"He... he left," Neville says. He seems to be realising what's gone on, looking distressed about it. "I'm sorry, Harry. I thought he would have... he came in packing everything, not saying anything. I tried to ask him why...and I don't know, I guess he arranged for a train back to the King's Cross Station or something, which should be leaving around now..."
It's a strange thing to read — these vivid memories of a life he knew nothing of. That Draco had loved somebody forever somewhere in a place that was only real to him, and that somebody was Harry.
"You're here," Draco says, when it goes on long enough. Just to say something to him, to hear his voice come back. "You came."
Harry rolled his eyes, making to stand up. "Look, if you're not going to answer the question, I'm leaving. You're just wasting both our time here." He wasn't serious about leaving. Mostly, he was hoping to force Malfoy into spilling the truth, because for whatever reason, he was very adamant on keeping Harry here.
"I'll want somebody who's trying to be better over somebody who firmly thinks himself to be any day."
"I'm scared," Harry whispered, before he could stop himself. Draco was looking at him, a bemused furrow between his brows. 'I'm just scared of this. All of it. I'm scared that I'll… I'll fuck something up, or something would go wrong again and this damned curse would
The Manor opened to them as a vast hall full of golden lights, a chandelier in the very centre of the ceiling and bright-lit sconces beside auburn curtains. There were people everywhere, the hubbub of chorus and chatter slowing, the heads turning, as they watched the two of them walk through the room.
and now Draco Malfoy was coming over to talk to him of his own accord. His heart was starting to hammer against his chest, even though he had no clue what could have possessed Malfoy to talk to Harry and what was about to happen.
, when he points out that he doesn't need any of this, that he's only sticking around for her and Harry this year
He writes letters to Luna and his mother. He tells Pansy and Blaise about learning wandless magic with Luna, and about Hogwarts, the new developments there. About sharing a room with Neville Longbottom and his many plants. He calls Pansy a bint and Blaise a tosser when they're acting like one, mocks the sexual tension between Pansy and their neighbour. He laughs when Pansy makes faces at him, smacks him with her magazines.
That night, laid facing each other on the bed, he told Draco all of it — the way he grew up, locked away in cupboards and starving through nights for missed chores or retaliations, treated like a child slave. How it felt to be unwanted until Ron and Hermione and all his friends, who were the only family he ever had, who had given him everything without letting him feel like he had to be deserving of it.
"Yes," Malfoy said, much too blandly for a situation like this. He snapped his fingers and the lights went out.
Malfoy's eyes had opened again, heavy-lidded and so very grey. They lowered, in a slow flick, at their hands.
It's a mundane moment, like any other, when he tells him that. The only difference is that they're walking down the High Street, having come out of Honeydukes with too many bags of sweets again, and when they come upon a space between two buildings, Harry pulls him into it by the wrist and up against the facade, just because he felt like kissing him again. He's not a romantic, and he knows that, but it's very easy to brush a kiss against his mouth in that moment, whisper into it, "I'm so in love with you."
That burning throb of an urge was back again in his chest, as it had many times before throughout the day, the one that kept trying to force his hands and his body into something imprudent and unwise. If nothing else, it would certainly wipe that fucking smirk off of Malfoy's face if he gave into it.
When Harry knocks at the door of Draco's dorm one morning, it's Neville who answers. "Harry," he says, seeming a little surprised by him here. He knows who Harry usually knocks on these doors for. "Hello."
Draco kissed him, hard enough to bob his head back. His head was tilted slightly, half-lidded eyes lowered to meet Harry's.
Harry tried not to dwell on that much either, as he did with most things related to Malfoy and the curse now. He kept it locked away without a sound in his mind, locked away inside those moments, the haze of surrealism cocooned over them, in the dark, never to be acknowledged.
He talked about Cedric and Dobby and Hedwig and his beloved godfather, Sirius, and Mad-Eye and Dumbledore and Fred. All the people he lost. He talked about dying in a forest at the hands of Voldemort, and the choice he had, and how much he wanted to go.
He didn't know. He didn't know and he couldn't understand anything and somewhere under it all, he was fifteen and watching his godfather fall into a veil. He was seventeen and standing in a room full of corpses, a whisper inside his head as loud as the wails of grief echoing back, saying,
"Did you have anybody?" Harry found himself asking, after a few drinks in his system to loosen him up, a silence. After the couple was long gone. "Before all of this?"
Harry realised he was still staring at Draco's downturned hand, took it gently in his own right as it was seemingly about to retract back in a slight twitch, a curl of fingers. He lifted his head and met Draco's eyes, who was looking quite flushed and drunk, could feel all the fine skin and delicate bones in his grip.
"Honestly, Potter. Are you a wizard or what?" The inadvertently similar words reminded him of Ron and Hermione.
"Fine. You're too much drama anyway," Draco mutters, distracted, breaking into a laugh when Harry shoves at his shoulder. He then holds one up to shake it at him, putting it back in the box as he's saying, "You've kept them all since the very
"Oh," Harry said, not really sure what else to say. He was wracking his head to come up with something more interesting, but all he could say was, "Mine's blue."
"You don't talk about it with me," Potter says, softly. "I mean, I'm… I'm glad you talk about it with anybody at all. I just—" His voice fades, but in it, he threads his fingers through Draco's, pulls it under his own cheek, seeming a bit softened by drowsiness. "You know. I'm here too."
"He's found some friends," she says. "He's currently staying with them, and seeking help with their aid."
"There's no need," Harry says in a breath of a laugh, trying not to think too much about the gesture. To react like he may be thinking much about it at all underneath his words, the tone of his voice. "I'm not… you don't have to…"
, he thought to himself, but then forgot about it completely when Elias grinned, crossed the inch of distance between their mouths and caught his, hot and open and devouring.
"Ever since you came back from the Malfoys', right?" Ron asked, in a low voice. He was flushed up to his ears, his jaw clenched. "There's no way he didn't have something to do with this! You go on ahead. I'll be there in a bit."
Draco glances up briefly from his notes to look at what 'this' is. Caramel pudding. He looks back down at the pages, reading through the applications and effects of Porcupine quills, or trying to. "And how do you know that?"
things have happened with you today, but..." He drops a bag between them. "I have been taught that sweets make everything better."
Before work, Draco always fixes his tie for him, and they kiss each other in a hurry before leaving through the floo, clumsy and at the same time, and at the end of the day, Harry comes home to the love of his life, gets to hug him hello.
Harry didn't feel much on hearing the apology, or on anything right now really, and he could only take this as forgiveness, as having moved on. "Water under the bridge," he said. He'd said the same thing to Draco, but right now, he just felt numb and off-kilter.
"Three days. Mimi healed you." She had a deep frown, lining between her brows. She looks older than she is from her stressed features. "What happened to you?"
When Harry went downstairs,  Narcissa was in the kitchen, drinking her tea. It was an entirely contrasting dining table set from the ancient, gothic furniture she'd previously had in their drawing room, an elegant combination of marble-white and ember brown. He thought of Nagini and didn't have to wonder much why she might have had those thrown out, had all this moved into a different place.
Over Teddy's curls, Harry could see Ron spinning Hermione under her arm, grinning broadly, and Ginny and Luna dancing, the two of them standing very close. Ginny's hands were on the curve of Luna's back, and she seemed to be laughing a little too much as she talked to her, her freckled face flushed with delight, her eyes roving over Luna's face, whose arms were around Ginny's neck. Draco was on the couch with a drink, engrossed in conversation with Andromeda.
Inexplicably, Harry had found himself unable to relay the rest of the way the story had ended. The words had never come.
When Harry looked up, blinking his focus back into the present, he found that Draco was eying him, must have been for a while.
had in fact given him a scroll full of social rules to memorise, and he was rather overwhelmed just remembering reading through that even though he barely remembered half of it anymore.  "My husband was speaking. I'd like to listen to what he has to say."
Narcissa pauses for a moment, silent, and then says, "I want you to be somewhere I know you'll be safe. Even if it's just for a year right now."
They're all over him. He covered himself, and all of a terrible past he no longer remembered, with everything good, everything that meant something to him: the people he loved, anything he liked. There were the flowers that reminded him of his mother's name around his Dark Mark. The half-moon, after Luna, on his other arm. A snake for Blaise. Intricate patterns and designs chosen by Pansy. The constellation of Draco.
There was Draco, painted, caught mid-laugh with lines folded at his cheeks, and his eyes lit, crinkled. There was Draco, standing in the blur of golden lights of a charity gala, fairy lights in his hair, and much healthier than he looked now, in front of him. There was Draco in a burgundy tuxedo, head turned a little over a shoulder. There was Draco, in his most mundane moments, sitting in a kitchen chair, in his satin robes on the edge of a bed, in the orange firelights playing his violin. Harry was watching him take them all in, quiet. His gaze finally tore away, lowered down at the tiles on the floor, swallowing.
There isn't anything but for the stroke of a thumb over a slightly sensitive scar, and that brilliant gaze, moving down over Draco's face, back up to Draco's eyes. Potter's throat bobs.
"What do you care anyway," Harry said, anger flaring wildly, something else under that, something quite like fear. "You don't give a damn about me, and I don't give a damn about you. I don't feel a thing for you! And I'll never —
"That's not the same thing. That's just… fanaticism. Or… I don't know. They've never even met me, have they? I mean… I mean
Draco's chin quivered, lips pressing tight, firm. He blinked, rapidly, trying to look away. "I'm tired."
Harry nodded, his cheeks tight in a grin and his eyes clenched shut as he tried to control his own laughter. He bowed over slightly due to the tensing of his abdominal muscles.  "Absolutely...
Maybe it wasn't Harry that he would have wanted to have that with, and buying flowers hardly meant anything, and having them from Harry hardly meant anything, but he still passed the money over to the old lady behind the cart, and took the bouquet of flowers from her hand as he returned her smile. He looked back down at where he was pushing his wallet back into his jeans' pocket.
The ease at which she accepts this leaves him still, uncertain of how to take it. He's been thinking a lot about his father these days. He's been thinking about all the things he wouldn't like about Draco, some of those that have always been a part of him; what he's always felt for Harry Potter, the fact that he likes boys, that he has begun to renounce his father's bigoted and extremist beliefs. That some part of Draco loathes him until it makes him sick, when he looks at Luna, and the other part of him, a seven year old boy in a dream who'd learned to fly from his father, still cannot let go of what he's lost. What he's never felt like he had.
this stupid fucking sham of a marriage, to have to suffer each other in our lives and see each other all the time and
Narcissa stood. Harry's head snapped up, back straightening. From the look on his face, Harry could tell he'd been here for a while.
"I think you can say whatever you need to say with us here. Harry's going to tell us anyway," Hermione said. Malfoy's mouth twitched in annoyance.
Draco has been staring intently at his book for the last moment. He steals a quick glance with a slight movement of his head, and then cuts fully back to him upon seeing whatever look he had on his face. Annoyance seeps into his lips, tightening into a scowl. "What?"
Draco had kissed him in a life of such vividity his mind can hardly comprehend it anymore, and then here, once, in a hospital — short-lived, featherlight tentative. He knows this, in reality as well as dreams, but it's something else entirely to have Potter kissing back, wanting as well. To know, even if as a very disconnected fact, that this is real. This is nothing that he will have to wake up from.
"Yeah. And don't think we didn't notice you and your weird… whatever… with him. You were laughing over his stupid doodles in class the other day."
Malfoy had gone silent for a moment. His gaze flickered with something, an almost stunned sort of pinch, and then quick to evaporate with a blink, his face cementing. Then, slowly pressing the pads of his fingers against the tabletop, he leaned forward to meet Harry's eyes coldly, "The feeling is
they loved him, even when they showed so blatantly that they did, it seemed to dry up in a moment of loneliness and doubt, and he was left feeling like the same boy locked inside a cupboard, like he could vanish right there in the dark and nobody would ask.
As a wedding gift, Harry painted for them a portrait, Hermione in the ethereal white dress she would wear, Ron in the fancy, dark robes Draco and Ginny helped pick out. It was one of Harry's best works yet, because he spent weeks on it, paying close attention to every detail.
And he's on the verge of walking out of Harry's life forever, kissing him goodbye. He's standing in front of him by the Thestrals, coming back. And he's talking to him on magical coins, flying with him in the dead of nights on empty Quidditch fields, and he's trying to get better and be better. He's bringing him sweets and sending him ridiculous drawings in class and falling asleep under skies full of astronomy with him.
He'd been touchy ever since the war, with Hermione obviously, kissed her all the time and always seemed to have a hand on her waist or the small of her back, but also with Harry; a casual, tight hand to the nape of his neck, an arm around his shoulder blades, bicep against his when they brushed their teeth at the sink together,  as if constantly trying to remind himself that they were all still here.
and his erratic and unsteady magic, drawn from the quiver of fear in his chest, had only just helped him escape. He tells her all of this.
There's a rustle of leaves in the wind, footsteps nearing Harry. Harry sees his black oxfords first, and looks up at him just as he reaches him, a hand in his trouser pocket. His eyes follow Draco's profile as he plops down beside him, pulls his legs up into a cross of the ankles, jostling his hand out of his pocket to lean back on it. The weight around Harry's heart holds his shoulders down, keeps his head down too. Harry glances away, at his hands clasped between his lap, mumbles a greeting that he isn't sure is even heard.
He breathed, tried to turn a little, his body sore and stiff. His head hurt, strained by the effort to recount the last two years, that felt like two decades all on their own some days. He settled back against Draco's back, the warmth that was only his body's. It was strange, how comfortable he'd grown with it, how well he knew it.
It must have been somewhere through this that they landed on the conversation they did. Draco was insistent and adamant he was not one for pet names, that he was far more sophisticated than to need somebody to call him by anything other than his own name, and Harry ignored it all and began listing down whatever came to mind to see what he liked, even through Draco's protests, until he sighed, exasperated, and began to respond.
"I'm not. I won't," Harry says, quickly, sincerely. "Never again. Draco, I... I told them all, after you left. I told them about how I felt for you." He pauses, hesitating, looking down at their hands. He breathes. "I did something stupid before that. Got together with Gin, trying to move on from you. But I quickly realised how shitty it was, and she was obviously upset, and
He was trying to hurt him. He knew that was what he was doing. Harry swallowed, once, twice, closing his eyes again, until he felt like he could open them again without losing his composure.
, and he is alive, and he is beautiful, looking at Harry very still with a small line between his brows, waiting for him to speak.  He is now more bemused by his silence than impatient, by whatever it is that Harry must look like right now.
Weeks after Draco leaves Hogwarts, he gets on another train that takes him to Cardiff, Wales, where Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini have made themselves a home in the muggle world. They wanted to escape the war and all its ruin, its ugly aftermath.
The first thing he saw was bushy hair, and a blurry, frowning face over him, Hermione's. She was pushing back the hair at his temple.
Malfoy was saying that as if he expected Harry to know exactly what he was talking about, as if Harry was feeling the unease of it all the time. Xavier had explained that the faster flow of the magic between them had very similar sensations to an increased amount of magic, which was why it wasn't all too different for Harry than before. He just felt it a lot less than Malfoy did.
Malfoy hadn't been looking at him, though, and Harry found his eyes straying, quick to glance away whenever they caught sight of anything of him. When the curse settled, Malfoy pushed him back and quickly shouldered past him, out the door.
Luna hugs him too, after, and Harry sits there at breakfast with them, answers all of their questions. But mostly he finds himself quietly watching him, and the two of them, all throughout. Mostly, he finds himself noting all the little, lovely changes in him. How much more settled he's become within himself, grounded and bright and easy.
, his mother said, after the longest speechlessness. He hadn't seen her face, only heard the terrible tremor of her voice.
"It would be so in this one as well," Ezekiel finished the explanation with, pulling his coat on over his shoulders. He nodded his head in general to the room. "Good day to all." And then was gone a moment later with a tip of his hat, a farewell.
"No I haven't!" Ginny says, with a bubble of laughter in her voice. "Don't tell me you've lost him again now, Harry!"
Harry ignored the quip, not quite feeling as comfortable to banter with him as Malfoy seemed to. "Why haven't you been sleeping?"
Shame and pride, that he thought he left behind in a hospital bed and a dream and a cellar, flares in him. "Pansy..."
They entered the kitchens bustling with house-elves, and there was a table in the distant corner, already set up with various kinds of foods. Harry tried to think of what else Malfoy could have been doing here, besides getting this ready (which was weird on its own, to think Malfoy would be going to such lengths to arrange a meal with Harry of all people), but he couldn't think of anything.
"I suppose I'll be out of your life very soon," he said, quietly, repeating back his own words to him. Harry's throat went tight. He turned away, traced the rim of a container, watching his finger. He shrugged, and still quiet, "Too bad I'll be taking your magic with me." There was a slight, hollow smirk at his mouth, when he looked back up.
"Oh, I'm, uh," Harry said, gestured vaguely. "Well, I'm just taking him out for a bit, to the park nearby."
At the park, Teddy insisted on being put on his feet. Harry kept a grip around one of his small hands, and Draco took his other in order to keep him balanced, because he always got very apprehensive if Teddy ever fell down too fast and started crying. For all his jesting and speaking to Teddy like he was a little adult, he was much too careful with him, as if he didn't entirely trust himself not to hold him too hard and hurt him.
Draco smirked slightly, passed Harry the bottle. Harry drank from it. He liked the easy sharing, the almost-intimacy of it. "Alright. I'll allow you that one." He paused, drank from the bottle when Harry handed it to him. He could see Draco glancing over at him, quickly looking away. "I have heard all the stories. About you in school, I mean. The Basilisk, the graveyard and all that. You never talked much in detail about our, you know, Seventh year—"
On the other side, under a bright yellow streetlight, somebody was proposing, and the woman was laughing, on the verge of tears. Draco was watching them, all bored and idle, but there was something private in the way he slowly tore his gaze away from them after a long time, back to the water as she pulled her new fiance up into a kiss, putting the whiskey bottle they bought, off-license, to his mouth.
There is a way that he's looking back at Draco now, fixated and soft, held there the way they were in firelight. His eyes, brilliant and evergreen, and in them the thinnest sheen of the tears that had once saved his life.
Draco stills by the sound of his name in that voice, perhaps for the first time. He turns around, one step after another in the near-silent space.
"I don't think so," Harry said, softly. "I was angry back then, that it happened. Maybe I… I was mostly just absorbed in my own… you know. My own shit."
But Harry shook his head, grabbing Draco's wrist, delicate and thinner and paler with illness, putting his nose to the inside of it, and suddenly he was crying before he could stop himself, his face crumpling hot and tight.
Draco shrugs, noncomitally, but he looks pensive. Harry thinks it's because of how off-kilter his focus has been these days, like there's always something taking up all of it inside his head, and sometimes he thinks of asking, but it never feels like Draco would ever take it well—any reminder that Harry had been present during his most vulnerable state.
Draco didn't say anything. Harry didn't know what else to say. There wasn't really anything, maybe, so he just shifted off his shoulder, over onto his back, just laid there next to Draco and stared up at nothing with him, until he told Harry, quietly, that he would like to be alone. Harry stayed for a moment, with only his voice on the tip of his tongue but no words, and then he got up, off the bed, and finally left.
It took him a while to fall asleep, the guilt sinking deep in his chest, and yet, unable to bring himself to go back down and face Draco. He felt out of control, off-kilter and embarrassed. He felt angry, still, only this time it was turned inward. He tussled in his bed a bit, fell into an uneasy sleep in what must be ten minutes later.
Harry had stopped expecting an answer, and he was just on the edge of reaching a hand out for him, blindly wanting to touch him.
Draco. He's coming home, back to Wiltshire, tomorrow. He's coming to stay here with his mother through the winter holidays.
But there were also times Harry would have to floo him home from a visit to his mother, to Andromeda and Teddy, lead him back to bed. There were times Harry would have to draw all the curtains together if it was day, or close all the lights if it was night, because he had awful headaches and anything more than darkness and silence hurt him. There were times Harry would have to get him a Pepper-Up Potion, hold his weight up against his own side and keep his hand around Draco's waist. Draco's head would lean against his shoulder as he drank down the prescribed quarter with a shaky hand, the two of them sitting together on the bed.
She laughs again, watery, pushing a hand through her sweat-damp hair. "He would... he'd always be trying so hard to make me laugh. And — and he
Eventually, when Harry's boredom became greater than his lassitude, he returned to the shop and worked late hours to avoid as much as he could of his headache at home, minus the times
"The news is old at this point," Hermione said. "People have very mixed views about it, you can imagine. You can also imagine which side most of them are on."
Draco doesn't say anything, only clears his throat again, as if deeply embarrassed. There is a long silence, then, Harry looking down at the silver of sheets between his fingers, listening to the sound of winter winds outside and Ron's loud, even inhales and exhales in the room, the utter hush between him and Draco besides their soft breathing. Dwelling in the heated tenderness low in his stomach.
But this time it was about vials of daydream potions. A beautiful green-eyed boy here and in another life, that he loved too much and not enough and not at all in the right ways. This time, it was of love at its worst, going nowhere, not quite going where it should, rotting to grief.
Harry eyed him, brows furrowed. Malfoy's fingers were curled on top of the table, tucked tight into his palm. His anger was simmering under the surface, hardening his cheeks, heaving slow in his chest.
When the bout was over and he finally calmed down, Harry asked again, "What did you do?" He couldn't keep the grin out of his voice as he did at the sight of Malfoy losing it.
"I was told my entire life that one day I would marry a rich and upstanding pureblood woman," Draco said, after a while. The bottle dangled from his fingers, between his legs. His entire body seemed relaxed in some way, after the drinking. "There was always talk of a potential marriage between Pansy and I, but then… that was before everything else. Her parents wanted somebody much more reputable and clean, you see."
Another one happened in the middle of an impromptu ball party full of Narcissa's family friends, Harry forced to tag along as a precaution. He spent most of his time there drinking, bored out of his mind and letting Malfoy do all the talking. Apparently he was quite good at it when it wasn't with Harry.
"A lot of people are seeing one, you know? Ron and Hermione did too, for some time. It helped them a lot."
"That's a really long story," Harry said. His breath hitched with amusement to himself, looking out the faded reflection of himself on the window, thinking of Draco and their
Draco had gone to the Manor before they arrived, announcing that he would be back in an hour. He was never there when any of Harry's friends were around, and it was only after Hermione told him about the apology letters she, Ron and Dean had received, and showed him her own, that Harry learned it was out of respect, trying to keep himself out of the way of those he wronged.
They eat in his parents'—his mother's room because neither of them can stomach anything at the dining table anymore. Sitting on the bed together, back against the headboards, he can sense his mother's gaze on him. When he looks up at her, she smiles at him, a soft twitch of the corners of her lips. It's only then he realizes that he's forgotten to raise his own spoon to his mouth.
Harry had been downstairs making breakfast for the two of them, to be carried up to their bed. Draco had shown up in the kitchen after his shower, insisting on making tea for the two of them just to have something to do.
"It was dark magic, likely casted or caught from an infected object, and usually passed on through physical contact. The person that passes it on is the primary source
Harry didn't look at him all throughout, hands gripping tight around the sides of the chair, shoulders and arms tensed. A hot flush was spreading up his neck, his ears, his breathing unsteady. He made Malfoy let him go too early, pushing his hands off, the curse only half-satisfied at the core, and left the room without looking back.
Draco shook his head, quickly, still grinning, staring out into the distance ahead. The sun was setting, glowing golden from between the tree branches.
He couldn't see his face, his hair hanging in the way of his profile. He was kneeling on the ground, a little hunched over with his hands on his knees. It was only a second, two, and his feet were again just on the edge of moving further towards him, getting to him, thinking of touching his shoulders, his face, making sure he was okay again—
Hermione was watching the two of them with a smile, a head to Ron's shoulder, and then a small, hushed kiss to it, a moment after. Ginny was there, and so was Luna, having returned from wherever her occupation as a magical wildlife photographer had taken her. The two of them were talking by the fireplace. George was with Molly in the kitchen, helping with dinner, vegetables and jars and dishes swooping through the air around them. Andromeda had made her way over to Draco at some point, when Harry looked over again. She was talking to him with a pleasant smile, a hand patting his cheek fondly before she turned and he followed, looking a little more sure with somebody he knew.
