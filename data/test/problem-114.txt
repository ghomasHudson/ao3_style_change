Harry laughed, boisterous and beautiful as always. The windchimes rang pleasantly in Draco’s ears. “Eloquent as always, Draco.”
He knew his shutters were rising up, but he had to protect himself in case Potter’s interests were different. He couldn’t risk getting hurt again. Or humiliated, especially not in front of this man.
Harry didn’t even have the mental means to chuckle at Draco’s good-natured sarcasm because he was too fixated on the latter part of his statement.
“I dunno, maybe they were jealous,” Harry said scathingly. “Maybe my aunt wished she had magic instead of my mum. They definitely resented having to raise me.”
“You’re so damn beautiful, you’re a work of art,” Harry murmured, letting go of his wrists to ease his jacket off his body. Surrendering, Draco allowed him to remove the garment, swallowing a sob as Harry all but yanked his shirt over his head and fastened his lips around one of his pert, little nipples. He gasped, arching his back as Harry sucked on the sensitive body part.
“I’d kiss all across your neck, your collarbones, and I’d pay extra special attention to those sensitive nipples of yours. But gently, of course. And then I’d kiss all down your tummy until I reach your aching, leaking cock, and then I’d kiss all around it, teasing you, giving you what you want instead of what you need. Because I know you like to be teased, Draco, as much as you won’t admit it.”
“I love him,” Draco said quietly, looking down to his baby blue, scratchy sheets. “And I thought he loved me, too. He even told me. But then he took it back, and told me that no one could ever love me.”
Little life update: I got to read my fiction pieces at our schools Symposium for academia and the arts. It was such a cool experience, reading in front of an audience is nerve wracking but so much fun!!
Draco sighed with contentment and held onto Harry for dear life as Harry continued mercilessly fingering his reddened hole, and he choked on a sob as Harry hit a sweet spot deep inside him that had him convulsing and twisting his fists in the sheets.
When Potter’s laughter died down, he examined himself, thumbing the material of his sweatpants. “I don’t need to do wandless for these, I can just slip them right off,” he said in his stunningly casual way. So he stood up and discarded his pants.
Once Harry reached Draco’s apartment, he knocked gently. Mind stirring, he wondered how he was going to broach the subject with him. First thing was first: he was going to tell Draco that nothing had happened between him and Ginny.
“I’d get fired,” Draco tried weakly, feeling Harry’s hand snake around his waist and hold him tightly.
“Harry, you have to talk to her. She can’t just take your happiness away from you like that- that’s not her place.”
“What makes you say something’s not right?” Harry asked, worry inflating in his stomach like a balloon.
No sooner than Harry left did his nurse come in, with plump, rosy cheeks, big, round eyes, and copper skin.
“You’re insatiable, Potter,” Draco breathed, wrapping his arms around Harry’s shoulders, feeling the thick, bulging muscles. Years of Auror training had done him well.
Something in Potter’s eyes flickered, making Draco immediately regret the words. He wanted to eat them back up and swallow them whole, but before he could Potter was saying, “Oh,” and standing up, dusting off his trousers. “I see.”
“I know I screwed up, and I don’t deserve another chance with him,” said Harry, blinking the wetness out of his eyes. “But he means everything to me. And he hasn’t told me yet, but I think he feels the same way.”
Potter ate it up like candy. He smiled back, bright and jubilant, and Draco was suddenly overwhelmed by the urge to break down and tell him everything.
Ron amended, like that made it better. Harry wasn’t sure why he suddenly had so overbearing an urge to defend Draco, but he didn’t like it. Not one bit.
“Who am I to deny such a polite request?” Harry asked, pressing one more kiss on Draco’s tummy before swallowing down his hard length. He didn’t often do this for Draco, but when he did, Draco absolutely
“I know you do,” said Harry. “You’ve wanted to strip yourself bare for me for a long time, since Hogwarts, perhaps. I don’t even think you know how long.”
“Not particularly,” said Harry, wanting to look at Draco, soak him in, wondering how on earth this man could possibly love him. “I just wanted to swing by, see how you were doing.”
Frustrated, Draco wrung his lightly shaking hands together in an effort to get them to stop. “I didn’t say I’m responsible for the
“I-I’ve got to go,” Draco stammered, sitting up and fishing for his clothes scattered about on the carpet.
Harry kissed all across his chest, lips dancing down his ribs, until he reached the waistline of his trousers. He hooked his finger into the material, questioning.
only cause me pain and misery. I’m in pain and miserable right now, because my only son attempted to end his own life. But that’s not all you do, all you’re capable of. You bring me so much joy. You
“Let’s say I wanted to be a Healer,” Draco continued, barrelling through. “St. Mungo’s denies Death Eaters from being
Draco pressed kisses all around the crown of Harry’s cock, before his pink lips parted to let the member in. Draco swallowed Harry’s cock in one go, and Harry was arching off the bed, curling his toes.
Draco was suddenly overcome by the overpowering need to communicate with Potter that he was just the smallest bit nervous, that he wanted this to be okay, that he wanted to be good for him. He pulled away from Potter’s mouth, head flopping back against the pillows.
Draco, as much as he didn’t want to, slowly slid his hand away. Touching was dangerous. Touching led to other things. Touching led to-
But then he realized. St. Mungo’s wouldn’t know how to deal with Draco. Wizards didn’t take pills- they took potions. Harry would have to find a Muggle hospital.
In between the floor of the hallway and the bathroom lay Draco, face white as snow with his eyes closed.
“Good night, Draco,” Potter said, walking closer to him and pressing a soft kiss atop his forehead. It was so achingly intimate that Draco nearly trembled.
“Actually, no,” Draco answered. “I told him how I befriended a Muggle gentleman at a gay bar who helped me form my resume so I could apply to the bookshop. He was curious as to how I’d so successfully ostracized myself, you see.”
Ginny inhaled shakily, toying with a strand of her ruby red hair. “Hey, Harry. There’s something I need to tell you.”
“Right,” said Ron, though he sounded about as confident as Harry felt during his first match of Quidditch.
“I’m not letting you go that easily, not this time,” Harry said, stepping closer to Draco still. “Not after what Parkinson told me.”
“You think our time together is a waste?” asked Harry, and trust him to twist everything Draco says.
“I want to know why you came here. You said you didn’t want to leave things where they were, but since when have you cared about that?”
Harry’s eyes fluttered shut as images of Draco lying on his back, moaning and writhing and panting, blinked in his mind one by one like Muggle flipbook animation.
“Draco.” Her tone had softened, and it made him shake. He didn’t think she’d ever spoken so gently with him. “You can’t . . . It has to be for
“Not even if I spread you open and licked you until you were sobbing?” Harry purred filthily, stepping into Draco’s space and rubbing a hand up and down his arm. His sleeves did nothing to shield Draco from the heat of Harry’s touch.
Potter must have read something on his face, for he sat down across from Draco and rubbed his leg soothingly. “Hey, baby, what is it? Talk to me.”
“That’s it, beautiful,” Harry praised. His face twisted in pleasure, and Draco was right there with him; for the second time tonight, he felt pleasure curling in his abdomen, and he was close. He was so close.
“Only if it’s you,” Harry responded without missing a beat, and Draco suppressed the urge to roll his eyes, because
“I’ll have one of the house elves fetch your coat, and then you can be on your way. I am very disappointed in you, Harry.” She was cold, detached, buried beneath her Malfoy mask. Like mother, like son.
All day at the bookshop, Draco was antsy. He kept nervously glancing at the clock, knowing that soon enough he was going to be putting his heart on the line, and he’d never been more terrified in his life. The fear engulfed him, like a tsunami over an unknowing beach.
The shuttering of cameras and shouting of voices went on in the background, but all Draco could focus on were Harry’s lips on his, Harry vocalizing their relationship, Harry admitting for the world to see that he
Draco fiddled with his nimble fingers, unsure of how to talk to his friend after the way they’d left things a few days ago. But not talking was better than talking about Harry.
Pansy was the only one who knew he loved Potter. The rest of them assumed he still harbored hatred and resentment toward the green-eyed git.
“You used his first name,” Harry said, in what sounded like awe. Draco flushed deeply, then, but Harry didn’t care. He wanted to bask in this moment like a turtle in the sun.
When they got to the Weasleys, Harry was swept up in a hug by Molly, and before any words could be said, she was also sweeping up Draco in a slightly smaller hug and saying something about “putting some meat on those bones.”
at the innocent Muggleborns, the Dark Lord’s thin, red slits for eyes that bore into his very soul, his tattered Occlumency shields. How both ends of the Unforgivable ripped his heart into shreds.
Draco seemed. It was nearly unnerving. Was it genuine? Or was Draco putting on a front? He was good at that, after all.
“Harry, you need to hang in there,” said Hermione. “I know where your mind’s at right now, and you need to know this isn’t your fault. What Malfoy’s going through is much larger than what you said to him, and he’s really sick. He might have-”
However, when they landed on Draco, they lost a touch of their sparkle. Just a touch, but it was enough to make Draco droop like a dehydrated flower.
“Before anything else can happen, you and my mother need to make up,” said Draco. Upon Harry’s serious look, he tacked on another sentence. “I’ll go with you, of course. I’d never make you face her anger alone. Not again, anyway, but I really can’t be held accountable for the first time.”
“We all do,” Potter answered, tone soft as a quilt. “But you especially have demonstrated tremendous improvement. I look at you and I no longer see the sniveling, tyrannical boy you were in school. I see a genuine, warm, heartfelt man.”
him?” Ron’s voice had gone shrill. “You aren’t . . .” He gasped, eyes widening to the size of marbles and slapping a hand over his mouth. “You
“Really?” asked Harry, afraid that Ginny would have manipulated the Weasleys into taking her side and villainizing him.
Draco knew plenty. He knew Harry hated victimizing himself; he’d only said that to rile him up. He also knew Harry hated being called “easy” when he used sex as a means to cope after the war. Until, of course, he’d run into Draco at a Muggle bookshop. He’d kept coming back to the bookshop, asking for recommendations. Draco had eventually, boldly, asked him if he had gotten himself a girlfriend who really liked to read, shacked up with Granger, turned into a bookworm himself, or just found Draco really fit. Harry had smiled and pinned him up against the wall and kissed him.
Soon Draco was buried to the hilt, and he began a slow, steady rhythm, moving his hips in time with Potter’s upward thrusts. With each thrust, Draco’s prostate was brutally hit, and with a particularly savage thrust the men moaned in unison.
Potter’s face fell. “Malfoy, you don’t have to do that,” he said. “Those are your rules and you don’t have to bend them for me.”
After she apparated out of his flat, he numbly padded into the bathroom as though on autopilot and fished under the sink with violently shaking hands for the stack of razors he kept hidden in a drawer, just in case.
“I quit the Aurors,” Harry blurted out, and that was unexpected. Not that Harry had quit; that he’d told Draco.
Harry wilted and nodded. She was right. He was poisonous to Draco, and he had no right barging back into his life when he had made that monstrous a mistake.
“Look at you,” Potter said, panting hard as he slowed his thrusts and braced his hands over Draco. He leaned down and kissed Draco, and Draco sighed into his mouth.
Draco, however, was becoming more frantic, if his heaving chest was anything to go by. He looked paler than ever, almost as though he were losing blood.
“You don’t have to be afraid, Draco,” she said softly, so softly that she might as well have been speaking to an injured animal. “I’m just here to evaluate you. We don’t have to do any therapy today, okay?”
“Hold his right arm out,” instructed the nurse, almost robotically, all gentleness voided from her tone.
“It’s no one’s fault,” Draco told her, horrified she would think such a thing. “Except for mine, of course.”
He made no attempt to pry Draco’s mouth open with his tongue, or otherwise deepen the kiss. He stayed still as a statue, with his soft lips on Draco’s own, for a solid seven seconds. Not that Draco was counting.
“There’s clearly something going on here, something that has to do with us, and I want to get to the bottom of it.”
So Potter and Draco set off in the in the pitter-pattering of the rain, and Draco listened to the sound of the drops clinking on the umbrella above him that was large enough to give both him and Potter room but small enough to ensure that their shoulders brushed every so often. They reached the point of apparition and twirled away with a loud pop.
Harry didn’t know how else to convince her that he was serious, so he decided to give it his best shot.
“Teaching wasn’t for me,” said Draco. “I don’t have the patience for it. But here, I get to brew, and my assistant Nellie helps me sell. My business is still really small, but I’m starting to get a little bit of a name for myself. Word of mouth, so to speak.”
“No, it’s just . . .” Draco sighed, fixing his blonde locks. “You need to figure out what you want with me.”
“You just . . . And we’re . . . I don’t want . . .” Potter sighed again, raking a hand through his dark curls. He looked so endearingly distressed on Draco’s behalf it was cute. “I don’t want to take advantage of you.”
“I love you, Harry,” he breathed. “I love these taut muscles. Your body, your personality, all of it. And I’m . . . I’m ready to let you in my head.”
“I-I’m fine,” said Draco, but his voice sounded unsteady to his own ears. “Just get on with it, Harry.”
They disapparated with a loud crack, landing a few blocks away from Draco’s flat. Then they resumed walking.
“After-effects of Cruciatus,” Draco responded without missing a beat. “Mother says it will go away eventually-”
“Well, this changes everything,” said Pansy. “He might not be able to come anywhere near you right now, but he’s no longer tied down to the Weaselette.”
“We won’t do it today, though. Once we transfer you to the psychiatric unit, they’ll do it at some point while you stay there.”
“Four years,” Potter answered, though he still wouldn’t look at Draco. “I quit the Aurors, spent some time figuring out what I wanted to do, and it occurred to me one day. You always said I have a saving-people thing, right? I figured I might as well put it to some good use.”
“Certainly not,” Harry said, and now he was definitely poking fun at him. “I could have blabber-mouthed all over town about how the owner of The Potion Depot is handing out free samples to attractive blokes-”
Harry had attempted to firecall him several times the first few days after the incident, but Draco had blocked them all. He also sent Draco a letter, which Draco burned before reading. After that, he stopped trying, and Draco was on his own.
tile of the bathroom welcoming death, and waking up miserable and cruelly alive in that hospital bed. Potter had tried to kill him, and the knowledge hurt him to his very core.
Harry felt the onset of more tears. He sniffed loudly, wiping his nose. “And I forgive you, too. For everything. For breaking my nose in sixth year. For the Potter Stinks badges. Even for all the cruel things you said about my parents. You were just a kid. A stupid kid. I know you’re sorry for it all, too. I can see it in your eyes. You’re too afraid to tell me, to let me in. I know that fear. I can see it eating you alive. But I know someday you can tell me. You
“I still don’t know your favorite color,” Harry blurted out, and Draco’s chest tightened, because that really wasn’t fair. “It’s nearly November, and I still don’t know it.”
When Harry would come, he’d mindlessly chatter with Draco about whatever was going on in his life. He’d talk about how his job was going, but not too explicitly in honor of St. Mungo’s patient-confidentiality agreement, he’d talk about Weasley and Granger’s baby, and he’d talk about Quidditch. Comfortable, safe, small topics. Nothing big, nothing major. Nothing important.
Harry found himself trembling slightly as he knocked on the door to the manor for the second time this year.
“Whiskey sounds great,” Potter said as he walked into the living room and plopped onto the sofa, stretching out and putting his legs up on the ottoman like an animal. But Draco
Harry rubbed his thumb along Draco’s jaw, and the blonde man exhaled shakily. Draco couldn’t help but wonder. Why didn’t Harry even want to
“Then what are you doing here?” Harry asked. “You have the power to change things if your life isn’t going the way you want it, Draco.”
fine,” Draco insisted, forgetting his manners and plopping down on the sofa without asking her if she wanted anything. “I was completely fine before Harry came along and ruined everything.”
. If you try and do it for somebody else, it won’t work. Narcissa and I will be here for you and love you and support you through it all, but getting better has to be for you.”
“If you mean that he has lots of feelings, then you’d be correct,” Parkinson said. “I know this isn’t really my place to say, but that boy is so gone for you I swear he gets stars in his eyes every time he talks about you.”
“Okay. Okay.” She released a deep breath, obviously relieved. “I don’t love the fact that you’re shagging the most hideous bloke I know, but I can get over it as long as he doesn’t come near our baby.”
So he found himself nodding, and sighed as Potter leaned back down to press another open-mouthed kiss on his sensitive neck.
After nearly a minute, Draco was ready to hang up, but then he saw Harry’s face emerge in the green, flickering flames.
“You’re right, I can’t,” Draco said quietly. Guilt squeezed at him tightly again, for having assumed Harry was treated well by his extended family. He felt like a complete and utter prick. “I’m sorry, Harry. I didn’t mean to assume anything. I’m so sorry.”
He had a routine. He’d always liked routines. Wake up, have breakfast, go to work, close shop, go back home, have dinner, bathe, and sleep. Wake up, repeat. He had one day off a week, and that was enough. It was all enough. Some days he had to convince himself more than others, but ultimately, it was enough.
Harry’s concerned voice cut into him like a knife. Gasping and hiccuping, he turned around to see his boyfriend standing in the frame of the door looking worried.
“Gonna come,” Harry warned, panting. “Gonna come in that pretty little arse of yours, then I’m gonna slurp out every last drop ‘til you can’t even stand.”
“Would you stop calling yourself that?” Potter asked him gently. “It isn’t true, you aren’t one, and you don’t deserve to ostracize yourself from our world because of one mistake you made seven years ago.”
Christmas Day at the Weasleys, however, was an entirely different affair. He and Ginny had finally made up- she had apologized for attempting to take his unborn child away from him, and told him that although she didn’t see herself ever being Draco’s biggest fan, that she’d accept him because she knew he made Harry happy.
“Get out.” Draco crossed his arms to prevent his hands from shaking, digging his nails into the skin,
“Yeah,” Draco said, somewhat breathlessly. He gasped as Harry lifted him off his feet and spun him around in a circle, pressing kiss after kiss to his lips as he set him back down.
“Was that all it was to you? Just a kiss?” Potter asked him, and the intensity of the question nearly sent Draco’s heart into overdrive.
“Great observational skills. Would you like a medal?” Draco quipped as Pansy walked into his flat and took a seat on his sofa, crossing her legs. She wore a tight blouse and a skirt that left little to the imagination.
Harry moaned unabashedly as he felt his balls tighten up, and then he was coming, fast and hard, into Draco’s abused pucker. His second orgasm of the night was just as earth-shatteringly brilliant as his first.
Draco was panting heavily, clawing Harry’s back and wrapping his legs around Harry’s waist, which Harry found so
Potter gasped softly, hands hovering over Draco’s stomach, almost as if he were afraid to touch. “Draco . . .”
“I knew you weren’t happy,” Pansy said glumly. “You’ve been miserable for years, and I’ve been watching you slowly die-”
“Because . . . Because . . .” He knew Potter wouldn’t understand, and just like that, a fresh wave of tears was ready to crash on the shore of Draco’s shattered composition. “Because that would have made it real. And I’d rather it just exist up here, as a memory.”
Harry carefully closed the door behind him, and he barely had time to cover his mouth before a sob tore through him. He slid down the wall until he was sitting down on the dirty floor outside Draco’s flat. He had hurt the man he loved because it was easier for Draco to think he didn’t love him than for him to believe that the wizarding world hadn’t moved on from the war. If Draco knew Ginny wanted him to stay far away from their baby, he’d be crushed. All Draco’s suspicions would be confirmed, and he’d never come out of hiding. This way, Draco could move on and make a name for himself in the wizarding world again someday, if he wanted to. Harry sincerely hoped he would. Harry sat in the blistering cold outside Draco’s flat and bawled his eyes out until they were dry and aching.
“Where’d you learn to cook like this?” he asked, taking another bite of eggs, humming around the substance. Once he swallowed, he looked back up at Harry. “Your Muggle relatives must’ve been great cooks, teaching you all this.”
“Keep talking like that,” Harry told him huskily, fingers quickening their pace inside him. Draco inhaled sharply as Harry prodded his prostate.
So they talked and ate, and Draco found that pleasant conversation with Potter was just as engaging as emotionally intense conversation, if not more so. By the time Potter paid their bill, Draco was so full and sated and pleased that he actually smiled, dopey as a child, as Potter thanked the waitress and told them their meal was exquisite.
Potter traced daintily over his scars, feeling the bumps and ridges of each one, how they stuck up slightly from his skin. His feather-light touch sent Draco soaring for the stars it felt so good.
He grabbed a loofah from the side of the tub and coated it with Draco’s signature vanilla soap. Wordlessly coaxing Draco to sit up by gently nudging him, Harry took the loofah and began rubbing it softly all across Draco’s naked body.
“Any good?” Draco exclaimed incredulously. “You just gave me the best orgasm of my life, and you’re asking me if it was
Annie shook her head. “I am here to help you get better. A part of getting better is answering questions honestly.” She wrote something down in her notes, then continued.
He felt wrong invading Draco’s private space, but he wanted to check and make sure everything was okay. Draco had to be out somewhere with Pansy. That was it. He’d do a quick sweep of the flat, and then leave, and try again later. Everything was fine.
Everybody hated Draco, wanting nothing to do with him. Everybody wanted everything to do with Harry, without realizing that the Harry they wanted didn’t exist.
Draco looked utterly miserable as he rolled back the sleeve of his left arm, revealing his tarnished, battered skin. Harry gasped softly, taking the wrist in his hand. The lines were fresh, raw, and red, blood still oozing.
It wasn’t Mother’s fault. She, like him, had been sucked into something much larger than herself, and had only acted out of fear and self-preservation.
Narcissa smiled at him. “Please call me Narcissa again. I’d like to be on a first-name basis with the man my son has-” She stopped herself from speaking, clearing her throat.
Draco reeled back as if he’d been smacked. Shaking his head, Harry pulled open the door and stepped outside. “Take care, Draco.” And he was gone.
He was going to be sick. He thought of Draco, the way his grey eyes had lit up when Harry told him he loved him. Was he really about to give that all up for his baby?
, not that you’re ugly, no, I didn’t mean-” Potter cut himself off with a heavy sigh, running a shaking hand through his hair. “C-Can I?”
Potter chuckled. It was a beautiful thing. “Of course you do. I wouldn’t expect anything less. You always were a good brewer in school.”
Potter scoffed quietly. “Wow. I’m . . . Wow. Well, I guess I shouldn’t be too surprised, considering your posh upbringing.”
“Well, the first step is your psychiatric evaluation. In the next few minutes, I’m going to bring in Annie, who’s been assigned to see over your treatment plan and work with you while you’re here. Speaking of introductions, my name is Debbie, your nurse, and if you have any questions about anything, please don’t hesitate to ask.”
Draco chuckled as he took another sip of his alcohol. “Most definitely. It would’ve been a stinging hex or something equally nasty.”
Harry rearranged them so that Draco was lying with his back to Harry’s chest. Draco sighed softly, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder.
, for so long. Why did you give me a chance? Why do you see good in me when I have the potential to fuck up again?”
Harry knew that now; but, again, he was not a telepath. He couldn’t read Draco’s emotions if Draco didn’t communicate with him. At the time, he’d thought that they were using each other.
Draco nodded, chest still heaving. Harry took Draco’s hand in his and kissed each of his knuckles. “Okay. I’ll run the bath.”
“Hey,” he said softly, reaching for Draco’s hands again. “We don’t have to do this tonight, or at all, if you aren’t ready.”
“That isn’t fair for our baby to have parents who are split apart,” said Harry. “I didn’t have any parents, and I’m not going to put my child through that.”
“And what would that something be?” Draco asked her. “He can’t seem to make up his mind on whether he loves me, and I know that eventually he’ll tire of me. Then-”
Harry was on the brink of collapse. What was he supposed to do with this information? Tell Draco he wanted him, too? It seemed simple enough, but what if he was too late?
Draco didn’t have a clue what any of those were. “I . . . I’ve never done a marijuana or a cocaine.”
It took Harry a moment for her words to sink in. He gasped quietly, recognizing what she meant. “So you mean-”
Was he not meant to be good? Surely being good came easy to the right people? And if it didn’t come easy to him, surely something had to be wrong with him, right?
Draco hummed around Harry’s cock, swallowing him even deeper as his tongue swirled and flicked and sucked.
“I’m gonna be a father, did you know that? A real dad. And I’m terrified out of my mind. I don’t know what to do. I’ve always had a plan, had a next-step, but this? This is like veering off the marked trail into the wilderness without so much as a backpack. I feel like I’m going to somehow screw up my child because I’m so screwed up.”
When he returned to the bedroom, filled with the scent of sex, Harry was amused to see Draco sound asleep.
Giving him an awkward stroke, Draco untied the letter from the owl’s leg. The owl immediately flew out the open window. Wasting no time, Draco tore it open.
“I can’t believe Malfoy tried to kill himself,” said Hermione dejectedly. “He has so much to live for . . . If he would just give himself a chance, he would see that there’s still a place for him here.”
Four days passed with Draco mindlessly working in the bookshop, plastering on a smile, and helping customers find what they were looking for. And he was
it. Harry sucked and sucked, bobbing his head up and down and allowing Draco to tangle his hands in Harry’s hair.
Harry continued to pound his abused prostate, fucking Draco through his orgasm and whispering filth in his ear.
“Draco, don’t be like that,” scolded Pansy, placing what was supposed to be a comforting hand on Draco’s shoulder. But the gesture just felt stifling. Her manicured nails scratched lightly at the material of his robes. “We’re just trying to talk to you.”
Potter nodded. “Thank you, but what I’m trying to say is that . . . You aren’t a Death Eater, Malfoy. And I’m not sure you ever were.”
Horrified, Draco snapped out of his trance. “You’re right. I just regressed, all because of a stupid
“Draco, wait, please,” Harry pleaded, finding that he did not want Draco to leave, even if sex was completely out of the question.
Draco smiled softly at him, rocking back on the balls of his feet. Had he always looked so radiant, and glowing? Certainly not. This must be a new development.
“What are you guys talking about?” asked Ron, knowing how instantaneous the messaging system was. Harry was most not definitely going to tell him that they were discussing his potentially fluid sexuality. Nope, not at all.
Harry stepped away from him, fiddling with his pockets. “Just like that? You aren’t even going to give me any reading recommendations?”
him. He took pity on Draco, only wanting to help him because it was the right thing to do- Just like he’d only saved Draco from the Fiendfyre because it was the right thing to do.
“Nothing, just relax,” Potter said soothingly, drawing another circle on his wrist for emphasis. Draco released a breath.
“Gonna add one more,” Potter said huskily, withdrawing the two and breaching his puckered hole with a third. Draco nodded enthusiastically, moaning as Potter twisted and pushed the digits inside him, opening him up. He’d entirely forgotten how good this could feel. The feeling was similar to smelling something that aroused old, fond memories.
“Oh.” Draco visibly wilted. Harry’s hold on him unconsciously tightened. “Hey, I was only trying to say-”
“I’m sorry, what?” Draco asked, voice all high and squeaky. He knew his face was rising in color, too, and he clasped his hands together to prevent them from shaking.
Potter rotated his barstool to face Draco, and come to think of it . . . They weren’t that far apart.
Draco sighed into his mouth as Harry nipped at the shell of his ear, swirling his tongue around in a way that made Draco shiver.
“You’re in your pyjamas and it’s four o’clock in the afternoon,” Pansy said with a deadpan glare. “Has Potter firecalled you since I last saw you?”
“I’m not criticizing you,” Potter said gently. “It’s actually sort of . . . Nice, to see you’ve outgrown your old ideals and prejudices.”
“First I’d like to get a history of your self harm,” said Annie, and she really was diving right in, wasn’t she? Draco glanced at his wrists, thumbing the bandage that had been wrapped around the area on his left just above his mark.
“I can’t believe I’m saying this,” said Ron, “but if you love the ferret, you need to go after him and fix this.”
“Oh, sweetheart, you already want my cock in you?” Harry crooned, fingers making deliciously obscene noises and pumping into Draco at the exact angle he knew he needed. “We aren’t done yet.”
“Draco, if you aren’t doing this for yourself, it’s never going to work. Do you really want to be his little fuck toy forever? Cause that’s where you’re headed until he comes to his senses and marries Weasley.”
And after reading the comments on the last chapter, I have a few things to say. I'm trying my absolute best to keep Harry and Draco's relationship raw, and real, and flawed. Earlier in the fic we saw a couple instances where that line toed into abuse, but they're working on their issues and grappling with their feelings for each other while discovering what it means for them to be emotionally vulnerable. That is not an excuse towards abusive behavior, nor do I condone the type of relationship that Harry and Draco have at this stage in the fic. Thanks, that is all, and please enjoy the chapter!
Draco hadn’t meant for that to slip out. “No reason,” he said. “I just . . . We fought, remember, and I wasn’t in the mood to talk to anybody.”
Potter, however, seemed keen on moving on. “Listen, I didn’t come here to harass you on your work history.”
“H-He’s this way.” He gestured to the bathroom, and the Muggles wheeled in a stretcher and lifted Draco’s frail body, securing him. They rolled him out of the flat and lifted him into the ambulance.
It was three weeks before Harry came to see Draco in the shop again. This time, it was busy and bustling, and it took a while before Harry was able to pull Draco aside.
“Draco Malfoy, you stop that train of thought right now,” Pansy ordered sternly. “You can’t automatically assume he’ll just . . . tire of you, like you’re some new ice cream flavour or fashion trend.”
Harry feasted away. Licking and slurping, his tongue repeatedly stabbed Draco’s hot hole while he swallowed every last drop of come that came gushing out.
“So let’s talk about it, then,” Draco said, taking another sip of his cup and letting the steaming hot liquid coat his tongue and run down the back of his throat.
“Because you are good,” Harry answered, and he said it so casually Draco wanted to melt. “I know you were mean once, but that was a really long time ago, and you are a completely different person now. I see the change and the growth in you. You should see it, too.”
“Hey, wait, Malfoy, no, I didn’t mean it like that,” Potter said, reaching for him, and this time Draco let him. He let Potter close his large hands over his smaller one, rubbing the skin softly. Draco was ready to cry again.
Harry weighed his options. He could leave Draco alone, which was obviously what Draco wanted, but risk him self-harming again. Or he could go barge in on his space, possibly getting kicked out again. Neither option was favorable.
be it, Potter had actually sacrificed himself for the wizarding world just like the Dark Lord asked him to, he had actually walked into that forest and
Draco liked that idea. He liked it a lot. But the pathetic, wimpy loser in him reminded him that ultimately, he didn’t stand a chance.
And Harry broke down completely as his sobs overtook him. Draco shushed him softly and murmured sweet nothings in his ear as he held the man he loved in his arms, something he thought he would never get to do again.
“Mhm,” Harry agreed as he let go of Draco to work on his own belt. Draco, meanwhile, was urging Harry’s shirt over his head. Harry lifted his hands to allow the garment to come off, then resumed undoing his belt so he could remove his trousers.
“Don’t have his information, either,” said Harry. He absently wondered who of Draco’s Slytherin friends he still kept in contact with, if it was just Parkinson and he’d pushed all the others out or if he still kept a cozy, tight-knit circle.
Hermione telling him it wasn’t his fault was like saying that pushing somebody off a cliff wasn’t his fault; the person may have gotten themselves to the edge, but it was Harry who pushed them over.
“You know,” said Potter, “I actually died. In that forest. I was alive when Hagrid carried me out, but Voldemort did kill me.”
Draco mewled as Harry’s dirty words filled his mind. He wrapped a trembling arm around his aching, leaking cock. Precum oozed out at the slit, and he began pumping himself hurriedly, knowing it wouldn’t be long now.
“Are you kidding?” Harry asked her, scooting closer and taking her hand in his. “You’ll make an amazing mother. You’re responsible, and caring, and loyal. Your family will be so proud of you.”
What had Draco done wrong? He wanted to ask Potter about it, but decided they weren’t on steady enough terrain for that kind of conversation. Would they ever be?
Harry responded with a moan of his own as his lips danced with Draco’s in tandem. Draco couldn’t get enough. He had buried his feelings for Harry so deep, repressed them so thoroughly, that he had entirely forgotten that they were there. And there they were, alive and feral, clawing at the gates, begging to be released.
Harry chuckled. “Do I have to have a reason?” His hand trailed from Draco’s wrist back up his arm, past his neck, until he was cupping his jaw.
out that night I asked you to stay over and you know it. You self-destruct because you are so torn between wanting to come back to our world and wanting to stay here and rot away that it’s killing you. You used me just as much as I used you, and I’ll tell you what isn’t fair. Only pointing the blame one way.”
, you feel so fucking good around me,” Potter groaned, eyes fluttering closed as Draco continued impaling himself on Potter’s cock.
Because Draco was a coward, and because he didn’t deserve any kindness this stunningly handsome man had to offer him, his chest tightened and his throat choked up as he said the following words,
“Because I don’t want to bother her with my- Because she’s busy,” Draco amended, though the damage had already been done.
He didn’t have long to wait- the witch in question walked toward him, and she looked as graceful and elegant as ever. Her long, silvery hair was draped down her side in a braid, and when her eyes landed on Harry she smiled softly.
“It doesn’t seem like you are,” Harry said softly, and apparently that was the wrong thing to say, for Draco fixed him with an indiscernible expression and sauntered closer to him.
He had a chance to tell Harry he loved him back. Harry might not take it well; he might tell Draco that he was too late. But Draco had to at least try.
He practically preened as he felt a probing finger at his entrance. When had Harry spelled them? Sucking in breath, he braced himself. It had been a whole week; he was sure to be tight.
“Draco . . .” Harry slid down Draco’s body until he was on his knees, head level with Draco’s stomach. He wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, pulling him in and planting a kiss on Draco’s tummy.
He let Harry inside, taking in all his earthly beauty. His unruly, curly hair that spread across his shoulders, his sparkling green eyes that weren’t the slightest bit inhibited by his square spectacles, his tanned skin. Harry was a work of art, and Draco might be about to lose him forever. He gulped.
As for lunch? Draco found it entirely too cumbersome to fix himself something to eat when he only had a thirty minute break, so he just spent the time reading a book in the back of the shop. As a result, he was ravenously hungry right now.
“What if I told you it was someone you didn’t like?” Harry asked, hating how uncertain he sounded right now.
“Wouldn’t ever expect it,” Harry said with a smile. “Like I told you before, you’re it for me, Draco. I’m not going anywhere. I want- no, I need- for you to take as long as you like in deciding where you want to proceed from here.”
“Well, it certainly does,” said Draco. “But, Harry . . . I think I need some time to think. About this.”
“I know that,” said Draco, feeling a sickness pool in his gut. He and Harry could never have what he and Ginny had; he knew that deep down.
She was a sweet, tiny little thing, and when Draco held her, he had never felt so important. Significant. Right now, he held the life of a child in his hands, and it was beautiful.
Harry came with a high moan, come stuffing up Draco’s hole. Draco shuddered from the force of it, feeling the creamy, hot liquid inside him.
“I know you are, sweetie, I know. And it’s okay. But if you stay locked away here forever, you’ll be miserable. I know you want to come back. I can see it in your eyes. You belong with us. You belong at
Hermione, on the other hand, was far more understanding. When Harry had come clean to her, she had merely nodded and told him in gentle tones that she wasn’t all that surprised.
“Harry stopped by tonight, after I firecalled him,” said Draco, certain why the only reason he wasn’t a sobbing heap on the floor was because he was still in shock, “and you won’t believe what happened.”
“Well, I hope you don’t expect me just to swoon over and fall to your feet from a few nice words,” Draco said.
He wondered what his mother would think. They hadn’t written in ages, because Draco couldn’t look at her without seeing
Draco had let himself be used for Harry’s pleasure. Draco’s self esteem had been so alarmingly low that he didn’t find it important to speak up about his preferences in bed.
Draco clutched his stomach and breathed heavily through his mouth as more cramps tore through him one by one, each more brutal than the last. His breathing began to slow. It was starting.
“But I miss you,” Pansy said forlornly. “Your mother misses you. Narcissa and I write all the time about you; you don’t visit her enough. Blaise even misses you. I know things would be incredibly difficult at first, and you’ll probably get like ten no’s before a single yes, but don’t you want to at least try?”
Harry could immediately tell something was off. He looked paler than usual, a bead of sweat was plastered across his temples, and his grey eyes looked frantic, like a startled animal.
“Okay, so back to your mystery beau.” Ron had a mischievous glint in his eye that Harry didn’t like at all. “Did he go to Hogwarts? Is he someone from work?”
There was too much they hadn’t talked about yet. Harry wanted to spend the rest of his life fixing that.
“Because he’s Potter. He wants children and a white picket fence and some semblance of peace for a change. He doesn’t need your instability or turbulence or to babysit you while you rot away because you’re too afraid to try to fight back for your place in our world.”
Draco heard the loud pop of apparition, and a long short minutes later there was a knock on his door.
“I just got back from the fucking hospital,” Harry said. “He doesn’t want to see me. I can’t keep . . .
Draco knew the subject was still sore as a fresh, open wound. He wanted to talk about it with Harry more, knock down more of those barriers. But he decided he would respect Harry’s wishes, and wait to do that another day.
“I dunno how to feel,” Draco responded truthfully. “He’s my father, and I love him, but . . . A part of me is really glad he’s gone, because he hurt me so much.”
understand- That would mean I would’ve had to- So I guess I don’t understand- But I do understand in the figurative sense, which is- You know what? Never mind.” He finished speaking with a sigh.
“Because you’re a human being who deserves basic compassion and kindness just as much as everybody else,” said Potter, and the answer shattered Draco to pieces because he was
“That’s the thing, I don’t want you to feel like you have to half-arse this just because I’m scared,” said Draco, and he sounded so distressed that Harry wanted to bundle him up in warm blankets and hug him until he stopped shaking.
“I wish he’d written to me about it,” said Narcissa wistfully, then seemed to immediately recognize herself. “I’m sorry . . . I sound like a child, don’t I?”
With a small smile, he flipped the pill bottle upside down and emptied a few capsules into his hand. This was it. He would finally be free.
“We do have a lot to talk about,” Draco agreed. “Like how you begged me to take you back right after you found out your child was miscarried.”
Draco surrendered into the embrace, letting his head fall on Harry’s shoulder as his frame sagged and he gulped breath after breath. Utterly exhausted, he eventually lifted his head and looked at Harry with imploring eyes.
His hair was a mess, he hadn’t showered, and he was wearing plaid pyjama pants with an oversized tee shirt that hung off his small frame.
“Alright,” Harry said, “that’s it. Lock up. I’m taking you to get something to eat. I know a great Muggle burger joint a few blocks down. We’ll walk.”
The days here had been miserable so far. They slept with the hall lights on and the doors cracked, and every so often someone would peek their head in to make sure no one was trying to kill themselves. Because sheets were
Draco’s eyes were red-rimmed as though he’d been crying, and he wore a deep frown on his face instead of his usual smirk.
Harry, the snide bastard, only chuckled. He was like an Olympic swimmer after a race- barely tired at all. “That good, huh?”
“Yeah, well, it’s hardly fair of you to call me out for doing a job I hate when you were stuck in the same trap.”
The bell jingled as he opened the wooden door, and he looked around the shop. Nobody else was in there.
Harry felt the effects wash over him immediately like a bucket of water. Draco was a discombobulating mixture of nervous, excited, apprehensive, and eager. Harry had never been in quite so complex a head before.
Hermione tucked a stray brown curl behind her ear. “I support Harry in whatever he chooses to do with his love life.”
The beeping grew faster, ringing in Draco’s eardrums like nails on a chalkboard. His head was underwater; he couldn’t
But as the minutes dragged on, Harry’s anxiety brimmed closer and closer to the surface, until he was spilling all over. Tears leaked from the corners of his eyes as he pressed himself against Draco’s cold, unmoving body.
“Well, then, Harry Potter, would you like to go out on a date with me? Let me take you out? I can show you a great time.”
“You have a point,” she conceded. “But, Draco, we’ve had this conversation before, and I’m going to ask you again. Is this really what you want to do for the rest of your life? Hide out in a Muggle neighbourhood, work a Muggle job, isolated from everyone you know? You have so much potential to positively impact the wizarding world, and-”
Harry smiled sadly at him. “I’m not going to let that happen. Not this time. We’re in this together now, and we’re going to do it right.”
“I dunno,” said Draco, toying with the linen of his dress shirt. He truthfully hated Muggle clothing, thought it was too tight and constricting, but he would play the part down to a T for peace and quiet. He had worked too hard to attain it; he wouldn’t sacrifice it over a few garments of clothing.
And as Draco finished the rest of his closing duties with Harry leaning against one of the shelves and whistling lowly, he realized something. He realized that what he and Harry had may never be perfect. He was going to see the good, the bad, the ugly in Harry, perhaps all at once sometimes. But he had never been more okay with that.
“I do not appreciate the two of you going behind my back after I specifically forbade Draco from ever seeing you again,” said Narcissa. “But, I cannot truly stop my son from being with the one he loves.”
Draco tried to focus less on the fact that Harry found him selfish and more on the part where he said he didn’t see himself marrying Ginny.
Draco moaned sleepily, raising his arms above his head and yawning, stretching in a way that resembled a cute kitten.
Harry ran his hands beneath Draco’s back and scooped him up with a little grunt, cradling him bridal style close to his chest. Draco laid his head directly on Harry’s heart, humming softly.
“You like it when I take my time with you, even though you’d never admit it,” he said. “You love the slow stretch, the way I slowly take you apart with my fingers. It’s maddening for you.” He pushed one lubed finger into Draco’s twitching hole.
Harry felt tears prick at the corners of his eyes. He swallowed thickly, forcing himself to remain composed for his friends. He’d be of no use if he were a blubbering mess.
“Hi,” he breathed, taking in Draco’s sparking grey eyes and his dripping wet hair. How did he always manage to look so sexy?
“Verbal abuse is hardly a pillar of a healthy relationship, Draco,” Annie said, and to his dismay she sounded sad.
He knew that Potter would never see him as anything more than a friend, but there was something in his eye when he looked at Draco that was more ardent, and zealous. And it made Draco wonder.
When their arrangement had first begun, it seemed like Draco had wanted something more, but Harry was certain that was just their post-sex bliss that had plastered a saccharine coat over his words. There was no way Draco had
Draco felt himself shrink under Potter’s gaze. He didn’t think he’d ever felt so small. He looked up at Potter, then down in his lap, lips parted slightly. Then he looked back up at Potter, when he felt those blazing eyes pierce him like the sun on a hot summer day.
“I both can and can’t believe you’ve never had a hamburger before,” Potter said, which earned him a playful whack on the arm.
Draco sighed. “I’ll be back to normal soon. I don’t need all this fuss, and I certainly don’t need a Mind Healer.” It had sounded nice when Harry brought it up, but that was back when he and Harry were still . . .
When Draco needed air, he pulled back and panted for breath. Potter seemed just as affected, if his heaving chest was anything to go by.
As Harry leaned in to kiss him, common sense returned like an ice cold bucket of water washing over him. He lurched away from him, horrified with himself.
“He scooped me up into his arms, which I found really odd, and I asked him what he was doing. He shushed me, saying that a pretty mouth like mine wasn’t suited for asking questions.”
“It really isn’t fair how much I want things to go back to normal,” said Draco. “But I made myself a promise. And my Mother would never forgive me, but that’s neither here nor there.”
Draco’s only response was a breathy moan, and he went limp in Harry’s grip, panting raggedly. “Didn’t you already know that?” he asked.
“I get it.” Draco’s harsh tone cut through Harry like a blade. “I’m damaged goods. You don’t want to break me. You’re afraid to have sex with me after seeing what you saw.”
“Yeah, baby, and that won’t be the only time I edge you,” said Harry, voice gone low. Draco moaned lewdly.
Draco, as it turned out, only needed a week until he was ready. One frosty, snowy evening after work, he apparated outside the wards of Grimmauld Place and waited for Harry to let him in.
And another, and another, and another, until the whole bottle was gone, and Draco was beginning to feel all floaty and dizzy. He leaned against the door as a sudden headrush swooped over him, engulfing all his senses and sending him crashing to the floor.
“I’m sure it’s a very rewarding profession,” Draco said politely, and Potter nodded. He led Draco over to the Peace Draughts as if he owned the place, and Draco wasn’t entirely opposed to the confident, dominant behavior.
Potter sighed. “You have a right to think that. I won’t try and take it away from you. I just encourage you to . . . Reassess.”
“Relationship?” exclaimed Pansy shrilly. “What you have is not a relationship. It’s a toxic, twisted clusterfuck at
He considered Harry’s words. He said it would feel nothing like what he’d experienced with the Dark Lord. But nonetheless, letting someone into your head was an incredibly intimate thing. Draco would have to trust Harry to the end of the world in order to allow him to do that.
Harry hummed as he continued devouring Draco, reducing him to a writhing, whimpering mess. To his dismay, Draco felt tears prick at the corners of his eyes and his cock
“Make yourself comfortable in the sitting room,” he said, walking into the kitchen. “And I’ll make the drinks. Would you fancy a whiskey?”
“What is it?” Ginny asked, concerned, squeezing Harry’s hand. But Harry let her go, opting instead to run both his hands through his thick, black curls.
It only took Draco a moment to come to his senses, and with great difficulty he pried himself away from the man he loved.
Draco leaned in to kiss him, then, and Harry let him. He let Draco push him back until he was lying on the pillows, groaning into Draco’s mouth as Draco slipped his hands beneath Harry’s shirt.
“What about you?” Draco asked. “You quit a job you hated. What are you going to do now? You have no idea, do you?”
“Because it isn’t right. This isn’t right. You need to stick to what you said in your letter, Harry. We aren’t right for each other.”
“Parkinson, I’ve got to go,” he murmured, snatching his coat from the rack and wrapping himself up in the garment as fast as he could.
But he couldn’t contact Parkinson because he didn’t have her floo, nor could he tell her the reason why Draco needed company, because he’d sworn to Draco he wouldn’t breathe a word.
“One conversation in a pub doesn’t mean you know me, Potter.” Draco knew he was being frosty, but he couldn’t find it in himself to care, not when Potter was treading so close to treacherous terrain that he didn’t know how to navigate.
“We’re going to get some blood work done on you, to run some tests and make sure everything is okay.”
“Not much, other than wanting to talk about their soulmate. Which, come to think of it, they didn’t say much about because they asked me about mine.”
“Can I, please?” Potter asked, gesturing to the array of scars. Draco wasn’t sure what he meant so he nodded to see what would happen, which is why when Potter dipped his head down and began leaving light kisses over each scar, he first jumped in surprise, then settled when he felt Potter’s hand rubbing soothing circles at his side, tucked inside his open shirt.
“Draco,” Harry said, voice barely above a whisper, and he sounded so utterly ruined that Draco found himself moving aside from the frame in spite of himself.
about his life. How isolated he’d gotten. He’d even pushed Greg away without really meaning to, feeling guilty for having ordered him around all those years. Pansy was the only one left. And would she want anything to do with him after this?
Draco couldn’t stop a tear from falling. It acted completely of its own accord, utterly betraying him. He sniffled softly.
“Ron and Hermione are busy with the baby, Luna’s abroad, Neville’s at Hogwarts so I don’t see him much, and the Weasleys all have their own stuff going on. I dunno, I just thought . . . I thought maybe you’d be someone who could listen.”
He cut himself off with a moan as Harry sucked a love bite on his inner thigh, close to his throbbing, red cock. He knew Draco loved the teasing. He began planting kisses all around Draco’s crotch, teasing just as promised, giving him what he wanted instead of what he needed. His hands slid from his inner thighs to his arse cheeks, gripping them tightly.
“Why would I be cross with you?” Harry asked. “That’s very private information, and of course if we date I’d want you to tell me eventually, but I wouldn’t have any expectations for you to tell me before you’re ready.”
say that to me. You know nothing about my life, or me. You’re just a fuck, and we’ve established that, haven’t we?”
Harry felt a blush coat his neck, traveling rapidly up to his cheeks. “Just because I’m relaying the fact that he didn’t kill Fred doesn’t mean I’m in
Sorry it's been a while!! Little life update, school's been going well, I'm a writing tutor now so I'm busy with that, and I just went home this weekend to celebrate my grandma's 80th so that was a lot of fun. The gears started turning again, so this is the result :)
“Looks like our childhoods weren’t so different after all,” said Harry, pistoning his finger deeper into Draco.
“It’s just . . .” Harry realized that if he never tried, he would never know the truth. “I’m sort of in love with you, that’s all.”
“You don’t mean that,” Draco said kindly, smiling sadly at him. “But that’s okay. I forgive you anyway, Harry.”
“Oh, I know exactly what he did to you, you dramatic tit. He scratched your arm the tiniest amount. And that was only because you approached him, all haughty and mighty on your high horse, without bowing.”
and kiss him again. But he’d heard all this before, and when Harry sweet-talked him, it only ever meant sex.
The memories continued to assault him, and Draco clamped a hand over his mouth to prevent any sobs from escaping. Now was not the time. He had
“I have a little extra stored away, funds that your father can’t touch. And don’t say that, Draco. Your health doesn’t have a price.”
Draco sighed. “Yes, I suppose it would be rude of me to leave you standing out in the cold, wouldn’t it?”
Until the war, anyhow. Then they started things back up after the war, and stayed together for two years until Harry came out as bisexual.
Christmas came and went. At the manor, Christmas Eve was a quiet, polite occasion, with lots of presents for Draco and few for Harry, but Harry didn’t care. He had the greatest gift of all.
here?” Draco couldn’t resist the urge to pick on him. It was too strong. “Still observant as ever, I see. What do you
But when Draco’s eyes began to sparkle as he described in vivid, animated detail the exact components of the potion’s formula, effects, and flavour, he decided he wasn’t.
Draco instantly reacted like a dog to a bell, wrapping a hand around his soaked cock. He began stroking himself up and down, up and down, until Harry’s hand came down on top of his and began stroking him harder.
He didn’t receive a response to his second letter, either. He couldn’t help but feel discouraged and disappointed. And worried that Draco was going to pick Narcissa over him, which would be a perfectly reasonable choice.
Once they reached the bedroom, Draco was all but vibrating. Harry sat on the bed, pulling Draco with him so he sat across from him.
The minutes blurred together until Harry heard a faint siren that grew louder and louder, and then people were knocking on Draco’s door, and Harry was letting them in with tears streaming down his face.
“You’re not,” Draco said quickly, so quickly that he himself was surprised. Because from an outsider’s perspective, it may have seemed like Potter was taking advantage, but Draco knew Potter. He knew that he was respectful of boundaries, and that he most of all would never intentionally hurt Draco.
“You want to know what she told me?” Harry asked him, stepping closer to him. Draco did not back away, but he did stiffen. “She’s worried about you. And she didn’t directly say this, but I think she’s concerned you’re going to do something to hurt yourself.”
As promised, Potter firecalled him, about a week later. They talked on the phone for a while, and they fell into an easy routine where every Friday evening, Potter would firecall Draco and they would talk for a good thirty to forty-five minutes. He still came into the Apothecary every two weeks, and he still refused to allow Draco to bend the rules for him.
Well, maybe Pansy hadn’t directly implied that no one would ever want him, but he decided to throw that bit in there because it was true.
Draco cautiously approached the source of the noise, and was shocked to find Harry’s owl fluttering outside with a letter attached to its foot. Sighing, he unlocked the latch to the window and allowed the poor bird to fly inside.
Resigning, he stepped inside from the frosty cold and shrugged off his peacoat, hanging it carefully on Draco’s coat rack.
, since apparently I’m not marriage material, but Harry told me he doesn’t plan on marrying the Weasel.”
“Well, unfortunately for us, he doesn’t see it that way,” said Harry, feeling a fiery wave of possession roll through him at the prospect of Draco forming his own conclusions about his self-worth. Harry wanted to be the one to tell Draco how to feel about his worth. Harry wanted to be the one to hold him close at night and kiss his temple and whisper in his ear how loved he was, how incredibly loved. And how incredibly important.
Draco’s head was swirling while he made the drinks. He was already buzzed from the beer because he was a lightweight, and he had a feeling that if he wasn’t careful, tonight had the potential to end very, very poorly for him. What was he thinking, inviting Potter into his home? What good could come of that?
“F-Fine.” Draco tried hard to focus on the subject at hand, but it was hard when Pansy had stormed out and now they were firecalling each other as though nothing had happened.
“If it isn’t love, then how come I notice you’ve been looking so . . . good, lately?” Ron asked. “Better is the word I’m looking for. You look better.”
in our world. Then there’s me. The Death Eater, the fuck up. The one who had no choice. I never wanted to join them, Harry.” His voice had gotten wet again, and he sounded on the verge of tears. “They were going to kill my mother, you didn’t see how scared she was. It was you or her. And I chose her.”
“Oh god!” Harry sprang up from the sofa as Parkinson put her coat back on. “This can’t be happening, this actually can’t be happening.”
“Oh.” Draco flopped down on the sofa. Some of his blonde hair got into his eyes. It was downright adorable. “So we’re back to only doing something because it’s the right thing to do?”
about me!” Draco exploded, raw and bleeding like his arm. “You don’t know what it feels like to live with the things I’ve done. People may have died for you, but you’re a hero-”
Draco opened his mouth to speak, but all his retorts died on the tip of his tongue. He couldn’t think of anything adequate that would shut Harry up.
“You can tell Pansy to go fuck herself.” Draco’s voice sounded weak, and fragile. Harry’s heart broke clean in two.
“Alright, then,” she said, making to sit down in Harry’s chair. Draco instinctively shrank away from her.
Harry’s eyes widened. “Really?” But in truth, the information went straight to his cock, which rapidly began growing again. The idea of being the largest Draco ever had filled him with such primal arousal that it was everything he could do not to pounce on the man and immediately fuck him. Steps had to be taken first.
“I was,” Harry admitted. “But not because I didn’t know what I wanted. Because I was too afraid to tell the truth.”
Harry’s finger jabbed mercilessly against Draco’s prostate. He pulled it out, and quickly pushed back in with two.
Potter’s eyes widened comically, and he looked positively flabbergasted. “You . . . You don’t know what a
“I just wanted to let you know that . . . It’s, erm, been a while for me, and I just- I just wanted to tell you that.”
Draco froze for a moment, surprised, but when Harry’s hands tenderly stroked his face and twisted in his overgrown blonde hair, he moaned quietly and opened his mouth to deepen the kiss.
“I don’t want your blessing if it isn’t sincere,” Harry said quickly. “You’re the most important person in Draco’s life, and if you aren’t on board, then I walk. No questions asked.”
Greg chuckled. “You’re always talking about him, he always manages to get a rise out of you, and you always go out of your way to get his attention. Some might even say you fancy him.”
When Draco emerged in the kitchen, he flashed a smile at Harry, who was in a red and black checkered robe flipping strips of bacon in one skillet and frying eggs in the next.
He walked tentatively past the front gardens, adorned with flowers and well-trimmed shrubbery. When he knocked on the door, a house elf answered and offered to take his coat. Harry gratefully accepted, waiting for Narcissa in the . . . uniquely decorated drawing room.
Harry rolled out of bed and walked over to the bathroom, where he turned on the water and lit a candle to set the ambiance. He hummed an off-key tune to himself as the water began to fill, and he lined up all of Draco’s favorite soaps and scrubs, along with his shampoo.
“L-Likes would be a- You mean- You don’t mean-” Speaking was becoming a difficult task for Harry, who was finding it harder and harder to breathe.
Hermione was six months along now, pregnant as ever. They had already known the sex of the baby, but tonight when Hermione was talking to Harry and Draco she asked them, “Can you keep a secret?”
“But we used a protection charm.” Harry was growing light-headed. He needed to lie down. “C-Can we sit, please?”
Harry was emotionally attracted to him. Draco felt like he was sitting on a cloud. He beamed radiently. “Harry, that’s . . . I’m so glad you aren’t cross with me for not telling.”
That explanation didn’t seem to settle Potter, though. “You shouldn’t have to downplay it like that. This is all so fucked up. You shouldn’t have to continue getting hurt after you were fairly tried and freed.”
But he did love him. He loved him very, very much. But Ginny wouldn’t want him anywhere near his baby if she knew that. So it was better this way, he reasoned. It was better for everyone.
Draco giggled, placing a hand over his mouth, shaking his head fondly. Potter was going to be the death of him.
Harry apparated to the point of apparition, then braved the short walk to Draco’s apartment. He was sure the other man was home- Draco lived a life of recluse, and he didn’t keep in touch with anyone from the wizarding world except Pansy. Harry didn’t even know whether Draco kept in touch with his parents.
“You’re all nice and wet for me,” he praised, pressing kiss after kiss into the soft skin as he pistoned his fingers just right to hit him where he knew Draco would see stars. “So wet.”
It hurt, at first, the stretch. The girth was more than what Draco was used to, and he wasn’t even halfway down and things were already starting to feel tight. He felt himself tensing up, as his breathing picked up.
“I’d like that, Draco,” said Mother, smiling softly. “I’d like that very much. But, please, let’s sit. We have matters to discuss.”
“Draco, no, you are beautiful, so beautiful,” Harry exclaimed, taking a step closer and grasping his dainty hands. “And easy? Well . . . You’re basically calling me easy, too, you know?”
“C’mere, baby,” Harry whispered, pulling him into another searing kiss that had his very head spinning. To his surprise, Draco was the one to pull back first, and he shimmied down Harry’s body, pressing kisses all around his crotch.
Harry looked deep into his frantic grey eyes. He took a tentative step closer to the other man, yearning to touch, but knowing he was forbidden.
“Draco,” he murmured, easing Draco down until he was horizontal and sliding his hands up Draco’s back, out from underneath him to brace himself on either side of Draco’s head. “You taste so good here.”
Emotions welled up in Draco’s chest so suddenly, so abruptly, that he stood up, clutching the jumper close. “Excuse me,” he said quietly, bolting away from the scene, missing Harry’s concerned glance.
He wasn’t in the kitchen, so Harry made a right out of the living room and headed towards the bathroom.
“It’s fine,” Harry said, walking over to the coat rack and plucking his pea coat from the hanger. “I understand.”
On the third day, he heard a knocking at his door. He hadn’t bothered to dress that day since he didn’t have work, and he had an unpleasant feeling who it was.
“Of course,” Harry answered. “Draco, he . . . I love him with all my heart. I only want him to be happy. And if his mother isn’t happy with his partner, then how can that happen?”
Debbie departed, and Draco was left to his own devices. He’d really screwed up this time, hadn’t he?
“F-For a while?” A stunned Draco was cute, really, but Harry was gonna need him to say something soon before he started panicking.
“You like that,” Harry murmured, hands tickling his sides. Draco tangled a hand in his thick, black hair that was so much softer than it looked.
“Maybe I should go,” said Harry quietly, standing up from his kneeling position. Draco followed suit.
Draco was soaring, soaring, soaring, and he needed to find ground, and fast. What he was engaging in right now was very, very dangerous.
“I never saw the point,” said Draco, and instantly Harry was hit with a thousand feelings all at once.
Draco popped a pill in his mouth, swallowing it down with the glass of water he’d brought into the bathroom. The pill was heavy in his mouth.
“Because I feel like I can really talk to you,” said Potter, continuing the circles and looking at Draco as though he had no idea how affected he was by it. Maybe he did. Draco didn’t know.
“Here you are,” said the tech. “If you have any questions, feel free to ask Cindy, the tech on duty right now. She’s over there in the blue scrubs.”
Potter would always give him dirty looks in the halls, would always roll his eyes whenever Draco shouted something at him. Albeit, the things Draco shouted wouldn’t always be very nice, but Potter seemed to be annoyed by more than just his words. He seemed to be annoyed by Draco’s mere
“There’s nothing they can do to hurt me,” Harry said, thinking back to when the messenger had said that they hadn’t wanted to hurt him. He knew better than to take those words completely at face value, but there was something about the way that message had come across that made Harry feel safe.
“I was so stupid,” Harry said. “I hurt him on purpose to push him away because I thought it would be easier . . . I didn’t want him to think our world hadn’t moved on.
Potter looked at him. “I try to use it rationally. I only take it when I absolutely need it, and sometimes I have to choose my battles wisely.”
Harry pulled him into a bone-crushing hug then, needing to feel his closeness and remind himself that this was
Once Harry had written down the hospital’s address and handed the paper back to Narcissa, she began walking out of the sitting room, gesturing for Harry to follow her.
Draco looked. The burger came with swiss cheese, grilled onions, mushrooms, and garlic aioli. It looked mouth-wateringly delicious.
“Draco’s forgiven me. He may not trust me yet, but he’s forgiven me. And I should tell you, we did, erm . . . share a kiss a couple of weeks ago.”
“But I don’t know how to tell him without messing up what we have. What we have is easy, it works, and up until now I thought it wasn’t hurting either one of us.”
“S-So you want to go for a meal. With me,” Draco clarified, willing for his head to remain attached to his body.
“I know.” Draco glumly looked down, unable to make eye contact with his friend. Who may want nothing more to do with him.
“I, erm . . .” Draco cleared his throat. “This is really random and not at all related to our conversation.”
“We were never friends,” Draco said dryly. “Not for a second. I always saw him as something more. I knew he was special. When we were eleven, I offered him my hand in friendship, but he rejected me.”
hugged him like this, not even after the night he had received the Mark and she’d come into his room to check on him.
“And those machines that go fast on the roads. They scare me a lot, actually,” Draco admitted, flushing deeper. Here he was admitting to Harry Potter of all people that he found Muggle inventions interesting. What a strange day this was turning out to be.
“You’re a good man, Harry. I trust that your intentions are honest. But he’s still my son, and I’m still his mother. And if you ever hurt him, you have me to answer to.”
Pansy, having knowledge that the rest of them did not, fixed him with a long, hard look. “You know, Draco, there’s ways to remedy this situation. Ways that do not involve being a total and utter prat to him all the time.”
As if on cue, the bell above the door jingled and in walked an old woman. Draco had half a mind to ask her if she was lost.
Harry got to work on his own belt, unbuckling the strap and pulling down his trousers. Long, hairy, muscled legs came into view, legs Draco loved to straddle.
“Could you go over to his place and check on him?” Parkinson pleaded. “I’m sure everything’s fine, I just want to make sure, and I know he’ll just shutter up and kick me out because we’ve freshly fought. At least your wounds are a few weeks old now.”
Harry approached him until their toes were nearly touching, and reached for one of Draco’s hands. Harry covered the pale limb with both of his own calloused hands, rubbing softly. The action was so gentle Draco could have fainted right there.
“Because I-” The words died on the tip of his tongue. He couldn’t say it. It was too huge. “Because I care about you.”
“He’s not good for you, darling. He doesn’t seem to know what he wants, and it’s incredibly unfair of him to drag you along. Especially with the baby.”
“Okay, so I haven’t been eating regularly. But it isn’t anything to worry about- Sometimes I just don’t get hungry,” he assured him.
“He stayed with me here,” Draco said, unsure why he suddenly wanted to defend Harry to his psychiatrist so much. “That means he has to care.”
“Look at you, all red and open for me,” Harry marveled, before pressing a wet kiss on his clenching hole. “You always taste so good.”
“Y-Yeah. I’m fine.” Draco straightened his posture, then cleared his throat. “Anyway, I was saying that you can’t blame yourself for that. It’s preposterous.”
“Are you really alright, though?” Pansy asked. “I know consoling him couldn’t have been easy for you to do.”
Draco’s condition began rapidly deteriorating. He began skipping meals, too tired to make himself proper food. When his pantry ran out of groceries, he didn’t bother restocking it.
Draco peered closer at Harry. He looked like sleep wouldn’t dare touch him with a ten-foot pole. His eyes were red-rimmed, his lips were cracked, and his curly hair was messier than a rat’s nest.
Harry planted both his hands on Draco’s face, rubbing softly. Draco released his breath in a stuttering gasp.
Draco hadn’t brought it back up because he was afraid that he and Potter wanted different things- Draco couldn’t have a sexual relationship, and wasn't emotionally capable of one. If that was all Potter wanted, he didn’t know if he could handle that rejection. He also didn’t want to lose Potter as a friend, so he’d decided the best course of action was to shutter up and avoid the topic altogether.
Draco’s eyes were watering, much to his dismay. That was exactly what Mother had told him. “I . . . I don’t know if I can-”
“Right,” said Harry, “I know. But you seemed pretty upset when you saw her in the firecall, so I thought I’d-”
“Fuck you, Pansy,” Draco snarled. “You’re too caught up in your own life to give a shit about mine. Talking about how I’m putting my problems on you. Can’t you see that I’m trying to do the exact opposite? It’s not my fault you worm your way in and
Relieved at the subject change, Draco instantly snapped back into business mode. “We have a limit on how many of those we can administer.”
Draco shook his head. “There’s no point, Pans,” he said softly. Then, resigned, he decided to reveal the truth to everybody, having already been so humiliated that it was impossible to feel even worse.
And Harry kissed him. Draco’s mouth moved hungrily against his, and Harry wasted no time in wrapping an arm around his lithe waist, pulling him impossibly closer until their chests were flush and all Draco could feel was
“I know you don’t want him, Potter, you’ve made that quite clear,” growled Parkinson, pointing an accusing finger at him. “But right now you’ve got a job to do, because Draco needs you.”
Somehow, he had an intuition that Potter was too good for something like that, that he would never do that to Draco. But it still didn’t stop the doubt from creeping in.
Also i wanted to make something clear. After receiving some hate mail on ffn, I thought it important to share. If you're reading my stories of your own volition, minding the tags and everything, it isn't fair of you to get upset at the way things play out. No one's holding a gun to your head and forcing you to read my work. The fact that this has to even be said is sad, but hate will not be tolerated. There's a difference between constructive criticism and hate.
“Did you come over just to lecture me about spending time with my mother, or is there a real reason why you’re here?” Draco asked her harshly.
Draco took ten minutes, at least. He missed his expensive, fancy soaps and scrubs. Here, all he had was a tiny container for shampoo and an even tinier container for body wash. How was
Insecurity flared through him like a flame. Of course he was right. That was all Harry saw him as. But when he saw Harry’s eyes widen to the size of dinner plates, and step closer to Draco as though he had broken something precious, he wasn’t so sure.
“Incidentally,” continued Potter, “about a year after we broke up, I figured out I was into blokes as well as girls.”
Draco gasped, arching his back off the bed. Harry chuckled. “Normally, one isn’t enough for you because you like the burn, but it’s been a while, hasn’t it?”
If Harry was going to reject him and stomp all over his heart, the least he could do was look at him.
Draco’s reflection stared back at him in the mirror. Exhaustion clung onto his skin, clouding his eyes. He held up the bottle of pills he’d purchased at Tesco’s, examining the label.
It seemed to work, for Potter smiled at him as he removed his jumper, revealing a tan, hairy, muscled chest. Draco ached to touch, so he reached up and caressed the taut muscles and firm abdomen. Potter shuddered.
think it’s a waste, because ultimately it’s not what you want. You want stability, and peace, and calm, and I . . . I can’t give that to you.”
“I didn’t exactly want to announce it to the world!” said Draco. “It’s bad enough I have a soulmate who will never want me. I don’t need to be humiliated by my friends’ pity as well.”
He thought of Pansy. How they used to run and laugh around the gardens when they were children, without a care in the world. How little they knew how much their golden lives would burn to a blackened crisp.
“You know the hero, the Golden Boy, the famous saviour of the wizarding world,” Harry corrected him. “You don’t know
“Yeah,” Harry said. “This isn’t me trying to manipulate you or prove how much I love you or anything. I just genuinely think it will be a better experience all the way around if I go alone. She won’t feel cornered or ganged-up on.”
“You want to smooth things over so your next firecall won’t be awkward. You’re doing this for the sake of your cock, Harry.”
“I-I don’t know, I mean, wouldn’t we be seen? I can already read the headlines: Saviour of the wizarding world and questionable company, the Death Eater: a most unlikely match.”
of people’s lives,” Draco argued heatedly, sitting up straighter. “I help old people find books for their grandchildren. I recommend books I’ve read to people. I’m the gateway to people engaging in one of the healthiest habits there are.”
Harry laughed boisterously. “Don’t get me fooled, Draco. Don’t you still find me dashingly handsome? At least a little bit?”
“But I want to figure out who it is,” said Harry. “I already blocked my pathway to anyone I don’t know personally, and that narrows down the possible choices considerably. I just want to know who is going out of their way to talk to me.”
The first thing Draco felt was an ache in his stomach. This couldn’t be death- Death wasn’t this painful, was it? Could you feel pain in the afterlife?
Harry smiled. “I know we said nothing else can happen, and I’m okay with that,” he said. “But I’d really like to hold your hand and take a walk with you. If you’d like. And only if you like.”
“Whatever. Let’s pretend nothing’s wrong. Do you honestly, truly want to have sex with me tonight? When I firecalled you, you sounded as though you’d been crying.”
Draco insisted, and Harry glanced at his torso. After all these times they’d had sex, and he still wasn’t used to seeing the marks that he bore.
“You’ll be there with other patients. You can read a book, do a crossword puzzle or a word search. They even have a telly.”
“Try again,” Draco murmured on the third day that Harry mentioned it, wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist and planting a kiss to the back of his neck.
He wasn’t sure why he felt such an incessant need to prove to Potter that he was doing fine, that he wasn’t doing humiliating work. But he did. And it bothered him. A lot.
They kissed in earnest as Draco continued rocking his hips, and then Potter was saying, “Let me fuck you properly, baby. Lie down.”
One drizzling evening in May, because every evening in May was drizzling right now, Potter invited him over.
There wasn’t much to say, because Potter was absolutely right. He watched in dismay as he took another bite of his burger.
“It’s a him,” Harry said, “and yes you do. But before you get all excited, we’re only shagging. We aren’t in a relationship.”
“I wanted to tell you I’ve noticed a change in Harry. Since you two started dating. And I don’t think it’s a coincidence.”
Draco took a deep, shuddering breath, fingering the bandage on his wrist. How was he supposed to tell her about Pureblood society, and arranged marriages, and all his internalized homophobia? The war, the Dark Lord living in the manor, the mark, the torturing, all of it?
“Hey, I didn’t know what else to do, okay?” bellowed Harry. “I had just been told I was having a baby, and Ginny threatened to take my baby away from me. I didn’t know what else to
“Draco . . . You can’t be with him, not after what he did to you. You need to focus on getting better. On yourself.”
Scoffing, Pansy stood up, running a hand through her black bob. “You’re fooling yourself, Draco.” She apparated on the spot.
“It’s blue,” Draco answered. “Light blue, to be more precise. A pastel, baby blue like the sky but a little bit softer, like a sheet fresh out of the wash-”
When they reached the restaurant, Potter held the door open for Draco, whose heart began stuttering. When they sat at the bar, Potter ordered them two pints while Draco began perusing the menu.
“Of course,” Draco said lightly, forcing himself not to take Pansy’s prying words too seriously. “I’ll let him know soon.”
you talk about with your ex-nemesis that you’d suffered a war with? He took a generous sip of his drink, wincing at the bitter liquor coating his tongue.
“You’re the first person I’ve told,” said Harry. “I dunno why, but as soon as I quit I wanted to come here. And tell you.”
Harry soaked in Draco’s messed up hair from their earlier snogging session, his pale cheeks tinged pink, sparkling grey eyes full of life. He was walking art, golden, angelic, and it was
“What does it matter if I’m happy?” Draco asked miserably. “I’m a Death Eater- we don’t deserve to be happy.”
Harry was borderline begging. Draco was puzzled. His frazzled brain couldn’t keep up. Harry wanted him, then he didn’t, then he did, then he didn’t-
Harry’s hands found their place on his shoulders, pulling him in closer. Draco didn’t resist. Harry’s touches set him aflame, and right now he was burning alive.
“I’m trying to eat it, if you’ll let me,” Potter said through a mouth of burger, tossing him a wink. A
“We’ll do whatever you want,” Potter said, as the circles continued. “Take this as far or as slow as you want.”
“You’re doing so well, baby,” he said soothingly, prying Draco’s cheeks apart and thrusting his tongue back into the wet heat.
Draco nodded before he could stop himself, and Potter’s hands and lips were back on him before he could even breathe. This time, Draco opened his mouth and prodded his tongue at Potter’s lips, asking for entry. Potter eagerly granted it, and Draco took his time exploring every nook and cranny of Potter’s mouth, just like he’d dreamt about. Potter wrapped an arm around Draco’s waist and pulled him flush to his chest, splaying his fingers out across his lower back. Draco sighed into Potter’s mouth as Potter began fighting back into the kiss, and began kissing Draco with more ferocity, with more hunger, like how he wanted to be kissed.
“You don’t have to say it back,” Harry said gently, rubbing his stiffened hand again. “I just wanted to tell you because I think I’ve felt this way for quite a while.”
“You don’t know what he was like,” said Draco, unsure why he was so willing to defend Harry when Harry had taken his heart, crushed it into smithereens, and then danced all over the pieces.
“Take Ginny out of the picture. Pretend I didn’t fuck her. Then what?” Harry pressed, drawing him closer still. Draco suppressed a whimper.
“I didn’t know you preferred it like this, Draco,” said Harry, waiting for Draco to give him the go-ahead before moving. “You need to talk to me about these things, when we’re having sex.”
Draco knew he was being modest. Healing was one of the most rewarding jobs in the wizarding world, and everybody knew it. Few had the precise combination of skills and patience necessary to complete it.
Seeing him shaking and sobbing like a small child had broken something in Harry; how had he left Draco alone? Because he’d said one mean thing?
“Hermione and Ron are four months pregnant, actually,” Potter said, and Draco was frankly shocked he was revealing something so personal. He expected some small talk, something along the lines of “the usual” or “good, they’ve been just fine,” but not this. Never this.
that was of me, and I went back to his flat to fix it, but when I got there . . .” Harry drew another deep breath, locking eyes with Narcissa as her expression slowly morphed into horror. “He had gone and done it.”
“I’ll turn you on your front and open you up with my fingers, nice and slow, one by one until your entire body is shaking from the force of it. I’ll hit your sweet spot over and over and over again until you’re about to spill, and then just when you think you’re going to come, I’ll stop.”
Draco cut himself off with a strangled moan as ropes of searing hot come shot out of his cock, all over his tummy, thoroughly coating himself. He rode his orgasm out, twitching and crying out Harry’s name over and over again like a mantra, gasping for air and mouth parting open in a little o.
Draco thrummed his fingers on his other hand while he waited impatiently for the floo call to go through.
It was a cool, drizzling, April morning. The rain pattered on the roof of the Apothecary shop, thoroughly coating the windows and giving them a good wash. Draco had a feeling it was going to be a slow day; not many customers ventured out in the rain like this. He decided it would be an ideal day to catch up on inventory. His boss Joanna would be pleased.
“My day was a little more stressful than normal,” said Harry, “but one of my coworkers brought me lunch from my favorite deli shop, which made it slightly better.”
Harry reached down and palmed Draco’s aching erection, and he arched into his touch, purring softly.
“I know we were talking about something more serious earlier, but . . . I actually really do want to know your favorite color.”
“Soon,” Ginny answered, fiddling with her hair again, a nervous habit. “I reckon some will take it better than others.”
“Darling,” she said, and her voice sounded so shattered that Draco’s already battered heart was breaking all over again.
Harry continued to massage Draco’s scalp, eliciting various noises out of the blonde man, which caused his cock to twitch in spite of himself. Harry was ready for round two, but he had a feeling Draco would be spent after this.
But it was like the more he tried to think about it, the more the memories attacked him, bludgeoning his hippocampus one by one.
The pair made their way back to the sitting room, and Draco willed his hands not to shake. He was holding a hot beverage, after all. Piping hot.
The steaming cups were almost too hot to touch, but Harry desperately needed to calm his nerves, so he took a sip.
, and why was Potter telling him this? Did Potter trust him? There was no way Potter trusted him; they hadn’t even gotten to the main event of their meal. So why was Potter telling him all these things? Was it some sort of test? Was Draco passing?
in his flat right now, and the evening was actually going rather well. Now was not the time to ruin it with his stupid theatrics.
“First I’d get you out of your robes.” Harry swallowed thickly, opening his eyes, realizing he didn’t want to miss a second of Draco’s reaction to this.
“I know what I said, and here’s what I meant. I think talking to you is the right thing to do, because you’re upset and I want to know why. Not because someone is upset, but because
“Huh?” Harry asked sleepily, then his eyes landed on Draco and his entire stature relaxed. His face softened as he reached his arms out to touch him.
So Draco succumbed to the growing agony in his stomach that made him feel like he was going to explode. He cried out in pain as a particularly fierce cramp throbbed through him. This process wasn’t going to be instant and painless like he’d thought it would be. He was so, so naive.
something extremely personal. He didn’t think his heart was in good enough condition to keep up with the pace his love affairs were currently traveling at.
Harry pulled away from him. Draco couldn’t see him, but he imagined his lips to be coated with Draco’s come. The image made him convulse.
Ron seemed to relax a little, slumping back into his seat. “Mate, the way you were going on about him . . . Scared me for a minute that you were actually in love with him.”
“Well, you failed in that endeavor,” he said, all saccharine and sugary. He rolled the sleeves back on his arm again, and lifted it in front of the fire to show her.
Draco sighed. This conversation wasn’t going anywhere; Potter would stop responding, and would soon forget it even happened. He had to say something meaningful.
Harry snaked an arm around Draco’s tummy, pulling him flush so that they were back-to-chest. With another brutal thrust that slammed right in his prostate, Draco howled and threw his head back against Harry’s shoulder. The action seemed to encourage Harry, for he quickened his thrusts and began fucking Draco in earnest.
“Go as slow as you need, baby,” Potter said, and all these pet names were going to be what really drove Draco over the edge.
“They’re obviously too afraid to confront you head on,” said Ron. “But I think you should let this thing play out. Should be interesting.”
“I know it’s risky, and it could fracture everything we have, but I feel like it’s the right thing to do.”
“Fine, Potter,” Draco snarled out, standing up and stepping closer to the other man. “You don’t love me? That’s just fine.”
Harry walked inside, and Draco shut the door with trembling hands. Now was not a good time, it was really not a good time. His shoulders were shaking with the effort not to cry, and Draco had to bite his lip to keep it from wobbling.
“And why’s that?” asked Draco. “You made it quite clear how you feel about me, telling me I’m just a fuck and nothing more.”
. I’ve been in therapy for eight years and I still have a long way to go. I didn’t make nearly as much progress in a year as you have. You should look at yourself. You’ve accomplished so much this year. You should be really, really proud of yourself, because Merlin knows I am.”
“Well, we had one, Narcissa. And it was working, or appearing to be working, for a while. Then I messed up. Badly.”
of being the victim during the war, Draco. I don’t need that anymore. For you to even say that proves just how little you know about me.”
“Well, I couldn’t go around hating Muggles forever, now could I?” Draco said. “They’re actually rather fascinating, the way they come up with technology that seems almost as advanced as magic. Those little boxes with the moving portraits-”
He made himself a steaming cup of Earl Gray and waited for two more hours. Harry may have been unemployed, but he still had a life. He was sure to be busy, right?
“Do you have a good enough reason why you missed the first sonogram for our child?” Ginny asked him through the floo.
That cancerous concern was back in full swing, now. Harry gritted his teeth as he pulled out his wand and spelled the door open with a whispered
He half-hoped for Narcissa to wave aside his formal greeting and assure him that ‘Narcissa’ was fine, but of course, that didn’t happen.
Draco moaned as Harry reached down and palmed his cock, squeezing the hardening bulge in the exact way he knew Draco liked.
Once Draco had been transferred to the psychiatric unit, he was brought into a bathroom, of sorts, to strip and shower.
Pansy’s head collapsed into her hands. “Draco,” she said, looking back up at him, “we can’t keep having this same conversation.”
“I pushed you away,” Draco said wetly, fighting the tears in his eyes. “I know it’s wrong, and it isn’t fair, it’s just . . . Every time I look at you, I see
Draco was vaguely aware that he was shouting, and kicking, and thrashing his arms, but he couldn’t find it in himself to care. He was
“F-Fuck, Potter, I’m- I’m close,” he wailed, and Potter only hummed encouragingly around his cock, pulling up to suck a strip of precome out of his crown before swallowing its entirety again.
“Yours,” Draco agreed. He tilted his head back and let out a bellowing moan as Harry adjusted his angle and hit his prostate.
“So if you didn’t deserve to die then, then doesn’t that mean you deserve to find happiness and joy in your life now? Life is about more than just surviving, Draco.”
“Because we’re both incredibly difficult people who like to make things much harder on ourselves than necessary.”
Harry had to spend nearly thirty minutes consoling Draco on their way out the door that it was going to be okay, that he was forgiven by the Weasleys. He found Draco in the bathroom of Grimmauld, splashing water on his face, trembling violently, telling Harry profusely that he wasn’t going.
He leaned in for a kiss, which Draco happily granted him. When Harry pulled away from him, Draco looked dazed.
Once they were comfortably seated on the couch, Harry wrung his hands together while he waited for Narcissa to continue speaking.
“No way.” Draco toyed with the linen of his sheets as a means of calming down. “I want you out. Now.”
Harry sighed. “Yeah, pretty much. You can’t imagine how excited I was when I found out magic existed.”
, and took a big, hefty, generous bite. Some of the garlic aioli dripped from the bottom, and a couple pieces of onion fell out.
“Erm, Potter? Is there . . . Something else I can help you with?” Draco asked, feeling his heart begin to flutter rapidly in his ribcage. He found himself hanging onto Potter’s hypothetical answer in a vice grip like a child on a rope swing.
“Whoever it is, they can’t be that bad,” said Greg. “You don’t have any resentments toward anyone except Potter, and the universe wouldn’t be that cruel.”
Harry cut himself off with a choked sob, and he squeezed Draco’s hand tighter. “You made me better. I never told you, but you did. Even my friends noticed it. Once you open those beautiful eyes, you’ll get to hear it from them yourself. They forgive you, Draco.”
Potter was shaking his head, and Draco’s heart began to beat faster. “Malfoy, you’re as responsible for the war as I am.”
Startled, Draco fumbled with a ladle and set it down in the cauldron. He walked out from the back of his shop, and sure enough Harry was standing just within the frame of his door.
“Why are you rooting for us, anyway?” Draco asked. “You should be the angel on my shoulder, telling me to stay away.”
want to have this conversation, not here of all places. Conversations about the war usually led to an attack, and attacks weren’t ideal in public settings. But he couldn’t leave Potter’s question hanging, so he decided to bite the bullet and answer him.
“He’s not the same person he was in school,” said Harry, letting all the words out in one big whoosh. “He’s hiding out in the Muggle world because he’s afraid of coming back here. He works in a bookshop- a
“I . . . I just want you to know, Narcissa, that he’s going to be okay. I’m going to help him in any way I can.”
Harry sighed. “That’s not what I meant, Draco. What we have is amazing- I wouldn’t trade it for anything. It was just a question. I won’t bring it up again.”
“A cold, unfeeling machine who’s going to bend you over this table and fuck you so well you won’t walk right for a week.”
Annie looked puzzled. Had Draco said something wrong? But before he could ask her, she fired off another question.
with him. Just because I recognize his human side a little more than some people doesn’t mean I love him.”
Draco swallowed again. “Well, be that as it may, I wanted to talk to him first. Get to know him a little before I let him into my bed. But he, erm, well, he . . .” Talking was getting difficult. Draco’s shoulders were shaking with the effort not to cry.
“Draco,” Harry breathed, rushing to his side and taking his cold, clammy hand in his own. “I know you can’t hear me right now, but it doesn’t matter, because I’m gonna tell you all the same things as soon as you wake up. And as many times as you need to hear them until you believe me. I’m not leaving you ever again. I’m gonna stick to your side like glue, and you’re gonna get so sick of me you’ll wish you could wack me with a bludger.
slow, he realized with a pang in his chest, he wanted Potter to climb all over him and consume him in every which way, and Potter was breathing heavily, stroking Draco’s cheek, then softly tucking a stray strand of golden hair behind his ear.
