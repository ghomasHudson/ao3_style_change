“Magical portraits capture a bit of your essence. The magic relies on who you are when the portrait is being made, your magical core and energy; the artist weaves that into the portrait. But if you make a portrait after one’s death, there isn’t much to draw from. They’re often based on Pensieve memories from family and loved ones, but memories are rarely completely accurate and are often biased, as they’re from someone else’s perspective. I highly doubt this portrait is an accurate depiction of the real Claudia.”
“You know exactly what. I know Malfoy’s a prat, but he’s been keeping his head down. Just leave it alone.”
Hello all! This is the first chapter to The Strange & Marvelous Story of Our Revival! Here's some important info:
Before he knew what he was doing, Harry was kneeling beside Malfoy’s chair and reaching out to him, pulling him in by the shoulders until Malfoy fell to the floor and into Harry’s arms.
had read about botany when he was a child. He had been fascinated. He had been fascinated about everything; everything had been so exciting to him when he was young. He had wanted to know everything there was to know.
“Malfoy,” said Potter, spotting him from his cubicle and standing.
Draco walks over to him and held a hand out to Potter. Potter eyed it for a moment, looking somewhat surprised, and then took it, letting Draco help him up.
Granger was making good points, but Draco was distracted by a sudden lightness in his stomach. He wouldn’t have even thought of researching it if it weren’t for Violet and Daphne, but this directly affected
“What?” Ron demanded. “If there’s a
“I need to go to Hogsmeade this week,” Draco began carefully, monitoring Theo’s face for his reaction. “I have to pick up a gift for Mother. Would you like to join me?”
Violet gave a little sigh.
“Well, I wouldn’t want to assume,” she began diplomatically, but Harry just narrowed his eyes at her. “Oh, alright. People always said I liked my Quidditch players, but I think you do more so than me. Particularly Quidditch players that can actually
“They’re sort of like…Muggle psychologists, but for wizards and witches. You know what psychologists are, right?”
“We move on, but we don’t forget,” Potter was saying. Draco could hear the slight clench in his teeth, how tightly he held his jaw. “We continue to fight, to strive to build the world that so many fought for, that so many died for.”
Potter gaped at him, as though in disbelief that Draco had just complimented him, though of course, Draco had wrapped it in an insult, because that seemed to be the only way he was able to communicate with Potter.
“Absolutely,” confirmed Ashworth. “I’ll mentor you myself. I’d like for you to also train with Waya some, there is a lot you could learn from him.”
“It’s beautiful,” he said, honestly.
“Harry!” she replied, smiling widely.
“Yes, I remember you never explained what caused the letters to stop,” Hermione added.
“No! I mean, I—” Harry looked to Hermione desperately for help.
“No!” said Potter, rather loudly, causing some other Aurors to look over at them. He continued in a normal volume. “I mean, no, that isn’t what I meant. Honestly, she’s kind of…”
“Huh?”
“Does she?” Draco said, in a flat tone.
“Don’t you worry,” said Malfoy, giving him another smile. “I’m going to take good care of you.”
Potter’s aversion to the press was obvious; anyone who met him more than once could see he was uncomfortable being fawned over and photographed, and didn’t trust reporters with any information, usually choosing to let Draco make any sort of comment regarding a case, or else let the PR people handle it.
“Yeah, that’s how I’ve been about it, too,” Potter said, casually, and Draco was stuck again by one of those abrupt realizations of how bizarre everything now was. Here he was, sitting with Potter, having a perfectly calm conversation about Quidditch. What had the world come to?

it’s cold,” Draco muttered through gritted teeth, digging through a desk drawer in search of change. The owl dropped the Prophet on the desk and stood there, pouch tied to its talons, waiting.
“What do you say then, old chap?” Theo said, clapping Draco on the back and squeezing his shoulder. “Fancy a Butterbeer?”
“You know better than anyone how much work the trainees need to be getting. You were trying to get as many classes as you could when you were training.”
Hermione shrugged.
They seemed to come and go—for several nights, he would have a restful, dreamless sleep, and then suddenly, the next night, he would jolt awake in a cold sweat, reaching for his wand in the darkness.
He wasn’t going to start feeling any empathy for Lucius Malfoy any time soon, but with a glance over at the Slytherin table, he felt slightly ashamed for having assumed Malfoy was up to something again.
Harry let out a caw.
Pansy rolled her eyes.
Potter gave a curt nod and turned back to Ella.
“No, of course not,” sighed Potter. “I wasn’t even thinking, it was just automatic, like a reflex. And now they’re all handling me with kid gloves, all smiles and ‘Yes, Harry,’ ‘Great thinking, Harry!’ as if I’m a toddler that could dissolve into a tantrum at any minute.”
Harry blinked again. Then, with a smile slowly growing on his face, he realized that yes, yes, he had actually slept, and he didn’t have a single nightmare.
“What?”
“About what?”
“I thought the Slytherins were all helping the Carrows. Torturing first years and everything.”
Hermione’s voice stayed constant, giving orders, and settling to a soft hum in Harry’s ears.
On a daily basis, there were numerous moments that quite glaringly reminded Draco of how wildly different his life had become this year. Every conversation he had with Violet—especially those regarding her Muggle Studies class and apprenticeship—was one of these moments, but as he sat, cross-legged, on the dirty ground of the clearing in the middle of the Forbidden Forest, with an adolescent Thestral’s head in his lap, stroking its silky mane and listening as Luna Lovegood dreamily recounted what she was learning about modern magical art, he briefly wondered if perhaps he had been transported to a parallel dimension.
still on probation—but he hadn’t entertained the thought that he would be returning to Hogwarts this year.
“Mr Potter, do come in,” Ashworth opened the door wider and welcomed him into his office. Harry walked in, taking in the room around him.
He turned on his heel and started to walk out of the room.
He was not expecting to find Draco Malfoy on his doorstep.
“No way,” Malfoy said in a low voice. Harry hopped on the letter again.
Harry fell into an armchair and buried his face in his hands.
“So?” Ron replied after a loud swallow. “We were on the run last year. Eating nuts and fish bones and Merlin knows what.”
“I’m tired, I think I’m going to go to bed.”
Draco entered the common room feeling light and—dare he say it—happy. Spending time with Potter did that to him, and he tried not to think about that fact too much, lest it ruin the good mood he was in.
. Draco could understand that. He could even relate—the loss of control in his own life led him to be capable of things he never thought he could be.
“Luna?” he asked quietly, after a brief lull in conversation fell between them. She turned her head and fixed her wide eyes at him.
“Harry,” he said. “You called me Harry, you can’t take it back now.”
Granger’s head shot up and she cast wild brown eyes at him. The intensity in them was so strong, Draco almost took a step backwards.
“All the Houses have been suffering,” he said, shortly. “We just fought a war.”
“Why the Magpies? Were you a fan? I thought you were a Cannons fan.”
Draco had acted without thinking, his wand practically flying as he cast healing spell after healing spell. By the time he was done, Luna had retained a few scars but looked monumentally better, no longer bleeding.
“Oh,” he said, remembering the day before. “It was…weirdly normal. We mainly just watched the game. It was odd though, rooting for the same team as Malfoy.”
Ashworth’s face was serious now, and he nodded, thoughtfully.
“Er, sure, how come?”
Malfoy had stood up from his shared table with Zabini and Nott and moved to the next table over, but hadn’t taken a seat yet.
“Wandlore.”
That caught Potter’s attention as well.
“Busy,” said Draco. “Season’s only just coming to an end. And you?”
The girl stepped forward, providing her name to Waya when asked.
“No wonder there were so many Wrackspurts around you this morning,” Luna nodded wisely.
He waited for a moment, to see if she would ask, but she stayed silent, waiting for him to elaborate.
“No, I haven’t,” Ashworth said with a slight shake of his head. “When I finished at Hogwarts, I was recruited by the Arrows and played with them for a few years, until I took a Bludger to the knee and had to retire.”
“What have they been about?” she asked, in a quieter tone.
Malfoy turned around, but his face was still shuttered and stern.
They kissed and kissed and kissed, and every time Draco broke away for air, Harry just continued kissing him, on his cheeks, his nose, his neck. His hands gripped at Draco’s waist and pulled him closer, and Draco tried to angle his hips away, but after a while, it was pointless to pretend he wasn’t extremely aroused.
Harry felt like he was waiting for the other shoe to drop. Harry had been happy to leave their rivalry back at Hogwarts, and they had shared a stilted handshake after Harry had spoken at his trial, but they had never actually sat down and had a proper conversation. Malf—Draco had always been arrogant and conceited, taking any opportunity to talk himself up and others down. Harry had never seen him exhibit this much interest in getting to know someone else. The fact that Draco wasn’t spitting out an insult with every reply was still taking Harry aback.
Draco watched the baby Thestrals run up to their mothers, who leaned down and nuzzled them, their glossy dark skin almost shining.
Harry emitted another cawing sound as Malfoy dripped a liquid of some sort onto his wing. It
“Relax, Potter. I’m teasing.”
“That’s none of your business,” Draco retorted, automatically. Responding to Potter with snark almost seemed like a basic instinct at this point.
Draco just hoped his subconscious wouldn’t land him in more trouble.
Draco found himself slipping easily back into his obsession with Potter, something he had tried to avoid earlier on. As the time loop continued, he couldn’t be bothered holding himself back anymore, truly, what did he have to lose?
together?”
“Should I ask how it went?”
Everything—his whole life since he had just turned fifteen and Voldemort had returned—had been an intense pressure on him, like a boulder had been dropped on his chest, and all this time, his only goal had been just barely lifting it so it didn’t pierce his lungs or stop his heart. And now the weight had lifted, so he should be
“Nice speech,” Draco said, half-heartedly. He hated what Potter had done to him, how Draco wanted to be
As annoying as Draco still found him, the man was practically a war hero now and now that Draco actually got along with Potter, antagonizing his best friend wasn’t exactly the smartest move.

Instead, he went next door, searching for Luna.

“Malfoy is,” Ernie argued.
Furiously, Draco looked at Potter. He wasn’t exactly sure why, but wasn’t Potter the one always going on about the war being over and the fighting being behind them? He found himself angered even further when he saw Potter was simply gazing out the window, as if blind to what was occurring right in front of him.
Draco nodded, watching as Theo began to carefully spoon the potion into a glass vial.
“Right now, you are my problem. Pass the horned thimbleweed.”
Harry stared at him, and Draco seemed to realise he was particularly close to Harry. He withdrew his finger as though it had been burned.
He flew for a few recruiters, and even before he got any offers, he felt a thrilling sense of relief—this felt right, it felt good. He had forgotten how it felt to fly, at least without someone chasing him.
“I did go by Lucky during my Quidditch days, however Professor McGonagall has rather strongly insisted I instruct you to address me as Professor Ashworth.”
Everyone applauded after Potter’s speech, which felt odd to Draco. It didn’t seem like an occasion to clap for.
He didn’t know why, but Harry still found himself rather reluctant when it came time to handing over the hawthorn wand to Malfoy. Perhaps it was the years of enmity between them that made Harry’s instincts go against handing over a weapon or perhaps because he still felt an odd fondness for the hawthorn wand; either way, Harry felt a strange pulling sensation in his stomach as he reached out to hand the wand to Draco.
Demelza beamed.
There was a long, sharp intake of breath, and then Malfoy seemed to crumple, his shoulders dropping and the tension in his body fading as he relaxed into Harry’s arms. He lifted shaking arms and clutched at the back of Harry’s shirt as his body shook with dry sobs.
Harry sat there, unsure what to say. He felt as though his world had been shaken today, and here he was, having pictures taken of him during this existential realisation.
Hermione still looked somewhat worried, but she nodded slowly.
her. She was still a bossy know-it-all who brown-nosed all the professors, and
Malfoy, but Harry felt it in every part of him.
He was repeating a lot of information they had covered previously, but sounded like he was building up to something, so Draco remained silent and listened. When Ollivander paused, and looked off to the distance, Draco realized he had been holding his breath.
“He’s going back to the Manor for Easter,” he said. “He hasn’t been since the summer.”
“You didn’t seem to think so at the time,” responded Draco. Potter just blinked at him.
“Harry,” Ginny finally said, with raised eyebrows. “You said you wanted my advice. Are you going to tell me what’s going on or not?”
Sometimes, though, he was tempted. Tempted to venture into the lion’s den, see Potter in his natural habitat. Draco imagined he must thrive there. He was often accredited with big takedowns and arrests, his name splashed across the Prophet even if they did struggle to get a photograph of him.
“That she was cursed with Dark—” Harry started, cutting off when another thought floated to his mind.
“As you may know, I previously taught Defence Against the Dark Arts at Ilvermorny. I myself attended there as a youth. I know you have been through several professors in your years here at Hogwarts, so I think for our first few days together, we will go through some review work based on my curriculum for the years below you. Once I have a grasp on where we are as a class, we’ll get started on the good stuff. Any questions?”
“You’re nervous,” he stated. It was clearly not meant as a question, but Draco nodded anyway.
“Good question,” he nodded at her. “I first started teaching at small schools in northern England, and I did a brief stint at the Academy of Broom Flying. Then I applied for a position at Beauxbatons and worked there for about seven years, before moving to Uagadou. I spent the next eleven years there, and the rest, as they say, is history, and here I am today.”
“I suppose,” he said, tentatively. “Why?”
“Rivers?”
He expected to be called a name again, but Potter just offered a grim smile.
“Have you been to see Madam Pomfrey?”
“Can I see it?” she asked, her casual tone of voice not at all betraying how serious of a question she was asking. Draco felt an unpleasant chill pool in his stomach, the way it always did when he thought about his Mark.
“Sleep well.”
“Model’s here,” she said. “He must have Flooed directly into the dressing room. I should go check in and introduce myself. Have we got anything viable on the individual shots?”
He felt like he was being pushed underwater, his throat constricting and his breath speeding up. His stomach began churning at once and he almost pulled his arm back with regret.
“I know it seems really sudden,” she said. “But it’s like all the pieces came into focus and let us see the bigger picture. Your first love is…well, it’s powerful. And it holds on to you. And I think, during the war, we needed that. I needed to hold onto this hope that Ron would come back, when he left. And I think he needed to hold on to the hope that I was waiting for him. And in the Battle, it felt like…it felt like the culmination of our entire lives here at Hogwarts. It felt like it was the apex, we threw everything into it. I fought the hardest I’ve ever fought during the Battle. So…it only makes sense that I would love just as hard, doesn’t it? But that was the peak for me and Ron, I think, that was the most it’s ever going to be. I think we both felt like…like it was the end of the world. One way or another, we felt like everything was going to
“I’m going to take a look at that wound,” said the man’s voice, and Harry turned his head again to look at his would-be rescuer. If he were in his human form, he would’ve gasped. Looking down at him, with an expression of deep concern, was Draco Malfoy.
Just a minute ago, Harry had been cutting the Biting Nettle and Malfoy had looked at the plant, then looked up at Harry, and said, in a patient but somewhat tired voice, “Potter, what is that you’re cutting?”
“Yeah, but you know Ginny. She loves bossing people around, but only when it’s not actually her job,” Rob shrugged.
“Nathaniel,” he began, but Nathaniel lifted a hand, quieting him quicker than a Silencio.
“Just making sure,” he replied, his heart sinking.
He smiled back at her. He loved Ginny, he always would, but she was right, they
“Corner just took him out, Robards is outside with the Portkeys.” Chang paused and looked at them. “Are you two alright?”
“Yes. Your Quidditch talent is no secret. The whole Wizarding World saw the way you flew in the Triwizard Tournament. Rumour has it you even impressed Viktor Krum. You were Captain of the Gryffindor team two years back as well, weren’t you?”
“Hi, Draco,” she replied, smiling. Then, a bit more shyly, “Hello again, Harry.”
“Of course,” said Granger, shaking her head. “Well, then, there’s only one thing to do.”
He checked his watch.
“I, er, I never really thought about it, Professor,” he said, truthfully.
“Oh, fuck you,” Draco exclaimed, surprising Harry so much he just barked out a laugh.
“Hey, Neville,” he said, yawning widely. Neville looked up at him in surprise and then smiled.
The books were practically impossible to get through, with some parts almost looking as though they were in another language, and Draco had the feeling he was missing a substantial amount of background information needed to understand them. He had asked Violet to take a look at them, but she’d frowned at the book and then shook her head.

“What about Transfiguration?” McGonagall went on. “I seem to recall you did rather well in my classes as well.”
“Who were you rooting for?” she asked, which was unlike Hermione, who normally couldn’t care less about Quidditch.
“Yeah,” Draco murmured, without even realizing what he was saying. “Yeah, it is.”
Harry wanted to ask what a magical core was, but he suspected that would lead into a tangent, and he was more curious to know about the wand.
“I’m certain I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Jamison replied smoothly.
“But it’s yours.”
“You don’t have to worry about me, Harry,” she said. “I actually think Sophie and Ron are a good match. They’re very similar, you know.”
“Someone named D. Black; she didn’t know him, do you?”
Narcissa had been resolute.
“The Department of Mysteries!” Granger exclaimed. “You know, this is what I’ve been saying for
“Yes! I mean, no! I mean, I dunno,” Potter’s shoulders slumped. “It’s just…weird, seeing you like this. Normally, you’d be coming up behind me and making fun of my hair or something.”
“What is going on in your head, Potter?” asked Draco.
“Of course,” said Harry.
“It’s good,” said Hermione, smiling. “It shows he’s willing to get back into contact.”
Harry gave him a look. He thought for a moment that he’d be much more comfortable talking about this with McGonagall, but there was also something nice about having someone completely new. Though doubtlessly he knew who Harry was, he didn’t
That thought hadn’t even occurred to him, truth be told, although of course there had been a few comments here and there when he and Ginny had been together about how similar they looked to James and Lily, most of which had been by Remus and Molly.
“Second in the class,” Draco corrected with a smirk. “Don’t forget about Granger.”
to start being more careful about it. Several of the secrecy spells associated with his apprenticeship barred him from revealing certain secrets, even if he wanted to, however even certain things that weren’t exceptionally confidential, Ollivander had recommended he keep to himself for the safety and the preservation of the craft. He pondered over how much he could comfortably disclose to Potter.
“Okay, so the main idea here is that energy always exists, right?” He was leaning so close to the table that he kept having to push his shoulder-length hair back behind his ears. “You can’t create new energy or destroy it, you can only change its form. That idea is called the law of conservation of energy. It’s a little more complicated, but that’s the gist of it. Muggles classify different forms or types of energy and how they can go through transformations; so, for instance, there’s sound energy, which of course relates to sound and vibrations, and there’s thermal energy, which is in essence just heat. The way Muggles explain it is that thermal energy comes from a rise in temperature, which causes an object’s atoms to vibrate at a higher frequency and—” he took a look at Draco’s face and paused. “Okay, you have no idea what I’m saying.”
desired
“What’s wrong with that?” asked Potter, and Draco had half a mind to hex him.
“Thursday’s good,” he said, shoving his hands in his pockets. “How is it going with Ollivander, by the way?”
Harry entered Grimmauld Place to hear mumbling coming from the room next to the front entrance. He poked his head through the doorway to find Hermione seated at the dining table, poring over a vast array of parchment that looked blank to Harry, but that he knew had encrypted information on it.
“Oh, go on then, Wilkins, give us a smile,” came another familiar voice from Harry’s left. “Such a
“Miss Granger?”
but Draco could’ve sworn that Potter went pink in the face again.
“You’re right,” Harry said, feeling a rush of motivation and confidence. “It’s just a cup of tea. I can do it.”
“I…I dunno, really,” Potter stumbled, looking down at his hands and wringing his fingers distractingly. “I just…we shook hands after…after your trial and I thought…I dunno. But this year, you’ve been so…quiet and subdued and just letting people hex you without a response and it’s not like you.”
After a moment’s pause, Ron groaned.
“Bugger, he must have already gone,” said Ron, quickly reaching for his pumpkin juice and glugging down as much as possible before letting out a hollow belch. “See you later!”
“Hmm,” Hermione’s bushy eyebrows drew in thought. “What about Demelza Robins? You know her from Quidditch, right?”
“I—” he began to apologise, but Potter cut him off.
Draco had been rather overwhelmed by this, and had nearly lost his composure as the Thestral had pushed its head under his hand and nestled in his lap. By now, however, it had happened enough times that Draco was used to it, and he was always pleased to see the animal.
Potter brightened, looking at Draco in surprise.
He shoved the Prophet back towards the owl, which glared at him, but grasped the paper back in its talons and turned back towards the window. Draco let it out and it gave him a final peck on the hand before departing.
“Yes,” he snapped. “You can manage labelling the cauldron with our names, can’t you? Wonderful.”
“I’m not actually studying Transfiguration with McGonagall.”
“No, thank you. I’m fine. I know they’re supposed to be frightening. I’m sorry I couldn’t cast the spell.”
Potter merely shrugged, charming his drawing to move back and forth on the parchment.
Harry grinned at him. Ron could always be counted on to cheer him up.
Eventually, it happened. He transformed.
“Yeah,” Harry paused, gathering his thoughts and trying to figure out what was the best way to phrase what he wanted to say. “I like to take time to myself and think about things, and the journal you suggested helps more than I thought it would. But I know staying in my room in the dark isn’t the healthiest thing, so I’ve been trying to go out and write somewhere else. There’s a Muggle park near the house I like to go to, although this café I loved in the area recently closed.”
So here he was in Sugarplum’s, trying to soak in a bit of comfort before he went charging into the lion’s den—or the snake’s, perhaps, to be more accurate.
Harry didn’t want to admit that this was the first time he was hearing the word ‘bisexuality,’ so instead, he just nodded.
It was all just too
Draco checked his watch, the pale grey dial softly glimmering in the fading afternoon light streaming through the window, and frowned slightly. Ollivander had been due through the Floo almost fifteen minutes ago. He was always punctual, one of the many things Draco liked about him. However, he was also quite old, so perhaps it had just slipped his mind.
Harry wasn’t sure when Hermione had become friends with Sophie—she had never been particularly close to the other Gryffindor girls before—but he was glad for her, remembering how happy she always was whenever they were at the Burrow and she got to spend time with Ginny.
Convinced, each day, that it was the last time, Draco refrained from doing anything that would put his job in jeopardy, but he didn’t know how much longer he could keep that up. It was exhausting, tolerating Finchley’s comments again and again, and masquerading to Eleanor so that she’d get the bloody reports signed by the Aurors. He hated it. He already didn’t exactly enjoy his job, it was repetitive and boring as it was, without this insane time loop business.
“Oh, yes, you’re right,” Harry said, a grin forming on his face. “Ginny the Quidditch Star, she’s far too special to be compared with us mere mortals!”
“Wha—What?” Ernie stuttered, seemingly blown away.
Cordelia was also a skilled violinist, and spoke of music as though it were another of her many languages. Draco had heard her play once, at a formal event the Greengrass family had held, and it was like the music just seemed to flow out of her, as natural as breathing. And then, of course, there was her baking, which she swore was nothing more than a hobby, but which always tasted like perfection to Draco’s taste buds.
“It’s never enough,” he had spat, pacing. “Every day, it’s something else. A speech, a picture, an interview. I came out of a bloody
“Is that something you think you might like to pursue?”
Harry turned his head cautiously, looking for the owl. Finally he found it, having flown into its open cage on a cabinet across the room. Its orange eyes were still watching him beadily.
“I brought you some strawberry toffee,” she said, her brown eyes twinkling as she pressed a glass container into his hands.
“I’d like that.”
There was a little twinkle in his eye and he looked over at Harry, who tried his best not to make eye contact.
“I avoided approaching the boggart because I didn’t want to expose the class to a dead body. But you children have lived through a war. We can’t expect them all to be spiders, can we?”
What was the
“Oh,” Harry said. “I’m sorry.”
Jamison looked very much like he wanted to curse Granger, and Draco could see Potter’s hand slowly moving towards his wand holster, but then Jamison just snarled.
Chatter quickly surrounded the table, everyone feeling warm and happy, and the mood was infectious. Harry soon found himself listening attentively to Dean and Parvati’s discussion about their deadlines over at the Prophet, before becoming distracted and joining in as Ron and Ginny heatedly debated which Quidditch teams had a chance at winning the League Cup.
“You know what I meant,” she said, her eyes rolling.
“Well, you can’t expect it to the first time around! You gotta practice, that’s all. This is a big step, Malfoy, good job.”
Draco felt his body release tension he hadn’t even realized he’d been holding.
at every corner I turn, with something to say! ‘Not as mouthy without your bodyguards, Malfoy!’ ‘Better run before the Muggleborns curse you, Malfoy!’ ‘You’re exactly like your

“But marigold,” Draco murmured, looking at the flower with a mixture of frustration and fondness. It
“War’s over,” Draco repeated, mostly to himself, before looking back up at Potter. “So you’re saying all this time while you’ve been harassing me, it’s been a tactic to get me to be friends with you.”
Actually, maybe it was all Renee’s fault.
“Are you
“Of course. I daresay you will have one of the most experienced mentors of all. Garrick Ollivander himself has agreed to oversee your apprenticeship.”
Harry stared at him.

“Of course not! It’s maddening! But I don’t know what I’m supposed to do about it.”
Harry looked at Ron, waiting for him to confirm or deny this.
“Never mind. Not the kind of letter I want to send.”
“Honestly, Malfoy, I have no clue. Maybe she likes your pointiness. Maybe she can smell that you’re a Slytherin.”
“That’s not true!” Potter finally got out. “I can’t do Occlumency like you can!”
“I wonder where we’ll be staying,” Ron voiced, and everyone turned to look at him.
“You alright, Draco?” came Violet’s voice, and a warm hand on his shoulder. Draco shook himself from his reverie, and smiled up at her.
Before Harry and Ron could begin discussing what could’ve possibly possessed Malfoy to think it was a good idea to come back to school, McGonagall had begun speaking again.
He had asked her about it once, mentioning how excited she had seemed while talking to him, and Hermione had flushed slightly, but said, “Oliver and I were just discussing precedent for establishing elvish welfare in wizarding law, Harry,” as if that somehow discounted anything he had said.
Draco raised his eyebrows at her, but that did nothing to stop her.
“Is there a field of study that you wish to pursue, Mr Malfoy?” McGonagall asked, coolly. Draco blinked at her.
“I beg your pardon?” Draco raised his eyebrows at him. Not that he was particularly proud of the moment, but he distinctly remembered being in the midst of casting the Cruciatus.
with deeply personal, private information about himself. Information that, prior to this year, not a living soul outside of the Malfoy family had known. And suddenly, it was out there, and he had to simply
“Nadine Bellmore tried to confront Ginny about it. Threw a hex at her and everything.”
Harry downed his glass.
A loud shuffling of stone interrupted them and they all turned to see the bricks of the entrance to the common room unfolding to reveal a gaggle of Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs—among them, Draco noticed immediately, Potter and Weasley.
“What do you care if I like blokes?” Potter burst out, his hands flying up in the air. “
“What? What do you mean?”
affairs?”
Perhaps spending time with Luna Lovegood was having some sort of effect on him, because Draco did something spectacularly odd—he smiled back.
“I’m sorry for just showing up like that,” said Potter, voice quiet.
“Could be worse,” he said, and allowed himself a grin as he looked at the other boys. “I could be rooming with the Hufflepuffs.”
the Chosen One, so who would dare?

“If we’re going to do this,” she had said, seriously. “We have to do it the right way. There are a
“Let me hug you,” he said.
“Mhm.” Draco nodded, remaining standing with his hands in his pockets. Potter fidgeted uncomfortably, shifting balance from one foot to another.
“Yer visitin’ the Thestrals?” Hagrid asked, looking entirely confused. Armstrong chose that exact moment to nudge his head against Draco’s arm and Draco instinctively scratched at the creature’s skeletal nose.
“What is it?” he asked, desperately. “Can I get out of it?”
Gregorovitch had come from a family of wandmakers. He had also read about Kinta Wolfe, the granddaughter of the famous Native American wandmaker Shikoba Wolfe, and Alejandro Allegretto, the latest in a long line of successful Argentinian wandmakers.
The small scarlet flag came zooming towards him. Waya nodded once again.
There was a pause as Potter seemed to digest this.  Then he faced Draco again, looking confused.
Draco walks over to him and held a hand out to Potter. Potter eyed it for a moment, looking somewhat surprised, and then took it, letting Draco help him up.
“I hadn’t known at first either.”
“Is it that obvious?”
“Not that I’m typically one to defend the Weasel, but if you threw me into a table, I’d be reasonably ticked off at you as well.”
“You weren’t,” Potter interrupted.
Draco pondered this. It was a stark difference to how Draco himself felt, as he was constantly reminded of the war being over, what with how he and his fellow Slytherins were being treated, but also with how he himself had changed, spending time with people like Luna Lovegood and Violet and
“Sorry, mate.”
“Yes. From what I can tell.”
“Sit, Mr Malfoy, sit,” Slughorn encouraged from his place on an olive green velvet armchair.
“Today we will be brewing

are.”
“Ah! Your sister was in my previous class. Talented young woman, a firecracker!” Waya said warmly, clapping a hand on Ron’s shoulder. “Alright, Ron, I assume you’ve faced a boggart before.”
“Mother wrote the other day,” Malfoy explained. “If I wait too long, she starts to worry.”
“Work, mostly,” said Draco, shortly. “You heard about Ollivander.”
him, Potter knew first-hand how cruel Draco could be, how little humanity he treated people with.
“Speaking of,” Blaise went on. “How’s your mother doing, Draco? Mine was asking after her the other day.”
Armstrong huffed softly and returned to eating the meat upon the ground.
Potter remained quiet, seemingly waiting for him to explain.
things about him and yet never pushed him to tell her more than he was comfortable with. There was Theo, with whom he had entrusted the knowledge of his apprenticeship, someone who perhaps didn’t talk as much as the girls, but always had a smile for Draco. Daphne and Blaise were far friendlier to him this year as well, now that he wasn’t as atrocious a bully as he had always been.
Harry grinned.
“It is a valuable skill to learn, and while I usually recommend it is taught to children from a young age so they have longer to become accustomed to it, I am aware that you are a highly unusual wizard. I have hoped for many years that Hogwarts would begin teaching more wandless magic, and I think you would be the perfect choice to introduce it.”
He used to be like that. It was only by spending time with people like Violet and Luna and Ella that he became gentler; softer. Kinder, both to others and to himself. He was privileged to have such friendships. Not everyone did.
in front of me in an empty corridor? You think they’d fucking
No one had seen it in a long time. In fact, the only one who had seen it since Draco had taken a knife to his skin had been Polkey, who had caught him in the act.
“Yeah, she’s the one who finally got me to realise I was burned out,” Harry admitted. He didn’t know why he was suddenly divulging all of this personal information, but it just came so easily. He tried to ignore the voice in the back of his head that was practically screaming at him that he had
“You know, he broke into the Ministry with Potter and the lot of them our fifth year.”
It was a project—a mission—and Harry poured himself into it. The days that they each first achieved their form were monumental. Surprising everyone, Ron was the first to achieve it in one of their practice sessions, morphing into a little red squirrel. Hermione had clapped a hand over her mouth to keep from snickering, and then walked him through the steps to change back.
“How was it?” she asked, her volume going down to match his.
“Draco,” came a soft voice, snapping him back to reality. He looked up to see Luna peering at him from his left side.
There was another pause as Ollivander seemed lost in thought. Draco felt like his heart was beating somewhat faster. He didn’t know where Ollivander was going with this, but he was desperate to. He hadn’t really been able to follow Potter’s speech to the Dark Lord about the Elder Wand during the Battle, it wasn’t as if that was where his full attention was focused, but he wanted to understand. He wanted to know how it was possible that
“Ingenious. Simply ingenious, my boy! Take ten points for Slytherin. Class, I want you to come see this. Everyone, put a Stasis Charm on your potions and gather round.”
“Thank you for the drink,” he said, and nodded before walking away from the table. His mother would have been appalled at his manners, but he felt the uncomfortable sting of tears building up before his eyes, and Pansy was not the person he wanted to be around in this emotional state.
He knew Seamus was angry. He knew Seamus had every
After a particularly brutal nightmare that broke through the heavy Silencing Charms he’d cast around his bed woke Ron, who immediately came over to check that he was alright, he decided to follow Hermione’s advice and go see Madam Pomfrey.
“There’s no getting out of that, is there?” she asked, sounding morose.
“Then we’ll get you a new one,” she’d answered simply, and turned sharply to leave his room, a cloud of dust settling in her wake.
“The entrance to your common room in the Founder’s Tower is behind a wall-mounted sixteenth century Persian rug, next to the portrait of Lady Kellestra. The current password is
Hermione crinkled her nose, while Sophie snorted.
They did often end up at an impasse, though, as Hermione was restricted from talking about a lot of her work, Ron couldn’t discuss active cases, and Sophie couldn’t break Healer-patient confidentiality, even as a Mediwitch.
ask you for more, depending on the success of the releases, but you’re not mandated to agree to those if you don’t want to. I think it’s a pretty generous deal, all in all.”
It had been hatred at first—anger at being snubbed that evolved into steady dislike as the hostility between them increased in magnitude. Underneath it all had surged a feeling of envy and hurt pride. He would lash out at Potter’s friends, because he had chosen them over him, and the more he told himself it was for other reasons—Weasley’s poverty, Granger’s blood status—the more he believed it.
to him.
no one would know!” she cried, sounding far too delighted.
Hermione gave her a comforting pat on the arm.
“I may or may not have gotten catastrophically drunk with Neville Longbottom once.”
“They? Who’s they?” he asked, impatiently. Someone needed to explain what was going on, right away.
Daphne and Violet both seemed to realize he was having some sort of internal crisis, as they mercifully changed the subject.
“Come sit, we’ve just ordered the first round,” said Ginny, grabbing him by the wrist and leading him to the largest table in the pub, over in the corner, the one they always frequented.
, Ron,” Granger rolled her eyes at him, but Draco saw she made no moves to indicate she was going to vacate her chair. She turned back to him. “What is it, Malfoy?”
“I mentioned what I’d read in your book about Muggle symbolism being related to wand trees and he told me that that was a lot more common than many people realized, that a lot of Muggle ideas on imagery have their roots in magic. And it reminded me of some books on Magical Botany I had read when I was young, about the use of flowers in potions and about what they represent in magical culture. I know a lot about Magical Botany actually, and it had me thinking, what if Muggle symbolism of flowers was similar?”
“Violet Foxblade?” Hermione asked. “She’s in my History of Magic class.”
“What a snake,” Draco said, thinking of those alarming eyes, shining and piercing.
“I don’t know,” Draco responded, honestly. What did it matter? More than anything, he wanted it
The Dark Mark had remained untouched, and all that he had done is add some more scars to it.
He had sold one wand today thus far, to an energetic girl with wild blonde curls and a mother with the patience of a saint. She had tried six wands before finally landing on the right one, causing quite a bit of destruction in the shop. Her mother had apologized profusely, but Draco had smiled and waved it off, reassuring her that it was all part of the process. The girl had been delighted with her wand and had nodded and listened intently as Draco instructed her on how to care for it. After she had left with her mother, Draco pulled out his log and quill and added a new line.
“It’s just…something from when I was small,” Potter said, causing Draco to blink in surprise. “I don’t like feeling stuck, like in tight places and…when it’s dark.”
that decision had Harry so nervous he felt his palms sweating.
“Yes, yes, I’ve read about you in the paper, of course. Taking over Ollivanders, very impressive.”
Draco walked off, to find Ella for a proper goodbye, Harry supposed, and Harry picked up his teacup for another sip.
This year felt like the opposite. He was acutely aware of every muscle in his body; every breath he was taking; the feeling of the soft grass he sat on and the hard soil right beneath it; the smooth yet coarse texture of the young Thestral’s mane as he stroked it with his fingers; the gentle, melodic sound of Luna’s voice; the cool winter air keeping his cheeks pink.
He was a lanky bloke, taller than Harry but not as tall as Ron, and very skinny. He had soft features—a small nose and thick lips and just a smattering of freckles over his face. His dark, shoulder-length hair always seemed to be falling into his face, as every few seconds or so, he would lift his hands to tuck it back behind his ears. He looked somewhat feminine, with his long hair and his smooth face and Harry wondered.
“Thank you,” Malfoy said, in a small voice, sitting on the very edge of one of Harry’s armchairs.

“Well, this isn’t
Potter was thoroughly addictive, the heat of his skin under Draco’s fingertips, his five o’clock shadow scraping across Draco’s collarbone, his wild hair falling into his face as he thrust into Draco, the way he would bite down on his bottom lip in a feeble attempt to restrain his moan. Draco always found it a personal success when he managed to get Potter to let loose, to pant and sweat and groan. More than anything, he wanted Potter to look at him. He could never say it out loud of course, but nothing turned him on more than Potter’s eyes looking into his.
“I’m utterly exhausted,” Draco said, not dishonestly. “So I’m off to bed early. Have a lovely night, ladies. I am very happy for you.”
“It’s not bloody Mermish, Potter, it’s just Potions,” Draco rolled his eyes and looked back at his book. “If we manage to unearth something here before nightfall, I’ll help you with Potions.”
Potter was still staring at him, his mouth slightly open and his eyes the size of Pygmy Puffs. Draco realized, with a jolt, that his right hand had moved up from his palm and was now scratching at his left forearm from over his robes. As quickly as he became aware of it, he stopped, and the motion caused Potter’s eyes to cast downwards at his arm.
Hermione, of course, delighted in homework, even with all of the classes she was taking on top of her already demanding apprenticeship. Harry thought that her desire to work in the Department of Mysteries was smart; he knew there was no mystery that Hermione didn’t want to be a part of solving  and he was glad for her, even if she couldn’t reveal much to him about what she was learning.
Everyone was watching them now, mostly silent, aside from a few girls sitting by one of the table, who were whispering amongst themselves. Ernie Macmillan had sprung forward to meet them at the bottom of the stairs.
“I was wondering,” she finally spoke, in a tremendously soft voice, tucking a lock of golden hair behind her ear. “If you don’t mind my asking…have you taken the Oath?”
The other Death Eaters had cheered and the Dark Lord had watched, curiously, before telling Lucius he could stop, after what felt like, to Draco, hours.
” she exclaimed. “They’re going to all that effort just to exclude us?”
on her broom.
“Mmm,” Hermione nodded happily, as she chewed and swallowed a bite of her basil and garlic pasta salad. “Definitely worth my colleagues whinging at me for the next two hours.”
“You don’t have to lie around all day,” she said, when he had begun to protest. “You can be active and productive without necessarily having a job. You could try and fix up Grimmauld Place, or go flying, or learn a new skill.”
Potter chewed down on his lip in thought. Draco’s eyes flickered to watch the movement before he refocused.
“It was very nice of you to speak at their trial, Harry,” said Hermione, clearly trying to cheer Harry up. Her efforts didn’t go a long way, as Ginny’s head snapped in his direction.
“Don’t be so dramatic, Draco, of course you do. I received a letter from Headmistress McGonagall for you; they’re invited the students of your year back to Hogwarts to properly finish. You’re going to do just that.”
Draco merely felt his heart sink even further down into his stomach.
“Huh?”
“Yeah, but I’m keeping my options open. Hopefully this trip will narrow down my choices.”
“Wandless magic is far more difficult than non-verbal, which is why it isn’t typically taught here at Hogwarts.”
“They’d better not,” Ron said, his own voice resembling Ginny’s in its ferocity. “That’d make them stupid as well as evil.”
with Potter and Weasley,” said Daphne, impatiently. “Honestly, Violet, how do you put up with him every day?”
“Draco?” Theo looked back when he realized he was steps ahead. “You alright?”
“Right,” he said, shortly. “I’m sure you can find the door on your own, Potter.”
When a department isn’t properly monitored and regulated and don’t need to answer to the DMLE, they feel entitled to do whatever they want!”
That idea made him think of his father, which brought with it images Draco didn’t want in his mind. Images of his red sunken eyes, that seemed to look less and less like his own as the days dragged on, images of him flinching under the gaze of the Dark Lord, of his blank face peering over him from above as Draco screamed in agony.
There was a long quiet moment after the Sorting Hat finished its song, everyone glancing at each other as if hoping someone had an explanation. Draco had never heard such a song from the Sorting Hat before, even after the Dark Lord’s return. He was constantly surprised by the complexity of the magic within Hogwarts, and the Sorting Hat was no exception.
Draco froze in his seat, and it took all of his effort to force himself to remain in his body. He tried to focus, on the hard wood of the chair, on the solid stone under his feet, on the sharp pain in his palm from where his nails were digging into his skin.
If Draco hadn’t seen Potter’s lips move as he spoke the words, he would’ve been sure someone else had said it.
Potter, for all his awe-inspiring magical power and his staunch support of his friends and refusal to back down on something he believed in, was also absolutely terrible at saying no to people. It was as though he felt like he owed the world something, the way he would bend over backwards to do any favour asked of him. He was constantly running errands that were not his responsibility, and taking on more work than he needed to. The only way Draco was able to snap him out of it was by telling him that his actual Auror work was suffering as a result, and that he needed to learn to focus on his own job instead of trying to do everyone else’s for them. Nevertheless, when someone asked him for anything, it was as if he couldn’t deny them. Draco had responded by saying no for him, whenever he was witness to one of these situations.
“I’ll see you at work, then?” Potter asked.
Potter pulled away, slowly, one hand still holding Draco’s arm, the other clenching a fistful of Draco’s robes at his chest. He breathed heavily, his eyes still shining.
“Still,” he continued. “Transfiguration?”
“Didn’t Winchester nearly put you in the Hospital Wing?” Harry asked, remembering the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff match he and Ron had watched.
Harry felt strange, like he wanted to sit, something he had never felt in his bird form. He squawked again, feeling frustrated that he couldn’t speak.
“Well, Potter, I hope this has been educational for you, I’m off to bed now,” he said, reverting back to the typical lofty tone he used with Potter. He rose from his chair and was about to turn and head towards the staircase to the boys’ dormitories when Potter’s hand shot out and grabbed his arm. His reflexes really were—Draco felt himself internally cringe—lightning sharp.
Potter blinked, then shook his head.
Harry nodded curtly, and though the concerned expression didn’t quite leave Ginny’s face, she nodded back and let it be. That was something Harry always liked about Ginny. She knew when to push and when to let things go. Even if it didn’t always suit Harry. Like the discussion they were supposed to have about their relationship. She was pushing about that. She was right to, Harry knew that, as he had promised her they would talk and had been putting it off all summer. He still didn’t want to talk, wasn’t ready to talk, hadn’t planned at all what he was going to say, didn’t even
“Is it the Prophet? You still get that rot?”
“Being in love is different when the world is ending around you, isn’t it?” she said.
“Harry,” he’d breathed, and Harry had immediately pulled away to look at him.
“Potter,” he said, and Harry was surprised to hear excitement in his voice. “Here, cast the same spell.”
Draco stretched out in his bed and sat up, feeling warm. He allowed himself a minute to wake up fully and get his brain working properly before drawing his bedcurtains and hopping out of bed. He dressed quickly and head into the bathroom to wash up. He found himself excited to get to breakfast. He supposed it was simply a force of habit, it was as if his body knew it was Christmas Day and started preparing him for it.
He had been doubtful, certain that his illness was something else, but he’d followed her instructions nonetheless and found that she was mostly right; the stress and the tiredness slowly dissipated as he gave himself more time to rest.
“Malfoy!” he said, walking up to him, and Malfoy’s head snapped up so quickly, Harry practically felt it in his own neck.
From across the table, Daphne snickered, and Violet looked up to beam at her. Draco, on the other hand, scowled.
Draco raised an eyebrow in question.
“Then why haven’t you told me yet?” Ginny challenged, her eyebrows raised.
“That’s so fascinating. Does she visit them a lot?”
he murmured, and Harry had to try very hard to withhold a gasp.
“Sometimes? Say more on that.”
All three of them were staring at him now, and Draco felt incredibly uncomfortable. He had the strong urge to walk away, but he
“I hadn’t really figured it out myself yet.”
He gestured to the doors, which had the names of their inhabitants etched in golden plaques that hung neatly at eye level.
Ron blinked for a moment and then his blue eyes widened slightly.
to talk about Nathaniel with Pansy, was completely gone. What a ridiculous thought that had been. He drained his wine glass.
Draco, who knew that Finch-Fletchley was a Muggleborn, didn’t ask more. He could guess why Finch-Fletchley was staying, and he’d rather not have to say it out loud. A beat passed, where Theo and Draco chewed in silence and Draco felt his stomach twist uncomfortably.
“You’re a fast learner,” Ashworth went on, “and a natural leader. You’re remarkably selfless and you enjoy helping people. I think you’re perfectly suited for it.”
He had to pause to remember his pureblood genealogy lessons.
Potter shrugged, which only made Draco angrier.
Harry was ready to argue further, but Ron shot him a look that clearly meant:
Hermione smiled, warmly, and reached out to squeeze his hand.
For one thing, it had only been a little over a week since he and Draco had gone to the Ravenclaw-Slytherin Quidditch match. It had ended with a Slytherin victory, and Harry had been even more excited than Draco about this, yanking him into a celebratory hug and cheering loudly. Draco had come out of it with wide eyes and a few hairs out of place and Harry had laughed at his shocked expression and reached out to ruffle and mess up his hair even more. He had expected Draco to make some snide comment about touching his hair, smirking in that way that let Harry know he was joking, but he had just continued to look at Harry, his face looking slightly surprised and slightly bemused.
Hermione paused.
” he started, but the waitress let out a little cough, indicating she was waiting to take their orders.
“Prat.”
Luckily, there was now tea and tart to occupy him, so Harry gratefully bit into his tart, and was happy to find it was just as tasty as it looked. He dared a glance up at Draco, who had what looked like a slice of carrot cake on his plate and a small fork in his hand.
It was, however, what looked like an army of spiders. Thousands and thousands of little black spiders poured out of the drawers all over the desk and the floor, all heading towards Ron, their many legs moving so quickly they seemed to blur. Harry couldn’t even blame him for the terrified wide-eyed expression he had; it wasn’t a pleasant sight.
I know you all mean well and your comments are so wonderful and make my day and I hope I haven't discouraged you from writing with this, it was just eating at me and I wanted to mention it.
“Yes, yes, I’m off to run it. Will I see you at Violet and Daphne’s next Slytherin reunion?”
“Don’t you think it’s strange that two of our new professors had to be imported from another country?” said Ron.
“My sincerest
Draco had blinked at him, surprise probably written all over his face, but he’d made a valiant effort at recovery.
Violet nodded and turned her head away, clearly on the verge of tears.
Once again, thank you guys so much for reading and for commenting, it truly makes my day and I love that you're enjoying reading this as much as I'm enjoying writing it. Now that's enough from me! Enjoy the chapter!
“Thanks, Kreacher,” Harry said, with a sigh, because it was
Heidi Winchester was sitting at the Gryffindor table, sitting right beside Ginny, who had her arm slung casually around her shoulder. Heidi was chatting animatedly with Simone Wexler, the Gryffindor Keeper, who sat across from her, and while Ginny occasionally threw in a comment or two, she mostly just looked at Heidi with a fond expression or else a wide grin.
But the way Malfoy had described it had sounded like it was a punishment for him. He had sounded terrified for his family, for his life, and more than anything, he had sounded as if he hadn’t had a choice.
She had been a part of his life before.
chapter title is from the song Panic Attack by The Glorious Sons
“It doesn’t make sense otherwise, Hermione,” Harry had said, defensively. “If they know it’s me, even as an animal, they’ll still follow me around.”
Harry ran back into the store, jumping over the counter and heading for the back exit. People of course had heard George, and were rushing around the store to catch up with him. Harry broke into a run, but he knew he had nowhere to go from here. The back of the store only lead to a dead end, so he supposed he would have to Apparate. His heart was thumping aggressively, his stomach tied up in a knot. It felt like a mob was descending on him, their cries of his name getting louder and louder until they were ringing in his ear, he could feel himself start to panic and slow down and he barely realised that he was gasping for breath, barely taking any oxygen in, and he screwed his eyes tightly shut and—
Waya considered this.
“Better you than me,” Theo added, although not unkindly. “I wasn’t even in England.”
“It is this that makes me wonder over the status of the hawthorn wand.”
“Because he should be! I Stunned him!” Potter exclaimed.
Luna gave him a gentle smile.
And, well, yes, that did seem to be true, if Harry was to believe what Malfoy had told him about learning about Muggles from his new friend.
“Poor girl,” Violet said, quietly.
He felt himself growing hysterical, but somehow he couldn’t stop the tide now that it had started.
“He’s good-looking,” Harry managed, somewhat pathetically, but Hermione beamed at him nonetheless.
“What would you prefer I tell you?”
It was as though he knew that Harry could understand him. Despite his precarious situation, Harry tried to relax and stay still.
Harry was immediately struck with the question of whether this referred to Ginny’s feelings about the two of them as well. Ginny seemed to realize where Harry’s mind had gone and offered him a soft smile.
“Er, I guess?”
Harry couldn’t ask them to meet more regularly, they were exhausted enough already from work and still trying to make time for him. He felt guilty, dragging them away from their well-deserved free time to help him with his transformations, which he felt he should’ve had a better handle on by now.
He walked around Hogwarts with his hand clenched around his wand in his robe pocket. His new wand had him feeling safer, since he could now actually cast a decent Shield Charm. That was all he ever cast. He never retaliated, never shot a curse back, which was yet another thing that was drastically different about him this year. He was on probation, which meant he had to keep himself squeaky clean, without even so much as a detention on his record. Even if he cast in self-defence, he had no guarantee that his story would be believed. After all, who would believe a former Death Eater over a grieving student?
“Erm,” Draco said, gracelessly. “Well. Yes. I don’t particularly like you either, Weasley, but I appreciate that. And for whatever it’s worth, I am sorry for the harm my family and I have caused you, truly. I know I can't take it back, but I do sincerely apologize.”
“I—” he felt quite overwhelmed. Swallowing tightly, he said, “If you ever need someone to practice on, Lovegood…”
“I don’t think you’re a mammal,” said Hermione once, her eyebrows furrowed by thought. “Non-mammals are much harder to transform into, because of course there are more differences between them and humans.”
knew entirely what he meant.
“Oi!” Seamus exclaimed and reached over to whack a snickering Ron on the head.
“Oh, it was lovely. I had my second lunch with Andromeda today.”
“So?” Draco asked, waiting for an answer. Harry blinked, tearing his eyes off of Draco’s hair. Draco just looked at him expectantly, leaning further back, his long legs stretching out in front of him.
He certainly hadn’t imagined he’d be sitting on the Hogwarts Express on September 1
“How do you do it?” he asked, in barely a whisper. “How does someone
Here he was, traipsing after Hufflepuffs to reach their new shared common room. Blaise and Theodore had both shot him and each other worried looks as they walked, but they all knew better than to speak. The less attention they drew to themselves, the better.
Draco felt himself stumbling around in his brain for something to say. He certainly had no background experience in a conversation like this, let alone with
“Wait, wait,” he held up his hands in an attempt to stop the flow of unanswerable questions. “My
“Yeah, for ages. I didn’t wanna bother you, but I thought you’d be hungry.”
The hand around his arm tightened, and Draco’s own arms rose, reaching for Potter like it was as natural as breathing. His hand found itself on the small of Potter’s back, pulling him closer, and the other slid up Potter’s torso and wove itself into that maddening hair.
Now, in his solitary compartment on the Hogwarts Express, Draco gently flicked the wand, muttering, “
“Potter?”
“Different how?”
He started to have doubts. Malfoy certainly wouldn’t be happy to see who he was. Maybe he should ask Malfoy to take him to Hermione. Although, he supposed, spelling out Hermione’s name would certainly be clue enough as to his own identity.
Harry sat, making sure not to put his feet down on the cloak. A beat passed between them, the silence only broken by the sound of Malfoy biting into and chewing his apple.

He blinked, the usual automatic reaction of

on what Malfoy was doing, let alone pay any actual attention.
“Er, Draco?” came a sleepy voice. “There’s an owl at your window.”
Potter was kissing him.
“I think she thinks it’s her fault, you know, because the article was her idea. Tell her not to worry about it.”
Everyone greeted her warmly when she entered, having all become accustomed to her presence at these dinners, and after saying hello to her sister, Violet began herding them all into the dining room, situated near the front entrance. The dining table was elegantly set, with a jet black tablecloth and white and silver dishes, two tall silver candles burning at the centre.
“I don’t—I didn’t—I’m—”
Since they shared two classes with her, the three of them had become friendlier with Sophie, no one more so than Hermione. Harry found he quite liked her; she was sharp enough to keep up with Hermione, which often kept her from getting frustrated with him and Ron, who weren’t always on the ball, but she was also very funny. Besides, she worked well to balance any remaining awkwardness that happened to arrive between Hermione and Ron. As time went on, though, their relationship was shifting back to what it had been like prior to their getting together—Hermione getting mildly irritated at Ron for always putting off his schoolwork and Ron making ridiculous but often sensible excuses.
“No,” said Potter, his eyes shining. He looked intense and serious and Draco was taken aback to think Potter was this outraged on his behalf. “I’m not going to let anything else happen to you.”
April brought with it some pleasant weather, the sun gentle but present, and the breeze soft and cool. Everything was green and blooming and beautiful, and Draco tried to focus on these good feelings instead of the fear and stress eating away at his stomach.
“She’s American,” Draco said, simply, as if this explained everything. “She moved here two years ago.”
Draco snorted.
Draco wanted to roll his eyes again, but refrained. If he rolled his eyes every time he was tempted to around Potter, he would have a constant headache.
“Well, you didn’t really expect him to call him Nott, did you?”
“What?”
somehow. He still felt this pushy guilt inside of him, as if he were running away or letting someone down. He kept trying to dismiss it, to reassure himself that all of his friends were in support of it and that Rhiannon had encouraged it and that it was the right thing to do, but nothing seemed to help.
“You never have a day off. It’s why I haven’t seen you in eons.”
“And…is that it? That was the last time you spoke in five years?”
“Thank you, Luna,” said Draco, realizing how deeply he meant it only once the words left his mouth. “And thank you for inviting me to visit the Thestrals. They really are magnificent.”
Harry had the time to briefly wonder what on earth Malfoy was doing here, before Malfoy spoke.
it threw Draco off so much that for a moment he almost forgot how angry he was. “I keep feeling like I’m waiting for a fight and I can’t stand it, I just…I just need the fight to come and be done with.”
yes, I’m coming,” he yelled, forcing himself out of bed and over to the window. He felt the sharp chill of the air as he let the owl in, and stuck his hand into a desk drawer in search of a Knut.
Draco groaned. This could
He let his sleeve fall back down as he lowered his arm, turning to Daphne, who had composed herself and schooled her facial expression into one of neutrality.
“Ollivander died,” he said, the words of the article still running through his head as he tried to process them.
“Oh, no, thank you.”
it. He knew it wasn’t unusual to miss a friend, he had missed Ron and Hermione dearly every summer when he had had to go back to the Dursleys, but this felt different somehow.
Draco looked up from the potion.
So Draco kept his mouth shut. But he still couldn’t help but try and
“No need to apologize, Mr Pickering. I find many students are largely unaware of the other major wizarding schools. Uagadou is actually the largest wizarding school of all, and the oldest as well. It’s located in western Uganda, and has a truly gifted student boy. I am very grateful for my time there.”
He gave Ron a sheepish look and said, “I suppose now is a good time to tell you about me and Ginny, then.”
“That’s very kind of you, Draco, thank you. And you can call me Luna, you know.”
“He’s contracted to stay on for the next four years, unless the Minister approves a replacement,” Hermione replied. Three years ago, either Ron or Harry would have questioned how she knew all that, but by now they were used to her having knowledge about the Ministry that surpassed even typical Hermione-level information.
“And what exactly am I thinking?” he asked, setting his quill down.
Small red marks were appearing all over his palms, thousands of miniscule little bite marks. Harry had looked up to find that Malfoy was halfway across the room at the storage cabinet, returning swiftly with a bowl that he placed down on their work table.
“It isn’t a man.”
Pansy rolled her eyes at him.
“Something strange happened today,” he said. “In the morning.”
“It’s different for me.”
“I suppose my point is I think magic is merely the system we use to interact with energy in the world. The energy has always existed and can’t be created or destroyed, the way Muggle physics states. We, as wizards, simply have an additional tool to manipulate that energy that Muggles don’t.”
“Yes.”
“Does this manifest in other ways?” he asked.
He adored his workshop. When Ollivander had officially handed the keys of the shop over and signed the deed over to Draco’s name, he had been granted full freedom to make any changes he saw fit. He hadn’t wanted to change much about the shop; Ollivander’s was a staple in the Wizarding community and Draco knew many witches and wizards had sentimental attachments to the store—he himself liked the darkness and airiness of it. He had attempted to tidy up the store a bit, sorting his wands out by core and wood, and setting certain Self-Cleaning Charms, however major changes were only done to the workshop upstairs.
countless times over the summer. It seemed everyone and their mother knew about “the Golden Trio.”
with the subtitle
“And we will follow up on those leads as procedure dictates, Auror Potter,” Hitchens said, in his boring, official voice. Honestly, hearing him talk made Draco want to fall asleep.
“Very well. A different question, then. You wish to study wandlore?”
“No, it wasn’t, however Amortentia brews much stronger in a gold cauldron. Sometimes, during the brewing process, when the Valerian root is added, the potion can reach extremely high temperatures, and some of the pewter from the cauldron can melt and mix into the potion, which dilutes it. However, gold has a much higher melting point, so it doesn’t carry the same risk.”
Students were never allowed in the Forbidden Forest, of course, but there had always been those rulebreakers—Harry very much included—who had gone in anyway. This year was different. The Forest had changed throughout the war, the Dark Magic that had been flowing through and around the castle had permeated through the Forest, and while Hogwarts had been repaired, there really was no way to clear the Forest. The students in general seemed to give the Forest a wide berth, not wanting to chance running into whatever mutated creatures lurked within.
“The Slytherin Beaters are useless. Pritchard’s alright, but he’s not that strong, and Baddock’s aim is shite. Hawkins and Walsh essentially carry the entire team,” he replied, referring to the Chasers other than Harper.
“Let’s see it then!” Ron said, coming over to sit beside Harry on the sofa.
Draco swallowed. He certainly hadn’t been expecting this when he stormed over to Grimmauld Place, but Harry had such softness in his eyes, his lips stretched out in a smile---all directed at Draco.
“We were together for a short time,” he said. “After three or four months, we realised that ultimately, we were not compatible together. He wanted a future with someone, something I could not give him.”
“You’re a nuisance.”
Harper, Alcott’s
He led Potter into the bathroom, and turned the shower on, letting it warm up as he unbuttoned Potter’s Auror uniform robes. Potter was trembling, his eyes flickering as though he couldn’t focus on anything in particular.
but then the arguments would start, and they weren’t just disagreements; they were just as loud and fiery and intense and they would scream at each other until their voices were hoarse and their eyes red and swollen from crying. Harry couldn’t even remember what their fights were about anymore, his brain was so frazzled and exhausted at that point that it was like the memories had been damaged.
look past the monstrosity on my arm, I never even got my N.E.W.T.s, I’m not qualified for anything. And when Mother…” Malfoy paused, and Harry felt a jolt in his stomach as the thought that Malfoy was holding back tears. “After she was Cursed, I tried everything to get someone to see her. They turned her away at St. Mungo’s again and again, even after she got worse. I looked for private Healers, but I couldn’t afford them, and no one wanted to be associated with the Malfoy name. All I could do was take care of her the best I know how, but I’m not a Healer, I don’t know what I’m doing.”
Malfoy didn’t say anything about it, though, so Harry simply retrieved the remaining ingredients they needed and sad quietly in his chair, watching Malfoy work. It was rather calming; Malfoy worked with a certain rhythm, and it almost seemed like he wasn’t following the instructions but rather his own intuition.
“Right, er, sorry,” Harry stumbled, unsure why he felt so nervous all of a sudden. “I just know you don’t really—”
This was—in Draco’s opinion—somewhat understating things, as Draco had long considered Potter his arch-nemesis and regularly thought about how to disrupt Potter’s day. Admittedly this changed after the Dark Lord’s return, and life had spiralled into something chaotic and dangerous and dark. And yet, still, Potter had never been far from the front of his mind.
“If I said no, would that stop you?”
“On one condition, though,” he said, sternly, after she let out a squeal and wrapped her arms around him in an almost painful hug.
“I believe that’s my cue to leave,” Ashworth said with a warm smile. “I’ll be off grading papers. Waya, send a Patronus should you need anything.”
Potter nodded quickly and Draco tried to focus back on his text, but at that moment, Granger reached out and grabbed his right arm.
“Didn’t you keep up afterwards?” she asked.
The next day, he found himself disappointed to see the familiar owl outside of the window. He had tried not to get his hopes up, but it was the first day he had really done something out of the ordinary, and that had seemed significant—perhaps significant enough to break the time loop.
“Is it just you three then?” asked Harry.
After closing the window, Draco walked resolutely back to his bed. Having woken up feeling unrested once again, he had decided he was not going to work today. He couldn’t help but feel nervous about his decision. He kept thinking that tomorrow he would wake up and it would be the eleventh and he’d be in a world of shit for having skipped work. But he was on his fourth iteration of the tenth of April and if he had to file the same court documents
“Do keep up, Potter,” Draco replied, though the question was clearly directed at Robards. “You need to interview the snake.”
“Hi, Harry,” she said, her eyes not looking up from her book.
“Let me get some books,” she said, and hurried off without another word, leaving Draco sitting awkwardly beside Potter.
“Hey Draco,” came a warm voice from behind him. He turned to see Dean Thomas emerging from The Daily Prophet’s main office.
“They’ve sliced your face,” he said, bluntly. “How much worse can it get?”
“Oh!” she almost jumped in her seat a second later. “I’d almost forgotten, I have Astronomy as well, at midnight.”
“Grilled on charcoal,” she said. “It’s what gives it that smoky taste.”
Knowing he wouldn’t get much more if he pressed, he merely nodded.
“Yes, it is,” he said, instead, quietly. She seemed satisfied with the answer.
“It’s about Daphne,” she finally said, in a tiny voice.
“You want to be
“He didn’t deserve to go to
“Actually, yes, I think so. Tall bloke, sort of long, dark hair, bit of a bookworm. His trunk was still there this morning. River or Rivers or something.”
“Are you flirting with my girlfriend, Draco?” called Violet from over in the kitchen.
Her voice had been sad, and Draco was reminded, horribly, of how Luna and Ollivander had grown close during their time imprisoned in the Manor’s dungeons during the war. But Luna had mainly been comforting him, speaking softly about how close she knew they had become and what a role model Ollivander had been to him. Draco felt like his head was buzzing.
Draco just shook his head again.
“I’m sorry,” Harry groaned, covering his face with his hands again. “I don’t know, I was so confused and stressed out. I probably wouldn’t have even told Hermione, but I needed someone to explain to me what happened.”
He hopped off the last step and surveyed the common room. At first glance, it looked empty, but as he walked towards the brick wall where the entrance was hidden, he saw his Ravenclaw roommate—Oliver Rivers, he reminded himself—sitting in one of the grey armchairs, his legs tucked closely and a book in his hands. He looked up at the sound of Draco’s steps and made eye contact with him. Draco paused, unsure what to do, and then, smiled hesitantly.
the sessions with Harry and Draco have FINALLy begun!! yes, when I tagged this slow burn, I meant a S L O W  B U R N. has anyone seen that Tumblr post where it's like "I want a Jane Austen level slow burn where they don't even touch pinkies until page 358" thats me. we're making moves tho !!
“Is that what you want?”
“Yes! I don’t—
The three of them had been engaging in a quick-paced, hushed conversation, but as soon as Draco had approached, they had gone silent, instead looking up at him.
He felt angry with himself, angry that he was letting Voldemort consume even more of his life, as if the past seven years had not been enough. Really, the past seventeen years, even if he hadn’t known about it prior to his eleventh birthday. Voldemort had taken his parents, had taken his chance at a happy childhood, had consumed his adolescence, had taken so many people that he loved and cared about.
“Now, as this is our last session of the school year,” Ollivander said, his face looking serious. “I have a proposition for you.”
“Yeah,” nodded Harry, his mind swimming. Draco was staring at him, and through his peripheral vision, Harry could see he had an odd expression on his face, as though Harry was some sort of puzzle he was trying to figure out.
Draco could feel his voice starting to tremble slightly.
He was half-right; Hermione did have a disapproving look on her face, but when she spoke, she only said, “Well, it’s better than using the Prince’s book, I suppose. Still, Harry, you should at least be paying attention to what he’s doing. And that’s not really fair to Malfoy, either.”
you, Malfoy. I need to know if the memory was happy enough to even produce a Patronus. Just tell me what it was.”
He unrolled the note and began to read.

“That was only one time!” cried Harry, defensively, but Ron was grinning at him, clearly taking the piss.

He had shared such sentiments before, especially when Draco mentioned wanting to pay him back in some way. Draco had soon learned it was a lost cause.
She offered him a cheeky grin and then jumped up to find Heidi at the Hufflepuff table. Harry took a long sip from his tea and sat, replaying the conversation he had just had in his head.
“Excellent,” he said, wrapping his arms around Draco. “How on earth should we celebrate?”
“What are you looking at so seriously?” she asked, peering over his shoulder.
“Dobbs and Armstrong are neck and neck!” Dennis Creevey exclaimed from his place at the commentator’s podium. “It’s just a question of who’s faster! Armstrong has the advantage of the better broom, but Dobbs is smaller and lighter and—
And he had to try to find some way to live with that. Like he always did, he compartmentalized—put it in a box somewhere in his brain with a promise to deal with it later so that he could focus on other things. But things like that refused to stay hidden for long, and the memories would often come back to Draco with a jolt in the most random of times, as if trying to force themselves back into the front of his mind.
He finally snapped out of it after days of holing up in his flat, having nearly made the rash decision of sending Potter an owl. He no longer knew what iteration of the loop he was on, and he was starting to grow desperate.
“Okay, let’s take a break,” Harry said, as Malfoy’s carefully placed hair started to fall into his face due to his sweating forehead. Full-body healing spells were exhausting, as Harry knew all too well.
He sat there, staring at Harry for a moment.
“Stop it, Malfoy,” said Potter, though his lip was twitching as well. “All I’m saying is I wouldn’t
Harry still doubted how much it would help him, but he figured he might as well give it shot, and after all, Hermione was rarely wrong, so odds were she knew what she was talking about.
“I got this from one of Voldemort’s Horcr—from his…well, a part of his soul,” said Potter, sounding grim. “It’s hard to explain, but it was in a locket and we were trying to destroy it. And it nearly drowned me, pulling me down like a weight. And when I was down there, struggling to breathe, all I could think about was…‘if I die, Voldemort wins’. I didn’t…I didn’t think about Ron or Hermione or the Weasleys or Hagrid or Remus or anyone I love. I just thought about Voldemort, about how it was my job to kill him. My responsibility.”
“Of course. Why make it easier on us?”
before. It was after. After the war, after the Dark Lord, after his father went to Azkaban and his family name came tumbling down into the dirt. After Potter both saved the world and destroyed the one Draco had thought he lived in.
On his eighteenth, so soon after the Battle of Hogwarts, after a month of waking up nearly every night from the nightmares that still plagued him, he and Ron had spent the evening getting regrettably drunk to the point of incoherence.
“Knowing Pansy, she won’t make us wait long to find out.”
Violet was looking at him with a smile on her face and an expression that Draco could only read as proud.
mind, I would like to find out if my list of potential spouses is restricted to approximately ten people or not.”
“Do come in, boys, and close the door behind you; you’re letting the cold in.”
Draco felt himself stiffen. The blasé way Macmillan was speaking about Ollivander rubbed him the wrong way.
“That seems like a good memory to use. Want to give it another go?”
“Shh!” Potter held up a hand. “Do you hear that?”
Draco scratched the Thestral softly behind its scaly ear.
“Potter,” he said, hearing how dead his voice sounded. There was no bite, no snarl, none of the acrimony that had coloured his tongue for years in interactions with Potter. He just sounded resigned. The thought made him even angrier.
“What do you look so concentrated over?” Violet said, dropping her bag on the seat across from him with a loud thunk and taking the next seat over for herself.
The door on the right read:
“He’s rather fit, don’t you think?”
Draco trailed off, his brain catching up to his mouth, but it was too late. Potter was looking at him, expectantly.
“You’re arguing again, Potter,” Draco reminded him, keeping his eyes on the players.
” Ron exclaimed. “If they win against the Bats, and if the Tornados lose the next match against the Catapults…”
Ginny’s shoulders slumped ever so slightly.
He was met at the shoot by Demelza wielding a clipboard. She ran him through the set time while walking him into the building.
Harry stared, as Malfoy unfastened his cloak and elegantly draped it upon the grass, sitting down cross-legged on it, and taking his book bag off of his shoulder.
Draco snorted.
“Who’s it for then?”
“Mum and Dad have known I was a lesbian since I was ten years old,” Violet said, light-heartedly, but Draco noticed how she discreetly placed a hand over Daphne’s on the table and squeezed it. Daphne offered her a warm smile.
Now that they were friends—and Merlin, was that still impossible to wrap his head around—Draco was becoming more aware of Potter’s odd conversational habits, mainly his constant questioning.
“No, I know, I just mean. You weren’t afraid. Even at the beginning. You were just nice to her right away.”
It was nowhere near as horrific as living in the Manor during the Dark Lord’s reign, of course, but Draco certainly did not feel comfortable. Which was part of the reason why, when he entered the common room, he felt his shoulders relax in relief when he found it empty for the most part, spotting Slytherin colours by the windows.
“Hello, Potter,” Draco greeted him politely, standing from his seat. Harry felt as though his hands might start shaking at any moment.
Hermione, however, had already mentioned him twice while discussing certain research she had begun for her apprenticeship.
Draco saw as Potter’s jaw clenched.
“Er, right,” Harry agreed, because they both knew that despite Harry’s unexpected success in sixth year, Malfoy was the superior Potions student.
Potter went marvellously red in the face, but made a valiant effort at pretending he hadn’t.
“That bad?”
“Congrats,” Harry said, though he had never heard of Starthistle plants.
be good.
“Right, okay, well,” Harry wrung his hands nervously in his lap. “I don’t really know what’s happened, but he’s sort of avoiding me, I think? I don’t know if it’s all just, er, in my head, though, if it’s just because of N.E.W.T.s or if I did something wrong. And I don’t know why it bothers me so much, because obviously he doesn’t owe me any of his time or anything, I just sort of…” want to be around him, Harry’s mind supplied for him, but he didn’t say the words.

“Right, and Flobberworms can fly.”
He was finding Muggle botany rather fascinating. It was a subject he never thought he’d be interested in, although that was more to do with the Muggle part than anything else. The Muggles were far more symbolic about it, as many of the flowers served no other purpose to them to look beautiful and smell fragrant. There was something special about that, about them ascribing meanings based on nothing other than the emotions the flowers invoked.
“What?”
“I’m not
Harry was immediately interested. He had only had one session with Waya before the Christmas holidays, which had been about methods of instruction, and he was eager for more. Ashworth was an excellent professor, but Waya had such power in his magic, it could almost rival Dumbledore’s.
all over again.”
More hands in the air.
Cordelia was looking at him with warm affection pooling in her brown eyes, as if checking that he were alright. Theo, who had lost the last member of his family when his grandmother had died a year ago, smiled reassuringly at her, and Draco quickly looked away, feeling like he had infringed on something personal.
The downtrodden look on Daphne’s face made his gut twist, and before he knew it, he was adding, “I can look into it for you.”
It was only after their first serious case that the frostiness between them had begun to thaw.
“Yeah,” she sighed. “We’ll practice more next session. In the meantime, don’t practice on your own. You need to have either Ron or me there to perform the spell in case you can’t transform back, okay?”
Harry didn’t know if crows had facial expressions, but Malfoy seemed to understand the one he was trying to convey, because he laughed—a warm sound that shook Harry to his core. He had never heard such a sound come from Malfoy before.
At this, Draco cracked a smile.
There must have been something particularly pathetic in Harry’s tone, because both Ron and Hermione seemed to relent slightly.
Waya nodded at him and Harry bid him goodbye as Ashworth walked out of the door, leaving the two of them in his office.
Wordlessly, Draco handed over the vial and watched as Potter drained it, his eyes drifting to the way his throat moved as he swallowed. He was terrified of speaking. Potter, by some miracle, was in his bed, and he was sure that the second he opened his mouth, he would chase him out.
Draco nodded graciously and took a seat. Instead of allowing another lengthy pause to fall over them, he began speaking at once.
“Oh, yes. Hogwarts has all sorts of secret places,” said Luna, a faint smile crossing over her face. “It always makes room for those in need.”
“Potter, don’t—!”
“Yes, well, Crabbe and Goyle weren’t exactly his friends, were they?” Hermione responded.
“You promise?” she demanded.
certainly wasn’t helping. For whatever reason, Potter had decided that he was going to call Draco by his given name. The first few times he had done it in regular conversation, Draco had shot him a glare and sharply asked him who he believed he was talking to, but Potter had just barked that atrociously loud laugh of his and continued to call him Draco. And it continued to be distracting and unnerving, and Draco felt his stomach do an uncomfortable flip.
“Were you here to watch Miss Weasley?” asked the Kestrels recruiter, Keegan Hitchens. Ah, there it was.
Suddenly, it dawned on Draco. His lips split open in a wide smile.
Once Weasley had turned his back and marched resolutely back over to his girlfriend, Violet finally spoke.
Draco leaned forward, wrapping his arms around Potter’s middle and resting his hands with his palms flat on Potter’s back. For a moment, Potter was frozen, his body still as a statue as Draco rested his head on his shoulder, his face turned in so that his nose just barely grazed the soft skin of Potter’s neck. Potter’s breath was unsteady, but after several seconds, he let out a long exhale, his body ever so slightly relaxing into the embrace. Hesitantly, he lifted his own arms and placed them delicately around Draco’s shoulders, barely resting any weight on him.
“He must be having such a hard time,” Hermione said, and when Harry blinked and looked back up at her, her eyes were brightly trained on him.
“How did you know I was there?”
But then Luna reached out a hand and traced his forearm with a fingertip. Draco felt a chill run up his arm and down his spine, but her touch was gentle. She said nothing about the scars, but he could feel when her finger went past the lines of the Mark and onto the smooth skin of the scars that had sliced into it.
“She’s lovely,” she said, as if the words pained her. “She’s so lovely, Draco.”
“I think we’ve got it,” declared Dennis, happily. Harry and Draco both seemed to startle a bit, breaking from the strange otherworldly moment that had just taken place.
The owl barrelled in, bringing a gust of cold wind with it.
“Sorry,” Potter said, somewhat sheepishly. “I was just curious. You said she told you about the moon landing, right?”
Potter nodded, motioning for Draco to follow him. Still somewhat in shock from what had transpired so quickly over the last hour or so, Draco wordlessly followed him. Potter led them out through the external entrance, offering a brief explanation of not wanting to go through the busy Atrium.
not spending as much time with Draco. He hadn’t realized when he had become so used to the other boy’s company and now that it was suddenly gone, he found himself
Malfoy said, clearly. The boggart didn’t completely change form, however Lucius’s pin straight hair began to frizz up into curls resembling Bellatrix’s, sending the fake Lucius into a hysterical panic.
“There’s a Knut in the drawer,” he said, and Harry retrieved it for the owl.
“What kind of wand is this? Kneazle hair, you said?” McGonagall asked, picking up the wand rather delicately and acting as though Draco hadn’t just had a ridiculous outburst. He was grateful for that, if nothing else.
Ron’s eyes were wide.
“How long?” Draco asked, rhetorically, and felt himself losing control of his tongue. “How many Cleaning Charms does it take to remove the stench of rotting flesh from the dining room? How can elf magic stop that feeling of freezing cold fear every time I turn a bloody corner? I had
“Do you know them?” he asked.
Luna looked towards him with a smile on her face.
“Oh, keep it in your robes,” said Draco, surprising even himself. Daphne fixed him with a hard glare and Violet went even redder and Draco couldn’t help but laugh.
“You didn’t tell her?” Hermione asked, looking surprised.
Harry stared at him. He wasn’t sure Malfoy had ever uttered a sentence to him that wasn’t ridden with insults. He supposed Malfoy was still telling him off for not doing it correctly, but he almost—dare Harry say it—sounded like Hermione in his admonishing.
At Ron’s increasing volume, Hermione’s attention was brought back to the conversation from her book and she frowned at him. She was clearly about to respond, but Harry beat her to it.
Harry stared. Draco raised an eyebrow.
"So he’s a coward,” Ron put in.
compare to the Chosen One.”
Harry had smiled, relieved, knowing that he was forgiven. Hermione had easily picked up on the fact that he was feeling better as well, and since he had promised her that he would begin visiting a Mind Healer in the summer, she had stopped looking so worried all the time.
“She’s well,” he said, sighing. There was really no point in trying to distract Potter, he was always ready with more questions.
Harry nodded, because, well, of course he was alright. As alright as he ever was.
” gasped Violet. “In Britain?”

“You’d better.”
Draco looked up from the cauldron to shoot him a glare.
“You know,” Bill started, in a much quieter voice than he had spoken in before. “When we got married, during the war…I know some people thought it was crazy, or bad timing. But we thought, this world may be full of hatred, but it’s full of love as well. And I think maybe things balance out like that sometimes. The other day, we read in the papers about Ollivander’s death. And here we are, celebrating a new life. It just makes me think…life is unpredictable, and we never know how much time we have left. I’m grateful that I’m spending this time here, with you all.”
“Muggles don’t know about magic because they’re purposefully kept in the dark, but wizards don’t know about Muggles because they
about taking Divination again—” Ron sputtered a, “but—” which Harry knew was going to be something like,
He had never been happier for it to be Wednesday.
“You know, I first started thinking about it when we got back from Australia,” she said, looking off into the distance with a fond expression on her face. “My parents were very upset with me, of course, but somewhere in the midst of all the scolding, my mother took me aside and asked me about Ron. She said she could tell that something had happened, something had changed between us. I asked her about Dad, about how she had known she was in love with him. She told me that being in love with someone wasn’t what made you want to spend your life with them. She said that there were thousands of kinds of love, and only by letting yourself feel as much of it as you can will you figure out the differences.”
know that’s rubbish.”
“Nobody wants them here!” Ernie exclaimed, losing all sense of his originally calm composure.
He didn’t know if it was the effect of the pixie juice coming out in the fumes of the potion, or just another sign he was losing his mind, but Draco felt the words come out of him without permission, like he had no control over what he was saying.
Draco snorted.
Harry sat back in his seat and watched Malfoy slowly stir the potion—two turns counter-clockwise, then four clockwise, then repeat six times. He felt somewhat useless, but he had tried to help, even offering to stir, but Malfoy had slapped his hand away dismissively.
Ollivander’s eyes were twinkling.
“He was Seeker, wasn’t he? When you were…” Harry trailed off, realizing a little too late that bringing up Draco’s mission to assassinate Dumbledore might not be the best idea at the moment.
“It’s an inside joke,” he finally mumbled.
“And what?”
“You were there, Blaise, I hadn’t even entered the castle yet,” he snapped, suddenly, his stomach lurching violently.
Turning to his shepherd’s pie, he strained to hear what Potter and Weasley were discussing.
“Except for?” he prodded, even when Draco didn’t finish.
After a long moment’s thought, he spoke again, his words coming out slowly and carefully.
“Wonderful as always,” he replied, stoppering the vial and getting started on another one. “She’s been promoted to work as secretary for Quincy Buchanan at the Headquarters of the International Magical Trading Standards Body.”
“Let’s get started, then.” He said, clapping his hands together. “I assume you are all familiar with boggarts.”
Theo nodded, adding, “With the Ravenclaws.”
“Do you have an interest in pursuing Quidditch professionally?” she asked, getting right to the point. “The Falcons would love to have you try out.”
“Now, we must also discuss your extra-curricular classes. Many of your core and elective classes will be taken along with the seventh years, however Hogwarts is offering a unique opportunity for you as well. Under normal circumstances, at this age you would typically be undertaking an apprenticeship or commencing training for your chosen field. Hogwarts will be welcoming experts to mentor you in whatever your field of choosing may be. On the schedules you receive tomorrow, you will find you each have an individual appointment with your Head of House next week, to consider what that field may be so that we may find you an appropriate mentor. Any questions?”
Draco sat down delicately next to her, placing his bag beside him.
Thirty minutes later, he ate roasted broccoli and potatoes in his dimly lit sitting room. Such were the days—long, uneventful, and unrewarding. He went to work, he came home, he ate, he slept. Occasionally, he’d pen a letter to his mother or Pansy, and if he weren’t too tired, sometimes he’d read before bed, but that was the extent of excitement in his life. If his mind weren’t so drained from reading court documents all day, perhaps he’d ponder the decisions he’d made that led to such a dreary lifestyle, reflect on his sins as he was wont to do on occasion, bringing about feelings of guilt and self-pity. But as it were, he was far too tired, and after a quick shower, he retired to bed.
“Prat.” Blaise teased and gave Draco a playful shove.
He felt a warmth rise up his neck at the memory, and quickly realigned his focus on the conversation that had carried on while he’d been sucked into his thoughts.
“I’m joking. It’s been known to happen on occasion. Now finish your coffee and go away.”
“I am not giving you a Knut until I see the Prophet,” Draco protested, as the owl continued to peck at him. “I’m just going to unroll it!”
“I wouldn’t expect anything less.”
“Yes, she’s fifteen,” Violet said, slowly. Draco looked at her, curiously.
“Those are some highly controlled Potions.”
Seven minutes into Harry’s fourth meeting with Ashworth, he was already out of breath.
It wasn’t only Draco who was taking this case personally. Potter was as serious as Draco had ever seen him, and they seemed to have an unspoken agreement to do everything in their power to find this man and make him pay.
“I wish it was,” Harry said, quietly. Ginny looked at him, and Harry could’ve sworn the expression she wore was pity.
“Overworked, I suppose,” explained Harry. “I had a bit of a mental breakdown, to be honest.”
It wasn’t long after that Laurel arrived, coming in through the front entrance as she had driven in her car. She was constantly goading Draco about coming on a drive with her, but as progressive as Draco had gotten about the Muggle world, he drew the line at that metal death-trap.
“Oh,” said Potter. Slowly, a grin crossed over his face. “So that means you want to be mates too?”
“Could be worse,” he said, and allowed himself a smirk as he looked at the other boys. “I could be rooming with the
“Who is that from?” Theo asked. Draco shrugged, looking at the box curiously.
“When would I have done that, Violet? When my father was carted off to Azkaban the first time? When I was tasked with the mission of assassinating the Headmaster by the most evil wizard who ever lived? During the
“Oh!” Hermione exclaimed at the same time as Ron said, “Brill, mate.”
“Who bought you a new wand?”
“That was brilliant, Draco,” Potter said from the ground, his breath coming out in quick, heavy pants.
“No,” Harry replied, though Malfoy surely knew that he had no idea what snakeberry was.
In fact, he didn’t even realize he was still facing the armchairs until he made unmistakeable eye contact with Luna Lovegood. He quickly blinked and looked away, but he could feel her large eyes stay on him and he fidgeted on the windowseat, uncomfortably.
Draco was struck once again by the generosity and kindness of his mentor and felt another surge of gratitude at the opportunity he was given to work with the man.
After stepping out of the Floo and brushing non-existent Floo powder off of his robes, he walked over to where she was waiting for him and leaned in to greet her with a kiss on the cheek.
Draco felt his heart sink lower and lower into his stomach with every word he read. It must have shown on his face, because Violet immediately looked concerned.
“What?”
He paused, feeling like all of his insides were twisting and pulling, shaking him from the inside out. He wrung his hands anxiously in his lap and avoided meeting Hermione’s eyes.
Draco had shrugged, an amused expression on his face. However odd her taste in books may be, he was glad Theo’s grandmother seemed to be close enough to Theo to warrant gift-fiving. At least he wasn’t completely alone.
too, but Draco found that he didn’t even have the desire to anymore.
“I applied for less hours at Keswary this fall,” Harry said. He was going to have to tell them at some point, better to just get it over with quickly. He didn’t expect a negative reaction—quite the opposite, he knew that Hermione had been in agreement with Rhiannon about him taking some more time off ever since his breakdown.
“I’m not inviting her here,” said Violet, speaking for the first time since the subject of Pansy had been brought up. “I’m sorry, I know you still call them Slytherin reunions or whatever, Draco, but she was horrible to me, and I don’t want her in my house.”
Suddenly—out of nowhere—Granger offered him a smile.
“You’re voluntarily eating starch for breakfast? Who are you and what have you done to Draco Malfoy?”
“A bit over a year ago,” said Harry.
“That’s spectacularly inaccurate,” he sniffed. “There are plenty of witches and wizards who were evil and not in Slytherin. Grindelwald didn’t even go to Hogwarts. And even the Death Eaters weren’t all Slytherins. Rookwood was a Ravenclaw, and so was Yaxley. Rowle was a Gryffindor. Pettigrew—”
wand, and Draco found himself feeling a certain reproach for it, despite knowing this would not help its efficiency.
“Oh, yes,” said the secretary, with a sorrowful look on her face. “Poor boy, he seemed so in love.”
desire Theo, he just…admired him. Found him interesting. And attractive.
“You’re familiar with the Sacred Twenty-Eight, I presume?”
“Sounds great,” he said.
Dennis was clicking through his camera with a frown on his face.
“Because I was there,” Violet said, simply. “I hid amongst the Ravenclaws when they sent the Slytherins off. A few of the other seventh and sixth years did too.”
“I’m sure I have no idea what you mean, Potter,” Draco replied in a lofty tone.
“Oh? How did that go?”
“Thank you, Luna,” he finally managed to rasp out. “Thank you.”
Potter had the decency to look down in shame and withdrew his famous wand to cast the spell. Draco reached out for the dragon claws and transported them to a bowl where he could properly crush and powder them.
Harry cracked a smile at this.

He liked to talk to Armstrong, and while he was sure that a lot was lost in translation, the animal seemed to understand him quite a bit, and was a wonderful listener. He had nuzzled right up into Draco’s face when he had been told that he was Draco’s Patronus, which had filled Draco with a sense of affection so strong he didn’t even know what to do with it.
“Merlin!” came a surprised voice as the owl hurtled in. “What are you making such a racket fo—
Waya nodded, thoughtfully.
Hermione was deep in a conversation with Percy, who worked as a solicitor now, regarding legal procedures for Beings as compared to witches and wizards. Percy had become a lot more tolerable now that he no longer worked for the Ministry, but he was still
“Upset?” he asked, raising his eyebrows.
It made some amount of sense though; after all, the war had changed everything, and his side had lost. As much as he hated it, Harry’s title of The Boy Who Lived Twice practically guaranteed he was untouchable.
Ron just grinned.
“I don’t need an aggressive weapon,” he had gritted out in a low tone. “I just want a regular damn wand.”
one. He felt some sort of responsibility for every death of an innocent that had occurred during the war, as if it was somehow his fault that Voldemort and the Death Eaters were terrorizing people. Especially those who had died during the Battle of Hogwarts, it seemed like Potter carried their deaths upon his shoulders, letting the overwhelming guilt weigh him down constantly. Draco had tried to tell him it wasn’t his fault—albeit in a snarky, condescending way, implying that Potter was making everything all about him—but Potter had just shaken his head slowly, like Draco couldn’t possibly understand, which of course made
Draco looked at him. He wasn’t looking back; instead, he was looking off into nothingness, the moonlight reflecting gently in his bright emerald eyes. His face was worn—like that of a man who had fought a war—but still so young—like that of a boy—and Draco suddenly felt a strange urge to tuck him away somewhere warm and safe and hide him from the world.
Harry didn’t have a reply for this, so he stayed silent and watched Malfoy stopper the vial and slip it back into his bag. After leaning over to stir the potion, Malfoy sighed.
“No,” Draco replied. “It’s only…do you remember what I said about petals, seeds, and stems?”
“Nah,” Ron said, returning to his food. “She’s on her emergency rotation now, so it’s more often, but they’re putting her on poisons and antidote training next month.”
Draco’s grip on his wand slackened and he stared at her in disbelief.
“Excellent, my boy, excellent. What can you tell me about larch wood?”
Draco furrowed his eyebrows.
“I didn’t mean it like that,” Harry amended. “I just—you were—she was scared and you were really good at talking her through it. It was impressive. You were impressive.”
“Why are you having lunch in the Forbidden Forest?” he asked.
“Yes. I suppose it could.”
“Jones is a pureblood, I’m sure she knows all the etiquette,” Potter said, grinning.
“Have you signalled for back-up yet?” Draco murmured, his wand clenched in his fist. Potter gave the slightest shake of his head.
“Did that really happen or is my sleep deprivation causing me to hallucinate?”
“Merry Christmas,” he said. Rivers looked confused for a moment, but then smiled in return.
“Pretty good,” Harry replied, honestly. “I asked my boss to put me down for less hours this fall.”
“And why would I care about this?”
Draco arrived at work exactly seven minutes early.
“Hey, I’m taking a break, if Robards asks, yeah?”
Draco shrugged.
“Is that right?” he asked, and Draco forced himself to meet his Head of House’s eyes.
and he was looking at him with concern in his face, green eyes bright and eyebrows furrowed.
“Please, sit down,” Ashworth said, gesturing to the slightly smaller chair on the other side of the desk. Harry sat, running his fingers over the smooth velvet of the seat.
Draco looked at him.
“Pomfrey? No. Why would I go see Pomfrey?”
He hadn’t told Luna that he was learning about Muggles with Violet, however the more time he spent with her, the more he realized that Luna often seemed to just
“Yes, well, you know how Pansy likes to make an entrance.”
“No,” he said, rolling it back up. “I am not paying for this again. Take it back.”
But this year, the drawers were opening. There were many of them, it seemed, many memories and emotions Draco had repressed that were now resurfacing, now that the primary danger had subsided and survival was no longer something he felt he needed to focus all his energy on. Draco didn’t know quite what to do with all of it now. The dreadful things his father had done to him during the war, they were painful to think about. The inability to trust and fear of making himself vulnerable, as taught to him by his father; he was proud that he had made strides to conquer that fear, in his new friendships with Luna and Violet, and even in strengthening the bond with his other housemates, Theo and Blaise and Daphne. The doubts and misgivings he had had about his upbringing regarding Muggles and Muggleborns, that had thankfully been something he had been able to at least start working through, thanks in large part to his friendship with Violet.
Usually, this sort of teaching frustrated Hermione, as she was far more comfortable learning from books, however she seemed to be doing quite well. Ashworth praised her at the end of class, telling everyone to look closely at how her hair had straightened out and become coarser, much closer to a lion’s mane than human hair. He helped her Transfigure it back and instructed them all to write twelve inches on the possible consequences of improperly cast Self-Transfiguration.
He glanced at Potter, who looked entirely captivated by Draco’s explanation, and quickly averted his eyes back to the vase. He felt his voice subconsciously lower.
It was chaos.
He supposed he could have argued with her more, insisted he study independently and just go sit his exams in June, but instead he’d remained silent, and done as he was told.
aim for Cartwright!—you won’t change the name?”
After Hermione had walked off in the direction of the Founder’s Tower, Harry turned back to Malfoy, who hadn’t moved an inch. As soon as he made eye contact, Malfoy launched into speech, talking so quickly it seemed like he was trying to get it over with as soon as possible.
“We’ll be starting off with something a little simpler to get you back into the rhythm of things,” Slughorn announced, rising from his chair with what seemed like considerable effort and pointing his wand at the blackboard. “However, don’t get lazy! This potion will require constant supervision in order to achieve the desired result.”
“You’re still bleeding,” Malfoy murmured, a frown on his face. “I’m going to have to push for a bit. Hold still.”
“They’re on a
He’d always been slightly fearful of Thestrals, especially once he had been able to see them. He was old enough to know that the myths about them being omens of death were nothing more than superstitions, but they certainly
A hand closed over his wrist and squeezed gently and he looked up to see Potter peering at him with his emerald eyes.
“What about Christmas?” Hermione asked.
Draco sat as still as he could, despite the urge to squirm in his chair. His nerves were on edge, and he was terrified that he was about to be expelled.
The Burrow had always felt comfortably crowded—well lived-in and used, full and homey, but the guest list for Molly’s mandatory monthly dinners had grown in recent years.
“Four!”
“I’m sorry, Professor,” said Draco. “Are you disappointed?”
“Alright,” she said. After a long pause, during which Harry assumed the conversation had ended and he returned his full attention to his breakfast, she spoke again, her voice measured and careful.
His eyes fell upon the small, circular table that sat in the centre of the room, and the vase upon it. He hadn’t mentioned it to Violet, but this had been another motivator for his research into flowers. He had been curious about the flowers since he first saw them and wondered why those particular ones had been chosen. He’d been hoping maybe the Muggle book would give him some more answers.
work, Potter, mindless. And yet, Eleanor bloody Branstone can barely
“There’s a chance, but it’s practically non-existent,” said Hermione. “It’s exceedingly rare that the link goes both ways.”
Potter spoke again, a series of odd sibilant sounds. Draco couldn’t tell if the gooseflesh rising up on his arms was from the hissing or from the chill of the dungeons.
Draco’s mind went back to the last time he saw his mother for dinner, the soft smile that she had worn and the twinkle in her eye when she had mentioned Andromeda. That had been a nice evening. Well. Until…
“I’ve taken it,” Draco said, curtly, and Granger’s eyes widened. “The ritual is moderately simple, and I’m sure whatever you’ve read on it has captured it all. However I’m more curious about the intricacies of the magic behind the Oath.”
“Is there a reason,” Harry asked, forcing the words to come out, “why someone would be denied a Healer after being cursed?”
His thoughts always tried to shove their way in, with obnoxious questions and doubts and worries. They crept around in his brain, taunting him. Why would spending time with Potter make you so happy, Draco? Wasn’t he your sworn enemy, Draco? Certainly you cannot build such a close friendship so quickly, Draco. Surely you don’t need his friendship or approval, Draco.
He hopped over to the letter Y on the page.
“Well,” she stammered. “I thought that…if you did not wish to marry a witch, but still desired a Malfoy heir, we could…help each other.”
Draco blinked at the letter, surprised at how emotional his mother’s words had him.
“I overheard Turpin and Patil whispering about it last night,” Daphne explained, referring to her and Violet’s Ravenclaw roommates. “It looks like everyone knows about it except for us.”
Hermione didn’t often drink at pub nights, since she typically had to work the following day, but tonight she picked up her glass of nettle wine and clinked it softly against Harry’s pint.
so powerful, it took four people to
There were gasps from around the classroom, as Foxblade stared at the lifeless body before her. Like Harry had been, she seemed to be frozen, unable to open her mouth and cast the spell. The longer she stood there, the more blood poured from the girl, the more her body sagged lifelessly.
” said the woman, in a startlingly American accent. To Harry’s surprise, she seemed to be in Muggle clothing—a white shirt and apron over dark denim trousers. “Ella said I would want to take these out myself. I suppose you’re the reason why, huh?”
“Excellent. Let me know when you’ve found someone and keep me updated on your progress. Meanwhile, we’ll continue our sessions together. I’m trying to find a time where Waya can come in as well, since he’s much more of a Defence expert than I am.”
