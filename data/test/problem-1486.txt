Draco's mind flooded with memories of his previous years and the torment he put Harry and his friends through. Draco bit his lip, hard. He glanced at himself in the mirror. If he were Harry, would he forgive himself?
An especially chilling breeze drifted in through the cracks of the stones and tossed about some loose papers on Draco's desk, scattering a couple onto the stone floor. With a huff, he rose from his chair and collected the sheets. Neatly stacking them and putting them back onto the pile, this time with a paperweight on top.
Despite not paying much attention in Care of Magical Creatures any damn fool knew not to move a nest, especially if the babies were in it, and Draco wasn't a damn fool. So how come he always acted like one?
Draco’s morning starts off as well as can be expected, that causes him to have a chaotic rest of the day.
kidnap your kids?" The mother shivered slightly as an answer and Draco found himself suddenly very tired. "Merlin, what time is it?" He felt his eyes wobble before the room dimmed, the breeze now soothing to his overheated skin as the soft feathers coaxed him into a dreary state, leaving him no choice but to fall back asleep.
Draco splashed his face with water as the memory played fresh in his mind as if the events happened yesterday. Draco only just noticed the mirrors were foggy and there was steam floating around the room. Draco directed his gaze towards the huge bath that was located against the wall and saw that the tub was overflowing with bubbles. Draco carefully wandered over towards the pool of suds wondering who had woken up earlier enough to get this started (then deciding to disregard the time knowing that some others would think his schedule to be a little too early as well), but nonetheless overwhelmed by the question of 'who?' Not that it was any of Draco's business, but Draco had recently noticed that his curiosity had spiked significantly over the past couple of months despite his resolution to stay to himself.
Harry scratched his eyebrow. "I don't know. Maybe they aren't happy?" Draco huffed a dry laugh before shaking his head lightly. "Perhaps."
A light blush of embarrassment crept onto Harry's features as he instinctively scratched the back of his neck.
"I mean, are you doing alright? Like, you're fine and everything?" A concerned look was painted on Harry's features.
After finishing some assignments, Draco wandered the halls a bit. Professors were often swamped with work and didn't monitor the halls as strictly as they once did. Not that it matters, it wasn't curfew yet. The soft, warm glow of the candlelight urged Draco on as he walked to nowhere imparticular. Down some stairs and around some corners.
In a weird, twisted sense Draco could see how the eyes of the public only saw proper justice being served, but as all who experience fears as he did Draco doesn't think that at all. He thinks the justice system is more flawed than they let off to be. He is sure that the ministry is aware of how he is abhorred by many, especially the lot from school. No doubt him working for the Dark Lord was only icing on the cake for his
When Draco made no more than a quarter of a dent in his food, Tony came bounding up with his imbecilic goons. Draco noticed a wrapping cloth tied around the same arm he twisted yesterday.
" Hey, uh, Malfoy." Potter's voice seemed slightly strained as he nervously glanced around the court yard, avoiding Draco's gaze.
" No, Draco. Are you alright? I mean with all that happened durning dinner and earlier with the Boggart-"
Waking up to find a steady stream of snow dancing into your room would put anyone at odds. However, Draco was more shocked to find that it wasn't a prank but rather a hole in his living quarters. The snowy wind from the outdoors chilled Draco as his bare feet padded over to his desk in search of his wand, hoping that he could remedy the situation. Draco inspected the opening in the corner of his ceiling, standing on the chair get dragged over to get a better view. A makeshift owl's nest was in a small alcove along the walls. Unsteady stone bricks rocked next to it, threatening to fall and crush the innocent scene. Draco saw two baby Eagle owls huddled together on the other side of the nest, resting while they waited for their mother. Draco looked out into the winter scape searching for the mother, but he couldn't see past a meter into the ghostly weather.
He felt his leg muscles tense until they completely froze as he gazed upon the crowd. Clumps stopped and stared back, their skin morphed together to form one giant glob monster made of flesh and eyes. The building seemed to only carry the sound of radio silence, the air conditioning completely disoriented Draco. He stood in the crowded corridor, people pushing against his shoulders and shoes scuffing created a deafening screech, staring.
Ronald laid down on his seats showing he didn't expect an answer. Draco shortly repeated the action, his head by the window so he could watch as the glass fill with clear dots. Ronald's head by the door allowed Draco to see his long legs fold in an uncomfortable-looking position on the seats.
Although Draco was practically unfazed by the obnoxious boy beside him, he did feel on edge about something else. Or rather, someone else. As Draco studied Maria's features from across the room (mentally noting that there was a small scratch on her cheek) he suddenly had a cool chill run down his spine. His fight or flight reflexes stipulated him to jerk his head out into the sea of students once more.
Draco's neutral expression quickly flashed to a worry as he darted to his room in search of his bag.
Draco's fingers mindlessly wandered over a roll as he day dreamt about what he was to do when it was his turn. Would he ask for a pass? Or face it head on?
Of course! Why else would Potter follow him! He saw Draco twist the boy's arm! He's come to spell him into the next tomorrow.
" Draco Malfoy, looks like your days no more." Tony grinned as he lifted his wand and looked expectingly at Potter. Draco's eyes widened, no longer having any faith to hold on to.
Draco's hand reaching for the gravy jerked at the statement and knocked over his goblet. The juice only spilled slightly before it was righted again, Draco cleaning the mess with a wiping textile.
And please PLEASE make sure your keeping safe and healthy, I hope this could bring some joy to you all in this unpleasant time.
It wasn't until Harry placed a gentle hand on his shoulder had he realized that Harry had been calling him.
Once the class had been dismissed, Draco sorted his things in his bag but stayed seat. He waited until the other student cleared out to approach the Professor. " Sir," he began with hesitation in his voice.
Draco managed to pulled his eyes off of the large berry bush across the way in order to face Potter as the spoke, like a mannered civilian should. As their eyes locked together, Draco felt as if someone had given him an electrically charged touch. Draco wanted to tell Potter ' he was fine' and ' better now that he was here.' What he actually said,
The last kid of the class was Longbottom. As he approached the clown wearing a princess dress and crown, it transformed into a enormous snake that slithered up his legs. Right before the beast bit into the poor boy's thigh, he cast the spell. The snake fell to the floor, became a noodle and wiggled around. Longbottom certainly has changed from the scared, little boy he was in his youth to a real war hero. Yup, he was up the with the big dogs now (almost as well known as Potter...almost) Similar to Granger, everyone knew he feared something.
It was annoyingly embarrassing having Harry bloody Potter take his notes for class. Draco could barely read his chicken scratch, and it didn't help that Harry didn't even write down half the stuff the Professors said. His arm was mended, but Madam Pomfrey instructed him to avoid writing or casting spells for the next week which proved to be challenging in a school that studied magic.
The 'leader' of the group took another step forward a pressed both his hands flat on the table. He rocked on his heels and looked at the soaked flakes in front of Draco. " What do you think,
Why did he even come after Malfoy anyways? It's not like they're friends or anything, in fact they're far from it.
“ I suppose that could be arranged.” Draco replied as he headed towards the Quidditch field with Potter at his side.
Draco's eyes cracked open almost immediately as he grimaced at Potter. " Still as observant as ever, I see." Draco deadpanned as he turned back to the Professor, who he had been neglecting.
" Quite, Headmistress." Draco bowed his head in respect but managed to look back up at her so she would acknowledge that he still has
Harry offered a sickenly sweet smile that gave Draco a tooth ache just by looking at it as a response and then the two were headed in their own directions.
The first week was always a mess of scheduling and locating classes, but in the later years, a student could easily find their desired destination. However with multiple walls dedicated and the ceiling and floors caved in creating large holes in the middle, most classes were relocated to other rooms, halls, and even the fields. While Draco still felt a sense of guilt when he was around Hagrid's little hut, he couldn't deny it was nice to be near nature. Crisp air hit the back of his neck and invigorated him with a new sense of peace.
He wakes up screaming almost every night. Yells and tosses in his sleep. Seems like a lot to handle. Draco couldn't imagine how he'd even go to bed at night knowing that you'd just wake up by a nightmare.
In the middle of the distraction, Draco grabbed Tony's arm and twisted it against the joint causing the other male to unleash Draco's tie and yelp out in pain. Draco pushed his seat back, allowing his freedom from the table, and quickly headed out the doors praying the squad of delinquent didn't follow him.
His dad was sent to a new institutional program called the I.M.U.C.W.W. Otherwise known as the Informative Molding Unit for Conflicting Witches and Wizards. Or should they say unknown? With the ministry refusing to disclose information to the public about the contained ex-death eater's it was hard to say what was a theory and what was a fact. Of course, the Malfoy's knew. They had to, it wasn't like the had a choice in the matter.
He spoke with Luna and Harry almost a month ago by now and he hasn't interacted with much anyone since then. He did call his mother over the fire a handful of times in the common room, their conversations were short and very distant. She would often be staring at something out her window and forget Draco was talking. She would repeat herself and seemed very dazed most of the time. It unsettled Draco, his mother was never much of a daydreamer but as of late she has grown farther and farther away from life, becoming disconnected to reality. It saddened Draco to see her this way, but he knew there wasn't much he could do to help.
They crunched on crisp leaves and accidentally kicked rocks. Draco swore he even stubbed his toe once he and Potter began laughing over nothing in particular like a bunch of first years. They crashed on top of the small rock wall that was now slightly more destroyed and decorated with holes and wild ivy that grew eagerly over the stone. The wall was cool to touch but Draco plopped himself down on it happily as adrenaline raced through him. They gazed out at the setting sun, which was almost completely hidden by the rolling hills and forests that surrounded Hogwarts. The calls of unknown animals that echoed from within the Forbidden Forest next to them only added to the beauty of the moment.
Merlin, she was tall. Draco raised his brows as if to ask her 'what?' Carie closes her eyes while a conflicting expression grazed her face, but in an instant it was gone and her dazzling eyes were once again locked with Draco's.
Draco was undisturbed durning lunch as he arrived later and left earlier to hopefully make a dent in his built up list of duties. When Draco arrived at Hogwarts he had been forced to volunteer once a week, preforming minuscule jobs. Such as sweeping the halls or assisting Professors with up coming projects (though Draco personally felt he had helped the Professors enough for one day.) Today's menial task was to restock the food supply in the Owlery, however there was some sort of mix up and Draco had to travel to the green houses in search of the correct accommodations before checking in on the owls. On top of it all, the owls were all too excited to see their food and some ended up scratching Draco while squaking with joy. Arriving to lunch with tiny slits in his clothes and a thin scratch upon his cheek probably helped Draco with avoiding confrontation.
I have the feeling that I'm going to have to up the level of kink very very soon. So far, there's a whole lot of fluff going on. *grin*
He gave Draco’s cock another twist and continued to tease the walnut-sized nub inside of him with his fingers.
A soft smirk graced Draco’s face and offering his hand, Harry patiently waited for Draco to accept it. Draco didn’t hesitate for long, and the moment he placed his hand in Harry’s, Harry gripped it tightly and pulled Draco across the room.
He whispered sweet words of praise and Draco’s soft mewl made the butterflies in the pit of his heart flutter. Harry’s heart skipped a beat and feeling exhilarated, Harry leant forward. He placed his hands on either side of Draco’s shoulders, then pressed a lingering kiss to Draco’s temple, briefly closing his eyes as he did so. He inhaled Draco’s familiar scent and let it cloud his senses for a few moments. Draco smelled of love and trust and a prevailing aroma of vanilla and fresh citrus. It was intoxicating and not for the first time, Harry wished he could crawl into Draco and remain there forever.
Harry smiled and reaching out, he took Draco’s hand, slipped his thumb underneath the sleeve of his light-grey leather jacket and the black long-sleeved shirt he wore underneath. He found the pulse point on the inside of Draco’s wrist with practised ease and without having to search for it. That gesture, too, had become second nature to him. Applying a moderate amount of pressure, Harry deliberately drew Draco’s attention to his touch. He held it right there, captivating his little prince with his innate ability to get under his skin.
Harry’s enjoyment was the kind of drug Draco needed to lose himself in the moment; it was what allowed him to slip into the sort of headspace where he couldn’t think of anything more important than fully immersing himself in the experience. In those moments, he lived only for Harry’s ropes and giving up all control came as easy to him as breathing.
For the first three months, they’d met exclusively at munches, then Roísín had asked whether it might be appropriate for them to meet at her favourite coffee shop. Draco had turned to him for advice then, and Harry still fondly remembered giving him the green light, teasingly instructing him to enjoy himself.
To distract himself, he thought about the rope burns, he’d be left with once Harry decided to take the harness off.
Hermione shook her head, but the small smile that caressed the corners of her mouth told Harry that she wasn’t at all furious with them. It just so happened that the two things she hated the most in life were being ignored and having to repeat herself, which she considered being a waste of her time. She also wasn’t a massive fan of having to fight for someone’s attention. Ron lavished her with it, baby Rose was enamoured with her mother, and as Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic, wizards and witches alike treated her with a certain level of respect. Especially once she'd successfully reversed all the ridiculous decrees her predecessor had put into place.
“I want it all, for the rest of my life,” he said quietly, feeling a single tear run down his cheek.
His cock throbbed, his arse was on fire, and when Harry smacked his red arse, he keened, whimpered and begged for more.
Forcing himself to remain aware of his every move, action, and decision meant that he got to enjoy himself a lot more. It meant that whatever Draco felt as he slipped deeper and deeper into his submission, Harry felt the same on his end of the spectrum, though only up to the degree he allowed himself to feel the sensations.
With great difficulty, Draco finally dragged his eyes away from Stefan’s eternity collar and glanced around the high-ceilinged room instead. It was a bright and lofty room with modern but extremely comfortable furniture and professionally-installed high-grade parquet flooring. Since the room was large, the dark wood instantly gave the entire room a sense of greater solemnity, making it immediately elegant.
However, much to Harry’s astonishment, Draco didn’t take his bait. He merely raised a single eyebrow at him, held his gaze for the longest time, and then, as if having regained all control over his body, he reached for his tea and took several small sips. Draco straightened up a little more, and even though the glass cup concealed nearly all of Draco’s face, Harry caught a glimpse of the sly smile that ghosted around the left corner of his mouth.
“Please, Sir, please. I want to wrap my lips around your cock and feel it rest against my tongue. I want to take you deep, and suck you as you pull out, then use my tongue as you thrust back into my mouth. Please, Sir. Please let me take care of you, please.”
Harry didn’t rush Draco but patiently allowed a few minutes of comfortable silence to pass between them. It was only when Draco shifted in his arms and attempted to pull back, that he slowly relaxed his hold and released Draco.
“It does have a bit of mind of its own, you’re not wrong there. It also really depends on your overall mental health in the days leading up to play and whether you’ve been under any stress or getting enough sleep. Simple things like that make a huge difference, and most of the time, prolonged aftercare really helps to ease the strength of the drop.”
Harry expertly led him around the dancefloor for another minute or so, then gradually slowed the pace and the moment they came to a standstill, a tornado of applause erupted in the large banquet room. Draco tried to stop himself from turning crimson, but didn’t quite manage and lowering his head; he beseeched Harry for help.
“A change of topic and a half. I’ve practised a bit, but I think I need a couple more sessions with you to get more comfortable.”
After granting his son a short respite, he picked Scorpius off the bed, threw him over his shoulder and even though Scorpius protested and tried to smack his backside, Draco ignored his son’s serious objections. He made his way across his bedroom and into his walk-in wardrobe. Once there, he put Scorpius down and laughed when his son placed his hands on his hips and gave him an icy glare.
It was a hearty laugh that clearly rose from the depths of his belly and thrummed through his chest.
Draco didn’t blame her, but he worried about her. It didn’t matter to him that she was Harry’s biological daughter; he loved her just as much ― it was impossible not to love her. Lily had this way about her that simply attracted people. They loved her kindness, her smile, her thoughtfulness, and the way her mere presence could improve one’s mood almost instantly. Draco was one of those people. In his eyes, Lily was his daughter. They’d never once discussed the semantics of that and Lily generally used his given name. Still, they had a sort of unspoken understanding about the more complex aspects of their relationship.
Harry laughed, and when he leant in to kiss him, Draco melted into his embrace and against his body, relishing in the chance to be close to him.
Whenever his mind tried to drag him under, Draco found some way or other to pull him out of his funk. Most of the time, all he ever did was to merely gently guide his attention to something else. Other times, he kissed him senseless, entertained him with his unique brand of sass or made him a random compliment. All in all, no matter what Draco did, it all worked. But what Harry valued most of all was Draco’s unconditional willingness to be present, to be with him.
Before the Court Aurors had the chance to react, he jumped out of the witness box, over their heads and into the centre of the courtroom.
“As you can see, Malfoy, we are in my office. Merlin knows why, but I decided to grant you a bit of dignity and apparated us straight in here. Would you have preferred me parading you down the DMLE? If you crave that sort of attention, I can rectify the problem at once. The door is right behind you. If you insist, we can also call the press.”
Where subspace was involved, one needed to be especially cautious when using the Riving Spell to reverse the effects of a sudden blackout. While the charm couldn’t bring anyone back from the dead, it was instrumental in counteracting the impact of a Stunner or a simple temporary loss of consciousness.
His stomach flipped with excitement. When Harry reached for his hand and laced their fingers together, a shudder surged down his spine. For a few seconds, he lost himself in Harry’s sparkling green eyes, then he cast his eyes downward and positively basked in the hum of approval, he got from Harry. Over the last two years, he’d practically mastered the art of discreet submission. Harry cherished them, and Draco lived for the thrill of pleasing Harry, who leant closer and pressed a sweet kiss to his cheek.
“Is that so? In that case, I best make full use of my new rights as Prosecutor Malfoy’s husband-to-be.”
Eirwen was dressed in a white spaghetti top that was almost transparent and left little to the imagination.
He took a moment to concentrate, then brought his arm up and down in one dexterous and fluid motion to coax a loud crack out of his whip.
“Yep, but I’m afraid if I allow those two rascals behind the counter it’ll look like a tornado whirled through there.”
Harry still vividly remembered the answer Draco had given him one afternoon when he’d been bold enough to enquire about his new interest in rewriting the laws of Wizarding Britain.
When the kids are happily munching away on their breakfast, Harry refills his coffee mug, takes a few sips, then temporarily abandons in on top of a coaster on the kitchen table. He picks up Walter’s empty food bowl, cleans and dries it, then fills it nearly to the brim with Walter’s favourite food. Strangely enough, Walter, despite being a magical creature, has a thing for ordinary Muggle dog food, specifically a rather expensive all-natural brand from across the pond, something that Harry finds endlessly amusing. Occasionally, he even affectionately teases Walter about his preferences, but naturally, this always ends with Walter storming off in a huff and sulking in Harry’s bedroom. Then again, Harry knows that his crup isn’t really upset with him, it’s just Walter’s way of making a statement.
Despite his masochistic tendencies, he hated the belt with a passion. There was absolutely nothing he liked about it. Its sound reminded Draco of past punishments, and whereas the faint smell of a riding crop’s leather tress filled him with desire and had him sink to his knees, the belt terrified him through and through.
“Listen, mate, do you need me to come out? I can leave Anna with Stefan. Those two have been talking about some boyband or other all night long. I feel absolutely ancient here. I haven’t got the foggiest who Westlife are, but apparently my daughter’s in love with a bloke called Shane, whom she wants to have babies with, and what did you know, my own boyfriend fancies the pants off this blond Dublin lad called Nico or Nicky or something like that. It’s news to me that he’s got a thing for blond blue-eyed twinks.”
“Once you find that one special person, you connect with, and once you got to know each other, and vetted each other, and talked about wants and needs and limits and, and, and, then you can use the term ‘training’ again. In that situation, your Dominant can teach you what particular areas they want you to be more skilled in, and what their own personal preferences are. For example, how do they like their food or drink? What’s their daily schedule like and what can you do to help with it? How do they like their foot rub? All those things.”
“You’re talking like a true Slytherin, Weasley. I like it. Now, are you sure your plan is fool-proof?”
Draco considered it somewhat of a hobby and often folded origami animals, especially birds and dragons while brooding over one of his cases. According to him, it helped him to keep his mind on developing a suitable strategy prior to the start of a new trial.
“Perhaps. Nevertheless, it’s nice to know that your mind didn’t drift off completely while I made every effort to pick the perfect mattress.”
Harry clicked his tongue and slowly stroked his cock, twisting his fist around it as he moved it up and down.
Walter growls at him, but when Hugo wraps his arms around Walter’s neck and hugs him, he’s distracted. Harry quietly slips away and continues to work until about shortly after one o’clock when Angelina, George’s wife, stops by with a cooked lunch and a meaty snack for Walter.
Draco coughed and spluttered into his mug. He swallowed a mixture of spit and coffee, set the cup down on a coaster, and summoning a tissue, he wiped his mouth.
Draco whimpered softly and his fingers closed around the edges of the piano, looking for support. He held on tight and rolled his hips. Harry moved with him, pressed his fingers against Draco’s prostate and rubbed it with intention. An intense shiver surged through Draco and Harry absorbed some of it. He continued to bring Draco closer and closer to the edge.
I also thought that after all the fluff and cuteness, I had to exercise a bit of control and pull the reins back *grin* so here we are.
“Try again, my little prince. Do you like it when I touch you like that? When I drag my nails down your spine and grab your arse to make you mine…”
“In a minute. Or five. When he’s less likely to try and choke me with his bare hands. He hates it when I snatch his wand like that.”
“If you expect me to spend four days at an utterly boring convention, I will require a comfortable bed, easy access to the Avenue des Champs-Élysées for some overpriced espresso, freshly-baked croissants, people-watching, excellent food and wine, and a spacious bathroom.”
“Careful, Potter, issuing that sort of blanket approval is dangerous. You’re giving me decidedly too much power here.”
“You said you miss bickering with me. Well, I thought a roleplay scene might give you the perfect excuse to really go for it.”
Draco’s whispered plea sent a shudder through Harry, and he threw one leg over Draco’s thighs and wrapped both his arms around him.
Draco cried out, thrashed in his arms, or tried to, and a swell of desperate pleas fell from his lips.
, he thought in response to what Stefan had said about Harry gifting him an eternity collar, but remained silent. He took a moment to collect himself, then turned his head and smiled at Stefan.
Sensing his discomfort, and to reassure him, Harry pressed the flat of his hand against Draco’s cheek and leant in to kiss him.
Draco briefly stared down at his hand, and a small smile curled around the edge of his mouth, drawing its corners upward. It didn’t quite reach his eyes, but for now, it was good enough for Draco.
There was a thoroughly devious glint in his eyes, and his almost irritatingly smug smile made Draco go weak at the knees. For a moment, he wasn’t sure whether they could still hold him upright, but deciding to put a bit of trust into them, he pushed himself away from the door and walked over to where Harry stood.
Teddy turned his attention back to the film on TV, and for a while silence settled around them. Draco went back to perusing his work-related files and a good half an hour past until Teddy scrambled off the sofa and left the room to visit the loo. When he returned a few minutes later, he asked for a slice of dry toast, and they both headed into the kitchen, where Draco suggested that Teddy take a stomach-settling potion first. Since the tonic was somewhat bitter, Draco added two teaspoons of sugar, mixed it carefully, and then prepared some toast for Teddy.
Leaning back in Potter’s rather comfortable leather office chair, Draco summoned the case file that lay open on his desk and began to peruse his earlier notes. He did that while resolutely trying his best not to allow Potter to distract him. The fact that Potter kept staring at him didn’t exactly make things easy, but somehow, Draco managed to pretend that he was entirely engrossed in his latest incident report.
Draco could only recall one other time when he’d seen her use that look. Back then it hadn’t been directed at him but her husband. It had been the night that his father had promised Voldemort that his only heir would take the
Emmett gave him a pointed look and biting his tongue, Harry stopped himself from finishing that two-letter word.
Upon arriving at their coffee shop, Harry had claimed their usual window seat and left Draco to organise their lunch. He usually did, and since Draco always managed to surprise him with something genuinely mouth-watering and never disappointed, Harry had no reservations about taking a backseat and patiently waiting to be surprised.
Draco hummed softly against his leg, and the sound vibrated through Harry, fuelling his desire, steadily urging him on.
In fact, it was probably the understatement of the century, perhaps even millennium if one dared to be bold enough to exaggerate and Draco most definitely dared. It was in his nature. Not always, but occasionally, and right now absolutely classified as an occasion to embellish the truth somewhat.
Harry stared into the amber liquid in his tumbler glass and briefly closing his eyes, he took a deep breath, then downed the potent drink. It burnt down his oesophagus and feeling his eyes water, Harry squeezed them shut and cleared his throat.
He needed words; whispered directly into his ear, spoken for the sake of his mental welfare and his alone; words that were more powerful and more binding than the most potent magic, words capable of sending shudder after shudder through him, words that focused him, settled him, prepared him.
“How is it going?” he asked, casually motioning over the papers, Lily had been pouring over up until a moment ago.
Once again, Harry grabbed his hair tightly and pushed him right down, forcing him to swallow every inch. Draco’s eyes burnt and watered, and he blinked, but the tears fell anyway. His mouth was full, his throat constricted, and a thick coating of his drool covered all of Harry’s cock.
“Her condition was critical, and Mother told me that she even attempted to commit suicide several times. Apparently, her deep passion for roses was the only thing in life that gave her any sort of joy, and in his desperation, my great-great-great-grandfather decided to design and build this stunning rose garden for her. Since no magical potion available at the time seemed to elevate her mood for longer than a few hours at a time, he hoped a rose garden might cure her of her sadness. According to Malfoy family history, although I don’t know how much of this is actually true, this place is supposed to be heavily infused with all sorts of ancient magic.
Charlie’s innocent question broke through the haze in his brain and looking up Draco smiled and nodded.
―and introduce the next mystery speaker personally. This one is a dear friend of mine, and as such, I consider introducing him to be a great honour. He’s the only man who ever dared to stand up to me with absolute and unwavering confidence, never once giving me an inch, but boldly giving me all the sass instead. I had the pleasure to watch him grow into the lifestyle and embrace it with open arms. I’m truly excited to listen to him share his story with the room, so, please put your hands together and give a warm welcome to our next speaker, Draco, the most menacing of all dragons.”
Whenever Draco thought he’d worked out Harry’s pattern, he changed it up, and the heavy fogginess in Draco’s brain began to increase.
As he approached, Number 12 Grimmauld Place gradually came into view and climbing the stairs to the front door, Charlie didn’t concern himself with the bell. He never had; Harry had included him in the wards the day he’d moved in.
About halfway across the room, Harry paused and inhaled deeply through his nose. A wave of earthy, nutty, and spicy flavours with bitter undertones and a warm, penetrating aroma with hints of lemon assaulted his nostrils. The smoky, sweet smell of cumin lingered behind.
He crossed his arms over his chest and continued to face the window, looking out of the grounds of Malfoy Manor.
“I’ll show you cruel tonight, Potter, just you wait. Tonight, I’ll have you on your knees, begging for mercy. Now, shoo.”
This morning, an urgent message, delivered by owl, had interrupted his post-breakfast coffee with Harry, and after skimming over the contents of the note, he’d dashed upstairs to get dressed, kissed Harry goodbye and then hurriedly left for the Ministry.
Mellow piano tunes―they were sweet, round, dark, and rich―gradually coaxed Harry from his dreams as the familiar melody of Debussy’s famous
He possessed a kind of attitude that Draco was totally infatuated with; to the degree that he occasionally found it a bit embarrassing. Though, these days, he’d stopped carrying quite so much. There was just something about Harry’s bold assertiveness, and the way he commanded a room, that simply got to Draco and melted a fierce part of him. When in Harry’s presence, he generally found it hard to exercise any kind of self-control.
Tonight, Draco’s hair was loose. The long strands cascaded down over his shoulders, framing his face quite beautifully. It had a zesty smell to it, which reminded Harry of fresh lemons, and a sweet, tangy smell, which Harry found pleasantly stimulating and quite exciting. Then there was also the somewhat citrusy vibrant smell of bergamot and the woodsy, soft aroma of sandalwood, both components of Draco’s preferred perfume. It was a concoction, Harry was rather partial to, and he, almost unconsciously, leant a bit closer to inhale more of it. On top of being extraordinarily talented when it came to brewing potions, Draco was also rather skilled at mixing various essential oils and other ingredients to create the most wonderful of smells, which he sold at outrageous prices.
Potter mumbled something entirely incomprehensible, and walking over to the sofa, he plunked himself down. Draco had just about enough time to move his legs, and disgruntled, he kicked the side of Potter’s thigh. Not hard enough to seriously hurt Potter, but firmly enough to express his annoyance. Then, he obstinately placed his feet in Potter’s lap. Potter turned his head sideways and glared at him.
Draco pulled his hands out of his pockets and moving over to the sofa, he sat down and staring at the floor in front of him, he let out a soft sigh.
Harry’s praise sent another surge of arousal through him, and he tugged hard on both clamps, very nearly pulling them off his nipples. They were dark red and sore, but Draco couldn’t get enough of the sensations, and so he continued to draw and twist and letting out a long moan, he pushed the toy a little deeper inside of him, then pulled back and slammed the toy all the way inside. His arse protested just a little, but he cared not.
Harry watched as Draco’s upper arms flexed and his muscles bulged, but instead of allowing that to distract him, he secured the rope, then reached for the rope that connected Draco’s futomomo to the bamboo above. He unlocked the rope, tugged on it, and forced Draco’s higher up into the air. Holding the rope steady, Harry unlocked the rope that secured Draco’s double-column tie. As he gradually loosened it up, Draco, aided by gravity, lowered his upper body until his shoulders were in line with his waist.
Draco consciously smoothed his forehead and inclined his head politely to greet one of his colleagues, as she exited Black Magic with a large paper coffee cup in one hand and a chocolate scone in the other. She nodded in return, then rushed past him, striding into the direction of The Leaky Cauldron, with her black Prosecutor’s robes billowing behind her. The click-clack of her heels repeatedly connecting with the cobblestoned ground, echoed up and down the street for quite some time and Draco took a moment to appreciate the relative silence all around him. It would be another hour or two before Diagon Alley woke up fully and the street bustled with lively action, chattering wizards and witches and overexcited small children.
In response, Draco sucked more of the lollipop into his mouth. His lips were glistening with sticky wetness, and their indecent shape did next to nothing to improve the painfully hard situation in Harry’s trousers.
Harry took another sip from his coffee and smiling, he waited for Draco to finish devouring a second biscuit.
“Perhaps, although I can assure you the MLEP squad is hardworking and excellent at what they do. They most definitely can handle themselves without my intervention.”
Harry’s mouth felt dry, and he couldn’t decide whether his heart was beating too fast or not at all.
Harry, seemingly absent-minded, for he was listening to something or other Caleb was saying, drew an intricate pattern on the side of his upper arm, and focusing on the gentle touch, Draco tried his best to allow the warmth of Harry’s body to seep into him and help him relax.
His mother’s cool tone sent a shiver down Draco’s spine, and he silently watched her add another piece of brown sugar to her favourite tea. She stirred it carefully and until the sugar had dissolved completely, then elegantly placed the small teaspoon beside the glass saucer. She lifted the tea glass off the table, brought it up to her lips, then paused and glanced at him over the rim of the crystal cup.
Draco lowered the microphone a bit and discreetly cleared his throat. Stefan had told him that most speakers opted for a microphone stand, but in his particular instance, Draco preferred having something to hold on to. With Harry’s rope in one hand and the microphone in the other, he felt focused, centred, grounded. It helped to keep the desire to wring his hands together nervously and pull them apart again at bay.
“Caleb is going to record each speech on video, and the speaker will receive a copy of their talk, although that’s subject to consent and if you’re not up for it then it won’t happen. I think Caleb is hoping to record enough material to put together a DVD or series of DVDs, but again, it’s up to each individual speaker whether they want to be included or not. What do you think? Is that something you might be interested in trying?”
The thick aroma of molasses, with complementing notes of pomegranate, ripe persimmon and rich baking chocolate left him with a full and creamy mouthfeel, and swallowing his first sip, he indulged in a second, and a third, then a fourth.
For a moment, silence lingered in the winter garden, then Harry turned to look at Draco, and they both burst into a fit of uncontrollable giggles. It took them several minutes to regain any sort of composure, and once they did, Draco bent down and picked up their coats, scarves, gloves, and hats.
“I need you, Sir, so bad. I want you to have me, Sir, all of me. Do as you please, do as you desire, I’m yours, always.”
Potter’s voice had softened considerably, and Draco found it almost endearing. The thought also mildly terrified him, and he pushed the feeling to the furthest―and darkest―corner of his mind, slammed the door and locked it several hundred times.
Harry removed his hand from Draco’s cheek, and ran his fingers through Draco’s soft blond hair instead, massaging his scalp softly.
Harry always made sure to provide him with everything he needed and was genuinely attentive and present. He was right there with him, in the moment, always ready to give him exactly what he wanted and needed to feel better.
In response, something or other scattered to pieces in the hallway and a moment later, Draco heard the roar of the living room fireplace, then Harry was gone, and he was alone in the kitchen of Grimmauld Place, Harry’s inherited Georgian-style London townhouse.
Harry reached for the bottle of lube, splashed a liberal amount onto his hand, then wrapped his hand loosely around Draco’s throbbing cock. It pulsed in his hand, its head dark-red and dripping with precome. Harry stroked it, slowly, evenly.
Along the way, he made sure to brush his fingertips along Draco’s naked skin as often as possible, knowing it gave his little prince a rush, knowing he craved the touch. He stopped every now and then to give Draco the one or other kiss, to caress his cheek, or to simply check in with him, and make sure that he was doing alright. He did it in part to continue to distract Draco from the tumult of the last week, but mostly because it simply was the right thing to do; it was safe and sane.
Aware that he was about to drift off into his own world, and possibly give in to the temptation to simply stand there and daydream, Draco forced himself to remain present.
Given a choice, Harry usually preferred to slowly nurse a tumbler of single-malt whiskey, neat, but tonight, Caleb had convinced him to give Honey Dew Ale a try, and since the alcohol content was low and it wasn’t as heavy as most beers, Harry was rather enjoying himself.
While using Potter’s last name felt a lot more natural, it also had a lot more bite to it, Draco was determined to show a bit of his gentle side, albeit not too much, and therefore opted for Harry’s given name.
Harry swallowed a sigh, and taking a step closer to Draco, he gently placed two fingers underneath his boyfriend’s trembling chin and coaxed him into lifting his head.
With a soft and warm smile flitting around the edges of his mouth, Harry confidently approached Draco and stopped right in front of him. He reached out, wrapped his fingers around Draco’s wrist and pulled it free, gently forcing his husband to uncross his arms.
, Draco thought bitterly, quietly resigning himself to the fact that he would be spending the remainder of his days in a magical mental institution for those suffering from severe psychiatric breakdowns. He couldn’t help but wonder, if he promised to keep out of everyone’s way, they might allow him to quietly continue to research and write his papers.
It wasn’t difficult to surrender to Draco’s sassy dominance, simply because Harry knew that Draco wasn’t doing it because he wanted to change the dynamic between them but because he genuinely cared about his wellbeing and wanted to look out for him. Harry wasn’t going to begrudge Draco the desire to fuss over him. Sometimes, one gained more by taking a backseat, and Harry was more than ready to sit back.
Draco nodded, and Harry was about to click his tongue again and change his course of action when Draco spoke up.
Harry’s words washed over him just as his third orgasm tore through him and gasping for air, Draco squeezed his eyes shut and let the tears fall.
He crouched down beside the tub and reached for a soft yellow sponge which he soaked in the bath’s hot water. Gently running it over Draco’s very sore bottom, Harry did his best to soothe the burn with the utmost care. The welts were rather prominent, and no matter how gentle his touch was, Draco hissed, squirmed and whimpered.
“As Master Potter wishes,” she said as she straightened up again, then disappeared with a snap of her long, bony fingers.
Draco wanted to roll his eyes at Malcolm or mock his ex-boyfriend in some other way, but he couldn’t come up with a single good reason as to why that sort of reaction made sense. What Malcolm had just said was the truth. Whenever he looked at Harry, even if it was only for a second, absolutely nothing and nobody mattered. Harry’s soul was the missing piece that completed his own, and together they made a whole. And occasionally, or quite often actually, he did like to imagine that Harry was some divine being that had descended from the Heavens to claim him, possess him, and own him.
He still had the one or other occasional doubt about his skills as a Dominant, and whether or not he’d overstepped a line during their epic roleplay a week ago, but ever since they’d arrived at the Manor, Draco had developed the perfect sixth sense for that sort of thing. Somehow, Draco was able to anticipate precisely when his mind was trying to play tricks on him and Harry was immensely grateful for Draco’s intuitiveness. It was subtle, but it was there.
The box was larger than the box his engagement ring had been in and unable to resist the twitch in his palm, which extended out through his fingers, Draco flexed them, then clenched them into a tight fist. He dug his nails into his skin and hissed at the searing pain that shot up his arm. Uncurling his fist somewhat, he stared at the box and gulped. The case was decidedly larger than a ring box but not big enough for a collar.
Rather triumphantly straddling Draco’s hips, Harry grabbed his wrists, pressed them against the smooth parquet flooring underneath them, and leant forward.
“You needn’t worry, mum, everything’s is going great. We’ve no plans to kill each other in the immediate future, and Draco won the small discussion we had last week about changing the brand of tea we buy.”
“I don’t need to guess that, Director Potter. I bet that in an attempt to be all responsible and mature, you escaped a department head meeting or perhaps a briefing with Kingsley.”
Up until that point, he’d never felt like that, and the hurt of it all had made him bitter and determined to make Harry feel as miserable as he possibly could. In that regard, things had blown up in his face, and he’d most definitely taken his retaliation a little bit far―
Draco tilted his head a little, giving him better access, and silently inviting him to continue with the kiss. Harry gnawed a little, playfully toying with Draco’s bottom lip, then added a bit of suction, claiming both of Draco’s lips.
“No need to lay it on this thick, Malfoy,” he said with a faint smirk that was entirely uncharacteristic and baffled Draco somewhat.
He didn’t know whether it was the fact that he was still wearing his Auror uniform that made him bold, or whether it was the fact that arguing about an engagement party with Molly made him giddy because it made the fact that he and Draco were engaged so much more real, but he wasn’t about to give in to Molly.
“I admit it’ll be weird, but I think I can handle it. If I can’t, I’ll let you know immediately. It’ll either be our agreed hand signal or my safeword, Sir.”
The silence that followed his announcement told Harry everything he needed to know. Even though sixteen years had passed since the end of the war, some of the Ministry’s department heads still struggled to fully comprehend that there was a fundamental difference between Malfoy’s father’s actions and the man Draco Malfoy had fought so hard to become. His track record spoke for itself, but for some people, past transgressions still outweighed present achievements. Harry couldn’t quite comprehend the reasoning behind such beliefs, but he knew better than to give in to the strong desire to stand up for Malfoy.
Less than a second later, he found himself pressed up against the mirror and let out a soft whimper. The sound flew out of his mouth and a breath of air, and he blinked, mentally adjusting to the shift in Harry’s and his dynamic.
The fact that he’d woken up to the sight of two suitcases, packed and ready, sitting in his and Draco’s bedroom, did not agree with Harry. While he wasn’t the kind of person to overthink things that had perfectly logical explanations and jump to conclusions that caused unnecessary drama, Harry was also acutely aware of the fact that he hadn’t exactly been himself these past few days. Much of that had been due to an inexplicable melancholy, he hadn’t been able and still wasn’t, to thoroughly shake off.
Draco’s moan mixed with his desperate pleas for more and without removing his arms from above his head, he wound his fingers into the pillow cover and squeezed it so tightly that his knuckles turned white.
On top of squeezing his hips possessively, he also tugged on the ropes. They cut into Draco’s skin but not through it, and gasping, Draco moved ever so slightly to adjust to the sensations.
, Harry mused and felt his wolf’s amusement thrum through his entire body. It was as if a rumble of warm, thick laughter rippled through him, laughter only he could hear and feel. Filled with happiness and thoroughly excited about hopefully spending an entire evening of quality time together with Draco, Harry instinctively leant a bit closer. He briefly cursed the fact that there was half a grand piano between him and Draco, promptly adjusted his stance, and reaching out, he placed a single finger on top of the back of Draco’s middle finger.
“Be careful what you ask for, Malfoy. I’d be happy to give you anything you want. All you have to do is ask. I’m nothing if not a good host. So long as you play by my rules, that is. Now, move it. I’d hate to have to use a different way to encourage you, but know this, if I have to, I’ll get physical.”
Most of the room’s furniture was covered with shiny, high-quality black satin sheets, instinctively leading Draco to believe that Harry hadn’t brought him up to the room for a scene. Several old, imposing silver candle-holders stood dotted around the place, filled with thick white candles. Surrounded by all the blackness, the warm flicker of the flames was an arc of brilliant gold. Without a draft to disturb them, the tiny fires burnt steadily. Their peacefulness filled Draco with a sense of calmness, and he continued to take in the room.
Despite getting hungrier by the minute, Harry stayed for a few more minutes. He thoroughly enjoyed watching Draco sleep, even if he couldn’t see his face.
He’d spent the last hour using Draco’s body as his own personal canvas, painting Draco’s pet name onto his back with stinging hot melted wax. Harry was more than just pleased with the result of his efforts; the sense of satisfaction, he currently felt, ran deep. It had seeped right through his pores, into his bones, mixing with the very core of his being. He wanted to remember this moment for all eternity and taking his time to let the scene sink in, he smiled.
Taking one last deep breath, Draco walked up to the counter and stood next to Harry. He stood close enough to make it evident that they belonged together but kept just enough distance to keep Harry’s and his public display of affection to a minimum. Much to his surprise, he caught the elderly man behind the counter looking at them both with a certain kind of fondness.
Draco watched as the thong moved through the air and created a small sonic boom that made him shiver. At the same time, the whip’s fall wrapped itself around Liam’s bare ankles, but he neither flinched nor howled in pain.
Libby shot Draco a defiant glare, then, in a fit of pique, she waved her hand and disappeared together with both their empty plates, bowls, and dirty cutlery. She was sensible enough not to vanish the French Press and Harry’s mug but disappeared with Draco’s, which let him fuming.
Harry relished in the softness of Draco’s cashmere jumper teasing his bare skin. When Draco’s fingertips pressed into the small of his back, he straightened a little and revelled in the jolt of electricity that shot up his spine and then trickled back down, pooling low in his groin, fuelling the smouldering fire that burnt there.
Teddy’s voice was muffled as he was speaking directly into the crook of Harry’s neck, but since his mouth was only inches away from Harry’s ear, he had no problem understanding his godson.
Up until the moment that nagging voice in his head insisted on reminding him that several hundred people would be watching him and Draco and that there was no way to fool their trained eyes. They would be able to spot even the smallest of mistakes and utterly frustrated, Harry let out a growl and flung one of the sofa cushions across the room. He glanced at his wristwatch, registered the time and moving off the sofa, he extended his hand and wandlessly accio’ed the cushion. It flew over to him and wordlessly adjusting the spell, Harry returned it to its designated spot.
“There’s a toy shop two doors down. Want to check it out and see if we can find something for Teddy?” he asked.
“I don’t doubt that, but just so you know, by the time I’m done with you later tonight, your brains will be nothing but useless mush.”
Its blade was perfectly-shaped and made from pure diamond, which made it sharp enough to cut through almost anything. Draco handled the utensil with the utmost care, and with his eyes focused on the parchment that held his design, he drowned out the world around him and began to carve the sigil into the stone.
Miraculously, Potter let him, but just when Draco thought that he’d gained the upper hand, Potter surprised him and licked his cheek. His large, pink tongue was wet and rough to the touch, and Draco pulled a face and shuddered with disgust. Warm wolf saliva now coated half of his face and covering his hand with the sleeve of his robes, he brought it up to wipe the sticky mess away. He succeeded in removing most of the wetness but could still feel the lingering tingling sensation of Potter’s lick. It made him shiver, and he pushed the thought out of his head, lest it decided to consume him, and he started to imagine what more of the same might feel like. It filled him with a strange sort of longing, and while he wasn’t particularly inclined to engage further with wolf-Potter’s tongue, he certainly rather liked the idea of human-Potter licking him all over. Still, he rather vehemently refused to allow the thought to fester and pushing it to the side, he focused on giving Potter an earful.
Harry reached for a fresh coil of rope, hooked his index finger into the loop at the bight, and undoing it, he let the rope drop to the ground beneath his feet. It landed there with a dull thud, one that Harry felt in the soles of his bare feet. He straightened the rope, crouched down once more, and tied a single-column tie around Draco’s right ankle, then gently forced Draco to balance his weight on one leg only. Harry expertly fashioned a futomomo, tightly connecting Draco’s lower leg with his thigh.
After that, he paused and covered Draco’s chest with kisses. As he did so, he slowly worked his way to Draco’s right nipple, and instead of squeezing and twisting it, he flicked his tongue over it, licked it and then bit it hard.
When he removed his hand again, the torn-up napkin had all but disappeared. In its place, a thin coil of black twined rope fell off his finger, landing in a messy heap in the centre of the table. Harry casually glanced around the coffee shop, but nobody paid any attention to them or looked their way.
Ron followed her, carrying a second tray with four plates. Three of the places had chocolate pudding on it, and one had a rather large piece of treacle tart on it.
He quite desperately wanted to do something that might appease Potter, wanted to try to get him to calm down again, but he couldn’t think of anything sensible to say or do. Having to acknowledge that, even if it wasn’t out loud for anyone to hear, pained him a great deal. Nearly eighteen months of research, travel, and various experiments and, for the first time ever, he had nothing to his name, absolutely nothing.
“So, I’m serious about doing a bit of redecorating. It was a spur of the moment decision, but it’s something I feel will benefit
Draco reciprocated and entirely free from troubling thoughts about the never-ending stream of work that perpetually cluttered up his desk, Harry allowed himself to relax even further, comfortable with this moment, the here and now. There was no place he’d rather be. Enjoying a peaceful cup of coffee together with the man who had boldly stolen his heart―and several pieces of his sanity―was everything and more. It was perfection. He felt grounded, but most of all, he felt at home, and as though he belonged.
“No. I won’t, at least not in that way. My boy doesn’t like that sort of pain. But I can wrap the fall of my whip around him without leaving the tiniest mark on him. Instead of a nasty red welt, it’ll feel like a tickle.”
His mother’s venomous glare made Draco’s blood run cold, and he instinctively tightened his hold on his favourite coffee cup and clenched his other hand in his lap.
Even now, at lunchtime, and despite the sky being clear and cloudless, it wasn’t exceptionally warm. The wind had scattered golden, yellow, brown and red leaves all over the park’s carpet of grass. Only small patches of green were still visible and bringing the takeaway paper cup with his hot cappuccino up to his lips, Draco took a sip, then crouched down. He wrestled a large stick from Kona, and when she barked in protest, he merely poked his tongue out at her. She barked again and attempted to jump up at him, but Malcolm whistled, and she sat down on her hind legs instead-but looked up at Draco with a pleading look in her great big brown eyes.
There was something about the way she looked at him. It seemed like she already knew why he was here but was choosing to humour him, giving him a chance to be the concerned parent. With Harry finishing up a few events over on the mainland, promotions for his latest Young Adult novel, Draco felt responsible for the children. While all of them were teenagers and could occasionally be quite hard to handle, they did usually listen to him.
He positively delighted in the sensations running through his veins. They set his body on fire, and egged him on, driving him to be more possessive, more dominant, more in control. He felt alive and inexplicably elated, in a way that he hadn’t in days. It felt good and right and simply perfect.
For the past two months, Potter had insisted on weekly lunches, always surprising him with an out-of-the-blue invitation, Draco didn’t know how to turn down. One question from Potter and all his logic went straight out of the window. It was thoroughly infuriating. He’d tried, really tried, to resist Potter’s odd charm, but there was just something about the way Potter looked at him that made it damn-near impossible to resist him. Something in those emerald-green bespectacled eyes fascinated Draco enough that it instantly narrowed his list of answers down to all but one; ‘
A smile tugged at the corners of his mouth, and the thought became a feeling that enveloped him completely. He felt safe and secure and gradually slipped further and further into his submission until there was only one word left in his mind.
“I know so. I’ll leave through the floo if you don’t mind. Since I’m already in London, I might as well stop by mum’s house and say hello. I can always head back to Romania from there.”
Harry’s words held such promise that Draco couldn’t help but feel a thousand per cent sure that Albert would, at some point, find himself reunited with the love of his life.
“My brave little prince, well done, you’re such a good boy,” Harry murmured the words against Draco’s lips, knowing fully-well what effect they were having on him.
His cock twitched excitedly, and he wanted Harry inside of him more than anything else. There was literally absolutely nothing he wanted more. He wanted Harry to fill him, with his tongue, his fingers, his cock, a toy, anything. If Harry wanted to claim his hole and fuck him raw, he was more than okay with that.
Harry gave him a pointed look, carefully set his coffee mug down on the table, then crossed his arms over his chest.
He used both his hands to squeeze Draco’s wrists, and this time his grasp was a lot firmer than before, and Draco felt him repositioning his restrained hands. When Harry had first grabbed him, he’d placed his wrists on his lower back, but now he pushed further up, towards the centre of his back.
“Absolutely fascinating, darling,” she whispered, then withdrew to tell her husband that she simply had to check on their son.
His behind tingled pleasantly, and a swell of anticipation washed over him. It rolled down his shoulders and trickled along his spine, then pooled low in the centre of his groin, increasing the throbbing sensation in both his buttocks. He swallowed hard and quietly followed Stefan down the staircase and into the airy open-plan kitchen with its light and smooth wooden flooring. The kitchen led straight into a spacious dining room, and leaning against the multi-purpose island in the centre of the room, Draco watched Stefan fill the electric kettle with freshly filtered water, then flick the switch.
Draco’s expression darkened considerably, and Harry briefly thought about whether or not he should duck down to evade a wandless stinging hex, but abandoned the idea when Draco made a conscious effort to keep his cool.
Naturally, despite growing up and becoming a mostly responsible human being, there were still things about Harry that Draco didn’t think would ever change. Even nine years after they’d both graduated from a voluntary eighth year at Hogwarts, Harry was still the kind of Gryffindork who jumped headfirst into all sorts of precarious situations. His proclivity for getting himself into a serious pickle was genuinely astounding, and Draco often wondered how he hadn’t died of a heart attack just yet. He’d most definitely come close on quite a few occasions.
Potter coughed and cleared his throat, then looked away. For a while, his gaze wandered around the room, but eventually, it settled on his and Draco’s Auror Academy certifications. They’d both passed with flying colours, and after they’d moved into this office together, Draco had insisted on framing them and putting them up on the wall. For a while, Potter had repeatedly taken them down. He’d only stopped after Draco had applied a permanent sticking charm to the back of both frames.
Harry cleans up the leftovers, and Walter heads out onto Diagon Alley for a stroll. All in all, it’s just another ordinary day here at Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes. Before George disappears back into his workroom, Harry makes a few wild guesses about his latest inventions, but George remains tight-lipped and refuses to give anything away.
Even around his ex-boyfriend Malcolm, Charlie, Liam, Caleb and Stefan, Draco kept a small part of himself hidden. It wasn’t easily discernible or necessarily especially evident, but Harry could tell.
“I’d treat you like a Hippogriff and bow, but I’m not going to give you that satisfaction and make you the leader of his small pack, so do us both a favour and behave, OK?”
“I don’t sue, I prosecute, and trust me, you wouldn’t want to be the defendant. I show no mercy, and I always win.”
And with that, he kissed Draco deeply. At the same time, he shoved his hand underneath one of the many pillows, retrieved another phial of lube, and breaking away from the kiss, he shifted and moved into a kneeling position. He remained astride Draco’s thighs and holding Draco’s gaze, he watched him swallow hard as he coated his hand with a generous helping of lube.
Potter opened his mouth as if to object something, then simply closed it again. Draco let him shove his legs away, then watched him stalk out of the room and down the corridor towards the cellar kitchen where he forcefully pushed a chair out of the way and slammed several kitchen cupboards.
Still, Harry genuinely appreciated Draco giving him the chance to take the time to regenerate. Now that he knew the reason for his recent depressive mood, dealing with it felt easier and a lot less of a chore. The fact that Draco had made it his mission to help him work through it also made things simpler.
Rose’s eyes may have sparkled before, but now they shine brighter than the sun. She nods with enthusiasm.
Harry’s mildly amused grin grew into a positively predatory smirk, and he crossed his arms over his chest.
Unsure what to make of it, he continued to toy with the unopened envelope, admiring his mother-in-law’s refined handwriting. It was slanted, just like Draco’s, with long, even, and sure quill strokes.
His voice was deliciously soft and low. It had a sweet warmth to it and reminded Harry of thick, golden honey.
He reached for a bottle of his favourite shampoo and took his sweet time washing his hair, then used a large amount of exfoliating body wash, Draco’s preferred foamy concoction, to really scrub every inch of his body. Once he felt clean and had managed to restore some of his energy levels, Harry switched the water off, and pushing the glass door to the shower room open, he stepped out onto the large slip-resistant mat right in front of the cubicle.
He wrapped his arms around Scorpius and enveloped him in a tight hug, holding him close until Scorpius struggled against him and wriggled out of his embrace, looking anything but pleased. Draco bit the inside of his mouth to stop himself from smirking. He figured he had another two years at the most, quite possibly less than that, before Scorpius would read him the riot act each time, he tried to be affectionate.
“For legal reason, I shall keep my responses non-committal. It’ll be easier to talk my way out of any crime I might or might not be about to aid you in committing.”
It was a warm bubbly sort of laugh, and winking at her, he squeezed her upper arm, then walked off, heading into the direction of the window table, Lily had commandeered and turned into her headquarters.
The arrival of their drinks somewhat distracted Harry from responding immediately and grateful for the welcome interruption, Harry reached for his whisky tumbler and loosely curled his fingers around it. He lifted the glass off the bar and moved it, watching as the drink gently swirled around inside its container. As he did so, Harry considered his options: getting up close and personal with Malfoy or getting so drunk that he’d most likely spent all of tomorrow getting intimately acquainted with the toilet bowl.
“The health of my body and mind was of utmost importance to him. He never once allowed me to dive into anything without having all the facts. Sure, he teased, occasionally played a bit dirty, the old dog, but never once allowed me to do anything without informed consent and caution―”
Still, he knew that Lily and Harry often went on long walks together ― mostly to spend quality time together but also to talk. The two of them spoke a lot, about almost anything.
“No big deal. Tell you what, I’ll head back to the reserve tonight, but I’ll be back on Monday and I’ll bring Liam with me. We’ll spend a few days at the Burrow. Mum hasn’t seen Liam in a while. We can organise a family dinner, you know my mum, she won’t be difficult to convince. Afterwards, I’ll drag Harry out for a walk through the village, and I’ll talk to him. How does that sound?”
Draco’s chuckle echoed through the room, bouncing off the tiled walls and taunting him, and his silvery-grey eyes danced with mirth.
The latter was somewhat of a new obsession, and as of late Draco was adamant about joining the post-war movement that demanded the continued overhaul of several thoroughly outdated wizarding laws. His hard-earned position at the Ministry and his reputation as one of the top Prosecutors to ever argue a case in front of the Wizengamot afforded him the privilege to be one of the instigators that insisted the Ministry update its laws and policies sooner rather than later.
Harry continued to tease his hole, flicking his tongue over and around it and Draco’s gripped the steel bar above his head so tightly that he didn’t need to look up to know that his knuckles had turned white. He continued to curl his toes, and when Harry pressed the tip of his finger against his hole and breached him, slipping just an inch inside, he howled with pleasure.
Harry’s voice was thick and dripping with wild, untamed desire. A coil of intense hunger unfurled deep inside of Draco, and despite his best intentions, he let out a low and desperate whimper.
Harry smiled, and while he kept one hand firmly twisted into Draco’s hair, he traced Draco’s lips with the index finger of his other hand, deliberately teasing him.
Harry chanced his luck and appealed to Draco’s voice of reason. His husband was a very logical and rational person, though only when he wanted to be, or rather when he was calm enough to be pragmatic. However, given the current situation, Harry didn’t fault Draco for his slight lapse in clear-sightedness.
“We’ve done it all, Potter, might as well just throw in the sex and call it a done deal. The weekend is coming up, you know I’d fuck you so good.”
Harry didn’t expect Draco to scramble off the bed and he didn’t ask him to. Instead, he stood up, lifted Draco into his arms and carried him into their en-suite bathroom. On the way in, Harry kicked the door shut, then cast a wandless warming charm to raise the temperature inside the room. He also used magic to turn the water taps on and gently easing Draco down, he steadied him with one hand and summoned several of Draco’s essential oils, which he added to the tub.
“Very well, I will tell you then, my love, just remember, you can say no, OK. Do you understand that, my little prince?”
Draco smiled at the memory. His fingers gravitated towards the pulse point on the inside of his wrist. He could feel the steady beat of his heart, working tirelessly to pump oxygen-enriched blood into every part of his body.
Afterwards, he gently eased out of Draco, rolled off him, and spooning around him, he held him tight and charmed the duvet to cover them both. He mumbled a half-hearted cleaning charm to remove some of the stickiness from the sheets, pressed a kiss between Draco’s shoulder blades and pulled him as close against his own body as he possibly could.
“Merlin! You’re stunningly beautiful, my little prince,” Harry exclaimed, filling the room with sweet words of praise.
Potter’s question was entirely rhetorical in nature, but that didn’t stop Draco from replying anyway.
“Given the right incentive I’ll say almost anything, cub, but those words, those are reserved for you and you alone.”
“Marvellous now that I can indulge in a bit of conversation for grownups and hopefully also a gin and tonic.”
A faint blush coloured the milky skin of his cheeks, and Harry licked his lips in silent appreciation, then deliberately lowered his voice down to a low and husky whisper.
Pressing the flat of his hand against the space between Draco’s shoulder blades, Charlie ran his hand up and down Draco’s back, hoping to soothe him that way.
“Me apprehending you, you spewing fire over it, then attempting to bribe an officer of the law for which I will punish you severely.”
While Harry knew how to make Draco melt with a gentle touch, a small gesture, or even just something as simple as a smile, it hadn’t taken him long to work out that his words always robbed Draco is his sanity. They’d discussed it a few times and come to the conclusion that Draco didn’t want to resist him, didn’t even want to try, and he proved it often enough.
Draco snuggled deeper into Harry’s embrace and his favourite fluffy midnight blue bathrobe. Harry had spelt it bigger so that he could drown in it and over the last year or so it had become a bit of a ritual for him to bury himself in Harry’s bathrobe while he recovered from an intense scene.
Harry stopped one step short of crossing the threshold to his and Draco’s living room, but instead of entering the room, he casually leant against the doorframe. Pushing his hands into the deep front pockets of his favourite pair of jeans, Harry quietly observed Draco for a few minutes. He silently took in all of him, what Draco wore, the way he held himself, the way he looked, and even how he breathed.
Harry felt heady with a hunger he hadn’t felt in a week. Something fierce roared to life deep inside of him and unable to resist just how right it felt, he tightened his grip on Draco’s wrist and apparated them both back upstairs to Draco’s room.
This could either go horribly wrong or Harry would hand him the get-out-of-Azkaban-for-free card. Either way, it was his only option.
Oddly enough, and even though he was still a bit miffed at Harry for the epic stunt he’d pulled when they’d visited Charlie in Romania, he was in a good mood.
Just as before, Draco lifted his arm, flicked his finger and the ball changed direction before it had the change to hit him.
Draco nodded and allowed Harry to lead him onto the dancefloor. Harry walked right to the centre, and although Draco felt a little bit self-conscious over the fact that the moment, they started to dance, all eyes would be on them, he forced himself to relax and got into position.
A spark that was bound to set every inch of him on fire, driving him into an entirely different headspace, one that mostly existed in his subconsciousness and only came out to play in moments like this.
I'll also get around to responding to comments very soon but it's parent/teacher day this week so I've got preparations to do.
With that, he turned on his heel and leaving Narcissa’s parlour; he made his way into the entrance hall and floo’ed back to the Ministry.
Once they finally reached one of the fireplaces, Harry had deliberately not picked the nearest one, Draco let Harry push him inside the empty furnace. As they stood inside the small space, Draco felt something covering his eyes and ears. Then, all he could see was blackness, and all he could hear was a strange buzzing noise. Harry’s hand instantly moved to one of his wrists, and Draco felt Harry’s thumb press against his pulse point. The familiar circling motion immediately settled his mind and calmed all of his fears, and even though he couldn’t hear or see, he felt safe and sound.
“And who taught you to say that?” he asked, injecting a bit of an authoritative undertone in his voice.
“Don’t match with the person everyone, including you, thinks I am? Well, Potter, even I, the occasionally uptight, always professional, overly cautious cursebreaker have a few surprises up my sleeve.”
Scorpius took another long look at the moving photograph of Harry, then turned his head and looked at Draco but didn’t immediately say anything.
A few seconds later, he appeared just outside the dragon reserve’s headquarters, and greeting one of his colleagues, he marched inside and headed straight for the Portkey office.
A small sum of that money went to towards acquiring pure essential oil, and other ingredients, of the highest quality, but most of his proceeds from that little side-venture went to fund the ever-rising expenditures of his charity.
Draco watched him for a while, and briefly took a trip down memory lane, remembering his and Malcolm’s relationship. Throughout their relationship, they’d always had a good time, and like Harry, Malcolm had always enjoyed his sass and his snide remarks. He’d never had a problem with his mask of cool indifference, and occasionally he’d even managed to worm his way underneath it and strip back a layer or two. Back then Draco had been much younger, and the scars from the war had been fresh.
Given the situation, and no longer bound by the rules of their high protocol M/s agreement, he, too, got to his feet.
A strange sound escaped Draco’s lips. It was an odd mixture between a groan, a moan, and a muffled scream and when Harry abandoned the idea of leaving a love bite on Draco’s neck and looked up, he saw that Draco had thrown his arm over his face to cover his mouth. A soft chuckle left Harry’s throat, and he moved further up, pushed Draco’s arm away and kissed him deeply and with wild abandon. He crawled halfway up onto the piano and trapping Draco beneath him, he kissed and caressed him, possessively asserting his dominance over the only person in the entire world his wolf accepted as an equal. Draco responded to every stroke of Harry’s tongue and every touch. He arched up against Harry, wound his legs around Harry’s hips to keep him in place, and wrapped his arms tightly around Harry’s neck.
Draco threw his head back, laughing. It took him a full minute before he managed to control himself and bringing his hands up, he wiped tears of laughter from the corners of his eyes.
Glancing up and down the corridor to check that they were alone, Draco, caught in the heat of the moment, allowed his emotions―mainly his annoyance at Harry’s persistent lack of attention―to rule over his actions. Without wasting any time, he first squeezed Potter’s shoulder to get him to turn around, then grabbed a fistful of Harry’s shirt and roughly shoving him up against the wall, Draco leant in and glared at his partner.
However, before he managed to walk off into the general direction of the men’s room, Caleb held him back.
, Draco thought, and with Scorpius’ help, he folded everything neatly, placed it inside his suitcase and closed it. Although it wasn’t necessary, Scorpius insisted on sitting on the lid to help him close the suitcase, and once they were done, Draco chased his son out of his bedroom, and they headed downstairs into the kitchen for a late and light supper.
This time, Draco couldn’t help but frown deeply. He was tempted to ask whether Potter was asking him out but couldn’t manage to get the question to make its way past his lips. Instead, he furrowed his brows deeply, hoping to convey both his surprise and confusion at Potter’s unexpected and sudden lunch invitation, but before he could query Potter’s intentions, Potter explained himself.
Harry forced himself out of his mind and back into the present to order to resume his conversation ― there was a spot of daydreaming, and then there was being downright rude, and that wasn’t the kind of behaviour he wanted to exhibit in front of his future mother-in-law.
He expertly fastened the collar around Draco’s neck, and sealed it with a murmured incantation, feeling Draco shudder at the wisp of magic that washed over him. He gave the O-ring a tiny tug, then kissed Draco, starting slow, then gradually increasing the depth and intensity of the kiss.
“I’d gathered as much; I just don’t know what exactly you’d like me to do. You’re― Your condition― You’re a conundrum.”
“I’m done dating, Charlie, you know that,” he says quite firmly and with a lot of conviction. It’s true. He’s really had enough of putting himself out there and opening up to someone new. Things have gone wrong one too many times, and if Harry is honest―which he usually isn’t, at least not when it comes to matters of the heart―he’s still a bit scarred from the ordeal Jasper put him through.
A pleasant tingling sensation spread from his prostate through every inch of his groin and steadily intensified.
“Did you now? Well, I’m almost done. Would you like to help me or shall I put you back to bed? It would be the sensible thing to do, but your penchant for rule-breaking reminds me of a certain colleague of mine, and I do rather worry about your future at Hogwarts.”
Draco continued to whisper, and bracing himself on his arms, he leant forward and smiled down at Harry with an almost predatory sort of grin.
Not needing to be told twice, Draco salaciously crawled over to Harry. He let his hips sway from side to side, and once he’d crawled in-between Harry’s spread legs, he dutifully placed his hands behind his back and licking his lips, he leant forward and engulfed half of Harry’s cock all at once. He felt Harry’s hand slide to the base of his cock, then he removed it altogether and a moment later, Harry’s fingers were in his hair, forcing him down, forcing him to swallow more of his cock.
He called out and whipping his head around, Draco abruptly stopped pacing the kitchen of his Notting Hill flat and stood perfectly still, looking like a deer caught in the headlights of a truck.
“I’m here, my little prince, I’ve got you, you’re safe. I’ll stay with you, my love. That’s it, just let it go, let me take care of you, I’ve got you my precious, sweet, sweet boy, I love you so much.”
Harry’s words pierced through Draco’s chest, and he gasped as the realisation of what was about to happen dawned on him. He blinked and felt his eyes fill with tears. They stung, but he resolutely held them back, unwilling to cry just yet. He was quite sure that he wouldn’t be able to control them for every long, but for the moment, he wanted to at least appear calm and collected.
Harry’s first reaction was to cough, then he took a deep breath and a rather large sip from his wine.
Draco felt mildly tempted to roll his eyes but resisted the urge. Harry was quite the accomplished wizard with exquisite skills and in-depth knowledge of complicated spells and some ancient magic.
Harry’s stomach gave another disgruntled rumble, and frowning, he swallowed a sigh and grudgingly got to his feet.
“I swear that I’ll always be your faithful and loyal submissive, to honour you, respect you, and let you guide me, teach me, and protect me. I promise to trust you, obey you, and accept you as my one true Master. I desire your pain, your pleasure, your love, the safety of your embrace, and the comfort of your words. I swear to love you for all eternity. I, Draco Malfoy, will always be your little prince.”
He gently tapped his finger against the collar around Draco’s neck, subtly reminding him of it and the rules that came with wearing the snug-fitting grey leather band.
Draco savoured his tea in silence, and drawing his wand, he lazily flicked it at the kitchen table, and with a few non-verbal spells, he cleaned up the leftovers of his and Harry’s breakfast, then made his way upstairs to continue the monumental task of redecorating the house.
He craved Harry’s touch so badly that he was prepared to do absolutely anything to get it. He wanted Harry to fuck him, and he wanted to come, but he knew that asking Harry for any of those pleasures was entirely useless right this moment. He’d given up his right to make any decisions about if and when he was allowed to come, and Draco knew that Harry intended to milk his desperation until he cried and begged and pleaded and cried some more. Today, Draco was ready to do all of that and more.
“You tried that, Malfoy, it didn’t work. I am charging you with attempting to bribe an officer of the law.”
Without stopping to think about his actions, Harry walked through the open door and straight into Draco’s bedroom. Unlike the living room, Draco’s sleeping quarters were spick and span. The bed looked slept in but was made and the clothes, he intended to wear later, were already waiting for him. He’d placed them neatly over the back of the comfortable armchair that stood by the window.
I have a whole bunch of correspondence to catch up, I am aware of that, but after posting this chapter, I'm going to need a bit of a break from the computer (also have a bit of a cold at the moment) and a healthy dose of coffee. I'll write replies later.
“Certainly, Director Potter. First of all, I did not trespass onto Government property. I received a summons via owl earlier this morning―”
Draco nodded and taking off his apron, he placed it on the worktop, then left the spacious kitchen area and walked into the living room.
Once he was done, he kissed Draco softly, ran both his hands along the length of Draco’s arms and pulled them down, instructing him to keep them dangling at his sides, then checked his harness over.
Most of the time, Draco was well able to deal with everything life threw at him, but his present headspace and their current environment meant that he relied on Harry a little more than he usually would and Harry was okay with that, more than fine. Right now, Draco wanted Harry to take care of him and control him, and Harry yearned to give him everything he wanted and needed and then some.
Something in his facial expression changed, and with a slightly pained look, he pressed his lips tightly together. It made him look like a strange mixture of someone who was holding his breath to avoid having to tolerate the pungent smell of blue cheese and someone who was fighting an internal battle.
Glaring icy daggers, he fixed his narrowed eyes on Potter, deliberately making it very clear that he was thoroughly displeased at having been played.
Roísín’s next question surprised Draco a little, and letting his head fall back, he looked up at Harry, who briefly looked down at him, caressed the side of his neck with his fingertips, and then focused his attention back on Roísín.
When it came to those things, nobody dared to mess with her, not even her husband. With everything else, all Molly wanted was for her children to listen. She was a smart woman and an excellent argument often managed to change her mind, but stubborn behaviour and sulky expressions hardly ever got you her attention. Although, it did often result in a whack around the head with a dishtowel.
Harry rocked him in his arms, kissed him softly, caressed his flushed skin and gave him some time to come down from his almost-high.
He fucked himself slowly and steadily, and the dildo’s radiating heat made him nearly delirious with desire. His arse thrummed from his earlier spanking, and his tight channel moulded itself fantastically around the toy, welcoming its intrusion over and over again. His prostate felt thick and hard, but the slow place wasn’t enough to push him over the edge.
Draco’s knees gave in, not completely, but enough for him to slide a few inches down the length of the mirror.
He knew what was coming, but that didn’t seem to dampen his excitement in any way and smiling, Harry allowed himself one last longing look at the beautiful words he’d, in a manner of speaking, etched into Draco’s skin. He then slowly dragged the tips of the flogger’s tresses across Draco’s skin, teasing his back and buttocks, as well as his thighs.
A pleasant shiver of excitement trickled down Draco’s spine and pulling back a little, he locked eyes with Harry. The whispered praise did unspeakable things to him and feeling his knees shake just a bit, Draco was grateful for Harry’s strong hold on him. Harry reached for his hand and grasped it tightly.
His mother’s sudden and unexpected remark had flustered him entirely, and he could feel his cheeks burn. They’d undoubtedly turned crimson, though this time it wasn’t because he was embarrassed, but because he’d managed to clog up his airways with a breath of air of all things.
Harry forced himself to snap out of the madness dancing around his own head and inhaling deeply, he held his breath for a few seconds, then exhaled slowly. Having reached the ground floor, he made his way into the living room, following the sound of the blaring television.
As usual, the old LPK warnings apply. This is a proper smut chapter with a very healthy dose of kink, so no eating or drinking while you read. If you do, and end up choking, I take no responsibility for your subsequent trip to the ER. If you need a session with a Dom/me, I can offer advice on the vetting process but I am afraid Harry, Charlie, and Caleb are presently all unavailable...although if you proposition them nicely enough, you might just capture their interest.
“Sorry, I got side-tracked. I meant to ask you whether you want coffee or tea with your dessert. That was the whole reason why I was trying to get your attention anyway.”
The longer he suppressed the wolf, the fiercer it got, and the more of his magic Potter had to use to keep it hidden from view. It was a battle with only one outcome: slow but sure self-destruction.
Draco regretted his discomposed exclamation the moment the words had left his mouth. He watched the expression on his mother’s face change in the blink of an eye. It went from concerned to livid with anger in practically no time, and Draco shrunk in his armchair and hastily glanced around for an escape route.
Once he’d reached that position, Harry allowed him a moment to utilise the muscles in his torso. They flexed underneath his taut stomach, and once Harry was sure that Draco had relaxed into the tie, he let go of the rope that connected Draco’s double-column tie to the bamboo above. Draco lowered his arms further, and his hands gently dangled above the ground. Harry swiftly secured the futomomo, locking it into place, and once he’d done so, he dressed the peach tie, pulling Draco just a little higher.
“They all came over for a month, and we never talked about it again. I’ve only stood up to her on a handful of occasions though, mostly I let her fuss. It isn’t that I don’t mind it or especially like it but―”
Harry stifled a yawn and continued to toy with the Montblanc pen in his hand. Its skeleton body made from pure white gold and it featured emerald gemstones in the shape of tender blossoms as well as the delicate leaves. Although the design was overly elaborate, Harry couldn’t deny its beauty entirely. There was something about the way the stones were set, a unique way that entirely concealed the setting that held them in place, creating the illusion that the gemstones were floating atop a transparent resin. Harry also liked the combination of premium diamonds which, together with the emerald gemstones, served as a perfect accent.
“I rather thought you were the one who lost his marbles, Tom. In fact, I could give you an entire list of reasons why you’re nothing but a barmy old man, but I’m no longer a hormonal teenager, and as such, I’ll refrain from such low-blowing insults. Man, to man, Tom, shall we?”
changed Patronus also insisted on teasing him about feelings and the desires he’d suppressed for far too long.
“And neither you should,” Harry said and frowned when Draco placed something or other, rolled up in a napkin, in his lap.
The three of them amicably chatted for a little while longer, and Harry promised Albert that they would stop by again soon and buy a few more bits and bobs for Teddy.
Harry watched in horror as the heavy metal chains sailed through the air, heading directly into his and Draco’s direction.
“There’s something I’d like to talk to you about,” Potter said, then paused to look around. “But not here, these walls tend to have ears, no matter how many silencing charms you throw at them.”
Chuckling at his own silly mawkishness, Harry traced a Double Carrick Bend onto Draco’s back and delighted in the mixture of a low hum and a content sigh that escaped past Draco’s lips. Encouraged, Harry traced a beautiful Celtic Knot onto Draco’s pale skin, and finally, a Fisherman’s Eye, weaving lines of invisible rope together to create a stunning pattern. He wasn’t drawing the most intricate of knots, but with no actual rope to play with, Harry was happy to leave it at that.
“Yes,” he said, “I’ve never been more serious about anything in my life. I don’t have a ring for you, that is not yet and if you even want, one, but fuck, Draco, we both know we’re dead serious about this relationship, hell, we spent months fixing this place up with the very intention of building a future together. It just feels right, marry me.”
“If by safe, you mean whether me and my boy are dressed, yes, we are decent. Well I am, but from where you are you can’t see Liam anyway. You can open your eyes.”
He properly revelled in it, and when Harry motioned for him to come closer, he obeyed without hesitation.
Like this, without any of his masks to keep him safe, it almost felt like Draco was an entirely different person. Not inherently so, and Charlie was sure that Draco still possessed the ability to glare at a moment’s notice, and dish out a healthy dose of his signature sass, but despite all that, right now there was something about him that wasn’t there when he hid behind his veil of security. It wasn’t easy to put into words and Charlie decided not to bother.
It was harsh and unforgiving, and his right arse cheeks felt like someone had set it on fire. It stung, and burnt, and thrummed, and throbbed, and Draco let out a low moan as the pain washed over him.
Taking control of Draco came easy to Harry. Mostly because Draco had no qualms about letting him, but also because it was simply an intrinsic reaction to Draco’s willing submission. It was almost second nature, much like breathing, eating, and sleeping, yet Harry never quite allowed his own control over his domination to slip. He preferred to remain grounded and present in the moment, at least with one foot. At the very best of times, letting his dominant side control every aspect of him seemed too risqué.
“Do you want coffee? Some tea? I think we bought biscuits. Or I can cut you up a few celery sticks. I made that hummus dip you like.”
Draco tried to think of a scathing remark to that but no matter which way he looked at it, Potter’s answer made perfect sense. It was reasonable and without resorting to pure childishness―which he wasn’t willing to do―he couldn’t find any fault with Potter’s logic. Therefore, rather than actively trying to turn working with Potter into something they both hated with a passion, he decided on a different approach altogether, one, he hoped, would benefit his and Potter’s relationship.
Once Draco felt a little more like himself, Harry squired a bit more lube onto his hand and toying with Draco’s balls, he massaged them gently, squeezed them lightly and then pressed his thumb against Draco’s perineum, causing him to buck his hips and beg for more.
Charlie instinctively knew that he had nothing to worry about and that his boy would be perfectly fine on his own. He checked for his wand, then unlocked the front door, and opening it, he stepped over the threshold, then closed it again.
Harry hadn’t done anything, and Draco wasn’t really mad, but at this stage, he wanted to get this own way just for the sake of it. Draco suspected that Harry knew that, he could read him like a book after all, but even if he’d seen right through his charade, Harry wasn’t letting anything on.
Right this moment, Harry stood with his back straight and with one hand casually dangling at his side. He’d pushed the other into the pocket of his tailored black slacks. The pair of trousers fit Harry like a glove, and Draco appreciated everything he saw. Harry wasn’t wearing his robes and had replaced the jacket of his formal Auror uniform with a black suit jacket ― these days he hardly wore his uniform in the office but always kept it at hand. It was always neat and tidy and smelled of freshness and authority.
Harry smiled and turning his attention back to ‘Tom’, he opted for a bit of a daredevil move. He moved as close to the edge of the mire-free safe space, he and Draco occupied, weighed up his options and deciding that jumping across the swamp was out of the question, he raised his wand up and cast a spell that conjured a sturdy vine.
It flew over to him and catching it with ease, he gently fastened it around Draco’s neck, making sure that it fitted perfectly. When he was confident that it was neither too tight nor too loose, he drew the outline of an ancient rune onto Draco’s shoulder and locked the collar into place with a mumbled incantation.
“I mean, there’s nothing wrong with the bathroom. There’s just something that’s off about the colours in the room. They don’t especially excite me.”
Draco turned around to face him and looked at him with a dirty smirk sparkling in his silvery-grey eyes.
Smirking at his reflection in the mirror, Harry ran his fingers over his steadily growing facial hair. It looked a bit wild, and since he didn’t really like that aspect of it, he rooted through his large toiletries bag and searched for his electric Muggle shaver, hoping Draco had packed it for him.
He used a third ice cube to subject Draco’s right butt cheek and the back of his right thigh to the same treatment, then paused to pepper the spaces between Draco’s temporary wax tattoo with tiny kisses, ever so slowly working his way up. Harry used his tongue to lap up some of the melted water, and when his kisses reached Draco’s neck, he nibbled at the soft flesh, sucked it into his mouth and gradually increased the intensity with which he continued to draw the skin into his mouth.
They silently walked into the kitchen, and letting Draco enter first, Charlie moved over to the table and sat down, but turned around and watched Draco move around the kitchen.
Harry generally treated him as his equal and rarely demanded his complete obedience. Especially allotted times and the playroom were the only exceptions to that rule. Their relationship wasn’t strictly vanilla, and it wasn’t purely kinky either. The lines between the two worlds were forever blurred, but it was consensual, and Draco liked it that way. Harry didn’t expect him to submit all the time, but he also never demanded that he suppress that part of himself to keep up pretence. While Draco didn’t have any regrets about any of his previous relationships, it was what Harry and he had built together that genuinely worked for him.
He’d purposefully tied the rope right across Draco’s nipples, and Draco’s cock and balls sat snuggly between two diamond knots. One knot placed pressure against the base of Draco’s cock, while the other knot rested snuggly just behind Draco’s balls. The continued influence of the rope and its tightness would most definitely provide Draco with some delightful friction each time he took a step forward, sat down or stood up.
“You should talk about the way Harry, and you communicate with each other. It’s beautiful. I think you have an amazing relationship. Forgive my big mouth, but sometimes I look at the two of you together, and I can’t help but wonder why Harry hasn’t permanently collared you yet. If anyone should have a collaring ceremony, then it’s the two of you.”
Instead, he drew his wand, mumbled a few spells in rapid succession, and left it up to magic to clear away the remnants of Harry’s and his dinner. He didn’t have the head for doing the dishes or anything else.
There was a certain gleam in Malcolm’s eyes, and without actually saying a lot, he conveyed that Draco didn’t need be specific about the nature of Harry’s and his relationship.
“Yes, they are stunningly beautiful. Unicorns are so precious, looking at them will simply take your breath away. You know, my great-great-grandmother kept a few unicorns on a secluded pasture in the forest near Malfoy Manor. She loved those creatures and would spend hours with them, petting them and telling them stories. Unicorns prefer a woman’s touch, so they didn’t mind having her around. When I was young, I spent hours begging her portraits for stories about the unicorns.”
“Draco’s a good mentor. He’s learnt a great deal, and he’s both passionate about the lifestyle and patient when it comes to explaining stuff.”
A loud round of applause, led by Caleb, who was waiting for him in the centre of the stage, echoed through the room, and breathing deeply to calm his fluttering nerves, Draco confidently approached Caleb. They shook hands, and Caleb patted him on the back of his shoulder before handing him the hand-held microphone. As he did so, he leant in close, and for a brief moment, he pressed his lips to Draco’s ear.
For today’s scene, Harry hadn’t restrained Draco in any way, he hadn’t deemed it necessary. There were no ropes, no cuffs and no blindfold, yet he couldn’t shake the feeling that his words wound themselves around Draco’s body tighter than any string of exquisite bondage rope he possessed.
“In a minute, darling. Be a good girl now, and go wash your hands. Take your brother with you. Warm water and soap, don’t forget that.”
He looked around the pub to make sure they weren’t the centre of attention, but over the chatter of the other patrons, the music, and the various sounds coming from behind the bar, there wasn’t anybody looking their way.
Harry kissed the side of his neck, nibbled on his earlobe, and biting down, he trapped the sensitive flesh between his teeth and pulled.
Draco felt Harry slowly rise to his feet and pepper the side of his neck with kisses before leaving another possessive bitemark.
It had taken some extensive renovations, and a lot of help from his dedicated team of firefighters, to turn the three separate flats into one large house. Somehow, he and Stefan had persevered all through the chaos that came with living on a construction site and now had the pleasure of sharing a stunning and absolutely spacious home.
It only took Harry a moment to recognise her as Tifereth, a magnificent rigger with a creative approach to harness construction. Her genuine love for Shibari and her dynamic style of sadism which she conveyed through engaging, hands-on methods of performance continually blew his mind away.
Harry straightened up and resumed kneading Draco’s shoulders. He applied a bit more pressure than before, and Draco let out a long sigh. He shifted on his chair and remained silent for several minutes.
Draco’s response was muffled, and even though it wasn’t really a word, Harry knew exactly what it meant. Draco agreed with him; everything he’d just said was correct.
To be honest, Harry doesn’t really know how Ron does it all, and he absolutely admires him for his patience. That’s precisely why he after his best friend has left to return to the Ministry, doesn’t make his way downstairs to help George run the shop but remains upstairs in his flat. He does, however, dispatch a quick note to let George know that he’s got a couple of things to take care of and that the kids need looking after. George responds with a short ‘
“I didn’t know the first thing about BDSM then. I’d heard the acronym before, knew what it stood for. But that was the extend of my knowledge of the subject. Of course, there’d been some kinky sex along the way, but then again, these days I’m no longer sure if you can call a pair of metal cuffs and a few toys ‘kinky’ but, I don’t judge. Kink and let kink. Anyways, the things I’d indulged in didn’t even remotely come close to the stuff I enjoy now.
“Yes, you know that. And they know that too. But the bad decisions of my past sell papers, just like me putting bad guys into Azkaban sells papers. When it suits them, I’m the reformed death eater, when it doesn’t, I’m the guy who turned Harry Potter gay.”
Harry lowered his gaze and reaching for his coffee mug, he used it to shield his victorious smile from everyone else in the room and silently thanked Merlin for the ease with which he’d been able to make his announcement. Some of his other ideas had required considerably more effort before he’d been able to put them into fruition.
Harry teasingly toyed with his cock, playing with it more than actually stroking it properly. He circled his thumb around the head, squeezed the hot hard flesh, and paid a ridiculous amount of attention to his balls.
He decided right there and then that Potter, or at least the version of Potter he’d just met, was a confounding conundrum, a puzzle Draco wanted to solve.
He didn’t break away for the longest time, but when he finally did, they were both breathless and panting hard.
Though not entirely unsuspected, but surprising nonetheless, Draco’s laugh echoed through the room. His stunningly beautiful silvery-grey eyes―two deep pools of swirling storms―twinkled with mirth and Harry couldn’t help but smile.
Harry knew him well enough to know that he was fuming on the inside, but Draco never once showed his true feelings. He practically allowed Libby to get away with murder and it only fuelled Harry’s conviction that the house-elf had learnt to copy Draco’s sass and she did it perfectly too.
They settled on a lazy rhythm and perfect mixture of thrusts and slow and deliberate hip-rolling. Draco moaned into their kiss and very slowly breaking away from the deep and possessive kiss, Harry trailed wet kisses along Draco’s jawline and peppered his neck with tiny nips, bites, licks, and kisses. He gnawed at Draco’s earlobe, exhaled hotly and revelled in the full-body shiver that surged through Draco.
“My story starts a little over three years ago, although, I suppose, in reality, it all started back when I was eleven.”
Kona interrupted them again, and after wrangling with her and winning the saliva-covered chewed stick from her, Draco tossed as far as he possibly could and with a loud bark, that echoed through the nearly empty park, she enthusiastically bounced after her current favourite toy.
“Drop the lawyer’s act, Malfoy. I’m not recording this conversation, and there are no extendible ears hidden away anywhere. Also, Potter is not hiding under his invisibility cloak.”
A blood-red bird greater than natural size flew into the misty white and grey that made up the September skies, disappearing only to dive down and splash the surface of the lake. The feat caused droplets to fly into the air on their agenda, imitating their guest before returning to the larger body. Draco's back was resting on the harsh bark of a prodigious tree, it's origin untrackable and species unidentifiable but Draco could feel magic pulsate through the trunk and the roots that weaved and wound across and beneath the ground. While the wood of the tree was a very dark shade when the sun hit at a certain time of day Draco could swear the organism seemed to glow a mystical shade of gold. The leaves were already a phantom of blue but with autumn rapidly approaching the leaves mixed with all shades of a summer sunset. As if mother nature were trying her attempts at watercolor. Tiny white mushrooms littered the base of the grand tree. The steam and cap were both colored a beautiful cream and had a sprinkle of black dots all askew, the gills seemed to glow an enchanting purple while petit rodents gather and feed off the seemingly harmless shrooms.
Instead of zoning out on Potter's eyes, Draco decided to take in his whole presences. His hair was, as always, a mess as well as his robes. The same old round glasses stood proudly on the bridge of the Gryffindor's nose, which appeared to only exist to frame the boy's spectacular eyes, similar to how a picture frame emphasized a work of art in a museum. The famous lightning scar mocked Draco by slightly glowing red with irritation. A calculating expression was painted over Potter's features like they were molded onto him.
Draco pinches his pants and bit his lip. " I try to contribute as much to society as I can and as much as it will let me. I understand that my previous action in association with the war are unforgivable and inexcusable, but I still wish to help the community clean up the mess I took part in making. It's the least I can do." Draco dared a glance up at Headmistress McGonagall only to find an approving stare directed his way.
Potter and him were getting along so well before he ruined it. Draco's fingers lightly traced the pages of his notes as he started at his doodles.
" Thought I instructed you two to head to your common rooms!" His soothing British accent gave a false sense of security, but before anything could happen Professor Surly grabbed Professor Colin's arm and stopped him. Professor Colin's lose, brown curls that compliment his thin face in a strange, handsome way bounce slightly as he turned to look at Professor Surly.
Taking longer than Draco liked, he arrived at the infirmary. The familiar feeling of nausea and dizziness no doubt from the blood loss presented itself as he pushed open the doors; breathing heavily and stepping hard.
tall. Mind you Draco isn't super tall, but he's always been on the lengthier side, but this girl made Draco feel like a dwarf.
Draco felt one wet tear slide down his face and the feel a bile climbing up his throat before he practically leap out of his skin and ran out the doors into the halls.
"Oh, Draco. I don't think of you that way at all." Her tenderness was something Draco didn't deserve, he knew that, but he feared if he refuted her claims she would turn upset.
Draco gathered up his necessities and began to head out before his roommates voice startled him to a halt.
Draco took his seat by the back (the same seat he has sat in all year) and carefully took a bowl of stew, using his spoon to prod the contents within. Draco's appetite had decreased greatly ever since the battle at Hogwarts. Finally deciding he needed to eat at least something, Draco raised the spoon to his thin lips and slowly engulfed the metal with his mouth. Moments later he dove back into the stew and popped another spoonful into his mouth. The entire bowl radiated the smell of salt, but Draco preferred his foods on the saltier side anyhow.
Potter laughed, as well as a handful of students and even Professor Surly let out a huff with a smile. Considering the strangeness of the dementors change in target, no more students faces the creature today in favor of Professor Surly explaining the boggarts goals and values in excruciating detail.
Potter cleared his throat, as if it was keeping him from continuing. " I'm sorry you assumed I though of you that away, and that you're being punished for helping people." Draco's eyes nearly popped out of his sockets as his jaw hit the floor.
" Potter." The question came out as more of a statement when Draco's legs suddenly became weights that tightly hugged the ground, pulling him to a stop. Potter slowed down to a halt about four feet from Draco, his right hand grasped the back of his neck as he looked around, he looked anxious. Potter's arm dropped back down to his sides. " Mal-"
Draco changed into his nightshirt and pants before tucking himself under cool sheets. The memory of rudimentary fundamental civil conversations repeating in his head as he slowly fell asleep.
Draco's body finally got the message his brain was sending and took off like a bullet in the other direction.
In fact, that head of hair look quite familiar. Draco's legs began caring him to the desk at the other end of the room. That hair, it had a slight purple glint in it, almost like a raven's feathers. And why was it so ruffled... oh dear sweet Merlin!
Just a bunch of half-wits who screwed up colossally. His father, who was now in Azkaban, gifted Draco a ring before his trial. The ring was thick and silver with small pieces of jade around to grant the ring a little color. In the center was the Malfoy family crest, looking more dull than ever before. Although Draco could not wear the ring with pride as he would have in his younger years, that didn't stop him from having it situated on his right hand at all times. The piercing light that shown off of the smooth surface blinded Draco each morning.
"You've been staring at each other all week. I thought the animosity between you both had gone?" Draco noticed Luna's headband had a small rip in the side, he has to remember to tell her later.
The edge of the lake was a location Draco found himself frequenting often, it's tranquility soothed his scrambled mind and the magic that seemed to radiate from the spot remedied his abused body. Glancing back at the school, skyline painted in various shades due to the setting sun was like looking back at an angel in disguise. Haunting memories leaped at him from every corner and yet the establishment still never ceased to take his breath away.
He gazed back down at the thin scratch on his palm, before closing his hand into a fist and letting it drop to his sides.
" Sorry I laughed, it's just not the answer I was expecting." Draco's wiggled his fingers around a small group a grass strands and pulled lightly, making them wrap around his fingers and intertwined with his hand. He could see out of the corner of his eye that Potter was looking at him so he turned and stared back.
Draco stood as well and followed Harry's lead. They filled the silence as they made their way to the staircases with comments about treacle tarts and bad impersonations of Professors and then their stifled laughter after getting caught (and scolded) by the " New Snape".
" I was tardy to my first class, and as a repercussion the Professor required I stay late to assist in her the cleaning process of the class room; making me late to my next class, which then that teacher required I stay late to assist them as well and so on." Draco managed in one breath. Everyone in the room was staring at him, brows raised and eyes fixed. No one talked, not until the Professor responded.
Draco felt the beginning of another wave of anxiety start to crash over him, but the fragile fragrance surrounding him kept him grounded. The pink buds of a couple blossoms accompanied orange, blue, red, yellow, and the occasional purple florets that covered the court yard. Despite the rainbow of plant life the circumjacent herbage provided, the overall dominate color was green.
"Oh, n-no! Wait, your babies are right-!" The owl shrieked once more as shy flapped her wings more, created a gust that blew over Draco's face. The Eagle-owl stood at an intimidating two feet, her wingspan had to be five or six feet long. She darted over to Draco in a second, her talons long and sharp. Her wings spread out wide as she came closer.
It wasn't like he hadn't seen Harry since he came back, for heaven sakes he had a few classes with the bastard, but that didn't mean his stomach didn't clench every time he caught a glimpse of the boy savior. Boy. Aren't they all adults now? For some reason, it was hard to call any of the men or women.
Draco and Harry shares a puzzling gaze until Professor Colin turned toward them once more. " Boy, could you get to bed sooner rather than later?"
Nevertheless, Draco carried on and only stopped when he stood right in front of the soapy, sud filled den. Draco grasped the edge of the tub as he closed his eyes to inhaled the scented bubbles that engulfed his senses.
"Thank you, but the rest of Hogwarts seems to beg to differ." Luna tucked a lock of her drying hair behind her ear as she turned to Draco.
Draco's small, bare feet padded into the manor's large living room that night. A long, thick blanket dragged behind Draco as he crept around the dark house. The blanket was handcrafted and expansive, it showed a map of the stary night sky with dotted lines connecting all constellations visible on it. The silk-like fuzz was tugged across the cold wooden floor as Draco bundled a little ball of the sheet in his fists. He searched around the overly large and dark living room in search of his father. Once he spotted Lucius' long hair falling off the edge of the black couch, Draco waddled over in sleepy gait to grasp the fabric of his father's silk nightshirt. Lucius sturred as he turned his head towards his son.
So Harry and Malfoy take the elevator down the innumerable floors and go outside to a small alleyway. Malfoy slips his hand into Harry's and before Harry can even feel surprised he Apparates them. They land in a familiar spot just outside of Hogsmeade, slushy snow soaking into their shoes.
The two of them ate shortbread, and Arthur sipped his tea, making a sigh of approval as he sat back in his chair. Draco could sense there was something the older man was holding back. It was only when Draco vanished the crumbs from the splintered wood of the table top that Arthur finally spoke.
"Suppose you think you're too good to eat with a Death Eater? No, no, of course, you are. Can't have your adoring fans thinking you'd share crepes with—"
Malfoy rolls the dough for each pasty, light and deft with the rolling pin, into a perfect circle and then absolutely piles on the filling. He heaps a spoonful onto the dough and carefully crimps each pasty, making a perfect seam. It's like they hadn't fought at all as Malfoy puts the pasties into the oven and then stands for a moment looking at the clock over the cold cupboard door.
“Right,” Other Harry starts again, wooden spoon waving in the air as he speaks. “This is awkward as fuck, but we both need it. You hate your life, and I love my life, and the only way for you to stop hating your life and to get from where you are to where I am is through me saying this and you hearing it.” He stops stirring, and wipes his hands on the checkered apron on his front, before his left hand dives into his pocket and brings out a very old, folded many times over, piece of paper. “Merlin, this is dumb.”
, the stretch was magnificent. Draco felt himself open to Harry, felt his muscles acclimatise and accommodate. Harry loved him, and Harry was making love to him. It was miraculous.
Draco nodded, not wanting to blurt out his news immediately. There were social niceties to attend to first; small talk to make, and the impartation of gossip about the various wizarding families that both of them knew. Once luncheon was served, Draco planned to make his announcement. He wasn’t sure what sort of reaction to anticipate, but he hoped, desperately, that his mum would be pleased. She’d always been vocal about wanting a grandchild, and although this mightn’t be the circumstances that Narcissa – or he himself, for that matter – had envisioned, life had made other plans.
The two of them left after that. Greg was telling him something, something about Szymon Lewandowski, and how they planned to thrash him, and the rest of the Magpies, into the middle of next week, but Draco wasn’t listening. He couldn’t really hear his friend, let alone reply. Braithwaite had promised to talk to Marcus, and tell him the situation, so there was nothing for Draco to do except sleep.
Beside him the sheets were cool, and they didn’t have the slightest hint of Harry’s body heat. He peeked over towards the en-suite shower but that was silent too. For a moment Draco felt the race of his heartbeat, and he remembered another morning like this one, five months before. It was time to
a stupid, hot-headed git,” Draco told the other wizard, “and yes, asking would have been the good-mannered thing to do… but they’re your baby too, Harry. Every bit as much as mine. I think the no-touching rule only applies to ancient old aunts, and interfering Diagon strangers.” He quirked a half-smile in Harry’s direction. “I don’t think it applies to the co-parent, as you called yourself a minute ago.”
Other Harry turns back to the pan and adds the bay leaf, a shot of port and a dash of Worcestershire sauce. Harry still has no idea what dinner he's making, but he inhales deeply, letting the fragrant scent calm him.
Either way, he moves carefully and quietly under the Cloak, pulling his shoes from where he’s stuffed them in the sides of the chair and sliding his feet into them. He sits back on his armchair, knees pulled to the chest, chin propped on them, and he watches. It’s impossible not to, at this stage.
“It’ll be alright,” Draco said, dismissing Harry’s worries. “I haven’t been with anyone since Cormac.” He grimaced at the memory. “We both got tested for STDs – Muggle and magic – so you won’t catch anything, if that’s what you’re panicking about.” Draco sat up a little, all of a sudden feeling a little self-conscious about his nakedness.
Draco looked inside the bags while Harry toed off his trainers. There was a box of six croissants inside, as well as a bunch of bananas, several shiny green apples and even a box of Chocolate Frogs. “The whole team isn't waiting in the kitchen,” Draco replied, knowing that he sounded a little brusque. “What’s all this? Your weekly shop?”
They eat delicious over priced toast and go back to Harry's with another box of kouign amann, this time filled with lemon curd. Harry starts making the tea.
Harry thinks he's dealt with all the surprises of the day when he hears the beating of wings and looks up to see Hagrid in the sky, shakily riding a broom twice as large as normal and surrounded by twenty more Thestrals. The Thestrals land lightly on the edge of the forest and Hagrid follows a moment later, shaking the ground with his descent.
Malfoy looks at Harry for a long moment. "I know the Babcock family. From the war. I didn't hurt them directly but I did nothing to stop the people who did."
The pair of them lived in a flat above a wand shop, over in the Hadrian’s Gate area. It wasn’t far away from Knockturn, but the Ministry had been working hard to make the area more upscale since the end of the war. Greg didn’t officially live with Millie: she was too good a pure-blood for that and her Mummy and Daddy would have been appalled. She just slept there overnight, every night, and kept most of her belongings there.
The gate actually opens for him this time and it's just Harry's luck that when he's ready for them, the peacocks are nowhere to be seen. It's a little eerie walking up the long drive; without all the commotion the gnarled and blackened branches of the former plants lining the drive are much more menacing.
"Come off it, Malfoy. It's always been about showing off. Always a little performance to get what you want. And what you want now is to be back in everyone's good graces."
Draco didn’t think that he’d sleep much after that kiss – Merlin, he didn’t believe that he’d ever sleep again – but to his surprise he fell asleep, the second his head hit the pillow. No more awful dreams came to haunt him, and he woke up feeling better than he had in days.
The shop is huge, with magical flowers crowding every surface. Despite Hogwarts having three greenhouses, Harry hasn't seen all that many magical flowers. The plants Professor Sprout kept were for their magical properties and use in spells and potions, not chosen for their decorative blooms. But here there are buckets and buckets of snapping snapdragons, and tinkling snowdrops, and pansies that slowly change color, and bright orange flame flowers that are warm to the touch and undulate like fire. Harry stands next to the daffodils feeling a little overwhelmed and then one of the daffodils sneezes glittery pollen all over his face.
. Those had been Harry's words in Café Quendryth, but they were true for him too. He looked away with a defiant resolve. He couldn’t look at Harry’s face, for he knew if he did, the words would spill from his mouth. He’d ask Harry to stay.
A charm set Draco’s hair straight, and he gave himself a practice-smile in the mirror. Good Godric, but he looked dreadful. Truly appalling. There were a couple of spots on his chin - a result, no doubt, of his unhealthy cravings – and his skin was pasty and wan. One look at him, and Harry would be withdrawing his offer of involvement, and backing slowly out of the door. There wasn’t anything he could do about that now.
Luckily, he is back upstairs when the Floo flares to life with a loud whoosh. Harry goes back to the bedroom as quickly as he can without making a sound and wraps the Cloak back around himself. After he does so safely, he focuses on the voices.
“You’re beautiful,” Harry told him again, and the words made Draco want to have the same reaction as the last time, made him want to hide his face in Harry’s neck so he didn’t have to look at him. He didn’t though. Instead, Draco leant down to kiss Harry, slow and reverently. He wanted to match the way that Harry was looking at him.
"Of course you do," Hermione says, using her exasperated voice. "Would you say I don't know anything about being Black?"
Draco did, glad that Arthur hadn’t told him simply to put his feet up. He took two mugs from the shelf. One was purple, with the image of a cat on it, the second chipped, with the outline of Buckingham Palace against a night sky. It was an odd thing to find in a wizarding household, but Harry had told him how much the older Weasley loved everything Muggle. He added teabags and listened to the bubble of the water.
Harry gets to his feet and follows after Malfoy, weighing Death Eater raids versus facing off against Malfoy's peacocks and coming up unsure which is worse.
He gathers the drips of chocolate glaze from the plate on his finger and licks it clean, humming happily.
Probably the worst part, in Draco’s opinion, was a column that had been penned by Cormac McLaggen, claiming that Draco 'had been cold and unfeeling' during the course of the short relationship, and that Quidditch had been his whole focus. 'Certainly not children,' came the dismissive final comment. 'Draco never showed even the slightest interest in having a family.'
Malfoy pulls down a bright purple cookbook from the shelf and flips around a little looking for the right page. Harry leans over and reads aloud, "Chocolate Buckwheat Biscuits? Buckwheat?"
And that was that. Harry stood up, he straightened his clothes, and he pressed a single kiss into Draco’s tousled hair.
Harry complains that his feet hurt, that his bank account is suffering, that Malfoy won't stop pulling on his arm, but he loves his bedroom. The walls are a creamy white and the bed curtains are a gauzy golden color, the quilt from Ms. Quincy is white with lillies blushing pale pink and gold in shifting patterns. What's left of the room that isn't covered by the big white carved bed frame is covered with Harry's bright rug. Harry's never had a room of his own before, and he loves this one.
Harry doesn't know what to say to that. He doesn't like being told what to do. "Look, I can kiss who I please even if they're horrible."
“Bloody hell, Goyle,” Draco spat out, choosing the easier path of feigning infuriation rather than examining why he was as upset as he was. “If I’d have wanted this conversation, I’d have Flooed to the sodding Manor. Mummy is a sight easier on the eye than your ugly mug.” He took a belligerent swallow of Pumpkin Juice. “There’s never been any question that Harry and I are going to get bonded, or that I’m going to take his name… That was all
For his part, Bill looks totally relaxed (and unfairly hot, as usual). His hair is loose and his robes are unbuttoned, tight jeans on underneath, and he's got his hands in his pockets. He doesn't seem at all angry, like being around the mini Death Eater who let Fenrir Greyback into Hogwarts to maul him doesn't bother him.
He wasn’t worried – tiredness was almost synonymous with wizard pregnancy – but he still wanted to mention it to Mediwitch Hayes. It hadn’t helped one Sickle that August was turning into one of the hottest in living memory, and that the streets of London were a hot, sweaty sauna.
Draco took a sip. What did he know about babies? What if his baby got cold, or hungry? How would he know? He couldn’t very well ask them. His own stupid git of a father hadn’t done much parenting and was, at that current moment, still locked up in Azkaban. Draco sighed. He knew what the rational, coherent course of action would be. He ought to drink the Pennyroyal Potion, keep his eyes on the prize and have his baby when he was older and knew better.
Sat together in a small, scruffy physio room near the Montrose Stadium, Braithwaite and Goyle listened while Draco floundered his way through an account of the previous night. “And I took two tests,” Draco finished, looking everywhere but at Braithwaite’s eyes. “And two more this morning. I think… Well, they all said positive.”
“Circe… Fuck,” Harry huffed, breaking their kiss and pulling back a little. Draco’s gaze met Harry’s own. The wizard’s green eyes were dark, blown wide with desire, and Draco felt it as he drew in a deep, uneven breath. Draco redoubled his silent prayers to all the divinities. He’d always held a burning torch for Harry, and even if this only turned out to be for the one night, Draco knew he’d have to be satisfied with that.
"Budge over," Malfoy says, knocking his hip into Harry's shoulder. Once Harry's settled Malfoy sets the tray over his lap and gets in bed beside him. Harry leans over and kisses him soundly.
As soon as Malfoy gets up from the table Yip leaps from his bed to follow. Once outside, Yip starts circling Malfoy, yipping playfully, and soon the giant cats are slinking over with the peacocks waddling not far behind. Luna bends down to coo at all the animals, letting the cats lick her hand and even patting the peacocks on their heads so Harry feels a repelling spell might be in poor taste at the moment.
“They look yummy,” Draco commented, burying his head in the crook of Harry’s neck and kissing the warm skin there. “I do so adore pancakes. You’re terribly domesticated, Harry. That’s the reason I’ve moved in with you. Your cooking skills. Your cooking skills, the sex, and
Harry pushed in with three fingers then, slick fingers searching, probing, looking for the right angle, and he didn’t stop until Draco was a mess; his skin shivering, neck arched and his toes curled against the mattress.
“Circe,” Molly interjected, standing up and vanishing the newspaper with a swipe of her wand and a nonverbal spell. “There’s a reason that we don’t get that foul rag delivered. Pay it no mind, either of you! Any wix with a pair of eyes in their head can see that they pair of you will make wonderful parents, and any fool that thinks otherwise isn’t worth even a moment of your time. The people who care about you will know that the
"And the thing is," Harry says, on a roll now, "That hurt doesn't go away just because he's nice now. And a really good kisser. He's right that apologies and even changing and whatever else a person can do to be better, it doesn't actually take the hurt away."
"Er, no, thanks." Harry doesn't add that Malfoy has probably found a great many things already. "I'll, er, just take a look around."
It was, after all, a remarkably beautiful day outside in London, and Draco was bored of staring at the same four walls. Plus, he was peckish. A poor night’s sleep – caused by his growing belly and aching hips, and Goyle’s stupid kindly caution – had left him nauseous and irritated, and the only thing he’d been able to stomach was a banana.
“I want this this properly,” Draco said, letting his hands run down Draco’s sides. “Want you. A house isn’t a home until you’ve christened it, Harry.”
"No, it's fine," Malfoy says. He still looks extremely tired despite sleeping all afternoon so Harry wonders if he heard him correctly.
. They’d been the latest of Harry’s passions to take root in Draco’s life. Harry had described them as classic, although they sounded nothing like the wizarding opera that his parents had taken him to as a child.
He and the little one would be a family of two, and families needed houses. Draco supposed he could always move back to the Manor, but that idea didn’t appeal either. Their baby didn't deserve to grow up in such an austere environment. Decisions would have to be made, and sooner rather than later.
. Gasping as the pain came once again, Draco sank down onto the carpet, his whole-body trembling as the sensation intensified. It moved to his lower back, clamping down on the muscles there, making him sway; making his thoughts splinter.
Other Harry is pliant under Draco’s ministrations, and Harry struggles not to loudly let the air in his lungs go all at once when Draco flips him around in bed so he’s on his stomach, still sat above him, thighs over Other Harry’s own.
“Don’t worry, I’ve brought chocolate syrup,” Harry answered, plating up Draco’s breakfast and casting a Stasis on it. “And the posh lemon curd too. Adrianne informed me multiple times about how grumpy you get whenever your breakfast isn’t spot-on.” He nodded to the fridge. “Pumpkin juice is in there,” he said, “and glasses are in the cupboard. You pour the drinks while I finish making the pancakes.”
“Make me,” he murmured, “make me stop, Draco Malfoy, make me stop praising every inch of that gorgeous body of yours. Make me stop if you don’t want to hear me wax lyrical about those sexy lips of yours wrapped around my cock while you’re on your knees for me with your wrists tied to your ankles. Make me stop if you don’t want me to go into raptures about rimming your hole and milking your prostate. Make me stop if you don’t want to know how much I get off on fucking that tight little arse of yours while you beg me to hold you down and make your mine.”
“Harry is an all or nothing sort of guy when it comes to scenes. Bit of a perfectionist, if you ask me. I think Caleb and I rubbed off on him in that regard.”
Harry instinctively knew that Draco had a plan, that he was a man on a mission. Whenever Draco exhibited that type of behaviour, no matter what presently preoccupied him, whether it was work or personal issues, Harry usually caved and let his curiosity get the better of him. It had always been like this, even back at Hogwarts, when they’d, for all intents and purposes, been rivals, forced into their roles by circumstances far beyond their control.
On its own, each crack wasn’t all that impressive, but put together into an arrangement, like the one, Charlie was currently showing off, they looked genuinely magnificent.
Harry, who was right behind him, laughed and pinning him with an icy glower, Draco escaped onto the soft green grass and flexed his toes. The grass was still slightly damp, but Draco didn’t care. He wriggled his toes some more and revelled in the feeling of nature beneath his feet. Harry merely shook his head but said nothing. Instead, he followed him around the house and into the back garden.
For a while, nothing but silence filled the small space between them. They’d finished their lunch quite some time ago, and a waitress had stopped by to clear their table. It was after she’d left that Potter had non-verbally, and without the use of his wand, cast a silencing charm that surrounded their table and the immediate area around it. None of the café’s other patrons could listen in on their conversation but seemingly hadn’t even noticed that anything had changed.
Caleb regarded him for a moment, piercing him with his bright blue eyes, and the intensity of his gaze left Harry feeling like he’d just been stripped naked. It was like Caleb was staring directly into his soul, reading between the lines, but Harry let it happen, welcomed it even ― it was beautiful to be seen, even if he felt vulnerable and exposed.
For a moment, Draco was tempted to push Potter, force him into shifting, but he didn’t actively pursue the idea.
Draco’s crystal-clear silvery-grey eyes slowly filled with unshed tears. He shut and opened his eyes quickly to try and stop the drops of salty liquid, currently irritating his eyes, from falling and rolling down his cheeks.
So, instead, he remained passive, and once Harry had left the kitchen, Draco glanced at Harry’s plate and let out that sigh, he’d been holding back. His heart gave a painful lurch, and a sharp piercing pain briefly stopped him from inhaling an adequate amount of air.
Harry gripped his wrists, squeezed them tightly and dragged them behind his back, were he crossed them at the wrists, effectively restraining him. He held them there with one hand, then Draco felt him grip his chin. Harry squeezed it just tight enough for it to feel a little bit uncomfortable but was nowhere near rough enough for Draco to even entertain the thought of asking Harry to stop.
He finishes the books in record time, then heads into the back of the shop. Rose and Hugo are both asleep inside the playroom, and he indecisively stands in the door for a solid five minutes before he finally makes the decision to pick them up and carry them upstairs.
His decision resulted in Harry snickering under his breath but ignoring him entirely, Draco simply proceeded. He replaced the tufted black leather daybed with a much smoother and more modern leather bench, opted for ridged industrial nightstands and some beautiful tonal white art―depicting an abstract mix of thick and thin lines on an off-white canvas―above the bed. He left the large area rug but changed its colour to black to ground the space. With a confident swoosh of his wand, Draco replaced the streamlined blue velvet lounge chair with a much broader lounge sofa. It offered enough room for both him and Harry to snuggle up to each other for some quality time spent out of bed but still in the privacy and comfort of their own bedroom. He also procured a few gauze-textured grey-and-black square pillows and a cream-coloured double-cloth blanket to decorate the lounging space.
Harry smacked his arse cheek hard, and the sting brought him back from the edge, but he was too desperate and too turned on for the relief to last longer than a minute or two.
Harry’s warm smile sent a shiver of excitement down his spine and feeling his cheeks heat a little, he took a deep breath in an attempt to try and calm himself.
Harry words pulled Draco out of his thoughts, and he looked straight at Harry, surprised to find him smiling. It only took a few seconds for reality to sink in, and Draco furrowed his brows even further, although realistically he wasn’t sure whether that was even possible. It felt like half of his forehead had already disappeared past his hairline.
“For those who believe in it, it’s supposedly able to help a person who might struggle with opening up their heart.”
Teddy had been the only one to refuse to tag along with everyone else, and after a long conversation with Harry, he’d confessed that he wanted to spend time with him and Draco at the Burrow instead of eating ice-cream and playing games. Unable to refuse Teddy’s request, for it had come with a pout that melted Harry’s heart, he’d declared his godson his right-hand-man and Teddy had positively blossomed after being allowed to stay back and help with the final preparations for the party.
He’d proven his worth and was now a vital member of the Wizengamot’s newly founded Potions Committee. Along with six other members, he oversaw the radical overhaul of all kinds of potions, elixirs, draughts, and tinctures, most of which were terribly out of date and in desperate need of an update. Granted, he did most of the actual work, which included hours of research, experiments, and liaising with Potions Experts from all over the world, but he finally had the support he needed ― at least officially and on paper. As for the funds…well, that was an entirely different matter.
Initially, Potter had wanted to jump in and chase after it without giving much thought or concern to the repercussions, but Draco had stopped him, although it hadn’t exactly been easy. Something about receiving the answer to all their headache-causing questions on a silver platter had made Draco instantly wary of the lead’s authenticity. It had taken an entire afternoon and a very loud debate―‘
“Make me, Draco, make me stop. Tell me you don’t want this; tell me you don’t want me to claim what’s mine.”
Harry let a series of blows rain all over Draco’s back, arse, and thighs. Each blow peeled more of the wax off Draco’s skin and send it flying into all four directions.
There were times when Harry couldn’t help but wonder whether his and Draco’s love-making would always remain this intense, but it was always only a fleeting thought that dissipated almost as quickly as it popped into Harry’s head. He didn’t chase after it but remained firmly rooted in the here and now. Draco continued to writhe beneath him. He arched into his every thrust and worked together with him. It was the perfect push and pull. They propelled each other forward with a wordless understanding of each other’s needs and desires, and even though they were both breathless and struggled to get enough air into their lungs, they couldn’t stop kissing each other.
Instead, he played it cool and merely giving the note a cursory glance, he remained entirely nonchalant about it. On the outside, anyway. On the inside, his mind was occupied with trying to work out just what Potter was playing at, but despite fixing Potter with a piercing stare, Potter’s poker face gave away absolutely nothing. Somehow, he simultaneously managed to look like a man who had nothing to hide and a man who had everything to hide. It was vexing, and Draco was on the verge of losing his cool.
. It was a term of endearment Harry generally only used when they indulged in a bit of pet play, which happened once in a blue moon.
Wave after wave of intense excitement ripple through him zapped down his spine and pooled low in his groin before Harry had the chance to consciously register how twisted his reaction to Draco’s words was.
Unable to control his annoyance, Draco had thrown a plethora of colourful expletives at Harry, who’d laughed until he’d nearly fallen off his broom. Threatening to hex him, Draco had drawn his wand and promised murder. In response to that, Harry had dared him to chase him with a series of stinging hexes and much to Draco’s lingering exasperation, he’d out-flown every single curse.
Snorting, he laughed out loud, then thrust his hand out to wandlessly block the Stinging Hex, Potter had cast non-verbally.
Draco twisted and writhed beneath him, yanked at his restraints, and Harry felt him curl his toes. His entire body was flushed and covered with a beautiful, fine sheen of sweat. It was also peppered with red blotches, reminders of Harry’s bites, which he revisited with sweet, lingering kisses designed to drive Draco barking mad.
Humming, Draco crouched down and picked up the stick Kona had placed on the ground in front of his feet. He toyed with it for several seconds, looking at it from several different angles, but Kona got impatient quickly and demanded it back with a loud bark. She also prodded him with her wet black snout.
Upon walking into the shop, Draco felt Harry’s hand slip into his own and giving it a slight squeeze, he turned his head and smiled at Harry, who gave him a cheeky wink. They hadn’t managed to get especially far when a middle-aged shop assistant, dressed in navy slacks, a white button-up shirt but no tie, and a form-shaping navy waistcoat approached them. Her nametag told Draco that her name was Brenda.
What with his and Draco’s roleplay, his drop forcing him to take a few days off work, and his and Draco’s very recent engagement, he hadn’t seen Caleb or had had the time to speak to him. When Caleb had gotten in touch to ask whether he and Draco were free to join him and Stefan at the club, they’d exchanged a few messages, but Caleb wasn’t the kind of person who had important conversations over text. He was old-school, had always been, and preferred face to face; a trade Harry both admired and valued.
Caleb, thoroughly amused by his clear annoyance, merely sipped on his water and patted him on the shoulder.
Harry rolls his eyes at her―mostly because she always asks him that, as if he’s never minded the kids before―and when she realises it, she chuckles, then shrugs.
In a way, it gave him peace of mind and anchored him, and although he hoped Harry would return soon, he was prepared to remain in this very position until Harry told him otherwise.
His rumbling stomach temporarily distracted him from making any further plans, and cancelling the silencing charm on the door, Harry left his and Draco’s en-suite bathroom and quietly padded over to the walk-in wardrobe, suppressing the urge to chuckle underneath his breath.
“Harry’s not broken. He still loves you a lot, he’s just a little bit lost at the moment, and he needs an overdose of love. Force it on him if you have to. Tell him you love him a million times a day. Make him listen. Talk about the scene, make him tell you what’s weighing on his mind. Take a few days just for the two of you, no distractions and no work commitments. Connect with him, get under his skin, let him now absolutely nothing’s changed between you. I promise you; the fog is going to disappear, and he’ll come right out of his funk. He’ll be back to his old self in no time.”
, and he trusted Harry to cease dominating him when and if he used his safeword. Knowing he held that sort of power intoxicated Draco and feeling a bit heady, he inhaled deeply.
He began to gently sway them both back and forth, and when, after a few minutes, Teddy hugged them both, Harry neither pulled away nor felt embarrassed about the fact that he was affectionate with his boyfriend in front of his godson. Instead, Harry placed his hand between Teddy’s shoulder blade and included him in the dance. A moment later, Draco moved his hand to meet his and their laced their fingers together then continued dancing.
Crawling up, Harry covered Draco’s body with his own and smiled down at him. He reached up to check on the ropes and captured Draco’s lips in a passionate kiss at the same time. Satisfied that the sensitive nerves that ran through Draco’s wrists remained unharmed, he deepened the kiss, wound his tongue around Draco’s and snogged him until he’d managed to empty Draco’s lungs. It was only then that he pulled away, locked eyes with Draco and licked his lips.
“And do you know what makes that fantasy even better, my love? The fact that we both also know that you’ll love every smack of it and I’ll have you begging for more before I’m even halfway done with your punishment.”
“No, my little prince. Feel free to keep begging for it though, I love hearing you beg your precious little heart out.”
“Let’s test that theory then, Malfoy. Crawl over to that bed over there and kneel on it, spread your legs nice and wide for me.”
“You’re most welcome, Prosecutor Malfoy,” he said but sent an icy death glare into the general direction of Warrenforth’s defence barrister.
A wretched sob forced its way past his lips, and his entire body shook from the impact of each blow. His arse felt like it was burning up and Draco buried his head in the mattress and sobbed quietly, then screamed.
Harry brought his other hand up and cupped Draco’s cheek. He traced Draco’s lips, still moist from their last kiss, with his thumb, then pressed its tip against Draco’s bottom lip, and dragged it down.
Anything to be normal again, or―considering that it had been him who’d defeated Voldemort―as close to normal as he could ever hope to be.
Draco paused for a short moment and as he fell silent, a wave of applause, led by Harry, who’d stood up and raised his hands above his head to clap, surprised him. He took a tiny step backwards and smiling, Draco patiently waited for his audience to settle down again.
This time, he managed to give his voice the desired undertone; firm and assertive. It was most definitely a warning, and for a moment, Draco paused and held his gaze, then he smiled around the lollipop.
“Because I want you to be healthy. I want you to sleep well, eat well, and get enough fresh air. Family is important to you, and your mother even though she’s probably going to grumble about you springing this on her, she’ll secretly love it, and she’ll find little ways to show you. It’ll make you happy, and I want that more than anything. I want you happy, full of life, and healthy. You know I care about you and those things are more important to me than you dropping everything you’re doing just to kneel at my feet. Take these two weeks to take care of yourself and know that you’re doing it to please me. Afterwards, we can still talk about me occasionally being a bit firmer with you and making more demands.”
Draco slowly put his coffee mug down and accepted the sweet treat, but still didn’t eat it, which was highly unusual.
Draco ears perked up at the professors response, " No. I understand that we all are in a great debt to you for your services, but you cannot go around excusing your self from things that inconvenience you. Work is work, and I expect
His shoes crunched on the cooled grass as a crisp breeze hit his sweaty face, gently ruffling his hair as it blew. He walked over to a bench that was on the far side of the yard.
"Oh my, what happened!" Pomfrey's aged voice squeaked ask she started walking over to get her wand from another table. As she passed, the mystery student was revealed.
"Why don't birds in cages sing?" The ginger's British accent poorly articulated the sentence, allowing for most of the words to slur together in a lousy way.
" Well, cause, it's- a ha ha." Potter let out little huffs of nervous laughter as he started searching for words.
The rest of the day went as good as to be expected. Draco wasn't late to anymore classes which ended the cycle of punishments he'd been receiving (seeing an angered expression on his Alchemy Professor's face when Draco arrived on time only supported his suspicion about the whole ordeal being planned) allowed Draco's day to carry on without too much disturbance.
Perhaps he was quite strict, but Draco just didn't see him as a " New Snape". Naturally the lack of connection played a big part in this, but Professor Colin didn't even look like Snape!
Her eyes dilated as she shifted her head and gazed at her son, her eyes seemed to pierce right through him. Her silence was all the answer Draco needed. He still remembered that day as if it were yesterday.
Draco's eyes traveled down to the familiar glasses that encaged Potter's forest green eyes. Draco fixed his gaze on Potter's eye as he laughed with Weasley and Granger. The gems practically glowed, they were brighter than the greenest grass. Then abruptly, the jade orbs met polar spheres and all went silent.
Ronald shuffled in the bushes he was hiding in, his gun barrel pointed directly at the Draco-deer. The hunter sniffed before letting a slight cough slip, the deer's leg twitch as it's big eyes glanced at the shrubbery. Its innocent face in a questioning glance before looking back down at its hooves. The hunter, as carefully as he could, placed his finger around the trigger and pulled. The bullet traveled at ridiculously high speeds, but at that moment it felt a hundred years slow. The tiny piece of metal came close to the creature's delicate structure before penetrating the skin.
" Carie! I-I was only touching the v-vase! A-and it broke!" The girl whimpered underneath Draco's touch. The taller girl, Carie, knelt down beside Draco a swatted his hand away from Maria. Draco obeyed as he had already took most of the shards out and started a charm to help clear the blood around the cut and and infectious substances that could have been contracted.
"Right, well. I suppose we can continue with our planned lesson. Are there any volunteers for today? Or do I have to pick some of you?"
A muffled voice distressed from Draco's right, his ear popped as he strained to listen before turning to find who spoke out. Luna Lovegood was sitting a handful of meters away from Draco. Sitting was a pleasant term for someone whose legs was cruelly being tugged into the water by a Grindylow, it's slippery tentacle was tightly wrapped around her leg soaking her stockings with the water on its appendage.
Draco took his seat (the one closest to the door) at the Slytherin's table in the Great Hall. No one sat with him, not even his friends that returned for another year. Naturally, it hurt Draco's feelings until he realized it was better for them to stay away from him. With a sigh, Draco studied the plates of food laid in front of him. As much as he wanted to chow down on the delicious collection of foods that were displayed out on the table in front of him, his mind was elsewhere.
" Well look at who it is, boys. It's the overly incompetent Draco Malfoy." Tony spoke quickly, as if he were spitting the words at Draco. The tone made his vowels sharp and pointed as if Tony thought the words were going to strike Draco dead if he spoke violent enough. " Came back for more, did you?" Draco questioned with a smirk that pulled at the corners of his mouth. Tony's face dropped as his gazes hardened.
Rumors have been drifting through the air, he knew. Not only from Luna telling him but because he has heard them. Not the ones about him, but many about Harry.
Draco pauses to catch his breath as the cruel words repeated in his head over and over again, like a broken record repeating a verse. The heat that surrounded his head became stuffy, and an imaginary force pressed pressure into his chest with each breath he took. Deciding quickly that he needed to be outside, The blonde took off.
Narcissa merely shifted her head to the side before it moved back, her eyes never leaving the flame. Draco let gravity pull his head down to gaze at his dish. He poked the cooked meat that he hadn't touched. The delicate leaves of parsley rested on top of the roasted steak while the potatoes bathed in a thin layer gravy. The remaining portions of his plate were filled with an assortment of vegetables that all smelled heavily seasoned, but not unappetizing.
Draco stayed silent the entire time, letting Harry explain as he focused on the intimidating cabinet.
Draco's nose pinched upwards as a snarl appeared on his mouth. Slowly, he made his way out of bed to get dressed. His bare feet hit the cold stone floor as he padded towards his trunk that sat at the bottom of the bed; top already open and contents inside; moved around. Draco carefully extracted a clean set of uniform clothes, being mindful of the breakable picture frame the rested on top of his dress shirt. The picture was of his family; Lucius and Narcissa were standing behind Draco (who was sat on a chair) close enough together to appear like a family but far enough so they weren't touching. The photo send chills down the spine of any person who knew what a really family looked like.
" Ah, well. Does-does it matter? I was only, WE-we were only talking. It, it doesn't really- I mean why can't we be able to...?"
"Yeah? And just what are you doing wandering around bumping into people?" Harry awkwardly extended a hand, only for it to go ignored. Draco pushed himself off the ground and wiped his hands on his shirt a few times.
Draco's fingers pulled the flakes from the roll as he grimaced, remembering Potter's conversation with professor Surly. If the savior couldn't get a pass on the assignment, then he certainly wouldn't get one. After all, he was a Death Eater. Why on Earth would the professor grace him with something as generous as that?
" I saw how Tony was treating you back there, I'm sorry I didn’t do anything. I should have." An unknown wave of anger washed of Draco.
Draco grasped the bottle and sniffed. It smelled like absolute shit. Draco plugged his nose and threw his head back, chugged it in one go.
If you could comment your favorite little segment so far that you would love to be the summary for the book, that would be great!
" He already did today, it's just he kept rambling on and on that I got lost and now I have no idea what his entire lecture was about." Draco turned his hands in a circle around each other to demonstrate and exaggerated his case. " Yeah, I get that. I'm not sure any one really got what he was going on, but I just wanted to say that if Tony- or anyone else for that matter, tries to hurt you again. You can tell me, I'm here for you." Harry's hand ghosted over Draco's shoulder as the Golden Boy flash his trademark smile and turned to leave.
" Before you get all Potter-y, I wasn't the cause. This girl cut her hand this morning and I heard, so I came to her side and she kinda grabbed my hair with her damaged hand and-"
Once Draco had felt he had given enough time for Harry to...erm...conceal himself, Draco had turned toward said man. " When did you wake up for, all this?" Harry shrugged as he ran a hand through his damp hair and shook probably hoping to shake out some of the moisture.
"Staring is considered rude to many people, Draco." Luna's soft voice carried his head over to her. Silvery blue eyes held onto Draco's as he processed her words.
He made a bee line for his room in the Slytherin's dormitory after hearing another pair of footsteps behind his own. Draco started to pick up his pace as he swung around corners and sped through the halls, the mysterious follower close on his trail. On a very sharp turn, Draco turned his head to catch a glimpse of his stalker.
His attention was ripped from his hand and toward the door that led into the dining room from the west hall. Two house-elves entered with Narcissa trailing behind them. They carried two divine looking dishes on big silver platters; one held two complex glasses while the other held a regal jug filled with blood-red wine. The fresh-looking red stain on the elves 'shirt' confirmed that.
“Don't shush me-” A hand slapped over his mouth in the dark as footsteps echoed in the corridor outside. They’d chosen quite the hiding place this time, a broom cupboard for that matter. They held their breath, not daring to let that even reach Filch's ears.
No, that was ridiculous. They’d been through a lot together so far, it would only be foolish of him to think that. Yet...he couldn’t shake it. If he wasn’t ashamed, why did they have to stay hidden? Of course the logical answer was the fact that his parents would not take it well, and Harry wasn’t quite so sure about his friends either. It was safer this way, he knew it was. But sometimes he just wanted to hold his hand, and sit near him in class, and lounge under the tree watching the giant squid torment other students. It was hard.
“Well you sure asked me several times the other day so that ought to make up for things.” Draco went as scarlet as his pale face could possibly get, and Harry felt satisfied knowing he still had a little bit of power over the taller one. He’d just opened his mouth to retaliate when the bell rang, signalling class was starting. “Gotta go, I’ll see you in Potions.” He pressed a kiss to Draco’s lips before grinning. “Oops, didn’t mean to attack you.” And then he took off towards his first class of the day.
Thanks for reading, stay tuned for the next chapter! Without giving too much away I will say we are getting into the big plot parts soon me thinks. Thanks for reading, stay healthy and safe <3
Hermione wasn’t in the common room so he headed out to meet her in the dining hall. However as he made his way down the deserted staircases, someone grabbed his hand and pulled him into an empty hallway.
“It’s fine, Dray. It’s nothing I can’t handle.” But he averted his eyes, knowing if he met the smoldering grey ones across from him then Draco would immediately know he was lying. There was a moment of silence between them, before Draco spoke again.
“You’re not causing me pain.” He’d answered too quickly because the other boy scoffed. “It’s true! Draco, do you remember in third year when we met up in Hogsmeade?” A nod, so Harry continued, his voice slightly muffled from Draco’s shirt. “The first time I told you I thought I was falling for you. You got so scared you avoided me for weeks, not even meeting my eyes. I couldn’t tell what was going on in your head, and I was scared. Then after Lupin’s class one day, you dragged me out toward the lake before Hermione or Ron could notice.” Draco leaned back, staring down at him as Harry lifted his head. “Then you hugged me, for the first time in weeks and you said-”
He watched as the potion dripped onto his hand, expecting to feel a sting or some sort of pain from the reed substance, but nothing came. It tingled slightly, and his hand stopped throbbing, as the wounds started to close themselves up. They didn't disappear entirely, but they stopped bleeding.
“Does it hurt?” He asked quietly, gingerly grabbing Harry’s hand, bringing it closer to his face to examine it. The wound was still throbbing painfully, but he shook his head. “Dont lie, Potter, you’re no good at it.” Draco snapped but he still had the worried expression on his face.
“I’ve had worse.” They locked eyes and Draco knew exactly what he meant. Last year, when the Triwizard Tournament ended and Cedric Diggory was killed...Draco stayed with Harry every chance he got. But that first night, after everything, Harry had curled up inside an empty classroom corner, hiding from everything. Draco had found him there, and held him for what felt like hours until he calmed down enough to speak.
“I’m only going to say this once, I think I’m falling in love with you too.” Draco smiled the memory coming back to him as well.
hey everyone sorry this took so long!! I started a new anime and had to finish it in a week...sorry <3
“Yeah, sorry. I was thinking about the first time Filch almost caught us.” Draco smiled with him, though his smile was more mischievous.
“The point is, Dray, I’m never going to rush you. If this is all you’re comfortable with then that's okay. I’m not going to force you to make yourself uncomfortable just to make me happy. As long as we’re together, I’ll be happy forever.”
OKAY I KNOW I SAID I WOULD GET MORE INTO THE PLOT BUT I WANTED TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE OF SOFT BABIES BECAUSE IM WEAK. I hope you're all enjoying so far <3
He closed his eyes, exhaustion after his talk with Draco, coursing through his veins. But as Ron’s snores filled the dorm room, Harry thought about Draco’s lips ghosting down his neck, the softest touch and his tinkling laughter when Harry had cussed him out.
okay we're starting to get into it now, sorry its taking so long to get to the main plot but I wanna develop their characters a bit. Thanks for reading so far everyone, I appreciate it! <3
“Harry? That you?” Harry’s best friend of five years, Ron Weasley, sat up in bed. He rubbed his eyes as he squinted into the darkness. “What are you doing out of bed?”
“I know.” He dropped his eyes, a dark look momentarily crossing his face. “Do I deserve that though?” Harry tilted his head quizzically, pulling Draco as close as he could, from his seated position. His head level with the taller one's chest, he could hear Draco’s heart beating rapidly. He wasn’t entirely sure it was from their close proximity, and not the anxiety rolling off of the blonde boy in waves.
Harry was almost out of breath as he stumbled into bed.He’d run into Ron on the way and found he’d been practicing for the quidditch tryouts the next day. He’d mistakenly shown Ron his injured hand, still scarred but not bleeding thanks to Draco’s potion. Ron had called Umbridge and old Hag and told Harry to go to Dumbledore, but he couldn’t. They’d argued for a little while about it until the Fat Lady had yelled at them to get inside.
“I’ll admit, sometimes I think it would be nice to hold your hand and walk to class, or sit together under the tree overlooking the lake. But we have these special moments instead,” Harry reached down to bring Draco’s hand and press it against his cheek. “And these moments, make those thoughts disappear.”
“Oh ignore him, Harry.” Hermione glared at the slytherins, the laughter growing and Harry felt an odd churning in his stomach. Was it guilt? What would he be guilty for. “You know he’s not worth it.” He nodded as Ron finally took up the empty seat beside him. He greeted them sleepily, hiding a yawn with his hand. They talked casually for a moment and then Harry, who had finished his breakfast, stood up.
Oh yeah, Harry definitely hated her more than he hated Snape. And he didn't think that was even possible! His hand stung as he made his way through the empty corridor. Some of the anger he had been feeling during the summer coming back to him. If only Dumbledore was speaking to him, when the whole world was against him he thought that Dumbledore would always have his back. Surely he must know what is happening in his school!
Harry tried to fight the smile as much as he could on his way into the dining hall. Maybe his day wasn’t going to be so bad after all.
“This is ridiculous.” He muttered, pulling out his wand and whispering Lumos. The light illuminated the cramped space, and his boyfriend’s slightly annoyed but exhilarated, face. His eyes met the stormy grey ones across from him, and he felt a blush tinge his cheeks. A hand slowly curled around his tie as the grey eyed boy grew a mischievous grin.
“Do you need to scare me every day? Is that a goal of yours?” He grumbled bitterly and Draco laughed.
“You already know I’d trust you with my life.” He blushed slightly, not meeting his boyfriends piercing gaze. It felt odd to say the words out loud and he wondered for a second if he was being rash. They’d only been dating two years, was there a certain time frame for these sorts of words? He’d have to ask Hermione about it later. Harry’s brain was about to pull him into a spiral of doubt when Draco’s hand brushed his cheek softly.
