"Now, I will make you feel the same agony I go through when you attempt to kill yourself. I will make you understand that I love you, that I love you enough to go insane, to die, to - to leave everything for you and then you can follow me Draco. But I-" Harry whispered, his face wet with tears, his voice hoarse from shouting and his eyes mad and wild. He was a picture of madness and Draco moved towards him in concern "I am sorry, Harry. Please." He was alarmed by Harry's statement and wanted to prevent him from taking any rash decisions but it happened too fast, too fast for him to stop.
When he had confirmed that he was in fact in his house instead of that madhouse, he tried to breath normally and calm his heartbeats.
"Let's go. There's a cafe nearby." He murmurs once she has calmed down.
Harriet was suddenly turned around with two firm hands on her shoulders. She came face to face with uncle Severus.
Ron looked into Harry's eyes and whispered "Everything will be fine mate. We need to clear the way. Draco and his family deserve privacy."
"I NEEDED YOU,  NOT YOUR DAMN MONEY-"
"Harry. Harry. You won't believe this."
Warning: Non-consensual hugging
Draco's gaze flickered towards Potter and it was just so involuntary that he was exasperated with himself. What was it about being in this castle and sitting right in front of Potter. The lights flickered for a whole minute and Draco stared at the ceiling alongwith everyone else.
Harry nodded mutely and realized that Ron was already out of the room. He did not even turn towards Hermione and it was an evidence of the strong friendship he shared with them that Hermione did not even expect it from him. Merlin knew, what they were doing. They could have been out on a date or in bed or having dinner but had come immediately for Harry and Draco and she placed a small box on Harry's palm.
She leaves and takes her comforting warmth with her. He stares forlornly at her receding back, wishing that she was in his year.
"YOU HAVE NO BLOODY RIGHT TO RUIN WHAT I HAVE BUILT WITH HARD WORK, YOU ASSHOLE." Draco had never been so furious in his entire life.
Weeks had elapsed since that night and Draco had grown complicated. Harry had to walk on eggshells around him.
Malfoy opens her mouth and mutters, "He-" just when dad says in a clear and loud voice, "You will be my lead actress, Ms. Malfoy." and Malfoy shuts her mouth, her gazing desperately eyes at him.
A moment later, she is standing in front of a very panicked Hermione Granger.
He winks at her and turns around with a gentle, "By the way you have nice eyes. My son chose well."
The only mistake he did was to tell them off for harassing a couple of kids. His knee is already bleeding and his shirt is almost ruined beyond repair. His stomach is hurting from their punches. They really would have killed him if that car had not passed them by.
be joining us. She should mind
"Nothing." He said, "I'm sorry but we can't help you, mini Draco."
Green eyes flashed at him and with gritted teeth, she said, "What do you want, head auror Malfoy?"
She passed Arthur's room. It was actually a classroom turned into a bedroom. Everyone was using students' bathrooms since prefects' bathrooms were still locked and refused to open. At least, that was what she had heard. She had tried in the morning and the prefects' bath had unlocked without any issues. It had taken a simple Alohomora. What puzzled her was that how its location got changed from the fifth floor to the second floor. But, it was nice to have a place she could retreat to - one where no-one would be able to enter so she hadn't told anyone, not even Hermione.
Then, who was this man who looked like Draco except that his eyes were a bit colder and hair much longer. They were in Draco's office - at least this was supposed to be Draco's office - except that the calendar showed that that it was January 21, 2001 and this man looked like a younger version of his father. He had blonde hair that was flowing on his back and a cane and the walls had family photographs and his mother was in those photographs and so was Draco's younger self.
"I love you so much and I should be able to make love to you. It has been more than a decade. I should be able to move on Harry. I am so sorry." Draco whispered, still pulling his hair in frustration.
"Where is the letter?" Harry asked "Did you burn it?"
"Yes." He replies.
He would never forget this. He slipped. Anything could have happened. Draco had healed a lot that is why he pushed Harry away.
"I am meeting them tomorrow. Discussion over." Draco said curtly, though his insides felt warm when Harry snapped at him "I am telling you. If they hurt you in any way. If they even look at you wrong, I would do worst then burning them."
He almost jumped in surprise when he noticed that Harry was staring at him with his piercing Green eyes.
Potter shakes her head, replying quietly, "No. I will intimate him before leaving."
But today it doesn't happen. Potter doesn't answer. He doesn't blink. He doesn't even move. His green eyes gaze silently at Draco.
But Harry doesn't answer Snape. He only looks at Sirius. Remus walks behind Sirius and looks at Harry with determined eyes, "All right. But we'll need help to do this."
A weird sounding giggle escapes his mouth and the mischievous little menace starts laughing again.
"But Ron, believe me-" Harry spoke and they were standing now. Ron's and Hermione's wands were out and were pointed at them. Harry and he did not need wands. They were trained in wandless magic.
"I had vowed not to trust anyone. I had promised myself not to consider anyone my family. This was the major reason that I did not consider Ron and Hermione my family. They were my best friends. You are the only family I have ever had, you know." Harry spoke and Draco stared at him. His eyes were shocked. Harry had never seen Draco so shocked before. But then, he had never been so open with Draco ever before.
She moves to the side to let him in and he walks inside.
Harry was not sleeping. He was tossing and turning on his bed. He had a feeling that Draco shouldn't meet these delegates but he also knew that Draco won't listen to him at all.
"Why haven't you woken that boy yet? Harry knows what Vernon eats in the morning," she asked quietly, grimacing.
Harry knew that he won't return before that but he nodded and said "okay. Can i hug you?"
He had started thinking that Harry would leave him just because he had seen those photos.
Harry looked up to find an utterly shocked Draco Malfoy looking at him.
Draco thought, his chest heaving as if he had run miles.
He was so ashamed of himself.
"You are drunk enough for tonight." The man said in his usual lazy drawl. It was surprising to see how far they had come. Harry had met Blaise at a pub four years ago at the club he was standing in right now. Blaise was with a date. She was lean and short and very slim and a brunette with short hair. Harry was alone and was drowning himself in alcohol to avoid thinking about Draco, his husband, ex-husband, whatever. Technically, they weren't divorced but then they hadn't spoken to each other even once in the past four years.
Lucius's voice was deadpanned and everyone fell silent. Finally, Hermione spoke up after a few minutes, "Mr. Malfoy, did he say anything about Draco?"
It broke Harry's heart to see Draco crying like this. He knew that Draco abhorred looking vulnerable in front of others so he attempted to hide Draco from everyone's eyes and it worked because Draco did not apparate or run away. He listened to everything his parents said which had been the intention.
"Harry I am sorry." Draco averted his eyes and spoke softly, his fingers tracing random patterns on their bed sheet. Harry wanted to slam his head on the wall he had been staring at.
Not even fifteen minutes have passed when Harry's eyes open and he sits up on the bed. Draco watches him in concern. They still have a quarter of an hour before they need to make breakfast.
And then he does something that stuns her so much that she freezes. Whatever, she had expected, it wasn't this or maybe she had and she was fooling herself into believing something else.
She nodded slowly and backed off "Okay, Harry, as you wish." Harry had his eyes glued on Draco who was now looking everywhere around his house. Hermione left his house quietly, closing the door behind her and he did not look back.
"What?" Harry asks with narrowed eyes.
"You are right." Hermione said and they apparated, not giving any opportunity to Harry to speak.
The ever existing itch lessened and he leaned into Harry's body.
"Granger," Draco repeated but to no avail.
"Don't worry. You've taught me well." Scorpius says calmly.
He wiped his tears and stood on the chair and tied the rope around his neck and then closed his eyes before bidding adieu to Harry internally.
He cursed Granger mentally because Harry was bleeding at an alarming rate and the woman had still not arrived.
"He is nice though. He didn't scold me at all. You were right about the other thing too. He-"
Albus Dumbledore is sitting rigidly on a chair, staring at her with horror. He has joined all the dots. Of course he has. Draco doesn't remember a single instance when she saw Dumbledore so horrified. Maybe he didn't know then, after all.
"Let's go to our bedroom." He whispered and bent down to pick Draco in his lap. He took hold of his legs and Draco placed his hands on Harry's shoulders. Harry licked Draco's belly button and noticed the way Draco closed his eyes and sweat became even more profound on his cheeks.
His best friends left them to their own devices and finally they were alone. Harry jumped in surprise when Draco straddled him.
"You stopped looking at me. Even at the burrow, you won't stay in my presence. So I stopped trying. I'm sorry. I should have tried harder. It would have been easier for you that way." She says.
"You must have a theory," Malfoy said and Harriet noticed that his eyes were narrowed. Of course, he didn't buy Dumbledore's words. Dumbledore only smiled and his eyes became amused before he answered, "I do. I think that this is Hogwarts' doing. All of you must have faced certain problems with the water windows."
It was not that Draco had a problem with bottoming. Harry had given him the option of topping until but Draco had refused. He was not ready for sex. Harry had been so sweet when he had told him that their was no dominant or submissive between them. Draco had known this of course but still Harry had been very soft and gentle while explaining these things and Draco had been relieved.
"Do you ever listen to yourself? You would never be a burden on me." Draco snapped at him and Harry did not have to look up to know that he was being glared at. It would have been better if Draco had called him a burden because he had mocked Draco all those years ago and he couldn't help but be ashamed at his own words.
"Draco, one of these days, he'll catch you red-handed and you'll lose him." Says Pansy out of the blue and before Draco can snap at her, she has already gone to talk to Daphne.
The same brown eyes that had first looked softly at him and then had mocked him stared at him with panic. His hands tried to pry Draco's hands off his neck. Draco growled and tightened his hold on the neck.
Draco turned his head to look at his thirteen year old son. Scorpius was trying hard not to stare at Ariana, Potter's middle daughter. Scorpius had proposed her a few months ago. Draco had chuckled inwardly when he was told about it. He wondered if Scorpius even knew the meaning of love. Nevertheless, he had sat both of them on front of him and had given them the talk. It was quite funny to watch them turn red and stutter that they did not want to talk about this. It was his responsibility, though because Ariana couldn't tell her parents and Astoria had given up on Scorpius when he was just a year old. Both Ariana and Scorpius were good at keeping secrets.
"Harry." he murmured to voice his ideas and Harry whined "Draco. Please sleep. We will talk in the morning."
"No rush." This time it was Wealsey and Draco trembled "Take your time." Draco did not reply to that.
"I know. You need to be calm. We can stand like this for the complete night, otherwise." Harry whispered, his tongue licking the skin beneath Draco's ear. Draco shuddered and whispered "Okay. Okay. I am not going to kill them. I just- I need to tell you everything Harry."
He would leave and then Harry would be able to live in peace with someone who would not carry the emotional baggage that he did.
Harry closes his eyes and covers his head and waits for the blow.
He knocked but no one opened the door. So he simply opened it and shouted  "Harry." No one answered and he tried again "Harry."
"Have you placed the chairs and tables like I had told you?" Harry asked, looking around the room in which he had decided to train the students.
Harry wrung the bell. The man who opened the door seemed nothing like Dudley Dursley he knew and if Harry had not foreknown that this was in fact the Dursley house, he would have sworn that he had entered the wrong place. The man who stood in front of him had a strong built and warm eyes. He was not fat, no. He was handsome, in fact and looked quite intelligent.
She is so busy imagining Professor Snape's sneering face and exasperated eyes that she doesn't pay attention to anything but running and crashes into a hard body.
"I will tell everything to you tomorrow evening." Draco whined and Harry returned his attention to Draco's lips, kissing him passionately and hungrily, mumbling softly "I love you so much."
Lucius stares at the gobsmacked face of his oldest friend. As far as Lucius knows, Severus has no child. Then -
"Who are you?" Draco asked, in a low quiet tone although he knew that standing in front of him was the male version of Harriet Potter.
This decided, he apparated. He wanted to return to his own manor, he did. Unfortunately, his mind decided to apparate right in front of the Malfoy manor. He started walking towards the gate of the manor. It opened when he touched the handle. He went inside and the door closed behind him. Voldemort just could not get those scratches out of his mind.
He would never forget the fear.
Petunia nodded.
"Hahahaha, please aunt Siri. Don't." As soon as Black stops, the girl shoots up and sticks her tongue at her godmother before running off to god knows where. He is sure he will know within a few minutes or maybe an hour.
For the first time in four years, their eyes met properly and it seemed that time stopped altogether because his eyes had the same love that they had held four years back.
Narcissa mouths, "Thank you." and Harry nods politely. They leave and close the door behind them.
Kreacher loathed Sirius and over the years, the elf had come to respect Harry and Draco.
He nodded and took it in his "Yes. We will punish him and take you somewhere you would have exposure to magic. Next year you would be able to go to Hogwarts. It is a school where you learn magic."
Still there was no answer so he called again "Draco."
Hermione chuckled and sat down on her knees and Ron rolled his eyes. Harry smiled on Harry's shoulders and Draco continued his rant, "You don't even own proper robes now and your shirts are old. Honestly, Harry..."
He closes his eyes and breathes deeply. It's been years since he felt something akin to this for anyone.
Harry pulls his hands back and backs off and isn't surprised when Scorpius embraces him. He closes his eyes and hugs Scorpius back with a sigh.
"Take Hermione and Ron with you." Jameson muttered flatly with clenched fists.
"What's the matter?" He asked, worried about Harry's behaviour. Harry did not answer which escalated his worry. "Harry, what is the matter? Will you tell me?"
"Let's have breakfast, eh?" Harry murmured "It's my turn to prepare. Just wait for a few minutes on the table."
"Where are you going?" Harry asked and Draco snapped at him "I am settling down in the next room."
Stupid distracting git.
"Aunty Siri." Harriet squeals as soon as they land inside the place. Black was waiting for them, dressed in blue muggle shorts and a white shirt. She grins and kneels down to pick little Harriet up.
She sniffs and wipes her eyes but tears keep on falling relentlessly down her cheeks and all the while Lily's son's green eyes stare at her just like Lily used to do when Petunia cried.
He threw another pebble and stared at the ripples it created. Their was only one way to secure Harry's happiness. He threw the last pebble and turned towards home.
Draco looked at each of them and shrugged Harry's hands, murmuring "It's fine if Harry sits with me." before shifting his trousers a bit. He walked towards the bed and lay on his stomach on it. He was facing the bed that is why he did not notice Granger look at his injuries and walk towards Harry to slap his face tightly. He looked at his husband who was staring at the bushy haired woman, gaping in shock.
"Will Hogwarts allow it?" Parkinson said, "I mean I heard that it was because the castle was trying to kill the students that it was closed down and sealed."
"Draco, it's me Harry Potter and the dark lord is dead. Please wake up." She shoots up. It's a nightmare. She is so bloody relieved that it's only a nightmare. She pants and looks around. Potter is frozen in front of her. The terror from the nightmare is still lingering in her heart and it makes her think that Potter will hurt her. But he doesn't move, doesn't speak, doesn't even blink.
It would have been better to have no family at all, rather than having such a horrid family.
Draco looked at him again, his eyes searching and nodded "Okay."
Draco stared at him for a few moments. Weasley didn't say anything. Draco waited for the man to say that he was just joking but he didn't.
Severus was quiet for a moment. Harry turned to look at the man. He was looking at Harry now, trying to search something in his eyes and Harry realized with a jolt that he was trying to find his first best friend in Harry. The man stood up abruptly and turned towards the door.
"No, I will not tell anything to you." Draco snapped at him and Harry stayed quiet for a bit. They just looked at each other. Draco's eyes were angry and tortured and Harry's were soft. In the past, he might have gotten angry at Draco's tone but he could clearly see the torture Draco was undergoing.
to take care of both of us." Albus grumbles.
"I would like to bury the hatchet and move on. I am visiting my parents this weekend and I am inviting Harry and Draco as well. We will be having dinner. I would like to invite you." The man's cheeks tinged pink and father looked bewildered. Mother mirrored his reaction. Mother recovered from her shock quicker though and replied, "Of course. Mr. Weasley. Thank You."
Vernon's friends came over on Friday nights and so Petunia had cooked several things and she had entrusted one small task to that boy. He had to make chocolate pudding. But, he couldn't do it and he didn't tell her until much later that he hadn't done it. The five-year-old freak was a waste of space and she had - she had just been so angry that she had lost her calm and commanded him to go and sit inside his cupboard and stay there for the rest of his days and die, if possible. She had been so angry that she had slammed the door shut and then they had ordered the dessert.
"Head auror Potter." Scorpius murmurs softly. Harry looks up to find him closing the door behind him.
"Me too. " Narcissa whispered and buried her face in his chest. Merlin knew that he shouldn't allow her to break down like this but he couldn't stop her.
His recovery had been quick because of Draco.
"I- well, I did not want harry to know about these scars. I, ah-" Draco moaned because the scars burned and Harry whispered, applying the ointment gently "Shhh, a few minutes."
Scorpius only smiles and raises an eyebrow, "Might I ask the reason of this interest?"
" Mate she is right. Don't tell us if your don't wish to but we have to talk if you and Malfoy are resorting to killing yourself now. " Ron said and someone knocked the door which prevented them from saying anything else.
"No. Leave me alone, will you?" Harry snaps at the boy.
Finally, Harry closed his eyes and so did Draco, succumbing to sleep, unaware of their enemies who were waiting for them back in Britain.
Draco takes an unsteady breath before muttering, "Your sister-"
He stomped out of his room to talk to his angry husband, his eyes shining with a newly found strength.
Petunia smiles at him. Vernon frowns because she ends up grimacing instead.
He looked at the rack of knifes and smiled. Harry was fond of cooking and had brought knives of various sizes. He picked up the biggest knife and scratched the pulse on his wrist. It hurt, of course so his eyes became wet with tears. The scratch bled and he closed his eyes to try again.
Their eyes met, Harry's soft and his must have been a bit panicked because Harry whispered, his lips brushing Draco's "You flinched. Did you think that I was going to hurt you just because you placed your thoughts in front of me?"
She is terrified of him. He is hideous. He is a monster, a beast. He is an animal... actually even animals have mercy in them but he has none and her father left her with
"He is alive?" Harry whispered and Hermione nodded.
Harry wondered if he would dominate him because he knew that he won't be able to tolerate it.
"Lucius, leave it." Mother whispered and Draco simply couldn't take it anymore. It was all too much. He snapped at them "You have got the manor now. You can return there. You have elves to serve you."
He takes a deep breath and then another. She's looking so much like Lily that Severus thinks that his heart is breaking into tiny little pieces all over again.
"Potter, we talked about this." Snape murmurs and Harry breathes deeply, taking his fragrance in. His mouth waters.
"It's not required professor. They won't dare to hurt me. They value their lives too much for that. They are truly terrified of me now. You have taught me well." Potter murmurs and Severus blinks. He doesn't know whether he should smirk or grimace at Potter's words. For the first time, he is truly afraid of what Potter might do if the Dursleys even touch a single strand of her hair.
"Look at me like you usually do." She mutters sharply and he still doesn't understand. He is looking at her like he always does.
The girl leaves, a huge grin on her face and Severus slumps in his chair, rubbing his forehead. She has more of Lily than he had originally thought.
"We want to know about dad and Uncle Draco." Albus mutters a moment later. He is practically vibrating with excitement.
The blow however doesn't come. A moment later, Harry feels harsh hands pull his hair back as the elder brother smirks at him. Harry is so terrified that he just wishes that they had just crucioed on him and gotten done with it.
He wonders if Albus knows. He must. Maybe, that's why he hid her with the Dursleys and forced her to live there every year.
A/n: According to my story, Voldemort stopped ageing after 27 because of creating multiple horcruxes. Everyone is alive since Harry didn't die when he was little
be pleased to hear this.
"Harry." Draco murmured softly and Harry stared at him, his eyes furious and his hands clenched into fists.
That was that. Draco smiled and they had dinner peacefully.
"And." Harry asked and Draco stared at him once again.
Severus sighs and closes his eyes.
Draco woke with a jerk and saw Harry looking at him, puzzled, his eyebrows raised in confusion. His hands searched for his kids and he did not find them. He got up and looked around himself. He was in their room and they did not have kids. It was a dream and he looked at his empty hands, craving for their kids.
"DRACO." He wailed. Draco did not answer but he heard a loud voice trying to get through him. The voice belonged to his Ron.
Harry looked at Draco and asked softly "Should we proceed or should I fix appointment with another healer?" Hermione wore her gloves and continued "I know a healer who is good and I can get your appointment fixed."
"Yes. Please come in Ms. Malfoy." He says after a few seconds. His voice is overly sweet and his eyes are gleaming with something Draco can't place. The office is quite spacious and beautiful. Behind Potter's chair, there is a large window that is currently covered by blue curtains. The walls are painted cream and the furniture consists of a table and a few chairs.
He had felt anger many a time in his life but he had never been so furious in his entire life. Neither had he felt so possessive for anyone. He wanted Draco with him immediately. He wanted to claim him as his.
Tessa had hugged both of them in turns and had thanked them, her eyes bright and hopeful for the first time they had met her and Harry had been proud of himself.
"Potter." Draco repeats, "Are you using magic?"
"We'll do anything that we can." Severus continues.
"Draco." She hears Potter murmur and realizes that tears are streaming down her eyes. She looks at him and whispers, "I will get it aborted."
"I'm sorry." He repeated and licked his lips.
forgotten him." Snape speaks slowly, as if explaining it to a child.
Last Harry heard of Draco was when she married Theodore Nott straight after graduating. Completely unlike what Harry had thought, she quit her studies and soon after she gave birth to a baby girl.
Albus nods but refrains from saying anything.
Draco's eyes narrow and he takes a deep breath. He can't apparate without his wand and he doesn't know where he is. The supposed secret that Weasley is talking about doesn't escape his notice. He stores it for later consideration. What is Burbage hiding?
Harry sighs before murmuring, "May I sit, sir?"
"Yes," Malfoy answered after a few moments, "I do. Now, if your highness is done threatening me, can we proceed to the staff room," and she pulled her wand away, nodding warily. She didn't trust Malfoy, primarily because he was a man and men couldn't be trusted. They had a one track mind and they always had an ulterior motive.
Harry moaned and Draco murmured, "Surrender. I want you to surrender Harry."
His lip is cut and his nose is bleeding and there's a scratch on his right cheek.
The sounds of pain that escape her mouth as she wipes her eyes again and again are heart wrenching and though it is close to impossible to restrain his tears, he doesn't cry. He simply swallows and strokes her hair. After a few moments Ron and Hermione come inside.
Just when he is at the main exit, he murmurs back, "No. I was drunk and so were you. It meant nothing. I want to become a death eater, just like my father. I believe in the dark lord's cause and I want to make my father proud. It's an honor Potter and you will eat your words when my lord will defeat you. You are my lord's enemy and I am warning you to stay away. Do not piss me off." because the kiss can't mean anything, can it? He will be marked in about two and a half weeks and Potter is destined to defeat his lord. There is simply no point of thinking over the impossible.
They believed what they wanted to. They saw what they wanted to. No-body dared to look beneath the surface. Maybe Dumbledore knew but then he just cared for the greater good. They believe that Riddle is dead. Voldemort is dead for sure but Riddle is very much alive. No-one knows that Riddle and Voldemort were two different beings and she was the one who had inadvertently helped Riddle. Lucius Malfoy was the one who started initiated everything. He used her innocence and love for himself and pushed her inside a pit so deep that she doesn't think she will ever get out of it.
He stands up and finds a couple of kids staring at him. He fumes when he realizes that they are snickering and pointing at him. He glares at them but they just start laughing harder. Draco grimaces. It's not their fault. He must look a sight. But they will still suffer for making fun of him once he gets the post. If Potter wants a potions master to teach the students, he couldn't do better than Draco, not when uncle Severus only brews potions and gave up teaching long back.
With these words, he was gone and Harry closed his eyes. He had known that Severus had always seen mum in him and had missed her.
"MALFOY." She shouted and his eyes cleared a bit. She continued "He is alive. He will live. He has injuries and won't be able to walk for a while. He won't take help from Ron or me. He needs you here, Malfoy. Are you coming or not?"
"I think that you're over reacting," Blaise said suddenly and Draco looked back to find him wiping his hands and then he looked at Granger. She was still not looking at him but her hands were clenched into fists.
"Look at me. I am not afraid of scars and I certainly won't judge you for having them." He says.
Lucius and Narcissa entered the room, Narcissa sad and Lucius's face as unreadable as ever.
"Enter," she muttered and the door opened and what she saw left her speechless. There, on her doorstep was Dudley - a much slimmer, grown-up version of Dudley. His cheeks were sunken and there were dark circles under his eyes. How could her son have aged ten years in one night?
Draco's heart had sped up and he couldn't stay put. With trembling hands, he took out the photos and had a look at them. As promised, they constituted him naked and covered with come of Mark Smith and some friend that he had often called when hiring Draco.
She had no time to change. Her night gown will have to do for now. She unlocked her door very slowly and opened it. She drew both her sword and wand and looked on both the sides.
"Can I tell you something?" He asked hesitantly and Harry nodded "Yes."
"I-" Draco started and Severus barked "GO."
"I did warn you Draco." Pansy's voice come from no where and Draco stares at her.
house, he had sought Severus out and had completed his internship under him. He had become a potions master.
Two hours later find Harriet in his room in 5, Privet Drive. She had spent the train ride, hidden under her invisibility cloak. Ron and Hermione had searched for her but she didn't have the strength to talk to anyone. That the kiss didn't mean anything to Malfoy is annoying and depressing.
They grow silent for a few moments. Harry doesn't have any idea as to what he will do if it happens.
After a pause Harry continued "I swear Draco. If something happens to you, I will follow you. I won't live alone."
Fortunately, two elves bring their dinner and the third one brings utensils for them. She is hungry and it distracts her effectively, if only for a few minutes because the elves have brought hot chocolate for her and it reminds her of hot water that he threatened her with.
"When did you leave her in his premises?" Somehow Harry manages to ask and Lucius murmurs, "Three hours back."
Potter closes her eyes, sighs and shakes her head before opening her eyes, "You know as well as I do that fate has nothing to do with our mating and I know that she is a veela. I have seen the signs myself. I can't risk this. I'll go to France. They will study at Beauxbatons. It'll be safe."
"And now, Draco." Harry spoke very softly. Draco had been quiet so far because Harry had been right. But now, he was worried so he tried to walk towards Harry "Harry, what-"
But, Creevy took the picture anyways. Draco's blood boiled. This was - this was
"I don't have any wrong intentions. Will that suffice for now? I will tell you the truth when I think that you will believe me." He continues in a soft voice.

His voice is melancholic and defeated yet her face lits up and she wraps her arms around him before resting her face on his shoulder. He places his hands on the small of her back, feeling a little bit awkward.
What he did understand was that he had wasted another precious day. So, he would come tomorrow and cast the curse and get it over with and get on with his plan to take over Hogwarts. He would probably become the youngest minister of magic in the history of magic. Well, technically, the youngest. He would make new laws restricting mudbloods and half bloods from using magic.
Draco smirked "Will Remus come today?"
Draco did not reply for a few moments but Harry was aware that the blonde had not left the room.
"No. I don't think I ever will be well again." She murmurs and turns around. Her eyes gaze silently at him. They are wet again.
Harry's lips interrupted his apology. Harry pressed Draco's hips and Draco moaned in Harry's mouth when their groins rubbed.
Draco's eyes were full of desire and glee but there was a fake blush on his face as he faced Sirius. Harry's eyebrows rose in surprise when he saw Sirius's face. His hands were somewhere near his crotch but his face was white and his eyes were fearful.
"I had cast a warming charm on your breakfast. HAVE IT BEFORE GETTING UP." Harry yelled and Draco yelled back "All right. No need to scold me."
"It will de-age you to five and you won't remember anything that happened after that age. The memories will be there in your mind but they will be buried too deep to uncover them. You will transform to your own age after four days at 12 A.M. at night and will stay like that for precisely five hours."
Harry nods.
"Draco is a freelance investigator and is here for the case of the pureblood purge. I was wondering if you would agree to be his partner for this case." Black finished.
Through all of it, Harry stayed quiet, reliving all the previous instances when he had confronted Lucius and the man had always avoided looking at him.
"I don't care about that. My son was forced to-" Father stopped because his voice broke off and Draco read his misery this time. His godfather was not faring any better. He had stopped struggling and Draco knew that Draco's arms were the only thing supporting him. He would have fallen down, had Draco not been holding him. Mother was crying silently. Tears streaked down her cheeks as she stared at the fireplace and Draco did not know what to do. He was simply frustrated.
Harry was so bloody surprised. When did he imply that Ron and Hermione were more important?
Draco continued, looking at the woman "I hid them well. I applied glamours and applied some cream when they hurt. I had painkillers. I never sought professional help."
He walked towards the floo and knelt down to receive the floo call. He was confused as well as irritated to find Granger's face in his floo.
She took a deep breath, blinked a couple of times and continued, "It's come to the point when-"
Dad doesn't say anything. Nor does Albus. So it's mom who continues with a sigh, "You knew that this would happen eventually."
"I heard a scream." Harriet said.
Harry knew that Draco was hiding something crucial from him and he would not tell anything to Harry. This did not change the fact that he wanted to know what Draco was hiding because whatever it was, it was eating Draco from inside.
He held Harry's shoulder and Harry turned around, a smile on his face, longing gone. He wanted to hide it from Draco but Draco knew now. However, he did not say anything except "I have brought snacks. Where are Granger and Weasley?"
"Harry, wait." It's Snape who says these words. The softness in his voice leaves Petunia stunned.
"Why does this always happen Remus. Why is he never there when his godson is going through a difficult phase?" He snarled and heard Mrs. Malfoy whisper "All of us are upset Mr. Potter. Please calm-"
Draco had expected them to shout or scowl atleast but they did not utter a word, choosing to nod instead.
Dudley looked at him, his brown eyes twinkling merrily and his lips upturned in a smile and murmured "Of course, it is me. I had a makeover." Then the man burst into peals of laughter, his hand on his stomach.
One could argue why he had chosen the muggle way but he knew that the magical one would be painful.
Draco noticed his frown and muttered "I will be fine Harry."and Harry sighed "I am worried."
Her mind became blank. She couldn't understand what Vernon was saying - oh, she understood the words but she was sure that she was misinterpreting their meaning because surely Dudley or Vernon had let that boy out as they usually did.
"Come closer Ms. Malfoy." He says and Draco obliges him. She stops when she is standing close to him. She is standing too close for comfort but she has no other choice.
"I was afraid. It's okay. It's past and I will never meet him again so it's fine. " Harry said and Draco argued " I will pay your uncle a visit though. "
Sirius grins and ruffles Harry's hair and Snape nods before muttering, "Summon your invisibility cloak Potter. Let's move."
"What?" Harry snaps, "Your godson is a
"Why are you so interested in Draco all of a sudden and where did you get Potter's memories of that night?" The man asks the questions Albus was dreading.
Now that he was looking properly at her, he could see that she had lost a lot of weight. She was looking very thin and her hair had lost its shine. She was not looking well.
Cold water falls upon his head and removes every trace of his tears. However the ache in his heart refuses to leave. He places his hands on the wall of the shower stall and presses his forehead on it. Water continues falling on his back. He had known that it was too good to be true. Draco was always very attractive, in every sense of the word and it didn't matter that he was a Malfoy and Harry, well, he was not attractive. Not that it was his fault. It's a miracle that he was even alive after what the Dursleys fed him. He's scrawny and his arms are too thin and his glasses are ugly and even his legs are too thin. Dudley's punches have left blue marks on his forearms and stomach and his hair are too messy. To top it all off, he has a permanent scar on his forehead. He should have known that someone like Malfoy would never fall for him.
"Yes," Harriet said curtly.
"No need to be disrespectful Mr. Potter-Malfoy." Severus snapped at him and Harry glared at him before continuing "I will inform everyone when he wakes up. Leave."
"Why are you lying, Vernon?" Petunia asked her husband quietly. She knew that she sounded hurt and upset and on the verge of tears. Vernon knew that she had wanted to be a witch when she was a kid, "Why are you doing this to me? You know that I am not a witch. I am not Lily. Lily was a witch. How can you forget that? Harry is a wizard. I can't turn doors into walls. Harry is not dead. He's probably hiding somewhere. I locked him just yesterday night."
"I don't want to talk about this." Now this is slightly complicated. They need to know about Riddle. Seeing that only she knows the entire truth and Riddle could be getting ready to wreak havoc, it is certainly important to know.
He saw Harry's face becoming red with barely restrained fury and muttered, "Good to see you too Sirius. Now back off before my husband kills you." He wanted his voice to be a bit playful and wondered if he was successful. He was repulsed. For one last time, the bastard's both hands rested on Draco's hips and then he backed off with a chuckle and a mumbled, "Got carried away. Forgive me."
"Tell me if there is any change in him, Harry or if he wakes up, even if for a few minutes. Tell him that his parents were here to ease his pain and will always be." She said and left him alone, her shoulders shaking a bit as she walked out. Lucius stood there for a few moments, looking at Harry, before speaking in a curt voice, "I shall let you know the secret when Draco wakes up. I do not wish your wrath on anyone even if that person is responsible for my son's destruction. Jame- Potter won't want his son in Azkaban and neither would Draco and so I will wait for Draco to come back. Only he can stop you from going after them. Another thing is that I accept what you said earlier. I am not retiring and I am going to start writing again. My publishers have been trying to contact me."
What ever he was about to say was interrupted by the urgent tapping of a small owl. Draco open the window to receive the letter and the owl dropped the letter on Harry's hands.
"That must be the wards. I think it is her accidental magic." Harry answered, his eyes sharp "Do not worry. I am here now. Let Draco return. I am sure she must have opened to him. He is good with kids."
"Scorpia sit down." Harry murmurs and she obliges. He decides to leave the 'trouble' she is in for later. She is not ready to share anything yet. He decides to stick to mundane topics for now and smiles at them.
James looks away and doesn't look back until his cheeks regain their normal color.
Ron and the twins are doing a good job. They are holding his hands and the other Weasleys are there as well.
But how can she move on after what happened. How can she forget.
"Hex me if you feel uncomfortable and I don't back off." He murmurs softly and she breaths deeply before nodding.
" Take Draco over to his parent's apartment, eh? They miss him. He has not spoken to them except by owl since they returned. I think he can't face them. " Severus said and Harry nodded " Okay. I will try. All right then, I must be off. He must be waiting for me. "
"Sirius." He whispered again and Sirius blinked before looking at him with an innocent smile, murmuring, "I was actually thinking of staying over here for a few days. I tried to rent an apartment but the good ones were not available."
"No. Harry. Stop." Draco protested in a week voice and Harry wished he could but his lips wouldn't stop their journey.
"Mister," Malfoy insisted and Harry bent down, picking Scorpius in his arms. Of course, Malfoy protested but he was just so weak that he couldn't even stand up before limping.
"James won't like it." He said. Harriet made a face.
a witch. Just because she's unconscious, that doesn't mean that she's dead. Harry is dead. You killed Harry. You killed your sister's child
The conversation had taken place a decade ago when Potter had found Draco and had taken him out of that hell, thereafter marrying him. Severus had always known that marriage had been a very wrong decision. He had tried to reason with Draco but Draco had not wanted his pity.
"Hello, Harry and Ah! Hello Mr. -" Dudley spoke to him politely and turned to talk to Draco. Harry gaped. His jaw fell open in shock because Dudley had never spoken politely to anyone in his complete life except for the time when he had shaken Harry's hands.
" Open your eyes, you git." Draco snapped at him and he was so surprised that his eyes shot open.
Sirius knows what's about to happen. Yet when it does happen, Sirius can't help but smile.
- out of his mind. He didn't sleep a wink that night and after trying for around two hours, he asked Severus to visit him. He had a theory to share with the man about stopping the turning of a person into a vampire after being bitten. Severus did not answer which was not a surprise. The potions master must be asleep as Voldemort should be. He had to be awake for killing the youngest Potter.
"Uncle Siiiirius." His five year old godson's soft voice brings him back from his musings and he blinks his damp eyes. Intelligent and adorable green eyes are looking at him. His lower lip is sticking out in a pout and his hands are joined in front of him.
"Yes." Harry nods, "They have just left."
"None of your business." He answers coolly, "You've no right to pry into head auror Potter's memories."
"Please, just listen to me. I have a daughter and a few years ago, a couple of witches attacked her just because she was a veela. Your potion saved her. She would have died if it hadn't been for your potion. I wanted to thank you and bel- believe me, I regret doing it. I'm sorry." The veela was literally begging, "She would really have died. She was taking her last breath and St. Mungos had refused to treat her. They said that they don't treat Veelas, werewolves and vampires. I can't live knowing that I - that I - hurt you so badly."
. Don't bother him. it won't take long." He replies quickly.
Harriet stared speechlessly at her. Parkinson stared back. Harriet still did not believe this hogwash about an alternate dimension. It wasn't possible, right? She couldn't afford to be in
"Bill, I'm going back to our room," Potter said, her voice overly polite.
But he wasn't father's cousin. In fact, father had no brothers or sisters except aunt Sierra who was his adoptive sister but she hadn't been trained to become a queen and this situation was very delicate. She had no wish to be the one to run this vast empire. She liked dueling and spell making and that's what she did. She taught them and trained new soldiers. There was only one way uncle Severus could become the king. He would have to marry aunt Sierra and they
"He is your father's age."
Harry read the letter carefully behind Draco's shoulders. He had a hunch as to who the writer was but he could be wrong. It could be a trap. So he stayed quiet and waited for Draco to speak. Of course, he knew the words that would escape Draco's mouth.
Together they apparated to Harry's home.
He ran until he was outside the ministry and right before he apparated, he saw his father's shocked face.
When he mumbled, his voice was melancholy, "Yes. Yes he does."
"Of course we don't hate her Harry. She is Hugo's and Rose's friend. They asked us to stay away and so we did." Ron answers. Hermione, however looks at Scorpia's head. She is staring at the table silently. Albus is talking to James and Lily.
"Your game is over and if you want to live, you will come quietly with us." It is Ron who says it and Draco mutters, "It was quite impossible to believe that you were behind all this. All those years, when you pretended to be my friend, you were actually just biding your time."
Petunia was five years older than Lily. Lily wasn't supposed to die before her. Petunia was supposed to beg for her forgiveness and Lily was supposed to be difficult before finally forgiving her and then they were supposed to celebrate the rest of their Christmases together. Petunia was supposed to give Lily, all the gifts that she had purchased for her and never given. She wasn't supposed to die so young.
"This is neither sympathy, nor pity Draco. This is a rational argument I am putting before you. How was it your fault?" Your father never found it important to provide you any knowledge about Muggle systems." Harry spoke blankly. Draco was surprised to notice the tight control Harry had over his emotions.
"You have not committed any sin. It was not your fault." Harry argued and tried to kiss his neck. Draco pulled away from Harry and snapped at him "I do not need your sympathy or pity."
"I won't stop reminding you until all this is over with. If you hadn't-"
This scene never fails to astound Sirius. That James's five year old child would bring a proud man like Severus to his knees is as surprising as it was when Harry had turned three and Severus had asked for the boy's permission for marrying Sirius.
He kissed Draco's head softly and was not surprised when Draco snored. He had known that Draco always slept well with him. What he had not known was that his absence had this effect on Draco. He would never have let Draco sleep alone in the last years of their marriage, had he known it. He wondered if this was the reason Draco cast silencing charms.
Albus looks at him, unable to understand. Mr. Zabini had said something like this too.
Draco was trying to stop his godfather from killing his father. It was all in vain, of course. Severus was an unstoppable force of nature and father had only become stronger in Azkaban. The dementors were banished after Voldemort's defeat.
The kiss was soft and passionate. It was like returning home and Harry realized that he had missed kissing Draco so much. His tongue probed Draco's teeth for entrance and he was granted. His tongue mapped Draco's mouth and Draco's hands buried in his hair. A few seconds passed and Draco started kissing back. He turned Harry's head and kissed Harry deeply. They were sitting on the hard floor on there knees and it was uncomfortable but Harry forgot everything around him. He forgot that Draco's parents were waiting and perhaps others had arrived by now as well. All he knew was that Draco was kissing him back, that he was trying to dominate there kiss, that he was getting his Draco back.
Why was she tolerating the nonsense behaviour of Weasleys?
Draco breathed deeply. This was getting serious. Harry was holding his demons inside him and this statement was a proof of this fact. Draco realized that he was being stupid. Of course, he trusted Harry. He was afraid that Harry would kill them. He decided to make a quick decision and spoke "I trust you."
He stills. She is angry and she needs to vent out. But that's not it. She is slowly losing her mind and he doesn't know what to do anymore. She starts twisting his hand with an intent to break it. He is stronger though and so she can't even budge him. Defeated, she pulls back with a growl.
Harry had no time to howl in pain because that was exactly what he wished to do. He wanted to howl in pain when he saw Draco in front of him. He had just fallen asleep and suddenly, he heard Draco screaming and moaning and he shot awake. For a moment, he had felt that he was having a nightmare but then he blinked and realized that Draco was in front of him and would burn to death if he did not do something.
Albus is bringing his girlfriend after dinner. Apparently, it's a surprise for everyone. He hasn't told even Ginny. Harry is the first one to know. Harry wonders why that is. As such, his kids are closer to him then Ginny which is understandable since Ginny is out of country for most of the year for her matches. They stay with him during holidays. Still it's quite fishy. Albus seemed really nervous when he told about it to Harry. Lily was grinning whereas James was just rolling his eyes affectionately. Both Lily and James made it clear that they won't judge Albus for the choice of his partner and it seemed that they already knew who it was.
"Draco, who has written this letter?" It was Harry who had asked this. Harry was standing just behind him and had read the letter. He spun around and glared at him.
Draco was at the door when he spoke those words. He kept his eyes deliberately closed and Draco whispered curtly "You said that it was just like other treacle tarts, nothing special."
"Kreacher. Kreacher."
She seems a bit surprised when she looks at Hermione but doesn't react. She just takes the offered plate and starts eating with them. Her shoulders are not as hunched as they were before and her eyes are not as haunted.
As he waits for Hermione to accept the call, he sighs and wonders why Malfoy always ends up being in trouble.
godson. The said godson doesn't even know about that.
"Yes." Draco snapped at the man. What were they not telling him. This case was not the sole reason for calling Draco back.
"Maybe, Draco will accept you. He has changed a lot," Severus says, knowing that his words are completely useless. He knows as well as Potter does that Draco is still as prejudiced as he was ten years ago.
"But-"
"Oh for gods sake Malfoy, don't be a git."
Love was strange, Harry decided. Draco's sorrows saddened him and his happiness made him happy. All he wanted was Draco to heal and he had thought that Draco was healing as the days passed.
"They have a right to study here. Your forefathers studied here," Severus tries his best, knowing that it's useless. She has made her decision.
Draco looked at him with utterly sad eyes and Harry's heart clenched. Harry expected him to say something but he just shook his head, mumbling "Nothing."
The journalists asked and Draco's eyes searched for him anxiously.
"She is Albus's girlfriend. They were dating in secret."
"Shut up." He snapped and apparated.
He sighs and walks down the stairs and towards the kitchen and takes jam and bread out of the fridge, waiting for Sirius to come.
"Ahem." Someone clears his throat and Draco turns her face to witness father come inside. She sits upright and stops rocking, wondering why Harry let him-
"It's enough Ron. I need to visit him. I need to- to just talk to him." She muttered after having lunch and Ron sighed "All right, I am coming with you."
She will never forgive her father for this. She doesn't think that she can get over this. She is not feeling anything, neither sadness, nor anger. She is numb and it just hurts so much.
"Shall I put my shirt on as well?" He asked and Draco did not answer. Harry saw helplessness in Draco's eyes and he understood its cause. Desire had not yet disappeared from Draco's eyes yet and Draco must be under a misconception that Harry was angry with him.
A moment later they bid him goodbye and leave. He noticed them talking to Scorpia too. When Hermione hugged her, the kid's shoulders relaxed and her lips twitched in a very small smile.
She concentrates on her soup. The soup is delicious and so is the sandwich that she picks up after finishing her soup. She will most certainly not cry. Voldemort is dead and she can finally live, all thanks to the boy in front of her.
"But now you do." Potter mutters with a straight face. His face is blank and Draco
"I do not know who manipulated me Harry but I want them destroyed. This is the last time I am crying because of those bastards. I am done with brooding Harry. I don't want to die now. When I was in the shower, I realized that I would die and won't be able to live with you and it had been a horrible thought. I want to live with you. I want to live and love and have a beautiful house and a kid who has your eyes and my hair. I- I do not wish to die."
He mentally prepared the words he had to say to his son but Draco had vanished when he turned to speak to him. He sighed and Narcissa "Have patience. We will find him and talk to him by any means today."
Hermione has always been the most perceptive one and Harry is sure that she has made the connection.
She covered her nose. The smell - it was so strong here.
Draco smiles at him and replies, "Yes. I think that would be nice."
She is staring at him, seemingly surprised.
"Let's go out. Weather is quite nice outside." She murmurs, her fingers tapping on the bedsheet randomly.
Black's face loses its sadness and Severus wonders why it matters to him.
"Our son isn't a freak." Petunia insists firmly. Being a freak was what took her sister's death and he won't lose her Dudley too.
Mr. Zabini's eyes widen before he mutters, "Where did you get Potter's memories from?"
Harry doesn't answer. He simply looks at Draco for a few minutes before pulling away and getting out of the bed.
She couldn't breathe properly. It was like everything stank - the carpet, curtains, furniture and even her clothes.
"There he is, Mark." The shout startles Harry out of his musings and he stands straight before attempting to escape yet again. As soon as he takes a step though, one of them comes right in front of him. Harry stares because this is not really possible. They can't apparate. They are muggles, aren't they.
Her eyes lit at that and he told her everything he remembered about Hogwarts, leaving the details about war and only when she looked happy enough, he started "Now. we will go back Tessa. You will have to be brave and I will have the policemen capture him. Everything depends on you now."
Petunia has always been proud of being normal and she loves having a normal family.
He was angry, no actually he was mad, too mad to realize the prudence of anything he was about to do.
"Hermione, I defeated Voldemort and this is just my husband who has perhaps been angry with me for the past four years, rightfully so. He will not hurt me and if he does, then I deserve it. Please leave." He spoke slowly as if explaining to a child.
"I know you're there, you horrible woman," he sneered, annoyed and she revealed herself, pulling the blasted cloak off of her. She was wearing a scowl on her face but her cheekbones were slightly red. Her eyes were impossibly green and those denims fit her. She looked much better in muggle clothes.
"Neither do I care about your apologies, nor about your family. Draco is beyond any help. He is as thick-headed as you were in your youth. Malfoy genes I guess." Rage simmers inside Severus as he relives how Lucius kept him away from Draco.
Please review.
His hands trembled with fury and Draco held his hand to restrain him.
Draco's heart raced and swelled with love when he saw love in Harry's eyes. They were green and exquisite and Draco wanted to drown in them.
"I want to help you-" Harry started and Draco cut him off "I want you to take rest. I will wake you up. Please sleep."
Scorpius chuckles, amused and his eyes sparkle again, "I know that you will. Take care, Mr. Potter. Goodbye."
Dad still doesn't say anything but his jaw clenches tightly.
"This is the beginning of the end Ginny." He warned her and she smirked, "End of Draco Malfoy's marriage with Harry, end of Malfoy's pathetic life. Now even Ron and Hermione are supporting me. We met at The Burrow today for a family dinner."
"She will. Aunt. She will forgive you." Why was he murmuring these words to the woman who had not looked at him with soft eyes even once?
"Okay," came the answer and Draco heard heels clicking on the floor and he did not turn around to stare at her. He did not. Pansy looked at him, surprised at his restraint.
Two days had elapsed since and Hermione had not got any floo call or owl from Harry. She was worried and guilty and just pathetic.
Remus has already left the room and Narcissa is sitting by the window.
He was having an off but Harry was still setting up his academy. He was getting pamphlets printed to get them distributed. Draco was bored and depressed and so he decided to go for a walk. So here he was, in the garden, walking. When he saw a family of four, he stopped to look at them. The couple was playing with their children and were so happy. He could imagine himself with Harry and his kids and felt a lump in his throat. Harry had tried to get him to talk about his sadness but Draco had avoided the topic. He had not answered Harry's questions and had tried to forget everything. Of course, things did not just solve automatically.
"They are not kids and we have to respect their wishes. Did you see how terrified she was? Your people and their senseless prejudice. Why they would insult her for her eye color is beyond me."
Where was that boy, anyway? Why hadn't he woken up yet? Who made these pancakes?
He wonders what it was like to study with a younger version of Draco Malfoy. He really wants to experience it, as impossible and insane as it sounds. The vial is marked as '
Draco stood there with Weasley beside him.
"I fucked her Potter. She was a virgin and I took it away before she could give it to you. I ruined her for you. She will never let you touch her even if you kill me, which you can't." The dark lord snarls at Potter, his fingers pointed towards the green-eyed boy.
"That's preposterous," he says, swallowing, knowing that she was making a valid point, "It's upto fate. You can't decide who Ariana's mate will be, that is, if she
"Why are you not eating anything?" She asked because Vernon's plate was empty. Even his cup was empty. She picked up the kettle. It had tea.
"I AM SORRY FOR THAT." Father stands and glares at me with pained eyes, "THAT WAS MY MISTAKE. HE WAS PUNISHING YOU FOR THAT. His insanity made him forget everything. He was just a small fragment of his soul, a damaged fragment. He had no memories, no morality, no humanity, no goals. His only goal was to destroy everything and I am so-" Father's voice breaks as he settles down again, "-sorry that you paid for my mistake. I couldn't retrieve the prophecy. I wanted to, if only to protect you from his wrath."
"Father, what's Potter doing here?" Asks Draco, his lips curled in a pout.
"Have your breakfast and do not disturb me," Granger answered in a monotone. Her head, once more, was bent upon the papers and so Draco could not see her expression. But, judging from her voice, she was angry.
"I won't. Now please leave so that I can talk to Scorpia."
But Harry was not listening to him.
Father sighed at that and continued in an irritated tone, "I need to tell something. It might be related to the people who manipulated you. Talk to your husband and bring him back. I do not have entire day. I will owl others."
On this note, Draco stood up and left Harry alone to his thoughts. Harry leaned on the table, his elbows resting on it and his hands covering his face. He closed his eyes to gather his thoughts. Draco would sleep in his own room and Harry was worried for him. It was not getting any better. Draco was curling upon itself.
"just yesterday, we-" Draco started and Harry cut him off effectively "I am talking about sex, Draco. I am talking about the fact that you do not want me inside you. Even in the past, I had always avoided the sex part of our relationship because I was aware that you were not ready yet. You might have thought that I didn't care about you but I do and I always did."
Harry nodded and walked towards Draco's lab blindly. He entered it and the letter and photos were lying on the table. As he went through them, his blood boiled. Draco had been blackmailed. The photos made him want to seek the bastard and kill him in cold blood but Draco needed him right now. There would be time for revenge later on.
"What do you want, Draco?" Hermione asked and Draco looked at her "I apologise for slapping you."
"Draco." He speaks her first name which comes as a surprise to her. The name doesn't sound unfamiliar on his lips, as if he has saying it for ages, though she has never heard him say it, "We don't have time. I- listen. I have this portkey."
"Petunia, just-"
"I am not wearin-"
"DRACO." DRACO. What's the matter?" But Draco was not moving. His eyes were closed. "God damnit Draco. Wake up." He shouted and shook Draco's chest wildly.
"How do you know my last name, mister?" Malfoy asked, his eyes narrowed suspiciously. Scorpius lay quietly in Harry's arms. His eyes were fixed on Harry and he seemed very sick and hungry. His lips were chapped and his cheeks were sunken but otherwise he looked like a younger Malfoy. As far as Harry remembered, Scorpius was Albus' age, though he certainly looked younger.
"Coming, sweetheart." Harry replied snidely and Draco cringed "Don't address me by that word."
After hugging her brothers and aunt Sierra for one last time, she left the castle on her white horse, Stone. Uncle Severus forgot one small detail. He was not the lord of the state
Snape thinks that it's because of her jealousy that she stayed away from Lily and maybe it was in the starting but she learned to live with it and at the end, she only wanted to reconcile with her sister. She was only afraid that Lily would never talk to her or forgive her and it's just that-
Realization dawned on Harry's face and he replied softly "You don't have to meet them."
He looks into her eyes and there are many questions that she wants to ask. Why would her molestation effect Potter so deeply? Why are his eyes wet with unshed tears?
"You may leave." Black said and stood up. He leaned against the window and stared out and stood there until all of them left. Draco saw him closing the door, his brows creased.
She got up and then remembered that Dudley should be in school. He should be fifteen and in high school.
He glared at her and said coldly "What do you need?" His voice must really have been cold because she literally staggered and stared at him "I just ne- need to talk to you about Harry."
"I can serve myself." Draco said eating the fruit and Harry smiled "I like serving you. I have missed doing this for the past four year Draco. Do not stop me please."
"What's wrong with you? They might insult you through me." Draco muttered, his voice bitter.
Draco opens her mouth and then closes it again.
She sighed and waited.
"I - we were so inhumane to you Harry. You are my cousin, for gods sake and I despise myself for what I did. I told her a bit about how we treated you and she rarely ever speaks to me and on the top of everything she is a witch and I have no experience with it." Dudley stopped at this and looked at him earnestly "I can not begin to tell you how thankful I am to you."
Why did Harry not understand that he deserved better? Draco was too broken, too insecure.
"Thank you Kreacher. You may go now." Harry said, already accoing his clothes to get ready as the elf bowed and vanished away.
Harry whistles as he walks inside the building. He is happy that he has finally decided not to become an actor. It's nice to not be confused for once. He heads straight towards dad's office, ignoring the secretary's soft, "An audition is going on."
