"Is that why you climbed a tree 4th year? To get my attention? If you wanted and autog-" Harry was cut off by Draco.
Then he heard soft footsteps next to him. But he didn't see anything. Who's footsteps were they? They seemed to close. But no one was there.
What if Harry told Granger and Weasley? What if it got out that Draco Malfoy was a mess? That he had needed help because of some 6th years? That he couldn't live with himself? That Draco had cried? That Draco was weak?
They never bothered to make friends with Slytherins. They never bothered to act kindly. That was why Slytherins kept to themselves. Because everyone else judged them before they had gotten to know them, and it hurt.
But, he had claimed both of them had been insane, not just Harry, but himself too. Malfoy wasn't just a prat, even though that was a big part of it. He was just older than Harry, young, with potential to do the right thing. Even if the big decisions were over, he had thousands of tiny ones he could make. And tiny things add up. Harry knew he was venturing down a dangerous path, but Malfoy had changed, perhaps for the better.
Harry wasn't hot during any previous encounter. Not when he took off his shirt during the Triwizard Tournament. Not when he was out of breath after Quidditch practices. Not when he ran his hand through his hair every second of every day. Nope.
Draco gave a small smile, but started off in to a slightly-more-detailed-than-necessary summary of the book. Harry listened intently. Draco really liked the book, and his eyes seemed to light up when he got to his favorite parts in the book (something about trolls and another part about riddles). Harry liked the way he started to use his hands to explain things. And the way his smile seemed to reach his entire face. He also explained how the creatures were different that the actual things in real life. Apparently elves were beautiful and there were only seven wizards.
"When did you start drawing?" Harry asked quietly. It was a simple question, nothing personal, and it could be answered with one or two words.
Now that was a class he would really need to focus in. He was never really fond of potions, and he blamed Snape for that, but the professor had been a good man in the end. And Slughorn would be teaching, so it wouldn't be that bad. He hoped. He did well last year he was in school, but that was thanks to a book he had found. This year was definitely going to be hard. He just needed to get at least 5 N.E.W.Ts of Exceeds Expectations. McGonagall recommends he go for Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Potions, and Charms. Harry also hoped to add Care for Magical Creatures to that list. With of course Apparition, all Aurors needed to be able to properly apparate.
He saw Draco turn down a corridor to the left. He picked up his pace and turned the corner and rushed to Draco who was in the middle of the hall.
Pansy and Blaise were in there doing homework on Blasie's bed. They smiled up at him, but didn't talk.
"Well, Ronald, if you think about it, the teachers have to fit in another class into their schedule, today was probably the only day free. And some of our courses tomorrow run longer than others. You and Harry have a class of Care of Magical Creatures, I have Arithmancy and a extra Charms class. Sadly McGonagall hadn't let me sign up for more." Hermione added.
It wasn't Harry, it was another Gryffindor boy. He came in covering his mouth. Apparently, he had gotten his teeth turned into rubber by a candy.
Harry gently touched Draco's arm and lead him back to the hospital bed, Madam Pomfrey probably wouldn't like him being up. Draco complied, not saying a word as he sat down on the bed.  Harry sat next to him and looked down at his feet. It had been a weird day. He had learned a lot, even though Draco hadn't said much. But Harry was glad he had taken the risk of talking and telling the truth in the bathroom. He didn't know what would have happened if he hadn't wondered where Draco was. If he had brushed it off. He shook his head, he couldn't let himself get worked up on 'What If's.
"It's about Malfoy," Harry said quietly, he looked over to Luna, trying to see if it was okay to continue. She hadn't said anything, so he began, "I've just noticed, that he seems to be quiet. And that he hasn't been talking much, like he used to. He's been letting people make fun of him, letting himself get bullied, and it... it just seems odd. I mean... I glad he's not being mean... but he also isn't really... I don't know... himself... and it's weird. I've only heard him insult Hermione, Ron, and myself once or twice... I mean, it's okay that he's not being mean... but he's just not..." Harry was really at a loss for the right words.
Why would Draco fear, he was born to be a Death Eater. He was groomed to continue the Malfoy legacy of darkness. Then it hit Harry. All the similarities between them. Suddenly Harry knew what to say.
"You much have a lot to make fun of me for, considering how many times I've almost died in the last seven years. At least twice each year, not including the one summer dementors had attacked me and my cousin." Harry said pulling his knees to his chest.
Draco Malfoy was nervous. But not for the reason most people would think. He was nervous because he would be seeing people again. He had spent the entire summer locked up in Malfoy Manor because he didn't want to see or talk to people. He was definitely worried about the stares and the immense about of bullying he was going to get, but he deserved it. He was nervous about having to talk, and worried he'd be hexed repeatedly.
It's now or never he thought tiredly, and he laughed humorlessly. He followed the sea of student to the carriages, and already got death glares. His right hand instinctively touched his left forearm, it was going to be a long year. The thestrals were as beautiful as he heard a Ravenclaw say a few years ago. Dark and thin, looking like death.
One by one he tried and reversed to effects, and most people passed. Malfoy's, unsurprisingly, worked the best, making all of Slughorns wrinkles fade away and his teeth white. Slughorn joked that he didn't want to reverse it. Ron said it must be why Malfoy isn't as ugly as one would think a awful git like him would be. Harry silently agreed Malfoy wasn't ugly. But he saw the bags under his eyes, and Harry knew the potion would have taken those away. Malfoy was all his own. Not that Harry thought he was attractive, just not ugly.
She stayed quiet for a minute, as if wondering what she should say. She sighed, and Draco knew he won. "Okay. Just eat today." They heard the door open and two set of footsteps started to exit. "Have a good day, Dray." Pansy said. The door closed softly as they left.
Then the professors walked out and Hagrid winked at Harry as he passed. McGonagall walk briskly towards them, and motioned for them to stay seated. She looked at each and everyone of them before crossing her arms and smiling at them.
"But I'm not like the rest of you, I'm the Chosen One." Harry looked up and put on his biggest grin then dramatically ran his hand though his hair.
Harry nodded, "I wanted to give it back to you after your trial, but you had already left when I was leaving. I wanted to give it back to you in person, so I didn't owl it to you. Then I forgot I had it in my trunk."
He found a smooth, uncut place, just at the head of the snake, dangerously close to his wrists. Not that he cared.
Usually, he had no self-control when it came to this, but now, he felt like it would cause more problems. Please, he begged to himself, no more problems.
She had given him a chance to prove himself. Hopefully he had surpassed what she had thought of him. Draco even surpassed what he thought of himself.
Harry was walking over to the fireplace when he saw he wasn't alone. Someone else was in a chair slightly angled away from Harry, but he knew who it was. Draco Malfoy had let his hair grow out over the summer, that and the fact his hair wasn't gelled back, made it seem longer. He almost looked like his father, but his mothers traits made his face softer. Harry noticed he was drawing something, he made long strokes with his drawing quill and traced it over carefully. His legs were pulled up onto the chair with him, and the bottom of his sketch pad rested on his knee, while his left hand held it with his fingers clutching it from the top.
"Still, we should still talk, be friends. We haven't really hung out in a while like we used to." She added as the set the book she had been holding next to her.
Abomination. The word that had truly sent him spiraling. He tried to forget just how much he agreed with that word, but he couldn't. He was an abomination.
"Are you okay? You're usually out of bed by now. Are you feeling well?" Her voice was laced with concern. He really should try to mend their friendship.
Draco looked up again at Potter, and let his eyes linger. He sketched Potter with his eyes, moving them along his back and hair. Then he went back to the parchment, and drew in Potters wildly perfect hair.
Draco Malfoy cried silently. Tears streamed down his face, and his heart seemed to be getting crushed by all the words spoken to him that day.
She was about to turn away when she decided the conversation was not over. "I noticed you weren't in classes today."
When he stepped inside, he saw Harry. He had half a mind to walk over there, but Harry wasn't alone. Weasley was with him.
"So should you." Potter commented and sat down in a near by chair, tucking his feet under himself and crossing his arms tightly around his chest.
Dinner rolled around and passed Draco slowly. Harry, of course, had to talk to his friends, so Draco was left alone once again.
He had put on his robes as the train had left the station, and sat quietly looking out the window. He had never really looked at the view. It was peaceful, surreal, and green. And this was the second to last time he'd see it. Assuming he survived to see it on the way back.
But Harry looked so broken in his arms. So scared, he was shaking, she was hanging onto Draco’s shirt for dear life.
Then, the breeze that had felt like fingers running through his hair had turned into someone actually playing with it.
Draco hated feeling anything he couldn't describe. He so badly wanted to know. But he had never felt this way before. It was almost guilt, but warmer.
"Point taken." Harry said shrugging. "The only reason I went with her was because Cho had already said yes to Cedric, and it was Ron who asked them anyway. I didn't really dance, it was a boring night." Harry said, though he did remember the odd conversation he over heard Hagrid having.
He finally had enough of his hair and did a quick charm that put in into a small bun. Then he put is wand back into his pocket and paced back and forth in front of the fireplace.
It wasn't that Harry was stalking Malfoy. But he had been wondering where he was. Even though he usually didn't eat lunch, Harry's curiosity had gotten the better of him. He quickly finished a small lunch, and headed to his dorm, where he pulled out the Marauders Map and scanned it until he found Draco Malfoy written above a pair of feet. He then noticed all the names around his. In a circle, surrounding him. At first Harry had no idea what was going on, because he didn't really recognize any of the names, so he thought maybe they were his friends. But Harry knew better.
As they left the hall, he stood up painfully. He clutched his abdomen, there was defiantly something broken. But he couldn't care less. He fucking deserved it.
"We went as friends. and you went to the Ball with one of the Patil twins, does that mean you two dated?" Draco said, pointing out that who you go with to a Ball does not determine you you date.
All of course from his photographic memory. He thanked his mother for that. It was why he did so well in classes. Or used to.
"Really? Didn't you go to the Yule Ball with her?" Harry said, but did Draco hear some relief in his voice? But why would Harry be relieved that he had never dated Pansy?
He looked where they were facing, and saw Draco Malfoy ignoring a group of 6th years that were making fun of him. Malfoy walked off pretending not to notice them. He walked off in the opposite direction, and Harry wondered why he was going. They had lunch, then the 8th years had Transfiguration. But Malfoy was going down another hall. Not that it mattered to Harry. Malfoy was is own person, he could handle himself. But Harry found himself worrying about Malfoy during lunch none the less.
"Yes." Draco said, trying to keep the grin off his face. At last the smile won and Draco beamed. Harry could have sworn that it actually let off light. Draco's eyes were bright and filled with raw happiness. "Thank you." He muttered softly, much like Harry had done earlier.
Harry seemed to always be accompanied by calm, and that was what Draco had needed. He had had another nightmare.
Draco rolled his eyes. "I'm not denying anything. I only watched him because he was my rival. You two wouldn't understand."
Harry Potter wasn't in the mood to talk to Ron. Not that he was in a bad mood, in fact if Ron had asked him anything else he would have said something. But Ron had asked about Malfoy.
When she had walked off Harry pulled up a chair and sat down next to Draco who had stayed quiet. He took the potions one by one, making a face at the last one. "I can't be as bad as skele-gro. Do you remember when Lockheart removed all the bones from my forearm? I had to stay here over night and regrow them, it was rather painful." Harry said trying to make Draco say something. Sure he was used to the silence, but right now Draco didn't need to be alone with his thoughts.
He looked down at the blank page in his lap. He had been so caught up in hating himself, he hadn't drawn Harry.
"If you two are done bickering like an old married couple, I'd like to show Draco the finishing touches." Luna said before Draco could respond. Draco felt so much better, like he had friends. Luna calling him by his first name made him feel like maybe they were friends.
"Ronald." Only Hermione and Mrs.Weasley called him that. "Just because we're together doesn't mean we can't be friends, and do friend things. Besides, the 3 of us aren't dating, we can't leave Harry out of it." She turned to Harry, but he didn't say anything.
"I exceed at everything I try, thank you very much. I wouldn't expect you to understand exceeding." Draco said mater-of-factly.
There was green flashed every where. Screams that filled the air. His own heart was crushed by the sadness and desperation in those cries, because the ones screaming weren't the ones who were dying, it was their loved ones. They were the screams that haunted him in every waking second. Every single thought he had was joined with a heart broken cry that split the world into two. And they were his fault. He caused those. Because of him and his half-assed plan to defeat the most evil dark wizard that had ever risen to power.
"I'm up. But if you jump on me, I'll murder you. You know I will." Draco said from behind the curtain, sure Pansy wouldn't really care that Harry was there, but Draco didn't feel like explaining.
Sure he had the unfair advantage of the Map. But he wasn't invisible. How could he sneak past Madam Pomfrey's watchful eyes that never seemed to rest.
"Y-yes. It should still be warm." Draco was confused on the change of subject, but much to Harry's delight, he didn't press. "It's on the bed side table on the other side. I didn't want to wake you when it came."
Draco sighed, sat down and pulled out his sketch book and looked up briefly at Potter. It was a new day and a new position, he couldn't really bring himself to not draw Potter.
"They've gotten used to my random absences. and that's not what wonder means. But if you want me to leave..." Harry sad playfully. He smiled and started to get up.
Both he and Potter weren't able to sleep. He gave a short laugh. Perfect Saint Harry Fucking Potter had something in common with Draco Malfoy, a wizard disaster.
"How long do we have 'till people start to wake up?" And ruin the moment. Harry honestly couldn't wait to spend the day off from classes with Draco.
Harry gave a small laugh. If only Draco knew that he had almost been sorted into to Slytherin. Harry began to wonder what life as a Slytherin would have been like. He might of become friends with Draco sooner. Might have joined in on his antics, if only to be normal. Would he have become seaker first year? Would he have saved Ginny second year? What would Remus and Sirius had thought? Would he had been put into the Triwizard Tournament? Would he and Draco become more than friends? Harry shook his head at thought. Where had that come from?
Draco heard Nott get ready and leave. As Nott open the door, he heard Pansy say a brief hello and come into the room.
WARNING!! Detailed depictions of self-harm. For those who do not want to read it, there will be a summary at the end, you can skip ahead to that.
Harry didn't see Malfoy again until Transfiguration, when he walked in and Malfoy was already sitting down. Harry wondered where he had gone to. Not that it mattered, he was just curious. Besides, Harry could understand why Malfoy had not wanted to be in the Great Hall with that many people. Harry probably understood more than anyone else.
"The Hobbit. It's my favorite book." He peered over at the cover for a second. "Have you ever read it?" He asked politely, he took Harry's snort as a no. "Well, it's really good. I would recommend it, but you aren't really a reader are you?" He asked sarcastically.
Everyone was is a lively, cheerful conversation when the plates were cleared and prefects escorted everyone to their dormitories. And just like they had been told, the 8th years stayed behind to wait for the Headmistress, who was talking to the professors.
But, Slytherin wasn't free from inter-house bitterness. Slytherins viewed everyone else as below them, pressed this idea onto the younger Slytherins. They never tried to be greater, break the stereotype. They became what others had accused them of, evil.
Harry looked to Malfoy and saw a blank, calm, expression, but his eyes seemed to say differently. Harry immediately wondered what he would ask. Many questions came to mind, but he knew if he asked to wrong one, the silent morning were going to be ruined. As much as he wanted to know Malfoys secrets, the would rather have silence. So taking the Veritaserum, he again looked at Malfoy who had also just taken some. They sat in a now awkward silence for a few seconds.
Draco whipped around and snarled, "You would know about swan dives Weasel, I've seen you on a broom. Flying would be to generous of a term. It was more like you falling then catching yourself just before you bust your fat arse." Draco spat.
He started to cry. It was silent, and soft. The tears spilled onto his cheeks before rolling onto the ground. He stared up at the ceiling, his vision blurred and dark. Harry pushed his glasses off of his face and rubbed his eyes. He calmed his breathing.
But Draco didn't feel like talking about the War and what happened after. He knew that was exactly what they'd ask him about.
"I don't know Harry, maybe then you should just wait and see if it gets better. But I think waiting will just make your head even more of a mess. If you do decide to talk to him, do it while both of you are alone. It might help if it's only you two, he'd be more likely to be honest with you." Luna gently touched his shoulder.
Harry's eyes. Gemstone green. They stood out against his darker skin. His eyes were a lighter, jade colour, with darker, murkier rims that bordered his pupil and the edge of his irises.
Draco snorted, "Please, if anything they should have taken things away from you. Surely the Chosen One could have figured it out without any extra help." He narrowed his eyes but Harry saw a small smile creep onto his face.
His heart was far from calm and he was shaking. His lack of vision and the dark not helping the situation. He felt like he was choking, suffocation, drowning in the air in his dorm. He made himself get up, throwing the sweat soaked blanket off his still aching legs and stumbled out of his bed.
Harry was holding the shaking blond, drawing caressing circles on the smaller of his back. But the forest was no longer quiet, he could hear somebody approaching. It could be friends but it could be as well enemies and Harry wasn't going to stay around to find out.
"Draco, stop it." Harry said as he took hold of Draco’s wrists and put the blond’s hands on his chest. Draco’s hand immediately grabbed onto his shirt making it crumpled, but Harry didn’t mind, it was much better then Draco pulling on his hair.
I take off on my brown and quickly reach him. Madame Hooch is shouting something at me but I can’t hear her and honestly I don’t care. I place my hand on the handle of Neville’s broom to steady it a a bit.
Harry was no longer hard, he wanted to show his Slytherin prince exactly how beautiful he was and how much he wanted him but this was not time to play around. So he moved to lie next to Draco, leaving one hand on his waist.
"Just reminiscing about good old times." Draco answered and tried to hold back the laugh but just one more eye contact with Hermione tipped them both over the edge and they were laughing again.
"So we were friends… before?" Draco asked, hoping that maybe, just maybe they were more then friends. This was all so strange to him but he was happy about this connection to Harry and the way Harry said he was special made his heart beat a little bit faster.
It felt so strange and warm and good and when Harry softly brushed over one of Draco’s nipples the blond boy couldn’t help but moan softly.
"Harry, it’s your Birthday today and I haven’t given you anything yet. It would be an honour if you let me pay for your wand." I say to Harry and Ollivander understands.
We stand by our broomsticks like Madame Hooch instructs and say "Up". Mine and Harry’s immediately jump into our palms and Harry grins at me happily.
"I wanted to do this for you ever since we were in a third year in Hogwarts." Draco admitted, blushing. "I wanted to... " Draco didn’t know how to continue, he managed a small smile but his eyes were troubled.
"No, originally it would but I mixed it with strong dreamless sleep, he will be out of it for two or three days." Hermione smiled.
"Yes, we are! Protecting the sensitive young Slytherins from nasty garlicky teachers!" George replies.
"I have to ask you for a proof," the Head Warlock said sadly. One look at the blond sobbing boy and the way he held himself and she knew Miss Granger wasn't making this up.
"It’s okay, I got you. We will warm you up in a second. Let’s get you to the fireplace, it will be nice and warm. " Harry wrapped him up in the towel and stood up, carrying him in his arms out of the bathroom.
Draco lifted his face from Harry’s neck and looked at him, his eyes glazed, his skin pale but flushed along the cheekbones. "Please Harry… I want you inside me."
Good, with Voldemort prancing though the Hogwarts, I’m not very comfortable that Harry and Hermione don’t know even basic defence. But they will learn, we can even have first session this weekend.
My mother is alive again, I am so overcome with emotions and I hug her, blinking away the wetness threating to overflow from my eyes.
Draco came to kitchen and hesitated for a while, thinking where should he sit. There were two places with breakfast ready in front of them, one next to Harry and one opposite him. Harry noticed Draco’s indecisiveness and pulled out the chair next to him.
Ron and Hermione were sitting at the kitchen table, not talking and avoiding each other's eyes. Harry pulled out a chair next to Hermione and sat down, thinking how should he start this conversation but Ron started to talk first.
He pretended to care about blood and about the future of the wizarding kind, but it was all a lie. He was crazy and he murdered anybody who dared to disagree with him or just simply happened to be in a wrong place at a wrong time.
Draco wasn’t able to walk on his own so Harry carried and gently lowered him on the bed. He lied down next to him and pulled him onto his chest into a hug.
Harry didn’t tell Draco about how in his last moments the blond smiled at him and told him that it’s okay and not to cry.  And that he didn’t even realize he was crying until he heard him say that. Neither did he tell him that he kept apologizing after the life slipped away from the blond boy and stayed with his body till after the battle. Later he thought he just cried because of the shock of killing other person but now he knew that it was because it was Draco.
"I will stay with you until you fall asleep. And even after, I will be in the house, checking on you. And when you wake up you will feel better." Harry explained as he drew Draco even closer, breathing in his smell.
"I’ve flown before but Harry is really amazing, this was actually his first time on the broom. Congratulation on winning our race." I say proudly and put arm around his shoulders. He blushes and leans into my side mumbling thanks.
"You’re being so good for me," Harry said. "Don’t worry about anything, just relax and keep looking at me, alright?"
"Harry, I … don’t want him apologizing to me now. I would rather not see him again today. I just want to maybe take a bath and sleep or read a bit."
"Focus boy. You might yet have a chance at not spending lifetime in Azkaban if you reply no to my next question." Robards barked. "Draco Malfoy, did you or did you not serve the Lord Voldemort?"
Head Warlock Marchbanks was angry and so was Harry. There were always so many incompetent idiots at the ministry. If he thought he could help Draco in anyway, he would be right next to him but Hermione was handling the situation better then he would. He would have hexed Robards. He still might.
is a light spell, used for cleaning but what do you think happens if somebody points their wand at your eyes and casts it? Most of the wizarding families, especially the ones with long tradition, understand this and continue to learn both Light and Dark Arts. But I guess yours is an exception, you are a Weasley, aren’t you?" I ask and look him up and down. To Harry and Hermione, it looks harmless, but I can tell he knows I’m judging him.
Ollivander hands him more and more wands but none of them is the right one and they are both growing frustrated.
Draco woke up for a few minutes at time, enough to go to bathroom and drink and eat a little bit but always falling asleep quickly after. Harry often sat next to him, stroking his soft hair and watching him sleep for a while or reading a book.
"Draco, that was brilliant!" Hermione exclaimed, full of excitement and the blond Slytherin blushed a bit.
"And you Kreacher, I want you to clean up a bit and make meals for Draco. If you slip any poison into his food or harm him in any way, I will set the portrait of Walburga on fire and then deal with you. You also aren't allowed to tell anybody he is here." Harry said sternly.
"Thank Merlin it worked!" Hermione said and collapsed onto chair with relief. "We really needed to have it done now. We don’t have much time."
Harry slowly slid off Draco’s underwear and took his erection into his palm. It was average in size but nice shape and lovely pink colour. Its head was already leaking precum and Harry spread it along the shaft instead of lubricant.
"You tell me, Draco…" Harry sighed. "I found you, sleeping, no … passed out in the bath." Harry explained as he rubbed the blond’s body with the towel.
Other students are looking forward to Defense against Dark Arts class but I’m nervous because I know that Quirell has Voldemort stuck at the back of his head. It’s revolting and I don’t want to be in the same room with him. But I cannot just skip it and even if I could, I wouldn’t send Hermione and Harry there alone.
Powerful surge of dark green sparkles come out of the wand’s tip and Ollivander’s eyebrows rose even higher than I thought possible.
"No, Harry, please, no fire." Draco whimpered. He was scared of fire. Just a mention of it reminded him of fiendfyre in the Room of Hidden Things and how he almost died it in. And how Crabbe did indeed died in it.
Draco nodded and Harry slipped under the blanket. He lied on his side and pulled the blond closer to himself, spooning him from behind. He pushed one of his arms under Draco’s neck and wrapped the other one around his body. Draco’s skin was so cold that a shiver ran even through Harry.
Did he even thank Harry? He might be a prick and a death eater, but he had manners. He will thank him when they talk later.
"No, but he has to realize the ritual has started and is going on and we have already taken his ability to feel the warmth out of the picture with the fire protection spells. So I wouldn’t risk both sight and hearing but to restrict only one of them would be alright."
"I don’t know Harry, even my heart is damaged... Healers said it’s just question of time before it fails. But that was already in September, so who knows? They could be wrong." Draco mumbles and looks down into his cup of coffee. Both of them seemed to be so eager for the coffee before but now, neither of them has touched their cups.
"Yes, but you were scared and crying, I don’t know the details but Voldemort was blackmailing you, using you and there was nobody to help you. And me, all I wanted was to prove that you are a death eater and catch you. I could see you were struggling but I couldn’t look past my grudges and help you. No, instead I went around spying on you and ended up almost killing you."
He approached the girls who were watching the whole interaction between him and Draco and chuckled. "Are you two ready?"
"But the boy has been living with Death Eaters for two years! He could have useful information, we have to question him!" Robards exclaimed and if Harry didn’t have full arms of Draco Malfoy, he would probably cast crucio on that idiot.
"Other then our little meeting in the Room of Hidden things, I was just trying to blend into the background during the battle, so no, I didn’t get hurt, And if I did how is it even any of your business? " Draco snapped.
"But how did you do it?" Hermione asks. "I can’t do any progress besides making it silver and a bit pointy."
"You were so beautiful doing that spell little prince. Absolutely stunning." Harry whispered against his neck and it send shivers down Draco’s spine. Then Harry took Draco hand, looking at the cut on his palm and kissed it. Draco felt the familiar warmth of Harry’s healing spell flow into his hand and when Harry let go the cut was gone without a trace of ever being there.
He always admired the Gryffindor, felt almost magnetic pull towards him, wanted to be his friend. Circe, if he didn’t butcher his introduction back in the first year, they might have been friends but he wanted to impress him so much he went overboard. When he failed to become Harry's friend, Draco settled for trying to catch his attention, even if it meant insulting him and his friends. He would do anything to have Harry’s eyes on him.
Hermione sighed but smiled. She felt like huge weight fell of her shoulders, she had crush on Ron ever since she first saw him in the Hogwarts express but maybe that is all it was. A childhood crush, something that was not meant to be.
Next to me Hermione looks like she wants to start writing down notes. Good, the sooner she starts getting familiar with the Dark Arts the better. Who knows when exactly we will encounter Voldemort and he is not picky about which magic he uses either.
"I don’t know what I would do without meeting you in the Diagon Alley. You are my first friend Draco."
"Don’t you corrupt the little me! " Hermione exclaims, pretending to be horrified and then also laughs.
Draco felt Harry tensing and then liquid heat was spilling down his throat, Draco closed his eyes as he swallowed everything. He continued to suck gently until all the aftershocks of Harry’s orgasm subsided. Then Draco pulled of and his eyes fluttered anxiously over Harry’s face. "Did I do okay? Did you like it?" he bit his lip, fear and hope tangling inside him.
Draco only now realized they weren’t in the room alone and hastily moved away from Harry’s lap, he scanned the room for a place to hide away from the girls but there wasn’t any and the two of them were blocking the door. So he stayed sitting next to Harry, who placed a hand on the small of his back as if to say that it’s okay and he will take care of this.
"How could you be hiding fucking Malfoy in your house and not tell me? I thought we were friends, Harry!" said Ron annoyed.
– it can be used while fighting to cut your opponent but it is also used by healers during surgeries. On the other hand,
"Fuck, I didn’t expect the trials to start so quickly, what are the accusations?" Harry asked, frowning.
"You just don’t know it. I can’t tell you, I just can’t… But, I could let you see my memories, then you would understand. Then you would know not to lose your time with me." Draco said weakly.
"I don’t keep up any occlumency shields around you anymore. Go on," Draco said softly, full of trust.
Soon they arrived at Snape’s quarters, the door was protected by a password, but Harry knew it from Draco. Snape’s office and laboratory were total chaos, as far as Harry was concerned, there wasn’t any system in where what lied.
I used to be so concerned about my appearance, I was good looking proud pure blood from noble family. Now none of it mattered, nobody cared about my family, those who did were all dead. And we had no time to mourn the countless dead. Weasleys, Greengrasses, Boneses, Bagshots, Aldertons, Nettles… and so many other families, completely wiped out. And that’s just wizards, if we were to talk about dead muggles the numbers would be in millions. So cruel was the reign of Voldemort.
"On the shelf you can see our House Cups, we have a six-year streak winning, even though Dumbledore clearly favours Gryffindor. We do not tolerate slacking, everybody works to bring in as many points as they can. Learn the rules so you can break and bend them and not be caught. If you need help with anything, ask. We take care of our own. If you don’t have any questions, go to your rooms and sleep. You have a big day ahead of yourselves with lessons starting tomorrow. We are your second family now, make us proud."
"Silencio! Stupefy!" casted Harry wandless. "I said that’s enough, Ron." Harry sighed and looked at crying Hermione. The witch was shaking and hugging her thin frame, Harry wished he shut up Ron faster, so she didn’t have to hear all this nonsense. Harry hugged her while she sobbed.
"I see, I’m good but Draco is not doing that well, he is quite seriously sick. Actually, that’s why I’m here, I going to need your help."
"You should have let him kill me, " Draco whispered. "Why did you save me anyway? Why did you save me back then in the Room of hidden things? Why couldn't you just let my father finish me off?" he demanded, angry.
"No, thank you, Mr. Ollivander. I’m nothing like my father." I say and he is surprised. Probably doesn’t get many people refusing to try his wands. I hope I didn’t offend him, I didn’t mean to.
"I can’t do it. Not anymore. Not for him." Ginny whispered between sobs. "I would mess up. I’m sorry."
"Let me see your thoughts, your memories. Let me in." Harry was watching Draco with concern in his eyes. He needed to know, needed to be sure this is alright.
But then he felt Harry’s strong arms around himself, holding him tight, it was the only thing that could have made him feel better and it did. It seemed Harry always knew how to make Draco feel better. Draco hesitantly returned the hug and Harry shifted him onto his lap. Draco buried his face into Harry’s neck, his eyes still closed, drinking in Harry’s smell. He smelled like forest, moss and wilderness and Draco was quickly becoming addicted to it.
I have a plan of course, how to get him away from his lovely family but there are many things I need to set it motion for that - like capturing a rat, getting justice for one prisoner and getting my parents on a same page, so that they would support said prisoner. Because I’m not sure Dumbledore would, after all, he never showed much interest in the case of Sirius Black.
Draco woke up comfortable and warm. He was snuggled up against Harry’s chest and Harry’s strong arms were wrapped around him. There was still a bit of dull ache in his limbs but he felt so much better than a few days ago. He wasn’t even tired anymore. The last time he woke up he felt exhausted and his head hurt and…. oh fuck.
Harry reached out and took Draco’s hand to his lips, kissing his knuckles. Then he wrapped his arms around the blond, kept him against his chest and continued to tenderly rub circles on his back.
"Okay, can I be honest with you guys?" I sit on one of the desks and let my expression show that what I’m going to talk about is quite serious. "It’s about Quirell and his turban."
"Maybe Harry just doesn’t want you to embarrass yourself any further in front of me and Hermione, Weaslette." Draco said and lifted one of his eyebrows.
"Wait, when I heard you fall down that was it, you fell because of a cramp, wasn’t it so?" Harry asked and Draco nodded. "You said that the spasms happen when body is under stress but you just walked from bedroom to the kitchen. And Kreacher said you look in pain all the time. Tell me the truth."
This time, only one black silken scarf appeared, covering his eyes and securing itself at the back of Draco’s head. The blond’s breathing got a little agitated but Harry’s hand cupping his face was grounding him.
"Boys, I’ve never seen first years flying like this!" Madame Hooch exclaims. "You should both join your House’s quidditch team."
"Oh." Draco wanted to forget yesterday’s events. In fact, he was doing rather good job of it. But now he remembered, getting shouted at and beaten by Weasel, passing out in the bath, Harry finding him, helping him, seeing him naked. Draco blushed and realized he was still naked under the blanket.
"I don’t want to stop." Draco whispered, leaned in and licked his member’s underside in one excruciatingly slow motion, making Harry moan loudly.
Harry moved to stand in front of Draco, to shield him from any spell Ginny could send. Hermione only watched the whole scene unfolding in front of her, knowing it wasn’t her place to meddle in this.
When he was younger, he didn’t realize that his admiration might be more then just that. He would watch Harry’s unruly hair, imagine touching it but he thought nothing of that. He would be staring into Harry's eyes, thinking they are the most perfect shade of emerald green and not worry about what it meant.
I steer them to the back of the classroom so we would be as far away from Quirell as possible. In other classes, we usually sit in the front and Hermione gives me questioning look but doesn’t protest.
Draco turned around on the bed, ignoring the jolt of pain through his spine, feeling with his hands around the place where Harry slept last night. It was cold now, Harry always woke up earlier then him and somehow managed to leave the bed without alerting him. Draco usually woke up with slightest sound but with Harry next to him, he slept much better. He wished Harry stayed or woke him up as well but maybe that would have been awkward.
"I'm so sorry Draco, I wish I was faster, we wouldn't have won this war without your mother and I wish I could have repaid her debt. She didn't deserve such an end."
"Yes, Draco. Friends. I can’t promise nothing bad will ever happen again but I take care of my friends and I will do my best to protect you. Now let’s heal those bruises. " Harry said. He placed his palm gently over Draco’s bruised skin making the blond gasp.
"Hermione is right. Absolutely brilliant. The windows look much better then before. They are bigger, aren’t they?" Harry inquired with a smile.
Draco nodded, his hands gripping the sheets. He was lost in the sensation of Harry’s hand moving on his cock but he kept his eyes fixed on Harry. Harry’s other hand was exploring his body, tracing his ribs, nipples, collar bones, as if Harry wanted to memorize all of him.
"Yeah, Draco’s friend died there, Circe, we all almost died there. He is scared of fire, wouldn’t even go close to the fireplace when he was freezing." Harry sighed.
Draco knew there was somebody talking to him but he couldn’t quite make the words that person was saying. He looked up but his vision was blurry, he was feeling light-headed and he couldn't see through the tears. Where was he?
That took a lot. He had grown up with the idea that Malfoy's did not apologize, it was below them. But here he was, saying sorry to Hermione Granger, a muggle born. His father would have had a field day.
Neville's was the worst, it made Slughorn age, and no one could figure out what he did wrong. And they started the next potion, Veritaserum.  This one they would need to be partnered for, and Ron immediately joined Hermione. So Harry looked around, everyone else was paring up, but he felt like he should pair with Malfoy. He didn't know why exactly, but he felt like he needed to.
Then McGonagall silenced the room. "A few start of term announcements," her voice rang across the squirming body of students that could barely wait for the feast. "The Forbidden Forest is, as always, forbidden," she paused and looked at Harry, Ron, and Hermione, a smile playing on her lips, "for all students unless escorted by a professor or myself. I would also like to tell all the 8th years to wait for me after the feast to escort them to their dorms. Draco dormiens nunquam titillandus, never tickle a sleeping dragon, you may not like the outcome. Let the feast, BEGIN!" She boomed and the golden plates magically filled with many meats, vegetables, and desserts. It never stopped amazing Harry every time they filled on their own, even though he knew it was just the house elves in the kitchens. Harry immediately thought of Dobby, and smiled sadly.
Because Harry was right there. Harry wanted him. Harry would not forget him. Harry would never leave him.
"It's that he's being quiet, and keeping to himself, which is very un-Malfoy like, and abnormal, and you want things to be normal." Of course Luna knew exactly what he wanted to say, she was Luna after all.
But, as long as they were humming, Draco didn't care who it was. Nothing mattered at that moment. Everything was peaceful. He was calm.
Harry was about to ask Draco to continue the story, when Draco took out his wand and said a small charm that put up his hair in what the muggles called a Man-Bun. Looking at Draco wand made Harry remember something. The wand Draco was using wasn't his actual wand! Harry gasped, mumbled how he'd be right back and sped off.
Harry was glad he didn't ask questions, he didn't want to explain what was going om. Nor did he want to tell Draco that his happy place was with him. He hadn't sorted out all his feelings yet, and really wasn't ready to disclose any information just yet. When he knew what was going on with his heart, maybe then he'd tell Draco of his new happy place
He watched flowers span through their lives in a matter of seconds, but that was normal. Lives go by so quickly. But that was life.
"Do what?" Harry asked, he had almost forgotten what they were talking about when he had to chastise his mind for calling any part of Draco beautiful, even if it was true.
Draco really didn't want anyone else there, just Harry. He wanted to be alone with Harry, and he wasn't sure how to feel about that. But he wanted to know something first, it was eating away at his brain. "Why would you help me?" He said in a small voice.
"Well, I can check for internal problems easy enough, and I'll grab some ice for his face. Do you know who did this?" She asked and Harry shook his head. He silently cursed himself for not writing down all the names that had been there. He could be so stupid. "Well." She sighed and her wand started to emit a dull yellow light. She hovered over Draco's abdomen and the light turned purple. "Broken ribs. I'll get something to heal those up." She briskly walked off and returned with another vial and an ice pack. "Here. I'll check in on you in a few minutes. I assume you'll be staying, Mr.Potter?" Harry just nodded.
"Many people get lost in their head. I sometimes do it too. Did Pansy not like her boyfriend not paying attention to her every second?" Harry said. The way he mentioned Draco's relationship with Pansy almost seemed sour. Or was Draco just imaging it?
Of course it was a little awkward, they had only been on good terms for a week and a half. Draco sat next to him, hoping the awkwardness went away soon.
"Of course not, you need to be babysat at all times. Who knows what you would get into on your own. Crazy things like killing teachers and basilisks." Draco offered in a factual tone. Harry rolled his eyes but smiled.
So he had is own opinions, but he never went against his father, because he was a Malfoy, and in his fathers mind that meant something different than in Draco's mind. In his fathers mind it meant he was better, stronger, smarter, and over all worth more than the people around him.
In. Out. In. Out. In... Out. He commanded his lungs. He willed his heart to slow. He closed his eyes and tried going to his happy place, but it just wasn't the same. Why did his happy place feel different? Why did it feel like it was missing something? Everything was the same it had always been. Lake behind him. Trees below. Mountains in the distance. Him on his broom, alone in the vast sky.
He hated Harry, until now. Hate was the only thing that existed between them. Draco had not been pushing down a crush for seven years.
The worst part about worrying and nervousness was the anxiety it stemmed from. Draco had suffered anxiety since 4th year, when Voldemort had truly returned. He just never mentioned it. Never talked about the sleepless nights, the nail biting, the ever present pit in his stomach. He didn't want to seem weak, he was a Malfoy, and Malfoy's are not weak.
"No need when I can find you easily enough on the Map." He said walking over to Draco. "You know, Hermione isn't allowed in the kitchens anymore. She started to try to talk to the elves about freedom, and they kicked her out. She even when as far as place hats and scarves around the Gryffindor common room. Then the elves stopped cleaning our dorms. Only one did, I believe you knew Dobby." Harry said returning Draco's small smile. He looked as if he was about tell Draco a story.
He was breathing slowly, and had a peaceful look about him. Draco figured it was best to let him sleep, so he ate and read in silence.
That had been difficult, since he wasn't exactly friends with Potter and most of the time couldn't get close enough to hear without being noticed. But Draco had his ways, and thus, he learned everything he could about The Boy Who Lived. Which was really interesting, because sometimes he would mention something under his breath about Potter, and no one knew how Draco knew.
Granted he hadn't bullied many people, only those near Ever Perfect Potter. That had been his job, more or less. During the first 4 years, it had been to keep an eye on him. After that, it was to watch him. Learn everything he could about him. Memorize his schedule. Know who he talked to, when he talked to them, and what the conversation was about.
Weird. He had never noticed. What else had he never noticed about the people around him. He suddenly felt horrible for always being up in his own head. What other important relationships had he not noticed, or facts about people he claimed to care about. He started to feel worse, and by the time dinner came, he was at an all time low. He quickly ate something and rushed to his bed, he wanted the day to end, to stop in it's tracks, to just leave him alone. He sat breathing heavily on his bed and laid down. He hated himself. Hated everything that he did. Hated the way people looked at him. Hated everything that had to do with him. He hated himself. And he fell asleep hating himself.
"Does it only open to that? Or can you just say something along those lines?" Draco asked as Harry searched for Filtch's name.
He sat down on his bed and sighed. He laid back and threw his right forearm over his eyes but his glasses got in the way. He took off his glasses and set them aside. Harry was really exhausted, all he wanted to do was sleep, and slowly he faded into uneasy slumber. A dream about fireplaces and sketch pads met him as he slept.
Funny, Draco thought, Slytherins guys must have a thing for Gryffindors. Not that he'd ever say so. He'd give himself away, and Pansy loved saying 'I told you so'.
"Despite popular belief, me and Pansy never really dated. We just pretended. Our parents wanted us to date, so we kept up the lie that we were. She's not really my type." Not many people knew that he had never dated Pansy. Telling Harry this felt good though, clearing up Draco's past. Because that's what friends do.
"Harry?" Once again, Hermione broke him out of his thoughts. "Do you want to talk about something?" She said softly, knowing Harry's mind had been wondering.
"You went through my things?" Draco said accusingly. He really didn't care, but why not tease? "Did you go through my drawings as well." That he did care about.
"Very insane." Was all Harry said. And the rest of the class was spent in a comfortable silence, just like their mornings.
High-pitched and terrible. They made his blood curdle. He knew that Bellatrix was hurting her, someone innocent. Someone brilliant, with a bright future.
But now, the things that once brought Draco so much wonder, felt dark and distant. Somewhere between that day, and a year ago, when he had last star gazed, he had lost the childlike fascination of them.
So just like the day before, he grabbed his sketch book and made his way silently to the common room. He almost felt disappointment that Potter wasn't there to accompany his silence, but quickly shook the thoughts from his head.
Then he looked down at himself and froze. He wore his Hogwarts uniform, but a dark stain was spreading from his stomach. It crept up his shirt and he felt it. Warm and sticky. Blood. The world threatened to turn dark, how had he not felt himself bleeding before? What had happened? He looked up to lion for help, not knowing how this lion could do anything.
He turned around ready to walk away if it was someone else wanting to tell him he should be rotting away in Azkaban like his father, but it was only Professor Clawford.
"Harry?" Hermione inquired. Harry pulled his eyes from Draco, who was sitting next to Pansy and Blaise.
They walked down the hall quietly. As they reached the Gryffindor room, Harry left and opened the door. He left a small crack and Draco's eyes were assaulted by shades of red and orange that seemed to bright for anyone to sleep with.
Draco nearly jumped out of his skin. His heart kick started and he tightly closed his eyes. "Blood fuck Potter! What the fuck? How did- You have an Invisibility Cloak?!" Draco said now seeing the cloak Harry was folding neatly by him. "Of course you do." Draco sighed and placed a hand over his heart, which hadn't calmed down yet.
"Half past one. Most classes have let out, you're lucky none of the Slytherins have returned. Would have been hard to explain why my nemesis was sleeping on by bed."
But he though about is seriously. Sure he had his little fit of gay panic before, but he didn't really accept it until the end or the school year. "After." He answered honestly. Then he gave a small laugh.
Today was going to be better than yesterday, Harry was sure of it. Because he would be able to spend the entire day with Draco Malfoy, and that made his heart leap out of his chest.
4th year. The Triwizard Tournament. The year Voldemort returned. The year Cedric died. Why had Draco started drawing that year? What happened? Had he just wanted to try something new? Something told Harry that it was bigger than that. Why would Draco start drawing. Voldemort was risen, and Death Eaters started to organize again. Death Eaters like Lucius Malfoy. Had Draco start drawing to put his mind at ease when his father disappeared? Was it the stress, fear for is father, of his father.
Traitor. Death Eater. Murder. Bastard. Evil. Abomination. Shit. Whore. Less. Useless. Unwanted. Disappointment. Unloved. Not Worth It. Just Like His Father.
A Tripping Hex, then after he got up, a Swollen Tongue charm, that made is tongue swell into the size of a golf ball. He then walked to the hospital wing and got it fixed.
Draco suddenly had something to draw, something new, and he leaned slightly forward, looked at Potter for a moment and began to mark the blank page.
Draco had gotten out to the common room a few minutes earlier than Potter. Potter then walked in, sat down in a new spot, and Draco drew him.
"Only when I'm sleep deprived. How about you? You didn't even hesitate to 'flirt' back. Is Dray gay?" Harry teased. Draco heart sunk. He could tell him, should tell him, get it out there.
He continued Draco-Watching, while slowly eating his small dinner. At least he was eating. Over the summer he had sometimes forgotten to eat. Food just never seemed that important. Just as he was finishing his pumpkin juice, Draco stood up and walked out of the Great Hall. He got to his feet and walked as slow as he could make himself. He didn't want to draw too much attention to himself. Hermione was one thing, but if anyone else put it together, it wouldn't be good.
"A muggle thing. It's like wizard pictures, except they tell a story. I guess if you were to ask the painting to do a play for you. But can't talk to it, umm, it's like a book, but with visual elements." He explained. This was basically what Hermione had told Ron when he had asked.
"Oh, I was just wondering if I could see that book." She pointed to the book Draco had pulled out just in case he needed it for his essay.
He drew strands halfway shining with firelight, other just seemed to be black lines in the light. But this was exactly what Potters hair looked like. As if someone had came by and placed each tuft of hair in opposing directions.
Draco sighed and slammed his head on the table. His life was a mess and now Pansy had been right. Draco wondered if he'd ever be normal. But probably not, he was a Malfoy.
On this, Harry actually did think they should be a all together. Unity. Hadn't everyone lost people during the war? And everyone returning would have known each other for 7 years, they had lost friends together. Why not be there for each other? They could all understand what they had gone through because they did it together. Or at least that's what the muggle counselor had said.
These thoughts haunted Harry as he lay awake in his bed. He couldn't sleep, his mind getting closer and closer to and edge Harry didn't like. His thoughts betrayed him, they made him hurt. But they wouldn't go away. No matter how hard he tried to clear his mind, they persisted.
Draco placed his hand on Harry's. Harry's heart stopped. The physical contact stilling all that was running through Harry's mind. The world seemed to still. Fire spread from his hand to his chest, shoving the weight off his chest. His lungs filled easily, no longer fighting.
So he sat in the common room in silence, with Draco Malfoy, off in his happy place, felling like he could never escape.
As she sat down Malfoy sneered, "Need my expertise Potter? We know you'd probably fail this one worse than Longbottom will." But Harry turn to him with the tired expression that he had been trying to hide all day.
When the sorting was finally over, Harry's throat felt soar, but he felt a twinge of happiness. He had brought the school closer, and that meant, maybe, this year would be better than his first, and that was all he could hope for.
"Oh." He tried to think of a way to explain it, without mentioning the his mornings. "Well, I've noticed something that I don't really like, about someone, and I just wanted someone to talk it out to, you know, so I can work it out." He said throwing words together, hoping they made sense.
A small fire was lit, casting orange colors and dark shadows around the room. Harry felt like throwing up as the flames waved and licked the air. He tried to find something else to focus on, anything else.
It was almost like he could already hear the laughter. The teasing. The whispers. He could feel the stares.
His fault, because he was Harry Fucking Potter. He didn't deserve to be praised, he should be shunned, left alone to die forgotten. Yet people wanted his autograph, wanted to talk to him. When those who died would never talk again. He felt alone, so very alone in his own mind. Lonely and trapped. There was no escape, no way to get fresh air, no way to leave his thoughts behind. And he got claustrophobic in his own head. The way the thoughts seemed to press in on him from all sides. He knew there was no way to let them out. No way to stop them, and he felt he couldn't breath.
Draco flipped through pages of Harry. Not only had he drawn him in the morning, but most of the sketches are Harry doing different things. In class. At lunch. In the court yard. Talking with friends.
She had just turned away when Draco thought of something. "Wait, Granger!" He stood up and picked at his already short finer nails. Was he really going to do this?
Professor Clawford had been the second person to treat Draco like a person, Harry Potter was the first. The he felt like he wanted to cry again, so he quickly made his way to his dorm.
Within 10 seconds, Harry Potter had changed the school again. Of course he did. It was Harry Fucking Potter, the savior. He was perfect in every way, everyone was falling over themselves to listen to him.
"I was picturing what life as a Slytherin would have been like. Horrible if you ask me." Harry said. Technically he wasn't lying, but maybe that last thought wasn't that horrible? Maybe his brain had meant best friends? It was probably the lack of sleep getting to him, messing with his brain. "I was almost sorted into Slytherin." Harry said casually. He wanted to get his mind off of whatever it was going on about.
He saw it, all he had to do was wait for the stairs to connect, though waiting was nearly killing him. When he was able to, the ran to where he had seen Draco's name surrounded by at least ten others. When he turned to corner, his stomach dropped, Draco wasn't there. Where was he? Thankfully Harry had shoved the Map into his pocket without closing it. He scanned the Map, then saw Draco's name in a bathroom a little ways behind Harry. He turned quickly and rushed down the hall. He saw that Draco was alone this time, and almost didn't want to open the door.
Of course he had always been 2nd in grades, only under Granger, but now he didn't feel like being above everyone else, he just wanted to be average. He also had no reason to try that hard, no one was breathing down his back to be perfect, and that was one of the only good things that would come out of this year.
The day for Harry once again consisted of him watching Draco when ever possible. He looked at Draco in DADA, at lunch, and when he passes by him in the common room after classes. He wanted to talk with him, like he did that morning. Talk about easy things. Simpler times. This morning was the best morning he'd had in while. The easy smiles were the best part. He felt like he didn't have to pretend he was okay.
She walked to the potions cupboard and stored the vials quickly. She glanced over at Draco, seeing the open sketch pad in his hands. She gave a knowing smile and stepped into her office, shutting the door behind her.
"Really? The muggles who raised you never told you?" But he was Harry Potter. "What did they do when you started showing accidental magic?" How had they kept it from him?
Why did things keep getting worse? Why was everything Harry had every felt weighing down on him suddenly? Why can't he be happy? Why can't he let go of the small things? Why was he such a failure? Why did people have to die for him? Why did he have to be the Chosen one?
He looked into Draco's eyes, and only saw a blank face. His eyes glossed over, and he looked almost bored. Blood had started to pull again around the cuts. Thank God there were only two. He again cleaned it away, and produced bandages from his wand. He was glad he knew how to do that, he couldn't stand not being able to help. He wrapped Draco's arm and looked again into his eyes. And again Draco's eyes glossed over. Harry looked at him silently for a few minutes, then sighed. He moved to Draco's left and sat down next to him. He still held his arm with is hand, and they sat in silence.
His mind drifted to Malfoy, and how he had said they were both insane. Of course it was true, Harry agreed with it, and they had both been in under the effect of a very effective Veritaserum. Harry almost laughed at the similarities between the two boys. Even though he thought them to be very different, it was Malfoy for goodness sake. A uptight rich prat who had daddy issues. But Harry knew there was more to Malfoy than that, but he also knew that knowing that was a dangerous path, he could end up friends with the brat. The brat that had been nothing but mean to his friends for years. He had constantly harassed them and belittled them, he was mean and conceded.
And he was the one screaming. In fear, in pain, in panic. His skin so cold it burned, arms numb, legs aching, mind searching for something, for why, how…
Then he heard the door open and his heart started to race. Who was there? What were they doing here?
Even on Saturday and Sunday, they sat in silence before the sun rose, before others had even dared to stir in their beds, they sat. Harry always seemed to find a new sitting position, and Malfoy always seemed to be drawing something. Sure Harry was intrigued, but he didn't want to ruin this time he had to himself. No unwanted questions, no talking, no pretending to care. Only silence.
Thankfully, Draco moved on, appearing to not even notice him. Harry didn't want people to know just yet, not because he felt ashamed, but because it was more precious when it was in secret. It felt more his. He didn't really know how to explain exactly what he was feeling, even to himself. He also knew Ron would throw a fit. He loved Ron and all, but he could be over the top sometimes.
He didn't know why, but the other boy just always seemed to loom near his thoughts, and he didn't like it. Why would he be thinking of Harry Fucking Potter on is own free time?
"Well, you're already here, and I have noting to do. It's fine if you stay I guess." Draco looked away and Harry sat back down
Draco turned quickly and jumped a little. When he saw it was Harry a small smile danced on his lips. "Hello." He said formally. But that was just how Draco talked.
"No need to talk. We probably work best in silence anyway." It wasn't exactly what Harry meant, but he figured Malfoy understood. And they worked in silence for the rest of the class, only talking when absolutely necessary. Then class was dismissed, since Veritaserum needed to sit over night for potency. Harry joined Ron and Hermione, who were talking about their classes after lunch.
He quickly got dressed and headed it the new 8th year common room. He didn't feel like waking Ron, but also didn't want to sit and listen to his snoring. Honestly, you'd think he'd learn to put a silencing charm on his bed by now. But that was Ron, and no one else seemed to mind. And sometimes Neville's snoring was bad too.
"Do you want breakfast? I can call a house elf." Draco offered. Besides, he should eat too, Pansy had told him to anyways.
And they didn't for a long time. They sat and watched the stars appear. Harry holding on to Draco's hand, because he knew, as soon as he let go, the day would approach him again. But maybe, if he held on long enough, he'd have the strength to make it.
The size of the fireplace made Potter seem tinier than he really was, but Draco liked it like that. It seemed to emphasizing that the Savior of the Wizarding World was still young.
Soon enough though, he had to leave. Ron was bound to wake up and worry, so he better be there so he didn't fuss. He felt empty as he left the common room. He felt empty the rest of the day. Even though he only had one class, he felt so drained he got to his dorm and sat there for hours, while Ron tried to engage him into meaning less conversations. Eventually Ron gave up and went to find Hermione. Harry wasn't bothered much by this, it gave him one less thing to worry about. He ended up leaving as Dean and Seamus walked in and started talking. He wasn't mad though, he just left them be. Though he could have sworn he had seen it, from the corner of his eye, Dean had been holding Seamus's hand.
"Oi! Malfoy! I saw your swan dive this morning! I give it and 8 out of 10. It would be perfect if you had landed on your face." The Weasel said laughing at Draco.
"Pacing that fast isn't going to help." Draco whipped around to see who dared to interrupt his internal screaming when he saw Potter standing there, a meter away.
Someone was humming a song he had never heard before. It was sweet, and soft, and filled Draco with peace.
But he turned and saw Harry. He couldn't help but smile. "Following me?" He teased. The elves had surrounded Harry. They had two guests, what a lovely morning,
The leader of the group, a Gryffindor he didn't recognize, walked up and smirked down at him. "Scared Malfoy?"
"That's not! No, that's... that's not... w-what I..." Harry sighed and buried his head in his hands. Draco gave a small smile, seeing Harry flustered was pay back for being scared.
It was a quarter past one. Draco hadn't felt like they had been out for and hour and some odd minuets, but he had zoned out a couple of times.
Alone. That was what was wrong. Alone wasn't were he felt calm anymore. It was with Draco. When he was with Draco he was calm, happy, and like he was going to be okay. With Draco, Harry felt cared for. That was what Harry needed in his life. That was what Harry needed in his Happy place.
Draco ran his fingers threw his own hair and flipped it to one side. Draco wondered what was going though The Chosen Ones head that allowed him to sit still for almost 30 minuets. Draco could barely sit still for 5 if he had nothing to fidget with. But it didn't matter.
He sighed the parchment at the bottom right corner and closed the sketch pad. He looked around the room, it felt emptier than before Potter had shown up. He swung his legs down and was about to stand up when he thought of something.
He loved him, because he was his father, but he couldn't forgive him. His father was the reason he was so hated, because from a young age, Draco had been groomed to be a Death Eater. From the moment he was born, his father tried to ingrain in him is own ideals, and it had worked. Until he got to Hogwarts, and the illusion shattered.
Please, do not read if this is a sensitive topic to you, I don't want to be the cause of any panic or anxiety attacks.
Harry went to bed round 10, not wanting to stay up any longer. He knew that tonight, he would get a peaceful sleep like he had done the night before, especially with the promise that Draco would  be there in the morning.  Unlike this morning, when he had still been in the Hospital Wing. Even though Harry hadn't woken up from a nightmare, he had still found himself up before everyone else.
"About an hour and a half." Harry nodded, that wasn't that long if he thought about it. "So, are we going to skip classes today? What to you say, want to join me in the male Snake Pit?" Draco gave a smile. It was almost as big as the one he had had in Harry's happy place.
"Well duh, but, like, what's the plot line?" Harry said rolling his eyes and biting down into his sandwich.
This was the last time he'd step off this train onto the grounds. He had already decided he wouldn't go home for Christmas, it was always lonely now that no one visited. Not that those who visited before had been welcomed guests. Or guests at all.
"Only to you, everyone else loves me." Harry said, wanting to get his mind off of Draco's hair. Harry wasn't gay, he had liked girls before. Sure it was only two, but he also had never like any guy before. Sleep deprivation can do wonders to a person.
That was really the first time someone had treated him like a person that day. And he felt his eyes start to water.
"Yeah. I don't know. Honestly, I don't know why I noticed. I have so much in my mind, Malfoy should be the least of my worries, yet here I am, getting sidetracked by Malfoy. It's like 6th year all over again." Harry buried his head in his hands. 6th year had been a mess, he hated the fact it felt like 6th year all over again.
As they silently walked down a dark corridor, Harry check the Map. He saw nothing and they reached the Hospital.
"Really? That's boring. Why didn't you ask something a bit more interesting? Seriously mate, You could have really learned a lot." Ron continued, Harry got more agitated. Why did Ron want to know anyway? Malfoy wasn't important, he was no one. To Ron at least.
Draco was sure it was implying Harry would come back, but what if it wasn't? What else could it have meant. Thinking of the wink gave Draco's stomach butterflies. He didn't like that reaction.
Draco hoped Harry could make it through the year, things were a lot more pleasant when Harry was there.
"I have perfect posture, I can assure you. The finest teachers in the world taught me. Do you doubt them?" Draco shot back. This banter was relaxed, fun, calming.
Slughorn welcomed them and explained the lesson for the day, "We're going to review two potions we had already made, just to see where you all stand. I hope this is a relaxed lesson, we don't need to overwork you all on the first day back. The first potion is a low level Beautification potion. The ingredients can be found on page 298 of your textbook. At the end of the hour, I will be testing the potion on myself. I hope you lot don't kill me." He chuckled, and everyone started gathering ingredients.
"As long as we don't get caught, I don't care. Honestly, I don't want detention this early on in the year." Draco said as he got off the bed and ran his hand through his hair again. He'd been doing that all night, and it made Harry angry. Right after it made his heart flutter, he really wished Draco would stop doing that.
Blaise looked up and grinned, "Moved on from me already?" He joked. Draco and Blaise had never dated, but Blaise was the first guy Draco had made-out with.
He barely remembered to grab his glasses as he staggered out of his dorm and down the hallway to the common room. If he could think properly, he would be glad there were no stairs, he would have fallen down them.
Draco sighed and ran his hand through his hair. He caught sight of his flowers. They were a green teal colour. He had read that green meant awkward, and teal meant tired.
And McGonagall read the first name, and one by one, everyone was sorted. Everything was the same. Except, now when any house was called, everyone applauded.
Draco half expected her to walk away, or laugh at him, instead she smiled. "I don't know why, but I'm going to have to believe you. Thank you." He let out a sigh or relief, and offered her a small smile in return. "3rd year you say? Was that before or after I punched you?" She joked.
But there was something about Potter being quiet that intrigued Draco. Something about Potter being up this early. Maybe he had gotten tired of all the snoring that came from his room. Last night Draco could hear it through the walls, and then finally someone had put a silencing charm on the room.
Draco Malfoys dreams, as always, were filled with flashed of viper green light, and screams. But at least he was able to sleep that night. Sleep without resting, that is.
The thin scars on his Mark was the only thing he liked about himself. Those scars. The ones he had put on himself. They were his doing. Not his fathers. His. They made him feel like himself.
It's okay. I'm here. It said warmly. It gave him something to hold onto. I understand. It called into the darkness that engulfed Harry's heart. It shoved a sense of calm into his head. It did it's job, because Harry could feel the day leave him. It slipped away, moving from the warmth that was covering Harry's body.
Hermione finished first and sat looking pleased with herself. Harry's potion turned out the right color, and he felt proud he could make something right. A few minutes after Harry finished, Seamus's potion, as always, exploded. He looked more mildly inconvenienced by it than shocked. Dean, who had just finished himself, laughed and helped him clean it up. Dean, who towered over Seamus by at least a foot, ran his hand through Seamus's hair to help get the soot out, and Seamus hit his hand away.
"You have a map of the castle that shows where everyone is at all times?!" Harry turned toward Draco and and gave a small shrug. "What? How on earth did you get that?!" Draco asked trowing his hands in the air. "Of course Harry Fucking Potter as a magical map of the school, why wouldn't he." He added under his breath.
"It comes naturally towards you, you're really easy to dislike." Draco said running his hand through his hair unconsciously. The bun he had put it in fell away, and Harry's heart seemed to want to stop. It had parted to the side and fell like a silk curtain around his face.
Then they heard the shifting of blankets and the sound of someone getting out of bed. Probably Nott, Blaise made a lot of noise in the morning. Draco swiftly closed the curtains to his bed and held a finger to his lips, telling Harry to stay quiet.
Harry looked at him for a while. The silence, which usually was comfortable, turned awkward. Draco was about to leave, when Harry spoke softly.
Before he really knew what he was doing, he pulled Harry into a hug. He wrapped his arms around Harry's neck and rested his forehead on Harry's shoulder.
"Do you want to go for a walk around the castle?" Harry suggested before he really thought about it. A midnight walk around the castle would clear Draco's head, and Harry's, and would get them some fresh air. But a midnight walk around the castle alone with Draco invited the thoughts Harry wanted to clear from his mind. But there was no taking it back, he had already said it.
But something was off. As Draco got closer he saw Harry's hands were clenched tightly and his jaw was locked.
Then again, Harry may or may not have been the reason he started to question his sexuality. It may or my not have been when he was riding the blasted hippogriff.
He was pacing, biting his nails, and constantly pushing his hair out of his face. He didn't know why he had let it get so long, it was too much like is fathers, but still he didn't cut it.
Harry Potter was supposed to save everyone. Harry Potter was supposed to end it. Harry Potter was the only one who stood a chance. Yet in the end, it hadn't mattered, because people died. Good people, who followed him to battle, who trusted him. They would never be able to do anything ever again, their last act was following a boy with no experience and no plan into battle with some of the most evil, cunning, and vicious people that one could find.
They welcomed him joyfully. They liked him. Even though he came everyday, they still were just as joyed when he came.
Draco was being bullied by some asshole 6th years, he really wasn't to leave but they didn't let him. He was punched in the face then kicked in the gut by the 'leader'. He stumbled into a bathroom, he felt that some of his ribs had broken. He then started to hurt himself, calling it a way to escape.
"Now, be careful on how much you take, it has sat a whole week, and is very strong. So, unless you wish to be telling the truth for a month, better not take more than a small spoon full." Slughorn warned, "Now, each of you take the potion, and ask each other a question, though if you already know the answer it isn't really that fun, now is it? Anyway, in a few minuets I'll come around and ask each pairing how they did."
He quickly found himself in a dream world. White sea foam crashed into a rocky shore and a dull afternoon light hung loosely in the air. The sea, dark blue with shades of green rising from the deep, stretched on for as far has he could see. Gulls called from above his head, and he looked to see them. He followed their winged forms to a cliff behind him. The rock wall that rose menacingly up from the sand climbed higher and higher, until it disappeared behind clouds.
"Only making fun of you. If you weren't here I couldn't make 'My Father Will Hear About This' jokes behind your back. And that's peak comedy for me." He said sitting on the other side of Draco.
They had turned into a corridor with big windows and had 'Nox'ed their wands and returned them to their robes. "Sorry. I tend to do that. Pansy used to make fun of me for it." In fact, he'd been doing this for years. He always tried avoid doing it, but sometimes he couldn't help it.
"Er, he was holding his stomach, and he got punched in the face." Harry offered, not knowing anything else. He really wanted to know what happened.
Harry walked over to Draco and looked at him, really looked at him, for the first time. Usually Harry just noticed it was Draco, and that his hair was longer, and that was it. Now Harry saw more. He saw that his hair was just brushing his shoulders, it was ungelled, but pushed back so it had no part. His cheeks and jaw line were well defined but had a soft look to them, like they had been made with clay. His nose was thin, and slightly turned upwards at the end, making it's profile unique and honestly beautiful. His eyes were focused on where Luna had been a few seconds before, their silver tint standing out more because they were red rimmed. He looked like he was going to cry.
"Yes, laughing at my pain, how very Gryffindor like of you." He sneered holding back a smile. Harry was really good at distracting him. He felt himself relax more. Everything was clam, okay, in that moment.
"His favourite colour." Harry was glad he had only taken a little Veritaserum, other wise he might tell Ron about his secret mornings.
As he feel asleep, he continued to think of the comforting silence and the strange array of emotions that seemed to accompany Draco in his mind. They seemed oddly familiar, but still remained a stranger to him. He tried his best to ignore them, because he didn't like how they intruded in on the calm that engulfed him around Draco.
Harry immediately tensed up and his next breath let no air in. “Hey, Harry, Harry, it’s okay, hey, calm down, it’s okay.” Draco said, tring to get him to stop panicking. “Harry,” Draco gently cupped Harry’s cheeks and tilted his head up. “Hey, breath, just breath, okay, in…” Draco breathed in, “and out…” he breathed out. “Come on, in… out… in… out… that’s good, okay, everything is okay, just breath.” Harry’s breathing returned to a semi-normal pace and Draco pulled him into a hug.
He had seen many smiles on Potters face, because he had always been around Potter, but this one was different, new. Draco hated new.
Draco doubled over and couldn't breath, tears blurred his eyes, and could almost swear he had heard a crack. He heard the entire group laugh.
Draco was glad he had had so many years at practicing putting up facades, because if not, the surprise that she had put two and two together so quickly wouldn't have helped the situation. But denying it wouldn't help either. "You really are the brightest witch or our age." Was all he said.
He wasn't very pleased with the answer. Not that it was bad, it just didn't feel like something he should have been exited about. No, we wasn't exited about potions with Malfoy, he was exited about the silence. That was it. The silence, noting more. If there was no silence he wouldn't be able to stand being in the same room as him. But here he was, sitting in silence as Slughorn gave each pairing the Veritaserum from last week.
"Sure. Anyway, just be careful, not many people would take kindly to the Pride and Joy of Gryffindor being with the Prince of Slytherin." Blaise warned. It wasn't just their houses people would not take kindly to.
"Miss me too much Potter?" Draco said turning to him with a playful look on his face. This was the distraction he needed.
His anxiety had started to overwhelm him. He tried to calm himself down. Tried to regulate his breathing.
"Yeah. I had no idea what you were talking about. The muggles that raised me didn't ever speak of magic. They hated wizards, so I had actually never heard of Hogwarts until I got my letter." Harry gave a small laugh.
Then he'd sit Draco down and have Draco write everything a Malfoy was and wasn't how ever many times it took for his father to be pleased. Sometimes it'd take hours, but Draco wasn't allowed to move, only write.
Blaise sighed and mumbled something about early risers. Draco stifled a laugh. They weren't actually together, because Pansy had a not so small crush on a girl neither boy could figure out. But it didn't stop them from acting like a newly married couple.
It had started when the first kid was called, a thin boy with curly blonde hair and small face, was sorted in to Slytherin. At first it was only the Slytherin table that cheered, and some 8th years, then, something unusual happened. Harry Potter, the Pride and Joy of Gryffindor, stood up and cheered. Soon, his friends joined in. Then the entire Hall was cheering for this new Slytherin.
"Really mate? I'da thought you'd be against all the returning eighth years sharing dorms and classes. I mean wouldn't it be better to go to our own dorms? Try to do something normal?" Ron said a little shocked that Harry hadn't sided with him.
And in all the years he’d known Harry, only one other time had he seen him cry. Whatever had happened was bad, because the last time he cried was the day Cedric Diggory had died.
Yet here he was. At Hogwarts, with people he had betrayed. He was free from dementors, but not himself.
Draco found himself wanting the morning to come, wanting Harry Potter to walk into the common room, sit down and smile, where only Draco could see.
He had not been pushing down a crush on Harry for seven years. It was only four years thank you very much.
"Are you sure? Or are you just assuming?" Pansy said, eyeing him. She had probably heard the hurt when he said he was straight.
One of the reasons he had seen though the illusion that Malfoys were better because they were Malfoys, was his heart.
The flowers seemed to center around a single red rose in the middle of his forearm. It was perfectly shaded that it appeared real. He wanted to touch it, to see if maybe Luna had just placed a rose on him.
Harry resurfaced as the one thing on his mind keeping him from work. Harry fucking Potter. His stupid face, and stupid hair, and stupid kindness. He was hard too hate, once you got to know him, but Draco wished to anyway. If he hated Harry, he would not have to harbor a crush on him, and things could go back to normal.
"I couldn't if I wanted to. Hermione would drag me off to class." Harry said, his voice rough from un-use.
It was Harry's turn to blush. "You'll have to prove that." He shot back. Draco gave his an amused look.
He wanted to escape. The pain was the way to escape. Blood that covered his entire arm was the escape. Rows and rows of open cuts was the way to escape.
Seeing Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived Twice, so broken and haunted by the same thing he was, hurt him.
Harry was wondering where Draco was, so he check the Marauders Map in a totally non-stalker-ish way. He saw that Draco was surrounded by people, and he figured they weren't exactly friendly, so he rushes to where he saw Draco's name, and didn't see him. Thankfully he still had the Map with him, so he went to the bathroom Draco was in. He cleans up Draco's arm and bandages it. They then sit in silence.
Draco’s warm hand touched his shoulder and he collapsed into his arms. The dam broke and Harry cried.
Through out class they took notes and answered questions that she would throw in to check if everyone was paying attention. Soon the class was over, and most people headed to the 8th year common room, or their respective dorms. Hermione suggested they sit and talk about their day, she had said that it was good to talk things out, especially after a new experience.
They asked him what he thought with expectant eyes, he couldn't help but give a small smile and tell them that it was the best dinner he had ever had. They were over joyed at this and Draco found himself enjoying the elves.
"4th year." Malfoy responded in the same quiet voice. As if they feared speaking any louder would break the silence to a point of no return. "Why do you sit in a different spot everyday." Malfoy looked hesitant to ask, as if it was bigger than it was.
At first, Draco had just wanted to tear it off. But for a long time he resisted. Then one night, it was late, some would call it early, he broke. He tried to rip off the dreadful thing, but his mother came in when she heard the painful screaming.
But the only reason it did was Perfect Harry Fucking Potter and his friends. They had shown him what a load of shit is father had been dumping on him. Yet, he still followed his father almost blindly, and had never once stood up for what he became to know as true.
Throughout class, he often faded into his own mind, then his thoughts circled back to his Mark. When it did, he quickly shook himself out of it.
Harry went to sit besides Draco, placing one of his hands on the small of the blond’s back to keep both Draco and Harry himself anchored. It was just so natural for him to keep the Slytherin close, preferably within hand’s reach.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy, you are being charged with quite heinous crimes, including murder of Albus Dumbledore, murder of Narcissa Malfoy and being Death Eater, therefore torturing and killing muggleborns, muggles and serving Voldemort. How do you plead?" Griselda Marchbanks’s voice thundered through the courtroom, making everybody focus on her.
"I think this compartment is getting rather stuffy, I would kindly like to ask you to leave Ron Weasley." I say, my voice is ice and I pierce him with my eyes.
"Snape doesn’t have any family and he was close with Draco, I saw his memories and I’m sure he wouldn’t mind Hermione."
I hold out my arm for him to measure and he explains about the magical cores of wands. I know all of it and I also know what wand I want - my old wand.
"You know Harry, the fire will not burn him, there are spells for that." Hermione started to explain but then stopped when she realized what Harry meant. "It’s about the fiendfyre, isn’t it?"
Harry remained silent for a second, absorbing, processing, emotions swirling inside of him. Draco watched his face and anxiety was threatening to overcome him as he was waiting for Harry’s reaction. Harry sensed his distress and pulled him in, touching his lips to Draco’s soft ones, caressing them with the tip of his tongue, demanding access. Draco’s lips parted, inviting him in. Once Harry’s tongue slipped in, Draco couldn’t help but let out muffled whine, encouraging Harry to further deepen the kiss. Their tongues met and danced together until Harry pulled away, breathing hard, his heart pounding.
"Because you can manage on your own. " I say and he looks at me, doubting. "I’m going to let go of your broom and you will very slightly point it downwards and start descending. You have to be clear that that’s what you want and hold the handle firmly. You want to slowly get back to the ground. Alright?"
Draco entered the courtroom with Hermione behind him, Harry was already sitting on one of the benches besides Wizengamot members. Draco was nervous even though he had a big vial of calming draught just a few minutes ago. They didn’t have much time for preparation, Hermione only extracted a few memories from him, she was so quick he wasn’t even sure which ones, and talked him through main points of his defence.
Some of these fantasies were absolutely innocent, like having a picnic on the edge of the Black Lake that ended up with a Harry kissing Draco or going on a date in Hogsmade, holding hands. Harry filtered through these quickly with a smile, getting to the ones that were no longer so innocent. There was a lot of fucking, it was like if Draco imagined them fucking everywhere in the Hogwarts castle. Abandoned classrooms – check, used classrooms – check, dungeons – check, astronomy tower- check, on the teacher’s table in the Great Hall in the middle of the night - check… In these fantasies Draco always bottomed and Harry had him in every position imaginable. But it wasn’t just that, Harry – in Draco’s fantasies, was rather kinky and dominant, he enjoyed playing with Draco, making him beg, spanking him, tying him up, fisting him… It was so hot. Harry closed his eyes, he couldn’t take anymore.
"Ginny, trust me I wouldn’t have wanted you to find out about me and Draco in this way." Harry said.
He was just on time to step in front of Draco and shield him from killing curse thrown at him by none other than Lucius Malfoy. As soon as older Malfoy saw him he changed into familiar black smoke and disappeared. Harry quickly scanned the surroundings for any other death eaters but they were alone.
"Okay, then close your eyes and try imagining yourself succeeding at the spell. You made it and you are holding perfect sharp needle in your fingers. Imagine the details, how shiny it is, how it would hurt if you pricked your finger, how you can put the thread through the hole in it. And don’t force it, relax." I instruct her and notice that Harry is also listening. He, so far, made no progress with his match.
"That’s okay too, Draco. You can stay with me. I can take care of you until you feel better. And then we can go back to Hogwarts together, I’ve heard that all students are going to repeat the last year in order to graduate. We can go back together." Harry smiled, already imagining them taking the Hogwarts express together. Maybe they will be eating chocolate frogs together, does Draco like them? Or maybe Draco would fall asleep with his head on Harry’s shoulder, missing the whole way while he looks out of window and Hermione reads some incredibly difficult book.
"I won’t send you away, Draco." Harry said and caressed the blond’s hair. "I won’t make you do anything you don’t agree with but it could help you to talk with a mind healer."
"I did. And if I fucking hurried up a little bit, Narcissa might have still been alive. " said Harry and run hand through his disorderly hair.
Harry was sitting on the bed, wearing black formal wizarding clothes and he had a sad expression on his face.
"I’m fairly certain it will work. It has to work. It’s the world’s only chance Draco. Otherwise, your vision... "
"It was more of a group effort, really. Besides what he was wasn’t really alive." Harry explained. Draco shuddered and looked worried, so Harry continued. "But don’t worry, this time he really won’t be able to come back."
"I don’t mean to disturb you two and it’s great to have windows back and a garden but we really should focus on the purification ritual." Hermione said and Draco unintentionally curled up closer to Harry upon hearing the word purification.
Just a warning, this is the chapter with the non consensual intercourse, it's in the italics, if you wish to, skip that part.
"I’m just taking the wet clothes off. I’m going to warm you up." Harry explained as he shed his clothes and only kept his black boxers.
"That’s not what this means. Draco, look at me." Harry said but Draco turned his head. He wasn’t able to meet Harry’s eyes.
I will be grateful for any kudos and nothing makes me as happy as comments. In real life, people aren't very supportive of me writing, which is partially the reason I used to get discouraged easily. But as a part of my New Year's resolutions, I decided I'm no longer going to care and I will just do what makes me happy.
"It was similar, he made you lose contact with everything else, you were contained only in his room, your only contact being with him. People in situations like that often form a bond with their abuser."
"I don’t think that’s true Draco, even in this life, when the Snatchers captured us and you were supposed to identify me, you didn’t. You looked at me and you knew and said nothing. Slytherins can be very loyal." Harry said knowingly.
"Harry, let’s not sugar coat it." Draco snapped and pulled away from the hug. He sat up on the bed and pulled up his sleeve. "You see this mark? It makes me exactly what Weasel said. It means I’m Dark Lord’s little bitch. Dirty little death eater. Weasel might not be the brightest tool in the shed but at least in his assessment of me, he is correct."
And soon Hermione, this brilliant young witch would be dead too – I can see the last curse that hit her eating her up, unless I manage to change the past and therefore change the future as well. Great.
"You just always kept watching and teasing him. I thought he would notice but he was totally oblivious. Like when you climbed a tree to mock him about Triwizard tournament. You know, I saw you climbing that tree, waiting there for him to pass around so you could catch his attention and talk to him." She laughed softly.
"In a coffee shop, he works as a barista to make some extra money after school. And technically, we did poison him, that is some strong sleeping draught he drank. But it will eventually wear off." Hermione shrugged her shoulders. "Do you want some? It probably won’t be pleasant."
"It’s getting dark, we better get started." Harry said and pointed his wand at the wooden platform to transfigure it a bit. He whispered a transfiguration spell and a wooden pole appeared in the middle of the platform.
"Nice to meet you Harry, come visit us anytime at the manor, all friends of Draco are always welcome." My father says and Harry looks sad.
"Now, I hope that was enough to satisfy everybody's curiosity and need for proof." Harry said icily as he crossed the distance between his place and Draco’s. He didn’t care anymore about disrupting trial, he needed to help Draco.
I’ve forgotten many things about my first year of Hogwarts, but one of the things I couldn’t forget even if I tried, is the clumsiness of Neville Longbottom.
"Yes… and no. You don’t understand. I am dirty." Draco pulled away his hand from Harry, hugging it close to his body. "You shouldn’t even touch me, you wouldn’t if you knew what things I’ve done. I am disgusting." Draco whispered and hid his face in the palms of his hands.
Harry noticed that and lay him against the pillows. He slowly undid the buttons of his pyjama shirt and revealed Draco’s chest. His delicate bones were clearly visible, milky white skin contrasting with small dark nipples, just begging to be touched. Harry brushed his fingers against them and Draco closed his eyes in pleasure.
"Yes, totally!" he almost jumps in excitement at the idea and I know it’s because he has never met any other wizarding kid before, never had a friend because of his abusive muggle relatives. "I’m here with Hagrid but I’m sure he wouldn’t mind if you joined us."
Draco nodded. "Harry, kiss me…" he muttered and Harry obliged, leaning over to kiss Draco gently. They let their lips slide against each other, movements slow and deliberate, unhurriedly exploring and enjoying the sensations.
But in later years, he started to put the pieces together. His obsession with Harry, his constant need to watch him, his jealousy about anybody in Harry’s vicinity, his desperation for his attention – he was madly in love with Harry. But he knew that Harry would never love him back.
"I do Narcissa. And I believe Draco will continue to be source of great pride for our family while attending Hogwarts too."
Harry knocked on the bathroom door but again, there wasn’t any answer, Harry was beginning to worry. He knocked again.
"I was just thinking a lot and I started to get a bit dizzy and somehow sleepy. I thought I would only close my eyes for a bit… And the next thing I know you were there."
"I figured that part about the drink out." Draco said as he switched to massaging Harry’s other feet.
If that by any chance works out, then my parents and everybody else will not die and the world will not be on a bring of destruction. No, I don’t feel the crushing weight of responsibility at all.
Harry thought blushing Draco was quite cute. He undressed and got under the covers with him. He was just reaching for the switch of the lamp when Draco stopped him.
"Of course I want to. Close your eyes, Draco." Harry whispered and Draco obeyed. He could already feel Harry’s breath against him and soon their lips met.
"It just hurts all the time, Harry… I’m so tired. I miss my mum. I miss Snape. I miss the old me," he whispered and Harry felt his heart breaking for the shaking blond boy. Draco used to be taller then him but over the past year they both changed. Harry grew up and filled up a bit, he was no longer the scrawny kid with ideal build for seeker. Year of camping with Hermione and Ron toughened him up a bit and he gained some muscles despite not always having much to eat.
"Not at all, Draco. It’s good for him, the elf looks much happier then before and I get to eat too. Here, have another piece." Harry said and fed Draco another piece of the pancake before the blond could even try to protest. Just in that moment Hermione ran into the kitchen.
And I'm sorry for what I'm putting Draco through. At the start of the chapter, he is clingy but mentally, he is doing very well, considering everything. But he is really shaken up by the trial. It's like nothing good ever lasts for Draco.
"Here." Harry huffed, pushing the box into Draco's hands before trying to catch his breath. Draco opened it suspiciously, but as soon as he saw what was in it, a look or disbelief married to his face.
"Only most of them." Harry added, then couldn't help but grin when Draco shot him a glare. "Are you sure you weren't up there to feel tall? You weren't taller than me at that point." Harry said smiling, "Did you have a height complex?" Harry asked trying to sound supportive of Draco's made up complex.
When Draco suggested they have tea while he continue on the adventures of a the Hobbit, Harry smiled and nodded. He felt happy he could bring such emotion to Draco's usually hard set face. He listened contently as he sat with tea a house elf brought him. He could get used to this, just him and Draco, without a care in the world. Besides missing dinner that is.
"Morning. Blaise still in there?" She asked polity. The only other person besides Harry and Blaise that treated him civilly was Pansy. She had given Draco space, and hadn't pushed, and he appreciated that. Maybe they were kind of friends still, maybe.
Today, Potter had been slightly angled towards him, and Draco was able to see most of his face. Thankful that Potter was oblivious as always and hadn't noticed Draco glancing up at him every few seconds.
He saw Harry looking over at his flowers. He pulled his sleeve down. "I'm fine." He muttered and clenched his jaw.
Draco returned his eyes to his wand. He looked down at it in his hand for a while, before he gave it an experimental sweep. A bight light flew out of the wand and made it's way to the beds in the room. Harry could almost feel the magic in the air as he looked to see what Draco had done. "You made the beds?" Harry asked stifling a laugh.
Harry smiled a small, understanding smile. "Thank you too." Then he turned around, threw the Cloak on over him, and disappeared from Draco's sight.
A few minutes had gone by when he looked up at Harry to ask him if he was any good at riddles, when he saw the other boy was asleep.
Midnight quickly approached the two boys as they sat in the hospital wing. Harry had completely exhausted the topic of homework and quidditch and the conversation threatened to die. Not that Harry wasn't okay with the silence, just Harry didn't want to leave Draco alone with his thoughts at the moment. Harry understood the way your mind always tended to betray you with unwanted thoughts and feelings. But Harry had ran out of topics that he wanted to talk about, topics that were safe from bad memories.
This was a challenge, and the Gryffindor inside of him came to life. He decided to meet it head on. So he turned toward Draco, their faces close, and responded in a whisper, "That would be nice." Sure, his feeling were a mess, and he was still internally screaming, but he locked eyes with Draco's grey irises that seemed to swirl with different shades of beautiful pure silver. "Let's do it."
Harry Potter was tired to say the least. This was the last train ride to Hogwarts he might ever be on, and he really didn't know how he was supposed to feel. So he just felt tired. It seemed like the only real thing he could feel currently anyway.
The bed creaked and he looked over to see Draco sitting with his legs crossed, brushing his fingers  over the bouquet Luna had painted on his arm. Harry remembered the colour chart Luna had given him over the summer when he had gotten something similar. He pulled it out and handed it to Draco. As Draco read over the chart the flowers began to shift to a dull yellow-orange colour. Harry didn't remember what that colour meant, so he leaned over Draco's shoulder and looked. His chest barely touched Draco, and he felt like little pin points of lightning were coursing though him. He brushed it off.
What had woken him? What had made him come out here? Why did he seem so upset? Yesterday was bad, but Draco had hoped that he had helped. Maybe he hadn't done enough.
He was completely lost in thought when class started, and dreaded having to pay attention. But he did so anyway, this wasn't his best subject.
"Honestly, Ronald, it will be good to have us all in one place. Besides the normal dormitories are already going to be full since they have twice as many first years coming." Hermione said brushing her hair off of her shoulder.
Draco felt a warmth in his heart that he hadn't felt in a very long time. Was it possible that he was becoming friends with Harry? Dare he say it felt good?
He was sitting next to Ron Weasley, who was listening to Hermione Granger ramble on and on about how going back to Hogwarts to finish schooling was a good idea. Harry wasn't really paying any attention, he had heard it all before.
The light didn't stop when he felt the gash close, it snaked up to Harry's heart and rested there, warming Harry's entire body. The lion moved away, and turned to the ocean. It then looked to the dark rock wall and roared deafeningly. It echoed around Harry, causing him to grow a head ache. As the world turned dark, he saw the lion leap into the silver foam, disappearing into the water.
Draco had come up next to him and looked as Filtch left the hall they were just in. "Yes, filled to the brim with parties and games and drinking." He said in a whisper. Draco was really close to Harry, and his words sent a shiver down his spine. He could feel the warmth radiating off of Draco and he was internally screaming. He was so close. His face was close to Harry's. He had whispered something in the dark to Harry. Something Harry couldn't understand at the moment because he was trying to calm down his heart, which wanted to beat out of his chest.
Harry didn't know what to say to Draco. What could he say? He knew nothing of why, but he wished he did. He wished he could help Draco. His heart twisted when he felt like there was nothing he could do. He wanted to make it better, wanted to save him, but how could he? He knew very little about Draco, only that he had started to draw in 4th year.
The new common room was larger than the one in the Gryffindor tower. It had twice as many chairs and sofas, and a large fireplace on the opposite wall from the door. It had all four banners hanging, and the furniture was also in one of the four main colors. The floor was a brown and black stone pattern, with a few worn rugs thrown around. There was also a few portraits of wizards who were sleeping, and of a witch who was knitting. She looked up briefly at Harry and went back to her work without a word.
They were all titles they threw at him, they wanted to hurt him, he couldn't blame them. He was a unwanted, unloved, useless, murdering bastard. He was a Death Eater. His mark would never go away. He was never going to erase what he had done.
But other people didn't care, because Harry heard all the names being called out to Malfoy. Harry saw all the jinxes and hexes he was hit with on a daily bases. Harry noticed how he was always alone, never talking, never standing up for himself. It almost pained Harry to see how Malfoy was treated, and how he didn't even stand up for himself. That was not the Malfoy he knew, this was a broken person with nothing to live for, and Harry understood that. But coming from Malfoy, it didn't seem right. And he wanted to talk to some one about it, but he knew Ron would tell him that Malfoy deserved it, and Hermione would ask why he cared, and why he noticed so much about Malfoy in the first place.
Harry wanted to help more, but what more could he say? At least it was the truth. Harry then noticed the bruise on Draco's cheek. What else had those students done to him? It made Harry angry. He didn't know why, just because he had said those words didn't make them friends, but Harry still felt protective of Draco. He probably needed to take him to the Hospital Wing, but he didn't think Draco would agree. He tried anyway. "You need to go see Madam Pomfrey." Draco didn't argue, it was almost like he was afraid to open his mouth, afraid of what would come out.
When it was done his father would smile, and tell him not to forget it. Then he'd leave, and treat him normally the next day. As if it had never happened.
"Really?" Draco said blinking a few times. He narrowed his eyes and looked off to the side. He did that when he was thinking. Harry wasn't that observant, but when it came to Draco, he could help but notice. "You wouldn't have made it through the first night." Draco said just as casually.
Then the Golden Boy himself spoke for the first time that morning, "He's not worth it." He said it quietly, then reached and pushed Weasley's hand lower.
“It’s going to be okay.” He whispered softly, reacting his head in the crook of Harry’s neck, trying to put as much support into his words as possible. Harry’s sobbs quieting down, his shaking lessening, his breath finally steady.
"A Map of everyone and everything in the castle wasn't enough for you? With both of those you could kill everyone in the castle. You nearly gave me a heart attack." Draco glared over at Harry.
"Honestly, the more I talk to you, the more Slytherin you become. You might need to rethink if you really belong in Gryffindor, Harry." Draco said. That was his first time calling Harry by his first name, it rolled off his tongue and his stomach flipped. It felt nice to call a friend by their first name. Really it was only Pansy and Blaise that he called by first name.
But why should he ignore it? Why should he let himself suffer? Hadn't he done enough of that today? Why couldn't he escape? Who cared anyway?
Draco laughed coldly. "The Savior of the Wizarding World, not straight? Please, that would be an outrage."
"Thank you all for coming back. I know this is highly unusual, and many of you probably had not wanted to return after everything, but I am glad you all did. I would like to tell you all, that I am proud of everyone of you, and that I could not have a better group of students. We have been together for 7 years. Threw thick and thin, and we all have a story to tell. So, I would like to tell you, my office is always open. If you need to talk, or have a question about these weird times, the password is Lemon Drop." McGonagall smiled again, and wiped a tear away. Not many people had seen McGonagall cry, but everyone knew she had looked around the group and seen, counted, and missed all the people who could not be here. "Now," She had regained her composer, "follow me to your dorms." She briskly walked off, and everyone jumped up and joined her.
It was silent, and he began to wonder if Draco had left. Then he heard the turn of a page, Draco was still there. Harry didn't really know why he was so happy that Draco hadn't left, but he was and that was all that mattered. He sat up and stretched, stifling a yawn. He looked over at where he assumed Draco was, considering that that was where Draco had been sitting, to meet the blondes silver eyes.
Draco had grown tried suddenly. He was glad Harry hadn't said anything. Draco didn't really want to tell Harry what had happened.
Then they turned down a corridor with windows. Outside, the sun was starting to set. Harry slowed to a stop, and Draco followed suit. Harry looked out to the setting sun and suddenly, the day washed over him. Everything he felt through out the day bombarded his thoughts. He felt like he couldn't breathe. He backed up to the opposite wall and slide down the the ground. He breathed deeply, trying to force air down his uncooperative lungs. He stared into the sunset, not able to look anywhere else.
He heard shuffling out in the hallway, and waited for most of the people to exit the train, then he undid his charms and walked out alone. He hadn't looked for his 'friends', he didn't want them near him. They'd be the ones to ask questions.
Funny how quickly he grew to care for Harry. After 7 years of mostly hate, it took a week and a half to become friends. Almost 3 days to develop a crush on him. Though it wasn't anything big, it was still there.
But he was still glad they were there, even if they didn't speak. Because he might explode if someone hadn't been there.
Please, the author of my life, do not make it so I was pushing down a crush for seven years. Please let me have some dignity. Draco prayed to this mysterious 'author'. But of course, he wrote his own story, made is own decisions. His life was his own.
"What can I do for you? I see there's something on your mind." How she saw that, he didn't know, but he knew better than to ask. She sat down next to him. As always, she gave him her undivided attention.
But he could feel the eyes on him from all around the Great Hall, he tried ignored them. Why play into their hands, if they really wanted to hurt him, they would, and he wouldn't be able to stop them. Wouldn't want to stop them. No amount of taunting or confronting could change that.
The world slowly came back to Harry. As his eyes fluttered open, he looked around him. Green and silver adorned the walls and bed spreads. For a second he wondered why everything was green, then he remembered, he was in Draco's room. He must have fallen asleep in the relaxing silence Draco brought with him. It felt good to get some restful sleep, though it didn't feel like he had been asleep for long. He rubbed his eyes and closed them again, listening to the room.
He pulled out his wand, his first one. "Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably springy." Harry remembered Ollivander saying. "Is... is it really...?" Draco tailed off and looked at Harry for conformation.
Harry closed his eyes and let out a long breath. He grabbed on to Draco's fingers, holding on to his lifeline. He sat there, eyes closed, breathing steadily, leaning his head against the cold stone of the wall. Holding on to the only thing that kept him grounded.
Draco was on the floor in front of the sinks. He looked up at Harry with a blank expression and Harry was a little confused. Why was Draco in here? Then he saw it. Draco's wrist. Thick crimson blood seeped out of wounds Harry couldn't see due to the blood. He quickly sat down in front of Draco and took the razor blade from him. Harry set the bloody thing on the ground and carefully pulled Draco's arm towards him and cleaned the blood away from it with a small charm.
"You should be in bed." Was all Draco responded with. Why did the world taunt him? Potter of all people just had to be the one that had caught him pacing.
Eventually he got ready for bed. Pansy left and Draco was closing his curtains. She and Blaise gave him a small goodnight.
Draco found himself exited when footsteps echoed around him. But Harry wouldn't walk so loud if he was trying to sneak in. He was smarter than that. Maybe.
After a few minuets, Harry removed his arm from his red rimmed eyes and returned the pressure onto Draco's hand.
"Anyone would be dumb not to. Just because I found someone as good-looking, doesn't mean I had a crush on them." Draco said definitively.
Draco looked up and met Harry's eyes. Draco clenched his jaw and became stiff. Neither boy said anything, and Harry looked away first, he continued to the fireplace, and sat down in front of the low fire. He felt Draco's eyes on him as he sat down, but ignored it. If it had been another time of day, or last year, he would started something, or hexed him, but he didn't. He just let it slide, because both boys should probably still be asleep, but for reasons, they were not. So Harry ignored Draco's presence and began doing what he always did when he was alone with his thoughts, he pictured his happy place.
"I'm fine. I just didn't sleep well last night. I'm going to skip classes and sleep some more." Draco said. He knew she might challenge it, but he was going to stay.
What on earth was wrong with him? Why did he want to see Potter smile again? What was so special about this smile?
Maybe that's why he fell asleep and once again stopped himself from covering his Mark in his own blood. Because it was a way of escape, and he needed to suffer.
Harry laughed, "yeah, then he said, 'Well, at least it's not broken anymore.' McGonagall freaked out and told him off."
That stung. Draco didn't know why, but hearing that from Saint Potter hurt. He didn't show it though. He watched the Trio walk into the classroom, and he felt his left forearm burn. It did that every now and a again.
Draco opened the curtains and locked the door. "Locking me in? What do you plan to do with me in here?" Harry asked jokingly. Draco fought a blush.
Almost as if Draco had been reading his mind he spoke while still looking into the fire. "I don't want to do anything today. Maybe we should just stay in the dorms and let the day pass us by. I think we both could use a day off."
Draco was a mess. An emotional burden. Someone Draco himself wouldn't want to be by. He didn't blame Harry from running off.
"Don't forget he also helped old ladies cross the street. The elderly community loved him." Draco said, distracting himself from his not crush.
"What are you sorry for? You didn't torturer me. And you saved Harry. You're the reason I'm alive." She had started to paint, she made bold black lines on his forearm, covering up scars and distorting his Mark. The paint was cold against his skin, but he didn't mind it.
"Then no further questions Mrs. Head Warlock." Robards said to Marchbanks and went to sit down on the bench.
"Shut up! Who are you to say who is and isn’t supposed to be here! Fuck, Ron, you cannot just appear in my house and beat up whoever you find here! Draco is hurt and needs help!" Harry shouted back.
“What are you talking about, ‘this’?” Draco asks guardedly, his gaze not leaving the floor. Your silence is pointed, cutting through his charade like a knife through butter. You walk towards him and he backs away, jolting as he reaches the door like a wild animal cornered. You stop, open hands at your sides showing you have no desire to hurt him. He fumbles for the handle and wrenches it open. The hunted look in his eyes pained you but his return would inevitably break you. It had to end.
tired. He sits down, leaning against the wall like Malfoy is doing just a few meters away. Tucking his legs in close, he tries not to think of the scarring events of the day before. His efforts, though, are fruitless.
She and Pansy came to a halt behind a gap in the shelves that made for a good vantage point. They both watched with thinly-veiled glee as their friends were chased out of the library, exchanging mutual nods acknowledging the fact that they were both enjoying their friends’ abject terror. Harry simply ran, forgetting his things in his moment of panic. Draco opted for the most rapid, yet graceful speedwalk Hermione had ever witnessed. How he managed to preserve an air of dignity whilst speedwalking, laden down by both his and Harry’s book bags, Hermione would never understand.
Hermione cleared her throat subtly. She successfully attracted Pansy’s attention. Hermione made deliberate eye contact with the back of Harry’s head and cleared her throat again. Flitwick glanced over.
Draco takes a deep breath, faces Harry again, and nods. Such is Harry's glee that he beams and pulls him in for a hug.
A fresh peal of laughter broke Hermione’s concentration for the fifth time in as many minutes. She sent withering glares across the table to Harry and Draco, who cheerfully continued ignoring her. She had willingly accommodated their budding friendship; Draco had apologised profusely for his past actions, and if Harry was fine with him then that was good enough for her. No one could have foreseen that the two would become fast friends, or that it would result in Hermione rarely ever experiencing peace and quiet again. When they were together they seemed to revert into their younger, more mischievous selves. Currently, they were giggling over a shared textbook, pointing out the more outlandish and pretentious names in the bibliography. Hermione sighed pointedy. Clearly, they hadn't grasped the importance of their Eighth Year exams. Pansy Parkinson, who sat beside Draco, shot them a sour look. Their laughter continued regardless. Hermione deemed it a lost cause, attempting instead to block them out and lose herself in her weathered tome.
An owl hoots nearby and breaks Harry’s concentration. Harry hadn’t noticed the darkness creeping in, too concentrated on his magic. Had he subconsciously been supplementing his eyesight? Curious, he takes off his glasses. He feels a rush of magic to his eyes and the surroundings gradually come into focus.
“Hominem Revelio!” Kingsley yells, attempting to reveal any dark intruders. Harry instinctively tightens the shield. The effect is almost as strong as the wards on 13 Grimmauld Place, one of the most powerfully disguised residences in magical Britain. Malfoy, who is unaware of Harry’s precaution, goes white and stops breathing. Kingsley announces them to be alone. Dean and the Auror, however, do not drop their wands.
On her way back to the Gryffindor common room, she encountered Harry and Draco sitting on a staircase. They looked shell-shocked, and seemed to be exchanging stories of their experiences on the wrong side of the fearsome librarian. Hermione sat down with a sigh and joined in.
“Have you no sense?” She hissed, just loud enough to instil a deep-seated dread into the surrounding students. “No thoughts for anyone but yourselves? This is a library!” Harry and Draco looked stricken. “Get OUT!” Pince bellowed.
“She provided me with quite the warm welcome, so we will have to agree to disagree. Won’t you give me a tour?”
The parchment was decades old, peeling miserably off the wall. Its origins were unknown to the living Hogwarts populace: was it a warning? Merely a joke, perhaps? The wording seemed tongue-in-cheek, but anyone who had crossed Madam Pince knew it to be a dire warning indeed.
The frigid air outside the kitchens makes Draco shiver. Harry is lost in thought as they wander out hand in hand. They have left their cocoon and the feeling of safety that developed within it. The kitchens had escaped the fighting entirely unscathed, which makes the dust lingering in the rest of the castle more prominent.
After a pregnant pause, Draco finds the courage to apologise for one of the first times in his life. “I apologise. I shouldn’t pry,” he says.
The door shuts after ten seconds. Five seconds later a tear trickles down your cheek, for your heart has left with him out into the world.
You can’t remember when the lines began to blur. Childhood best friend, to secret manhood crush, to a lover whom you loved but could never truly have. For years you took what you were given, never asking for more lest it was lost, until you finally couldn't say no. Snatched from you like your naïve dreams of – dare you even think it? – being loved in return.
Hermione had nightmares for weeks afterwards. Invariably, she woke up in a cold sweat with Pince’s words revolving in her head.
Harry nods and they explore the ancient house together. Harry points out the rooms of each of the previous inhabitants and frequently invites Draco to critique the decor. At first, Draco holds back, but within no time at all, he is pointing out the mediocre quality of the woodwork and his being less than impressed with the quality of the gold in the Black family teacups. Nothing escapes his critiquing eye, which Harry is openly amused by.
Kingsley immediately begins casting anti-shield charms. Dean, whose knowledge of concealment spells is considerable after his experience in the war, joins him.
In the immediate aftermath of the war, Harry isolates himself. He can’t help it - he needs space to breathe. Thoughts swirl in his head, vying for attention.
“Welcome to Grimmauld Place, the home of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. That there is the lovely Great Aunt Wallaburga, a blood purism fanatic,” Harry says with relish.
“How very Gryffindor of you to come up with these noble reasons after the fact. As I recall, some of our ideas didn’t exactly scream of caring about Harry’s ‘romantic experiences’. Remember the Veritaserum idea?” Pansy said with a shark-like grin. Hermione scoffed.
Pansy’s heels announced her presence at the Gryffindor table. For nearly two weeks, she and Hermione had been hastily exchanging plans when they ran into each other in corridors. They had once tried brainstorming in the library - Draco and Harry had still been licking their wounds and had refused to set foot in the library, so they thought they were safe. However, Madam Pince put a swift end to their scheming, threatening to kick them out for a week. Thus, the library was out. They couldn’t discuss their ideas in the common rooms because Draco and Harry were there. Pansy had evidently grown sick of having to speak in-between classes, and had made the decision to finally visit the Gryffindor table. Perhaps Hermione’s bravery had been rubbing off on her.
His magic reflects his grief, taking the form of a hurricane whipping around his body. This only stirs up his anguish rather than settling his mind. Harry labours under the onslaught of grief and misery.
“I was listening,” he hastily placates. “The curtains? Consider them gone.” Harry sweeps a hand in the direction of the curtains. The soft golden hues of the sunrise over London immediately fill the room.
The Auror’s eyes widen. “Kingsley. Dean. Do not lower your guards,” her voice lowers to a whisper. “The signature has just been masked. We are not alone.”
wandless magic? He can see the news headings now. They’ll say, ‘only Dark Wizards are capable of such deeds!’ and he’ll be feared for the rest of his life.
“Well, er, I should probably tell you this.” Harry said, looking anywhere but her eyes. “Draco and I have been dating for almost a month now.” Hermione stared.
warns a niggling voice in the back of your mind. Deep down, you know it’s right. You tamp the thought down anyway.
Harry grabs Draco’s bicep and Apparates them. He tamps down the sickening feeling that comes from being squeezed through space and lands neatly on the floor a few metres in front of them. He smiles - he wasn’t sure he was going to manage to do that. As Harry is congratulating himself, he suddenly realises he’s still holding onto Draco’s arm. He drops it hurriedly. Draco turns and looks at him with a wicked grin.
Pansy flounced back to the Slytherin table. She was deep in thought, improving the plans that Hermione had found flaws within. A burly sixth year boy suddenly flung his hand out into her path. She looked at him like he’d grown a second head. Overtly confronting the unofficial Queen of the Slytherin house? Had he completely taken leave of his senses?
“Why do you keep talking about me to Pansy?” He blurted out. Hermione snapped her head around, head clearing of her previous thoughts immediately. “You’re one of my best friends, so if there’s something wrong, just tell me and we can work it out.” Harry said. He dragged his eyes off the floor to meet hers. To her horror, he was welling up. She floundered for a response, taken aback by the sincerity and hurt in his words.
He’s too tired. Too tired to have to deal with any of this. He’d rather curl up on the floor and sleep. Curling up, he achieves, but sleep is more elusive. The deafening noises from the war just won’t subside.
Harry is the one at a loss for words now. “Oh. Er, thanks,” he says. He is reminded fondly of Hermione’s lectures about his refusal to read ‘Hogwarts: A History’. Unsure of anything else to say, Harry turns again to the walls and investigates the magic signatures within. At first glance, he had disregarded the weak, disconnected magic that barely held the bricks together. Now he could sense how the magic yearned to be strong again. It needed purpose, it wanted to become whole again.
“Harry. It’s just Harry. We’ve saved each other’s lives, we might as well stop the last names thing,” Harry mutters. Malf- no, Draco blinks, then seamlessly continues. Must be the pureblood training.
Flitwick nodded. “Don’t be shy, Miss Granger. Ask away next time, ask away,” he said as he demonstrated the movement again. The ruddy colour in her cheeks stayed resolutely on her face, try as she might to get rid of it. Lying to teachers was something she'd never be comfortable doing.
Draco doesn’t even inform Harry he didn’t actually say that he’s in such a state of shock. “How did you…” he asks eventually.
The feeling of impatience doesn’t go away though, he needs more. He and his magic are one. He needs what it needs.
Harry frowns. Draco’s harrowing wartime experiences are matching his own more and more by the hour. He sneaks a peek at Draco, unsure of whether to offer comfort and how. Then, he decides the best idea is to give him food. He and Ron had resolved their petty arguments through food offerings many a time, after all. “So, er, say you could eat anything you wanted, what would you like?” Harry asks, aiming for subtlety. Draco expertly suppresses a grin.
Currently, that power is making itself known. His magic is restless; it needs to be doing something.
Hermione nodded slowly, mind buzzing with the possibilities. They ended up discussing their ideas for some time. The Gryffindors had taken surprisingly little notice of Pansy after her initial outburst, which had given her the confidence to stay longer than she’d planned.
Draco is standing next to a transparent cupboard door that clearly has plates galore. He arches a brow and smirks.
Later, the four of them unwound in the Gryffindor common room. They had snatched the best armchairs by the fire. Draco’s head was tucked into Harry’s chest and the two had dozed off.
His lips brush your forehead in an affectionate kiss known only to loved ones. Your eyes fall shut for a moment as you imagine living your life by his side, dedicating yourself to him and him to you.
“Oh, Harry, Merlin, I’m so sorry! We were trying to get you and Draco together, that’s all! I shouldn’t have done it behind your back. I feel awful, Harry, really I do!” Hermione cried. She felt tears forming in her eyes. Harry was silent. “I was trying to get you to admit your feelings. It sounds so childish now. I didn’t mean to worry you,” she finished passionately. After a few tense seconds, Harry’s arms slowly opened, inviting her for a hug. She gladly returned the embrace and tried to muffle her sniffles in his shoulder.
“I refuse to hear it. I won’t allow myself to become entangled in your elaborate schemes ever again.” Pansy slid down the sofa, flinging a manicured hand over her eyes. Hermione looked on in disapproval, affronted.
Eventually, he has the eggs sizzling away nicely and has located the butter, there is just the issue of the toast. Harry has settled instead with eggs on toast, having decided hash browns and other trimmings were a little too much trouble. For the eggs in the frying pan, Harry only has to do a localised warming charm. When it comes to the toast, however, Harry has to get inventive. He takes out a piece of sliced bread and, lobbing it in the air, casts another warming charm, this one significantly more powerful. His magic leaps at the chance to display its abilities and jumps out of him at full force.
“‘Hunted down,’ eh? ‘A furious librarian’? Do you take me for some sort of beast, Miss Granger?” Madam Pince mused behind them. Hermione shivered again at the faint feeling of her breath on the back of her neck.
Harry doesn’t really want Malfoy terrified of him, so he sits down. He can’t think of anything else.
People want to be near him and congratulate him. Harry’s head is cloudy, he’s overwhelmed. He needs quiet, which is impossible with the many voices all competing for attention. When a hand grabs his sleeve to pull him closer, his tolerance runs out. He looks the clamouring reporters and admirers in the eye and vanishes, without a spell or a wand. His magic is completely attuned to his needs: if only he had paused to think of the consequences of this little outburst. In the back of his mind, he knows he will be hounded - wordless
“Perhaps you would like to explain your outdated views to me instead. Try to keep up with the times, would you?” She said kindly, and patted his head as she strode onwards. She recognised her past self in him and knew that engaging him would only solidify his beliefs. He spluttered indignantly and glared daggers into her back. A great weight lifted from her chest as she realised, for the first time, that she no longer cared. The opinions of that aggressive stranger truly meant nothing to her. She felt freed.
“I suppose not.” He said cryptically. Her eyes narrowed playfully - Ron knew something she didn’t. He’d evolved to become far more of people’s feelings, she noted with pride. By this point, they had reached Harry in the Great Hall so she couldn’t press Ron on his strange reaction.
Pansy quietly excused herself and retreated into the bookshelves. Hermione recognised a good idea when she saw one, and hastened after her in a similarly harried fashion. She had barely reached the safety of the aisles when Pince unleashed her wrath upon the boys.
The plates have returned, complete with crumbs and all. Harry turns to him and power glints in his eyes.
She was startled back into the present by a flurry of movement in front of her. Harry appeared to have dropped a note that Draco had passed to him. Flitwick squinted at him as he frantically rummaged around underneath his seat. Hermione watched as his glasses fell onto the floor, one of the lenses smashing with a tinkle. She muttered a quick ‘reparo’ under her breath. Harry whispered his thanks before shoving them back on and going back to his inspection of the floor.
Hermione stopped mid-sentence as she suddenly sensed a presence behind them. She froze, a shiver ascending her spine.
The group are seconds away when Harry joins him in pressing himself against the wall. They’re close enough to see the light sheen of sweat on the faces of Dean Thomas, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and an Auror whom Harry dimly recognises. They pass the concealed teenagers and slow down, having clearly seen how damaged the corridor in front of them is. They turn around and begin to walk back.
The group walk briskly into view. They make no visible signs that they have seen himself or Malfoy. Malfoy lifts a brow. Are they… invisible?
“You were right, that’s much better. What would you say about the lampshade over there?” Harry asks, with only a hint of desperation.
“I needed to know you wouldn’t go too far. Anyway, my real idea is that we forge a note asking one of them out on a date. What do you think?” She didn't skip a beat, morphing from a serious tone to a playful one in the space of a second. Luckily, Hermione was beginning to get used to Pansy's theatrics so she was able to seamlessly follow along.
Harry holds his ward and constantly masks their trail. The group aren’t able to hear the pounding of footsteps on their on the slabs, thanks to the strength of Harry’s spellwork. Then, Malfoy slows to a stop.
The golden sky blazes when you see him again. The last of the sun shines on his platinum hair like a halo. He smiles as you let him in. Again. You couldn’t say no to him if you wanted to.
“Haven’t had much time to let it sink in, come to think of it,” he says. If he’s being perfectly honest with himself, he hasn’t let himself. Draco, sensing his discomfort, reverts quickly back to discussing magic.
“They had plenty of notice.” Hermione said reproachfully, holding her head high. “Besides, it is a library.” Pansy seemed to agree. They watched in companionable silence until they were sure Madam Pince was out of range. “Call me Hermione,” she said suddenly.
“Yeah. I guess it wasn’t your fault. I was reminded of my Occlumency lessons, which were bloody awful. Snape never asked if he was allowed to see anything,” Harry says, deep in thought. Draco stands still.
“A Malfoy, eh? How lovely. You wouldn’t believe the standard of the company I am forced to keep nowadays, blood traitors and mudbl-” she is cut off by Harry’s swift renewal of the charm.
Suddenly his hand is in your hair, delicately winding a look around your finger. You swallow, hopelessly lost in his smiling eyes. He makes your pain so easy to forget. The looks he gives you ache with fondness. You lose yourself in him and oh, how easy would it be to just stay there for the rest of time.
Your hands tremble, unable to summon the force required to lift, to bare yourself for him. Your eyes moisten.
As intriguing as this is, Harry's body is tired. He can’t remember the last decent sleep he got, and the influx of power has left him physically and mentally drained. He sinks to the forest floor to sleep, lazily casting a reinforced Shield charm.
Harry jogged after her as she left the Great Hall. Hermione was deep in thought and didn’t acknowledge him. Harry seemed strangely distant at dinner, and she was trying to think of something that could have happened between him and Draco.
His magic, confused by the volume and variety of his thoughts, directs itself instead towards healing. The swirling mass dissipates and he feels a tugging in his navel. He is led through the corridor. As he rounds a corner, he sees where the healing magic is directed. Towards one Draco Malfoy, who lies curled up amongst the rubble.
He doesn’t kiss you, but noses at your jawline, your neck. You do not bare your neck, nor do you respond verbally to his attentions. It’s easier to remember he doesn’t need you like you need him when he doesn’t kiss you. You meet his eyes and he is worried, worried you’re not playing along with your usual soft smiles and cheeky remarks. You force your gaze away from his icy stare before he can read you further. As a distraction, you fumble with his shirt. He tuts under his breath before transferring your hands to your own shirt. You should have known better; you must always be the first naked. You hate that bloody rule. It makes you feel so helpless.
Harry’s magic is antsy and his palm is clammy. Harry half-heartedly calls on it to begin repairing the castle again, but abandons the idea.
The jolt that runs through him is incredible; warming, familiar. Harry feels his magic jumping for joy at the chance to explore Draco’s own.
They exchanged brief nods before turning their separate ways. Hermione was in two minds about the experience; it had scared the life out of her, but she’d found a new friend in Pansy.
“It’s trying to help you,” he calls out. Malfoy tries to open his mouth to snap a response but presumably thinks better of it. Harry drops the body bind.
He suddenly gets a flashback to Oliver Wood. All through their fifth year he’d been plagued by thoughts of the Quidditch captain, deep in concentration and bent over on his broomstick.
“Merlin, Potter, get up!” Malfoy hisses. Harry is confused, but then he senses the pulsating waves of magic coming from a group of people rounding the corner. Instinctively, he throws up the strongest shield either of them have ever come across.
He can hear the screams. The injuries and blood spilt sit waiting behind his eyes every time they close.
You feel the air, cold and harsh against your skin compared to the heat of his touches. You can’t bear to open your eyes, the darkness a comfort, a blanket of security. In the darkness, reality bleeds into fantasy. Draco never leaves in your fantasies.
Harry has had a lot of practice grovelling, mainly to Hermione after he or Ron accidentally insulted S.P.E.W, her project to increase awareness about the plight of house-elves. Draco lifts an eyebrow suspiciously but turns to inspect the lampshade. Harry breathes a silent sigh of relief.
He’s rewarded with a tentative hand interlacing with his own. It’s clumsy, but the meaning is clear. He’s forgiven.
Draco’s eyes suddenly meet his. “Harry, what are you thinking about?” Harry panics and retracts his magic. The corners of Draco’s mouth twitch. “Your magic reacted strongly, whatever it was,” he says, the picture of innocence. Harry scowls and drops his hands. He had felt the beginnings of excitement in his navel and guessed Draco must have felt it too.
Harry is guffawing by this point. He is so full of mirth that he completely misses Draco’s slight annoyance at his ‘suggestions’ going ignored. That is until Draco puts his hands firmly on his hips. Harry sobers up immediately.
“Harry, that’s great! I’m so happy for you!” She gushed. “ If you haven’t already figured by my, um, attempts to get you together, I think you’d make a great couple. How did it happen?” Harry’s eyes lit up from her approval. They walked and swapped stories, and the awkward air fell away.
“Get out of my library,” spat Madam Pince, venom lacing her every word. They didn’t hesitate. “I thought better of you,” Pince said, her voice chasing them through the library. Hermione, who looked up to the Hogwarts staff with an almost feverish devotion, had to hold back a sob. Internally, she was in turmoil; she, Hermione Jean Granger, had disappointed a
She wiped her hand absent-mindedly on her skirt. The boy must have gone through a tub of hair-grease every day.
Minutes crept by. Hermione’s concentration powers failed her in the face of a near-continuous stream of giggles. She looked up, a fearsome scowl etched into her face, when she glimpsed Madam Pince looming in the shadows. She was creeping closer and closer, readying herself for a verbal smackdown. Her eyes were narrowed; fixated on the source of the noise. Hermione gulped. Madam Pince instilled genuine fear inside her. Neither of the boys noticed her lurking presence, too absorbed in their little bubble.
Once outside the library, she and Pansy stopped to recover, their faces displaying the same shocked expression. Hermione thanked Merlin that they both had the good sense to grab their belongings, unlike poor Harry. She couldn't imagine having to show her face there so soon. A hysteric giggle bubbled up inside Hermione upon seeing her feelings mirrored on Pansy’s face. Pansy let loose her bark of a laugh at the absurdity of the situation: it wasn’t often that she and Hermione got into trouble together.
His magic decides for him and reaches out to engulf Malfoy. Malfoy scrambles away from him, looking horrified at the sensation. Harry feels the reverberation of his pain: there aren't any glaring wounds, he's mostly been mentally affected. He senses the Cruciatus curse. He can empathise. His magic labours to help his mind, insistent when Malfoy continues moving away. Harry walks forwards slowly. He supposes he must look terrifying, tendrils of magic weaving in and out without even a wand to conduct them. Malfoy halts as he reaches the section of the corridor that Harry hasn’t gotten to repair yet. He can go no further. He turns around slowly and prepares to fight, not accepting his death at the hands of the Golden Boy. Harry’s magic takes control and makes him stop, a subconscious body bind.
He takes your hand in his, leading you gently to your own bedroom. He never waits for you to offer, and why would he? Why would he when he knows you will always follow?
“I saw who you were talking to. At the Gryffindor table. Care to explain?” He sneered lowly, clearly aiming for a threatening tone. Merlin, was that how prejudiced she used to sound? Embarrassing. Outwardly, Pansy simply smiled.
Fueled by gleeful curiosity, Harry funnels his magic into healing a tree that was felled by one of the giants. He sends his magic into it, and he can see and feel the tendrils of golden light pulling the tree back together. It fits every individual piece of bark back together, without so much as a line where the halves had separated. He regards his power with newfound respect.
He can feel magic lashing against his shield, stripping it layer by layer. Harry's magic, veritably fizzing with excitement, replenishes the shield twofold for every layer that is broken.
“‘Mione, have you noticed something different about Harry and Draco recently?” Ron asked hesitantly. Hermione frowned; Ron had made his ample acceptance of Harry’s friendship with Draco clear long ago, it was odd for him to sound so uncomfortable on the topic.
“Harry…” Draco murmurs, looking again at the magic flowing between their hands. He shivers. “For someone so awful at Occlumency and other tasks involving concentration, you have a lot of control of your power. It’s,” he pauses, “thrilling, honestly.” Draco looks embarrassed, like that last bit shouldn't have come out.
“Veritaserum,” Pansy announced loudly. The people who were still eavesdropping suddenly became engaged in hasty conversation. Hermione blinked at the turn of events. “Catch on quickly, Hermione, I mustn’t be seen here for too long!” Pansy hissed, without malice.
“Draco, you’ve got fluff on your shoulder. Let me just…” Harry mumbled, flicking it off. Aside from a tinge of pink in Draco’s alabaster cheeks, he didn’t let on that this was anything unusual.
He suddenly sees that Harry’s hands are glowing gold. He reaches out to touch them. They’re warm, and more calloused than his own. The level of magic stored currently in his palms makes them feel almost fuzzy. Harry suddenly notices the feeling of another holding his hand. He does a double-take but doesn’t end the contact. He looks at Draco who is still inspecting the magic present in his hands. Harry sends a little of his magic through their point of contact.
Once more he is walking towards his death. The grim acceptance of his fate washes over him again. He is drowning, unable to pull free from memories no one should ever be subjected to.
“It’s a talent of his,” Pansy said wistfully. She paused. “Although, I wouldn’t have thought you were the sort to take such pleasure in your friend’s downfall, Granger.”
When he snapped he Elder wand, his magic felt alive. Rejuvenated. Harry didn't register it at the time, overwhelmed as he was with having finally won the war.
“Communication is always appreciated,” Draco huffs. His eyes take a moment to adjust to the darkness. A ‘Lumos’ charm would ruin the old-fashioned feel of the place, so he makes do. He steps quickly after Harry along the narrow corridor.
“That’s not it at all, don’t worry,” she said, her voice softening. “I want them to be an actual couple; Pansy and I have been trying to speed them up.” To her surprise, Ron burst into laughter. She giggled through her confusion; Ron’s laughter was famously contagious. “So far, we’ve not been very successful,” she admitted. Ron hummed noncommittally.
Harry looks at the charred and smoking toast on the floor. He then slowly turns around to see Draco cracking up with laughter. Draco had taken one look at his singed eyebrows and collapsed into merriment. Harry has to laugh. It isn’t often he sees Draco laughing properly, without so much as a sneer or smirk. Usually, he laughs at Harry. For the first time, Draco is laughing
“Er, I was wondering if you would be happy to stay here for a while, with me,” asks Harry tentatively. Draco’s eyes look misty as he turns away. Harry’s heart drops. "I just thought, you know, there isn't anyone who will hunt you down in here..." he mumbles.
“Leave this house!” Screeches a portrait on the wall. Draco jumps and screams right back at it. Harry rumbles a laugh beside him. He silences the portrait with another flick of his hand, which had moved onto screeching about tainted bloodlines.
His magic is feeding off of his body to maintain enough energy for the immense feats it is performing. It desires power, it desires challenges. He slowly replaces the magic into his body and regains feeling.
His magic, replenished from the sleep he’d achieved, sings in his veins again. Malfoy falls into step beside him.
“I haven’t laughed like that in a long time. Being around you is an easy way to laugh again.” Draco says. Then he blushes.
Green light fills his vision as Harry shoots awake. For a few terrifying seconds, Harry is looking his death in the eye again, staring down the Killing Curse. He shakes his head to rid himself of the remnants of his fragmented sleep. When he surfaces fully from the memories of the nightmares, he realises his shield is still up. That’s unheard of - surely it should have dissipated by now. Harry wastes no further time and dives straight into exploring his magic. He gives himself a challenge and tasks himself to repairing Hogwarts. He Disillusions himself and walks back into the caste.
“Nah, he’s my best mate. I’ve been thinking about whether you approve of it actually.” Ron said, unusually serious.
This cannot be allowed to happen again. Not for your sake, and not for his. You try to take his hand, a small comfort that will help you spit the words out. He twists it away, leaving both of your hands to fall limply to your sides. Contrary to what you were expecting, his avoidance of your contact helps you accept that this kind of relationship with him could never be healthy.
“Do not lift that shield. Potter,” he pauses to inhale sharply, “please.” His whispered plea makes little sense in Harry’s sleep-addled brain. Why would he not want the shield lifted? The group are on the Light side. Surely they mean no harm.
Gradually, he becomes aware that he’s crying. While his mind surfaces from the challenge he has taken on, the magic surrounding his body gains a red hue. The reparations process stops. His extremities are numb.
Unexpectedly, it swirls around his body and starts to heal all the wounds it comes across. Harry, who was never very good at healing spells, is stunned into quiet admiration.
Harry is proud of himself for not letting out any of the bitterness that he still feels towards Dumbledore. He glances at Draco who looks deep in thought. He dropped quite the bombshell there, to be fair to him.
Harry drifts into consciousness. He scrambles to sit up, reaching for his wand - he recognises that voice. Several things come to his attention at once: memories of the war; that he no longer needs his wand for magic; and that Malfoy is looking just as bedraggled as he feels.
Not a word is spoken while you walk him to the door. Oddly, you feel almost as exposed with clothes as without. You have never felt discomfort under his gaze before. Merlin, probably because he ignored you when you said no! You’d never really considered whether he really had your best interests at heart before.
He began, instantly feeding power into the floors, walls, and the roof. He took care not to bombard the weakened structure but to delicately weave the strings of magic back together. It was a slow process but one he found himself enjoying immensely. Soft gold strands of magic spider out from where the stream enters the stones. He reaches out to try and better channel his power. He feels a tingling in his fingers again. This time, it doesn’t feel malicious - he feels the magic working with him instead of draining him.
Hermione could envision the thunder crashing across Pince’s face with alarming accuracy. She sent a quick prayer Merlin’s way beseeching him to ensure that she’d never be on the receiving end of Pince’s legendary temper.
Harry does seem to know what he’s doing, to give him credit. He simply banishes the creature with a wave of his hand. Draco is suddenly pulled along and stumbles, having firmly closed his eyes again. Harry turns and chuckles.
Bitter tears fall. His sobs are quiet; he is well aware that his once-enemy sits only metres to his left. His magic is turbulent, shifting restlessly around his motionless form. The storm of magic surrounding him has become murky and black, isolating him from his surroundings. His feelings of helplessness and terror are magnified.
“They aren’t even being subtle any more. Surely it's only a matter of days now,” Pansy replied. Hermione hummed her agreement.
“How do you do,” he says grandly, inclining his head towards the woman in the portrait. Her eyes flick to him for the first time. Draco looks at Harry and silently asks him to remove the silencing charm. Harry complies.
“Potter, give it a rest. You’re falling asleep in front of my very eyes.” Malfoy intones. Harry, startled, looks over at him. His magic has spread across multiple floors. As much as he is loath to pausing the reparations, it’s a bit too much. Instantly, he retracts his power from the castle. He stumbles due to the magnitude of magic that is instantly absorbed back into him. It hums in his veins. Black spots clear from the edges of his vision.
Later, upon fishing the note out of Hermione's bag, they discovered it was merely an innocent note asking if Harry was paying attention. Disappointed but determined not to waste any precious time they could use to make plans, they had binned it. If they had only taken a moment to check for any magical trace on the note, they might have uncovered something far less innocent...
Harry glares, harrumphs and twirls around. Then he freezes - that was very Draco of him. Oh, Merlin, he’s catching the Slytherin flair for dramatics.
He has given up waiting for you to join in today, you realise. It’s all you can do to hold back another wave of tears.
“Er, I dunno. After I died maybe?” Harry hazards a guess. Draco is speechless again. Inwardly, Harry is pleased - he’s managed that twice now. Draco makes an uncharacteristic spluttering noise, so Harry spares him the effort and answers the unsaid question. “I had to get killed to allow Voldemort to be killed. I was lucky though, I got to choose to come back.”
The kitchens are deserted. Harry goes to the cupboards and selects the ingredients for a full English breakfast. He leaves them all out and looks at them, stumped. Harry can’t find an oven. Draco is similarly at a loss. Harry, having had lots of experience cooking for his relatives, assures Draco that he knows how to make a full English breakfast, he’s just never had to do it without a hob.
“Come back when you’re ready to be friends,” you say. Pause. “I still love you, Draco,” you blurt out, unable to help yourself. He meets your eyes for three seconds, conveying a lifetime of angst-ridden self-denial. You almost feel bad for him. Almost. His Adam’s apple bobs and you hear the words stuck in his throat. It’s all you can do to turn away.
“Potter, you’ve misunderstood. I simply meant that the spellwork imbued in the castle must also be paid attention to.”
“Firstly, most of the ideas were yours.” She shot. “I was going to say, I know why I was so invested in their relationship. I haven’t had a chance to care about petty things in so long, what with the war and everything. Harry had even less of a chance to experience romance than I did. Even you-” She was interrupted again by Pansy.
“Me? Scared? I think you'll find you're sorely mistaken,” Pansy said, sticking her nose in the air. Hermione hummed and decided not to comment, having caught the light-heartedness in her words.
“Yes,” you whisper, exhaling into his collarbones. He smirks, secure in the knowledge that you would never say no, never renounce his claim, his ownership over you. He pulls your hip bones to his pelvis, his body a stone wall, unyielding. You shape yourself against him as you have always done. Deft fingers lift your chin, cupping your jaw. His lips touch yours, delicate in the most tantalising of ways. You tip your head back, chasing him, leaning into the contact before he swiftly ends it like he always does. Helpless, you remain motionless as his lips leave yours. Hoping he allows you another stolen kiss.
Your sniffles die down, the last of your tears soak into his shoulder. All too quickly, his hands sink from your lower back to your arse. He winds a knee between your thighs, nudging them apart. You comply. He pulls your legs around his, half lifting, half dragging you to bed. ‘It’s too fast for this,’ you want to say. ‘Not yet.’ But you have tried that before, and his obvious impatience wore you down like sandpaper. You lie there. You let the duvet swallow you.
“I meant it’s easy to laugh at you, Potter, not that you’re funny! You aren’t.” Draco says, the tips of his ears burning. He retreats, slinking back over to his table, although not before he hears Harry chuckle. He curses internally. His pride may never recover.
“I don’t know what to do. My purpose has only ever been to defeat Voldemort and now that’s gone. I don’t want to be a bloody poster boy for the Ministry,” Harry says, tugging frustratedly at his sleeve.
He walks into the castle, remaining undetected. He tries to heal any visible wounds on the people he passes, then those out of sight when he realises he can. Their gaunt faces gradually filling with happiness is reward enough for the Boy Who Lived.
Suddenly, the Auror’s eyes narrow. “Wands out,” she says lowly. Kingsley seems to come to the same conclusion a beat later, drawing his own.
“I would humbly suggest,” says Draco, “that you completely redo the wallpaper. That shade really hasn’t aged well. Also, I think we would both agree that those curtains also need to go. Sooner rather than later, I think.”
