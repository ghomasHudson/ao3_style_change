"Yes, you do!"
Great, Draco had thought. Now he had to talk to the older witch. He hated the pitying look Madame Pomfrey got on her face whenever he dropped by to get himself healed of whatever new curses he had had inflicted upon him. He couldn't stand the quick concerned glances she would give him whenever she thought he wasn't looking.
"Wait for a second," he suddenly exclaimed, standing up from his seat. "Draco?! Did you just call Malfoy, Draco?"
"Yeah?"
Oh well. It was for the best. As his father said, it was unbefitting of a pureblood Slytherin like him to befriend a lowly Gryffindor like Potter.
"What do you mean?"
By the time the Yule Ball occurred, it was obvious that Draco would bring his best friend.
Instead, he turned his focus towards antagonizing Potter, who everyone believed was the heir of Slytherin for some dumb reason. He hung out with that mudblood girl all the time, which Draco would never understand. Why would someone like Potter want to hang out with the likes of her and Weasel? He had heard that he was raised by muggles, but why associate with those beneath them? His father would have never allowed him to associate with someone so low.
"I'm just trying to be friendly here," he said, shaking his head a little at Draco's stubbornness. They
Draco noted the change in topic but was too tired to really care.
"Potter. I'm trying to eat my breakfast in peace."
Classes were interesting, and he excelled at potions; the only thing that annoyed him was that twig masquerading as a person, the boy who lived, Harry Potter.
The time between his breakdown in the bathroom and the end of the second wizarding war had passed both excruciatingly slow and far too fast. Dumbledore was dead, the Dark Lord was living in his house, Luna had been snatched off of the train and brought to the Manor. When he was there, he made sure to try to make things as easy as possible for her. She never did anything that warranted all of that; she was Loony Luna, she wasn't supposed to get tortured and held prisoner in his home.
And he felt like his world was less fractured than before.
He tried not to think about those … horrific memories, but he did wonder about it at times. What about it was so appealing to them? Would Draco one day also find that appeal?
"Don't worry, Harry. Draco's just got a bad case of Nargles today."
Then, of course, it had all fallen apart. His father had been thrown into Azkaban and suddenly found himself at the bottom of Death Eater ranks. Not that he had actually been part of them, but he was going to now. They were acting as though it was such an honour to receive the dark mark, to become an official part of the Dark Lord's forces, and be trusted with a task by the Dark Lord himself.
Draco raised one delicate blonde eyebrow. "So...you're stalking me."
"Are you okay?" he asked, his tone becoming more and more upset. "Did something happen? Were you attacked again? Who was it? I'll give them a real beating. I thought the last time would've taught them, but I guess I'll have to make things even clearer."
The pressure eventually got to him, and he ended up crying to a strangely sympathetic Myrtle, letting out all of his fear and stress and dread, and he just hated himself. He was selfish, he knew, but all he wanted was for things to go back to how they were in fourth year when his biggest problem was Potter and his lack of romantic interest in anyone. He hadn't thought of such trivial issues in ages. Hell, he probably wouldn't live long enough for his lack of attraction to ever actually affect his life.
Draco smiled back.
It was absolute torture; Draco was stuck in limbo. He couldn't fail, for that would mean a slow and torturous death for him and his parents, if he was lucky (or unlucky) enough to survive his task, but he also knew that he couldn't do it. He was a coward. He may have talked big, but that was all a front, now faced with the task of fixing the vanishing cabinet as well as
Harry looked like he wanted to disagree but begrudgingly had to admit that yes, Draco Malfoy had Hermione beat when it comes to potions.
"Anyways, where are you headed right now? Our class is in the other direction."
Ron nodded and looked at Harry as though he had grown a second head.
On the outside, Draco was simply being an entitled and whiny prick, but at least someone was able to see the real him, even if it was just Pansy.
In his periphery, he saw someone sit down right next to him, essentially trapping him between them and Potter.
And Draco had thought that maybe he didn't want to keep being one either.
"Harry."
He hadn't wanted the creature to die. But he couldn't do anything about it. He had tried to persuade them that killing it was unnecessary and that there was no need for such drastic actions, but one look from his father had him shut his mouth. It was a look that foreshadowed the pain and wrath that would follow if he disappointed and embarrassed his father any more than he already had. It was a look that Draco knew well.
The look on Potter's face sent him into a fit of laughter, something which surprised even himself. He hadn't truly laughed or smiled since before Voldemort had moved into the Manor.
He'd just head back to his room and take a nap for the rest of the day. Madame Pomfrey would probably corroborate on his story that he was feeling unwell.
Pansy had been his only solace. She understood him, sometimes even better than he did himself. As a fellow pureblood and having practically grown up together, Pansy knew the responsibilities and restrictions of pureblood society well.
Harry paused and looked at him with an eyebrow raised.
To be fair, not many eighth years had returned either. In fact, Draco had been the only Slytherin to return for the year, Pansy and Blaise both having moved abroad to finish their studies.
Ah yes, Luna Lovegood. One of the few people in Hogwarts who treated him like a regular person. Well, as regular as Luna could treat someone.
Absolutely wonderful.
"I don't think I can love."
He'd be lying if he said that he'd somehow always known that there was something different about him when compared to other kids his age.
The conversation then turned to a slightly academic debate on the efficiency of magical pesticides where he and Hermione were arguing about potential ways to improve current potions while Luna occasionally interjected with homeopathic methods of magical pest removal.
"Draco!" came the obnoxiously pleasant voice of Harry Potter from somewhere off to his left.
He then spent the rest of that day crying in the comfort of Pansy's arms, telling her how he had never felt attracted to anyone ever and that while all the other fourth years were obsessing about crushes and dating, he simply couldn't imagine himself in such a situation without feeling like he'd have to claw off his skin. He confessed how scared he was that he would be alone forever and how terrified he was of disappointing his parents.
"Okay, okay. Geez, Harry, Chill." He huffed, causing Potter to turn an oddly endearing shade of red. He didn't know why he felt a slight fluttering feeling in his gut at the sight. He shook it off, attributing the sensation to being happy surrounded by people he could almost call friends.
Draco noted that Potter looked dumbfounded and almost offended at his best friend's response. The blond smirked.
"Nope. No idea."
Draco rolled his eyes exasperatedly, walking in the direction of the Eighth year dorms; no point in going to class at this point, and while he was hungry, he had no appetite for food or the energy to deal with the house-elves working down in the kitchens.
Of course, it hadn't been the end of it. That would have been too easy on him.
He rejected Draco's offer of friendship, though, which stung. A lot. Not that he would ever admit that. He knew better than to show weakness.
"Yeah."
"Sod off!" he yelled, which only prompted a bark of laughter out of the blond.
How had it come to this?
Ordinarily, Pansy's behavior would earn her an amused scoff and an eye roll from the blond, but this time she got .no such reaction. Instead, Draco stopped laughing, his expression suddenly turning somber and severe.
It hadn't been a singular event, something that happened, and suddenly his world was different; it was slower.
"Mr. Malfo-" Draco ignored the witch's words, and half stumbled half limped out into the hallway.
"I could ask you the same," Harry replied with a raised eyebrow. "I came out here to look for you since you didn't show up for class.
On his 5th birthday, when it was announced that he and the girl he sometimes got to play in the garden with, Pansy as his five-year-old self recalled, were to get married when they were older, he didn't think anything of it. Pansy was fun, if a bit of a brat at times, but so was he. He liked her, though probably not in the way that two people getting married should like each other, with loving eyes and soft caresses. He figured that would come in time.
"You know, Potter," he drawled lazily. "You can call me Draco as well. I don't mind. So no need to be jealous of your friends. You're special too."
"Sorry," Draco huffed out between giggles. "It's just that you reminded me that despite being the boy-who-lived, you're really just a boy."
Happiness and Draco Malfoy.
"That's not funny," he grumbled angrily as Ron and Hermione joined them at the table.
Shaking his head in an effort to snap out of it, he quickly escaped into his room, slamming the door. He leaned against it, legs feeling weak, slowly sliding down until he was on the floor. His heart was beating fast, fluttering like a swarm of fairies, and there was this odd feeling in his stomach that made him feel both weightless and heavy, as though he would just float away but was also too heavy to float.
"We're the same age!"
Harry then left, leaving a flushed Draco standing frozen in front of his door.
Being back in Hogwarts had been weird; as Eighth years, they were no longer separated by houses and instead had a wing all to themselves. They also got to have their own personal rooms where they could enjoy more privacy.
He had tried to convince Pansy that he wouldn't mind at all if she went ahead and asked someone else to go with her, like that Ravenclaw girl a year below them that she had been checking out from time to time.
He had decided to focus on his first impossible task first, fixing the cabinet, and when Borgin sold him the necklace and hand, he thought that he might have found a way in which he could actually succeed. He couldn't kill Dumbledore directly, but if he were to get someone else to do it or do it indirectly, he would technically have completed his task while still… somehow in his own mind, have plausible deniability on his role in the murder. It didn't have much logic to it at all, but at that point, Draco had been under so much stress he felt like all reason had fled his being.
Grabbing the parchment I had stashed away for quick owls, I scrawled a reply down.
“I wanted to be him so bad.” Draco spoke up out of nowhere, in the quietest whisper. “Mother made it seem as if I had to be, as if it was this honor to even know him. I know now she did that to protect me, but it was all I wanted back then.”
“What?”
“Thank you”
Seamus and Dean showed up about ten minutes later, Ron making me go answer the door while I was still cleaning up his candy on my own floor. They very quickly went straight to the muggle recliner beside my couch, not even a minute into being here and they’d managed to find one chair to “share”. They always do, sit in the same chair that is. They’ve done it ever since school, even when there was more space they were always practically on top of one another. Most of their night was spent laughing at me and whispering to each other, so really it was just like any other night.
“Oh!” He exclaimed happily. “I got us hot chocolate since it’s too loud in there but a bit cold out here” Sticking his hand out to me and waiting for me to grab the cup, seeming rather excited when I took it from his hand. He looked up at me expectantly. Taking a sip I noticed he was attempting to see my reaction, so I tested him by smiling, to which he smiled back.
“I don’t know”
Ron came into my view, his drink no longer in his hand. Placing his hand on my shoulder and moving so I could see him in the mirror.
“What else could you possibly mean?” Confusion clear in my voice, my head slightly tilted to the side.
"You got post, mate?" Ron asks, muffled with beans in his mouth. Hermione just sighs deeply at the poor display of table manners, but she lets it go so she can pay attention to Harry's letter.
His friends (the real ones) observed his change of behavior with worry. Draco wasn't a very outgoing person, he preferred private settings and conversation over a nice cup of tea or dinner with wine to the Leakey, but now he was basically a hermit. He refused to set foot outside the Manor and no threats, dares or magic could convince him otherwise. They were forced to visit him at home if they wished to see him. And without their insistence, Draco might have lost his mind.
"Yes, Draco, I know," Harry said and smiled softly. "I can't and won't doubt you no more. You've been so good to me and you deserve someone, who is good for you and to you too. Even if it's not me, though I wish I was." Harry looked away sadly. Although he laid his heart out for Draco, he wouldn't have to accept it. Draco really deserved the world and Harry would give anything for another chance, but in the end, it was up to Draco.
Nobody knows that better than Draco Malfoy. He's been trying to get Wonder Boy's attention for the last three years, seemingly without any success. Draco feels quite hopeless about it. He had planned every accounter, had tried to make himself presentable and talk as long as possible with him, but it all went to shit the moment, Draco opened his mouth. He scowled. Pansy had said, that his cheeky mouth would be the death of him and he finds, he agrees. His heart aches when he thinks about all the terrible things he had said and done. But who was he kidding? This was the kinda crush you knew would never work out. Not only, because the other person doesn't seem to like you, no, it's also because they are unreachable.
"Can you live with that, Hermione?" Harry asked and she had to look at his face to see how serious he was about this. He wasn't smiling, just waiting patiently for her to answer. There was a little bit of fear in his eyes. He didn't want her to make him choose and for a little moment, Hermione hated herself for making him feel anxious about his place in her life. She vowed to never let him feel anxious about that ever again.
But he couldn't say that.
A loud
"I will die here either way," he said like he made his peace with it, "So I can at least save you."
"Everyone lost something and had to work hard to get it back. Some things come never back and I'll always feel sorry for that," he paused, sighed and spoke with more conviction, "but I'll never feel sorry for my choices that concern my happiness. I want to feel that, I want to have that and I deserve that. And if my happiness is with Draco, then there's no one who can question me on that," he said and Hermione didn't dare to argue with him.
"But, but, I'm a man!" Draco objected hotly. He wouldn't let himself be ridiculed again. Harry had played with his feelings for far too long, he would never allow it to happen again.
"I'm one of those, who are at fault for that. You cannot heal trauma with the traumatizer, Headmistress," he presses out, balling his hands. Rather than commenting on it, she takes one of them into her own. He looks almost astonished.
do. It's your secret admirer after all. I've done the basic work for you and made you a list. And you just have to speak with every Slytherin and Ravenclaw on that list," she grins and hands him the parchment. It's a very long list. Harry pouts and scans the names. Some of them sound familiar and some of them are just names without a face.
You stare at the envelope on your desk and count your fingers, to be sure you're not dreaming.
"What is the matter with you, Draco?" Severus asks bluntly and the student almost chokes on his tea. Severus glares disapprovingly and hands him a napkin. If Severus didn't suspect that something was wrong, he was sure of it now. Draco cleans his mouth, puts his cup back, and sighs.
"I can't hear you, darling," Potter said and somehow the tensing drained out of Malfoy that instant. He raised his head, smiled serenely at Potter, and kissed his hand.
. But you suppose, you can't fault him for trying to stay alive. You can talk to him now, every time you like. Your cheeks pink a bit.
"Are you going to ask him to Yule?" he whispers, because he's afraid, that his voice will give out and Harry caresses his hand with his thumb. It's a small gesture that makes him incredibly happy and sad at the same time. He has to come up with a good excuse to come not to the ball. He couldn't stand Harry dance and laugh with or
the lucky one, but you're too chicken to say something to him."
But Draco didn't seem like he understood. He looked like he was about to collapse.
King James had married Queen Lily, a commoner, while breaking off his engagement with his promised lady. It had been quite the scandal if one could believe the gossip Mother exchanged on her weekly afternoon tea parties.
"I am aware of those conditions. But I have been informed, that Mr. Malfoy is free to spend as much time as he wants in the library as long as he stays here. Mr. Potter asked me to watch Mr. Malfoy, but I don't see the need for that. As you can see," she gestures to Draco, "he is behaving himself, studying
"Ronald Weasley, sir," the redhead said, not the least afraid. Draco admired that courage. Most commoners fell over their feet to please noblemen, but this one seemed not inclined to do so.
Mother was looking at him impatiently and gripped his arm a little tighter than necessary, but he endured it with an easy smile.
"Well, I mean, the guy isn't so bad after you know him a little, but I still wouldn't have picked you falling for him," Ron explained, but Harry couldn't see his point.
"But they got their shit together after that. Harry spoke at Draco's trial and they were friends when Draco got his apprenticeship. And now..." he trails off and you are hanging on his lips, but he doesn't finish. Thank you for nothing, you want to say, but a particular detail makes you ask.
"Mr. Boot, is that right?" she asks then icely, and Boot nods. "For disrupting another student, loudness, and other trivial matters I will deduct twenty points from Ravenclaw! I hope this will teach you to be a little more accepting, Mr. Boot."
and Harry thrust one last time, brushing against his sweet spot, and then he was coming, untouched.
He asks and the god of love frowns.
After two weeks Draco enjoys his old routine. He missed the simpleness of waking up, eating breakfast, going to the library and classes, learning, and sleep. It was at the same time aggravating and soothing. Potter was doing his duty and annoyed him to no end. He almost followed him into the bathroom and only a very severe tantrum and a serious threat from Draco to kill Potter in his sleep stopped him from doing so.
like the mother hen she was.
"Yeah, you better be scared! I warned you, I fucking warned you, didn't I?!" she sneered, "I warned you, what would happen if you ever dared to hurt him." A sinister smile crept on her face. "I will enjoy it, I assure you."
"I know the risks," Malfoy said, healing a nasty bruise in his face, ignoring his own on his throat.
"It doesn't hurt any less," he whispers and Blaise's heart breaks to see his best friend like this. "I thought, it would get better after some time, but it doesn't hurt less."
"Don't overdo it," was the clear message, but Draco was impatient.
"The new Muggle Professor, I presume?" he asks, expression neutral, but his tone is mocking. McGonagall doesn't say anything again but shakes her head. You are disappointed that she doesn't come to aid you. Maybe she's curious, who will win this unofficial duel.
Draco seemed to be really upset, but Harry choose to ignore that in favor of his own anger.
The Yule Ball neared and Draco tried pathetically to scout his rivals. Harry was interested in Cho, Draco could see that, but the Gryffindor was to shy to do something about it. Draco laughed at the absurdity of it all. He was sure, that Harry wouldn't like him back, but he looked for signs anyways. After he dropped a few hints here and there, which proved to be pointless, he gave up. Either Harry was deadset on being his nemesis, or the boy was just dense as hell. Draco tipped on the latter, but he had no evidence to back that up.
"Potter," he sneers and went right past him, but Potter didn't even struggle to catch up.
"Have you already ordered?" Draco asked, voice still light with amusement and when she shook her head, signed for a waiter.
"Fair enough," he acknowledged and pretended he didn't yelp when she slapped his ass. Pansy crackled and resumed her make-up. Harry finished his shower and dried himself when he heard the bell ringing. He looked at Pansy, but she was still busy, so he threw on some sweatpants and hurried to open the door. He was surprised to see a gorgeous man standing there, who's eyes widened in shock upon seeing him. Harry smirked, putting his hand in his pocket to feel more chill than he was. The man was sneering now and obviously fighting himself to keep his eyes above Harry's shoulders.
Because of Potter's promise to watch him, Draco had to make amendments to his schedule. He had to follow Potter to his Quidditch practices, even if Draco himself didn't play. Most of the Eighth year students weren't allowed to play, something about unfairness, but the Golden Trio was the exception for everything. Ron Weasley looked at him in disdain every time he showed up but Draco only sneered back and focused on his book. Potter would nudge Weasley in the shoulder and that was that. At least he had something to do in those practices.
"What will happen, if it never gets easier?" he asks quietly as if he is afraid of the answer. Draco takes his hand again. It's a habit now. They grab each other's hands anytime they want their attention. And they never fail to deliver. Sometimes Draco wonders, what will happen if he cannot grab Harry's hand like it's his own. He never wants that day to come. He prays, that that day will never come.
"You were brilliant, darling, absolutely brilliant," Harry praised him, as he took Draco from behind. This was one of Draco's favorite positions for various reasons: Harry could sink his hand in his hair or around his throat, driving him closer to orgasm with a single pull or squeeze. His cock was also deliciously deep inside, stroking all the right places. And lastly, he loved Harry's weight on him. His chest on his back, his hands on his nipples, nails in his skin. Sex from behind was a guarantee for bruises and Draco lived for those. Harry sucked a hickey on his neck, licking and biting until it was blue and purple.
hear Harry's name twice. In various settings and subjects. Just yesterday three young witches gushed about his manly beard, his green eyes and dreamy smile and Draco was ready to vomit. Just the name made him uneasy.
"Well, you want him to love you, don't you?" Ron asked, his finger again in Harry's face, "So go out there and do it."
"You are mine, Draco. Mine, body and soul!"
"You do, Potter. Isn't that enough?" Zabini tries to deflect, Harry notices and takes a deep breath, because if he messes this up, he'll never get to meet his secret admirer. Zabini is like the lock to the door. He has to bring him on his side, has to convince him to let Harry talk to that Parselmouth or at least, give him a message. He collects his thoughts and meets Zabini's stare dead-on.
"Yes, of course. And I'll even declare it with my words, Draco, not just with a dance: I would like to court you, officially."
The god of happiness insists.
"My Godfather negotiated half a year of childish freedom for me, before I had to take on my responsibilities. I always wanted to write, wanted to ask how you were," Harry's eyes turned wistful, "but for some reason I never did." Now he looked at Draco intently. "Please forgive me."
"Oh no, mate. You're all on your own."
"No, I- I'll dance with you," he stuttered and took the offered hand. Harold's smile widened just a bit before he smoothed his face out and he brought Draco to the dance floor. They bowed to each other and took their positions. Draco wondered, wether he should lead or not and he couldn't decide, because his head was all hazy with panic. But the Prince just gently took Draco's hand and placed it on his shoulder.
"I came back three years ago and made my Ph.D. in Psychology. But my goal was always to teach at Hogwarts and I am beyond grateful for the opportunity," you nod at the Headmistress, who returns it graciously. "I hope, we will work well together." You are quite satisfied with your speech and the applause is welcoming. The blond guy claps very slowly as if he wishes to be literally anywhere else than here. Potter elbows him and hisses something in his ear. Blond guy smirks again and whispers something back, that had Potter blushing. Arrogant prick.
"Not that late? Harry, it's almost two in the morning," Draco said and pinched the bridge of his nose. "You were supposed to be here three hours ago. You promised me."
He gave up after Potter came down, just to hear him scream.
"Swear on his mother?" Draco repeated slowly, "Really?"
Lol, I post the rest sometime soon, promise
She permits and the god of happiness does as he's told.
Blaise squeezes his hand and Draco tries a thankful smile, but it hurts to move his face, so it ends in a grimace. It's silent for a while until Draco looks up again and takes Blaise's hand in his.
The two had struck up a bit of a friendship after the war, with Luna occasionally dropping by his muggle apartment for tea. She had apparently decided that since Draco had gone out of his way to make sure she was comfortable during her imprisonment at the Manor, he was a good guy and didn't deserve all the hatred directed at him. Draco disagreed, but didn't have the heart to fight her on it. Oh, the things he let that girl get away with.
Dumbledore, he was falling apart at the seams.
"Hey, Pans?"
He was simply just Asexual.
He took a quick glance at one of the many clocks in the school. Great, he was a good half-hour late for class.
The gleaming white of the robes accentuated his pale skin and platinum hair, making him look stunning and ethereal. There was no question of his Veela heritage; he was practically glowing with an aura of elegance and allure.
He didn't know why Potter saved him. He should have left him to die. He was selfish.
The light session of crucio hadn't been that bad, but he wondered if he made the right choice.
Pansy, ever his saving grace, had simply held him close and whispered comforting reassurances into his ear.
Draco had sobbed harder at that; he doubted he ever would,
Potter glared at him.
That year did him a lot of good. No one knew who he was and what he had done; it was a clean slate. He had gotten a muggle job and a modestly sized apartment. Muggle technology was truly fascinating, what with their handy devices they could carry around with them to listen to music to. Not to mention this thing that they called the internet.
Regardless of how cruel he was to those he seemed lesser than him, and how much power he believed he held, Draco Malfoy was not a killer.
"Yeah, man. You're like the only one who still calls him Malfoy."
The punishment was to be his death.
"Thank you."
"Like you have any right to talk," he snapped back. "You're just jealous I have such a genius girlfriend. Thanks to her, I've been doing pretty good in most of my classes, so you have no right to judge. The only class I still actually struggle in is potions, and we all know Draco is better at it than anyone."
Fifth-year had started off great. The Dark Lord had returned, which meant that his father was in a great mood. He was also made the Slytherin Prefect along with Pansy, an honour that Saint Potter didn't get to receive. Draco had felt like he earned the right to taunt Potter over it, considering their history. The mud blood ended up being a Prefect, but he guessed that it would have to be her out of all other Gryffindors, even if she was a mud blood. Weasel, on the other hand, well, Draco guested he could have the title of Prefect at the very least, what with how much he's been helping the Slytherin team in quidditch. So the song and the insults were a little bit over the top, but hey, they did give him a good beating. He liked to think that counted for something.
No. That place was no longer his home. Hadn't been since the death eaters took it over. Home was supposed to be safe; here, he was surrounded by those who wished him harm.
"Doesn't change the fact that I'm the more mature one."
"Potter, I'm just kidding." he said in a poor attempt at reassuring the man, "Honestly, can't you take a joke?"
When the Golden Trio had been brought in during his Easter break, and he had been summoned to identify Potter, who was under a stinging hex, he didn't want to.
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione was right behind them, seemingly on an important phone call with someone in the ministry. I’ll always be grateful she convinced Kingsley to allow muggle technology into the ministry. Ya know? Cause what else would allow my friend to work 24/7 and ignore me for an hour at my own event? Definitely one of her better achievements.
Draco broke out in a loud laugh for a moment, something funny probably popping up on the screen, one hand holding his stomach in pure excitement.His whole body was moving while he laughed, hair flying every way possible.  He looked at me for a moment, a small smile spreading across his face, the glint in his eyes leaving me stunned.
Silence filled the house for a few moments, neither of us wanting to say anything. It was so quiet that I could hear the wind blowing through the leaves as the sun fell.
It all worked for a few minutes, I could tell the thunder was quieting but whether that was my own doing or the storm passing was beyond me. My eyes started to grow tired behind the pillow, I could feel my body following suite all before a knock came at my door. Sighing loudly, I threw the pillow off of me, where it landed I had no clue. Begrudgingly I walked to the door, practically flinging it open expecting it to be Ron or Seamus and to scold them for interrupting my peace. What I didn’t expect was who I did see behind the door.
against the table as we spoke that day causing me no anger, yet when Ron would do it I’d imagine cutting his entire hand off.
“You got a haircut” What used to be long and flowing hair was now cut short, almost resembling what he wore the last year at Hogwarts. Only it was still different, then it was flat and styled so not a single strand was out of place. Now it looked sorta, well, messy. It was obvious he had run his hand through it countless times, yet it still looked intact. Standing up looking like it had, what was it? Volume! It had volume, so it doesn’t look flat against his head now.
“Well of course I do, I mean I invited him to my house.” I laugh in response, Ron not joining in this time. “Don’t really invite people you hate into your home do you?”
“Oh? And why’s that?”
Mostly a filler chapter since more people liked it than I thought would.
“Wall, Yes Neville I felt the wall” The now throbbing pain in my head from walking head first into the brick wall only becoming worse by Neville’s attempt to cover up his laughter at my pain. “I think I’m going to head home” A hushed okay was the response I got as he was still trying to cover up his laugh. Holding my hand to where I hit my head I squint and nod at him as I walk away.
“He got called away for work, apparently the potions business is very demanding.” Both of them looked at me, Neville still catching his breath before grabbing a drink. Ron nodded, before speaking up.
“Not before tonight” I reply back after taking a sip of the cold water. My breathing had already started to slow. “I never think about things like this.”
The owl came at 10pm, on a friday night, while I was entertaining friends. About anyone you’d expect was there. The twins had brought a whole trunk full of prototypes to hopefully only show people and not actively use in my house. Now that I think about it, I think they closed the trunk a lot easier at the end of the night then earlier in the evening.
trying to eat," he informed the Gryffindor, "so if you would please kindly fuck off, I would be ever so grateful."
Not unlike how Draco's eyes had looked staring into mine. Filled with something I’d never quite seen before. Yet, something I never wanted to stop seeing.
Glancing from his hands back to his eyes “What are you holding?” I ask. His face contorting to confusion and then shock/
“So?” Ron said, sitting in the chair I was going to sit, grabbing a drink off the counter and taking a sip.
“Figured it was only right to bring something since it is your home after all Potter.” Now was my turn to laugh, enunciating ‘Potter’ to replicate how he used to say it back at school. His laugh echoing mine for a sheer moment. “Besides, the shop was on the way. Was far too nice to pass up.”
“Hey” His hand shoots out to grab my arm, quickly I turn to get him to let go. Concern obvious on his face. “I didn’t mean anything by it.”
“You’ve moved that five times already mate, it looks fine.” Ron said as I went to lift the bowl of candy he’d brought.
“Why?”
Walking over to the mirror, I tried to fix the neck of my shirt since I could feel it getting slanted. The cuffs of the sleeves were folded right beneath my elbows. 'It's the perfect length to show your muscles but as if you aren’t trying to’ Ginny’s words rang in my head as I moved one sleeve slightly down my arm. She wasn’t wrong, but I don’t quite know if it was her advice making my arms look this way or the shirt being shrunk a bit in the muggle wash.
The room had gone quiet, nobody really knowing who’s owl it was, or why I was getting an owl this late in the evening. It felt like hours before I slowly walked over to the window. The owl was simply waiting for me to grab the letter. Moments after doing so it found its way to Hedwig's treats.
The crazy amount of cleaning I did, that I didn’t even do when I held the ministry party here last year for the minister himself.  How I dug in my closet for an hour, throwing on every single dress shirt Luna helped me buy over the years, before deciding on the tight fitting black one.  Buying that insanely expensive shampoo that Seamus had been recommending for the past year after I’d gotten Dracos reply. Hell, even the fact that I call him Draco in my head now should’ve  been a goddamn clue. Or the fact that I read it over a hundred times before putting it down, reading the line ‘Dearest Harry’ over and over.
As Draco pours himself a cup of the tea I spell the lights to dim so there's no glare on the screen, he only jumps for a moment this time. Most of his focus on the movie, wonder spread across his face as he tries to focus on every little detail that passes by.
-Harry Potter”
Draco seemed to do the same thing. He didn’t want to fight anymore. I’d never thought of it till after, he was fighting just as much as I was, just with himself. He did what was best for himself just like all of us did. Our fight was over. Maybe he and I can start again. After all, what’s the point of fear and anger when he helped us in the end. Why not let him prove he changed.
“Mate theres a”
If it is all the same to you, I would truly enjoy ‘hanging out’ once again. This time rather, how about you pick the time and place? Maybe then you wouldn’t fumble your words as much.
“Thank you” Draco mumbled before quickly pushing the flowers out towards me, his arms straight out and slightly shaking. Almost pushing the bouquet straight into my nose. “I got these for you.”  His voice cracked towards the end of the sentence, using a very fake cough to cover it up as he held the flowers there, waiting for me to take them.
I hope you enjoyed and I hope I can finally write the hanging out chapter soon. I promise that's exactly how the next one is going to start.
Grabbing the cup of tea out of my hand, almost in slow motion. Our hands grazed one another for a moment, making my head fuzzy as I looked from his eyes to his hand. The fear held in the pit of my stomach now turning into what everyone calls butterflies. I could feel my heart start to quicken as he didn’t move his hand away at first. Just barely, I could see his eyes tilt down to our hands just as mine had.I looked back up at him when he did, his gaze quickly moving off our hands and back onto my own. For a second, nothing happened.
“Is this seat taken?” I ask as soon as I get to his table. He takes a moment to look up from his book before he smiles again, nodding his head in the direction of the empty chair.  As I’m moving to sit he starts to grab the scrap paper next to him and puts it on the page of his book, before slowly closing it and setting it down on the table.
“Honestly Harry we need to get going if we plan on making it to the game at all.” Rang Hermione's voice as what I’m now guessing was Ron's first upon my door.
“How would you helping us win actually help you? Since all it did was drive you away from your family I don’t see how it would’ve actually helped you?” I ask him once we sit down. The birds have disappeared at this point, it was just him and I now.
“I need something to put the flowers in seeing as I don’t own one of those glass things.” I hear him chuckle as I say that, not much, but it is something. “Thank you for them, by the way.” Looking back at him I see the light pink from earlier returning to his face, along with those slight wrinkles around his eyes.
“My house actually.”
Closing the door once again, I turned around to see Draco still sound asleep where I left him. How he slept through all of that I’ll never know. Chuckling at him, knowing full well I would not be able to sleep after all of that. Deciding to instead go make myself a coffee and the tea he picked last night. Maybe he won’t yell at me when he wakes up?
Just a filler chapter sorry :/
“I just did it, without much thinking really.”  He looked at me again after the laughing subsided. Taking his seat back, a much more serious look on his face.
“Didn’t settle quite right with you did it?” I simply nod and he chuckles before he continues. “It wasn’t just the stigma I was afraid of. You see, my father was not the happiest when I betrayed everything he taught me. While in the end neither of my parents genuinely supported that side, my father still held his prejudice.” Taking a moment to look at me, and then back to the sidewalk in front of us. “He was furious that I showed I didn’t agree, I suppose he would’ve rather seen me stay by him then fight for you. At least then it still seemed I believed I was better than you, but I knew as well as everyone I wasn’t.”  I cut him off.
“Better than, truly.” Smiling at his phone, he shut it off and put it back in his coat pocket. “We tend to just hang out and watch movies, the trick is to pick one that isn’t too interesting. So if you want to talk through it you can and you won’t miss anything, and if you don’t you actually watch it.” He skipped over a crack as he said so, his face showed knowing glee.
“Wait!” I call out after him jogging to catch up with him. “Do you need me to walk you somewhere so you can get home?”
“Do you want to be friends? Or more?” Or more? With Draco Malfoy?
“Well this little guy.” Reaching up to scratch the top of the owls head. “He had a broken wing when she got him, broke it as a baby, spent 2 years in the shop before she got him, said he’d been hidden in the back of the place. Funny thing is, she doesn’t even like owls” The owl chirped as Draco was talking, practically shoving himself into his hand. “Not to mention she has shelves full of damaged or once alone trinkets and stuffed animals she’d find at stores.” Walking the owl back over to the perch and setting him down he spoke. “And me of course, don’t know how she realized it before me, but that's the past right?”
Walking back into my kitchen, Ron and Neville followed.
Now the sixth time was different, the sixth time is what proved this owl is exactly like prepubescent Draco Malfoy. Awoken for the last time was when the bowls from last night clattered to the floor. Of course I had to get up and investigate, only to find my kitchen in shambles.
Harry writes back once everyone leaves (Bit of a filler since I haven't updated in a bit)
After five years he’s back within reach. Sitting merely twenty feet away, his sight focused on the book he’s studying.
Thank you for writing me. There was no need to apologize, work gets the best of us. Your owl didn’t quite come at the best time but no harm there, honestly, you might find it quite hilarious. He’s currently sleeping inside the bag of owl treats and I’m planning on leaving him there til morning.
“Maybe?” His hands tighten on my shoulder as I bring my own up to my face. Taking off my glasses before shaking my head. “Fuck Ron.” My breathing quickens again as I start to realize.
“Okay, do you want to try and watch another movie?” His head shot up, either at my question involving the movies he seemed to enjoy, or by the fact that I was not prodding his obvious fear any farther.
“Not knowing why.” He offers me a smile, pulling out one of the stools and patting it, before sitting on the one right next to it. Sitting down he puts his hand on my knee, obviously trying to calm me. It proves true when he summons a bottle of water and hands it to me. “Have thought about why?”
I’ll be awaiting an owl back for whatever day and time you choose based on your work, there’s no pressure, I can wait as long as you need.
Shit. Now, how does one respond to Draco Malfoy?
And there he was, at first I just saw his hair.
“For Draco Malfoy?”
“Ah, yes. I suppose nobody informed you?”
A few minutes later Hermione came up to hug me, excusing herself. The potion mystery still causing chaos apparently. She waved goodbye to the few left and quickly walked out, pulling her phone out and calling someone the moment she stepped out the door. Before quickly coming back into the house.
Ron was surprisingly supportive of my whatever you call it with Draco. “Good on you mate.” He seemed actually happy about the whole situation. Claiming that I needed to get out and talk to people other than my students. He went on and on about how Draco may even be able to help with my teaching, which felt a lot like an insult to me.
Dracos laughter at some joke on the screen was the last thing I heard before I let sleep overcome me.
“Here? In my house?”
“It has to be perfect Ron.” I feel my fists clench as he starts to laugh next to me.
Hermione on the other hand was skeptical. It was more expected, I think out of everyone she has the most reason to not trust him. She even tried to convince me to let her and Ron come with us as a “safety net”, which sounded like another insult to my abilities, to be honest.  Ron shut that down very quickly, saying that I can handle things on my own. I had to go on promising her that if he tried anything I’d get out of there as soon as possible.
Romance? Draco? Well of course not- Fuck. Do I?
I was wrong. In all fairness, he didn’t yell the moment he woke up. Rather when he caught me staring at him, sipping my coffee I made maybe twenty minutes ago?
“It’s too crowded” Draco said the moment I got to the restaurant. “I went in and could barely even hear my own thoughts” He seemed slightly on edge and starting to bounce back and forth. Yet, he seemed to forget his hands were full.
Requests for any type of writing (besides nsfw) are open on my tumblr @plutodexay! Thank you for reading!
“Right on time.”
There will be a part 2 to this I promise!! I'm going to write it over the course of a few days so I can get my best ideas and input from my friend who writes much more often.
As if sensing I was looking at him, he looks up at me. Shocked at first but then he showed a knowing smile, reminiscent of how he’d look getting a question correctly in class. I smiled back in only what I can imagine as awkward. He looks back down at his book after a few moments.
“Do you want to meet up again?” I ask him, hopeful.
Sadly it will be a few more days before I can return to London. This business truly takes a lot of attention, as annoying as it is.
“You would have liked it, or rather the person running it says she just opened last week.”
I felt Draco stir as they kept banging on the door, quickly I reached for my wand and cast a silencing charm on the door. Their voices fell quiet as I saw the magic work, Draco's head lying still again upon my shoulder, his hand reaching to my other one as his breathing slowed.
“Oh Potter.” Draco sighed, sounding almost defeated. He seemed to be contemplating how to go along with this, and at this moment I feel like I’m talking to Hermione; she always has to reword whatever she says so I actually understand. It’s not my fault she sounds like a 1800’s textbook.
“Yea why not?” He asked, going to throw away his own drink before joining me again. “The woman I’ve been seeing recently? Her and I watch movies all the time at our places.” Pulling out his muggle phone that Hermione made him get, he pulled up a picture of them. It looked like his living room. And there they were, just sitting on his couch in nightwear, all smiles and just, happy looking.
“It really is” I said absentmindedly, my eyes nowhere near the screen.
I’ll be awaiting a letter back, but please let my owl rest for a bit before doing so. If not he’ll tear up the parchment the moment you give it to him.
“And- you know her name?” I must’ve looked like an idiot by the laughter that came out of Draco.
“I know you’re not that oblivious.” He responded quickly. “You must notice the changes as the pages go on.”
“Why not?” Ginny cut him off.
“Yeah, a movie could work.”  Pulling out my own phone, I typed in his description of what type of movie we should watch. “Do you think I should get snacks too?”
“Yeah, it’s going great.” We're standing in front of the door now, I open it for him and he walks out halfway before turning around. “Make sure you write him back before you sleep, otherwise you’ll forget.” He says before walking down the street.
“I suppose we should actually talk, since that was the premise of this.” Looking away from me and taking a deep breath before talking again. “Putting myself in this situation, it may be best if you ask me something you want to know? So I can help fill in any of the gaps, since it seems no one informed you about me over the years” He isn’t wrong, Ron and Hermione wouldn't tell me if they knew he left. Neville told me he was unaware of anything anyone did, after all, he tends to stick to himself and his plants. Recently, he has started taking interest in a Ravenclaw girl who was at school with us. Hopefully, I’m no longer the only person he can rant to about his plants now.
Sighing, I walked over to him to tie the parchment to his leg and then opened the window, more than ready to rid my house of him. Only for him to rub against my hand and nibble the tip of my finger. Looking back up at me before biting hard on my finger before flying out. It really makes sense why this is Draco Malfoy's owl.
I added the owl part from the previous eighth chapter, It deleted some comments but I feel it works better chapter wise.
I could try and explain why it's been months, but its all gibberish. I'm an 18 year old bisexual woman who is going to college next year. I feel like thats the easiet way to explain that. I'm forcing myself to write tonight for my other story and I've already started on pt2 of this so hopefully Im not a hipocritical idiot :)
The walk continues, Draco reveals a bit more about his past.
Meeting up at the restaurant
“I said I don’t know Ron!” I scream back at him, my hand whipping around and knocking the small glass onto the floor as I try to face him. The shattering echoing as Ron looks at me, completely stunned. Only my breathing and the slight dripping of my drink off the counter could be heard.
“Well, who’s it from?” Shouted Ron from his seat on the floor. Everyone humming in agreement.
“It's just kinda ridiculous, doing all of this for him” His hand goes to point in every direction. From the constantly reheating tea kettle on the table that Hermione took days to teach me how to do. To the kitchen floor, where we could practically see our own reflection.
“You think you were broken?” Finally unshrinking and with silent victory walking over to the sink to fill it.
“So what?”
That's when I hear the knock at the door.
Dearest Harry,
(See the end of the chapter for
I am so sorry this took so long! I didn't expect school to get the best of me but it really did. Whenever I have motivation, which was rare to begin with, I throw all of it into school work so I don't fail my senior year (I took a majority of creative classes this year and a college and pre-college course so). I really am trying to come up with a better schedule but I have a feelingI'm just going to have to sacrifice sleep to write these (like I am now since I have to get up in 6 hours, but it's okay because I can nap between classes!) So I hope you enjoy it, its the longest chapter yet at 2288 words!
“What do you mean?” I wasn’t exactly following him.
“Um- yeah, I’m alright just a bit tired” I awkwardly pushed out, trying to add a chuckle while rubbing my hand along the back of my neck to make myself not seem so stiff. “Are you?”He looked up at me almost with a puzzled look, after a few moments he seemed to remember what state he was in and let out a soft chuckle.
Sitting there for a moment, I reread the short yet somehow mesmerizing letter multiple times. Was it over some imaginary line, I don’t really think there is a line, not that I’ve put anyway. I never knew what would come out of any of this and I still don’t.
“Thank you.” Red started to creep up on his face, spilling down to his neck and ears.
Sighing, I decided to cave. “Draco fell asleep on my couch and I don't want to wake him” Closing my eyes quickly, waiting for the yelling or enamored judgment, nothing came. Peeking through closed eyes I saw Ron’s classic smirk, while Hermione looked, well, annoyed to say the least. Finally making eye contact with Ron he winked and nudged Hermione to leave.
“What in the hell is Draco Malfoy owling you for?” Seamus asked, way too loudly. I could feel everyone staring at me. There eyes not moving as I slowly turn around, ready to face the wrath of the age-old Gryffindor vs Slytherin rivalry. Just because he helped us doesn’t mean everyone forgave him.
It took him over a week to owl me. With anybody else this wouldn’t have been that big of a deal, but this is Draco Malfoy. The guy who would throw out his robes if so much as one stitch came loose. Last time he owled me it took 8 hours, maybe even shorter because I woke up with his owl already waiting for me.
“Did you want to do something else?” He shook his head no as he looked back at me. As he did his chest began to rise slower, hands unclenching, muttering something as he crossed his legs. “Sorry I didn’t hear that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You really think I should just watch a movie with him?”
“I ordered you coffee already, it should be out in a minute.” He spoke up once I sat down, nodding towards the receipt on the table. Of course he’d already paid for it, since he never stops arguing when people won’t let him pay for things.
“It’s from Neville,sent me a- vase is what it’s called apparently, for the flowers you bought last night” I said as I finally grabbed it, the owl above chirping as I did.
Laying him down completely and gently sliding my hands out from under him, I take a second just to look at him. The way his hair is shining in the sunlight peeking through my windows. The slight smile etched on his face as he once again digs his head deeper into the pillow, a sigh of what I hope is content barely making any noise. His fingers gripping the blanket he somehow wrapped around himself. Everything about him just looked so peaceful and undefiantly beautiful.
Leaving him to ransack my kitchen, I went up to my room to write the owl. I still hadn’t thought of where we could go. I don’t really go anywhere, everyone just comes to me, so picking somewhere was-
I took to Hogwarts, as did Neville. I think we were both done fighting the moment it was over. At first, we both went back to help rebuild, we were the only ones who showed up every day. I got to know him more in that year than I did the entire time at school. The thought of being on the constant verge of a dark lord killing you really wasn’t good for making friends it seems.  After we got everything together again McGonagall offered us full-time spots. Justifying that beating Voldemort was enough proof that I could teach defense. Neville though, apparently he fit the qualifications in 5th year for herbology.
“That is what I said.” Again he chuckled, refusing to make eye contact with me. He seemed to notice his wand and, stealthy he moved it out of its place and used it to cast a quick drying spell on himself. After doing so he was much more comfortable walking into my home, taking the same seat on the couch he did when we watched the movies.
“This is the last family portrait we took before I realized he was wrong.” He looked, younger than I would’ve thought. It looked to be second or third year. Flipping through the book again he points to another photo “This is the last one we ever took as a family, or rather, being on speaking terms with one another.” It was right before sixth year, you could tell because Bellatrix was in the background. Putting the book back in his pocket he just sat there.
“You’re not your Father.” I say quickly, hoping this at least helps calm him down, or at least get control of the situation this time. It seems to, the sobs becoming quieter. “If you were anything like him you wouldn’t have even looked my way when you saw me.” It was true, I’ve had multiple run ins with Lucius, and every time he acts as if I’m not even there. Never have I figured out why. ‘Mione seems to think it’s because I’m a reminder that he lost. A reminder that he failed over and over again. Ron seems to think he just hates me. I think it's both.
Hope this wasn't too long of a wait! I'm writing this as I'm in a sociology class and started it when I was in my college English class
“Well, no” We both started laughing at that. “The letter went as expected I guess?” He nodded to me as I spoke, his anxious foot tapping coming to a halt. A small smile crept up onto his face, and he leaned his elbows on the table, exaggerating his movements.
“I know you don’t.”
“Can we watch another?” Draco said, the first thing he's spoke the entire film. His eyes wide and a small smile stretched across his face. Both hands wrapped around the mug I had given him the hour before. Rubbing my eyes I notice that the sun had completely gone down outside, the stars shining clear and bright.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Goodbye, Harry” Smiling I turn back to him.
And this owl, this tiny ass owl, was just sitting there. Perched on the backs of one of the kitchen stools ‘mione got me this past year. Just staring at me, head ever so slightly tilted at me. As if in confusion, like it didn’t just destroy my kitchen. After staring at me for a few moments, the owl decided to go back to where it landed the night before; looking down at the scroll I had brought down the first time he woke me up.
Very slowly I reached out to grab them, our hands just slightly brushing beside one another before he quickly pulled his hands away. Running them through his hair once again before putting them by his sides. The rings on his right shining bright as my porch light reflect off of them just right.
We kept walking as normal, silence filling the air around us as it normally does. Only the passing cars and birds creating the only noise around us. I couldn’t stop thinking about what he had said the entire time until I got home. Did it go well or was Neville being sarcastic? The whole falling asleep on me somehow then me basically cuddling up to him isn’t exactly how friends ‘hangouts’ go, especially when said ‘friend’ used to be someone you hated. The whole situation was confusing, it was two friends hanging out right? That’s all it was, we’re friends now, we’ve talked, he’s opened up, we’re friends so that's all it was.
“Dear Harry”
“You don’t? Even after reading the letter” He responded back, a slight smirk on his face as the owl tilted his head with him.
But this Draco? He was no longer the Lucius Malfoy direct copy, he wasn’t the death eater's pride and joy, no longer Voldemort's secret weapon against me. He wasn’t predictable. He wasn’t the draco I once knew, but did I ever actually know him? I couldn’t predict his next move, whether he was going to yell at me or just walk out the door.
“Wait, you know who this owl is?”
Not knowing what to do I put my hand on his shoulder. I could feel his breathing quicken and how he was shaking. All I could hear was him mumbling nonsense over and over again, as if reminding himself of something. I’d never thought I’d see him like this. Somehow this was different from that one day in the bathroom. Admittedly I was angry, I couldn’t think straight and I only really saw rage. That was the closest I’ve gotten to seeing him vulnerable like this. I’d wished for so long that I would’ve done something different.
So now it was just Ron and I, and due to the fact he’d obviously ate a whole bowl of candy I figured he wasn’t leaving any time soon.
Sincerely,
Nodding back I just sit there as Ron heads to grab his things. So bogus excuse of needing to meet up with the twins barely registering. Just the sheer thought of Draco running through my head.
“Then there you go! Just ask him to come here!” He gets up off my bed and pats me on the shoulder before walking to the door. “Make sure to clean up before you do, the kitchen floor is really sticky for some reason. Almost like someone spilled a lot of sugar.” Holding myself back from killing him I nod and wave as I hear his footsteps go downstairs and the front door open and close.
"I don’t know what a ‘movie’ is, so I don’t know what to expect” Oh, I guessed I had figured he had gone into the muggle world when he left. Pink turned red as he looked back to the television. Remembering how I explained it to Neville when he’d first been asked to go to one by that girl. Now that I think of it, he had been quite scared too, maybe it wasn’t because it was his first date since the yule ball.
Remembering the Gryffindor part of me, I start to walk towards his table. The adrenaline going through me reminded me of catching the snitch.
“You don’t?” He has walked back over to the couch, once again grabbing the blanket, only this time resting it on his lap. Watching me as I struggled to move the vase onto the table, I heard him chuckle as I placed the flowers inside and water starting to overflow. Rushing to grab towels, I heard him laugh. Stopping for a moment I looked at him, his head was buried into the blanket as a stifled laugh rang throughout the rooms.
“It made it hell.” He said louder now, sitting up once again and looking at me. His eyes were puffy and it looked as if he had running muggle makeup that you see in the movies. Did he wear makeup for this? “I know I was too young to realize how horrible of a person he was. Even when I realized it I was too scared to change, I was supposed to be him, so I made myself feel as if I didn’t have a chance.” Looking at him, I instinctively reach out to tuck a fallen piece of hair back behind his ear. His eyes follow my movement but he doesn’t stop me, just stares in confusion as I then reach into my pocket and hand him a tissue I had in one of those plastic muggle things.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It felt right.” Finally looking him in the eyes. “I just really need everything to be perfect.” I sigh out, my breathing getting quick as I try to walk to finally get the drink I was going after.
Finally putting on my jacket I grab my keys and start walking towards the restaurant. My only thought being what could all of this turn into.
“McGonagall thought it was a good idea. We spent most of our time thereafter the war,  didn't really want to leave in the end.” It was the truth, I felt as if I left that I’d be leaving without a part of myself.  We walked in silence again for a bit, it was a comfortable silence, like when Ron and I have to wait and see if one of his ideas blows up. “You can continue with your answer if you still want.”
Thank you all so much for reading. I do have another part planned but with it being the weekend and me not being in the best place mentally it may take a bit. I want it to be good for you all so I don't want to rush, especially with the dialogue. I will be keeping this as fluff as I can.
Pining and awkward Draco along with some very subtle friend self-inserts
“I think it's quite mature of Harry, I always thought they’d have been a very good pair.” Luna said out of the blue. Her words seemingly shut everyone up. Mere seconds later everyone had gone back to what they were doing beforehand.
“Why France? Couldn’t find a job around here” With his skill, it shouldn’t have been hard. No matter how much of a prat he was, he was still one of the smartest in that whole castle.
Ron reaches his hand down, waiting for me to grab it. Pulling me up before putting the drink far out of my reach. Mumbling about magic and how I always forget wizarding things. I just stood there, my heart practically beating out of my chest.
Ron had showed up early, bringing twenty times more candy than I needed him to. I don’t really know why, but he was convinced that everyone that would be attending would need two bowls of candy to themselves. Which goes to show why I’m the one always hosting the get togethers. My poor coffee table had at least ten bowls on it alone, that left hardly any room for people to actually put their drinks on the damn thing.
“Are you alright?” Draco whispered, pulling me out my daze.
How his hair flowed the first day I saw him after so long. The tapping of his fingers
“Mate for the last time you're going to be late” Came shouted from outside the front door, followed by constant pounding. Reaching my hand up to rub my eyes, I felt them brush against something soft. Looking down I instantly noticed
“I steam cleaned the carpet, Petunia didn’t even make me do that.”
“Well, there weren’t too many people there. Just me, a lone girl, and  this couple off to the corner, who seemed to be playfully arguing about whether or not the shorter really needed this big bouquet of yellow daisies.” Stretching his arms rather quickly he continues. “The lone girl had been constantly picking up different sets of flowers. Going between these colorful lilies and sunflowers the size of her head. Believe she left with both if I’m not mistaken." He stops talking abruptly as I head back to the kitchen, not without running into a chair in the process.
As soon as the door opened all I saw was a flash of red and green, granted, the color combination is not my favorite, I wasn’t scared. As quickly as they showed up, they disappeared.
“We need to know his excuse for leaving us on edge!” He said exasperated, acting as if he might faint. “How dare he leave us waiting this long for a letter!” Neville's laughter could be heard all throughout the kitchen. Ron slowly joined him. Shortly all of us were laughing at ourselves, the whole situation seems ridiculous.
“Did you want to talk about anything else?”
“Mione told me there was a huge potions raid a few nights ago in France, both the French and our ministry are freaking out. If anything that’s probably why he got called away.”  It’d make sense, some potion ingredients are so rare that the ministry will launch undercover missions to find them if they so much get out of place.
“I hate to be a bother.” She whispered to me, her hand covering the microphone on her phone. “Can I borrow a jacket? It’s much windier than I expected.” I nodded to her before grabbing one of mine out of the hall closest. She grabbed it and threw it on, balancing her phone against her shoulder. Hugging me again she walked out again, this time making it farther than my front porch.
“They do sound nice tonight” Finally looking at him I notice he is looking at the ground, trying to focus on something other than me. “Is there anything you wanted to talk about tonight?” I ask, this causes him to look at me. He sighs before fixing his posture and pulling that smile again. Still, I don’t quite understand how it looks like that, how he could look like that.
(Filler)
“No, you know how she is with that stuff.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What is?”
Draco doesn't like storms, but he does like space documentaries
I still don’t know what to even think about all of this. The fact that I was so quick to agree that day in the cafe still scares me. Years of my life were spent avoiding him, in fear of him. And now here I am, standing next to him on a dimly lit street sipping hot chocolate as if this was the most normal thing to happen.
He never meant for Katie Bell or the Weasel to get hurt; he just wanted to keep himself and his family safe. He was already too far gone; there was no going back for him. All he had was his pride, and even that was falling apart at the seams.
Draco hadn't been sure about how he was supposed to feel. Technically, he and Pansy were betrothed to be married someday, and so dating each other wouldn't have been out if the ordinary; in fact, some would probably say that it was expected of them, but to Draco, it just seemed weird. Off. Strangely uncomfortable.
Draco did not want to put his best friend through such a possibility.
He was Asexual.
"Aren't you supposed to be in class?" Draco asked the other boy, partly out of curiosity but mostly out of the hope that that would somehow get Harry off of his back and far away from him.
Anyways, a Slytherin like him couldn't very well just let such an opportunity pass. He took full advantage, creating badges and feeding information about Potter to that Skeeter woman. It had made him feel proud seeing people wearing his badges, made him feel vindicated like he was finally getting even.
They had combined the new first years with those that were supposed to join the year before, while the school was being rebuilt, which was necessary seeing as very few parents were sending their children to Hogwarts after the disaster of the last few years.
started to become a lot friendlier with each other now that the war was over, but the Slytherin was in no mood to deal with Potter's mother-henning this early in the morning.
"What the actual fuck?!"
"Have a nice rest, Draco."
"Back to the dorms," he replied. "No point in returning to class at this point, and I don't feel like going to any of the other classes."
He also found out about Asexuality.
He stopped Crabbe from killing Granger, sure, but it was his pride and desperation that led them there. He wasn't able to stop Crabbe from burning the room down with Fiendfyre, which inevitably led to his death. It was his fault. He should've been able to stop him.
The yule ball ended up being quite fun. Draco was dressed impeccably in a sparkling white dress robe ordered from Madam Malkins made of the best fabrics that money could buy. It was no exaggeration to say that the Malfoy heir looked ethereal.
As a child, such thoughts were barely, if at all, present in his mind. There were far more important things for a young boy to be worried about, such as how to get out of wearing that scratchy and uncomfortable set of robes that his mother had instructed him to wear to the dinner party. Draco had always just assumed that one day he would find someone and live happily ever after just like his parents.
Yeah. He tried not to think about it.
Later on, when Dumbledore gave Potter and his friends those additional points, cheating Slytherin out of the House Cup they had all been ecstatic to win, Draco would wonder what he even saw in that green-eyed jerk.
Both his attempts failed. He hurt others. He hurt innocent people.
The two continued bantering and joking until Draco suddenly found himself outside of his dorm room door. He hadn't even noticed that they had started walking.
"Oh my god! Look who's being a child now!"
"I do not stalk you! I… just happen to be keeping an eye on you to make sure you're staying out of trouble."
The end of the battle passed in a blur; Potter was alive, Voldemort was dead. He and his family had been placed on trial where Potter of all people had testified for him and his mother. His father went to Azkaban, but he managed to get a reduced sentence of 3 years instead of life.
He was still giggling a little by the end of his mini-rant, but Harry looked on the verge of a mental breakdown. Luna was just eating her toast with a knife and fork.
How he had wished that it would all be over.
She let him wallow in his self-hatred and regret, letting him rest his head on her lap, gently running her fingers through his hair while loudly proclaiming how her poor Draco had been attacked by a horrid beast. She knew he couldn't allow people to know the real reason he was upset.
The biggest shock, though, was the developing friendship between him and Potter.
Placing his hands on his cheeks, he noted how warm and flushed they were. Was he
Potter's face grew redder and redder at Draco's teasing sarcasm.
"Ah, Potter," he gasped when he finally caught his breath, wiping away the tears of laughter from his eyes. "You really should consider going into comedy. At this rate, I won't even need to pitch myself off the Astronomy Tower to end my misery. Just imagine the headline: Death Eater Scum dies of Laughter - The Saviour Strikes again!"
"And even if you don't, so what? You're Draco bloody Malfoy, you don't need to waste your time on such trivial things like the rest of us simpletons. And you
Harry started to look more concerned.
It wasn't unheard of in wizarding society for a witch or wizard to dabble in a bit of same-sex romance, but there was still a kind of stigma around it. There were very few openly… bent wizards out there as having such preferences could potentially damage one's reputation for the rest of their life.
"Like that'll stop you from being immature."
The Dark Lord seemed like he was winning. Draco decided to have one last-ditch effort to try to capture Potter. He may want him to win, but the survival of his family came first. He had to try; he had to. For the sake of his parents, their lives, and the shambles of his pride.
The weird amalgamation of panic and peace had been so overwhelming that he didn't even notice Snape's arrival and himself getting saved.
"So… Malfoy, how are y-"
"Good morning, Luna," he greeted. "Could you please tell Potter that he should get a hobby other than stalking and annoying the daylights out of me?"
love that damn snake.
"Draco!"
Thank goodness Pansy felt the same way. They simply knew each other too well; if anything, they were more like siblings to each other.
So when he heard Harry's voice calling his name, he had to hold in an annoyed sigh of frustration. Of all times, the-boy-who-lived just had to be wandering the halls while he was supposed to be in class.
There was a rumor that they were dating. How strange.
love, Hun. Like how you love your mother, and how you love spending rainy days indoors reading by the window, and how you loved that pet snake you got on your seventh birthday who ran away; you cried for a week over that."
He wasn't in the mood for...people right then. His day had been shit; first, he had discovered that the door to his dorm had been vandalized at some point between potions and herbology when he went to retrieve his notes for DADA. Then, right before lunch, he had been cornered by a bunch of sixths and seventh years who shot curses and insults at him while he lay on the floor. He dropped by the Hospital Wing, where he had hoped to quickly grab a healing potion and return to whatever he had been doing before. However, despite what he had hoped, the room was not vacant; Madame Pomfrey sat at her desk, looking through some papers.
The Dark Lord had declared Harry dead. The anguished cries of all of Potter's friends rang in his ears. Granger, Weasley, Luna, Longbottom; they were all absolutely devastated. But they didn't give up. They didn't submit to the Dark Lord just because he had won. They were going to fight him to their very last breath. Because they weren't cowards.
“Maybe you need to” Grabbing the bottle out of my hand and putting it on the bar beside us, he removes his hand from my knee before continuing. “You’ve never done this much cleaning in well, I think since the Dursleys mate.” A slight chuckle arose from the both of us.
The longest chapter yet!
Throwing my wand onto the ground I lay my head back down, slowly wrapping my hands around Draco. As I do so, he burrows his head further into my chest.
He didn’t do either, actually. Slowly his glare holding my own stare softened. Going from anger to slight confusion, his eyebrows furrowed together as he got up. Letting the blanket fall from his chest, he carefully, as if the ground was covered with glass, walked over to me. When he got to me he watched my face for a moment, maybe waiting for a Weasley prank to insue when he got too close. After waiting for a few seconds, he caved.
“Don’t think I’m capable of it on my own?”
Time had seemingly stopped when that owl came. It was like everyone had noticed the random owl at my window, at the exact same time. The owl was almost as composed as Draco, it just waited there, as if it had all the time in the world.
Some part of me doesn’t care, he’s practically a different person than I knew back at school. I’ve spent the past few years trying to get past everything that happened, to for once, live a somewhat normal life. Shouldn’t this go with it? I mean everything is so-
“I didn’t think of it until you said it honestly. Didn’t even think I was into blokes.” Thinking about it now I should’ve known. I’d caught myself watching the quidditch games a little too closely back at school.
“I don’t really have a plan if I’m being honest.” I spoke up after we got a bit of a ways away from the coffee shop. Quickly I rushed to throw away my drink before walking back besides Neville.
--------
Draco’s owl is an exact replica of how he was most of Hogwarts. Six times, the little shit woke me up six times. At first it was just flying across my room, and yes, I’ll admit I am a light sleeper so this didn’t annoy me. The second time was chirping, Hedwig and him seemed to be having quite the conversation perched right outside my door. They only stopped ‘talking’ to one another when I got up, kind of like they wanted me to believe I was only hearing things. The third, fourth, and fifth were very similar, the owl was just really loud. He just felt the need to do the loudest things he could do. Walking around instead of flying, knocking things off the counter to see if it’d wake me ect. Half the time I just had to pretend to be asleep, for some reason I thought that’d stop him.
“Well I guess the thing to think about is, where do you want to go with this?” Glancing towards me before continuing. “Like, where do you want this relationship to go with him?”
“It’s alright.” I tell him, patting his shoulder before walking him to the door. “I’m glad you guys are getting along, you seem to really like her.”
“See you tomorrow Draco”.
Best regards,
“It looks beautiful doesn’t it” Draco spoke out of the blue, his eyes were blown wide and focused on the night sky on the screen.
On a walk, Harry and Draco just talk,  like real people do.
We’d started walking along the sidewalk, it was typical for us. Every Saturday afternoon when we aren’t at Hogwarts we meet up here. Sitting at the table talking for a few minutes before getting up and walking as the place got crowded. We walk the same sidewalk every single time. Kind of like we’re so used to one another back at the castle that even the repetitiveness of it all doesn’t stop us.
“So.” He looked up at me before continuing. “How’d the letter go.”
Not knowing what we were going to do now since apparently the building was far too loud. “So do you want to reschedule? Or just forget about this whole thing?” I ask him. I’d rather him have more control over all of this. Ron told me it’d be smart that way. To allow him to take a bit more control so he feels comfortable, given if need be I could getaway.
Shit, maybe I am into Draco Malfoy.
“Okay,” I replied instantly. Before looking at the time and realizing I’m late for a meeting. “I have to go but maybe we can meet again?” Looking at me he smiles again.
