Harry grinned, “Who’s Frank?”
“Sure, why did you have me use the Potter ring and not the Gaunt ring?”
Greeted Ron's wobbly script.
Thankfully Molly drew the circle for herself reciting the same spell that Sirius had spoken earlier.
Harry sighed, another magical thing he didn’t know about, “She says she wants you to make a wizards Oath. I don’t know what that is.”
“Wait.” Hermione interjected, “What’s all this ‘magically emancipated’ and ‘become of age’ aren’t those the same?”
“You think you could run from me? You’ve got another thing coming, Freak!” His breathing was hard and his steps were slower since he thought he had the advantage.
and Harry’s sort of calm stomach dropped to his shoes. That was the mail flap. He sucked in a break and slowly headed down the hallway, slowly making his way and hoping it was the wind that caused the noise but no. On the welcome mat, there was a cream envelope with a familiar wax seal on it. He picked it up with trembling hands.
He would try something without a waistcoat first.
Hermione pulled back, and her happy face was now pensive.
“Yeah, that’s me thank you for uh, taking your time for helping me.” Harry held out a hand and the Goblin stared at it, rose an eyebrow before reaching out his own hand which was also wrinkled, but mores o than Jortook’s, and shook Harry’s hand once.
“Please take a seat and wait till your stop is called. You may ask for refreshments but we have a right to refuse you or make you pay more than you ought to- so no smart mouthing!” He turned around and shouted something at the bus driver and Harry had just barely managed to take a seat when the bus took off.
dark path. But that’s the past!” Sirius waved away his solemn demeanor being covered up by enthusiasm. “Tell me everything about those muggles and how you got away from them. You gave Molly a good fright, no tracking spell we used could find you, you know! Even actively tracking Hedwig was useless.”
Sidra squeezed gently on his arm and he allowed that comfort to soothe his ego. He wasn’t alone, she could help. So he forced his muscles to relax and looked around for something to focus on. His eyes glanced over the bark of the trees and away from the entrance to Surrey. He settled back onto Sidra and her twinkling scales, her body expanding with her gentle breaths, the soothing weight on his arm.
Harry nodded and rubbed at his forehead when he sat and reached over to start grabbing a serving of the pancakes.
“I’ll be damned.”
She cooed at him and settled back into the nook of the tree.
Sidra observed as he walked back to Number 4 Surrey.
They walked further down their steps echoed against the walls.
eat?”
Sirius grins, “Oh? Wizard gossip?”
The buzz that had once been soft came alive and burst across his hand and crawled up his arm. He held his breath and soon all of him was buzzing from head to foot until something clicked, and the gate swung inward silently.  And the house hidden behind the magic dispersed, revealing the house behind it.
Adafrid noded, “That’s a legitimate concern, and one we will be discussing later, but the matter of sussetance is a tad more important as of the present moment. On the mantle in the main room should be a pot full of floo dust. Toss the dust and say ‘Pavia and Semer’s Tavern’ and a green flame should appear.”
“Sometimes old is good.” Harry responded, “This place feels so old and so new at the same time.”
Sirius comes over to Gaunt Mansion.
This place wasn’t going to disappear when he went to Hogwarts, he could still feel the wards in the back of his mind. He took a deep breath and shut the latches to his trunk. Tomorrow was a brand new day, and he was going to face it head on.
Even in the blistering heat people seemed to be enjoying themselves, which was a lot better than the sullen wilted messes that Privet Drive would leave behind. Seeing the laughing kids and smiling adults and water being freely exchanged was a nice change of pace.
He swung it open and revealed a room swathed in…stolen Hogwarts curtains and blankets? Harry turned to Sirius with the quiet question and he laughed, throwing his head back.
His breath was coming short. His thoughts coming too quickly to make sense of much of anything other than the main goal: get out of the house as quickly as possible.
One foot in front of the other quickly quickly quickly.
for once.
your moves.”
“That’s also true. I suppose we’ll need to come up with another solution.”
He cast and he felt the pull come from inside and exit the wand like a breath of air. The spoon lifted with hardly any trouble at all. Expected, of course, but exciting none-the-less!  He flicked his wand and the spoon gave a bit of a spin. He was quietly glowing with pride when Dobby popped back in.
“What is it
Harry was about to finite his own spell but Sidra hissed for him to stop.
The last thing Harry needs that summer is for everyone to try and kill him. Again.
“Shall we board the carriage now?” She suggests, “I believe we’re holding up the line.”
“…defensive sap?”
Hendret inclined his head, “A valuable question. It is a simple answer: your family name is Potter, that is who you were born as. The Gaunt ring, while connected to you by blood, is more distant contractually speaking. The same will apply to the Black ring once retrieved.”
Both were ‘wells’ of magic… If he thought enough about it he could feel the familiar tingle of magic, but it was content to remain in its usual form, it wasn’t as willing to build up so he could use his own magic to attempt to make a breeze.
Sidra agreed as they reached the stairs that lead up to the front door.
He exited his room and headed for Sidra’s sunning window and he cleared his throat and straightened his shoulders.
While he was checking out of the book shop, he asked for directions to the food market and giddily followed the directions to an alley off the alley. Otherwise known as:
He woke up the next morning to a car door slamming. The front door slammed and large harsh footsteps marched their way up the stairs.
I think I might know why the Fide-“
With a fairy successful trip all he had left to do was spend a friendly afternoon with his friends, who should be waiting for him in the leaky cauldron.
Dudley stared down Harry with wide eyes and an open mouth. “So, what’re you cursed or what?”
“Can’t we take the floo?”
“Under my cloak, he likes it in warm dark spaces. He’ll probably sleep through this whole trip-“
Dobby waited expectantly for Harry and he was bouncing on his feet and Harry looked at…everything that Dobby had gotten.
“Uh, not really? I have some galleons…maybe a snack?”
“You can’t see a damn thing?” Sirius supplied and sat in the chair by his desk, “Yeah. Don’t worry there a much bigger version of the crest in the ‘family room’ a skull, some stars, an arm holding a saber…bird of some sort. All pretentious if you ask me.”
He protested.
“I’ve been safe, and you lot? Ron told me you’ve been off cleaning some secret project. Am I allowed to know now?”
Harry nodded and put the necklace around his neck, “Thanks, I’ll have to thank Adafrid too.”
Hedwig interrupted his thought process by gliding through the wards with a letter on her leg.
Sirius rose his eyebrows, “Oh? And what did you do to earn it’s graces?”
“Yeah.” Harry insists and even reach up to pet the horse and it snorted indifferently at his touch. “They’re right here large and have wings like a bat.”
Harry hummed to himself looking it over and checking the dates. It should be fine if he went the week before…if not he could owl order what he hadn’t gotten while he was out.
Sirius, again, motioned for him not to worry, “Honestly, it’s nothing important. You might get some invitations for galas and balls and charities but it’s not like the old days where you had to collect taxes and build orphanages after a war.”
“One galleon and seven sickles please.”
Silence fell over the room, “Uh, if it helps, I don’t think it was random?”
He wasn’t alone in this he had to remind himself. Sirius would know what to do and if he didn’t, then Sidra could help. He took a deep breath and forced himself to relax. The final statue in front of the wards glowed a blue color and the Cherub moved this time with the snake.
“Alright, Harry?” Sirius asked, and Harry nodded.
got them for you?”
“Troubling. Either the tavern no longer exists or my floo has been disconnected.”
“What do you want Draco?” Pansy stretched her arms over her head showing off her bikini. Pansy’s bikini was green and black, which went with her black hair and pale skin. Draco wore a similar pair of swimming trunks. Draco and Pansy’s parents believed they were dating on their way to getting married, Draco had yet to come out to anyone other than Pansy, and Pansy’s parents believed she was just going through a phase. If anyone found at Draco’s sexuality Draco doubted he would be able to handle it.
“Malfoy I’m so sorry,” looking at Potters face made Draco’s world swim in front of him. He and Potter had become somewhat of friends since the beginning of last year when he told Potter about the plan to kill Sirius. Harry had helped him establish himself in the order and he had helped Harry by giving him all the information he needed.
Spread eagle on the floor was the bartender, his green lifeless eyes looked up at the ceiling while the hundred of little cuts on him bled. Draco knew that no muggle could get that many cuts on a person, a wizard had to have killed the man who lays in front of him. But as far as Draco knew Pansy and him were the only two wizards on the cruise. Draco knew the spell well, it was the same spell Harry used on him sixth year in the bathroom. Draco shivered thinking that this could have been him if Snape hadn’t found him in time.
“Draco I’m so sorry,” Harry cried out walking towards Draco. Harry stood right next to Draco one hand hovering over Draco’s face. Draco looked right back at Harry daring him to do something. Harry dropped his hand letting it rest on the bed, he hung his head looking at his hand. Draco took Harry’s hand in his and kissed Harry’s knuckle.
“I’m sorry Potter but can you leave me alone? I honestly can’t understand you I think I need more sleep. Can we talk at school?” Potter looked defeated but Draco couldn’t figure out why. Draco really was tired, he was in no state to deal with the voices the bombarded his brain. It was difficult enough to focus with the amount of potions running through his veins. So Draco fell into a fitful sleep trying his best to ignore the noises.
It was a muggle cruise so Draco couldn’t even do any magic. Pansy loved it, she had already flirted with most of the girls and some of the guys. Draco hadn’t bothered flirting with anyone, he wasn’t very good at flirting anyways. Pansy had tried to encourage him to talk to some of the cuter men that caught Draco’s eye, but Drac refused forcefully dragging Pansy out of the room when a cute boy entered.
“Bad news guys, this mission just turned a lot more complicated. I searched the suspect’s room and found nothing, so unless you found something in here we are going to need to go undercover. Also, I found a link between the three, each has a family member in Askaban for working with the dark lord,” Hermione explained fully stepping into the room. Draco could feel Pansy pull on his hair, his own breath caught at that. Draco’s father and Pansy’s mother were both in Askaban for the same reason.
“Hello, Draco how are you feeling?” The witch is a kind looking lady with graying hair. She has a very motherly feel about her and Draco is soothed being near her. Draco had always loved his mother more than his father. She waves her wand about seemingly checking Draco over to make sure everything was going as planned.
Harry wanted to laugh at the cute idea of calling his nightmares
“Yeah! Him, he was our year at school with me and the other lot. He was always claiming we never included him in anything like pranks so…” Sirius shrugged and had a lofty chuckle, walking over to his desk, “Let’s just say Frank never complained after that.”
time?” Ginny and Harry cajole at the same time. Luna giggles as she boards, and the carriage starts heading up to the castle.
No one in that group was particularly fit, so Harry was sure he could give them the slip. Damn if only he could hide like Sidra!
Hendret handed it to Harry. The crest was small and compact but it was easy to spot the lion, it was surrounded by scrolling that looked like cloth and it had bustles of…
Mrs. Weasley smiled, but it was the sort of smile he assumed was one of those smiles that tried to pretend she wasn’t worried sick. Even after all the time he’s spent with this family he’s still uncertain how much concern she actually has for him, so he decided to continue.
“I’m sorry about that. Kreature was difficult even when he was 20 years younger.”
“You’ve managed to find yourself a well protected area. I can’t remember the last time I had to offer a piece of magic to an unplottable guardian.”
inviting Sirius over.
Harry hummed and Sidra crawled into his lap, coiling herself, her weight tangible her visibility none.
Diagon Alley was the same as it usually was, but this time around the energy was different. In the way that no one was looking at Harry. Everyone went about their day without even giving him a second glance and he smiled.
Harry sighed and thought about his magic, how it felt to use it. He looked up at the full moon like the snake has asked him too, imagining the moon as some kind of fountain he could drink from. He reached up a bit like he could touch it, which he couldn’t, and tried to think of the moonbeam as the ‘drips’ from the fountain described.
She took out her wand, and made a complicated and lengthy spell motion, when she finish with a tight flourish down, an invisible shield opened up to let them inside.
When they separated Dobby grinned and nodded before snapping his fingers and popping away.
He waved Harry off, “It’s the least I can do. You are my godson after all. Oh, and I managed to finish this for you, catch!” Sirius tossed something at Harry, and four years of learning to catch a small object took over and he caught the shinning object.
Harry looked at the wand he had set down in the chair next to Sidra.
in sweat. A morning shower was definitely in order, especially since his head was pounding so viciously.
It was no forbidden forest but it was preferable over the Acromantia, angry Centaurs and blast ended skrewts.  The forest itself was probably no more than an acre but it was peaceful. It was quiet and it wasn’t attacking him outright. The tree’s weren’t very tall and he could still clearly see the moon but if he angled himself just right he couldn’t see the suburb anymore.
He was grinning from ear to ear.
“Huh?”
Hermione rolled her eyes, “You’ll also have to do your schoolwork.”
Silence and warmth leached back into the area. Harry was breathing hard from exertion from his magic and the fear that was finally settling in. He walked over to Dudley and tried to get his attention.
He chuckled a little bit and Sidra made this trilling hiss of pleasure. Harry looked back up at the ceiling and started counting the crack again, but as a way to pass the time in a warmer place than before.
His fingers started buzzing.
This time Harry furrowed his brows, “But I’m still underage. I’m not allowed.”
He clenched his jaw a little, what’s one more secret they kept from him?
Harry groaned and shoved the rings back, “I don’t wanna know.”
He opened his mouth to admonish Dobby but the elf was looking at him with such wide exited eyes and Harry couldn’t do it. He closed his mouth and pasted on a smile.
And Adafrid was a speaker. And Harry is a speaker.
The way she hissed and her tensed up body it was so strange to see and Harry felt compelled to follow her command and picked it up. While his hand was close to the desk she climbed up his arm, but in a way that made it look like she wasn’t really crawling onto
“Pavia and Semer’s Tavern!” He carefully enunciated to the fireplace before tossing in the powder.
“What?”
“Very good sir, in fact I have a delivery owl available if you want this delivered.”
don’t compare prefect duties to chess. Don’t ruin chess for me!”
just clears up everything.
Hendret nodded, “That can be arranged. Thank you for your patronage. Would you like the ancestry tapestry placed in storage?”
“This was a ring commissioned to us quite recently within the last 200 years. My studies are of older specimens. However, if I could take a gander, then I would say it would be because over the years snakes have been vilified, and the customer wanted imagery of peace, if you notice the snake is standing sentinel in the hand of a cherub and is not aggressive.”
“Indeed, and these are your keys. The trust vault, the Potter vault, the Gaunt vault, and the Black vault. Would you like me to reinstate your floo network at the Gaunt Manor as well?”
Harry hummed and looked down at himself, “Uh, consider it camouflage. I blend in easier and people don’t bother me as much.”
Harry couldn’t help but laughed and went, “Okay okay I guess I have to read it on my own.”
“I know a family crest is supposed to represent the family in some way but…”
Not that the locks were ever used anymore. They hung on his door as a brutal reminder of the what if's. Despite the threats that Moody had made at the start of the summer.
Sirius shrugged, “Better than giving him the satisfaction of using his god-awful alias. It was something we came up with in 6
hurt!” Petunia cried, handing her son a rubbish bin which Dudley used to his advantage to empty his stomach. Harry quietly thanked his cousin for giving him the mercy of not puking on him.
“Hey.” He greeted just as everyone turned to look at him and everyone grinned.
Sidra hissed, almost sadly as she waded through the brush to get to the front entrance.
He rolled his eyes, “Gee, if you two wanted to go on a date the least you could do was tell me!”
The goblin was looking at one paper writing on another one, and when Harry approached he raised one wrinkled hand to signal to wait a moment and Harry nodded. The goblin finished writing and he looked over his glasses to Harry.
“EMANCIPATED?” She shouted and glared at the people who glaced their way, her face getting meaner until the patrons looked away. Mrs. Weasley took a deep breath and she grabbed Harry’s hands, “I should’ve known that Tournament wouldn’t have finished with you when it ended. There so much- oh but that’s not why I’m here… we have to get back! Something dangerous has happened and we have to re-establish some magical protections! Harry, please come with us- I don’t want you going off again and getting hurt.”
Sirius nodded and placed his wand hand ontop of the tiny stone hand of the cherub and it glowed, the eyes flashed a blue and the Cherub, where it had looked solemn and serious it gave a small smile.
“You give it an offering of magic.”
“Woah! Not around the neck!”
It held him captive. Werewolves in a terribly long maze. Letter with words he couldn’t read and a cup with a glow like a will O’ the wisp and he knew if he grabbed it then nothing would be the same. He didn’t know how but there was Cedric breathless and excited. So they grabbed the goblet together.
“Do you know how this is going to work?”
family doing in my home.”
The washroom was just as small as you’d imagine it would be on a train, but it wasn’t that bad. It gave him enough privacy to plug the sink and put warm water in the basin and Sidra slid into it with a satisfied hiss.
Harry’s heart was in his throat and his stomach in his vision became red. He crumpled the letter and he stomped up the stairs and he tore it to pieces before letting them fall into his pitiful cracked rubbish bin. His breathing was hard and he wanted to yell to kick and scream. He finally had something good in his life and already people were trying to take it away from him!
“You are the master of the house now, the wards have long accepted you as the new owner. The wards are very special and seldom ever make a wrong decision.”
“They want the assets in that vault doing something other than gathering dust, Harry. If it isn’t complimentary, quote section 6 b in the Treasury Charters.”
“I accept your word Sirius black.” Harry looked at the white ring and put his hand into it, and Sirius took his hand and shook, the wring expanded for a moment and split into two, wrapping one half around Harry’s wrist and a half around Sirius’s and then disappeared.
“How about you meet Adafrid? I’m sure you two have a lot you can talk about.”
Harry wasn’t sure if he was alive anymore. His heart beat, his lungs breathed but even the nightmares had stopped making his blood race. It was just another reality in his broken world.
“Ah, not really possible.” Sirius said with a sigh, rifling around in different drawers, “The war… it wasn’t kind. It took your parents, and it also took Neville’s.” He laughed, but it wasn’t a kind laugh as he knelt down, to open the bottom drawers of his desk, “Remus was the one who had to tell me, of course, and I sometimes wonder who has it worse. AH, there.” Sirius stood up and showed off the ring. “Here we are! The black family sigil ring. Sorry, it might stink of an unwashed house elf. Kreature had it uh…safeguarded amongst his things.”
“For the last time it was molding, the mirror was cursed and removed before she was born, and she is
“I’ve been able to see them since first year. My mother passed away when I was a little girl.” Luna shared, she kept a light tone, but there was something dim behind her pale blue eyes.
Harry frowned in confusion, “
Harry giggled.
Sidra hissed, it was a hiss that was lonely, still mourning and filled with grief,
It was very posh, and harry looked through the different shirts and waistcoats to try on something.
“Uh, yeah. Put it in the regular Potter vault, please.”
the first page started with Hermione's crisp style.
“Stop it right now!
Harry Made Sirius dinner that evening after giving him a little something to nosh on for lunch and they talked about the house and what was going on. Harry mentioned feeling cautious about leaving the chickens alone.
Sidra chided.
“I am
“Well, it’s new to you. That’s all that really matters.” Sirius patted him on the back. “What’s the name of this place?”
Harry hissed softly to Sidra,
Dobby showed him how the quick grow seeds worked, helped Harry understand the watering procedures and such. Dobby helped organized the pantry and the wizard Ice Box. Dobby showed harry how the stove worked and even assisted with making new meals.
Harry hummed and swallowed back the bile. There was a wailing growling sound when they got to the top of the stairs and Sirius sighed.
Vernon grumbled and held his hand out for the cup of Coffee that Petunia was already handing him. Harry grabbed the trowel and the ratty gloves he was allowed to wear.
never
Sidra followed Harry into the bathroom. He looked expectantly up at him and he rolled his eyes, turing the nearby bin into a rock for her to perch on and soak up the warm steam.
Sidra hissed and she really did look sick. Ready to puke up the mouth that Harry had summoned for her just that morning.
She didn’t look convinced, but she snapped back to attention, looking around again. “We better get inside. Who knows who’s out and about? Come along dears, I’ll make us all tea.”
“You may look over the details in your own time, the bank doesn’t close for a few hours yet.”
“OUT. I want you OUT of this house!” Vernon shouted and Harry tried to keep his breathing calm.
“There are a couple of vinyards and a housing property. I would start with the housing property.”
“Yeah. Yeah, I’m good. Very good. Great even.” His eyes just burned a little and he sniffed, “I- I’m just…”
Harry was nodding along, “Yes, I understand, but what does that mean?”
year or so as some of our classmates got a little too fanatical.”
“This winged horses, do the carriages no longer pull themselves?”
.” Neville bemoans.
He pointed his wand at the seats and cast the spell again, the spell cleaned that just as easily and Harry grinned and even let out a giggle as he continued to cast the spell at the different spaces around him. He stayed away from the mantel or anything perhaps too delicate for spell work but the fact he was doing
Harry did as asked and the ring warmed up before shrinking to the proper size.
Harry folded the parchments up and placed them back in the envelope Hermione had sent. He walked back to the living area and Hedwig was waiting and Harry offered her the letter.
Harry even tried a second time, but with the same result. Not good.
Harry asked and Sidra nodded. Harry opened the door.
“Mister Harry Potter Sir!” Dobby cried out with glee. “What can Dobby be doing for you sir?”
Harry didn’t have enough time to put up a shield and the Mimbulus swole- and then it exploded sending sap everywhere and oh god the
The storeroom was the first door across from the stairs and he opened up and was met with the familiar smell of dust. He looked for the standing mirror and bee-lined for that, not bothering to look at anything else. Indeed, there was a chest by the mirror and Harry took a deep breath and kneeled in front of the pandora’s box of charity and he didn’t even know if he was going to
Harry hummed still petting her gently.
Harry nodded and he went to his trunk to fish out paper or parchment and he grabbed one of his few ballpoint pens and wrote down a list:
When they saw that Harry was the only thing keeping Dudley up on his two feet both of them turned white as sheets and Pentunia cried out and Harry handed off his cousin to more caring hands.
It was comforting, if only to an extent, but he looked at the wand. Adafrid’s wand. A wizards wand long since passed.
Harry frowned at Adafrid and sighed, “Fine, at the very least I’ll take a look at them.”
“Nothing happened.”
“Everything all-right?” Ginny’s voice came through and Harry took a deep awful breath to respond.
“Here we are, please step into the room Mister Potter.” Jortook said unlocking another door and Harry nodded in thanks before stepping through.
Hermione gave him a look, but apparently it wasn’t important enough to pry, “We were extremely worried about you, Harry! Where have you been!” She slapped his arm and Harry tried his best not to flinch. He wasn’t sure he succeeded.
His eyes were half-lidded as he breathed, the thoughts running at a thousand miles an hour the world around him a blur as he placed the fresh razor at his thigh and he cut. Multiple shallow cuts. The blood dripped thinly and he watched it flow feeling the sting and feeling calmer.
“Very good give me your hand Mister Potter so that you will not drip blood like a badly tuned faucet.”
Sirius looked at the fireplace with raised eyebrows, “It’s connected?”
Hermione looked like she wanted to say something more, but Remus approached, “Harry, we need to talk to you about the Fidelus. Hermione, Ron, can you two go upstairs, please? This shouldn’t take long.”
” Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia haven’t tried to touch him since 3
“What? Can’t take the truth there Potty?”
“I suppose so,” Hermione frowned, looking Harry up and down and tugged at one of his shirt sleeves, “Aside from that, what’s with the outfit?”
Sirius patted Harry’s back, “That’s the spirit! Now, let’s see what other hoops I have to jump through, hm?”
“Somehow I get the feeling that Dobby had been itching to help me out for quite a while.”
Harry looked over the tunics and waist coats that he had to choose from. Cream tunic with dark blue waist coat? Yeah, that sounded like a good combo. Harry smiled and got dressed.
The new hallway dipped down at an angle and was lit by lamps, but there didn’t appear to be any heat coming from them.
“The spellwork is amazing.” Harry said, “I wonder how he got the lights to do that.”
Specifically, Trevor had decided he didn’t want to be under Neville’s robe anymore and hopped out and onto the first thing that he saw.
Harry rolled his eyes, “Her humbleness knows no bounds. But what
“Yeah, and the fruit trees. He used his money that he’s earned from Hogwarts.”
“Sorry, these are hand-me-downs from my cousin. I don’t really have any clothes of my own.”
Adafrid looked Harry over, “Is this why you have an untreated curse scar on your forehead?”
“If you don’t mind, I would like you to run an errand for me.”
Molly shooshed and shushed, “That is
The rest of the time was spent chatting on other stuff, while Remus refused to tell the others what he is teaching them this year for DADA, wanting them to know only when they turn up for the class. Sirius was talking to Seamus and Dean about Quidditch and Ginny and Hermione were discussing about the issues they can bring up for the prefect meeting. The only people who were quiet were Harry and Draco, who were just sitting there thinking. They caught each other's eyes and Draco indicated that they should talk. Draco got up and went into their room, sitting on his bed. After a minute, Harry walked in, and came to a stop and leant on the post of Dean's bed, facing Draco.
The snake placed her head on Harry’s knee and Harry felt a twinge of…something in his chest and he stroked the larger body of the creature. The scales were smooth, when he touched the snake something inside him unraveled a little. Like a string coming loose.
“Yeah, He uh. He killed my parents. The killing curse was his favorite method. He tried to kill me with the same spell, but mum sacrificed herself and somehow that protected me.”
“Malfoy?” He asked aloud and Draco- no- Malfoy looked back and the soft eyes turned hard and Harry was pulled back up.
“It’s quite inflamed.” Adafrid pointed out, “I’m certain that it was given to you by this, Voldemort you mentioned?”
“Hey! What can I get you cutie?” The bartender winked at Draco setting down the cloth he was using to clean. The bartender had fluffy brown hair that Draco wanted to touch. He also had stunning green eyes that reminded him too much of a certain chosen one. Draco was certain his face was bright red. He struggled to form a thought other than an exclamation mark. Draco wished he had asked Pansy to come with him.
So at nine o’clock sharp Draco was outside the door labeled on the napkin clutched tightly in his hand. Draco knocked and when he didn’t hear anything he knocked again. Twenty minutes passed before Draco was considering just turning around. A small groan stopped him in his steps, it was coming from the bartenders’ room. Before he could stop himself Draco spelled the door open. He pushed it open slowly and fell backward when the door was fully opened.
This was the last class of Harry's day, and he couldn't wait for it to be over. Time seemed to be working against him as students stayed late to ask him questions. He rushed them out the door promising to be around early tomorrow morning. Harry gathered his stuff and made his way to his house. Excitement thrummed in his bones.
"Malfoy's deflected," Harry looks at Hermione like she has gone mad. Which Harry thinks she might have, why else would she have such a silly idea.
Draco had apologized to the people he hurt, he had down countless interviews trying to laminate he was sorry. Draco donated almost everything he had and retired to the muggle world finding it calming to be just another nameless face. All in all, everything was going really well for him. Harry was getting married, Ginny had finally said yes, and while that hurt Draco was happy Harry was happy. Draco was settled and honestly enjoyed his life.
"That is if they even go to this school," Harry hit his head on the table when he saw his friends exchange that look. They had been exchanging that look a lot lately.
Draco doesn’t wake up in his bed Thursday morning, which isn’t that strange everything considered. What is strange is the bandaids wrapped around his chest and the white sterile feel of a hospital. Draco tried his best to remember why he was here, but all he could remember was wet floors and angry yelling. Draco also thinks he might remember Potter’s green eyes but that doesn’t seem right. It doesn’t take long for a medi-witch to enter his hospital room. That was another strange thing, Draco swore he was at Hogwarts and Hogwarts had its own medical wing.
“How do you want to share the bed?” Draco asked about half an hour later, Harry jolted awake at that and Draco didn’t realize he had fallen asleep. Draco was getting hungry but they should figure out the bedding situation first.
Harry sucked on Draco's neck, right on the spot that drove him mad. He then kissed down Draco's chest taking his time to play with Draco's nipples like Draco liked. Draco pulled slightly on Harry's hair, Draco onew Harry liked it. Harry was about to suck Draco's cock when Draco pulled him away suddenly. Harry was suddenly worried he did something wrong and sat back.
“I can’t promise I’ll always take you along but I’ll try,” and Harry mostly kept his promise.
“You’re one to talk. Plus we aren’t officially dating,” Draco smiled to himself feeling a weight lifted off his shoulder.
Draco lay spread out on the bed, he was surrounded in rose petals and candles where the only source of light in the room. Draco was completely naked his erect cock jutting out in between his bent knees. He had two fingers inside himself shifting his hips slowly while scissoring them. Harry watched him for a moment. He felt his cock hardened as he watched the man he loved fuck himself on his own fingers.
"Are you sure love? Because I'm all for it if you are," Draco moaned in response pushing Harry back onto the bed. Draco straddled Harry's lap and kissed him, as if he was a drowning man and Harry was air. Harry kissed him back with the same amount of passion whispering a quick protection and lubing spell.
“I’m dating Ginny have been for a while now,” Draco smiled at that even if he wanted to cry. Draco’s smile slipped away the second they looked away. Confusion and hurt swirled in Draco’s gut as he watches Ginny pull Harry out of his room. The same motherly looking medi-witch comes in holding a clipboard her face ashen.
Harry grabbed Draco's left arm and rolled up the sleeve. The dark mark scar shone dark against Draco's pale skin. Harry dragged his finger along the words. It said 'conceived after their graduation in the Gryffindor common room after the condom broke'. Harry held back a laugh, who knew his parents were such rebels.
Harry was walking the halls when he heard curses echoing down the hall. Harry turned the corner and saw the huddled form of Draco with three seventh years scowling down at him. Harry could see the dead look in Draco's eyes as he looked off into the middle distance.
“Oh, that was awesome. So you like me?” Harry wears a goofy grin and Draco can’t help but smile back. Draco kisses Harry again letting his hands tangle in Harry’s hair, being close to Harry makes the voices quieter. Which is strange because, in the beginning, he made everything worse. “I’ll take that as a yes?”
"Your mother was nothing but a filthy whore and your father deserved his death," one of the boys sneered casting another curse. Only this time the curse didn't hit. Harry watched with morbid curiosity as Draco transformed from the lithe man he was into a bird-like creature. Harry gasped falling backwards as he realized what this meant.
"I love you Draco and I would be honored to marry you. Now come back to bed and cuddle with me," Harry pulled Draco onto the bed. Harry loved touching Draco, he loved cuddling him the most. Draco pretended not to like it, but the love filled gaze he got when Harry touched him told Harry otherwise.
“Draco I love you,” Draco froze for a moment staring wide-eyed at Harry. The year they had been dating neither ever said those three little words. Draco smiled a half-smile and grabbed Harry’s hand standing a little straighter when he noticed the stares.
By the time they where done with lunch they Harry was covered in lobster juice and chickpea soup. Draco laughed trying to wipe at the messiest parts of Harry’s face. Draco didn’t realize Harry had gone silent until his own laugh died down. Draco realized now how close they were. One of Draco’s hands rested on Harry’s kneck while the other cleaned his face. Draco was kneeling in front of Harry so he was just slightly shorter than the sitting Harry. Harry was looking straight into his eyes and Draco found he couldn’t look away. Draco could feel himself inching forwards eyes not leaving Harry’s green eyes.
“Something like that,” Draco said letting the brightly colored girl lead him to his new room. Draco busied himself placing his bag under his bed and sitting down. The girl offered to stay and keep him company but Draco had sent her away claiming he had a headache. The girl seemed sad but walked away leaving him alone. A disgruntled Harry showed up a little while later wheeling a suitcase and Draco’s other bag. Draco took the stuff letting Harry flop on the bed.
Dean was wondering what Seamus was thinking when he didn't say anything. He wondered if Seamus was too shocked as he seemed to have difficulty breathing and his eyes turned misty. "Seamus?"
Suddenly, flashes of what happened replayed in front of Day. It was as if the pain she had endured caused the painful memories to be locked away till Draco uttered the words. Her body stiffened as Day gave a whimper. The pain she remembered hit her as if her cuts were still unhealed. Day panted as she suddenly remembered what happened. When she looked up at the two boys with tears in her eyes, she suddenly understood why they were sitting so far away. Both of them had scrambled off the bed and looking at her with worry in their eyes, as she looked like she was going through a seizure.
"Harry, when they did the tracing of the other founders' families, they found that the Potters actually descended directly from Godric Gryffindor. The deduction would that the Heir of Gryffindor to be James. However, you were one year old by then. When trying to find the Ravenclaw's heir, we found that we were too late. Hence the Fidelius charm was suggested for your family." Remus continued. "At first we weren't even sure if the heir connection was passed onto you or not by birth, but from what Dumbledore told me, you pulled Gryffindor's sword out of the sorting hat a few years back and in a way, that's the proof that we need that you are the Heir of Gryffindor. Hence for this year, we made extra protection around you."
“What did you want to talk about Potter?” Draco stood tall looking down at Potter, Draco was still taller then Potter and that pleased him greatly. Potter looked torn as he shakes his head and grabbed Draco’s tie. Draco is stiff as a board when he first feels Potter’s lips pressed against his, but he slowly melts into it little by little. Harry is all hard muscles against him and Draco finds himself loving the feel of him pressed against his body. Harry is the first to pull away slightly out of breath.
"Harry will you marry me?" Harry gasped, unable to say anything. Harry nodded, throwing himself over the bed to hug Draco. Harry kissed Draco and it reminded him of his first kiss, it was sloppy and slightly wet. Harry only now realized he was crying tears of joy.
“I was going to see him because he invited me over. I was planning on committing homosexual activities with him. When I found his body I panicked and left him to lay with Pansy. Pansy and I were never and will never be in any type of relationship and that was a cover-up so I wouldn’t have to come out,” Draco pursed his lips at the end feeling everyone’s eyes on him. He swore he could hear two sighs of relief from the other side of the room.
“How long have I been here?” The witch hands him another potion and Draco remembers the fateful night. Harry had cast a spell Draco had never heard of, from what Draco knew about Latin it was some sort of memory or transportation charm. Draco wasn’t quite sure which as he didn’t really hear all of the spell, too busy screaming in pain.
"Well really he's been helping us all along. Second year he gave me the paper on the basilisk, and he gave me the mirror. Third year he talked his father down from expelling Hagrid. I mean just this year he came to Ron and I and apologized admitting he was wrong. He's decided to join our side of the war," Hermione held up a finger for each reason why Harry should trust Draco.
“Pansy it’s not going to take three hours to get ready,” Pansy gave him another look and Draco groaned. “Fine but we are not going too crazy,” Pansy squealed again sounding sort of like a pig. Draco immediately regretted his decision when Pansy started tearing apart his closet. Draco prayed to the stars that Pansy wouldn’t go all out.
"Come on Harry I've been waiting all day for you," Draco said in a breathy tone arching his back as he tweaks with one nipple. Harry stripped from his clothes in record time. He made it to the bed even faster, he started by kissing Draco on the lips. Draco groaned into the kiss arching his body closer to get more friction. Harry put his hand on Draco's hip holding him down.
“Harry help Malfoy pack and move his stuff, the room number will appear on this key card in a couple of minutes. Pansy I’ll help you pack just tell me what to do,” Pansy and Draco move slowly still confused as to what’s going on. Draco stood stock still for a while until he feels a hand land heavily on his shoulder. Draco points his wand at Harry eyes unseeing for a bit. Pansy is the one that calms him down, she holds his hand tightly and talks him through the worst of the panic. She manages to remind him that he’s not at the manor, he’s safe.
“No your mother isn’t allowed in here, no one is. And you’re here because of an accident with Mr. Potter, speaking of him he wishes to see you when you recover,” the witch talks very smoothly, clearly she’s used to dealing with hysterical patients. Draco figures the voices and visions are a by-product of the potions the witch wants him to take.
Draco had been cursed using the Cruciatus curse before but that didn’t make it any less painful. Draco could see the girl laughing and raising her wand again. Only she was stopped by the door being thrown open, Harry and Hermione stormed in both brandishing wands. The girl laughed banishing the two Aurors wands and spelling chains to hold them back. She seemed too happy as the pain finally starts to wane. Draco can see the panic and terror on Harry’s face.
“Don’t worry Potter I know you didn’t, too much of a bloody Gryffindor to think things through,” Potter sat at the edge of the bed wringing his hands. Draco took pity on him and took his hand. Draco held Potter’s hand and refused to look at his face to see his reaction. Draco heard someone begging to be spared, and the cold voice whispering a killing curse. Draco cringed and looked around wide-eyed before realizing Potter was the only other one in the room.
“No way Draco I’m so proud. No wonder he wouldn’t give me his number he doesn’t swing my way. Which makes way more sense than the fact that I’m unattractive,” Pansy very dramatically attempted to flip her hair, which didn’t work because she still wore it in the shoulder-length bob it had been in since school. Draco laughed smiling widely. Pansy always knew what to say to make him feel less nervous. “It’s six so we have three hours to get you ready!”
"Draco, how was the summer? Read any interesting books?" Hermione and Draco started discussing books while Ron and Harry groaned. They soon changed the topic, focusing instead on Voldermort. Draco had some new information.
See soulmarks are words written on a person's left arm, it detailed how the person's soulmate was conceived. It appeared on a wizard's arm around their twelfth birthday. No magic could be used to find the other person, and if a person's soul mate was a muggle then the muggle would get the soulmark.
“Pretty good other than the fact I can’t remember why I’m here?” Draco goes to sit up but his head swirls, he blinks and an image of his ashen-faced mother springs in front of his face. He thinks he hears her voice but when he opens his eyes he can’t see her. “Oh is my mother nearby?”
So sixth year came and went, Dumbledore wasn't killed but no one turned into a Veela. Draco had pulled away half way through the year, it hurt Harry a lot. Hermione said that it might be because of the added stress of school. Harry wasn't sure but let Draco be.
“No the bed’s big enough for both of us, and if either of us is going to take the floor it’s going to be me. Now I’m hungry let’s go get some food,” Harry seemed to like the idea, Draco had to lead the way as Harry didn’t know the cruise ship very well. By the time Draco got to the restaurant, it was nearly empty. It was nearly one and most people had already eaten and were enjoying the summer weather by playing in the pool. Draco took his usual, a nice lobster, while Harry ordered a chickpea soup. Draco crinkled his nose at the soup and Harry laughed slurping it extra messily just to piss off Draco. Harry didn’t like the sound of the lobster shell being cracked so of course, Draco cracked each piece as loud as possible, going so far as to crack one right next to Harry’s ear.
“There are roughly three thousand people on this ship, you and the three other people were the only people with ties to Voldemort. I propose we split you two up, Harry will follow Malfoy and I’ll follow Pansy. We can’t let them be alone for even a second, and they have to get their rooms moved as soon as possible. Harry and I can handle it from here,” Hermione says the last part at the Auror. He nods apparating away and leaving Draco, Harry, Hermione, and Pansy.
“What do you mean dear?” Draco tries to keep the venom out of his voice while he looks at the dreamy smile on Ginny’s face. Draco had never really paid attention to her before, she always seemed like just another Harry fan to him.
“Um, I’ll have some white wine,” Draco stumbled out inching at his own neck. The bartender laughed grabbing the most expensive bottle and filling a glass. He hands the glass to Draco. Draco takes the glass and looks at it again. He is only looking at it so he doesn’t have to look at the lively eyes of the bartender.
Harry managed to open the door with shaky hands. He dropped his stuff on the floor by the door, Draco didn't like when he did that. Harry followed a trail of red rose petals to their shared room. He pushed open the door drinking in the sight before him.
Harry found himself wishing he had never given Malfoy a chance. Not because Malfoy was doing anything wrong but because he wasn't. Malfoy had been overly polite, he had said sorry, and had helped Harry with the tournaments. He even managed to stop the fight between Ron and Harry, apparently he had yelled at Ron until he saw his errors. Harry had all sorts of feelings he didn't know what to do with.
So Harry went to bed the warm arms of his fiance wrapped around him keeping him warm and safe. In his humble opinion this was the best anniversary ever. At least until Harry figured out a way to top it next year. Harry laughed at the word top before deciding that next anniversary he would let Draco fuck him. They hadn't done that before and Harry was excited to feel what Draco felt.
"Thank you Ron but I think I can say it myself now," Draco appeared with a flourish, he had never lost his flare for being dramatic. He sat down next to Harry and Harry felt better. Draco was a spy for the order so every time Harry saw him Harry knew it might be the last time.
“I love you too Harry,” and for the first time in his life, Draco actually meant those words.
Eighth year was no easier on Harry then any other, only now he shared a room with Draco. Draco had done so much over the course of the war, his parents were killed in the final battle mere minutes after Voldermort was killed. Draco had taken the loss hard and had pulled within himself. Draco barely talked to anyone but Harry, Ron, and Hermione nowadays.
Harry stood in front of his classroom ready to teach the young bright eyed students new things. Harry had applied for the job as a DADA teacher and he got accepted. It didn't hurt that his boyfriend Draco was already the potions teacher. In fact today was their five year anniversary and Draco had promised him something special.
Harry determined Draco was stretched enough, he kissed Draco one more time helping him sit on Harry's dick. Draco took it slowly, falling an inch every couple of seconds. Soon he was fully seated on Harry and they both stopped to take a quick breathe. Harry was embarrassingly close and was thankful for the break. Soon Draco started moving his hips, not up and down but left and right. Harry found that really hot and moaned against Draco's neck sucking another hickey.
“Guess who got the cute bartenders’ room number and an invite to join him in it tonight at nine?” Pansy sat up at that smiling widely. She took the napkin away from Draco squealing when she saw the number. Draco took the paperback and tried to shoosh her. People were giving them strange looks as Draco herded her towards their shared room.
“Malfoy I thought I was going to lose you, Malfoy I wanted to say I…”
Harry had given up trying to find his soulmate, instead he focused on Malfoy. At first he noticed innocent stuff, like how Harry liked it when Malfoy actually smiled. But that had quickly progressed, when Krum asked Malfoy to the dance Harry saw red. It only got worse when Krum pulled Malfoy out of the lake and kissed him. Harry didn't talk to Malfoy until he broke things off with Krum.
Harry hit the spot a few more times, he wrapped his hand around Draco's dick pumping, he knew he wasn't in time with his thrust but was too far gone to care. Draco moaned and was soon cumming all over their chests. Harry followed soon after calling out Draco's name as he buried himself into him.
“Oh isn’t this so sweet! Crucio!” Draco felt waves of pain cover his body again. The girl laughed for a second before pointing her wand at Draco again “Sectumsempra!” Draco screamed, the combination of the two very dark spells very nearly killed him right there. He managed to hold on to consciousness long enough to see Harry and Hermione break free of their chains. Draco managed a shaky smile realizing Pansy would be safe, he almost hoped he would stay asleep this time.
Draco whimpered at the spells, the lubing one always felt funny at first. But he didn't stop kissing Harry. Harry grabbed Draco's ass kissing him hard while he slipped one finger inside of him. Draco thrust back on that finger. Over the next couple of minutes they kissed and Harry added more fingers. Draco had become a panting mess taking to kissing Harry's neck lazy thrusting against Harry's fingers.
“Here’s my room number, I’m free at nine if you want to swing by. Oh, and the drinks on the house,” Draco took the paper muttering out a thank you and running out of the bar. The last thing he heard was the laugh of the bartender. Draco made it to Pansy and collapsed in his chair sighing heavily. Pansy didn’t seem to notice so Draco sighed again. On the fifth sigh, Pansy finally looked over at Draco.
“Hey whatcha doing here so early?” Draco never got a response, the pink-haired girl smiled a wide smile and whispered a spell. By the time Draco realized he was being magically knocked out it was too late for him to alert Harry. Draco could only hope Harry woke up before he bled to death or before Pansy was taken.
“It’s not your fault Harry,” Draco let go of Harry’s hand remembering the things he said before he was attacked. Harry seemed to remember at the same time because he blushed a furious red color and pulled his hand away. Draco’s heart sank, he had started to become closer with Harry and had secretly hoped Harry liked him back.
“What you said about you being ah gay is it true?” Draco nodded not looking at Harry. Harry let out a long breath and when Draco turned to look at him he saw his green eyes glimmering wither determination. “Can I kiss you Draco?” Draco nodded squeaking a little when Harry kissed him. Draco had been kissed by people before, but all those kisses pale in comparison to this kiss. Draco found himself lost in the way Harry’s lips moved against his, in the way Harry tugged lightly on his hair while his own hands explore Harry’s clothed chest.
Draco woke from a horrid dream, he had a vivid image of Granger bleeding out in front of him the word mudblood carved into her arm. Draco didn’t know what was worse, his aunt’s maniacal laughter, Grangers screams of terror, or the way Draco felt calm while carving into his friend’s arm. He hadn’t fallen asleep after that, instead staring at the ceiling in an attempt to distract himself from the screams and voices that fill his head.
Draco was allowed to go back to school a week later, although he was only allowed to go back to attend Dumbledores funeral. Draco sat in the back and Potter found him choosing to sit next to him waving his friends over. They all looked sad when they saw Draco, it made his skin crawl. A calm voice filled his head, he couldn’t exactly hear the words but he understood the tone. Draco had gotten more used to the voices in the last week.
“Wait, I thought the potter vault one had one key?”
have to go to so many lengths to get ready for Sirius, and he didn’t have to do it by hand either! He wasn’t at the Durlsey's! If there was anything that Harry needed to do, he could just go to his room and go grab his wand and get it done in less than a minute!
Sidra huffed.
atrocity is going to be incinerated.”
“Sleep well, Harry.”
Harry blinked and looked for the source of the voice, it was low to the ground, but it didn’t sound like a child.
Harry furrowed his brow, “Sir, I didn’t think anyone was going to be here painting or otherwise.I had already come with the intention of cleaning, at least a little bit. This place means a
Adafrid must have been very wealthy for all of these statues, especially all the snake motifs. Hopefully the house itself wasn’t too pretentious.
The train reached the station in Hogsmeade and Harry was very much relaxed as he spoke with Neville, Ginny, and Luna.
” Hissed a wretchedly horrible familiar voice, and he tried to get to Cedric before the flash of green light. He was never fast enough.
Harry couldn’t help the smile he got with Ron’s letter and he folded them up and put them in his pocket.
It was a soft tingle like his fingers had fallen asleep but it had a feeling to it- a tingle of magic that he had felt only at Hogwarts. He thought harder about holding onto this feeling until his whole hand tingled from the sensation.
He really needed to figure out how to take care of them when he went back to school.
Please take note of the tags! It was pretty obvious in the first chapter but self-harm will be mentioned again in the contents of this chapter! It's a mention and implication, but please take care of yourselves!
He woke up with a shout, and sweat soaking into his bedsheet and singular blanket that was tangled around his legs.
The walk was leisurely and pleasant thanks to the shade of the trees. Harry also suspected it probably had something to do with the stone path. There were these circles carved into them looked exactly the same. Maybe Hermione would know what their purpose was meant for. Maybe he could send her a letter about it.
If only he could get some
“Yeah he got a little turned around but if you give him some chocolate and rest I’m sure he’s be-“
“What’s that, Harry?” Ginny asked and Harry looked back over at her and he motioned to the hairless horse.
“It really was. If it wasn’t thanks to her teaching me about getting a magic boost from the moon my cousin’s soul would’ve been eaten by a dementor.” And his shortly after probably.
and McGonigal owled these meeting schedules and the hall patrol and, mate…how am I going to have enough time to sleep
“What happened!” Vernon demanded getting up and in Harry’s face, Vernon’s face was quickly changing color.
Their excitement grew and they flocked to the area and began foraging for the feed. Right, he should grab the eggs from the coops before they went back inside. He grabbed the basket and one nest as a time levitated the eggs into the basket.
Sure enough, a castle pulled into view and the buss stopped about a mile out. “Castle Arundel!” Stanley announced and Harry stood up and got his things. When he got off there no other people around. He took a deep breath waved Stanley good bye. Stanley tipped his hat walked back into the bus shouting  and the bus sped off in a blur of purple.
Harry clenched his jaw. “Lay off Dudley, go pick on someone else.”
“Sorry.” He said dully, and Malfoy sniffed looking him up and down.
All that happened was a puff of soot and ash coming up. Harry was pretty sure that wasn’t supposed to happen.
Harry frowned and looked at the wand, “
I'm gonna be honest, Sidra is the cutest to write for cause she's an old soul with such a cute way of saying things. See you all in the next installment!
Ron groaned and they headed out of the compartment, when Harry called out, “Don’t let the power go to your head Mini-Percy!”
Harry blinked, “What?”
“Mister Harry Potter sir!” Dobby called out from the main space of the house. Which startled Harry out of his concentration. The spoon clattered onto the table and Harry turned on his heel to head back to Dobby.
“Why not? Right then. I’m guessing the snake has some issues with you inviting me?”
“Huh.” She mumbled and reached for another cookie, “How much power exactly do these old families have?”
Harry didn’t think, he doesn’t remember moving but he does remember the crack of the impact of his fist on Dudley’s face. He remembers the silence of everyone and Dudley’s stunned expression afterward.
“UH…the Goblin’s called it Gaunt Manor?” Harry said, scratching lightly at his chin.
“Understandable.” Molly said, “Let’s parse out the oath then.”
His hand trembled a little and he lifted his right hand, his free hand, and he pressed the knob down revealing the room inside. It had two sides it both had cabinets built into the walls and it was all made from a warm toned wood, at the back was a window that outlook some of the property. Three window panes at the back, they looked like they could swing open but there were vines over the windows keeping them sealed shut.
Sirius rose both eyebrows and set his jaw.
“Oh yes, thanks.” He whispered the address to the tawny owl and it blinked once and grabbed the package  by the strings and flew off. Harry even tipped!
He dug out his transfiguration book and started re-reading the section on 7 main Principles which was boring but familiar and something to do.
Sirius bowed his head, staring at the floor, “Regulus, my little brother, was constantly trying to please Mother. I did everything I could to protect him from her ire, but he always wanted her to be proud. That led him down a
Adafrid looked firm, “Please. I have no use for those items anymore; and if they can assist you, then I am more than willing to give you my own ‘hand-me-downs’
Sidra crawled up to Harry’s shoulder,
Sidra’s warry posture turned to defensive and she melted back into view.
Ron shrugged, “They vote on laws. There are other newer families allowed to weigh in as well. I don’t really know how it works. I’m not really in a position to where it matters.”
Sirius nodded to Harry to continue and Harry took a deep breath.
He wouldn’t look a gift horse in the mouth and he graciously accepted the gift with thanks and he poured a small drizzle onto the cakes and gratefully ate the meal in less than five minutes.
Sirius and Harry both headed upstairs and Molly guided Hermione and Ron into the kitchen.
“Who you talking to Potter?” Came Dudley’s lumbering slurs, probably affected by the heat and he was flanked by other kids from the neighborhood.
Hendret looked over the papers and his wrinkled brow furrowed. “It appears the property is under the Fidelius charm. As the new owner of the property, it will take a simple dispelling form to reveal the name and location to you. Do you wish to do this?”
“All rings forged in Gringotts return magically if those of their majority perish and someone unlawfully attempts to take it. You were allowed to take from a trust fund, but without the ring, no one could touch anything else. It is our way. I doubt Dumbledore had signed the correct contracts. Or perhaps your parent’s killer attempted to take the ring.”
Adafrid pressed his lips into a line, “There is much I have missed. Please, explain how a child, such as yourself, has earned so much ire it earned him the injustice of having a soul sucking wraith set on him like a fox hunt.”
He could hear Dudley and his gang lumbering behind him, but he knew with experience he could out run Dudley and Piers, but the rest of the gang? He had no idea, all he could do was keep on going. Get away- far away so he wouldn’t get his face smashed in.
He shared. “My Aunt Agie got it for me, it’s a type of magical succulent, these leaves are round and full of a defensive sap to ward off predators.”
It was a young man. Older than Harry. Younger than Snape. His hair was fluffy and he was sitting in an armchair in a mirror image of the library. He wore a coat that had eight buttons keeping it shut in a grey fabric, he wasn’t wearing a hat and there was a crow on a stand.
Harry’s face heated up with horror, “Oh I couldn’t possibly-“
and Harry pet her crest with a couple of fingers and she was off, flying through the open window.
It was like the stag was connected to his fingers and with a shout he commanded his patronus with a wave of his arm at the Dementor.
Harry awoke with a gasp before he could see whatever his dream snake self saw and he was
He knelt onto the ground and decided to entertain this fresh oddity.
Adafrid’s smile became just a little sweeter, “
“Yes Harry, and you need to get going. You never know if another one of those Dementors will come along in times like these.” Voldemort then.
Harry wanted to fight, he wanted to feel angry but there was no fight to reach for.
Harry took it back to the library, “I have it.” He said and held it up.
He yawned and took a cursory glance around the living room thinking about the different things to. Dust the shelves, organize the room, prep a luncheon maybe… his stomach was twisting with nervous tension already and he started in the direction of the kitchen to grab a rag to start cleaning. He was in the kitchen by the time remembered that he
Adafrid smiled warmly, “I have full confidence in you.”
“Neville?” Harry gasped and Sirius snapped his fingers and nodded his head.
the fireplace like just before second year.
“Well, to start off I was placed with my muggle relatives. With no mentions of my magical heritage whatsoever. There was also the fact I wasn’t told my mother sacrificed herself for me until after I, uh…accidentally killed my defense professor- but in my defense he was trying to kill me first-“
You let Dudley get attacked by a DEMON?” He shouted and Harry shook his head.
Except.
“You’ll simply have to work on your time management. Think of this like- like chess. You have to
“What’s that you got there, Neville?” He asked softly an Neville looked at his plant and smile.
“Impressive.  I didn’t know that snakes knew about wizard’s oaths.”
“And..what exactly does that mean?”
Dobby looked it over and nodded, “Dobby will be back sir!”
Harry nodded and moved onto the other shoe.
“No flame at all?” Adafrid clarified and Harry nodded.
Sidra. It had to be enough!
oh lord of three houses. That’s a lot of responsibility for a fifteen-year-old.”
He didn’t look entirely happy about that, “Do you feel that way about your brother? According to the Goblin he left everything to you if anything happened to him.”
and we do not discuss
Harry took a deep breath and took off the ring, he then placed the ring as asked for seal down. He prepared himself for nothing to light up but the moment he took his hand away it began to glow!
That stopped the both of them in their tracks and they turned to look at Harry their faces twisted in disgust and readying to correct him, but they stopped both of their eyes widening just a little at seeing what he was wearing. They synchronous actions were a bit barmy but sweet none-the-less. Both grinned and Hermione squealed and attempted to hug the life out of Harry.
"Come on mate. He's actually changed, at least give him a chance," Ron said, not taking his eyes off of Hermione.
Draco tended to try and keep himself calm, he also tried his best to not sleep unless he was exhausted. When his mind was open he had visions of himself in a hospital bed with Harry begging him to come back. He often heard Harry’s desperate voice asking for him back.
"Come on Harry at least try to work with us. Oh Draco wanted to say you're welcome for saving Sirius's life," Harry smiled at the last part hiding it behind his crossed arms. The little crush Harry had in fourth year had only grown worse the following year. Harry nearly kissed Draco last year when he convinced Harry to contact Sirius and ended up saving Sirius's life.
Draco woke up in a pitch-black room his arms tied to a bedpost. He groaned scooting so he could sit up, next to him was the faint shape of a body. He poked it and almost cried with relief when he heard the familiar groan of Pansy. Draco was glad Pansy was alive but was angry she got kidnapped. Pansy was starting to wake up when Draco heard the door being opened and the light being flicked on. The pink-haired girl stood in the doorway twirling with a crazy look in her eyes.
“Draco for the last year and a half you have been under a strong magically curse. This curse made you do the dark lords bidding, no charges are being placed against you as you were not in control of your actions,” The medi-witch keeps going on but Draco tunes her out shock causing his body to freeze.
“Well then ask me out, Potter,” Draco smiled at the use of Harry’s last name. Harry seemed just as happy leaning in close to Draco. Harry rested his chin on Draco’s shoulder nibbling on Draco’s ear.
Pansy didn’t ask any questions and Draco was thankful for that. They fell asleep entangled on the bed, only to wake up to the faint sound of someone knocking on their door. Draco answered the door rubbing his eyes when he suddenly had a wand to the face. Draco held up his hands glancing at Pansy. Pansy seemed to get the message, she grabbed both of their wands and hid them in her sleeves. Draco backed up letting the wizard come fully into his room. Another wizard followed closely behind him and Draco laughed when he met the wizard’s eyes,
