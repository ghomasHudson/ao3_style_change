Draco smiles back at her, thumbing absentmindedly at one of his sleeves. Save Sonja, Daphne, and Pansy, none of the other people from that day in Richmond have visited. He would have admitted them if they had. Talking about the bombings is surprisingly difficult to do with Harry.
“I’m not here to replace your grandmother,” he tells her, lowering his folded newspaper and frowning severely at her.
As he was hoping, it’s enough to make Harry groan, and then they’re struggling out of clothes sticking to their skin like they were painted on, giggling and teasing each other. Draco’s a little shy when Harry lays his larger shirt out beneath them and coaxes him onto his knees, and then presses his chest onto the ground. For all of the weeks they’ve spent exploring each other, they’ve never done it like this. Out in the open, with only the neatly trimmed hedges to hide them from view. What if the groundskeeper walks by? What if they have a guest and one of the elves pops by to find them?
Malfoy is laughing with him. Then he leans in, and they’re sharing air for all of a few moments before Sirius thinks, fuck it all, and captures those supple lips with his own. It's quite possible that Harry will want to kill him. Molly will probably cry. He doesn't even want to think about what Narcissa might do. It doesn't matter. Malfoy's pressing his front to Sirius' like he'd like for them to melt into each other, warm and slender.
Harry finally catches sight of a distinctive silver braid flying about amidst the chaos and knows that he has found Viktorovich at last. Viktorovich is bellowing orders in Russian as he runs, wand drawn. He is as free with the killing curse as any Death Eater, ruthlessly firing bolts of green at any dark robe and silver mask he sees. He pauses to bolster fights and pull people up by their underarms and press his forehead against others’ in a show of support. Several of the Russian wizards fronting their resistance watch him with awe as he passes, and then return to their personal battles with renewed vigor.
Didn't think this chapter needed warnings. I’ve got a bit of a tangent in the end notes that I hope you guys won’t mind reading, but for now, please enjoy this chapter.
He reaches down with his other hand and curls his fingers around Draco’s fist, guiding his strokes. The lowered tempo makes him squirm, and Harry’s cock twitches as the head drags along the soft skin of Draco’s lower back.
Harry bursts out laughing. Draco pouts up at him, which just makes him laugh harder, though he does quiet and tut sympathetically when Draco presses his face into the crook of his neck.
He crosses the room in a few long strides and bends at the waist for a soft kiss. When they part, his thumb smoothes gently over Draco’s bottom lip. “Hi, sweet boy.”
“The Dark Lord made him describe you for me, when they were first talking about marrying us. Even though I could tell he was angry, he gave up being frustrated halfway through and just started bragging about you.”
“Take it from me,” Davies whispers, leaning close, “I’d say Weasley’s family might be okay if you sponsor them. That’s how Smith will probably get off a little better: he apparently gave himself up to Blishwick, who immediately brought him in. In return, Blishwick asked for a little leniency. Are you getting my meaning?”
Lucius surprises them all by joining them for Christmas morning. Unwilling to sit on the floor, he transfigures a nearby coat rack into a chair and watches from a distance.
Immediately, the stranger stiffens and falls onto his back. Whatever is inside his packages audibly shatter. Out of the corner of his eye, Draco can see Mother gaping at him, but he’s too busy staring down in horror at Muggle at their feet to tend to her properly.
The Healer tilts his head and speaks lowly. “He may be more amorous than usual. It’s perfectly normal. Again, the specialist will be able to give you more in-depth advice. Just know that knotting is fine for most of the pregnancy, so long as you are careful about positioning.”
“I was just giving Draco my blessing, but I must offer you my congratulations as well. The Potter family lives on after all,” the other Alpha says, and something in the tone of his voice sours the sentiment.
Father presses his lips tightly together, visibly suppressing a surge of hilarity. Scorpius loves it when Father tries to hold in a laugh because it makes the small dimples he has especially pronounced, like a secret smile. James and Scorpius don’t even bother to try holding it in, and laugh hard enough that it has Scorpius hiccuping. Father bullies them back inside, shaking his head.
“Anezka, listen to me. If I’ve learned one thing over the years, it’s this: people with a cause are always willing to make sacrifices to realize their visions. I get that you meant well. But even if they
as Scorpius and Lily pile onto them, grumbling about stealing the spotlight. Then, like magnets, the two of them shift over to Father, who lets out a laugh and squeezes them back.
Al nods dumbly up at him. Then Draco brings his other hand to Al's face, and the scent of him fills Al's nose. He pulls Draco's fingers into his mouth, savoring the heady taste of his arousal.
It’s a thought that he’s been trying not to entertain, but he can’t help but feel like the man she’d been so excited to marry had killed her. Not directly, of course, not on purpose, but throwing herself in with him had painted a target on her back from two different sides, and it had only been a matter of time before someone followed through.
Some days, Draco is content to sink to his knees and suck Harry into his warm, wet mouth, brightening under Harry's praise as he holds that lovely hair and tells him what to do. The first time Draco looks up at him, squeezing his hips and urging him forward, it takes Harry all of three slow thrusts before he's barrelling into one of the hardest orgasms of his life. Harry fucks his face again, later, guiltily savoring the tears in those gray eyes, the bright pink of his lips swelling around Harry's cock. Some days, Harry bends him over the desk and fucks his thighs, pumping his cock in a deliberately slow counterpoint to his thrusts. Some days, Harry licks Draco until he’s frantic with it, and then he gives him one, two, three, four fingers, stretching him out. His fingers will have to be the substitute for the knot he craves, because they've barreled their way past tradition after tradition already, and there's a part of him that is still wants to give the boy a chance to change his mind.
“Exactly, Professor Potter!” Draco cries. And then he actually stamps his foot. “You’re supposed to--I’m supposed to be
for showing me to the wine cellar, since I know you won’t be drinking any of it for quite some time, and I plan on being rather a thorn in your side,” Sonja replies, warmly.
The fire eats away at one door and destroys the other completely; Harry steps over the remaining flames on the way in. The large room behind is boxily made and chaotically decorated, with high cobblestone walls and stained glass windows. The headmaster has propped himself against his large desk to recover.
He lets out a small grunt when Draco crawls on top of him, shaking. He presses his face into the crook of Harry’s neck, and the wet warmth of tears on his flushed face is enough to wake Harry fully.
As they plan, she butts heads with many of the senior Death Eaters, who don’t like being corrected on fieldwork. They, especially those within the inner circle, tend to receive more specialized assignments. They work well together, but not in significantly large groups. A junior Death Eater might get the chance to join in on those smaller assignments because of nepotism--Draco’s friends come to mind--but their operations tend to be separate. Forcing them to work so closely together is a sign of how desperate Voldemort is to conquer Russia. Harry’s never seen him so drawn and irritable in all of the years since he’s taken the mark.
They share a weak laugh. After a moment, Anezka rises from her seat and joins him on the couch. He turns to face her, and she takes his hand. This close, he can see a lingering redness in the whites of her eyes.
Every now and then, Draco comes to their duels bouncing in excitement. He takes their practices very seriously and has begun purchasing books to study when Harry’s away. Draco has his own Gringotts vault, one that Harry deposits funds into on a weekly basis, but he insists that Draco buy the books under Harry’s name, if only for his safety. It makes him smile every time he is mailed his monthly reports and finds book after book listed underneath the purchases.
After a few moments, Harry’s thrusts ease into slow rocks as he props himself up to kiss at Draco’s flushed face. He’s galled to realize that Harry’s clearing away tears.
“Oh, good. I don’t know how to explain it very well. They were Russian jewelers who would make these for the royal family. This one was given to some empress or another. It’s called the rosebud. I thought it would be more memorable to give you one of these instead of trying to make boiled eggs taste good. I nicked it during one of our recent raids in St. Petersburg.”
“Good. Please, if you want to beat the snot out of each other, you can very well ask me to take you to the Burrow. Understood?”
Draco glances over at the window. The moon is arcing well over the trees, creeping towards the optimal place at the peak of the sky. He reaches out for his wand where it lies on his table nearby, and frowns when he falls just short. With a burst of irritation, he thinks
Harry guides him, murmuring praise and instruction. He quickly loses his words, and muffles his moans into Draco's neck, kissing and licking restlessly over the sweaty skin. At this point, it won't take much. Just being held makes him feel like he could gnash his teeth, and Draco's clear enthusiasm and desire is a heady confidence booster. He comes with a grunt, covering Draco's hand once more. Echoing his earlier desire, Draco brings his hand up to his face and curiously licks over it, and it's Harry's turn to curse as his prick gives a valiant attempt at coming back to life.
“I was visiting Sonja. I should have stayed home. I thought about it, I was so tired… but Mother was visiting a friend, and I didn’t want to be lonely.” Draco whispers.
Uh oh. He only calls Harry that when he’s truly annoyed with him. Harry hasn’t the foggiest what he’s done this time. He’s sometimes convinced that the way he breathes could send Draco on a tear.
And then the Dark Lord lapses into a contemplative silence. Draco glances up at him, and then quickly looks down at the neatly trimmed grass below, unsettled by the deep red of narrowed eyes. One foot in front of the other, he reminds himself.
“I mean it, Harry. I will leave you,” Draco lies. He’s pettily, vindictively thrilled at the panic that crosses Harry’s face for a few euphoric seconds, and then he breaks into a tirade of babbled apologies. “I wouldn’t. I love you, I didn’t mean it…”
“Sweetheart, I really need to go,” Harry says, voice gritty. The finality in his tone is one Draco rarely hears.
They deflate into an over warm heap of shaking limbs, Harry spurting thick ropes of come inside his channel. Harry’s kissing all over his throbbing mark, hands trailing up and down his sides before locking with Draco’s once again. He’s heavy, but Draco likes it, feels safe and settled under his Alpha’s weight. It’s not like he has to tell him that, though.
Father is facing the back wall, with its large, faded portrait of Armand Malfoy. It’s old enough that the thing scarcely moves anymore, that the trademark white-blond of their family looks more like a faded golden brown. Father’s hands are clasped together behind his back, and when he glances over his shoulder, the long tails of his robes slide over the marble floor with an unsettling hiss.
The look of concentration on Draco’s face is familiar and endearing, down to the furrowed brow and pursed lips. He wrinkles his nose. “It all just feels like a lot of work for food you’ll end up eating in about an hour.”
As bright blood bursts past her lips, her wand falls from her hand and clatters onto the cobblestone. Her forehead reddens, and then blood trails from her hairline, down into her eye. With that, every visible orifice begins to bleed—the corners of her eyes, her nostrils, even her ears. She stands trembling for the entire process, awful rattling gasps gurgling in her throat, until so much blood has been expelled from her body that her olive-colored skin is sparsely visible and her robes have begun to stain darker at the shoulders. Some of it drips from her fingertips in great fat drops. Then, with a final gurgling noise, she tumbles to the ground face down, completely unmoving.
“By the Wild,” Amycus groans, “Lucius was holding out on us. You all should have seen them on Beltane--”
Aunt Bella’s dark eyes widen with delight. Draco knows that look. She’s not going to hold back. “Find us in an hour.” Then she reaches out and pinches Draco’s cheek, her customary greeting for him, and leaves in a flurry of white robes. She has always looked out of place when she’s not wearing her customary dark dresses.
He thinks about mentioning the body-binding curse, but he can’t bring himself to do it. If some reporter saw it and wrote something up about it, Harry will find out anyway.
“Your father and I love each other very much! Do you not remember what I told you of our first meeting--”
Draco huffs out a laugh, pulling his favorite stuffed dragon to his chest. Harry brought it from St. Savior’s--it’d been in surprisingly good shape, and mended well with magic. Draco loves the thing, despite its obnoxiously sparkly silver color, which always makes Harry unreasonably happy. He never lets Draco see when he scents it (it looks ridiculous), but by the way Draco’s always cuddling it, he knows it’s well worth the effort.
Father gives him an amused quirk of a smile and then offers his elbow. Draco happily links their arms, feeling briefly and absurdly like he has lost a few years. It’s with a wistful smile that he realizes he hasn’t had Father to himself in almost a year. As the Dark Lord’s influence grew, his need for Father’s work did the same. The days of the two of them taking regular strolls together have long gone, and the last one before this was something of a mess--Draco, newly informed of his impending wedding, begged and cried the entire time in a wholly undignified show of emotion. Father had waited patiently until he tired himself out and then delivered him home, stony-faced. Draco, still embarrassed by the memory, is grateful that they haven’t spoken of it since.
. You'll have to forgive me for how barebones it is. I only really made this account for you all. Direct messages are off because they overwhelm me, but please feel free to ask me anything you'd like (barring questions about when updates will come). When I have the energy I'll start posting extra content like scrapped scenes and general worldbuilding stuff, that sort of thing. As always, please bear with me for moments of silence.
“You’re gushing, baby,” Harry whispers, smiling as Draco whines and throws one arm over his eyes, shy. “Excited?”
“I will show you the way to the floo you requested access to. My elves are busy cooking, and my servants are warded out of that area of the castle. Memorize the way, I will not show you again.” Bolotin says, and then she begins a brisk walk out of the room.
Draco flushes in remembrance. He was one of the people sticking his nose up and making unkind comments in carrying undertones as he walked past her and Milicent Bulstrode. He has one memory of being paired with her for a Herbology project in Fifth Year. She’d patiently set about doing her half of the work, and Draco had been an absolute nightmare. He refused to address her directly if he could help it, made a show of his disgust if they brushed arms or legs or sat too close, and would leave harsh criticisms in the margins of her notes in bright red ink.
“Don’t you bring Harry into this,” Draco hisses back, pointing a finger in her face. “One word from me and he would kill you without hesitation.”
“I can’t help but notice that the two of you have failed to produce an heir, despite your reputation as a very… active couple. Draco, is there anything you need to share with us?” Voldemort asks, making Harry’s heart sink and Draco’s hand tighten in his hold.
It takes only twenty-four hours of witnessing Draco’s moping for Mother to move in. He’d never admit to it if asked, but he’s grateful. She claims the guest bedroom closest to the master suite and then sets about getting him on something like a schedule. After breakfast, he is to help her sort out mail sent her way by other society folk. After that, they hold hands and take walks, seeing the sights, shopping, and entertaining friends. They might take lunch at a nice restaurant or picnic in the garden at St. Savior’s. Then she’ll shoo him to his brewery to make potions, or allow him an hour for a nap before pulling him along to a show at the theater or a soiree or a ball--they all blend together. Before long, the first week of January has passed this way.
“Sweetheart,” Harry says, gripping his upper arms gently. “You have to tell me everything you know.”
Harry has paused and crouched in front of him. He huffs as Harry pulls up the hem of his robes, though he does let out a sigh of relief when Harry transfigures the smart little red heels into padded loafers.
Draco furrows his brows. “Not for Omegas. We learn some defensive charms, but we’re separated from the rest.”
“Pius Thicknesse is vile,” Draco says, raising his voice to drown out Father’s outrage at his words. “I shall happily tell him myself if and when I encounter him again, but you can pass along the message that I would sooner swallow hot coals than ever endure the pain of dissolving a bond to marry him. My womb is not something that you or any other soft-in-the-head nobleman will use for your own gain. If you are really so desperate for a ‘proper Pureblood’ heir, try for another baby with Mother, and pray it is an Alpha.”
“Anyway, he also asked if we’d been, um, ‘presented’ to other families. And I said no, why on Earth would we need that, and he said well what will you do if you want to get married? And I said, marry someone I love, I expect. He looked like he was going to explode.” Scorpius says, a wheezing laugh taking him on the last few words.
“Hey," Harry soothes him. "I'm sorry. I just--when I woke up and you weren’t there, my mind went to the worst places.”
-There is a part that alludes to sexual assault, beginning with the sentence "Harry makes a dubious noise, but says nothing."
Harry shakes hands with the Alphas and Betas, and then looks resignedly uncomfortable when Daphne and Pansy dip into wobbly curtseys. Pansy only just catches herself from falling into the cobblestone, resting her hand against the storefront. The lot of them ask Harry a dizzying amount of questions--about his family, about his estate, about his past. Certainly, they’re making the worst impression ever. It reminds Draco of just how young he really is, and the thought is enough to sober him, just a bit.
That stings a little, and tempers their amusement quickly. Scorpius glances over at James, who’s set his jaw the way he does when he’s staring down a bully at Hogwarts.
He leans away from Harry when he reaches out to hold him, stifling a sob behind his knuckles. Harry glances up at the Healer and his nurse, who both have matching looks of sympathy on their faces. “Can you give us a moment?”
If nothing else, coming home is worth it so he can step through the door and give Father a tight, obnoxious hug. He can feel Father’s laugh rumble through him as a slender hand scores through his hair.
They have to get used to a healer stopping by every other day to check in on Lucius. Al, who has gone his entire life seeing only a certain set of faces in his home, is pretty nervous about it. Who knows who’s talking to who? How far can the secret of a fidelus be stretched? There’s another pit of fears that whisper that they might be going to another funeral soon.
For a moment, it’s quiet enough in the hushed colosseum that Harry is convinced he could hear his own heartbeat with concentration. Then, Smith surprises everyone by breaking out into a dead run. He catches Rosier just off-guard enough that she is unprepared to stop his powerful drop-kick. The crowd explodes into a cacophony of sound, curses and shouts and encouragements firing off as Smith follows up with a blasting curse. It’s blocked by a brilliantly glittering shield charm, sending the flames glancing off in brilliant waves on either side of her, licking towards the front row. Rosier is holding a hand up to her bloody nose, eyes bright with rage.
He hears the scramble of feet as they approach the library, and then the maid holds the door open for Draco’s ridiculous friends, dipping her head respectfully. She’s flush faced, clearly a moment away from tears.
There’s this vibrating energy of nervousness about them as they both glance over at him. “Alright, then, James?” Dad asks, worriedly.
Scorpius pulls on some trainers and makes his way to the garden after stopping by James’ room to borrow his kit. James is fast asleep, messy haired and sprawled out on his bed, which makes Scorpius smile.
, and he gratefully sucks the stale water down in three gulps. “Can you stand? We have to leave. I doubt it’s safe for us to be here.”
James’ memories of that time are spotty. He’d been all of five years old, the twins a bratty terrible two, when the vengeful partner of one of Dad’s biggest targets abducted Father. Father is a powerful magic user in his own right, and his bond with Dad’s magic is a big help, but he’d still been taken. Unbeknownst to him, he’d been carrying Lily, which left him vulnerable. They’d spent days on end with Nan bossing them around the Potter cottage, dad tired and snappy and worried and so grateful to her.
Anyways, I hope you all enjoy this break from our regularly scheduled high-octane stress. Please ignore the fact that none of my interludes seem to be as short as interludes should be.
“I asked if you wanted to picnic after all this,” Harry says, quickly deciding to abandon his earlier question.
It takes a moment for Harry to assemble his reply. “Because working with your father has probably given you a leg up on this sort of thing. Because you’re Draco’s friend, you want him to be safe, and hopefully, that will keep you from telling anyone about this. And, er, also because you probably speak… whatever kind of French this is.”
Harry’s uncorked it and thrown it back before Draco even finishes his sentence. His face tightens in disgust at the taste. Draco sighs. “I would have warned you.”
Greyback bursts into gritty laughter towards the end of the table, joined by Bellatrix and many of the younger Death Eaters assembled. Lucius wrinkles his nose. It is mostly this expression, which he has seen Draco employ regularly, that makes Harry smile. He’s still relieved not to be the one on the receiving end of Snape’s sharp tongue, though. Voldemort allows them a few more moments of laughter before ordering them all to calm themselves. The meeting begins in earnest.
They catch their breath in an easy silence. Harry arranges them into a comfortable enough position, half on their backs and half on their sides, Draco throwing his head back to rest on Harry's chest. Every now and then, Harry grunts and rocks against him, filling him with more come. It's the most he's ever done this when they're tied, but heats are different.
He bends over to kiss Draco’s warm forehead. Then he pulls the blankets back up and leaves before he gives in.
Then she opens the door to the Auror office and bustles inside. Harry stares after her with his stomach churning, knowing that she’s probably right. He sighs, rubbing the back of his neck. How childish of him to hold the entire operation up. He must have set the entire department on edge, wondering if they could survive rushing a Death Eater.
He stares down at the woman, willing her to move, to get up, to brandish that wand at them again. The only thing that happens is that a sizable pool of blood oozes lazily out around her, coppery scent sharp in the air. He retches, and then falls to the ground to empty his stomach.
He trims the rose thorns and liberally cuts peppermint leaves. The valerian he wraps in a neat little bundle, as well as the knot grass. He levitates them into the storage room, where he collects two eggs and finally a moonstone.
They arrive at the Blishwick estate to polite fanfare, fashionably late in matching robes of olive green. Harry immediately shifts into the role of quiet, exasperated husband, greeting guests with polite but short answers. Everyone in the Dark Lord’s favor is used to this, but it doesn’t stop people from trying to be The One That Made Harry Potter Crack. It’s a familiar and tedious process, but the one benefit is that it buffers them from Draco’s parents.
It’s not that he doesn’t want to. It’s just that he can’t shake the feeling that he’s corrupting Draco each and every time they touch.
Harry squeezes one pert arsecheek in his hand. Draco laughingly swats his hand away, kisses his cheek, and makes for the fainting couch Harry bought for this express purpose. He’d installed the thing between two of his tall bookshelves, right underneath the wall scones with their flickering candles. Draco is entirely at home like this, reclining on antique silk velvet with his slender fingers holding the aged journal open. Awash in the golden glow of the candles above, he looks like some princeling from a novel. Harry spends a few minutes just looking at him. He will store this memory, he thinks, put it in a vial for the darker days to come. Draco looks up at him from underneath the fan of his lashes, and then dimples privately down at his journal.
kitchen’ when we passed it? Didn’t you see the bloody collectors’ editions in the libraries? The libraries, plural? And now we’re standing in a
-Finally, Harry and Draco cut each other with a knife for a mating ritual, which begins with the sentence, "Harry throws the vial over his shoulder, which makes the Death Eaters nearby break into low chatter."
His voice is shaky--with excitement or fear or maybe both, which is endearing and a touch more arousing than it has any right to be--but also husky in a way that Harry’s never heard from him before.
His palm tingles. The pressure gently directs his hand back to his chest, and he lets out a relieved sob when he sees that he is completely healed. A final swell of warm air surrounds him, soft as an embrace. The array he drew flickers, and erases itself in a poof of fragrant smoke. Draco immediately presses his hands into the grass, and there is no sign of his blood left behind. He cradles himself and lets out a gasping laugh, rocking back and forth.
“Well, we do. I can’t… I shouldn’t put words in anyone else’s mouth, but I know I’m right. Things may not be the same, but we’re still here.” Hermione says. Then she places a hand on her stomach with a wince.
“Yes. He’s a handful, but I love him. We’re having twins. You’re the first to find out, actually.” Harry says. Him, and the Auror. It’s not at all ethical, but he resigns himself to obviating her lately.
Harry sighs through his nose. “I just don’t feel good about keeping it from him. He asks me about it every now and then. He doesn’t even know I’ve asked you to look at it.”
Draco’s stomach drops. He clears his throat. He has the strange urge to ask if he is in trouble, like he’s some first year at Hogwarts again, being exasperatedly scolded by his Head of House. The Dark Lord has always been in the periphery of Draco’s life. Draco has been in his presence more than the average wizard, as the child of someone in the inner circle. But such intimate meetings with him were rare, and the last time Draco spoke with the Dark Lord in close quarters, he was faced with a warning for passive failings. Who is to say what will happen for his reckless and deliberate disregard for the rules that govern his life?
All of the assembled are sorted into groups. Senior Death Eaters will be housed in one wing, Junior Death Eaters in the other. Support staff are relegated to sharing the servants’ quarters (Colin gives Harry an aggrieved look--he’s had to contend with irritated servants being forced to share their space for almost two years now, as Harry’s assistant), and the Muggleborn foot soldiers will be in the stables. Milicent calmly announces that she will join them, which makes her fellows roll their eyes and sneer, or express wide-eyed confusion. The snow outside the estate is several feet high. Harry is beginning to see why Pansy is so attached.
Harry doesn’t doubt it--family and legacies mean the world to Purebloods--but he can’t help but feel that something vitally important is being omitted. Despite this, the request is reassuring in a strange way. It means, at the very least, that Voldemort has not begun putting strange ideas into his followers’ heads about his and Draco’s lack of heirs.
Draco doesn’t so much as awaken as slide unwillingly into consciousness, his extremities lighting up in uncomfortable tingles. He has to fight to wrench his eyes open, and his vision blurs with tears the moment he succeeds. He turns onto his side, instinctively reaching out for his Alpha, only to be met with cool bed sheets. Swallowing against the surge of disappointment in his belly, Draco lays back against the pillows with a sigh and presses the heels of his hands to his aching eyes as his breathing slows. Once he’s collected himself, he slides out of bed and begins the slow journey to the study at the end of the hall.
Ginny's suggestion was a good one, but the tour is, of course, a disaster. One too many snide remarks from Ron awakens Harry’s old temper like nothing has. Before long they're yelling at each other so loudly that some worried house maids stop by to ensure that everything is okay--the sight of them only makes Ron angrier, so Harry frustratedly dismessmes them.
Draco opens his eyes and raises a brow at him. “You don’t mean that. I seem to remember you saying you love me.”
“I’ll show you how to use the tools,” Harry interrupts him, unable to remove the soothing rumble of his voice.
His stomach is tightening threateningly, the low throb of his knot plumping back up sending a bolt of sensation thrumming through him.
The woman’s smile falls just a bit, but she quickly fixes her face. Harry turns his head so she won’t see him fighting a smile.
The next rumbling BOOM that crashes into the walls makes most of them lose their footing. Draco hits the ground hard, letting out a soft cry of pain as the heel of his palms grind uncomfortably into the polished wood. He doesn’t know what to call the strange instinct that makes him look up, but the sight of the ceiling buckling is chilling. Just as it finally loses its grip on stability, he points his wand skyward and yells, “
He trades hugs and laughter like he trades hair color, aquamarine blue to playfully mimicking Lily’s bright red to a simple brown, babbling happily away about his time at the Ministry. Work as an Auror suits him better than it ever suited Dad, Scorpius thinks, admiring the deep red of his robes as he steps out of the Floo and kicks his soot-covered boots out onto the carpet, which has Father’s nostrils flaring in the way that says he’s just aching to get the vacuum cleaner. It’s like they’re all younger kids playing around the cottage again, little adventures headed by Teddy and James, marching along in a tight little cluster of boisterous laughter and roleplay.
Both of them face him in a rush when he clears his throat and then hides a large yawn behind his hand. The rage on Harry’s face recedes the smallest bit when Draco shoots him a weak smile, but Weasley’s flushed face darkens enough that it almost matches his hair.
He bites his lip, and then he's working his arms out of the sleeves of Al's oversized shirt. He wraps them around his waist to secure the shirt to his torso, and then puls the bralette off. Al can't help the way noise that falls from his lips. He leans in to take one pink nipple into his mouth, while the left rises to cup the weight of the other breast. Draco moans his name, slender fingers sliding into his hair. Al is Draco's opposite in this. The pain of his hair being pulled is good, grounding. Draco will tug on his hair to guide him, and he likes that, likes the surrender of it all. Draco pulls tightly as he rises up onto his knees, sighing when his entrance catches on the throbbing head of Al's cock. He slides down, taking him in with a moan. Al presses his face into Draco's neck, and starts counting back from ten as they both adjust. He can already tell that he's not going to last very long.
Harry blinks rapidly against the sting in his eyes. Hermione had begged and begged a gardener coworker of hers to teach her the spell, back when they were all young taking on their first work assignments. She’d conjure them to make Harry smile, or ease his awful temper, and especially to console him when his frustration at their lives tipped into spells of melancholy. He hadn’t thought she would still be doing it after they stopped talking.
The rest of his clothes follow in short order, though Harry stops him when he starts toying with his stockings. They’re a pale yellow, and lovely against alabaster skin.
“Why? Is it all the talk?” She asks. After a pause, she loudly kisses her teeth. “Anyone says something you don’t like, just remind them of your curse. That’ll shut them right up.”
She has refilled her cup twice, but Draco’s sits on her disk cooled and half-finished, its fragrant scent weakening by the second.
“I’m so empty, I need you inside me,” He gasps out, and then burrows his face against Harry’s neck when the shame follows, vaguely irritated with himself for his fits of shyness.
After calming themselves, they spend a few minutes snogging on the settee, grateful for the privacy. When Harry pulls away, Draco is struck with what is surely an unnecessary amount of petulance. He’s able to convince Harry to kiss him for much longer, until he’s lightheaded and needy and Harry is gently redirecting his hands.
“My husband’s estate is in Newcastle,” Draco begins. He can tell right away that it was the wrong thing to say, as the openness he’d startled onto her face with his question closes quickly off. What a clumsy thing to say! He flushes and clears his throat. “Right. I shouldn’t keep you. I just had a question.”
Harry obligingly slides another finger inside, and a rainfall of curses falls from his lips, which is more arousing than it has any right to be. He knew Draco had a filthy mouth, but not quite so filthy. Harry spreads his fingers, and a pained whimper follows. Hoping to soothe the burn of the stretch, Harry leans in and kisses where Draco's rim is stretched over his fingers. They find a comfortable rhythm, Harry's fingers fucking into Draco's tight heat, Harry's chin wet with him. Draco lets out a grateful sob when Harry tells him to touch himself. One day, Harry thinks, he'll lay Draco out on his back and watch him do it. He wants to see what Draco does to bring himself pleasure--wants to know how he likes his cock to be held, if he ever uses those slender fingers to fuck himself. Draco's deep groan pulls him from his thoughts, and he watches as Draco comes, painting his fingers and the edge of Harry's desk with his release, hole sucking his fingers in. Harry works him through it, and then gently pulls fingers out, popping them into his mouth.
Davies winces. He looks back over to Draco. “Mr. Potter, what you did was no doubt heroic. The people responsible for these attacks were targeting Purebloods, and they were--forgive me for being so direct--quite successful in places. You saved multiple lives, and it would be ridiculous to even begin talks of charging you for anything. You are in a… unique position.” He means Draco’s familial ties to so many of Voldemort’s favorite Death Eaters.
Father, by now used to seeing a foolish idea growing in James’ eyes, tactfully intervenes. “Why don’t I show you to your rooms, Lucius?”
Warm, meandering kisses are pressed along his neck, from the raised flesh of his bondmark to the sensitive space behind his ear. Sighing, Draco leans back into Harry’s embrace. Harry’s hands come to rest on his stomach, sandpapery and warm. Draco’s slender enough that he’s begun to show a little early on his way to twelve weeks, a slight change so small that only the two of them could really pick up on. Harry’s fascination with his belly is a strange but welcome source of confidence.
It’s true, but he’s always been especially susceptible to ribbing. Father doesn’t do it often, which just makes it worse.
Harry climbs onto the bed, and Draco shyly snuggles close, gratified when Harry chuckles and strokes his hair. “The idea is that we shouldn’t have to. I was always taught that we were the nexus of the family, so we would always be safe at home.”
It takes several trilling attempts for the connection to take, and then Draco comes into view, yawning behind his hand.
He asked mostly because he was fearing another fit of temper, but he hadn’t realized how desperately he wanted to ask this until the words have left him. Now, as Black smiles down at his own shaking hands, he waits for the answer with bated breath.
He doesn’t say that it was mostly curiosity that enticed him into accepting. He’s quite sure that Rodolphus knows this. The two of them have scarcely spoken outside of pleasantries or the occasionally shared assignment. Harry has a fairly neutral perception of the older Alpha as a taciturn and focused man, well-liked by Voldemort for his fighting skill and unshakeable calm.
The Healer sighs. He’s an older man with his gray hair pulled into a low ponytail and the casual confidence of most Alphas his age. “He’s worried the baby has been hurt. If that’s true, we can only help if we know exactly what’s wrong.”
Anxiety throbs in his chest the moment they leave, stepping out into the austere hall. It worsens at the sight of the Dark Lord’s companion waiting coiled up by the door. With a low hiss, Nagini stretches out to her considerable length. She slithers lazily alongside them as they walk, thankfully on the Dark Lord’s side.
That first day, Harry patiently guides him through a proper dueling stance, playfully veering away when Draco presses his arse back into his groin, delighted by the thin fabric of his breeches. When he’s finally satisfied with his stance, he says an incantation Draco hasn’t heard in years, and Draco’s wand goes sailing into his husband’s hand as if drawn by magnetism. He’s unable to stop himself from stamping his foot, a spike of defensive irritation curling in his chest.
Usually, he hates that work takes him away from home at odd hours, but for once, leaving is a reprieve. Draco reports that Ron and George show up to eat and then retreat back into their rooms; Hermione and Ginny are kind enough, with Hermione offering comforting advice for early pregnancy.
He leaves for the floo room and is so relieved to end up back at St. Saviors that he collapses into a chair the moment he returns. He can see that the hem of his robes are dusty with floo powder, a rare oversight, which just serves to agitate him further. He pillows his face in his hands and allows himself to cry, more out of an abundance of rage than anything else.
Still chuckling, Harry kneels beside him. Then he lays down beside him on the floor. Draco turns over onto his side, not wanting to show his tears.
When Harry glances back down, he’s put one baby in the rocker, which he has begun to push with one foot, and is holding the other to his chest. The blanket is thrown over his shoulder for modesty. He gives Harry a small smile as he reclaims his seat.
One of Harry’s fingers feels so much better than two of Draco’s own, thicker and farther reaching, filling him up in a deeply satisfying way.
“That’s how I was able to force my way into the London duels. People like me can’t really get in without a sponsor, and it’s almost always rigged when we do get in.”
"You know, sir," he says, from where he's trying desperately to regain his breath, laid out like some divine gift on Harry's desk, "we could knot if we were bonded."
Draco breathes out through his nose. Their hands are joined on their shared armrest, and Draco’s knuckles are ghastly white. He does smile when Lucius and Narcissa (thankfully on the other side of the Citadel when the attacks happened) join them and kisses both of their cheeks in greeting.
The trial itself is one of the shortest Harry has ever attended. Fred has abandoned all of his usual humor and answers each question succinctly and honestly. He holds his head high, almost proudly so. When Minister Avery asks for a vote on the fate of Fred Weasley, the response is swift and unanimous. He will receive the Kiss in mid-June, so as not to disrupt the proceedings of Beltane or Lammas.
Unless Harry is the one to initiate darker subjects, Draco strays away from them, after that. Not because he doesn’t want to know, but because he hadn’t liked the resigned look on Harry’s face when talking about bad things that have happened to him. He seems to just accept them as par for the course, and something about that is scary.

Music is the only thing Lily is good at, really, that and punching her brothers, because you have to be good at that to grow up with boys and the whole of the Weasley family, and there’s a small part of her that feels a little victorious that Grandfather seems to take to her hobby without his usual snide remarks.
I was once told that if you didn't see enough of something you really wanted to read, you'd eventually end up writing it yourself. This is me doing that, even though I am a full time student and have a bunch of fics that I need to work on.
“Let’s leave before they start up the fireworks,” Harry says, at length. “I’ve always found them obnoxious.”
“Even if I were going to bring you in, you wouldn’t have to. You’re an Omega, and a Pureblood at that.” Harry points out.
This particular charm had been popular among Slytherin Alphas in Draco’s year after they’d found it carved underneath one of their beds. There had been a rash of blank mouths immediately in the wake of the discovery, particularly among the few Half-Blooded students of Hogwarts. Draco remembers getting a wry letter from Aunt Bella about how she’d used it on Uncle Rodolphus when they were attending Hogwarts.
It takes a few more powerful thrusts, and then Draco’s clamping his thighs around Harry’s hand as he spirals, the hot wave of sensation wracking through his form. Harry surges up and kisses him, tongue dipping heady and warm into Draco’s mouth, sucking and sweeping and all-consuming. Draco pulls him close and clings tightly as Harry works him through his release, fingers stretching him wide.
“Sweetheart, please,” Harry says, warningly. Draco lowers his head immediately, frowning. Harry walks over to him, tilts his chin up, and leans down to kiss his temple. “It’s alright. I just don’t want you upsetting yourself any further.”
“If you give me that spiel about how all old families are inbred, I might scream,” Harry warns, a weak attempt at a joke.
“It would be my honor,” Draco whispers. He knows how to recognize warnings placed in between the lines very well.
Harry helps Draco into his coat and then kisses his forehead. “Are you sure there’s nothing I can do to help?”
Draco nods in understanding, guilt dragging his gaze away from Anezka’s clear blue. “That’s unfortunate.”
“Are you, Daddy?” Draco asks, watching happily as Harry groans at the title. He’d been shy about saying it, when Harry first asked, but he likes the way it tears at Harry’s self control. It’s a naughty little thrill between them.
Mother nods, lips pressed into a thin smile. He knows that look. Mother rarely questions Father on anything, and this look--one of resigned acceptance--spells trouble. He kisses her cheek, sighs, and walks in.
“You’ll need to ask your mate for permission to see one and confirm, yes,” Mother says, smiling. She reaches out and squeezes his hand. “But I know my instincts. Also, I may have asked your elves to make food that turned my stomach when I was carrying you to be doubly sure.”
Draco melts down on top of him, releasing his hands to grip the sheets as he rolls his hips in tight little circles, grinding his drooling cock along Harry’s belly. His skin feels strangely tight, alight with buzzing energy. Harry tilts his chin up and captures his lips, humming into the kiss.
“Quite well, sir, though I don’t think anyone prepared me for how many tedious events we’d be expected to attend together,” Draco replies.
Moving forward, I've decided I probably won't be doing any more Alpha!Draco fics unless it's requested. It's just not my thing.
She hums in understanding and pets his hair. “I know being separated from your husband has been difficult, darling, but you mustn't let it get to you so...”
“Please, Harry,” he says, wiggling impatiently as Harry shuffles up behind him, well-toned thighs warm against him.
Behind Father, the back door swings open, and out steps their Grandfather, which makes both of them tense up. “Draco, your ill-behaved progeny will not distract me from our conversation.”
“I’m pregnant, Father, not infirm,” Draco jokes weakly, shrinking back at the severe look Father shoots his way.
Harry rubs his stomach in comforting circles and kisses his temple. "If it didn't, there's plenty more where
“I love you, too. Even if you are a little terror who thinks it appropriate to jeopardize the very job that funds your ridiculous wardrobe.” Harry snarks back.
Harry moans his name, his hips stuttering against Draco’s arse. He can feel Harry’s hand curling around the base of his shaft as he fills Draco with thick ropes of his come, separating his knot from Draco’s aching channel. Frustrated, Draco squirms back against him.
Black turns around in a rush of motion, and the most haunted set of gray eyes Harry has ever seen lock with his own.
Even angry--and Al can tell he's angry by the set of his jaw and his pursed lips, it's always been his one and only tell--he looks gorgeous. It makes Al unreasonably happy to see that he's only wearing one of Al's shirts, just big enough on him that it falls off of one shoulder, exposing the lacy strap of of a bralette.
Sorry in advance for the mistakes that are undoubtedly scattered here and there! One day I'll catch everything before it's posted. 😭
Harry can hear his friends break out into low murmurs the moment he passes the door. With a sigh, he takes Draco’s hand and leads him a little way from the door.
Healer Ouedrago pats his shoulder when she’s done, and then putters over to the work desk in the examination room, various incomprehensible projections already floating around her. Harry watches in brief fascination as she works over the vial with her wand, quill scratching away, murmuring to herself in a volume too low to be understood.
Harry cleans them both up, comes up with a flimsy excuse to walk Draco back to the dungeons. Typically, a pass is enough to save a student that's being punished from more detention. But Draco is wobbly on his feet and starry eyed and happier than Harry has ever seen him, and there's a part of Harry that doesn't want to say goodnight, either, so he stands perhaps a little closer than is appropriate and marches Draco down to the dungeons, laughing and covering his ears when he shoots Harry a playful glare and says he's not sharing the password with Gryffindors, professor or not. And then he blows Harry a kiss before flitting through the door, red-faced.
“I don’t think flying or horseback riding are activities I’m comfortable with you doing right now, sweet boy,” Harry says, smiling. “But I’ll indulge you on the rest.”
Draco has prayed to the Wild Magic before. He grew up thanking it for his power, for the safety of his family, for the power of his bloodline, for mercy and good favor, and even a good night’s sleep. A part of it has never reached back out to him in this way. He feels impossibly, infinitesimally small.
And then he releases Draco, shuffling back on his knees. With a shuddering breath, Draco falls forward, hands fisting in the sheets below.
“Good morning, sweet thing,” Harry says, laughing as Draco groans and presses his face into the pillows.
He doesn’t try to redirect Draco’s gaze when he stares up at the ceiling. “It makes me happy that you want to take care of me. It’s so silly, but it feels like another way that I know I’m yours.”
The only time Draco has ever step foot into their home gym, whether in London or in Newcastle, is to watch Harry exercise. He has a few well-loved memories of delightedly sitting on Harry’s back while he powered through push-ups, but generally avoided the machines and every other offer of joining in.
She asks about their clothes (Draco preens at her envious compliments), about how they’ve spent their time, if they’re planning on seeing any sights while they’re here, and general niceties about the London season. Then she follows up by begging for a final picture, which Harry endures with a half-smile as Draco leans into him and somehow manages to pose nicely with their arms linked. She bids them a hasty goodbye, eyes twinkling with her scoop, and apparates away with a pop.
“When we’re both home I’ll give you so much fun you won’t be able to think straight,” Harry answers, voice thick with promise.
The Auror has pushed away from the wall, but Harry stills her with a raised hand. Then he slowly pulls back the sleeve of his fine robes, baring his arm. Black’s eyes zero in on it, pale face drawn. Harry feels incredibly small.
Bolotin gives him one lass arch look and then swans away, the click of her heels severe in the silence of the high walls. Taking a deep breath, Harry steps into the parlor. It’s a moderately decorated space, with high windows displaying the snowfall of their secluded estate. Bookshelves are pushed against the walls, separated by leather settees. One of them has a cradle next to it, and a thick blanket thrown over one arm. The fireplace in the center of the room is decorated with trailing vines, clearly spelled impervious to the heat. It’s bracketed by leather chairs on either side. Harry sinks into one of them with a sigh, staring angrily into the flames.
Gritting his teeth, Draco turns around to face Clara Edmonton, the most recent bane of his high society existence. Giving someone an inch is to give them a mile, and it would be bad manners to snub an acquaintance without having a believable excuse.
“He’s very good to me,” Draco tells her, smiling. “Would you mind handing me some more powdered moonstone?”
“Me first, please,” Draco says, pulling out the rectangular velvet box he has been keeping hidden for a little while.
“I’ll be late sometimes, mind,” Harry warns. “I won’t have you staying up on my account. Everyone will be there, so hopefully, you won’t be lonely. The place is in Knightsbridge, not far from the Citadel.”
The next few steps are a little less stressful. Draco’s weighed, to much fanfare when it’s found he’s gained a healthy amount. He’s ushered, blushing the whole while, into the adjourning bathroom for a urine sample. A flurry of questions and answers follow, during which they’re both assured that they’re doing just fine for a first pregnancy, though Harry is scolded for not encouraging more exercise (“He’s got you wrapped around his little finger, Mr. Potter! Take him on a walk every now and then!”), and then, finally, it’s time for their next ultrasound.
“Life isn’t always happy.” He’s learned that the hard way, recently. After a lingering silence, he adds, “You don’t ever have to tell me if you don’t want to.”
“Hello!” She says, smiling brightly. “You might not remember me. I was a year under you at Hogwarts. I’m Anezka Newman.”
Draco has always liked that--the power of that, the knowledge that he’s the one breaking Harry’s composure. He’d craved it at Hogwarts, in his own way, and he still craves it now. Draco nods, and then he’s widening his knees and lowering his chest onto the bed, presenting himself. He’d like to be doing it just for Harry, not all and sundry. He can still feel their eyes on him like so many small pinpricks, can hear their murmurs of assessment, can smell the rancorous mixture of their arousal in the air. And, above it all, he can just smell Harry--his magic’s distinct ozone smell, and his familiar Alpha scent, heady and comforting.
Of course, Draco ruins every careful plan after they've spent hours exploring each other in Harry's office.
Draco both hates and appreciates Mother’s efforts, and it’s difficult to tell which feeling is more prevalent. Either way, it’s enough to distract him from his growing suspicion that he’s not pregnant after all. He feels about the same as he always does when Harry is gone: a little listless, lonely, and irritable. He uses the excuse that he doesn’t want to experience the tedium of procuring Harry’s permission to see a Healer on his own and avoids thinking about it too hard. He has the sinking suspicion it wouldn’t be half as difficult to cope with if he were back at Newcastle, though, with an estate to run and spells to practice and big beautiful lands to explore.
Draco shifts restlessly, muttering about the dangers of idle hands. Harry obligingly digs his thumb firmly into the arch of one foot, smirking when a shaky noise sounds from beneath the blanket.
Draco knows the room Harry is speaking about. Father once brought home a collection of photos for him to gawk over with his friends. They’d spent hours in awe of dancing hieroglyphics telling their stories, had oohed and aahed at Nubian figurines and glowing scarabs and huge, shifting skeletons of Greek hecatonchires gifted to an Egyptian Minister of old. It’s absolutely gorgeous.
There’s a decent-sized building connected to the main house by a walkway. It houses the staff on hand, with an extensive basement floor for the house elves. After explaining how to hail them, Harry takes him back inside.
Harry gives in to the urge to reach through the flames and cup one of Draco’s cheeks. His skin is soft and warm and pinkens under Harry’s touch. He reaches up and runs his thumb over the back of Harry’s gloved hand.
If Draco is home, they take lunch together whenever Harry is allowed a rare midday break from planning sessions. Today they are in a cozy upscale Spanish restaurant in Chelsea, seated near tall windows overlooking the busy street below. Harry playfully knocks their feet together, smiling at the spots of high color that rise on Draco’s face as he kicks back. After a moment, he hesitantly locks their ankles together. Harry instantly feels about ten years younger. How long has it been since he played footsie with someone? But then Draco reaches across the table and links their hands, and he’s wonderfully in the present.
He helps Harry put it on, and then presses his hand over it when they are once again facing each other. It’d been charmed with various protective energies at Draco’s request and is warm to the touch. They kiss for a few quiet minutes, Harry gently pulling Draco into his lap.
“I’m sure! I told you, I needed to speak with her for an embarrassing reason that I’m not sharing with you, so stop asking,” Draco says, pointing his finger playfully in Harry’s face.
“Never had an excuse to. Not much a cook can get in Diagon. And by the time I could go on my own, it just felt weird to try.”
So everyone had a story to tell. Molly at turns bawled and laughed her way through the time Lily convinced Nan to take up the broom only for the both of them to repeatedly crash into the Burrow’s surrounding fields. They’d been covered with grass and bruises and positively shrieking with laughter, and to this day it is still the loudest Nan had ever been in James’ memory. Teddy talks about a wry conversation they’d had about the Black family, and how maybe none of it had really mattered as long as they all ended up happy enough in their little mismatched family. Aunt Ginny points out that James had sicked up on some of Narcissa's most beautiful dress robes as a colicy baby and she’d briefly held him at arms’ length and unironically said, “Well. You are
Slughorn is still as cheerfully sycophantic as ever. Even though Harry’s potion skills have taken a merry nosedive, being the Boy Who Lived Twice is apparently a decent trade-off for the fluke of his prodigy. Slughorn had been unreasonably delighted to find that Harry and Draco found their way to each other during the year-long break everyone in their year had been afforded. They’d fallen in love over letters and floo calls and gifts, and then impulsively bonded the moment they were able to see each other face to face. Harry hadn't regretted a single moment.
Draco has seen Harry in all kinds of states. Drained, after hours at the Citadel; irritated, after planning strategies with senior Death Eaters eager to humble their Half-Blood superior; all but unhinged and dripping with dark lust and residual magic after a raid. He has never heard Harry sound as small as he does now.
“Don’t joke about that,” Harry replies, with a frown. “I almost lost you. I haven’t been that scared in years.”
Milicent Bulstrode pops out next in a burst of green flame, looking miraculously unruffled. Harry’s brows rise at the sight of her. She’d been given a position training Muggleborn soldiers in battle tactics, more as a courtesy for her Father’s returning to Voldemort’s side than anything. The well-known story was that her father had been keeping her Muggleborn mother hidden in a tightly warded section of their family home, only to turn her over without a fuss when a servant tattled to a guest. Milicent is talented at her work, despite the nepotism--enough that some in the inner circle have grudgingly commented on it. Harry’s never seen her in action.
“When I… prayed... for this child, I really did think I was only getting one. I thought I was infertile, Harry. That the tests Father had done were just a fluke. It’s been known to happen. This is all a lot for me to take in. I’m happy, of course, but I think I need time to believe it.”
“Yes,” Harry says, relieved at the unintentionally given out. He runs his hands up and down Draco’s back and smiles down at him. “But knowing you’d be here when I got back made it worth it.”
Harry is rubbing his belly again, slow little circles. “So that’s why you always go red whenever I talk about money?”
see a Healer to ensure you didn’t catch anything, dear girl, I insist. They’re sure to fast track you through St. Mungo’s if you explain what happened.”
“They wouldn’t like probation, now, would they? Time in Azkaban? Being turned away by employers? I would say they don’t really have the right to not ‘like it,’ Mr. Potter. They’ll be grateful in the end,” Davies says, reaching out to pat Harry’s arm. “Not like those types can realistically hope for better.”
Draco glances down at his feet. Harry decides to get settled, give him a moment. He shuts the door behind them, and then gets Draco’s coat for him, admiring the wisp of his hair as it brushes against the fabric. Then he kneels on the floor and begins unlacing Draco’s boots for him, feeling the weight of his gaze on his head.
Harry laughs, and his shoulders slump with relief. "I've got your shopping in stasis. I'll go get it, sign out, and then I'm all yours."
Draco just nods. Finally, the barkeep returns with a whiskey for Harry and the promised cup of cranberry juice for Draco, and they drink in silence. Even with what he suspects is a low-level fever, Harry’s warmth is powerfully enticing.
Draco recoils. “That’s quite an accusation! I know Aunt Bella can be, well, horrid, but doing something like that could hurt her, too.”
He just catches sight of Draco’s face falling before he presses it into his stuffed dragon. Harry sighs, running a hand up and down Draco’s leg.
Draco flushes happily. Harry reaches up to tuck a lock of hair behind his ear, and Draco turns his head to kiss Harry’s palm.
The elf returns with their treats, and Draco is filled with a childish rush of excitement. He picks up one delicately rolled slice and dips it into the thick custard. The first bite goes down fine, but the next feels abruptly and unbearably slimy. He just barely contains the retch building in his throat and swallows it down. With a gasp, he reaches out for his glass of water and takes several desperate gulps.
And thus, the meeting begins properly. Russia’s integration has been going about as well as can be expected for such a populous nation--word of its conquering hadn’t even reached some of the more remote communities, who have continued to put up a slowly dying fight. The process of divvying up the nation’s Muggles has proven to be a particular challenge, according to Bolotin, who deflates in visible relief when Voldemort promises to send over those who can help enforce the change. The interim Russian Minister is an older noble with strong knowledge of ridiculous Pureblood values, but apparently doesn’t have the stomach for the uglier parts of being a dominion politician. The displeased look Voldemort makes at this particular revelation lets Harry know that the “interim” part of that title is likely going to stay that way.
Theo smiles wryly at him. “But you were right earlier. I do want to make sure Draco is safe. I’ll gather some equipment start appraising it as soon as possible.”
“Gonna make you ruin these sheets,” Harry says lowly, kissing at where Draco’s heart is rabbiting against his sternum. “Come for me, sweet boy.”
Harry strokes his back gently, soothing some of his restless energy. They sit together in contemplative silence. The stag medallion has settled nicely at the divot between Harry’s clavicles, and glitters in the soft overhead lantern light.
The outraged reaction is immediate and harsh. Harry can feel a prickling heat settling into his extremities. Right before he can open his mouth, Lucius is stepping forward. “Do you know who?”
“Contrary to what you may believe, boy, you and Draco and your siblings were not the only people who loved Narcissa,” Lucius tells him, sharply, “stop crying, this instant. Look at me.”
The whole time he’s been running a hand up and down Scorpius’ arm, lulling him into a sleepy doze right on his feet. When Father asks what he smells, he’s jolted back into wakefulness.
Proud, Harry pauses in his pacing to squeeze Draco’s shoulder. He would have asked the same question himself.
Harry sighs. “Me too, sweet boy. But we can’t right now, you know that. The Dark Lord was very clear about the edict.”
The first few rounds are boring. Nothing he hasn’t seen before. Duels are held in order of sign-up, and Aunt Bella caught them late.
“Just wait until you get me on some whiskey,” laughs Harry, as they make their way through the long halls of the Citadel.
Sharing this fic with you all is a treat and your comments keep me motivated when I'm deflating (which is often), but don't forget that I'm being pretty selfish in writing this! Forgive me for rambling, but I thought this would soothe a few worried people. Please keep this note in mind for whatever troubles that'll come Harry and Draco's way. Thank you all for your patience, for your enthusiasm, and for your comments.
Still, thinking about the whole nasty business just has his eyes refilling with tears, so he determinedly puts it from his mind and retires to the master bedroom to rest and calm himself in time for Harry’s return. And so, hours later, Harry finds him in bed under the covers, embroidering away at the baby’s blanket as if his life depends on it.
2.) Pretty sure this isn't how floos work, but it's been ages since I read the books and multiple fan interpretations of it have certainly muddled my memory over the years. Let's just say it advanced, considering this takes place in the 2010s.
1: I'm thinking of changing the summary into something a bit more fitting of what this fic has turned into, lol. I might not, who knows. Maybe the current one is good enough, what do you think? But just in case, I hope it won't be too confusing if the summary changes.
“Shove it,” Crabbe says, cheerfully unoffended. “Least I didn’t have to be dragged into service by my Imperioused ankles.”
Ginny hugs him tightly when he steps inside. Just like Fred, his siblings have retained their youthful look, though Ron’s face is drawn with a familiar anger and George’s is scarily blank. Unsure of what to say, Harry holds his hands out for them to hold, and the world twists.
Harry helps him onto his feet, and Draco instantly feels sheepish for his outburst. He thumps his forehead onto Harry’s shoulder, soothed when he’s drawn into a warm embrace.
“It was all I knew! Even at Hogwarts, I avoided Half-Bloods. I had no idea Pansy was even interested in Milicent Bulstrode because she hid it from me so well. Harry, things are different with you. You’ve shown me so many things, but it’s overwhelming sometimes. When Umbridge started--making all those intimations about my character, all I saw was the enemy trying to threaten my baby.” He croaks over the last few words, taking in a harsh breath to calm himself.
“You’re home,” Draco says, as Harry walks over to the ladder. His smile fades at whatever he sees on Harry’s face, brows furrowing. “Are you well?”
“So what? What would you have me do? Lock him away like a house kneazle? Will you do the same with Narcissa? You’re worried, I get it, but you’re not usually
“I’m assuming your parents named you after your paternal great grandfather, here,” Draco says, pointing one slender finger at
Harry closes his eyes. If he was having trouble sleeping with Draco snuggled up to him, he definitely isn’t getting any sleep now. An amorphous amount of time passes as Harry’s thoughts fill with memory after memory. There is no real rhyme or reason to it all. He thinks of the first time he’d snuck into the kitchens at the orphanage only to be held in front of his peers and struck with stinging hexes; he thinks of the first time he killed someone at the Colosseum, the horror he’d felt while the crowd cheered over his opponent’s smoking corpse. He thinks of taking the Dark Mark, and gritting his teeth so intensely his temples throbbed in an effort to contain the shout that wanted to leave his throat. He thinks of Hermione’s laugh and Ron’s bottomless stomach. He thinks of rolling his eyes in commiseration with the house elves at the Ministry kitchens each time the head chef came downstairs to fuss at them. Finally, he thinks of his and Draco’s first kiss, a chaste press of lips on their wedding day. Draco had been sniffling privately underneath the cover of his veil. Harry wiped away the one tear that escaped with his thumb, whispering an apology. That was the first time Draco smiled at him, brittle and small and nothing like the adoring curl of his lips that adorns his face these days when he thinks Harry isn’t paying attention.
He lets out a shaky sigh, and she rounds the table with a tutting noise, wrapping her arms around his shoulders. It’s always nice to enjoy a mother’s embrace, even if nothing will quite compare to his own. He rests his head on her collarbone.
Immediately they begin drawing their wands, and a few others confirm that apparition does not seem to be working. One after the other, it is announced that their magic is not answering the call of this particular spell. They test other spells, blowing iridescent bubbles from the tips of their wands and doing simple transfigurations. All of them work, but when they attempt to apparate, nothing happens. Daphne disentangles herself from Draco’s side and races for the windows, her wand aimed at the latch. A moment later, a streak of black smashes violently into the window and tumbles listlessly to the ground below, leaving behind a spider web of cracks and a smear of blood. Daphne whimpers and falters, losing her footing entirely when another rumble rocks the parlor.  Another crow soars for the window with a loud, distorted caw. And then another. And then another, and then the windows are overtaken by shifting black as bird after bird slams into the glass.
“Not everyone, but we’ve got some names coming in via communication.” Another Auror says, holding up a long parchment. As he speaks, the neat columns on the page are being populated in sparks of glittering magic, evidently the work of the people writing on its companion parchments. Bellatrix struts forward and snatches it from his hands. Immediately they crowd around her, Voldemort included, who roughly shoves anyone in his path out of the way. Each name is followed by a brief summary of the person in question’s status. Harry lets out a groan of relief to see
Draco doesn't feel very different, the first week, but Harry quickly points out that his scent is stronger. He's a terrible and welcome distraction, finding every excuse to pop in, knowing that if Draco really didn't want him there he'd be firmly and summarily banished, with a locking charm erected on the door for good measure.
“Oh yeah?” Harry asks, guiding him along the streets with his hand low on Draco’s back. “What was your favorite?”
Draco chances a hesitant glance Harry’s way, and then relaxes when he finds only amusement and fascination on his face. After being led through the beginning prayer, the feast begins, and they play catch up. Harry does not speak, but his hand is a warm weight on the small of Draco’s back, rubbing comforting circles. When the feast is over, the festivities begin.
He waits until the hysteria dies down to go back inside. He puts the knife back where he found it and tip-toes back into the bedroom.
After Mother’s content with him, she aims a cleaning charm at herself. The tension immediately leaves her shoulders.
“Yes,” Draco says, smiling gently. He pulls the needle through the hooped portion of the blanket resting on his thighs, holding the thread taught. “Because you’ve just shown me that you’re not likely to put the Dark Lord's glory before my child if something happens to me or Harry.”
Looking back, Lily is sure that it’s only because of her distinctive red hair that they’d been allowed into most places. Kids cotton on to more than most adults are willing to accept, and while she hadn’t understood why they’d been asked to go to the back sometimes, or suffer through especially long waits, she now knows the meaning of the tight little smile Nan would give her as they stood by.
It’s true. Harry pulls his glasses off, relieved at the way his view of Fred immediately blurs into amorphous shapes and colors.
She’d been running through practice on her viola, pacing aimlessly around her music room, with Grandfather settled into the plush corner chair he has come to favor, the one that lets him glance out of the window. Sometimes he transfigures a little table and writes, other times he lists off into a restless sleep, which she very pointedly does not acknowledge, figuring that he needs it and might snap at her if she hints at weakness. Today he has a muggle book perched in his lap, which he hasn’t seen fit to stop sneering down at.
“He’s pretty,” Fred finally says. “Your husband. Hermione cuts pictures from the newspapers. Though I will say, he seems a bit docile for your tastes. You know, high society seen-and-not-heard kind of deal?”
“A little while ago, Mr. Thicknesse... propositioned me. He said that he wanted me to consider having our bond dissolved so that I could marry him instead.”
He didn’t, actually, not at all. He’d alienated all but Neville, who had been eager to leave the place his grandmother abandoned him at. He still tends Harry’s London gardens to this day. He would have paid Neville for it even if he’d seen fit to just kick around the house and do nothing, but Neville’s always been too decent for something like that.
Harry cleans them both off with a few absent charms, then blasts the room with a high-powered drying charm that sends their hair flying about. Then he squeezes Draco’s shoulders and that familiar tug manifests behind his belly button and they’re twirling back into their bedroom at St. Savior’s house. They don’t make it to the shower.
Draco swallows and looks down at Harry’s hands, too ashamed to meet those clear green eyes. Harry’s tawny skin had been one of the first differences between them that Draco noticed, really noticed, after he’d come to accept Harry’s blood status. Not the difference in the way they talked, or Harry’s strange distance from their society despite decades being mired in it, or even the tremendous difference in their magic skill. It’d been Harry’s skin, warm and calloused and scarred, telling a story with no words.
He unsheathes his wand from its arm holster, pretends like he’s gesturing over at the guards, and says, “
He sits down in Harry’s chair, turning slowly through the album. He’s heard Harry mention this very album a handful of times, and he’d even been reassured that they’d look through it together, but he never pressed.
They shout down all of his protests with playful aplomb, and only lower their voices when Mother pops in to see what all the fuss is about.
It always feels so tender, when he’s on top. He shudders and works himself back inch by hesitant inch. He stops, trying to catch his breath, but Harry smacks his arse and he hiccups, seats himself fully.
“I’ve told you, you don’t have a choice. The powers that be won’t hesitate to turn their attention to you all, next,” Harry explains, holding his hands palm up in a conciliatory gesture.
She nods, her eyes glassy. “I promise, sir, I had no idea. I’d never been asked to do anything worse than eavesdrop and keep an eye out, honest. Sometimes I might send along money to fund some operations. I got all of my assignments trickled down to me through those servants, and I was supposed to have been proving myself. I was so foolish… when they told me I’d be doing this job, I was so excited. I thought we’d see real change.”
It’s a normal enough day when Malfoy pops into their house. Sirius knows it’s him because few people are allowed to apparate in, and Malfoy always calls for Kreacher when he arrives. Sirius watches amusedly from the stairs as Malfoy asks Kreacher if he will iron his cloak (it’s perfectly fine, with not a crease on it), and if he can start a cuppa once he’s done, and how does he feel about helping to plan for redecorating? Kreacher’s in raptures by the time Malfoy releases him, shuffling away with expensive cloak in hand. Malfoy smiles up at Sirius in greeting, and Sirius' mind stutters over a sudden pang of longing. Fighting an answering tide of panic, Sirius leans on the railing and says, “Come to terrorize us again, my dear?”
“Come eat something, love,” Father says, absently, pulling him into the kitchen. The familiar smell of dad’s cooking lulls some of the anxiety that had been building in his stomach. With a pop, Kreacher appears at his side, wordlessly offering him a plate of sliced apples, his favorite snack since childhood.
Draco gingerly knocks the heel of his foot into Harry’s thigh, and with a shuddering breath, he falls back onto the bed, breathing in deeply. He’s going to die. This will be how he passes. Death by all the blood in his brain leaving too quickly.
It’s completely at odds with the way he chases Harry’s lips with drunken intensity, and the arm that’s curling around his waist hot like a brand, and the impressive erection pulsing in his hand. But Harry knows what it feels like, to be at war with himself. He gets it. Still, the sting of hurt rising in his throat tastes bitter. Some of it, at least, is familiar--Harry may be the world’s savior, but he does know that he’s nobody’s dream Omega. He’s too willful, too unconcerned with his looks. He’s got a horrible temper when it’s riled. He doesn't play ball. He likes that Draco meets him tit for tat, but he might be the only one. It takes all his willpower to let Draco go, to step back.
“This morning, my father slammed a door too loudly, and I kicked up such a fuss! It was very embarrassing.” She says.
He widens his knees and presses his chest down onto the mattress in a sumptuous roll of movement. The change in angle makes Harry’s length slip out the tiniest bit, which is promptly remedied by calloused hands pulling him back into the cradle of strong hips.
“There is nothing to forgive, though I’m worried about the amount of socialization you’re getting if you’ve resorted to trying to find conversation in the help,” Thicknesse replies, voice wry. “Speak plainly, Draco. Why have you locked yourself away from us?”
Draco reaches back for him. Harry takes his hand and kisses his knuckles. Draco's so smitten he doesn't know what to do with himself. They're going to be the most obnoxious little family on the planet.
,” Black repeats, letting out an odd, hiccuping noise. “James was complaining about having smile lines at twenty-one.”
Pettigrew had just smiled shakily and said, “Well, you’re a nice young man, you won’t have to worry about that.”
Harry watches him go until he can no longer see the back of his blonde head, and apparates just outside of the Citadel. Ten, almost eleven years of visiting the place, and he doesn’t dread going back any less.
The sharp light is traveling along his markings. He watches it spill into rune after rune: love, devotion, sacrifice, exchange, power, and each of the strange ones he is unfamiliar with. A gust of chill wind blows at his back, slamming the diary closed and snuffing out his bluebell flames. Draco sucks in a sharp breath, staring in shock at the array. His vision is dominated by the dull gray of moonlight and the magic seething with power below him.
“I’m so sorry I scared you, baby. I wasn’t angry. Just worried for you.” Harry says, breathing out through his nose.
The answering moan is too much--any more, and he will come. He can feel his balls drawing tight, feel the dancing heat in his stomach pulsing downwards. He tightens his grip on Draco’s hair, tugging as he pulls back. Draco gives him a hard suck on the head as he goes, and Harry curses, thrusting forward one last time, savoring the little whine that rumbles in Draco’s mouth as his throat pulses warningly.
“It rarely is!” Thicknesse harrumphs. Then he tilts a smile down at Draco. “Let’s speak of lighter things. Congratulations on your pregnancy. After everything that happened, it’s even more important that we celebrate growing families.”
Harry bows. Aunt Bella bows as well, but it’s flourished and mocking, her curved wand swaying in her hand as if she were conducting an orchestra. After the countdown, she hisses out a
“Well, grandchild number three,” Lily says, in a goofy approximation of their grandfather’s highborn drawl, “it hasn’t been decided yet. We’re cut down the middle.”
Sirius steels himself and makes his way back up to his room. Kreacher placed Malfoy’s gift neatly on Sirius’ bed. Sirius tears into the wrapping, and pauses as Malfoy’s familiar scent hits him, stronger than usual. He slowly pulls the giftbox’s lid off, and lets out a groan at the sight of lacy green knickers. It’s a slip of a garment, intricately made, and the smell of Malfoy is
Aunt Andromeda laughs. “That’s new. Lucius loves the sound of his own voice. I was wondering why he wasn’t responding to my letters.”
Harry kisses his forehead and thumbs along his bottom lip, smiling softly. Then he stands and heads for the closet, obligingly leaving the door open. Draco turns on his side to watch unabashedly as he undresses. Harry always does things like this with a thoughtless efficiency, with no real thought to anything like seduction, but there’s a draw to it anyways. Harry forgoes sleep clothes entirely and closes the closet door in a burst of wandless magic on his way out of it, which makes Draco’s breath catch.
That seems to have shocked the words out of both Omegas in the room. Anezka covers her mouth, blinking rapidly. Draco slides his arm through Harry’s and holds on tight, trembling lightly. Harry bumps their heads together gently.
“You don’t have to ask my permission to buy anything, love,” Harry says, wryly. “I give you that money for a reason.”
Draco excitedly pulls him over to listen on the day they complete it. It’s a truly gorgeous song. What he’s more surprised by is the intense look on Draco’s face. He’s regularly claimed that he’s not very good at playing, but he’s good enough to keep up with Pansy, meeting her with his brows furrowed and his tongue poking out in concentration. When they’re done, he lets out a bright laugh and hugs Pansy to his side, thanking her for the opportunity.
“And ’ll be with you every step of the way, sweetheart,” Harry adds. “Surely between the two of us we can scrounge up one competent parent.”
A frantic nod is his only answer as well-manicured nails dig into his flesh, painful and steadying and delicious. His leg is shaking in Harry’s grip.
Theo chuckles. “Technically there is jewelry. Draco was enamored with the Malfoy family signet ring when Mr. Malfoy gave it to him a few years ago. As for the diary, I don’t know what to say to make you understand. That’s just how it is.”
Draco’s new husband takes him in closets and shaded corners, bent over desks and open windows, and one memorable late night in the pantry. He’s sure they traumatized the house elf who, unable to sleep, had come downstairs to the kitchens to prepare some of Draco’s favorite chocolates. (Harry rewarded the poor creature with a day off, a baffling concession for an oversight that Draco’s father would have corrected with an unthinking Cruciatus Curse. But then, they were raised quite differently.) When he’s on his own, he blushes to the roots of his hair to think of it, but it’s difficult to find anything wrong with it in the act. Surely they were meant for this. He has never felt more wanted.
Harry shushes him, and his face crumples. He doesn’t fight it when Harry pulls him into a hug, and squeezes back tightly.
When it seems like he’s finally gotten all of his questions answered, he stares down at his notebook and thinks about burning it.
“Nothing! Nothing, I don’t want to talk about it. It’s childish,” Draco babbles, and after pressing a quick peck on Harry’s cheek, he all but flies from the bathroom, positively glowing red.
Draco moans loudly around him, and Al opens his eyes to make sure he's okay, only to groan at the sight of Draco's free hand working intently between his legs as he takes Al into his mouth, his face flushed. Al chances a heavy thrust into his mouth, which gets him another moan, and he just can't keep doing this.
“My milk will come in before the baby’s here, Daddy,” Draco tells him, sliding a hand between them to stroke his cock. Harry’s hot and heavy in his hand, and he twitches at Draco’s words. “I want you to taste it.”
And before Britain’s great court!” He brings a hand up to his mouth, raises his brows, and heaves a great, exaggerated gasp, smiling despite himself at Thicknesse’s answering chuckle. “I’m surprised Mother hasn’t hunted me down, hoping to convince me to resit my etiquette classes.”
They make a day of preparing, gathering supplies for the stay. Ron’s expression darkens with each purchase Harry makes, though he says nothing. Hermione must be pinching him purple when Harry's not looking. When Hermione sheepishly admits to being hungry, resting her hand on the small bump of her belly, Harry insists on taking lunch in a restaurant along the way. After a moment’s thought, Harry lines them up in an alley and carefully transfigures their well-kept but worn robes into something resembling the usual fashions of the average noble. Ron scoffs.
“Milicent Bulstrode was allowed to attend by the grace of our Lord, for her father’s work. Old Alistair redeemed himself by the skin of his teeth, Pansy. You’d do nothing but make this harder on both of them if you continue with this courtship foolishness. We all have an obligation to keep magical blood pure. Do you really want to make the Dark Lord suffer reading your petition?”
The thought of doing something like that again is abruptly the worst thing ever, and there's this creeping loneliness that's making his throat feel tellingly thick, and that just won't do. So he marches to the fireplace in the living room, reaches for powder, and sticks his head through. He's allowed to reach the office assistant because of his listing as one of Harry's emergency contacts. (With a pleased little hum, Draco remembers how unthinkingly Harry had penciled him in as they curiously pored over his application together.) The assistant, whose name Draco forgot on purpose, is a mousy little omega with eyes too big for his face and a terrible flirting habit. Draco has never liked him and does not like watching Harry interact with him at Ministry events.
Sure enough, Harry tilts his head as Draco patters into the room, his glasses glinting eerily off the deep orange glow of the fireplace. Draco pauses, his breath catching.
,” Draco cries, breaking off into a low cry as his body seizes up, walls clenching almost unbearably tight on Harry’s cock.
He leads Draco into his office, and after throwing a powerful locking charm at his door, coaxes him up onto his desk. He leans back on his hands like he belongs there, red-faced and giddy and visibly nervous, despite all the bravado, and when Harry pulls his chair closer to kiss him he lets out this decadent little noise and parts his thighs, clearly making space. This close, Harry can smell him, heady and sweet.
, his hand flying out to grip Harry's wrist as he goes, because he has an unhealthy fascination with feeling Harry's magic on his skin. They get dressed in silence, and Harry sends him on his way with a kiss and a hall pass, trying not to think too hard about the firm set to Draco's jaw.
The fabric is thin enough that the sunlight streaming in through their window still leaves them visible, if a bit dimly. Draco eyes the pile of blankets Harry places at the foot of their bed with naked longing, and when Harry presses his front onto Draco’s, he clings as tightly as he can, locking his ankles behind Harry’s thighs. Harry rolls them onto their sides, sliding his right arm under Draco’s neck to pillow him. Draco throws a leg over Harry’s, and sighs in pleasure as Harry presses close and rocks into the space between them. His heavy balls are warm against Draco’s inner thigh, and the heated head of his cock slides against Draco’s length, already drooling onto his skin. He nibbles gently on Draco’s earlobe, drawing a keening sound from his chest.
After a moment or two of fussing around with the robes, Harry growls in frustration, folds them up over Draco’s arse, and affixes them to his back with a sticking charm. Draco bursts out laughing, and Harry quickly follows, lips pleasantly warm where they press against the dip in Draco’s lower back.
Draco looks at him with wide, astonished eyes. Harry knows this looks. It’s the are-you-dumb-the-answer-is-so-simple-Potter look. Harry crosses his arms over his chest.
“So tell me about the prettiest place you’ve ever been,” Ron Weasley is saying, as Draco blinks awake in his pile of blankets.
“I saw him covering your eyes at the duels! That was precious.” Edmonton says, around a large smile.
“Help,” Voldemort scoffs, turning away from them. His face is ugly with disgust. “Help. None of you would need help if you had just done what was asked of you.”
A few more firm steps sound, and then it’s Harry’s chair that’s scraping across the floor this time. Against his better judgment, Draco peeks outside of his tumbled blankets.
To his credit, the Minister does gently discourage Umbridge from asking any further questions. The ones that follow are decidedly less confrontational, and before long, they’re done. Draco holds his hand tightly on their way back up to the witness box. Narcissa kisses his cheek as he reclaims his seat, and Lucius is giving Harry a murderous look over her head. Harry blinks back at him, too agitated to care very much.
“Well, Harry’s quite powerful. He rarely uses his wand while we’re at home. Sometimes if he has to take his work from one room to another he just levitates it all behind him. Or if he’s too lazy to get up for something he’ll wave his hand and--close the curtains or lock the floo, that sort of thing.”
Draco slides out of the chair and points imperiously at it; Harry laughs and sits down with a little sigh. He supports Draco with ease as he climbs into his lap, the familiar weight of his arm settling around Draco’s waist.
Harry pulls away from him. Before Draco can begin voicing his complaints, a thick finger slides into him. He tenses up in surprise, then lets out a low exhale as it pushes inside up to the first knuckle.
A spell of nervous anticipation drove him to explore the grounds of St. Savior’s in search of an appropriate place to make his wish. He doesn’t want to be so close to the main building that he risks Harry detecting his magic, and he doesn’t want to be close enough to the servants’ quarters that he draws their attention. Worrying about it all had worked him up into such a fit of temper that he’d stopped pacing and sat right there on the ground, stared forlornly down at the family signet ring, and asked himself if it was worth the risk. He only moved when a stab of wet cold on his hair alerted him to the imminent fall of snow--though he’d been more worried about getting the diary wet than sickness. Draco regrets that now.
know is that you’ve both been through a lot, and I also know from experience that it helps to be around the people you went through it with.” Harry answers.
“Alright,” Harry says, holding his hands out palms up. “Veritaserum hasn’t worked, so they’ll go on to legilimency next. Not sure if you lot practice occlumency, but it’s really painful trying to resist someone crawling around in your head when you’re not trained for it. Once they’ve wrenched the truth from you, they’ll ratchet up the starvation as punishment. Once you’re weak, they’ll force-feed you a potion to induce your rut and then restrain you so you’re just in agony for a few days.
Draco jerks in his hold, a throaty cry bubbling deep in his chest. It’s like all the heat in his body gathers first in a pool in his belly and then releases in thick, powerful spurts, almost painful in their intensity. All sound is drawn out by the rush of blood in his ears, reducing him to just this moment. He hears weak little gasps and can’t bother with embarrassment at the realization that the sounds are coming from him, not when Harry is crooning praise, a hand running up and down his back.
“Were you aware that Undersecretary Umbridge approached me after your unfortunate day before the great court hoping to find you?” Father asks. He begins pacing, the click-clack of his boots bouncing harshly off the high walls.
Harry laughs and concedes the point. Draco scoots forward in the chair, widening his legs to get as close as possible. He leans down for a kiss, and Harry once again cups the back of his neck to guide him.
“My,” an older Alpha says, as he makes his way into the mating chamber, “haven’t you grown into a pretty thing?”
“Draco’s recovering. He’s struggling to sleep and he’s constantly worried about the baby. I think that’d make anyone a little crabby, don’t you think?” Harry asks.
Harry smiles tiredly. “The Dark Lord is calling us forth to help him plan more complicated maneuvers. He does this every now and then. Are you familiar with it? I usually just settle down in my London home for the duration. It’s huge, so it always feels a bit creepy on my own, really. I’d love to have you along.”
He only just hides his whimper by bringing one of his hands up to his mouth. There are still some muggle things that Draco is adorably confused by, and the inner workings of Al's trousers had been one. Now, he undoes them with a single-minded ease, watching with greedy eyes as Al's erection bobs forth beneath his pants. Slender fingers cup him, and Al bucks up again.
“No, no, no,” Draco whimpers, when Harry pulls off. He kisses the tip of Draco's cock, then licks at his soiled hand. His fingers slide out of Draco's hole next, an embarrassingly wet sound following. He's aching, empty. “Don’t go, please!”
“The British think breathing is rude!” Her father harrumphs. His face brightens at Harry’s laugh. “Hello, Mr. Potter. Thank you for breaking the law so my daughter could stay alive.”
She hums in reply. Then she releases his hand and locks her fingers together, knuckles whitening with tension.
He leaves early the next morning, when Draco is still hazy from sleep. He recognizes the familiar feeling of lips on his forehead, then strong arms briefly enveloping him in a warm embrace, and then drops off to sleep again. When he’s properly awake, the only sign that Harry was ever there is a new plush dragon, absolutely covered in his scent. Frustrated, Draco pulls it to his chest and curls up on his side, stewing in silence. He reaches for his wand to summon the family diary from his writing desk, props his chin upon the dragon’s soft head, and reads with only half of his attention.
Harry pulls off of his cock with a pop, kissing at the twitching head. He rubs Draco’s shaking stomach and kisses his thigh, but his fingers don’t stop working for a second, stroking over his aching prostate.
“That doesn’t make any sense. You’re just jealous because you and Father don’t love each other and you want me to be miserable, too,” Pansy says, voice thick with the unmistakable onset of tears.
Draco sighs into his skin. “It’s just that, no matter what happens now, I won’t have an excuse, will I? Apparently, I’m perfectly capable of popping out heirs.”
Harry guides him around as he protests quietly, his willpower visibly weakening with each pretty dress, robe, and row of neatly displayed fabrics Harry exaggeratedly points out. It seems like the battle against his stubbornness is almost won, and then someone politely clears their throat behind them, and Harry sighs.
Black gives him a conspiratorial eye roll, filling his hollowed cheeks with air. Harry finds himself smiling despite the sadness and pity warring inside of him. Black smiles back. It takes years and years off of his lined face.
“When Father was fussing with me about his heir, I got so mad that I told him to have another baby with Mother instead of bothering me about it,” Draco says, when they pull apart, his voice full of panic.
Harry makes a dubious noise, but says nothing. They lie in silence for a few minutes, sharing warmth.
“He’s still recovering from the birth, but in good spirits. He was ever so excited to be having twins, so I can scarcely get him alone.”
“Alright. I’ll tell you all the boring ton news, and whatever stupid thing my ancestor did next while he was terrorizing wizarding Britain.”
He’s clearly uncomfortable when his mother presents him to Harry in Diagon Alley of all places, while they’re obviously in the middle of shopping for the upcoming school year, but many Pureblood families have been struggling to reestablish themselves in society after the fall of the Dark Lord, so it’s not a great surprise. Harry has fielded more outrageous, less subtle offers while walking through the Ministry’s halls.
It would be so foolish to beg for Harry not to be punished, but the urge rests on the tip of his tongue anyways. He waits for it to pass before he helplessly says, “Yes.”
“And when we’re… together,” Draco begins. He takes one look at Harry’s waggling eyebrows and turns back over with a huff, reaching out for his stuffed dragon and pulling it to his chest.
He throws the shot back and hisses through his teeth, then delicately plucks a pickle out of the jar and takes a hearty bite. The grinding crunch of it is so ridiculously, comedically loud in the tense silence that Harry cannot contain a bark of laughter. Viktorovich smirks, eyes narrowing in amusement.
He’s the picture of pouty hysteria, trying his best not to sniffle his way through this botched attempt at seduction he no doubt spent days planning, and Harry allows himself to blame the swell of affection in his chest for the way he groans in defeat and leans in to kiss him. They knock foreheads, and then Draco lets out a desperate gasp before he’s surging up to kiss him back, inexperienced but enthusiastic.
Draco immediately pulls her into a hug. Harry sighs and leaves to give the two of them their privacy. Later, when he hears the hesitant tinkling of piano keys, he smiles.
“Good, good. I think she’s getting tired of living with me though. She keeps making hints about how she should move out, but I don’t know how to say that I don’t really want her to,” Teddy replies, grinning sheepishly.
“I didn’t know,” Draco says, shuffling back and then leaning down on his elbows. “How much I’d like it.”
Harry has never met a person so brilliant and irrational as Voldemort. He’s powerful, shrewd, ruthlessly efficient. He’s also egotistical, sadistic, and prone to legendary fits of temper. It’s cost them more than one operation and resulted in the deaths of some of his strongest fighters.
“With this in mind, I have decided to forgive you for your unseemly behavior before the Wizengamot. I also understand that a mother’s instincts are powerful and often hinder rational thought.”
Father rounds on him, pointing his finger in Grandfather’s face. “Don’t you call my children ill-behaved. They’re lovely.”
Father plays with her hair, tucking it behind her ear and pulling it this way and that, fascinated as always by the color. He and Nan had that in common, charmed by its brightness.
There are a few photo frames on the desk. Al walks over to it, tears springing unexpectedly to his eyes. There are a few photos of both Nan and Father that he’s never seen before. There’s one of Father standing proud with an old broom, looking so much like Scorpius that it’s scary. There’s one of Lucius, Nan, and Father standing proud in front of the infamous albino peacocks of Father’s childhood, the ones who’d apparently liked biting just a little bit too much. There’s another one of Nan tilting her head with a little smile, and one of Father in Slytherin robes.
Burkina Faso had been one of the few countries in Africa to willingly join Lord Voldemort’s empire, and fairly early into their advance. They’d been spared the violence of an invasion, and integrated near seamlessly into the system--it’s not unusual to see Pureblood visitors strolling through England, curious about cultural sights and potential marriages.
“Not that I don’t enjoy having an ally,” Draco begins, poking his head into one of the upstairs sitting rooms, “But won’t your Father think you’ve run away?”
“Yes,” Rodolphus says, rising from where he’s been sitting silently towards the other side of the room. “A happy, pious, and
If the wrong person heard that, they could have been in serious trouble. Harry’s not so concerned about what happens to himself, but the thought of Draco being punished is untenable. It is fortunate that the entrance is fairly unoccupied, save the two guards standing stalwart by the large double doors. They’re likely Muggleborn, which is a toss-up of helpful or hurtful. Muggleborns have little reason to revere Voldemort, and every reason to hoard valuable information for a leg up.
They all exchange polite goodbyes, and Harry crosses the shop floor to retake his place at Draco’s side. He bashfully lights up when Harry links an arm around his waist and plants a pecking kiss on his lips.
, chest heaving as Aunt Bella’s wand soars into his hand. The crowd, already buzzing with chatter, breaks into a roar--some excited, some furious. Someone begins to clap, and it follows in a ripple from the back to their place in the front. Aunt Bella recalls her wand and steps over to Father’s other side. Draco presses his hand against his chest, hoping to soothe the racing of his heart. Harry meets his gaze again, and the smile that creeps over his face is predatory.
“I’m married,” Harry says, hoping the new focus will soothe him. He seems to have inherited the same madness that plagues Bellatrix, and if Harry’s learned anything from watching Draco and his family navigate conversation with her, a good distraction can make things more bearable. “My husband’s pregnant.”
“I meant the Muggles. Though where they are, I couldn’t tell you. Might be dead. Might be scrubbing somebody’s floor, I heard they do that these days.” Black says.
Just underneath the grand arches of Hyde Park’s main entrance, their easy conversation is interrupted by a stranger with packages under each arm barreling right into them. For a good few moments, they’re a confused tangle of bodies, the stranger thrashing against them before Draco reaches into his pockets for his wand. “
Hermione stares quietly at him for a moment. Then she walks over to her kitchenette. “Like a cuppa?”
“These will be lovely for your complexion,” the tailor says, admiringly holding a length of silken fabric against Draco’s outstretched arm. “Very lovely indeed.”
“Not really sure how a lot of it works. I know there are factories where Muggle inventors are brought in to advise our Alchemists. Muggles are taught skills just like us lowly magical undesirables are,” Harry replies, dark humor in his voice.
It takes a little while to extract the winding wisp of memory from Fred’s temple. Extracting memories is very precise work, especially on another person. The few tense moments that pass make him so uncharacteristically nervous that it’s almost sickening. There is nothing to store his boon in other than Fred’s empty cup. When all is said and done, they exchange quiet goodbyes, and Harry takes his leave of the cramped little cell.
“Nothing bad. It’s just that--I know it’s easy for me to say you shouldn’t be jealous for whatever reason, but if it’s any consolation, Harry doesn’t love me.”
"Yes, love, that's it, come for me," Harry is saying, voice low and rumbling like he's the one who's just come for nothing.
The next few are from senior Death Eaters who would like to meet and discuss preliminary strategy for the Dark Lord’s next invasion, which makes Harry’s stomach drop in dread. They move so fast, in this. Voldemort has had his eye on the Americas for ages, never mind the closer targets that have been gearing up for rebellion. Half of their collective power is going into integrating Russia, and the other half has apparently been allowed to rest on their laurels for too long. The Dark Lord wants more victories, and he wants them soon.
The elf pops away with a nod. Harry is looking at Draco with affection clear on his face. Shy, he pats down his hair, huffing when Harry’s smile grows.
“I was under the impression that Potter lost the ability after the war,” Grandfather says, giving her a keen-eyed look.
“I hope you’ll excuse me for ducking out, but I was working in my brewery before you arrived. I must get back before my cauldron spoils,” Draco says.
He curls one hand around Draco’s shoulder, pulling him back as he lines the head of his heavy cock against Draco’s entrance, pushing slowly but insistently inside. He lets out a low groan, and then hisses when Draco impishly clenches around him, just the way he likes it. No one in here will be tricked into believing that this is their first time, Draco thinks. He locks eyes with Theo Nott, who’d had to take up the mantle as his family's head Alpha after old Cantankerous was killed fighting for the Dark Lord. Theo had never been especially subtle about his desire for Draco. Draco had delighted in the attention, and enjoyed teasing him, but never had any real intention of indulging him.
He tucks some of Draco’s hair behind his ear, chuckling as Draco makes a show of looking away from him. It takes only a few agonizing seconds of the pouty cold shoulder for Harry to sigh and press himself along Draco’s back, kissing his neck. Harry’s cock is straining hard through his trousers, so much that it must be painful. Draco grinds his arse back against him, smiling despite himself at Harry's soft groan.
“The absolute gall of it,” Father confirms, voice sharp with venomous relish. “Two spells with the same base function could be called Light or Dark depending on who traditionally practiced it. It was all designed to ostracize us Purebloods, of course.”
Draco shudders in response. He shifts forward until his chest is pressing into Harry's desk, absolutely covering his grading with his scent, Harry will have to duplicate those if he knows what's good for them. But then he's bringing his arms back, long fingers brushing over Harry's, before gripping his cheeks and exposing his pink, furled hole. Here, his scent is strongest, slick oozing lazily from the tight muscle.
Draco laughs. It’s difficult to imagine Mother, elegant and unruffled Mother, making any sort of gaffe.
Harry bites the inside of his cheek so harshly he can taste blood as the voyeurs recount what they remember of that night. Their audience is captive, with some lasciviously curious about Draco and others clearly fishing for details about Harry’s weaknesses. They’ve always taken his unwillingness to engage in conversation as a slight. Harry can see the younger Crabbe and Goyle shifting uncomfortably in their seats, nursing their drinks. He feels a stab of deep irritation at them. Will they not speak up for their friend?
Harry's free hand had been on his hip, rubbing circles into the skin there, but now he uses it to press into his thigh, locking him in place. When Draco peeks between his fingers, he can see Harry's bright eyes staring intently back up at him. He's lost his glasses, somehow. Draco runs his hands through Harry's dark curls, scratching at Harry's scalp as he bobs his head, tongue dragging along his length. He comes embarrassingly fast. Harry swallows it all, and sucks insistently at Draco's tip until he has to push him off. Harry rubs his stomach as he comes down from the high, his eyes heavy. He recognizes the familiar ticklish feeling of Harry's stupidly powerful cleaning charm rolling over him, and then Harry's shuffling around before he coaxes Draco out of his shirt and into a silky robe--he must have transfigured it.
Bolton stares down her nose at him, brows narrowed. Then, she crosses her arms and says, “Why do you need this more than any other?”
Scorpius clasps a hand on his shoulder and grins. Dad hates the Floo, and other tight spaces. As a kid, the cottage’s walls seemed like they went on forever. Scorpius and his siblings built a resistance to side-along nausea from a young age. He feels that familiar tug tug
It’s been a while since Draco’s worn trousers of any kind, and the tight riding pants he‘d taken from Harry’s side of the closet are able to shrink to his size easily enough. He blushes as he slips them on, thinking of that day in the gardens back home. It feels like a lifetime ago now. He stretches as he finds his place in the gym, reacquainting himself with the feeling of having so much air rushing between his legs. Then, with a sigh, he draws his wand, points it at one of the training torsos dummies lined against the wall, and says, “
He is shaken firmly into consciousness. His savior doesn’t fight the waterfall of weak blows Draco lands on strong shoulders, opting instead to snake his arms around Draco’s waist and rock him back and forth.
Anezka is about to speak, but her father walks up behind her, clasps his hands over her shoulders, and begins speaking a language Harry’s untrained ears can only peg as Slavic. Anezka laughs, looking down at her hands as her face colors.
“Shut up,” Harry responds, though not unkindly. They’ve spoken about this at length. Draco is dramatic.
“I know you can do it again for me, baby,” Harry rumbles, kissing his way up Draco’s stomach once he ensures Draco won’t try to squirm away from him.
Theo is interrupted by the large double doors of the mansion swinging open, presenting a beaming Draco.
“Edmonton. Clara Edmonton. Our Lord was kind enough to give my family another opportunity to…” And then the two of them share a flurry of niceties, though Harry can tell by the flatness in his voice that Draco is largely unimpressed by her. Her accent is just off enough, Harry knows, her clothes loud and compensating.
“It all seems very dashing, doesn’t it? And, it sounds like fun to be able to say ‘classified’ whenever you ask me a stupid question.” Scorpius jokes, elbowing him in the side.
“We’re always trying to push the limit with our magic, Draco. You’d be surprised what we can do.” Harry says. His eyes are far away. “That must have been scary, love. I’m sorry.” He murmurs, following up with another round of soft kisses. As it turns out, brandy and whiskey have an interesting taste when mixed together.
He’d been warned to expect it. Everyone from his mother, to his healer, to his giggly friends and tutting family acquaintances, have told him in so many words that Alphas feel the urge to protect during such a vulnerable time. The first time he did it, he’d been exhausted and drained from a difficult home birth, no doubt looking sweaty and disheveled on their bed, as Scorpius snuffled his way to one heavy breast and latched on. Harry had stared until Draco found himself flushing and whining for him to look away, which only worked for about three whole seconds, before those owlish green eyes were back on them.
Draco knew that, but the reminder is disheartening anyway. “The moment it’s lifted, I want out of London. I can’t handle these people.”
Finding this room had been a blessing in many ways. It’s difficult for both of them to enter the Room of Requirement for different reasons, and there’s something just novel enough about the room that they inevitably find their way back to it. Harry stores their things atop the piano and goes through the usual motions. He confounds the chatty portraits, sets locking and caterwauling charms by the door, and a series of muffliatos along the walls. Then he tilts his head and sends a whimsical round of bluebell flames into the air. As Draco smiles up at them, Harry pushes the scattered desks together, beginning the tedious process of transfiguring them into a suitable bed.
It’s like a switch flips, somewhere in his head, and soon he’s riding the thrill of heat racing down his spine and fucking greedily into Harry’s warm mouth. He can feel himself getting close, but it feels too good to stop, and he’s hoping that Harry will take pity on him and let him come.
“Twins, yes,” She says, smiling at him. “I had thought Draco was showing a little early because he’s so slender--you must eat more, dear!--but this is certainly another reason why!”
Thicknesse nods solemnly. “The next Potter heir. It’s quite the responsibility, to bring a bloodline back to life. Are you very nervous?”
The first thing Draco is aware of is the feeling of Harry’s hand running through his hair, and a throbbing in his temples. When he tries to lift his head, his vision blurs, and he subsides back down into his pillow with a whimper.
“This is new,” Harry finally says, as he settles into the bed. His hand splays over Draco’s flank, the warm pad of his thumb running along the curve of his ribs.
The woman starts, and then she narrows her eyes at Harry. Her hair ripples from a dark brown to a violent shade of red, only for the color to drain into a comical white once she gets a good look at his face. Her lips twisting, she wordlessly moves to the side, shoulders hunched. There’s something about her that’s strangely familiar--something about that posture, those cheekbones. But it doesn’t matter. Harry pushes on the door, and once he realizes it has been locked, he blows the knob off with a frustrated burst of wild magic.
After a moment, Malfoy leans up to peck Sirius on the lips, and then bursts into a round of soft laughter. "We were so stupid to do this face to face."
hate you. I just hate that you had to do that.” Harry says, gently pulling his sleeve over his hand to wipe Draco’s face clean.
“Merlin,” Harry hisses, the moment a rush of freezing wet air blows down the hazily lit corridor before him. “The stench.”
“We weren’t expecting you lot to survive,” the woman laughs, exposing sharp canines. “Know you jumped-up baby machines aren’t taught anything useful.”
“What about me?” Harry asks, slowly accepting a shot glass. He swallows what must be the strongest vodka he’s ever tasted in his life. It clears his sinuses, makes his eyes blur with reactive tears, and burns all the way down to his stomach. He refuses the pickle Viktorovich offers, though he does hold his glass out for a refill.
“Inside, inside me, please,” He babbles, stroking Harry as best he can from this angle, thighs falling open invitingly.
Harry and Weasley promptly descend into bitter, mean-spirited bickering. Harry calls Weasley a manchild. Weasley says he’s not sure how Harry’s maintained his muscle mass dining on wine and sweetmeats. Harry says Weasley has never been able to cope with feeling like he’s overshadowed. Weasley says Harry’s fits of temper have endangered his brain cells. Harry asks if Hermione had to tell him what brain cells are. Neither of them notices Draco propping himself up, neatly adjusting his hair, and then drawing his wand.
“Are you alright, darling? Come here,” Mother says, beckoning Draco over. “Oh, you’re shaking. Here,
“You’re all still welcome to stay. Ask one of the maids to show you to the guest rooms if you get lost.” He says.
“How have you been?” Hermione asks, setting a kettle on the stovetop. She watches it with an unnecessary amount of concentration.
“Watch me vanish this, now, Scorpius. You have some time yet before you learn this, but it never hurts to start early.” Father says, kindly allowing for a change in subject.
They pop outside briefly to walk the entirety of the estate, with its bright green grasses and gardens and dark fences. It’s got the most peculiar architecture on the outside, completely at odds with its sleek, modern design. He points this out to Harry.
The days of the Wheel of the Year are eagerly anticipated by most in wizarding Britain, but Harry is sure that no one anticipates it the way Death Eaters do, himself included. Barring serious emergency in their worldwide machinations, Voldemort always allows most of his closest followers to celebrate uninterrupted. Only on Beltane, Lammas, and Samhain are they expected to celebrate at the Citadel, for reasons that have always seemed petty and inadequate to Harry, who brushed the group celebrations off by staying stubbornly at home. Bad form, to be sure, but not unallowed. Before he took the mark, the only thing Harry ever associated the holidays with was watching the caregivers at his orphanage smacking the children’s hands away from the altars that would crop up in the building, and then later being rushed more intensely when it was time to cook food for any nobles stopping by the Ministry on their roving celebrations. Harry had always been baffled about the waves of people who’d breeze through London in tightly-knit groups.
To Harry’s dismay, he can see tears filling the boy’s lovely gray eyes. His instincts are screaming at him to pull him close and comfort him. Harry cups his cheek, but then Draco tilts his head and determinedly pulls Harry’s thumb into his mouth. His pink lips purse prettily over Harry’s skin, his tongue swirling wet and warm.
Draco squirms. He crawls up as Harry tugs at his arm, and then grinds his hard cock against Harry’s with a loud moan. They kiss, and Harry all but sucks the taste out of himself out of Draco’s mouth. Harry coaxes Draco into reclining against pillows piled up by the headboard and kisses along his neck, pausing to kiss over their bondmark and then down to his collarbone.
"Fill me up, Harry." He cries out, his words trailing off into an aimless keen as Harry hisses and his rhythm stutters, his knot pressing against Draco's entrance with each pull.
They drink for a bit longer, talking aimlessly about the days ahead. Harry’s tolerance is much higher than Draco’s, but he’s still visibly affected, all heated skin and louder laughs. He rarely sees Harry this relaxed outside of the bedroom. By the time Draco’s wilting from lack of sleep, Harry cleans up and then hoists him up into his arms. Draco is asleep before they even make it to the bed.
She’s not wrong, is what Scorpius does not say. Grandfather sneers at the mere mention of her, like he was in the family she’d left for love, like she and Nan hadn’t reconciled to the best of their ability before Nan was taken from them.
She gives him a wry smile that says she doesn’t believe him for a second. “The other day Hermione came into my room sobbing because she read one of your books on how Shakespeare found Muggles fascinating and inspiring. She was inconsolable for hours. I get it.”
He’d asked for clemency for Fred, and immunity for his family, who, as far as Harry knows, wasn’t involved in the bombings. (Harry doesn’t believe that one bit, these days, but no one needs to know that.) His requests have been seen by the Minister himself, Harry knows--his status guarantees that--but who knows how intensely Voldemort has been breathing down the man’s neck?
“Why do you look so afraid?” Harry asks, holding his arms out. Draco quickly walks into his embrace, shoulders tense.
He’s halfway into his bottle, feeling pleasantly fuzzy, when he hears a low pop and the rustle of fabric. Soon enough, Harry pauses at the open doorway, his glasses glinting off the yellow glow from the food box.
“Harry,” he gasps, riding the movement with a restless roll of the hips. Harry’s grip is firm and doesn’t allow for much space to move, which is at once irritating and terribly arousing.
Draco shyly burrows his face into Harry’s arm, and Harry can feel the plush lips curving up into a little smile.
"You want to come inside me, don't you, Alpha?" Draco says, cupping Al's chin. He's the picture of ruffled beauty, somehow still elegant with his eyes watery and his lips puffy.
"No, I'm just crazy about you," Harry tells him, like these are words that normal people utter without a hint of irony.
“He didn’t,” Lily says, furrowing her brow, and is briefly and genuinely confused before she remembers something, “Oh, I guess he just doesn’t talk about it in public.”
Harry laughs as Draco spreads his arms and spins in quick circles, robes billowing about his feet as he takes a deep breath.
There is nowhere else to move, though--the families are further in, and they’re bound to run into the same problem no matter where they go. He will just have to be grateful that he doesn’t see any of his friends.
“Maybe it’d be good for him, though,” Father hums, and then he glances at where they’re all watching intently and does not elaborate.
“He’s very kind to me,” Draco says, sharper than he intended. Thankfully, she either doesn’t notice or has decided not to comment on it.
He has to push gently at Draco’s shoulders to still him, and tug on his hair to bring him up. He hisses at the slight chill of the air on his cock. Draco lets out a keen of protest.
“So what do we do for Yuletide?” Harry asks, as Draco takes his seat on the other side of the table.
on it. Harry wants to leave it, and badly. He wants to try destroying it and saying that it was burned. But it wouldn’t be fair to do that without asking first, and he hasn’t forgotten his intention to have it appraised. So he bends down, picks it up, and summons an elf to store it away.
After what feels like an eternity, they’re joined completely, and Draco’s gripping Harry’s shoulders as he lifts himself. Then he falls back down. Harry knows he’s found his prostate by the little cry he lets out, the way his brows draw together as he clenches down on Harry’s cock.
Wordlessly, the headmaster rounds the table and then dips into a mockingly deep curtsey, miming holding out long robes. Something about that neatly snaps the last bit of restraint in Harry’s mind. He bows. They count the necessary paces and raise their wands.
He’d amusedly thought that her ruddy cheeks looked a bit like a peach when he first saw her, but her face reddens further in her visible embarrassment. And no wonder. Being assigned to Azkaban guard duty as a junior Auror, Harry has learned over the past few weeks, is a punishment for newcomers that need to be humbled for one reason or another. Auror Tonks had laughingly recounted her own days roaming the high-security prison after speaking out of turn one too many times.
Draco tenses up. He sniffles, and when Harry carefully removes his gloves to wipe the tears from his face, he lowers his head. “I’m afraid of what they’ll find.”
George wordlessly follows--Harry has never heard him speak so rarely in all his life--and Ginny lingers, giving Harry an apologetic smile.
“I’m not upset with you, sweet boy,” Harry says, rocking them back and forth. “How about we get you in bed for a nap, hmm? It’s been a long morning. I bet you’re exhausted.”
“Have you been having a merry Yuletide so far? I must say, all of this is fairly new to me! It has to be one of my favorite things about… everything.” She says, and as a serving woman walks by, she plucks two flutes of champagne from the table in her hand. “Will you have one?”
He takes Draco’s hand’s in his, thumbs rubbing comforting circles over the knob of his wrist bones. Draco shuffles back in Harry’s lap to see him a bit more clearly and takes a deep breath.
He’d mentioned it was a Malfoy family tradition to hand down the journal of an ancestor to the newly married firstborn of the main branch. Draco has been reading it with a sleepy devotion, clearly not very interested in its contents, but carrying the tradition onwards. Harry is surprised to find that it’s written in French. Harry’s shite with languages, and while Draco’s been patiently teaching him the basics, whatever is written here isn’t anything he’ll be able to understand.
“It the best pain I’ve ever felt,” Draco says dismissively, though it’s clear from his humorously trembling lips that he doesn’t quite mean it.
The ghost of an unfriendly smile curls on Lucius Malfoy’s lips. “I’m your grandfather, boy. You may as well call me that.”
Only Greyback is allowed to leave right away--he will gather his large pack to aid in the rescue efforts. That will not go well, Harry thinks, mildly amused despite himself. Thicknesse is sent to manage the lower level Death Eaters inside the Citadel.
“I don’t want to talk about it, Daddy,” Draco mumbles, linking his fingers together over the blanket.
“They startle easy, sir, and you’re a new face. Maybe that’s it,” the Auror replies. “Anyway, here he is. Visitor for you, Black… Now, you change back this instant! You know you’ll be punished if you do it again this month!”
on him. Harry has never in his life heard a person drop more creative insults, and he’d worked with Mad Eye Moody. Draco regularly has his friends in stitches with his little asides, leveling crass insults and observations in carrying undertones, like he wants Harry to hear him. His essays are written with casual intelligence, drawing upon a variety of knowledge. Sometimes he gets downright cocky, throwing in wryly dark anecdotes about his (now imprisoned) father’s unwise dalliances with dubious dark magic, or a story about a Black family artefact that was all but sentient for how much it throbbed with decades of so-and-so’s hateful essence. Harry laughs aloud as he reads them, leaves little jokes and notes of praise in the margins, and tries not to stare too obviously when Draco dimples privately over his parchment on the days his class gets their grades back.
He pushes gently at Harry’s shoulder, but Harry shakes his head and locks an arm around his shaking thigh, trapping him close.
Lily purses her lips. “That’s all so silly. Daddy’s not a pureblood and he’s the strongest wizard in the whole world.”
As a child, coming down from the emotional high of Christmas Day had always been a weirdly emotional shock for him. Father quickly learned to preempt any tears or tantrums by spending a little extra time with him, starting in the morning.
Harry’s laugh bursts out of him. Strangely enough, this seems to calm the Omega, who chuckles as well.
“Oh,” Draco says, realization dawning at the restless prickle of heat dancing over his skin. “oh, Harry. I—“
It spans several generations. Harry has heard others commenting on his family’s long history more than once, but it is strange to see it laid out before him.
Draco’s stroking his back as he comes to. Harry, abruptly worried that he might be crushing the baby, rolls them onto their sides, cradling Draco close. He feels strangely wrung out, like a toxin has been drained from him directly through the pores. He’s surprised to realize that a few tears have spilled from his eyes. Thankfully, the both of them are glistening with sweat, and Draco is still buzzing through aftershocks, shivering in Harry’s arms like he’s standing against a stiff wind. He isn’t likely to have noticed. Harry pauses to wipe his face on the sheets, and then kisses Draco’s closed eyelids.
Harry is impatient enough to vanish his robes away without even reaching for his wand, which makes Draco sigh in appreciation. He gets to feel Harry's familiar magic enveloping him again as he apparates them straight onto their bed.
They stare at each other in tense, agitated silence until Voldemort announces that they will be visiting the Ministry. Lucius is too proud a person to ever apologize, but Harry thinks that the tense nod he tilts Harry’s way is the closest thing to one he’s going to get.
The main quarters are lovely. Draco’s relieved to see his writing desk from home placed underneath a high window, the whole setup framed by dark curtains. Harry points out the en-suite, which shares a wall and door with a huge closet. Back home, they each have closets on their side of their quarters, but they’ll share this one. Draco’s already fantasizing about smelling Harry’s shirts when he’s away.
He’s walked nervously past Fred’s cell many times, never daring to poke his head through the small window to check on his former friend. As he approaches now, his stomach drops unpleasantly. The junior Auror on duty raises his brows as Harry approaches.
He’s been tugging and licking at Draco’s nipples for a while, and his words feel like a live wire from the perky nubs don to his cock. Draco arches his back, pressing one up towards Harry’s mouth. When Harry teasingly pulls away from him, he locks ankles together over his back.
