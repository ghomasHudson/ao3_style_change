dream, and he wants to make sure he gets what he wants, and he wants
"It's been nice seeing you," Harry says, truthfully. "Maybe we could do this again?" Harry's hands go to his thighs, feels the material of his jeans and grips at it, feeling the muscle and material pull beneath his fingers. "It'd be nice to catch up again."
"I don’t know," Draco admits, wrapping his arms around himself. He’s still only in his pants, and if Harry’s feeling the chill with trousers on, surely Draco must be too. Harry summons a jumper, and when it comes he tugs the jumper over Draco's head. Draco pulls a face, but he still threads his arms through the sleeves, lets Harry pull the jumper down over his torso. "I guess we’ll find out."
"So what if you both stayed?"
"If I can fix this by hand, then I can put the spell back together."
"That’s your housewarming gift Potter so you may as well bring it inside," Draco says, stepping around the plant and slipping easily past Harry and the door. "I had a hard enough time bringing it over here."
that might be why Luna suggested it.
Draco places down his tools, finally dragging his attention away from whatever he'd been working—and then the shadow moves closer to him. Draco hurriedly pushes the tools and his work away, and not a moment too soon as the black shadow drops into the space only just vacated.
“Okay.” It feels like far too soon when Draco starts to pull away, hands dropping. Harry squeezes tight for a moment more before releasing him. Draco slides his hand down to take Harry’s, lacing their fingers together. “We’ll talk,” Draco says, and leads him back, letting the door close behind them.
Draco's starting to feel familiar already. The feel of his lips, the taste of his mouth, the way he leans into Harry, the hands Harry feels like he knows already, just from all the time he's spent watching them in the past. Harry presses his body against Draco, and Draco presses back too. Harry can feel every press of Draco's body against his, and wants to feel more. His hands roam as if they're acting on desire and not thought, roaming over Draco's body, one hand slides to Draco's lower back, pulling him in even tighter, holding Draco against him, and his right hand finds its way to Draco's hip. Draco's shirt is barely tucked in, and it's the easiest thing to do to sneak his fingers underneath it, to find Draco's skin, warm beneath his touch.
'd more times than he'd like to think of, enough that some of the cracks refuse to fade, like a passive-aggressive statement on his treatment of them. He can't remember ever seeing Draco cast one, but he's sure Draco must have.
Harry releases the hold on his softening cock. His hand is sticky, covered in his own release, and a little sweaty if he’s honest. Draco’s got a hand on his own cock, and Harry doesn’t know when that happened but he wraps his own hand around Draco’s, delighting in Draco's ensuing moan. Harry starts moving them both, squeezing tighter and forcing Draco to stroke a little faster, a little firmer.
"Is that enough though? It’s okay to want more than that. And it might be nice, having someone else in the house. You never know, you might like it. Take it from someone who knows—Potter grows on you."
Harry summoned the jumper without thinking too much of it, and the one that came was one of Molly’s hand-knitted sweaters, red with a big green H on the front. It’s one of his older ones, stretched out with the sleeves hanging loose, and it comes down to Draco’s thighs. Draco looks comfy leaning back against the kitchen bench. He’s a sight to behold, and Harry thinks he could get used to this, could imagine waking up to Draco in his pants and not much else, to sleepy mornings and shared clothes, to getting to kiss Draco whenever he wants.
, only me, and my decisions. So I quit, and then I sat around my house for a few weeks worrying I'd made the wrong decision. And when Pansy suggested we go travelling I took her up on the offer."
A touch against his ribs finally pull Draco from his thoughts and crashing back to the world. Fingers touch lightly against his lowest ribs, light as a feather, but Draco still flinches, pulling away just enough to get some distance. Or what distance he can get, when he’s still sitting on Draco’s lap.
Harry's read about it, seen pictures of it too because when he finally admitted to himself that maybe he liked blokes
, and Draco hadn’t meant it as a compliment,
“Draco.”
Sometimes he thinks about leaving England, going somewhere no one will know his name, or any of the things he did.  He wonders if it would even help, how much of the heaviness on his shoulders which feels like it weighs him down is specific to England, and how much will always be with him.
Harry takes another drink of wine, his mind racing. He never would have thought Draco would be the sort to stay in a job because someone
"Miss Black?"
“Spent the whole time thinking of you,” Harry says, voice like molasses and
Regulus waves the words aside with his hand. "You wouldn’t, you were only a baby at the time. Cissy and Lucius parading you around like you were the best thing that had ever happened to their family. Their precious heir." Regulus leans closer, inspecting Draco, and Harry can’t help it, he falls back a little, even as he grabs hold of Draco’s thigh and squeezes. There’s something unnerving about it all. From certain angles the resemblance to Sirius is uncanny, in his eyes, his nose, even the purse of his lips looks the same. It hurts a little, seeing it. "You’ve grown up a bit," Regulus finally says, with something that could almost be a smile.
It's not like Luna would send him somewhere dangerous, or even useless; of the people he trusts implicitly, Luna's on a very short list. Sometimes above even Ron, who, for all that he loves Harry and would never
Ginny’s words keep rolling around in his head. It feels like one of those obvious truths, things he should have already known. Like the fact that glass doesn’t just

"To a bed," Harry clarifies, "I didn’t think the sofa was that bad, though."
"Where do you think we went wrong?"
Harry hadn't (he had, but he just hadn't wanted to admit it) realised how much he's missed it.
“It’s awful,” Harry agrees. He remembers James and Albus, how tired he and Ginny were all the time. He remembers
It’s almost hysterical in the ridiculousness of it, years of
"Can I kiss you?"
Now, it sends a hot flush through his stomach, Draco looking up at him like that. Harry likes the look of him there, likes the way he runs his hands over Harry's thighs more. Draco’s hands drift to Harry's arse, gripping tight and pulling at him, urging him forward to sit on the edge of the sofa. Harry’s so hard, it feels like he’s been hard an age. His cock is practically waving in Draco’s face, and there’s no question of where this is going, even if Draco has barely spared a look at his cock, still maintaining eye contact with Harry. Draco’s fingers trace over Harry’s legs, fingers running through sparse hair, and then coarser hair as his hands drift closer to Harry's groin. One hand comes to Harry's stomach, rubbing, and his other hand finds Harry’s cock, squeezing firmly enough to make Harry groan. And then finally,
There’s a conversation brewing obviously, Draco only hovers when he wants something. Harry’s curious, but if nothing else he's grown some patience over the years, and he knows Draco enough to know that he’ll tell Harry exactly when he’s ready, and not a moment before.. Draco nurses his own tea between his hands, but doesn’t drink from it, and It's not until Harry’s coaster face is once again obscured that Draco breaks his silence.
Draco grumbles, but he complies, leaving his wine on the bench and moving beside Harry, hip checking him on the way through, body brushing against Harry’s and bumping him into the bench. It’s playful, but there’s also something comforting about it. It soothes Harry, helps him release the tension that has been building inside of him.
"Mmm, I’m still undecided. If I did take the offer, do you think you’d be able to survive without me?"
There's a chill in the air when they walk out of the bar. It's still busy, and their table is immediately taken by another couple. When Harry looks back he sees them leaning in towards one another, their hands brushing together as they look over a shared menu, and Harry feels a pang of—want or something like it, for the ease of their shared intimacy. Draco's pulling a coat out when Harry pulls his eyes away, from somewhere Harry can't see, and there's a part of him that wants to admonish him for what is clearly a risk in front of
“I think you should give it a go, Harry. Talking to someone might help. It might even help with what’s going on with Draco.”
He feels too hot, overheating. It’s not helped by the way his shirt is pushed up against his chest, feels almost trapped by it. He should take it off, they should take it off, Merlin why are either of them still wearing clothes when they could be naked?
"Can you feel that there?" Draco asks. "The original spell is still there, and it wants to go back, to reset. All it takes is a little push and then"—Draco clicks his fingers of his free hand—"snap, everything will go back into place."
with it," Harry says, even if he kind of thinks there might be. It’s all the little things though, things that Harry isn’t sure if he should be worrying about... It just feels
Harry’s hand comes up to rub at his chest, fingers smoothing over the words Draco has seen lie there. That’s new, something Draco’s not seen him do before; Draco wonders how many times he’s done it since the mark appeared, if Harry has stared at his own words, how he feels about his own words.
home. The flat with Ron and Hermione had felt the closest, but even that had felt a bit like he was encroaching on others. Maybe the only home he ever had was that cottage in Godric’s Hollow—but it’s not like Harry can remember that.
that don’t look away, that are still locked on Harry even as his lips are wrapped around Harry’s cock, as his hands stroke over him. He’s got one hand low on Harry’s stomach, fingers petting the coarse hair while the other grips Harry’s thigh, fingers digging into the muscle, and sending tendrils of pleasure shooting through him.
"Kreacher!"
“No!”
Draco wants to believe it, he does, it would be so easy to close the distance, his body already leaning in, closing the distance without his permission. He can’t look at Harry anymore, and his eyes drift downwards, until Draco finds himself looking at the open collar of Harry’s shirt. There’s a hint of a mark there, just the top lines of a letter. You might not even be able to tell it’s an H, if you didn’t know it, but to Draco it feels like a flashing sign, the words etched into his mind since the first time he laid his eyes on them.
for a while now, changed sometime when awkward interactions, and stilted cooperation started to turn into something else.
Harry's pants suddenly feel tighter.
When he reaches the band of Draco’s trousers, he hooks his fingers under the elastic, looking up to meet Draco’s eyes.
This could probably be enough for him, the pressure building low in his stomach with every thrust between them, even as the material of his pants is starting to feel just this side of too much. He’s barely thought it when Harry’s hands move, fast as the Snitch itself, pressing firm against his chest before Harry shoves Draco. He overbalances and falls away from Harry and back onto the bed, bouncing a little on the mattress. Harry is on him again before Draco can compain, forcing Draco’s legs wide and leaning down over him, forcing Draco down onto the bed as Draco glares up at him.
It’s a little rushed, but Harry wants to savour this moment, to sear it into his memory as, if not the first time he’s seen Draco naked—going through training and being partners with someone means there’s little he hasn’t seen of Draco—then the first time he really gets to look. He shoots his hands out to hold Draco where he is and looks up at him from his position on the sofa.
Nothing else for it. Harry holds his breath and steps through the doorway.
"Please," Harry pleads. He's so close he can hardly remember why he's trying to get Draco off him, only that he
. It's only a moment before Draco's face schools into a reserved look, tinged with something like curiosity. The movement of Draco's hands draws Harry's attention as Draco places the tool down then sits up straight, the sort of straight that Harry always wonders at—the sort of straight that probably comes from governesses and never trying to slouch to avoid attention— and folds his hands together on the desk, a movement Harry's seen a hundred times before.
, he thinks on first glimpse, and then,
There’s nothing special in the room, and Harry’s not sure what he was expecting, anyway. His heart drops, and he can’t help but be disappointed, even if it was a foolish hope. There’s only so much a room can do, even with the power of a Magical Castle behind it. Harry’s not even sure how the room would achieve that, and honestly, he’s just relieved it wasn’t filled with chamber pots or something similar.
Harry’s hands are lying on the outside of his legs, and he can’t remember when they let go of their hold on Draco. It takes a momentous effort to move them but he does, a hand coming up to cup Draco’s cheek, fingers dancing over the red marks forming there. The other finds its way to Draco’s hair, tangling in the strands, not pulling, just holding on. Harry wants to mark him up, to come all over his pretty skin. It's a filthy desire, but now that's he's thought of it it's all he can think of. Draco’s eyes fall shut and he moans around Harry’s cock, the vibrations shooting straight through Harry, and it hits him like a steam train that he's about a hair's breadth away from coming.
Harry sat next to him, watching as Draco took off his socks, sent them flying off to his shoes in the corner, and brought his feet up into the sofa in front of him, stretching out his feet and wiggling his toes.
. Better than that, it feels like there’s actually hope now, the chance that maybe he can make things better, when he’d thought all hope was lost.
"You collect Muggle ware. You serve Muggles."
But then Draco isn't just anybody. It doesn't feel like any of the awkward first dates Harry's experienced before, and he feels nervous, yes, but he feels comfortable, too, here with Draco.
"Okay," Regulus says, and Harry tears his gaze away from Draco. "I guess you can stay."
, which is definitely not a thing he should be thinking about his work colleague. "I guess if it means that much to you, I’ll be there. You better have breakfast ready for me, and something better than the shit cereal you usually eat." Draco takes another sip of his tea, uncrossing his legs and stands up. "I’ll bring the coffee, so that’ll be good at least." Draco walks around to his desk, taking his seat and placing his cup down. Harry turns his attention back to the report. It’s another cold case, written with about the same amount of respect Harry gave to his Potions essays at school. So far he’s yet to glean anything of use from it.
"I still get them," Draco confesses, and Harry stills, wants to deny it all of a sudden, take back the vulnerability he's shared. It seems worse when he thinks that Draco might know what some of his bad dreams are about—a war and children and the fact that the loss didn't even stop there, that there are still so many children Harry's failing to save every day, but that he doesn't think he can keep on doing it regardless.
Draco wants to say something witty in response, but it’s hard to think when it feels like every nerve and thought are dedicated to tracking the course of Harry’s hands and the feel of Harry’s body against him. He abandons all hope with a groan, thrusting up into Harry’s body again.
Even smothered into Harry’s lips Draco’s moans are like a drug, and Harry wants more. He wants to hear every noise Draco makes, but he also can’t even consider breaking away to hear them. Draco pushes against him, and Harry rolls his hips, sending shocks of pleasure through his body.
“We might be having words if you don’t,” Draco says, but he’s almost breathless from it.
Finally, Harry turns a corner and finds a desk, and behind it, sits the owner of the voice from earlier.
Harry’s bark of laughter shocks him, finally dragging Draco’s attention from the party to look at him. It Doesn’t sound amused, and Draco thinks it’s something he’s said, that Harry is laughing at
Harry's wearing socks, and they don't give him much protection against the glass, but it's more than Draco with his bare feet. It’s almost entirely instinct, years of training making the reaction almost as natural as breathing; identify the danger, neutralise it, remove yourself from the vicinity. He doesn’t even think about it, just acts, turning and gripping Draco by the hips, years of Quidditch and Auror training making the movement easier than even he would have expected. He lifts Draco to the bench in one smooth movement.
"How is that possible?"
“I’m not sure. I might take a break, maybe help Hagrid out for a bit over the summer. I think I might like that. I didn’t really have much planned, I’ll be honest. Hadn’t thought much past taking a break from it all, and getting away for a bit. But that was before…”
He'd blame dad-brain, if only it hadn't been an issue for as long as Harry's known him. Love him for it, but sometimes he's a bit off target.
The shop looks bigger than it had on the outside, but it's a magic shop, so that's not unexpected. Does the shop have the approval for an Extension Charm? Harry shakes the thought from his head. It doesn't matter either way—it's not Harry's job to enforce these things anymore.
His mother had a soulmark.
But somewhere along the way, Harry’s looks had changed. Draco doesn’t know when it happened, can’t pinpoint the place in time, only that now, when Harry looks at him, he can feel the heat building beneath his skin at the look in his eyes. Can feel the way his blood sizzles when Harry’s eyes look over him like that ― like Harry wants to devour him. Like he’s looking at Draco now.
Soulmarks are unpredictable, as are people’s reactions to them. Some people tried to game the system, as if you could force a soulmark into existence, if only you tried hard enough. Some people tried to force them, like it was the intimacy that brought them into existence, and for some people that worked. Some people tried to find their soulmate, or soulmark, using spells, and rituals and everything in between. Some people felt it wasn’t the soulmark that was actually important, and some people only insisted it.
"Divination is rubbish."
Easier than problems like what to do about your troublesome house and questions like
Later, he tried again on his own, standing in front of the old mirror in his room, prodding and pinching all over his body, from every mark, blemish, to the dips of his skin in around his bones. It’s all for nothing though, and when Draco finally gives up, extinguishing the lamp in his room, and climbing back into his bed with tears in his eyes, and he can hardly sleep for the aches in his body, and the fear which is even more painful, that maybe Draco doesn’t have a soulmark, that he’ll end up markless.
"We’re
They’re so close, and Harry leaned in enough that he has to move back a little as Draco raises the glass to his own lips, lest Harry be hit in the face with the stem of his own glass. Draco closes his eyes as he takes a sip, and Harry uses the opportunity to let himself really
He wants it all, can’t think for the want pulsing through him. He lets his body take over, working on instincts alone when his fingers grip into the sheets, using the leverage to push back against Harry. It finally gives him some friction against his own cock, forcing a moan from them both.
It hadn’t worked, of course, and now Harry can look back and see that he was never going to make the perfect meal, was never going to be the child they wanted.
but also
His fingers come up to press against it almost without his permission, wincing as he presses down on the skin. It’s tender, and very much real.
Harry doesn't realise he's not breathing until his lungs start to scream, forcing himself to break the kiss. He doesn't move far, only pulling back enough to catch his breath. Harry's eyes are closed—when did that happen?—and he opens them to see Draco looking flushed, panting just like Harry, little puffs of air Harry can feel against his own mouth, and it should be a bit gross, but it isn't. His world feels like it's still spinning a little, and Harry's pressed Draco up against the door of his shop.
“Wasn’t sure you’d come,” Harry says, when he finds Draco tucked into a corner, nursing the same Firewhiskey he’s had all night.
Today he’s not so sure.
good at it if anything, and Harry’s heard there’s talk about them being headhunted by the Cold Case Unit. It’s been putting Harry on edge. He knows when the offer comes Draco will most likely snap it up and Harry… Harry can’t imagine giving up all the other parts of his current job. Harry enjoys being an Auror—there’s nothing quite like the thrill of the hunt that comes from an active investigation. The thought of losing Draco as his partner seems untenable, but people move on, he knows that. They’ll say they’ll catch up and then something will happen, and before he knows it, it'll be six months later and the extent of their interactions will be saying ‘hello’ at the cafeteria and asking ‘how’ve you been’.
"I didn't choose it," he says, almost apologetically, like it's important, and Harry supposes it is, to Draco. "Her name is her own: Black."
"This is the Muggle side of the shop." Draco says, matter of fact, like it's something Harry should have expected.
Trust Draco to bring it back to plants.
"You're a good girl aren't you," Draco says, and Harry can tell from the movement of the sheets that Draco's patting her, can hear her rumbling purr in response. Usually when he has bad dreams Harry has to get out of bed, turn on all the lights, and stay up until they fade away, but tonight they seem to have already disappeared into the night, chased away by the loud rumble of a Kneazle's purr.
He’s never had a home, why would he have thought he could have one now?
"Have you repaired an item with an enchantment before?" Draco asks. He hasn't actually, Harry realises. The items he repairs are usually his own. The department has a strict
"What
"Fuck," Draco gasps, the words hot against Harry's shoulder.
He focuses instead on the task of making dinner. Something simple, definitely, and quick, but he also wants to make something that will impress Draco. Pasta probably, since that’s easy. He opens the door to the spelled cool box. Cooking is something he takes joy in now. There was a time when he couldn’t bare to do it, too many memories that always seemed to resurface when he stood around the kitchen stove. He’d resented it, and willingly traded chores to avoid it when he first moved in with Ron and Hermione. But with Ron and Hermione the kitchen had changed from a place of work to a place of warmth, of family, and eventually Harry had found that he did enjoy cooking—loved the feeling of preparing a meal for those he cared about. It’s something he’s missed since moving out of their shared flat; it’s just not the same cooking for one.
“Is that what she did last night?”
Harry tries to imagine Draco and Pansy setting it all up. It's difficult, drawing into the very fibre of the buildings themselves. It's impressive. He says as much.
Draco either doesn't hear, doesn't notice, or just plain ignores him. Very possibly the latter. He’s very proficient at ignoring Harry when he wants.
"Yes." Harry nods emphatically. His hands flying up to hold onto Draco's hips. He does want,
Harry’s not expecting it to work the second time.
Draco stands up, looking for his shirt, the only sound his own breathing the blood rushing in his ears as he looks around and
"But I think,” Ginny says, “for me, it always felt like I was on the outside. You never talked to me about things Harry."
The dinner had been a test in and of itself.
It’s something they used to do more, earlier in their relationship. Harry had gotten good at massages with Ginny, between Quidditch and the pregnancies. Wanting to be helpful, he practised his technique. It’s something Harry loves: the proximity, the touch, making his partner feel good. He’s missed this.
Well, not this time.
Harry drops it, turns his attention back to the sparsely stocked fridge. He should have gone shopping probably, but he hadn’t been expecting Draco to stay for dinner. It’s nice though, and easier than he would have expected to have Draco in his house. They socialise outside of work a little, but it’s mostly pints after work, and—on one particularly memorable occasion—Draco’s birthday party that had ended up back at his house. It’s taken a year of partners to get to this stage—and Harry tries to shove down the thought that if they stop being partners, that this all might end too.
When Harry opens the door, Draco is waiting there, two coffee cups on a tray in one hand, and a plant on the ground in front of him.
he’s just saying the words to antagonise Draco. Maybe he’s itching for a fight, the words that will break the pressure that’s been building. His patience is running thin and it’s making him want to do something—anything, to break the tension. Almost disappointingly, Draco doesn’t rise to the bait, only observes Harry for a moment, before turning his attention back to his wine glass.
“I know,” Harry says, but his voice suggests otherwise. “You’ve been busy.”
"Harry, take it from someone who shared a wing with a ghost who delighted in making our lives as unpleasant as possible.
Draco winces visibly.
"But you're not a Black," Draco replies, and it shouldn't sting, but it does.
a problem, one that's been losing him sleep—quite literally. He’s been avoiding it, hoping it would just resolve on its own but with every week that passes it’s becoming more and more obvious that that's not going to happen. He used to be so good at solving problems but it turns out things get harder when it's not some big dark conspiracy. It's awful, but sometimes Harry misses those days. In some ways it was easier, simpler. It's an awful thought, one that twists his stomach and fills him with hot shame. There's
“Can I sit here?” Harry asks, takes the seat before Draco can respond. It’s so Harry, expecting people to welcome his presence. It’s not something Draco even thinks he’s aware of, something that’s been happening as long as Draco’s been watching, the way people always want Harry to gravitate into their space. Harry doesn’t notice, just does it, with the ease of someone who used to it, but doesn’t go looking for it, always happy to have somewhere to sit with someone who wants to be around him.
he almost wants to say, to stop the words which will come tumbling out of Draco's mouth and whatever he has to say that will inevitably put an end to the mood of the night. He can't find the words, his mouth drying up, and Harry's fingers hold tighter, a grip that Draco must be able to feel but doesn't react to. Eventually Harry finds himself nodding, despite it all.
"Do you know that?" Draco asks.
"Not even the great Harry Potter can resist my body."
"Couldn't you just cast a
His hands continue their path, tracking a path over Draco’s body from the tips of his shoulders and his neck down to the dip just above his arse. It’s not until his hands do another pass down that he sees the way Draco thrusts his hips into the mattress, and now that he’s noticed he can’t miss it, the way Draco rolls his hips. It’s so small Harry’s not even sure if Draco knows he’s doing it, but now Harry’s noticed, he feels like he can’t ignore it.
They order food, and talk, and drink another bottle of wine, too. The bar is busier, and Harry watches as Draco peruses the wine rack. He looks in his element, staring at wines, and he probably is. It's not what Harry would have expected, finding Draco running a shop serving and hanging out with Muggles.
"Doesn’t make them any less bullshit," Harry adds, partially to be contrary, and maybe because of his own history with prophecies. Being fucked over by one before he could even talk and having the majority of his life shaped by a few words can have that effect on a person. "They’re just words anyway, is there really any magic in them?"
Harry captures Draco’s moan in his mouth. He feels hungry: for Draco’s moans, for the taste of him, for everything Draco’s giving him. He tries to get as close as he can to Draco, pressing up along the bench. His knee knocks against the wood cupboard, startling him into breaking the kiss and hissing in pain.
Draco pulls his hand away from the box, and motions at Harry to come closer. Harry moves to stand in front of Draco, the bench between them, and Draco reaches out with his left hand for Harry's right arm, grabbing his wrist and pulling Harry's hand towards the box. Harry splays his hand out, resisting a little—afraid of touching it, of breaking something that seems so fragile, delicate, that Draco's obviously spent time on and clearly cares for. But Draco just pulls his hand to just above the box, holds it there.
Harry jumps up, in a sudden flash of motion. Draco feels himself shrink away from it a little, almost without deciding to do so, as he pulls back in on himself, arms crossing over him like that will do anything to protect himself when Harry moves in his direction. But Harry doesn’t approach him, just stalks across the room, throwing his hands in the air as he turns again to face Draco.
and grabs the oil from the bedside table.
Harry takes the glass just for the sake of it, raising it and taking a mouthful.
for Harry been back in those days, but it had been
interested in blokes like that.
"You've thought about this a lot." Harry can’t help the bitterness that sneaks into his voice. Ginny’s clearly been talking to
—his fingers brush against the swell of a cock not his own.
When Draco pulls to a stop, Harry realises they've been walking to his shop, and he stops in front of it.
Draco seems… lighter. Not physically, but in the way he holds himself, in the way he doesn't seem rigid or like he's on high alert, and Harry has to step forward, to take Draco in his hands and feel it for himself.
Draco grumbles about it, but he does actually have a few ideas about finding out what is going on (not wrong) with Harry's house. It’s a relief, and Harry lets Draco do his thing, following Draco as he walks around. Investigating Grimmauld Place seems a lot like snooping, only with the occasional muttering of words, running his hand over walls and surfaces, and many frowns, Draco’s eyebrows pulling in concern as he looks over Harry’s house.
. He’s an Auror for fuck's sake, he should know better.
"Oh," Draco says, as if he wasn't expecting that answer. He inspects his wine glass, clearly stalling for time. "Didn't know you were queer."
It's a sick twist of fate that he’s just realising that maybe there isn’t anything he can do about the house at the same time he realises he does want it, wants Grimmauld Place and the home that may be on offer. He’s learnt over the years not to get his hopes up, of the futility of wishing for things and how much more it hurts when he
It’s been months since Harry last saw Draco. Not that he’s been keeping track. Except that of course he knows how long it's been. It was impossible to miss the fact that, as far as they'd all been aware, one day Draco had just not come into work. There'd been no discussion about it, and the most that had been said at the next Auror Office Departmental Meeting was that Draco had left the force. Not even Draco's partner had been willing to elaborate—something Harry had respected and been simultaneously extremely annoyed by.
But Black doesn't swipe, instead lifting up to push into Harry's hand. She stands up for Harry to pat her, arching up into his hand. Draco humphs behind him, but Harry pays him no mind, patting her again as she strikes up a rumbling purr.
news.
But he can’t let go of it still. And Harry’s never been good at leaving things be, and Draco definitely falls into that. Harry’s never been good at ignoring Draco, and now is no different.
"I’m sorry." Sorry for the loss of his brother, sorry for the war, and the fact that he lost Sirius well before that, sorry for everything that cost them all so much.
The silences stretches out between them, vaster than the distance between them, and Draco knows he should say something, especially when he was the one who suggested they talk, but once again his words fail him; it’s becoming a bit of a problem around Harry. Draco folds his hands together on his lap, eyes the rings on his hands as he traces the shape of them, the familiar touches soothing his nerves a little. He wishes he'd had more to drink at the party, or brought a another drink with him, or a bottle.  He wishes he'd never come, wishes he'd never fallen into that very bed with Harry in the first place which started this all in the first place. Except that he's not so sure about that, it's harder to be certain when there’s a part of him that just wants to fall into bed with Harry, feels like it would be the easiest thing to do.
Harry’s trying not to make a thing of it. He’s not sure he’s been very successful at that.
"Okay." Draco says, and Harry's hand is still down Draco's pants. He strokes his fingers again, feeling the hot head of Draco's cock, and Draco's hand flies to hold Harry's arm, not pushing away, just holding, sending a flush of pleasure through Harry just at the simple touch. "Bed," Draco says, gasping, again when Harry brushes his fingers, and Harry agrees readily.
—but before he can say anything Draco brings his hands up to Harry’s chest, pushing him back and away from Draco.
Regulus scowls.
With the door open Harry can see a ramp leading into the shop and up, not more than a step. The ramp goes about a yard or so inside, but the rest of the shop is still obscured.
An image of himself pushing Draco up against the wall and burying his face into Draco's skin, his neck, his chest, even his armpits where that scent would be
Harry's words escape him.
, and he just
"The glass," he points out, stepping closer to Draco. It’s automatic, an instinct to protect him with his body, even if that’s not practical here.
He waits long enough that Harry’s sure it’s been a waste of time. And that would be a laugh, wouldn’t it, Harry coming here in his pyjamas just to have a talk, only to find everyone in their beds and the door locked.
"I think I'll live." There’s a joke there, in Draco’s words, but his voice wavers a little, like he’s uncertain too.
It’s awkward, the way Draco is leaning down, and their lips don’t quite line up, Draco’s nose digging into his cheekbone. But it’s still perfect, everything Harry could want.
“Sure,” Harry says, and if his voice sounds a little broken, hopefully Draco will think it’s just the sleep.
“You’re awake,” Harry mouths against the shell of his ear, voice low and shooting straight to his groin.
The move silently, falling into sync with ease. Harry finds his glasses and his wand, then his trousers, foregoing his pants to pull them on as quietly as he can, leaving the button undone. Draco finds his pants from wherever they were, sliding them on with ease. By silent agreement Harry moves first, wand drawn and ready. Draco might not have his wand, but he’s still an asset, there’s still no one else Harry would have at his back.
Which means he needs to sort out the problem at hand.
, straining in his trousers. It’s not helping with Draco still standing so close.
He’s still on his side, arms wrapped around a pillow like he’d been wrapped around Draco in his dream. Harry can almost smell him still, the lingering scent of something that could be Draco, but is probably just his own sweat.
Draco opens the cupboard with the wine glasses first try—good luck probably, or some ridiculous posh house rule like,
Draco’s usually one of those people.
and Harry’s enjoying himself too much to do that, doesn’t want to risk pissing Draco off. Not when Draco’s in his living room, not when Harry wants—needs to know what’s going on, and especially not when Harry’s genuinely enjoying himself.
"A star box . It has a spell in it that creates the night sky on the ceiling. This one however"—Draco taps the miniscule spanner against the side of the box—"is broken."
Harry steps forward, extends his hand jerkily. Regulus’ hand moves towards him and Harry instinctively flinches back. Not quick enough though, and the hand passes through his. It’s ice cold, sending a chill through his body, and Harry steps back, the edge of the kitchen bench stabbing into his back.
"Is that common around here, shops and bars having both a wizarding and Muggle side?"
Harry has fresh croissants ready on the bench and a half drunk tea sitting in front of him as he waits for Draco to arrive. The house doesn’t look as awful as it did the day before. There’s a tightly wound worry in his stomach at having someone new inside his space, and that kept him up all night cleaning and sorting and trying to make it at least a little bit ordered. He wanted to make the house look less like a place that had been abandoned for almost a decade, and more like a place someone would want to live in.
James gets annoyed with her, and Albus rolls his eyes at her. But Scorpius is always there for her, holding her hand as she runs around the room, or putting her on his hip, even though he’s hardly much bigger than her. They make quite the bunch, their little patchwork family.
“You’re wrong,” Draco says, the words like ash in his mouth. “You’re wrong, anyone could say those words, you don’t know they turned up last night.”
He freezes, his whole world focusing down to the words on Harry's’ chest.
"It is a bit dreary in here isn’t it?" Draco wanders around the room, peering at the mantelpiece, and Harry feels like the place is being appraised. Maybe Draco will get out his dragonhide journal and start making notes soon, turn in a report at the end of the day like when they interview witnesses. "Still, it feels less oppressive than it used to, that’s something."
"She was here first," Draco says, with a pointed look, like that makes any sense, and he gives her a long pat. "It was hers long before it was ours." He gives her another long pat, and this time when he brings his hand up to her chin she bumps her head softly against his hand.
He’s just starting to think he might be falling back to sleep when something bursts his comfortable bubble. It takes a moment for him to recognise it, the sound immediately familiar. But even so, it takes him a moment and Draco’s groan, buried into his collarbone, before Harry places it.
“Can I?” he asks. “I want to make you feel good.”
Draco's hands still and he looks up, slowly. Harry feels a slight satisfaction at the look of pure shock on Draco's face. It's a rare delight, something Harry treasures every time he sees it, the fact that Harry's caught Draco
expected it—but then who
is what is going to take him out.
It’s a bit gross, all things considered, he really should care, should move to clean the rest of it away, should do
It’s probably the Firewhiskey that stills his tongue, that stops him from telling Harry no.
It's not what he would have expected, not that Harry knows what he would have expected.
It’s the sound of Draco’s breath and the instantly recognisable sound of wanking, along with the occasional bump of a firm hand against his own hot stomach, that brings Harry back around. The desire still flowing inside him is what makes him move. He wants to see Draco get off, he wants to help Draco get off. He wants Draco to get off on him, to mark Harry up like Harry just did to Draco.
Bed is upstairs again, a luxurious-looking room with a large window, but Harry pays it all no mind because Draco pushes him towards the bed, and Harry goes.
"Don't let me force you there Potter."
He doesn’t know when it stopped being a crush and started being something more.
wanted this. The desire is there, and it’s almost like he can’t remember a time when it wasn’t.
It feels nice to let it go.
Or will Regulus be forever stuck in those years, when everything felt so acute, so strong. Everything felt so life and death back then—and fair enough, many of the things
Someone in the room is making noises, it sounds like someone is choking and Draco realises it's
Draco is flustered, in the way he so rarely lets other people see. Harry's seen it on only a few occasions himself, and even then only briefly before the mask slips across his features once again. Harry isn't so naïve as to think Draco isn't affected by things, but he knows Draco doesn't like people to see him like that. Harry can understand; there's something personal about letting someone see the effect something has on you written across your face.
He’s never been good at taking things slow—Harry’s an all-in sort of person. He makes a decision and sticks with it, and he’s always been that way about relationships too. Even if he’s been having a harder time actually
"If they wanted to come by they should have done so earlier in the day honestly. If they've got a problem they can take it up with me." Draco lets the words hang as he shoots a spell Harry doesn't recognise towards the door, and the shop dims again. "I own the shop Potter."
Like now, standing in front of a mysterious door.
“Oh, you’re back,” a voice says, finally drawing him back to consciousness. Harry blinks his eyes, trying to clear the fog from his brain. He looks up to find Draco standing by the bed. He’s holding Lily. Her hair is still white blonde, no sign of the strawberry tone it’s started to take on now. She looks about as alert as Harry feels, eyes drooping, and face tucked into Draco’s shoulder.
"I have Kreacher," Regulus says, but it sounds almost like a question.
“Come on,” Draco mumbles, when Harry is still just standing there,
It’s a necessary evil to seperate, Draco sliding off his lap and giving him some space, before tugging at Harry’s hips. Harry lifts his hips off the sofa obediently, letting Draco strip him of his trousers and pants. Draco even takes the time to pull off Harry’s socks. There’s something about that, either in the act itself or the tenderness in which Draco does it which warms Harry's insides. Draco shoves his own trousers and pants down, stepping out of them and kicking them aside, and then he’s standing naked in front of Harry.
"This is me."
One more glance and Harry notices a little rainbow flag in the corner, the edges rolling over like it's waving in the wind, and
things, leaves Draco reeling.
. It had all been so ridiculous, so teenage. Even the memory of that makes him wince these days.
“Just leave me alone Harry,” Draco says, fingers finally finding the door behind him, and then he’s gone, out the door and leaving Potter’s voice behind him, as he runs with his jumper still clutched in his hands and his scarf wrapped half around his shoulders.
"Would you like to come in?" Draco asks, his voice quiet, like he's trying to get his breath back as well—and Harry did that.
are all around them, and Harry feels nervous, uncertain of where this is going (literally or physically) but it doesn't bother him the way it might usually. He's okay with not knowing.
"There's no minimum requirement to being gay. Or Bisexual. Queer," Draco says, gaze pinning Harry firmly from across the table. His eyes are a deep steel grey, like the sky before a storm, and the way he's staring Harry down reminds him of watching the clouds coming towards you with no shelter in sight. Inevitable. Inescapable. "You don't need to speak Polari or know where the nearest Mollyhouse is. The only thing you need to know is that you are."
"So what have you been up to then? Working in a shop? I wouldn't have imagined that."
"Are you going to do it all by hand then?" Draco waves at the produce on the bench.
"You have a Muggle side of the shop?"
"The house has another Master," Draco says, rotating his wand in his hand. "It explains why I wasn’t finding any connection between you and the house."
"Couldn’t resist
"Of course you do Potter. Who doesn't?" Draco says with a flashy grin. He takes a sip of his wine, finishes off the glass. "That's enough."
Harry opens his mouth to retort, when Draco’s hand wraps around his wrist, squeezing tight. The action is familiar, and Harry bites back his words.
His stomach feels like it has wings inside it.
His own cock is throbbing, long ago moved from interested to insistent, and he’s so hard it almost hurts. He pushes his own pants down, climbing over Draco to lay beside him. He wraps his hand around his cock, his other hand coming up to tangle into Draco’s hair, tugging and using it to pull Draco’s head to face him and capture his lips in a kiss. Draco’s lax in the aftermath of his orgasm, and it’s less a kiss than an open-mouthed brush of lips, breaths hot and heavy between them.
"How new?"
“They’re just words Harry,” Draco says, even if they feel like more. Four words that hold them together, like a string stretched between them, and Draco had never expected to have this, hadn’t been prepared. “Words don’t bring people together, can’t bring them together. Lots of people have words and they don’t mean anything.”
If there ever is another time, Draco thinks he might like putting on a bit of a show, if only to have Harry’s eyes on him, to see the hunger clear as day across his face as Draco slowly reveals himself.
"Luna."
"Do you want me to make that for you?" Draco asks, and Harry nods, steps aside, and then settles back against the bench and watches Draco work his tea magic.
Draco takes pity on him, or maybe grows impatient, and he closes the final distance between them, a hand coming up to rest at Harry's stomach and the other sliding to hold at Harry's neck, and then Draco is finally closing the distance.
“Mmmm, thought you’d left for work.” Draco’s voice is muffled into Harry’s chest.
but when it comes to investigating a scene he’s just as happy to take it in from a distance, even photographs are adequate for him. Draco, however, insists on getting up close and personal, placing himself in the scene absorbing the scene from a proximity. Even the cold cases they work often involve Draco walking the scene, running his hands over the walls, as if they will tell him their secrets. If anyone can hear what they have to say, it’s Draco. It would explain how he’s so good at his job.
Harry treasures every time. He’s trying not to rely on it, but it’s hard not to, getting harder to resist. It’s a treat, really. When he’s had a hard day he doesn’t fight the urge to head to the Room of Requirement, one foot in front of the other until he’s back to the third floor corridor again.
“I don’t think you get a choice there.” Harry’s hand is playing with his collar, but his thumb is pressing down on his skin, where Draco knows the mark rests. “Did you know Muggles don’t have soulmarks? I’d never even heard of them. I didn’t realise that — I never knew.”
, and he doesn’t look away, their gazes locked, caught like one of the Cornish Pixies back in second year, until one of them finally cracks and looks away.
, the most obvious thing to do seemed to be to read about what blokes got up to. It's just one of the things that got him hot, had him jerking off against the sheets and coming far sooner than he'd like to admit. And also sealed that yes, he was
"I think that can be arranged."
“We need to talk,” Harry says, words barely more than a whisper, and spoken directly into Draco’s ear. He feels Draco stiffen in his arms, and there’s a part that mourns that, but Harry knows he needs to do this, and needs to do it
Harry catches the way Draco rolls his eyes, but it doesn’t look annoyed. Harry knows his annoyed face, knows the curve of his lips and furrow of his brow. Harry leans down to kiss him anyway, to stop any more questions from this dream Draco.
"Have you thought any more about the job offer?" The expected offer had come through from Cold Cases earlier in the week. Harry had been quick to decline, but he knew Draco had yet to give them an answer. There’s a chance Draco will take it, and the thought doesn’t scare Harry like it used to. Maybe it’s because Draco’s been spending nights over at Grimmauld Place, maybe because they have something growing between them, and Harry knows they’re both the sorts to at least see where this goes, to follow it through even if it’s not the easiest path to take. There are few things that can stop either of them, once they decide on a course of action.
Draco looks so tired, but he looks like his, he’s holding the door open, arms spread wide, and it looks like an invitation for Harry to step in and hug him. Harry’s sure it’s not, but he wants it all the same.
The windows are set into walls that meet the lake, the filtered light just enough to see in the room. Draco heads to the window now, walking around the desk in the middle of the room. The window is round, and the ridge is wide, wide enough to sit on, Draco knows from experience. It’s where Draco goes, pulling himself up to sit on the window, back leaning against on curve and legs propped up against the other. He leans his head against the window, the surface cool against his hot face.
His own cock gives an agreeing twitch, and Harry rapidly changes mental track, shoving aside all thoughts of what he
"Your turn," Draco says.
Regulus waves the words away dismissively, and just like that he is every bit the aristocat again, looking down his nose at Harry—which shouldn’t even be possible given that Harry has definitely got a few inches on him.
Those words send a chill through him. The heat disappears and Harry's stomach drops through the chair.
He’s never been good at resisting temptation though, and it’s hardly a moment before he’s opening the door and stepping through. The room is exactly the same, the oh-so-familiar bed, made with the same sheets he remembers. The bed made perfectly and sheets all straight, just like Draco prefers.
"A little birdie suggested I check it out," Harry says.
"It is," Draco agrees. "What are you doing in it?" His tone isn't suspicious, more curious than anything.
. The investigation is a necessary part of his job, but he’d rather be doing than investigating. He’s happy when they’ve figured everything out, when there’s a clear course of action to be taken, happiest when they’re
A hand at his shoulder cuts off his thoughts—and it was panic he realises now, hands still stuck in the fucking sink and
It's hot and tight and slick, and it's so much Harry lets out a broken moan that he does a shit job of smothering against Draco's skin.
"Then you can keep doing it," Draco says. "You sort dinner, I'll sort drinks." Draco doesn't ask for an affirmative before he strides off… somewhere. Harry expects to hear the front door, or the Floo, but his footsteps go down the hallway instead, and Harry hears the sound of a door opening, though he isn’t sure where. But Draco’s already been snooping around his house all day; it’s not like there’s anything else Harry has to hide.
Harry drops his hand from where he'd been holding Draco's, reaching for Draco instead, following what he
Harry drinks and almost forgets, ready to take whatever Draco’s giving him. He’s not sure what’s happening here, but he can’t imagine fighting it, can’t imagine doing anything but what Draco wants him to do, and that’s probably a thought he should examine in the future, but he can’t fathom it at the moment. It’s Draco that stops him. He only lets Harry have half a mouthful and then reminds him, "swirl it," and Harry does, the movements awkward. He feels flushed and hot, something that has nothing to do with the wine, and everything to do with Draco, and the tone of his voice when he says, "swallow."
Harry scarfs down some beans and sugared yams. His invisibility cloak is hanging from his back pocket and concealed beneath his school robes. Hermione has mostly spared him from lectures, and Harry thanks the Gods of Ancient Runes for inundating her with work so she has no time to yell at him. After a week of Harry’s…
Malfoy has made a clearing in the field of rubbish, and he is standing before the cabinet that Harry stored
“Your medallion, Harry, it must be ready by now,” Sirius says in tones so hurried that it send Harry into that shadow, that habit of panic, but in his chest he feels no such thing.
Harry wonders. And wonders again. Then he realizes he didn’t form this Room at all. So he changes the subject.
He presses into something, but there’s no give, so he adjusts a little lower and finds it, and she sinks down on him in response. Her lips part, her eyes close, then some sound comes from deep inside her belly and spills out of her mouth. She’s warm, velvety inside, soft and glove-like, and he can feel her flexing and rutting and moving. Her tits bounce in languid circles, and together they find a rhythm, Harry slamming up as she presses down. He finds her spot again, but she swats his hand away and rubs herself, and her sounds get louder and louder. Blood rushes in Harry’s ears; he could be moaning too, he doesn’t know. Not bad for a first time, he thinks, somewhere off in his mind. Ginevra bends over, bites his shoulders and moans slow, guttural, desperate, and her back pulsates.
Malfoy is dashing through the hall of toilets, just rounding the corner as Harry comes upon him. He throws another
Harry cranes his neck to look at her. Something stirs, he feels himself hardening at her touch, so he tells her, “I do,” in a gruff voice. He would be nervous. He
“You want to bring them here and what? Kill students?”
“Of course! Or, I visited him in Beauclair once too, but often we heard a little about the other’s whereabouts and subsequently ran into each other, like destiny, he would say.” Sirius still talks with the accent of a Beauclairois man, even though he was taken away at the small age of twelve. “I saw him the last time not long after your second birthday, when him and Lily had taken up refuge in some small Temerian camp. He was dressed like a common man, and so wiry and paranoid I hardly recognized him anymore.”
“Come on,” Sirius bargains, with absolutely nothing to offer except a little charm.
Malfoy shrugs, then looks again at the pile of ash on the floor. The sight of it elicits another mewl. “Why are you following me anyway?”
Harry sucks his ale back, exhales, and kicks away from the bar, leaving Sirius chortling after him.
“Harry, wait!” Sirius calls, “We must go! We have to flee!”
“Good,” she says, exhaling. “And Harry? You can talk to me. About anything.”
“Not afraid of those gits.” Harry watches the Room of Requirement forming on the adjacent wall- Malfoy must have begun forming it far down the hall. A plan comes strikes Harry, a terribly stupid one, but still.
“You know what? I don’t need you here to find it.” Harry steps back from the door. “Go.”
Blaise is asking questions about Potter’s invisibility cloak, probably plotting a heist in his head, when Pansy comes strutting up.
Most of the herbs, incidentally, are picked completely over. It is the summer after all, and it’s likely that the townspeople are hoping for some extra crowns from the herbalist, so it’s a more difficult expedition than Sirius planned for. They only have a hand full of Celandine flowers and a single Crow’s Eye by high noon. The sun is scorching, and Harry isn’t used to missing so many meals. He lays his gambeson over the back of his horse and continues shirtless, still sweating. There’s a little stream flowing from the top of a hill, so he cups some tepid water and slurps it into his mouth, then dunks his head in and watches minnows float by.
“He was my Godfather.”
“Fuck you,” Malfoy says, kicking, pulling Harry’s arms.
James just stares, spectacles cracked in one lens.
Sirius sighs, “Any contracts around here? I’ll do ‘em all for a set of beds, hm?”
!” Harry shouts, and the cabinet lights fire from within. It’s not a good idea, what with all the ancient stuff mounding the floor around them. He waits, Malfoy wrestling desperately in his hold, until the glass is sufficiently melted and the wood properly incinerated. “
The innkeep’s daughter does not reply, just stands frozen, mouth agape.
Then there is a pause so long that Harry begins to suffocate beneath the weight of it.
Harry follows, and sinks just as low, raising his hand the hilt of his Silver Stag. In the distance, inside of a meadow which is so brightly lit by what seems like a centralized beam of sunlight, is a beautiful young bride, dancing alone. She has long, braided hair, and pretty, simple face with tanned skin, and she’s slender in her white dress. She spins haplessly, weeping a little, and then stops. She locks eyes with Harry and smiles, a sad smile, tears dripping from her eyes. She reaches her hands out gently and beckons him forward, so he stands, leaves his sword in it’s sheath, and walks towards her.
“I sleep good in the loft,” Frye nods.
Neville is standing in the main hall, surrounded by the other boys, who are hemming and hawing at what he is holding up for them. It’s his medallion, red-eyed, and blackish-silver, the head of a wolf. It’s a witcher‘s best tool, and none would part with theirs willingly, as it grants them a level of sorcerous detection that is needed for fighting most magical beasts. It’s also the best icon of a witcher, and being that it’s rather large and gaudy, you can tell a witcher from his medallion about a mile away.
It’s nearly ten minutes to four in the morning when James Potter begins coughing up murky water. His heart had returned to a comfortable soon after being brought here- Severus was monitoring- and now, it seems, his body is coming back into it’s strength, warmth returning to his fingers and cheeks.
“Tell me what they’re making you do,” Potter says, which is way too perceptive, way too poignant.
Another boy takes the table next to Harry, and doesn’t so much as look at him. He’s from Lyria, Harry vaguely recalls, but he speaks to no one, and takes this witcher business all too seriously for someone only ten-and-seven, who isn’t even a witcher, yet.
“We’ve got enough for the pub,” Sirius says, not asking, and walks off to hitch his horse along the troughs on offer outside.
Malfoy smirks again, and it looks very much like a dare.
book. Swear you got rid of it?”
Malfoy turns his nose up, and says, “Try me, Potter. Give me a reason.”
Malfoy reaches up to cast it again, but even doubled over, Harry anticipates it and disarms him instead. Tears roll down Malfoy cheeks. He does not hold his chin so high now, and Harry looks away.
Potter shoves by and heads for the courtyards. Draco catches up beside him and matches his stride. He can see Potter looking from the corner of his eye, the way his fists are clenching and unclenching at his sides.
“I couldn’t do it, either. I tried. Your aunt. I couldn’t…” Harry says, remembering Bellatrix and her sick laugh, the rattling of her heeled boots as she ran, the flow of her black coat and her mop of hair.
“I know that you won’t anyway,” Hermione smiles, a tinge of weariness reaching her eyes.
Malfoy is not the same anymore.
“What, you going to snog me, Malfoy?”
Malfoy grimaces, then he turns and kicks an old portrait until the frame comes apart. The frame’s inhabitant starts protesting in a different language, perhaps Latin, so Malfoy kicks straight through the canvas.
“Oh,” Malfoy says, regarding his fettered wrists as though noticing their position for the first time, “You’ve convinced me.”
“What? Have you?”
The innkeep must be away, because it’s his daughter who’s tending the bar. They’re a good day’s ride from Kaer Morhen, but their horses are beyond fatigued, and even Harry is growing stupid from lack of sleep. The innkeep’s daughter has big, doll eyes, and she stares at Harry and Sirius with equal parts, like she can’t believe there are two
, Sirius always says.
Harry knocks on the door twice and interrupts Ginevra singing a folk song in her mother tongue. Harry can hear the splashing of water, the smell of lavender and calendula, then the padding of bare feet on stone and dripping water. She peaks around the door, her long, wet hair swinging behind, and yanks Harry inside.
“No,” Draco shouts, “No one else. It has to be me.”
Curiously, Malfoy lets the tiny blue bird come from within the cabinet and perch its talons upon his finger. It shows it’s wings off for Malfoy, the delicate line of it’s feathers flexing.
Draco nods. “What stopped you? Why couldn’t you?”
“I’ve stabled my horses with the blacksmith in this village, once. Perhaps—“ Sirius gives his tired horse a good tug on the reins and Harry does the same, and they walk down the empty main road.
“No, but a Nightwraith,” Sirius grins, “How different are they, really. Careful, Harry. Try not to be seen.” Sirius then hoists up the hill and sinks low to the ground, drawing his silver Lune, and skirting the large Berbercane bushes.
“You did good, Harry. Nothing like a first fight.”
Malfoy must realize he is cornered because he turns on his heels and faces Harry down, his wand pointed from high in the air. Harry can vividly imagine the jagged scratch of the bizarre word in his Potions book:
“What’s got you cross?” Draco says. There is an air of coolness about him that is mastered. Like Occlumency. Like wearing a mask for so long that it won’t come off.
“Thanks,” Harry says.
“Still? And nothing I presume? We know he’s in the Room of Requirement, so have you—“
“Your friend? In Lyria?”
It’s bizarre, and Harry feels guilty for the thought, but there is no reason or rhyme that Neville should have survived this long. When he came to Kaer Morhen, he was a sweet, chubby kid and so craven that it made him stubborn. He couldn’t balance a sword, he sneezed on the herbs he picked, and he cried near every night. He’s gotten better with the swords, to be sure, and perhaps he doesn’t cry or sneeze as much, but there is a softness to him that should have broken him open and split him in two. He keeps Harry from drifting too far away, as it is, so Harry doesn’t mind. There’s a great deal of relief knowing Neville somehow survived the Trial, when maybe others deserved it more, or may have been more successful swordsmen. If there are Gods, they chose Neville for something. There’s comfort in that, Harry thinks, but he hopes the Gods didn’t choose him for something too.
“We can’t flee!’ Harry shouts back, barreling down the hill.
. It smells like licorice, if it could rot.
“I’m not lying,” Harry says, “All that it said was, '
Harry follows Malfoy again. Perhaps Malfoy is baiting him, and that’s why he leaves plain as daylight in the middle of supper (and with less regularity, during breakfast and lunch). Pansy looks longingly after him, though if she were a smidgeon less oblivious, she might subsequently notice Harry.
There’s a woman in the window, eyes brown, hair braided, and she’s older, and she’s quite pretty. She storms out of the front door and crosses her arms.
Pansy is walking behind Harry in the corridor, stepping on the heels of his trainers again and again. He can’t say anything to her. Somehow he evaded expulsion after nearly killing a classmate. Harry is no longer in the interest of pushing it.
The thought leaves Malfoy frowning.
“You don’t know those things were his doing,” Hermione says.
He fixes the scabbards to his back and sheathes the swords. There is a looking glass, though a terribly blurry one, at the far corner of this room. He can see his silhouette, the silhouette of a man, and it shocks him still. When he looks closely, he can tell that his eyes are different colors. In the Trial of Dreams, a witcher’s eyes are mutated to be more powerful than a humans, and they often take on a certain bright amber hue. Only, just one of Harry’s became amber; the other, the eye on the side of his face with the scar, is still green.
Harry sticks his wand in a small crack beside the portrait. “What? Who goes there?” The Fat Lady cries, “Get back to bed!”
The evening air hanging over the harbor is so dense and cold that it weighs on one’s shoulders, smells like washed up fish and sodden dog, and feels like frostbite.
The Potter family was a wealthy one, and oh, it was quite the scandal when he took up with Lily Evans, even though she was part of the lower nobility. The Evans family sent their girls to tutors commissioned by the city, where the lowly children went, like Severus. And
There’s a patch of untouched Berbercane bushes clustered at the top of the hill, probably because the climb is somewhat steep and requires shimmying up several rock formations that look unforgiving. Harry points at them, and Sirius hitches the horses to a tree and they make towards the bushes. Harry’s medallion gives a little hum, but he’s sure it’s a mistake, until it happens again, then more consistently as he climbs the rocks.
Sirius raised the bagged tongue, and rot drips out of it. Both Silagrim and Mida’s mother wince.
around, you stalker.”
Their horses are not saddled, but it’s how Harry was trained to ride anyway and witchers flesh is tough, so the saddle sores are but light, faint itches between the thighs. Sirius says they’re two days out from the city when they unfurl their bedrolls and curate a little stack of kindling for a fire. Harry roasts a rabbit on a spit. They’ve grown so used to sleeping in the woods and forging their own that they needn’t speak on it or their roles anymore, it just works, a well-oiled clock. Harry hurts desperately for a bath, one which he never got after picking those sewent mushrooms.
loitering around my ship just as I happen to fall in the harbor,” he sputters, unbelieving.
Harry promptly feels worse than he has in a long time. He stumbles forward and drops to his knees beside Malfoy, not wanting to look at the damage but unable to look away.
Harry sinks into the bath and groans, feeling the knots in his muscles un-work, the tension seep out into the water. To a small measure of disgust, he can see the dirt sloughing off his body too, clouding up the water around him, so he dips in, scrubs his face and his scalp, and rises back up. Ginevra is standing by the tub, fingers waving on the surface of the water.
“Oh,” Harry blinked as he frowned after it, “Thank you.”
"Enough!" He shouted, standing up so suddenly that Draco moved back a bit. His eyes were burning brightly - like the center of a flame. For a moment, he looked down. Draco realized his good hand was shaking. He shook his head. Unbelievable. Part of him wanted to relish in the fact he had actually gotten a rise out of the old man, but he wasn't done yet. Not anywhere near done.
“Do you think that’s what it’ll be for you?”
“I’m okay, ‘mione,” he tried only for a small sniff to be given in return. “I missed you too.” He said and patted her back awkwardly, “But we’ve been standing here for ten minutes now.”
“It’s not just about Pansy,” Hermione had said while Draco hit his head repeatedly on the table during breakfast, “It is about categorizing people and limiting them by trivial things.”
"I'm not bad looking. I'm funny. What the Hell?" Ron asked, throwing up his hands. He looked down at Hermione. "Can you believe this?" He asked her. Hermione grinned back at him.
Draco almost tripped as he glanced around the platform to find Vernon Dursley looking at him. He was watching Draco warily, eyes slightly narrowed as he shifted.
“What happened to your neck?” Ron asked as he let go. Hermione hit his arm. “What?”
Draco watched as he narrowed his eyes at Harry, stubbornly keeping his wand in hand despite the dozens of wizards and witches who were watching him with expectant eyes. There was no way he was going to do it. No way. Severus may not be as bitter and angry as he once was, but there was no way he had come
“Sweetheart, you’re right but that doesn’t mean you can punch people.” She told him “They very well might take it out of him next summer.”
earn money while in Azkaban!” Draco said fiercely, shoving the instructions in his face, “Look! Can you even read? Or is that too advanced for your household?” Draco asked as Hermione bit her lip, nervously trying to intervene as Ron and Draco continued yelling.
blood on his sheets and also Draco was feeling empathetic now that he had Harriet. He really only had the snake for less than a year now, but if anything ever happened to her Draco was pretty sure he might become the next Voldemort. He had already written his Aunt Andromeda to inform her Harriet was now a permanent part of Draco’s life and his only request is that the snake outlive him.
“It’s foot quidditch.” Draco said solemnly and Ted paused before giving a sort of ‘close enough’ shrug. “Dean Thomas likes it a lot… he says there are other muggle sports too, but they’re not as fun.” He explained. Ted brightened.
Draco watched Alecto and Amycus fall to the ground before kicking their wands out of their hands. Sadie and Tristam walked over to grab them, taking off their robes to switch with them as Draco set to work tying them up.
Harry's eyes were searching. Draco got up to move in his line of sight. Voldemort was saying something, but he got the feeling Harry wasn't listening either as he met Draco's gaze and relaxed. He could do this, he could this, he could this - he
“And the Death Eaters? They returned?” He asked. That sidetracked Draco for a moment. Who had gone? All of them? Had his father been there?
however,” he said stepping forward, “Have proven yourself to be ineffective and disloyal. You didn’t even look for him when he disappeared.” He said coldly. Yaxley chuckled.
“Professor?” He asked politely. Moody’s blue eye had stopped swiveling to fall directly on him.
"You love them."
“You’ve always been such a loving godfather.”
“I would hope so,” Draco said, raising his wand, “It hasn’t been that long, Bella.” He told her. The group had gotten separated - a whirl of spells and lights sending objects flying and glass shattering. “I was hoping to run into you, actually.” He said, eyes flicking around. Ginny’s eyes fell on them before she raised her wand. Bellatrix flicked her own without so much of a glance at her, sending Ginny flying back.
In a very similar way, Harry was the real thing. He was the real thing in the sense that Draco was pretty sure he could kiss a hundred more people and nothing would ever feel as real or genuine or passionate. And - much like what he found with the wine - his tolerance was much lower than he originally thought. Whatever he thought he could stand of Harry had lowered drastically.
"Why?"
“He’s probably poisoning Draco’s mind with all that pureblood nonsense again.” Harry said, ignoring the question. He bit his tongue. To his surprise, Ron cleared his throat.
“I can’t believe you are blackmailing me to be your friend,” he grumbled and she smiled a bit at him.
"Blaise?!" He whispered and looked over his shoulder before pulling him further into the alley, "What the Hell are you doing here?" He whispered, "It's dangerous for you to be out of the safe house-"
“Either maroon or like… spring green, I guess.”
“You don’t know what I am. I don’t even know what I am.” Draco cut him off sharply, “But I’m going to figure it out… and for the record, I may not be proud of everything I’ve done, but know that when I figure it all out I’m going to be proud of what I will do. Can you say the same?” He asked. His father didn’t answer. Though, for a moment, Draco could have sworn he saw a hint of softness among the tight features and pursed lips. “I have enough adversaries in my life. I won’t tolerate you as one of them. Andromeda is my guardian. She will speak to the school if there is an issue. If you get involved again then know that I lived in your home for many years. There are things that even the ministry's raids wouldn’t be able to find… It would be a shame if they learn about those places. I will
Draco woke up to his ears being scratched.
"Draco's missing," Andromeda said and then lifted her gaze to meet Harry's, "If he's compromised I need to move them. I... last year, I made a few spare places to hide without Draco knowing. I knew if they caught him..." She trailed off.
“Draco too.”
“They did before,” he said and when Draco opened his mouth, raised a hand. “The mark burns occasionally. As I believe Dumbledore once told you, the Dark Lord isn’t fully dead. That does not mean he can return though. Karkaroff is a coward and frightened of his own shadow.” He said. Draco bit the inside of his cheek and looked away.
“I’m just doing my homework!”

“I’m going to bed.” Draco told them. His entire face was hot. All he wanted to do was disappear under his blankets and not move for three days. He began to storm up the stairs fiercely just as he heard Hermione sigh and Harry say:
....i say that as someone who has just finished writing a particularly angsty scene, but nobody needs to worry about that right now.
“No, no. I love strangers in my room,” Regulus rolled his eyes, “You look like my cousin. Narcissa. I mean, the eyes are different, but everything else...” He tilted his head “Know of her?”
“I’m coming. Don’t be such a nag,” he rolled his eyes at his brother. “Bye.”
"The kids went with Hagrid to the kitchens, right? Great," he said to the crowd, speaking into his wand, "When Hermione and Ron first got together, it was during the Battle of Hogwarts right before Harry decided to face Voldemort off in the Forbidden Forest. I was, understandably, furious by the fact I had absolutely no time to react to this information. However, I knew deep down I would get my chance someday to embarrass them fully and I believe that time is now... So, without further adieu... Ron... Hermione... what the Hell?" He asked and at Ron's face, pointed a finger, "No -
“Maybe they’re talking about the third task. Viktor said something about a maze.” She shrugged. Draco bit his tongue. Interesting. A little worrying. Draco pushed it to the side. Theo was dragging in more potions from seemingly nowhere (how many of these did he prepare?) and Harry was probably fine. Right? Right. Besides, Draco had other things going on. Gabrielle Delacour had appeared to bother him.
Draco swallowed. A giant was banging resolutely on some of the magic separating them from their opponents. They didn't have much time. Another shudder went over the castle.
“Thank you,” he said, voice barely above a whisper. Draco grabbed an apple and bit into it.
“Don’t,” Draco shook his head, “I’m always getting in trouble nowadays. I can hardly blame you. I think my house has finally worn off on me.” He said. Theo laughed. “Thank you… for still talking to me. For getting them to talk to me.” He added with a nod towards some of the other Slytherins who were all loudly trying to explain the purpose of the party of a puzzled Hufflepuff.
,” He tried. Harry scowled, fists clenching at his side. Yeah… that was probably why he didn’t know actually. Even Neville was aware Harry’s temper had been worse than usual. Smith might get more than a black eye if he encountered an unrestrained Harry Potter. “Come on, Harry. Please.” He said again. “Why do you even care? You’re mad at me-”
No. No, this was different. He was doing this to help prevent collateral damage. To help the kids and his friends make it out of here. Dumbledore hadn't spared them a second thought as far as he was aware. Ron gave him a sympathetic look before peering back down at the board with a look of utter concentration, tapping his fingers against his knee before nodding.
“That’s why!” Draco said, throwing up his hands, “Doesn't that make it even more perfect? I am the son of two powerful purebloods who has been disgraced and disowned. I was raised among Gryffindors, bloodtraitors, and muggleborns. I’ve been threatened, attacked, and had to change everything about myself to get where I am. If you were to choose between that version of me and the one who would have been sorted into Slytherin... which Draco Malfoy would you be more afraid of?”
“And you're...giving them to me?” He asked, a bit baffled. They were completely black, save the handles, which were an intricate mix of silver, dark green, and a shimmery blue. The metal felt warm at his touch.
“Do not!”
“It’s obvious,” Hermione told him, tongue stuck out in concentration as she tried to sew something resembling a hat together. “You two fight because it’s easier than actually sorting out your feelings for one another.”
When Draco said he wanted to play quidditch this year, he had imagined… you know. Playing quidditch. Not this nonsense. Harry, as usual, was in the midst of trouble. He wasn’t sure why nobody was stopping the game considering that bludger was clearly out for him. The weasel twins were doing their best, admittedly, but Draco could tell their guarding was irritating Harry.
“So you’ve received a previous disciplinary warning and you still decided to cast a… patronus was it? In plain view of a muggle neighborhood?”
"You feel... very please and think I'm the best person in the world? Why thank you, Draco!"
“That is no way to speak of the minister!”
"Draco!"
Maybe he would hunt down that Sherlock Holmes muggle if he was still alive. Together they could unravel the mystery that was his family’s complex relationships and never ending drama.
The diary. Draco knelt down, yanking it towards him as he used the sword to stab the diary. Riddle screamed. He stabbed again. And again. And again. More light burst forth and cries of pain followed and eventually he was left with a destroyed book and utter silence.
He looked over at the Slytherin table and tried not to react to the harsh gazes and raised eyebrows as he perched himself at the end of the table. A redheaded boy in glasses (Weasley, he was calling it now) greeted him with a tentative smile. Nobody else said anything.
There was a pause in the celebrations as the audience began to digest that this wasn’t a victory. Screams began to filter through along with gasps of alarm. He watched as others began shoving themselves forward.
"What?" Draco interrupted, a bit bewildered, "What are you doing right now?" Draco asked, poking Harry's shoulder. "Stop that."
Sirius frowned.
“What are you on about?”
“What are you-”
As predicted, Theo's planning and Draco's overcautious nature paid off.
you are not on best terms with Potter.” She added when Draco opened his mouth, “So I expect you to mend things. Then I expect you to find a way to
about it-”
"Hermione!" Harry tried to warn her, but Draco had already transformed - using his animagus for to sprint from the room, weaving easily between their legs. "Fuck -
Oh, how typical.
“That was a pretty impressive deflection,” Draco mused and then turned to see Harry looking at everyone cheering Cedric on helplessly. Oh. “Uh, but, you know, it wasn’t
“I think so,” he said and when Draco glared, sighed. “
Harry hated talking to Griphook, but their plan was finally starting to come together.
"I'm going to drink twenty butterbeers or die trying." He decided. Fred and George, of course, perked up from the far end of the table.
“I’m beginning to see why you need those ridiculous glasses, Potter. Your eyesight must be worse than I feared,” he said and the other boy smiled a bit. Draco frowned at him, not really expecting that reaction.
“Yes.”
“You are coming.” He said and jerked his head for Luna to follow. She gave a beaming smile before hopping up. Just as she went to move forward, she hesitated.
Great. There was Potter with his bloody hero complex. Rolling his eyes, he stepped back. Montague’s eyes lit up, perhaps sensing an easy target, as Potter stepped forward to hold out his hand - as if Montague would honestly hand the thing over. Draco sure wouldn’t. Not without making him work for it.
"Yep. I didn't say it was pretty though," he added and Jenkins snorted. Draco rolled his eyes. He supposed he wasn't wrong, but still... "Okay, if you can find that person who can translate for me get me his name and cell number." Draco told him, standing up, "Also, my offer still stands to break you out." He added. Jenkins grinned at him, eyes alright with amusement.
Dumbledore put the quill down.
Harry’s hand reached out, fingers gently squeezing tightly around Draco’s forearm. His father went on, but Draco was too busy trying to push away the initial hurt to listen. He wasn’t sure his father was aware that Draco was even in the room as he continued about his rampage.
“Here!” He greeted and dumped one of the sacks in his hand, “So we can raid Honeydukes.” He told him with a grin. “Then maybe we can go to the Shrieking Shack… if you’re not scared that is.” He asked, eyes twinkling. Draco scoffed.
There he was. That handsome-for-nothing son of a bitch. Riddle seemed torn between dismayed and pleased as he looked between his dead pet and Harry. Draco took a slow breath.
“It was a dumb reason,” Draco agreed. Harry rolled his eyes.
“I think my wrist is sprained,” Harry nodded and Draco glowered.
He couldn't just leave her in danger knowing that, could he?
In his experience, Severus usually went with truthful.
“Are you still pouting?” Draco asked as he stuck his tongue out of the side of his mouth in concentration. Upon realizing that the healing arts may actually be a good path for him, he decided to really go ahead and start learning some good spells and potions.
"I... I'm going to make some tea..." She murmured and absently walked from the room. A few people frowned at her - obviously concerned - but nobody stopped her. Donovan sighed.
“My goodness,” Slughorn beamed, “I hadn’t realized what a group of entrepreneurs we had!” He said brightly. “Mr. Potter, I do admire your friends.” He chuckled. Draco rolled his eyes.
Lee shouted when Draco brought out his wand. Was it against the rules? Yes. Was this maybe escalating beyond what the rules could handle? Also,
"Take him." He tried again and then looked back at Dora, "He's beautiful. Great work." He added and the baby shifted in his arms. No, no, no. No. Nope. Stop. Stop moving -
“Oh, yeah, sure. That’s why he showed up to your muggle house,” Draco said and rolled his eyes. Idiot. Harry sneered back. “Let me try… Dobby?” He called and waited. Nothing. “Dobby, I need you to carry these for me,” he said, holding out one of his boxes. Nothing. “Yeah, I guess he doesn’t listen to me anymore,” he deduced. Ron frowned.
Quirrell would realize Draco didn’t have the stone soon enough.
“Bellatrix.” A soft voice said and Draco flinched. Right. They weren’t alone, were they? He turned to find a pair of red eyes fixed on him. “We are not done here.”
That at least got Draco’s attention. He momentarily stopped his internal rampage to stare over the table. Predictably, he was talking about the new DADA professor. Draco was reminded of a chihuahua (which was a type of dog that muggles would sometimes owned… because muggles often owned dogs. There’s a fun fact for you). In the sense that both the woman and a chihuahua were small, ugly, and intimidating in a strange way.
) eyes. Now, Draco knew, in theory, that there was a good chance this baby would end up a metamorphmagus like Dora... they wouldn't be sure right away though. It was hard to tell when babies didn't tend to have a whole lot of features to change. Now that he was a couple months old he might be able to turn his hair a different color or something, but for the most part Draco knew these were the features he would have without the magic.
“So you like muggle studies then?” He asked. Draco wrinkled his nose.
“They won’t. I’ll make sure it’s anonymous.” He said and then tugged at his sleeve with a sigh, “What about you?” He asked. Draco shot him a questioning look. “Your dad. Are you going to say anything?” He asked.
“Nah,” Harry waved him away, “I saw a memory with him and my mom. He called her a mudblood.” He explained. Draco frowned. His godfather was an odd one.
though. The guy had a lot of emotions, but hate wasn’t one of them.
“No, I’m sorry,” He said and offered a hand to help her up, “You’re going to be fine. Let’s go.” He told her and grabbed Harry’s arm to also look over. Not a damn mark remained. Phoenix tears. Wild.
He would kill Hermione for sure. Probably finish Harry off for good measure too. Ron might be tortured. It… he… he couldn’t…
The knife blocked the spell.
“Your sob story doesn’t work on me,” Draco said, thinking back to his shouting match with Severus. Harry rolled his eyes.
"The only way I will forgive you is if you promise free babysitting for the rest of your life." She whispered back. Draco wrinkled his nose.
. Montague clearly wasn’t going to be able to do it. Draco shook his head. No. No, not knowing what he knew. He moved between them, ignoring Severus' eyes narrowing as he did so.
“Oh, I think I’m going to like you,” Ron told Andromeda, “Can you make him wash dishes?” He asked dryly. Draco narrowed his eyes. “Or, actually, laundry. Make him do laundry,” he said. Draco watched as a smile hinted at Andromeda’s lips.
"Can I see the watch?" He asked Ron. Wordlessly, he tossed it to him. Harry gave a nod of thanks before slipping inside the tent as well. Draco was lying on the bed - staring at the ceiling. Harry cleared his throat. "Can I come closer?" He asked. Draco glanced over at him and shrugged. It was more than he usually got so Harry considered it a win as he made sure to stay in his line of sight, kneeling next to the cot he was in. "Hold yours." He instructed, tapping the watch. Draco looked at him and then slowly grabbed at the end of the chain around his neck.
"I am sad," he admitted, "Not in the mood to talk about it though. Go back to sleep." He said and Harry gave a soft sigh before he nodded into Draco's shoulder.
Draco began, sounding a bit hysterical.
“Leave her alone, Sadie.” Zoe sighed, glaring up at where a rain cloud had formed directly over her (and only her). “Before I have Tristam use his banshee powers to-”
He couldn't see his aunt. She was shrouded somewhere in the masses of chaos. It made Draco more nervous as he looked around - trying to find a sign of her as Dora caught her breath behind him.
Harry seemed to understand, eyes drifting towards the crumbled pieces of paper by his feet. Without another word he squeezed Draco’s shoulder before retreating towards the portrait hole. Draco watched him go before turning back towards the fire. He still needed to find Fleur and Gabrielle to tell them goodbye. Gabrielle, in particular, was downright
You know, there was a pureblood myth out there that the founders of Hogwarts could sometimes serve a patron guardians in times of need. For example, a Ravenclaw might see Rowena Ravenclaw when faced with a particularly difficult task or a Hufflepuff might see Helga Hufflepuff when a gust of wind tried to blow them over. Things of that nature.
“Aw, I don’t care,” Draco mimicked back, “I’m her best friend so if I don’t like you… you're out,” He said with a click of his tongue. In truth, that wasn’t really how it worked with Hermione - it never had worked that way - but he would rather McLaggen blame him for the relationship not working out than accuse Hermione of using him (which… she was, but still). “Now say daddy is calling you and leave.”
farce,” he told her, but Hermione didn’t seem to hear him as her hands straightened her robes, picking off any remaining lint. Ron was nodding in agreement with him. Harry looked confused – as always.
"Maybe we should take a break from experimenting," Neville told him and checked his hands, "You look like you're healing up quite nicely. Did the wraps I give you work?" He asked and Draco glanced down at his hands. They had healed pretty quickly per Sirius' advice on limiting his transformations and Neville's clever use of wrapping wiggentree leaves around his knuckles.
"Well, technically," Draco began and winced at how uncertain his own voice sounded, "It's just something I would... rather you not be involved in." He told him quietly. Did he like lying to his friends? No. Did he feel guilty about manipulating Harry in some instances? Of course. The thing was... well, truthfully... if Harry knew the big picture then he would be... difficult and Draco just didn't want to deal with that.
“I came to apologize,” he said. Interesting. Draco got the feeling he was expected to say something along the lines of ‘no, I should apologize’ but he wasn’t going to because he had yet to decide if he believed that. “Well, to apologize and also see the task… not that I saw anything other than people exiting the water.” He added with a frown.
It was a little funny at first, but Draco ended up becoming his dedicated person to look out for him now. Hermione said it was because he had a good heart (ugh,
“Yeah, okay.” He said and picked up his broom, “Wish me luck.”
to Hogwarts. I think it’s clear that this boy has recklessly endangered our existence enough times-”
“Why?”
"I didn't
"Well, fine. Say his name and we'll all go together!"
"Pay her no mind," Draco says, pulling his work back towards him, picking up the tool in his hand. From his closer position Harry can see now that it's a miniature spanner—something Harry wouldn't have expected Draco to know the name of, let alone how to use it. "She's a fickle lover."
“Forgot since yesterday?” Draco asks, huffing a laugh against his skin. “She’s not so small at three in the morning when she won’t let you put her down without fussing.”
Harry looks down at him, and Draco feels his pulse pick up a beat, and he wishes he could say it was from the shock of the book. Draco feels the urge to fidget under his gaze, and wishes he was back in the room surrounded by only books and the familiar lighting from the lake.
"A lot of dust?" Harry asks.
"Andromeda was disowned," Regulus says.
"Only if it’s fresh," Draco says, which is as much an affirmation as anything else.
It usually takes Harry a while to feel comfortable around people. He rarely shares space with others, and when he does it's a gradual process. The first nights he shared with Ginny were plagued with restlessness, as he worked through the unfamiliarity of intimately sharing a space with another. Maybe because the Dursleys were never cuddly with him, maybe because he never got to experience the sleepovers that other kids had, or maybe it’s just something about
, and then
“How do you know?”
It’s a pure-blood thing maybe, the ability to put that level of disdain into his words. It cuts right through Harry.
“Do it later?” Harry asks, stepping forward and pushing Draco back with his body with every step, herding him back in the direction of the bedroom. “I’ll make it worth your while, give you a back massage.” Harry illustrates his point by bringing his hand up to Draco’s shoulder, giving a squeeze at the muscles there, just as tight as he’d expected. Draco carries his tension in his shoulders, and after a night up with Lily, Harry’s unsurprised to find Draco feeling tight.
Harry’s moves are anything but subtle as he grinds down against Draco, interrupting his words and looking like the cat that got the cream. Draco wants to wipe the look off his face, but he wants Harry to keep going more. It’s intoxicating, the feel of Harry against him, and Draco wants it to
"You’re Harry Potter. And you’ve been living in my house."
"First," Draco says, the wine glass suspended between his fingers, "you want to swirl the wine. It aerates it. This wine has been resting in a cellar for twenty five years, it needs to breathe a little." Draco swirls the wine and the deep red liquid moves in smooth waves around the glass, the liquid sliding down the glass in its wake. "Always smell it first, you taste with smell as well as with your tongue." Draco slows the wine glass's movements, and the waves slow and then cease altogether. Harry watches as the wine regathers in the bowl of the glass. Draco raises the glass between them and he leans in, sniffing at it, until Harry repeats the gesture. "When you take a drink, do it slowly and only sip a little. This is wine to be savoured, not devoured. Before you swallow,"—Draco raises his eyes to meet Harry’s—"swirl the wine in your mouth for a few moments, and then you can swallow." Harry searches Draco’s eyes for a hint of laughter, but he’s serious now, the amusement from only a few minutes ago lost somewhere along the way.
"Oh you do go on." Draco’s voice sounds pleased, and there’s a hint of colour in his cheeks, nothing to do with the heat from his tea. And this, this is one of the things Harry might take a little too much joy in, getting a reaction out of Draco, making him flustered. He shows it so well, the flush of his cheeks stark against his pale skin, and the usually sharp line of his lips twitching on a smile. Lately Harry’s been thinking too much about what else might make Draco flush like that, what would make him flush
A throat clears behind him.
when Draco’s made it. He probably went to some posh tea making class with all his posh mates. Either that or he’s spiking it, and if that’s the case Harry can’t bring himself to care. He’s getting bloody good tea made for him, who is he to question it?
Harry would ever do to go back there but still… in a way… some of it was easier.
Until Draco pulls away from him. Harry's already chasing him without even thinking about it, but Draco uses the distance, small though it is, to get his hands on Harry's hips and
If Pansy were here, she’d understand. If Pansy were here, she’d be sitting opposite Draco, legs intertwined like they used to on the days when everything at Hogwarts was too hard, too much. Pansy’s always been the first person he runs to, the first person he tells his secrets too, even when he felt like he couldn’t tell anyone.
The doorbell rings, and Harry tips the rest of his now-cold tea down the drain, leaving the cup in the sink and heading to the door.
Family dinner’s quieter now it’s just the three of them, and Rose and Hugo. There was a time it had grown so far out — Ginny would bring the boys, and they’d bring Scorpius and Lily— and the house was an absolute ruckus. Almost equal to The Burrow, it had been so much, almost too much, but he misses it now. Rose had asked after Lily the first time, she’d been so enamoured with her littlest cousin. But since the first time he’d stammered out a response, and Ron had pulled her away, she’s not asked again. Harry knows Ron or Hermione must have said something to her about it. He appreciates it, he does, but sometimes the silence hurts more, the unacknowledged absence hanging between them.
A waitress catches Draco's eye and she waves at him in acknowledgement. Draco nods back before walking to it, Harry following in his stead.
So he does. And if Harry is finding a little bit of comfort in his days gone past, surely he’s earned that, hasn’t he?
. Draco needs to reestablish some sense of control, so he brings his hands to Harry’s shoulders, digging his fingers in hard enough that he sees Harry wince from it, and shoves him, adding in a sharp knee to Harry’s side for good measure. Harry tumbles sideways, ending up flat on the bed on his back and Draco quickly throws a leg over Harry’s body, sitting over his stomach and looking down at Harry.
"And what am I supposed to do with this?"
Of course it has nothing to do with avoiding Harry. He’s not. It’s just convenience that means he stays in the library until it closes, then some days he goes back to the Slytherin study room. There’s a secret bed, shrunk down and tucked away in the corner, and it’s what Draco uses most nights. It’s stiff, and Draco, being the creature of habit that he is, misses his bed, and misses his sheets and misses his pillow, and he’s having even worse sleep than usual, but he makes do. He tries not to think about the only night he slept through, exhausted and wrapped up all warm in Harry’s arms, as he wraps himself up in the blanket that feels like it can’t keep him warm, on a bed where he feels like he can’t get comfortable.
, the nights of little to no sleep, and the aching
“Fluxweed,” he whispers, hoping the password still works, hoping it didn’t close down like Snape’s offices had after his death.
"This has been pleasant," Draco says with another sip of wine. Draco's hands wrap around the wine glass like they've done it a hundred times before. He has an effortlessness about him that Harry envies just a little—the way Draco can just ease into things and still look so elegant at the same time.
It feels natural, the way Draco fits into his arms. It feels
Harry takes their dishes to the kitchen and Draco follows along behind, watching with some humour as Harry runs the sink, spelling the water hot and then adding in a splash of washing-up liquid.
"Good wine?" he asks. His voice croaks a little on the words.
But even when he couldn’t bring himself to cook in the kitchen, it was still his safe space. A place to come when he needed some space from everything.
and he doesn't even realise he's not headed for bed until he finds himself standing outside the Room of Requirement again.
"Was that better?" Draco asks. His words are hoarse and sound as strained as Harry feels. It makes his head swim.
"I don’t know," Draco admits after a beat of silence, and Harry thinks there’s more to it than that, but he can wait Draco out for the explanation. He’s had years of practice. "I’m not sure what we can do because I’m not sure what’s going on. As far as I can see there’s no explanation for how the house is even still alive. It needs a master, but it doesn’t appear to have one."
Harry pulls down his pyjamas and pants in one go, leaving them at his thighs as Draco’s cock springs up, almost hitting Harry in the face.
“You talked about me in your therapy?”
"I didn't quit the Aurors for this," Draco says, his face shutting down, earlier pleased mood gone. "I quit for me. And I don't feel like it was giving up anything."
, Draco breaks the eye contact that was becoming almost suffocating and bends forward to take Harry’s cock in his mouth.
“That tends to happen in the morning, Potter,” Draco snarks, or tries to, but his mouth is still half in the pillow, and his voice catches on a gasp when Harry pushes down against him, forcing him into the mattress.
Draco huffs a laugh. "Yes. I'm thinking if this doesn't work out I might start drawing for the
medal is in the kids toy chest at The Burrow.
He’s not even sure how much later it is when his rest is interrupted.
“Maybe,” Harry agrees, too easily really, and almost
"Is there a chance that could happen here?" Harry asks—he’d not really considered it, not seriously anyway. "Are we safe here?"
He can’t help but look over her. Dream Lily is smaller than Lily, probably only around six months, if he had to guess. She’s got nothing on the toddler that gets around now, spouting words and noises that Harry’s supposed to understand and chasing after the boys any chance she gets.
"He’s also Andromeda’s grandchild," Draco adds, and at that Regulus’ face flickers with a flash of recognition.
emblazoned across the front. He hadn't even thought about it when he got dressed this morning, but now he really wishes he had. Harry Potter, the Boy Who Never Thinks Things Through—although to be fair, he hadn't really expected to be crossing paths with one of the poshest kids from school.
Regulus pins him with a look, and Harry feels like maybe he should apologise for it. Says instead, "The house was left to me."
"What?" Harry says at the same time as Regulus echoes the words.
Draco rolls his eyes, but Harry’s used to that.
"What do you know about sentient houses?" Draco finally asks when he's finished his dinner. He tops up his and Harry's wine glasses. Harry isn't sure he needs any more wine; he can feel the red flush of it all through his body. "Do you know how they come into being?"
Then Draco’s thumb is gone, and Harry watches as Draco brings it back to his own lips, slides his thumb into his mouth, and the air rushes out of Harry's lungs, sounds a lot like a groan.
Draco in particular throws himself into them, and once he’s got a lead it’s like he’s spotted the Snitch and he’s after it, full steam ahead. The cold cases require more research—which Draco loves—and often involve tracking down and interviewing people who’ve lost all faith in the Aurors—which Harry’s good at. There’s something about putting
, and he hadn’t even meant to call him Potter, but the old name slipped out without him thinking about it.
Harry's voice sounds uncertain, even to himself, and he kind of wants to kick himself. Harry James Potter. Can fight against the biggest threat to the wizarding world and put his life on the line at his job every damn day, but can't even say what he wants.
"Right well," he says, trying to restore some normalcy. "Prepare yourself for the best pasta Genovese you’ve ever had."
“You slept with me!” Harry says, his voice loud, almost a yell, and Draco flinches. He sees Harry notice, and he can tell he makes an effort to pull himself back, swallowing visibly, and when he speaks next his voice is quiet, for all the power and tension Draco can practically taste on it. “You slept with me then. And now — this. You won’t even talk to me when we’re — when we have
“That’s bullshit, Harry.” Ginny’s words are sharp and there’s a heat behind them that he wasn’t expecting, when Harry turns to look at her again the look in her eyes makes Harry want to look away. “Of course Draco wants you.”
"It has to though," Draco says, frustrated. "It’s like a plant; you can have some plants which thrive with lots of sunlight, and some which can survive on very little, but they all need sunlight at the end of the day. Some can survive without light for a period, but eventually the plant needs the sun or it will die."
"That's bullshit," Harry says, the anger rising in him. "Sirius was my family. And he left Grimmauld Place to
He’s not even sure it was real. At least that's what he tries to tell himself.
He wants to watch, to take it all in, but he only sees Draco’s lips wrapping around his cock, feels the heat of it, before his eyes fall shut, and it takes every single ounce of his self control just to remind himself to
Harry’s still got his wand out, pointing squarely at Kreacher. He drops his arm, letting it hang at his side.
"I wasn’t sure the cellar would let me in." Draco’s voice interrupts his musings, Harry closes the door to the cool box and turns to face Draco who has a dark bottle in his hands, covered in dust. "These houses can be very protective of you know, but I thought it was worth a try, and look what I found."
Maybe it has something to do with the easy way that Harry obeys too.
"Should it be?"
Draco winces at the last one, but he can’t find the words to explain. It’s not you, it’s me just sounds so empty.
The thought alone is like a knife to the gut.
He knows Draco got around a bit, in his
trying to leave bruises on his skin.
Just an ex-colleague. Someone Harry misses. Someone he hopes to see again.
Harry wraps his arms around Draco, leaning into it and appreciating the touch and how easy it comes. He tries to focus on Lily on the blanket and Draco’s arms around him, and just for once ignore the thoughts that have been running through his head since talking to Ginny.
is what he sees first, red on Draco’s hands held out in front of him.
"It’s like there’s nothing there," Draco says, later, when he’s finished his assessment of the house. It took far longer than Harry could have anticipated, all through the morning, only stopping for something to eat and then back to it again; the house was larger even than Harry ever realised. Harry followed Draco around as he made his way through Grimmauld Place, opening up rooms Harry had never seen before—that he didn’t even know where there. Draco seemed to know where the doors were, either through some long ago memory or just an awareness. Some rooms looked like they haven’t been touched since long before the house passed on to Harry, or even to Sirius.
, but it’s
If Pansy were here she’d listen, and she’d understand and everything would feel better.
“Mmm yes, I can’t believe you slept through it. I just thought you were ignoring us.”
Harry's never had much rhythm, and this is no exception; he thrusts jerkily into Draco, but then Draco takes over and it turns into a steady pace of Harry's cock sliding between Draco's legs. It's hot, so hot, and Harry has to get his hand on Draco, has to feel how this is affecting him too. Harry's hand drifts down, and Draco's hand not wrapped around Harry is resting low on his abdomen, fingers against his pubic hair. Harry slides his hand over them to get to Draco's cock, wrapping his fingers around it. Draco's rhythm breaks as he jerks into Harry's hand.
"I have fed you," Harry points out.
“Hello,” he says, as if he were greeting an old friend and not a semi-sentient door to a semi-sentient room.
being trained into him, and for all the dangerous things he’s done, all he’s survived, a fucking
And standing in the middle of the floor, with a dour expression, is a face he hasn’t seen in years.
Kreacher gives a somewhat tired-sounding groan and turns to face Harry.
It’s asked easy enough, Draco’s tone light and almost teasing. There was a time when they would have been snide, a time when those words would have set Harry on the attack, but it’s been years since Hogwarts. In those days every word shared between them would put Harry on edge, fluffing up his fur like Crookshanks used to at any sign of a fight (the old furball does it less often these days, the years turning him softer; there’s even a rat that’s taken up residence in Hermione’s back garden, that Harry once spotted running right past Crookshanks’ gaze, with not a flicker from the ginger kneazle cat—the years have turned them all a bit softer really). It may have been years since only a word from Draco could raise his hackles (not even a word if he’s honest, just the presence of Draco, looking at him,
At some stage during the night they must have shifted to sleeping on their sides, Harry pressed up against the back of the sofa and Draco facing Harry, their bodies pressed close together. It’s a minor miracle that neither of them had fallen off the sofa even considering the arm Harry has wrapped around Draco.
Regulus turns away with a huff, and Harry is reminded of his own teenage tantrums.
"Oh shut it, you," Harry says, waiting for Draco to finish with the tea. The moment he places the tea bag in the bin, Harry is crowding into Draco’s space. He pulls Draco into his arms, buries his head in the nape of Draco’s neck, and feels the warmth of his skin as he inhales his scent. He could stay here all day. Draco presses back into him, lining their bodies together. He groans into Draco’s neck, biting down on the skin warningly. "Don’t," he says, "there are children around. Teddy’s in the hallway."
Harry chokes on the sip of water he's just taken, but when Harry finishes trying to drink his water down the wrong way, and looks at Draco, Draco's grinning at him.
“Draco!”
"I went to therapy,” Ginny says with a shrug. “Maybe you should try it.”
, does too, and Harry doesn't, but then, that's never stopped him before.
“I think,” Draco’s voice cracks on the words, and he swallows again to clear it, before trying again. “I think maybe we should have that talk.”
"You’ve been here before?"
The door comes easy, a relief.
Draco’s been getting under his skin in other ways these days, something that Harry’s been trying to overlook with varying degrees of success. It’s becoming increasingly hard though, and the change of pace in their cases isn’t helping either. When they have an active investigation, it’s easier to ignore how Draco looks, to ignore how sometimes Harry sees him stretching out and just feels his body run hot, his stomach clenching and his mouth going slack. It’s a problem, one he’s not coping with well. Seeing Draco outside of work doesn’t do much for the want that’s always inside Harry, just waiting for the moment to strike, like a snake in the sun.
, and it feels unfair to but it’s a little harsh to say there’s something
the riff-raff that come through this door," Draco says, with a pointed look in Harry's direction.
Harry continues his way to the kitchen. He sets the charm on the kettle to boil, and sets out a cup, a tea bag, sugar, and milk as he waits for the water to heat up. The act calms him a little. He can still hear the noise coming in from outside, the voices and laughter. It’s all going swimmingly, everyone’s having a great time, but it’s just…
"And would that be so bad?" Harry asks, "Making your own item? You could repair it and recast the spell—make it as it was?"
“We’ve talked about these things Harry,” she says.
. "Please," he gasps again, fingers tugging at Draco's hair, hard enough that it must hurt. Eventually Draco goes, pulling off Harry’s cock with a filthy wet noise.
flashes unbidden into his head, and it hits him so hard he lets out a low groan.
Which could only mean...
, things going weird, stuff moving around and never where it should be. There are noises too, some nights he swears he can hear the stairs creaking, but he can never tell if it’s the house keeping him awake or his own mind playing tricks on him. It’s enough to leave Harry feeling a little uncomfortable, never really at ease. He’s been staying later at work, and making excuses to go out, but it’s starting to wear him down, and lately he’s felt so tired, tired of feeling uncomfortable in his house, tired of feeling like he’s still looking for a place of his own he can call home. This was Sirius’ home, once. And he has some nice memories here—some shit ones too, but there aren’t many places Harry can think of that don’t have a bit of both. Sirius left Grimmauld to Harry, and Harry kind of hopes that maybe it could be his.
“What do you think you’ll do?” Draco asks, the words slipping out.
Draco knocks his shoulder against Harry’s, a small smile on his face, not the usual smirk he sends Harry’s way, or the grin he uses at work, or the baring of his teeth that makes you feel seen and caught all at the same time. It’s something else, a different smile all together, just between the two of them. Harry soaks it in, loses himself in the smile and Draco’s eyes for a moment.
Severus sighs and stands, realizing he must bear this farce for just a little longer before it will grant him his fruit. He outstretches his hand, offering to pull James from the floor. “I was taking a contract from the Port Master. Animal has been stealing cargo at night.”
“Shut up,” Potter bites.
“I would think you would be in your glory—“
Harry glares at him. “Sure thing,” he mumbles.
Hermione stares at him, and maybe it is not intentional, but Harry feels very stupid for it. “Well,” she laughs, “It doesn’t matter, now, does it.” She slaps the top of her thighs, looking ecstatic that she won’t have to hear about it anymore.
“What?” Harry asks, though it sounds more earnest than he means for it to.
It’s the villages leatherworker, Silagrim. He’s a stout old man, perhaps in his sixtieth year, but he’s practiced at his craft. The leather and oil smell permeates the air around his home, especially in the sun where he’s tanning new hides.
Draco can feel the blood rushing to his cheeks. “You don’t have to be such a prick about it.”
“Crow’s eye, single, bluish berry protruding out of a quad-leafed plant.”
Together they seal the front seam, and when Harry glances at them in the great mirror in the corner. they are both invisible. Though they are both tall, not even their toes stick out from beneath the cloak, as though the fabric learns the shape of its user and adjusts.
“You can sleep in my bed,” Frye says, “Cause I like to sleep in the loft, anyway.” He points up at a few planks and a bed of straw that are wedged between the walls of the house. There’s a rickety, homemade ladder climbing up to it.
Harry draws the cloak together after Malfoy leaves it. Malfoy approaches the wall, a nondescript grouping of stones.
“Your common room is shit,” Malfoy says, evaluating the tapestries on the walls, a little crystalline lamp.
“Fred and I are going to Lyria,” she clicks her tongue, “Leaving in the mornin’.”
“Lave cakes,” Crabbe says, somewhere on the fourth floor.
“What does it do, Malfoy?” Harry growls.
“Yeah, gathered that.”
“I meant it,” Harry insists.
Harry is acutely aware of the ample gawking when they walk in, Sirius first and then Harry, and they are examined in such an order by most of the pub goers. A little silence comes over the room leaving the bard to fill the space with his bawdy song. Sirius walks like he owns the place, as if his pants didn’t stink of the road and his hair of sweat. There’s a set of redheads at the bar, from Skellige most like, drawing from the accent. The girl laughs- roars, really- at what may have been her own joke, and her companions laugh with her. Her hair is a deep orange, so shiny and straight it moves like a sheet of silk. She throws it over her shoulder when she turns to size up Sirius, then notices Harry.
Sirius’ face goes to stone, and he throws back the door to the basement stairs. Damp air floods up and carries all kinds of smells with it, what with all that is stored down there. It’s an affront to the senses. Both of them cover their noses for the descent. Sirius doesn’t speak for a while, not until they are back in the kitchens, and he’s warming his palms by the fire even though it’s the middle of summer. Harry knows not to push it.
Crabbe and Goyle do as much as they can to non-verbally express annoyance behind Malfoy’s back. Goyle employs Malfoy’s prim step and Crabbe stifles a laugh.
was a grave misstep according to their peers, and they were cast off thusly as fraternizing with the poor. So Lily Evans stood one foot in alleys, orphanages, and pubs on the outskirts, and one foot in horse races, masquerade balls, and mansions, her big sister Petunia tagging behind all the while.
“It’s not,” he whispers. He whispers it a few more times, and the woman rolls her eyes.
“Cedric—“ Harry starts.
“Do me a favor, will you?” Malfoy says. Harry can’t look away from Malfoy’s grey eyes, welled with tears. How stark a change from the whooping, gleeful boy he found moments ago. It’s like Malfoy to whine, to cry when he doesn’t get his way, purposed for manipulation. But Harry- maybe he is seeing things- discerns a horrible sadness that was never there before.
Sirius pauses against the rock wall and shuts his eyes to listen. “A mountain cat,” he says, then, “No. No it’s a Noonwraith.”
After a time, Sirius breaks his silence, which had grown almost meditative, trance-like. “We’ll talk about them,” he says simply, then, “Tonight.” He turns and walks away, two swords on his back. The steel one is named Wolfbite, and the silver is Lune.
“They aren’t
He really, really can’t.
“You bastard.”
Harry picks a black one which fits him nicely, except it’s a little short. Sirius chooses a dark brown leather, one that is perhaps form over function, but still, the leather is exceptional and strong. They bid the leatherworker and his wife farewell, and drop Mida’s tongue in a swampy lay beneath a bridge.
“Potter found Draco while he was defenseless,” Pansy cries, her tone venomous. There is a small crowd of Slytherins flocking behind her. “Then he and his Weasleys cornered Draco and beat him,
Draco feels naked, so his spreads his hands over his face and digs into his eye wells with the heel of his palm. Potter is still staring when he drops them.
Sirius agrees with the blacksmith that he will get some herbs for the blacksmith’s pregnant wife in exchange for stabling the horses for a night and a bed roll for each of them.
His steel sword is standard issue, so he hasn’t bothered to name it. The silver, however, was a gift on his last birthday. There was no wrapping, no tag, it just appeared on his bed. It’s stunning, carved with elven script along the blade which never gathers blood nor dirt somehow. It’s imbued with a magic which poisons its victim, and lends the metal a serene turquoise glow. He named it the Silver Stag, after his father. Sirius said it was a good name, then insisted that he didn’t gift Harry the blade, with a wink.
“Tell Granger I said good luck,” Malfoy says, eyes glinting, a smirk going over his face like he doesn’t have tear tracks drying on his blotched skin. Then he goes jogging off to the exit. Harry looks over at the pile of ash.
“ Just, you know. You can’t tell anyone,” Draco says.
He tries not to look too eager until he is out of the doors of the Great Hall himself. Just as soon as he enters the corridors, he spots Malfoy disappearing around the landing of a large stairwell.
, he thinks, in the voice of so many others and to great distaste.
u don’t need to read this to understand the rest of the story, though, so pass it up if you are die-hard drarry lol
“Thanks. Where are we going?”
“I didn’t mean to,” Harry says.
“Ugggggh,” Sirius groans, “Brooding, are you? Stop, you look like you’re father.”
“Coming from the witcher castle?” she asks.
“Stop,” Malfoy says, every word annunciated, “Ruining. Everything. Potter.”
“Liar,” Potter says, and he stops walking.
Draco’s face twists up. He trembles as he runs his palm flat across his hair, affixing lost strands.
Malfoy has got a fear in his eyes, one that Harry imagines he is reciprocating like a mirror. Malfoy’s eyes begin to drop shut, his breath reduced to stuttered gasps, the already pallid complexion of his face going blue.
Harry strikes her in her back once, and then reaches around to cut open her stomach. The stench is disgusting, worse than anything Harry thinks he’s ever smelled, pure death and decay retching from her innards. She spins a vortex of dust so that Harry can hardly see her or Sirius, and he refrains from waving his sword blindly for fear of injuring his companion in her stead.
“You don’t have to do it just because your family wants you to,” Potter says.
“What is it, my sweet?” Filch coos. She meows eagerly back.
Harry fidgets in his seat. Hermione doesn’t acknowledge him more than a glance over her book. Ron has a mouth full of food so he just elbows Harry quite hard in greeting. Harry digs around in the mashed potatoes and turkey legs. There is a cranberry tart down by Dean that he feels like skipping dinner for.
“Your father was the least obedient a child could possibly be,” Sirius says, “And Gods, Jenny wished he would behave, your Grandmother, that is. He was their singular child, the heir to their estate, and he was wilder than a nobleman’s son should be,” Sirius smiles, recalling memories. ”We met because our families lived in neighboring estates in Beauclair, and we would hop the hedges and sneak around like bandits in our manicured lawns. We spent every possible minute together. I only made the acquaintance of your mother once, to tell it true, but James told me about her amply and she sounded magnificent.”
Harry drops Malfoy on the floor and looks up. This is wrong. Harry must have formed this version of the Room accidentally.
“The stables, Harry!” Sirius is still yelling.
Crabbe and Goyle won’t be long behind him, but they haven’t come yet, so Harry must manage to buoy just between them and Malfoy.
,” James squints his eyes, “were
. Anyway, lately, the things come back.”
“Figuring out what you’re getting up to.”
“So at Borgin and Burke’s, I asked that old troll what Draco was up to in there,” Hermione says, “And he forced me out. They must know something. I’d like you to take me to the cabinet, if you would, so I can examine it for enchantments or—“
The courtyards are empty due to the weather. There’s no one around to see that Draco is clutching his wand so hard that his knuckles are bone-white. He’s standing between Potter and a reasonable escape.
It makes Harry fall over the edge, and he spills into her, moves her body by his grip on the fat of her ass and rides out the wave. She kisses him on the nose and giggles as she climbs from the tub, then offers him a towel.
“Good, Harry. The good news is if we find a bit extra and can manage to get some flasks, well, we’ve got the makings of some Swallow on our hands.”
She only glares in response.
“Ah, better not,” Harry says, gripping the other corner in his fist.
“I don’t know anyone like that,” the man looks down at his hide for a while, then continues scrubbing.
“It’s my business when I’m certain you’re dealing with Death Eaters. It’s my business when you might hurt somebody else, they way you did Ron. Or Katie.”
Harry hears the echo of his own voice to some delay, watching the pattern of his wand’s making as it blooms over Malfoy’s chest. Malfoy puts his pale fingers to the wounds. When he catches sight of the blood covering his fingers, he begins to tremble. Then his legs fail him and he lands hard on the floor.
“You ever fought a Noonwraith?” Harry asks, whispering.
Severus lays the man down not so gently on the mud-and-fiber floor. He spits up more water and it dribbles down his chin, so Severus turns him over to his side to prevent choking. Then Severus tucks up against the wall, swords laid beside him, arms hanging over his knees, and waits.
Malfoy laughs, but he does not smile. “I must have missed the lesson.” He pockets his wand, still gripping it tight in his hand. He spins around and keeps on toward the Room.
Crabbe and Goyle’s voices are sounding down the hall, quickly growing louder, and Malfoy full out grins, his straight teeth in Harry’s face.
seen the Slytherin common room?”
Draco drops the cloak, affronted. He bumps Harry’s shoulder going to the door. He leaves, quite dramatically, and the Fat Lady begins screaming so readily that Malfoy screams back. And then he’s knocking desperately, so Harry lets him back inside.
Harry feels like crying. He may be already. He pulls Malfoy up onto his lap, pressing their bodies together to staunch the bleeding, sopping up the blood and tears on Malfoy’s cheeks with the pulled end of his sleeve. Harry is so, so done for. He will never get to finish his education at Hogwarts. They’ll probably put him in Azkaban, and Voldemort will have no trouble finding him there. Dumbledore won’t help him now.
The apprentices each crowd to the central table to fill their ladles with a pellucid liquid, only slightly blue in a certain way, and a series of whispers identifies this as Mother’s Tears. Harry’s apprentice is whimpering when she places her hand on the valve of the dripping glass, which will let a measured amount into Harry’s body at her command. They go on the count of the hooded mage, and when he commands to go, the apprentice hesitates. Harry shoves her hand away, the other boys screaming in agony just it hits their blood, and smacks the valve open.
The particular thing about this gawking is that it is noticeably worse. It has been since Malfoy. Since the incident in the bathroom. If Pansy didn’t tell everyone, then Moaning Myrtle covered her failure to do so. It was no secret that he and Malfoy shared animosity, but Harry attempted murder, albeit accidentally. Even the Gryffindors who secretly congratulate him scoot further down the bench.
Harry panics inside but won’t show it. “What was the cabinet for?”
Malfoy cries. He sobs so hard that his ribs contract in waves. It shocks Harry so badly that when his invisibility cloak slides off, he doesn’t have the mind to catch it, nor pick it up.
Harry shakes the mans hand, bows his head in thanks, and they go to unroll their beds in the stable. The summer nights are sticky, but mercifully less hot than the days, so Harry just shoulders off his heavy leather gambeson and tries not to complain.
Hermione stands and stretches, “Well you’d best get your cloak and go foil his plans.”
“Our daughter, Mida, died years ago. She was only sixteen, but was set to be married. We had the carpenter fashion her this arch in the woods, a fairytale, like we’d read to her. She was to marry a regular peasant boy, and we had no dowry to give, so it was best that way. Besides, it was clear she loved the boy. Except, ‘fore they married, he was found to be a traitor. She loved him anyway. So they hung her too, in the tree next to him. Makes no sense. But they did it.”
“When have
If Draco doesn’t do this, Voldemort will kill his parents. And he’ll kill Draco too. The Black and Malfoy lineages end right here, with him.
Harry feels the contents of his stomach rise with a fury. He should be happy that Hermione is finally endorsing his recent fixation. He hopes his panic doesn’t show. He doesn’t
“If you’re going to—” Draco stutters. “I have to… I have to stop you.”
“I hate you,” Malfoy says, his pristine hair disturbed in the commotion.
“What sort of things was he putting in there?” Ron asks.
They are nearly the same height, but Harry feels much bigger, and Malfoy recently being so waifish and wan confers the illusion of a significant disparity between them.
“To see a friend of mine.”
Harry overtakes him. He takes Malfoy by his skinny wrists, flicking his wand to the ground. It makes a weak sound like a dropped twig. They have switch positions in a blink, seemingly before Malfoy can even realize. But he doesn’t kick, or tear, or punch. He just laughs, which gives Harry pause.
“Yes, Harry. I think so.”
“Thank you, Harry,” Neville tells him, sincerely.
She’s just as pretty up close, big, teary brown eyes and a welcoming face. She grabs Harry’s hands, and she’s shockingly cold, but she sweeps them into a dance, like one might at their wedding. Harry spins her, and pulls her in, and she weeps against his chest.
“Your ceremony is tonight at dusk,” Sirius tells him, waggling a thick eyebrow. He is perhaps as old as Harry’s father would be, but he looks no older than twenty, and he’s got a splay of black curly hair that meets his shoulders.
The other students gawk up at Harry— which is not unusual— as he walks through the Great Hall to his usual place on the Gryffindor bench. It has occurred to him that, for example, Seamus or Neville have no idea how it feels to be stared at often and so unashamedly. It’s happened since he was eleven, since the very moment in Knockturn Alley when he realized Hagrid was telling the truth about his name.
“I know someone else who will explain it better than I.”
“Paranoid? Paranoid of what?”
“Regret what?” Harry says, knowing well what Draco means, but wanting to buy time before he must reply.
“Get bent,” Malfoy snorts.
“No, they cut our tongues out.” Harry kicks off his boots, then his pants, resists the urge to cover up.
“About that,” Harry clears his throat, “I was hoping you could tell me more about them. About what happened to them.”
Perhaps the worst thing is Harry won’t get the smell of troll dung out of his nose until he’s sufficiently simmered his flesh in the bath. It’s curious, because Harry doesn’t feel so different than before. Less nervous, in fact, not nervous ever anymore, not fearful, or terrified. It’s only the habit which remains, and that is fading too. He used to quiver in the troll caves over his basket of mushrooms. Now he smells the change in the air, or hears the loosening of gravel, or the incessant droning before a troll could ever surprise him. And, if a troll dropped in his lap, he’d be hard-pressed to be shaken by it.
“In your dreams,” Malfoy says, then he raises up and steps around Harry like he is a pile of excrement that he’s trying to avoid.
stalking, Hermione has given up her opposition. She rolls her eyes laboriously while Harry scoots the bench back to leave. She sighs.
Harry doesn’t want to leave, can’t, it would be cowardly, unbrotherly of him. But Sirius is frantic, or as frantic as a witcher can be, so he hangs a right, cuts into the neck of a sorcerer in all black robes on his way by, and heads for the stables.
,” Sirius says, slowly. “A young woman, a bride, who died before being able to marry.”
Harry heads to the chambers, small, cramped beds with little distinction between them. Some of them have been cleaned, made, reset. Ready for new initiates in the next cycle. To train for five years, every day, to learn thousand-page bestiaries to the letter, to stand for hours in the rain on a single foot. To die. Harry is lucky, in a small way.
Malfoy is nothing if not consistent.
Harry clears his throat, then plucks the strings on the side of his jerkin which he mindfully thinks to give a good wipe down when he’s done.
,” Harry begs.
The hooded mage lifts his head against the significant bowing of his spine, and just beneath the shadow Harry can tell that he is smiling. He is the only one in the room, in which there are maybe seventy others in total, who is smiling, Harry is sure. Harry grabs a table just by the window, where moonlight is pouring in. Neville follows.
him.” She stomps again on the ankle of his trainers. Harry clenches his teeth, grinding the molars.
“What does it do?” Harry twists his wand into Malfoy’s windpipe. “Nothing? Just an ordinary cabinet?” He points his wand toward it, deliberating.
Harry nods, knocks back a half of his mug.
Malfoy doesn’t even acknowledge Harry. He disappears down the hall.
Harry looks around at the whirring mess, a cacophony of small, timeless sounds. An old clock strikes twelve every nine minutes. There is a teapot that is bigger around than Harry. Beyond the mess of it all is Malfoy, and the chirping of a bird.
“So get on, go do whatever you usually do, and I’ll stick around here,” Harry says, folding his arms and leaning back against the door.
Malfoy doesn’t budge. In fact, he looks like he expects Harry might tackle him again. Harry nods.
“Gingy Weasley was caught snogging
“Thanks,” Draco swallows, “For the other night.”
Harry is trying not to skid as he runs on the tile, though his trainers are slippery. He’s got to do something. Katie Bell almost died because of Malfoy.
He runs back to Sirius, who is fighting her once more. Harry runs towards her, swords straight up in the air, and leaps. He wraps his legs around her exposed pelvis, the bones cracking and pulling apart at his weight. His sword cuts through her spine like butter, and her head goes rolling as Harry crashed down with her body.
Potter’s consciousness returns to him just enough to allow confusion and he shoots up, then scrambles back at the sight of Severus. “Where are we?” he shouts, voice hoarse. He grips his throat, then his chest, and takes in the sight of his own miry clothes. Severus tosses him his glasses; what a wench the dive for them was, after he’d thrown Potter up on the deck. They sunk all the hundred feet to the bottom of the harbor and embedded in the swirling muck, and Severus nearly abandoned them. It was a vindictive thing, the motive which made him retrieve the glasses. Potter would need them.
“I’ve never—“ Harry starts, then closes his mouth.
in. Harry contends some panic over whether the book is still there. Not that Malfoy needs help with potions class, though he’d be happy to figure how Harry swiftly became top of the class.
“Don’t get caught,” Harry winks.
“It’s not any of your business.”
“And you still stayed, after they killed your daughter?”
“Stealing your style,” Malfoy says quietly, so as not to wake the entirety of Gryffindor house. Harry considers that. How would they feel about one of the most notorious Slytherins in current attendance trespassing in their grounds? Harry cannot measure how he feels about it just yet. He looks back down at his cloak.
“Someone will hear her,” Harry tells Malfoy. “Someone will help.”
“You don’t want to know.”
“Not worth any more trouble, Harry,” Hermione says, typical austerity in her voice. She’s posturing the way she likes to when she is absolutely certain, her round chin high in the air, shoulders square. She is small, but Harry still shrinks before her, even if he rolls his eyes.
Harry can’t argue that, but he’d sooner die than give up the invisibility cloak, so he says “I can walk down with you.”
“I’m Harry… erm, of Toussaint.” It’s continent tradition to state one’s heralding country in greeting, not Skelligan, but she is here, after all. There’s no mistaking the thick accent.
not to say anything.”
Except when Severus survived the Trial of the Grasses and returned to Beauclair to find her, she was living in the Potter estate.
“Pretty,” Sirius elbows Harry, “But nosy. Still, don’t gotta talk to do what she wants.”
Malfoy doesn’t respond. He glares, sheathing his wand, stepping around Harry, seeing if Harry will stop him from leaving. Harry isn’t sure if he should.
“Got to start sometime,” Sirius shrugs, “And if you play it right, we can save the coppers on your room.”
Harry understands the subtext.
, he once told Harry, and it’s true. All of the other elder witchers are just that: elder. To see Sirius, young and eccentric, next to the old white wolves is a real sight, but Harry has never questioned it. He is rumored to be one of the best swordsman Kaer Morhen had ever seen, and to no less importance, is intensely paternal.
Harry pinches the bridge of his nose, suddenly imagining that he has only foiled Malfoy’s dreams of becoming a muggle entertainer.
“Second year. Polyjuice.”
“I knew your apology was worth old boot socks, you wanker,” Malfoy laughs.
Harry was assigned to gather sewent mushrooms in the troll caves this morning, even though there’s a healthy stockpile of them in the basement that might last a decade. It’s something that Uncle Sirius does, makes the boys do errant tasks to keep their hands busy. The Trial of the Grasses was just last week, and Harry is only newly well. Still, here he is, pulling sewent mushrooms out of sticky mud, like he didn’t wake to find sixteen of his companions dead to the very same mutagens that have strengthened him. The living boys will have their ceremony by tomorrow evening, likely, to receive their medallions. But it will only be Neville, Harry, and five others. A good ratio, Sirius told him, a bit weary. Usually it’s only three to every ten.
“It’s a terribly long story, one best told—“
“So,” Hermione says, ”Where have you been disappearing to, Harry?”
It proves successful all the way up into the seventh floor, just beyond where the Room of Requirement lies. Dobby said this was where Malfoy went, when he was doing whatever sinister plot he was concocting. Harry can hear Crabbe and Goyle echoing behind him, their apish laughter coming loudly off the stone. Harry must look behind for too long, because when he rounds the last corner, Malfoy is there waiting.
and just wait a while. He’ll explain this to the Fat Lady so that she won’t yell at him.
Harry lays back on the stiff table, which is at a slight angle, so it has a foot rest to stand upon and not slide off. It’s bare slats of wood that create the support, and the nails go awry and press uncomfortably into ones skin. It’s stained with blood.
Harry notices that she has blocked him from ascending the stairs any further. “It’s gone,” he tells her, which is not a complete lie. In case he should need it again, it’s safe in the Room of Requirement. This particular version of the Room was massive, filled with old, lost junk. Any student who happened upon it would think it no more than ordinary textbook.
“What does it matter?” Harry snickers, which makes everything much worse. Draco really doesn’t frighten him, and he never has. The first year Slytherins won’t even look Draco in the eye. Harry Potter, The Chosen One, laughs in his face.
“Sod off, idiot,” Draco says.
“You see the caramel corn?” Goyle says, miming eating a cob.
Some of the older witchers, the ones who went through the previous Trial of the Grasses, are sitting by the fire, knocking back ale, and looking on with deadened expressions. Their wolf head medallions hang there, sure as shit, from each neck, a little taunting thing. Harry looks over and says a silent promise to himself he will never watch this happen to someone else.
“So he is sending them somewhere,” Hermione says.
Aldersberg is the name of smaller city just outside of Lyria. It’s fitted with gigantic stone walls that pop over the horizon miles off and sports a healthy flow of traders in and out, so the road to it is busy, cramped even. Sirius pays the herbalist for some flasks which he fixes to his belt, and they take contracts for some river Drowners and a particular wolf from the notice board. They never do go after the wolf, even though it’s a good offer of forty crowns for the head, but they do scalp the drowners for their fins and collect the measly recompense. Sirius splits it with Harry and they each buy a saddle for their horses, and Harry scores a new set of boots from the local cobbler. He throws the old ones to the side of the road.
The bartender shoves two mugs on the bar and Ginevra raises her finger in a call for more wine. She turns on her stool, totally ignoring her companions to stare at Harry, and leans backwards against the bar. She must be young, no older than twenty, and she wears Skelligan garb that’s striped red and green. A little, well-balanced dagger hangs from her belt.
“Yeah, I still do.”
“What does it matter?” Draco says.
“Lyria,” Harry says, then Sirius gives him a little jab beneath the bar. Harry turns away from her, takes a sip of his ale.
Malfoy creeps to the door, stopping just when his fingers meet the handle. He contemplates something and says “Touch me again and I’ll kill you,” before slipping through the exit.
James nods, leans over to fix the tie of his boot, then leaves.
“I wanted to see if you were the Heir of Slytherin.”
They trail silently along the perimeter of the courtyard. It looks as though it might rain. Draco knows he has to say something, since the two of them walking together for too long might draw a crowd. Being this close to him is bound to end in chaos.
“Speaking of, I’m turning in,” she leans forward, breathes into Harry’s ear, and whispers, “Third door on the right. Knock twice, I’ll let you in.” She gives him a friendly pat on the back and retreats to her room.
“For enemies,” Malfoy mutters eventually. He sneers and pulls his arm away, tending delicately to the cuff of his sleeve. “Do you regret it now?”
, they called Potter. And here he is now, just shy of a year after Severus’ return, silk shirt soiled with sea water, laying at his feet. It’s amazing how hurriedly men bend at the bribe of a bag of coin.
Malfoy has become wiser to Harry’s stalking. Harry is ambushed. He feels the soreness on his shoulder blades from being slammed against the stone once more. His sweater is balled up in Malfoy’s fists, but Malfoy has to reach for his wand. Harry sees a needle-eye opportunity, and threads it.
Malfoy twists around on the floor, raising to stand, his wand out for casting, and he screams, “
“Murderer!” screams Myrtle, “How could you? Murderer!”
Harry smiles, then, permits himself to. They gather the wealth of Berbercane fruit and Sirius figures he might reason with the blacksmith that the Celandine was well picked over, and he’ll have to be satisfied with the handful, though they do cross some Crow’s Eyes in the farmers field. They have to duck low and steal them, but who will know the difference?
, a simple fourth-year spell. The little ball of disembodied sound goes crashing down the hall. Crabbe and Goyle share a glance and go running after it, and Harry slides through the door just before it can vanish.
the one who told
“I won’t do it.” Draco shouts, over the sound of the pour and the thunder, “If you keep it a secret, I won’t do what he’s asking of me.” He isn’t sure that he is telling the full truth.
Blaise throws his head back, wincing and laughing all at once. Pansy seems disappointed when Draco doesn’t respond.
Harry doesn’t give himself time enough to consider it before he is reaching around Malfoy’s neck with his cloaked arm, wand pressing up his chin. The bird lifts in flight, frightened, and flies far into cavernous ceiling above.
Draco looks out beyond the bridge at the storm clouds rolling over the hills. Then he turns around to face him.
Draco cannot tell if he is bluffing. The sky lets out all at once, with rain so dense you can’t see ten feet ahead.
“Then he’ll just have someone else do it.”
“You’ve said that already. Where?”
The Noonwraith seems to be trapped inside the runic circle and she bumps against this invisible wall with such bubbling rage that Harry can feel it. He can feel her despair, her anger, her dread. It’s something they don’t tell you in the bestiaries and he wonders how many lose their last fights to these specters, these long-dead women.
“Journal. Wedding arch.” Harry takes deep, slow breaths, and closes his eyes.
“You’re one of them,” says Harry. “Show me.”
“Can’t imagine the shit you’ve got up to in this cloak,” Malfoy says, glancing over at Harry, once they are clear of Filch.
Harry feels like a child again. This is usual for them. This feels like equilibrium.
Harry casts
“Oh come on, Sirius.”
Potter keeps searching for something in Draco's face. Then he offers Draco his hand. Draco examines it, looking for the trick. Trepidatiously, he offers his hand in return, gives it a firm shake. Then he turns on his feet and tromps back through the grassy courtyard, muddying his dress shoes.
“Where you headed?”
“I’ll find out, Malfoy,” Harry says, “Might as well just tell me.”
“Where are we going, Sirius?”
“Right,” Harry agrees, picking up on the subtlety in which Sirius just told him they will likely need healing potions.
Harry is chopping his cranberry tart into very small pieces with the side of his fork when he sees the blob of platinum blonde raise up slightly and start making off toward the doors. He dares himself to look, and there goes Malfoy, rushing out of the Great Hall, his gait so long and graceful he appears to float.
Harry hears the screech which makes Sirius decide so, and his heart gives the echo of a thump, but doesn’t really. Leftovers of fear, fading a bit each time.
Harry walks into the laboratory of Kaer Morhen, where the elder witchers have lined up twenty-three table-like contraptions in messy sequence along the wall. There is a hooded old man, one of the mages most like, resting heavily against a table in the center, which is covered in cauldrons that are bubbling and shining all different manners of potions. Each boy was instructed to remove their armor, wear only underclothes, and to meet here at midnight. The apprentice mages are scurrying about like chickens without heads, pushing glass potion-dripping mechanisms into their proper spaces.
“It’s always you,” Malfoy says, quiet, weak, indignant. Harry doesn’t know how to perceive it. Malfoy continues, “Heir of Slytherin, youngest seeker in years, then the Triwizard tournament…”
It’s probably about Potter. Pansy won’t give up torturing him, which is good, because Draco doesn’t currently possess the energy to hound Potter as he used to.
Goyle huffs, longing. “I saw those.”
“Um, Berbercane fruit, plentiful on mountainsides, red fruit on a bulbous bush.”
Malfoy says nothing.
In the hall, Mrs. Norris is scouting ahead of her master. She sniffs the stone floor, then darts in circles around Harry and Malfoy. The yellow glow of Filch’s lantern approaches, limping along the hall with him.
“It’s gone,” Harry says. “I burned it.”
Her eyes are bright blue, even in the dim light of just a few candles. She braces herself on Harry’s neck with one hand and his knee with the other, and nods down to her spread legs, some kind of cue, so he touches her, watches her flinch. There’s one spot, one that makes her breath hitch and her pupils blow, so he keeps rubbing it, if awkwardly, if a little unskilled. Even in the bath water she is slick, and it has him twitching, leaking slick of his own. He takes himself into hand, then grabs her by the hip and lines up.
“Why should I believe you? Why shouldn’t I tell Dumbledore right now? You said it yourself, they aren’t making you do anything. You can’t claim
“Death Eater life not what you thought it would be?” Harry says.
Uncle Sirius grabs a few baskets off the stack that Harry is manhandling, and together they weave around the halls to the kitchen basement. Sirius isn’t
Harry drops his head between his shoulders and sways back and forth. He’s so exhausted. He checks the Marauder’s Map often, perhaps later into the night than he would admit.
Malfoy struggles harder, pulling on Harry with all of his weight.
. Harry shifts a little on his feet. There are boys his age in this inn that are looking at him like they want to string him up a tree in the town square.
“You may owe me a bit more,” Severus says.
“Sounds like a parlor trick,” Ron shrugs, then he yawns again.
Malfoy flinches.
Draco doesn’t respond. His heart is racing and he’s ashamed of it, so he does the predictable thing.
Malfoy glares down the bridge of his pointed nose. Harry had a problem with spots in third year until Hermione cooked up a concoction, and he wonders briefly if Narcissa Malfoy stocks something similar her son, who has a very clear complexion. Malfoy is, however, pale as a ghost. He is holding Harry to the wall with the bony part of his lower arm. With his other hand he drives the point of his wand into Harry’s stomach.
Harry steps forward and grabs Malfoy’s wrist, the very same side that Snape, that Wormtail, that Lucius… He shoves up the sleeve. He might retch. The ink of Malfoy’s Dark Mark is so black, so clean, it doesn’t look real. He stares, and Malfoy lets him.
“Harry!” Sirius shouts. One of the Noonwraiths is launching at him, great spindly fingers with long, ridged nails in the shape of a claw. Harry cuts her hand off, and all of the other Noonwraiths scream in agony.
“Yeah.”
their uncle, but they call him that, because, well, Harry doesn’t really know why. It’s just something they do. Serendipitously, Sirius was childhood best friends with Harry’s father, and in that way might as well be an uncle to him. He does little to conceal his nepotism
Sirius leans on the bar haughtily, as if they could pull even a single measly crown between either of them for some water or a quarter of a warm bed.
“I’ve been waiting,” a girl cries, catapulting into Malfoy’s arms, “Draco, I’ve been so worried.”
Severus carries the man, half-conscious, teetering on death, up a set of stone steps and into an old warehouse. It will be teaming with shiphands on the morrow, but for now it’s empty and warmer than the unforgiving sea air, at least.
Draco feels his eyes grow wet, the burning beneath his cheeks. So much for a mask.
“Why can’t we go back to Kaer Morhen?” Harry asks Sirius’, who’s on his side, facing away from Harry.
what I’ve just heard,” she says.
Harry thinks he’s crazy, that he’s overreacting, but the medallion buzzes so erratically that it vibrates Harry’s chest cavity, and worse as he closes in. Then, a spell ricochets from some unseen caster, strikes a boy and sends him to the ground. An elder goes charging. It’s not just a fire, it’s an attack. Harry realizes that he knew to draw his sword before he was conscious that there was danger. There would be a small bit of pride for that if Harry had room for it.
“Shut up,” Malfoy bites.
“She does have that effect.”
Ginevra does that laugh, the roaring one, way too loud and melodious for what’s been offered, but Harry isn’t complaining. She’s pretty when she throws her head back like that, cocks her hip to the side so her ass rounds in her silhouette. Harry has never seen a girl naked except in clinical textbooks wherein the are intestines exposed and discussions of rot, autopsy, and other, less than stimulating topics cover the parchment. Women are softer than those drawings, rosier, or at least Ginevra is. She’s freckled down to her feet too, just the same as her cheeks.
Malfoy looks from beneath his furrowed brow. He only lacks the cane and antiquated ponytail before he is the spitting image of Lucius Malfoy. A little humor cracks over his features and then, “Didn’t know you swung that way, Potter, but if you insist,” Malfoy sniggers, making a show of unbuttoning his trousers.
“Leave me alone,” Draco says
Harry nods curtly at her, then at Fred, and pushes up to the bar, mimicking Sirius’ order of a pale. He tosses three coppers down and waits.
Ron yawns twice more, and Hermione looks at him like he has just pledged his life to the Dark Lord. “We’re going to bed,” she tells Harry, and coaxes Ron by his sleeve.
Harry looks at Sirius, who is already tuning in.
“Harry. Harry, Harry. You are so like your parents sometimes.”
“Merlin, will you two shut up?” Malfoy clips, “I’m happy to tell your fathers that you failed me because you couldn’t resist desert. Maybe I’ll tell the Dark Lord myself.”
He is supposed to be thespian in the melodrama of secondary school bullying. He is supposed to be Hogwarts considerably more attractive but equally as cruel Dudley Dursley. He is supposed to hate Harry, to give Harry something to hate. Now Harry just feels bad, like he took the game too far without trying.
Before Harry can deny it, Sirius nods his head, and Silagrim scrubs his stained hands over his eyes. “I’ve some boiled leather jerkins you can pick from, is all.”
Potter takes Draco’s wand hand and pulls it from his stomach. Draco wrenches it away from him.
Malfoy goes cross, a familiar face. “Why?” He urges Harry, “WHY? I tried to use
The road to Lyria is peaceful, and much lighter and more pleasant outside the old, thick gambeson and in the new, sleeveless jerkin, which Harry says a bit of grace for often. Bless Silagrim and his wife and their children, and especially Mida, because Gods, it’s nice not to have swampy armpits.
“What are you hiding, Malfoy?”
Harry casts Axii on the trolls to have them decide to fall asleep instead of pester him about his going-ons, and he and Sirius continue to the cliff side, where a large platform is overlooking the horizon. There are several braziers, each indicating an element: earth, air, wind, and fire. In the center, a medallion is placed, wherein it’s charged with and blessed by nature’s magic. Harry lights all of the fires in order, then delicately lays his medallion in the center and steps away. Sirius is leaning on the stone wall, staring down at the rushes of the river below, lit up orange by the sunset. By the time they are done, it will be well into the dark.
“All of them, the freaks. Jealous, probably, their father being the muggle-lover that he is, their mother such a troll. Draco belongs to one of the greatest wizarding families—“
Draco lunges forward and grabs Potter by the collar, so resenting the way his hands tremble. He pushes the tip of his wand into Potter’s side. “If you so much as think of telling anyone, I’ll give you another scar,” Draco whispers through his teeth.
Harry can’t make his throat work. It’s difficult enough to say, “Night!” before they ascend to stairs to their dormitories. Okay. He can use
Hermione condemns Harry at any sign of interest or concern.
“Need help?” she whispers, low, soft. She walks her fingers like tiny legs across the water as she skirts the tub, walking in tandem, giggling. She is standing behind him when reaches her small hands around and spreads them down Harry’s scalp, past his ears, down his chest. He can feel that her hands are thickly calloused, but they have softened in the water to the point of pruning. Her hair falls in a curtain by his face, and she rests her head on his neck, fingers traveling down beneath the water. ”If you don’t start talking soon, I’ll be afeared you don’t want it,” she whines.
She does not seem to hear him.
“You stumbled off of the dock trying to come off your ship, drunk,” Severus says simply, no strain to keep the solemn composure that is so natural to a witcher. As a boy, he might have grown red-faced for the lie. White Honey is a potent anti-toxin for witchers, but to humans, it’s a sedative so strong, it’s deadly. Someone on the ship distilled a few drops given in a vial into James Potter’s costly wine. “You nearly drowned, and your men were either too in their drink or too moronic to take notice.”
“Patience, Harry, please.”
Potter shoves his hands in his pockets. “Hermione.”
“Can’t wait,” Harry says, hoisting the baskets on top of his head, awkward as they are to carry in front of his stomach. “Could you— Nevermind.”
Harry is thrown backward. His mind is working on a serious delay; it takes him a while to realize the black cloud hovering over Malfoy is Professor Snape. Snape’s wand is weaving out a silver web of magic by a hushed incantation. The blood seeps curiously over Malfoy’s body, reversing time, re-entering his wounds like they never bled. Last, the skins stitches together on its own, the only evidence they’d been there in the clean cuts of his shirt. Malfoy’s breathing slows, steadies, though Harry’s does not.
Could it be any more ridiculous than this? Escorting a Death Eater to the dungeons so he won’t get detention? A gesture of good will?
“She’s at rest, now,” Harry says quietly.
“Because you’re up to something.”
“You’re trying to sneak Death Eaters into the school,” Potter offers. His eyes go searching Draco’s expression.
“That’s the one.”
They are not privy to Harry who is trekking quietly behind them, bashful and invisible. It’s been a long week coming up with a decent ways to distract Crabbe and Goyle so Harry can slip into the Room after Malfoy, unnoticed. Crabbe and Goyle take their position framing the door, their hands crossed firm in front of their stomachs like some kind of muggle bouncers.
He smells like dead fish and Severus’ mouth is fixed into a grimace for being subjected to it for the majority of the night. But under that, somewhere deep in his tunic, or a kiss next to his ear perhaps, he still smells of Lily.
doing here?”
“There’s probably a contract for this one. What did you find?” Sirius asks.
Just in the hallway before the Room of Requirement, Harry loses the sound of Malfoy’s footfalls. He inches up to the corner, not yet willing to peek beyond it, just listening.
“Why? Don’t you want to know too?”
The next set of stairs move abruptly and Malfoy falls ungracefully into Harry, who helps to steady him. Draco collects himself then shoves away.
“I invoke the Law of Surprise,” Severus whispers, “Give me the first thing you see when you walk through the threshold of your home.” He wonders if fate will grant him this, even if he has exploited her so. A cursed and lonely man it may make him, but what else is a witcher already, than cursed, than lonely?
It’s as Harry expected. He is blown back with a start, across the small clearing made by Malfoy, and he lands with his spine square on the leg of an old armchair. He gets up, gripping his back, the pain shooting up and down his legs. It is not the pain of the Cruciatus Curse, but of a mundane physical impact. Malfoy looks stricken by this. “I told you,” Harry mutters.
“Not near friends, Sirius said,” Harry tells him, a little too stern for what he means, but he can’t take it back.
Harry could laugh. He feels it whirring madly in his chest. “Brat,” Harry says.
Draco laid in bed last night staring at the ceiling, the pretty aurora of green moonlight refracting around the stone-block walls of their dorm. And Blaise asked why he was staring like he was Confunded.
Malfoy covers his mouth and howls, holding the bird as far away as he can so as not to startle it. He’s laughing. Harry sneaks up behind him, so close that if Malfoy turned too abruptly they would collide.
Harry says, “What are
“Small cluster of yellow flowers, the flowers carry the potent oil, found in fields.”
Sirius charges at her, turning her attention away from Harry for long enough that he can correct his footing and shake off the incredible despair that she’s bestowed on him. She has beams of sunlight coming out of the holes in her body and she is waving in and out of corporeality, one moment real and the next covered by the veil of the other world. Sirius’ Yrden ward is fading, so Harry casts it again, and the specter becomes fully corporeal once more. She wags her gigantic tongue at him, her eyes dead, white, and angry.
“So I’d better borrow that cloak again, thanks,” Malfoy says. He leans over and scoops the fabric up.
They arrive in the lowest halls of the dungeons which stretch deep below the lake. Harry scarcely remembers which part of this bare stretch of stone has the concealed dormitory entrance. Malfoy feels around in the cloak for the seam. Then he stops, pondering, and looks over his shoulder. Not quite at Harry but not at anything else.
Sirius throws his knife into her chest and she collapses, but does not fade or die, not yet. There has to be something in this area which ties her, and it’s literally a needle in a haystack, a ring buried in the dirt, a groom long since decayed. She lays on the ground, and Sirius tends to a binding circle once more, constantly this time, and instructs Harry to look for her keepsake.
Harry nods, knew Sirius would punish him with silence if he spoke back. The sun sets under the horizon, the sky towards Kaer Morhen a silky indigo, and littered with bright, beautiful stars. The moon is shaped like a thin crescent, waning. In their silence, some commotion is heard, back down the mountain, carrying up the river bed.
“Alright,” Uncle Sirius walks up to the group of naked boys, “Please choose a table, best not near your friends, and grab a knife.”
The blacksmith is well and grateful for the bounty of herbs, and so is his wife. Frye and Becca beg Harry to stay, and he fancies telling them yes, but Sirius has a lead on who may have known the Noonwraith, so they’re off again.
“Stop following me around,” Harry laughs. He can’t help it.
Ron shakes his head. Then he yawns like a lion, so loud that Hermione pauses to glare at him.
Draco mulls over it. “Because she killed Sirius Black?”
They wake before the sun comes up, when the sky is twilight and hazy. Sirius grabs the list of herbs they need, and promises the man he’ll have them within a day. Harry gives him his gratitude, and Frye hugs his legs before he goes, so Harry promises he’ll see them again.
Harry couldn’t possibly stand. So he waits, watching water pour from the severed pipe at the sink, letting the flood soak his jeans.
“I don’t think you could,” Harry spits.
“He visited you after you were taken to Kaer Morhen?”
“Well, it helps me see at night. Like a cat,” Harry tells him, “and I can see farther than you can. I used to wear glasses, but I don’t need them anymore.”
It was this wild, red-headed girl that Severus fell in love with in his youth, certain he would make something better of himself than a nameless orphan so that he could give her a life she deserved, as good or better than she was brought up. One day, a Witcher clad in soot-black arrived to the orphanage to pick out strong boys, and Severus begged to be taken. The Witcher laughed at him, picked on his scrawny, lanky frame and beakish nose. He chased their cart three miles out of the city before they let him get in, heels bloodied and later infected so badly that he couldn’t stand for a month.
” Harry insists. There is no explanation beyond this. The feeling in his stomach tells him so.
“Right,” Harry shoves up, grabs the medallion from it’s place on the altar and puts it around his neck. It becomes a piece of him straight away, another appendage from which to gather senses, and it hums dramatically, especially when Harry faces Kaer Morhen.
“Trying to figure what Malfoy’s doing.”
She’s bare naked, skin wet and steaming from the bath, and she towels off with something she pulls from the bed. “Go on,” she points to the basin, filled with steaming water and flowers, “Rinse up, now.”
Sirius knocks loudly on the wooden door, even though he is inside with them. They all turn to look, and then Neville gives Harry a great shove on the shoulder to egg him on.
Malfoy shakes his head, and Harry can tell he is concealing by the tight lines of his face. “Why?”
. She takes him into her hand and tugs, and he grips her arm and tugs back, then turns around to get a firm grip on her waist and pull her into his lap in the bath. She is wide-eyed, startled, but excited. She laughs, drawing in close to his face and breathing  hot air against his lips, grinding her hips down on his cock. Harry is glad she knows what she’s doing, because he wouldn’t know how to pace it.
over his shoulder, and Harry evades it by a hair. The tiled corner of the wall explodes just behind him.
Sirius recites the list, then asks Harry to tell him where the herbs might be found.
The walk up to the Circle of Elements is beautiful, though it’s usually done alone. Sirius promises the other elders that he will leave Harry at the mouth of the troll caves, as it’s meant to be a part of the trial, but it’s an opportunity for peace that Sirius and Harry do not oft get and sorely need.
“What do you hope to accomplish, Potter? Going to cut me up again?”
Sirius breaks into a run, and they sprint past the sleeping trolls, out of the cave and down the mountain. The keep of Kaer Morhen is on fire, spouting smoke into the sky. Harry unsheathes his Silver Stag, and rushes towards the gate.
Harry curses. Then he rams Malfoy square in the stomach with his shoulder, tackling him forward like an American football player. They crash through the doors of the Room of Requirement.
The sad truth is that Draco’s hatred was a fixture of Harry’s school experience. Perhaps that’s what happens when children are orphaned and then abused the majority of their childhood; they grow comfortable with hatred and feel aberrant when they lack it’s familiar pressure. But Harry doesn’t know, because he doesn’t know who he would ask.
Malfoy’s face does something strange, like he is playacting through a few emotions, confusion, sadness, anger, disgust. “Is this a trick?” He asks.
Draco wouldn’t give it up, not until just fifteen minutes ago. He’s bad at keeping secrets.
“Nothing!” Potter shakes his head. Perhaps there’s misdirected anger here. Perhaps Potter has assumed form. “
“Mida,” is all she says, and she stares at Silagrim when she says it. He flinches horribly, and his shoulders lift up as if he’s covering himself from something he doesn’t want to see. “It’s Mida. You know it is.”
Harry has come to detest the absence of glaring, stalking, or otherwise tormenting. He considers who else has hated him as long or half as hard as Malfoy that he might transfer his unused energy to.
"Right," Regulus agrees, nodding along.
"Um," Harry says, because there's only so long you can stand around silently watching someone, and Harry's definitely passed that by a mile. "Hi."
"Why do you want to know?" Draco asks, his voice teasing. "Not checking up on me are you, Potter?" Draco lifts his glass to his lips, taking a long slow sip, and Harry copies. Harry's not much of a wine drinker and the taste is stronger than he usually goes for, making his mouth feel dry, but it's also full of flavour. "It's a lot of work to get the permits approved. Especially if you're two Slytherins going into business together and wanting to do the spellwork yourself. The shop is mine and Pansy's—" Draco elaborates to Harry at his confusion. "She enjoys sourcing the
Harry’s hand waves between them, and Draco’s stomach drops at the the implication. He’s been trying to avoid thinking about it, with varying degrees of success. He still hasn’t looked at his own mark; it’s not real if he doesn’t look.
, and when he does he can’t help the groan that falls from his lips. He wants to make them redder, swollen and bruised, and Harry doesn’t fight the urge, chases it like he chases Draco’s lips, sealing them with his own.
"If you’re going to just stand there you may as well help." Harry throws a tea towel at Draco, the towel limply hitting Draco on the chest. Draco catches it with one hand, scowling at it as if it’s offended him.
“Now?” Harry asks, a hint of hope in his voice.
Somehow, Draco ends up at the Dungeons. It’s not
"Unless you want to help?" Harry says, trying for humorous. But his voice sounds breathless, and his skin feels tight; he’s not sure it lands right.
now instead of
"I think Teddy is definitely having fun."
Maybe he had known, really, that the house wasn’t safe. He’s not had people 'round since he moved in, and even then he’s only accepted as much help as he's had to. There’s been something in the house that’s given him chills, put him on edge, and it’s been wearing him thin even as he’s been trying to ignore it, to pretend that maybe if he just gets on with it that it might set itself right.
After half a dozen or so pats she turns her back, dodging away from Harry's hand to walk past Draco, knocking her head against his shoulder again before jumping up to a high shelf behind him. She turns around to look back over the shop, lying down so that her long black fluffy paws hang over the edge of the shelf. She starts licking at her fur, and Harry gets the distinct feeling of dismissal.
He does look familiar though. Familiar black hair and sharp cheekbones. There’s even something in his ghost's expression, the look on the ghost's face. Everything looks a bit familiar, but not, like seeing your reflection in a puddle.
Draco moves, bucking up his hips and rolling over, unseating Harry a little unceremoniously, before climbing on top of Harry.
“Is that for potions? Aren’t you getting an O in that?”
Harry thinks there might have been something more to it, now that he looks back on it. There's a reason Harry's been feeling less motivated at his job for the last six months.
"C’mon then." Harry slides his hand into Draco’s, laces their fingers together, squeezing them just because he can. Draco squeezes back, sending a flush of warmth through Harry’s chest. "Let’s go to bed."
Inside, the shop has a crowdedness which could be oppressive but isn't. On the walls are clocks, frames, and mirrors. Some of the frames have artwork, some are empty, and there are a few which seem to have been blocked out, black material hanging in front of images Harry can't see.
Kissing Draco is becoming one his favourite things to do. Draco's mouth opens for him so well, and Harry's always loved kissing. Draco's naked, and Harry takes advantage of it. Harry's cock bumps against Draco's and pushes up between them as their bodies come together. Harry runs his hands over Draco, feeling the soft skin of his body, roaming over Draco's arms and shoulders—feeling that one divet Harry's seen from the collarbone accident that never really healed right, then over his spine, feeling the concave of his back. Harry's hands find the swell of Draco's arse and Draco's body presses closer to him again. The pressure is just too much. Harry's head is spinning, and he breaks the kiss to gasp out.
It's still the shop, Harry realises. He can see furniture, with teapots and cups sitting on a wooden bureau. There are art pieces against the wall, and as far as Harry can see there's no difference between this and the other half of the shop, except when Harry reaches out a hand towards a mirror; gold, being held up by two naked cherubic figures and littered with grapes—and who would even want such a thing—there's something that feels different.
