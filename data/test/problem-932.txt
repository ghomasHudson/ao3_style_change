“It depends really” Draco began slowly “On the bond type that is. Different bonds have different effects. What I understand about the one my ancestors created is this is at its simplest a magical bond, but my father told me about some cases where the bond has been more than that. It…” He picked his words carefully here, “A magical bond allows the magic of the two bonded to join and become one stronger magical core shared by both. And in those rare cases, a stronger bond is formed in which the bonded pair could feel each other’s aura both magical and not.” Draco glanced at Harry who looked very pale now and very confused.
Draco had always been easily bored by the people around him. Slytherins may be cunning but when you’re around them all the time, they become predictable. And it wasn’t like he had friends in other houses, his father wouldn’t have approved of that. And honestly, everyone seemed as dull as the other. Potter had been different though. He sparked an interest in Draco from the moment he refused his hand in first year. No one had stood up to him before.
Harry smirked and leaned in to close the gap, but Draco had other plans and had Harry on his back, pinned to the sofa in seconds. Harry gasped. He bit his lip to hold back a moan at being manhandled so easily.
Draco felt bad. He knew how hard it was for him to come out. He hadn’t told his father and had only told his mother a few months ago, but he told a few of his close friends and that was scary enough.
Fighting down the shame of having acted in such a way, Malfoy lifted his head slowly and spoke “Potter you’re crazy if you think this can work. What are you expecting? Us to suddenly become best friends? Trade secrets? Or Merlin forbid, fall in love? Do you really expect a happy ever after here?” Despite how hard he tried to keep the venom in his voice, he failed. He sounded almost broken and Harry hated it. It reminded him of that time in the bathroom when... Harry shook his head slightly to rid himself of the memory.
“Ah Mr. Potter, good to see you’re awake. Here drink this” She handed Harry a small purple vial that looked and smelled disgusting. “That should get rid of the last few aches you’ll feel. I dealt with your lip and the worst of your bruises with some healing cream. How are you feeling?”
“We’ll figure it out. One step at a time” Harry smiled, and Draco nodded. “Why don’t we start off by getting to know each other better? Maybe go on a date? That’s how it normally works”
“Sometimes I worry about you and Ron, you never see anything. From what I’ve seen, he’s liked you since you started potions together this year” Hermione laughed softly when Harry blushed.
“I want to talk, and I think it’d be better on a full stomach” Harry smiled encouragingly, pulling out a seat for Draco then pulling out his own. “Care to join me?”
Malfoy was laying on his back, eyes open, staring at the ceiling. His chest shook when he exhaled, and his inhale was sharper than it should have been. It was when Malfoy roughly wiped his cheek that Harry realised, he was crying.
So far, Harry and Draco had been lucky in avoiding people, but their luck seemed to have run out. Walking to the hospital wing was awful. Word had obviously spread, and students had grown in confidence. There was a lot staring and pointing, some whispers and giggling. A couple of students even had the guts to say things to them. The worst hit Harry the most.
“Yup. Dumbledore has said we can go out to Hogsmeade this evening. I didn’t tell him exactly why we wanted to go. So, Mr Malfoy, would you like to go on a date with me this evening?” Harry couldn’t help blushing a little at asking to bluntly.
Once back in the confides of their private rooms, Harry placed both their brooms by the door and gently pulled Draco over to one of the sofas. He muttered a spell, so the fire lit and began gently warming the room.
“Alright, I’ll start then” Harry spoke, breaking the silence and catching Draco’s attention. “When this started the bond felt odd. Uncomfortable in a way. Your magic felt almost like an intruder in my magical core. And we both know how strongly the bond messed with our emotions” Harry laughed softly causing Draco to smile and nod.
“It doesn’t matter what the wizarding world cares or thinks. It doesn’t matter what they believe because they aren’t part of this. This is me and you. And now, me and you need to decide what the hell we are going to do” Harry spoke with such confidence that it gave Draco some strength.
“You know, I’ve always hated potions” Draco gave him a ‘no shit’ expression which made Harry chuckle. “Well, um, since we started this year it’s been, sort of, enjoyable”
The halls were empty when they returned so the walk to their rooms was an easy one. Once back, Harry removed his blazer and threw it on his bed when Draco suddenly spoke up.
He gently pushed the boys into the classroom and closed the door behind them with an almost deafening thud.
Malfoy had felt it too. He looked at Harry with wide eyes but before either could speak a word, a light began to shine between the two. A beautiful, bright red band suddenly burst from Harry’s chest. The light was a deep red, flowing like water but shining like the sun. Smoothing its way down Harry’s side, it wrapped itself around his waist twice before reaching for the ball of light still sitting between the boys. Now connecting to this ball of light was another band. However, this one was blue. Sharper and stronger, like ice under the glare of a melting sun firmly encasing Malfoy’s waist and shining so brightly from his chest that Harry was forced to look away.
Draco chuckled, “Yes it was” and Harry blushed. Draco traced his finger along Harry’s bottom lip slowly, “It’s nice to know you aren’t completely unaffected by me” he teased.
“And the rare cases?” Harry tried to keep his voice steady but the idea of his magic becoming theirs didn’t comfort him. Magic had been the one constant in his life.
“Draco” Harry whispered; he was close to begging, but he didn’t have to. Draco finally closed the distance between them and kissed Harry firmly this time. His lips began gliding smoothly against Harry’s and his hands travelled their way up into Harry’s thick, dark locks.
“Nonsense” Draco entered the bathroom to retrieve them. He brought them back and slid them onto his face. “I like your glasses”
Draco felt several emotions from anger, to exasperation. and suddenly laughed. “You had me worried all this time over that?!” He giggled and couldn’t stop.
Harry looked up immediately. Was Draco crying? Shit, Harry didn’t mean to upset him. He only wanted to make a point. “Draco I’m-“
Draco was nervous. Talking was not a strong point of his. Neither was opening up to people. And yet he knew that he had to. It was necessary. So, despite his instinct to pull on his protective armour or run from the situation, he kept hold of Harry’s hand and tried to think through how to say what he needed to.
“So that’s how you managed to get around without being caught all these years” Draco stated when they were walking down the path that lead to Hogsmeade. “I always did wonder”
Harry was struggling but had thoroughly underestimated Draco’s strength, he couldn’t move no matter how hard he tried. Malfoy lifted his arm, aiming his fifth punch to Harry’s already bloody and bruised face when something happened.
It took a couple of minutes before Malfoys breathing evened out and Harry moved to sit next to him. He ran his hands through his unruly hair and took a deep himself. “I know that this is… I don’t even know what word to use but I know. But it’ll be fine because it has to be. We’ll figure something out. Even if it takes us a while, we will because we’re survivors and we’ve been through worse” Harry tried to sound confident but they both knew he was trying to convince Draco as much as he was trying to convince himself.
Draco rolled his eyes, “What does that old fool want now?” he muttered to himself. He stood, collecting his robe from the sofa.
Harry looked slightly confused. “Of course, I meant it. I don’t say things like that just for the fun of it”
Harry was immediately cut off by Draco’s lips on his own. They were rough and demanding yet sweet and soft and edging on desperate. He kissed Harry as if it were the last thing he would ever do, firmly holding Harry's face. Harry stood frozen for a moment, but only a moment before he responded. He wrapped his arms tightly around Draco’s waist and pulled him closer, kissing Draco with equal enthusiasm while Draco began winding his fingers through Harry’s thick locks.
Draco’s jaw dropped when he saw it and he smirked. “Well, well, firewhisky Mr. Potter? Not very saintly of you” He teased, taking the bottle from Harry.
Harry suddenly went very red and it wasn’t due to the heat from the fire. “Oh,” he said stupidly. That was the very last thing he expected Malfoy to say. “D-do we have to?”
The snitch suddenly dropped down with speed and Harry descended, letting gravity do most of the work as he dove. Draco, who had been following until the snitch fell, watched with horror as Harry dropped at a speed that was becoming increasingly dangerous the closer he got to the ground.
“Malfoy, I know you don’t like me, but I think it would be best if we tried to get along. Don’t you?” Hermione tried, using that calm, reasonable voice she used when Ron was in a temper.
Draco laughed. “No. Sadly this isn’t the time for you to pour your heart out about your undying love for me” Harry grinned, rolling his eyes. “But yes, I do know how to perform the ritual. It used to be a rather big thing in my family so my father had me memorise it”
“It means, Mr. Malfoy, that your bond isn’t as strong as it should be so we must take extra care to strengthen it. You two must complete the bond on your own of course but we won’t discuss that now”
The little owl had stayed, waiting for Harry to return with the letter and flew off quickly with an affection nip once she had it.
They waited a few minutes, not wanting to walk down the packed hallways when classes were due to start soon. When they left, they took a shortcut through the second floor to avoid as many people as possible.
Harry stepped forward, “And you didn’t want to tell me now either. Because you were scared I hated you? Because you feared I’d reject you?”
When their tongues touched, it was Draco who moaned. He was feeling everything Harry felt and more, he could feel Harry's lust and excitement along with his own. He was incredibly turned on and the kiss was growing in passion with every passing second. Draco wanted more of Harry, he wanted to hear more, taste more. He wanted to play with Harry, to tease Harry.
“No, fuck you” Malfoy pushed Harry down by his shoulders and kneed him in the stomach hard. With the wind knocked out of Potter, Draco tackled him to the ground and pinned Harry’s hands under his knees. “Fuck” Malfoy landed a third punch Harry’s face, splitting his lip. “You” Then a fourth to his cheekbone, breaking his glasses.
With a satisfied grin, Harry leaned back in his seat and rested his hands behind his head. “What brought this on?” he found himself asking.
Draco didn’t respond. Instead, he began to search for his class notes that he needed for today. It was Monday and the start of the week that both Harry and Draco would be missing classes. Draco refused to fall behind just because of the bond.
Now, they were on the pitch together and Draco felt so many things, he didn’t know what to settle on. But when a hand suddenly snaked into his and squeezed, Draco settled on happy. Decided to enjoy the moment, even if it only happened once.
Harry knew he should have ignored it and gone back to sleep; he knew that that was what Malfoy would have wanted. But he couldn’t. Looking at the way Malfoy tried so hard to hold back what looked like sobs made Harry speak.
“This should help chase away any last aches and will help you both sleep” Pomfrey handed both boys a different vial which they drank silently. “Get some rest”
Malfoy was closely inspecting Harry’s cut. “You may want to see Pomfrey about this, it’s a rather nasty cut, pretty deep-“
“He’s just getting dressed,” he said just as Harry walked out of the bedroom, in a pair of what seemed to be loose muggle jeans and a tight fitted top, and flashed Malfoy a small smile. Draco narrowed his eyes and turned back to Pomfrey.
Harry glanced at Malfoy and saw his cheeks were tinted pink and his neck was flushed but Harry couldn’t understand why. Complete the bond? He was about to ask when Dumbledore continued, “For now we must talk about what this all means for the two of you. We have set up a private room- “
“I guess after the war was over, I did, yeah. I wanted my happily ever after. But life isn’t that nice. Mine especially. But this is the hand we’ve been dealt and now we have two options. We spend the rest of our life hating each other, arguing, and most likely feeling like crap forever with an unstable bond. Or we could try and work this out. Try to get along. Try to have the most normal life we can like this” Harry sounded more confident this time.
It took Harry a second to realise Draco had even spoke, he was so caught up in the way Draco was looking at him. “Um, what?”
The walk back was more uncomfortable than the walk to the potions room. Harry was a ball of nervous energy after Draco’s kiss. Adrenaline was pumping through him still and he had to keep telling himself to relax but he couldn't. How could he? Draco bloody Malfoy had kissed him. He couldn’t even believe it, that had to be the best kiss he had ever received by far. And it was from Draco. Merlin, could that guy kiss.
Harry awoke rather suddenly the next morning. He had been out like a light the moment his head hit the pillow and now, he was full of energy. The sort of feeling when you wake up to go on holiday or to the first day of summer holiday, not that Harry would have understood these.
“The article was released this morning. I think it would be best if you two didn’t read it. You mustn’t worry yourselves over that nonsense. However, since then you have both had one too many letters sent which I have intercepted. I do not believe it would be any good letting you read those either so I would like a list of people you would like to allow to send you letters Mr. Malfoy” Dumbledore spoke with such an air of calm that did nothing to settle either boy. “Harry created one of these a while back and I would like to do the same for you to protect you both”
“Yes, we would have had time to adjust to the situation more but if we do this today, if we just get it over with then all the annoying side effects that are already beginning will go away” Harry tried to sound like he understood what he was talking about, but in all honesty, he still wasn’t one hundred percent sure what would happen if they left it too long.
Draco had to bite his tongue hard to keep what he wanted to say from passing his lips. Instead, he opted with a simple “Fine” and the tense atmosphere returned.
Without a word, Malfoy took a seat and began helping himself to the roast beef and potatoes in front of him. Harry took this as a very good sign and started eating too. Malfoy was out of the bedroom and now eating with Harry. The easy bit was done, now for the hard part.
Harry took a moment to assess himself. “I feel fine now. I can still feel the buzz, but it is gentle and if I concentrate, I can feel your emotions. Other than that, I feel almost normal”
“You mean as in a career?” Harry nodded in response. “I’ve been thinking about doing medicine. I really enjoy potions, as you know and I’m pretty good”
Soft light filled the main room from the closed window by the bookshelf and Harry’s heart jumped into his throat, remembering where he was. That’s when he noticed the damp spot on the back of his neck due to a very hot, shallow breath behind him and something hard pushing into his lower back.
“Harry” Hermione was suddenly serious. “Of course, I’m alright with it. And so is Ron and anyone else who cares about you. All that matters to us is that you’re happy”
“No. You’re going to tell me what you were going to say” Harry pulled Draco towards to sofa but Draco held his ground.
“If you think, for one second, that you can moan and grind against me like that and walk away you are sorely mistaken” Draco’s voice was low and Harry couldn’t tell if it was due to just waking up or how turned on he was but it sent a shiver through Harry.
“What’s wrong?” Harry began walking towards Draco who backed up, fear rising in his throat. “I’ll tell you what’s wrong, Malfoy” Harry tried not to growl the words, but he was pissed off. He knew it was unreasonable to be angry at Malfoy. He knew the problem was really the bond. But he didn’t care.
“I’m not lying” Draco defended himself, “Pansy and I put on a front, we never dated” He smirked at Harry’s surprised face. “So” he continued “Never have I ever kissed a Weasley”
“Well, what is it doing to you?” Harry turned his body, so he was facing Draco and tucked one knee under himself.
When they had made it through the crowds and to the hospital wing, Harry took a deep shuddering breath.
“Draco… are you jealous?” Harry asked quietly, a little worried about the reaction he would receive.
Two hours later, Draco found Harry in the same place he left him, sat staring into the fire. This sulking was beginning to get on his nerves. When Dumbledore left Harry sunk to the floor and Draco disappeared into the bathroom, locking himself in and allowing the tears to flow. Draco had tried his hardest to keep his head down and stay out of trouble this year. He was supposed to fly through the eighth year with no more troubles than he started with and move out of London with his mother and now that was all out the window. He was now going to have to spend the rest of his life… He couldn’t bear to even think it.
“Fighting the bond isn’t trying Draco. You said you wanted something but how is that ever meant to happen if you’re acting like the prat you used to be and fighting this every step of the way?”
Draco collected his books, his parchment, and ink in a very uncoordinated fashion and turned to Harry. “I don’t know what I would be awkward about. Nothing happened. We played a game, had a drink, and went to bed. End of” he stated and left the bedroom for the main room.
“But you haven’t been” Harry pointed out. “You’re not hurt. I’m not rejecting you. I told you, I want this too. You just need to start believing me”
To give Harry credit, he was trying. Really, he was. But the bond was making it hard to concentrate. It was buzzing happily beneath his skin and every time he managed to concentrate on something, his attention was drawn right back to Draco. Harry even moved to the other sofa, pretending he needed more space to spread out his notes, hoping a bit of distance would help him focus. If anything, moving made it worse.
“My name is Harry and you can have this back when you learn how to say it” Harry smirked, quickly jumping back when Draco tried lunging for the book.
“It was after that when it started acting up but I’m not sure why. I couldn’t concentrate on anything. I kept rereading the same line over and over again. I kept losing track of what I was doing. I-I couldn’t get you out of my head” Harry ran a self-conscious hand through his already messy hair. “I thought going to the pitch would help but it made things worse. It felt like the bond was trying to pull me back to you. I was trying to focus on finding the snitch, but the bond wanted me to focus on where you were. It was getting on my nerves. And then you seemed so calm and in control, like you weren’t feeling anything I was… I got angry”
“Hey” Harry moved and crouched in front of Draco. “It’s fine. We don’t have to, but I thought it would be nice. Neither of us have been on the pitch in a long time. If you’re worried about being seen, no one is out. Trust me, it’ll be fine”
They climbed out the other side a corridor away from their rooms and the halls were thankfully empty. “We’ll have to use that again” Harry smiled.
“You know you don’t have to be so polite to them, it’s their job” Malfoy informed Harry whilst moving to sit on the sofa behind him.
Malfoy blanked for a moment, making Harry repeat himself a little louder this time. “I-“ Thinking back, Malfoy tried to remember the lessons his father forced him through when Draco was young, teaching him of Malfoy traditions old and new. “There isn’t,” said Draco.
“Okay, easy Malfoy” Harry was in a bit of state when Pomfrey left but it was nothing compared to Malfoy. He was starting to hyperventilate and when his knees gave way, Harry only just caught him. “Come on” Harry tried to sound calm, easing Malfoy onto the floor with his back against the sofa and his head between his knees. “Breathe Malfoy. Slowly now, okay? In and out” Harry just kept talking, hoping he’d be able to calm Malfoy down. It felt weird trying to comfort him, but Harry knew he couldn’t just leave Malfoy to pass out or potentially do something stupid.
Draco sat back, content in the peaceful atmosphere they had created. But it wasn’t long before the bond began fizzing and bubbling again, making Draco far too uncomfortable yet again.
“What would you like to know?” Draco tried to sound calm, but he was worried about what Potter would ask him.
Malfoy wanted to say no but he was starving and Potter wanted to talk. His curiosity got the better of his stubbornness. He wanted to know what Potter had to say.
“I’m sorry but bonds cannot be broken unless one of the pair dies,” Pomfrey told Harry sympathetically. “And it means I must speak to Professor Dumbledore to see if there is any way to speed up this part of the bonding to make you both feel more comfortable. A bond this weak won’t be pleasant for very long” She took a moment to think and waved her wand, removing the spell that revealed their magical auras. “I’m going to have to ask both of you to use as little magic as possible for the time being. Using it when your core is so unstable could be dangerous. And you two need to make more of a conscious effort to get along now. Arguing or even ignoring each other will only make matters worse. Have a house-elf summon me if you need to. I will be back in a day or two for another examination” Harry gave her a short nod and with that, she left.
“What you said last night when we got back. Did you mean it?” Draco repeated while his heart thudded loudly against his chest.
Harry did a quick self-assessment, mentally going through to see if he felt any aches or anything different. He had to learn how to do this pretty quickly whilst on the run. Not like he had a lot of time to stop and make sure he was in one piece every time something happened. Going from his toes to his head, he felt fine.
Draco pretended to consider it for a few moments, enjoying the way Harry squirmed the longer he waited. “Yes. I think a dinner out would be lovely” He smiled and yelped when he was attacked by a soft pair of lips.
“The bond you two share is extremely weak, and it wants to be strong. Therefore, it is acting on its own to heighten your emotions. In a regular bonded pair, this would bring the two closer but what with this being you two…” Dumbledore shook his head sadly “The bond is pushing your emotions to the extreme which is why I’m guessing you have both been much more frustrated with the other and most likely the main reason this fight even occurred. I think I’d be correct in assuming it was over something rather silly looking back.”
Harry bucked his hips as best he could, squirming. “Draco” Harry tried again and this time, Draco listened.
Harry didn’t know what to think about this piece of information and neither did Draco. They both stood looking slightly confused before Dumbledore took pity and continued to speak.
Warm lips burned a fiery path down Harry’s throat, nipping at sensitive skin. Harry tipped his head back, giving Draco more access and couldn’t hold back the whimper that escaped his lips when Draco’s teeth sunk into the skin where his neck met his shoulder and began sucking in a deep bruise.
Now, Malfoy was still a prat, but Harry had to give it to him, he was better than what he was. Not every comment Harry made was rewarded with a sly remark or sneer and that was something. Harry started to noticed things again that he’d been trying to ignore since they’d been partnered at the start of eighth year. Malfoy had grown over the summer in many ways. His eyes were softer, brighter. His pointed features had smoothed making his face much more pleasant. His hair had grown slightly too. He had stopped slicking it back against his head and now instead would comb it to frame his face. Now and then a few loose strands would fall into his face and Harry had this sudden urge to brush them away. It would frustrate him to no end. Malfoy was taller now too, he had maybe an inch on Harry but still managed to move with such elegance. But what Harry enjoyed seeing most would be these rare moments when Malfoy would finish a particularly hard potion, watching the last ingredient drop into the cauldron and seeing his face light in fascination. It was one of the rare moments Malfoy seemed like everyone else, seemed almost happy. Harry knew Malfoy would deny it if Harry ever mentioned it though.
“Yes, but you said so like it made no difference what my response would be. I want this” Harry drew a circle in the air around Draco “mask you hide behind gone. We can’t do this if you’re not in one hundred percent Malfoy”
“What’s got you all keyed up? It couldn’t possibly be… me, could it? My, my” Draco tutted with a small shake of his head, “You should pay more attention-“
They summoned a house-elf and ate lunch in comfortable silence, only broken by the sounds of cutlery on their plates.
Once he had calmed down, he left the bathroom and searched for a quill, ink, and some parchment to write to his mother. Draco knew she had most likely been already told but he knew she would want to hear it from him. So, he wrote. And wrote. He wrote until his wrist began to hurt. Once he started, he couldn’t stop. He ranted and raved about how unfair life was, how he couldn’t believe his bad luck, how out of all the people it just had to have been Saint Potter. But in the end, he felt clearer. Felt calmer. He ripped up the letter, not wanting his mother to worry and wrote another. This one was shorter and when he read it back to himself, he sounded almost confident, letting his mother know not to worry and that he would try to keep her updated.
“I was going to check up on your bond, make sure you are both progressing. From the looks of things, I’d say you are getting closer” She commented causing Harry to blush, but he didn’t move from Draco’s side. Instead, he summoned a chair and sat down.
“You should” He sat down next to Draco, taking his book from him. “You should treat it as a holiday. At least a little. I don’t want to fall behind either but come on, at least relax a little”
Draco was careful with his moves, waiting for Harry to stop him if he went too far. But instead, Harry began grinding back drawing a groan from Draco that sent another strong shiver through Harry.
It was Malfoy’s turn to interrupt now. “What do you mean the bonding hasn’t gone the way it should?” He asked sharply, speaking for the first time since entering the room.
Harry refused to believe it. He still didn’t fully understand what had happened. He was in potions trying to brew a potion of devotion, which he still found to be a ridiculous name, with Malfoy. Slughorn had decided to partner them up at the start of the year and it hadn’t been nearly as horrid as Harry had expected. There had been the odd squabble between the two and one almost explosive argument over who was right about the ingredients needed for Amortentia. But other than that, working with Malfoy had almost been pleasant.
It took a few minutes for either of them to move but eventually, Harry turned around and walked over to Draco. “You okay?”
“A what?!” Harry almost jumped out of his seat while Malfoy paled, almost resembling Professor Binns.
Harry felt optimistic. His good mood still hadn’t left him, and he couldn’t lie that he’d enjoyed working with Draco all morning. Draco was a good teacher. He had tested Harry on topics and happily read over his notes, helping correct mistakes or, surprisingly, praise Harry for good work. And Harry didn’t mind it one bit. He offered to read Draco’s work too but after he read the first piece, he realised that Draco didn’t need anyone to check his writing. His work was beautifully written, and Harry realised just how intelligent Draco was.
Dumbledore lent down to his bottom desk drawer and began to look for something. In that moment, Harry gently slipped his hand into Draco’s, squeezing it gently and giving Draco a small smile of reassurance. And in that moment, Draco felt a million times better, a million times steadier. Harry let go immediately when Dumbledore sat back up with a piece of parchment which he quickly made a note on, but not before Harry felt an answering, barely-there pressure on his hand.
But Draco stayed by the door, glaring daggers into Hermione who was still holding onto one of Harry’s hands.
“Of course. You see, many generations ago there was a ritual that the Malfoy family would perform in which they would bond to their partners. They would brew a potion of devotion until close to completion but instead of adding the final few ingredients they would pour the blood of the
The two worked amicably for a few hours, neither one mentioning earlier or the night before and keeping a safe distance between each other. Though this didn’t stop the odd lingering gaze and the shy smiles from Harry when he was caught or the light blush when Draco was.
Eventually, Harry came to and found himself blinking at the unmistakable ceiling of the hospital wing. Harry noticed with relief that the burning sensation was completely gone but every single muscle in his body ached as if he’d gone ten rounds with a hippogriff.
“No, I didn’t mean it like that” he said quickly. “You’re obviously not big either. You’re, um, good” Draco blushed heavily.
“She was right” Draco said softly, “We do need to get along. At least be civil. For… for you” he blushed, and Harry’s heart skipped at his words.
“Ah and there it is” Harry shook his head looking disappointed but not surprised. He slipped back onto the floor and got back to organising Hermione’s notes.
Draco’s eyes locked onto Harry’s. He saw everything he needed and more. Draco leaned forward slowly, eyes dropping to Harry’s lips before he captured them carefully with his own. The kiss was soft, the gentle push of lips against lips. Draco was testing the waters.
Harry laughed softly. “Well yeah. That’s what happens. You go on a date, get to know the person and decide if there is an attraction there. Decide if you want to go out again”
Classes were smaller than usual, but Harry liked it that way. He put his head down and really tried to copy Hermione with her study habits. He managed for a while until Ron convinced him back onto the pitch. They started playing simple games out on the field together until it got competitive. It distracted them. Gave them time to let go and so Hermione didn’t bother scolding them about missing study sessions when she saw their wind blow hair. She knew that flying lifted their spirits like nothing else could.
Harry smiled and cocked his head slightly, analysing Draco “I’d like that but only if you’re really willing to try”
Draco’s blood ran cold. He knew it would happen but not so soon. Possible crazy headlines began to flood his mind again and he had to clench his fists to stop his hands from trembling.
Harry looked up with nothing but honesty shining in his eyes, “I cared.” It was barely a whisper, but Draco heard and felt his breath catch in his throat. The sincerity on Potter’s face was almost too much for Draco to handle, he didn’t know what to say. Luckily, Potter spoke again but this time his cheeks seemed dusted with colour.
“So, this is your plan then? Sit here until you crisp like bacon?” Malfoy sneered “We need to…” He faltered. What did they need to do? Talk? He almost scoffed at the idea. Draco had stormed in here with no plan of action, he just felt he had to do… something. He sighed and tried to think logically again, tried clearing his head like he had when he was in the bedroom.
“Well if that’s all it is. You two do look a little off but I suspect that is due to the bonding ritual. Come, I will walk you back to your rooms”
“Potter” Draco nodded, cringing at his response choice, his voice echoing in his head. Images that he had struggled to get rid of from last night were suddenly back full force.
Draco knew Potter was there, stood watching him, assessing him. But he couldn’t bare looking up. The onslaught of emotions was too strong, and he knew Potter could feel it. Harry was going to ask what was wrong and Draco knew he had to say something to explain how he felt. Yet, despite having spent the past two hours planning and re-planning what he was going to say, the words didn’t feel right anymore. They didn’t mean enough, or maybe they meant too much. Draco felt cornered but after what Potter had said last night, he needed to do something.
Draco was struggling to think. Every step closer to the classroom felt like he was sealing his future. Which he knew was a silly thought since he was going to be bonded to Potter whether they did this now or not. But he also knew what it meant to do this. He knew what would happen to them over the coming weeks and Draco didn’t know if he was ready.
Since Draco was six years old, he loved flying. His father taught him how to ride a broom and they would play games on the grounds of the mansion most weekends if the weather were nice. It was one of the few good memories Draco had of his father.
Draco was struggling too. More so than Harry. Any time that thought entered his head it was immediately attacked with strong denial and shoved into the farthest corner of Draco’s mind. It was just the bond making him want Potter, nothing else. Not the sparkle in Harry’s eyes or the fullness of Harry’s bottom lip. No.
“That comment made by an ignorant child this morning made me angry. I care about you Draco. More than I care to admit and more than you’d believe. I wanted to shout in your defence and hex every idiot there. And again, I didn’t mean to worry you about what Pomfrey said. I don’t like her prying. I know she needs to know to make sure everything is going smoothly but it annoyed me. What happens between us is ours. And Hermione is a friend, an incredible friend but just a friend. No more, no less”
Harry sighed, gently running his fingers through Draco’s hair. “What did you need to see us for Madam?” Harry asked when she returned with a blue vile.
“Um, back in our rooms. On my bed, I think” Harry hadn’t needed it much lately and had completely forgot to bring it with him.
Draco stood and gracefully stepped over the table between them, never breaking eye contact with Harry. He placed a knee on the left side of Harry’s thighs, then the other on his right side, straddling Harry’s lap.
Draco smiled to himself. He could definitely get used to the power of ruffling Potter up like that. He took a seat and looked over to find Harry where he left him. “Well, are you going to stand there all day or are you going to join me and get some work done?”
"Potter?" Draco asked uncertainly, watching Harry storm off in the direction of the castle. “What’s wrong?” Draco could feel the anger radiating from Potter and walked carefully behind him.
Harry scowled. This was ridiculous. He couldn’t even do something he was good at because all he could think about was dragging Draco back to the ground and snogging him within an inch of his life.
In that moment, Draco changed his mind. “It doesn’t matter. I don’t know.” He stood up and walked to the dining table. The house elves left out a jug of water and a few glasses, so Draco poured himself a glass.
Harry had a plan. It had many holes, but it was something. The first part was getting Draco out of the bedroom.
“Good afternoon more like Mr. Potter.” Pomfrey shook her head and continued, “I just wanted to check up on the two of you and see how the bond is fairing compared to yesterday. Anything new to report?” She asked as she pulled her wand from her sleeve and began what seemed to be a very intricate spell.
He took a breath, gently took Draco’s chin and looked him in the eyes. “There is something between us and I don’t want you to lie to yourself and say there isn’t. We can take things snail slow if you need to" he ran his thumb over Draco's lower lip absent-mindedly, "but at least try to let your guard down now and then. And, please. Don’t lie to me about how you feel” Harry smiled softly and squeezed Draco’s hand. “I’ll let you think about it”
Harry couldn’t understand why it upset him to see Malfoy like this. Thinking about it, Harry couldn’t understand a lot of his feelings. He couldn’t understand why he felt guilty when he saw Malfoy’s bruise when he had done so much worse to Harry. Or why Harry felt such a desperate need to help when Malfoy panicked yesterday. Or why Harry felt so honoured to see Malfoy laugh. Or even why Harry was excited for every single potions lesson since that first at the start of eighth year. But he did feel this way and seeing that single tear roll down Malfoy’s cheek broke his heart in a way Harry didn’t know it could.
“She was just worried, said she would try to do some research on bonds for us to help” Harry sat on the edge of the sofa, attempting to smooth his hair out of his eyes.
This, of course, didn’t help Harry’s predicament. He tried not to linger on the thought too long when it entered his head, but he was slowly starting to accept the truth in it. He liked Draco. A lot. Harry had always noticed Draco throughout the years but now, he knew it wasn’t solely because Harry had been suspicious of him. And now living with Draco had only amplified these feelings of attraction. Sure, it was the bond too, but Harry couldn’t say the bond was forcing him to feel this way. It just wasn’t true. Those feelings had always been there. Lingering in the back of his mind.
Harry couldn’t believe it. Couldn’t begin to understand how this gorgeous thing cared about him so much. Wanted him so much. Draco may not have said it but Harry could feel it loud and clear through the bond. Draco was embarrassed about his jealousy and ashamed that he had even told Harry these things, that was obvious. But when Harry concentrated, he could feel Draco’s attraction for him, his want and need, his care and… love? Harry couldn’t be sure. But the thought swept through him and gave him a confidence he wasn’t aware he possessed.
“I wanted to apologise for just walking in. This is as much your place as it is Harry’s and I didn’t think. I’m sorry” Draco rolled his eyes. “Okay, well I’ll see you soon Harry” Hermione hugged Harry goodbye and Harry felt something flash through the bond, a strong emotion, but he wasn’t sure what.
And when he looked up at Harry, an onslaught of emotions attacked him. Relief, joy, excitement, lust. It consumed Draco and he let it and when he saw Harry’s eyes widen, he knew Harry felt it too. Harry could feel the emotions rolling off of Draco and hitting him like a strong wave. He couldn’t think straight. Harry didn’t know how he knew that these were Draco’s feelings and not his own. But he did.
“Come in boys, come in” Dumbledore called when Harry knocked on the office door. “Lemon drop?” He offered. Both boys politely refused.
Harry felt fear and wonder course through him, and Draco suddenly took his hand and they looked at each other once again.
Harry and Draco split the bill before Draco threw on the invisibility cloak once more and Harry cast his glamour. Harry thanked Madam Rosmerta and walked quickly out of Hogsmeade so Draco could remove the cloak.
They approach the bubbling pot together. Harry saw the scalpel placed beside the cauldron as he stopped just before the table and turned to Draco.
Harry looked far away for a moment and then turned back to Draco. “I have a question for you. Why did Hermione bother you so much?”
“The bond is acting up” Draco sighed, sitting up and looking down at Harry who was slouched with his feet up on the table.
“I do want something with you Draco. Whether that be friendship” Harry could feel the attack of sudden disappointment and quickly put his hand over one of Draco’s. “Or whether that be a relationship. I want what you’ll let me have.”
Harry tried to suppress his smile, “Draco it was awful!” he insisted. “She started giving me advice!”
They shared a smile and Harry glanced away, nervously rubbing the back of his neck. “So…” he said with no actual idea on where he was going.
Harry gasped quietly, his eyes fluttering as he pressed his lips to Draco's. It was a soft but firm kiss, just lips on lips. Draco broke away first, his thumb running over Harry's bottom lip once more. He then smiled softly.
Draco’s hand slipped under Harry’s top, teasing the skin at the top of his pelvis and began nibbling Harry’s ear. He was rewarded with a broken whimper. Harry didn’t know if he could take this. The dream was intense, but the real thing was even better.
“Harry” He muttered, gently ranking his fingers through Harry’s hair. “Harry” he repeated, carefully tugging up Harry’s head when Draco realised, he hadn’t heard him.
He gently pressed his forehead against Harry’s and closed his eyes, breathing him in before casually asking, “Yes?”
With that Harry released the snitch and mounted his broom. He was gone before Draco could even release the breath he’d been holding.
Draco shook his head as if the thoughts would just tumble out of his ears if he tried hard enough, which didn’t escape Harry’s notice.
Even with the bond telling him the opposite, the crippling doubt that Draco would never be enough was back. Apparently not even time with Potter could get rid of it.
“W-we should, um, I mean I’m going to… I think we should get some sleep” Draco stuttered without looking at Harry. He stood up “I, um, goodnight,” Draco said and disappeared into the bedroom.
“Here I stand, and I do so bind myself to you. Here I stand, and I place myself in your hands. I give myself to you freely. I bind myself to you.”
“What did Madam Pomfrey say?” Draco tried for what felt like the one hundredth time. Before Harry could response with ‘Nothing’ again, Draco spoke. “Potter just tell me. You’ve worried me”
Draco was wearing a pair of black pants that hugged him perfectly in all the right places, a white button up shirt with the top two buttons undone and a black blazer. Harry had never seen Draco in something so casual yet so formal and so… muggle. But what shocked Harry most was Draco’s hair. Instead of his perfectly parted and combed hair, it was loose and free, ruffled in front of his face, brushing the tops of his eyes. It screamed to be touched.
Harry turned back to the fire. He was starting to think he’d stay here all night. Hell, he might as well. He was still trying to process what Dumbledore had told him. The fact was he was now bonded to Draco Malfoy, a boy he had hated for years, a boy he had argued with and fought many times, a boy who he could never seem to get out of his head no matter how hard he tried. He was bonded to said boy and there was nothing they could do to undo the magic. This brought him on to the next fact, he was going to have to spend the rest of his life with Draco Malfoy. Harry had spent several years trying to escape a life tied to one man just to be tied to another only months later. He knew it wasn’t fair to compare Malfoy to Voldemort, but he couldn’t help feeling immensely sorry for himself at the moment. He also understood that at some point he and Malfoy would have to figure out how this would work. They couldn’t spend their life hating each other or constantly at the other’s throat. At least Harry knew he couldn’t. He was done with fighting.
The year had started so promisingly. Not many seventh-year students had returned to Hogwarts after the war, but a few had. Hermione managed to convince Ron that completing his final year would be good for him and Harry decided to join them. A few of Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs also returned and, to the shock of all, Malfoy had returned to complete his final year of Hogwarts. Despite having had his name cleared in the trails that followed the war, not many were quick to forgive.
They stayed like that for a while, resting their heads against one another’s, enjoying the closeness, and letting the bond settle again. Draco moved first, slowly easing his knee back, relaxing his grip on Harry’s waist and slowly stepping back.
Casting a quick Tempus, Harry saw the time and sighed. “We should probably head back soon. If we’re late back, we might not be allowed out again”
Draco coughed, sitting up a little and playing with the glass in his hands. “Blaise” He spoke with fake ease.
These were the reasons why they had spent the past few hours in their rooms trying to avoid each other. Harry had had a ridiculously long shower in which he got extremely bored, but he stayed until his fingers pruned. And it was why Malfoy did the same and had managed to drag out drying and brushing his hair for another hour. And yet, despite trying to stay out of each other’s way, it was as if the bond was trying to pull them back together. Whenever Malfoy would leave the bedroom, Harry would be entering which always resulted in a very awkward little dance, lots of blushing, and mumbled apologies.
The snitch, having got annoyed at being ignored, flew right above Draco's shoulder and off to the left and Harry was gone. His heart was beating loudly, his hands were clammy, and he was unbelievably frustrated. Draco’s taunting was driving him insane. How was he so calm?
“What? No, no. We’re not together. I think. We went on a date and sure, we’ve kissed. But nothing’s official” Harry chuckled, feeling as if a weight had been lifted. She was happy for him. “And what do you mean ‘obviously’?”
“Oh great" Harry laughed sourly. "So, while I’m suffering through it, you’re ignoring it. Fantastic. Nice to see you trying Draco” Harry turned to walk away but Draco quickly blocked his path.
“What you said about there being something” he gestured between the two of them and forced out the words, “between us, I-I think you’re right.” He swallowed hard; Harry found it almost painful to watch Draco stumble across his words when he was always so sure of himself. “And I think I would be OK, only if you wanted to, if we maybe, I don’t know. Acted on that” Draco emphasised the last word, trying to make it clear what he wanted without saying it and without looking at Harry. Instead, Draco seemed to find that his hands were suddenly of great interest.
“Why?” Harry asked with a mouth full of pastry from a croissant. He walked over to Draco leaning over to see he was flipping through an old potions book.
“No” Draco answered too quickly in a voice slightly too high. He coughed, “It went fine, just took a little longer than we thought. We’re very tired” He lied smoothly and Pomfrey seemed happy with his response.
“What?” Draco put a hand to his neck and then ran to the bedroom. Harry followed with a small smirk on his face. “Potter!” Draco exclaimed, standing in front of the mirror and poking at two red spots on his neck which were already turning slightly purple.
Even with the potion, Draco worried why she wanted to speak to Harry and not him. Draco let himself enjoy the calm the potion was giving him before slowly climbing to his feet. He knew he was overreacting; Harry wouldn’t be trying so much if he didn’t care. But Draco couldn't help questioning, wondering, worrying.
This was crazy. It couldn’t be true. He couldn’t be... No, this had to be some sort of sick joke. Yet no one was laughing. Harry looked at Dumbledore, the hope in his eyes fading as the seconds ticked by and Dumbledore held his gaze with the same unwavering seriousness that he delivered the news with.
Draco couldn’t mourn the loss of his own magical signature because what replaced it felt so right. He couldn’t feel sick or scared about what he had just done because it felt so much better than anything he had ever done before. Draco had never felt more whole. That itself should have scared him.
Gripping Draco firmly around his waist, Harry threw him down on his back and climbed between Draco’s legs. The kiss became almost savage, more tongue than lips with hands that were everywhere. Harry was drowning in a sea of Draco and lust and he didn’t want it to stop.
Harry sighed quietly, looking at Draco, his hand still cradled between Harry’s two. “Draco, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have snapped at you”
Harry and Draco left the castle under the invisibility cloak. It was mutual decision. They knew the halls would be busy what with students leaving the Great Hall after dinner and didn’t want to be stared at or seen at all, especially dressed up and leaving the castle together. Once they had made it to the grounds gate, they removed the cloak and pocketed it.
Harry jumped awake, trembling and rock hard. Never in his life had Harry experienced such a vivid dream. Covered in a light sheen of sweat, he raked a hand through his damp hair and froze.
Harry paused. What did he have to lose? Draco obviously felt something for him, and they had no choice but to spend their lives together now, yet he still hesitated. Expressing how he felt wasn’t really his forte, but he might as well try.
“Some would call it that,” he said quietly, extremely uncomfortable. If someone had told him at the start of the year that he would be in a shared room having this conversation with the chosen one, then he would have suggested they get themselves checked into St Mungo's.
Sorry about the delay on this chapter. I really wanted to get this as close to what I imagined as possible which took some time. I also used one of my absolute favourite Sleeping At Last song lyrics in this chapter because I just had to. Hope you enjoyed this one :)
“Draco!” Harry caught him just as he dropped to the floor. “Shit, Draco” Harry muttered, carrying him over to a bed and gently putting him down.
It didn’t take Harry long to find his toothbrush and nightwear. He went to the bathroom and got ready for bed, not wanting Malfoy to walk in on him changing. After a few minutes, he went back into the bedroom and saw Malfoy still hadn’t followed. Harry wasn’t sure which bed he should take. It felt like an odd thing to be worried about, but this was Malfoy he was talking about. “Screw it, he isn’t here so I’m just taking the one I want,” Harry thought and climbed into the bed on the left, blowing out the candles a house-elf must have lit at some point and promptly fell asleep.
Draco drank and felt the potion smooth down his throat, then warmth spread through him, instantly relaxing him. “Thank you” he nodded at Madam Pomfrey.
“But why did you… why did you act the way you did? Why didn’t you talk to me?” Harry asked, suddenly sad for all the time lost.
“Draco…” Harry started after having sat down on the sofa opposite him. He wasn’t sure what to say and so decided not to say anything, until Draco’s eyes finally reached his own and Harry felt like the world had stopped moving. Draco looked so open, every emotion was visible on his face. The mask was gone and what had replaced it was so scared and vulnerable and so… beautiful. Harry felt his breath catch in his throat.
Harry smiled to himself in the mirror. He didn’t look half bad. He had found some of his nicer clothes at the bottom of his still unpacked trunk and managed to straighten them out with a quick spell. Harry had considered wearing robes but even after eight years in the magical community, robes still confused him.
Harry gasped then. He could feel it. Feel everything that was Draco flowing beside his core and within him, consuming him in a fire that burned in the most pleasant way.
Harry suddenly remembered how to breathe when Draco nipped at his ear again and he gasped suddenly. A quiet chuckle rumbled through Draco’s chest, but he didn’t tease, just continued to kiss his way around Harry’s face before finally hovering his lips just centimetres from Harry’s.
I know this must sound impossible and you’re most likely sick of hearing this but please, try to get along. At least try.
“I’m not” Harry smiled, gently taking Draco’s hand. “You’d be amazing. I mean, with a brain like yours, you could do anything you wanted.”
“So?” Draco responded casually, still flicking through a textbook. If only he could find why dragon’s blood was so volatile in a truth serum, then he would be able to-
Malfoy’s fist connected with Harry’s jaw effectively cutting him off. Harry hadn’t even seen him stand up but that was it. Draco went for a second, but Harry stood, grabbing Malfoy’s wrist, and shoved him away hard.
“Yes, I know the rules Potter” Draco picked up his glass and tucked his legs under himself. “Okay then. Never have I ever cheated on a test”
Draco played with his sleeve and shrugged. “It was how excited you were when you saw her” Draco admitted, feeling stupid and vulnerable but the bond forced him on, and he couldn’t stop the words coming out. “How you lit up and how you hugged her. It’s dumb. I know it is. She’s your friend and she’s with your best friend. And you’re gay. But I just got angry because I-I wanted that” Draco flushed red and refused to meet Harry’s eyes.
Draco shrugged, “I told you. I’m not good at this stuff. I’ve never been close to someone in that way before. I didn’t want to throw myself out there knowing I’d get hurt”
“Draco” Harry spoke gently, leaning forward with his elbows resting on his knees. “Look at me” he prompted.
Harry sighed and pulled Draco into a tight hug. “I’m sorry” he whispered into Draco’s hair. “Let’s go back to the rooms to talk”
“I cannot force all the blame on you two though. Some new information has come to light whilst you were both recovering” This caught Malfoy’s interest and he looked up too. “While Madame Pomfrey was checking over your bonds this morning, she discovered some information. Explaining how is much too complicated so I shall just skip to what she found” Dumbledore smiled at the two, almost as if for dramatic effect and all Draco wanted to do was tell him to get on with it.
Both watched in fascinated horror as that bright ball of light slowly faded away to reveal both the blue and red band had begun to intertwine with one another.
We wanted to visit but Dumbledore said you needed time, something about us being there would affect the bonding. He refused to even tell us where your rooms are. You can still write to us though.
Harry grabbed his glasses off the bedside table behind him and propped himself up on his elbow. “Malfoy” He kept his voice gentle, as if not to disturb the air around him. Yet he still managed to startle Draco who wiped his face quickly and turned his head away. “Malfoy, I know you’re awake. Please don’t ignore me”
The walk was quiet and quick. An alcove near Dumbledore’s office seemed to have gathered a few third years and the stares received made Draco greatly uncomfortable. It was a relief when they got to the door, both muttering the password and disappearing up the staircase.
“I’m sure we have done more than enough for today Draco” Harry was close to begging at this point. They had gone over the work for today twice and already done most of their homework that had been set last week. Yet, every time Harry said he was done, Draco would find something else for him to do. “Let’s at least take a break. We could have lunch, play a game of wizards chess?” Harry suggested, gently closing Draco’s book, and taking his quill from his hand.
It took a few moments before reality settled back into Harry and he could catch his breath. He felt wrecked in such an incredible way. Draco tugged at Harry’s arm, forcing him to turn and face him, a lazy smile gracing his lips.
I'm so sorry it has taken me so long to upload! I take full responsibility. I'll try to keep on top of the story :) Please enjoy x
“But this is different. This time it wouldn’t be an accident. This time we are willingly choosing it” Draco said, looking down at his clasped hands.
Slowly, Draco turned his hand palm up and clasped Harry’s hand, almost experimentally. It was warm and heavy, rough in places and yet so smooth in others. And it felt ridiculously right in Draco’s hand.
As always, it didn’t take Harry long to finish up in the bathroom and get dressed. He ruffled his hair, pulling at a few strands and managing to make it look less insane due to it’s damp state before going searching for Draco.
“I’m sorry” he whispered causing Potter’s brow to furrow. “I’m sorry about the fight and what I said”
Both boys were startled when there was a sudden tapping on the window on the far wall. A small brown owl was perched on the window ledge with a roll of parchment tied to its leg. Harry jumped up when he realised, it was Ron’s new owl. “Sorry girl, I have no treats” He spoke quietly, taking the scroll and petting the bird.
“Hey” Harry hit his arm gently. “I am not a prude. I just would rather talk to you about us than bloody Madam Pomfrey or anyone else for that matter. But I am sorry for worrying you, it wasn’t my intention”
He spun on his broom and flew in the direction Harry had focused on. He saw the snitch and sped up. Harry was hot on his tail.
Draco opened his eyes and ran his thumb gently over Harry’s bottom lip, causing Harry to suck in a sharp breath, his tongue following Draco's finger on instinct. Draco seemed to be thinking long and hard about something before he came to an obvious decision and sat back on his hunches, letting Harry up.
Harry stared. Draco had really felt like this the whole time? Harry couldn’t believe it but he knew Draco wasn’t lying. He could feel the truth behind the words through the bond. Yet it didn’t seem real.
By the time morning arrived, Draco was both relieved and terrified. Finally, he could escape the torment of his dreams but now, he had to face the real thing. He had to spend another day teasingly close to Harry Potter.
Draco smiled. Harry was too interested in staring at his thumbs to see it. “You definitely proved you're not a lost cause” Draco teased before letting himself open up a little, “But I’ve enjoyed it too. It’s shocking but we do work well together”
Draco struggled to sleep that night. Every few hours he would awake in a cold sweat, breathless and unbelievably aroused. His dreams were torturing him. No matter how many times he went back to sleep, the same scene would replay in his dreams. Harry’s lingering gaze, his dark features, and plump lips slowly edging closer. Only, in his dream, Draco didn’t pull away. Dream after dream of Harry kissing Draco breathless on the sofa or grinding against one another with Draco’s back to a wall or Harry pinned under Draco on the floor by the fire. Each dream seeming to drive Draco crazier than the last. A couple of times, he was so worked up, Draco had to quietly sneak into the bathroom to deal with his arousal.
Harry shook his head to clear it, trying to find the right words. “So, you’re not saying that the bond doesn’t affect you… You’re saying that you’re used to it?”
“It’s real simple Draco” Harry spoke with purpose. It was strange, Harry could see how Draco was feeling but it was almost like he could feel it too. It was almost like the hot and cold run of magic through his core.
Are you okay? Ron’s worried sick. He freaked when you disappeared from the hospital wing and didn’t come back to the dorm last night. He almost broke down Dumbledore’s office door to find out what was happening.
There was nothing wrong with the room they had been given, both boys would have even appreciated them if it hadn’t been for the circumstances that they had been gifted them. It was like their own dormitory. The main room was lovely with two large sofas, a table between and a roaring fire which was already warming the room quite nicely. Dumbledore even had a dining table and several large, stocked bookshelves to be added so the room felt comfier. What neither boys liked was the single bedroom. Harry had hoped they would at least be given separate rooms but that wasn’t the case, however, they had been graced with two beds. The room was decorated in an attempt to keep both of them happy. This was clear through the odd mix of red and green sheets and pillows.
Draco was searching to find the right words. He pulled his hand back and started playing with his fingers in his lap. After a few minutes, it was apparent that Draco wasn’t going to speak first so Harry took over.
“Potter” Malfoy called, coming into the bedroom. “Potter! You need to get up” He tried again but instead of making any attempt at waking up, Harry just grunted and rolled onto his stomach. Malfoy considered leaving and letting their guest wake him up but suddenly had a better idea. With a sharp tug, Malfoy ripped the duvet off of Harry. What Malfoy hadn’t realised was just how tangled Harry was and so ended being flipped off the bed with force.
“What did you dream about?” Draco muttered, his hand now teasing the waistband of Harry’s pants, one finger slipping in to brush his skin.
Meanwhile, Harry was a mess of trembling need and emotions beneath Draco. Harry had never felt like this before. He and Ginny had done things, but nothing had ignited him the way Draco could. Harry felt almost desperate with need and yet, somehow also felt calm and safe. He felt cared for and it only drove him further insane with want.
“So” Harry smirked, taking a few steps forward. “What was that all about?” He asked. He knew he was teasing but he couldn’t help it, watching Draco fidget was so unlike him and it made Harry feel slightly giddy with power.
“Ah! There you are!” The booming voice of Slughorn had both Harry and Draco nearly jumping out of their skin. “I didn’t think you were coming but never mind, here you are. Well, it’s all set for you two, I did it all myself” Slughorn was almost beaming and it bothered Draco immensely. “Don’t worry about anything once you’re done. Just head straight back to your rooms. Now go on, go on”
It was only when Harry had returned to Draco’s neck that Draco could force out a few breathless words.
Harry wanted to know how Draco felt. He must feel something. Harry was sure he did, but he didn’t know how Draco would react if Harry acted on his own growing feelings. Twice Draco had pulled away now. It didn’t upset Harry as much as it frustrated him. He couldn’t figure out if Draco was playing with him or nervous. He would have guessed the latter.
Harry took his head from his hands and looked up at Draco whose face was suddenly much closer than he remembered it being. Draco realised it too. He had lent in while speaking and for some reason, didn’t move when Harry lifted his head.
“Draco” Harry breathed, wanting to kiss him but not having enough leverage what with being pinned by Draco’s body and hands.
Harry smirked, twisting onto his side, and propping himself up. “Harry, I think you meant” Harry corrected, rethinking last night, and watching colour rise up Draco’s neck.
Harry blushed, tugging at his sleeves gently. He had chosen a blue button up shirt with grey pants and a matching blazer. In comparison to Draco, he felt very self-conscious indeed. Draco looked incredible.
And of course, Draco looked because Potter said his name, his actual name as if it were a prayer and he wanted to hear it again. But when he looked into Potter’s eyes, those bright, shining, innocent green eyes, he caved.
Ah, the mask is back then, thought Harry, that didn’t take long. “Good morning Madame Pomfrey,” he said politely.
Draco was desperately trying to fight down his feelings, but they all felt so much stronger. He was anxious because for the first time, it truly was just him and Harry. It was when they flew that Draco would allow himself to assess Harry, to focus on him, to admit to himself that maybe it was okay that he had feelings for Harry. It was only in the air that Draco even entertained the thought that maybe Harry would like him back one day.
With the old attitude of Malfoy, Draco swung open the door and leaned against the frame. “Struggling to find the exit, Granger?” he sneered.
With some sort of newfound determination, Draco went back to the main room to see Potter hadn’t moved an inch. He had this sort of glazed over expression and his cheeks were bright red from being so close to the fire for so long.
“I’m not sure. I think we may have pissed off the bond, I think it was trying to stop us fighting” Draco glanced at Harry, a strange look in his eyes. He opened his mouth to speak but the hospital doors suddenly opened, and Malfoy stopped himself, looking up to see Dumbledore approaching their beds.
Draco’s stomach turned in unease and Harry could feel the slight anxiety suddenly creeping into Draco.
“Professor, just one more time, how did this happen?” Harry asked, desperate that Dumbledore would see a mistake, a flaw, a reason that this couldn’t be true.
“You don’t” Harry cut Dumbledore off. He didn’t want to hear it. He couldn’t hear it. Especially not with him sat no more than six feet away. Dumbledore sighed and put his hands on the desk in front of him.
“How could you betray us like this Harry? He’s a death eater” The pure genuine confusion and disgust made Harry feel sick. He couldn’t believe that people were still so cruel months after the war had finished. He would have given anything to have been able to drag Draco away from it all but he knew they needed to get through this.
After being ignored again, Draco placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder. Harry spun around quickly; Draco took a sudden step back.
Thankfully, after an hour, Harry received a letter back from Dumbledore stating what they would have to do to stay safe and what time they were to be back at. If they were happy to comply then they were free to go. Harry sadly didn’t hide his excitement quick enough and Draco was immediately suspicious.
“Harry” Draco breathed, and Harry brought his lips back to Draco’s mouth. He kissed Draco for all his worth but when Draco’s teethed scraped across Harry’s bottom lip, he snapped.
And just when the pressure around them grew too much. It began to release them. The light began to fade. The potion changed back to purple. The room grew quiet and still once again. Everything was as it was.
The walk back to their rooms was silent but Harry held Draco’s hand the whole way. Even when they approached the castle entrance and Draco tried to pull away, Harry kept a tight grasp. He knew no one would see them. Classes were still on and so he refused to let Draco shy away.
Draco reluctantly met Harry’s gaze and let himself bask in the calmness that was reflected in them. Harry smiled and to him amazement, Draco smiled shyly back. Harry could of swore his heart stopped for a moment.
“I had an idea” Harry smiled at Draco, freeing his hand, and reaching into his pocket. He pulled out a small gold snitch. “I got it as a gift from Hermione” Harry admired the snitch for a moment then caught Draco’s eye. “Want to play?”
The corridor was almost packed with fourth and fifth year students with the odd third and sixth year. The excited chatter died immediately when Harry and Draco walked out. Harry cursed under his breath. Those damn third years, Harry thought when he saw the same group in the crowd.
Returning to their rooms the next morning had been a very awkward affair. Draco was mortified. He had cried in front of Potter, Harry Potter. He even apologised to the prat. He was shocked at himself, slightly angry too for allowing himself to be so open. So vulnerable. Yet he couldn’t rid himself of the image. The image of Harry’s bright eyes in the dark room and the whisper of Draco’s name, so soft on his lips. Draco shivered at the thought alone.
A soft sigh escaped Draco and he buried his head into side of Harry’s neck. “Just once” he mumbled and let himself be coaxed in a deep sleep.
Harry was about to ask about his wand when he felt Draco stir beside him. Harry watched as Draco’s eye’s fluttered open.
“Yes, you’ve said that. But I am worried” Draco started to realise why the bond was humming so violently under his skin. It wanted them to talk. Wanted Draco to tell Harry his worries and fix it. The feeling was strange, foreign to Draco.
Draco cursed and jumped on his broom, quickly ascending. Draco scanned the air, watching for that flash of gold when Harry appeared beside him, smirking. He opened his mouth to speak but his eyes locked on something in the distance over Draco's shoulder and Draco wasted no time.
“I told you” Draco’s cheeks felt warm and Harry raised an eyebrow at him. “If my choices are between death and being your friend, I think it’s safe to say I’d rather live even if this is the cost”
Malfoy shrugged “There’s also option three” He lifted a hand and pointed “I could push you out that window” he suggested with a sideways glance at Harry and a smirk.
It took Draco a moment to understand what Potter was asking him. He was more shocked at the civil, almost gentle tone Potter had used. After removing his robe and casting it onto the closest sofa, he joined Harry on the floor.
Draco tugged at Harry’s hair gently and was rewarded with a sweet moan. The slow dance of their tongues was slowly becoming a battle for control. Harry’s hands slid up Draco’s back and pulled him closer, gripping his waist firmly. Draco tugged at Harry’s hair just a little harder and Harry groaned louder, breaking off the kiss and placing open mouthed kisses down Draco’s throat.
“That do it for you, Potter?” Harry could practically feel Draco’s smirk. He almost growled in response, grabbing Draco’s jaw, and pulling him back into a searing kiss. Harry backed Draco up against the table, planting open-mouthed kisses down the side of his neck and pressing him back into the tabletop. Draco’s legs spread just the slightest and his hands slid under the back of Harry’s shirt while he ran his tongue over Harry’s bottom lip.
And now, stood in the field with a broom in hand, he knew Harry could feel his nerves. They were gathering more and more as they walked to the centre of the pitch and Harry thankfully hadn’t commented.
“Ah-ah, we’re not playing that game” Harry interrupted Draco immediately, his hand raising to stop him. “You can’t go closing yourself off like that. Not now” There was an edge of seriousness that crept its way into Harry’s voice and Draco’s original plan of blowing it all off, wavered.
It took a few moments. Draco was fighting himself. He hurt. But it wasn’t physical pain anymore. His heart ached. And all Draco wanted to do was talk to Potter, but he couldn’t because what if he didn’t listen? Didn’t care?
“Damn it Malfoy! Why is it every time you get close to finally trusting me you close yourself off? Talk to me” Harry demanded.
“Well, alright, I do have a talent for it, and I’d like to use it. To help people. Find new medicines, cure the ill. I’d like that” Draco spoke to his glass, glancing up at Harry now and then.
Harry paused, “I-I hadn’t thought about it that way but, I mean, does it matter? Everyone so far has told us that this bond can’t be broken so it isn’t like we are choosing to solidify something that could go away. We would be doing it to help ourselves. That’s all. Right?”
“I’m not! I swear, I am trying. I’m not good at this stuff. I wasn’t” Draco paused, his throat feeling tight suddenly. “I’m not trying to be a prat. I just don’t know how to do this” his broke at the end and his eyes shone with unshed tears. Draco had no idea where it had come from, but he felt terrible.
Draco still didn’t seem convinced. Harry leaned across the small table and said quietly, “I have something that may change your mind” he grinned and stood up, disappearing into the bedroom. Harry went searching through his trunk, phishing out his invisibility cloak and the bottle hidden inside before returning to Draco.
Harry stayed perfectly still, except for one hand which rested on Draco’s cheek, caressing Draco with the pad of his thumb. Draco pulled back slowly, his breath a little shallower than it should have been for such a simple kiss and he was a little too flushed.
The conversation ended rather quickly after that. Neither of them spoke for a long while but neither of them moved either. Instead, they shared a slightly tense silence, wrapped up in their own worries and thoughts about how this could ever work between them. During their silence, a house-elf arrived asking if either of them wanted dinner since it was getting late. Both boys felt too uneasy to eat so after a polite refusal from Harry and a sharp “No” from Draco, the house-elf left.
After their last exchanging of words, they had finished lunch and Draco had decided to spend the rest of the evening reading a potions book. Harry had no idea how someone could sit for nearly four hours reading about potions. Instead, Harry had taken a seat by the fire, deep in thought. It was around this time yesterday that Harry had been sat in Dumbledore’s office and told that he and Malfoy were stuck for life.
With a sigh, Harry stood. “We should get some sleep” He suggested, feeling entirely too exhausted for just eight o’clock.
Harry jumped a little, startled to see Malfoy sat with him. “I’d like to-“ Draco stopped again and sighed, rubbing his eyes.
And that was it. Harry woke up a few hours later in the hospital wing beside Malfoy. His blood had dropped into the potion and caused such a magical force that both he and Malfoy were knocked clean out.
“I’m the one with a superiority complex? That's rich! You’re the chosen one! The Saviour! All you’ve ever done is prove how better you are than us all!” Malfoy was shaking with anger and aimed another punch at Potter, going for his nose this time.
It took a moment for the words to sink in, “Wait… So, you’re gay?” Harry asked, blunter than he’d intended.
“I said I was sorry!” Harry tried to look apologetic, but he couldn’t help the smile that took over his face.
Harry spoke confidently but Draco didn’t move to drink. “You can’t lie,” Harry said, sounding a little annoyed.
“No, no I knew that” Harry sighed. “I haven’t told anyone. I wasn’t ready to tell Hermione or Ron but now, Merlin, everyone must know” Harry felt sick with nerves.
Harry didn’t say a word. Too many words sat on his tongue and he struggled to get any out. Instead, he just nodded dumbly and went to collect his books from his trunk, along with Hermione’s notes whilst trying to get his heart rate back under control.
“No one is unaffected by you Draco” Harry spoke gently, his eyes trained on Draco’s lips. “You’re gorgeous”
It was around four in the afternoon now and neither of them had eaten since breakfast in the hospital wing or spoken in about an hour. Malfoy hadn’t left the bedroom and Harry didn’t have the courage to go in yet.
Draco didn’t know if he would rather run away from the crowds or hex every student there. But when he felt Harry’s discomfort at that one comment, his heart sunk. Did Harry still think of him that way? Was he just as disgusted at having had to bond to a death eater, as one student nicely pointed out? Draco felt sick, stressed. Maybe Harry was just making do with Draco. Maybe it was all an act.
Harry had no idea what time it was when he woke up, but he would have guessed about two or three in the morning. The hospital wing was dark and empty, any patients Pomfrey had having been dealt with and able to leave before curfew. Harry wasn’t sure what woke him up, but he realised with delight that he didn’t feel so weak anymore. That second potion Pomfrey gave him did the trick. He felt good.
“No. I didn’t” Harry gently placed his forefinger under Draco’s chin, pulling Draco’s eyes up. “It was uncalled for. The bond may be affecting me but letting it take over how I feel isn’t fair when I take it out on you”
“How is it obvious? I don’t think I ever saw you two together, other than in class” Harry cast his mind back, shaking his head as he thought.
Harry found himself chuckling “Good one” and felt the mood shift to something lighter, something much easier to manage. “What time is it?”
Hope you like the new chapter! Kudos and comments are always greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading :)
Draco released Harry and gripped his hips, giving a few last thrusts before he came hard with a low growl against Harry’s cheek.
Harry got out of bed and stretched, not missing Draco’s wandering eyes before he turned quickly back to his trunk. “I just wanted to know if you were going to be awkward about last night” Harry shrugged. He was surprised by the sudden ease he felt.
“You’d be good at that. Salazar, I’ve seen you fight. You could have taken down the ministry if you wanted to” Draco laughed but his eyes held Harry’s, he was serious. “You’re pretty incredible yourself”
Harry put all this down to habit though, of course. Through sixth year Harry watched Malfoy like a hawk and with good reason, so he was bound to notice things. It’s just a habit, Harry would convince himself, a habit he’d yet to shake. That is the only reason Harry's eye was drawn to the Slytherin table at almost every meal and why Harry would sometimes struggle to concentrate in potions with Malfoy so close.
Draco sucked in a harsh breath, and gently put his hands on Harry’s shoulders, leaning back. His cheeks were red, his heart was racing, and his breathing was shallow.
“No as long as the bond is strong it should be fine… I think” The last two words were mumbled but Harry caught them.
Draco searched Potter’s eyes. After a few moments, Draco looked like he was happy with what he found in them because he seemed to visibly relax just a little more.
Luckily, the hallways weren’t as busy as they normally were at this time. They weren’t sure why but were both relieved to avoid the staring and whispering as they began to descend the stairs that lead to the dungeons. Their steps began to echo off the walls of the empty corridor, the only sound breaking the silence. Harry felt awkward but kept quiet. He was aware that this wasn’t the time to break out the small talk.
Five o’clock crept up on the boys fast, too fast in Harry’s opinion. Draco was right. This was different. This time they were choosing to bond to each other. Yes, it meant that things would be easier, but it didn’t change the fact that they were now willingly walking towards the potions classroom where they would willingly bond to each other. Solidifying the fact that Harry and Draco would be spending the rest of their lives together. It didn’t matter that Harry felt slightly more comfortable with that thought than he had when he was first told. It was still new, still big, and still very scary.
Reality seemed to suddenly hit Harry and he blushed hard. He sat up quickly, his face and neck burning. “Shit, um, sorry. I got a bit caught up”
Draco sighed, putting down his fork. “A bit, I guess. He wasn’t the greatest father, but I know he loved me in his own way”
To Harry’s shock, Malfoy found himself blushing “That’s because they are” Draco managed to say calmly but then stuttered his way through the rest “Strengthening the bond will involve us having to spend time in close quarters and getting along whereas, um, completing the, um, bond… Well that involves a more intimate act” Draco refused to look Potter in the eye instead, he was picking at the rug under them both.
“Yes Draco” Harry laughed again but Draco didn’t feel like he was being laughed at. It only made him feel better. “I want to go on a date with you. I want to do this as much as you do. Trust me”
Harry felt as if an invisible force was gently trying to pull him back to Draco’s side. The more he resisted, the more the bond hummed through his body. Energy seemed to be building up inside him. It wouldn’t have been so bad if he could stop replaying the kiss from early but it was as if the bond was trying to torture him.
Standing, Draco held out his hand to Harry who dragged him back down. “I’m too tired to move” Harry lied, pulling Draco across his body so his head rested on Harry’s chest. He couldn’t explain it, but the thought of having to sleep alone with Draco so teasingly close was too much.
“Aren’t you always?” Draco laughed. “I don’t understand how one person can eat so much and not end up the size of a hippogriff”
Harry sat there; shell shocked. He knew he should have been feeling rejected, hurt even. But he didn’t. He didn’t think that was a rejection. Something told him it wasn’t. It didn’t feel like one. He felt his adrenaline slowly leaving his system and he lent back, covering his eyes with his forearm, and remembering Draco’s soft blush, his slight breathlessness, and his lingering gaze on Harry’s lips. No. It wasn’t a rejection, Harry concluded with a smile.
“I don’t know what to do” Draco sighed. “I know that it would be smart to take Dumbledore’s offer but…”
Draco made an undignified sound at that, “You want me to sleep on a sofa, with a perfectly good bed 15 feet away?” He sounded shocked someone could even suggest such a thing and it made Harry chuckle.
Rosmerta came over and Harry dropped the silencing spell, letting them both order drinks and food before returning the charm.
The potion began to change colour. No longer the deep purple, but now a beautiful strong silver that started flowing upwards. Up out of the cauldron and around Draco’s wrist, followed by Harry’s in a figure of eight. Harry looked at Draco and their eyes locked.
Dumbledore didn’t linger long. He bid them both a nice evening and left swiftly with that ever so annoying twinkle in his eye.
On the sofa, by the dimly lit fire, sat a rather nervous looking Draco Malfoy. And that was when Harry felt it. It wasn’t terribly strong at first, but the more Harry focused on it, the stronger it grew.
The walk back was quiet. Neither spoke but it was a comfortable silence, one that didn’t need filling. Draco felt content and Harry was very pleased with how the night had gone.
“I then spent this morning speaking to both Madame Pomfrey and Professor McGonagall, and we have decided that the best course of action from here is to have you both reperform the bonding ritual correctly. This should hopefully right the bonding process”
Harry’s speech chased away every little niggling doubt in Draco’s mind and thrilled him to the very core. It filled him with a raw passion he hadn’t ever felt before and he leaned closer, his lips brushing Harry’s provocatively.
Harry smiled back, a warm rush overtaking him, and he ran over to hug her. “Merlin, I’ve missed you” he chuckled, letting her go.
They both took their wands and put them on the table before Harry picked up the scalpel and released Draco’s hand. He sliced down the middle of his palm and passed Draco the knife who did the same with a slight wince.
“I surrender who I’ve been for who you are” Harry nearly choked on the words when that same red light burst from his chest and the icy blue from Draco’s. “I tether my self and soul to you” The lights drifted towards each other and when the touched, a bright light encased Harry and Draco.
“Almost done” He smiled at her once more “Gentlemen, I need you to understand the seriousness of the situation now. This is no longer about your childhood rivalry. This is about your safety. The bond reacted the way it did because you aren’t acting the way you should. Like it or not, the bond demands closeness and affection. Fighting could kill you both. Please listen to what I’m telling you and get some rest, you need it” Dumbledore nodded to them both and Pomfrey, before leaving.
“Malfoy” For the first time, the word left a bitter taste on Harry’s tongue. He tried it again. It didn’t feel right, and Malfoy was still ignoring him.
Draco shook his head; almost sensing what Harry was thinking. He walked over, “I like what you’ve done with your hair but wait” Draco look around “Where are your glasses?”
Harry’s hand shot out, grasping Malfoy’s wrist in a vice-like hold and glared at him. “Don’t” Such a simple word but the fire in Harry’s eyes held the real threat and with a rough shove, Malfoy was forced to let go of him and step back.
“I feel” Harry coughed, his voice hoarse “I’m a little sore and tired, but that’s all. I feel fine,” He lied, forcing a weak smile.
Harry sat himself down and began to think long and hard. There was only one way they could get themselves past this bit. They had to be completely honest with each other. Harry understood now how much effort it must have taken for Malfoy to come and talk to him and Harry had essentially shot him down. He felt incredibly guilty. Draco was trying and Harry knew that whatever it took for Malfoy to start that conversation was gone after Harry’s little speech. This time it was up to Harry.
“Fuck” Draco slowly dipped a second finger past Harry’s waistband and Harry pushed into his touched.
Harry had to think for a moment, there were a few comments this morning. None of them were pleasant but Harry knew which one Draco was talking about.
The next day was not what the boys had expected or wanted. They had both woken up in a good mood, happily working through assignments in a comfortable silence until about noon when Madame Pomfrey sent a house elf to summon them to the hospital wing.
Harry was having a similar issue. He was embarrassed. He had called Malfoy ‘Draco’ last night. He knew why. His emotions were sky high and he remembered just wanting Malfoy to look at him, wanting to make everything okay. But Harry knew that was the bond now. The bond was making him feel like this or at least made his feelings stronger. And while this knowledge didn’t stop his embarrassment, it certainly helped.
Draco interrupted, “You said ‘never have I dated a girl from Slytherin. It isn’t my fault you chose the wrong gender”
“Right” Draco said firmly after a long, shuddering deep breath. He turned to Harry and took out his wand, “Ready?”
Draco smiled back and his eyes dropped to Harry's lips. Harry felt his heart suddenly jump in his chest and bit his lip gently. Draco reached up, using his thumb to pull Harry's lip out from between his teeth and nipped at it.
“You know I did in second year” Harry took his shot without hesitation. “Never have I ever dated a Slytherin girl”
Draco smiled, “You know what I meant. You’re slim and have some muscle definition, but it isn’t over the top. It’s good”
Harry sighed, hiding his face with one hand. “Questions about us. Some embarrassingly, overly personal, way too intimate questions about us” Harry groaned, clearly reliving the awful experience.
“I know Poppy. It’ll be quick” He smiled at her and took his place at the bottom of both Harry and Draco’s beds. “Gentlemen” Harry looked away immediately. He knew they were in trouble, but he didn’t know how much yet. “Not even hours after Madame Pomfrey reminded you both of the importance of getting along and we find you unconscious, bloody and bruised. You are lucky Madame Pomfrey decided to send over some Pepperup Potions or we may have found you too late” It surprised Harry how calm Dumbledore sounded and he looked up to find he didn’t seem all that angry. Or even disappointed.
With Draco’s hand on his shoulder, Harry guided them to the Three Broomsticks. There were a few in the pub but not many thankfully. Harry approached the bar, requesting a private table for two and two menus which earned him a knowing smile from Rosmerta. Harry assumed Dumbledore had let her know they were coming.
“What have they said?” Harry spoke very carefully, his voice shaking but only slightly. He didn’t want to worry yet, he needed to know the damage done first.
“Draco, that would have happened anyway. We’ve been doing well, slowly understanding how to do this and eventually, we would have reached a point where we were doing so well that the bond would have strengthened.”
Malfoy didn’t feel good. His chest felt tight. His head started to swim. His breath was too short, too quick. He was panicking. The news had hit him now. Hearing that he was bonded to Potter for life and seeing the evidence were two very different things. What little respect the wizarding world still had for him would be gone once the news spread. He could see the Prophet now. ‘Death Eater Bonded to the Chosen One.’ People would think of it as some sort of plot, revenge maybe. Their poor Golden Boy condemned to a life of misery by his side. Pomfrey asked them to get along. That was impossible. Malfoy tried many years ago to be friends, but Potter made it very clear where his loyalty lay. Still, what was he going to do? Spend every minute of his life sneering? Draco was good but not that good. He would crumble eventually and then what? Potter would see through his facade. This wasn’t going to work, he couldn’t do this, he-
“This morning, on the way to the hospital wing. Why did that comment throw you so much?” Draco didn’t want to ask; he didn’t want an answer, but it seemed the bond was determined to get what it wanted.
“I want this to work too. Honestly, Draco, I haven’t wanted to fight you in a long time” Harry had to look away to get the words out. “Opening up is difficult for you, I know that. It is for me too. I’m sorry I pushed you because you’re right. You were trying. And I completely shut you down which wasn’t my intention. I… I know that you’ve, um, we’ve matured a lot and I think, I mean I’d like to-“ Harry seemed stuck and Draco decided to help.
“Who?” Immediately fell from Harry's lips, sounding too eager but he couldn’t deny that he wanted to know.
Harry had opted not to wear them. After all the years of Draco’s comments on them, he assumed he would look best without them so had cast a spell that would help him see. It only worked for a few hours and honestly, Harry wasn’t brilliant at the spell at best.
Draco sat simmering by the fire. Today hadn’t gone very well. The comment that student had made earlier, and Harry’s reaction still rolled around his head and made him feel sick. Draco’s curiosity burned and anxiety heightened every time he wondered what Madam Pomfrey had said, despite Harry insisting it was nothing. And then Granger. He hadn’t meant to react to her like that, but she felt like an intruder in this space Draco was beginning to love. And when she touched Harry. Draco tried not to drown in the wave of jealousy that overcame him when he remembered how Harry had smiled when he saw her and how he’d wrapped her up in such a loving embrace. Logically he knew that Granger was with the Weasel and that Harry was gay, but that didn’t stop the bond burning at the thought.
“I know but it doesn’t hurt to be nice,” Harry said simply, sitting on the opposite sofa and grabbing a sandwich from the table. “Besides,” he said with a chuckle “Hermione would have my head if she caught me even using a house-elf, never mind being rude to one” He smiled fondly.
Draco felt cold and dizzy. Is that what the rest of his life would be? No, it would be worse. The wizarding world would happily give their opinion. What happens when they don’t have the walls of Hogwarts to protect them? Would Harry want to leave?
Luckily, Madame Pomfrey did leave rather swiftly, just giving some last-minute advice on how to get through the next few days while the bond settled down. Harry hardly listened.
Harry smiled a little, tension in his shoulders smoothing. It wasn’t that he didn’t want Draco. He really did. But he didn’t know if he was ready for that step yet. It was crazy to think they’d only been bonded for just over a week.
“As I was saying to Mr Potter, I believe your bond is doing well and that your progress with each other is helping it along. Don’t worry about completing the bond any time soon if you aren’t ready, it seems stable enough so far. Give yourself a moment before you stand, Mr Malfoy.” Madam Pomfrey then pulled Harry to the side to speak to him.
Draco’s breath caught in his throat and he had to force himself to stay focused on the conversation. It was easier when Potter let go of his chin.
Harry pouted ever so slightly, and his head cocked a little, trying to figure out what Draco was thinking. “What is it?” Harry asked, cradling a hot chocolate between his hands.
Draco hesitated but took Harry’s hand, shaking it firmly. He gave Harry a small smile “Might as well try”
Draco tore his eyes away from his book and fixed Harry with a steady glare. “I am not here for your entertainment Potter. Go find something to do”
“Now” Dumbledore put the parchment to the side and looked at Harry then Draco, “There was something else. Last night Miss Granger came to my office with an idea. She found an old tome in the library that had some especially useful information about unsteady bonds.” Harry felt his heart clench. She was still looking out for him.
Harry’s brow furrowed. “You overthink a lot, you know? It’s nothing to worry about” he said, taking a sip from his mug.
“Alright” Harry smiled, “So, do you know how to do the ritual then? Do I need to learn some big speech about how I’m going to devote myself to you?”
“Because” Harry shrugged himself up further, mumbling into his mug. “I don’t like that people still think of you that way. You’re not who you were or what you did. None of us are”
With a smile, Draco turned away from the mirror and looked at Harry. “Wow” he chuckled, “You clean up good”
“What do we do?” He asked. After that conversation, he had so many questions, but Draco just kept walking down the stairs.
Harry visibly grimaced, “That’s a long story that one” he tried to cover up with a soft laugh. “Probably best for another day”
Hermione sat on their sofa, looking more uncomfortable than Harry had ever seen her. Yet she smiled at Harry, standing when he walked into the room.
“You do?” Harry asked, surprised but thankful to have them back on. “But you always used to tease me”
“Yet you’re still hesitating. Why? What’s the worst that could happen?” Harry tried to sound encouraging, knowing this was their best option.
“Professor Dumbledore wanted me to check on you and you weren’t in your rooms” She stepped in, examining the boys with narrowed eyes, “Did something go wrong?”
“The Saviour cleaning? I couldn’t imagine” Malfoy knew once the words were out that he’d made a mistake. Potter’s eyes flashed with some unknown emotion before being replaced with anger.
Harry nodded, “Thanks for coming Hermione. How did you find us by the way? I thought you said that Dumbledore wouldn’t tell you”
