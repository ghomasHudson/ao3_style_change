“What did he say?” Harry asked, gnawing on a chicken leg.
“Farley, Nott, what the fuck are you doing? We've missed three shots at goal due to a Bludger attacking us!” Flint fumed.
“I understand this may be somewhat distressing,” Snape said quietly. “There has been a further attack. I regret to inform you that Miss Granger has been Petrified.”
Draco followed him into the cool hall of Gringotts. A few minutes later, they were squeezed into a cart along with a goblin, and were travelling at breakneck speeds along the twisty track to Harry's vault. The ride was even more enjoyable than last year, since he didn't have a queasy Hagrid in the cart with him.
“And this is Mother's favourite clothing store.”
Flint walked back over. “Hooch says both Bludgers are fine, so are we right to continue?”
At eight o'clock that night the second year Slytherins made their way to the Great Hall in a group, talking excitedly about the Duelling Club.
“My parents died on Halloween, so no, not really.”
She snatched the paper he thrust at her and scanned the front page quickly. “Oh fuck.”
Mrs Malfoy sighed happily. “Well, Harry, I expect you're eager to get home and look at your new purchases, but how about we have lunch first? There's a bakery not too far away that does the most exquisite pastries, and Draco's fond of their milkshakes.”
“Get your parents to send you your book,” Harry suggested. “You could borrow Hedwig if you want.”
To Harry's delight, his potion had turned out perfectly, and he packed up in a much better mood. He paused as he put his hand on the doorknob. “Sir? Could I help with your brewing another time?”
“Last Halloween you were more concerned with saving Miss Granger from Mr Weasley and a troll. What changed?”
“Did he now,” Hagrid growled, frowning at Draco. “And I suppose now you've come to ask me if I'm up to me old tricks, is that it?”
“Come in,” he called. A few seconds later Draco strolled into the bathroom and stared around.
“Maybe one day you'll have to carry a supply of pre-signed photos around with you like I do, but  I don't think you're quite there yet. A little more well known than the average twelve year old, what with that business with You-Know-Who, but that was years ago and fame's a fleeting thing.”
Padma and Morag murmured to each other before turning back to the knocker. “An 'e',” Padma said.
“Ah, good morning boys. I just need to finish this letter to Polly Parkinson. I'll only be a minute.”
“No! I've got too much stuff. Stupid Lockhart books take up half the trunk,” Harry grumbled.
Harry chatted with Draco and Adrian as they finished breakfast. Finally, Flint shut the strategy book he'd been going through with Miles and stood up.
“That's not all. He's also bullied the Hogwarts governors into suspending Dumbledore.”
“I told you that I had preserved my memory in a more lasting method than mere ink. What I didn't tell you was that I've also been slowly draining you of your life force.”
She pulled back and gave him a stern look. “Please, call me Narcissa.”
Harry was woken early on Christmas morning by Draco bouncing onto his bed and shaking him. “Get up, Harry, there are presents!”
********
Draco came down the stairs, and a second later Tilly popped back into the foyer and deposited his trunk next to Harry's.
Harry wondered. He might have a broken arm because of Dobby, but he still didn't want to get Dobby into trouble with Mr Malfoy – who knew how he'd punish the poor elf?
“Might I suggest that with the current threat to the school, and the suspicion hanging over your head, you limit its use to only when it is absolutely necessary?”
The boys said their good nights, then headed upstairs.
at her!”
“How fortunate.
Snape just poured a goblet of cider and pushed it across the table. “Eat, Mr Potter. You'll need a clear head to bottle the Pepperup.”
Snape nodded and got up from his desk. “Your arm, Mr Potter.”
“One time too many, Draco, I don't want any owls about your misbehaviour this year,” she said sharply, then pulled him into a fierce hug. “Good luck with Quidditch try-outs. I love you.”
“You're not hungry?” Vince asked.
“Scared, Weasel?” Harry asked softly.
“They did it! They were there!” Filch cried.
Harry and Draco looked at each other. Millicent was still swinging the heavy book at the pixies surrounding her.
“What? Why?” Draco demanded. “Hermione should be revived soon. Don't you want to see her?”
Harry took a deep breath. “We really did fall asleep, Professor. And we did intend to go to the feast.”
When they reached the Great Hall, they found it decorated with the usual giant pumpkins, with live bats sleeping under the rafters. Students were noisier than usual, looking forward to the feast to come. Harry sat quietly, sipping his tea as he waited for the others to finish eating.
The hall was empty when Snape finally led Harry off the stage. He paused at the doorway and waved his wand a few times, replacing the stage with the usual tables.
: By cherishing my beautiful wife, who is in fact the best wife anyone could have.
: You are an incredible man, Severus, and you deserve everything. You deserve someone who loves you and your passion for potions, who loves your snark and can see the way you care so much about your students. Who honors the sacrifices you made during the last almost twenty years. And I understand if you don’t want to give me or Remus another chance, but I beg you to think about it once more. And if you choose to reject us, a decision we would respect, I just ask of you to reject our current selves, and not the stupid, ignorant school kids we were back then.

Harry would take Voldemort over another second in this hell anytime. But it didn’t matter. When he had been dumped inside this cell, the cold laugher of the Death Eaters ringing in his ears, he had been screaming. He had cursed them and had punched and kicked the walls of the cell until his hands and feet had been bleeding. Hundreds of escape plans had been fabricated by his panicked mind, and none had worked. They had taken his wand, so he couldn’t even use his magic to try and free himself.
British Ministry of Magic, this is Undersecretary Percy Weasley speaking.
The snake hissed impatiently.
to know that her skills are indeed very impressive)
century
Thank you all for your patience and your comments (I'll answer them tomorrow I swear)!! I still can't believe how many people enjoy this silly piece, and at the same time, I can't believe how emotionally invested I am in these characters.
: lay off me woman, I already apologized
: don’t you dare sent that to anyone percy
: soul-draining, anxiety evoking, no sense of style
The snake on his chest leaned forward. Somehow her eyes expressed sympathy and Harry immediately felt less lonely. The young wizard was surprised by himself for a second – he hadn’t even been aware that he had been feeling lonely.
: you are blushing again, right?
: ???
: try me
“Remus, oh my God, oh God, your leg, oh my – don’t move! Wait, I’ll help you…”, the voice said, and Remus realized that waiting was actually a very good idea. He groaned and allowed his body to slowly relax. His eyes were already closed when he was lifted by a Levitation Charm and his last coherent thought revolved around the fact that he needed to tell someone – everyone, he needed to tell everyone that Harry was still alive.
: harry
Also shoutout to

He asked the snake and when she answered, she sounded quite angry herself.
: 10:32 am
: and it worked????? !!
“Mother. Why aren’t you in bed?” he asked carefully.
Prof. McGonagall was correct when she said that this will help strengthen house unity, or at least it could, so everyone please give this a chance :) :)
: that would destroy any chance u have left with Harry tbh
: they’re basically brothers omg
Millicent – AngryCat
: Harry, you are somehow in some way always in trouble
Things Which Worry Me
: total power move and he’ll be too confused and scared to say anything
: You were the victim of my fear and my cowardice, and none of all the things I just told you makes that okay. It’s an explanation, but it’s not an excuse. What I did to you was wrong and if I could go back, I would change it in a heartbeat.
: A Girlfriend = Life
: because it’s an important topic and Harry wants more people to pay attention to it
: so it’s canon now :D
: He just …
20s are over
: Merlin is believed to have had a level of maybe around 5.6
The snake swayed a little bit more strongly as if she was shaking her head. She was also laughing at him again. Harry wondered if he should feel a little bit offended by that but decided against it.
: srsly? Ur username contains a swear word, harry
: Black can’t do it (yet) cause batdad would think he’s making fun of him
: second of all I don't know if I am supposed to rebel against the casual possessiveness or be charmed by it
: and Minnie looks her into the eyes for the first time
Malfoy seemed to wince at his own name, but he agreed to call the potion master. Before he turned away, he hesitated for a second and looked at Dumbledore questioningly. “Professor, I think I felt a wave of powerful magic just a minute ago. Do you know what –“
: aww babe u are a 12/10 too

Harry thought about closing his eyes, but he was afraid of loosing the light around him. After so many … weeks? … spent in complete darkness, the sunlight seemed to burn his eyes. Still he continued to stare into the sky, unable to believe that he was out of the cell. He wasn’t sure if he was dead or still alive. If he was alive he had no idea how he had escaped. If he was dead… well, at the moment it troubled him less than it probably should have. But after spending so much time in despair and praying for everything to end, he allowed himself to relax.
And he sobbed with rage as he thought of Voldemort. He didn’t deserve all this shit. He didn’t deserve being marked by a power-hungry madman at the age of one. He didn’t deserve being part of that stupid prophecy. How was it fair that he had to fight for his life every single year? How was it fair of adults to rely on him to safe the world? And how could nobody understand that he. didn’t. want. this. He didn’t want to be famous. He didn’t want to either be treated like a hero or treated like an outcast. He simply wanted to go to school and live his life like everyone else. And Harry felt so damn angry that everyone seemed to think it was their right to demand this of him. It was his own fucking life, and sometimes he just wanted to leave and never look back. Let them all solve their problems without him. If Dumbledore was so powerful and all-knowing, why couldn’t he kill Voldemort? Why couldn’t they find another hero, someone who fit their image of what he should be like.
: emotionally? Yes. Physically? Kinda hungry, not gonna lie
The sudden bang of the front door being thrown shut and the portrait of Walburga Black coming alive as violently as always made them all sit up straighter. Anxious eyes stared at the door which connected the meeting room to the narrow hallway. The door flew open and a very angry looking Remus Lupin walked into the room. Some of the Order members had to control themselves not to grab their wands at the sight of the furious werewolf. Lupin stopped in front of the table, his eyes fixed on Dumbledore across the room.
: You were one of the first people I notice in the train. Mostly, because you looked exactly like I felt at home: trying to pretend to fit in, putting up a strong face, but you were obviously uncomfortable around other kids and everything from your haircut to the way you held yourself screamed ‘misfit’.
: oohhh  b u r n
: Minnie tho
: why
why did you trademark his name?)
: and another thing
: asfdsfj true
no not that
: come back
: mutt, I must tell you – and I can’t stress enough how much this hurts to say –
: wait aren’t we missing someone
“Sure,” said Draco. There was another silence, then, “What did Snape say anyway?”
“Yes, sir,” Harry grinned.
“Come to threaten us again, have you?” Uncle Vernon blustered.
Draco grinned. “Come on, let me show you the grounds.”
“Care of Magical Creatures and Divination.”
Harry smiled at him encouragingly. “You'll be great, don't worry. Oh, hello Professor.”
“True. Now come on, we need to wash up before dinner.”
Harry led Snape out in the deserted corridor to Ollie's portrait. Luckily he was in his frame. “
friend,” Draco corrected him.
Harry glanced at his relatives and grinned. “Yeah, you will. I have a feeling I'll be having a relaxing summer for once.”
Draco shrugged. “I'm more worried about Flint than the Gryffindors, to be honest.”
“I know,” Snape said, hefting the mirror. “Can you walk?”
Harry rolled his eyes and reached for the last parcel. “I'm sure I'm going to like yours just as much.”
Harry elbowed him. “I'm a Slytherin, you git!”
“What's wrong with him?” Gemma asked Harry.
Harry waved at his friends as he set off for the library, trying to ignore the way heads swivelled as he passed by. Getting this sorted out with Justin would hopefully lessen the cloud of suspicion hanging over Harry's head. At the very least, he couldn't make things any worse.
“These romantic chaps will be roaming the school today, delivering any and all Valentines you wish to send! And may I take the opportunity to now thank the forty-six people who have already sent me one so far today! But that's not all! Why not ask Professor Flitwick to teach you an Entrancing Enchantment? Or ask Professor Snape to brew you a Love Potion!”
Lockhart heard the commotion and looked up at Draco, before his eyes landed on Harry and he leapt to his feat. “It
Draco considered this. “That could work. Thanks. Want to teach me something new?”
“Please, Harry. I'm taking lots of pictures of Hogwarts for my dad, and I know he'd love a signed photo of Harry Potter,” Colin pleaded.
They came to a stop under the mouth of a wide pipe. Snape grabbed Harry's arm. “Hold on tight.
“He keeps a hair-smoothing tonic on his office desk. I saw it during detention,” Draco said quietly.
“As long as you don't throw it at me,” she said.
“McGonagall called me into her office last night and convinced me not to take Divination next year. She said something about it being too difficult to organise for me to take so many classes, and then informed me that the entire subject wouldn't be intellectually stimulating for me,” she replied quickly. “Too much guess work and not enough logical thinking in her opinion.”
“Dobby has stopped Harry Potter's mail, sir,” the elf said, and pulled a thick stack of letters from inside his pillowcase.
Draco sighed. “He did, yes. But he was acting odder than usual last night, so I commanded him to tell me what was wrong. He can't disobey a direct order from anyone in the family, you see, so he had to tell me what he'd done here. Naturally I went straight to Mother, and here we are.”
********
“Can you show me where my owl is, please?”
“You messed with that Bludger! Wait. Why do you want me to leave?”
“Excuse me, Professor?”
Harry filled the bath and added some bubble bath, which turned out to create sparkly bubbles that floated across the surface of the water. He got washed quickly and then swam around until the bubbles had all disappeared before finally climbing out. He wrapped a large fluffy towel around himself and padded into the closet, where the house-elves had evidently unpacked all his clothes.
“Or both of them!”
McGonagall was the first to break the silence. “Severus! You found him! How?”
“One... Two... Three!”
“Well yeah, because they keep bugging me about it.”
“What exactly did you do in your bath?” he asked finally.
Dumbledore looked up at her gravely. “It means that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened once more.”
At Hooch's whistle the teams soared into the air, where it quickly became obvious that the Slytherin team had vastly superior brooms. Harry flew a quick lap around the pitch, waving at his friends who were, as usual, easily identified by the small patch of red in the Slytherin stand. He'd just swung his broom around to focus on searching for the Snitch when a Bludger went rocketing by him. He shot forward, only for the Bludger to swing around and come back at him as it began to rain.
Bag finally full, Harry locked the door and pocketed the key. “Don't worry. It's nice that you don't think of me as some tragic orphan.”
“Then Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice,” Dobby said sadly.
Draco nodded. “
“Dobby!”
It was slow going at first, leaving the Chamber, but Harry's strength was quickly returning. By the time they walked out into a roughly hewn tunnel he felt almost back to normal, if a little tired. He gasped and stumbled as they turned a corner and saw a large shape lying across the tunnel.
Finally he came to a stop and tried to listen over his breathing and Draco's footsteps. “Shh!”
“Still think Lockhart's a genius, Hermione?” Draco called through the curtain.
Draco nodded. “Good luck, then.”
Harry stared at him as he left and shut the door quietly, before turning to the clothes and shrugging and picking up a pair of jeans.
“I will, sir.”
“We need Harry's broomstick, returned to full size. And some juice.”
Draco swallowed. “She was attacked.”
“What's that got to do with you? Voldemort wasn't around in your time, was he?”
“We didn't do anything!” Harry and Draco said in unison.
Half an hour later they were walking back down to the dungeons. It'd taken a while, but eventually a first year had been unable to answer the riddle. All that happened was he had to wait for five minutes until someone came along who could answer it.
,” Tom hissed.
“Good. Now, I do believe we have a feast to attend.”
Harry nodded sheepishly.
“How can we help you, Mr Potter?” Flitwick asked genially.
“Oh.” All that time spent saving up for the tape, and now he couldn't even use it.
“Didn't you write to her the other day?”
********
Even Herbology, which they shared with the Ravenclaws, was somewhat of an ordeal. While not as overt as the Gryffindors, they still made classes awkward. Harry and Draco had spent the start of the year working in a group with two Ravenclaw girls, Morag MacDougal and Padma Patil, and had gotten along fine with them. But the first lesson after Colin's attack, they'd suddenly found their table now contained Daphne and Tracey instead. Harry tried not to let it rankle, as both girls were good at Herbology, but it still upset him that people he'd liked were now avoiding him. Even Draco's threats of Petrification to anyone who annoyed him were now starting to sound slightly defensive.
Lockhart popped forward. “My office is closest, Headmaster.”
Harry sighed and reached for the diary, wishing he'd never asked Hermione for help.
Draco grimaced. “Yes. He claimed to have been coerced into it, but I've had my doubts for a while. What I learned tonight has pretty much made up my mind, though.”
Harry looked around him curiously as he tried to quash his rising panic. This must be Dumbledore's office. The walls were covered with portraits of previous heads of school, all of whom were currently sleeping in their frames. There were a number of strange instruments around the room, on tables and shelves, and Harry couldn't figure out what any of them might be for. The Sorting Hat was sitting on a shelf behind the desk, but it wasn't moving.
Pansy grinned. “Excellent. How are we going to get it to him?”
“Draco, it's fine. I'll be fine,” Harry assured him.
“But it would be fascinating to learn it from a magical perspective.”
********
“But why is he wearing my old suit?” Draco persisted.
“Well, I've written to my parents asking if they know anything about the last time it was opened, so that might help,” Draco said.
“Read it! Go on – read it!” he hissed as he thrust the letter into Harry's hands.
“Sorry,” Harry winced, realising how rude they'd been.
Hermione smiled normally. “What have you got?”
“That was a brilliant catch, Harry! We won, by the way,” Draco said.
Harry looked from Snape to Draco. “And your dad was one, too?”
Draco leaned forward with interest, but Mrs Malfoy was shaking her head. “They won't do any good, Harry. Your music device won't operate at the Manor, nor at Hogwarts. Too much magic in the atmosphere for Muggle technology to work.”
Harry and Draco shared a smile; she hadn't given the Dursleys much choice in the matter.
“No, I should have thought before I said something like that when your dad could hear me,” Harry replied.
The mood in the school had begun to lighten slightly as the weather slowly warmed. There had been no further attacks – something for which Lockhart took full credit – and the Mandrakes were close to being ready to harvest. Apart from Peeves, whose song “Oh Potter, you rotter” now came with a dance routine, most people had lessened in their suspicions of Harry. Padma even helped him with his shearing technique one Herbology lesson.
Draco took Harry's shrunken possessions out of his pocket and placed them on the bed, and pointed to the doors on one wall. “That's your bathroom through there, and that's the closet. A house-elf will be up later to unshrink your things and put them away for you. Now come on, I want to show you my room.”
Fudge drew himself up to his full but unimpressive height. “Lucius, you're coming to the Ministry for questioning. Aurors, if you would.”
“I told you what Snape said about her and whisky,” Harry warned.
“Yes,” said Draco uneasily.
Pansy ignored her as she passed the paper to Draco. “You better read this.”
“Yeah, she's adorable,” Draco said distractedly. He was sitting on Harry's bed, with his drawings scattered around him. “Harry, these are really good.”
“Morning,” said Harry quietly.
********
“Shouldn't we try to help her?” Harry whispered.
“On the count of three, try to disarm your partners! One... Two... Three!”
“Of course she does,” Draco scoffed, leaving Harry in no doubt over how stupid Draco found his question.
Even though this was the first he'd heard of Colin coming to visit him, Harry still felt a pang of guilt. Colin might be annoying, but he meant well.
“Just making sure.”
She pursed her lips. “I know I read about it in
“This'll be too easy,” Harry said as he stowed his Cloak back into his pocket.
Draco snorted behind them. “
“She is so cute,” Harry said with a fond smile.
They watched as she ran out of the hall. “Remind me to never get between her and a book,” Draco said.
An hour later, he had his backpack for the train packed and was just wondering if he could get Hedwig to carry some things for him, when Draco strolled into the room.
********
She scanned his face before giving a small nod and hugging Harry. “And Harry, I'm so glad you're all right. I'm sorry my husband's actions endangered you like that.”
He wasn't surprised when Draco ignored him and pulled the curtain back. He was, however, surprised to see Snape standing next to him.
Harry followed her in silence to an ugly gargoyle. “Sherbert lemon!” This was obviously a password, as her words caused the gargoyle to leap aside and the wall behind it to open onto a moving staircase. They stepped onto it and were carried up a narrow tower, like a spiral escalator. They stepped off at the top and McGonagall knocked on a door with a griffon-shaped door knocker.  It opened at her touch, and she curtly ordered Harry to wait there before she left.
“Just a few phrases. So I could speak to Olamide, maybe.”
Seeing Pansy beginning to glower at Hermione, Harry hurriedly asked Neville how his summer had gone. The rest of the compartment seemed content to let the subject drop, except for Hermione, who pulled out
“You're finally awake,” came Draco's sleepy drawl.
Mrs Malfoy smiled. “I don't need anything today. We're here for Harry. He needs a full wardrobe, as his existing one is unsuitable for him.”
“Okay then. Definitely replying tonight, in that case. Good night.”
A jolt of excitement went through Harry.
“What did you use my Cloak for?”
Harry looked back at the Malfoys. Draco looked as if he'd been trying to follow the conversation, while his mother was watching Harry with wide eyes. “Er, I take it Draco didn't tell you I speak Parseltongue, then?”
's sports section. He's visiting me on the first Hogsmeade weekend.”
Snape nodded before rising from his seat. “Very well. The potions will be ready in a minute.”
“We didn't see anyone at all until half the school arrived,” Harry said at once.
“Yeah?” Harry looked at him.
Draco shook his head. “I'm not repeating it. It wasn't pleasant, let's leave it at that.”
When Draco looked like he was going to argue further, Harry sat down on Hermione's bed and pulled Draco down with him. “It's a nice photo, just forget about it,” Harry said as he put his Walkman on the bed.
Harry and Draco remained under the Cloak until they got into Hermione's room. It was smaller than their own, with only three beds in it. Like the common room it was round and red.
“Prefect?” Harry looked up in surprise.
“Sir, you need to leave. The monster's a basilisk!”
“Wuss. Have you chosen your subjects?” Pansy asked.
“Why didn't you say something? Now I feel bad about what I sent her.”
To his surprise the wall slid open.
and the claims Lockhart had made in it. It was only when an excited Theo had spoken to him after class that Harry had learned what he'd missed.
Snape, McGonagall and Flitwick all turned to look at him.
“What about her?” Millicent asked warily.
Dumbledore bent over and eased the camera out of Colin's hands.
?” Millicent asked, looking up from brushing her cat.
“And apparently they take security a bit more seriously than Slytherin. Big deal.” Harry flopped onto his bed and sniffed his hands, pleased when he couldn't smell any trace of vinegar. He looked up when he heard a hoot, but it was Thoth and not Hedwig who flew into the room.
“What? No, not that,” Harry said impatiently. “Can't you hear that?”
As usual, they found Ollie sunning himself on his rock. He opened one eye lazily when he heard them approaching. “
“I wanted to borrow some hair pins. To practise picking locks without magic,” he elaborated when she looked at him oddly.
Dobby shook his head again. “Harry Potter must leave –”
And he had an irate owl glaring at him the entire time.
Harry ignored him and turned to the notice board and read the parchment.
Draco nodded happily. “It's in the centre of the grounds, too, so the Muggles can't see us flying. The Snitch and Bludgers are charmed so they don't go out of bounds.”
Harry knelt down in front of it, smoothing the instructions out on the floor beside him.
“You two are the absolute
Harry scowled. “Yeah, well, he got away with de-boning my arm, sir.”
“Ingenious,” murmured McGonagall. The red-robed men nodded, but the man in the suit frowned.
“Oh, no you don't! Time to get up!” Harry chirped.
Harry grinned and went back to his bed. Draco had just opened an anthology of historical figures so evil they were known to both wizards and Muggles, like Vlad the Impaler and Rasputin.
“What's this all about, Draco?” Theo demanded.
“If you'll just sign here, Mr Potter, I'll owl this to Gringotts to settle,” Ainsley pushed a piece of parchment over to Harry. He signed quickly, trying not to think of the price. Still, it wasn't everyday he bought an entire wardrobe, he thought, as he pocketed the long receipt.
“Remarkable,” Mr Malfoy said. He stared at Harry for a few seconds, before standing up. “Draco, I've meetings tomorrow that I must prepare for now.”
Gemma shook her head. “My dad's bald, so it doesn't count. Now, we have more important things to talk about.”
“Well Parselmouths are rare, there's probably a better chance of someone from another house finding out the real password than speaking Parseltongue.”
Neville climbed awkwardly onto the bench. “Ginny's been telling me a really weird story. Something about You-Know-Who's diary?”
“What are batteries?” Draco asked.
“Preposterous!” the suited man spluttered.
“Why did they expel you?” Harry asked.
“Yeah, but still...”
,” Harry advised it, and provided directions.
“Hooch says it's fine, Harry,” Gemma said reassuringly.
Harry stared at him in surprise. “That'd be great. Thank you, sir.”
Myrtle wailed and dove into a toilet, sending a geyser of water into the air. They quickly left the bathroom before they got wet, although Harry and Snape were already covered in muck from the Chamber.
The second years left as a group, but Harry and Draco quickly fell behind.
The rest of his response was cut off as Harry launched himself at him, hugging him fiercely. “Thank god you're here!”
“He what?” Draco asked loudly.
“Precisely. The dragon bone must be ground until it is the consistency of fine ash. Which is what you'll be doing now.”
“And she chose Elton John and David Bowie. Bet my aunt loved that.”
Harry nodded. He wanted nothing more than to collapse into bed. Snape frowned briefly at him, but swept out of the room without saying anything else. Not a minute later Draco burst through the door with the rest of the second years trailing after him.
,” he muttered. There was a disgusting squelching noise as the basilisk's eyes split open.
“Surely you know that you have one of the most intriguing histories of any wizard alive? You must be the only person to ever survive the Killing Curse,” Tom raked his eyes over Harry, as if the answer would present itself on his person. “I confess myself to be interested in how you managed to defeat the most powerful wizard ever when you were a mere infant.”
Harry grinned. “A holiday project? I like it.”
“Where have you been?” Draco demanded when he walked back in.
“Not in the slightest.”
. That doesn't mean I have a problem with Muggle-borns. My
Lockhart shook his sleeves back with a flourish. He pointed his wand at Harry's arm, and a second later Harry felt one of the weirdest sensations of his life. Before his eyes, his arm shrank in on itself, until it resembled nothing so much as a large, flesh coloured noodle. He dimly noticed Colin snapping more pictures before he passed out again.
They fell silent as they reached the top of the staircase. “Tiddlywinks,” said Hermione, then stepped through the now open portrait hole.
A cold ball of dread settled in Harry's stomach. “Right.”
“Yeah, not really looking forward to everyone thinking I'm the heir of Slytherin,” Harry muttered.
They all followed his gaze to the staff table, where Lockhart – now with a full head of hair again – was blithely reading what looked like fan mail, and nodded. Things could have been much worse.
“Ginny had your diary?”
Draco stopped in the process of pulling out some coins. “Can't bet on myself? Fuck that.”
Harry felt his hand grabbed, and then Lockhart was shaking it enthusiastically for the camera, telling Harry to smile. Harry scowled up at him and tried to back away, but Lockhart wasn't having any of it. When he let go of Harry's hand, he threw his arm around Harry's shoulders and pulled him in close.
,” Ollie added.
********
, especially when Hermione was still slightly peeved by the earlier talk of poison.
Snape nodded and flicked his wand at the blackboard, causing the instructions for the potion to appear. “It will never be a pleasant potion to ingest, but it shouldn't burn. Can you pick out which step may have been bungled to cause such an effect?”
“Gee, I wonder which bed is yours,” Draco drawled.
“Thanks for that image,” Adrian said.
“Yes, please!” Colin said eagerly.
“What do you think?” Blaise chuckled.
She led them into a laneway and stopped. “Harry, have you ever travelled by Apparition before?”
After taking the roll, Lockhart picked up Daphne's copy of
“You're going to listen to the Valentine I have for you,” he said angrily before clearing his throat and singing in a gravelly voice:
“I know how you feel. Sort of,” Theo said quietly.
“Damn, he's home,” Draco muttered.
Pansy leaned down the table. “Oi, Hawthorn! You done with that?”
“Because,” smirked Draco, “Harry and I are the only students who know the full story of what went on tonight. How would you like to be our official spokeswoman? You'll get to tell everyone.”
“Yeah. Not the easiest thing, but I'm getting better at teaching. And he's making progress with creating a writing system for it, so he doesn't have to just memorise everything now.”
Some of the tension left Snape, and he gave a small smile. “I'm pleased to hear it. One final matter, Mr Potter.”
As his father strode off, Draco turned to Harry. “Where to?”
“That paper's a useless rag,” Draco retorted angrily. “Now get out of
“But?”
Another house-elf popped up next to Mrs Malfoy. “We'll have the elf-made wine, with half-glasses for the boys.”
Harry shrugged. “I like animals. Muggle Studies would be boring, and the others sound hard.”
“Sorry for what?” Harry asked suspiciously.
“Okay, sure. Any particular reason you need her so badly?”
“Er, well, Draco's dad sent him a letter saying that you got blamed for it last time,” Harry said, wincing a bit.
“Sure. Want to go find Hermione?”
A muscle in Snape's jaw twitched at the name. “What was creepy?”
“I'd hardly call learning how to pick locks an innocent activity,” Pansy drawled.
Draco shook his head. “No, I'm sorry for getting cross when we got home. When you said I was a you-know-what.”
Draco cracked open one eye. “No, it's not. And it's certainly too early to be that cheerful.”
“Precisely.”
“Sure, see you then,” Harry said. Flint nodded and walked off to talk to Adrian and Miles.
“Oh, I'm sorry, were you hoping to snog?” Hermione asked, arching a brow at Draco. Harry watched as they stared at each other. To his surprise, Draco blushed and looked away first, and Hermione smiled oddly. Whatever had just happened, neither one seemed to want to tell Harry.
“Come for a walk?” he asked Harry.
“Typical,” Draco snorted.
Draco threw down his quill. “It probably is. Maybe I'll just have to memorise it better. How do you do it?”
“I do, yes.” Pansy preened. “What of it?”
Draco glared at him. “Yes, I do. Remember when I told you that you're hopeless when it comes to noticing when someone likes you? You haven't gotten any better.”
Draco patted him on his side as best he could with both arms pinned to his sides. “Same to you, you psycho prat. I'm sure this book will come in very useful in reminding me that I'm not nearly as scary as I'd like to be,” Draco said, but his smile betrayed his pleasure.
“What's Azkaban?”
“Tilly is bringing you your owl as soon as she returned, sir,” beamed the little elf.
,” he hissed. Draco rolled his eyes but remained silent.
“I just stopped by to perform the charm for your music player,” she said.
“Are you both packed?” Mrs Malfoy asked.
” To his surprise, a long black snake exploded out of his wand and landed heavily on the stage. It raised its head as it looked around at the crowd, which was quickly backing away.
“It will slow us down, Mione. It’s bad enough that we can’t use any bloody magic, but if we start out without any muggle money as well…”
: ^^^
get away from my gf smh
: literally the only good thing percy has ever done is ditch that gf of his and date oliver instead
: mary chrayon
: YOU ARE ALL CANCELLED
Next to him the grass shifted again, and then he could feel the snake coil up on his chest. She stared at him as if she expected him to suddenly jump up. He bit his lip and sighed.
: Sirius … Black.
: and if you ever text me that face again I’ll disown you
Ron – CannonBALLS
: uhhhh
it’s decided
: that includes his cousin
: someone could have gotten hurt filius
: but… we can still be the bestes of bros, right?
: and why do u even have them
Harry mimed sticking a finger down his throat, making Theo and Pansy burst into muffled laughter.
“Poor chap must be delirious, he clearly doesn't know what he's saying,” Lockhart said to the gathered crowd.
Snape snorted. “Unfortunately for you, Lockhart has requested to take the detention himself. As the injured party, I can hardly deny him.”
“It's the principle of the thing,” Draco sniffed.
********
Fred snorted. “That's nothing.”
“Er, yeah, I was,” Harry replied.
“No!” Daphne squealed and grabbed onto Tracey's arm. Tracey frowned at her and pulled her arm free.
At the end of the hallway Tilly opened the last door and handed Harry the bundle of meat. “Can Tilly do anything else, sir?”
“Off to bed boys. I won't have you sleeping in tomorrow.”
“I guess,” Harry shrugged.
Draco brightened. “That's not true. You're always teaching Theo and Tracey about Muggle stuff.”
“Harry?”
“Dobby told you? But I thought he wanted me to stay here?”
Harry blinked and looked around the shower stall, trying to remember how he'd gotten there. He felt tired, and the warm steam was doing nothing to wake him up. A glance at his wrinkled hands told him he'd been standing under the water for some time, so he got out and dried off.
Harry shook it slowly. “I did try to explain things to your friends.”
“Happy birthday to me,” he muttered as he stared at the glowing numbers.
“Tracey, have you seen Daphne?”
“So you think it's Potter then, Ernie?” asked a blonde girl.
They followed him into the infirmary, where Pomfrey was bending over a Ravenclaw girl. Harry barely registered their presence as he and Draco rushed over to the next bed. Hermione was lying on it, unmoving, staring wide-eyed up at the ceiling. Draco put his hand on her arm as Harry stood next to him. He felt a painful jolt in his stomach as he stared down at her.
Draco sighed. “Potter, you're the Boy-Who-Lived. Why do you think Fudge and those Aurors came to the school? Because it would've been a disaster for the Ministry if you'd actually died.”
“I think we need to go rescue Hermione again tonight,” he said to Draco, who nodded.
Harry paused, then laid his head on Draco's shoulder. “We had lunch while we were waiting for the potion to finish. And he... He said I can go talk to him again on Boxing Day. About Mum.”
“Like he needs an excuse to get into a fight with Wood,” Miles snorted.
“I'm fine,” Harry said.
“What does he mean, Severus?” McGonagall asked, frowning from Draco to Snape.
“So are you in? Minimum one Galleon per bet, as many bets as you want, so long as you don't bet on yourself,” Flint said briskly.
Harry huffed angrily. “I've already told you that's not happening. Now tell me who!”
“Harry Potter!” the elf squeaked happily. “Dobby has heard many things about Harry Potter! Dobby has been wanting to meet you for a long time, sir.”
Harry jerked slightly. “Sorry.”
Pansy followed Harry's gaze and growled. “Can we poison him now?” she asked Harry.
he got on the team, moron!” Harry burst out.
Dobby let the pudding fall to the floor where the plate shattered loudly. The elf disappeared with a sharp crack. There were screams from the dining room, and Uncle Vernon burst into the kitchen to find it covered with cream and bits of crockery. Harry was standing in the middle of the room with his arms still outstretched from trying to save the dessert.
,” Harry replied.
.” He didn't actually know if that was true or not, but he didn't think the Dursleys would be very pleased if their orderly garden was overrun with them.
Harry sighed and rolled over, careful not to jostle his injured arm.
They inched past the line of witches, most of whom were clutching copies of Lockhart's books. Over to one side was a large, garishly coloured display of the books, and they gratefully picked up what they needed.
Harry followed the elf as she led the way down the corridor, down the stairs and through the foyer. As they walked down the corridor where the Malfoys had their studies, Harry noticed that Mr Malfoy's study had light coming from under the door, and resolved to be extra quiet on his return trip. He really didn't want to see the man alone at this time of night.
Harry considered this. “No. I... I feel stronger, actually.”
“Music? Her favourite singers were Elton John and David Bowie.”
Snape paused and looked out over the room. “I trust you all understand the seriousness of the situation we are now in. Anyone found flouting the new rules will be harshly punished. Thus far, there have been no Slytherins attacked, and I would very much like to keep it that way. If any one of you has any information about the attacks, inform a member of staff. Finally, if any of you become upset or anxious, I reiterate that the Prefects will be able to contact me. Prefects, if you would see me for a moment.”
“Yes, I remember. Ugh, I'll go with Pomfrey then, Lockhart could make anyone drink, poor thing,” Gemma said in disgust. Then she glared up and down the table. “But if anyone bets on McGonagall and wins, I will
“And?”
They jumped a little when Draco left abruptly, slamming the door on his way out.
Harry rested Hedwig's cage on his trunk as he hugged Draco goodbye. “Thank you,” he whispered to Narcissa over Draco's shoulder. She gave him a small smile in return.
“Exactly. Terence is no longer here to run the betting pool, so I'm doing it this year.”
“Most of Gryffindor does,” Hermione agreed quietly.
“Wait here,” Tracey told him, before ducking inside the door marked
Snape stared at him. “That is remarkable,” he said finally.
“And now allow me to introduce my assistant here, Professor Snape. He tells me he has a little experience in this area, and has kindly agreed to join me with a brief demonstration before we get started. But don't you worry, I'll leave your Potions master in one piece!”
Out in the corridor they set off quickly for the dungeons.
“Well, those pixies were in a full body-bind, and we thought we might break the wand if we tried to get it back,” Draco said.
Mrs Malfoy shrunk both trunks and pocketed them. “Have you got everything?”
“Because the monster is said to be controllable only by the heir of Slytherin,” Hermione said quietly.
Draco ignored his father. “Dobby, I command you to tell me what you know about this.”
“Break it up there, gents,” he said, and then pulled the two men apart. Both of them were dishevelled; Mr Malfoy had a cut over one eye, and Mr Weasley had a split lip. Mr Malfoy was still holding the book he'd grabbed out of the cauldron.
“Great.” Harry had had no plans to tell Mr Malfoy anything about Dobby's activities, and held out his hand. When Dobby stared at it, Harry walked forward and took the elf's little hand in his. This must be what Hagrid feels like, he thought as he shook Dobby's hand. When he let go, Dobby stared at his hand for a moment, his eyes filling with tears. “Er, Dobby? Are you alright?”
The wall opened onto a crowded common room. A group of older students had a large piece of parchment tacked to the notice board and seemed to be taking money from the students clustered around them. Harry and Draco wandered over curiously.
“Sure.”
Tom's reply came quickly.
“Got some final tests after breakfast, but I should be,” Harry said, spooning his porridge in quickly as Pomfrey came bustling over.
“I'm sure we could use Hagrid's dog,” chimed in McGonagall.
As his friends laughed, Harry looked down at his schedule and groaned. “We have double History of Magic first thing tomorrow. How is anyone supposed to stay awake for that?”
“Of course. How many good wizards can speak Parseltongue?” replied a chubby boy. His friends murmured in agreement, and he continued, “And you saw what was written on the wall.
Flitwick came racing out of his classroom. “Stop this at once!” he shouted, and let out a loud bang with his wand. When Draco and Ron broke apart and got to their feet, he glared up at them. “Ten points from both of you for fighting! All of you get to class right now!”
“Shopping,” Draco said happily.
“Draco's just over reacting, Harry,” Hagrid said, patting Draco on the arm.
“Oh yeah?” Harry reached up and quickly messed up Draco's hair. Draco howled and shoved him back, and they continued to jostle each other behind Mrs Malfoy's back.
“So what have you been doing since we got back?” Harry asked as he pulled himself away.
Classes that day were a complete write off, as all anyone could talk about was the prospect of finally finding out who had been attacking everyone. The betting in the Slytherin common room had reached fever pitch. Oddly enough, Harry and Draco were no longer favourites, as most people figured they wouldn't have attacked Hermione. Lockhart was now the front runner, given the inappropriately cheery mood he'd maintained throughout the entire ordeal. Harry became disgusted with the whole thing, and retreated to his bed, planning on telling Tom about the impending revelation.
Goyle – Muffin #2
: I think we should end that call. Um. Sorry about that.
Here's a chapter! Regarding user names, pls refer to the guide in chapter 1.
Other people. How long had it been that he had seen another person, heard another voice? Harry didn’t remember. There was no way for him to tell how much time had passed since he’d been thrown into this hole. A few days? Weeks? He didn’t remember eating anything while being here, and his mouth was painfully dry because of the lack of water. How long could a human survive without water? Surely only a few days? So he couldn’t have been here for a very long time, could he? But maybe the Death Eaters had cast some kind of spell, which kept him alive even without any food.
Pomfrey: random appointments
: can u blame me, I get to judge all those people and laugh when they embarrass themselves
: Welcome to the family
, like making brooms fly and letting food appear from seemingly thin air. But he had never thought about how magic itself looked like, or if it would even be possible to see it.

Ginny stood up together with the other two. “Me too. Harry and I might not be together anymore, but obviously he can’t be trusted to be left alone.” They had tried dating for a few weeks last year at school, but had quickly decided that it felt too much like kissing your sibling to be entirely comfortable. Harry was still one of her best friends though, so there was no way the others would go to see him without her.
: the fact that we are not inviting Harry for Christmas this year is your fault, Lucius
: go and cause mayhem, littlest of disaster gays
: I mean.... it's true but you shouldn't say it
: where were we?
: and ok, consider this: im also really, really bad at dating
: do we have an extra seat free next Sunday dinner?
: if they help u, Theo, I guess they can’t be bad
: necromancy is also u know…
. How it wanted to raise him up in the sky and how it wanted to hurt the people who hurt him. His magic was part of himself, but it also had a will on its own. And slowly but surely Harry got the feeling that the blue part of his power was pissed off. It was angry at Voldemort and his Death Eaters, it was angry at the Dursleys, it was angry at Snape and it was angry at Dumbledore. Harry could see how it wanted to find those who had hurt him and hurt them back. It scared him. How could this angry power be part of himself? How could such… hatred be something he was supposed to trust?
He turned towards Molly. “Molly, Arthur, I know this will be difficult for you as you both love Harry as if he was your own son. But it is absolutely necessary that neither your son Ron nor Miss Granger nor any other friend of Harry hears about this. They can’t know about him disappearing. Their worry and immediate search for their friend would alert Voldemort and we can’t risk that. Do you understand?”
: now that ykw is gone, sev can do what he really wants
: ugh
: couldn’t you have waited until AFTER the winter holidays
: I literally just said good bye to u guys five minutes ago and you were only boyfriends??
: I am concern

GRYFFS

: ur boyfriend carries a pet devil’s snare in his pocket like that’s something normal people do
: WHY am I the only one u guys still call by the last name
: what exactly is the definition of a “furry”?
: and why wasn't I invited
: and then I learned that harry potter had almost died bc he thought he was the most qualified person in the castle to stop The Heist Of The Century
. The snake sounded quite satisfied.
“No.”, interrupted the werewolf the older wizard. “My first priority is to find Harry and to protect him. I wouldn’t be able to live with myself knowing he’s out there all alone while I’m not doing everything I can to help him.” His voice was cold and didn’t leave any room for discussions. Dumbledore seemed to recognize this as well, and he nodded slowly.
: RIP Neville
: why are u making me the responsible Head Student???
that makes sense, you could have guessed that
Dear Cissa, dear Lucius
: merry chrischtmas
: are they in pain?
: mcG: “bisexuals exist, Karen”
: he’ll leave st mungo's next weekend
: well except remus and severus obvs
: Oh thank Merlin, I –
Did you have a nice weekend, dear?
: Wallory, Diane
: harry, what do you think?
Snape nodded, keeping his head high as they walked quickly towards the large forest. He had never shared the other’s fear of the creatures which lived hidden in the shadows of the trees, not even when he had still been a student himself. He was confident in his ability to defend himself, and had spent many nights wandering through the forest, collecting rare herbs for his potions. Except for full moon nights, of course. Those he spent behind locked doors, but that was nobody’s business. Snape couldn’t help but shiver as he entered the forest this evening, though, with the other wizard by his side. Somehow the forest seemed to hold his breath, as if every magical creature inhabiting it was waiting for a storm to come.
: Harry
: that’s the most terrifying statement u ever made, weasely
Millicent – AngryCat
Well, well, well…

: oh please
“Well if we are already awake at such an awful hour, we might as well discuss the letter Lucius has sent to me this morning.” she said, her voice dangerously calm.
: ….????
: that’s my secret
: oh shit

: and yes, that makes it better, by a lot actually
: doesn’t mean you should
: our dear mother
: and breathing fire. I feel like that’s important to remember

: thank you

The other twin snorted. “A Malfoy buying his way onto the team. How original.”
“You became Voldemort?” Harry whispered.
THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED. ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE.
As the men all looked at the diary, Harry looked at Dobby. The elf was staring at Harry intently, pointing at the diary, then Mr Malfoy, and then hitting himself in the head.
“Come to the kitchens and then go for a fly?” Harry asked. “I don't feel like being glared at all through breakfast.”
“No, that's not going to do anything. He didn't break any school rules, apparently.”
“Let me through, I can fix this in a jiffy!” Lockhart said jovially.
“I'm beginning to think someone doesn't want me playing Quidditch at all,” Harry replied. “Last year Quirrell jinxed my broom, now a Bludger decides I'm the only player on the pitch...”
“Because, Harry Potter, I find your history to be incredibly interesting.”
Snape swept out of the classroom into the now thankfully empty corridor, leaving Harry and Draco to jog to keep up with him. Once again, he led them to his office and left them standing before his desk as he sat down and surveyed them.
Shortly afterwards Harry was surveying his new clothes and thinking over the events of the day.
“Of course, sir.”
Harry gave Hedwig one last pat before the elf disappeared with her, then settled down to read it.
Hagrid waved a massive hand. “Don't worry 'bout it. I need to remember that Draco isn't his dad.”
“What'd I do?”
” Harry yelled in desperation.
“Mr Potter, you are lucky to be alive. Do you need to go to the hospital wing?” Dumbledore asked.
“Right,” Harry said weakly.
Harry slipped his Walkman into his pocket and held up his Invisibility Cloak. “Ready?”
“Yeah, it's hilarious the way everyone's scared of me,” Harry snapped.
Mrs Malfoy just smiled and walked out, shutting the door quietly. Harry immediately dived onto his bed and rummaged around until he found his headphones. He quickly pressed play and grinned when the music started as normal, before returning to his shopping.
At four o'clock Hagrid walked into the hall. “Good to see yer all right,” he said, smiling down at them.
read his books?” Harry retorted. “They sound like a load of bullshit to me.”
“There's a legend that Salazar Slytherin built a chamber in Hogwarts, which the other three founders had no knowledge about. He'd left the school after a disagreement about letting in Muggle-born students, and supposedly left a monster in the chamber, which would purge the school of Muggle-borns.”
“What do you mean?”
“Emotional stress?”
“I'm not? I mean, good,” Harry said in confusion.
“And again!” Lockhart called. “One... Two... Three!”
Hermione sighed. “Wait until Draco comes back.”
“Good. Want to visit Ollie?” Harry didn't know what Draco's problem was this morning, but he figured speaking Parseltongue to Ollie might cheer him up.
” he quickly added, laughing nervously. He watched the snake to make sure it wasn't going to attack Ron, before smiling at the Hufflepuff boy. Instead of the relief he expected to see, he was faced with a terrified confusion.
They walked out onto the pitch to cheering from the Slytherins, although it was nearly drowned out by booing from the other houses. As the teams lined up Harry looked the opposing Seeker up and down. Harry agreed with Flint's assessment of him; more of a Seeker's build than McLaggen, but he didn't look all that happy to be on the team.
“Could I please have some hot chocolate? If it's not too much bother?”
mum. She died to protect me.”
“How'd you get in here, anyway?” Pansy asked.
Harry gave a small smile. “Yes sir.”
Snape gave a dismissive glance at the other end of the stage. “If you can disarm Mr Malfoy you can do the same to Mr Weasley.”
“When young Harry here – stay still!” he hissed at the squirming Harry and cleared his throat. “As I was saying. When Harry walked into Flourish and Blotts, he only wanted to buy my autobiography,
“Halloween today. Big feast tonight,” Vince said happily to Greg.
Harry folded his parchment into a plane, threw it back in Theo's general direction and returned to his nap.
The next morning, Harry was woken up by someone calling his name. He reached out blindly for his glasses and put them on, blinking down at the house-elf by his bed before he remembered where he was.
“Yes,” Harry said shortly.
Harry looked at Snape's face, but his expression was so carefully blank, he might as well have been looking at a statue. Harry grinned weakly. “Don't worry, sir, I believe you. That you've changed, I mean. I'm not about to run out of here screaming.”
Draco groaned and fell back into the pillows. “Is this your new paranoia for the year? What
“I'm not very hungry, sir,” Harry said at once.
“Library,” Draco said.
“Thank you, Gilderoy,” Dumbledore said and led them through. Harry caught sight of Hermione's pale face as they went past. They were followed by Lockhart, Snape and McGonagall. When they entered the dark office, Harry caught sight of a few of Lockhart's portraits ducking out of frame, with their hair in curlers.
“You don't remember? I had you write your own death notice on the wall before you came down here. The school should be in a state of panic by now.” Tom smiled. “Through the diary, I've taken strength from both Ginny and you, allowing me to leave the pages at long last. I imagine you have less than half an hour before you lose consciousness. Within the hour, you'll be dead and I'll be fully corporeal.”

: what kind of question is that??
Me @ActualPlot: where the HECK did YOU come from???
: wait I fucked the last one up
: ask you about your day??
: why is there a but
Immediately he felt white blazing anger taking over his body. He almost screamed as tears started to run down his cheeks. He experienced it all again, all those moments when he had felt wronged. He saw the Dursleys ignoring him, hitting him, abusing him. He had been a mere child, completely helpless! It wasn’t right that they had hurt him for so many years. He was allowed to feel enraged. He was allowed to bloody scream his rage at anybody who was responsible for his miserable childhood. His anger took a turn. Harry shook as the face of Dumbledore rose in his mind. How could he turn a blind eye on his situation at his so called home? All because some blood wards which Harry had never gotten proof were even there. And obviously it hadn’t been safe there for him at all. Not only had he been abused by the same people who should have been his family, but he had been attacked by Dementors and had been abducted by Death Eaters. How was staying at Hogwarts or the Burrow for the summer less safe? It didn’t make any sense and Dumbledore never bothered to explain anything to him! He only wanted Harry to do as he said, without asking any fucking questions!
: pls reset, I don’t like this
: congrats, harry. Im really happy for you.
: fucking hell draco u could’ve just said that and be done
: did she already have her morning tea at that point

: u don’t need to announce urself, girl, we all know ur here
: wow how dare u talk about my boyfriend like that
: though she would never admit that
Narcissa hold him closely for some more minutes before pulling out a letter from one of the pockets of her dressing gown. She glared at it for a second and Draco could once again understand why so many people feared his mother. It was not the same cold and calculated power like his father’s that was shining behind her eyes. It was the ruthless and hot fury of a mother that would do anything to protect her son. It was one of the reasons why Draco had never seen it as a sign of weakness that he felt safe in his mother’s arms.
: THAT’S NOT WHAT I MEANT
: its just a  t h o u g h t, draco
WAIT TILL OUR SON HEARS ABOUT THIS
: tell the mutt to visit that horrible godson of his

: but regarding the “what to study bit”
: as it should be
: do u sometimes think about the fact that in normal families, that sentence would be “ur child made my child cry”??
Dumbledore nodded. He noticed that Snape called it ‘our home’, including Mr. Malfoy in his sentiment. Obviously the arrangement that had been made was expected to last.
: PERCY FUCKING WON THAT ASSHOLE
: wait what do you mean
: so I offered him asylum with us
: YOU DID WHAT
: we believe in you, dad
No, Michael, he isn’t. I’m sure he’ll be in soon.

: my next class starts in ten minutes, go away
Dear Lady Smith,
: let the kids have their fun draco
, Harry repeated sarcastically. He tugged at his hair, leaving it in even more of a mess than its normal state. Just like his life. Find his mate? What the – why did stuff like this always happen to him?
: on my way
: exactly
: Excuse you im one of the responsible ones
: tony u sleep with 5 blankets and 3 layered warming charms in winter stop playing games smh
: aw come on H why do u always do this

Parvati – Thefirstone
Harry felt a thrill of anticipation at the words of the animal, but also a surge of fear. He had never heard of someone just … letting the magic go loose. That was why they were using their wands: to control the magic and to focus it. Would he loose the control over his power if he set it free? Maybe even loose it completely?
LISTEN UP Y’ALL if you give me a fucking miniature dragon which moves and breathes fire and shit you better believe im gonna adopt it. That’s my tiny dragon son now. Mine. I love him and he can do no wrong.
This is Percy Weasley, Undersecretary of the Minister speaking.
: i mean fake moody kinda did try to kill me BUT I can acknowledge that I learned quite a lot in his lesson
The blond man turned around and this time his smile was warm and honest. Quickly he stepped inside the small house again, closing the door and leaving the night sky behind him.
: FUCXK
: okay. I just… I really don’t want to hurt him anymore. I don’t want to hurt anyone anymore
Draco – BlondBitch
: amazing weasel noticed the absence of his human gf when his actual gf (aka food) was right there
: but anyway, its not my fault
: ignore him
: Well, but as a muggleborn that wouldn’t have made such a difference for you, would it? Why would muggleborns care about Slytherins?
I guess you just have to write yourself then
: He’d go insane. Some of them are read by Sirius and Remus instead.
: yes to the first part
: hey every1 discuss: huffs is the most perverse house
: fuck this is sappy
: Invitation to Radio Special
century maybe
Harry sat up a little bit straighter.
: any specific area?
: I need u to give statements against The People
: why would you be interested in the manuscripts anyway, you suck at potions
: and she just….

: thanks ron

: this is me telling you two that I have a boyfriend
There’s a disturbing lack of memes in this chapter and a worrying amount of actual plot (how???), but it’s still one of my favorite chapters so far, so I hope you all will like it too. ^^ Also, I think it migth be the longest chap so far.
: and yea me neither
: in first year she set snape on fire, in second she ordered us to steal expensive potion ingredients and brew an illegal potion in a girls bathroom, in third she illegally used a time turner and broke draco’s nose, in fourth year she imprisoned a witch in a jar for several weeks, in fifth year she co-founded an illegal defense club, deliberately put a teacher in great danger and left the school grounds to fight in a battle against a dark lord
: why would you do this to me
: if you want to make a bonfire, why not use just… firewood?
: it sure is
: right????!!! We gonna throw her a huge party when she gets her licence
: can u just… write me a list of things I shouldn’t mention???
: good

: 7th floor after dinner?
: N O
: im surrounded by gryffs, you need to work with me, theo
: but im honoured to be your sister
Once again thank you for all the love and support!!
The phoenix continued singing quietly as if he wanted to reassure Harry that he wasn’t alone. But he never looked at him directly, and Harry started to get an uneasy feeling about the whole situation. He wished he had a mirror to check on his appearance because he really didn’t
: maybe it was a doppelganger
: bye bye muggles
: (even tho we are texting)
: I mean I heard fudge say something along these lines once so its not like shes wrong

Lumos
All the best,

: the lads look happy. good for them.
: you said a bad word
: pretty awful yes
: it was very funny
Apparating directly onto the small staircase that led to the front door of Grimmauld Place 12 was difficult on good days. Remus was not having a good day and he groaned in pain as he slammed down onto the stairs with a rather horrifying crunch of his bones. Breathing shakily for a few seconds he proceeded to ignore the blinding pain in his left leg and pushed himself up, raising his left arm to open the door. The first time he felt nothing but thin air between his fingers and the wizard had to lie down for a few more seconds to gather the strength to reach up again. On the second try he managed to grab the door knob and his breath turned into pained gasps as he used his whole body weight to turn the knob and open the door. The old door creaked as it opened and Remus dazedly thought that he had never heard something as beautiful as that sound.
: I did NOT sign up for this
Harry thought about that for a little bit. He had been hurt badly, yes. But he had been hurt before, hadn’t he? So why was he still feeling like he was floating in the air, somewhere between taking his first breath and never breathing again? Why was this time so much more difficult?
: 1 ask him yourself
: and by dragon I mean your dick
Hermione – Tiredofyourshit
"I'll answer your comments on Thursday" I say
: Hey, what –
well excuse me if I think free will is kinda great and slavery is kinda awful
: MY LITTLE BROTHER
Severus,
: ah yes
: mAgiCIan ??
. I just thought it was hilarious and needed to be included! :D
: I didn’t need to read the whole disaster back story
: in the decoy chat
language, severus
: you’re welcome
: noiii
: How far did u apparate
: you aren’t even trying to be subtle, are you
: we both just rly like you
: but it would have been the EASIEST option
wow that’s brutal
: maybe the muggles never realized?
Hey, so, did you meet
: *en
: yes
: Maybe? My mail, I mean both letters and emails, are looked through by my dads first. So maybe I get requests, but this is the first time someone wanted to talk to me about something else than myself, so I guess that’s why it was forwarded to me.
: seriously wtf potter
: hey btw who’s staying here over winter hols?
okay okay
: this... explains so much
: Have a shitty, abusive father? Stay positive, just yeet your local batdad at him and BOOM! U just got adopted!!!
: just ask Potter
this is easily one of the most stupid things I was ever forced to do
Parvati – Thefirstone
: same
: mood
: rare potion ingredients, dark chocolate with chili, firewhiskey, dueling, hiking (but only in areas where he will meet a maximum of 0 people)
: mom they’re bullying me
: best moment of my life
= Lucius
I as well do not know exactly what albus has done, so could someone please explain?
: but u could’ve just walked over there ON THE FLOOR, you know, LIKE A NORMAL PERSON
rry: What? NO!
: I acknowledge your apology
They also reminded me of the fact that maybe I should explain how the fuck 15yo Harry somehow defeated Voldemort (and horcurxes exist in this AU - I know, I was surprised to). I had no plan for this, when I started this story, but I somehow came up with an explanation which (imo) makes actual sense. There will be references to what happened in the story, but I thought I would give you the whole explanation here in the notes, so the story makes more sense.
: asbdlajf what do you mean ‘yes’ ????
: can we pls talk about literally anything but this
*throws this at your feet and crawls back into the cave of misery*
Floo Emergency Services. Works with every random fireplace (or just an Incendio to a stack of wood), no actual floo connection needed and the service is 24/7. Misuse is fined quite heavily.
: but… it was good, right? Do you think he’ll believe me at least a bit?
Hermione found her voice first. She looked at Molly with wet eyes and the older witch felt a stab of pain as she was forced to lie to the girl or, well, young woman she considered her daughter. “Is he well? Where did you find him? I want – we want to see him!”
: sometimes it just be like that
: what
: how does he always know??
Lavender – Stardust
: the DISRESPECT
: u good?
m y c h i l d
: omg is this what I think it is
Draco shrugged, a gesture that was entirely undignified for a Malfoy. “It’s not the nightmares, if you worry about that. It’s… I can still feel it. The magic.” He shuddered but it wasn’t fear that he was feeling. It was a wild kind of joy as if he was waiting for something amazing and beautiful to happen. Which would have been less disturbing if he had any idea
: I’m going home btw
: wouldn’t u like to know weather boy
: I can’t sense sarcasm through these messages, so I will cautiously thank you
: bye bye muggles
: yeah anyway, pansy, what did u mean by that
: kinda still want that pizza tho
: and apparently oliver has been highkey pining like the whole time, so no …. No whatever with flint
Pansy – GossipQueen
: what do you want ginny
: not that this isn’t highly amusing
Now, I’ve just noticed that my assistant has scheduled lunch for me with Fudge. Since it’s Monday, can I assume that I can cancel the lunch?
: I walked in on Flint and Oliver having (hate?) sex once. I have a pet turtle. Lion King is the best Disney movie.
: at one point – we had already drunken quite a lot – severus called the woman in the movie a “damn furry”
: ditto. Congrats on completing ur story arch
: and he has the same Very Valid Concerns
: and u kinda trust him a lot bc he saved you bout 100 times just last week but u still can’t stand him bc he’s a dick
: did it work?
: tough shit, albus
: no I remember what she’s talking about
: I am incredibly disappointed
: not only are all the apples the same
: mike eats literally anything
: ur boyfriend carries a pet devil’s snare in his pocket like that’s something normal people do

it. It had been a beautiful shade of blue, like the deep endless ocean during the night. It had twirled around him, recognizing him. And it had invited him to share its rage. He had never before felt so alive than when he had allowed the magic to rush through his body and his mind. Looking back, it had been foolish, dangerously stupid to allow foreign magic to possess him like that. But it had felt so right and he still couldn’t regret it. Instead he missed the sensation of feeling it in every part of his body. The faint taste of it that still seemed to linger in the air around him wasn’t enough to satisfy him.
: cute?
: u sure u can manage that? ur a bit sensitive ain’t ya?
“Learning to pick locks. And I walked, Blaise. Apparently it's easy enough for boys who aren't there to snog the girls.”
He closed the door, went to collapse onto his bed and only just stopped himself from crying out loud. There was a house-elf sitting on it. It was wearing a filthy pillowcase, not at all like the clean liveried pillowcases the Hogwarts elves wore. Looking at its green eyes, Harry realised he hadn't been imagining things at the hedge that morning.
,” Harry hissed over his shoulder.
“Because that makes all the difference,” Draco muttered.
Dobby threw Hedwig a dirty look, which she ignored as she watched Harry unwrap the meat. He fed her a large portion, before giving a piece to Thoth. “Good girl,” he murmured. “Dobby, why don't you want me to return to Hogwarts?”
Snape's lips twitched. “Indeed. Nevertheless, the three of you will have detention tomorrow night.”
“Alright then. Take a hold of my hand, that's right, now don't let go until we arrive.”
“Good to know I don't need to say
“Welcome back everyone,” Gemma said brightly as she made her way down the table. “I have to take care of the first years, but the password is 'Runespoor fangs'.”
Harry walked back through the dungeons thinking of what he'd ask Snape about his mother. “Phineas Nigellus,” he said at the entrance. He didn't see Draco in the common room with the other second years, so made his way to the dorm. It was quiet, but the curtains on Draco's bed were closed.
” Harry leapt off his bed and made his way to the door. Surely he was hallucinating.
“I don't think we will,” Draco smirked. “Now run along, before we have you Petrified.”
“Uh huh, sure. Come on, let's go tell the others about this,” Pansy smiled up at the glowering Millicent.
“Thank you. Tell her that I'm alright, and I'll see her when school ends,” Draco added.
“Hi, Daphne,” Harry said with amusement.
A flash of annoyance crossed Lockhart's face before he grinned at Theo. “Ah, Mr Nott, don't be so dismissive! These little rascals gave the Gryffindors quite a bit of trouble the other day. But I think you lot could do a bit better, don't you?”
Dobby shrunk in on himself a little. “Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby. Dobby only meant to help.”
Harry nodded. “Tom was a memory, sir. He'd preserved himself in the diary somehow. During the year, Ginny Weasley then myself wrote in the diary. He used it to gain strength from us, and at the same time, possessed us. It's us who have been opening the Chamber. I'm the reason Hermione was hurt.”
Harry raised his eyebrows. “And the trial's so soon?”
“That coward handed in his resignation the second he found out that Harry had been taken into the Chamber,” Millicent said in disgust.
“What about your family?” Harry asked.
“What does this mean, Albus?” McGonagall asked slowly.
Mrs Malfoy was still tense, but smiled down at him. “Thank you. And no, it wasn't true. While I do have a lot of friends in the Ministry, I would be arrested if I raised my wand against the Muggles, except for self-defence. But I didn't feel the need to tell them that.”
Harry twisted around to see Neville standing behind him. “Me too. Sit down,” Harry said, shooing Daphne, Greg and Vince down a seat.
Harry looked away and watched Fawkes wriggling on the perch.
Snape's eyes darted between them. “Come and see.”
“No, don't, I'm cold,” Draco said, and tightened his hold.
“For adventure stories? Sure. For textbooks? Not so much.”
“Please, Hermione,” Harry begged. “Anything you think is better than what I've got: nothing.”
Hermione waved him away and hugged Draco. “Don't worry about it. What happened in the Chamber?”
After breakfast on Sunday, Harry decided he'd have another go at learning to pick locks, just in case he needed to next summer. He retrieved the instructions and pins from his trunk and stared at them in frustration. He'd bent the pins horribly and doubted they'd be any good.
“I didn't – yes, okay, I'll pay that. But you don't understand what it's been like in Gryffindor lately.”
Draco shook his head as he stood up. “She came over and told me she's spending time with the Weasley girl. Apparently they've become friendly this past week.”
“Because one should always try to make giant spiders happy,” Draco muttered.
When the elf disappeared, Harry quickly put on his dressing gown and slippers, and picked up his letters.
“I have not yet made up my mind. But in any case, it is not something the student body should be aware of,” Snape replied.
In the end Harry took Burbage, while Draco went for Kettleburn. “You'd want to get drunk if you were missing an arm, wouldn't you.”
“Yes. You need to make a formal complaint about Lockhart. He de-boned your entire arm!” Draco's eyes flashed. “Against your consent, too.”
“Free period,” Harry replied. “Why do you have a dead rooster with you?”
“What's so funny?” Neville asked.
“Ten points to Slytherin,” Snape said, before moving off to separate Greg and Vince, who were wrestling on the floor.
Harry looked at him sharply. “You think Dumbledore's going to screw over Hagrid?”
“Not Snape.”
“Perhaps by sleeping the night before, instead of wandering around the castle after curfew,” Snape said pointedly before moving down the table.
“Draco?”
“I need to get some money,” Harry said.
Ainsley turned his eyes on Harry and gave him a thorough once over. “Ah, yes, I can see what you mean, ma'am. I think we'll be able to get him properly sorted out today.”
“All the same, we can never tell anyone about that,” Draco said.
“Kinda hard when he's ignoring me.”
“Yes, but he also had a run in with Malfoy earlier in the term. And
“Come in,” Harry said, sitting up and moving his books over.
“I think he was pretty clear,” Theo snapped.
“I thought you said you'd booked the pitch, Flint,” Adrian muttered as some of the Gryffindors flew down towards them.
Draco was sitting against his pillows, and closed the curtain again when Harry sat at the foot of the bed. He was already in his pyjamas, and had sheets of parchment scattered on the bed.
you.”
Harry laughed as Ollie slithered out of his frame and turned to Snape, who was waiting impatiently. “Sorry, sir. He hadn't heard about Mrs Norris. He's gone off to laugh at her."
“Fine! Live a life full of awful poetry and stalker midgets and see if I care!” Draco sped up and moved to the front of the group.
Harry couldn't take it. He opened his eyes a crack.
“But I heard...”
“I'll think about it,” Ginny replied.
