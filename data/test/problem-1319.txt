Harry panicked.  Any dare Pansy Parkinson would assign him was bound to be humiliating, “Uh . . . truth.”
“Draco, we have to talk about this,” Harry pulled his arm away from his face and leaned over him.  His grey eyes glittering with unshed tears.  “You’re not making sense,” Harry said, struggling to understand what he was saying.  “We’re married!  I love you!  Why would you be trying to not get attached to me?”
“Master Draco is saying that the last three times Dilly is being in here.” Dilly scrunched up her wrinkled face and put her hands on her hips. “Master Draco is needing to eat, or he is falling ill!”
“To torture me?” Draco’s lips twisted into a wry expression.  “I don’t know,” he continued. “You said you were hot.”
Seeing Draco looking soft and thoroughly kissed, Harry couldn’t resist leaning in for another quick kiss.  Draco’s lips followed his as Harry drew back, and a soft groan fell from his lips.  “Hold that thought, Baby,” Harry murmured.  He took a step back and swiftly tucked his shirt back in.
Draco let go of the bedcovers and brought one hand up to hold the back of Harry’s neck and the other to press against his lower back.  He kissed back furiously as he pulled Harry to him tightly.  He broke away from their kiss to gasp, “Harry!”  Harry took the opportunity to leave a trail of kisses across his cheek.  He stopped to tug his earlobe between his teeth and then began nibbling on that spot behind his ear that never failed to turn Draco to mush.  “Harry!  Merlin!  I . . . I want . . . Merlin, I need you!” Draco groaned.  His hand started to frantically push at Harry’s pajamas.
Draco noticeably blanched, before setting his facial features back into an expressionless mask.  “Bulstrode?  Related to Millie?” he asked.
“Just give us another minute.  He just regained consciousness,” Healer Wilcox, waved vaguely over to the side of the room where Draco was waiting with his arms wrapped tightly around himself.
“That’s an awfully big name for a tiny girl.  I think I’ll call her Al!  First of all, Al, you’re gonna love dragons.  They are the coolest.  And wait until you meet Uncle Charlie, he’s the coolest too!” Teddy focused all of his attention on the baby.  Atria looked up at him solemnly, seemingly listening to every word.
Draco looked down and Harry followed his gaze, watching as Draco wrapped his hand around both their cocks.  The pressure on his cock was such a relief Harry sagged against the wall.  Draco moved both his legs between Harry’s.  Harry lifted his leg to wrap behind Draco’s leg, securing the other man to him.  Draco’s hand had started to squeeze and pull both dicks.  Pleasure filled every part of Harry’s body, as he thrust into Draco’s hand.  He was close, so very close.
“No, Granger,” Draco mocked. “Funnily enough we weren’t interested in souvenirs of his time in our home.”
“Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter, what is happening here?” Professor Thropwaite said as he rushed to their desk.  “What was that blue light?  Did either of you touch anything?”
After what could have been hours or minutes, Uilliam came over to Harry.  “Our scans are all normal, Harry.  We haven’t been able to reverse engineer all of the potions yet, Draco was by far our best at that, but when we do, that may give us more information.”
Draco glowered back at him, “I was joking about that, you prat!  Nothing happened last night.  After you stripped off, you passed out on me and snored all night.”  Draco sat up and put as much distance between them as was comfortable.
Harry took his index finger and gently traced the curves of Draco’s lips.  He paused with his finger resting on Draco’s lower lip.  “Yes, what?  What do you want me to do?”
“Yes, what, baby?” Harry asked huskily, dropping his mouth until he was barely touching Draco’s mouth.  “What is it you want?”
Harry walked out automatically, his brain to busy trying to process his new reality.  Before he knew it they were standing in front of the door to Transfiguration.  They found seats on a bench at the back and pulled out their parchment and quills.  Professor McGonagall gave them a small nod, and then continued on with her lecture.
After the first time, it had become a regular thing. Whenever Harry studied in the library he seemed to come across Malfoy, and Malfoy would always make room for him at his table.  Harry had even asked Malfoy the occasional question about their homework and Malfoy had been helpful and hadn’t made fun of Harry even once.
The light at the windows faded and the room slowly darkened, but the two men entwined on the couch noticed none of this. Hours passed as hands gently stroked all exposed skin, lips caressed and teased each other, fingers tenderly carded through tousled hair, and promises of love were whispered. They didn’t even hear the little elf, who popped in to check on them and then left again with a beaming smile filling her face.
Harry finally found his voice.  Clearly, the little elf would be very careful with his daughter.  “Sure, Hilly.  You can put her to bed.  Do you know where her fresh nappies are?”
Harry had been halfheartedly looking through a Quidditch magazine, when a slight movement from the hospital bed caught his eye.  He threw down the magazine and leaned closer, afraid his eyes were playing tricks on him.
Harry reached down and gave his own cock a squeeze, willing himself not to come just from the decadent site in front of him.  Then he used his hands to spread Draco’s ass cheeks and lowered his mouth.  “Harr-aarghh!” Draco cried out at the first touch of Harry’s warm wet tongue.  “Aaaah!  Aaargh!” he cried out as Harry’s tongue swept across his pucker.  “Oh, please!  Oh, please!” Draco turned to mindless begging as Harry stiffened his tongue and pushed it inside him.  Draco babbled a stream of nonsense as Harry thoroughly fucked him with his tongue.
Harry’s reply was lost as the room was suddenly inundated with visitors.  “Where’s my newest granddaughter,” Molly asked as she and Arthur entered.
“What in Salazar’s name are you saying, Dilly?” Draco shouted as visions of the green-eyed, messy-haired man filled his head. He and Potter had reached a peace treaty, of sorts. Potter had testified in both his and his mother’s favor after the war. And Draco had apologized to Potter in person, resolutely not letting himself get distracted by the intensity in Potter’s eyes.
“You know he won’t mind, Draco, he just said he likes boys too.” Pansy smirked and ignored Harry’s comment.”
When he saw the circle of students sitting on the floor, the dread made its way through his alcohol-soaked brain.  “No,” he whispered in horror.
After their friends had left, Madam Pomfrey brought them each a pair of pajamas.  She then placed a screen between them, so that they could have privacy when they changed but remain in close proximity.  The next minutes were awkward for Harry.  Each rustle of cloth from the other side of the screen had him imagining Malfoy removing another piece of clothing, until he was thinking about Malfoy naked and starting to get an unwelcome hard-on.  He rushed to finish changing his own clothes and practically jumped into his bed so he could pile the blankets over his groin and disguise his arousal.
“Happy Christmas, Harry,” he says softly, closing the distance between their lips as the fairy lights silhouette them from behind.
Potter stomps through the grass and snow, sparse as it is now that it hasn’t fallen in a few days and the good weather has been doing its best to keep it at bay. There’s a part of Draco that hopes it’ll snow again soon, fond as he is of the usual Christmas traditions and the picturesque way the large trees and sweeping hills frame the castle grounds, everything covered in white like a postcard.
“I’ll bet,” Draco says, his voice heavy with meaning. “I bet you’ll enjoy it even more Potter, if you
He’s moving before he realizes his feet are carrying him, and in a burst of mean satisfaction, rears back and slaps Blaise hard across the face.
“Hangingbone’s back,” Draco glances back towards the front of the room. He’s alarmed to find she’s staring straight at him. She looks away and he looks back at Harry, whose eyes furrow even more. “You caught that, right? Something’s off. I don’t like it.”
"We've been doing much worse as wizards. We cut the tentacles off of murtlaps and then turn around and feed it to them when we need a bit of good luck."
"Yes, someone please talk about anything, there’s bound to be much more interesting topics of conversation than whether Potter will have to spend one night without a warm body in his bed." Draco sniffs, doing his best to look bored as he gives the crazy straw a try. It takes a bit of effort and he has to inhale for much longer than seems convenient before the drink makes its way to his mouth and down his throat. It's nice. Very citrusy.
“Your magic will continue to fluctuate if you two do nothing!” Her frizzy hair bounces around her head like a brown halo as she scolds them. “It doesn’t matter if your actions are good or bad, the need for gratification will build and build until you satisfy it! It’s that or satisfy each other!”
Turning on his feet, Draco’s smart shoes click clack the pavement as he follows Hangingbone off the courtyard and through a side entrance, back into the castle. Consumed by thoughts of Potter and his stubborn temper, it’s not until they pass both the door to Hangingbone’s classroom with the emblem of a holiday pudding, and her office on the first floor, that Draco notices she’s leading him across the empty foyer to take the staircase that leads down to the harbor, and not the dungeons.
Maybe he won’t go on Saturday. It’s the night before Potter’s birthday, so it’s unlikely that he’d be there. On the other hand, what if he is there and Draco is not— would he take it personally? He certainly wouldn’t come looking for him, Draco scowls.
One of the doors opens on the left. Cool air billows out across the floor as an elf hops down, a thick red scarf around his neck. He bows.
"I suppose you think it’s nowhere as bad as trying to use me as your arm piece. Like my friendship is some kind of badge of honor!"
What Draco doesn’t expect, entirely too conscious of Potter standing at his side.  is the next paragraph. The one not only encouraging his newfound relationship with Potter, but instructing him to take advantage of the situation. What an advantageous union their friendship could be for the Malfoy name, and the use it could be to them were it to develop naturally into something more.
He doesn’t know where it came from. Nothing like so extreme as what happened at Scrivenshaft’s has happened since, and he’d allowed himself to think the few hours of relief meant whatever curse, hex,
Sunday is spent in bed. It’s an opportunity for Draco to catch up on his sleep, to watch the dust mites dance in the beams of sunlight coming in through his window. He thumbs through the books on his nightstand but they don’t catch his interest, tries parting his hair several different ways in the mirror, picks out several of his pristine robes to be sent to the tailor for minor infractions.
A sharp pain traveled up the back of Harry's leg, and he whirled to find Malfoy much closer than before, hands over his ears, eyes wide with panic. His lips were moving frantically, but Harry couldn't make out the words.
Stretching his arm, Ernie attempts to pass the cap, dropping it as another coughing fit overtakes him. Potter kneels and picks it up instead, shaking it free of snow as he wordlessly hands it to him.
Like now. He descended the stairs, his pants long abandoned on the floor of Harry’s bedroom. He was careful to avoid the trick step that sent one back at the top of the stairs to begin the process once more, light on his feet.
Ernie McMillan gently knocks his shoulder against Draco’s, rousing him from his reverie. “Alright, Malfoy?” He nods and Ernie nods back, satisfied. He flashes Draco a conspiratorial grin. “Listen to them go on, then.” He indicates the others. “Three more weeks and they’re scheduling shag appointments.”
have to say, the Mercury model is not the most dutiful and professional quill on the wizarding market. It is an absolute menace. It yanks the tail end of Draco’s g’s and un-dots
He gives the words a few moments to hover between them for dramatic effect. When the beat ends and Potter still looks as if he’s trying to solve a very difficult math problem, Draco runs a flustered hand through his hair. Potter’s eyes follow the movement with what appears to be great interest. Draco watches as he licks his lips. Potter’s cupid bow is extremely well-defined.
“Haah, stop,” Draco guides his hips back down to the bed. His fingers slide down, down, until they splay over Potter’s bulge. He strokes it gingerly, hears Potter’s hiss in the darkness as he tightens his grip. “Can I touch you?” Draco whispers.
Malfoy had very white teeth. Harry imagines he used all sorts of whitening and freshening charms morning to evening to keep them so pristine. If he were to kiss him now, to slide his own tongue alongside Malfoy's, into the wet heat of his waiting mouth, Harry thinks the experience would be pleasant. He'd be able to swallow Malfoy's moans as they tasted each other, feel his body tremble in all the places where their bodies aligned. He'd brush his fingers along the line of Malfoy's throat, tight as a bow. Drift over his Adam's apple just so to feel his pulse jump as Harry's fingers threaded into the soft hair at the nape of Malfoy's neck, angling him to deepen the kiss, to sink into--
A brief glimpse of something like recognition flits across Potter’s face, quickly replaced by annoyance. “I think that’s more your thing, Malfoy.”
“You’ve had some questions about my Sorting Hat, as well you should,” Hangingbone says. “It’s quite the magical object. A hat that doesn’t judge character based on thoughts, but on emotions. And why shouldn’t it? Emotions are much more genuine.”
"But tonight?" Draco emphasizes. He knows perfectly well after his last talk with Parkinson, there's no way her turning up is a coincidence. Who did she have to bribe to get the invite and why the hell hadn't it worked for Draco after pressing into Headland?
“Mr. Malfoy,” Hangingbone greets him with a frown. It’s like she doesn’t even have the energy to disguise her displeasure, and Draco’s unsure if the source stems from his sudden appearance in her classroom or her having to be there herself.
"Hello, Pansy." Potter has stopped addressing Pansy by her last name quite a while back, but he was still as cautious as ever around her. It seemed to be a mutual understanding between them that only served to confuse Draco.
"What it’s not about is a guilty conscious." Draco hates repeating himself, but if ever there was an occasion, this warrants it. "These dinners are about leaving my house!" He stabs a finger in the direction of the Manor. "Being able to walk ten feet without seeing an auror, or house elf for that matter, tracking me with their bulbous eyes." He widens his own as he says it, fingers miming binoculars to emphasize
Potter leans in, lowering his voice. “Don’t you remember what Hermione said? We have to spend time together to offset the curse. Are you sure it’s a good idea to bugger off to McMillan’s dorm after.. Everything?” There’s definitely an odd lilt at the end of his words that wasn’t there before.
"Three weeks of randomly assigned dinners, yet we always end up at the same table. I wrote to the Ministry after the second time because I thought there had to be some kind of mistake."
Items secured, Draco grips his wrapping paper (a tasteful roll of deep green with a hint of silver sparkle), a roll of ribbon, and heads for Gryffindor Tower.
The blood seems to drain completely from his body. Draco feels hallow. Has to swallow thickly. “Your. Your sister.. she taught..”
Weasley scowls and takes them without saying thank you, but that’s to be expected. He doesn’t expect everyone to have the manners he does.
Hours later, after a late-night snack and another round in which Draco straddled Harry and rode things out to great success, they feel across Harry's bed, sleepy and sated. The post-orgasmic bubble they share has lead to the usual vulnerabilities, but there's only one question Draco has had on his mind for weeks now.
"I'll explain to them later, I promise." Potter buries his face in the crook of Draco's neck, running a hand down his arm to find his hand, lacing their fingers together. "But come with me."
“I’m trying,” Potter says. His fingers drum rhythmically on the arms of the chair. “It’s just a bit, cold?” He screws his face up in thought. “I feel like I’m in a mausoleum.”
I can't believe I did it. Wow. This was an experience. Thank you to everyone who came with me. Thank you for reading, commenting, kudos-ing, or just wishing me good luck in the back of your mind. Thanks to the mods for running this fest, and I hope everyone had a wonderful holiday. Enjoy all the entries!! They're seriously amazing.
Theo invites himself along, and the three of them spend the afternoon in the orchard, where Neville shows him a potion formula that clears the yellow mildew from their trunks, instantly brightening the apples that are weighing down the branches. Draco climbs -- he's always adored climbing, sitting up in the trees to survey all that he could see -- and at the end of the day sends Longbottom home with an entire burlap sack of gold, silver, fuji, and red delicious. Even a few strips of bark, so that Longbottom can show a friend interested in examining the magical properties within.
“Let me try something,” he says, instead. Draco grabs the needle and thread from Weasley’s slackened hands. Fingers the needle with a moment’s consideration but doesn’t give himself too much time to deliberate before he spears Weasley’s behind.
“Goodnight, Malfoy,” Granger echoes. Her eyes dart from Potter back to him. She bites her lip as if she wants to say something but thinks better of it, linking her arm though Weasley’s sister’s and heading for the girls dorm.
“Corrupt, the whole lot of ‘em!” Another person shouts, and a noise of agreement goes around the crowd, drowning out the few good samaritans who try to drag their loved ones away, reminding them that it’s Christmas.
"It's a shame these suppers are dry," Romilda pouts, swirling the ice in her glass. "Think how fun it would be if we could get a bit sloshed."
Hangingbone confessed to everything. They’d sent a Patronus to McGonagall, who in turn met them halfway wrapped in her tartan dressing gown, complete with matching hair bonnet. Together, the three of them levitated the former Muggle Studies professor up to the Headmistress’ office. Aurors were summoned to take their statements and administer veritaserum. Flickwick had also been sent for to corroborate Hangingbone’s story and review the spell work placed on the hat. Once this was done, they were able to lift the curse off of Harry and Draco with next to no damage — at this point, they’d grown so used to balancing each other’s moods that it didn’t feel much different to their usual state.
Despite the fact that Potter had returned his want via the Malfoy family barrister, it hadn’t felt the same once it was back in his hands. He’d refused to use it and Narcissa refused to let him be without. There were weeks of furious silence before one of them finally broke. The connections his mother had had to exploit in order for Draco to obtain his new wand stretched quite thin. There was an air of finality about it that made it very clear those channels would not be available to the Malfoy name again.
Rising to his feet, Draco picks up Parvati’s gift from the pile of presents he’s finished wrapping. There’s one he has to deliver to Ravenclaw for Lovegood, along with a strongly worded letter to pass along to Padma Patil, and Ernie’s tickets, but the rest are all Slytherin. In front of the fire, he finds Parvati’s stocking and drops her gift inside. When he turns around again, Potter is right behind him.
The rest of the evening goes relatively well. Blaise's mouth goes a mile a minute, somehow carrying conversations with Potter, Granger and Chang individually. At one point he and Potter burst into laughter, standing close as Draco watches their mouths move. He tells himself he's happy to see it, but the relief he feels when they separate and Potter's eyes meet his, is a lot more apparent.
"Rather presumptuous of you, don’t you think? Not that I’m surprised." Draco says with no real bite. He’s actually rather stunned and needs a moment to process the information. Perhaps pinpoint the exact moment in Potter’s timeline where they’d gone from drawing their wands on each other to a friendly negotiation of terms. And how would these new terms affect his wanking privileges? "I suppose I’m not entirely opposed to it," Draco hedges after a moment’s deliberation, "Whatever not being enemies would make us."
Draco waits until he's moved down the table to wipe his forehead. "Remember what I said, Potter? About the House elves watching me?"
“You,” He grunts, swiping the purple monstrosity from her hand, “are spending too much time with Pansy.”
"I don’t think she’s looking to start a family, Pans, though the Goldstein name wouldn’t be a terrible match. Maybe she just wants a thrill. You know how that goes.”
"I thought you said you were observant," Draco says. He's certainly observant. Potter's moved closer. They're touching from hip to knee. "We're the ambitious ones, remember? I'm the kind to do whatever I have to to get what I want... if I want it bad enough."
Harry comes to a stop and Draco stops besides him. Stars are already winking into existence, faint in the orange-blue haze as the sun disappears beyond the horizon. Harry laughs.
"Really, Draco!" Pansy shouts, tossing the Lovegoods’ livelihood over the side of the bed. "You’re making me work harder than someone I actually have a chance at shagging. Yet not one mention of our green-eyed, bed-headed savior?"
"Hmm." Harry nods, giving it some thought. He still has bandages on his fingers but they look a lot better today. There are less now and the skin where the ones that have been removed are gone, looks smooth and new, if a little shiny.
From the floor rose a high-pitched, earsplitting wail. Harry stumbled, had barely enough time to clap his hands over his ears before it rose in volume, blurring his vision around the edges.
“But it’s worth a working quill, isn’t it?” Parvati procures one from her bag, a gaudy, purple affair that promises sweet nothings and sneezing fits as she waves it under his nose. “Yours is a mess and I
“Wise, that Lovegood.” Draco makes a mental note to check on her when the next time he has a chance. He’s already bought her present, but had thought to send it anonymously, lest she get the impression that he cares about her.
"Because it's temporary?" Potter makes a show of hands his wand off to the elf, who places it inside a small box, emitting a squeaky, "Thank you, Harry Potter". He turns back to Draco. "Don't you think you'd have heard if magical folk were handing over their wands and never getting them back?"
“Don’t bother.” Draco starts as Ernie draws up beside him, shaking the slush from his boots. “I’ve already tried asking how they work. She won’t let anyone get near the stuff.” Ernie points, and Draco follows his gaze to the long, green cords that disappear into a supply shed.
"Darling," she says with restraint, "Auror Abernathy’s kindly offered to accompany me in visiting your Aunt Andromeda, once he returns from seeing you off."
They walk through the gardens in silence, coming to a small cropping of shrieking irises. They're still young, just buds. Their horns have yet to open, so the sound emanating from them is more of a hum.
“You know what I mean, Harry,” is Hermione’s curt reply. She picks up one of the many books she’s brought out to the lake with her, flipping the pages until she finds the passages she’s bookmarked. “It’s all right here:
"Well now I know I haven't been sent on some kind of goose chase." Blaise offers a tight smile before he looks at their surroundings with interest. "If you'd told me back at Hogwarts you and I would be spending our Saturday night standing in the middle of a field digging brambles out of trousers, I'd have thought it would
"My point," Pansy continues, "is that if The Ministry’s in charge, they can’t allow anything to happen to you under their watch. No matter how demonstrative you are, it’ll be a consequence free environment. Use it to your advantage."
“It was, a bit.” Draco instantly realizes his mistake. Blaise’s eyes flash, and in that moment the target of his vitriol switches.
On his other side Draco feels, rather than hears, Potter chuckle. “Sorry,” he waves his hand to dismiss the action. His smile looks a little tight around the edges. “Just imagining Ernie taking a ball to the face.”
Potter shakes his head as if he can read Draco’s mind, “Your house elves did it all, didn’t they? Don’t tell Hermione, even if they liked it. She expects you to be crap. It might be fun to throw her off.”
"It's a friendly gesture. Don't tell me chocolate suddenly poses a moral dilemma for you. I may develop a complex."
“How do you know all that?” Draco abruptly throws the curtain aside, feeling his pulse quicken. Three sets of eyes dart to his face in various states of exasperation. Parvati indeed has her bag slung over her shoulder, arms crossed. Pansy leans against the wall nearest him worrying a nail, and Theo looks relatively unfazed, although his brown hair looks as if he's run his fingers through it more than a few times. Draco focuses expectantly on him, his eyes probing Theo to continue.
Potter grabs his arm and pulls him back to down. “I don’t know what that was about!” he hisses. “It just happened!”
"I have to go." He pushes through the door to the stairs and melts into the flow of witches and wizards moving up and down the steps. Potter doesn't follow.
“We were the only two who weren’t...” Potter says, his eyes darting back and forth as the words sink in.
“Oh fuck,” Potter begins to match Draco’s strokes, rolling his hips with growing urgency as Draco twists his wrists on the downstroke, rubs his thumb over the slit. He feels daring and wonton in this space of theirs, Potter’s moans spurring him on. Draco scoots back on his knees and buries his nose in the curls at the base of Potter’s cock, presses the flat of his tongue to the fine trail of hair that leads to his belly button.
Relieved, Draco allows the others to continue discussing their plans and attempts to slip back to the relative safety of his essay. He’s determined to avoid the topic of Christmas altogether and Parvati’s hapless reminder leaves something sour in his chest.
“Professor?” Draco wrinkles his nose. He’s maybe been down here twice since first year, as there’s not much purpose for visiting. Every September, first years are brought across the water, led by Hagrid’s on the small fleet of boats. It’s more for first impression than anything else — the rest of the year the boats bob sadly in the water, warded off from students and unused, unless Filch or one of the Professors needs to sort out the creatures within the lake. It’s cool and dark down there, the moldy wet smell of twine and sea water filling Draco’s nostrils.
Draco sat back up. “But more to the point — if being nice to each other and being naughty doesn’t work, then we have to think of an activity that combines them.”
In the silence that follows, Draco brushes himself off, cursing Abernathy and his faulty aim under his breath while checking the back of his trousers. He’s conscious of Lovegood watching him intently, craning her neck like an exotic bird, her colorful earrings large and garish. There’s a beat, and then another, and in between each of her curious looks, Draco feels the tension in his shoulders building, waiting to see who will speak first. "I assume you’re here for supper."
“Hey.” Potter shoots him a shy smile before pulling his glass close to fill it with pumpkin juice. He’s wearing a maroon jumper today that somehow makes his bottle-green eyes pop even more in contrast, and Draco feels his heart skip. He can remember staring into them last night, rolling his hips again and again to feel Potter’s cock pressed against his own.
There are several loud thuds, a rush of something white hot as Draco looks down to find his finger digging into Potter’s chest,
cake. Potter already invades his dreams. He’s universally loved and arguably the most famous wizard in Europe, if not the world. Draco would never be able to escape from him even if he wanted to. It makes it doubly impossible if they’ve got some kind of… magical
Draco swallows. Then does one of the bravest things he’s ever done thus far and lowers himself to the ground, scooting next to Potter. “I think the hat might have ... done something to us.”
“If this is where I’m supposed to start kissing your arse because we’ve managed to go five minutes without socking each other, you’re going to leave quite disappointed.”
He’s caught up to Potter now, who’s also doing laps, and it’s not long before he matches his speed to Draco, keeping pace as they round another bend. Potter’s slight and his movements are quick and powerful — it’s what what him made a good seeker and makes him unnaturally adept to anything even tangentially related to flying. But this is on the ground, and Draco’s legs are longer, his sense of balance slightly better. They’re neck to neck, other skaters hurrying out of their way until Draco pulls ahead, turns on his heel so that he’s facing Potter and sticks a foot out directly in Potter’s path.
"Ministry escorts? You mean an Auror detail?" Weasley glances around the bakery, obviously hoping to catch sight of another prat in red robes. Like they’re impossible to spot. He turns back to Draco with suspicion. "I don’t see anyone here, Malfoy."
"I'll bet. Anything else I should know about? I'd have gone through the usual channels if I thought these dinners were more than a simple how-do."
Draco hurriedly stuffs the letter into his coat pocket with the ring, lengthening his strides as he heads back towards the castle.
Potter stares, apparently at a loss for words. "I do mind," he says after a moment. "I just think they made an honest mistake, that's all."
“Hello..” says Draco, slowly. He offers the nuts with a raised eyebrow. A little girl races past them on the sidewalk, chasing a small crup who’s gotten off its leash.
"That's not true," Lovegood shakes her head. "Harry's been looking forward to it every week. He told me so. I knew you kissed before Blaise told me."
With the door closed, Draco moves to stand with Potter on the threshold. There are four king sized four poster beds, each with their velvet hangings drawn back and the sheets clean and pressed. He, Blaise, Theo, and Greg had been the only boys who’d chosen to come back after the war, but mid-way through the first part of term, Greg had buckled under the pressure. The loss of Crabbe had hit him especially hard, and unlike Draco, who’d had a year to make some sort of peace with it during the castle’s reconstruction, the wounds for Greg were still fresh and bleeding.
Draco shakes his head. “You’re a sadist. Pansy’s much more a Witch Weekly person.” She’s also a terrible gossip. There’s no way she hasn’t not only read the article, but geminio’d several copies for the rest of their housemates to peruse.
Draco’s eyes widen. “Was that today?? I completely forgot!” The Beard Party is an annual Slytherin tradition, a modified holiday classic, as no Slytherin would be caught dead in anything so horrid as an ugly Christmas jumper. Draco’s preferred style of facial hair is particularly distinguished, if he says so himself.
“It’s the man of the hour!” Blaise’s booming voice seems to fill the room. He vaults over one of the small end tables to stand in front of Draco, his arms spread. There’s confetti caught in his long beard.
“Ha, ha.” Draco turns to the game, reeling back as the Hufflepuff seeker, Margaret Willison, pulls the end of her broom up to avoid the crowd by a hair’s breadth.
Slowly, Draco unfurls his fingers and rises onto his knees, making sure Potter’s eyes are locked with his when he lifts his wet hand to his mouth.
"You think so highly of yourself." Potter’s eyes have narrowed now, his breath coming quick as he glares at Draco. "Do you honestly think I have nothing better to do than watch your every move? That you just garner so much attention, no one can help but focus on you whenever you’re in the room?"
An owl prods its sharp little talons against the glass outside Draco's window on the Friday before his next dinner. It was unusual, as most of the owls sent to the manor followed the procedure of dropping their items to the front door where a house elf would receive them properly. The fact that the owl came personally to Draco meant that it was under special instruction and was quite secretive.
As they descend the curved staircase, Draco clears his throat. “Shouldn’t you go clear things up with your friends? Let them know you’re alright?”
Professor Hangingbone waves her hands, one flicking fluffy snow from a stone table as the other beckons them. She’s dressed in multiple layers as usual, her long face nearly disappearing into the cowl of her jumper and long coat under her robes.
Potter shakes his head. “I think this is different, Ron. Malfoy’s not the one actually issuing a command, so there’s no intent behind it. And it doesn’t seem like we can use it on each other…
He's pointing towards the fountain, where a small set of tall circular tables have been set up. The house elves present are serving finger foods from small trays held above their heads, despite Granger's protest. Next to her stands–
“Don’t make fun of me, I— for gods sake Weasley, here.” Draco reaches across Harry and threads the needle himself, his moments swift as he ties one end of the string off and shoves them back at him.
on the other side. I believe we’ve reached the part of the story where someone rolls the stone away.”
"You don't believe that." He can feel Potter's warm breath on his face now, the way their torso brush when Draco tries not to sway. He's too close. "It matters to me," Potter whispers, looking up at Draco from under his lashes.
In response, Potter sucks harder, groaning around Draco's cock as he takes him deeper into his throat. He pulls off to run the flat of his tongue along the underside, to tongue at his slit. Draco sways on his feet, a throaty moan escaping him as he steadies himself against the wall with his free hand.
Draco doesn’t know what any of it means and his stomach is squirming too much to process it. He nods dumbly, concentrates on his cutting charm as he snips a perfectly square piece of paper to wrap his the record in.
The crash is unavoidable, but what Draco doesn’t count on is Potter grabbing onto his coat as he goes down, the two of them hitting the ice hard and sliding until they skid to a stop at the edge of a snow bank. Draco’s taken the brunt of the fall under Potter’s additional weight, and he lying beneath him, he can hear the way they both gulp lungfuls of air, chests rising and falling.
“Only until Hangingbone returns.” Hermione glares at them. “She’ll be back before we leave for the holidays. Ron and I will help if we can, but I won’t hesitate to say something if it puts your lives in danger.”
Weasley closed his eyes. The red hat and his red hair make for a horrible effect and Draco’s tempted to stop looking when the cap swells, a warm glow appearing to emanate from within. Along the brim of white fur, shining gold letters begin to appear. The pom at the end of the hat stands erect, and when the words NICE appeared, it pops like a Christmas cracker, filling the air with confetti and a fragrant peppermint smell.
Malfoy bites his lip. He hasn’t thought this far. Their moods seem to mirror each other accurately enough, but the things they’ve done involuntary seem a bit trickier.
“They wouldn’t let us in,” Pansy starts immediately, her eyes roving his face. Draco thinks she might be checking to make sure everything is still where it belongs. “Hangingbone sent us all off immediately after they too you and he-who-shall-not-be-sorted to the infirmary.”
“Seamus and Dean are still in Hogsmeade, Neville’s gone to his Gram’s for the weekend, and Ron’s gone off with Hermione, I think.” Draco didn’t think it was possible for Potter’s face to get redder, but somehow he accomplishes it. “I might have… asked them all to make themselves scarce.”
"But you did notice" Pansy pats the bed next to her until Draco abandons his research to join her. There’s a calculating gleam in her eyes. "I know you noticed."
“I don’t suppose you’d like to spend hols with me?” Harry says softly into Draco’s ear. His breath puffs sweetly on the shell of Draco’s ear, sends a thrill of pleasure down his spine. “We’d have to spend Christmas Eve at the Burrow, but I don’t anyone will mind if we were to spend Christmas Day at mine.”
"I'm asking Draco, but you're welcome to answer if you think you've got one." Millicent doesn't so much as blink under Potter's cold gaze. "I'm sure you wouldn't let something like that happen on your watch but the information's still valuable."
"Draco," Boot leans in, warm breath brushing the shell of Draco's ear. "You've to use your hands." He demonstrates exactly that, lifting the flatbread triangle to his mouth and taking a bite. Glancing around the table, Draco notes that Lovegood has removed all her toppings, choosing to roll the bread into a cylinder. Vane nibbles in a far more ladylike fashion, looking as if she doesn't enjoy what she’s being subjected to in the least. Potter has turned his slice around, consuming the broad end first in rather large bites.
"Couldn't make them stick, even back at school. Kind of hard to concentrate when you're..." Harry made an aborted gesture with his hand. Cleared his throat. "I mean, magic doesn't solve
Theo is back at the manor a few days after visiting his father to check on his horse. Draco invites him to stay for lunch, and once they’re done, realizes he has to keep his mandatory appointment at the Ministry with his Mind Healer to discuss his thoughts. His very hostile and unsatisfied thoughts. He’s quite eager to share – something Pansy, Theo, his mother, and even Theo’s horse can all attest to.
Sliding to his knees, Harry tugs down the silky material of Draco's pajamas and Draco kicks them aside. Harry runs his hands over the skin of Draco's thighs, the slight callouses making Draco shiver, even as heat gathers in his gut. Harry parts his lips, takes Draco's prick into his mouth. Draco curls a hand in his hair, tightening his fingers when Harry hums with approval.
“I should,” Draco grumbles, crushing the paper. He pitches it into the wastebasket next to their bench. “Everyone leaves tomorrow and I still haven’t thought of a way of going back to the Manor.”
He leans back. “I remember perfectly fine. I think you’re the one who’s forgotten -- last night,” Draco says with meaning, “-- should be enough to tide us over for now. It’s just a few hours.”
Instead of answering, Potter scoots to the edge of his chair, feet planted wide. “Why won’t you sit down, it feels strange talking to you while you loom over me like that.”
“Merlin’s beard… here, son.” He hands Draco a handkerchief. “Just tell me what you need and we’ll see if we can ring it up for you and get you on your way.”
The rest of the evening is relatively uneventful. When the last spoon vanishes and the table is clear, Karrey appears and they all rise to their feet. One by one he returns their wands, saving Draco for last, under the rightful assumption that the choice would leave him highly affronted. Draco thanks Lovegood for being gracious enough to eat his pizza, then snatches his wand back with a stamp of his foot that sends the house elf scurrying off.
"I’m not sure." Draco glares down at his hands, lips pulled into a thin line. He forgot to put his gloves back on and his hands have quickly become filthy, the dark of the soil staining dark under his nails . "It doesn’t matter. The whole affair
caring. A Hufflepuff to the core. Why not take him up on the invitation?” Draco can tell by the way the fabric pulls that Harry’s making a fists inside his pockets. “After all, I’m not your boyfriend.”
He seems to get the message. “Vigorous eavesdropping. Hangingbone dropped by Flickwick’s office to ask him a few questions while he was looking over the schematics for that prototype I told you about.” Theo pauses. Draco expectants he's waiting for one of them to ask for details. When no one does Theo scowls, but keeps going. “Flickwick had me wait outside the room, but didn’t couldn’t be bothered with a simple
and feels helpless to stop. Shocked, Draco claps a hand over his mouth, nearly displacing a display of self-indexing parchment as his shoulders shake.
"I wouldn't put it past the muggles in charge of this disaster," Draco grimaces. "But I don't think so. Perhaps it'll be cool outdoors?"
It feels good to laugh. Ernie is a good influence that way, his strange, snarky humor one of the aspects that won Draco over. In the last year, he’s discovered that Hufflepuffs can be delightfully petty when all that empathy oscillates in the other direction.
They all turn their heads to watch Weasley as he exits the fireplace, dressed in plaid pajamas that match obnoxiously with the orange shade of his hair. The entire effect is eye-searing, Weasley intolerable to look at for more than a few seconds at a time.
He stifles a yawn. The cold stings his cheeks as he steps onto the grounds. He can only hope it will keep him awake long enough to make it through Muggle Studies.
“Sorry, I uh..” He shakes his head, ruefully. Points to the dirty calendar page he’s folded into dragon. Ernie nods, albeit hesitantly and Draco tries to get himself under control.
Potter shrugs. The moment brings attention to his coat, which is frayed a bit at the seams on his shoulder. Draco unholsters his wand and taps it to the threads so that they neatly stitch themselves together. “I’m happy with anything, really. Lately I’ve been thinking it might be nice to go away somewhere.”
Draco suspects the apology is for more than what just happened. He nods, acknowledging Potter’s apology without accepting it. He can sense Potter’s worry and a petty part of himself wants to make him sweat. Even worse, he can sense Potter’s sincerity and he’s afraid if he opens his mouth now, he won’t be able to take back whatever mortifying words might comes out.
Distilling their relationship down to something as simple as friendship, would never be the most viable option, but remained
The sky is a brilliant blue overhead, the sun making the freshly packed snow sparkle as Draco enters the village, careful to avoid stepping into puddles of slushy ice and the busking wizards with their lutes and violins as they sing cheery renditions of classic carols for knuts.
“And differences are all you’re working out?” Draco’s head snaps to the Weasley across from him, who is watching him with knowing blue eyes. Strangely it’s his eyes that remind Draco that for all their class differences, the Weasleys are still a part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, a pureblood family through and through, with the old magic that runs through their veins to awaken all kinds of latent gifts and clairvoyance. Draco brings a veil down over his most Potter-centric thoughts just in case.
"I observe a lot of things," Harry looks up, chewing his lip thoughtfully. The stars are out, bordered by a canopy of trees. "For instance," he says, "do you realize this is our third(fourth?) dinner date? It's like we're going steady and we haven't even kissed."
Draco narrows his eyes, studying Potter’s face. He’s avoiding Draco’s eyes, but his mouth set in a stubborn line. It’d be easy for Draco to place his hand on Potter’s cheek, to close the distance between their lips.
“Why should I? Why should anyone?” Potter sets his jaw in a stubborn line that resembles more of a pout. Draco shakes his head in bewilderment. He’s not asking Potter to tell the world if he’s not ready: it’s his business and he, more than anyone, has earned the right to his privacy. But telling the one person not in a position to judge him might be a good start. Especially considering he’s the one person, Draco hopes, that knows what Potter looks like when he comes.
calendar,” says Pansy. She punches Blaise’s shoulder and he winces. “This is last December’s. We both agreed it might cheer you up, seeing how it looks like— seeing as how if you were
Draco clenches his teeth, plucking at the blue gingham beneath him. “None of that tells us what we actually have to
“I told you it was a bad choice,” Weasley laughs. He has a pair of slippers on the table before him, sizing up how much paper they require. “There’s house pride and then there’s just plain obnoxious. One year, mum had a roll of paper with festive gnomes dressed in nothing but Santa Hats and Poinsettia flowers.”
“Yeah..” Harry makes a show of sorting his textbook and parchment. He lowers his voice so that only Draco can here. “She might still be cross about the hat.”
“Oh, we don’t hide them at all,” Draco pauses to push through a door with a large plate that identifies it as the eighth-years dormitory. “We string them up like garland over the mantle during the rest of the year. The best get mounted like trophies.”
A look of shock, and possibly anger, flits over her plain features before settling into placid interest. “I see. While I would like to grant your request, Draco, I
Harry nodded. The rest of the Aurors would arrive any minute. Somehow, it'd only made sense to summon Malfoy first. As his partner, Harry'd thought nothing of swiping two fingers over his uniform badge, all the while dodging hits as the sweet, friendly, tone-deaf woman who'd moved in next door, now lunged at him, shattered glass crunching beneath their feet.
"Pansy, he eats like a wandless person!" Draco shakes his head. "And he actually enjoys frozen pizza, which might be the foulest thing I have ever had the displeasure of putting into my mouth. Consider yourself fortunate you haven’t, it’s absolute dreck."
Then there was the dream. Draco stares out into the gloom of his bed hangings. He’d never been one for Divination — he considered Millicent the expert in that area, her tarot readings more than alarmingly accurate — but there was a reason he had top marks. One didn’t have to be an scholar to interpret that eating coal until your tongue turned black was likely a bad sign.
"Potter," Draco greets, and his voice sounds high in his throat. He swallows, tries again. "We have to stop meeting like this."
he feels knowing someone has his back. It doesn’t feel like enough. Even within his own house, among his friends, Draco has a lot to make up for.
Draco scowls. Cho and Weasley were both back to back. Wood and Diggory weren't a thing until after Hogwarts, although looking back the hints were definitely there. It makes sense. Maybe it explains why Draco's been so stubborn too. He's still fixated on Harry even now. Neither of them are seekers anymore.
Boot, who looks happy to avoiding drawing out a conversation with Romilda about her latest article in the Prophet, continues to converse with Draco instead. He seems to be making a name for himself as a portrait historian after having interviewed several of the Hogwarts portraits and a rather large handful of portraits belonging to old families of magical importance. Draco finds himself genuinely interested, especially upon the discovery that one of the portraits Boot’s been trying to track down happens to currently hang in the east wing of the Manor.
"Then they’re doing a shoddy job of it," Draco scoffs. He can't help himself, though admittedly he isn’t trying very hard. "Everyone present knows each other, Lovegood."
Lately it felt like his sleepless nights, his errant magic, the stress of the upcoming holidays, and his unbidden thoughts of Potter were all compounding to form some strange miasma that Draco was blindly wandering through, but couldn’t find his way out of.
He can feel the way Potter's cock pulses in his grip. He curls his fingers and squeezes. Potter throws his head back, hissing as he nods helplessly. "Nngh, please..!"
"Well, well, well. What have we got here?" Pansy Parkinson settled down on a cushion across from them, dressed in a skimpy red nightie that failed to leave much, if anything, to the imagination. Draco observes Potter's eyes as they run a quick glance down the length of her body and he shoots Pansy a hateful look.
“Not just any calendar.” Blaise looks around, his grin mischievous. “Nicked it from the girls when they weren’t looking. Thought it might cheer you up.” He carefully turns it so that only Draco can see when he flips the it open. December is a decidedly toned man’s torso, sat on the ground and covered in the same colorful muggles fairy from their last class. Blaise taps the page with his wand and the lights wrapped around the man’s body twinkle as he stretches suggestively. “See?”
Potter throws it down in disgust. “There’s nothing to deny! We’re classmates trying to move past the war. What business is it of theirs whether we spend time together or not?!” He tucks his chin into his scarf, swirling the tea in his mug with more force than strictly necessary. Potter is oddly magnificent when he broods. His strong jaw and dark features were made for it, like a modern day Heathcliff waiting for his moment.
Merlin’s pendulous ballsack. Sighing heavily Draco spins, yet again. "In a manner of speaking. I suppose you all had a good laugh about it down on level two."
“Did what?” Potter puts both hands in the air, the picture of innocence. “All I did was offer Ernie a drink.
“Nothing!” Draco shouts, and this time, his outburst draws eyes, including those of a concerned Granger and a suspicious Pansy. He can feel his magic rising in his core like sickly bile, and Draco does his best to taper it down. If he does something now, it’ll affect Potter too. Thankfully studying with Ernie means that he won’t be using his magic for anything more than note taking -- he can deal with a haywire quill if it meant not causing a scene.
acquaintances and I’d say I’ve made a concentrated effort just to achieve that consolation prize.” He keeps his tone light, relishing the way Potter’s eyes narrow at his words, feeling the twist in his gut.
"Mmm." Millicent sips her own champagne. "Veela's Touch and I go way back. Ask Draco." Over the top of her glass she catches his eye and winks. He snorts into his glass.
Properly medicated, Draco tampers his irritation long enough to give Madam Pomfrey a polite nod as he slips on his shoes. He likes the school’s matronly nurse — the way she never asks too many questions and doesn’t allow for opportunities of bias to keep her from efficiently doing her job. She’s almost laughably Hufflepuff, with her kind mannerisms and parental rebukes. Pomfrey reminds Draco of the nurse he’d had as a child at the manor, when his parents had decided they’d rather have him forego nursery school for a private tutor. The transference of those feelings of affection has resulted in an unquestionable deference when in the hospital wing, that Draco would never admit to if asked.
An uncomfortable silence descended around the circle.  Only Seamus and Dean were smiling and meeting his eyes.  Everyone else was looking everywhere else, even Malfoy and Pansy who Harry knew were Blaise’s closest friends.  All Harry’s Gryffindor tendencies rushed to the fore.  “Me too . . . er, I mean . . . uh, I like both too,” he blurted out.  All those eyes that had been looking elsewhere, now focused on Harry.  He turned red but he held his head high.
Harry could hear his teammates spilling out of the showers, banging lockers and chatting loudly as they pulled on clothes, but he didn’t move, keeping his eyes closed. The team had been brilliant while he recovered. He’d come and watched nearly every practice, and they’d included him in every discussion of tactics so he never felt out of the loop, even when he couldn’t join them in the air. When he’d missed the Snitch in his first match back, they’d been almost unbearably supportive, reassuring him that it took time to get back into the groove after an injury, that he’d be winning matches before he knew it. He couldn’t have had a better team around him, he thought, as he promised to meet them at the party later when they left the locker room en masse.
Nerves flutter in Draco’s stomach as he waits to see if Potter will respond, unsure if he’s pushed too far. He hopes he hasn’t—he doesn’t want Potter to leave, not now they’ve come so close.
Harry moans when Draco’s hand closes around his cock, his hips automatically lifting to meet Draco’s slow strokes. He can’t take his eyes off them, off Draco’s long pale fingers wrapped tightly around Harry’s flushed cock, and the feeling is incredible. Over the years Draco’s learnt exactly what Harry likes, and he’s merciless tonight, stroking Harry until he’s breathless and on right on the verge of orgasm.
As they prepare to head back to the office, hope swells in Harry’s chest, and the last thing he sees before he disappears into thin air is Draco, looking right at him, smile still firmly in place.
They went to a wide variety of places together, some more successful than others. Teddy had adored going to watch a Harpies match from one of the VIP boxes, screaming himself hoarse every time Ginny so much as flew near the Quaffle. Draco had enjoyed it more than he’d expected, and Harry clearly had too, judging by the beaming grin that had stayed on his face the whole time, a grin that Draco kept having to tear his eyes away from.
‘Clearly,’ Malfoy said, straightening up, his tone making it clear that he was more than a little displeased with Harry. ‘That was excruciating.’
Draco complies, and he’s in Harry’s arms again, their bodies pressed together from head to toe as Harry kisses him, and
‘Yep!’ Teddy replied, running off to find his shoes, the match forgotten in anticipation of their trip out.
Several days of wallowing in guilt later, and Harry had managed to convince himself that he’d done what he had to, that anyone else would have made the same decision as he had, and that it didn’t need to affect his relationship with Ginny at all. The incident with Malfoy was no more than a blip, the logical decision in a matter of life or death, and the fact that he couldn’t stop thinking about it only meant that he needed to put some more effort into his relationship with Ginny, not waste any more time thinking about Malfoy and the way he’d made Harry feel. He tried to stop avoiding Ginny’s eyes and shying away from every touch, and returned to work, determined to act as though nothing at all had happened.
Excitement began to build in Harry’s stomach once again as he thought about the party that awaited them. His friends and family, not to mention his team, would be waiting, and Harry was sure it would be an epic celebration. Harry was just glad that Draco was here to celebrate with him—after all, it was only due to his skills that Harry was even here. Draco was as responsible for this victory as Harry and the team were.
Teddy didn’t seem too perturbed however, and happily clung on to the pole as the train slowly left the station, his face lighting up in wonder as it picked up speed and began racing through the tunnels. He alternated between looking out of the window as if trying to see something in the gloom and gazing around at all the other passengers, watching with interest as they tapped away on their phones or bobbed their heads slightly to the music playing through the headphones they wore. Draco wasn’t a complete stranger to Muggle London—he’d spent his fair share of time in the clubs of Soho—so was at least vaguely aware of a lot of Muggle technology, but it was all very new to Teddy. Draco found himself quietly whispering explanations of each device to Teddy, praying that the noise of the train screeching along the tracks would be enough to stop any eavesdropping.
"I was sort of hoping Ron would be here," Potter sighs more to himself than the table at large, "but I guess he's been put on another rotation."
Thoughts of Harry are still on his mind when he enters the Muggle Studies classroom and Professor Hangingbone stands at the front of the room, behind her desk. She looks worse for wear, as if the time off has had an ill effect on her spirits: her hair is lank, her eyes dull. Draco thinks she looks thinner than the last time he’d seen her, the day of the brawl. It feels like months ago, though Draco knows logically it’s only been a week or two.
"What?!" He shouted, useless. If Malfoy kicked him again, he'd deserve it, but Harry could barely think over all the noise. Brows furrowed, he concentrated on Malfoy's pink lips as they formed shapes, the smooth length of his tongue.
Flatware back on the table, Draco lifts his slice and mimics the others, taking a bite of his own. He chews. It tastes... terrible. Not at all unlike how he imagines thick parchment would. It must show on his face; Boot laughs. It's pleasant -- the kind of dry laugh that reminds Draco of endless hours spent in the Slytherin Common Room.
As strange as it was, those simple words were really all Draco needed. He knew he could trust the words Harry was saying, because he never had been one to say or do things he wasn't genuinely feeling. It was a wonder, that kind of truthfulness wasn't as suffocating when it came from him -- chalk it up as another form of Gryffindor recklessness, always having his emotions on display.
"She’s right." Theo stands to his feet. "You need Headland to sign off, so convince them you’ve learned your lesson. Potter may have sent you your wand, but they’ll never lift the wards if you can’t suck it up and manage this."
"And your medal will be sent via owl post. Though I suppose it says something if you've managed to escape being poisoned... so far."
"Oh yes," Lovegood says, her ridiculously oversized earrings swinging as she nods. "I suspect he’s been following you for quite some time now." She turns to Blaise as she straightens to stand tall once more. "We should check the hall for rocks before we go, just to be safe."
"Our wands?" Draco feels the colors drain from his face. He moves a hand to his pocket unconsciously.
Draco braces a hand on Potter’s shoulder, breath hitching as he pressing it into the mattress, as his other hand fists the sheets. He leans forward over Potter as he ruts in earnest. His eyes sweep Potter’s face before settling on his mouth, his moist lips parted, so close they breath each other’s exhales as they pant.
Hands trembling, Draco grabs one at random and leafs through it, eyes moving unseeingly over the page.
Draco knows better than to answer. He thinks. He could go for his wand, still holstered on his thigh. But he’s fresh off of parole and the Ministry wouldn’t hesitate to spin the situation to suit their narrative. They’re were already mad enough that unlike his father, Draco escaped Azkaban. Had not only Harry, but Lovegood take the stand at his trial — no, stunning a Hogwarts Professor would not reflect well. He thinks he hears scurrying, but mice are prevalent in this area of the castle, so near to the Owlery, and he puts it out of his mind. He needs to stall for time. “Why me?”
Potter doesn’t look like he should be forcing revision in the library, much less standing on two feet. There are dark smudges under his eyes and his face looks wan. The twinge of sympathy it elicits in Draco is completely unwelcome.
"We should be going." Abernathy steps forward, the authoritative tone of his voice, brooking no room for argument.
Hangingbone turns back to Weasley. “Now try to think of the last time someone said something kind that elicited a strong reaction from you. Or, the last time someone said to make you very very cross. Negative emotions are usually much easier to access,” she titters.
“How does it feel? Seeking the attention of someone who wants nothing to do with you. It must be quite a shock.” The stricken expression on Potter’s face makes Draco feel like Christmas has arrived early. It almost makes up for Blaise’s harsh words and the reminder that The Manor offers no relief.
"You spent five weeks with The Order rooting out the last of the dark lord’s followers," Theo continues, failing to see Abernathy’s entrance or unbothered by it enough to censor himself should his voice carry, though Draco isn’t sure of which, "and yet they’ve still got you jumping through hoops."
"Blaise tells me you've been feeling down." Lovegood’s smile is soft and as she leans down to brush Draco's shoulder. "He's right. There’s a bit of Pogrebin hair on your jumper."
“That’s about the time you wake to iron your robes, isn’t it?” Potter asks innocently. “But you must be feeling daring this morning to let us see you with a hair out of place.”
“Have you been feeling out of sorts lately?” Draco asks, getting right to the point. “Episodes? Strange mood swings?”
Harry looks down as if he's not sure what Draco is talking about. "Ah. Yeah. I've been working on a lot of things lately, its a bit of a handful. And Henry's been no help."
In the distance, a horse neighs. A carriage, drawn by two regal looking horses, glides towards them. There's no driver, but when the horses reach them, it stops and waits.
“I know,” Potter interrupts. He has the grace to look ashamed of himself. “I know. It was a shitty thing to do.”
Theo shoots her the closest thing he has to a smile as they begin to walk. “Only because money was involved.”
It’s Hangingbone who cries out, the color draining from her face. It's too late to draw her wand. The Santa hat neither stands erect, nor turns black, but begins to violently twist in on its self atop Potter’s head. Blinding light, like a hundred lumos or the final moments of a dying star, causes Draco to shield his eyes as the light bursts and Potter topples to the ground.
Draco leans in, noses along Harry's shaft, nuzzles his balls. Potter's smells of clean sweat, musk, arousal. Slowly he drags his tongue along the vein on Potter's underside, presses his cock onto his clenching stomach, wet with slick. "You like that, don't you?" Draco murmurs into his skin.
Draco feels the anger spread through his bones. Tries to clench his jaw against the nasty words that still manage to escape. "You mean the way yours did? Thought you’d solve all my
Recently-dumped Simon glares. “Watch it, Weasley. Just because you dated Potter doesn’t make you special.”
“We’re seeing where it goes, while not seeing anyone else,” Harry answers smoothly. “I’m not a fan of labels. And really, it’s no one else's business but Draco and I. If anyone's asking," he adds, with finality.
When he opens them again, Harry holds his eyes, hooks the elastic of his boxers beneath his balls, drawn up tight to his body, in order to take himself in hand. He strokes once, twice and before Draco can think, can process what he’s doing, he’s down on his knees, crawling towards Potter and pushing his hand away.
“Imagine that,” Ginny rolls her eyes. “And here I thought my entire existence depended on what you think of me.” She turns to Draco, a hand on her hip, fiery red hair falling around her shoulders. “Harry mentioned something about you dropping by, but I didn’t think you’d be brave enough to actually do it.”
They were finally at the counter. Weasley leans past his shoulder to get a closer look at the items in the display, practically drooling onto Draco's pristine robes in the process. Draco bristles, stepping aside and leaving room for Weasley in the line. "Would you like to go first? You're practically foaming at the mouth."
pressing issue. The one Draco felt was very important to address if they were going to be get to know each other from the waist down.
Pansy doesn't even blink. "Darling, I told you before that I was thinking about joining this supper club. And your experience has been going so well, I figured, why not? Obviously we were going to run into each other sooner or later."
“Oi, you two. It’s no use turnin’ on each other.” Hagrid rubs the scruff of Fang’s neck and the great dog happily licks at his hand. “Suspect that’s what plenty o’ people will want, and you’ve got plenty who’ll be glad for it.” His face wears an unusually serious expression, but his scraggly beard does nothing to disguise the kindness of his eyes. It reminds Draco of Dumbledore, the way he’d watched him that horrible night, when he’d spoke of second chances and souls that were still worth saving.
Draco looked down at his silk pants and matching top, both in a silver that matches his robe. The pants are a bit short and he's conscious of how knobby and childish his ankles must look, out on display as they are.
Potter rises onto his elbow to protest and Draco silences him with the motion of his hips as he lifts them to open his fly. Draco bites his lip, feeling his heart race.
After a moment’s deliberation, Professor Hangingbone presents the red cap to Weasley, who looks shocked to be picked first.
That’s when it hits Draco. His mean-spirited laughter dies on his lips as his stomach drops to his feet.
The walk back to to the dungeons is a strange one. Despite being chewed out by McGonagall for minutes that felt like hours, Draco feels giddy. Like he could he could skip through the castle halls. Of course, doing that would be giving Harry the satisfaction of knowing that these feelings are all about him, so Draco holds himself back. He suspects Potter knows anyway - still connected, the dopey smile on Harry’s face gives him away just as much as if he were leeching the feeling from the very core of Draco’s being.
“Hello, hello, all.” Hangingbone seems distracted, a stiffness in her movements as she unwinds her scarf. She discards it, reaching back into her bag to pull a few sheets of parchments, a bit of self-writing chalk, and then Draco spots it. The hat.
Before Draco can say anything, Potter opens his mouth. “I know it upset you this morning, and if you really don’t want to, I won’t pressure you, but you don’t have to leave.” In the light of the fire Potter’s stare seems to grow in intensity, eyes like bottled flames. “I don’t want you to leave.”
Now, as Potter enters the Hall, his messy hair tumbled in every direction and his robes rumpled, Draco’s not so sure.
Draco has just begun sharing his doubts about the cleanliness of muggle currency, when Karrey’s ears bat-like ears twitch. With a snap of his fingers, he vanishes.
“Get 'em good, Harry! Serves the tosser right!” Weasley shouts, looking as if he might join in, as Granger grabs Potter by the back of the robes in an attempt to pull him off. Ernie and Blaise each take one of Draco's arms, dragging him out of range of Potter’s still swinging arms.
"Ha!" Draco laughs, scornfully. "Because you were so honest about skulking around my Mind Healer's office! Making vague excuses when I ran into you! Honest,
Laughing, Draco shoves Harry towards the water, and it’s only when he doesn’t let go of Draco’s hand, pulling him over the edge of the dock with him, that Draco truly feels for the first time since Potter approached him that afternoon in the library, that things will be alright.
"Granger, you must tell me how things have been going at the DMLE!" Chang says loudly, nudging her way into the circle.
It was the wrong thing to say. The exposed length of Malfoy's neck flushed a hot pink, his gaze hardening into something past warning, but not yet sanguinary. "If I had a warm body in my bed, Potter," he said, coolly. "Do you think I'd drop everything as soon as you curled your finger?"
And that’s the real problem, isn’t it. Somewhere deep down, Draco wants that to be true. He’s starting to feel possessive of Potter. To enter that dangerous zone where the time they spend together isn’t just fun and games, or for the sake of moderating their magic and keeping each other in balance -- he wants Harry Potter of his own volition. And as impossible as he knows it to be, he wants Harry Potter to want him back.
Potter has the nerve to laugh, and it sends warmth through Draco’s chest. “Ravish? Now who sounds like a prude. I’m much more concerned where your lot hides the bodies.”
“Fuck..” Draco takes Potter into his hand, whispers the wandless spell every boy to come through Hogwarts has passed along. Using the flat of his hand, Draco slicks Potter up, thrilling in how
"What difference would it have made, Draco?" Harry's expression is resigned. "You'd still think I was lying to you."
That’s what he suspects it is, anyway. Draco’s been watching Potter to be sure, but everything that’s been happening makes sense: feeling tired and unfocused while Potter walks around looking like ill, laughing when things aren’t funny, being overcome by waves of sadness so strong he bursts into tears.
Hagrid tactfully chooses to address Draco. “Yeah. Wrote to us a few times to see how Grawp and me were makin’ out. Mentioned a few things.” He takes a swig of his tea as Draco waits impatiently. “Always suspected there mighta been something more under the surface.”
“Good. Then finish up, and we’ll take Fang out to stretch ‘is legs. Grawp’ll be happy to see ‘ye too. We’ll introduce ‘im to Malfoy.”
. There's a photo of Potter looking distracted in his training robes, gazing past the camera as someone shakes his shoulder, trying to get his attention. His glasses are smudged.
Potter nods, not at all surprised to be caught out. In fact he seems proud, and a little smug. It makes Draco want to smile back, even as he tries to bite his lip in an attempt to fight it. Warm lips brush the corner of his mouth, playfully.
It’s a light supper of tea and toast in the Gryffindor common room, side by side in front of the fire, before Harry takes Draco’s hand and leads him quietly into his dorm. The others are already asleep, their curtains drawn. They crawl into Harry’s bed and slip under the sheets, Harry drawing Draco’s body to before his head has hit the pillow.
Potter sits in one of the high-backed leather chairs, looking distinctly uncomfortable as the upholstery remains stiff and unyielding under his clenched fingers, squeaking every time he shifts his weight. Draco gives him time to look around, to take in the tall Christmas tree with its silver baubles and fireflies (the dungeons are too damp for fairies), the festive boughs of evergreen that cover almost every surface, dotted with berries and glittering pinecones, and the figurines of ghosts: Christmas Past, Present, and Future, placed above the mantle. Below, several stockings hang. Blaise’s
They watch as Ernie walks back into the castle, Harry coming around the side of the bench. It’s apparent he doesn’t plan to take a seat. Draco’s eyes harden.
"Draco." Theo's voice takes on a serious tone that makes Draco go still. He looks up and Theo watches his face. "I know you've been enjoying yourself at these suppers, despite your protests. Don't forget yourself entirely."
"Hermione's been busy. She's got things going on at the Ministry and then there's the thing Harry asked her to--"
“Hmm, not really. Mother usually has a preternatural way of knowing exactly what I want before I think of it myself but I--” Draco stops himself. He doesn’t want to let Potter know that he hasn’t heard from his Mother in weeks. That he still doesn’t know if he’s doomed to spend his Christmas hols in the gloom of The Manor or the lonely halls of an empty Hogwarts. “--I haven’t managed to make a list yet. You?”
Lovegood comes to a stop. "Here we are." Set between a corridor of identical glass doors, sits a handsome round table with five chair, porcelain dishes and gleaming cutlery.
Both young men are currently attending their final year at Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, and it’s been rumored that both Potter and Malfoy have been spending more time together than some would bid proper. School staff has declined to comment, but we at the Daily Prophet will continue to keep you, the reader, informed as more develops.
Harry’s tactful enough not to comment, but Draco doesn’t like the idea of that particular idea being what leaves Harry lost in thought. Twisting his hands, Draco lets out a long sigh. "When we got back from that mission, my Father had already been taken to Azkaban. Mother and I began serving our house arrest."
Draco wants to touch himself, needs the friction -- but more than that, he wants to see Harry’s face when he comes, wants to swallow him down, Harry's warm spunk filling his mouth, and then Harry shouts and and it’s happening, warm and sticky over his tongue, dribbling down his chin.
Parvati snorts. “Not my area of expertise, but if we’re going to leave him here for three days, I’d rather get on with it. Hangingbone won’t miss him after what happened last time.”
Draco scuttles back as the flames burst a brilliant green once again, Lovegood stepping out of the fireplace. She moves aside and Blaise steps onto the hearth, brushing near-invisible soot from his rather appropriately coloured charcoal blazer.
Draco Malfoy was quick and resourceful. He had extensive knowledge of magical social circles and actually
When Draco pulls away, he’s dizzy. He has the absurd thought that he must be floating. Blinks heavily as another thought comes to him.
. Draco made a face. The last one might be a lie. He and Potter had been exercising a lot of free will and had few lines left to cross excluding penetration. But that felt like too huge a step to take lightly. Despite being a Slytherin, Draco still had areas in which he felt quite traditional. He wasn’t holding out for Potter’s hand in marriage, but, well. Something more permanent would be nice..
Potter doesn’t look like he believes it and really he ought not to, but it still makes Draco bristle knowing Potter can constantly see through him.
“I’m sorry, Ernie, I — stop staring and send for Madam Pomphrey!” Draco roars. “We’ll get you fixed up, alright? You’ll be fine.”
He feels Harry draw away from him. "This, Draco," he says, rising up onto one hand to stare down at Draco, eyes glittering dangerous. "What we're doing right now."
"And you're content to let it rot whilst you flit around the world." He doesn’t bother to mask it as a question.
“I promise I’m not reading over your shoulder, but you’ve more lines crossed out than dashes. What’s left might constitute one
They take the idea for its first spin that afternoon. The Hufflepuffs are holding a practice match on the Quidditch pitch in preparation for next week’s game. In defiance of the cold, and the fact that eighth years aren’t allowed to play as there’s no room for it in their schedules, there’s a rather large turnout of students sitting in the bleachers. He and Potter keep a healthy amount of space between them as they walk up the stairs, although there’s the occasional bumping of shoulders, the brushing of arms. Draco feels every sensation like currents under his skin.
Potter sheds his coat and hands it off to Karrey with a grateful nod. He starts to remove his gloves, (GLOVES, Draco thinks, in a daze), but seems to thinks better of it, and keeps them on. "Neville, I didn’t know you’d--" Potter falters, surprise in his voice as well as his face glancing at Draco. "Er, training ran over."
“Yes?” Draco can feel his hackles rising. “That’s what you’ve told us we had to do in order for--” He pauses, his eyes darting to the smaller Weasley who stares back at him challengingly from her perch. “In order for us to work out or difference,” he finishes stiffly.
Draco wrinkles his nose. Honestly he wants to curse whoever came up with that term. As if Potter and his friends aren't well known enough without the ministry stroking their egos.
Once he’s climbed the stairs and found the portrait of The Fat Lady, he braces against the wall opposite. Her eyes are round as she takes in his green and white scarf, his pale features. “Are you sure you’re in the right place, love?”
Blaise passes them two steaming mugs of cider spiked with a bottle of Blishen's that Theo managed to sneak in, while someone turns on the wireless and the latest release from The Weird Sisters’ Yule album begins to play. Draco lowers himself onto the empty hard-backed sofa, and Harry puts on no airs about settling in right next to him.
The truth of the matter is that Draco’s probably make a big deal out of nothing. He’s been through much worse. Had much worse said about him than idle gossip. And he’s about to say as much, when something catches his attention out of the corner of his eye. Up ahead, Potter stops and looks up.
“Hey.” He gives Draco a distractingly handsome smile but Draco can hardly appreciate it. Harry narrows his eyes. “What’s wrong?”
"Draco, where would you ever get that idea, you must have misheard me. You should get rest at night, you're very tired. Or perhaps a hobby? Something to help ease the tension and stress"
Harry finally took Draco's hand, his fingers fitting perfectly between Draco's, his palm warm and slightly rough against Draco's. A rush of emotion overwhelmed Draco, leaving him reeling from the force; a feeling of rightness rushing over him as the butterflies in his stomach took flight in a riot of wings and joy. The smile on Harry's face had grown, and Draco's heart sang to see his own happiness reflected back at him in the dim light of the cinema. The film was long forgotten as Draco mentally catalogued every inch of Harry's hand, from the calluses on his palm to the feel of his thumb as it gently moved backwards and forwards over the back of Draco's hand, each stroke taking him apart even more.
He knew he should stop this, that he should tell Ginny what had happened and work with her to move past it, but he couldn’t. He wasn’t strong enough to resist sneaking off to the shower every morning so that he could sink back into his dreams and pretend that the hand on his cock belonged to Malfoy. He was constantly on edge, second guessing every action in case he inadvertently revealed anything to Ginny, tired from all the extra hours he was putting in at work to avoid going home, his nerves fried from awareness of Malfoy any time they were both in the office. A single encounter in the office kitchen was enough to have Harry’s heart racing, an hour trying to avoid looking over at Malfoy during the team meeting leaving him half-hard, desire building with every glance at Malfoy.
‘After the war,’ Malfoy began after taking a deep breath, ‘I didn’t know what to do with myself. I had so much to unlearn, so much to come to terms with. Pansy and Blaise left the country, my parents fled to France, and I was all alone. Astoria saved me, in a lot of ways. She was my only friend for a long time, while I worked to become a better person, although believe me, I know I’ll never be able to make up for what I was a part of. But nevertheless, she supported me through it all.’
It wasn’t anything like Harry had expected. Even in his occasional fantasies about men, about Malfoy, he hadn’t thought it would feel like this. Malfoy’s lips were soft, whispering against his like silk, tentative at first, but then a wave of heat ran through Harry, and nothing was tentative anymore. Desire rushed through him, and he was kissing Malfoy back, gasping into his mouth as their tongues met. Harry hadn’t kissed like this in years.
‘No!’ Draco blurted out, blushing involuntarily at the force of his exclamation. ‘I mean, it’s fine, I can make you a quick drink.’
‘Draco!’ Narcissa tutted. ‘She can’t go on like this—it’s already such a burden on her, raising a young child at her age, although of course she’d never say it. It’s important that Edward learns what is expected of him, how he should behave.’
‘No. They wouldn’t have had me. I did my N.E.W.T.s on my own, that first year after…’ Malfoy trailed off, then shook his head minutely and continued, ‘And then I did my Healer training in France.’
Weirdly, seeing Malfoy angry made Harry feel slightly better. He felt more on solid ground with a Malfoy who clearly disliked him, rather than the blank professional act he’d been putting on. But still, Harry was wary.
‘I know, Pansy couldn’t believe it either.’ Malfoy laughed. ‘But I wasn’t exactly welcome in wizarding society at that time, and besides, I was curious about Muggles. After spending so much of my life hearing my father spew hate about them, I wanted to see for myself what they were like.’
‘I don’t think you’re stupid!’ Harry burst in. He knew he deserved all the yelling and more, but he didn’t want Ginny to think badly of herself.
Wind whipped through Harry’s hair as he flew at top speed along the pitch, weaving through the other players as he pursued the Snitch. The wind was cool against his warm cheeks—the summer had turned out to be one of the hottest in years, and he’d been sweating as he floated above the pitch, roasting in the sun as he looked for the Snitch. Three and a half hours into the match, he’d finally spotted it, and now the hunt was on.
He moved out that day, although the process of untangling their lives took much longer than that first symbolic move.
‘Right- yes- it is cold today,’ Draco managed to get out, before he hurriedly turned to make Harry’s drink, hoping Harry hadn’t seen the way his cheeks had flushed at his inarticulacy.
Two hours later, Harry was tipsy and embroiled in a rather passionate Quidditch discussion with Evangeline. The evening hadn’t been as bad as he’d feared—Malfoy had stayed on his side of the table, and they’d managed to avoid being pulled into any of the same conversations. That didn’t mean Harry hadn’t been painfully aware of Malfoy’s presence all night though, and he was finding it increasingly hard to stop his gaze from drifting over to him. Harry didn’t think he’d ever seen Malfoy this relaxed. His cheeks were pink from the heat of the pub, and he was laughing at whatever Robertson had just said, his face lighting up as he did so. It made something in Harry’s stomach squirm uncomfortably.
'That's the plan, yeah,' Harry agreed, smiling down at Teddy in a way that made Draco's heart ache. Harry's eyes flicked back up to Draco, and he continued, tone more hesitant now. 'D'you—do you want to join us?'
Draco watched Harry as he soaked up the magic coursing through the earth and into the air, remembering the way it had felt when his parents had first brought him here as a child, and the way it had felt when he first came here as an adult. He’d already been displaying signs of accidental magic when they first brought him, but as he hadn’t yet learned to channel his magic or unlock the depths of it that lay buried inside him, the effect wasn’t as strong. It was still incredible, but it had taken longer to notice the magic floating around him and inside him, and he’d noticed an immediate difference when he’d visited again after the war. That time it was like he was drowning in magic, magic pouring into each pore as he absorbed the magic from the earth through his feet.
And then the room became a whirlwind of activity, Harry standing stock still in the middle as Draco and Milllie debated colours and cloth and cuts. Harry let them talk, recognising that this was by no means his area of expertise, his mind wandering as they began to discuss the differences between two seemingly identical colours. It was strange, really, Harry thought, how comfortable he felt standing there, with two Slytherins discussing how best to show off his trim Auror figure to most annoy Draco Malfoy’s ex boyfriend, of all people. Before today, he had never even set foot in a tailor’s, but he was actually quite enjoying himself, and found himself soaking up the different terms they used, learning more about the world that Draco and Millie were so clearly comfortable in. He was starting to understand why Draco was always so happy the day after he had been to see Millie for a new suit.
‘Physical therapy. Nothing extravagant, and his team had a physiotherapist lined up for when he was discharged from hospital, but we did a bit of extra work before he left St Mungo’s to help him recover his mobility and strength faster. Got him up and about a bit sooner than usually happens with Skele-Gro patients, walking around the hospital, that kind of thing.’
Malfoy appeared not long after ten thirty, once again clad in his Healer’s robes. He set down another beaker of Skele-Gro, and then pulled a chair up to Harry’s bed, just as he had the night before.
The lid of the jewellery box snapped shut, the scream cutting off abruptly. Harry’s ears continued to ring, the echo of the scream lingering in the silence, but the agonising pain receded, and Harry slid to the ground in relief.
Pulling to a stop, Harry looked down at the crowd in awe. An endless sea of Puddlemere flags waved back at him, his name ringing around the stadium as the crowd chanted. It was almost more than he could take in, and he shook his head in disbelief as he tried to commit the sight to memory. He’d known that they’d stood a good chance of winning the match, and at the start of the season he’d really believed Oliver when he’d said that this could be their year, but after his injury a tiny seed of doubt had been sown. Even though he’d played, and won, several matches since returning to the pitch, a small part of him had wondered if he’d be able to come through when it really mattered. But he had, and now he was part of a League-winning squad.
Three days later, there’s a loud banging on Draco’s front door. He thinks it must be Pansy, assuming that she’s realised en route to her portkey that she’s left something behind.
Harry waited for his drink quietly, Draco sneaking looks over to see that Harry was seemingly quite content stood there, lazily gazing round the cafe while he waited. Draco wondered what Harry thought of what he was seeing, how Draco’s handiwork looked through Harry’s eyes. He wondered how
‘But we could just go on a trip anyway? No lesson, just… us, taking Teddy out?’ Draco offered, hoping Harry wouldn’t mind being referred to as an ‘
‘Eloquent as always I see,’ Draco replies, and then pushes further. ‘Surely you of all people don’t need to pay for sex?’
‘Yes, the first night always is the worst,’ Malfoy said, noting something down on Harry’s chart before putting it back. ‘It should ease soon.’ He paused and looked at Harry intently. ‘Dreamless Sleep is available if you wish.’
‘Don’t you dare,’ Draco almost growls. If Potter leaves now, with him hard and dripping and desperate like this? Well, Draco doesn’t know what he’d do.
It hadn’t bothered Draco—he’s used to not having much information about his clients—but now that he’s here, waiting for them to arrive, there’s a flutter of nervous anticipation in his stomach as he wonders who will walk through the door into his suite. His clients are a real range, no common thread linking them other than a desire for companionship for the night. The hotel he works for is good at vetting them, so he’s never worried for his safety, and he knows they’re good for the money. The anticipation comes instead from not knowing what they’ll want from him, what role he’ll have to play. He loves it all, has done ever since the post-war hostility made him turn to this career.
‘Could be worse,’ Harry said with a shrug, wincing as pain lanced up his arm and through his shoulder. Malfoy’s forehead furrowed as he watched Harry, but to Harry’s relief he didn’t say anything or try to press him to take Dreamless Sleep again.
Draco mutters something about being pleased Potter had a good time, before getting off the bed, his afterglow well and truly vanished. He stands by the window, pretending to watch the outside world as he studiously ignores the sounds of Potter moving about, straightening his clothes and gathering his things. He doesn’t want to look over, afraid that his face will say something he’d rather keep hidden.
‘Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks aren’t here, and Edward is growing up in a pure-blood family. It’s important that he learns these things,’ Narcissa said, her tone taking on a sharper edge.
‘Oh god, I know,’ Harry said, hanging his head in mock shame. ‘George and Ron had it made for me a few Christmases ago as a joke present. I don’t even know why I still have it.’
He’s so relaxed, in fact, that he jumps, water splashing over the sides of the tub and onto the floor, when he realises that someone else is in the bathroom with him.
‘Alright, mate?’ Ron said after Harry had assured Hermione that he was fine. ‘Brilliant match, that final chase was epic.’ Ron was seemingly oblivious to the disapproving look Hermione shot his way.
Malfoy looked at Harry for a long moment, then sighed and came closer, pausing briefly before sinking into one of the armchairs next to Harry’s bed.
Harry watched him walk away, his heart full, anticipation for Friday already blooming. He didn’t know what this Friday with Malfoy would involve, only that it would be very different to the Fridays he’d come to cherish, but he couldn’t wait to find out.
to know, but he was worried that asking would push him away. That he’d shut down and become cold again. The past was a tricky subject with them, after all.
‘I’m never going to be able to look at the sofa the same way again. Let’s do it on the counter next time.’
Once they were out onto the street, Draco pulled Teddy to one side, getting them out of the way of the crowds as much as possible, and began pointing out landmarks as they walked. He showed Teddy the Houses of Parliament, comparing it to the Ministry of Magic, just as busy making decisions and passing laws. Teddy was very impressed by Big Ben, proclaiming it the biggest clock he’d ever seen, and wondering if it would be possible to add hands to it for all his family, just like Mrs Weasley’s clock. Draco gestured to all the people walking around them, speaking countless different languages and gazing around at the sights with the same wide-eyed look of interest that was on Teddy’s own face, and told Teddy about how people loved to come and see this famous place, where laws were made that were supposed to—at least in theory—make life better for everyone. Draco described how the Muggles elected their own leaders and how that was different to the way the Ministry worked; careful to make sure that he explained it in a way that would make sense to Teddy and present him a balanced view of both systems. He made a mental note to take Teddy to the Ministry on one of their next trips.
‘No,’ Malfoy said finally, just when Harry thought he’d officially gone too far and pushed too hard. ‘No, I don’t think love is like that, at least not all the time. For a long time I thought it was—hard not to, growing up watching my parents, seeing the way my mother consistently made terrible choices because of her love for my father. That love was poisonous, and their love for me wasn’t much better, really, when you consider all the things I did because of it. It made me think that love would only bring harm, in the end.’
Draco’s cock rubs against Harry’s stomach with every one of Harry’s thrusts, and it feels incredible. Harry’s hitting his prostate incessantly, pushing Draco closer and closer to his orgasm with every stroke, and although Draco doesn’t want this to end, he knows he can’t hold off much longer. When Harry closes his eyes and kisses Draco, his tongue slipping into Draco’s mouth, Draco is done for. He moans into Harry’s mouth as he starts to come, their bodies growing sticky as he spills between them. It’s the best orgasm of his life.
Once Harry had caught his breath and pulled his emotions under control, he stepped back, untangling their fingers before casting a cleaning charm over them both, wiping away any evidence of what they’d just done. He knew it would be harder to wipe it from him, though, knew that what they’d done, the fucking and the hand-holding, had somehow crossed over into new territory, the ground beneath their feet far shakier now. By the time Malfoy turned around, Harry had straightened out his clothes and attempted to smooth his hair, but he could tell from the expression on Malfoy’s face that he wasn’t doing a good job of hiding the emotions running through him.
‘It’s fine, don’t worry about it.’ Draco’s voice sounds hollow even to his own ears, but Potter doesn’t seem to notice.
‘Didn’t you win Witch Weekly’s most desirable wizard or some rubbish like that multiple years running?’ Draco suppressed a laugh at the way Harry’s blush deepened.
‘You want to marry a Muggle?’ Draco said cautiously, thinking that he knew what Harry was trying to say but wanting to confirm it either way.
‘Looking forward to it,’ Harry said, thrilling at Malfoy’s answering smile. He was being honest—despite the complicated past they shared, Malfoy’s visits to his room had fast become Harry’s favourite part of the day. He tried to tell himself that it was only because being stuck in hospital was so boring that any company would be worth looking forward to, but he knew that wasn’t quite the truth.
They’d slowed to a complete halt, and Harry’s heart skipped a beat as Malfoy quietly confessed his hopes. Malfoy was looking directly at him, not shying away from the intimacy of their conversation, and for a moment Harry was sure that everything he was feeling was showing on his face.
Harry grimaced—he hated the way his war fame still clung to him like a jinx he couldn’t shake off, and he particularly disliked it when people focused on him rather than the match. He was aware of grumbles among the players in the League about his fame, complaints that it took attention away from them and the game, but he had no idea what they expected him to do about it. If he had his way he’d fade into anonymity, but he knew that the
It was draining, and combined with his still high workload, Draco was struggling. Each night he fell into bed completely wiped out, and he’d broken down in tears more than once, regrets overwhelming him as he remembered the terrible things he had done at Hogwarts. But it would all be worth it if he could stop Teddy having to hear the same things his father had told him. He carefully noted down all the traditions his father had discussed, all the ways Lucius had taught him how to be a proper pure-blood heir, and tried to think of ways he could teach Teddy the opposite.
‘Which bit do you think disqualifies you? I would have said we know each other quite well by now, after all this time you’ve spent cluttering up my cafe.’
But then Potter moves, as he always does, sitting up and running a hand through his hair, and shatters all of Draco’s hopes with his careless words.
‘I—I don’t know,’ Harry said, the lingering pain leaving him confused, Malfoy’s proximity only making things worse. He couldn’t look away from him. ‘What happened?’
‘It’s harder than you’d think,’ Potter laughs ruefully. ‘Dating, casual sex, whatever,’ he waves a hand in the air, ‘it’s all hard in Britain. People watch me everywhere I go, and I never know if people are actually interested in me or just in the man they think they know.’
‘No, or at least not heirlooms from that family. Robertson did some digging and found out which shop they’d come from, and we eventually managed to get the owner to show us his records. The daughter had bought them all, in quick succession, and had evidently decided to hide them at her mother’s house.’
Draco can see that Potter is wavering now. His face is more unsure than it was earlier, the shock and anger disappearing along with his frown, and although he tries to look away, his eyes keep flicking back to Draco.
‘Uh—no, I’m fine thanks,’ Harry said quickly. He’d taken his fair share of Dreamless Sleep after the war, and though it had got him through some extremely difficult nights, he didn’t love the way it made him feel, and he was cautious about coming to rely on it. He’d rather struggle through a few painful nights than feel that numbness and disconnection from the world again.
‘No, wait, like this,’ Malfoy interrupted, as Harry slowly touched each finger to his thumb, one by one. ‘Can I?’ Malfoy paused, his hand hovering inches from Harry’s.
His emotions must have shown on his face, because Malfoy’s smile faded and he unlinked their hands, before getting out of bed and slowly collecting his clothes from where they had been tossed on the floor. Harry stayed silent while Malfoy dressed, only getting out of bed and hurriedly pulling on a pair of jogging bottoms when Malfoy walked to the bedroom door.
‘You know you’re fit, Malfoy, I don’t know why you need to hear me say it!’ Potter bursts out, before murmuring something that sounds a little like
‘Do all wizards know about this place?’ Harry asked, Teddy opening his eyes and looking interestedly at Draco.
Malfoy’s face clouded over, his easy smile vanishing as his lips turned down at the corners. ‘She’s not well. She hasn’t been since my father was sent to Azkaban.’
‘Yes, after a while. I’d spent quite a lot of time in Muggle cafes, after the war, just discovering what Muggles were really like, and I always enjoyed being in them. It took some time for me to find the right thing, and the right place, but then I came here, and, well. It all fell into place.’
person in the whole Ministry who could work on a case. It was flattering, in a lot of ways, and Draco would be lying if he said his ego didn’t enjoy it, but the confidence boost couldn’t make up for the lack of sleep and long hours spent in the office trying to determine the exact potion that was responsible for a number of deaths the Aurors were investigating.
‘The Ministry Yule Ball invitations have arrived,’ Draco said, dropping his and burying his head in his hands.
Potter lets out a groan as Draco begins to mouth the rough fabric of his jeans, his cock hot and hard under Draco’s lips. Draco unbuttons Potter’s flies tantalisingly slowly, letting the tension build as he gets closer to finally seeing Potter’s cock after many a teenage fantasy about it. Potter moans when Draco touches his cock, the skin soft and hot under his fingers. Draco licks a stripe up the vein pulsing on the underside, savouring the taste and smell of Potter, so heady and strong this close.
Present day Harry was different, lighter, his laugh echoing around the room as Teddy attempted to tickle him. The bags under his eyes were gone, his skin glowed with the exertion of play-fighting but also from happiness and contentment. His hair was still a complete mess, made worse from rolling around on the floor—and Merlin, Draco wouldn’t acknowledge the way that made him feel—and he’d bulked up, the flash of toned stomach that kept appearing as his t-shirt got pulled up during the fight suggesting that Harry was definitely working out. He just seemed
‘I—.’ Draco doesn’t know what to say. He doesn’t know whether to tell her the truth, or where he would start if he did. But he can’t lie to Pansy, and part of him is desperate to talk about it, to share his turmoil with someone else. So he says it.
After another ten minutes or so, Malfoy called proceedings to a halt, much to Harry’s relief. His wrist was more than a little achy now.
‘As the oldest male in the family,’ Narcissa began, and Draco sighed. He had been right—he knew exactly where this conversation was going to go now. ‘And considering the… absence… of Edward’s father, it is your duty to teach Edward the things he needs to know, to teach him about our traditions and history. It’s time for his
Harry waited for a moment, in tense anticipation of pain erupting under his skin, but when nothing happened, he relaxed. ‘Fine,’ he called out to Malfoy.
Draco’s cock throbs and he complies, the expensive bedding soft under his knees. Once he’s settled, he stills, heart thumping loudly in his chest as he waits to see what Potter has planned next.
‘Overtime?’ Harry thought about the bags under Malfoy’s eyes. They’d been growing more pronounced by the day, but Harry hadn’t paused to think about what might be causing them.
Draco Malfoy was standing next to his bed, lime-green robes buttoned up to his throat and a chart and quill in his hands as he peered down at Harry. A mediwitch stood next to him, but Harry barely noticed anything about her beyond her bright pink hair, far too distracted by Malfoy.
‘Right,’ he said, nodding to himself and standing up. ‘You’ll have to take a few more doses of Skele-Gro before your bones will have healed enough, but as soon as possible we’ll get you up and moving about. I must go and finish my rounds now, but I’ll be back to check on you again later.’
‘Goal!’ the commentator shouted, and the stadium roared their approval. They were playing at home, and the stands were a sea of navy blue and gold scarves, jerseys, and flags.
Harry’s guilt wasn’t enough to stop him hurtling towards his orgasm far quicker than he expected. Malfoy’s tongue was doing sinful things to his cock, and Harry couldn’t resist looking down to watch Malfoy stroke himself off, the tip of his prick poking through his fist with every stroke. He was nearly at the point of no return when he suddenly remembered why they were doing this.
‘Draco?’ Harry interrupted Draco’s thoughts, and he sighed, deciding that he wouldn’t lie, he couldn’t lie to Harry. Something about him made Draco want to be honest for once.
Of all the things Draco expected to see when he walked back to the counter after taking a quick break in the back room, Harry Bloody Potter standing in the middle of his cafe was not one of them.
‘The ache and muscle weakness is to be expected,’ Malfoy said, ‘but that will decrease as you start to move around more and more. Do you think you can walk? Try a few steps, see how that feels.’
Oliver was rather less horrified at Malfoy being Harry’s Healer than Ron had been—apparently Oliver was well aware of Malfoy’s brilliance at healing Quidditch injuries, and the news only got him more excited about his plans for Harry’s return to the pitch. Oliver and the team physio had come up with a plan of exercises to try and get Harry back to his best in time for the final matches of the season, and Oliver wanted to see if Malfoy had any other ideas to add to his plan. By the time Oliver left, Harry’s mind was spinning with details of plays, and match plans, and tactics. It felt more like he’d been at one of Oliver’s team meetings than having a visit from a friend, but Harry appreciated the thought nonetheless.
‘Do it,’ Harry whispered, bucking his hips forward, making Malfoy’s hand brush his cock through his jeans.
Ginny didn’t look impressed by Harry’s explanation, her eyebrows raised and disbelief etched across her face. ‘You expect me to believe that you fucked Malfoy because of a curse?’
As Turner scored yet another goal, Harry turned around to face the opposite end of the pitch. He felt a droplet of rain land on his nose, and as he looked up into the clouds, he saw it. The Snitch was hovering not too far away from him, tiny wings fluttering rapidly, just slightly higher up in the sky than he was. Harry’s heart kicked up a gear as he bent low over his broom and pushed forwards, the wind stinging his face as he picked up speed. He only had a few seconds before his opponent would notice his movement, and he needed to make the most of them.
Malfoy chuckled quietly, and the underlying tension that had settled across the room while they talked broke. Harry half-expected Malfoy to leave then, to decide that they’d talked enough, that there was no need to risk bringing up more difficult moments from their past. Instead, Malfoy simply shifted in his seat, crossing one long leg over the other.
‘Shut up, Potter,’ Draco replies, unable to keep his voice from giving away just how affected he is.
And then Potter moves. He takes it slow at first, but then his thrusts begin to pick up speed, and Draco loses it entirely. Everything reduces down to the drag of Potter’s cock inside him, to the bursts of pleasure when Potter hits his prostate. Draco’s vaguely aware that he’s talking, words escaping as he loses himself in pleasure, but he has no idea what he’s saying. He doesn’t care, not while Potter’s making him feel this good.
He’s wondered before, what it would feel like to kiss Draco, but he never thought it would set off such an intense desire in him. Any thoughts he might have had about taking this slow fly out of his mind immediately, his cock hardening as he slips his tongue into Draco’s mouth. For his part, Draco seems just as into it - his hands are everywhere, burning a trail through Harry’s Auror robes as they explore his body.
‘Yeah,’ Harry said. ‘Yeah, it was.’ He couldn’t hold back a smile as he remembered how brilliant Malfoy had felt as they moved together, and Malfoy’s answering smile only made his own grow even more.
‘Really? They weren’t heirlooms?’ Harry was intrigued despite himself, and he wanted to know what Malfoy had found out.
Harry had never seen Malfoy look so unsure of himself, and the unexpected vulnerability made it easy for Harry to be honest for once.
‘I just- I don’t know. I was done with it, the bureaucracy and the regulations and the feeling that I wasn’t really helping anyone, stuck behind a desk barking orders. It just, it wasn’t right anymore.’
Ron didn’t look convinced at all, and he still looked like he was about to storm out to the mediwizard station and kick up a fuss until Harry was assigned a different Healer. Desperate to avoid a scene that would inevitably lead to headlines about the
‘Could you still get married here? It’s not too late. You’re not too old to get married yet,’ Harry added, a teasing edge to his voice that briefly lightened the mood.
Harry knows he can’t last for much longer, can feel his orgasm building deep in his gut but he doesn’t want to come yet, not until he knows what it feels like to have Draco come on his cock. If this never happens again, he wants to make sure he experiences every possible moment of this, wants to be able to revisit this memory again and again. Draco is writhing underneath him, pushing back to meet Harry’s every move, his hand gripping Harry’s tightly. Wanting to bring Draco over the edge with him, Harry slides his hand around, finding Draco’s cock and beginning to stroke in time with the movement of his hips.
, and after only a few minutes of searching, Harry stopped in front of the shop and looked through the bay window to see if he could spot Draco. Three mannequins blocked his view, each sporting dress robes that even Harry, with his distinct lack of interest in clothes, could tell were of an extremely high quality. His spirits started to lift slightly - clearly this tailor knew what they were doing.
Harry looked down from where he was circling high above the pitch, watching as his teammate sped towards the goalposts, the Quaffle tucked tightly under her arm. She veered, pulling the Ballycastle Bats’ Keeper towards the left-hand goalposts, then turned sharply, throwing the Quaffle with such speed that the Keeper had no time to adjust.
‘Oh.’ They’d left the incident with the jewellery box out of their case report, so if that got submitted as evidence no one would need to know what had happened, but if they got called as witnesses… well, it wouldn’t be completely out of the ordinary for them to be asked to take Veritaserum, or to submit their memories as proof of what they said on the stand, and that would have disastrous consequences for both of them.
Things started to go wrong, however, as soon as they entered the Tube station. Draco had been to Gringotts and exchanged some of his Galleons for Muggle money, so they headed straight for the ticket machines, Draco desperately hoping he could remember how Muggle money worked. He wasn’t completely useless with technology—he knew how to use a computer for Merlin’s sake—but the machine was slow and unresponsive each time he jabbed at it with his finger, and his frustration grew each time he accidentally poked the wrong option and had to backtrack. A queue was starting to form behind him, people even starting to pointedly look at their watches or tap their feet in a sure sign of extreme impatience, but as Draco grew more self-conscious about his slowness, he just got clumsier. When he finally got to the point of paying for their tickets, he thought the worst was over, but then he fumbled and dropped a bunch of money on the floor, Teddy shrieking and chasing after the coins as Draco hurriedly picked up the notes. It was painfully embarrassing, and Draco’s cheeks were still burning when they eventually made it onto the train.
Grace nodded and made a note on his chart. As she wrote, Malfoy stepped closer to Harry’s bed, his eyes roving over Harry’s face before he turned his attention to Grace.
Draco is silent for a moment. He’s always assumed Potter was getting around a fair bit, even if he never sees any evidence in the papers. After all, a celebrity like Potter would know how to be discreet with their encounters. But maybe the reason he never sees photos of Potter on a date or taking someone home from a club was because it just didn’t happen. Draco felt a momentary pang of sympathy for Potter which was immediately tempered by his own memories.
‘I had,’ Harry agreed. ‘I hated the fame—I still do. But, well, I just didn’t really know what else to do, and ever since I went to watch the World Cup before fourth year I liked the idea of flying professionally.’
And yet. Something made Harry go to the kitchen before heading up to bed, and there, in the middle of the long wooden dining table that took up the centre of the room, was a letter. Harry’s heart kicked into overdrive and he nearly tripped over his own feet in his haste to get to the letter. With shaking hands he opened it, and sank into a chair to read. A grin spread over his face as he read and reread the words written in Malfoy’s neat handwriting, hope blooming in his chest once again.
The bed dips under Potter’s weight as he joins Draco on it. Everything about this feels more intimate than Draco’s usual jobs—he’s never been so affected by being close to someone. He’s never wanted any of his clients this badly either, even the regulars who he knows will show him a good time. His nerves have never screamed out to be touched in the way that they are now, tense and eager for Potter’s next move.
‘Fine,’ Harry said, even though he wasn’t at all. His leg ached and his mind whirled as he tried to process what had just happened. He’d wanted to kiss Malfoy, desperately, and for a moment it had seemed like Malfoy wanted it too.
As soon as Draco’s trousers were open, Harry slid a hand into the black silk boxers that Draco always wore, his cock hot against Harry’s palm as he pulled it out. Draco’s groan echoed loudly in the quiet locker room as Harry leaned in and licked a stripe up his cock before tonguing around the head in the way that never failed to make Draco fall apart. Over the past few months he’d learned all the ways to make Draco moan and beg and fall to pieces under his hands. It was a heady feeling, watching Draco’s poise slip away at Harry’s touch, and one Harry didn’t think he’d ever get tired of.
As the aftershocks wrack through his body, Harry picks up Draco’s hand, bringing it to his mouth. He licks off the remnants of his come that still cling to Draco’s fingers, and then drops kisses all over his hand, trying to wordlessly express how much he loves what they do to him.
‘Potter,’ Draco replied, turning to look back at Harry, who was still sitting at the counter, mug in hand.
‘I missed you,’ Harry said quietly, watching Malfoy’s face closely to catch his reaction. ‘I only stayed away at work because it was too hard to pretend that I only saw you as a colleague.’
‘That’s not actually a rule we have you know,’ Draco retorted, aware that Harry was just joking but also stung a little by the jab at his family and their past. ‘But maybe you’re right; taking him out somewhere would definitely make the lessons more interesting.’
‘Potter,’ Draco says, warning clear in his tone. He knows what Potter has just seen, and he doesn’t want to talk about it. Doesn’t want guilt and memories and darkness to come between them just as they’ve finally found something good that connects them. ‘We don’t have to do this now.’
‘I’m not your patient anymore!’ Harry said, desperately. ‘We can go on a date, get to know each other outside of here.’
The worst time was at night, though. Each evening Harry fell into bed exhausted and desperate for sleep, but instead ended up lying in bed for hours, staring at his dark ceiling, consumed by thoughts of Malfoy. Their kiss played on repeat over and over in Harry’s mind until he practically burned with desire, every cell in his body vibrating with need. Even when he finally fell asleep it was no better. Malfoy featured in every dream, his body hot under Harry’s as they lost hours exploring one another. In Harry’s dreams, Malfoy was unbelievably responsive, his moans low in Harry’s ear as they moved together, pushing each other to higher and higher peaks of pleasure. Without fail, Harry awoke hard and aching, desperate to have Malfoy’s hands on him.
When Harry walked into the cafe one day in late December, it seemed like a normal day. Draco had decorated the cafe for Christmas several days previously, and the fairy lights strung along the mantelpiece and the shelves of the bookcases twinkled as the sun gradually set outside. The cafe had been surprisingly busy all day, last minute Christmas shoppers laden with bags stopping in for a caffeine boost to give them the energy to deal with the crowds thronging the streets. The longer Harry sat in the cafe, chatting with Draco in between customers, however, the quieter it got. The weather was closing in, each new customer complaining about the bitter cold, and the clouds were gathering, threatening snow. Soon Harry was the only person besides Draco left in the cafe, everyone else having sensibly left to get home before the weather took a turn for the worse.
