leave it at that, to follow Harry without question yet again, but
Flushed and awkward, Draco clears his throat into his fist and backs away, whole body screaming reluctance, and turns on his heel to head back inside. His chest and hands feel infinitely colder now that they’re not pressed against Harry’s and he curses himself for his cowardly propensity to flee from every mildly frightening situation.
They twitch at the edges.
but the reassuring squeeze of Harry’s fingers entwined with his.
“We can make do.”
“Snape was your-” he sputters. Coughs. “Sorry, I just find it really hard to imagine someone naming him godfather to their kid.”
He can’t stay. He can’t- Never mind falling over in front of the whole crowd, he’s near falling
He hadn’t had anything stocked in the cupboards (possessing exactly zero life-skills) but having spent his childhood going to the most extreme lengths to avoid eating his vegetables, he’d become pretty adept at wandlessly transfiguring anything he’d found unappetising into pure sugar. He’d eyed the berries contemplatively, before committing to his plan and directing a blast of his magic toward a glum-looking shrub that was sagging over the edge of his weed-infested flower bed. He’d berated himself for his overenthusiasm when the entire plant - along with most of the stragglers surrounding it - had collapsed into piles of crystalline, white granules (he’d crossed his fingers that the muggle police wouldn’t decide on an impromptu visit). A couple of hours later found him slumped against his lower kitchen cabinets, with a few hundred jars of homemade blackberry jam lined up on the counter above him, each one with a slip of parchment tied to the rim on a length of twine, reading “I’m sorry” in (ever-decreasingly) neat cursive.
“I’m no’ sayin’ tha’ ‘cause I wan’ an apology. Yeh already did tha’ once.”
Draco stands abruptly, cursing himself aloud.
“Uh…”

Potter visibly struggles to draw in a breath as he mashes his forehead into his knee and his hand is
Draco looks up from the boots as Harry sets his hand flat on the door, slowly pushing it open with a gleefully mysterious grin. Draco rolls his eyes at the theatrics, but steps forward obligingly.
Draco peers around nervously at the sleeping village, praying silently that no one hears Harry’s ear-splitting tirade. Of course, because his luck is abysmal, he ends up making very awkward eye contact with a horrified elderly couple across the street, who are staring at him and Harry as though they’d murdered an infant right in front of them.

, it’s only fair - eyes bug out of his head and his jaw drops wide.
Draco chances a peek at the doorway; he bites his lip in longing.
“C’mon then,” Potter calls, beckoning him over, before ducking into a hole at the base of the trunk.
Hagrid turns away from the sky to fix him with a side-eyed stare.
“You’ve been caught before, haven’t you.”
(He has to wonder; who is he and what had he done with Draco Malfoy? But somehow the sight of someone as equal a mess as he is has bolstered him enough for him to feign a natural conversational upper-hand).
He balks.
Draco stares.
Draco has never been one to turn down a challenge from Harry Potter.
Draco starts.
“You know this place?” he repeats. Draco sputters, flapping a hand around ineligantly.
“Yer expectin’ me teh clobber yeh.”
, I don’t-” he huffs.
He allows himself a brief, shuddering sigh of relief before resuming his arduous escape.
Draco rather believes that he doesn’t
Draco had. The day after the Wizengamot had given him parole, with his wand confiscated for the following year, the Slytherin had sat in his then-new country kitchen, armed with several rolls of blank parchment and a quill. After a few hours of oscillating between staring blankly at the page and scribbling down whatever gibberish first sprang to mind, he had come to the very distressing conclusion that he didn’t know how to write an apology if his life depended on it (which, at the time, he very much felt that it did).
Harry catches his eye and grins.
With that last thought, he nods to himself, draws in a steeling breath, and turns to the door.
Potter coughs.
Or would he see who Draco sees in the mirror?
And that is a hole he’s been stuck in for a long, long time.
“An’ it’ll ge’ better.”
“You have a lovely home,” he says politely. It’s not even a lie; the lounge, where they are currently, is cramped but inviting, the low ceiling lined with molasses-brown original beams, the walls painted a pleasant, sunny yellow and the small, iron fireplace singing a fiery little ditty in the corner, warming the room with its mellow song. The furniture, while worn and scattered with the evidence of Harry’s inability to Adult, only gives the place a lived-in, homey feel.
an hour of the (frankly inappropriate) merriment, so McGonagall can hardly get huffy with him for not showing his face... though she might have a go at him for ditching before the speeches.
Potter seems to give up on his twiddling, shoving the rectangle back into the folds of his robes with an annoyed huff. He stares at Draco. Draco stares back. Then Potter scrambles to his feet, meets Draco’s eye again with a determined glint flashing in his own and holds out his hand.
“You good?” he asks, still half-laughing. Draco grumbles under his breath, cursing
With that thought in mind, and the…
“Fine,” he sighs (he pointedly does not think about how easily he’s willing to give in at Potter’s use of his given name, nor why said use of his given name has his heart causing a racket within his ribcage). “It was Professor Snape.”

Settles in Harry’s arms, he gives a small, shy smile back.
“I can- I can dance! I’m not some clumsy
“...Right.” Draco nods as though that had made sense.
He trails off, chances a glance upwards and meets Harry’s lidded eyes.
Draco sighs heavily and watches Harry nod along to the rhythm, until his eyes slip down to where Harry’s lips are mouthing the lyrics and realises that if he

“Can I…”
The smell of damp earth fills his nose, and he has to duck slightly to fit, and then even more to avoid having his hair brush against the crumbling mud ceiling. He grimaces, cursing Potter violently and wondering why he was so quick to give in to his whims, then crushes that train of thought before it reaches a troubling destination, resignedly picking his way through rotting leaves and tangles of protruding roots carpeting the tunnel ground.
The dusty crescents pressed beneath Harry’s verdant eyes betray his fatigue, but they hold Draco’s own with a campfire-like affection, and his boyish grin is languid and easy as he pulls Draco in to loop his arms around his waist. Draco, in turn, settles his arms over Harry’s broad shoulders and allows himself to sink into their embrace when Harry does.
“You don’t have to be,” he says. “I know he was a bastard to you and your friends.”
Draco sinks further into the shadows at the edges of the Great Hall.

quite knew why he was given guardianship over a child, either, but he was close friends with my father, so I suppose he felt he owed it to him.” Draco purses his lips. He lifts his robes slightly as he steps over a particularly large root, then drops them with a sigh. “He’d come to the greenhouses to pick up some fluxweed, which no one ever bothers with unless it's a full moon, which is why we’d chosen that particular greenhouse in the first place. Of course, because I’m just that lucky, I hadn’t realised it was actually a full moon that night and Daphne had her teeth lodged in my neck when I looked up and met his eyes through the glass.”
“Thank you, then,” he says, and it’s only a little stilted. “I’m sorry that you’ve lost people, too.”
For all his furtiveness, his movement could still draw somebody’s eye - or he could trip over his own robes, and everyone would turn to stare at whatever idiot didn’t know how to walk properly (he’s
For possibly the twentieth time that evening, Draco’s heart skitters along the cliff’s edge of giving out altogether. Clutching his chest, he sits bolt-upright and spins his head around so quickly that he hears his neck crack in protest.

Draco makes a grab for it, catching the little ball in his fist (he allows himself a little bit of smugness at his not-too-shabby seeker skills), and uncurls his hand, examining Granger’s creation. It is, indeed, a snitch, intricately engraved, with sleek, gossamer wings, but it glimmers like a star in Draco’s palm, and when Harry leans over and taps his wand against it, it flashes through the entire rainbow.
“With-” Draco lifts his hands to gesture theatrically to himself in order to fully convey his current level of disbelief, notices that he’s still holding onto Potter’s hand, jerks back and flushes deeply and then coughs to cover up his embarrassment. “With

“I guess…” he begins slowly, “that “arrogant little snot” got a change of perspective.” He cautiously lets his posture relax from it’s rigid bookend-position, dragging his knees up to his chest and slouching into them, arms loosely encircling his bent legs. If Hagrid wants to chat before he begins beating him to a pulp, then Draco is just about lonely enough to oblige.
- Harry just shrugs.
Draco attempts to return the smile through the throbbing of the entire left side of his torso. He just about manages to croak out a “thanks” before his expression dissolves into a wince.

“Malfoy,” Potter says irritatingly-normally back. He eyes Draco with that characteristically baffled expression of his (Draco is ninety percent sure it’s his resting face) before his eyes slide to Hagrid. “I just came out here for some air.”

Hagrid quirks a smile. “I can see yeh doin’ it now.”
“Fifth- I was gonna say at least it wasn’t Umbridge, but I’m really not sure which is worse.”
“What?”
Then, from the unrecognisable corpse of his confidence, grew the festering parasite of paranoia and deeply-rooted self hate with which he now battles on a pretty-much-daily basis.
“This is weird.”

“Can…” He gulps. “Can I use your bathroom?”
Draco suddenly feels wrong footed (a paradoxically familiar and comfortable sensation to him, now) and scowls defensively. So what if he’s a bit out of the cultural loop?
Key word being “almost”.
“...Alright.” Draco, too, would very much like to avoid Granger if he can help it. He sets off to catch up with Potter.
As memories of detentions and forays into the Forbidden Forest flood his mind, he speculates wildly about whether or not Hagrid would fetch Filch to finally take him up on that long-standing offer of shackles and instruments of torture.
He stares again as Draco carefully runs his tongue over the tin lid, and Draco, suddenly self-conscious of his admittedly plebeian eating technique, lowers the lid and flushes.
Draco opens his mouth to make a surprised exclamation, but then remembers how hard Granger had decked him in Third year and can suddenly see it.

Faint, jovial cheers resound through their hiding place, and Draco stares past the greenhouse roof toward the soft, yellow light flickering from the windows of the Great Hall.
Draco blinks, trying to rationalise that in his mind. Then he remembers,
Draco edges towards him, back straight and hands fiddling anxiously with his robes at his sides.
“That’s something you’ve done before, then?”

“Alright, then, Malfoy,” Harry says, smirking and oh, Draco is
“Okay, I’m gonna be honest with you, Malfoy,” he says in a rush, not even giving Draco time to process that statement before he barrels on, “I’m not catching a breather so much as I’m running away.”
“Erm…” Draco stays still, glancing between Potter’s retreating back and the opposite direction. Potter pauses and looks over his shoulder. “The gates are that way,” he says lamely, gesturing to the right.
“We all went to the Yule Ball, Potter,” Draco scoffs, rolling his eyes to make up for the fact that he’s reddened as though suffering an allergic reaction and is screeching internally in bamboozled incomprehension and embarrassingly schoolgirl-ish excitement. Harry laughs.
He swallows, lets his eyes fall to Harry’s mouth too, and bites his lip. He can feel Harry’s gaze boring into him as he steels himself to ask. He sucks in a breath.
“Erm.” Draco swallows. “Why are we standing now?”
Once one to revel in the spotlight, he now feels overexposed when huddled in shadow.
They stop suddenly and Draco yelps again, but Harry lets go of one hand, using the other to spin Draco in a twirl and draw him back in again. Draco opens his mouth to snap at Harry to

He’d sent them off with his heart lodged in his throat, a smarting wrist, and surety that he wouldn’t sleep a wink that night for all his nervousness.

“It weren’ even the firs’ time I’d lost everythin’,” he pushes on doggedly, “I’d lost me Dad, I’d been expelled - only two years before, I’d been to Azkaban. A year before tha’, I’d lost Norbert... An’ people’ve always seen me as a monster, ‘cause of me height- Gallopin’ Gorgons, look a’ me, still cryin’ ov’r the past like it was yesterday.” He breaks off with a dry chuckle, taking a moment to scratch about his cavernous pockets for a handkerchief with which to roughly scrub at his eyes. Draco remains silent, watching Hagrid stuff the damp hankie back into his jacket. The older man blows out a weary breath. He turns back to Draco, and offers a sapped smile.
“We’re going to my place. I have a record player we can use.” His scowl deepens. “Plus, I’m starving.”
Draco looks down, clenching his jaw.
With that, he leans over Harry (and Does Not Think about the way his body is pressed against Harry’s back, because now he’s

for the inevitable moment someone acknowledges his presence with an AK.
It is possibly the least romantic way the question could’ve been asked, and Draco has to physically restrain himself from swooning.

“Yeah, why not?”
“Well, forgive me for not being a
“Uh, yea-” he clears his throat “-yeah, sure. Just down the hall then to the right. The white door, not the wooden one.”
And so, there he is at the 5th anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, watching people dine, dance and dab at their eyes with handkerchiefs from the darkest corner of the room, attempting to avoid the gaze of just about everyone and wishing he was safe at home in his poky cottage tucked far into the folds of the Welsh countryside.

“...Fair enough.”

An unbearably awkward silence falls between them.
- here, wait for the next chorus-”
The constant reminders of his cowardice – both in his inability to act, and through the barbed mouths of all those around him – ensured that Draco’s sense of self-worth was flattened, wrung out and pulverised, until it was well and truly dead.
“Chuck it over, then!”
Draco scowls. Potter sounds

With excruciatingly small shuffles, he edges towards the door, eyes darting about himself to check that no one has noticed. He jerks to a halt as the gaze of a stern-looking witch seems to land on him, but it slides off of his startled figure like oil off of water.

He’s stiffly making his way to the door when Harry calls out to him.
“Oh for fuck’s s-- are you
And he - the disgraced heir - lives alone in the middle of bloody nowhere, the only correspondence to his name being the bi-weekly letter-exchange with his old Transfiguration teacher, which he’s almost entirely certain she’d only dragged him into - kicking and screaming - out of pity.
“Y’know, this is kinda where I first met my godfather.”
Harry shifts from foot to foot. He scratches the back of his neck.
Harry smiles and gives his hand a gentle tug.
He doesn’t have to, it turns out, because Hagrid chooses that moment to sever the eye contact himself. The Half-Giant’s shoulders hunch, and his chin falls to meet his chest - Draco recognises the look of a man struggling to keep it together, having seen it in every reflective surface around his own home.
The years after the war had only worsened his anxieties. His father, condemned to life in Azkaban, hadn’t lasted the first year. His mother, meanwhile, was left roaming the Manor corridors like a ghost, mourning her sister and husband, eyes even more void of life than both of them combined.
Draco stares, and slowly shakes his head.
Deep barks of laughter echo around the tunnel, ringing in Draco’s ears as Harry doubles over from the force of his own mirth. His eyes have squinted almost completely shut with the way his lips have spread so wide that his smile stretches across his face. The
He wonders - and he hates that he has to wonder - what he’d done to deserve it. He feels self-consciousness coil around his chest, but then Harry’s hand slides around his waist and draws him closer and the tightness unfurls, just slightly, and he allows himself to breathe.
“Wait, what?”
Draco grasps the conversation opening with all the desperation of a man clinging to his childhood rival’s waist as they fly away from a fire that is almost literally alive.

When he’d returned to the Manor the summer after his fifth year, he’d come to the harrowing realisation that he could no longer call it home. With his father locked up, and the halls infested with the Dark Lord’s henchmen, Draco had learned very early on that he didn’t actually have anyone he could truly rely on, and as the stench of war oozed throughout the British Isles, Draco had sunk deeper and deeper into his personal swamp of isolation and despair.

Draco hums. That, he’s not entirely surprised by. He may have been, several years previous, but anyone with functioning eyeballs could see how much Potter loathed the limelight.

His heart - having just started to settle down - immediately resumes it’s frenzied jig, and he doesn’t waste a second in turning on his heel and speed-walking the Hell out of there.
The stars above him are clear and bright, blinking curiously at the mess of Malfoy sprawled out on the grass. He scans the expanse for his own constellation and gazes at it in sorrowful envy, wishing he were the one floating up there, beautiful and adored, against the inky indigo sky.
“Your speech?” he asks. Potter shrugs.
Immediately he wonders if he’s overstepped, if he even has the

to finally escape the crowd, only to be discovered by one of the people who had the most reason to hate him. He realises, then, that he’s in the perfect location to be murdered where no one one would hear his cries for help (though he was sure that if someone did come to his aid, they’d only end up facilitating his death once they’d seen whose pleas they had followed).

stares is enough to have him stifling a sob.
He’d supposed that everyone else to whom he’d sent the stewed fruits of his labour had better things to do than to answer the meagre apologies of an ex-Death Eater, and the whole affair had been almost entirely forgotten (that is to say, except for the nights when his regret battered his skull from the inside, like a pinball intent on keeping him solidly awake).

hands?
“Hm?”
“Never danced before, Draco?”
“Okay, yeah, so you can awkwardly stumble around a dance floor and tread on your partner’s toes a whole bunch. Good for you.” Draco sputters.
Potter had waited for him a little way ahead, and grins over his shoulder as Draco joins him, which does something odd to Draco’s blood pressure that he’d really rather not examine much closer. He starts walking again once Draco is beside him, and they carry on their way.
“Right, fuck it. That’s it.”
“The tongue might’ve been somewhere else,” he mutters.
He looks awfully young in the starlight, the pale, white beams stroking his dark tousels making him seem vulnerable and soft, but also unbearably weary with the way they highlight how his lips purse into an anxious frown, and wrinkle his forehead with lines Draco could remember from even their earliest years of school. Potter catches his eye from the corner of his vision, and gives a quick, wobbly grin, and Draco flushes at having been caught staring. He clears his throat.

Draco, taking a deep breath to push down his embarrassment, scoops up a spoonful of beans and pops it into his mouth.
Harry is staring again.
“When you’re, uh... When you’re done peeing or whatever, can I kiss you?”
It’s Minerva that he blames in that moment, for the fact that he’s there, back against the wall of the Entrance Hall, with the bottoms of his palms pressed to his eyes, as he tries desperately to prevent them from leaking. He remains in that pitiable stance for a few moments, listening to time pass with the tick-ticking of his heart, and mentally composing a stongly-worded letter to the Hogwarts Headmistress, kindly telling her to back the fuck off and let him wallow in hermitude in peace.
“Plus the music fucking sucks,” Potter adds with a particularly sour expression that shocks Draco into barking out an undignified laugh. Potter starts and whipped around at the sound, then grins with his bushy brows raised.
close friends?
“Well, what am I supposed to do?” he demands snippily. “I’m listening, aren’t I?”
Potter huffs a laugh.
Harry snickers over Draco’s diatribe, pulling Draco to face him and taking Draco’s other hand in his free one as well.
“We’ll have to leave to be able to listen to anything.”
“But also- the
“...Is there a problem?”
All at once, the tempo gentles, and Harry guides them into slow, sedate spin.

He’s sure that he could slip out unnoticed, if he’s careful enough. He

Draco suddenly finds the chip on his pinkie nail
he muses wryly.
They walk in silence, the air between them fraught with awkwardness - well. Draco’s certainly awkward, Potter doesn’t appear to care much about the fact that he’s walking side-by-side with his childhood bully, but Potter’s always been a bit of an odd duck, hasn’t he?
The Gryffindor plops stiffly onto the grass, pulling his knees up to his chest in a mirror of Draco and hugging his legs, rapping his fingers against his shin as he practically buzzes with nervous energy.
Then Potter slumps and blows out a sigh.

Potter accepts the offer.
He tugs himself from Harry’s grasp and turns to continue on through the tunnel. Harry joins him a moment later.
Harry awkwardly attempts fluffing up a throw pillow, then stuffs it on top of what looks like a discarded pair of boxers on his threadbare sofa as if Draco hadn’t seen it already.
With his upper-body performing it’s wearied chicken-dance (and he desperately prays that no one is around to see it), his legs begin a stumbling gait across the dewy field to the hidden gap behind the greenhouses. It’s a spot he remembers as the prime location for most of his randy teenage rendezvous; he shakes his head sharply as though he could physically fling those painfully awkward memories from his skull.
“Oh, uh. Third year? Towards the end? It was a bit of a shitshow, really, I mean-” Potter starts gesticulating animatedly as he speaks, which is strangely endearing even if his hands come dangerously close to whacking Draco in the face “-first Ron gets dragged off by a feral dog, then it turns out the feral dog is actually Sirius-bloody-Black in disguise,

It still hasn’t quite sunk in that Harry had invited him over in the first place, and now that here’s here, surrounded by tidbits and niknaks of Harry’s life, he can’t help but notice how intimate of a gesture it had truly been. If he wanted to, he could walk over the rug that Harry’d worn down to threads with his own feet, could take the dog-eared novel from the coffee table stained by Harry’s brimming mugs and settle on the sofa where Harry had probably curled up to sleep at least once or twice, turning through pages that Harry had thumbed seemingly a thousand times over before.

“Sure. Unless you’ve got somewhere else to be?”
The sudden intensity of the man’s gaze, open and dark, bares the vast library of his soul, from which Draco can read whole chronicles of old pain. Empathy and guilt cut deep into the Slytherin’s chest; it feels like the lacerations of a sectumsempra, and he grips at the clumps of grass beneath his fingers, stiffening in place to prevent himself from turning away.

Draco processes that statement. Then he gapes.
“Can I- ah…”

Hagrid doesn’t look any less concerned for his mental state at the excuse, and he stares at Draco for an uncomfortably long period of time. Draco squirms a little under his gaze. He’s suddenly transported back to the feeling of being a naughty school child awaiting the teacher’s verdict for an adequate punishment - the perplexity with which Hagrid surveys him now makes him feel as though his crime was to have been caught dribbling slug juice all over the library books, or something equally cretinous.

The night air is cool and crisp, and Draco flaps his arms about a few times in order for the chill to reach the damp patches at his pits.

The music has changed again in the time Draco had been gone, a new voice as smooth and deep as a breeze over an upbeat, electric hum that makes his skin tingle and his heart thud in quick, even beats.
At 22, however, he’s pitifully grateful when fellow magical-folk ignore him instead of hurling hexes the moment they see his cursedly distinctive hair.
“Is there something wrong?”
“Erm-” Harry tears his eyes away from Draco’s mouth and coughs awkwardly, spinning around to scratch through a drawer. When he turns back to face Draco again, he looks a little pink. He holds out a spoon, avoiding Draco’s eye. “...Thank you.”
Four years down the line, and he still had an ant problem in his garden due to the lingering sugar, two whole cupboards and a pantry dedicated entirely to said sugar, and had received exactly 3 replies to his peace offerings - an essay from Granger that could have easily been summarised in a simple “fuck off”, a jar of gelatinous purple gloop from Lovegood (he’d been unsure if that was an acceptance or rejection), and an invitation to tea from Professor McGonagall.

He shifts restlessly from foot to foot, and huffs a small, tired breath.

Harry quirks a brow at him.
Potter’s head springs up from his knee as though it’d shocked him, and he gapes at Draco with an expression of abject horror.

Hesitantly, awkwardly, he reaches out and puts a hand on Harry’s shoulder, squeezes briefly, then lets go. He swallows.

Draco opens his mouth to ask what in Circe’s good name Potter thinks he’s doing, but then decides that perhaps he shouldn’t interrupt when the man is spitting curses so violently they could very well manifest in actual magic.
Draco, in the meantime, glances around the lounge and struggles to comprehend the fact that he is currently sitting in the Circe-damned home of Harry James Potter.

Draco coughs and reaches up to rub at his eye to cover the fact that his face has flooded bright red.
Internally screaming about Gryffindors and their suicidal lack of self-preservation, Draco - against his better judgement - chucks Potter the stick. Potter catches it with the fluidity of a natural-born seeker and then does a

It isn’t like anything Draco’s heard before, and he finds that that isn’t a bad thing, though he’s only listening with half an ear. His attention, instead, is focussed on Harry’s blissed expression, the crooked smile on his plush lips and the devilish spark in his eyes behind his glasses as he nods his head to the music, hair flopping in tumbling tangles that Draco itches to run his fingers through.
Harry’s cottage is a mess. Draco’s not sure he expected any different.

Draco coughs. Potter jerks out of his tirade, hands mid-gesticulation, and looks over at him. Draco resolutely avoids his gaze, but those sharp, green eyes narrow suspiciously before widening to an impossible width.
’ he thinks resolutely,
While Draco is left reeling from this new, very disturbing information, Harry kicks a hole in the wall of the shack (the wood is rotted down to near-parchment thickness, but Draco still feels himself flush as he admires Harry’s strength and form) and beckons Draco through. For perhaps the third time that evening, Draco follows after Harry without question and Does Not Think about why he doesn’t question it.
“Impressive,” he murmurs. The snitch wriggles in his hold, before bouncing up and shooting off, still multicoloured among it’s monochrome counterparts. He watches it go, but startles and looks down when he feels a hand clasp his still-outstretched one.
“Are you quite done?” he snaps. Harry snorts. The air it moves fans across Draco’s cheek and it is only then that Draco realises how close they are, how he can almost count the dark lashes bordering Harry’s soft, viridian eyes, glossed over with a sheen of unshed tears of laughter, glittering with amusement-

isn’t an odd descriptor to use in reference to Potter). He hums.
Harry stands in the exact same spot Draco had left him in, tapping his foot against the grass, arms crossed over his chest, sharp jaw tight as he stares up at the darting snitches. He perks up immediately when Draco steps out of the cottage, shoulders relaxing instantly and frown lifting into a smile.
Potter shrugs.
“So,” he says, swinging his arms back and forth as he rocks on the balls of his feet. Draco stares.
“Nah - haven’t got a driver’s license - but I’ve cussed out enough Ministry authorities in my time and
“Do you have spoons?”
“-you’re-”
Draco peers at him from the corner of his eye.
He blows out a heavy sigh and stands, marching over to the sink and grasping at its rim with both hands, leaning over it to stare at himself in the mirror. The figure in the frame is pasty where his blotchy flush doesn’t reach. He looks drawn and thin, deep bruises beneath his eyes and lips dry, hair the same, hateful white as always. Grimacing, he brushes a smear of residual dirt from the tunnel from his shoulder and glumly meets the eyes of his reflection.

He once again hears Hagrid’s voice in his head, urging him to take the offer at face value, and despite himself he
Still. Call him a fool, but Hagrid’s openly kind expression makes him feel something akin to hope. And though he doesn’t fully believe him, he can’t deny that talking to Hagrid has… helped.
Draco startles. For a moment, he thinks he’d spoken aloud involuntarily, before he realises that it had actually been his companion (and if
“I didn’ think tha’ I’d ever hear of a Malfoy wishin’ ‘e weren’ a Malfoy,” he grunts, leaning back on his splayed hands and crossing one boulder-like ankle over the other, “Wha’ happened to that arrogant little snot tha’ used to swagger ‘round the castle like ‘e owned the place?”
, must be what trumps them all.
Harry stumbles when they land. Draco gracefully brushes down his robes. Harry glares back at him.
“Erm- Potter?”
“Is the party... not your scene?”
“Yeah, yeah, fuck off, I know it’s a mess.” He kicks a dirty teacup underneath the sofa, then curses at the distinct sound of shattering porcelain. “You hungry?”
Once again, he finds himself thoroughly regretting his floor-length ensemble.
, so…” Another shrug. He pokes a thumb over his shoulder. “Shall we?”
Draco hunches his shoulders, feeling his face flush.
He sees Harry’s eyes flick down to his mouth and his breath hitches.
“I-” He gulps thickly. “Ye- alright.”
He’s momentarily struck dumb, therefore, when Hagrid seems to come to a decision, which turns out to be settling down on the grass beside Draco and... staring up at the stars.
“You need to be educated in muggle culture, muggle culture is non-compatible with Hogwarts grounds, I want to be as far-the-fuck away from Hogwarts grounds
“I like it,” he rasps. He coughs into his fist.
“I’d seen him around before, but it was down this hall that we first met in person. He’d bitten Ron’s leg and dragged him all the way down here, so ‘Mione and I had to chase after him and, uh. Then I met him.”
Hagrid laughs, scrubbing at the drying tear tracks on his face, while Draco stares at him, unsure of whether his bones are rattling because of the thunderous volume of the Half-Giant’s mirth, or because he’s freaking out wondering if Hagrid would actually clobber him. Probably a bit of both.
“Is that a snitch?” Harry, laughing at his startled reaction (the bastard), nods.
“Oh, definitely Snape,” Draco says without hesitation. “I didn’t have to see Umbridge at Sunday lunch.”
Draco hesitates, nods, then speedwalks inside.

being goaded, “Prove it.”
Draco briefly entertains the idea of starting a “Finding My Former Enemies Relatable” jar. By now, he’s sure it’d already be half-full of knuts.
“Yes, Harry?”
The way Harry had looked at him certainly hadn’t made him feel the way he looks in the mirror. The way Harry had looked at him - had
Harry snorts.
“C’mon, then, you colossal twat.”
“I suppose,” he replies slowly, thinking of all the people who want him dead, and how all of them are “wondrously” yet to succeed.
“Erm…”
When they finally emerge from the tunnel, they end up in a musty, dilapidated, woodworm buffet that Harry claims is the Shrieking Shack. He then explains to a Definitely Not Spooked Draco that no, the screams the villagers had heard from it were not made by angry spectres, but by a teenaged Remus Lupin as he tore himself apart every full moon being unable to hunt other people as his wolf-form instinct would otherwise drive him to do.
He feels vaguely off-kilter, and a bit raw, possibly due to this being the longest conversation he’s had in five years, but also… something in the Gamekeeper’s speech has warmed something in his chest, calmed him in a way that is entirely unfamiliar. Hagrid’s voice had been so earnest, so
Somehow, despite the muted pace, Draco feels dizzier than he had when they’d been spinning like hooligans mere seconds ago, and the nerves he feels flutter in his stomach make him worry he’ll throw up his beans all over Harry’s robes.
The narrowness of the tunnel means their shoulders are pressed against each other, and though the air is frigid, the whole side of Draco’s arm that is in contact with Potter’s feels as though it’s burning. The silence in which they’re walking only serves to make him even more hyper aware of that particular stretch of skin, which is yet another thing that he definitely does not want to examine, so he fishes around for a conversation starter to break the tension just so that he Does Not Have To Think About It.
“You, ah - you mean you’ve never…”
Draco doesn’t think it possible for him to be any more mortified. He knows he has a habit of speaking aloud to himself (probably the result of extended loneliness) but the fact that Hagrid had heard his self-loathing mutterings makes him wish the Half-Giant would stomp on him already and get the murdering over with.
“Yeah, well, I can’t tell you how much I wish I’d taken more of an opportunity to sass Voldemort before he AKed me- wait, this is the best part.”
It’s… strange, hearing his own words from someone else’s mouth. He’d never thought before that he could have something in common with the Half-Giant, though he supposes his previous prejudice had caused him to view them both as worlds apart. There’s something like comfort - an odd kinship in knowing that they’re not so different, that

“It really is a wonder to be alive,” he murmurs, closing his eyes serenely as the wind’s light fingers play with his silvering beard.

Harry pokes his shaggy head back in not too long after - by which time Draco has finished his beans - and grins.
“Yeh said yeh got a change in perspective,” Hagrid says. “Try changin’ it again. Look beyond yerself and yer self-loathin’. The world is bigger than tha’. Yeh’ve jus’ gotta see it, now.
“I- agh-” he clears his throat, face flooding with heat, “I... didn’t think anybody would hear.”
Mouth dry, Draco nods.
Even having to look up at him, he’s never seen Hagrid look so small.
Eventually, once his pulse has almost synchronised with the forced rise and fall of his chest, Draco blows out a long, quivering breath.
Draco thinks, frustratedly straightening the back of his robes,
“...I know this place,” he murmurs. Then he blinks. “Holy mother of Merlin.”
“Ow! What the

house? Known only by
Hagrid seems to have heard the cynicism in his tone, because he blinks open his eyes and turns to face Draco fully. His stern expression arrests the younger man’s attention completely, leaving Draco feeling a little chastised. His next words, however, fill him to the brim with shame.
Draco finds himself gaping at the man once again, though Hagrid appears perfectly at-ease, shuffling around until he’s comfortable, the cracks of his joints echoing around the pair of them like thunderclaps.
Laid out before him, like a scene from a storybook, is a sweeping lawn, glistening silver and green in the lustre of a hundred tiny lights flitting overhead, leaving trails of golden sparks in their wakes. A whimsical arch entwined with apple trees leads to a trio of growing patches, boasting tumbles of bright blooms, tufts of herbs and neat rows of vegetables respectively. The terrace of honeyed pine where they stand is bordered by a brick barbeque and outdoor table on one end and a cluster of beanbags on the other.
Draco shakes Hagrid’s overly optimistic voice from his mind, but decides to bite the
Unfortunately, five years of self-imposed isolation means that his conversational skills are utter shite, as demonstrated by the near-one-sided talk Hagrid had had with him earlier and the stilted exchange he’d had with Potter after that.
Still in complete disbelief that this is a genuine conversation he’s having, Draco blinks several times before his brain can conjure up a coherent answer.
Draco narrows his eyes at him. Then he magnanimously decides to overlook Harry’s Gryffindorish eccentricities and goes back to his dinner.
“Nope,” he says. “Just-” He makes a strange noise like a snorting cough and slaps a hand over his mouth to stifle it. Draco frowns at him, concerned. “Just really glad you’re enjoying those beans,” Harry says, voice oddly strained.
Decked out in a suit of truly horrible brown corduroy, the Hogwarts Gamekeeper looms over the cowering Malfoy (his natural state, it seems) like a badly dressed cousin of the Whomping Willow.
“Wait, when was that?”
Whilst being a blessing, the sudden cold is a jarring contrast to the suffocating heat of his own skin, and he begins to feel lightheaded. Pressing the heel of his palm to his temple, he lowers himself weakly onto the lawn and tries to gather his bearings.
The first few notes cry out into the night air, lilting and defiant, before the rumbling of percussion begins, crashing into the twanging of strings.
’ Draco thinks as he attempts a polite smile and the wrinkled duo shuffles speedily away as though expecting him to turn his baby-murdering ways on the elderly next.
“Obviously, tha’ harpy Skeeter was there takin’ notes  - though yeh’d know about tha’, wouldn’t yeh?” Hagrid’s pointed glare is enough to have Draco wincing. He opens his mouth to apologise, but the Professor flaps a dismissive hand in his direction and stares back out to the sky.
Harry grins, impish and bright, and tilts his head to the side.
Draco chokes on a glob of spit. He coughs, red-faced.
Draco, as always, stares at it.

He’s mildly surprised, therefore, that the old Gamekeeper actually remembers the gesture.
A couple of minutes later finds him sitting on the lid of the toilet, staring at the door in front of him and wondering what would be an appropriate length of time to wait before he can leave.
“You alrigh’ there, Malfoy?”
He feels Harry’s thumb caress the base of his spine, and when he looks up to meet Harry’s eye, his breath catches.
you choose to run out of charge?!”
After finally admitting defeat, he had traipsed out into his garden to calm his nerves and had slouched beneath the wild blackberry bush that blankets his fence. He'd been munching morosely on the juicy morsels when he had suddenly been struck by an idea.

“Okay, brill.”
This, Draco muses, would be worth at least a dozen knuts in the “Finding My Former Enemies Relatable” jar.

He sighs and drags a hand down his face. At least then, he might’ve felt that his life held some meaning.
“My iPod doesn’t work on the grounds.”
His mind goes blank.
as a result of that kindness.

Potter shuffles on his bum, looking distinctly awkward.
He feels Harry stare at him, puzzled. “Severus was my godfather,” he elaborates. Harry chokes.

“Uh, Draco?” Draco could hear the frown in Ernie’s voice. “Is there something you wanted to tell me?”
“Coming right up,” Draco chirped, high on rush hour adrenaline and far too much espresso. He seldom took advantage of his easy access to decent coffee, but he certainly wasn’t a morning person, even on the best of days, and having to force himself out of bed at silly o’clock after barely sleeping a wink… Well, let’s just say that, sometimes, a perfect shot of espresso really was the only remedy.
Harry closed his eyes, his nostrils flaring, but then he shook his head. “I can’t.”
Draco’s eyes flashed. “Bedroom’s upstairs, right?”
The stern look she gave him would’ve had Draco nodding even if it hadn’t been his plan all along. He grinned. “Oh, fuck yes. It’s been far too long since—”
“Yeah, but…” Just because Harry was helplessly smitten by his gorgeous roommate didn’t mean Malfoy would ever feel the same.
After Mother passed away, I thought I’d never set foot in this town again. Just the idea of it hurt, coming here without her by my side. But I guess I should have known better, all things considered.
He’d thought so, not that it really mattered. Draco knew no promised book bargains would ever manage to instigate anything like the sudden shopping frenzy Madam Malkin was referring to. And neither was the opening of a new shop, Muggle-inspired or not. No, the craze was all about him, about his return, no matter how much he wished it otherwise.
Thanks for telling me Andromeda wrote her sister back. When I left her place that weekend, she still hadn’t decided if she would or not. After all, it was the first she’d heard from Narcissa since their parents shunned her, so I totally get if she was feeling wary about accepting the invitation to reconnect. Glad she did, though. I’d like to think the knowledge of you and me having been in touch this entire time encouraged her. Yeah, she knows too. As if I could keep it from her after asking her to play me your
Her use of his first name caught his attention, and he smiled weakly. “Dragonfire. I got him out.”

But, you know me; why do it now when you can do it later, yeah? Usually works pretty well too, until there’s suddenly no later left to… D’you know if there’s a cure to recurrent
“I’m sorry,” Harry’s soft voice came with the cold rush of air from the doorway behind him. “You’re right. I was going to say that’s not what I meant, but maybe it was. I just… I’m having a hard time reconciling what I knew of you before to who you are now.” Harry stepped closer, rounding Draco and pausing only a foot in front of him. He tilted his head to meet Draco’s gaze and stuck out his hand with a conciliatory smile.
“Oh, the baby,” she cooed at Smaug. “Give him to Auntie Slyvia, please.” She reached for the fox who let out a laughing bark as Slyvia picked him out of Draco’s arms and immediately began to rub his stomach. Draco smiled and went back to his tree, Slyvia following behind him.
“Besides, what?” she prodded.
“Oh.”
You’ve filled out since then, no longer the lanky, troubled shell of a boy you were in our sixth year, and somehow your hair looks healthier and happier too. It’s longer, not severely slicked back the way you once wore it, but falling loosely over your temples, the silky locks framing your face and softening your sharp, chiselled features. I’d do anything for a chance to bury my fingers in those locks, to brush my lips over your perfect skin, to press my body against yours.
Draco drew a deep breath, willing himself to calm the fuck down. A colossal mistake, since it only resulted in a fresh assault of his senses by the heady scent permeating the bedding — the scent of Harry. Earthy, spicy, sexy, safe.
Smiling, Harry nodded and shoved his hands in his pockets, his eyes still on Draco’s. “I made it for you. I kept thinking about you and your mother, about your happy times together, and I wanted to at least try to give that to you again.”
You seem to think I like this whole celebrity nonsense… And now that I think about it, maybe you always have? Well, I don’t. In fact, nothing can be farther from the truth. Did you know I have to polyjuice myself every time I want to visit Diagon Alley without being overrun by
He gathered his resolve and took a deep breath, unintentionally inhaling a lungful of the smoke still lingering in the fabric of his clothes. It clawed at his windpipe and made his eyes water, but he didn’t care. He was too preoccupied trying to make his trembling legs hold his weight as he scrambled to stand.
to have a good time. It’s only when they’re comfortable and relaxed in your company that they will be able to focus on getting to know you and, even more importantly, able to start showing you their true self. You want to sweep them off their feet, and that’s not done through awkward silences or anxious tension. You’ll both be jittery enough as it is, without that extra level of nervousness.”
“You’re still… And we’re… What if Teddy…?”
When the animal didn’t come running, Draco stuck his head around the doorframe, spotting the russet pile of fur still curled up on the bed. The knocking came again, and Draco turned his attention to the living room instead, where a handsome, long-eared owl stood on the windowsill, eyeing him impatiently. Draco rushed over to let the bird in.
Sirius sat quietly, but Draco avoided looking at him, afraid of what he’d see.
He opened the window and stuck his head out into the spitting rain. Hell, it wasn’t even rain, but some sort of half-frozen sleety mess that stuck to his face in wet clumps as it fell.
Sent: Yes, I'm sure you do. Regardless, go piss off someone else. Or at least, tell me who you are
The dreams returned. Sometimes several nights in a row, sometimes weeks apart, but always the same; the same man; the same sensations; the same feelings there to comfort him whenever he woke up. Safety. Love. Desire. Acceptance. Care.
“Er, sure.” Harry waited in the living room as Draco went to serve Smaug his dinner. When he returned, Draco found him with a thoughtful look on his face. “So, who is this Slyvia character? I passed her on my way up. She’s…” — He paused, looking like he searched for an appropriate word choice — “pretty.”
Draco sighed in relief. He would be forever grateful to his mother for taking all that time teaching him Occlumency the summer after Fourth Year, but Bellatrix was said to be a talented Legilimens, one of the best even. If she decided to read him, Draco had no idea how long he’d be able to resist her mental onslaught.
"Mmm," Draco says, opening his mouth to suck at Harry's tongue. He pulls back after too short a moment, bumping his nose into Harry's. "Did you bring your broom?"
I should have guessed you played the piano. I bet you’re really good at it too, what with your long, dexterous fingers and you being all studious and determined. I’d never have the patience to learn to play an instrument, even if I sometimes wish I could. I’m more of an intuitive, can-or-can’t kind of guy. Merlin, you should’ve seen me when Snape tried to teach me occlumency. Total disaster, I tell you. Knowing how to play an instrument would’ve been cool, though. Maybe there’s a simple one I could learn how to master? Like the drums or something? Or a guitar? Is it hard to learn how to play the guitar?
Draco reluctantly released him, and Harry stepped into his pyjama bottoms before going over to the dresser in search of something for Draco to wear. He couldn’t very well put on yesterday’s clothes, could he?
Harry watched Draco sit down at the Slytherin table, Zabini and Davis taking the vacant seats on either side of him. They didn’t talk to anyone else, just ate their breakfast while speaking quietly to one another over eggs, toast, and steaming cups of tea.
Draco’s other hand stroked unreadable patterns over Harry’s back, pausing every now and then to squeeze one shoulder here, one arsecheek there, searching its way up into Harry’s unruly locks, running neatly trimmed nails over Harry’s scalp, grabbing a fistful of hair and tugging slightly, making Harry gasp.
I don’t know why I keep blabbering, probably in an attempt to keep your mind off your bloody Father. And to keep mine off the fact that I’ve just offered you to move in, to stay. Indefinitely. “Now, where do you think we should go first? Twilfitt and Tatting’s? Flourish and Blotts? Quality Quidditch Supplies? Scribbul—”

He patted Draco’s shoulder and stepped back. Draco was reeling, his mind in tumult, but he managed to smile and thank the man before the Minister left to join his wife.
"And then what did you have in mind?" Harry asked, his voice husky.
Draco closed his eyes and tried to relax, but he feared it was going to be a long night.

- Harry
Harry closed the rest of the distance and crushed his mouth to Draco’s, his soft lips pressing and teasing and...well, Draco’s mind shut down.
“Yes.” Draco took it out and turned it over in his hands, letting it travel between his fingers for a moment before taking the time to actually look at it for the first time in quite a while. It was old and worn now, every sharp ridge smooth after years of apprehensive caresses, every detail blurred from countless worried strokes by the pad of a thumb in search of reassurance. The surface positively gleamed in the soft lamplight, as if polished to perfection and ready to join Mother’s silverware for Christmas dinner. “I got it the evening before my departure for Hogwarts.”
Draco opened his mouth to reply, but nothing came out.
What the fuck?
Harry chuckles. “Yeah, quite a bit.”
“Okay, okay. Relax, will you?” Harry throws a nervous glance around the place, hoping no one’s caught their conversation. “Please, do impart your superior dating knowledge, o esteemed Master.”
Draco's conspiratorial wink earned him a nervous smile in return. “Okay, sounds good.”
“So,” Harry murmurs, dizzy from the nearness of Draco’s solid body and the spicy scent of his cologne. “I believe I owe you ten Galleons.”
It was hard to tell with the sound of the rain surrounding them, but Draco thought he heard a slight agreement come from the man next to him. The sight of the office building emerging from the darkness ahead felt like a relief, like an encouraging beacon in the awkward silence that had suddenly managed to wedge its way between them. Eventually, Harry was the one to break it, but not until they were only about a hundred yards away from the front door.
“Yeah, I did,” Teddy confirmed with a vigorous nod as Draco’s hot breath brushed the shell of Harry’s ear.
Received: That's what I want for my b-day...
Sitting up, Draco withdraws his fingers and wipes them on the towel he'd set nearby, then reaches for the Lubrication Potion. "You already cast the protection spell?"
Harry chuckles and moves around the small table to take a seat on the chair next to mine. “Because I love knowing I still have the ability to get a rise out of you, and”— I narrow my eyes at him —“because you’re absolutely adorable when you go into that indignant lecture mode of yours.”
I had planned to marry Charlie, but I married Harry instead. Thank Merlin my mother was right; life doesn’t always turn out the way we plan. And Harry took me back to Florence, to the city I once thought I’d never be able to enjoy again, and he proved me wrong. He’s given me all I’ve ever wanted, and more; a home, a family, friendship, companionship — and an everlasting love.
He’d never once wished for that before. Even after he started to really enjoy his time in the Scottish school, he had always looked forward to coming home to Wiltshire every chance he got. And he still had a hard time imagining spending the holidays at Hogwarts, or anywhere else for that matter, but after what happened on Christmas Eve…
At one end of the table, Ginny was relating her latest match to Angelina. Or, maybe attempting to relate was closer to the truth, considering the constant interruption of questions from young Fred. At the other end, George did his best to persuade Roxanne to at least taste the chicken before rejecting it, all the while trying to keep his mother from noticing her grandchild’s scepticism about the food. When Molly turned to Arthur to tell her about some blue apron she was altering for her cousin Teedle, Draco felt a tingle at the nape of his neck and looked across the table to find Harry’s intense green eyes on him. Draco raised a questioning eyebrow and Harry raised his own, then let his eyes drift from one family member to the next before meeting Draco’s gaze again with a grin.
“It felt really damned good to be part of a family again. I haven’t had that in a long time, and even when I did, it wasn’t like
PS You make it sound like Bulstrode’s got a crush on someone or something.
Harry climbs the steps to the Owlery, the pulling in his chest simultaneously loosening yet becoming even more pressing. The urgency has spread, taking over his whole body, driving him forward, step by step, to the top of the tower.
Anyway, you wanted to know about school. It’s all right, I guess. Many new teachers, of course, after everything. McGonagall has done a great job recruiting them too, and she’s even managed to persuade Binns to retire (finally!). Feels strange without you here, though. You might have been a royal pain in the arse since day one, but… I guess Hogwarts just isn’t the same without your haughty sneer to get on my nerves.
Harry had made this? For him?
Sent: You must allow me to tell you how ardently I despise and abhor you.
"I want you to fuck me."
“Charlie!” the woman Draco recognised as Molly Weasley cried. “My baby!”
They still lived in Muggle London, far away from the wizarding world’s probing eyes, and even if they socialised with their old wix friends more often these days, they seldom ventured into any public spaces if they could help it. They still valued their anonymity too much to expose themselves to the inevitable assault on their privacy.
Draco finally met his eyes again. “I’ll go over and tell them tonight.”
Harry let out a little huff and began picking up the clothes lying around the room, carrying them to the laundry hamper. Back in the kitchen, Draco cast a spell to get the dishes washing, then noticed a putrid smell coming from the small cooling cupboard. He opened it and groaned. There were nearly fifteen containers of Indian takeaway, all in varying states of decay. The man hadn’t even bothered to cast decent Preservation Charms on his leftovers. How long had they been here?
“You’d be surprised.” Sirius smirked, but when Draco raised his eyebrow in question, the man just waved it away. “Anyway, I’ll tell them, but let’s wait a bit longer. Please,” he added as Draco opened his mouth to disagree. “Once we see Charlie’s about to wake up, we’ll tell them, and then they’ll be so happy to see Charlie that they won’t mind a bit.”
An image unfurls in Harry’s mind, an image of himself, naked, his legs wrapped around Draco’s hips while large, white wings smelling of caramel flap through the open sky, keeping them aloft.
. Harry pulls his knees up, urging his boyfriend, his mate, onwards. "Merlin, yes.
Right. Well, at least Draco could be honest about this part. “At the Reserve. I work for the foundation that runs it.”
Reaching the doorway, Harry stopped, his eyes immediately drawn to the bearded old man looking down at Harry’s godson with a concerned look on his face. In his signature outfit, he’d surely be the centre of attention anywhere, but where most people would focus on the red velvet fabric and the white fur trim, the black boots and broad leather belt, all Harry could see was the rosy blush on those cheeks, a flush of colour against his white-blond locks, and those perfect happy wrinkles at the corners of his sparkling silver-grey eyes.
— ☕ —
Harry’s mouth twitched at the corner. “That’s what they all thought. But then, they didn’t factor in your brilliant brain.”
He looked up and met Draco’s eyes.
But yeah, I probably should have told them why I asked them to pose for that photo. And believe me, I did plan to, but once the time came, I just… couldn’t. I bet they would have loved being able to send you their love and birthday wishes, though. Just as you would’ve been thrilled to receive them.
“I wish I—” Potter sighed. “Merlin, you’re just a kid.”
But I don’t.
Being the benevolent man that he is, there’s nothing left for Harry to do but to bring it out of its misery. So, he grabs Draco’s hips and pulls him closer, feeling a rush of heat shoot through him as their cocks align once more. Draco gasps and Harry is quick to capture that lower lip between his teeth, nibbling on it long enough for Draco to open up and allow him inside. The kiss is fierce; hot, wet, and all-consuming. When Draco tangles his strong hands into Harry’s locks and eventually pulls them apart, they’re both flushed and panting. Draco’s voice is rough when he speaks.
And his eyes… His eyes had been bleak, and when they’d turned to meet Harry’s, there had been no hope to find in their misty-grey depths. Harry will never forget them. They reminded him of how Sirius’s had looked that first time they met.
Harry’s eyes crinkled in laughter. “Several times. So can we talk? Please? I have something I wanted to ask you.”
Received: Sorry again. I didn’t mean to pass out like that.
Harry reaches down and picks up his now oddly-shaped companion while Draco summons their clothing from the top of the tower. Harry pulls on his hoodie and returns the snake to his pouch.
"Draco," Harry breathes, trying to hold on to his sanity. But it's futile, all he can do is go along for the ride.
Received: Nope, I'm your favourite Gryffindor 🦁
“You’re fabulous. You know that, right?”
, love.”
. Jaw clenched, Draco nodded and slunk past the heavy brocade, all senses on high alert.
“We are,” he murmurs next to Draco’s ear, increasing the pressure of his grinding against Draco’s rapidly swelling cock. “Just getting us ready now.”
“Uh, yeah, that’s why I called. Would you mind? I have about four cases, and I can’t shrink them or make them lighter due to the contents. It should only take us two trips.”
Now, you don’t even notice the cuckoo clock. And I can’t be bothered to come up with a guess on its value. What’s the point if we’re not doing it together? This used to be the highlight of my week; you and me together in front of the telly, pointlessly arguing over silly antiques. It was familiar and comforting. Bloody perfect. And now you’ve gone and ruined it all by bringing
find this new, grown-up version of the guy disturbingly attractive too. So what? It wasn’t like it mattered or anything. No way could
Draco hated the manor.
I keep the walls from falling down, but their foundations are shaking as I retreat to the relative safety of our kitchen.
Harry takes a deep breath through his nose, reining in his racing heart. His walls have required more maintenance lately, what with his restless yearning constantly tearing at them from the inside, constantly trying to climb them in a desperate need to escape the claustrophobic confines of his heart and reach out to Draco with all its might. “No, I—”
Arthur cleared his throat. “Do you suppose one of us should, er…check? Just to make sure it’s there? You know, for Harry’s sake?”
“Well.” Malfoy’s perfectly formed eyebrow rises high towards his hairline. “You’re obviously not to be trusted with a mission like that on your own. Now, where do you want to go today?”
“Y-yes, Master Draco,” Minette said, shifting her weight from foot to foot. “Snatchers is delivering captives, sir. Says one of them may be, um, H-Harry P-Potter.”
Pansy picked up the coat and slipped it on, the coat nearly dropping to her feet. “Nice,” she murmured, spinning around. “I think this is dragonhide. I bet it’s part of the reason he survived.”
The room suddenly felt like someone had sucked all the air out of it, and every head turned to stare at Draco. Hell, he’d practically turned to stare at himself, it was so unplanned.
“And by saving me, he saved Daenerys,” Charlie insisted. “She’s my favourite.” He sighed happily and looked back at Draco, his gaze intense. “Thank you. You really are my hero, aren’t you?”
“Yeah, you know us.”
He raised the cup to his lips and took one first sip, letting out an appreciative moan as his eyes fluttered shut, seemingly of their own volition.
“I’m glad she did,” Harry said, shuffling to mirror Draco’s position. “In fact, no matter how hard I tried, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about you ever since you left.”
“You’re just a big softie, aren’t you?” Draco smiled and patted its head, then reached into his pocket, pulling out the large sandwich Pansy had pushed onto him before kicking him out of the ballroom.
“Don’t you
— and pushed off from the doorframe with his shoulder, retreating to the safety of his kitchen as fast as his legs could carry him.
Harry pressed his palm against Draco’s broad chest and drew back, feeling dazed and breathless.
“Don’t you give me that virtuous act. You, sir, are a liar.” Draco sat down across from Sirius and crossed his legs. “And you’re fired.”
Draco's arms wrapped around Harry's waist and he rested his chin on Harry's shoulder, looking out at the sea. "You like it? It's just us out here for the next three days."
“I— Yeah. Right. I can do that.”
Draco blinked, not having been invited aboard Harry’s train of thought. “Do what?”
But Fleur simply smiled. “It’s fine. Oui, that’s how it is with Bill and me. But don’t forget I’m Veela, which makes it a bit different for us, too. See, my magic helped me find the person I was most compatible with. It pulled us together.”
Draco nodded. “Most of the keepers have one like it for that exact reason.”
For those of you who have read my fic
“I mean, there are hugs, and then there are
Harry groans and turns his gaze to the ceiling, covering his face with his hands. Not that Draco doesn’t know Harry’s bi, but the less the man knows about the object of his affections, the better. Ignoring the fluttery feeling in his stomach, Harry steels himself and pushes his hands through his hair before turning to look at Draco. “…and I’m not going to.”
Cynthia had seemed really into him when they met a few weeks ago at Seamus and Dean’s New Year’s party. And yet, it only took her three dates for the usual ‘I’m sorry, Harry, I don’t think we should see each other anymore,’ to escape her lips.
Draco shook his head. “No, not yet. But they invited me to celebrate Christmas with them tonight. Sirius is supposed to meet me here at seven, so I still have a little while to figure it out before I—”
“M’not.” Teddy’s voice was firm and… much closer than it had been only moments before. Harry looked over his shoulder to find the boy standing in the doorway with his arms crossed in front of his chest. “It’s really him.”
Instead, he watches in awe as Draco’s eyes darken from his touch, as his gaze grows more intense than Harry ever thought possible. He watches as Draco’s angelic features tense, as his sharp jaw clenches, and he realises Draco is trying to hold something back, fighting desperately to keep his true feelings from his face. Harry can’t help the smug smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. “Tell me.”
Frankly, I don’t know why I haven’t told anyone about you yet. When your first letter arrived, we were all in the middle of the pre-term chaos and I figured I could always tell them about it later. I never would’ve thought we’d keep writing to each other like this, months later, but now that we do… Circe, I can only imagine how pissed off they’re going to be once they find out I’ve been keeping this from them for so long. I know I’ll have to say something eventually, but since I still have no idea how best to tell them, I’m afraid you’ll have to remain ‘my dirty little secret’ for a while longer, if you don’t mind.
“Really?” Hermione’s eyes twinkle and Malfoy smirks. “So why don’t you teach him how to do it?”
I’m sitting outside today. Spring is finally here and the bright blue sky of the Great Hall this morning was so perfect I just knew I had to get out of the castle. Sure, writing’s a bit awkward out here without a proper desk, but hopefully, you’ll still be able to read my scrawl. I promise I’ll do my best to keep it legible this time.
Pansy let out a long whistle. “Wow.”
"Hey, no fair!" Hermione complains from behind them. "Draco's far worse about this than I am. I had a date night with Ron just last Saturday."
Sounds like Narcissa is doing all right, all things considered. Good. I’m glad to know you have her there with you. Hopefully, the rest of the year won’t be as hard on you now that you have some company. I don’t know if she was offered the same deal as you were, but I totally get your reasoning for not wanting to tell her about our letters. If it were me, I’d be hesitant too.
“Just need to take Charlie’s things back to his cottage,” Draco said, already on his way out the door. “Don’t mind me.”
Dream boy Malfoy,
Draco lets out a long, satisfied hum that travels through Harry's body like the tremors of an impending earthquake, quickening Harry's pulse. The accompanying smirk is almost too much.
Draco didn’t know what to say to that, so he stayed quiet, waiting, heart thumping wildly in his chest.
“Just think about it,” she said lightly and returned to her waiting crate.
“Great.”
The first time Draco’s childhood nemesis entered Beans & Serendipitea, Draco had been sure of two things.
The Ministry is organising a War Memorial Ceremony tomorrow, some huge pretentious thing that’s supposed to raise people’s spirits and remind everyone of how happy we all should be now that all our differences are left in the past. As if they were. As if everything’s just peachy now. As if everyone’s suddenly the best of friends just because Riddle’s gone. I don’t know why they think people would be encouraged by being reminded of all the loved ones they’ve lost, of all the hatred and fear they used to feel against each other not that long ago. I wish I could opt out, that I wouldn’t have to attend, but apparently, the ‘hero of the wizarding world’ is the only person who doesn’t have a choice in the matter. Apparently, my presence on that bloody stage will somehow ensure eternal peace among witches and wizards throughout the country, if not the whole continent. Yeah, I know; it’s fucking ridiculous.
As will I. No, I don’t want us to sweep our entire past under the rug. If we did that, it’d always remain there, lurking and waiting for a chance to crawl out and bite us in the arse when we least expect it. Rather, I was hoping we’d be able to open the door and set it free, let it run away to bother someone else for a while. And if it happened to get lost somewhere out there, all the better. I can’t say I’d miss it. Would you?
Charlie was clearly waiting for a reaction, though, so Draco scrambled for a response. “I suppose just a bit for Christmas would be understandable.”
“It wasn’t a big deal—” Draco started, but a Healer entering the room cut him off.
Forcing the mental images aside, Draco took a deep breath and slowly turned his head to look at the man who had starred in all his wet dreams and dirty fantasies for as long as he could remember. He swallowed. Harry was standing so close Draco was able to make out every single one of his long, inky-black lashes, every speck of gold glimmering in those impossibly green eyes.
A door opened behind him and someone entered. Draco didn’t have to turn around to know who it was. Of course it was Potter. Of course it was. No one else better suited to make this fucking day even worse than it already was.
But, he reminds himself, Draco doesn’t seem surprised to see him here. And he hasn’t told him to go away.
Received: Then why don't you come over here and save me from all these drinks these people I once called my friends keep buying me?
Harry opened his mouth to answer, then his face turned red, and he averted his gaze. “It seemed reasonable at the time.”
I’ve been trying to keep up with the conversations all night, trying to stay alert enough to put in my two Sickles’ worth every now and again, to appear as if nothing’s the matter. But you’re seated right next to me, making it impossible for me to focus on anything but your nearness. Our friends speak of Quidditch, and all I can think about is your knee mere inches from mine, your shoulder almost touching mine, your muscular forearm, bare after you rolled your sleeves up half an hour ago, close enough to brush against mine if I only moved my elbow the slightest bit. I can even sense your body heat caressing my skin, and for the umpteenth time tonight, I tear my eyes from where your elegant fingers move distractedly along the delicate stem of your wine glass.
“Hey…” Draco leans over to place his mug on the coffee table, then turns in his seat to face Harry, one leg bent over the cushion between them, his knee mere inches from Harry’s thigh. “You can’t mean that, Harry. Aren’t you Gryffindors supposed to be romantic optimists?”
“So you’ll do it?”
“Smell?” Draco frowns. “You can smell them?”
So, as it was, it was no surprise to Draco when he realised he was late for his own wedding.
Somewhere, someone is keening. There's no other word for it; the long, drawn-out sound that rips through the bedroom and speaks of unbelievable pleasure.
Draco chuckled. “We’ve met, yes.”
Orion turns his head to meet Harry's gaze. "
“You too. Good Luck.”
Before Draco could have any response to that, even in his own head, a commotion at the door had him whipping around. Hannah Abbott had sunk to the floor, her mouth open in shock as she’d evidently been listening in on the conversation.
“More like starting over.”
Only the basics, of course, that we’ve been writing to each other since you got out of Azkaban at the beginning of the year. Nothing about the content of our letters or anything; that’s none of their business and never will be. My revelation was enough to render Hermione speechless for several minutes (which is not an easy feat, I tell you) while Neville’s jaw dropped to the floor and Seamus’ and Dean’s eyeballs nearly popped out of their sockets. Luna, Ginny, and Millie simply nodded, as if this was no surprise to them at all, while Ron, predictably, started to splutter, questioning my sanity. That is, until he noticed the unsurprised looks on Blaise’s and Theo’s faces and realised they’d already known — which was when his confusion morphed into plain outrage. (Honestly, I don’t know if he’ll ever forgive me for letting the snakes in on the secret before him, no matter how much I try to explain it was all by accident.) Meanwhile, Pansy stood in the corner, infuriating as ever, cradling a cup of tea in her hands and grinning like the kneazle that got the cream.
procasrtination? ‘Cause if there is, I obviously need it. Stat.
“Harry.” Charlie gave him a wry smile. “I distinctly remember you telling me over the summer just how much you wanted to close the book on the war. How you wanted a fresh start, a blank page.”
Received: 🦁💖🐍😘😉
among the spines in the bookshelf. Even the smells: butterbeer, broom polish, exploding snap cards… Draco had to concede it all felt a bit overwhelming.
for Draco. With his own hands. Unable to cope with any more of his confused thoughts, Draco turned back to Charlie. Charlie, the man he was about to marry.
“Ron! I’m eight months pregnant. Of course, I had to go. And thank you very much for announcing it to everyone.” She approached her mother-in-law with a slight waddle and put her arm around her waist. “The doctor said he’s going to be okay, Molly. You should sit down, though. It’s not good for your nerves to get this worked up.”
“Well, come on then.” Teddy tugged on Harry’s hand, already on the move again. “We have to hurry, or we’ll miss him!”
He knew he should come up with a witty reply, but he had no idea what he was supposed to say to a statement like that, so utterly Gryffindor-ish — bold and brave in a way Draco could only dream of being able to replicate. So he did what he’d always done, he turned to sarcasm.
Ginny laughed. “Probably
Harry tries to stand up but falls onto his arse, his jeans twisted awkwardly around his legs. That finally gets a coherent response from his boyfriend, and they both burst into laughter.
“Oh, Dad, yuck!” Ron moaned and hid his eyes in his hands. “No, please don’t.”
This time, I detect a muffled grunt in response, a soft sound I decide to interpret as a “yes”.
“Yeah? Why not?”
Okay, so, speaking of telling the truth, I do have something to tell you. Something that happened on the night of my party that I’m sure you’re going to be most excited about. I did what you told me to do. I kissed a boy.
“I’ll talk to him,” Harry said. “Again. I swear, if Sirius ends up in Slytherin and Ron gives him shit about it, I’ll—”
I can’t imagine you ever knew Glyn Raywood, the new Transfiguration Professor. Although he’s a Slytherin — your new Head of House, in fact, since Slughorn retired — he’s a half-blood and has been abroad for his research since before we were born. Apparently, he and McGonagall have known each other since their own Hogwarts days, and I totally get why she chose him for the post. You see, she’s been very adamant on breaking up old house prejudices this year, and he’s a good choice for a Slytherin representative to remind people that being sorted into Slytherin doesn’t automatically mean you have to become an unreliable, wicked git. He’s an inspiring role model for your fellow housemates and a good reminder for the rest of us not to judge a snake by its colour alone.
The intern finished and looked at Harry expectantly.
“I do,” Draco says. “I—”
“They’re amazing,” Draco said quietly. “You’re a true artist.” He recognised the amazement in his own voice and hoped Harry didn’t take offence.
Sent: You're someone who's getting on my last nerve. Go bother someone else. Good night.
But Teddy was awake, and if Harry didn’t get downstairs soon, they’d risk getting caught in bed together once the boy decided it was time for breakfast. Not that Harry had any intention to keep this latest turn of events a secret from his godson, but he figured he’d rather have that particular conversation when they were all decently dressed.
The fox cocked his head, his nose twitching.
“Is that so?”
“May I…?”
PS You think I had a privileged childhood? Seriously? One day, Malfoy, if you’re lucky, I may tell you all about it. For now, let’s just say it was everything yours wasn’t.
just run away without permission.”
— ☕ THURSDAY ☕ —
“Why not? We’re friends, aren’t we?” Draco nudges Harry’s shoulder with a loose fist, letting his arm stay on top of the couch’s backrest afterwards. The act leaves his fingertips close enough to graze Harry’s arm through the thin fabric of his t-shirt. Harry tries hard not to notice the subtle touch, but unfortunately, it’s an impossible feat. “Come on, Harry. Who is it?”
Draco chuckled at the joke. “Well, I mean, it’s the least she could do after trying to fry you up for dinner.”
“Tomorrow.”
And Harry loved them too. For all the fuss and noise and never-ending bickering, they were a warm and caring family, and he felt honoured to be considered an undisputed part of it. But there was no use denying the fact that he never felt as lonely as he did after coming back from another visit to the Burrow. Somehow, the lively atmosphere and the continuous attacks on his senses made his own tranquil townhouse seem all the more desolate.
Draco closed his eyes. “About that…”
“Godric, can you imagine?” Harry laughed.
“And risk humiliating myself in front of my sworn enemy?” Draco shakes his head and lets out a self-deprecating chuckle. “No, Harry. I may not always have made the right decisions, but I’m not
I’m sorry to tell you neither the Arrows nor the Falcons managed to take home the cup in the end. When it mattered the most, your team was simply too slow and mine was embarrassingly uncoordinated. Instead, the Tornados won, much to Justin’s and Parkinson’s delight. We all followed the final round over the WWN the other day and it was a real nail-biter, even if the wireless doesn’t allow you to actually see anything. (Why the wizarding world still haven’t been able to invent a magical version of the muggle telly is beyond me.) Sure, the wireless is better than nothing, I guess, and their commentators are undoubtedly doing their best to relate the goings-on, but no matter what they do, they’ll never be able to compete with the live experience. Not that I’ve been to many pro matches. (Actually, apart from the World Cup five years ago, I still haven’t been to a single one.) I bet you have been to more matches than you can count, haven’t you?
“Well…” Draco swallowed. “When I was lying in bed that night — little more than a bundle of nerves, tossing and turning and unable to fall asleep — someone came to see me. An… unexpected, late-night visitor.”
“How long until…?”
Mind preoccupied, he messed up the latte art on the flat white, making the palm branch he was going for look more like an ambiguous, phallic blob.
I seriously hope you’re right, that it’ll get easier with time, and as you said, I’m nothing if not stubborn. (And, honestly, rather curious to find out what you meant about the house wanting to prove itself, to ‘flaunt its capabilities’. You almost make it sound like it’s the bloody Room of Requirement or something.) I’m trying to follow your advice, staying in as much as possible when I’m not otherwise engaged, but Godric knows it’s grating on my every nerve at this point. I get what you’re saying, though. As much as I want to say it sounds like utter crap, it also kind of makes sense, in some weird, fucked up way. So I’ll work on my patience, doing my best to stay sane for as long as possible.
“No.” Teddy’s nose scrunched up in the most adorable way possible. “I’m a big brave boy. I can go by myself.”
“Draco, I—” was all he managed to get out before Draco pressed their lips together, silencing Harry with a searing kiss.
“What?” Draco briefly turned his head to look at him, bewildered, before huffing a laugh. “Circe, Harry. I had no idea you were so sex fixated.”
Draco did as he was told and was greeted by the green depths he’d willingly drown in for the rest of his life.
Pansy stared for a moment and then started laughing. “How could you possibly be blamed for a miscarriage or a nervous breakdown? You’re not making any sense.”
She squealed as Sirius carried her into the next room, leaving Draco standing awkwardly by the fireplace in what appeared to be a small sitting room. Molly entered seconds later.
He couldn't believe his eyes. He’d been wishing to meet him again. First, in a futile longing for reassurance. Later, to force some long-overdue answers or admissions out of him. Sometimes, just to hex him into oblivion, or physically beat the living daylights out of him. And here he was now, shoulders hunched, head bowed, lower lip caught between his teeth as he looked up at Draco through those long-as-fuck, inky black lashes. He looked regretful. Apologetic. As if
“Harry—”
He looks down at the feather in his hand and smells it again, letting out a subconscious hum of pleasure that catches him by surprise.
get pregnant in the magical world, right?”
Draco reached out and wrapped his fingers around the coin, revelling in the calmness that flowed through him as soon as his skin connected with the cool silver. He was just about to Nox his wand as he noticed another glint of metal in his peripheral vision.
Of course, I didn’t put the pieces together until much, much later, and as much as it hurts me to do it, if you really want me to answer your question, I must admit that I honestly don’t know. I wish I could say that I would’ve accepted your presence in this house, had you shown up on our doorstep one day collecting on Dumbledore’s promise. However, I think we both know the unlikelihood of that scenario. I was so angry back then, Draco, so fucking angry. At you, for letting the Death Eaters into the castle and attempting to kill Dumbledore. At Snape, for actually going through with it and deceiving Dumbledore so thoroughly. At Dumbledore, for naively trusting Snape and for not letting me help, only to surrender without a fight. There were other reasons for my anger too, mainly one horrible, evil thing parasitising my soul without my knowledge or consent. There was so much I still didn’t know, about Dumbledore’s secret plan, about the key to RIddle’s mortality, about Snape’s true loyalties. About you. I didn’t know you the way I do now, Draco. If I had, then yes, I would have indeed welcomed you with open arms.
a cat.
“M’kay. Night.”
“Draco!” Slyvia, his upstairs neighbour, called as soon as he opened the door. She swooped into the flat, swaying her hips dramatically with each step, shamelessly trying to draw his attention. Her vintage, hounds-tooth printed cocktail dress, complete with crinoline to poof out the skirt was a perfect compliment to her dark-blonde, Marilyn Monroe-style curls that bounced with each step she took. Draco stifled a groan.
"So, we're decided then? Hogsmeade," Harry said, excited at the plans they'd been making finally solidifying.
“Aww, poor baby.” Harry’s exaggerated whining, paired with his deep frown and childish pout, was almost enough for Draco to burst into laughter. Almost.
Sent: Behave, Potter! You’re in public!
“Mr Malfoy,” a deep voice came from behind Draco, and he turned with a pleasant smile.
Heart pounding, he stares up at the canopy and listens to the comforting sound of boys sleeping all around him. It’s familiar, like an old song he’s heard a million times before, and yet…something is different tonight.
“Bella! What are you—”
“He’s berating us for doing this out here. He’s cold and says he doesn’t want to watch us... doing stuff.”
PPS A kazoo? Seriously? You’re playing both the piano and the violin, and that’s all you’d think I could manage? A kazoo? For fuck’s sake, I don’t even…
Merlin. He looks so smitten it’s embarrassing.
I said it with a laugh, but he merely smirked and drawled, ‘Did he now?’ with that one-sided brow-raise he does that always makes him look just like you. (Is that some extra-curricular class they teach in the Slytherin common room after hours, by the way? Individual brow-raising, sneers, and infuriating smirks? I bet it is.) Anyway, then he offered. And I know kissing shouldn’t be like that, like a favour between two friends. I know there should be feelings involved for it to really make sense. But I did it anyway. I let him kiss me. And I didn’t die. It was different, yeah, but not at all horrible. In fact, if I’m to be honest — which we’ve agreed to be here, right? — I rather liked it. Although the mechanics are all the same, somehow it’s nothing like kissing a girl. At least not to my experience. The masculine scent, the rough stubble, the low, growling sounds he made…
“I do, Draco. Merlin knows, I do. But…” Harry sighed and leant his forehead against Draco’s, clenching his fists in Draco’s hair as he fought the urge to ravage him.
“No, thanks,” she said, as she always did, despite both of them knowing she’d be back within thirty minutes to order two cardamom buns. She handed him a banknote and some coins before taking the mugs, adding, “Keep the change.”

“The exam you have next week?” he clarified. “The one you wanted my help studying for? The reason I’m here?”
“So, um…” Harry busied himself with the files on his desk, unwilling to let Draco see the longing that must be radiating from his features. “Will I see you again? I mean, before…”
Draco’s shoulders started to relax at the sound of two sets of footsteps on the hardwood floor. A door clicked open and Draco let out a breath he hadn’t been aware of holding. He wasn’t safe yet, wouldn’t be until he was back on the Hogwarts Express, but for now, thanks to his mother, he could—
— the Saviour of the Wizarding World, the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One — be interested in someone like him. Not in that way, at least. They’d been sworn enemies, for Circe’s sake, surely— No. His well-meaning friend must’ve just read the signs all wrong. Not like Draco could blame her. To someone like her, so obviously unaware of their shared past, those furtive glances probably
Received: And I can teach you how to say yessssssss 😉
Was he?
Draco paused and cast an Impervious Charm over them both, his breath misting around his face in the frigid air.
Draco looked around but there was nobody nearby to help. The other keepers were likely scattered across the Reserve, taking care of their own duties.
“No,” Draco said immediately, shaking his head. “I couldn’t bear to go alone. Maybe someday, when I have someone by my side, I’ll try it again.”
have, he had reckoned it being sort of a given. However, between the ridiculously thorough prep and the excessive amount of lube Draco had slicked himself up with, Draco sunk into him as naturally as if he’d always belonged; as if he was always meant to be inside Harry’s body; as if he was the missing piece Harry had been lacking all along.
Draco needn’t be told twice. As soon as Harry released his hands and straightened up above him, he rolled over in the tight space between Harry’s legs, landing on his back about the same time as Harry’s t-shirt hit the floor. Harry’s bare chest was a sight to behold, toned and tanned with dark pebbled nipples and a perfect dusting of hair — so far from the scrawny frame Draco remembered from their childhood. Draco wasn’t given nearly enough time to admire it, though, as Harry’s distracting hands were soon on him again, roaming over abs and pecs and ribs and shoulders, teasing sensitive nipples and trailing over protruding hip bones along the waistband of Draco’s pants.
PS I’m rather sure you’re wrong about your biography, but if you insist, have it your way. Of course it’d only be madness to consider trying to thaw the public’s opinion of you. Whatever was I thinking, suggesting something so utterly ridiculous?
“Sometimes.” Draco shrugged. “Doesn’t really matter how you do it, though. As long as it’s apples and cheese, you can’t go wrong. You should try slicing Cheddar over apple pie someday,” he added in Molly’s direction. “When the cheese melts and trickles down to mingle with the fruit… magic, I tell you.”
Have you?
“No.” Teddy beamed. “I wouldn’t mind if he stayed forever.”
One year. Can you believe it? It’s weird, sometimes it feels as if it all happened ages ago, to entirely different people in an entirely different lifetime. Other days, it still feels like that night was just yesterday, not only mentally, but physically too. Some days, my body still feels just as exhausted as it did just after it was all over, when the relief finally settled in and let me relax for the first time in what felt like forever. Those days, I wonder if I’ll ever be able to fully recover from the war.
“He should’ve been, but he got stuck in New York. He was working out an issue with a new distributor for the Wheezes, but there were weather delays and he couldn’t fly out. Harry doesn’t do well with Portkeys, and international ones make him sick for days, so he had to wait until the airports reopened. He’s supposed to be back by tomorrow. He’s promised to have the next week off to celebrate with us.”
“No, we haven’t.”
George stilled, and Draco watched his eyes widen a fraction just before the man shook his head slightly and huffed a laugh. “Merlin, Draco, I never thought I’d see the day that ol’ Charlie decided to get married. And to see him shack up with you, well, it does a jokester’s heart good. It reminds me that humour does exist in this world.” Draco took it in the spirit it was intended — it would’ve been hard not to, considering the ridiculous grin that accompanied it — but he didn’t miss Ernie’s sharp intake of breath.
“Of course.”’
Draco felt the heat rise on his cheeks as he cleared his throat and promptly turned towards the fireplace. “So, shall we take the Floo, then?”
“W-what?” Harry gasped, mindlessly scrunching up the bedspread in his fists as he bucked into Draco’s hand.
Draco opened his mouth to reply but…nothing came out. Before he knew it, the girl winked at him and walked away, leaving Draco standing there, speechless, confused, and— No. Not even a little bit intrigued.
"Harry!" Harry feels Draco's balls grow firm under his hand, and he moans in anticipation. "I'm close, I— I'm gonna come."
Their second round was rougher, fiercer, but no less passionate or intense than their first. Harry took Draco’s cock in his mouth and sucked him back to full hardness, swallowing him deep down his throat until Draco begged him to stop. With his arse already stretched and wet, Harry could easily lower himself down over Draco’s shaft, taking him in just as naturally as before. And then he rode him, hard and fast and with wild abandon. Draco rolled his hips underneath him, meeting Harry’s motions with thrusts of his own, clutching Harry’s thighs hard enough to bruise.
Harry’s heart pounds hard against his ribs.
“Oh, kiss!” Ginny yelled. “Come on, Harry. Kiss him.”
“Yes. I’m not afraid to talk about sex, Percy.”
” Draco dropped his jaw and covered his heart with a splayed hand in mock astonishment. “This is
Sent: No, not here…
“Good choice,” Draco said approvingly, just as he did every week, regardless of her pick of the day.
a big deal. And frankly, I think I’d be more worried if he weren’t being anxious about it.”
When October rolled around, and Harry’s trips to the Owlery increased, he began to dream about feathers. Unsurprisingly — there were feathers strewn everywhere up here. But unlike regular owl feathers, the feathers in his dreams were large and soft, gorgeous, almost shimmering. And they begged Harry to reach out and stroke them, to run his fingertips along their shafts.
“I’m really sorry about what happened, Draco,” she said after making herself comfortable on the sofa with a heap of cuddle-greedy Smaug in her lap. “Your friend Pansy came to see my show last night and told me all about it. I have to admit I’m a bit confused.”
. Draco’s stomach churned. What if the Dark Lord was back from his mission already and Bellatrix had proposed her little Legilimency idea to him? What if—
“Fuck!” Potter had done it again, leaving Draco raw and confused, nauseated by the tangled mess of false hopes and futile dreams wreaking havoc in his chest. “
“Of course,” Harry said, amusement dancing in his eyes. “You’re the best Seeker your house has seen in decades.”
Feathers. Caramel. Dreams.

"Indeed," Draco replies quietly. "But seriously, thank you for getting me away. For showing me that I'm more than what they see."
Draco was almost certain he didn’t imagine the choking sound coming from the other end of the line. “Oh, don’t mind Janie. She always has all sorts of strange ideas.”
“It’ll be all right, I promise,” Potter whispered next to his ear.
Finally able to touch Harry too, Draco reached up to follow the smooth lines of Harry’s body with trembling hands; strong, sinewy arms, broad shoulders, sharp collarbones, racing pulse, bobbing Adam’s apple.
“Sirius!”
“I-I didn’t know where else to go…”
Draco gave her a smile and hoped it wasn’t as tight as it felt. “Good night, Molly. Good night everybody,” he added to the room at large, then slipped out the back door, hoping to let the cool night air return his body to normal before he Apparated home.
“Oh, Harry.” Draco’s voice is soft as he takes Harry in his arms. “If anything, we’re finally setting the world to rights. Yes, you lost a family here once, but you’re starting a new one now. You’ve come full circle, giving this house another chance at the happy Potter family it’s been deprived of for so long.”
run away together.”
I sync my movements with his, carving out a bite of my granita and lifting it to my mouth as he does the same. I pause, though, spoon still waiting in front of my mouth as Harry’s lips close around his, and I stifle a groan as I watch his features turn into an image of pure bliss.
The Dark Lord’s voice rang through the castle and Draco froze, chill coursing through his veins as his mind screeched to a halt.
“Good.” Draco took in the tired smile on his husband’s face. He gestured towards Harry’s cup, waiting for him just as always next to his armchair. “I made you tea.”
One of Draco’s hands is resting on Harry’s thigh, its warmth seeping through the fabric of Harry’s joggers. The other moves lazily over Harry’s back, trailing random patterns up and down his spine. Harry is pretty sure Draco’s not even aware of doing it, that he has no fucking clue how every featherlight touch of those fingertips sends pleasant shivers across Harry’s skin.
Draco seems to consider, then takes a deep breath and spreads his wings.
“No, I mean it. I live for my dragons and my job, but I ignore my family. I spend all my free time drinking and carousing — before you, I mean; I’ve never been a cheater, even if I can’t remember everything — and I’ve been neglecting the things that are important.”
Draco rolled his eyes, dismissing Harry’s scepticism even as he knew it was probably warranted. Looking back, Draco was all too well aware of the obnoxious attention-whore he’d been back in the day.
“A hot chocolate and a slice of the pecan pie, please.”
“Of course, darling. We’ll see you at the hospital tomorrow. Do you have plans for New Year’s? We don’t have a large party, but you’re welcome to come over to celebrate. We’ll have champagne and a nice dinner, of course.”

Harry swallowed, lowering his gaze to where his hand was still tangled in Draco’s white-blond locks. “A-and what if I can’t wait that long?” he murmured.
“Yeah, I—” Harry scowls at himself in the mirror, wondering why he ever let Malfoy talk him into this.
home — brought back memories and emotions he hadn’t thought he’d missed. Moving photographs of people he once knew, trinkets from places he’d once frequented, objects the likes of which he’d once owned. A snitch laying amongst a random collection of knick-knacks in a bowl on the windowsill. A knocked-over stack of chocolate frog cards on the coffee table, presumably used as coasters.
“Your fiancé. You and Draco are engaged.”
This time, though, Draco’s momentary awareness of Charlie Weasley was immediately overtaken by the immense fireball that landed in the same spot only a second later.
Harry reached behind Draco to close the door, leaning in close enough for their shoulders to brush against each other in the cramped space that was Harry’s hallway. Draco made an effort to continue breathing like a normal person for once, only to instantly regret it. Harry’s scent rushed through him like a tidal wave, invading every cell in his body, making him tremble all over. Merlin, what was wrong with him? He hadn’t been here even a minute, and Draco could already feel the heat rise up his neck, reddening his cursed Malfoy skin. For being an evening of two ex-enemies-turned-not-really-friends-yet-but-maybe-someday just hanging out studying, this felt an awful lot like a date. Not that Draco had been on many of those in his life so far. Maybe he was wrong; maybe he was just being silly.
Sent: It’s a toss-up.
Like the time in Fourth Year when he refused to speak a single word to me in nearly a month because he thought I’d lied to him about not having put my name in the Goblet of Fire. He’s matured since then, thank Godric, so he can at least hold a somewhat normal conversation now (even if his resentment is still palpable), but unlike Fourth Year, this time I have actually been lying to him — well, lying by omission, but same difference — and not about something trivial either, but the fact that I’ve been making friends with you; the heir of his family’s generations-old adversaries. It’s like, well, let’s just say he’s not one for accepting monumental changes in his life lightly.
Received: Are you scared?
With his gaze helplessly fixed on Potter’s lifeless body, waiting for it to stir, to twitch, to…
Melodramatic Malfoy,
brave? Draco wanted to laugh, but Harry’s serious expression gave him pause. “You’re kidding, right?” he asked instead, bemused by the lack of humour on Harry’s face. “Because I’m pretty sure only a coward slinks out the back door when the going gets tough.”
And somehow, I keep the walls from falling down.
“So, you’ve had a busy week,” Harry finally said as they stepped out the front doors of the hospital onto the cold, London street.
The dog bounded over and rested its chin on the park bench next to Draco’s knee.
It wasn’t like Draco had a thriving social life to uphold in his spare time anyway. His work was plenty social as it was, and, most days, his brain was about ready to switch off the minute his shift ended.
“Smaug,” Draco complained, picking the little fox up off the edge of the sofa where he’d been trying to get at the bulbs still hanging on the Christmas tree. The Barrier Charm that had protected the tree this past month had been working, but now that Draco was taking it all down, Smaug was determined to make up for lost time.
Molly’s voice was closer now, but still quiet. “Yes, that’s Draco. I haven’t had a chance to tell you about him yet, but he’s Charlie’s fiancé.”
Draco’s arms tightened around him. “About New Year’s Eve,” he whispered, against the sensitive spot right under Harry’s ear. “I don’t care where I am as long as I get to kiss you at midnight.”
“And then the hospital just accepted all this, and they’re telling everybody I’m the fiancé, and they’re giving me his personal items to care for, and I’m not kidding, Pans, this is all going to come back and bite me in the arse any day now, I just know it, and then—”
He shook his head and smiled. “Not this time, unfortunately. Just work.”
Harry reaches for Draco's fly and begins to work it open as Draco tries to distract him, capturing Harry's mouth. The taste of Draco infuses his senses but doesn't stop him from expertly shoving the man's trousers aside to reach his goal. On Draco's long moan, Harry drops to his knees, the soft grass cool under him as it cushions his weight. He runs his hands up Draco's thighs and marvels as Draco's wings unexpectedly come around to caress Harry's back.
“Awake?” Draco started to turn back towards the lifts, unready to tackle the hurdle ahead, but she grabbed his arm.
Received: I'll be here... waiting for you...
Harry took a step closer, getting into Draco’s personal space. Draco’s heart skipped a beat as Harry’s scent wafted over him, warm and male and mouth-watering, but he didn’t step back.
It went on like that, two fingers, three, four, interlaced with Draco’s complementing words, spoken in his deep, soothing baritone. Harry lost track of time, lost track of everything except Draco’s touch, Draco’s voice, Draco’s scent. At one point, Draco leaned in behind him, bracing himself on his elbow to kiss Harry’s shoulder. As he did, Harry felt Draco’s rock-hard cock prod his thigh and smear pre-come over his skin.
He says hi, though. And Nott too. They’ve apparently been worrying about you a lot this past year and had a million questions about how you’re doing. I dodged most of them (Yes, I had downed the Sober-Up by then so you can relax, I didn’t tell them much.) but you should know they both still care about you and will still be your friends once you get out of there.
Harry snorted.
“Yeah.” Teddy smiled, wrapping his legs around Harry’s waist as he let himself be enveloped in a tight cuddle. “Thank you for taking me, Uncle Harry.”
Honestly, Malfoy, even you must be able to see the irony here? That you, after seven years of constantly mocking me for my rash decisions and reckless behaviour, actually dare to question my motives for the one moment in my life when I’ve been able to rein in my instinctual lion in favour of all those Slytherin traits you’ve always valued so highly.
"He's really eager to get some changes through the Ministry, and he thinks you'd be brilliant at it."
"Draco," he gasps. No, not gasps.
The fox snuffled and Draco chuckled, reaching out to give the little animal a snuggle.
Letting out the breath he’d been holding, Draco nodded. “Yes, absolutely. I think I’ll just go upstairs for a bit and have some tea, then.”
Draco draws back — with his breath and his warmth and his stupid, heady scent. Harry shivers at the loss, trying but failing to clear his muddled brain.
“Draco?”
Granted, Draco had once come from similar circumstances, nothing but Slytherins for generations, house expectations set long before he was even born. But while the Granger-Weasleys kept with the old-school intra-house tradition, the Potter-Malfoys were a modern post-war family, a paragon of diversity. Between their fathers, surrogate mother, and godbrother, Draco’s and Harry’s kids were surrounded by parental figures from all four houses, and he and Harry had always been adamant to make sure they knew they would be loved and supported no matter what house they ended up in. Draco secretly wished Rose would end up in Ravenclaw just to be able to enjoy the shock on Ron’s face once he found out.
Parkinson doesn’t seem to agree with him. Has she ever? She just laughs off Ron’s arguments and shakes her head, starting in on her own conversion crusade as soon as Ron pauses to gulp down the rest of his pint. Around them, Seamus, Dean, Zabini, and Bulstrode all fight for a chance to get their say in the matter — whatever it is they’re arguing about — and beyond them, at the other end of our long table, Hermione, Nott, Daphne, and Ginny are immersed in a deep, albeit calmer, discussion of their own.
. There’s no use trying to suppress the feral groan emanating from his very core.
“It’s tradition.” Arthur’s voice this time, Draco knew, but he couldn’t move his eyes from Harry’s, waiting to see what the other man would do. He was terrified Harry would do something and, simultaneously, dreading that he might not.
“I bet.” Draco’s smile didn’t quite reach his eyes this time, and Harry found himself wondering why. “You’re good with him, you know. I’m certain you’ll be a brilliant father one day.”
“Well, come on, then. Let me see.”
“No, I’m n—”
Harry moved with him, meeting Draco’s thrusts as good as he could, rubbing his leaking cock against Draco’s undulating abs. With Draco’s hands firmly planted on the mattress, holding him up, Harry finally got a chance to explore Draco’s body the way he himself had been explored, caressing his smooth skin, pinching his dark hardened nipples, running his hands over any and all parts of Draco he could reach.
“Wait,” he blurts before he can think better of it, “your wings. Can you actually fly with them? Like, really fly? Maybe even well enough to carry someone else?”
“Bid sheets and Tally Charms in place?”
?” Harry asked, sounding surprised.
apparently consists of two main elements: informative, fact-focused mini-seminars and inspirational practical workshops.
“Aw, poor you,” Harry offered, playing along and adding a sympathetic pout for good measure. “Then you better sit down for a while, Mr Claus. D’you want some hot chocolate?”
Harry groaned.
“Me too.” Draco laughed as he wrapped another bulb and placed it next to the others in the box. And if his laugh sounded harsher than usual, well, it was no surprise to either of them. “Honestly, Slyvia, I don’t know how I got myself into that whole mess.”
Fuck, I’m sorry. Of course you don’t know about what happened to your parents, and of course you’d want to know. Why haven’t you asked earlier? I double-checked their sentences the other day, not trusting my memory after so many months. (There were a lot of trials last summer, and most of it is nothing but a big blur of awful to me these days.) Narcissa will be out of Azkaban in only a few months, actually. She got one year in prison plus two additional years’ of house arrest. I still haven’t gotten any straight answers on how the Ministry plans to execute it, but with a little luck, you might actually get some company come July. Your father will be a little longer. He got five years, which is still remarkably low compared to most of his fellow death eater buddies, mainly because he offered a great deal of valuable information that helped the aurors capture the strays who were still on the run.
Can’t believe I’ll be leaving this place in just a few days, and for good this time.
“No…” Draco’s arm tightened around his waist and Harry was sorely tempted to suck that pouting lip into his mouth. It looked delectable.
“Er… Four?”
“Sorry,” she said through tears. “Pregnancy hormones. It’s just— That was lovely.”
Harry moves to sit down by the kitchen table while the tea steeps, sighing as he tilts his head towards the ceiling. He wishes there were something he could do to help, something more productive than brewing tea and volunteering his perfected bantering skills, but he knows that’s not how life works.
Molly huffed. “I like sex as much as the next person, but if you really need to talk about sex right now, Ginny, then perhaps we can talk about that time when your father and I walked in on—”
“Yes.”
PPS Did you know they mentioned your transfer on the wireless on New Year’s Day? And during prime time too. Just keep up the good work and you’ll be a celebrity in no time.
Godric, what’s with me today? I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to bore you with my depressing rambling, I know it must be hard to believe, but I do intend for these letters to lighten your mood, not the opposite. And just for the record, I usually don’t have any problem keeping these pathetic thoughts to myself, but writing to you… it’s like you bring it out of me. So if you think I sound like a miserable mess, you only have yourself to blame.
Merlin, what would they say if they knew…?
"I think so. It'll keep you close to Hogwarts if you decide to take McGonagall up on her offer for the teaching assistant job, and if not, it'll still be easy access to London or wherever. And if I take the Potions apprenticeship with Jacoby in Glasgow, it'll be convenient."
A knock at the door had him pausing. He closed the box and glared at Smaug, then promptly scooped the fox up into his arms to keep him away from the temptation.
He took a deep breath and glanced from Molly, who was clearly handling this well enough, to Hermione. She didn’t seem to be in distress at the news; actually, she seemed kind of delighted and popped a peanut into her mouth as though she were watching a play at the theatre.
“But that’s all in the past. This is my second chance at life, and I have it because of you. You saved me. It took a coma to wake me up.”
