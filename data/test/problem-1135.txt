‘I won’t. Though I must say, I thought you’d tell Weasley everything. You’re one of the tightest couples I’ve ever met,’ and then, making sure his voice kept the same light note as before, he added, ‘Potter must feel like quite the third wheel.’
‘Really,’ Draco answered. As it was wont to - as the sudden intimacy of the moment dictated - his voice dipped too into a murmur. ‘Do you still like her?’
The windows of the candy shop were neon bright, swirling in fluorescent pinks and greens. A sickeningly sweet fragrance hung in the chilly air outside. Finnigan was the first to get in, a bell chirping high-pitched as he opened the door. The others filtered in after, more than a few tripping on the small step, and Pansy and Draco entered last.
to Potter, all in the name of her preposterous misconception that Draco wanted to date him - as if that could ever be possible.
something. He’d been pulled into the intense green of Harry’s eyes, when they were sitting so close together, and thought that Harry could somehow, someday
It was all incredibly optimistic, which was rare for facts. Granted, Draco wasn’t too experienced with romance, but he could recognize that they were getting into
, his head would be bashed against the field, all blood and ripped skin, and he’d be dead, and Draco loved him, and why hadn’t the fucking idiot listened? - he dove straight down, trying to reach him.
He remembered Harry’s words, then. The ones he’d said right before the game. The ones that still held his heart in a suffocating hold. The way he’d said them, like he meant it, like they’d both be swirling through the airs, both suffering, both trying not to fall, opposition,
Harry lightly kicked one of Draco's legs with an impatient huff. 'You know, it's not because we're in your dorm that you get to be demanding.'
happened: players fell all the time in Quidditch. Harry hadn’t even fallen from that high - Draco had made sure of that, hadn’t he? He’d most likely broken some bone, and that was all. He’d be fine. It was fine.
Both Luna and Pansy looked over their shoulders at them. Luna’s blood red lips split into a radiant smile.
, because he knew he hadn’t sounded convincing and he’d known as he said it that there was no way he could salvage that sentence, no way Hermione wouldn’t know what he had intended to say, and he watched with a white streak of panic as her eyes widened, narrowed, then rounded with surprise.
He settled in one of the armchairs in the Slytherin common room, bathed in dim lighting, staring distractedly at the dancing flames in the fireplace. It reminded him of a swirl of red and orange glitter. He closed his eyes and vowed not to think for the rest of the day.
- but Draco knew, deep down, in some fragment of thought where the alcohol hadn’t yet reached, that he couldn’t say yes, since his biggest secret, the one he’d been harbouring for years, that he planned to nurse in his grave, was precisely about Harry, and this game, with the questions worded by his voice, could only serve to bring about the honesty Draco had avoided since he’d met him.
‘Why would I say it if I wasn’t sure? I’m not that impulsive, you know?’ Harry snorted. He huffed when Draco simply kept pinning him with concerned eyes. ‘Look, right now I want it. If I stop wanting it, I’ll tell you, alright?’
The walk to the infirmary, on the other hand, went much less swimmingly. Pansy parted from him halfway to place the mallowseet in the supply closet; she didn’t as much as give him a steady look, leaving like Draco’s task was the simplest thing in the world, no need for threats nor encouragement, and thus, in this surety, Draco felt impossibly obliged to go through with it.
dangerous, Draco wasn’t crazy, everyone around him was playing and acting like it wasn’t but it was, it had consequences, and Draco had always known Gryffindors required bravery but he didn’t know they required a complete utter lack of brains as well; and they were still somewhat close to the grass, safely so, but Harry would be flying up soon, to dangerous heights again, and why couldn’t he just fall off now, if the bloody fool refused to leave of his own free will? Why couldn’t he just fall and get a little bruised instead of dying? Why couldn’t he just stop? Why didn’t he just get out of the fucking field?
, all those nights he'd loitered around Hogsmeade, that Potter became specially fucking nice when he was drunk, and he'd insist on paying everything, probably because he didn't have any friend selfish enough to tell him how fucking
about the whole thing, like he was learning a new Quidditch technique or a strange hex, eyes twinkling in a mix of focus and excitement.
Draco huffed. It was somewhat difficult, however, to conjure actual anger when Harry’s arm was still entwined with his.
Now, however, there was little else to do besides digging nails into his workbench and pretending like his world was much the same and devoid of interest, like the love of his life hadn’t blown him a few hours ago, like they wouldn’t soon meet to work or fuck or talk or kiss or whatever on earth Harry wanted.
‘Yeah, but they’re my favourite,’ Harry sighed. He didn’t seem much troubled by Draco’s presence, which qualmed Draco’s nerves.
‘Alihotsy. A variant of it, in any sense,’ he regarded Harry wearily. ‘Don’t go around telling your friends, Potter.’
And Harry was craning his neck to face him fully, pink-faced and shiny-eyed, lipstick mostly bitten and licked off, and Draco could remember applying it all prim and proper in the dungeon hall, surrounded by music and dancing ghosts, when everything had been wonderful in a very formal way, and now it was just him and Harry, private and precious and special, so
'You know,' he started carefully, stopping his hips from bucking forward when Harry finally unzipped him. 'That man could burst in here any second.'
‘Seems to me the only one hurt here is Granger. And now you’re here instead of her. You truly should stop filling in for each other.’
He stepped out of Draco’s grasp and walked further into the room - it was scarcely lit by a few enchanted candles poised perilously on the corners of the crammed shelves, casting eerie reflections in the jars of minerals, herbs and animal parts. It was a strange sight, all the desks clear and vacant. Made the room feel dead. When he turned back to Draco, he looked unsure.
'Don't you know where it is? You have been here, after all,' Draco drawled, all feigned lightheartedness, like he felt no urgency, no
‘What is it with the questions, Weasley? Why on earth would I be with Potter?’ he asked, a bit sharp in the implicit dare for Ron to put it into words.
‘Worked out for everyone, then,’ Draco smirked before dipping his hand down to search Harry’s crotch. ‘You hard, Potter? Want me to take care of it?’
Harry’s expression was one of skeptical surprise. Draco disliked it altogether: was it that inconceivable that he could be
He tugged on Harry's hips, coaxing him closer, pressing their lower halves together, an intimate gesture contrasting with the magnitude of the dance behind them. It was ridiculous how good Harry looked in that moment, teasing lips tweaked into that little amused smile of his, and Draco found himself wanting to shield him from the rest of the room. To protect this sight, so perfect and vulnerable, and keep it bottled in his memory.
He didn't get to finish his sentence, no, because Harry was stumbling into the dark room, dragging him by the arm and pushing him right against the newly reformed wall behind them. Their lips met, rushed, forceful, Harry taking the reigns of it with endless silent demands, teeth that nipped and hands that twisted into Draco's suit jacket.
Still, because this voice ached for confirmation, and he had still hurt Harry, no matter his intentions, and he could only handle so many side eyes from Finnigan and Longbottom whenever he went to fetch more aconite, he ended up turning towards Pansy halfway through the class.
Hermione tapped her glass thoughtfully. The red lighting flashed on her neck, and Draco, by instinct, sought the invisible line in her neck where her head had detached.
bed with that suit, with that lipstick, all heated and wanton? Draco owed it to his past self to commit the scene to memory; just a moment to reminisce on all the fantasies he'd had, from pitifully innocent things like dozing off in each other's arms after a long day to filthy flashes of hot and tight that kept him hopelessly distracted during Transfiguration. He had to
‘Seems so,’ was Harry’s curt response. Draco had ruined it, then, their earlier friendliness, beyond repair, ‘They should be outside,’ he started cutting through the crowd, stopped, turned to face Draco again, ‘Thanks.’
‘No one has the patience to hate you anymore, Harry. It’s exhausting,’ he said instead, trying to dispel the concern in Harry’s eyes. ‘They’ll like you as much as your friends like me, I reckon.’
‘What, do we have to be married first or something?’ Harry smirked, already flattening himself against one side of the mattress. ‘Come here, you look about to fall over.’
nervous, set on not making a fuss over it, and Draco wanted to oblige. So he pushed in, just the head of his cock, and watched transfixed as it was sucked through the rim and enveloped in heavenly heat. It felt so fucking
‘Prep you never experienced before,’ Draco pointed out, fingers running tender circles in Harry’s chest. Really, there ought to be some order to things: perhaps they could do something small first, some sort of
And he said it with such conviction - such horror -, all blind loyalty to his House, to that sacred room of red and gold. God forbid a snake should slither in.
The voices of indignation were instantaneous. Draco himself thought it funny, in some dark, sharp-shooted way, but then he felt Harry’s arm tense against his, just for a second before it melted into soft warmth once more, and Draco was shaken with the wish to both slap the back of Ron’s head and offer Harry some gesture of comfort.
‘Are you done with your drink, Fletchley? No? Good. No one’s done? Alright, mates, we’re playing, come on, I want to play.’
‘Yeah, you’re making that very easy right now,’ Harry huffed dryly. Draco figured he deserved it. ‘Do you want me to hate you?’
Draco himself had made quite the art of it. He knew precisely which alcoves were never visited, and which classrooms were safe to occupy during dull moments; he knew that the greenhouses were often empty when it rained, and that the lake was deserted before breakfast.
'We shouldn't risk it, then,' Draco smiled at Harry's frustrated huff when he withdrew his hand. 'If you take the edge off now, you’ll only focus on the unpleasant bits. You’ll just have to wait until my cock’s in you so you can finally come.’
He did think, sometimes, that it could be interesting to hold Potter's. He'd fidget, strain against it, swing their arms and tug Draco around; his hand would be too warm, his fingers small and restless where they wrapped around Draco's; but maybe, if Draco smoothed circles on his skin with his thumb, he'd sag a little; maybe, if Draco squeezed a bit tighter, Potter would squeeze back; maybe, if they did it often enough, they'd find a rhythm: and they'd meet each other in the halls and walk together to class, and their hands would slide together without a thought.
He turned back to the mirror, bending over the sink so he could better check the colourful shimmer. It was a good image; Draco could live with it, fold it neatly in his archive - Harry in that dim bathroom, turning away from him, phoenix glitter on his eyes. The last memory of their strange, brief friendship. It was the perfect time to leave.
God, who knew that after writing roughly 110.000 words of sickeningly sweet fluff, I could feel so empty. I don't even know what I'll do now that this is over.
Still, Harry was still dazed from his orgasm, and it wasn't like he was sober. Draco ought to make sure he understood the situation.
Draco, meanwhile, was staring at the keys with one calm eyebrow raised on his forehead. He was beginning to realize why they were in the Tapestry Corridor.
‘Alright, then, if you want to do it that way,’ Draco said, shrugging, and raised his voice, ‘Oy, it’s my turn now. Never have I ever wanted to be choked.’
‘Well, one more hungover nitwick won’t do me any good. It’s just bloody daft of you to play. You… you were very drunk too, weren’t you?’
'Only a little while ago. You could have told me before,' Harry pressed eagerly against Draco's lean thigh, 'and you could have told me
‘The punishment for blatching. You know, nowadays the other team gets awarded a penalty and that’s all. I say the player should be benched. I mean, trying to throw someone off their broom - nasty business, isn’t it? Wouldn’t want someone like that on my team.’
‘You really are dull. Love’s taken all the fun out of you,’ she said, smile disappearing behind her mug as she took another sip of tea. When she was done, she tapped her nails once on the ceramic and asked, a bit quieter, more interested than amused, ‘Do you figure you’ll go to Hogsmeade with them again?’
It was a decent attempt at pretense, given that Neville had seen Draco push Harry. The oblivious people in the room ought to be terribly confused, and the silence lingered awkward and unsettled for a while.
Harry dropped his head onto the mattress. After his vision cleared and he took in the sight of Draco, he burst into laughter.
‘I- yeah,’ Harry swiped a thumb under his bottom lip, where the faintest layer of red had lingered. ‘Thanks.’
‘Merlin, Neville,’ Dean Thomas’s eyes were almost perfectly circular in surprise. ‘Well, worst scar, worst consequence. Have a shot, mate.’
Draco sighed, tempted to persist on his lie, no matter how flimsy, simply because it was habit. Then again, that same fact, the idea that he'd never been open about it, prompted him some unruly honesty:
Draco looked away, clenching his jaw. Really, he ought to just give up - why should he bother to say anything?  Why pretend to give a damn about any of those airheaded Gryffindors when he very specifically only cared about one? Why argue against these hungover, apathetic excuses for friends, who were obviously content laying down in their golden and red naivety and hoping for the best? They were clearly fine with Harry hurting himself - which he fucking would, he wasn’t any Quidditch prodigy, he couldn’t fly in his state. Bloody Potter deserved to break an arm anyway: the fact that his life belonged to him didn’t mean he got to ruin it - other people
Just for good measure - and he was really just wasting both his time and Harry’s, because the decision had been made as soon as Harry had asked - he pretended to consider it.
'Draco,' Harry hissed, and now he was just pulling at Draco's hair, the vicious twat, trying to get his attention.
dissect and see just how better it was from his dreams, how realer, firmer, brighter in colour and detail, so he could convince himself he was truly awake.
'Not that we mind,' Finnigan's face broke into a lopsided smile, and he slipped down until he was half laying, his head propped on the back of the seat. 'Gotta cheer for the team, after all.'
He walked away briskly, coaxing Harry with a steady tug on his arm. At the center of the hall, amidst the spectral figures, were Pansy and Luna already.
‘Malfoy! Right, mate, I was just… it fell, you see?’ he gestured vaguely at the helmet, then at the armour lining the wall.
'Let's leave,' he whispered, holding onto Pansy's elbow by the door. But she shook him off, heading to the bar.
Draco, for the life of him, couldn’t think of anything clever to say. It was just as well, because a moment later Dean Thomas patted both their shoulders, making them turn with a start:
Harry left, robes swirling black and thick around them, walking out into the dark night. Draco followed as well, joining the little group - and it was the strangest thing, for a smile seemed to be lurking an atom away from his lips, resisting the urge to break free, hanging always behind his skin; like the moment he dared smile this hesitant happiness within him would be obvious, and the universe would notice and sweep it - and everything that had caused it - far from his reach.
Harry huffed. To their right, the teams were finally beginning to settle. Harper had stormed out, taking a seat in the stands. Draco was fully expecting a row with her - he quite deserved it.
It made Draco feel even more unfit than when they were properly apart. At least then, when Draco would spy him from across the Great Hall and long to be sitting beside him, he’d be content in his own mind, not knowing what Potter actually thought of his fantasies. Now, he’d gotten that closeness; in turn, he was helpless to see Potter repulsed by it.
After a moment, through which the ginger stood staring at him like it physically wounded him to keep his head high, Draco nodded.
Harry had looked. These wonderings were the only memory Draco had of Harry dancing - they didn’t paint it in good light, and Draco began to fear Harry wouldn’t like to dance.
Because time had never been in their favour. They'd always been furtive, rushed, with an impending sense of urgency. And now there was a soft bed for Harry to writhe on, covers under Draco's knees while he hovered over him, and a room all to themselves with thick walls and a suitably locked door. So Draco took one of Harry's nipples into his mouth, the left one so he could hopefully feel his heartbeat kicking up, and sucked the little nub without mercy, persistent but lazy, set to unravel Harry like he'd never had the chance to do before, slow and gradual and with a level of care bordering on
Harry looked up at him again, brow furrowed, a little twitch to his lips like he was trying to suppress a smile.
Draco shuffled forward in a reluctant pace, shaking off Pansy's arm when it attempted to lace with his, an echo of Harry's.
‘Oh, I can tell,’ Draco snorted. Harry’s skin was a whole new level of sickly pale, after all. ‘Perhaps we should stay clear of alcohol for a few nights.’
Draco told her, hushed and evasive, what had happened on the grounds. He didn’t mention his little episode with Harry in the bathroom: that, for some reason, seemed still too surreal to put out into the world - were he to speak it aloud, he feared someone would hear the unlikeliness of it and snatch it right out from under his sight. When he was finished, Pansy’s potion had simmered into a rich purple, while Draco's was sticking viscous and burnt to the bottom of the cauldron.
‘D’you need help with your books?’ he asked, fit into the narrow space between their desks, fingers thrumming on the edge of Draco’s.
Harry was giggling with the two young Weasleys. Draco clung to his frustration, buried his panic, and called out:
‘Well, you do, then,’ Harry hummed before turning his head to brush their lips together. ‘It feels nice, though. We should do it more often.’
why that’s funny,’ Harry gave up on powdering the flitterbies, turning to face Draco with an insufferably smug grin. ‘Were you another Potter fan?’
Hermione was an instant from firing back; then, something caught up with her, and her lips pressed together at comical speed. She regarded him now not like he was some pesky child trying to pick a fight, but as if he was an object of study.
‘And when you say teaching,’ he started, his eyes twinkling as he stepped closer to grab at the sides of Draco’s shirt. ‘Do you mean you’ll be an arse the whole time?’
With a sigh, Draco nodded. Harry counted down, an excited urgency in his voice, and they both let the shot slither down their throats. It burnt, it left a scorching trail, like it was flaying the inside of his mouth, and it pooled right at the base of his neck, spreading an afflicting heat there. Still, Draco didn’t allow himself to breathe before downing the second one. He was certain his vision had flashed white as he tipped his chin up, and it was only with great effort that he didn’t cough when he slammed the little glass down.
him -, he didn’t leave, only moved closer, toed the pots of the small mandragoras with the tip of his soaked shoe and sighed something impatient and disappointed.
Another push, and Draco was really quite done with the cramped establishment and the friendly elbows of all those drunkards.
Harry bucked helplessly against Draco, chasing the orgasm he'd been denied, that had left his eyes red and his entire body trembling. Draco pressed his hips further onto the wall, hoping his fingers would dig little bruises over the pelvic bone, something purple and red Harry could remember him by. It was difficult, however, to keep Harry relatively still - Draco had sped up his rhythm even more, turning it into something filthy and loud with the sounds of saliva, and Harry was thrashing, biting his lip, fingers twisted viciously in Draco's hair like he was half-decided to pull him off and escape the overwhelming stimulation.
Potter stood there a little while longer. Time seemed to stretch infinitely between them until Draco heard a sigh, then Potter's retreating footsteps, slow and wet on the cobblestone. When Draco heard the pub's door swing closed, he breathed out a small cloud.
Harry nodded frantically, and they rushed to the stall Draco had been in just a few minutes ago, when the world had seemed to be crashing down upon him. As soon as the flimsy lock clicked shut, Draco pushed Harry against the tiles, pressing their bodies together, drawing a long breath as he took in the situation.
'Not all of them,' she drawled, smile only widening when Draco glared at her in warning, 'All I'm saying is it wouldn't hurt to play nice.
‘Harry,’ Draco breathed, not believing his ears - pushing away a little to look better into Harry’s eyes, to see the unflinching
He buckled his belt himself while Draco helped adjust his shirt into some sorry echo of appropriate.
, entirely and hopefully - Merlin, Draco hoped - for a very, very long time. So long that a mortal would call it forever. He could do that now:
He shrugged. ‘I’m realistic. It just so happens that reality’s been good recently,’ he said - but he could hear the wistful lightness in his tone. There was nothing realistic in him left: he was all elegant rings and wedding chapels, distant wonderings of domesticity, casual kisses and serene promises of eternity.
Draco could only manage a nod as a reply, still awfully obsessed with the picture before him. He'd been right before: Harry was fucking
Harry huffed. He stepped closer to the mandragoras. ‘I didn’t apologize because I didn’t think I had to. It was one soddy night, and you’re never at Hogsmeade anyway, I didn’t think you’d want to go. I didn’t think you’d
‘Oh, is this a surprise, then?’ Blaise sighed. ‘I suppose we should just show you, shouldn’t we? Come along,’ he gestured with an idle hand, then turned the corner with Rowena. The others followed, orbiting to their little pairs: Luna and Pansy entwined their fingers with a fluidity that hinted at
He sighed, picking back up the leather bound book. It was pointless, all of this. He'd been obsessing over Potter for years now: where had it ever led him?
‘Oh, she’s your bloody opposition, quit wasting your breath,’ Draco dismissed. He did feel bad for Harper, but it wouldn’t do him good to back down now. A few feet away, he could see Crabb running to tell her about the change.
And he’d taken initiative - that was something Draco couldn’t quite shake from his mind whenever he closed his eyes. So, Draco found it safe to say that, after years of pining, Harry and he weren’t enemies nor polite acquaintances nor platonic friends. They were something else entirely. Something
‘They’ll be back,’ Draco dismissed, ignoring the glare Ron sent him. He did remove his hand, though. ‘Tell me something, would you? Have you seen Harry?’
Harry followed eagerly to the dorms. With a flick of his wand, Draco lit a few candles, scattered bulbs of yellow light on the dressers and bedside tables, and then turned back to Harry, who was scanning the room.
‘I’ve no idea how you haven’t died of sugar overdose,’ he said, glancing at all the tarts stacked neatly inside the box.
'Harry,' he said as he carefully untangled one of his hands from his pale hair. 'Keep playing with this one, yes? It'd be a shame to forget it after I spent so much time on it.'
heard it. Perhaps his orgasm had dropped a millisecond before Draco uttered the words, and they’d been drowned under the sound of blood rushing in his ears.
‘It is, but Rowena doesn’t know it yet,’ Blaise huffed. ‘She seems to find him funny,’ he laced an arm around Pike’s shoulders. ‘I’ve no idea why. Tonight I’ll shift her attention from him to myself.’
He flew off. Draco searched absently for the telltale shimmer of gold across the field, but the Snitch was still nowhere to be seen. Harry was even higher than him, by the Slytherin hoops. He was still holding onto the broomstick with only one hand.
'No. It might come as a surprise to you, Potter, but not everyone's idea of a pleasant night involves obscene amounts of alcohol.'
The bathroom - blessed be Merlin - didn’t have a queue. As soon as the faceless drunk inside stumbled out, they were replacing him in the cramped space, slamming the door shut behind them, shedding their robes in a frenzy and kissing against it.
‘Most of them,’ Pansy said - and her smile was perfectly poised into the emptiest little thing, and Draco had known since first year that she only showed nothing when she had something to hide.
'Thanks,' Harry's smile was bright, and Draco was very, very pleased. Then, his eyes narrowed, and he stopped between Draco and the door. 'Is this you getting rid of me again?'
Draco impatiently wiped the rest of the blood on the back of his hand. There were red splatters on his shirt.
‘Oh Merlin, Sue, how helpful,’ Harry glared, before sighing. He very pointedly did not look at Draco when he continued, ‘We’re talking the first time, right? I figure Draco would be the one fucking me, then.’
Harry, on his part, met his gaze with a warm intensity, like they were alone, like three of Draco’s friends - past friends, he’d hardly talk to them after this - weren’t watching in hopes of making them squirm.
it - but he couldn’t die, only because Draco had been sensible enough to forfeit the game, which meant
Hermione’s eyebrow remained impeccably arched. She took her own glass in her hand. ‘You’ll succeed, if you want to hang out. I mean it, Malfoy.’
‘Well, you can,’ Draco rasped out. ‘You can, love, come for me, you’ve done so well, so wonderful, fuck, I love you so bloody much.’
tedious. Such was the problem of gentle brilliance - like a poem, she served to be loved or admired, not to chat with. Blaise was enraptured by her all the same, and he leaned over the table to drink every rhythmic line she spoke; Pike followed the conversation quietly, his angular features shadowed by the red light; Draco, who was compressed between his friends in the claustrophobic space, knees bumping against Blaise’s and his back often shoved by strangers, was focusing on his firewhiskey, hoping its warmth would calm him and finding instead that it only enhanced his paranoia. He’d lost track of what his group was saying, choosing instead to spy the door through the dense crowd as if at any moment some recognizable Gryffindor would stumble through it.
Satisfied, Draco pressed a sweet kiss right in the middle of Harry's chest and set to work on making Harry's right nipple as red and hard as the left one. Every so often, between teeth and tongue, he'd glance sideways to make sure Harry kept teasing it - he always did, though with tentative fingers, circling around it and swiping a thumb over it. Probably too sensitive, the poor thing - Draco wondered what would happen if he sucked on it again, nibbled at it ever so slightly. He was certain Harry would rip a strand of his hair off.
Slowly, he got back to his old rhythm. He’d walk through the halls with his chin up and his eyes cold; he’d retreat in the edges of the school - the greenhouses, the lake, the first scattered trees of the Forbidden Forest -, where he could loosen his composure and relax away from hateful eyes. He talked to Blaise, Pike and the other 8th grade Slytherins. He talked to Pansy and ignored each attempt she made to talk about that night. He watched the Golden Group from afar, and suppressed the urge to distort their voices, when he heard them hushed and calm in class, into the joyful, uninhibited high-pitches he’d been witness to. He tried to hate Potter, so he’d feel a little less heartbroken.
He finally picked up the pace into something ruthless and frantic, tight, like he found Harry liked best, bringing him right over the edge. And Harry - wonderful, beautiful Harry - did just as asked:
It revealed itself a particularly awkward situation, sitting next to Potter. The drinks soon came, and everyone was drinking their firewhiskey with giddy smiles, and talking in crossed conversations, and Harry - of course, because that was his element, those were his friends - was very fine with
‘I don’t, mind you,’ Harry snorted. ‘Bloody difficult to get at Hogwarts. I’ll have to start using yours.’
. But Blaise hadn’t noticed it, hadn’t believed it perhaps, and it bothered him, therefore he tried to bother Draco in turn.
‘Malfoy,’ Harry warned as he eased down the waistband. ‘You can’t make fun of me. I’ll leave you with your dick out if you do.’
hands… Shameful, the lot of them. But they'd leave, skitter off to another venue in no time, and no one would see Draco and he'd swiftly return to Pansy once they were gone, properly apologize and then force her to give up on this forsaken plan and turn in for the night.
'What- fuck, what a little pervert you turned out to be,' Draco huffed, too breathless to be a proper laugh, too wanton to be a proper jab.
The eighth years still had class in Greenhouse Seven, working around the seventh year’s schedule. Through the wide leaves of potted knotgrass and the lazily coiling tentacles of a dazed Venomous Tentacula, he caught sight of Harry, chatting in a little circle with Ron and Hermione. His glasses were freshly clean, his hair poorly tamed, his expression one of lighthearted innocence, and he laughed and spoke in unintelligible sounds, too far from Draco, inaccessible under the mundane sunlight. He didn’t meet his gaze - never did, always impossibly evasive, infuriatingly carefree. When Professor Sprout shuffled in, two bags of dirt in her callused hands, Harry split off into his work group and turned his back to Draco, thus ensuring he’d be able to stare at nothing besides the stripe of bare skin on his neck for the rest of the lesson. It was cruel, really. Unfair that Draco was the only one that
Draco sent him an unimpressed look and slowly, deliberately withdrew his lips. Harry's dick did a little desperate twitch, and Draco had the most undignified thought of just swallowing it whole again.
It didn’t mean he’d get one, though. And that didn’t necessarily mean terrible things, did it? Harry could keep his back turned all he wanted and still be looking forward to their strange tutoring session as much as Draco. Fearing it as much as Draco. Obsessing over the previous night as well… maybe he couldn’t stop thinking about sucking Draco off, maybe he wanted to do it again, maybe he missed the taste of it; maybe he couldn’t wait until they were alone in that classroom again so he could press himself against Draco and kiss him senseless.
They walked off; Draco didn't dare follow them with his gaze, scared that he'd meet Potter's eye. It overcame him then, the notion that Granger would inevitable babble over their encounter, and gesture their way with subtle movements of lean neck and angled shoulders, and though she might aim for diplomat in her retelling of the story, and Longbottom would never conjure enough individuality to add any detail beyond her words, it was certain that their entire group - Potter included - would very quickly become aware that Malfoy and Parkinson, the two peremptory Slytherins, were there, and not in a particularly friendly mood.
Draco smirked. How strange it was, meeting here in the morning: a seamless merging of night, when Harry was close and open and possible, and day, when the sunlight hid him out of view. It felt as private as dawn, as romantic as dusk.
Of course, Harry kept zooming higher and higher, past two Beaters who were fighting for the Bludger, rising above most of the players. Draco sighed, leaned lower on his broomstick and flew up to meet him.
'Then bloody shut up,' he retorted with a smirk before engulfing him in warmth again, holding his hips against the wall both for the pleasure of seeing Harry pinned down and to keep himself from touching his erection, lest he come in his jeans.
'They've been in there a long time,' Harry said, almost a complaint, like they were extending their welcome, like those miserable minutes would have been enough to properly shag someone.
‘Of course I’ll bloody go,’ Draco rolled his eyes. There was nothing in this world that would make him miss it - every fiber in his body was already coiling with excitement. ‘I’d just like to know why you chose the actual coldest classroom in the entire school.’
Draco really wished he’d never been with Harry those two nights - now that he’d heard his voice soft and happy, it hurt much more to hear him angry.
‘No,’ Draco was quick to say, though his tone was still flat, stunned. ‘No, I’m sorry,’ he added, and then he was following Harry down, bracketing his head between his forearms, kissing those tense lines from his red lips, soft and appeasing and taken by some overwhelmed urgency, some sudden feeling of inadequacy, since it truly was Harry’s
Draco kissed him softly, a hand on his hip, the other holding the box of heart-shaped pastries between their chests.
Harry just quirked an eyebrow. Draco was drawn to the red shimmer over his eyes again. ‘Familiar with the concept?
‘Is this your first date, then?’ Tracey went on. Harry’s eyes widened in surprise, and Tracey smiled sharply. ‘Draco really won’t tell us anything, you see? I hoped you might be the one to ask.’
The potion swished in the cauldron as Harry moved it away from the flame and back to the desk. A whiplash of sugar as he fluttered past - then, cold empty air. The moment dissolved. A second after, Draco followed.
A rush of wind overcame him as he swooped up; the whirlwind around him dizzied him, and he flew unsteady, wavering through a frenzy of chasers hunting the Quaffle. Idly, he mused that he truly hadn’t considered the Bludger in his little impulsive fit of bravure - his senses were far too dulled to watch out for it. He’d end the match with his ribs through his kidneys.
He turned in a frantic swing and walked out the brittle door. A wisp of excited chatter from outside was heard before the door creaked closed again. Draco’s gaze followed the movement disinterestedly - in his mind, crisp and loud in the promise of nightmares to come, Harry’s words played back and forward: ‘don’t tell her’. That was the supplicant tone of terrible secrets. That was the urgency of undisclosed fetiches and affairs and petty, embarrassing crimes. That was the type of frenzied rush that bleeds into fear. That was proof - because Harry had been too tender before, and the world had been too pink and hopeful, and Draco should know better by now - that whatever Harry was offering was a deal beyond walls and in hushed words.
Alicia Spinnet, as Draco recognized her now, bumped Luna’s side, though it seemed to offset her own balance more than anything else. They made quite the pair, the two of them - Luna, a year younger than him, small and reminiscing of a flower; Alicia, a year older, fierce in her fit, confident posture. He didn’t even understand why Alicia had returned to Hogwarts - she was supposedly retaking some N.E.W.T, but she simply spent all her time around the first year Quidditch novices, coaching them around with Madam Hooch.
Offensive bright lights were reflected on the wet cobblestone in front of the Three Broomsticks. They faded and blended and changed from hues of green, to red, to yellow, to blue. It was dreadfully on the nose and ridiculously childish, as Draco knew it would be, and there were yells already audible from the street, and everyone would undoubtedly be drunk and
He didn’t miss it when Harry winced. In retrospect, perhaps Ginny’s love life hadn’t been the safest subject. Still, something in Draco was glad the words had slipped out of his mouth, even if ill-thought - what better way to see if Harry still liked the young Weasley? Hermione had told him Harry planned on asking Leanne out, and he’d
The waitress scurried off, Neville counted them to make sure Finnigan had ordered right - he hadn’t, but Ginny and Hermione would share - and Draco suppressed the urge to fiddle with his hands where they rested in his lap.
‘It’s alright,’ he nodded, slow, meaningful - and Draco didn’t deserve him, did he? This boy he’d encouraged the Slytherin house to hate, who now forgave them so readily, who was all kindness and good.
Draco didn’t even spare the ginger a glance, training his eyes, resolute and challenging, on Harry. He would have rathered his words had been enough, but, then again, why would Harry have listened to him? He hadn’t listened to Hermione. How foolish of Draco to think he bore any influence - oh, he’d kissed Harry, he’d blown him, he’d tasted him and held him and made him come, but it didn’t mean they were any
'Well, you obviously want to shag him,' she smirked, 'And spend every waking moment with him. And kiss the ground he walks on. Would you
Blaise and Rowena, who were leading, winded down the corridors in an infuriatingly slow pace, the type of languorous, sticky thing from poetic love, where one thinks they’ve the time to smell flowers and doze off in peaceful fields. They took a short flight of stairs, during which Draco refused to meet Harry’s quizzical eyes, and at last stopped in front of a heavy wooden door with a pair of lazily triumphant smiles.
Draco clenched his jaws, staring bitterly at the box in his hands, then moved to get a seat at the tables.
Draco sighed. They were stuck in these molds of their past selves: too distrustful to accept gentleness, too cautious to admit weakness.
He placed his book down gingerly and, sweeping a wisp of silvery hair - unicorn hair, as Luna had called it - from his eyes, he peeked out the entrance to the commons into the cold corridor of the dungeons.
'Draco! Darling, there you are! Potter's been out for so long, where on Earth were you?' Pansy's gaze was secretly reproaching as she neared them, and openly mocking.
The very next morning, amidst the flurry of lazy, sleepy-eyed students taking advantage of the weekend to replenish their school supplies at Scrivenshaft's Quill Shop, Draco and Harry took the train out to Hogsmeade. The snow dangled in the air, almost sheer with the clear morning light, smooth chatter filled the streets, Madam Puddifoot’s rested in its self-satisfied and eccentric pink, the building equivalent to a Cheshire smile. Draco had always been bothered by it, most particularly by the obnoxious happiness it endorsed, all lovebirds with shared teacups and heart shaped pastries. Now, as a lovebird himself, he felt nothing but a tingling sense of pride when he walked through the door.
again: did Finnigan call him that when they were alone? He’d never called him that before, when they were surrounded by friends - Draco had never
Pansy wasn’t where he’d last seen her. She wasn’t sitting in one of the tables, nor in the middle of the crowd. She wasn’t in line for the bathroom either. Draco flattened against a wall by the stairs and waited for a little while some lanky Ravenclaw blew smoke in his face, feeling the vibrations of the slow, low-toned music against his back, until he was sure Potter's group would have left - then, he ventured out into the cold street to look for Pansy.
‘Of course,’ he nodded. He knew it, because he’d been thirteen at some point. Still, he figured it might be somewhat entertaining when mixed with alcohol.
‘I love you,’ Harry said, tender words ending with a mischievous smile. ‘D’you want me to get some veritaserum and prove it?’
His words held a very subtle authority, enough to dispel all laziness, and everyone began channeling up the little street. Finnigan met up with Thomas, Luna and Sue’s pace was brisk - Draco stayed a while back, alone, the group melding into one close herd beyond him, and his eyes chased a sign of Harry. He found him leaning against the opposite wall with Neville, their heads bowed in private whispering. Ron shouted something at them and they followed between giggles, Harry swallowed in black robes. He seemed good, and he didn’t look at Draco once.
He thought he’d feel embarrassed, or some instinctive sort of regretful under her judging gaze - her
For the moment he tipped his head back to drink, for those precious seconds he felt the brew run fast down his throat and pool in his stomach, he could suppress the panic of having said it aloud for the first time. He could pretend the words didn't exist; that they weren't now part of the world, vibrations in the air, as real as any solid thing. Then, Pansy stood up, and fear washed over him in one sickening wave.
Outside, the snow crunched under their feet while they walked. They took the winding streets, a lazy pace to make time until the next train. Draco, in reminiscence of that first night in Hogsmeade, carried the box of pastries. This time, however, Harry hovered as close as he wanted to take each tart, they brushed arms and touched hands, and they both knew exactly why Draco had bought the ghastly things. No need to lie - Draco thought back to that moment at Honeydukes where he’d ached to loop his arms around Harry and settled for curt humour instead, and he felt unspeakably grateful to all things in such a sickly sweet way that he could have eaten one of the tarts and felt entirely no difference.
‘Potter, bloody hell,’ Draco groaned, trying to keep his tone hushed. He gripped the edge of the cold desk for support as Harry swallowed around him and his tongue, as Harry shifted it in his mouth, flicked over his slit. It felt
‘You wouldn’t follow the measurements even if it had them,’ Draco drawled, earning him a glare. Harry haphazardly scattered some wormwood on the water - really, there ought to be some conscious effort in being so inept at Potions after seven and a half years.
And it’d have felt like he wasn’t talking to Draco at all if it weren’t for the most fleeting of touches to his arm, a gentle squeeze to his elbow before he was grabbing his bag of candy from the counter and heading for the door.
There was some tossing in the bed. A blur of black hair flashed through, then an inch of pale skin from under the covers.
‘With a spell? Something about the tendons. Wasn’t paying too much attention, to be honest. I reckon Madam Pomfrey would have done it with a snap of her fingers.’
Pansy laughed, dragging him through the crowd and out the establishment. 'I'd like you to be at least somewhat coherent when you talk to The Boy Who Lived.'
He couldn't even get the words out without the most pitiful sigh; it was so dreadfully obvious, really, that he was lovesick. Draco didn't even know how he'd been hiding it all these years.
Tired, hungover Harry Potter, who’d been tripping on the smooth field, laughing maniacally with his delinquent friends, all pretty and carefree and fucking infuriating in his persistent amusement -
He could hear, if he tried enough, the shrill voice of Ron Weasley clashing awkwardly through the pub. Then again, if he
‘Of course I bloody love him, why do you think I’m here?’ he said - and it was hushed, an urgent, furtive whisper, but the words had been spoken aloud regardless. It was now the second time he’d said it. After years of swallowing the words, the achievement made him dizzy.
A lovely plan, in theory. Lovely in practice too, except impossible. Because Draco had quickly discovered that acting regretful was difficult; sincere or not, it wounded his pride. It was unbearable, the thought of showing his remorse so meekly; and it was coded into his mind, being cold.
Harry’s eyes were a billowy black. Slowly, he withdrew his hands from the bag, letting Draco have it.
. And loving Harry had always been so painful. The most pressing, inescapable reminder that something was irremediably wrong with him. And he could try to forget that now, now that Harry smiled back at him and there was some unbelievable glint of tenderness in his future, but Ron remembered.
Draco spared him a side-eyed glance. He was sure the universe had sent him down there just to tease.
Draco walked weary into the playing grounds. While the Slytherin uniforms blended into the dark foliage with their somber greens, the scarlet robes were exuberant spots restless around the area: Alicia Spinnet was whirling low circles in her broom; Dean Thomas was sitting in the wet grass, chin digging into his arm and looking about as hungover as Draco felt; the inescapable Ginny Weasley was surveying the sky with that undeniably charming - and Draco hated her for it - twinkle of competitiveness in her eye; and, next to the open box at the center of the grounds, staring at an agitated Bludger, were Ron and Harry, clad in their uniforms, though it fit haphazard on them, like they’d forgotten how to wear it.
, that it'd become his job, his bloody privilege to fucking take care of it now, was threatening to make his own stamina shamefully short-fused.
Is that so?’ Draco mused, cynical. After all, the girl was an amalgamate of Harry’s qualities tied up haphazardly: the challenge without the humour, the bravery without the charm, the threat without the vulnerability. Much too rough, all the brute strength of Gryffindors, the violence of the red without the finesse of the golden. A feral cat, not a lion. ‘I don’t see the appeal.’
And then he was pulling him down an alley between crooked houses, clearly not expecting an actual response from his friends.
'Don't be daft,' Ron rolled his eyes, 'What we're doing is bloody stupid. She didn't want to have anything to do with it.'
A moment later, more faces - Neville, Ron, Finnigan, Pansy - were peering curiously through the door. And Harry simply looked
Draco's knees almost went weak that. Wasn't it simply the most dizzying thought, having Harry on his bed,
Harry bristled. He lowered his gaze back to the ground, as if looking for the Snitch again. He looked a lot less friendly, and something in Draco went tight and panicked.
‘You can take mine,’ came Pansy’s voice. She stood, navy dress shimmering lightly, and drew a polite smile. ‘Draco, join me for a shot.’
'I'm sorry, could you please hurry?' came a different voice, tamer than the first one, followed by a short knock on the door.
Harry was surrounded by Gryffindors before he could get to him. Alicia Spinnet was kneeling besides his head, saying some unintelligible things in a commandeering tone. Ginny, as well, was kneeling beside him, jaw set and eyes soft, all of her the perfect lover. Ron had just landed, and was running towards the small crowd. Even the little figures in the stands were hurrying to the field.
Harry groaned at the question, eyes widening so prettily, even more when Draco, with a lecherous smile, sunk primly to his knees.
‘Harry. Luna,’ it was Blaise’s voice, and Draco was instantly tense. But Blaise was pure grace in his signature condescending politeness. ‘Forgive Draco and Pansy, they’re awful slow tonight. This is the part where they’d hold out their hands and lead you down.’
He hadn't forgotten, but he'd convinced himself that maybe it would be alright - that Pansy herself might, amidst the whirlwind of her life, not have given it a second thought. That Friday would trudge along as uneventful as ever, and that he'd retire to the Slytherin's common room at dusk not to hear the excited laughter of all the students taking the night train to Hogsmeade. No distractions, no pathetic fantasies: he'd stay in and finish his Transfiguration homework before going to bed.
'You shouldn't come,' Draco mused. He tapped his second finger against the red, puffy rim to watch it flutter.
Closing the distance, Harry tapped curious fingers over a narrow jar of Gillyweed. He let them fall to the desk with an amused huff.
of Harry's fingers on his skin, and he was now fearing that he'd actually left the Three Broomsticks and gone to Hogwarts, and all of this - the bathroom, the distant music, the Phoenix glitter, Harry touching his bare chest - were nothing more but one of those lucid, bittersweet dreams that always made him somber and aloof the morning after.
’Didn’t Hermione show you the head thing? It’s wicked,’ Harry snapped the lid of the red glitter, sliding the bright flames across his skin. ‘Who do you think wins?'
Draco allowed himself a small, victorious smile before he followed them. It was slightly unbelievable, that he was strolling around the dungeon halls with Weasley and Finnigan. He wasn’t sure if he’d made the right choice. All he knew was Weasley better tell Potter about it.
nice,' Harry panted against his mouth, and Draco, whose mind had short-circuited as he tried to pull Harry as close as possible, took entirely too long to remember what they were talking about. When he did, he let out a surprised laugh.
They clambered onto their brooms. A pregnant pause: Draco breathed in, shivering in the freezing wind, and tightened his grip on the slim wood of his broomstick. Then, the familiar high-pitched hiss of a whistle, instinctively riling every fiber of his body.
'One day you'll tell me that whole story,' Draco sighed, though he couldn't quite mask his fondness, and took him by the hand. 'Come on, dear.'
It made him look, even unwittingly. Hermione’s arms were crossed, drowned in her black robes, her eyebrow raised. She seemed fierce in her friendliness now.
He buttoned up his shirt. The situation figured to him as this: everyone else, according to what Harry had told him, thought he’d felt ill and left. A nice, tight lie courtesy of Hermione Granger, who, he now remembered with a sudden weight in his throat, was aware of Draco’s feelings for Harry. He was still, therefore, in the same despairing hole from before; only now, if - when - Hermione told Harry, Harry would be able to look back at Draco on his
‘We ought to have added more Gillyweed,’ Harry giggled - it sounded like it cost him, a pained, helpless noise, and he tucked his head into the crook of Draco’s neck.
Draco was a proud person. This, however, dark-rooted and shameful, was much beyond any hope for dignity.
‘I’ve seen one, you know? One night, on a beach. I find them very friendly, murtlaps,’ Luna said, twirling a strand of hair with her finger. The stunted pause was broken, the separate conversations resumed, and Draco slowly relaxed again.
'The secret ghost ball was more than enough as a distraction, really. Besides,' he closed the distance with a slow smile, arms looping around Draco's neck. 'You more than make up for it.'
Harry shot him a glare. The lights, which had turned yellow now, made the flaming glitter on his eyelids shine brighter. He looked mesmerizing in his fury.
Harry snorted and kissed back, just the briefest press of lips before he pushed away with his hands on Draco’s chest. ‘Thanks for helping,’ he murmured.
Ron chuckled from the side, where he was watching the exchange. And why wouldn't he laugh as his friend deemed to talk to Draco, to spare him a breath, to offer him any word in that tone no pain nor tragedy had dulled down - that still sang warm and bright like when Draco had first met him, and gone to bed for months after with one exclusive thought in mind: that Harry Potter would not be his friend, even though he could surely give him better clothes than the hideous sweaters Weasley's mother got him for Christmas, and make him laugh much louder than the little huffs he could see him breathe out during breakfast, when Draco stared at him across the Great Hall.
Harry’s gaze heated at that. A relief, really, for Draco himself felt a stirring heat from his words. What pretty marks he could leave on Harry’s body to match the glittery red of the lipstick.
They watched the rhythmic rippling of the water in silence. So strange it was that, dozens of feet beneath them, he’d stared at the depths of the lake from the darkness of the Slytherin common room, pining for Harry late at night. Now here they were, lit by sunlight like a blessing, arms entwined as they shivered from the wind which wisped through the spindly trees, two blurring silhouettes lost between the immensity of the clouded skies, the grey lake and the somber castle looming behind them.
Granger knew. Hermione Granger knew, and sure, she was kind, and sure, she’d said she would forget it, but Draco was closely acquainted with empty promises: people didn’t simply forget, and curiosity always won. No one was saintly enough - well, maybe Potter - to stick with a flimsy promise made to a sort of enemy. As soon as he was gone, Hermione would tell Harry and Ron everything; even if she wasn’t certain, she’d recount the strange conversation, and Harry would
‘Thank you,’ he murmured, and then he was coaxing him down with a hand on the back of his neck and kissing him.
to do it. How bloody hard is it to say ‘sorry’?’ Harry retorted. His lips were pressed into a line, like he was disappointed, and that bloody Muggle drink really was affecting Draco, because he couldn’t even pretend not to care.
But Harry didn’t humour him, which Draco really thought was quite cruel. What was Madam Puddifoot’s for, in all its pink frills and rose water, if not for unapologetic, saccharine confessions of love?
it, and Draco was drunk on his every moan and small thrust onto his tongue, and he pushed in as much as he could until his jaw was numb, a proper rimjob to make him see how could good it could be, how good Draco could make it, everyday if he wanted it, if he let him.
him exactly. Just… amused. And Draco had definitely drunk too much, because he couldn’t for the hell of him figure out what that meant.
Like he expected, Ron and Hermione both settled on him pairs of awkward eyes, wavering between friendly and unsure. Little did it matter, though. Harry smiled, and Draco could focus on nothing else.
At least that made him laugh, though it was a fickle little thing. Pansy rolled her eyes, and Draco saw in them, for a split second, some mischievous glint in them, right under the green shimmer, before she raised her voice:
‘When you do - if you do - tell them I’ll come along. Better yet, don’t tell them. I’ll come all the same.’
He waved, a fleeting movement that died in his wrist, and scurried off the corridor in a brisk pace.
‘No,' Harry murmured. Every shred of humour had been swept off his face. His eyes, without the glasses, were eerily intense, 'I thought… with what Snape did, I thought it would be small.'
‘Of course,’ he was quick to say. She moved to the side, and he was reaching for the door when he thought better of it and called out after her retreating form, ‘Granger! Granger,' he faltered, 'I didn’t mean to hurt him. Don’t- don’t let people think I did.’
The moment Draco woke, he was untethered to all physical things, and in him reigned a sweet reminder of gentle things.
But Harry didn’t seem to be listening. His gaze was raking over Draco worriedly. Just under his eyebrows there was still the slightest hint of unwashed glitter, sticking to the tender skin, and Draco had a disturbing flash of the bathroom stall, and jutted hips shaking, and Harry’s breathy tone as he’d whispered Draco’s name.
‘Amazing first time,’ Harry hummed. He sounded all soft and liquid - Draco wished he could be like that forever, never worried, never tense. ‘I’m glad I waited around for you.’
- he wrapped his fingers around Harry's cock and stroked it fully, firm and slow, feeling the flesh twitch in his hand.
'Well,' Draco settled lower on his own seat, resting his hands over his slowly rising chest. 'If you don't mind me, I'll be here, cheering for
To anyone who's read this fic, who's left a kudos or a comment, thank you, you've all very successfully stroked my ego, I hope I see you guys in whatever I write next~
Harry's broken noise was precious - Draco took the opportunity to slide a second finger in, stroking his dick to distract him from the stretch. Prodding slowly through the tight channel - so
thought I’d made it explicit enough that you didn’t have to ask,’ Harry smirked. To make his point - and to tease, the twat - he thrust up and found Draco’s crotch again, slotting their clothed erections together.
The name - the first time he’d heard it from Harry, he believed - was enough to vanish his smile. In its place, open and reverent and so vulnerable that it trembled in the wind, remained only the purest form of love.
Did he even know he was there? Had he seen him walk out with Finnigan, lip swollen and shirt sprinkled red? It wasn’t like there’d been an announcement of some sort: it was perfectly possible that most of the group hadn’t noticed his presence. He would follow like a leech, and when they turned and saw him lean and dark and bloodied-mouthed they’d scream.
like Harry, with his strong jawline and his liquid eyes, the jungle of black hair that begged to be tamed - to be tousled even
Their hips had aligned themselves on their own accord. Harry was seemingly trying to drive Draco mad with that fact, pressing up often and briefly in a dizzying tease of friction.
Harry's smile only widened - and the contrast of the lipstick with the white of his teeth would actually be the death of Draco.
Draco thought back to the tight group of silhouettes he’d seen from the Astronomy Tower. He didn’t fancy the idea of running into them, though he did crave some fresh air.
Draco wanted to laugh; it came out a hum around Harry's cock. He was tempted to really do stop. Keeping Harry on the edge a little longer, pink in the most lovely shade of desperation, was ridiculously appealing. Besides, if this was the only time Draco got to have this, he certainly wanted to make it last.  But he was too taken by his own arousal, and any shred of patience had been overruled by the primitive, obscene wish of seeing Harry fall apart.
And they were drinking, along with Sue and Thomas, not the firewhiskey but the wretched Muggle shots, and Draco was absolutely transfixed with the entire exchange, and almost painfully obsessed with the colour of Harry’s cheeks, and the dip of his neck as he drank, and the
‘I don’t bloody get you. You say things, like - like what you said in the storage room - like you want to be
'I don't think I like some of your friends,' Harry mused once they reached the deserted dungeon corridor. The ghostly symphony was but a faint murmuring in the back of their ears.
‘Fuck,’ Draco groaned. When one laughs so much their eyes tear, their stomachs shrink and they can’t breathe - that’s how it felt now. Laughter and lust: it was all the same. It all consumed, it all pooled impossibly urgent within him, it all
‘Just answer the bloody question, Malfoy,’ Harry snorted. He was taking apart the pile of books now, lean fingers treading over their spines, and Draco was assaulted by the thought that he had
They took a seat by the window, ordered some chamomile, leaned close over the table, and Draco could look into Harry’s eyes - the green duller from the early morning, slower, sticking to everything - and know so simply that no other couple in that place, no matter their coy smiles and entwined fingers and pretensions of love, felt as strongly as the two of them did in that moment. It wasn’t even selfish to say, no, but exquisite fact: they were the height of love.
‘Ages ago. We were waiting for you slowpoke,’ Sue said before turning to Draco. ‘Why’d he punch you?’
Neville volunteered to begin the game: he carefully chose an orange bean with yellow flecks. It turned out a harmless citrus flavour.
. Not that he didn't love the sight of glorious Potter writhing between graffitied walls; he just wanted it to mean more. He wanted to be able to do it, and to tuck Harry back into his jeans afterwards, to kiss him warmly, to get back to Harry's friends' table and sit there with his arm around him, Harry's official, stupidly smitten and bloody
Harry rolled his eyes. He was clasping Draco’s shoulder more securely now, though his steps were still stunted, slow, coaxed by Draco. He looked annoyed about the whole thing more than anything else - it was bloody endearing, and Draco was holding in the urge to smile like a fool. Perhaps it had been a few years too late, but he’d gotten his ballroom dance after all.
- bloody hell, would you fucking… these buttons are fucking sewn on…’ Harry complained. Draco snorted and took his shirt off over his head. The cold air prickled at his bare skin; Harry’s hands were impossibly hot. ‘Anyways- here, yeah?’
'D'ya boys mistake this for a bedroom, did ya?' snickered one of them. The other men laughed, and each one made sure to elbow the two of them as they pushed their way past and down the little staircase. Overall, it wasn't the worst reaction they could have gotten - no shouting, no pushing at chests. They quickly stumbled out of Kettle Bottom, slipping arms into their robes.
Also, gratuitous headcanons about the iconic every flavour beans follow ahead, because it's my life's goal to turn everything into a drinking game (including life itself).
Harry breathed out, slipping one hand between them to try and unbutton Draco’s slacks. ‘Malfoy, please.’
There, staring intently at a dusty helmet that laid on the rough stone floor, was none other than Ron Weasley.
‘No, darling, we’re going to Madam Puddifoot’s for tea. Quit being dense and get off the bloody sofa.’
,’ Harry retorted, but his concern had somewhat ebbed, replaced by humour. ‘Was the vodka too much for you?’
It was barely a compliment, said in that snarky tone of Harry’s, but Draco was ridiculously proud all the same.
And the words froze on his tongue, but his hips were already snapping forward and Harry crumbled on his forearms with a drawn out sound, something
‘Oh, yes,’ Harry’s small laugh was a surprised little thing. ‘It’s a recent friendship, I guess. We’re actually… heh....’ he waved a hand around, looking at Draco unsurely.
something. He’d been growing an inkling of hope all night, fragile and tentative, after years of heartbreak - and there was no excuse, and he should have known better, because he was the unlikeable Draco Malfoy and Harry was the marvelous Harry Potter, and maybe he’d been extended an invitation, because Harry was simply too friendly and kind and
Draco sighed, dropping his head to Harry’s shoulder. Figures the git wouldn’t maintain one line of focus even then. His lips caught wetly on the warm skin of his neck when he spoke:
He did always walk around with his cheeks slightly pink - which Draco had blamed on the little strolls he liked to take between classes, in the winter, out into the white snow; or all the impromptu Quidditch games he’d start during the warmer seasons, as if the the very notion of being still for longer than ten minutes drove him insane. And his lips were always a shade too red - obscenely so, like he’d done it on purpose, like it was some cruel plan to assure Draco could get absolutely no work done while Harry was within his field of sight, chewing on the scruffed edge of his quill with those bloody red lips. It would make
He got a scarlet bean that tasted like cherries. Sue opened her mouth to ask him a question, eyes teary from how tipsy she was, certainly planning on asking something incredibly inappropriate, but Hermione beat her to it. Furthermore, Hermione wasn’t tipsy but rather eerily sharp when she spoke:
Harry laughed. ‘Do you still feel the burn?’ he asked. When Draco nodded, his eyes darkened. ‘Well, let me feel it.’
‘You’re fucking-’ Draco breathed with another kiss, this time under his eye, ‘-fucking adorable, Potter.’
‘Then go on ahead and meet the others,’ Pansy shrugged. ‘I’m sure Draco and I will survive without you droning around us.’
'Your bed and your bed only, understood? I don't want to have to wash my sheets,' Blaise said. He stepped forward then, stretching a hand with an impatient flick of wrist. 'And hand me Lovegood's bag, or else she'll go looking for it. I doubt you want to be interrupted.'
With a frustrated tensing of his lips, Draco turned again and set out to find Granger through the crowd.
‘That it does,’ Dean smiled. ‘We’re going out to celebrate tonight. You should come. I mean, if it went well. If it didn’t, though, it’d help take your mind off it.’
bloody awful,’ Draco scoffed, not quite schooling the concern which had crispened his features. He took a better look at Harry then: he could see the thin, dark line of Harry’s scar under a strand of hair, a subtle purpling disappearing into his hairline, another bruise - they never ended - sprouting just under his skin, and a precarious twinkling in his eyes, as if he’d been subsisting throughout the day on a measly reservoir of adrenaline and now, like the bright oranges of a wooden log before the blades are extinguished, his energy pulsed for one last valiant effort before he drifted off to sleep.
Draco couldn't force out one single miserable word. His mouth didn't even open; he just stood there, back against the wall, cold gaze locked on Harry's figure like it saw nothing there except for snow and cobblestone.
And the name was uttered so soft, tone stale from sleep, so perfectly intimate and domestic, that all the tension in Draco melted. Ron’s words dissolved, all anger faded, and he was suddenly very small and very weak, and his head hurt and he loved Harry, and all he wanted was to crawl into that bed with him and never leave.
Seamus Finnigan had just rounded the corner, freezing with a pair of keys in his outstretched hand when his wild gaze found Draco.
Harry gave him a pointed look, withdrawing his good arm from under the covers to wave a hand around absently. Draco was briefly distracted by the vision of smooth, pale skin - there were bruises there. One near his bony elbow had gone an obscene black. Draco thought back to the previous night, his fingers digging into Harry’s hips while he writhed so prettily... had he made bruises then? Small red circles to decorate the spots of skin he’d kissed so sweetly? Were Harry to undress now, would he be able to trace those marks, or would they now be lost under bigger, darker ones?
Draco chuckled, still attached to Harry's ear. The last fluid droplets of his blood had been slithering down to raven black hair - he hoped they'd be hard to remove, that they'd dry up and stain his scalp, so that even if Harry forgot about this, even if he chose not speak about it as he had after that first night, he'd conserve some little bit of him.
‘You're not using my lube to go jerk off. You can ask me and I’ll take care of you myself,’ Draco retorted, and he really did like that picture - Harry
. Not even the bloody Boy Who Lived had that high an alcohol tolerance. He’d kissed Draco drunkenly, and he
Hermione was looking at him like one looks at a horrifying, incomprehensible thing; and though with Pansy that private sibilating voice had flourished, under Hermione’s gaze it stuttered.
The wind hissed in his ears, twisting the short strands of hair on his forehead. His sight was still adjusting, his feet stunted and slow, but he made it to the pitch all the same.
Surprisingly enough, they didn’t head to any more bars. Instead, they went down a winding path that cut between the snow and stretched between the pine trees towards the black silhouette of the Shrieking Shack. The sounds of the village were replaced by the wisps of wind through thin branches and twigs and the occasional hoot of an owl.
He was going to Hogsmeade. He was going to Hogsmeade at the same time as Harry. He was going to talk to him.
'You here to ruin anything, Malfoy?' Harry asked, features guarded in that usual protectiveness of his.
‘Of course there are. Potter’s Potter. He likes excitement. Hence the young- Ginny, I mean. Leanne doesn’t compare.’
‘How could he not?’ Ron sighed. ‘If you just told me you were with him - and I know you were, even though you’re both being dicks about it - I could quit worrying.’
Harry’s smile widened with relief. He brought a hand to the back of his neck and kissed him quickly, lightly, a chaste brush of lips.
Draco sent a flittering look at the Fat Lady. So beyond there was Harry, still hiding from the world. He’d managed to wake up for that Quidditch game, and he was hungover then as well - was it worse this time?
It was ridiculous, really - by this point, Hermione and Ron knew more about how Draco felt than Harry himself.
When the silence between them became unbearable, Draco managed to fake a laugh. What had he expected anyway? He’d
And to think that night he’d returned to the dungeons thinking he’d ruined everything; that he’d been set on never facing Harry’s way again, all the while wallowing that he hadn’t been invited to their next night out. And Harry had wanted to
Draco brought the glass to his lips to hide the bitter way they twitched. The snakes in his arms hissed at his wrists. ‘Why did he and the little Weasley break it off?’
‘Absolutely none,’ Draco sighed. ‘Pansy did hint that she fancied someone, but she wouldn’t tell me who it was. They’re a strange couple, aren’t they?’
‘No, it’s not,’ Draco agreed. As he was wont to, though his nerves were still thrumming loud and high-strung, he chased him into the center of the room.
Draco sighed. It occurred to him that they’d had this entire fight while Draco was still sat between the pots of mandragoras, the rain whipping the glass behind his back while Harry glared down at him, and just like that every pretension of anger vanished inside him, and he felt only like a petulant child, throwing a fit over absolutely nothing, and he stared at his own knees.
It figured that he’d try to do that: what good would the name Alihotsy do him if he didn’t find out how to brew it? It wasn’t like he’d manage it by himself - he’d need help. But Draco couldn’t very well let this get to her insufferably moral ears. Really, it’d been ludicrous to share this with a close friend of the known stickler that was Hermione Granger.
Around them the game went on with shrill laughter and the clinking of glasses. The lights were flashing in a hideous mix of white and blue, colouring everyone’s face, and the music was now something with lyrics, a repetitive string of verses in a husky tone, the type of thing that tingles in drunken minds, and it didn’t seem, the entire environment inside the Three Broomsticks, much conducive to serious, tedious conversations. Draco had never been one to apologize. Not in formal, fanciful words, at least - he would have preferred to make amends with Granger through some form of organic gesture, and the prospect of saying sorry now, in the least appropriate scenario, surrounded by people, was considerably unappealing.
Harry snorted. ‘You could say that. But I haven’t been here in years. I didn’t even know they hosted other parties here. And this… at the Deathday party, the banquet tables were in the center. Now, they’re all pushed close to the walls. And our clothes… this is a dance, isn’t it?’
Harry just moaned in answer. His mouth was impossibly hot - from the vodka, from the firewhiskey, from those bloody fluorescent shots they'd had at Hog's Head that had burnt Draco's tongue - and Draco could barely keep himself together.
Draco, whose face was inches away from Ron’s - and Harry’s too, but he was primly ignoring that, lest he have some sort of fit - could see the ginger smirk something wicked.
But how could he have said no, when saying yes made Harry smile that mischievous smile of his, all danger and excitement?
detail - and when he’d at last managed to drag his hunched, dehydrated body to the Great Hall, and seen the other Gryffindors sitting in an awkward bunch on one end of the long table, hiding their shrunken faces between their hands, pointedly facing away from the professors and staring at empty plates and dripping mugs of coffee, he’d been blown away by the realization that he’d spent the night
Draco could feel his heart beating furious against his ribs - did the rhythm reach his skin, did Harry feel it with his fingers? Was Harry's heart beating as fast, with them standing so close, their voices hushed, their breaths, warm and smelling of alcohol, mingling together as Harry tilted his head up, with Harry's hand splayed on Draco's chest?
She’d managed to cut the dense sea of bodies and neared the bar, elbows propped up on it, her wild curls unmistakable. After a lot of pushing and being pushed, and a brief, inarticulate altercation with some worryingly drunk Ravenclaw whose teeth had been transfigured into sapphires, Draco secured a place beside her, sliding in with relative grace and tapping her shoulder.
‘So…’ he said, leaning closer to him - how could he help it, after Harry’s words? ‘I knew I loved you because you looked bloody ghastly in your robes, and you knew you loved me because I broke your arm?’
Draco watched bitterly as Harry joined his friends with a carefree smile, like he’d already forgotten his existence, like the conversation between them had been pleasant, sure, but unremarkable.
‘Well, certainly not for you,’ he drawled; but she was looking more surprised than offended, and he realized he might have been too transparent, so he was quick to add ‘I wanted to piss him off. My team just embarrassed your brother. Maybe you should go help him out instead of talking to me.’
Harry’s response wouldn’t be immediate - and in that lingering silence his cheeks would heat up so lovely and pink, and everyone would know just how much Harry liked sucking cock, how he craved to have his lips slick and spread, his throat convulsing so obediently around
Draco broke through the crowd in search of his table. He could hardly believe he’d been invited again. Finnigan had
‘I love it,’ Harry hummed, eyes twinkling, and he slid his hand up from Draco’s shoulder to tug softly at the silver strands. Draco had to contain a shiver - how easy would it be to answer with ‘And I love you’? How easy, how fluid, and perhaps Harry wouldn’t even find it strange, for in that moment, with the symphony and the spectral light and their bodies so close, the words very simply fit. It was all love - who could blame Draco for acknowledging it?
'Where would you possibly- Draco? Draco!' Pansy called out. Draco didn't turn, didn't speak another word, simply ran towards the narrow, spiraling stairs at the back of the pub, one hand white-knuckled on the flimsy pipe railing to help him up.
Harry promptly made it happen. Draco did as well, purely to relieve the maddening pressure on his dick, and soon they were both naked on the bed. It was a sudden rush of intimacy - they'd never been quite so bare or in somewhere quite so soft. Draco was transfixed by the whole curves of Harry's body, sinuous lines from head to feet, pale skin on
Because the awful Ginny Weasley hadn't drunk when Longbottom had asked who'd ever given a blowjob, which meant Harry had most likely never gotten one, and Draco really fucking wanted to be the
The question was asked innocently enough. But Draco knew Harry knew, and he knew what Harry really meant was ‘what did you tell him?’. It caused a surge of cold in him: this uncertainty in their relationship, or strict lack of it, felt like the desperate moment before he woke up from pleasant dreams.
, when he heard a set of footsteps approach. He turned - to his left, walking towards him, were Hermione, Finnigan and Longbottom.
A couple walked past him. They were swallowed in heavy, black coats, folded over each other, dotted in white; between them, pale and trembling, their hands swayed, fingers entwined.
Draco glared half-heartedly. He couldn’t drink any more. He’d make a fool of himself. But Hermione was doing it, bloody
I’d have guessed fourth year, when I actually started filling out my clothes. I looked like a bloody twig in first year, all skin and bone.’
‘Only been a couple of days, you forgotten already? Oy, hey! Mister, two red rum shots here! You heard me, mate?’
Harry’s eyes were sparkling with challenge, and Draco knew it was the height of irresponsibility, and he’d always despised those that drank recklessly, that allowed themselves that kind of vulnerability, but Harry’s words, the charged look he gave him, made Draco think of another scenario, one where Harry would say the exact same words except they’d be infinitely closer, and their eyes would be on each other’s lips, and so Draco answered like he hoped he would in that picture:
He didn’t see him, but his eyes landed on a wide booth tucked against the far wall, all dark leather, where two damning red heads were. He strode that way.
'You know,' Draco smirked, his lips an inch from Harry's, searching the aftertaste of that broken moan. When he returned his hand to Harry's hip, Harry's own hand stayed on the edge of the sink, all proper and obedient, impatience so tightly contained, and a new, dark surge of want ran over him. 'That night, in that drinking game, I never quite figured out what your kinks were. I suppose I'm making up for that now, aren't I?'
‘Like unicorn hair. I think I’d like hair like Ali’s though - just for a day, I think. To see if it’d feel different.’
‘In a little while,’ Neville nodded. ‘We’ve been taking notes on our Mimbulus every morning, so we really shouldn’t stay too late. I’m thinking some absinthe, no?’
'We might be a little too drunk for this,' Harry snorted, shifting on the sink for a better position.
He turned; his smile, Draco was infinitely relieved to see, didn’t disappear, simply stuttering with surprise. Ginny and Ron both frowned as Draco neared their little circle.
Most likely because of whatever connection the house had with his late godfather. Draco had never been one for gossip, but sometimes he found himself disappointed that this particular story hadn’t been more spoken of - he knew close to nothing as it was, and it bothered him that such a clearly important part of Harry’s life was a stranger to him.
There was an altercation between Chasers right beside him. Draco slipped through them as they pursued the Quaffle, but Demelza Robins’s broom hit his torso and he was thrown, spiralling away to his left. When he regained control of his own broomstick, he’d been gliding for almost thirty feet. Scratches from the bristles of her broom were blooming red and angry on his forearms.
at the thought. Draco himself felt the beginnings of that urge, the instinct to withhold, senselessly and exclusively out of habit. It died out, though. Harry’s smile was so excited, how on earth could he regret it?
Ron stared at it, was about to answer, but Draco realized he didn't much care. 'Give me it,' he said, and, with bottle and keys in hand, resisting the urge to look at Potter, to make sure
Aaaaand the posting schedule has hereby changed to Wednesday and Sunday, because quarantine is a thing and we're all here looking for a distraction.
it, and his gaze was soft, determined, like he had no problem revealing it, like it was just another dumb truth, like Draco hadn’t been thinking of asking that question for
‘Because it was bloody strange,’ Harry snorted. ‘And I was going to say you ought to join us next time - which was fucking obvious, by the way, why else would I mention Hogsmeade? - but you just left.’
In his mind surfaced the picture of them sitting in the stands, watching the haphazard game take place, Harry neatly tucked in the hollow of Draco’s arms, his head on his angulous shoulder while Draco, in turn, rested his own atop his ear, both tired and cracked-lipped and
Draco rolled his eyes. He really did wish Pansy would sit beside him so that she could see it, but the only time he had suggested it she'd slapped his shoulder - she rathered have died in the battle, she said, than to join him on that freezing floor.
Draco tensed his lips, glancing up to the whirlwind of colour and adrenaline going on unbothered by them, uncaring, an impenetrable, uninterruptible force. He knew the feeling, the pull that turned life into the game and people into selfish, reckless
‘I wore red,’ Luna said - and she truly had committed to the colour, crimson in her frilly dress, in the laces in her hair, in the stark pigment shaping her lips. ‘Is red alright?’
After an hour of burrowing holes into Potter's back, Draco was elated to hear Flitwick finally dismiss them. He was gathering up his books when a body crashed against the table, the wood digging into his thigh. He looked up to see Potter struggling for balance, cheeks red, Weasley laughing behind him.
Dean Thomas’s brain eventually catched up with his tongue. ‘Not that- you know. It was- odd, but he didn’t know. He’d have told us if he knew. Don’t tell Slughorn, is what I mean. He’ll get all suspicious for no reason.’
'Is Harry yours then, mate?’ bit back Finnigan. Draco figured he shouldn’t have yelled. He took a deep breath, trying to regain some sense of calm and card away his embarrassment.
Potter chuckled, no traces of surprise in his expression. Even though Draco knew it was justified, knew it was his own fault, it still made him ache.
So Draco dared to lace Harry’s waist with his arm, pressing their sides together, proving at once, in this blissful warm touch that he could never mimic in his most lucid of fantasies, that he was in a dream while very much awake.
He wouldn’t change a thing about them, in all truth - not their first kiss, not their first date, not the years he’d spent pining. No, he wouldn’t change one detail in their middle, not the cruelty nor the yearning, because in this moment, with Harry’s smile so intimate and genuine for him, he knew at once that he’d gotten the perfect ending.
'There's no one at the castle, you know. You could just wait in the library,' Pansy pulled on a thread of his hair, 'He's not there. I checked.'
‘D’you know, Malfoy, everyone wants to move on. It’s the right thing in theory. Give people another chance, and all that. But guess what, Hermione told me you liked him since
Draco hastily grabbed his shot and they downed it in unison. The rum wasn’t too overpowering, warm with the lingering tartness of red currants. It burnt in his split lip. Finnigan laughed a little once he finished it, but it quickly subsided.
It was a mess of ghostly white shifting between the black velvet draperies that lined the tall walls. The glossy black candles on the chandelier bathed the dungeon in gentle light, dim like a dream, casting chilly shadows by the corners. They crossed the threshold - their presence rippled through the air, and dozens of ghostly eyes settled on them. Placid curiosity, a second of it, and then the chatting resumed, thick and unintelligible, the type of incomprehensible cacophony that brings about the feeling that a great party is going on, and that one is incredibly late for it, and that one now has no hopes of fitting in.
He could feel Harry’s soft laughter vibrating against his chest before he pressed a small kiss to it.
The days went past. The whispering got bored and changed aims. Harry Potter wasn’t the name in everyone’s lips anymore. Draco still heard it.
‘Bloody terrible as well,’ Draco said, his smile tender as he regarded Harry from the foot of the bed. He’d never seen him quite as small before - not even in that infirmary bed, where the white had shrunk him to skin and bone. This was Harry in the space where he slept every night, where he woke every morning, where he tossed and turned after nightmares and slowed his breath after climaxing at his own hand. Harry at his purest.
‘You’re the one who started these questions, Malfoy,’ Ron shrugged. He looked rather proud of himself.
The slight tone of complaint there - and that despicable word, so diminishing in its casualness, ‘mate’, sounding in Draco’s ears like a taunt - made Draco inch away. He hovered over Harry, taking a good look at him, searching for any sign of reluctance in his wild eyes.
Harry, oblivious, didn’t even look up to register Draco’s move. His entire focus was on the box, which he opened without preamble. His smile grew wide and deviant, eyes twinkling with mirth.
Draco - opened his legs just so, enough to fit Draco's body between them, and how could Draco resist that?
Finnigan looked at him with wide, confused eyes. Draco got a few stray looks - one from Harry, that made him bite the inside of his cheek - but otherwise the heated conversation continued.
It tingled in his teeth, crickled in his bones. Blood burst bitter in his mouth - it didn’t taste unlike the firewhiskey. His head snapped back, swung back forward almost equally as fast, and with a disoriented sight and a pounding head he met Finnigan.
He finally eased his grip and Harry moved forward to take him in his mouth - but although the sensation was hot and tight and heavenly, it was short-lived. A moment later Harry had to pull out to breathe out a laugh.
It made Harry laugh, at least, though it was a brief little sound before he turned pensive again. And Draco could -
There was a pause, which Draco was fervently hoping didn’t unfold into pity or disgust, and then Finnigan piped up:
Draco tried for innocent too, though he could never look quite as saintly as Harry. ‘Of course. No one’s here to judge, Potter.’
‘When they’re sober, perhaps,’ Draco huffed. Harry laughed, and the soft sound, disarming in its friendliness, prompted him to ask, ‘Are you still cross?’
‘You bullied them into being nice to me?’ he asked, the beginnings of a smile twitching in his lips. Truly, Draco should have locked Blaise in the common room: he spoke too much, and only of what he wasn’t supposed to.
‘Oy! Two shots of vodka, please,’ Harry ordered. He was thrumming with excitement, eyes glazed, muscles lax and twitching restlessly, practically seeping firewhiskey from his pores.
Alicia, who was sitting on Ron’s other side, a flurry of red and golden ribbons entwined in her hair, huffed a laugh. ‘It’s so bright they thought he’d charmed it.’
him. Bloody hell, it would probably have been a more romantic first kiss, the veritaserum coursing through their veins colouring everything in the tenderest of honesty.
‘My arm really hurt, you know? And I thought: fuck Malfoy, he’s a twat,’ he chuckled, ‘But then while I was at the infirmary there wasn’t much to do besides thinking, and
Well, it wasn't like he could refuse to go. There wasn't a fiber in his body capable of walking away.
‘I should?’ Draco murmured. They were so close he could see the sprinklings of the different shades of glitter; the veins running under the flushed skin on his neck, the enticing red blooming in the bite marks on his bottom lip.
Draco frowned, raked Harry’s face at once for any signs of amusement. But he looked serious - hadn’t he said full honesty? - and Draco could hardly believe it. That bloody Quidditch game, that horrible day which still flashed in his memory whenever the wind wisped too quickly through his ears - how was that the moment Harry had known he loved him?
I've written almost the entire thing, so don't worry, no risks of me abandoning it, I shall update every Sunday (unless some fucking tragedy happens, but even then I shall strive to post).
He didn’t move an inch away from Harry, though. Of course not, because he’d fantasised too often about this intimacy, this familiarity, this casual permission to touch. No, this was what friends did - this was the space typically filled by Granger or some indistinct Weasley, and Draco planned to cherish it.
‘I think it’s nice. Festive,’ offered Fletchley. He’d painted his face like a badger. It hadn’t been the most beneficial choice, in Draco’s opinion - it only served to make one think of how similar he indeed was with the animal.
‘Well, next time I’ll just keep you there until you choke, how’s that?’ he mused. Harry’s cheeks went a shade redder, his nails digging crescent moons into Draco’s shoulders.
‘They’d be boring nights,’ Harry murmured then, tone measured, and Draco heard what had been unspoken: restless nights. Tossing. Turning. Nightmares.
Draco glared - but it was pointless to pretend any longer, not when they both knew what his answer would be, so he ended up sighing.
It was Finnigan’s voice, of course. By this point, Draco could hardly hear that loud, chirping tone without immediately feeling like something was about to be taken from his arms.
‘I would have used it regardless,’ Harry’s eyes had sharpened; they made Draco remember the word that had been about to spill from his own lips that day, ‘I don’t get it, Malfoy. You said you never hated me. Why were you going to do it, then?’
For one moment made impossibly slow by the heights of euphoria. Harry just looked at him with ragged breaths, his cheeks as pink as the potion, writhing against Draco’s tight grip on his hair. Then, he seemed to deflate, boneless, soft and vulnerable and mesmerizingly wanton.
Not that it had worked. Because he closed his eyes and he saw neon flashes. He turned corners in the cold corridors, glimpsed at a red and golden tie, and could only think of the pale skin of Harry’s neck under his grey coat. He ate and he felt the sickly sweet taste of treacle tarts on his tongue.
No, it was best to go back to Hogwarts. He wouldn’t even wait for the train; he could go to Honeydukes and bribe the man into letting him use the secret passage back to the castle. The halls would be dark and blissfully quiet; he could try and get himself into the kitchens, put the kettle on, make himself some tea and drink it in the peace of the common room. He wouldn’t go to the library, he wouldn’t spy on Leanne. He wouldn’t wallow on what he couldn’t have. For years he’d survived by denying and suppressing; it wasn’t now, with all these changes, these reckless indulgences in
Draco bit his lip. This time, when teeth broke through crusted blood and sunk into the fresh wound, he didn’t stop.
‘D’you remember what you said, when I asked you about this scar?’ Harry traced a light finger over Draco’s middle, ‘Of course I resent you. It’s a bloody big scar.’
The snow had thinned down by the time they’d gotten on their brooms. The flight to Hogsmeade was leisurely and careful; they zoomed over the lake, which had taken on an eerie silver under the moonlight, and refrained from flying higher than the top of the trees. Draco spent the entire ride trying to ignore the creeping feeling that, somewhere below him, amidst the thick, frosted foliage, Harry was spiraling towards the ground.
The match went on with a distinct lead by the Slytherin team. Weasley was doing a decent job at keeping the hoops, considering how drunk he’d been, but the Slytherin chasers were fit and fresh-minded, and he couldn’t keep up. Ginny - because the perfect little git’s entire role in life was to remind Draco of how inadequate and
That exchange, measly as it had been, was the sole contact Draco had with Harry's group for over a week. At first, Pansy had been certain he'd be invited to the ridiculous game they'd planned, given that he'd helped steal the damn vials. But Friday came and Friday passed - Draco saw, through the window of one of the corridors, Harry's group walking along the snow, huddled in heavy coats, no doubt headed to Hogsmeade.
The train slithered through the snowy mounds and dropped them off at Hogwarts station. They took the enchanted boats across the lake. The other students wandered off with their backs hunched and their arms wrapped around bags of sweets, supplies and trinkets. Harry and Draco stayed behind. There was something new and precious between them, the kind of feeling imperatively fleeting, only experienced once, a tender beginning that could never be revisited, and somehow the unspoken consensus reigned that whenever they stepped into the castle it would be primly snipped away.
He struggled to situate himself in the field. Most of his teammates had gone higher by that point, the action zooming at lightning speed above his head. That treacherous bud of competition, ever lurking in his mind, urged him to meet them. He swerved to the left then, a slow slide through the stinging air, and found Harry a little way off, lips pressed in determination, dark strands of hair jumbled in his glasses. He was staring at Draco, but not really - somewhere farther, surveying the grounds.
him then, and he was so close to confessing it again, whispering it warm and desperate in his ear, so in its place he said, ‘Then again, perhaps it was best Dean was the one to invite me. Because he told me all about your little
‘Yes, I know, you’ve said that twice already. No one’s debating that she’s perfectly nice. Do you think she suits him, though?’
And to this confession Harry’s eyes widened in surprise, then melted into warmth. He opened his mouth to answer, but it was another voice that came out:
Thus, Draco had ended up pressed into that damned shirt, suffocating inside black skinny jeans, platinum hair slicked back, long grey peacoat grazing his knees, and he looked good, he knew he did, but it didn't matter because no one would notice, or maybe this no one would notice like one idly notices a pleasant flower, and this no one would quickly look away - because how could
Harry's arms wrapped  around his neck while they kissed - but the edge of the sink was slim, and Draco's hands were so greedily frenzied in their touch that he didn't quite support him, and Harry nearly toppled over the side. He steadied himself by clipping his thighs tightly against Draco's hips, legs so pretty and trembling around his waist, and Draco moaned at the sensation.
Harry withdrew with an obscene, wet sound. He seemed to be holding in the urge to laugh, a smile teasing his lips.
Harry shrugged. He was tracing up the sinuous line, towards Draco's shoulder. 'I don't know,' he tapped the smooth skin over Draco's sternum, and Draco was honestly going to
Finnigan call him that, because he didn't even slightly start at the name, which meant he'd surely heard it before.
And he was curious, he was, because surely someone would have found out if Harry and Ron and who knows how many more pesky Gryffindors had sneaked into the Slytherin commons, but that was only part of why he was so insistent - it was appealing, in some impulsive, decadent way, to prolong this moment with Potter. To stay there with him, in the cramped, ill-lit storage room, where they could only be as far as a few inches.
Her smile, this time, held some genuine humour. They were pushed aside by a group of people who were trying to reach the bar, and compressed against the edge of it. Draco didn’t think he’d ever been that close to Hermione Granger. Idly, with a hint of nostalgia, he remembered that time in third year when she’d punched him. He’d hardly left his room the following days, too embarrassed to let Potter see his bruised face.
‘Any objections?’ Harry raised an eyebrow, and Draco found himself with nothing to say, which was just as well, because Ron was piping up for his own turn.
Perhaps it wouldn’t be such a bad thing to go back to Hogwarts: he could make some tea and lay down in the refreshing coolness of the dungeons. Besides, Hermione and Neville were hardly bad company. They were actually two of the most bearable of the group. It’d be much more pleasant than hanging around the Three Broomsticks with a head made of lead and that fucking ungodly absinthe swirling in his bloodstream. But then came Pansy’s words, all sharp and firm, waking the same hissing voice inside him that had controlled him in that Quidditch game so many days ago - he couldn’t quite leave Harry there alone, could he? He’d drink so much, most likely stay with his friends until dawn, and with Hermione gone there wouldn’t be many responsible people there to guide the group. What if they got into some drunken fight? Drank too much and went into some sort of fit? Went back to the Shrieking Shack and fell down those decrepit stairs? Really, Draco could be feeling a little - incredibly - sick, but he still had a sense of restraint the Gryffindors lacked. He could help if he stayed - certainly help more than if he didn’t.
Harry rolled his eyes, though it was half-hearted and he was stretching his neck to try and inch closer to Draco. 'I could compliment you
student in that class, and asked Pansy for suggestions. The ache stung just the same on his chest as when he'd stretched his hand to Potter before they were Sorted, and Potter had denied him.
twat had never required more than bravery and loyalty. But, should he ever want more, those eager, adoring eyes would be prompt to help.
‘Is that enough-’ Draco fought off a chuckle as his arousal spiked ridiculously quick. ‘-enough of a reason for you?’
And he sounded convincing, because Potter was the only bloody member of that group that could actually lie, but both him and Ron had spoken earlier about the common room
‘Alright, I got one,’ Harry’s voice cut through his thoughts, ‘When we drank those shots, the other night, it was too much for you, wasn’t it?’
‘Yes, yes, I suppose so,’ he murmured, ‘Get enough for the whole class, mind you. Mallowsweet is such a useful- get enough, enough for the first years too, yes? There’s an experiment with them I’d like to try, a delightful little... ‘
‘Almost,’ Harry moaned. His thumb moved teasingly over Draco’s slit, smearing the weeping precum there; Draco flicked his wrist, moved his fingers up to caress his balls, feeling how full they were, how they curled high and taut, wondering how it’d be if he could trail them towards his arsehole and see the virgin muscle flutter. Harry’s clothes were in the way, however. Besides, he’d denied ‘complicated’. Draco loved to push, not to overstep.
‘Good thing they’re not for me, then,’ Draco mused, a very pleased, relieved smirk gracing his lips as he watched Harry take out one of the small treacle tarts and have an eager bite.
At that, Harry went down to his knees again. Draco’s cock twitched against the cold frame of his glasses, leaving a bit of slickness shining there - Harry Potter, utterly debauched with come on his glasses. Draco was very glad he’d told him to keep them on.
He shifted again, scratching his eyes with the back of his hand to get a clearer view of Pansy. She looked bloody well-rested.
His heart still clutched impossibly tight, however, when he remembered Harry crashing on the ground.
him at once and saw him fit for Harry. The tension cracked, then ebbed away, and the table was freed from its disconcerted silence.
that. Was it that sort of thing one evasively calls a dynamic, when they don’t want to look too deep? Was it flirting? Was it friendly? Finnigan
‘Isn’t it?’ Draco huffed, shifting into a half-sitting position against the headboard. His head pounded, constricting, suffocating like his skull had shrunk too little for his brain. Even the dim light of the candles throughout the dorm room hurt his eyes.
Harry hummed, squeezing Draco's middle a little tighter. 'Great first date. A little short, though.'
, so, even if he didn't quite know what was happening, his instincts - phantom muscle memory from all his fantasies - kicked in, and he kissed back, hard, hungry, for the most self-indulgent, blissful moment of his life, before he forced his mouth away, catching Harry by the back of his neck to still him, to keep him close but not enough, so they were panting into each other's mouths.
, Draco had been too drunk, too obvious, he remembered the overly sweet, downright worshipping kisses he’d pressed to the hollows of Harry’s hips. But even if Potter was ashamed, he wouldn’t wallow. That wasn’t his style. For all Draco knew, he regretted every moment of it, as one does a regular drunken mistake, one of those painfully embarrassing stories that age into hilarious, if somewhat self-deprecating dinner party anecdotes, and he hadn’t given it another thought.
to lie. Harry had kissed him on the bottom of the stairwell of the Shrieking Shack like he wasn’t a secret but simply a discretion. In such terms, was Draco not allowed to tell the truth? Ron already knew some of it, in any sense - how damnable would it be if Draco filled in some gaps?
‘With Ron,’ Harry cocked his head. A frown settled slowly on his face. ‘Did you not want anyone  to know?’
'Oh, we can certainly last more than them,' Draco smirked against the the shell of Harry's ear, then deliberately thrust up, 'Unless you're too eager, Potter?'
did nothing to me. Merlin, why’d you put that thought into my head?’ Harry laughed. Draco had known the answer - Ginny hadn’t even given him a blowjob, after all, it’d be somewhat strange if she’d played with Harry’s arsehole instead - but he still liked the confirmation. ‘To myself - nothing either.’
Draco drew a small smile and stood so he could place the box gingerly in Harry’s lap. On a fit of bravery - he had been, after all, surrounded by Gryffindors the entire day - he didn’t return to the chair, sitting rather on the edge of the bed. Not quite touching Harry’s body, an inch away from his waist, but close enough that it felt much more intimate. Close enough that he could very well - if he was someone else, probably Leanne, probably Finnigan, who’d call him ‘doll’ so surely - lean down and kiss him.
Harry plunged down, all furious speed, straight towards the midst of the game - Draco’s eyes followed him in surprise, and there, below, trembling by Dean Thomas’s head, was the Golden Snitch.
The casual conversation continued, spread, split over successive drinks. Hog’s Head became fuller and fuller; old, grisly wizards were ogling their tables. When they at last left the pub, the moon hung high. It was about the hour of the night when Draco usually forced himself to leave, when something usually went wrong and he cowered back to Hogwarts with Hogsmeade’s twinkling lights a taunt in the horizon. This night, instead, he walked tall and relaxed besides Harry, no intentions of parting, cherishing each time their entwined fingers swung back and forth between their bodies as they walked down the street.
‘Forget what I said,’ he said, a dismissive sweep of his hand in the air, like the words had meant nothing, like they hadn’t been making him miserable for over a week. Because he didn’t know what he was arguing for, or why he was mad - if it was because he’d been that honest with Harry, because Harry hadn’t heard his confession and immediately kissed him; because Harry had heard it and not even realized what he meant; because Harry had heard it in the first place; because he’d heard it and not even
‘Nevermind Pansy,’ said Blaise, resting a reassuring hand on the low of Rowena’s back. He too wore a suit, tailored so precisely that the fabric hung like liquid from his skin. The burnt orange of his breast square matched Rowena’s long dress. ‘Nerves make her rude.’
work,' Harry said after the brief, blissful silence. He chuckled, an erratic, disbelieving little thing, and his hands finally slipped from Draco's hair to run through his own. 'I don't know if I can walk.'
There was a chorus of half-hearted complaints directed at Seamus, who was smiling unapologetically. Draco, figuring this was as good a chance as any to try and chat to Harry properly, leaned an inch towards him:
As if on cue, as if very simply to scare Draco’s heart right out of him, Harry flashed up in an almost vertical line, scarlet robes unfurling around him like whips, all speed and energy and
And just to tease - because it was impossible not to, when Harry was so pink and wanting and vulnerable before him - he ran his tongue down the vein. Harry shivered with a frustrated sound, flattening his hands against the tiles as if to control himself.
The light flickered again. For one moment, they were plunged in darkness, and the situation felt to Draco then, somehow, much less innocent than before. He couldn’t help picture the most stereotypical activities that were bound to occur between two students in a cramped closet at night; picture himself crowding Harry against the shelves, kissing him, running his fingers through the bare skin of his arms and the dark strands of his hair. Making him moan, because he’d been imaging that sound ever since Pansy, in third year, in a chilly night by the common room’s fireplace, had filled him in on all the graphic details of sex.
‘What?’ Potter was distracted, opening each vial and whiffing the insides to make sure it was indeed veritaserum. Draco found it preposterously unfair that Harry didn’t have to look at him, while he was cursed with the view of his pale, toned arms.
Not that it lasted long. Being hungover did terrible things to decisiveness - love more so, and Draco’s eyes were helpless to orbit towards Harry again and again. He didn’t even seem bothered, laughing with Ron, no doubt sharing one of those ridiculous jokes Draco had always wished to tease him about, movements lazy and head held high, like he hadn’t been incredibly wasted less than six hours ago.
Harry’s face went very pink and his eyes very wide, snapping to the rest of the table as if he was frightened someone else might have heard. Draco had been right - it was incredibly entertaining to watch him squirm, when it was his doing.
‘Potter,’ Draco said, stretching his arm on some reckless impulse to catch Harry’s and pull him closer. ‘We could do it in the owlery for all I care.’
The girls laughed, Draco shuddered, and seemingly with that joke the tension eased. They continued in mild chatter in the outskirts of the group, Draco forcing himself to stare them in the eye and act casual, unperturbed, fucking
It was ordinary Wizard’s brew and it sunk warmly in his throat. He watched Ron out the corner of his eye, half expecting to see some miniature lion or some kind of ethereal mane around him. There was nothing.
of Harry's words: "of course", like he had no objection to calling out Malfoy's name, like he wasn't ashamed or repulsed, that made Draco melt. He never thought he'd get to
- all fiery eyes, reluctant charm, endearing discomfort. See his own hand peek out of the cloak, Harry’s remain a fist by his side. Feel that childish, then incomprehensible tug in his heart… it hadn’t quite been love, but the kind of thing helpless to precede it.
He was almost better, almost back to some semblance of normal, when one night, as he sat, driven by insomnia, reading in the Slytherin common room, he heard a crash coming from the corridor.
, and Draco could never bring himself to change, and it was so much simpler to be rude and watch Harry leave than to be nice and see it all the same.
'Blaise,' Draco sighed, his fingers flexing on Harry's hip. 'You've never been one to ask stupid questions.'
‘Fuck, fuck, Potter, yes, like that- teeth, cover them. There you go,’ Draco was a rush of hushed words, delighting in the warm wetness beyond Harry’s lips - and he twisted his fingers firmly into his hair, decadently keeping him there until he got used to the sensation. When he eased his grip, Harry ventured just a little bit further, slacking his jaw and taking him for a few seconds more before he withdrew.
When Potter had asked him if Draco was suggesting he got better company, Draco could have been brave and said 'yes'. He could have said 'Me'. He could have told Potter - with one single fucking word, no effort at all - that he was equally fit to be his friend; that he'd excell at it, even, because he knew what jokes he liked, and he'd be much more reliable than all those flimsy Gryffindors that could barely stand straight after two drinks, and he wasn't too scared to tell the Chosen One that he wasn't fooling anyone by chewing on the same burnt piece of toast for the entirety of breakfast, and to make him sit down and eat properly for once since he'd fucking gotten to Hogwarts.
Second class was Potions, and they spent half an hour tittering in the cold classroom while Professor Slughorn gave them a lengthy speech - one, in fact, that he made a point of reciting to every year that day.
He ought to leave. Really, that was the smartest thing to do. He wouldn’t be able to look Harry in the eye; he wouldn’t be able to pretend, when he knew there was someone at that table who would be able to see through it. Someone who’d detect the fondness in his eye, the shy warmth in his words, the desperate tendrils of love that were ever apparent in the cracks of his demeanour. How could he ever talk to Harry without remembering the way Hermione had looked at him once she’d realized, like she too knew he was doomed in this love, like she could see the endless suffering destined for him?
‘It’s bloody not,’ he pressed a small black bag against Draco’s chest. ‘Get me the- the gold shit, you’ll know it when you find it.’
‘Sod off, Malfoy,’ Harry snarled. He untangled their arms, tried to step to the side to create some distance between them, but the crowd was too dense, he was too unbalanced, and he ended up still pressed to Draco’s side. It wasn’t the same intimacy from before, however, warm and casual and
He really wasn’t in the disposition for inquiries. His head was cracking, dry like a prune, yet overflowing, overstuffed, bursting with crumpled tissues and old liquor - a very cramped desert, it seemed, loud though there was no sound, and aching for darkness. He wanted to go back to sleep. He wanted Saturday banished by unconsciousness; Sunday, maybe, as well. He could stand on Monday, he was fairly sure. By Tuesday he was positive he’d be able to think.
for it. It didn’t mean Harry would start caring about what he had to say.  His words weren’t enough, but Draco still worried, and it was still dangerous, and he couldn’t just stand by and watch. So let the stubborn fool fly to his death - Draco would come along too.
Like the previous time, Harry took Draco’s dick eagerly, too much too fast like he did any challenge. Just like in any challenge, he thrived that way, working on reckless impulse and sure instinct, covering his teeth as Draco had told him and moving until Draco could feel himself jerk against the back of his throat. Harry made a strangled noise, eyes tearful, and tried to shift, but Draco kept him still by his hair.
‘I was meant to hate you, and I couldn’t. Don’t you think that was even worse? Don’t you think my life would have been much simpler if I had hated you?’
you in a hurry? It’s bloody Saturday,’ Draco said, sharp, impatient, quickly deflating. He ought to be nice to Weasley, Harry would like it. The problem was Ron seemed to have no intentions of being nice to
That's what he thought. That's what he hoped. And Pansy, the vicious minx, didn't bother to correct him - or to give him any single fucking
Harry shuddered, though he tried his best to hide it. In his efforts to stay still, to ground himself at the first touch of the red pigment against his skin, he gripped Draco's elbow, fingers viciously squeezing the curve there, nails digging into the tailored suit, lips parting ever so slightly for him. Beautiful, fragile as he allowed Draco to tilt his head just so, to run an appraising thumb over the lovely arch of his bottom lip before pressing the compact colour beneath it.
It was Finnigan's voice, all drunk and friendly, and Draco had never hated that prick more in his entire life.
'If I did not make his life miserable, and yet I still ogled him as much as I did, how long do you think it would take before the entire school realized what I felt?'
Harry. Oh, Draco wondered how he felt, where he was, what he was thinking. Was he in bed as well? As hungover as Draco? Spread all soft in his bed, head plastered to his pillow, gaze smoothed by sleep and hair matted to his forehead - had he thought about Draco at all? Worried about him? Reviewed the night in his mind? Was he still sleeping, perhaps? If they truly had only returned to Hogwarts by dawn, then Harry would have had hardly any sleep. But the Weasleys were up; did that mean Harry was too? He and his impossibly high tolerance, all stupidly confident, like he could drink and drink and drink and never feel it. Maybe it was true. Maybe he was in the library right now, dressed and breakfasted, studying with Hermione. Maybe he hadn’t given Draco further than a passerby musing.
he’d like sucking cock, knew he’d be the type to see the power in kneeling, knew he’d fight for control even with his mouth full and a drip of drool in the corner of his lips and his hair tightly twisted around Draco’s fingers. He’d
The matter was dropped altogether, despite Draco’s attempts to return to it. By the time they’d finished breakfast, Pansy was quite resolute in speaking only about class, and it was with a victorious smile that she stood at last to go to her Ancient Studies elective. Draco, on his part, hurried down to the greenhouses, his heart quickening with each step.
. How could she be the one Harry was interested in? It was some kind of cosmic joke; it was Gods conspiring to drive Draco crazy, it was the universe’s way of telling him that Harry Potter, in his search for romance, would choose
‘You’re such a bloody child,’ Harry grumbled, trying to look some semblance of cross even despite the ridiculously endearing keening noises that he kept trying to suppress. ‘Let me get on my knees so I can suck you off, you arsehole.’
It wasn’t red currant this time. Sweeter. Sue, who was half laying down, her short hair scattered across the armrest, chortled.
They formed a small wave as they shrugged. Below them, in the pitch, the players were doing half-hearted lunges.
Draco laughed but obliged. His eyes lingered on the patch of come - because Harry had actually been so desperate from blowing him that he’d come in his bloody pants, and Draco still couldn’t quite wrap his mind around it - until Harry tucked himself away and stepped backwards, officially breaking the intimacy.
‘Meet us in the dungeons, at the end of the stairs that lead to the Viaduct Entrance. Midnight on the dot. And wear something formal.’
to him now, and that would be even worse - but it still brought about the most ridiculous urges, like Harry had said he liked him, like he’d been allowed permission to lace an arm around Harry’s shoulders and cover the prickly skin of his upper arms, so he could warm him not with his coat but with his own skin.
‘If you keep paying for everything, you’ll end up begging for change outside of Gringotts,’ he managed, taking some money out of his own pocket with one slow, stunted hand.
'Alright, then,' Harry gave a little wave, wavered a little where he stood, then held onto the railing with one firmly decided expression.
it,’ Draco retorted as he zipped up his own slacks. When he was done he hopped onto the desk, running his fingers absently through the scratched wood. He hated the thought of walking back to the cold common room and slipping into bed alone; hated the thought of parting from Harry so cleanly and abruptly, like these moments where they were together belonged to someone else instead of bleeding seamlessly into his life. On impulse, he found himself wanting to delay the end. ‘Do you reckon it’ll be better or worse to have class here now that this happened?’
‘Who were you with?’ Blaise repeated. His long fingers wrapped tightly around Draco’s knee. Draco huffed.
‘No bloody way you’re joining us,’ Ron scoffed, and he swayed dangerously when he bent down to retrieve the fallen helmet.
‘No. It wouldn’t make any of us feel better. Just make up for it - don’t be a dick,’ Harry huffed, looking up at him with a little wicked smile. ‘What got you thinking about this, anyway?’
'Oh,' Hermione broke into a small chuckle, scratching the side of her head. Behind her, Neville was looking attentively at his drink, 'Good to see you too. You look wonderful, Pansy,' she trailed off, rolled her glass in her hands - butterbeer, because what else would Granger drink? -, then drew a polite smile. 'We'll be sitting over there, then. You two have a pleasant night.'
When, after much fussing - and one long, breathless moment where Draco had felt suddenly overwhelmed by the day’s events and gone to Madam Puddifoot’s for tea -, a present for Harry had finally been sorted, and they were walking through the peaceful streets back to the station, Draco holding tightly onto a box, Pansy with a parcel of mallowsweet, Draco finally had the nerve to say:
them in their strange endeavours, reigning the dark, eery halls with them, and Harry would know he wasn't frigid, cold, detached, and that glimmer of hope he'd felt that night would return.
And he kissed him, hands lifting to his shoulders, using the support to stretch up and properly lean into Draco’s mouth. His lips were warm, and Draco’s mouth tingled still with lingering flames, and the press of their chests reignited in him the hunger he’d been suppressing since the game, when Harry had been sitting so close, so pretty, so
