Blaise showed up surrounded by his usual group of friends – most of whom used to be Draco’s friends, but he hardly even cared anymore. Nott showed up alone. Both of them sent long looks in Draco’s direction; neither of them sat down near him.
the day after the news came out: half of the debate section dedicated to letters from witches and wizards from all over Britain lashing out at the Ministry, not for the lapse in security that had allowed the dementors to be destroyed, but for the fact that it had not happened
Granger looked for a second like she was considering hexing him too, but then she just rolled her eyes at them and slung her bag over her shoulder.
Harry, Draco and Hermione descended through the tower, moving much faster now they didn’t stop to draw runes. They rushed past the cells, down, down, down towards the darkness at the bottom. They didn’t speak. The only sound was of their footsteps and the occasional moans or cries from the cells. Draco heard a strangled noise from Granger behind him and thought she must have looked into a cell, but they didn’t stop.
They both took out their wands and put them down on the table. They did not have anything else with them.
He closed his eyes and tried to empty his head. Instead came the memory of Malfoy talking about the dark mark. That had definitely been a breach of their pattern. He had plunged head first into the mess instead of going around it. It reminded Harry a bit of some of their first talks this year. The ones that had started it all, the ones where all of Malfoy’s façade had cracked with hardly any warning and he had seemed raw and real and an entirely different person beneath.
Harry didn't get to hear the answer to whether or not Draco and Chris were the only full-timers. He was too busy choking on his beer. Someone thumped him on the back as he coughed, trying to get air into his lungs.
Harry watched him. He had his head tilted back, resting against the wall. His eyes were closed. His skin looked even whiter in the dark. Not sickly, the way it did sometimes at the beginning of the year. More like porcelain.
can be helped – that’s practically all they’ve been doing for the last seven years. I’m afraid it has become a habit to all of them.”
“He didn’t care about me and my mother, whether we were there or not,” he said. “He just didn’t want us to take the patronus away.”
He could have told them, Hermione said. What exactly was it she expected him to tell? He had no idea what was going on with him and Draco. It wasn’t like he had to explain it to anyone.
“I can’t. I mean… He got angry about the handholding. At first he didn’t seem to mind, but then suddenly he was all in a twist and was about to leave, so I grabbed him, because I wanted to know what he was angry about, right? And then-”
He looked around and found Hermione still settled on the sofa in the corner. Ron had fallen asleep next to her with his head on her shoulder. She looked tired too, her eyes droopy but still focused on the long roll of parchment that trailed over her knees and the edge of the sofa and all the way to the floor. She was poking her lip with the tip of her quill as she read, sometimes putting it to the parchment and scribbling some addition in the margin, or crossing something out. She had ink stains on her cheek and her hand. He felt suddenly weird that he was watching them. Usually he would have stayed with them, either struggling with his own homework or distracting himself with keeping Ron awake.
“Screw that! He’s the one who let the Death Eater’s into Hogwarts, he’s the reason Dumbledore is dead and the reason Bill’s-“ Ron stops and glances at his brother.
“Harry!” exclaimed Parvati, and Harry started and realized he had accidentally tilted the pitcher, spilling a sea of juice on the table.
When they reached the landing of the fourth floor, Harry stopped dead, staring up at the sight in front of him. It was an elaborate spiderweb, thin strings of patronus light that ran along the walls, across the chasm over the pit and up above them, illuminating the entire inside of Azkaban with calm, ghostly light. Harry craned his neck back, staring up at it, for a moment so overwhelmed he didn’t notice the other change that had occurred – that sound had returned to Azkaban. The oppressive, unnatural lack of acoustics was gone and though the screams had quietened, they could now hear quiet weeping echoing between the walls.
Then Dean and Seamus came in and Ron turned to them instead, and Harry didn’t try to explain the thing with him and Ginny again. They all began talking about something else and Harry got off his bed to go to the bathroom and brush his teeth.
Nobody said anything and in the silence, he watched the red-haired girl across from him. Lovegood was leaning against her and Ginny had put an arm around her and was running her fingers absentmindedly through her hair. She looked both fiery and serene and it was not the first time that Draco had to admit to himself that she was beautiful. The stab of jealousy he felt was familiar too. It was easy to understand why Harry had fallen in love with her. It was easy when looking at her, to see all the ways in which she would have been a better choice.
“I don’t know how the hell you figured it out,” Draco said. “But I’m ignoring it until it goes away and I suggest you do the same. Azkaban is what’s important, I’m not letting this interfere with it, okay?”
“That’s just a family thing, like you and Bill with the Cannons, that doesn’t mean he can’t be objective – and I don’t even know why you’re defending the Crowley decision…”
Harry crossed his arms, mirroring Ron. He was tired and he wanted to sleep, but there was a thought that had been nagging him ever since he got on the tube.
“You think they would have let me into the room of requirement? Really? I didn’t have a choice, Potter.”
“Why do you care?” he snapped at her. “You get top marks on everything whether you do the work or not, and it’s not like
"Yeah," Irie said. She put her arm around Maya like she had done earlier, only there was something very meaningful to the gesture now. "That a problem?"
“I think everyone is doing that. I swear I’ve never seen this many parents and siblings on the platform.”
Malfoy opened his eyes and looked at him with a smirk like he had guessed exactly what was going on in Harry’s mind.
Draco pushed open the door to his dormitory and found that in his absence, his bedroom had been invaded by half of Slytherin house. Matthew, Nott, Blaise and Daphne were gathered by Blaise’s bed; Pansy, Millicent and Tracey were spread out on Draco’s fourposter, lounging on it as if they owned it.
Harry glanced down at his watch. It had been hardly twenty minutes. He wasn't sure if it would be rude to leave already, but if Malfoy had said what he wanted to say-
“I just wanted to say that I’ve thought a lot about what you said the other day,” she said. “About me not going Azkaban.”
“I went back to get my book and he came out of the classroom right when I got there and,” Harry shrugged. “I don’t know. Things got out of hand.”
Both Dean and Seamus collapsed into laughter. Dean let himself fall onto the bed. Neville had stood up and was headed for the bathroom. He pulled the curtain on Seamus’ bed shut as he passed it.
Malfoy kept talking, though. Asking if they could meet at eight. Harry said eight was fine. And Malfoy thanked him and hung up. Harry put the phone back. He leaned back in the sofa and stared ahead of him at the dark and empty living room of Grimmauld Place, where ancient wizards were asleep in their paintings, an empty owl-cage stood open by the window, a couple of Ron’s crates from the jokeshop hummed ominously in the corner and the carvings on the furniture blinked at Harry with curious, wooden eyes.
As soon as he was outside, he turned down the street outside and started walking. He wasn't sure where he was going.
“I left the same time as Ginny and we met Ron in the common room, so they’re on their way. They should be here in a couple of minutes,” said Hermione.
“But it’s not just what he did during the war! We hated him before that. You know, before he was letting Death Eaters into the school or trying to assassinate Dumbledore, when he was carefree and unmarked and could spend his time calling Hermione a you-know-what and making fun of my family and trying to convince everyone you were barmy.”
“Well that doesn’t necessarily mean-“ Tracey began, but then Nott interrupted her, speaking up for the first time since Draco came in.
Draco picked them up before Potter could hurt himself by attempting such a risky manoeuvre on his own.
There was a moment of silence. Harry listened for Ron and Hermione's voices. He couldn't hear them anymore.
Harry stared down at his still half full plate, but his stomach had twisted into tight knots and he was pretty sure he wouldn't be able to eat any more of it if he tried.
Malfoy grinned, and Harry noticed how strange the expression was on him when it wasn’t tinged with condescension or malice. Usually everything about Malfoy was sharp, tight and proper – his face was a controlled mask of calculated emotions, his robes looked like they had been spelled clean and creaseless, and there was never a single hair on his head that was out of place. That Malfoy was hardly even a person, but simply the spoiled and well-tended product of an overprivileged upbringing. But when they walked together up the stairs to the oak doors of the castle, his robes had been ruffled by the wind and his collar was unbuttoned, which was enough to make him look dishevelled. His hair was damp and windswept, his cheeks flushed from the cold air, and he seemed very real. He became approachable, became something you could touch without cutting yourself. And watching him made Harry feel unbalanced, like he was about to trip, and he wouldn’t be able to break the fall.
He didn't want to go into that - he still felt dirtied somehow for getting off the hook that easily. He wasn't about to arm Malfoy with the fact that he had also been let off the hook for bank robbery.
Draco had the nauseating sensation of being able to feel his own brain contracting like a muscle as he heaved his occlumency barriers into place, and then he was alone in his head. The memories of the ancient wizard were gone and he was looking at the tip of a wand pointed between his eyes, and behind it, Hermione Granger. Then he buckled over and coughed out a mouthful of vomit. He had been throwing up in his mouth, he could feel how it had drippled down his chin.
He moved his wand, their shadows jumped and twisted over the walls. There was an unpleasant crunch from the lock.
He could actually smell himself. The sour scent of sweat and beer clung to his clothes and his sheets and felt like a grimy film on his skin.
He pulled the wand out of his pocket. He had ended up spending half the night looking for it and had finally found it stowed away with some of his old Hogwarts stuff. It had been greasy with fingermarks and dusty too, so he'd polished it and wrapped it in a cloth before going to see Malfoy. Now he kind of wished that he hadn't. It looked too nice, like it was some sort of gesture. He watched Malfoy fold back the cloth and gingerly take the wand.
“I understand that you want to acknowledge his redeeming qualities, but why do you have to turn him into a
Malfoy’s hand is curled tight in Harry’s sweater; he stays leaning against him as he catches his breath. One of Harry’s hands is sticky and hangs limply at his side. He has the other one resting on Malfoy’s back, steadying him. He moves his thumb in small, soothing circles. They never did this either. There was never anything soft about the thing they had, and Harry feels his chest tightening, because it’s over now and he should feel the regret and awfulness creeping in, but it’s nice to have someone holding him and to hold on to them, it’s really nice, even if it’s Malfoy. He knows any second now, Malfoy will push him away and leave so he tries to take as much of it in as he can; the feel of Draco’s robes under his fingers, the flowery scent of Draco’s shampoo, and his own smell underneath that, the heated brush of his exhalations on Harry’s skin.
And they don’t talk about it. They talk about the wedding and about Harry’s birthday, and take turns to retreat and read the somber news in the Prophet. There is hardly anything useful in it anymore, but everyone still finds time to scour the censored articles for any information about which families have disappeared, who has gone underground, who has been taken. Lupin puts down the newspaper and Mr Weasley picks it up. Harry notices the way hushed conversations stop when he enters a room and it seems so stupid and pointless that they are still trying to shield him. He’s the one who will be going after the horcruxes, the one who will eventually have to kill Voldemort, so what is the point in not talking about it?
“It was just, after seeing the two of you in Azkaban, I thought there might be a bit more to it – that maybe you, you know, liked him as well?”
He pushed open the door at the very top of the tower and stepped out into the sunshine. It was quite different up there in the daytime, the view of the grounds a watery endlessness of toned down colours this time of year, when the grass below was muddy, the sky pale and the Forbidden Forest mostly black and leafless. Draco stood up when he saw him, the wind grabbing hold of his robes and tossing his hair across his face.
"Sorry. I was trying to get the frying pan out of the cupboard when the toast caught fire. Everything just sort of crashed to the floor.”
Pansy cast nervous glances back up at the castle when they passed over the grounds. All the windows were dark, and even if someone had been looking out, Draco doubted they would have noticed the tiny dark figures making their way towards the gates.
“Well, no worries, then. Looks like there’s absolutely nothing in the way of you becoming Potter’s new best friend and being forgiven by the wizarding world, showing me and Blaise and all the others exactly how wrong we were to count you out.”
For a second Ron looked like he was the one who had been punched, and Harry felt immediately bad for saying it. Then Ron shrugged.
“My mother is doing very well now, so I wanted to spend some more time with her before I came back.”
“Well, runes can be used for channelling spells,” said Granger, standing up. “It’s much easier than altering the spell itself, and runes of protection would probably be compatible with the patronus charm, so
Draco smiled and watched his patronus as the snake coiled in the air. It was beautiful. Looking at it made him feel slightly dizzy, though. He recalled the way it had snapped in the darkness of Azkaban. And hadn’t there been a moment where he stopped recasting it? Draco blinked as a sudden memory washed over him of dementors crowding close around him, Harry screaming his name before he disappeared from view, that moment of total darkness and complete cold – Draco’s hand was shaking slightly. He was still watching his patronus, he was still in the commonroom, but he didn’t like the way the shadows in there seemed to be getting taller, looming – he had wanted to die in the pit. He had looked at the dementors and felt nothing but fear and sadness and he had wanted to die. And then the doe had appeared. Harry’s patronus. Harry’s
“That’s not what this is about! I don’t give a fuck that you have a boyfriend or a fuckbuddy or whatever he is to you, I just wish you weren’t leaving me behind to keep him. I can’t stop you, of course, but you can’t expect me to just ignore it either.”
She let her hand fall and was rested her arms on her knees. She was looking past him again, at the windows behind him instead of at him.
There was a bit of shifting around before they were both comfortable. There was the push of Potters knees and the feeling of their legs trailing along each other, the heat of Potter’s breath on the back of his neck and their bodies fitting jigsaw-like into each other. There was the weight of Potters arm draped across his chest and the tickle of each exhalation moving Draco’s hair on the back of his neck.
“I really hope your brooding silence doesn’t mean you’re making a quiet resolution to prove me wrong.”
Draco wasn’t sure how he felt about his first intentional meeting with Potter. Objectively speaking, it had gone well. He had succeeded in making Potter give him a second chance, whatever that meant, and they had then had a somewhat enjoyable conversation. At least it had been interesting. It would still require a lot of work if he was to gain Potter’s friendship and access any of the benefits that would come with it, but he thought he had significantly increased the chances of success for his admittedly rather desperate plan. So he ought to have been pleased with himself, and instead he felt very much like he had torn out his last shred of integrity and dignity and dragged it through the mud. Some part of him was screaming for him to abandon the plan, that he couldn’t possibly go through with this and should just go back to regaining favour with Slytherin House or give up on his ambitions altogether. It seemed to be screaming with Pansy’s voice too, which might have been why he snapped at her during dinner, when she asked him what it was he kept staring at.
"It's too cruel," she sighed. "You have to wear all those ugly, ill-fitting things when you are able to look
“They might have met over the summer and we could go sit with them, but I want to be sure they’ve had time to work out the new hierarchy between them before I try to fit myself in. Keep the tension low.”
Draco stood up to follow Potter’s friends out. He was still shocked over Pansy’s sudden outburst. He had no idea what she would be like when he talked to her later. Would she be mad at him for bringing her? But he couldn’t have known the Weasley girl would be there.
for them to return to the way things had been before. He'd watched her steadily and steadfastly beginning to reassemble their life, rebuilding their reputation and washing her hands of the last few years of loss and tragedy and humiliation. She'd reached out to the friends they still had left, extending and expecting sympathy. He had no idea what version of the story she'd presented them with, but he was sure it was very compelling. It wouldn't be long before she found some sympathetic journalist willing to hear her story too, and then the networking would turn into even more of a public performance, and even that would just be the beginning. As soon as they got their money back there was sure to be charity balls and generous donations and posturing for the press, and so Draco had resolved to get out of there before any of that happened.
It was such an absurd idea. Sure, Potter didn't know either of them at all, and he was dense as a bridge troll, but how could he possibly be that far off?
“I really don’t think he is. I think you’re bored and you’re trying to make up problems where there aren’t any.”
Malfoy closed his eyes, like he was taking a moment to steady himself. Or maybe to show his exasperation with Harry’s stupidity that he had taken what happened so seriously. It was impossible to tell sometimes. Harry was aware of his heart pounding away hard in his chest. Malfoy’s hesitation was excruciating, he had to fight to keep himself from just blurting out everything that went through his head and wait for an answer.
“I know. And as soon as I manage to escape she’ll be demanding grandchildren. Did you see how she was acting around Fleur?”
None of the Gryffindor boys had started packing until the last evening, so after the feast their dormitory dissolved into accusations of uniform theft, attempts at bribing each other to face Madam Pince and turn in the overdue library books that had turned up in the strangest places, yelling about summer plans and promises of writing each other and keeping in touch. They didn’t get much sleep.
"No, Potter, I have not. I haven't even set foot in Diagon Alley in half a year. I'll be dead before I go within fifty miles of that castle again."
“They should at least give us the right ingredients,” said Ron as he and Harry stood up. “It isn’t fair if it’s
His voice came out an off-pitch croak. Potter's eyes snapped back to Draco's face. He dropped his hand.
“Of course they have! We’ve been working with him and Pansy for months, we’ve talked to them, he was with us in the pit.“
He startled visibly – he had been lost in thought and hadn’t noticed the professor coming in. She looked up from the parchment when he didn’t answer.
“That’s interesting. Maybe it’s broken. After Longbottom you’re probably the least Slytherin student in all of Hogwarts.”
Harry wakes on his seventeenth birthday with a tight feeling in his gut and a sense of looming disaster. It’s a familiar feeling, so similar to the constant restless fear of the vague threat of the mission ahead of them. Except this morning the general anxiety is accompanied by vein-crushing shame that makes it impossible for him to even look at Ron or anyone else offering congratulations.
He mumbled an incantation, pointing the wand into the air above them. The rain was getting heavier around them, the path already turning muddy, but Harry no longer felt the cold drops on his face.
For one day, the stunt the Gryffindors had pulled at breakfast was all over the school. The theories for why it had happened quickly spun out of control. A few of them even included the detail that Draco Malfoy had learned the patronus charm, a piece of information that received intense scrutiny and debate, especially from former members of Dumbledore’s Army. For one day, Draco, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were dodging questions and deflecting attention, corroborating Draco’s story when necessary, defending the decision when challenged. And then the
“That’s probably the first thing we should figure out,” said Weasley to the room in general. “I mean, I suppose tearing down Azkaban is illegal, so we don’t want the wrong people to find out what we’re planning.”
“No, I guess not. But of course it’s different. You’ve heard what it was like with Snape and the Carrows. Sometimes I feel terrible that we weren’t even here – I know it wouldn’t have changed anything, but still. It really worries me that they haven’t hired a psychiatrist, but apparently wizards aren’t big on therapy. I think the professors are just trying really hard to get everything back to normal as smoothly as possible, but even they must have some trauma they need to work through. I’m going to talk to McGonagall about it. I mean, many of the kids have been
“Fine, she takes it back, whatever. Piss off,” said a skinny boy, who seemed to have finally found his voice.
“Sure. Fine,” he said and decided not to mention that apart from giving the Slytherin students a private place to talk, Aberforth had also been smuggling food for the DA through his inn. Or that he was Dumbledore’s brother, which Malfoy didn’t seem to be aware of either.
“I reckon we should just do it without the Slytherins. Seems the simplest solution, doesn’t it?” said Ron.
He missed having Pansy nearby. It wasn't like he didn't understand her frustration with him and he wished he could explain it properly to her. But he had tried and it always ended up with one of them angry or hurt or both. When he spoke with her this rarely, it wasn't worth it to have it end in a fight every time.
“I’m not saying we give up; I’m saying we might have to think of another solution – the others are waiting for us, if we’re not back at the castle by morning-“
Draco eyed him warily for any sign of humour, listened for a note of contempt. Harry wasn’t looking at him when he said it. Draco thought he might be blushing, but it was hard to tell when he had his face turned to the floor. He was standing too close again. If he looked up, his face would be right in front of Draco’s. When had Draco gotten taller than him? He didn’t even know. He used to care about that a lot. He used to set it up so he and Potter were competing about everything, and he would keep score in his mind, so the summer when they came back and Potter seemed to have grown twenty inches and Draco had only grown a few, Draco was behind, but then he got better grades in every single class and was ahead for a while, and then Potter saved the world, and Draco lost. Draco always lost in the end.
“Well, actually there is no rule that you have to sit at your house table,” said Granger in a polite voice she probably hadn’t meant to be condescending.
“I think they’re trying to distance themselves from their parents. I mean, I think the Slytherins are by far the most serious students in my mugglestudies class,” said Hermione.
He took her arm again and they turned to the steps. They ascended in silence, but he knew they were all thinking the same thing: It had worked.
And then there was Ron. It felt right that he had finally talked to him about Malfoy and he was glad that they hadn’t had a row about it. He knew Ron and Hermione weren’t being unreasonable, but he was starting to think that maybe he wasn’t either. It only made sense that things would be different now, after the war. All the other houses had become closer; Slytherin was the only one that was really cut off. And of course that made sense after the role they had played, it was hard for everyone to forgive them, but Harry was pretty much on his way to forgiving Malfoy, wasn’t he? And Malfoy had been the worst of them.
The four broomsticks skimmed low over the water. There were the thuds of their shoes on the rocks of the barren island when they landed. No one said a word as Draco led them to the stairs. He felt terribly exposed when they made their way across the island; there was nothing but the darkness giving them cover, and though he was grateful for the moonlight it also meant that anyone looking out would have easily spotted them. But there were no cries of spells from above and soon his hand closed around the slick, cold railing of the stairs. He turned to look back at them.
“Right, sorry,” Draco said, but smiling a little because Potter was too. “But I’m serious. It’s obvious that they’re not doing anything they don’t want to because of you. I mean, Pansy isn’t exactly the brave sort and I actually felt bad about asking her to come too, but I shouldn’t have, I should have trusted that she’d pull out when she wanted to, and she did. I’m really glad that your friends still want to help, but I think you can trust that they’ll tell you if there’s something they don’t want to do. If it ends up being just me going to Azkaban, then that’s fine.”
Blaise laughed. Draco wasn't sure if he had heard her or if it was just from the expression on Draco's face. Pansy could be terribly intimidating when she wanted to. Sometimes he wished he had stuck with more compliant friends. He pushed back his chair and stood up.
The phone was on the floor, halfway behind one of the couches - a result of a long and tedious process of figuring out a way to squeeze muggle technology into a house as soaked with magic as Grimmauld Place. Harry took a deep breath before reaching down to pick up the receiver.
Draco almost laughed. It was so typical of Potter to feel entitled to stick his nose in other people’s private business. Not that it would stay Draco’s private business for long - he knew what Blaise and Tracey were like; the whole school would probably know about it before lunch the next day.
Then Potter’s free hand reached up and curled around the nape of Draco’s neck. Draco closed his eyes and Potter pushed his fingers up into his hair and pulled him closer. He kissed him, and everything in Draco’s mind went numb.
The staircase in the west wing was the least used way of getting to the lower levels of the castle, so it was unlikely they would be spotted. Still, Draco couldn’t see the point of meeting there instead of in the secret room as they had every other time.
“I’m sorry I walked in on you,” she said. “I’m not going to tell anyone if that’s what you’re worried about. There. We’re done talking.”
“Right – yes, of course you can. But you’ll need to get permission from Madam Pince, and she’ll be watching you like a hawk while you’re in there and she won’t let you take out more than two, maybe three books, if you’re lucky.”
Malfoy stood up as well as he could with the table and chairs being crammed so tightly in the corner.
Harry looked up to see Malfoy entering the Great Hall. He was alone again. He made for the Slytherin table but then, before he reached it, he glanced toward the Gryffindors and his eyes found Harry’s, and for a fraction of a second they held each other’s gaze, and Harry’s heart surged.
“Sorry,” she said, running a hand through her hair. “I had a bad night. I didn’t mean to be snarky.”
"What?" Irie said looking at her with her eyebrows raised in what was, even to Harry, a very unconvincing mask of innocence.
Harry hesitated. He was cold. They had been walking for a long time. He could probably head home now, if he wanted to.
Harry stepped closer, because there was something flighty about Malfoy’s manner now, like he might turn and run any second. And it wasn’t like he would try to hold him back if he did, he just wanted to… be within reach. He opened his mouth to speak, but lost the words before he could say them. He breathed out heavily, felt his pulse hammer out another second.
“Let’s just give it a few more minutes,” said Ginny, interrupting them. “Then we’ll figure out what to do if he’s still not here.”
There was an uncomfortable stretch of silence. Draco didn’t know what to say and he didn’t know what Potter wanted from him or why he was suddenly so interested. Draco hadn’t actually saved him, he had just refrained from killing him.
But Dumbledore wouldn’t have offered protection he couldn’t give. He had planned to die that night, so someone else must have known, some people had to have been put into place, strings ready to be pulled. It might have been Snape, it might have been McGonagall. It doesn’t really matter how they do it, the important part is that the Order comes for Draco and his mother. They’re only at the Manor for a couple of days, then they are spirited away, disappearing underground, and both sides have other concerns at the time; the search for them is half-hearted at best.
believe it? What do you think would happen if I went up to one of your Weasleys and told them how sorry I am? Do you honestly believe they would just forget about everything and tell me that it wasn’t my fault and at least I apologized and their brother probably doesn’t mind being dead anyway? Because I don’t see that happening, I really don’t. Apologizing for it won’t change
“No, seriously. You’ll get caught and you’ll be put in a cell next to your father and your mother will completely lose it.”
“I’m coming. I have as much first-hand experience with dark magic as the two of you. You might need me.”
"I mean, in the beginning I was so nervous about cocking it up," Malfoy said, ignoring him. "But it turns out a muggle's natural conclusion to someone saying strange things
Ginny turned to look at Pansy Parkinson, who had been sitting quietly next to Malfoy during the whole thing looking bored and like it was beneath her to care. Now everyone in the room was staring at her.
Lovegood was curled up on the sofa, still reading the book. Draco and Granger were repeating things they already knew at each other, both waiting for someone else to have a good idea.
“No, you’re right,” said Draco bitterly. “I should have been able to. Like you said, it was just a boggart. And I stood there like a bloody Hufflepuff, I didn’t even-“
“That’s what your mother told me, but I was wondering if perhaps something else might have happened while you were at home?”
He had been hoping to find the dorm empty, but Seamus was up there. Harry tensed when he saw him. Seamus didn’t seem to notice.
Sometimes he wondered if she was actually this weird or if she just enjoyed making people uncomfortable.
“Yes," Malfoy said, taking another deep drag of his cigarette. "You know, I think I liked corruption better back when it was mostly about giving my family special privileges.”
The first breakthrough was his patronus. His evening practices with Potter had turned into a pretty pleasant way of spending time, despite his continuous failure to grasp the spell. They would take breaks and just talk for a bit about different things that were mostly unrelated to the mission and the war, and it was nice. Potter became better at picking up on his sarcasm. Draco became better at not overthinking everything, at allowing his guard down. He supposed it was a good thing. And anyway, he could tell it bothered Potter when he tried to keep him at arm’s distance, and so he didn’t, even though he knew he should.
“I actually have a theory that you being an only child played a big part in turning you into such a prat,” he said.
There was no shove, just a long stretched second roaring with the silence of Potter not asking and Draco not explaining.
And there it was again – pity. Draco felt anger curling up inside him again, sharp and acidic, like vomit rising in his throat.
to retrieve his clothes and later to summon things at breakfast when Ron insists no one is allowed to pass him anything. It does feel great to finally be allowed to use magic again.
He sat up slowly and reached out to draw back the curtains. He welcomed the uncomfortable brush of cold air as he slipped out of the covers. A bit of moonlight fell through the windows and he could see the dark outlines of the other four poster beds as he made his way to the bathroom.
Ron doesn’t notice Harry’s moment of dumb horror, instead rambling excitedly about how brilliant it is, and Harry nods and flips through it, and then it actually is funny, especially when he notices how some of the headlines correlate eerily with Ron’s oddly changed behaviour around Hermione.
Draco didn’t look at the Gryffindor table again, but he had a prickling sense of being watched. He was relieved to get out of there when he and Pansy left after the pudding. He had just relaxed enough to laugh at one of Pansy’s jokes when Granger caught up with them.
They were speaking in low voices, whispering to each other even though there was no one to hear them. Draco pulled his own watch out of his pocket. Arguing was wasting their time as well.
They both had their hands on the table, holding on to the edge. Draco was very aware of that one inch of space between their fingers. Potter shifted next to him.
, and he could feel him breathing, could feel his hair tickling his neck when Potter leaned against him and he felt like the worst, most disgusting creep to ever be born. Sure, Potter had kissed him, but that had just been… well, Potter was too drunk to
Harry spends the year stalking Draco. He tells himself that this obsession is just about Draco being a Death Eater. It's not like he didn't know Draco was evil last year, he was just fifteen and angry back then. It was a way of acting out. He’s falling in love with Ginny, and despite her being Ron’s sister and everything that’s complicated about that, he can’t help but relish how easy and good and right it feels. There were times the year before when he thought he might be completely fucked up, that he had to be damaged, disturbed, wrong when he could like Cho and know she liked him back and still hook up with Malfoy between classes. That fear can be safely dismissed now – he’s in love with Ginny, he’s doing everything he can to discover what Malfoy is up to, and to stop him from it.
“What?” he said, feeling a chill spreading through him, and suddenly there was a thousand miles between them.
as they so stupidly called themselves. Once again, Harry puts his friends in danger, and this time an entirely unnecessary one, this time it is entirely due to his own stupidity. Sirius is killed by Bellatrix Lestrange. Lucius Malfoy is sent to Azkaban.
And the worst part, the absolute worst of it, was that the whole thing was like some twisted take on fifteen-year-old Draco's fantasies. He was pretty sure he had dreamt up this exact scenario at one point or another - running into Potter at a pub, Potter realizing he wanted him, kissing him, taking him home. Et cetera. Which just made it all worse, made it so much more humiliating.
for Christmas (and had also bought one for herself, which Harry thought was a bit excessive, considering the three of them lived together). It had later turned out almost all of their friends had been given the same book, and when confronted with this Hermione had shrugged and explained how she had realized that one of the fundamental reasons for the enslavement of house elves was that adult witches and wizards were completely helpless when it came to taking care of themselves and that this was really at the root of the problem, and also “the kind of thing you can't get at through legislation”. Ron had pretended to be horrified and asked her if she seriously thought they had been conspiring to acquire a house elf behind her back. But the book had turned out to be quite useful, and having several copies wasn’t entirely pointless either, as the books lived rough lives and didn’t survive long. Harry’s copy had long ago succumbed to a botched dishwashing spell and Ron’s, though still readable, had been burned quite badly.
Harry glared at her. Just then, he was pretty sure he would prefer going back to Azkaban and taking on every single auror the Ministry was sending over there, rather than have this conversation.
“Don’t look so worried,” said Draco. “You heard him, he trusts me, so do as you’re told and run along now, will you?”
He couldn’t even tell how many dementors were between him and Draco now; his patronus was doing nothing to push them away, it stayed by him and Hermione but Harry could feel his own mind starting to slip; for a second his vision was swallowed by the memory of a bright, green light. He shook his head violently and the dementors swam back into view. Harry aimed his wand at them, his mind empty except for the knowledge that he wasn’t going to lose him, that he was going to get all of them home safely.
“Oh, I am aware that Mr Malfoy has played a significant part as well,” said McGonagall with a knowing smile that reminded Harry so much of Dumbledore he had to wonder if it was something that was passed down from headmaster to headmaster along with the office, or if it was simply a requirement for getting the job in the first place.
Potter leaned in - for a second Draco thought he had just stumbled again. Then he realized that he hadn't, and it was too late to do anything about it. And Potter kissed him. Draco froze. Potter's fingers were tight around his arm, his lips were slow and soft. There was no air in Draco's lungs. His brain had died. He was having several heart attacks at once.
Nott snapped his fingers in front of Draco’s eyes because he was that brand of arsehole. Draco shot him a look.
. Neither the good nor the bad. And Harry liked them, he liked them a lot - Irie even reminded him a bit of Ginny - but suddenly he felt a thousand miles away from them. Even the pleasant fogginess the beer had left in his brain, which usually made him feel less distant, didn't help much.  It was like her laugh had put an ocean between them, between him and everyone else at the table. It was a lonely feeling. It made him wish Malfoy hadn't left. Even if everything was strange and awkward and awful between them, at least Malfoy
He straightened up and looked towards the staircase at the end of the hallway with the expression of a man facing Azkaban.
Then Draco felt the brush of Potter’s hand against his own. Warm fingers closed around his wrist and loosened Draco’s grip on the edge of the table. Draco’s heart convulsed violently. Potter’s fingers slid into place between his own, holding his hand in a determined grip. His palm was soft. His fingers twitched a little and Draco had to force down a panicked laugh.
“That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard,” Draco says flatly. “I’m sorry to break it to you, Potter, but ever since the redheads adopted you as one of their own, I’m pretty sure they’ve all become targets, whether you’re sleeping with them or not.“
And Maya, like the gracious and lovely person she was, answered like this was still a perfectly normal conversation and not an awkward train wreck of nonsense.
“Firewhisky. It’s cheap and terrible; I had to buy it off one of the sixth years. If I’d been able to get a bottle from home or at least go into Hogsmeade or something – but of course we’re not drinking for the taste, so just swallow it fast. And I’m already not quite sober, so don’t hold back.”
Draco and Narcissa went back to the manor. By then it was well into the afternoon and they hadn’t had any lunch, but neither of them was hungry, so they sat down in the drawing room and had the house elves bring tea up there instead.
“Not a lot. I’ve only just started reading,” she said. “I left the restricted section to you, but you took a while to get here, so I’ve been through the rest of the library – I figured it was better to get a broader sense of what was there before we started reading in detail.”
“I had an idea,” said Potter, and Draco couldn’t quite decide if he sounded nervous or excited. “Something Lupin did when he taught me how to cast a patronus.”
“How come you’re not on the quidditch team this year?” asked Harry, breaking a long stretch of silence.
“It’ll be fine,” she said, her voice rough and unconvincing. “I need Madam Pomfrey, but I’ll be fine.”
She stepped back out the door and closed it behind her. There was a fraction of a second where he thought of rushing after her, but if he left now, Harry might…
“Right, I meant apart from that. You’re sure you don’t want us to help out a bit with that? I know Luna is helping you, but the rest of us have time too…?”
Ginny crossed her arms. She was taller than Parkinson. She was using that height difference, looking down at her like she was something disgusting. Parkinson’s knuckles were white.
Potter laughed and Draco could feel every muscle involved in it, how his chest convulsed and his arm tightened around him and the blow of warm air that moved his hair.
And Draco was about to say something else when he stopped himself, because Potter was smiling at him, and that wasn’t supposed to make him feel fluttery at all. For a moment he was at a loss for words as a gaping hole of dread opened in his stomach. Because that couldn’t be it. That wasn’t right. Then he gathered himself, forced out words, hoping that Potter hadn’t noticed his hesitation.
“I don’t know if it’s ever been done. The patronus charm just drives them away, and that’s the only dementor-counter curse I know of. I suppose we’ll have to research that too.”
He turned and watched her pick up a pair of scissors, examine it closely and then put it down only to pick up another pair that seemed identical to the first.
"Yeah. I was supposed to give it to him after the trials, but there wasn’t really a chance, so I just sort of forgot."
of mind-numbingly tedious Potter speculations from you, and now that something interesting has actually happened, you don't want to share it? I
It’s strange living under the same roof as Ginny after they have broken up, strange to be that close to her and still miss her. They don’t spend a lot of time together and when they do, the others are always around too. They don’t talk about it, even if it’s always there in the air between them, but now and then he’ll look at her and see that look in her eyes she had at Dumbledore’s funeral, when he told her. That hard blaze of determination, all that will and power to keep moving and be strong and practical and brave. He knows she’s sad. He is too, about all the time they could have had under different circumstances, and now they can’t. But she isn’t angry. She understands. He will never stop being grateful for that.
"Honestly, when it comes to Potter's reasons for not thinking well of you, I think your poor taste in pubs ranks quite low."
It was impossible to tell who won the race and the wind was rushing too loudly past their ears for either boy to hear the other’s cry of victory. Harry slowed down and dipped closer to the trees. A few of the highest branches brushed his feet. Malfoy flew to his side but kept just a few inches higher.
“The feast,” repeated Potter. “Just, there’s been a lot of… people are excited about Halloween in Gryffindor, so I just asked if, yeah, nothing.”
“It doesn’t have anything to do with narrative! I just want to do something right for once, something I don’t have to be ashamed of and I want to be happy without apologizing for it. He likes me. He actually likes me and that’s hard for me to believe too, but I want to hold on to that for as long as I possibly can!”
The two girls were duelling like it was the final battle of the war. Lovegood and Granger had stepped back and stood uncertainly on the edges of the fight, their wands down. Pansy and Ginny whirled around each other, their cloaks whipped about by the superfluous energy from missing spells, shield spells were cast with furious cries and there was determined anger on both their faces.
“Fifteen points from both of your houses. Duelling in a potions classroom, are you absolutely mad? I will see you both back here this evening for detention. And clean that mess up. You can pick up your wands after class.”
“I hope you’re right. Just seems like it’s a bit much on her, all the work she’s doing to figure out what to do about the dementors on top of all the classes she’s taking. Half the time I’m with her she’s reading, and she keeps disappearing up to the room.”
Professor McGonagall sighed. Her expression of sternness relaxed, becoming almost mild. She looked tired too, he thought. And old.
Malfoy laughed. He had that dishevelled air about him again. As soon as they had stopped talking about Azkaban he had relaxed. It was easier to like him like this.
He turned to walk back up the street they had come and unwound his scarf as he went. He turned to check the others had disappeared behind him before he wrapped the scarf around his head so it covered most of his face. So far there had been enough for the
Draco Malfoy stood just to the right of the iron archway over the entrance from King’s Cross. He was watching the scene with an uncomfortable sense of having stepped into an old memory. Being back at the station for the beginning of a new school year felt more like sinking into a Pensieve than a real experience. It was like watching the past unfold before him in real time; he was a visitor displaced from a different point in history. Except, of course, that he didn’t feel invisible or anything even close to it. Draco was acutely aware of his own spine, of his hands and how he had nothing useful to do with them. His robes were impeccable, he had spent thirty minutes spelling them creaseless that morning, but he still had to stop himself from running his hands over the fabric to straighten it out. He knew he was only imagining the itch on his left arm, but that didn’t make it any easier to keep himself from scratching it. He hadn’t been around this many people since the end of term and now it felt like his senses and his brain were being assaulted by too many impressions to take in. He had been holed up by himself in his room in the manor between and after the trials, trying to pull himself back together, trying not to think about what he would do with himself now that it was all over. Then he had received the letter that called them all back to retake their seventh year. His first reaction had been relief over getting one more year before he had to make any real decisions. Then he had realized what it meant – that it wasn’t just him; the rest of his year would be returning with him. He didn’t look forward to seeing any of them again.
“I mean, I’ve always had help,” Harry continued. “Ron and Hermione, Dumbledore’s Army, the Order – and we’ve been lucky. You said it yourself, I almost got myself killed all those times, and I might just as well have died, it wasn’t because I’m some great wizard that I didn’t, it was just…”
They passed through the gates. Harry had his hands stuffed deep in his pockets, his shoulders drawn up like he was freezing.
. And Draco couldn’t gather his mind to think of something to say. His thoughts were all jammed with the awareness that he couldn’t turn to look at Harry to see what his face was like, and that this would probably be the end of it and how they could have locked the door if they had just stopped to think for half a second.
Malfoy picked up a handful of the dried, purple flowerheads, which was apparently the last ingredient he was missing.
“It is for me,” she repeated quietly. “It won’t go away. It’s just there, all the time. Everything I do and think and worry about. I’m still scared. I’m still going over all the details in my head. I keep making up ways we could have saved people if we‘d done something different, and I hate that. I wish I could stop doing that.”
“And how would we even have time for a duelling club?” added Ron. “We have practice twice a week, and classes and homework as well.”
“It’s fine, I don’t mind talking about it. I just don’t like when people think they’re entitled to my private life just because they’ve already read about it in a magazine. Just because the journalists don’t give a shit about my privacy doesn’t mean it’s a fucking free for all, but… yeah, whatever, it’s fine.”
The entire group broke out laughing again, even the ones who had been pressing their hands over their mouths before, trying to hide their giggles.
His palms were sweating. He could feel panic edging in on him. It was a nice offer, a chance to back out before he could fail. But it was too late now. Potter nodded and turned to the wardrobe again.
Draco immediately averted his eyes – Merlin, what was wrong with him? He hadn’t dragged Potter out of his bed and all the way to the other end of the castle just so he could leer at him.
“So that’s a yes - you think that will work on the dementors?” he asked again, not because she hadn’t been clear but just because – well, this didn’t feel at all like the breakthrough they had been waiting for.
“I don’t know what made you think we would want to cooperate with Slytherins about anything,” she said, “but anyone who was able to laugh after one of those classes-“
he could just have asked his friend to step down, but Blaise didn’t listen to him anymore and definitely wouldn’t take orders. So Draco kept his mouth shut and watched.
He really was a prick. He hated listening to himself being a prick, but at this point, Potter was practically
It was an opening like the ones of the cells upstairs, except it looked much deeper. Harry waved his patronus forward and the stag walked a few hesitant steps into the darkness.
“Yes, I heard you the first seven times, Draco. But what’s happening next? I mean, today didn’t exactly go well-“
“We should sleep too,” said Harry, but he was too tired to even think of getting up or walking all the way to Ron’s room.
“No, we don’t know if any of last year’s members still have theirs. We’ll make new ones, find a way to get them to the Slytherins.”
She had warm brown skin and a shrewd look in her eyes. Her long hair was gathered in twisty braids, that maybe weren't actually braids. They looked complicated.
Potter let out a breathy huff of a laugh and Draco's heart caught in his chest. Merlin, he was pathetic.
“It’s evil,” he said again, forcing himself to speak calmly. “It’s a piece of rot in the world. It affects people, it might be able to reach us all the way here, even if we think we can’t feel it – don’t look at me like that. I’m not mad. If you’d seen it, you would understand.”
“You’re really serious about this, Harry?” asked Ron, looking at him like he was still waiting for him to tell them how it was all a joke.
“Well, if we tell Harry he’ll just want to go immediately. We’ve already been holding back on this for a long time and planning isn’t really his thing, he’ll just want to rush head first into all of this and…”
They all turned around to see Pansy climbing the stairs to catch up with them. Draco offered her his arm when she reached them.
remembered to cover it up. He considered reaching for his wand – he wouldn’t mind going to Azkaban, that was fine, as long as he got to kill Harry Potter and forget that this ever happened. He yanked down his sleeve staring defiantly back at Potter.
Pansy strode past as if she hadn't even noticed the Gryffindors, Greg kept his head down and followed her, and Potter and his mates seemed too engrossed in their own conversation to notice, but then Longbottom looked up and caught sight of Draco. He stopped in the middle of whatever he had been saying; the grin slid off his face and the others turned to follow his gaze. Draco locked eyes with Potter, whose expression was frozen and unreadable. Draco felt Blaise's hand on his arm. He ducked his head and hurried towards the table Pansy had claimed for them in the back.
Every door he tried in the Astronomy Tower was locked, so Harry followed the stairs all the way to the top. Up there, the door had been propped open, cold night wind blowing in to meet him. He stepped outside and found Malfoy sitting casually leaned against the parapet that ran around the edge of the tower. He looked up when he heard Harry coming towards him.
He knew he should head home but he didn't want to. It wasn't that late. There was a good chance Ron and Hermione were still awake. He considered going to another pub. Christ, that would be pathetic too, wouldn't it, just drinking by himself somewhere. He should have stayed. He should have thought of some lie to tell them. He should have changed the subject. Why was he so fucking bad at talking to people?
it was right when it was happening, before the guilt kicked in, when it was just Malfoy’s hands on his hips and his neck and in his hair, the sound of his breath, the push of his tongue, the scrape of his teeth.
“I was never a big fan of your father, but I think I’d be happy to get to see my father even if he was in Azkaban.”
Potter started. He looked around, taking a second to place Draco’s voice and spot him in the darkness. Draco sighed inwardly. Running into Potter alone at night could happen twice and still be a coincidence. Three times, and it began to look ridiculous.
Draco felt a shiver run down his spine, and he wanted to tell her she was wrong, but now he could see it too; the gentle rise and fall of the man’s chest.
He interrupted himself and groaned, hiding his face in his hands. Luna was still watching him curiously when he looked up.
“I’m trying to be polite! You really are paranoid, honestly, why would I be that interested in you?”
They did group-work for the rest of the lesson and when class was dismissed, Nott wanted them to finish up the last question and Potter was out the door within seconds, just like the rest of the Gryffindors.
Everyone had always told him the aurors was the right thing for him to do. Or, well, maybe they hadn't
Draco turned away from Pansy, forgetting what he had been about to say to her. Longbottom was watching him warily, twiddling his wand between his fingers.
Over the next couple of days, it turned out that significant looks were going to be a continuing thing. Draco supposed it was the uncertainty as to how they were supposed to act towards each other that caused this tense awareness of the other person. He was even beginning to feel that they ought to say hi to each other in the corridors, that the long eye contact or self-conscious avoidance of eye contact was getting awkward.
“And George said I can work with him and Lee in the jokeshop, so I already have a job,” said Ron. “But we’ll probably have to stay in a shitty place no matter what.”
He wasn’t sure who pulled back first. Potter’s hand remained curled in his hair for a moment when they did, before he let it fall away. He let go of Draco’s hand too. He looked away, grinning nervously.
He looked so worried and so clueless and earnest, it was unbearable. His face was right in front of Draco’s, and Draco was trying not to breathe. He could see how greasy his glasses were from here. He could see the thin, white lines of the scar stretching over his forehead. He could see that his lips were chapped and slightly parted. He was still breathing fast.
He could feel the conversation spiralling out of control, but he was too angry to stop himself. Of course she would have the wrong idea about all of it. This was why they didn’t want people to know, because Pansy was his friend and she still didn’t believe that it could be anything other than a plot on Draco’s part, she hadn’t even for one second considered that he might genuinely like Harry or that it was possible that Harry liked him back. And now he wasn’t even sure if Harry believed it either.
“Got pretty good reason to. I swear, if Witch Weekly starts calling my house about interviews I think I might actually elope somewhere, like they keep writing I’ve done.”
“No, I really don’t see how it could work in the pit,” said Granger, continuing some argument the others hadn’t been part of. “Choking the dementors should work, but if the pit is some sort of source, as we have considered it so far, then starving it doesn’t make sense.”
“About what?” Harry snaps. “What was that supposed to tell me, Malfoy? I just assumed you were as fucked up as I was, I didn’t have a bloody clue why I was doing any of it, I couldn’t talk to anyone about it, it’s not like
thought you would be able to do a job that requires you to take orders is beyond me. You have a serious problem with authority - I mean, there were times where it seemed as if just the fact that someone was an adult in a position of power was enough to make you disregard everything they said. Also, can you imagine yourself being responsible for upholding all the old wiz- the old laws? Was there a single rule in school you
At breakfast the morning after Halloween, Draco finally got a letter from his mother. It was very short – she was doing fine, he shouldn’t worry about her and should focus on his schoolwork. He had hoped for more, but at least it was her own handwriting and apart from the briefness there was nothing to indicate that she was not well. He reread it several times throughout the day and was distracted enough during meals that he didn’t actually see Potter until after lunch outside the Potions classroom. When he and the other Slytherins arrived, the hallway was already full of Gryffindors. Slughorn hadn’t shown up yet and the classroom door was locked. Potter stood on the edge of a group, not participating in their conversation. He looked thoroughly annoyed, and Draco sidled up to him.
"Then there's Nate, he's the chubby one there at the end," Malfoy said, nodding towards a pasty, brown haired boy who was deep in conversation with the blonde girl next to him and was paying them no attention.
Harry started losing track of the names by then, and the rest of the people were doomed to remain identity-less faces in his memory.
Malfoy was stubbing out his cigarette on the ledge outside, but Harry thought he saw a smirk on his face right before he turned away.
“And you could have stunned me if you wanted me to shut up, but there are certain things we just don’t do. It’s called integrity.”
“We- I didn’t think it was a good idea to tell you because I knew you would all want to go before we were ready.”
The girls turned to him, as if they had momentarily forgotten he was there. Maya's laughter dried up.
He was slightly out of breath. He looked dishevelled, his hair pulled back in a messy ponytail and his shirt crinkled like it had been left on the floor overnight. And he was wearing jeans - apparently there was not going to be an end to the absurdity any time soon.
The four of them joined the steady trickle of students coming down the marble staircase. Ahead of them, Draco noticed professor Sprout and the headmistress standing close together outside the doors to the Great Hall. They were talking fervently, and then Sprout gestured to the stairs, McGonagall turned her head and looked right at the little group of Slytherins. Her eyes settled on Draco. For a short moment, she held his gaze and his heart stilled. Then she turned back to sprout, and Draco grabbed Pansy’s arm.
One red jet caught her in the chest, the other the side of her head, and she collapsed. They all turned, wands raised, to the last standing auror, who was still fending off Ron and Ginny. Harry couldn’t tell which of their spells caught him, though one stunner came uncomfortably close to hitting Ginny instead. The auror stiffened and fell like a tree tipping over.
“Easy enough,” said Ginny. “The changing rooms weren’t locked, only the broom shed. Got it open with an
“Then go talk through your relationship problems with one of your actual friends, because I’m not doing this with you.”
And they couldn’t, but now that they could see them, their presence felt smothering. How long had they walked in darkness without noticing them, Harry wondered. Were there as many dementors behind them as there were ahead?
“I think we stand a decent chance. You should’ve seen how we flew today. Ron will be bragging all night, he saved everything Dean threw at him and he’s not going to miss a chance to rub it in. Oh, but Ginny is worried about Ravenclaw, she says the captain smiles ominously at her, but I think she’s just being paranoid…”
He wasn’t quite looking at Harry, but he wasn’t looking away either. He was drumming his fingers restlessly against the cigarette package in his hand.
But he doesn’t. And Dumbledore dies. And the world accelerates then, the war gathers momentum around them, and Harry and Draco are both swept up in it. When they see each other again the lines are clearly drawn and they’re back to playing the parts they were supposed to.
She looked absolutely shocked – if he had known this was such a sensitive subject he certainly would have breached it more carefully, but he hadn’t expected her to be so touchy about the library of all things.
"Just get here. And think of some excuse for why you weren't on time, I do not have the patience for Blaise being sulky about it the whole evening," she said and hung up before he could reply.
His palms were starting to get sweaty. He glanced towards the door. How long could it take to smoke a cigarette?
"Alright! Look, I'm sorry, okay? Bloody hell, when did you start caring this much about Ministry regulations?"
“No, we’re not,” said Granger. “So far the only thing I’ve noted down in our “things we know” column is that Azkaban is evil. All the rest is in “things to research”. So the first thing to do is obviously to visit the library.”
There are four people in there. He can see Mrs Weasley sitting on the couch, Tonks and Mr Weasley stand by the fireplace. Lupin is hovering by one of the armchairs. They all look tired.
She turned to look out at the scenery rushing by outside. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. He remembered that his mother used to talk about how well he and Pansy matched, her jet-black hair and his white-blond, his paleness to her darker colours. He remembered how she had stopped when it became clear that Pansy wouldn’t grow up to be pretty. She did look pretty to him, though she always got pissed when he tried to tell her. He realized how much he had missed her and her meanness. She was hard and sharp and would never be nice, not even to him, but their friendship was one thing he didn’t need to spend his time mending.
Hermione's Ministry issued barn owl was asleep in her cage by the window. Harry poked her gently through the bars. She opened her inky black eyes and blinked at him, looking a little peeved to be woken up.
Harry had dealt with the memories of the previous year by pretending that none of it had really happened, and since nobody else knew anything about it and he hadn’t talked about it at all, he had reached a point where most of the time he could almost believe it. Or at least he could believe that they were entirely past it, that it didn’t matter anymore. And then Malfoy kisses him, and it’s like a dam in his mind being knocked over, pent up sensory memories flooding him. He had forgotten what Malfoy smelled like. He had forgotten how soft his hair felt. He had forgotten how
He stomped out of the kitchen and up the stairs. Ron didn't follow. He still had to fight not to break into a run.
"Could have said goodbye," he said, not quite angry, but his voice nearly a drawl, familiar that way. "You know, thanked me for bringing you along and all."
"I almost got run over five times on my way here," Draco said waving a hand dismissively in his direction. "Just be glad I made it."
“Alright,” he said, his voice taking on a more business-like tone that still managed to be no less sleek or silky than before. “The last time we talked, you mentioned that you thought things had changed, and you suggested a truce. Or, you said something that could be interpreted as a peace offering, but I assume you would have corrected me by now if I was reading too much into it. So I thought we ought to meet and discuss what exactly this truce consists of.”
They all ate dinner together, but afterwards the party split into factions. George, who was more like his old self than he had been for the rest of the holidays, left the party with Lee Jordan, Alicia Spinnet and Katie Bell to go to clubs in muggle London. They carried suspiciously large bags that Ginny said were filled with fireworks from the joke shop. The adults stayed in the downstairs rooms of the burrow, and Harry and his friends retreated upstairs.
Narcissa knocked on the front door when they reached it. Draco looked grimly out at the sea. The door opened and they both looked up at the man in front of them. He was tall and seemed as colourless as the landscape around him. It was impossible to guess his age. His face was weather-beaten and he wore muggle clothing – if it hadn’t been for the wand in his hand, he could just as well have been a local fisherman. Draco knew the aurors were only stationed at Azkaban for short periods of time, but this man looked like he had lived by this coast his whole life.
“I thought it might be a good idea to see if he could still cast it when there was actually a dementor there. To make sure he’s ready when we go to Azkaban.”
“Don’t worry about him either,” said Malfoy. “He won’t talk, he knows people come here for privacy.”
“I haven’t talked to any of them recently,” she said. “Last time I heard anything, they were still talking about broomsticks.”
“Not with your muggle family?” he asked, before realizing that this was tactless because it was quite possible that they were dead.
Harry flew over the forest the next night too, and the night after it, and for three days he felt better. Less anxious, less angry, less out of place. School was manageable, Ron and Hermione were easy to be around. Then on the night between Wednesday and Thursday, his nightmares came back. He woke up gasping for air and covered in sweat. He scrambled frantically around in the darkness, groping for his wand and feeling his heart pounding hard and hectic under his ribs. He could still sense the screaming, see the snake and the inhuman face, the graveyard, the bodies. His fingers closed around the handle of the wand tucked away under his pillow.
At Hogsmeade station, the Hogwarts Express was waiting for them, bright red and gleaming in the sunlight, white smoke billowing from the steam engine. Not all students had made it from the castle to the platform yet, but it was still crowded. They had just put down their trunks while they waited for a group of girls to board the train when Ron nudged Harry’s side.
Potter closed his hand around the knob. Draco was a few metres back, Harry stood between him and the wardrobe.
"They asked if you'd come home, said you'd just disappeared last night. And of course, Hermione got really worried. She felt bad that we left you there."
Malfoy set his glass down gently – he was about halfway through it. Harry had still only had a sip of his.
He started at the loud pop when Harry came back with Granger. Then she went back for Ron who went back for Lovegood and soon all seven of them were gathered on the coast, four of them holding broomsticks. They looked out towards the sea, maybe searching for a glimpse of the tower, even though they knew they wouldn’t be able to see it.
“If I had known we were holding council, I would have been on time, but since no one bothered to tell me-”
Hermione was standing by his shoulder, so close he could only see the top of her head when he looked down. She was sifting through the beetles, her face hidden under her dark curls.
“This is not…” Draco began, but stopped himself, because he really didn’t know what he had been expecting, even if it wasn’t this.
He had his arms crossed and looked very much like he would prefer to have left with his friends. Draco waved his protest off.
“I always tried to tell him he was spoiling you, but he wouldn’t listen. You remember that summer you kept going on and on about how Harry Potter had gotten a spot on the Gryffindor quidditch team, and you weren’t even allowed to try out for Slytherin until your third year? You didn’t even ask him for anything, he just went out and bought those brooms, no questions asked-“
Potter pulled away and slumped against him; the sudden weight almost made Draco's knees buckle. Potter leaned his head against Draco's shoulder, and Draco could feel his warm breath on his neck when he laughed.
“Luna went back to Ravenclaw Tower,” Neville told him. “But she said she’d be fine with whatever we decided.”
“I’ll meet you down by the quidditch pitch when the feast begins,” said Draco, pushing open the doors to the Great Hall.
They were halfway across the room when he saw them. He noticed Potter first - Draco had spent too many years seeking out his face in a crowd to miss it now - but then his eyes moved on to the fiery red hair of the next person in the booth, Weasley, who had his arm around Granger, and next to and across from them were Finnigan and Thomas, Lovegood, Longbottom, Patil (both of them), Boot and Bones. Draco stopped dead in his tracks. Pansy's hand tightened around his arm as she tried to keep steering him forwards.
“I can see why Weasley would be mad when she spent half the year in hiding and carrying out her little terrorist missions,” he continued. “Maybe if all the houses had been allied before the Carrows came, some of us would have joined the Gryffindors, but it was too late for anything like that. They weren’t about to reach out to us and we weren’t expecting any sympathy if we had reached out to them. The roles were already given before the Carrows came.”
from despair. Or misery, or tragedy, they all use different terms… So I suppose even if we did manage to destroy all of them, with all the prisoners there, there would just be new ones created in probably a matter of hours. And for all we know, the
“There’s nothing to tell, professor. Things have been fine for half a year, I don’t see why there’s suddenly a problem now.”
When he'd first thought of it, he'd expected it would be a matter of a couple of weeks to get his things in order, but the bureaucracy had turned out to be endless. He'd even gone back to the Manor again for a short period of time, while he'd waited for his papers to go through. The Ministry was in disarray ever since the war had ended. They were still flushing out Voldemort sympathizers; suddenly everything needed to be reformed, and every procedure went even slower than it normally did as they struggled to get things back on track. There were all sorts of paperwork needed to apply for jobs in the muggle world, as well as for becoming eligible for renting a place to live, numbers and signatures he needed in order to even be considered an existing human being in muggle society. And there had been interviews too, and more instances than he could count of people telling him that it really wasn't recommended for people of purely magical background to attempt integration into muggle society, that the cultural shock might be more than he could handle, especially when he didn't have any close contacts who were muggle or muggle-born, and that the process itself was quite complicated because of the statute of secrecy, which was why it was usually reserved for squibs, and it would really be easier for him to just move to a wizarding society abroad.
“If you say so. But I still feel sorry for you, mate – I’m glad it's not me who's going to be locked up with the stupid git until he figures out how to cast a patronus.”
“I think if I had had friends like that, I might have… some things would have been easier. I might have done some things differently.”
"And if it's like… something personal or something, you don't have to tell me, but I'm going to die if I don't ask, alright?"
Longbottom and Lovegood were the furthest away from them, but he was interested in seeing what they were like in a fight. He couldn’t make out most of their verbal spells over the noise Potter and Weasley were making, but there was something clumsy about their pace. Longbottom wasn’t fast, but his spells were still much more frequent than Lovegood’s. He was pretty sure she was stepping out of the way more than she was deflecting his attacks, so his aim had to be pretty bad even if there was a heavy force behind his magic that Draco wouldn’t have expected – he had been calling him a squib for years, which seemed ridiculous now. But then Longbottom had never performed like that in a classroom. Then Lovegood raised her voice and the complicated string of words carried all the way to where Pansy and Draco were standing. There was a flash of purple light, her robes billowed around her and her blond hair rose in a white cloud. Longbottom didn’t even try to cast a protection spell, he just threw himself down on the ground to get out of the way as the spell passed over him.
"I’m glad they got you out,” Potter says finally. “I’m not- It’s not easy that you’re here, but… I don’t want you to think that I would rather you were still with Voldemort. You did the right thing, you know.”
"Oh. Yes, it says so on the packet.” Malfoy gazed out the window, looking pensive for a moment. “You know, you should start smoking, Potter. It would make a beautiful headline:
Some third year boy Draco didn’t really know – a Zabini, one of Blaise’s more distant cousins – stopped dead in his tracks a few feet from the Slytherin table, staring at the trio like one might look at a blast-ended screwt if it decided to join for breakfast.
“Don’t know. I think we have another couple of werewolves in here, they’re all like that. They don’t transform properly. Might be because of the dementors, but I don’t know.”
Draco hesitated for a second before sitting down next to him. He listened to Potter's quiet breathing and kept his eyes fixed on the street ahead of them. He was sitting very close to him. Draco was still drunk enough that it required an active effort to fight the impulse to reach out and touch him, rub his back or something. Potter might be tolerating his presence, but it was unlikely he would stand for something like that. Draco considered lighting another cigarette. Potter groaned again.
“They’re headed for the astronomy tower. I’m going to go with them, but I said I’d check on you first. I don’t suppose you’re coming?”
She sounded nervous. Harry, who was still holding on to Draco, took a step back and pulled Draco with him. Granger raised her wand and her voice seemed to drop an octave as she enunciated the complicated syllables of the curse with perfect precision. The sound of it sent a chill down Draco’s spine, he inadvertently took another step back and then almost stumbled when he was momentarily blinded by the bright, white light of the fire bursting from the tip of her wand. The flames shot forward and coiled into the fiery body of a monster – the heatwave blew back Draco’s hair, the smell of sulphur and molten iron hit his nostrils and for a second he was back in the room of hidden things, inches from his death.
She smiled at him and left. Harry looked down at his atomized shepherd’s pie. Luna was probably right about how talking to people helped, but he wasn’t sure talking to her had really cleared anything up. In fact, he decided, he still had absolutely no clue what was going on. And he wasn’t very keen on talking to Malfoy about it.
Harry looked back at him. The look on Malfoy’s face was urgent. He cast a quick glance around like he was embarrassed that he had called out so loudly.
He took a deep breath. He ought to head up to the Great Hall. He was late for dinner. They had been in the dungeon much longer than he had planned. But then, nothing had really gone as planned.
Draco spent the rest of the lesson focusing on his spellwork and he was picking it up quickly. He had hoped McGonagall would notice and possibly change her mind about the detention, but of course she didn’t.
“I won’t copy it, I just want to look at it - or just the introduction, at least. You could help me with the introduction.”
still the Ministry, you know. Old money politics, very conservative, very set in its ways. I'm surprised you managed to stick around as long as you did."
He was expecting Harry to confront him again after their midnight run in on the stairs. He was bracing himself for that second conversation, but then a couple of days passed, and it didn’t happen and he started to doubt his certainty. Maybe Potter really had said all he wanted to say. Maybe Draco was just imagining the stares, the thickening air between them. It’s too late for anyone else to come to his room, but part of him still hopes that he’s wrong.
that a lot of students wouldn’t be returning to Hogwarts after the horrors of the previous year when Snape and the Carrows ran the school. Many had moved to other schools abroad or they had been pulled out to be home-schooled. And of course there had been casualties amongst the students too. She didn’t know exactly how many it was.
"I'm going to pretend it never happened, Potter. I suggest you do the same. In a week you’ll be over whatever meltdown it is you're having right now and you'll probably tell all your friends anyway, and you can all have a good laugh about it."
“And now you think I’ll come crawling to you, the saviour of the fucking wizarding world, and ask for your forgiveness because you think I
They didn’t run into any teachers and their classes passed uneventfully. At lunch in the Great Hall McGonagall stood up at the head table as if to give a speech, and Draco tensed for a moment, but she just repeated the rules as they had been announced at the beginning of the year: That use of magic was not allowed in the hallways and outside of classrooms and study areas in general, and that duelling was prohibited at all times. She said nothing else, so he assumed no one had told the teachers about Blaise’s little outburst, even if they had detected the magic. He couldn’t help feeling a bit disappointed. But then again, it was likely he would have been dragged into the mess and blamed for the incident anyway, so perhaps it was all for the best.
“Of course I’ll come. I have to protect you from yourself. But if we get charged with treason I was under the
Draco pulled out his watch – it was hard to read it in the dark, but he was pretty sure it was only ten minutes past the time they had agreed upon. He was about to tell this to Pansy when she started violently and a strangled, high pitched sound escaped her throat. Draco had his wand out in a second, his heart pounding.
“Sure,” she said. ”I’ll see you up in the common room. And Malfoy, I guess I’ll see you tomorrow. Goodnight.”
. Harry was slightly out of breath. His legs were heavy and each step took effort – this was the lowest floor of Azkaban and somehow it felt like all the rest of the tower’s weight was pressing down on them, as if they were deep under water. It was like running in a fever dream, limbs weighed down by lead. They had no way to watch the time, but they were supposed to
Also you should all send kind thoughts to Morphine for betaing/giving me feedback, which made this so much better than it would have been without her.
She hadn’t even noticed his reaction until then, but when she turned around she looked suddenly nervous. Draco recognized the nervousness – it was the one that had grown on the face of every student last year and still surfaced whenever a voice was raised in a hallway or a classroom. It testified to their certainty that something bad was about to happen and the knowledge that they couldn’t run.
When he finally showed, he looked worn out, nervous and just as tense as Draco felt, and for a moment he was sure that it would be just as painful as he had feared, but he feigned nonchalance and made some stupid remark about Gryffindors and Potter’s lateness, and Potter laughed at it, and it turned out that was all it took. Yesterday hadn’t happened. Everything was back to normal. They went down the stairs together and locked themselves in the old classroom, but for a while none of them even mentioned the boggart. They just joked around for a bit, and Potter complained about Flitwick, and Draco agreed. Then there was a lull in the conversation and they both waited for the other to bring it up, but in the end it was Potter who did. Draco wasn’t the brave one, after all.
"And I've been back to Hogwarts a couple of times," he added. "Helped out with the reconstruction, stuff like that. They're pretty understaffed this year, so there's been lots to do."
Harry hesitated. He had thought that was what he was doing, but now that Malfoy pointed it out, it was true that he didn’t need much mental preparation to cast his patronus. That time he and Dudley were attacked by dementors, he hadn’t been thinking at all.
to see him, of course, and he didn't anticipate any sort of warm welcome from any of the other Gryffindors or Dumbledore's Army hanger-ons, but there was a reason he had tried to meet with Potter in the first place. Pansy could think what she wanted, but all Draco had been trying to achieve, the point of the whole thing, had been to make it possible for him to go to a place like this and not have his every move hampered by the anxiety of running into Potter. He had hoped that facing him, talking to him, letting him know that he wasn't
“Yeah, Ron and Hermione helped. I don’t know about Seamus and Dean… they might have figured it out. They haven’t asked.”
The strangest thing was that the anger was mostly directionless. For a few days, the fact that it was not just the government that had ignored the awfulness of Azkaban, but every single witch and wizard in Britain, was conveniently and collectively forgotten, and people raged at the Ministry. But then high ranking Ministry officials were joining the debate as well, expressing the same resentment of Azkaban. Official Ministry statements declared that the use of dementors as guards, as a method of interrogation and as a method of execution was a crime against wizard kind and a violation of the natural rights of any magical person, and then it was no longer so easy for people to decide on who to blame.
Ron and Hermione came home in the late afternoon. Harry had actually managed to forget buying groceries so they didn’t have anything for dinner, and Harry felt like an idiot for having spent his entire day napping and worrying about Malfoy instead of doing the practical things he actually had time for. So dinner was late because Harry had to apparate to the nearest Tesco and then suddenly it was 7.30 and he was already late for meeting Malfoy.
"Leave him alone, Chris," said Irie, appearing from the back room. "Draco, just go get an apron, we open in five."
“Yes, of course I can see them,” he said. “Everyone can now. So that’s one less special ability for you, but I’m sure you’ll manage.”
Draco pushed open the door to an empty compartment and Pansy levitated their suitcases onto the rack. He sat down in the seat by the window and looked back out at the platform.
“It’s not about my father – I don’t care about him, he’s gone, it’s that place. It has to be destroyed.”
“Draco, if they knew, there would be aurors running all over the place. Just act normal. Stop freaking out. Come on.”
There were no voices from downstairs anymore either. They heard the distant crack of faraway fireworks.
“Alright,” he said. “I think you’re being a right idiot. I don’t think we can trust Malfoy, and I don’t want him coming with us to Azkaban. But if you want to be friends with him, then that’s your business, and I won’t pretend I like it, but it’s not like there’s much I can do about it.”
Hopefully he hadn’t. He didn’t know how much Granger had found out – clearly enough to make her angry, but as long as she hadn’t convinced Potter to drop the whole thing, he could handle this.
Draco couldn’t think of any words. He was staring at him, he knew he was staring. He could feel his breath on his face too, and it was impossible not to think about it. That he was close enough to kiss him. And that he wanted to. And that he could.
Harry got up and picked a sweater out of the pile next to his dresser, pulled it on over his pyjamas and headed downstairs.
He was back to being the self-proclaimed protector of Hogwarts, which to him apparently meant dedicating his time to bothering Draco every moment he was awake.
Draco raised his wand. He knew that if he wanted to, he could cast his patronus as soon as Potter turned the handle, before the power of the fake dementor could even reach him. He knew Potter would pretend not to have noticed it if he did. But he would notice, and then they would both know, and there wouldn’t be a third chance after that. He had to remind himself of Azkaban. Azkaban was what was important.
The last part came out too loud, too shrill. The flat was suddenly very quiet around him. There was pointed silence on Pansy's end of the phone. He took a deep breath.
He was about to protest when he noticed Granger’s expression and knew he had overstepped a line. She obviously knew Lovegood was crazy, but he had not earned the privilege to express that sentiment.
“I don’t care what you thought," Harry snapped. "That’s personal. You don’t get to ask about it just because you read an article in some shitty gossip column.”
Draco looked down at his forearm, where even in the dark, the ugly, red thing stood out clearly against his skin. He had forgotten – he couldn’t believe it. This was not supposed to happen. It had never happened before. No, he always,
Draco didn’t need anything from the library. He would have much preferred to stay down in the Slytherin common room, rather than make his way all the way to the Northern Tower, but he had started to feel bad that he hadn’t tried harder to figure out what to do about Azkaban. Harry had mentioned that Granger was spending a lot of time up in the secret room, enough that Weasley was getting worried about her, whereas Draco had hardly spared it a thought since Lovegood had her stroke of genius with the patronus chain. He knew that it was important, he wasn’t about to let himself forget that again. It was just that he had no clue about how to move forward. It had taken them forever to come up with anything in the first place, and they still couldn’t be sure that their idea would even work. And sure, they had figured that out with a minimum of knowledge about dementors, but they knew absolutely nothing about the pit or even about Azkaban. They didn’t know when it had been constructed or by whom or what it had been used for, nothing except that it had been discovered a couple of hundred years ago and someone decided to turn it into a prison.
Shafts of sunlight fell through the arched ceiling windows onto platform 9 ¾. The station was crowded with noise and bodies, trollies with precariously balanced suitcases were pushed between parents jostling owl cages and trying to keep track of their children. In fifteen minutes the Hogwarts Express would be departing so most of this year’s students had arrived and none of their families had left yet.
Draco cast a shield charm faster than Harry could react. The moment the auror was distracted, Ron turned and sprinted towards his sister, who was backed up against a cell, throwing shield spells with frantic speed. The auror heard him and spun around, aiming her wand at his feet. Draco slashed his wand downwards in a wordless curse at the same time Neville cried:
His voiced echoed off the walls but Harry kept walking. When he disappeared around a corner, Draco’s arms fell to his sides. He took a deep breath to compose himself, suppress the boiling feelings, and then he started walking down the hall to the dungeons.
The Parkinsons were too far away to be able to hear them, but Mrs Parkinson waved when she noticed he was looking. He smiled and waved back but then quickly turned towards Pansy again.
He sank into an armchair by the fireplace. She sat down across from him and looked at him with an expression of mixed concern and sternness that reminded him of terribly McGonagall.
“Pansy passed me on the stairs and seemed to be in a perfectly good mood – and lately her temperament after spending time with you has been closer to murderous annoyance. Considering how much you aggravate her, I’m surprised you’re still friends,” he said.
The rest of the students filed out of the classroom as Draco walked to McGonagall’s desk. There were only a few curious glances.
His detention dragged on forever. He had somewhat suspected that this would be about the war, that secretly there was something the headmistress wanted to talk to him about, but she just had him practice his transfigurations for an eternity while she graded essays. She hardly looked up at him, except for once, when he rolled up his sleeves and she got a glimpse of the mark on his arm. Of course she knew it was there, but the disgust was still evident on her face and he felt his stomach churning and a stab of shame went through him when he met her gaze. He quickly returned to his spells, and she moved on to the next essay. It was past midnight when she finally let him go, and he was so tired he was sure he would be able to sleep for two whole days when he got back to his dorm.
"Bad memories?" Harry asked, turning the suggestion back on him. Which was a dumb thing to do. Malfoy had started it, but Harry didn't want to have that conversation. He knew exactly what bad memories Malfoy had of Hogwarts. Bringing it up felt like pushing the fragile peace that currently hung between them towards an edge - their conversation at the pub had been lurking in the corners ever since Harry had stepped into the flat, but they were both skirting carefully around it, keeping it casual, keeping it light, avoiding the serious shit that would make spending even half an hour in the same room unbearable.
He took shortcuts through secret passages and made his way to Gryffindor tower way ahead of the rest of the team. With all of them missing, the common room was unusually quiet. Hermione was studying at a desk by the window, immersed in a book and absentmindedly scratching the back of her hand with her quill. She had ink smudges on both her cheek and her fingers. Harry rested his Firebolt against the wall and pulled out a chair across from her.
Potter shrugged and they went back to Draco’s desk, where his cauldron was still out and scalpels and leftover ingredients were scattered on the cutting board. He took out his wand and started cleaning up. Potter was leaning on one of the other desks, watching him, and Draco felt a tug at the knot of cramped, nervous happiness in his chest.
“Nothing, I just thought since we’re already depriving ourselves of a good night’s sleep we might as well try to use our time effectively.”
“There isn’t much else for us to do,” said Ginny. “Turns out there really isn’t much other security apart from the walls and the sea and the dementors. We’ve pored over those newspaper article, and they only mentioned upping the security once after Sirius escaped, but it doesn’t seem like anyone ever pursued the idea. We’re pretty much ready to go.”
"I'm fine, Ron! Yeah, I'm a bit hungover, but I'm perfectly unsplinched. Still got all my limbs attached,” he said, waving his hand in Ron’s direction to show him his intact fingers. “All my organs in the right place. I've survived worse things than a night of drinking."
