Draco's responding smile was refreshing but, always too observant when it came to Harry, he quickly sobered and pressed for more. "But?"
He pulled apart and took in the sight of Draco Malfoy beneath him, hair mussed, lips red and swollen... He needed more!
I don't understand -- They have a routine, they usually only ever come in here during the 5pm hour after supper!" He whispered back, panicked.
"CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!"
"What? Too bitter a pill to swallow?" he cooed, mockingly, his head cocked to one side. Harry hadn't seen this level of coldness in Draco since his misguided Hogwarts years and he was suddenly very appreciative that the cruel boy he'd known had grown up to find himself on the good side of things because, with the added effect of his magic positively buzzing off the walls, it was both awe inducing and terrifying. "Oh, do you want to be
Draco felt Harry stiffen beside him and decided to intervene. "The Bulgarians, Blaise."

at all, then the office and the old apartment weren't safe either.
Silence stretched between them until Draco broke it, finally.
"No, I need you to look at me. Stay with me, now," he commanded. Harry obeyed, reluctantly finding peace in those grey eyes. He felt raw and vulnerable and Draco was standing way too close and it felt suffocating and safe all at the same time. Draco continued to search his eyes until he apparently found what he was looking for and his hand finally dropped to his side.
"As much as I wish that you'd let me help you forget all about the bastard..." Draco stiffened when a strong hand found its way onto his knee and slowly moved up his thigh. Then suddenly it was gone. "It's clear as day that you're still hung up on the bloke after all this time. Why not go back and get your fella?"
Harry grabbed a seat in the middle with Draco on his right. Hermione, Ron, and Ginny joined him on his left, and Penelope perched herself daintily next to Draco.
Slughorn came round at that moment. "Harry, my boy! Oh my..." he balked as he peered into Harry's cauldron. "Let's talk about those additional lessons after class. I really think you should reconsider. I'm sure it would be a real treat for both of us!"
want that again.
"And she would also be able to get close enough to Robards to imperius him..." Draco stroked his chin in thought. "Darn, I always liked that witch."
"Please tell me we've got some leads," he beseeched, looking around the room only to be met with disappointed faces.
"Please let him know that we're missing one of his signatures on the contract and it's paramount that he sign it in person to be eligible for any payouts. You'll be able to reach me here until morning."
"What's going on?" he asked Astoria who was closest to him.
"Yes."
It wasn't long before the shop bell rung with a dull ding and the door swung open again. Malfoy whistled as he walked along the cobbled path of Knockturn Alley and Harry followed quietly. He could've sworn that Malfoy had almost caught sight of him earlier and the last thing he needed was a confrontation in the shadiest fucking place in all of wizarding London. As if he had read Harry's mind, Draco stopped mid whistle and spun around abruptly, arm reaching out and spinning away with the invisibility cloak in hand, leaving Harry woefully exposed.

, their favorite show to laugh at muggle interpretations of witchcraft and wizardry.
Harry glared at him until Ron finally shot him an apologetic smile. He knew it made no sense but, after all this time, he still despised being the center of attention. He had no problem talking about how he or the team caught some scumbag dark wizard or walking the press through a safety plan, but all the "

His smile widened. "You just called him
"Don't worry about it! I'm just so happy that Harry is doing well and has friends who care about him. I was so glad when he was finally able to get away from those godawful relatives of his." He swallowed.
"Sebastian, please don't make me regret mixing business with pleasure," he warned with a pointed brow. "I just needed a distraction."
Harry's wandless counter repelled the jinx with such force that it pulverized part of the nearby fountain and knocked several of the oncoming Aurors backwards. Water shot high into the air from where the stone goblin had once stood and showered down upon them.
Draco lit up with excitement and Harry snogged him silly.
"Yes -- apparently, he flew by broom from New Zealand to Australia -- He mentioned something about an owl you sent him. Anyways, he asked me to get him the next portkey home. There weren't any until Sunday morning their time, I'm afraid. I don't think I've ever seen him look so distressed, though..." She shook her head.
"Harry, I wish I could promise you that nothing bad will ever happen but, not unlike yourself, I've been tempted, tortured, and tested in just about every way I can think of..." His brow furrowed as thoughts of all the unsavory moments of his life came to mind. Ollivander had called them two sides of the same coin and it struck Draco as both poetic and tragic how true that was. "But, here I am: alive, successful, and," he rolled his eyes, "until this recent fugitive status, perfectly redeemed in most places around the globe. I say all that to say: I'm not fragile. I don't break easily and I don't give up when I'm determined and, right now, I'm determined to spend a long, long time -- as many years as you and the Gods will allow -- by your side."
Potter shrugged. "You looked like you could use some company."
"You know, I wanted to believe that all this new leaf shite was a cowardly act to save your arse but
Draco snorted. "You thought coming back to a literal war zone where you risked your life -- no, excuse me -- sacrificed your life, watched people you knew and cared about be murdered, and killed a man.... would be peaceful?" he asked, incredulously.
"Ooh! Maybe we'll catch a glimpse of him doing his dueling thing. Hero boy in action!"
"The concept was real enough, though, and it's exactly why we had to be so careful when we
He shrugged. "Sorry, I couldn't think of another place for us all to talk comfortably without being overheard."
" He swirled around and swung the bat down with brute force, pulverizing a nearby vase and smashing the table it'd been sat on.
"Oh, calm your tits," she teased and kissed him on the cheek. "If you
"But that's just it, Harry!" She looked pained. "I don't think I ever wanted you to..."
"So how
Draco swallowed thickly as he pulled away and nodded as he made to leave with renewed hope and a plan forming with each step.
Draco shrugged. "I don't know that I'm that unique. I think this place is full of 17 and 18 year olds who have been put in precarious situations and we're all dealing with trauma in different ways because of it. This school and its entire student body has been so deeply affected by loss and trauma and fear and there's not even a space to talk about it and heal."
"Yep, and you took it like a man," Draco smiled as he leaned in and kissed him languidly. He pulled away and kissed him on the forehead, leaving Harry feeling oddly giddy and accomplished.
"Not exactly." He pushed the box across the desk towards her and watched her eyes light up as she pulled up a chair and began rifling through it. "I'm telling you, Hermione, the MLE  down there is rubbish. I'm tempted to just draw him out. I mean, I
"Now, are you going to let me in or not?"
"Draco." Astoria reached out and wrapped herself around his arm. He frowned down at her. "Are you still mad at me?"
Draco laughed, "If it's corrupting you were worried about then I can assure you that

"The fire's still stoked," Bill said, shaking his head, sadly.
He sighed, already feeling so very, very tired and heavy. The thought of having to interrogate this woman all day was exhausting but he had to press on. They were so close!
They both felt the mood turn somber.
She pushed him with her shoulder but laughed. She really was very pretty, if you were into girls, that is.
"He's an old friend from Durmstrang!"
"Just... little things. Like comments you make nonchalantly about guys without thinking twice about it." His cheeks warmed again. He'd definitely said the thing about David Beckham aloud to Hermione before. "It's actually pretty cute whenever you do it." She smiled.
He stilled. He had wondered about that once. He'd assumed that it wouldn't work properly but, as soon as he'd held it, he'd felt the magic course through him, reuniting them again at last!

There was a beat where the air seemed to deflate around them. Draco was surprised when Harry's head came to rest on his shoulder.
. Surely not -- regular fireworks weren't this wondrous -- this mindblowing! This was Special Edition Everlasting Technicolor Weasleys' Wildfire Whiz-Bangs!
"I'm not equipped to have this conversation," he said, reaching out to grab Harry by the arm and leading him back towards the ministry. "I need reinforcements."
Draco whimpered involuntarily as his eyes closed and he started to melt -- that is until one nagging thought popped into his head. "Blaise. If you are licking me with a tongue that's been anywhere near Ginny Weasley's twat last night I swear to Merlin I
"That was bloody
"Oh, my, what a lovely couple." She smiled kindly and Draco felt the heat rush to his face. He turned to find Harry in no better shape, his cheeks practically rosy. "May I offer you our room off of the garden? Guests always say it's our most romantic," she winked.
"The courtrooms are there." Harry pointed to the open doors where the Dementors stood sentry. "I don't think there's a way around them... We're bound to be seen, if not by the wizengamot then definitely by the Dementors."
"Oh, hello, Harry! So lovely to see you! Today is gulping plimpies day so I thought I might see an unexpected friend," she smiled.
to epic proportions." He rolled his eyes, a teasing smile on his lips as he made air quotes. Draco made to protest but Harry stopped him. "No, I've enough wins under my belt to admit it: I've been shite at this case from the very beginning and that Sebastian bloke has played me like a fiddle every step of the way." He scrunched his face up in distaste at the admission.
"Oh."
"Mr. Malfoy, sir! How was your meeting yesterday?" she asked, walking over to sit down daintily in front of the hearth on her end.
Long seconds passed before the next strike of lighting flashed to illuminate an enraged Sebastian brandishing the Elder Wand and advancing quickly!
He shook his head. It was too much to process...
he hummed as he changed out of his three piece suit and searched his closet for something to wear for a night out. Long fingers skimmed over a beaded, shocking-pink bustier top and tulle tutu from last year's Sydney Mardi Gras and he smiled at the memory. The Oceana Wizarding Pride Alliance had invited him to join their float and it had been a wondrous extravaganza, to be sure. Needless to say,
you'd figure it out! Thank you...
There were groans from the little group of preschoolers as they dispersed, some of whom he knew were off to make the colorful room an even bigger mess than it already was. And, right on cue, he screwed up his eyes as the room was filled with the sound of hundreds of Legos pouring out of the Lego bucket. He shook his head, silently thanking Merlin for cleaning charms.
"Today, I'd like to work on something more challenging! Let's see if I can stump you with some of the flashier spells!" He smiled. "Can anyone name some of the spells that are guaranteed to get you some additional points on your NEWTS?"
"Alexandra!" She started and he shot her an apologetic smile as she regained her composure. "I'm glad I caught you before you left--"
Boply nodded and disappeared with a loud crack.
"It's obvious, isn't it?" Hermione waited and then rolled her eyes when they both stared at her blankly. "Bulgaria's slated to host the next Quidditch World Cup. Can you imagine the profit investors stand to make if they can get in on the ground floor? I'm sure it would be the opportunity of a lifetime for Zabini and Malfoy's investment firm."
"Wha--" he started to ask before the ridiculous things they were saying started to click into place. He tried to keep his voice even as a mixture of panic and anger began to bubble in his core. "Are you saying... that the blonde bloke that I was with... the one who was so pissed he could barely stand up proper or string together two full, coherent sentences... Are you saying that he went to the restroom alone with a complete stranger?"
"You're one to talk, love. You're the one who made sure they got each other in the Secret Santa." He squeezed her closer.
"Excuse me, Ramona -- why, don't
He smiled at Draco ruefully.
"Mother, where is all of this coming from? What changed?"
. I do. I do love you." His words were still slurred and Harry wanted them to stop. He didn't know if he could bare hearing them in the first place and especially didn't want to hear them and have to spend the rest of his life questioning whether the drunken man had actually meant them. "Wish things were different."
Harry and Draco exchanged a darting, furtive glance behind Ron's back.
She looked between the two of them and beamed, knowingly, only wincing a little bit at the action.
It pained him to say it, but he knew it to be true. She looked terrified while she processed his words. She blinked back at him after a few long moments and he watched her resolve form. She nodded.
Ollivander's eyes went wide again and he sputtered wordlessly for a moment. Draco thought he heard him curse under his breath but when he returned his gaze to them, he simply shook his head.
The moment was broken when Alex marched through Draco's opened office door in a huff, this time nursing a nipped finger along with yet another rolled up piece of parchment.
he whispered low over the wand and spun in place as gold dust spun from its tip and covered the length of the street, clinging to three sets of magical footprints.

"Looky looky. What a sight we have here!" came Yaxley's haughty voice. "You like cock don't you, Mr. Potter?"
"I can't believe Potter's really heading up the river to Azkaban," whispered a wizard who he also knew from their training class: Reynolds, or something. "Do you really think he did it?"
"But I hoped I'd run into you," he said, sheepishly, his face turning pink and his gaze purposely avoiding Ron. "I wanted to show you something. Do you have time?"
He conjured a seat and then sat down with his head in his hands. Finally he looked to his best mates.
"Harry, I've never experienced anything like that before in my life! That was the sexiest thing I've ever..." He paused, shaking his head in disbelief. "Merlin, I'm lucky." Awe reflected in his eyes as he stared back into Harry's.
Draco raised a curious brow. "Whatever do you mean, Teddy?"
"Mr. Malfoy, sir --" she said, composing herself behind her desk.
route through the Hogshead.
"We'd better go," he said, reaching for his hand. "We're about to have company."
Draco sat up straight, pupils going wide as his mind whirred.
"I'm on it, Harry." She saluted and headed out of the door.
"Well... What is sex usually like for you? Let's say...
"Erhm," the bloke cleared his throat and shook his head as he continued. "I was saying that we only know one side of the story. We know very little about yous lot or what any of this might mean." He gestured to the box.

Draco's eyes snapped up and he was surprised to see his mother reflected in the mirror, standing by the bedroom door.
"What kind of a question is that?" Blaise looked over his shoulder. "Of course it's Puddlemere!"
Harry smirked, chin in his hand as he watched, entranced.
control, however, was being damn good at his job.
"Did you know that Draco is getting married?"
Harry simply kissed him on the cheek and pointed upwards to where the magical green timer flashed an impressive: 5 minutes and 52 seconds.
"A rare sight, that was, to see Fred actually embarrassed about something but he turned red as a beet!" George remembered joyfully. "He, of course, tried to chalk it up to Lee being his best mate but then Ron had a moment of pure brilliance with this little gem:
He thought about it for a long moment.
"Then I declare you..." The tufty-haired wizard paused to look at Draco. Harry blinked between the two of them, confused, when he realized that all eyes had fallen onto his groom, expectantly.
But: SOME ANSWERS!!! (Only some, keep reading for more 😉). Did anyone guess that twist?? 🤔
Draco nudged her with his own knee. "What are you going to do to celebrate her?"
He turned and rolled his eyes as Sebastian stood tall, wand astutely fixed above Draco's heart. "I hardly see the point, Sebastian. Last I checked, I
He let his cloak drop to the floor and waved his wand with one hand while he loosened his tie with the other. The muggle CD player with the surround sound speakers that he'd invested in began to play a familiar tune and he swayed his hips as he made his way to his bedroom.
She had already chewed her fingernails down to stubs and her carpet looked slightly worn from where she'd intermittently taken to pacing. It had been hours since Robards had informed her of Potter and Malfoy's escape from Appleby and she had been stationed by the floo, hoping for a more
"Yes, Harry?" Stevens asked when the room was nearly empty.
Stevens shook her head again, "Well, I for one, am not comfortable serving up our leader on a silver platter without any proof!"

home. Are you sure she isn't there?"
" he hissed and the green flames died.
"We have been giving it a fair go, mate. Got his face out among our lot and in all the muggle papers. Problem is, most of the good samaritans who reach out with tips refuse to dob on him once we get there, ay?" The other man nodded his agreement. "Somehow, he walks away with them thinking he's just some misunderstood larrikin."
"Harry...
"Right." He nodded invisibly and then cursed himself as he walked off towards the apothecary that the 3 had vanished into.
"Yes, love?" Draco turned around to reveal the front of a white and pink apron that said:
He thought on all of that for a moment, trying to make sense of and integrate all the seemingly impossible bits of information.
"Draco! Thank the Gods! Wait, are you at the Manor?" he asked with a furrowed brow. "Nevermind -- Draco, what in the bloody hell is going on?! I got your owl about Ginny and I've been trying to get home ever since! Then, I finally make it this far and
"Good. Because I think this truly is the happiest day of my life." He stared lovingly into Harry's eyes and, in that moment, they were in a world all their own: A world that spoke of promises of real happiness and eternities and little Potter-Malfoys.
"Yea, that's the one," he said distractedly. He stepped to the side so that Harry could unlock the vault with his wand using the combination of taps that Pansy had given them. The tumblers inside the lock clicked and turned with each tap.
Draco folded his arms and sighed. Most days he felt like an undeserving piece of shite and the rest of the world did nothing to curb that. The war had been an awful pill to swallow and he'd witnessed so much that made him feel like filth by association. He felt like he was constantly trying to clear his conscious and Potter didn't even know the half of it. Yet, despite his efforts, he felt like he was failing miserably and, at this point, he was doubtful that this stupid job was the answer.
"You know you want to try..." he sung, teasingly.
"Draco, run!" Harry said as he hit Jansen with a wandless jinx that pushed him over the edge of the bank. They heard a loud splash followed by a string of expletives as he hit the icy waters and they ran in the opposite direction.
"But..."
time-turners," Hermione corrected as she seamlessly switched positions to feed the newborn baby pressed to her bosom (she was still such a squishy little thing).
They both sat up straight.
is why I like you, mate! You're one baaad mofo!" Draco rolled his eyes. "Oh, I'm going to hate to have to kill you... You really do have such

"Right! The beau means we're all business, now, right, Malfoy? You made that much very clear the last time we met. Well that's just great because I'm in the market to
"Draco, I... I'm so sorry! I just didn't know what else to do! Our wedding is in 11 days and all my family has done is lie!" He kept his face carefully blank as he listened. "My family isn't as well off anymore as they made it seem when bartering with your parents and we don't actually have the money to cover the wedding! My grandfather insisted that this was the only way! That nobody would notice a few ancient artifacts gone missing!"
Just then, the door opened and in walks a girl, dress in all black with her head bowed and her hands bound behind her back. Behind her was Harry Potter, worried brow searching the restaurant.
that's not what I want to taste right now," he said, voice low and rough in his ear as he let his arms, now wrapped around Draco's back, slide down his arse and stop at the back of his thighs.
"I'll go visit tomorrow. I'm still not quite sure of the point." His brow furrowed as he stared down at his cup. "Pansy swears that they complain to her folks all the time that I don't visit them enough but, when I do, mother barely looks at me and father gripes the whole time about what a disappointment I am."
Harry wrapped his arm around him and kissed him sweetly on the cheek, making said cheeks turn even redder.
Distracted was an understatement. He kept reliving every moment of the previous day on a loop, trying to understand how things had gotten to where they did.
She wrapped an arm around his shoulders and planted a soft kiss in his hair. And that was it. He was sobbing. She held him tight and rocked him side to side and he inhaled the scent of gardenias and peonies mixed with love that he hadn't wanted to admit he'd missed for so long.
As if she could sense his gaze, she turned and they locked eyes causing her to abruptly drop her hand and nod her goodbyes to Blaise.
Harry sighed, exhausted.
"Shame. You two really would be cute together." She said, nudging him with her elbow. "All I know is that I can't remember seeing either of you laugh or smile in at least the past 3 years like you did today during potions." She said teasingly as she stood to head back to the castle.
"Oh, Harry!" Draco called out as his cock pulsed, filling Harry's mouth with warm rivulets of his seed. He stared up at Draco, ardently, mouth still wrapped around his partner's softening cock as he came down until Draco finally urged him to stand.
to make this dream a reality!
Draco wavered, conflicted. He had thought his deciding moment in the upcoming war would be whether or not he was actually able to kill Albus Dumbledore. Instead, it now all seemed to come down to whether or not he'd let an injured, addled brain Harry Potter wander off into muggle London alone.
There was still a hint of pink on her cheeks when she reached Harry but she disguised it with a smug smile.
Ginny think if she knew that he had kissed a bloke? It had been
Harry shook his head. He had been truly baffled when the woman had cornered him outside the entrance first thing this morning and begged him to investigate the situation with discretion. It was a bizarre start to his first day but, hey, at least he could say it wasn't boring and, for that, he was grateful.
Draco chuckled but continued. "There's so little info here and I realize that if I really want to understand the psychology of it then I'd need to learn from the experts. So, I've been thinking about it and... I've decided to apply to a few universities for next year with top notch psychology programs..." he finished shyly, two faint red spots appearing over his cheeks.
the Warbeck case..." Harry said, his own rage building. This was a sick and extremely meticulous man they were dealing with.
There was a long pause before the blonde huffed and reluctantly turned back onto his side to face Harry.
Malfoy's eyes widened in surprise and then a sly smirk spread across his face. "I'm trying to turn over a new leaf, Potter. Besides," he said, glancing around vigilantly again. "I'm pretty sure there are rules about you consorting with death eaters."
Harry shook his head. "It doesn't even matter right now, Zabini. Right now, all that matters is..." Harry swallowed hard and closed his eyes in defeat. "Blaise Zabini, you are the only one who can save Ginny."
The woman nodded. "I half thought I was going mad, made it all up, you see. It's not everyday that a strange girl falls out of the chimney like a mixed up Father Christmas! That is -- until two men crashed in, one after the other, not even a full minute after she'd run out of the door!"
Draco pulled him to his chest and hugged him tight.
"No, dear, I'm holding that little gem against you forever and ever." She smirked impishly. "Serves you right to try to ditch me at the alter!"
The two Gryffindors looked baffled. Draco had had every intention of asking them to break him in and help break Harry out. That's what Gryffindors are for, right? But then he had seen Rose which already made him feel conflicted but, the moment he'd heard about their growing family... He shook his head.
"What? Harry, now is not the time for doctors -- more Aurors!"
! There's no need to bother the poor bloke again when I'm sure there are other leads we could be following," he explained. "You know, if
Draco shot him a questioning brow. Harry simply smirked as he reached into his pocket and pulled out the Hawthorn wand and placed it in his palm.
This is where Potter would usually interject with something rude about father but instead, he just stared back with patient green eyes.
Draco laughed a beautiful, melodic note and smiled back at him. "Oh, Harry, you've never experienced a night out with the girls! Believe me when I say I've had practice holding my liquor under... unusual circumstances." He shrugged. "I figured that if you and Ollivander weren't just completely bunkers and I really did have some bizarre, miraculous claim to the Elder Wand, then it'd help to not make the bloke more powerful by giving him the chance to disarm me. Speaking of which--" Draco looked around frantically as if only now remembering the urgency of the situation. "Sebastian! Where is he?! We can't let him get away with that wand! Harry, if he could use a killing curse like that without even technically mastering the wand, then we've got a problem!"
"Mmm, I love it when you talk dirty to me." She smirked. "Why are you still here? Shouldn't you be somewhere off snogging the savior?"
"On Sebastian's farm!" she blurted out and then looked horrified at her admission.
But still... Harry knew he hated the UK and, somehow, it seemed like Draco was making all the concessions and he didn't know that he, alone, could make it worth it for him...
"Nope, not interested."
"None of your business," he said, not taking his eyes off of his page. Another moment went by in silence before it became clear that Potter had no real plans of leaving. He sighed and finally looked up to see him staring back at him, amused, the circles under his eyes impossibly darker. Draco looked around them warily. "Why are you
"Not since last week. We were meant to get lunch yesterday but she must've forgotten. I suppose she's having a rough week." Her expression saddened. "I know she's had a lot on her mind."
"I will find her, Ron. I don't care what it takes--" He grit his teeth and fought back the burning tears that threatened to escape. "I promise."
"Yea, it'll be fun!" Potter smirked. Draco sighed, resigned. "Well... we'd have to wait until the quidditch pitch has finished growing back out or Madam Hooch will have our heads! So maybe in the next month or 2? I'd also better run it by McGonagall first and make sure she's alright with it," he contemplated while the children bounced up and down in excitement
Lucius, like most other captured death eaters, was still sat in Azkaban awaiting trial as the Ministry was really drawing out the process. Draco and his mother had been there for only three weeks but it had been the most miserable three weeks of his life. He would be forever haunted by the screams of misery and hopelessness held within those walls. Just when he felt himself giving in to irrevocable despair, he was told that mother and his trials had been expedited. No one told him why, but he had his theories.
(See the end of the chapter for
A spot of color rose to Harry's cheeks and he looked down to play with the fringe of the white dress. "I know... but I kinda really liked that configuration..." he said, sheepishly.
went and told a sociopath about it."
"How many times do I have to tell you?! She asked for a divorce on Sunday and said that she wasn't coming home. She was planning to stay at our friend's home!"
"And it's not like the bloke's a stranger to making himself scarce. There are whole years of his life that are simply unaccounted for in any of our ministry records."
Harry wrapped his arms around him and held him tightly, planting kisses in soft blonde hair.
is why I chose you as my partner," he said matter-of-factly as he let go of his hand abruptly. "All done!"
She rolled her eyes. "Again, I do have eyes and common sense. --Most times!" she corrected when he shot her a glare.
"Your type?" He screwed up his face in confusion. "Blonde?"
"Nah, mate, it's Pots. You're close though... You know, I suppose Potter could work as a nickname if you really wanted it to," he pondered, realizing that he'd probably never see this kid again in his life so what did it really matter what he called him?
"Would you like another drink, sir? I insist, you should have another drink," she said, trying to press a drink into his hand.
"But there's more that doesn't add up... Sebastian's mother was muggle, he was raised muggle... He's perfectly at ease interacting in muggle spaces... In fact, the most I've ever heard the bloke say about politics was that he thought the Statue of Secrecy was rubbish and that it made no sense that wizards and muggles
. And that's all he wanted with Draco, really.
They both dissolved into a fit of giggles, each too tired to even give a damn.
"What?! You knew?!" he asked, his eyes wide with surprise.
! But then you started defending him and whatever the hell that was yesterday in potions," he glanced at him suspiciously. "...it was obvious that something had shifted. It wasn't until this morning that things started clicking into place and Hermione's hints started making sense." He chortled. "Yesterday she pointed out that she didn't think
"Draco?!" Harry panted, hand shooting out to grasp at empty sheets.
Draco shook his head and smiled a toothy incredulous smile. He gently shifted Harry off his chest and turned onto his side to face him head-on, instead. Harry followed suit, their faces mere inches away and Harry's eyes traveling down to soft pink lips as Draco spoke again, so softly that he could barely hear it.

"I've got it, Harry!" said Melissa, one of his favorite volunteers at the center. He nodded his appreciations and, waving his wand to make the glitter and braids and bows disappear, went to make sure the pet pygmy puffs were fed.
He screwed his face up incredulously. "Harry, how could the most powerful wand in the world be won so easily by

Harry bowed his head. "I don't know if someone that I love and care about is alive or not and yet another person that I trusted has betrayed me... Anavi, I

"Stevens, can I see you for a minute? Gains, Philips -- good job on breaking up that illegal kneazle breeding ring." The rookies, still sporting bandages wrapped around their faces, smiled and nodded ruefully as they headed out.
"Yes. Lucius has always seemed to enjoy this particular form of torture with young muggle men, he no doubt would have found this to be the sweetest revenge for our dear Harry Potter," he almost purred, his voice hitching.
They were both shocked when a silver stag actually shot through the tip of Draco's wand. It galloped around the room, driving off the looming dementors.
"Stori."
"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good," he said, watching Malfoy's face light up as the map came to life.
"Wow, Harry... I don't know what to say..." The smile settled more assuredly on her freckled face. "Happy anniversary!"
She scoffed.

As for his parents... Well, Draco guessed he could count himself lucky that after the prospect of losing their son for the
In one, Zabini pretended to scowl while his mom, a gorgeous woman with long, thick, black hair showered him with kisses. Every now and then, portrait Zabini would smile wryly, clearly loving the attention.
"Well, sometimes people can surprise you, mate." Sebastian shrugged. "Come on, put that down and let's go inside. You've had a shock, let's get you some more tea -- I know how you Brits like tea."
Harry fought his smile. "Draco, that's what you're on about right now? Really,
"Borgin." Past experience had taught him that it was best to skip the formalities and get straight to the point. "We're investigating the disappearance of a string of antique magical heirlooms: Hector Fawley's pocket compass which was believed to be imbued with the homonculous charm, Josephina Flint's enchanted amulet, Doria Shafiq's golden quill, and Geraint Ollivander's original wood carving knife. Do any of those things mean anything to you?"
Harry and Draco exchanged a look.
"Oh yes! Two boys, opposite sides of the same coin. Both miraculously the possessors of both a Hawthorn wand and the Elder Wand."
He wasn't a man of moral high grounds nor was he a "follow your heart" type of bloke. His life had never been about himself, but rather about upholding, honoring, and protecting his family. That was his main life's goal.
"Sorry, to disappoint. But I do prefer tea and Potter is very well hung." He shrugged against his bindings. "You know good dick can make a girl do crazy things."
"Oh no, Ginny isn't here. Should she be here?" she asked, a thoughtful look on her face.
Ron paused and shot him a strange look. "First name basis are you, now?"
Potter whistled. "Now that is some serious business, that is." He smiled as he pulled out a pouch and pointed his wand to direct the still floating heirlooms into it.
" Harry hissed, mortified, and placed his face in his hand. Draco shot him a semi-apologetic smirk before he turned back to his mother who was avoiding his gaze again. For some reason, she reminded him of a wounded cat.
"Yea, thanks again, mate. Who knows what would have happened if you hadn't got there in time," Harry played along cheerfully. He glanced around to take in the shocked onlookers.
"Nope!" he cut her off, preemptively, when she glanced towards his bulge. He really didn't feel like it -- not mentally, at least. "Today is all about you. I've got your breakfast sitting under a warming stasis charm, I had Neville help me to finally clear the garden and plant those sunflowers you've been dreaming of, I took off of work and told Anavi to hold all my owls -- barring a level 3 emergency or higher, of course -- so that we can do whatever you like, and we've got reservations for some fancy schmanchy place called
want to become a Dark Lord?"
Harry deflated, realizing that he was right. If he didn't have to think about Draco, he might've taken the risk regardless. But, as much as he'd talked about his own fear of loss, he'd be kicking himself for eternity in the afterworld if he
He took a deep breath, realizing that they weren't used to seeing him like that and that two weeks in was not the time to lose it.
Draco lay flat on his back in the grass next to Dumbledore's tomb, eating lemon drops and watching the clouds drift by. He sighed as the familiar, large eagle owl came into view and circled lower and lower before landing near his head, a letter addressed to Draco in tow.
"Blaise... Blaise, are you there?"
Harry felt goosebumps as Draco hovered over him and placed a wet, open-mouthed kiss on the small of his back. He let his eyelids flutter shut as Draco continued kneading his bum with sure, calming hands and occasionally peppered him with tender kisses, going lower and alternating from right cheek to left. When Draco spread his cheeks wider and placed a kiss directly over his hole, his eyes snapped open.
Draco looked back warily into green eyes. He looked away as he remembered his father's words from the night before he was to go away to Hogwarts.
He nodded. "Good luck," he said solemnly before the floo ended.
Harry's eyes widened. "Are you going to do that?"
He groaned and put his face in his hands. What in the
"What's happening? Can they see us?" Draco asked, unsure.
to! Harry, I nearly lost you today -- I'd marry you right here, right now, but..."
"Let's just all thank Merlin he's actually good at chess!"
She sighed.
"I promise!" Harry said desperately, breathlessly.
"And why be on a side where people..." He swallowed hard, unable to finish the sentence. He couldn't acknowledge what they'd done to him. Not yet.
"No! I mean, yes! Please, don't stop!" he pleaded.
Harry merely rolled his eyes and dragged Draco over to a vender cart where he'd spotted a baseball cap and a black wig.
"Oh, hunny." She took his hand in hers and laid her head on his shoulder. "And Potter?"
What was he getting at? Was Harry missing something?
"So he was behind the DMT case
" Ron stopped himself and ran his fingers through his hair in frustration. "Harry, every time you push people away with the whole
"Congratulations, you two," Parvati whispered with a wink and then said louder for the onlookers: "Glad you're both ok then! Oh, and Lavender's party is this weekend. Harry, did Draco tell you that you two are going to be in charge of making the cake?"
"Sebastian told us that he vuld guarantee that ve got an audience vith the famous Draco Malfoy for the deal of a lifetime if only ve could bring him the girl! He arranged for us to sit vith his business partner at the inauguration and told us ve just had to get Oblansk onboard."
ago and even had a son who'd be about Rose's age now.
When Draco witnesses Harry be raped by death eaters the summer before 6th year, all of his convictions are questioned as he steps in to save Harry's life. When they return to Hogwarts after the war, Harry and Draco both struggle to define themselves outside of the roles that everyone expects of them while helping each other heal from their respective traumas.
"Neville!" Lee exclaimed as Neville and Hannah finally joined them. "How long did it take for Ron's weird love voodoo to work on you two?"
He shook his head and smiled in defeat.
"Speaking of my wife, how about we find her so I won't feel guilty for doing that..."
"You look cute with glasses," Blaise said, a suggestive note in his voice.
"Harry, I think we've got to talk about sex before you drive me mad," he said from his position atop Harry, leaning in to capture his bottom lip and tugging once more before he sat up. Harry moaned and reluctantly sat up, too. "What do you want, Harry?"
"Oh, come now! You're no fun!" He pretended to pout until he was no longer able to contain his excitement and said in a rush: "The Bulgarian Minister for Magic is interested in having Z&M International be the underwriters to fund the Quidditch World Cup!"
"Do you know how beautiful a sight this is?" he said, finally reaching out and massaging Harry's bum. He let one finger slide teasingly down his crack before gently tickling Harry's balls. Harry took a deep, steadying breath, feeling incredibly aroused though extremely nervous.
so, at least." He shrugged and took a bite of one of the sausages.
Harry's cheeks turned beet red as the word "
"No, I want you to move." He
"What? No, I don't believe it." She shook her head.
Harry stood so that they were face to face.
Draco sighed but didn't bother trying to figure out which rude little first years he'd somehow scared away this time. At this point it didn't matter. They were all convinced that he was a monster.
hold your whiskey, mate. You're..." Draco thought for a moment. "On a movie set! Yea, that's it! And they really like to stay in character here." He nodded.
"You know you're infuriatingly sexy whenever you pull off that 'auror extraordinaire' crap?" he asked, leaning in to nose at him, teasingly.
then I don't think he'll be able to control it..."
"Get a move on, mate!" Sebastian shouted, the tip of his wand pressing awkwardly into Draco's back. "And Malfoy, I swear if you try any funny business I'll kill you right here, right now!"
"Oh, I don't know... I can name quite a few things that you do
Harry didn't expect it to take long, however. He needed to end this. Now.
Harry shook his head slowly, his eyes on Draco's lips.
Potter barked out a laugh. "Yea, maybe."
Hannah nodded enthusiastically. "Neville and I had just left the greenhouses after helping professor sprout pot mandrakes for extra house points. We ran into Ron on our way back to the castle."
Draco shook his head. "It's different now and you know it. And this bubble bursts in a week and you'll go back to calling me Malfoy and, for everyone else, it will be completely unremarkable. For us, however, it will forever be a reminder of what almost was but couldn't be."
"Eat, it's fine," he assured. "Mother just does that. She'll do or say something awful and then get scared that I'll leave her for good and then she'll do something nice and unexpectedly motherly like knit me something or make me my favorite meal. It's positively manipulative, of course, but, at least I get the good stuff," he said, doing a little happy dance as he savored his bite of pancakes.
"Very nice work!" said Hermione from his left. "Hey, Draco? Will you be joining us in the dueling club tomorrow? It's the first meeting of the year and Harry will be leading. You could help get the younger Slytherins involved and maybe help teach them some things!"
"When you forget that you think you're supposed to be playing a role. When your hair is a mess, when you're wearing pajamas instead of expensive clothes, when your glasses are on display and you're just excited to talk about the things you're passionate about... I love it when you smile that broad unguarded smile or --" he kissed the corner of Draco's mouth. "--
"Mr. Ollivander!" Harry said firmly, snapping the man out of his euphoric gaze. "We are not here to talk about wands. We are investigating a string of burglaries and we were hoping you could give us a bit more information."
Draco paused. "I always thought I was lucky: my father was my idol. There was nothing in the world that I wanted to aspire to more than to be just like him. But... 6th year..." He shook his head, remembering the shock and disgust of realizing what his father was capable of and then later the sheer anger that he'd felt towards his father for leading him down a path that would compromise all of his morals. "It just became glaringly clear that his flaws were deep and some of them unforgivable."
Harry smiled, contentedly, finally feeling like all of the old hatchets were buried, the bridges crossed. They were going to be ok.
Ok, I made myself cry a little with that one :'(.
are garnering the most buzz. You see, Hedwig Foundation is the brainchild of
Harry rolled his eyes. "Please. Like I'd ever let anyone besides
He paused when he noticed the date of the alleged argument which was supposedly the last time that Ginny was seen.
Draco looked up to see him pointing at a tawny owl headed their way. He could just make out the British Ministry of Magic emblem wrapped around its neck. He quickly relieved the owl of its letter and was surprised when he saw the signature on the parchment. He read through the short message twice with narrowed eyes.
He walked quickly and stealthily through Snape's office to where someone was clearly kicking at the door. He was sure the wards couldn't be breached but he readied his wand all the same.
"Well, sometimes people can surprise you, mate." Sebastian shrugged. "Come on, put that down and let's go inside. You've had a shock, let's get you some more tea -- I know how you Brits like tea."
The moment was broken when they heard the sound of someone trying to get into the vault. Harry immediately stepped forward, wand out and putting Draco behind him. They braced themselves but the person was clearly an amateur and hoping that it would open with a simple
Draco smiled -- not in the smug way that he usually did but it was toothy and unguarded. "I mostly came back because I know that if I get accepted I'm going to be a giant squid out of water in the muggle world and I figured I could use all the muggle studies I could get. Plus, I figure if I can get enough NEWTS, I can simultaneously do an internship at St. Mungos and maybe become a healer." He shrugged.
"No, but you really ought to check on
They both frowned in thought until it occurred to them at the same time:
"Sorry, you can't get rid of us that easily!" Harry responded, cheekily.
She had cried when she told him and he had wanted to cry, too. Not because he didn't want it to end but because Ginny was meant to represent a future full of happiness and he didn't know if he'd ever have that. He didn't cry though because she needed him to be strong, so he held her and fought back the lump in his throat instead. Now, they were friends and Periwinkle was having a conniption, saying it was all a PR nightmare and doing her best to keep the breakup under wraps until people weren't so desperately in need of hope for the very things Harry was in fear of losing: love and happiness. The rumor was slowly starting to get around Hogwarts though as Ginny and Zabini got cozier. He didn't care. He only hoped that she knew what she was doing with the Slytherin.
Harry sighed in defeat, giving up on the rock that continued to lay there, mockingly, completely unfazed. At this point, all he could do was hope that Ron wouldn't let them stop looking for Ginny after he was... He swallowed hard as his mind drifted off to memories of his late godfather, fresh out of Azkaban in his third year. He tried to imagine his own face on Sirius' gaunt, emaciated figure from that year and shivered at the thought. And that was only
"You really love him, don't you?" Hermione asked and he hated the soft sadness in her voice that meant she actually saw through him.
Harry stopped fighting with Ginny and turned towards Draco.
"He just vanted to talk! His girlfriend -- the red haired girl!"
"Draco wavered, conflicted. He had thought his deciding moment in the upcoming war would be whether or not he was actually able to kill Albus Dumbledore. Instead, it now seemed to all come down to whether or not he'd let an injured, addled brain Harry Potter wander off into muggle London alone."
"Put Stevens in charge, no Robards."
Harry blinked back at her, surprised. A small smile curled his lips as his eyes were drawn back to the colorful bouquet and his heart warmed, fondly, in spite of himself.
He stilled. He pulled away and turned horrified eyes onto Astoria Greengrass.
Harry shared an incredulous look with Andromeda and laughed.
"You might want to ditch the robes."
"Astoria. I am rich." He blinked, dazed. "I am ridiculously, stupidly wealthy just off of inheritance alone. I simply do not understand why you wouldn't just tell me. I would have paid for the wedding."
Draco ignored him as he crossed the room to take it and headed back to his own desk in the adjacent office.
obsessed with him would have ever strung together in the first place.
Draco walked away from that tragic day with gratitude for his Auror training kicking in when he needed it, deep sadness for the lives they could not save, and a new found appreciation for his own life.
She leaned across the counter, cleavage spilling out of her red sweater and over the top of the green smock. "Oh good, I'm glad you like it." She said, her smile growing wide and teasing, the little imp.
"Well, first of all, I think not acknowledging your sexual trauma would be foolish for both of us. You've got to remember that I was there, too, Harry... It was traumatic for me in a different type of way..." He swallowed hard and Harry'd stared into intense grey eyes that showed a glimpse of the pain behind them. He had never thought much about what that must've been like for Draco to have witnessed. "It's a particular type of hell to stand by helplessly and watch someone you lo--" He stopped himself but Harry's heart still fluttered. "To watch someone you care about -- even if you
"What else is new?" they responded in unison and laughed in earnest as the door shut behind him. Now
Draco (who was now mostly himself except for the brown curly hair atop his head which was rapidly growing longer) looked even paler than normal. It suddenly dawned on Harry that Draco left training at the very
"Well, you've definitely fractured some knuckles and my bone mending is shite..." Draco winced as he turned his hand. "But the cuts seem shallow and I've healed enough cuts and skinned knees for my godson that I should be able to stop the bleeding and splint it easy enough until you can make a trip to St. Mungos."
Harry stalled and lifted up to face him, shocked. "I don't want to blame you, Draco."
Draco nodded.
"You're a good elf, Boply. How about you go on. I'm going to go grab those things for Pansy."
"What would the Bulgarians want with Ginny?" Hermione asked, perplexed.
Bullocks. The patronus charm was one that he was
He reached out to caress her face lovingly.
"Relax, Harry. We're not going to have sex."
old." He laughed.
But he was already out the door. He stopped at the nearest boys bathroom and took off his glasses to throw water on his face. He gripped the side of the sink and stared back into tired green eyes.
"If it makes you feel any better... I get it. I'm just better at casting good glamours, apparently. You should really learn to meditate. Mindfulness meditations help me."
"I'm not hungry," he said, annoyed as he turned back towards Snape's office.

the young man that makes Harry happy, then: Welcome to the family, Draco, dear."
"My baby brother and his keen, yet, oblivious sense of observation, of course!"
She huffed, indignantly, but remained persistent.
Cedrick Diggory's birthmark had been tiny and on his left inner thigh. The only reason that Draco had ever noticed or dared to obsess over it was because the bloke's enormous dick always hung to the left and his eyes couldn't help but stray to it in the changing rooms after quidditch. The peculiar shape had puzzled him for over a year until he'd finally secretly gawked at the man enough that it clicked that it was, indeed, shaped like a hippogriff. There wasn't a straight bloke alive who would have noticed that detail...
Angelina turned to George. "That was a grade A, nuclear bomb type Ron-ism, that was! How could they resist that?!"
"He's right, you know, Harry?" Harry turned to him with wide, frightened eyes as he registered the wand in his muggle friend's hand. "Why keep fighting it? Do you really want this on your hands?"
" Draco hissed somewhat hysterically. He reached out to stop Harry who'd been marching determinedly towards the Whomping Willow. "Harry, I haven't done this in ages! You seem to forget, but I am
,'" Draco whimpered. Harry pulled him to his side and Draco rested his head on his shoulder as they walked through the front doors.
Well that got her attention.
Soft, slightly chapped lips brushed against his and he could feel Harry's fast, heavy breathing ghosting against them. They kissed so sweetly, so gentle that Draco nearly came undone.
"Now, of course some of the hate will shift off of Draco and onto us but I dare anyone to try me." She raised her wand and smirked confidently.
"Incendio!" he whispered frantically.
The past couple of weeks had gifted Draco so many moments that brought him joy to think about, even if they did now come with a pang of sadness. He now possessed a whole reservoir of memories that he'd never dreamed imaginable: memories of times when he'd made Harry Potter smile, or laugh, or call his name... or cum... The thought of taking away the pure, innate affection that came with those thoughts seemed disturbingly like being emotionally obliviated.
Father wore an icy mask and mother plastered on a wan smile. Draco realized too late that she was staring at a spot just over his left shoulder. He turned and was met with Astoria smiling at him wryly with crossed arms.
"Nope, and they clearly haven't even shagged! They usually just exchange a few snarky remarks but, apparently, they've been like
He sighed and got up to herd his friends back in to finish packing.
Draco pushed him through the door and Harry's jaw hit the floor as he took in the large lounge complete with a plethora of comfortable looking lounge chairs and quaint little fireplaces, a fancy dining room and bar, and signs pointing to a spa. He sighed and then shook his head lovingly as the ridiculous man beside him smiled back at him, triumphantly.
"Of course we will. Now please get the bloody hell out of my sight, the lot of you, and go chase down some goddamn leads! Proudfoot, I want everything you've got on the latest 3 victims on my desk in the next hour," he commanded and his crew began to disperse, grumbling their theories about who pissed in this coffee that morning. He closed his eyes and removed his glasses to pinch the bridge of his nose. When he opened them, Stevens was still there.
"Mr. Potter." Harry looked up to see McGonagall smiling, too. "It is a beautiful thing to see inter-house unity. Oh, but I do believe you are about to be tardy for your meeting?"
"Erhm... No -- No, that's alright," Harry said, awkwardly, his blush reaching his ears. "This is actually going to sound quite strange, but we're searching for a girl... She's about this height, red hair, might've come through here on Monday through the... through the fireplace..." He finished lamely in anticipation of how bizarre that must sound to the muggle woman.
curse. Resistance to Interrogation Training: 101. In this moment, he remembered not the wretched pain, but the moment he'd welcomed it and accepted death; that this was the end. And he felt peace wash over him.
Harry looked pained for a second but then his face went blank again.
"But Sebastian still needs the wand and he's not going to give her to you unless you hand it over," she continued. "Why won't you just give it to him already and end this?!"
Draco rolled his eyes but gingerly placed his hand in Potter's, all the same. Potter examined the damage with a soft expression that Draco rarely saw. Hogwarts may have been long over but training had only amplified their competition in a different way. They were never quite as vile to each other anymore (he being a proper wizard who respected life-debts and Potter the annoying goody-two-shoes that he was) but, still, challenge always hung heavy in the air between them that was only fueled by the opposite and extreme expectations people had of them. As such, he was used to snarky, arrogant bastard Potter or smug, super Auror Potter. Now, the green-eyed man was being oddly gentle and it was... slightly unnerving...
" Draco shouted, again, and they were grateful for the silence that followed. "Crazy old bat!" He huffed before he threw a handful of floo powder into the hearth.
"Draco?!" he said again, hoping to rouse him as leaned over the undone, limp figure slumped over on the bathroom floor. He ran a hand through his hair, racked with guilt. "I'm so sorry! I never should have left you! Not even for a moment!"
Harry felt love and longing course through

and then
"Harry," the boy stressed again. He didn't know why this was making him feel so uncomfortable but he had to look away. "No, look at me," he insisted, reaching out and tilting his chin upward.
"All done, dear," she said after a minute or two. "Take it easy the rest of the day and rest up, you should be fine. Mr. Potter, I believe Headmistress McGonagall would like to see you in her office to try and understand just what happened this afternoon. Apparently your Ministry PR rep has already asked to floo in."
. There was a duel, some singed hair, quite a few tears, and a well-overdue talk involved, but, in summary: we're working on it."
"Draco, stay."
"Mr. Potter," beckoned a very guilt ridden Merrywhip as the class was dismissed. Ron and Hermione made to stick around but he nodded for them to go ahead without him. "My apologies, I didn't mean to put you on the spot..."
!" He geastured listlessly at Malfoy. "And, and -- You're not even a prefect!"
"They make me laugh and it's good quality stuff," he said, simply.
"What?!" Harry rolled his eyes. "Draco, it's got to be nearly half past 5 by now!"
Draco laughed but stopped when he noticed that Astoria looked hurt.
"And bring them back to us, alive." Ron reached for his hand and then, at the last minute, pulled him in for a half hug, clapping him heavily on the back.
"I would hope that means he has some grand knowledge that he hasn't yet shared with the rest of the class," the older wizard proposed.
"Harry..." Draco looked away and worried his lip.
at least
The simulation ended and the lights flickered on to reveal the disappointed faces of his spectating peers in the viewing gallery. Draco smiled smugly. They wore that look every time he didn't fail and he simply refused to give them the satisfaction. Instead, he tried to contain his excitement as he turned towards the giant magical timer that now shone green to indicate that he'd beaten his personal best: 5 minutes and 56 seconds flat on a simulation where the average time of completion was nearly 30!
"I can't dance, Draco," he insisted as the blonde pulled at his hand.
, cry me a fucking river."
Harry's eyes went wide with shock at the unexpected turn of conversation.
George laughed. "Leefred?? I'm pretty sure that's not how that works."
Potter gazed back at the old wand shop, mouth agape. "I have
"It's lovely," he breathed.
to talk to him."
Draco joined his side as he shakily untied the parchment from the owl's leg. Draco took his hand in his and Harry took a deep breath as he unfolded the note to find the now familiar handwriting:
"Woooow!" came three awestruck voices.
Draco rolled his eyes and ignored the question about his peculiar muggle wear to get straight to the point:
"I know what would cheer you up," Blaise said with a waggle of his thick, black eyebrows.
The sound of footsteps interrupted his thoughts and he was immediately on his feet, wand drawn and raised at the ready.
"You're brilliant, Draco!" Harry beamed as they easily navigated the pandemonium.
Harry paused. That was the first time anyone other than Hermione or Ron had thought to ask him how he was sleeping. He shook his head solemnly.
effect since he was already nervous. He eyed the candy again and, before he could even stop himself said:
Draco continued to stare solemnly for a long moment before he finally turned to meet Harry's gaze.
There was one of the whole Slytherin gang in the stands at the first task of the Triwizard competition, laughing and joking and sporting
"Well can you be one, just this once?" he smiled, imploringly. Alexandra had been a godsend to he and Blaise in her 4 years as their secretary. "Come on, Alex. I've seen you work with less in bigger time crunches!"
Draco hadn't been listening to a word they'd said since they had insisted that he join them to give his input on some asinine wedding detail that he couldn't care less about. He was too distracted.
"You mean true loves?" George corrected, pretending to swoon in his chair.
the less menacing.
Harry licked his lips, his mouth suddenly too dry as his hooded eyes dropped down to the curve of Draco's, long, elegant neck and he swallowed. He was so close... He could just lean over and...
I know I usually post later in the day on Wednesdays but I don't think I've ever been thirstier to post a chapter! Whew! I've been so excited to get you guys to this point in the story! I truly hope you enjoyed the chapter and thanks for rocking with the story all this time despite the fact that it took 10 chapters to get Harry and Draco in the same room together 😅
aren't doing anything. You've too much to lose." He looked pointedly at Rose who had long fallen asleep on Ron's chest.
There was so much pain behind his eyes and Draco wished he could take it away. It was all his fault that he'd experienced it in the first place!
special way, you want to kiss them. Like... When we see Bill and Fleur or Ron and Hermione kiss." Draco noted that she didn't include Harry and Ginevra in her example of model couples in love. "It doesn't really matter what gender the person is so long as that really special feeling is there."
"The summer before 6th year, Yaxley and Rowle paralyzed, kidnapped, then raped me in Knockturn Alley," he said a little stronger. He felt Hermione's grip tighten and he unconsciously leaned onto Draco who hesitated a moment and then wrapped an arm around his shoulder.
. His eyes sought out the picture of Draco. He'd promised himself to have this wrapped up before the wedding because the last thing he wanted to do was to start a family with a potential threat still looming over it. Even his subconscious wanted him to wrap this up if the fact that the bloody wanker,
"MY WORD!"
I've gone ahead and done the exact same thing!" he spat, frustrated. "But, right now, I couldn't give a fuck if she buggered all of Puddlemere United! JUST GET OUT THERE AND FUCKING FIND HER!" He pointed forcefully to the door.
"How darling," he responded dryly.
to talk about it... Andromeda would probably curse him to Hades if he flooed in and woke Teddy at this hour.
"Because Greg doesn't know what the bloody hell is going on and I'm pretty sure I have
"Well, since you reported the disappearance of the wood carving knife, the thief has since targeted Hector Fawley's pocket compass, Josephina Flint's enchanted amulet, and Doria Shafiq's golden quill."
"Because the head girl now thinks her best friend is about to get laid. Whether she likes breaking the rules or not, I can guarantee you she just sent out word to all the prefects and quidditch captains that the prefects bathroom is out of service for the next 3 hours." He smiled mischievously.
"It's just that I always assumed that you'd think this kind of work beneath you..."
Draco laughed and Potter frowned in distaste.
"Exactly," he smirked.
Harry's mouth dropped open. "Really?! Dean and Seamus?!"
"Are you saying that you want to skip the fancy smanchy place that's going to cost me an arm and a leg? To get cheesy chicken nachos, instead? Because I'm alright with that."
"Their vault room is near the cellar." He pointed a finger around the large, Victorian house. "The entrance to the cellar is on the other side. If you go in that way, I can meet you just outside to stake out the vault."
Blaise shook his head. "I don't see why they would, the inauguration was the first time I'd met either of them and we hadn't even conversed until Sunday's meeting so I hadn't even had a chance to offend them..."
He wanted to spend a lifetime with Harry and that would mean plenty of time for all that. For now, he was just glad to have him like this. This felt more intimate in some ways. Their teenage selves could have never!
"What, you think she'd poison you?" Harry asked, eying the tray of food sideways, too, just as relieved as Draco when nothing happened.
He'd barely made it off the stage before he was bombarded with handshakes and claps on the back and way too many
" Lee chuckled, remembering how ridiculously awkward that moment had been.
"By the time I got here, to Hogwarts... I was already so used to doing things on my own and taking care of others that I didn't want help. And if I'm being honest, I didn't think I was worth people's help. I've never minded taking on the dangerous stuff because if I die, it doesn't matter, it's no big deal."
"Draco, I'm not gay!"
the biggest Diva he knew).
"Mr. Malfoy," Headmistress Mcgonagall spoke. "It appears your contributions to this war and the precarious situations you've been placed in, much like your godfather," she glanced at Snape's portrait who returned a curt nod, "have been greatly understated."
Harry chuckled and then smiled sadly.
He winked at Draco who blushed and then shrugged at Harry's bemused look.
He was taken by surprise when enthusiastic little arms wrapped around his legs. Harry's heart warmed, as it always did, when he looked down to see the excited little face gazing up at him under a shock of electric blue hair. He crouched down to give Teddy a big squeeze of a hug before he scooped him up in his arms, his godson squirming in a fit of giggles.
glancing at Harry. Ron's voice snapped him back to attention.
"Thank you for that, Parvati. And no, Harry and I aren't dating. I wouldn't even call us friends... We're just not enemies anymore," he said, truthfully.
Draco shrugged.
Draco nodded. "Ginevra's floo record from Monday morning. When I read
kind but with just the right amount of bitchy when she needed to be, just like any good Slytherin. Sure he had been avoiding her lately because he didn't want to even think about how anyone expected the two of them to consummate this wedding or produce an heir, but, still, he would have expected her to find a way to tell him something
Draco groaned. "Salazar, I swear if Blaise doesn't come through that gate in the next hour with Ginny in tow to end all of this then I'm going to find him and kill him myself."
"So you don't think he wanted you to be a super villain?"
"They've got Jaan-et," she sung.
"I know, love," he said, sadly. "It wouldn't be fair to you. Which is why I thought you deserved a proper good-bye."
"Well I was pretty sure it wouldn't
"Harry... Think about what we've bonded over... Me witnessing your rape, the times we were almost killed, people dying -- no, being

Weasley cocked his head and looked at him thoughtfully, eyes still narrowed. "Malfoy, what really happened in those two weeks? You know, in that last year of training?"
were brave."
Draco rolled his eyes. "Well, he was starting from zero: his family was poor and hardly a significant presence in any wizarding community... He was successful in his craft but it was still inextricably tied to his former relationship, making his biggest claim to fame dating a now washed-up quidditch star..."
"Thanks, Stori," he said, distractedly kissing her on the cheek and taking off at a trot, disapparating as soon as he could.

at 6."
" Harry chanted as Davenport opened his mouth and the boy's wand flew towards him. "I think not. Listen to me," he said, wand still aimed at the now shaking, wandless 5th year. "I can talk to whom I please and I can handle myself. If I ever see you point your wand at another student unprovoked I'll not only hex you myself but I'll make sure you see detention for the rest of the year!"
He watched as Davenport ran off towards the Charms corridor. "What was

"What in the?" Astoria started. "Draco, is that a howler?"
She reached across the table to take his hand in hers and squeezed, tightly.
"I told you, already -- we'd had a row and she said she was staying with a friend."
Draco glared across the table. "Potter. What did you just
Draco's lids flew open!
he squeaked out in surprise when Harry, in a moment of pure, reckless abandon, captured his face with his own two hands as if he could kiss him!
Harry laughed. She was right, of course. It was like when Draco had told him that he'd found a

The whole tree glowed with a strange blue light and Draco felt a familiar tug, right below his navel.
He fixed Draco with piercing green eyes. Draco swallowed.
"Ha! In your dreams, Malfoy!" he laughed as he made to head to the drawing room to use the floo. He got all the way to the doorway before he remembered something and turned on his heels, bouncing to a stop.
"Yea! He's back there with a bloke who is going to make him forget all about you! And he's nicer, too!" her equally pissed counterpart said, pointing a thumb at the restroom.
--" He cleared his throat and made finger quotes. "'Sounded like a narcissistic prick for assuming that I alone can protect your feelings and there are already a shite load of people who have made life changing decisions on the behalf of Harry Potter without ever consulting Harry Potter and that
"Why else?" Harry captured his bottom lip and sucked, to the apparent delight of Draco's already half-hard cock. "Shall I count the ways?"
Yes, you heard that right: In the biggest plot twist since Wilda Griffiths' trade to Puddlemere United, Hogwarts' (former) resident Death Eater, Draco Malfoy, has taken on an unexpected role as an advocate of mental health. I sat down with the 18-year-old for a tell-all interview right before today's official ribbon cutting ceremony. Dressed in his finest dress robes, the charmingly handsome young man talked candidly about his personal mission of healing trauma post war.
"Harold," he corrected anyways.
His eyes widened when he finally caught on to what she was asking. "I'm not gay! Merlin, Hermione! What has Ginny been telling you?!" he asked, angrily. Sure the intimacy between them had been none existent for ages but did that mean she was going around telling people he was
His eyes narrowed. He was just about to ask what in the bloody hell that was with Zabini when a photographer interrupted.
Harry's eyebrows shot up in surprise. "Wow, never thought I'd hear you say
It made sense to me that, based off of what we've seen thus far, the boys might thrive with some dom/sub play where there is a lot of emotional reassurance and validation. Already having hints that Draco dabbled as a dom in his relationships in the past (the bossy Slytherin who knows what he wants when it comes to sex and all), but I liked the idea of this being something sweeter with Harry that could take away his need to get all in his head about caring/feeling too much or fears of doing things wrong and being unlovable/making loved ones leave him because he got it wrong.
"Yea, yea," said Seamus, who came over and kissed Dean on the cheek. "That's all great but did you see the House Points? McGonagall decided to award this git here 50 points and now Slytherin is in the lead! Something about knowing when to step in and help a fellow student in crisis despite house lines, defying expectations or some rubbish like that," he said teasingly through a big smile. He leaned in so that only the two of them would hear him. "And thanks for giving Dean and I the courage to finally come out. We've gotten nothing but support so far and you two definitely have ours." Harry smiled brightly and turned to see that Draco looked genuinely touched.
"I don't know, but I know who we need to ask!" he said, standing and gathering his things.
"Draco's about to have a wank and would like to not be disturbed!" she announced loudly to the rest of his mates on her way out and he couldn't help but laugh. He looked at all the stuff still waiting to be packed and decided he'd have to come back to that one when he really did have the time to enjoy a good wank.

Harry barreled down the stairs and threw open the main door only to find Draco Malfoy, in full wizard's robes, standing in the middle of his bustling residential street surrounded by a gaggle of school-aged girls!
Harry sighed. He didn't know where he and Malfoy stood. So much had happened in these past 2 years, some of it horrible, some of it painful, and half of it they seemed to have an unspoken rule to just not talk about. On "
Draco blinked back at him and the furniture stopped shaking as his rage dissipated.
Blaise gave him a pointed glare before he continued.
! He may not be the fastest or hardest-working Auror in the unit, but you didn't need to be when you had what Jansen had: Pure, infallible, natural-born instinct.
"Malfoy, no. There's no way I'm letting you go in there alone and wandless when we don't know if this thief is going to be there or whether or not they're dangerous."
"You know that I--" He glanced briefly to where Harry stood, off to the side, and swallowed dryly. "Love Potter, right?"
"Hold off, Yaxley! Don't press it yet!" Harry couldn't turn his head to look but he imagined Yaxley's hand hovering over the Dark Mark. He could almost hear the smirk in Rowle's voice as he continued. "Let's have a little fun first!"
"Oh, yes," Ginny nodded her agreement. "You should see--"
Harry blushed harder when an involuntary moan escaped his lips, causing Draco to smirk and direct a raised brow in his direction.

Hermione lifted her head to look up at his profile and then bit her lip in thought before speaking.
to placed the offending basket of food in front of his face.
"Nice work, Malfoy, but you're still not as fast as Potter," Head Auror Robards said, smugly, as his quill scribbled something into his floating, dragon-hide bound notebook.
He and Stori had been doing a well-enough job at coexisting in their New York condo. He'd been working a lot with MACUSA and she had found purpose in volunteering at a shelter for magical beasts. They encouraged each other as they faced the challenges of culture shock and finding their own way, and, it didn't hurt that they could out-snark each other -- which made for fun banter. In all, they made the best of roommates. As lovers, though...
He'd barely made it two steps into the large kitchen before he was forced to stop dead in his tracks at the most glorious scene he'd ever laid eyes upon: There, before him, stood Draco with his back to him, long blonde hair braided in that perfect fishtail and miles upon miles of alabaster skin and lean, taut muscles on full display. Harry's mouth dropped as he watched Draco skillfully use his wand to stir one pot while he tasted from another with a wooden spoon.
"I did
being masochistic, my father thinks it's a stupid and banal occupation, my darling future in-laws are terrified that I won't be able to provide my betrothed with the life they expected on an Auror's salary --" For some reason, Potter's eyes widened and he blinked, gobsmacked, at this bit of information. "--and Robards has been determined to make this hell for me from the start. I stopped knowing whether or not this is what I truly want to do or just a pipe dream that I refuse to give up on almost a month or so in."
Harry grabbed his jar full of porcupine quills and shook it side to side. "No, no -- you have to do it harder than that. Try doing it up and down and faster like you're.... Nevermind." He stopped himself but smiled mischievously.
"AARGHHH!" he cried out in anguish, his fist connecting hard and quick with the cool, glassy face of the blonde bastard staring back it him.
"You just couldn't follow directions, could you?" Harry asked, wryly. "I told you

She smirked wryly.
of all things, like some lovesick teenage schoolgirl. He was still mortified by his reaction to Wednesday's...
There were gasps all around the hill and Harry found himself breathless as he beheld the man fated to be his forever partner.
there's nothing you can say to make me come home." Draco laid back, kicked up his feet, and summoned the bottle of French wine that Pansy had just sent him from Paris.
Malfoy frowned. "Who cares what everyone else wants? You're finally free to live your life for you, why are you so afraid to do it?" Harry stared into his tea. He didn't know how to tell him that he'd lived a life where he was unloved and unwanted before and that he feared that loneliness more than anything.
"We have to move, the Polyjuice is already wearing off," the man said as he stepped over Robards' form, stopping to grab the fallen wand and thrusting it into Harry's hand.
Sebastian gave him a wry smile.
