A look of panic suddenly made itself known and Harry knew that look all-too-well, but he wouldn't let on that he knew what happened, not until Draco wanted to talk about it. He knew from experience that being forced to talk about something when someone wasn't ready could destroy them.
. Harry wasn’t listening. He didn’t want to. He just wanted this to be over and wasn’t paying attention, which is why he missed the fact that everyone had been staring at him for half a minute. The brunette blinked, frowning as he realized he was the center of attention for some reason. It took him a few seconds to realize that the yellow, translucent, glittery veils erupting from the officiate’s wand had wrapped around Ginny, but had halted halfway between the couple, refusing to wrap itself around Harry and bond them.
Harry finally gets a glimpse into what it's like to be Draco and he doesn't like it one bit.
Older draco felt Harry's heart clench at the statement and all anger and vengefullness left his mind. He was only sympathetic and curious now.
"Mister Malfoy... Woken up… Discharged... Didn't know you were here...he seems fine."
1) Chapters 8,9, and 10 have changed completely. I'd suggest reading them before reading this chapter so you won't get lost. Enjoy!
Don't own any of the characters. Rowling does. Enjoy!
Harry’s heart stopped at those words. He hadn't heard them, but, from the guy's lip movement and Draco's face going pale, the brunette was sure that the guy had said these words. He didn’t know when he had gotten up and marched over to the guy's table, but he was there and the guy was looking at him, wide-eyed.
Jashua is not gone from the story btw...
The periods of time missing from his head.
"Y-you know what, H-Harry? Fuck you! You have N-no idea how hard it is f-for m-me. The th-thought of losing you… It Keeps me awake almost every night. You- danger always follows you around, Harry! You can't deny it. And-and it only got worse during the summer because I just-I knew. I could tell something was wrong and I was powerless to stop it and then you show up h-here looking l-like you've been starved and I've had nightmares about finding you dead or hearing about it. It's awful. And-and then you come here and laugh at m-me and s-say I am overreacting. I-I am not crazy, Harry! I am just someone who l-loves you and would rather kill themselves then see you get h-hurt!"
"Could you cover for me, today? I hate to ask but all of this information-" he started, but Ron was already nodding with that same sad smile. Moments and many hugs later, he was gone and Harry apparated directly into the alley behind the hospital.
"Are you really sure you want to see me again, Harry? This isn't some kind of phase. I don't want you to save me. I will always think the way I do and I will always go back to Jashua. Are you prepared to accept that?"
Of course, that's what made Draco's Monday even worse the second time he ran into Harry. He caused a scene. Jashua hated scenes. He held his breathe as Harry left, hoping Jashua hadn't noticed, but of course he had. Everyone in the market heard the yelling and the clattering of items falling off the shelf. He apparated them home and shoved Draco through the door. The blonde braced himself for the hit, instead Jashua went very quiet. It was part of his torture. Leaving Draco hanging and on edge for long, never knowing when he'd snap. Draco often found himself wishing he would hit him all the time instead of making him wait.
As soon as the blonde handed his potential new boss an application, though, the guy waved him off.
Although the blonde, by all appearances, seemed fine, Harry couldn't, for the life of him, stifle his worry. He had never pulled at his hair as much as he had during these three days while he was desperately waiting for Wednesday to arrive so the blonde would just bloody hell eat something.
So Harry had to begrudgingly tell his best mate everything and wait for the inevitable explosion.
He knew he couldn't speak to Draco when he saw him on the train, and he wasn't even expecting the blonde to acknowledge his existence in public, as much as it pained them both. But... The way that Draco had looked at him - like he was in pain over seeing Harry - told the brunette he had been caught. Draco had that look in his eyes, the 'I need to take care of you now' look, but it was mixed with a fury Harry had never seen Draco show before.
Draco hated himself even more than he had in years when he saw Harry give a slight nod of understanding then ordered two meals and coffees. He looked back at Draco with a forced smile, which turned into a sad one as he started to speak.
"So, you did love me back then?"
After Draco stepped into the light, Harry spared no second in grabbing his hand and apparating them both straight onto the couch, where they were greeted by Scruffie who started to lick Draco's wounds? Harry gasped.
Jashua took a deep breath, then looked his lover in the eye and said "of course not, darling, I love you and will always be honest with you, which is why I am telling you that I fear I might grow to feel that way if you don't get better soon."
"But you aren't! And we can be lovers again! Who said I don't like you? " Harry yelled back. He wasn't sure why. He felt like  if he shouted it loudly enough, Draco would finally get it through that thick head of his.
So, he really hated what he had to do once they finally arrived at the coffeeshop. Harry let go of his hand and held open the door for him, only to frown deeply when Draco made no move to get in.
Realization seemed to dawn on Draco's face and he cleared his throat then nodded slowly.
"H-Harry?" he asked breathlessly. And, for a moment, Harry thought there was hope after all, despite the shaking of his Draco's entire body and his sad expression. But the blonde seemed to collect himself, showing no more emotions as his signature sneer masked his expression.
"Perhaps the disease is making it seem worse, mate. You're a kind person. It kills you to see him suffer so you make him out to be an important person when he wasn't. Else Hermione and I would've at least heard about him. Don't you think?"
“It’s more than that, Draco. I am beginning to-” the brunette started. Draco blurted out the first thing he could think of, not wanting Harry to finish that sentence. He knew what the brunette would say, and he didn’t want to hear it. He had made his choice, and Harry returning his feelings wouldn’t change his mind.
"I knew you would. Of course you would recognize the wand of the man you were cheating on me with."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"negative" he informed Draco, who immediately burst into tears. Harry wanted to comfort him, but any attempt to get close to his body was rebuffed. Harry wanted to kill Jashua. Then, a terrifying thought occured to him.
"I've already made Jashua that promise" the blonde said quietly, and Harry instantly let go of both his hands and moved away from him to the other end of the couch, his eyes never leaving Draco's.
"Y-you said you h-hated me. That I r-ruined you. Y-you c-called me insuf-insufferable." with that, Draco burst into tears. Harry moved to comfort him, but Draco pulled away and held onto Scruffie for dear life.
“A curse was thrown at Ron, and Harry tried to push him out of the way, but- it hit Harry, instead,” she said, then added softly, “He’s going to wake up soon. This is just how the body deals with pain at first. They’ve given him the antidote, so he’ll wake up when his body feels well enough.”
“We should probably get to work.”
Frantic and hating himself, Harry accessed the locator spell only to realize he had undone every spell he had ever cast on the blonde with his finite earlier.
"I don't believe you." Draco grit out. "You've proved you loved me two years ago. But that doesn't suddenly mean I trust you now. You could still only be doing this to save me."
"M-money. Fifty galleons. And I N-need to get to knockturn alley and back home without being seen. M'not a-allowed in the Wizarding world anymore, remember?"
No name.
Harry tossed the vial under the bed after the blonde nodded.
"You aren't going anywhere until you eat SOMETHING, Malfoy." Harry hissed through his teeth and Draco flinched at the name, then looked up at Harry wide-eyed, looking panicked.
"What are you talking about?"
"notebook!"
1) Don't own any of the characters. Rowling does.
Jashua threw a wooden wand on the floor in front of Draco and the blonde immediately looked towards the sound and gasped. It was.. It was...
"No. It's me."
Draco turned around, his silver eyes meeting Harry’s green ones. He tilted his head in confusion.
“Harry, I don’t know who or what you’re talking about and why you’re this upset, but if you tell me, I promise I’ll do everything in my power to make it alright again.” Draco murmured softly after Harry stopped crying.
"I can't, Harry." and Harry felt guilty yet again, but he knew this was important. He knew if he didn't say the right thing now, if would be over, so he cast that's blasted spell again and was immediately conflicted and in pain.
He awakened sometime later to find himself embraced by the blonde, who was murmuring "Please no. Please no. Please no."
Suddenly, something cool pressed to Draco's lips and he shivered but swallowed, not knowing what else to do and not caring about the outcome. Moments later, the pain was almost completely gone and he felt very fuzzy, only then did he notice that Harry was still pacing frantically around the living room pulling at his hair and speaking very quickly.
"I-I was upset. I didn't-"
"But I confuse things... I remember things wrong and then I find out that they were right but that can't be right because right was wrong and wrong was normal and... I am not making any sense, am I?" he finished bitterly. Harry shook his head and, for a moment, Draco looked crushed, but then Harry took his free hand and looked him in the eyes.
"You can heal me, but please, no more talk of murder." the blonde whispered, then added quickly, "Can I wash myself, First?"
Before the blonde could say anything, a patronus came into the room.
"Snap out of it, Draco!" he screamed, "I never sent you any bad letters. They were all filled with words describing our time together. I wanted to find you. I wanted to meet up and perhaps take things further. I was worried. I-I loved you. I never said anything bad to you. Ever! And if these letters hurt you, then rest assured they were not from me just as your responses were apparently not from you!"
Without even realizing it, Harry was asking him all those questions, unable to hold back. The blonde  bursts into tears once more and hides his face in his hands, shivering all over. Harry's heart breaks at the sight.
"I haven't been able to eat one of those without you having the other half. Care to indulge me?" he asked, desperately hoping Draco doesn't interpret it as a pity offering.
"no. He did. I know he did." he had said frantically, trying to summon images of their happy times together, only to come up with the hateful words of Harry's letters.
It was easy afterwards. Not to forget what he saw, but to reassure himself that their encounter wouldn't be the last one. Harry used the spell to track Draco to his home, but he didn't follow. No that would be too creepy. He merely waited two weeks, barely focusing on his auror work, but thankfully having Ron there to cover for him. He finally figured it out: Draco visited the market every Monday. And, surely enough, he was there the third week, in the same aisle, looking deathly pale.
“No. It wasn’t!”
“Yes, Mr. Potter,” the officiate said calmly.
"Perhaps, then, my parents would've been alive. I am not blaming you, though. You're too kind and you've wasted your time with me. I can never repay you. Anything that has happened since then was all my fault. It's all my fault."
Only, then did Harry notice one of the food boxes was gift-wrapped. It had a note that said 'Harry Birthday, Harry. I wish one day I'll be able to be there to celebrate with you.'
He nodded slowly and Harry exhaled with relief.
The day went smoothly after that, with Harry sending calming thoughts and emotions through their link as Draco silently approached customers and quietly asked what they wanted to have. The blonde hoped that his exhaustion wasn’t apparent by the end of the day. He couldn’t believe he had actually made it through the 4-hour shift without collapsing. His feet were killing him and he felt faint, but he smiled at the brunette nonetheless, telling him they could go now.
Harry thoughts were cut off by the sound of the floo coming alive. He immediately went downstairs to check if Jashua somehow found out and had come to show Harry a piece of his mind. If that were the case, Harry wouldn't let the man leave his home in one piece.
Draco's own version of the memories weren't as bad as Harry thought they would be. They weren't exactly a hundred percent happy. Draco had been insecure and on edge the entire time, worrying that Harry would leave him and find someone more worthy of Harry's love. But, at least, he believed Harry loved him and he loved Harry back. That was something. It was everything.
Draco smiled, tracing the words with his fingertips. His Harry was so kind to him. It hurt to think about his own dishonesty to Harry now. He continued to read the entries he, himself, had written, his chest clenching painfully at the memories of them and their past selves' future plans that certain enteries brought up.
Harry looked back at him with a smile and continued to drag him away, meeting no resistance from Draco. Draco could only catch a few words of what Harry was saying, too lost in the feel of his hand and his wonderful smile. It felt like… home.
"of course we can see him." he had said slowly, "you could even see him alone if you want. Closure is important."
"No. P-please. P-please, stay with me. Please. W-what, what can I do? P-please tell me what to do to make it stop. P-please tell me! Tell me, draco!"
"Nothing's wrong." the blonde said, shrugging.
Draco didn't need to wonder or worry for too long, though. A few minutes after he got home, Harry was knocking his door down. The blonde's heart broke when he saw the brunette. His mate’s face was almost red with fury, but the look he cast at Draco was the saddest one the blonde had ever seen.
"so y-you were bluffing yesterday?" he asked softly, that hopeful speck making its way back to his eyes.
Something darkened in Malfoy’s grey eyes as they flicked over to where the camera was then back to Harry’s face. The blonde sighed and started speaking slowly.
But they wouldn't stop. Harry had been listening to Draco's thoughts for two hours on end. At first he was curious, then worried, and that worry started to escalate into horrifying realizations. Draco had felt this horrible even when they were together. And Harry had thought his need for reassurance was cute? Draco's attitude was destructive and Harry hadn't done anything to help, even though now, 6 years after third year, he still had no idea what to do.
"Alright, Draco, I'll fix it." Harry said, deflated, then quickly cast a reparo on the letter, which Draco instantly folded and shoved down his trousers' pocket, clearly afraid that Harry would change his mind, then he opened his mouth and started to chew the cookie slowly.
Draco sighed. He didn’t want to explain to his cute, innocent best friend why life just didn’t work like that. Then he really thought about Emmyl’s words. He didn’t want to invade his mate’s privacy, but Harry was just so devastated. Draco didn’t want to see him that upset ever again! It was his job to make his mate feel better, after all… Seeing Harry happy again was also a huge upside.
"Sorry, I was just looking for the loo." he said lamely, not able to come up with a better excuse at the sight of Harry's ruffled hair and wide eyes, no longer hidden behind large glasses.
As the end of the game neared and Harry and Draco were flying side by side, chasing the snitch, Harry could tell Draco's resolve was wavering. The blonde was swaying on his broom and seemed about ready to collapse. But, he was, indeed, faster by all accounts. With a surge of what Harry could only describe as superhuman strength, Draco flew past him in an instant and his hand gently grasped the snitch, but as the announcement made itself known that Slytherin had won, the blonde promptly fell off his broom with a smile. Harry didn't think twice. He raced towards the falling blonde, cursing himself for letting this happen, and, before Draco hit the ground, grabbed him hurriedly, then slowed down enough to lower the both of them to the field.
He didn't plan on showing himself to Harry, ever, but what else could he do when he found Harry wandering to Jashua's neighborhood?
Harry closed his eyes and huffed, knowing exactly what was coming next.
"Don't worry Draco. I'm alive." Harry told him, leaving out the 'and you need to be too' hoping Draco would never mention suicide again.
It took Draco a while to stop crying into the plate, especially because Harry didn't comfort him. Draco wasn't used to that. Harry always comforted him when he was upset, no matter what.
Only then did Harry hear quiet sobs from regulus's old room. He checked to find that there was no one in sight, so he bit his cheek and layed down on his stomach next to the bed, only to see a small bundle at end. Draco was huddled into a ball in the corner, knees drawn to his chest and crying his eyes out, clutching something for dear life.
"yes." he cries, his jaw still sore from yesterday's punch. At least it was glamoured thanks to Jashua.
"I cried when I thought you died. It was worst day of m'life. We werent togetha bu I still love you."
"I am not trying to bum you out, Harry, but that ward and those people were just... I don't want you to get too attached. Bill was crushed. I don't want anything bad happening to you. You've seen enough death as it is."
"Of course, Draco. Nothing will happen to me. Don't worry about it. I'll be as careful as I can." he whispered soothingly.
"I have no choice. Even if I did, I know I'd be a terrible father. Perhaps my ability to conceive was wrongly given to me. This will make things right. I was never meant to be a family man or anything really."
Draco looked like he was about to burst into tears, so Harry did the only thing he could think of. He grabbed a handful of mashed potatoes and threw it at his face. Scruffie immediately jumped up and began licking it off the blonde, who looked furious at Harry, yet entertained by Scruffie's happiness.
"I-I apologize, potter. It seems the situation behind me taking that substance really has been taking a toll on me. I was trying to act casually, but I believe I failured miserably."
“Perhaps we should discuss this privately,” the officiate said quietly, gesturing towards the hundreds of guests who were intent on listening in on the conversation.
"H-harry?" he asked quietly, but Harry had heard him and turned around, almost hopeful for something, and not knowing what.
"Are you alright?" he asks. His voice is almost kind and sincere, but Draco knows it's all a lie.
"Everything is fine now, though." he said softly, trying to coax Harry into calmly down. He didn't know what set him off until Harry spoke through sobs.
Harry frowned at how upset Draco had gotten all of the sudden.
"You would've talked me out of it." was all he said.
"tell me, draco. What did you do after receiving his first owl? What did Harry make you do?"
But, despite his good thoughts, every fiber of Draco was screaming for Harry not to leave him. He could feel his chest constricting and his throat closing up. No. He couldn't cry right now. He couldn't be comforted by Harry. Harry needed to leave. All of this disappeared the moment he heard Harry's next statement.
Before Harry could approach him, Pomfrey returned and tried to wake him with a spell. The blonde's body twitched and the witch sighed, looking defeated. Just then, the older Malfoy entered the wing and Harry had to bite his tongue so he wouldn't start screaming at Draco's father for doing this to his son.
The blonde instantly recoiled at Harry's soft tone, looked contemplatingly at him for a split second then took off, leaving behind his groceries and exiting the supermarket all together.
All throughout the memories one thing remained clear: Harry never pitied draco. He truly loved him. He didn't want to save draco. He wanted him. Draco had even consoled Harry as many times as Harry comforted him.
"He did everything, wrong, Draco! Starting with making me share what's mine!" Jashua yelled back, then grinned darkly, "Besides, love, don't you remember what your death eater scum of a father used to say? When a man is disarmed.."
“I’ll go look. If I don’t find them, whoever they are, within ten minutes, I’ll send a patronus back to Robards telling him to bring over a team.” the red-head said firmly, giving the blonde a look. Draco sighed in relief. Ron was giving him ten minutes with the brunette. It wasn’t much, but it was better than nothing.
He wasn't a burden anymore. He had his vault money. Harry was right. He understood that what was taken from him wasn't supposed to be. He knew of the Black's finances. Half the vault would keep him going forever. He was finally enough for Harry and for himself… for now. The rest, he could figure out later.
"H-how is it f-fine when you could've d-died?" he chokes out, then mumbles "when you w-would've l-left me."
"Knock it off, mate! I am serious."
Harry took a shaking breathe, snapping draco out of his thoughts, and looked frantic for a moment before more tears filled his eyes.
Harry concerntrated in draco's eyes, willing yet another spell to work. He was shit at Legilimency, but his Auror training had taught him enough to do the reversal, to make the person in front of him see his mind, his memories and all the emotions associated with them.
Harry's chest clenched again and he longed to hold onto Draco, but he stayed put.
"Give it up, Draco. I know something is wrong. Why else would you be hiding out here?"
I don't own the characters. Rowling does. Enjoy!
"Do you think I am a horrible person for killing my child?"
“Our job isn’t just ours. It’s everybody’s. It’s everyone’s job to report the bad guys and if they don’t, we’ll just stay in our offices twiddling our thumbs while the bad guys keep wronging more and more people and these people won’t report it, either. Pretty soon, the whole wizarding world will just be one big lawless, dangerous battlefield. And, I hate to say it, mate, but it would be the fault of the people who didn’t report the bad guys in the first place. Do you get what I am saying?” the red-head finished softly, but his words cut through Harry like pieces of glass.
Now, both dracos felt ashamed for entirely different reasons.
It didn't matter, though, because everything had changed when his name was called out for the tournament. He subtly threw a glance over to the slytherin table to see how the blonde felt about the whole ordeal, but Draco had stormed off, leaving all the other slytherins whispering about him.
"Don't lie to me!" he yelled.
It was just like the old days, but somehow even better, even if Draco felt a bit worthless at times, Harry was so quick to list the ways he helped the brunette and, before him, others. He had went so far as to remind him of the good deeds he had done during the war. Draco trusted Harry and wasn't afraid to be betrayed. But then, the inevitable happened. Draco came back from his sixth meeting with Harry to find Jashua waiting for him in the dark siting room. Draco jumped when he heard the man get up and didn't have time to prepare before Jashua invaded his memories.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Oh yeah?" he yelled across the aisle, not paying attention to other customers' looks. "So you can blow me off and I wouldn't have a way to contact you? If you don't want to see me you can just..."
Harry sighed, knowing Ron wouldn't leave without an explanation.
"I thought you were going to throw it away." he says quietly, "I didn't know you were still hungry."
"Alright. Thank you for sharing." Harry said quickly, not caring how lame his statement was. He had a name. This was a thing. Other people had it as well and it was known. Harry only hoped it was curable. In one eye swipe, Harry found 5 books on the illness and proceeded to purchase all of them, then went back to Draco, who was still seated in the exact same place.
"you have to-"
The final scene was a day after the bathroom incident. Draco had been under an imperio and woke up not remembering what had happened, only to have Harry approach him on the astronomy tower at night. Upon seeing his face, Draco was ready to apologize and tell him everything and beg for his love and forgiveness.
After the dog was finished he lunged at Harry. For a second, the brunette was afraid scruffie would attack him, but the dog simply pinned Harry to the floor and started to lick his face. Harry had planned to come by to feed the dog daily, but upon playing with him and petting this lovely creature, Harry didn't have the heart to leave him, so he left a note with his muggle phone number, saying he was a friend of someone who was in the ward and had overheard her while visiting. With a twist, he apparated with the dog to his home and unleashed him to check out the house.
"Thank you again, Harry. You've reminded me of what it was like to be loved without hurting because of it. Although I don't think I'll have that kind of love again, it is nice to know it exists, that I had it once. I'll miss you terribly, but I am afraid our time is up."
. He came up blank. So, he went to bed and settled himself in for another night of restless sleep.
The blonde’s features softened again as Harry’s hands squeezed his. The brunette furrowed his eyebrows in confusion. Does touching him lessen the pain somehow or was it something else that made Draco’s...episode go away?
"You're not though-"
Harry looked at him incredulously for a second, then the widest of all smiles plastered on his face. Draco thought he would say or do anything to keep Harry smiling like that.
“I don’t have all day here! Hurry up!” the guy shouted. Harry gritted his teeth.
1) Chapters 8 and 9 have been completely changed, so I'd suggest to go back and read them so you won't be lost.
Upon thinking of the older Malfoy, Harry's anger only became more well-known. Suddenly, he felt no positive emotions whatsoever towards this self-destructive, selfish Draco, who made Harry watch as he almost died of starvation or a fall from a very, very high drop.
"Of course you can, but you've never liked it before... I had to force you to go with me many times when we were in hogwarts. Let me pick another one."
"I really miss your cooking and baking." he said with a certain longing in his voice, "I remember that your cookies used to make me feel better no matter how bad of a day I would have. I wish I had them during the last six weeks. And the three years before that when I half thought you were dead."
"I felt so bad..but you were... And I... I didnt know it would lead to that!"
Harry wouldn't let up. Draco knew this. He loved it and he loved Harry. And he hated himself for loving it and loving Harry.
. If I knew you could cook like that, I would’ve given you my wand ages ago. Merlin, I feel like I’m in food heaven. You spoil me too much.”
“Is everything alright?” He heard the brunette ask. Draco’s head snapped up and he looked around. They were in the alley. Harry had already apparated them to the muggle world and Draco hadn’t even noticed it. The blonde wanted to kick himself for not paying attention to Harry. The veela business would have to wait. He had an amazing second date to get to.
The witch placed a tentative hand on Harry's knee, then sighed and soothingly said "This is a self-induced coma with no apparent causes. It's a medical mystery until I can find out the reason he is in this state. As such, it is hard to say."
"M-make it stop. Make it stop!" he screamed.
"Yeah.." he started, "Everyone I met during these two years pressured me to just be normal. It's clear you're not comfortable with me like this, but you let me be. I really appreciate that."
Harry frowned deeply at her words. Was that supposed to make him feel better? Knowing that his sweet, kind, thoughtful partner has been in so much pain for such a long time that his body just got used to it? He was sure the blonde was still suffering and that caused Harry’s chest to clench.
"Draco, none of that was me. I swear it!" Harry said, starting to pull at his hair at awkward angles.
"do you Jashua?" he had asked him, dreading the answer, "do you feel obligated, too?"
Draco’s body was shaking a bit; he was hating the attention this guy was drawing to the blonde with the loudness of his voice.
"Or there is the more simple explanation that there is nothing wrong with the boy and that the game has taken a lot out of him. He's been training at the manor on weekends, as I requested from the headmaster and this has often occurred. He sometimes does not wake up for days. There is nothing more to it. Healers have confirmed that it is a result of stress on his body. The boy is just weak."
Harry glared at his best friend, even though Ron was fast asleep. Did he know how much his rejection had hurt this person? Did he even care? Why was everyone treating this sweet child like that? Surely, he couldn't be that horrible? He hadn't even done anything wrong!
“Mate,” Ron said firmly, “we’re Aurors. Our job is to catch bad guys like the Dursleys and make them pay so they, and everyone else who thinks to act like them, would know that they won’t get away with it.”
Instantly, Harry cast a windgardian leviosa on a box of tissues and was intended on levitating it to Draco, who shrunk back at the thought of anything entering his safe space.
Feelings erupted off of Harry and onto the older Draco, who was still watching the scene with confusion. Harry was angry and vengeful, but he was also.... Concerned?
"It's alright" he said, relasing draco, then stepping closer to the chamber's enterance and holding out a hand, "Don't be afraid. Come with me. I'll protect you."
You could just stay here now. You could stay here forever if you want to. I don't want you hurt and I don't want you around anyone or anything that will make you feel bad. I am serious. I like your company and I would like it if you stay. You know, if you want to. But I repsext your wishes and your boundaries nonetheless and I won't seek you out if you don't want me to. Just please tell me you want me to be a part of your life. Please!"
understand. The brunette simply grabbed his wand, sent his friend an apologetic look, and apparated out of the house, already thinking up ways to apologize to the red-head when he next sees him. He wound up in a muggle bar, not wanting to go anywhere where he might be recognized as ‘the great Harry Potter’, and started downing shots.
(See the end of the chapter for
At that suggestion, however, Draco seemed to pull away further.
" what did you just say?" younger draco whispered, looking at the sinks curiously.
The whole event couldn't have lasted more than a few seconds, but the memory was instilled in Harry and, upon remembering how Draco looked, Harry had the horrible thought that the blonde, indeed, would die today, away from Harry and it would be Harry's fault for not forcing his hand.
"M'broken. can't even give you this. Can't give you anything."
"I meant leave the room, potter, not the house. I am a Malfoy and I honor my word."
Draco simply stared at him. Harry flinched. He had forgotten for a second that none of those things would happen, not while Draco was like this. He shook his head and took the blonde to a mall anyways, regretting it as soon as they entered the place and draco made a beeline for the 'husband chair' in the corner. Harry sighed and they left shortly after. The day couldn't have gone any worse, but then it did. It was almost 9 pm when they returned and Harry groaned at the thought that he would have to force Draco to eat something. Before he could open his mouth, though, the blonde turned to look at him with a genuine smile.
Her insinuation was clear and Harry understood, then, why it seemed like she hadn't given Draco any kind of treatment. Lucius had cast spells on his son to ensure his 'injuries' would not be detected, hiding the blonde's weight problem in the process. Another horrible thought went through Harry's mind.
First: don't own any of the characters. Rowling does.
"No!" Draco screamed so loudly it hurt harry's ears. "No one else."
"What if I find a way to block your memories to anyone but yourself?" Harry asked him, finally causing Draco to look up.
Harry shook his head quickly, with only two words playing in his head.
“Honestly, Harry. Do you really think I could figure out what’s wrong with him in a single second and cure him before he goes home for the day?” she asked in an indignant voice.
“Yes, go ask. While you’re at it, you might want to get a job that you actually have the skills for!”
Harry's heart clenched. Everything suddenly started to make sense. The beliefs. The writer's friends. The fact that Ron never mentioned him. The owner of the journal was Malfoy. He couldn't stop reading. He had to know Malfoy's perspective, how deep Harry had hurt him.
The witch narrowed her eyes at him but gave no other indication of having heard him.
" we..." he whispered, not even realizing he had spoken. Draco suddenly jumped as of he had forgotten Harry was there altogether.
"I was sincere earlier when I- when I said you could talk to me. So, would you like to tell me what's wrong? No more yelling. No more apologies. I promise."
"do you want to send a letter to your boyfriend to let him know you're alright?" he asked, trying to sound causal. But draco immediately stiffened.
The brunettes eyes were wide and pleading and all anger seemed to have left him entirely. His sudden change of mood made Draco not notice his suspiciously on-point words.
"Draco, it's not that. I just think you're cute when you overreact." Harry said hoping the blonde would blush at the compliment then move on. Draco wasn't having it.
"Draco?" Harry shouted at his back. The blonde turned and looked at him, frightened. Harry sighed.
"Ghosts can't move things, Draco." myrtle told him slowly as if speaking with a child, then let out a small sob at the reminder of her limited capabilities.
"Thank you." he heard the blonde whisper as he put away his empty plate and moved to take Harry's only to pause, horrified, at the still full plate in front of the brunette. He looked like he was about to apologize, so Harry quickly started stuffing his face and pretending to like it until, minutes later, everything was gone.
Harry was snapped out of his thoughts by the screams that tore through Draco's throat. There was tears constantly flowing down his cheek and he was utter loud piercing cries, but Jashua didn't stop pounding into him. Only then did Harry remember that he didn't have permission to see this and that he was powerless to stop it, that all he could do was stand by, listen, and watch as his sobbing ex-lover got pregnant against his will.
"If you're done asking me ridiculous questions, I'd like to take a bath now." he says then winces at his own words. That does it for Harry. He didn't ask Draco to stay so he can tip-toe around him. He's getting answers one way or another. And if Draco won't talk, Harry has a spell that will make him.
Then it hit him.
“Would you mind explaining what just happened?” he hissed, feeling bad about taking it out on the poor officiate but not wanting any more drama to come his way. He had had enough of that for a lifetime with the prophet publishing false ‘facts’ about literally every phase of his life.
"M'sorry"
“What did he say exactly, Harry?” Hermione asked for what seemed to be the hundredth time as Harry paced around Ron’s office.
By the end of his rambling session, Harry was pulling at his hair violently. Again. Draco had no idea what to say. Everything Harry just mentioned was true, but how would he even begin to answer the questions Harry had.
Harry stared at Malfoy for a while, mouth agape, unable to decipher if what the blonde was saying was true or not.
The blonde's words didn't hurt Harry, not in the way Draco intended. Harry knew his Draco only turned to insults when he felt completely vulnerable and hopeless. But he hadn't resorted to it with Harry since that day in the bathroom and the realization of what a major stepback had occured dawned on Harry, making him since. He looked away, unable to meet the blonde's eyes.
Draco felt stupid for sobbing all over him like a baby, but he had felt like his world was coming apart. He always knew he was a failure, but having a baby and putting it through what he had went through was unimaginable. It's not like he had never given Jashua's treatment of him a second thought. He sometimes thought that his boyfriend took things too far, but never voiced his concerns or held onto them for enough time to do anything about them. When Harry came back, though, those feelings only intensified and now, somewhere deep inside his mind, Draco had to admit that Jashua had taken it too far. Jashua wanted a kid. He forced Draco to get pregnant, but the blonde knew he'll never treat it properly and he'd be damned if he brought a child into the world only to have fear and discipline beaten into him by his father. That never ends well. Draco would know.
"please" the blonde cried out quietly and Harry panicked upon seeing that he actually had tears in his eyes. He knew only fear reduced Draco Malfoy to tears.
Harry couldn't move, couldn't breathe, couldn't comprehend a single word or request being uttered out of the blonde's mouth.
Don't own any of the characters. Rowling does. Enjoy!
Well, that's it. I am sad to see this story end, but it was time. Thank you so much for everyone who has followed it so far and bore with me when it took me more than a week to update at instances (I know some authors might do that and I am not judging, but I just don't like to). A special thanks to JJ, who betaed a huge chunk of the third part and motivated me to update more often. I hope you all enjoyed it up until the end!
Harry got up, ignoring the whispers of the audience and the glances people were throwing him. He turned towards the officiate.
Harry got his answer on the next page. The page that broke his heart then stomped all over it. He was in the library 'studying' with Ron and Hermione, when he reached that dreaded page. It was tear-stained and marked with...blood.
He was snapped out of his thoughts by Draco's soft moaning. Slowly, his eyelids fluttered and soon, Harry was gazing into sobered silver eyes. It was the first glimpse he'd had of his real Draco since hogwarts. He loved it.
That's why he needed to get away from him that day after the trial. He doesn't remember much of what happened. It was all a blur even on that day. But he remembers thinking that Harry somehow knew what he was planning to do. And, standing there, looking at his wide, green, wet, pleading eyes, Draco knew that Harry could talk him out of it in a heartbeat. Even standing in front of him made Draco second guess his plans, but he knew there was no other way. Everything was gone and he was a nobody.
There was a hint of bitterness to Draco's voice and, for the life of him, Harry couldn't make out why Draco reading about Harry's love and concern would cause him such hurt. Suddenly, his sadness was replaced by pure rage at the blondes' actions.
Harry hands shot up to his hair instinctively, but he casually manvuered them back onto draco's arms and pulled him up until they were both standing.
That was the last thing Harry remembered before everything went black.
He almost cast the spell right then and there, just to get a sense of what to do to help draco. But he couldn't. The words were frozen in his head at the thought of having to endure the same suffering as yesterday. Was draco going through that all the time?
The blonde looked taken back by the suggestion. Harry knew why. The brunette would have never suggested such a thing if he couldn't hear Draco's thoughts.
Harry discovered that his best friend had known the owner of the journal, but, for some reason, he didn't want to ask Ron about it. He just had a bad feelings about how their friendship turned out. If Rob and this person had still been friends, Harry would've known about him by now. Did he? Who did Ron hang out with? Who in the school had an elitist wealthy family and was introduced to Harry as Ron's friend? Nobody. Harry didn't have to ponder the issue too long. He tried not to wince at the fact that the journal now addressed him personally. It was all just... So sad.
Harry forced a smile and put a hand on his friend's shoulder.
"Don't do that!" Harry snapped and felt instantly guilty when Draco flinched. His tone didn't change, though. "Don't act like you don't know what I am talking about, you manipulative bastard! How could you do that to me? A threat to your life is the one thing I could never stand and you know it. You're no better than some dementor, sucking happy memories out of people and using their fears against them. Let me help you out if you're so adamant on pushing me away! You're an addict and I am not letting you go out there until you agree to go to rehab. And like it or not, there's nothing you can do about it."
Harry didn't want to ask. Perhaps it was private, but the bathroom incident had taught him never to cast a spell that he didn't know the outcome of and draco has been a tad suicidal as of late, so he just had to know.
Nothing.
Harry just stood there, a few inches from the doorway, gaping at the blonde whom he had known ever since he was 11.
"But only until this point!"
"What?" he yells.
Harry trailed off upon seeing the blind panic running through the blonde's eyes. Once again, he didn't understand any of it.
But his mate had fallen asleep in his arms, calmed by the weird sensation that the veela was giving off. Draco gently laid him down on the couch, then crooned as he watched his beautiful, perfect mate sleep soundly. It took a couple of seconds for him to snap out of it and realize what he was doing was creepy, at which point he called Emmyl and asked him to take Harry to a guest bedroom and tuck him in.
Harry was just about to ask what he meant when Draco suddenly wiped around and looked at him with a horrified expression.
Draco nodded, but was already dreading the upcoming question.
As soon as the officiate left, Harry’s rage finally caught up with him. He gripped his wand tightly as he focused on the memory of visiting the apothecary, apparating straight into the place.
Don't own any of the characters. Rowling does. Enjoy!
"Why are you sorry?" Harry asked softly, trying to stave off his rage at the blonde's completely unnecessary apology.
"I don't want you to see." he repeated quietly. Only then did Harry really trace the source of all the blood and he couldn't keep his anger at bay anymore.
"I-I"
Harry was snapped out of his thoughts by Draco’s quiet words.
But draco didn't want to talk. He snapped at Harry.
Suddenly, it was after the trials and Harry's heart was breaking and he was silently begging younger draco not to leave him, that he needed him to comfort Harry just like that day in the cupboard, that a lot of people he'd known had died or gotten into relationships and that he felt absolutely alone.
“Oh… oh God!” the blonde all but screamed, letting go of Harry’s hand and throwing his face into his own. Harry stared at Draco in horror, forgetting the question altogether as he watched the blonde tremble with pain.
"I'll kill myself" he screamed louder and suddenly everything was quiet and even Draco's sobs had  subsided, although Harry's seemed to be getting worse at his words.
"Draco, please. I don't want you to be in pain.". Harry urged, not taking no for an answer. Draco mumbled something inaudible.
"or I didn't think you'd want to see me."
"interesting." he murmured, "tell me. Is this not the same guy you had a relationship with in hogwarts who used to indulge in your ridiculous needs and enable them."
"Harry, if I don't get that potion, I am going to kill myself. There's no other way." he said with a steady voice, as if talking about the weather. "if you force me to stay here, I promise the moment I am out of your sight, I'll do it. I swear it. And it will have to work this time. It needs to."
"What if I promise to oblivate you of me completely? If things don't work out? Would that make it easier to be my friend?"
Suddenly, the blonde couldn't hold back the gasp of air as his anxiety reached unbearable levels and Jashua took the opportunity to pour the liquid down Draco's throat. The Blonde was determined not to swallow and held his breathe until he passed out completely, with Jashua whispering in his ear, aiming Draco's head to continue looking at his dead ex-lover.
The tactic worked and Harry blushed then started stammering awkward thank yous, not knowing what else to say.
Draco hadn't thought about his shard for months, until he remembered.. Harry. His mind had cleared enough to think rationally. Jashua had lied to him in the past to keep him chained here and he wouldn't fall for it again. That would be foolish. Draco didn't want to be a fool anymore. He'd been one for long enough and he refused to do it anymore. Harry was alive. He had to be and Draco had to warn him.
Draco looked at the floor and for a single gut-wretching second, Harry thought he would revert back to not talking to Harry anymore. Then, he did.
"Eat it!" he half-shouted, half-sobbed. He didn't even know when his eyes had started to water or when his throat had closed up, but they had.
“No. Who cares if they see? It’s none of their business. Besides, they’ll all know sooner or later. I don’t plan on letting you go anytime soon.”
"So, how did you meet him?" he asked suddenly. It's the question that Draco had been dreading but he saw it coming from miles away. So he told the story, leaving out the details that he knew would upset Harry, but it seemed he had failed yet again. By the end of it, Harry was in tears.
Harry nodded quickly, frantic to get the blonde out of there and into the warmth of Grimmauld Place with Scruffie and Kreacher, since he and draco get along for some reason, and everything they have worked so hard to regain. Harry could see his Draco coming back to life. He couldn't lose him now, not for any kinds of answers. Harry could wait. He'd waited three years before that, afterall. He could wait a couple of days.
Harry tried to be as supportive as possible of the blonde’s decision to get a job. It was truly amazing that Draco was putting in so much effort to be able to interact with people, but the brunette wasn’t sure it was worth the cost. The blonde came home exhausted after every shift. His boss allowed him no breaks whatsoever, and Draco seemed to be lost in his own mind most of the time. If Harry asked, he would quickly assure him that everything was fine, but the brunette definitely wasn’t buying it. He would occasionally drop by the cafe and check up on Draco, glad that the blonde didn’t seem too stressed out by having so many people around, but something was still off. It was only when Harry decided to take another day off work and spend it at the cafe that the brunette realized what the blonde was hiding from him.
"I've heard about that, Harry. It causes witches and wizards to just basically give up on everything. It was so scary to watch it happen. Bill had a friend and the family and I were trying to support him. It was useless. Everything we did was useless. There was a whole ward of them. People went in and out all the time. They even left some stuff behind like it was sodding inevitable that they will return. I guess it was. Eventually, their magic starts to die. That was the worst part. It's so easy for people like us to cast lumos or cleaning spells. These people didn't even feel a connection to their wands anymore. They would get suspended from work 'indefinetly', which also made things worse. People wouldn't want to be around them anymore, not really understanding what was happening. I can't say I blame them. I was starting to get afraid I would become depressed just by listening to Bill's friend. I think it was a nurse or something that left the door open one night by accident and he jumped off the room and landed on the fence. There was nothing anyone can do. I hate myself for saying this, but it was for the best. He was miserable and everyone had abandoned him. It was like watching pieces of his life crumple until nothing was left. It was horrible. The nurses told Bill that, that Bill shouldn't be sad because all the patients eventually die, too, especially after they lose their magic. That's why everyone was so bloody careful around George after we lost Fred. We couldn't risk it. One slip and he could be gone just like that. I wasn't prepared to lose another brother, especially to that horrible disease."
"Bullocks! Who did this to you?" he asked angrily, gesturing at his face and hoping for Draco to just drop his mask already, but knowing he wouldn't.
This was difficult to write tbh. Let me know what you think!
Draco knew that Harry doesn't care about him and didn't want to help him. So he made it about saving instead and, of course, Harry immediately withdrew his rejection.
“I don’t want you to leave!” Harry finally declared, his own eyes brimming with tears as well, the large green orbs pleading with Draco to change his mind.
“I am not sure, Harry. I’ll be more certain once I speak to him,” she said confidently, giving the brunette a smile, though what she just said was causing Harry’s heart to beat out of his chest.
______________________________________________________
"Leave me alone, potter! Don't you have some criminal godfather and savage bird friend to say goodbye to? If not, the weseal and mud blood must be waiting around for the boy-who-won't-die by now."
"I know, Draco. Perhaps you just have to look harder for the diary."
"Harry, you-you can't be seriously considering competing!" Draco shrieked out, taking Harry's hands back in his and looking into his eyes pleadingly.
When he came across this black diary then, he couldn't help it. His mind started playing tricks on him.
Harry cut himself off when he saw the look on Ron's face. He had grown shades paler and his eyes were wide and pitiful. He suddenly lunged at Harry, engulfing him in a tight hug.
"no." he had said again, more calmly, "I'll get better. I'll be better. I promise!"
Ron was talking down at him. He wasn't convinced Draco would get better. That didn't matter. What does Ron know anyway? What does anyone know? Even if specialists haven't made progress, Harry would. No one would be as determined as he was at the moment. Perhaps the matter was a bit more urgent than Harry thought, but he would make time. He would do his best.
Harry shook his head.
He was snapped out of his thoughts by the sounds of sheets moving and he realized his eye-lids were closing and Draco was starting to get up off the bed. He hastily clasped his hand around draco's wrist, ignoring the clapping noises and the thoughts and determined to speak through them.
With a sigh, Harry argued no further, turned on his heel, pulled out the boxes of chocolates he asked Kreacher for, then sat down next to draco and put the boxes in between the two of them, opening Draco's favorite and taking out the long biscuit one that they always used to split in Hogwarts when Draco's mom sent boxes over.
Second (SPOILER AND TRIGGER WARNING) : Draco comes from a pureblood, traditional background and he, in this story, is a very sensitive person who has been depressed for a long time. That causes him to blame himself for everything. In this chapter draco reveals that the potion is for an abortion and spends a lot of it hating himself for 'killing his baby'. This isn't my opinion of abortion, but eitherway if that would offend you, I suggest you skip to the summary at the end.
Draco was silent for a moment and still hadn't moved. For a second, Harry was afraid he didn't believe him and would take off and never come back. Harry would find him, of course, but to lose the trust he had worked so hard to gain would devastate Harry. Finally, the blonde sighed and nodded.
Draco smiled, seemingly satisfied, and took both their plates down to the kitchen without being asked to. Harry took the opportunity to look through Draco's paper pile, determined to find out what the blonde wanted to do, only to have a horrifying realization.
Draco clamped his lips shut tightly, determined not to get a single drop of that potion into his system. He tried to breathe out of his nose and calm himself down to think of something, anything he could say that would get Jashua to let him go for the day. His search came up completely blank and he started to panic even more at the idea of all his greatest fears coming true at once.
Draco was snapped out of his thoughts when he realized his Harry had tossed the cloak aside and was approaching Jashua with a furious expression on his face. Draco lunged at him, hiding him, protecting him, keeping him safe. It worked, even though Draco knew Harry could fight him off easily if he wanted to. But Harry seemed too happy about seeing Draco to worry about Jashua anymore. Draco's heart sank.
"You said he raped me. He didn't."
“What are the specials today?!” the guy asked rudely. Draco blinked at him, looking nervous.
Harry's heart sank into his stomach as all the missing puzzle pieces slowly fit together.
The blonde looks up to see Harry frowning down at him.
"he might detect it and, knowing you, you'd probably barge in there at the slightest hint of injury. You have no idea how bad it has been and I've survived without you so far, saviuor." he said, then chuckled.
"What do you mean?"
" He killed you today.. " he heard the blonde murmur as he shifted and Harry caught the reflection of the light off the item he was holding. His heart stopped. The entire world seemed to stop for a minute.
Harry jumped at the sound of Pomfrey's voice, who was now standing behind him with a sad smile on her face. He remained quiet, thinking he had just imagined the whole thing.
"Answer me!" he yelled when the blonde tayed silent for too long.
" Brownies." the blonde whispered.
His thoughts sounded frantic and so Harry hurried to correct his mistake.
Harry arrived late to the alley. He had been spending the entire weekend bent over the books trying to figure out what to do with the situation. According to the hospital records, all treatment options listed in the book didn't work with Draco at all. Harry thought it made sense that therapy wouldn't work. If draco had started speaking about the Wizarding world they would've kept him there forever. Harry's eyes darkened at the thought. That place was horrid. Harry imagined spending one more minute in that place would've made him go mad. They had kept hid Draco there for months while Harry was crying over the unanswered letters thinking draco hated him.
"Shut up!" draco suddenly yelled, getting up off the couch and pacing around the room throwing Harry death glares, "What I did was horrible and you know it! I've taken a life, even if it wasn't a life yet! Don't call my child a 'couple of cells'."
Draco looked surprised for a second, then shifted his gaze to the floor and nodded slowly.
"You lied to me. You said you would never lie to me." Draco whispered, looking at the floor and wrapping his arms around himself.
(See the end of the chapter for
"what did I do, Draco?" Harry cried out, trying to get Draco to talk to him. "I don't understand why you're so upset."
“Hermione, please. He means a lot to me, alright? I know he might have gotten used to his condition, but if there is something, anything, that could help him, I want to know so I could help him,” Harry begged, not knowing how else to convince the witch. He thought he heard Ron snorting and saying ‘Careful there buddy or people might start thinking you’re gay for ‘im.’ He ignored the red-head and kept trying to stare Hermione down. She seemed to absorb what he said and nodded slightly. Harry sighed in relief.
"Then why'd you bail on me when you said we could meet?" Harry suddenly whispered, his gaze is distant and, for a moment, it seemed like he isn't really speaking to Draco. The blondes wildly searched his head for an excuse and could only come up with one that's closest to the truth.
" I need you to listen to me very carefully, potter." he whispered, though Harry flinched at the name," you have done nothing that warrants forgiveness from me or anyone else. You have done nothing wrong and you owe me nothing. Understand?"
"Draco. I need you to listen to me. You are not a burden to me. You aren't now and you never were and you never will be! I am serious. Please believe me. Don't you trust me? Why would we have stayed together for so long and why would you be here now if you caused me any trouble? I loved you before and I care so much about you and well-being now. If there's anything or
As Harry handed Draco back his now clean clothing, he made sure to take the shard out from the pockets and locked it into one of his drawers, determined to get rid of it later. He couldn't let his Draco have that, ever again.
"Please, Draco?" Harry pleaded, not knowing what else to say to put Draco's worries to rest. They were true, after all. Draco was, in many ways, insufferable, but that was the disease, not his ex-lover and Harry had to remind himself of that before letting it show.
"Fine" he said loudly, then took a large bite of his sandwich and a sip of his pumpkin juice, "Happy?"
Draco was tugging at his hair and his sleeves, then wrapping his arms around himself again. He was simply frantic, his face completely red and he was pacing around the bathroom now. Harry chuckled despite himself. Draco always overreacted to everything. Sure, the tournament was dangerous, but no contestant had ever died before. Draco was always so terrified over Harry, the brunette found it adorable.
"M'so sorry, Harry"
"Finite" he said, pointing his wand to himself. When nothing happened, he drank the potion and stated clearly. "I am Harry James Potter. I am not Polyjuiced. I am not wearing a glamour. I swear."
He was snapped out of the memory by Jashua's fist colliding with his jaw.
Draco's smile instantly disappeared and was replaced with a frown as he nodded his head and looked to the floor.
Harry sighed sadly, then took his hand off of Draco's arm.
"morning" he breathes out.
"oh, Draco, what can I do?" Harry whispered while still holding onto to the blonde.
"I'm not"
"yes."
Satisfied with finally getting a chance alone with the blonde, Harry didn't dare question the odd timing of the meeting, instead he turned to leave the aisle as requested, only to be interuppted by Draco's shaky voice.
"It isn't about you wanting me here, potter! Thank God you're now silent for a second so I could explain, though I am certain you won't understand. You don't even want to understand. He just want me to stay for some reason, even though you clearly didn't like me anymore. It's like you want me to burden you . This isn't about you not seeing me as a burden. Eitherway, I will feel like one, but you don't give a shit about my feelings, do you? You just want me to do whatever it is you desire. You think I am going about my life wrong? Alright, you're right. I am. Nothing new there. Failure as I will always be and I am fine with that. It's none of your business anyway. We aren't lovers. I will always feel like a burden with you and it will make me even worse. Surely you don't want that?"
“I didn’t go in! I couldn’t. What kind of a father would I be when I can’t even walk into a place without breaking down and running home? What a great role model I am!” the blonde said sarcastically, gesturing with his arms. Harry sighed with a sad look on his face.
A thirteen year-old Harry, coming back from saving buckbeak, proud and happy about his actions, but also sad about seeing the injustice that was done to his Godfather. He was abruptly stopped by the sound of crying coming from the girl's bathroom, but it didn't sound like a girl. Curious and sympathizing, he walked into the room to find Draco huddled against the wall, hiding beneath the sinks, trying to make himself a small as possible and crying his eyes out.
"You promised you'd stay!" Harry exclaimed. He looked at Draco frantically and seemed to be holding back from reaching out and keeping him in place.
Younger draco buried his face in his arms tightening his hold on himself and attempting become one with the walls.
"Because you keep putting yourself down and I care about you! How.. How do I make you feel like you're not a burden! I have to help!" Harry screamed and pulled at his hair.
“Fine. I just want these,” he said, unfolding a piece of paper and placing it on the counter. Harry watched as the blonde looked down at the paper, nodded slightly, then obtained a big box of the potions, pulled two out, and put them down on the counter.
"Shall I call Kreacher in for seconds?" he asked, cheerfully. The smile went off his face when he saw Draco looking at him, mortified, then trying to eye the vertiserum subtly. Harry immediately grabbed the vial and uncorked it, only to be stopped by Draco's hands.
Draco was immediately reminded of all the times his hair was used against him. Images of Jashua dragging him through the halls to the bedroom by it, when it was way longer, hit him instantly and he had to suppress a sob. Fear gripped his entire body and took complete hold when he realized he was even more afraid of Harry noticing what was happening. He knew his work was getting sloppy and scrambled in his mind to remember how to give proper head but came up blank.
The blonde looked puzzled for a moment before he asked “Would that make you happy, Harry?”
He didn't read into Harry's every move like he did now. He didn't think Harry was with him out of sheer pity and obligation. These feelings seemed to have grown after the war. And Harry wanted to delve deeper and find out what had caused them, but he had promised draco he wouldn't look at any memories after the trial and he honored that promise.
Harry had gone to bed the second night with his Draco in his arms. For the first time since he saw the blonde all those weeks ago, he felt hopeful. Draco knew the truth and he ate something and he didn't leave harry's side at night. Harry had checked, throughly, through the night to make sure he was still there. He still felt afraid that Draco would bolt and leave him like he had in the past or worse that he would leave him permenantly like he had intended after the trial. The thought put a damper on his sleep but it was worth it everytime he got up and saw that Draco was still there.
"I could take vertiserum." Harry quickly added, "When we are together. Just so you know I am being truthful, that I am not lying to you. Then, would you believe me?"
Younger draco huffed in disappointment and murmured to himself.
"It's going to be alright." Myrtle whispered and Draco gave her a sad smile, knowing nothing would be alright if the notebook made its way to his father's hands. He thanked Myrtle, then left the bathroom, looking paler than he had when he couldn't walk for three days straight because of that cane. He knew things could be and will be worse.. Way worse.
"hmm and why not?" he asked, trying to sound casual.
"After Jashua found you and took you into the ER after you... Did the doctors give you a name? A diagnosis? Anything to help you get better?"
Harry finally meets Jashua, and then Draco seeks him out with a mysterious request.
Draco immediately beamed and started scarfing down the food on the plate. Harry couldn't decide whether he should be glad that his lover was eating or worried that he was only doing so because Harry wanted it. He decided something was better than nothing and smiled at the blonde.
"Don't lie to me, you stupid Mudblood's son!" Draco gritted out then flinched at his own tone.
“Of course I would!” he said cheerfully when he realized he hadn’t answered the brunette yet. He then jumped off his chair, took off his Auror robes, and threw them on his desk. He blushed deeply when he felt Harry interlocking his left arm with Draco’s right one.
"Y-you didn't like my cookies much after… S-so, I started to make you brownies. That's what I would've made for you if I had known you were hurting."
"I-I can't let you leave, Draco. You understand that, right?" Harry said soothingly, trying not to freak the blonde out. It didn't work. Harry was sure Draco would've run if he had the energy and the fact that he didn't only strengthed Harry's belief that this was the only way.
“Bloody great, Draco. You’ve managed to piss off the nicest guy in history. This is a new record,” the blonde murmured to himself, falling back onto the bed and looking up at the ceiling. He wanted to apologize, but his heart was still racing from their argument, from Harry’s words. They both needed to calm down before seeing each other again. The blonde waited for an hour, mindlessly creating more bubbles with Harry’s wand and popping them with his fingers.
Fair warning: I am currently staying somewhere where the internet connection isn't very good. So, updates might be less frequent from now on, but the story will be finished no matter what. Enjoy!
"I am so sorry. I shouldn't have told you any of that. I didn't know you would react like this."
After what felt like hours, Harry and Draco slowly left the underside of the bed, with Harry immediately stretching once out. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Draco admire him with a faint smile and he couldn't help the blush that formed across his cheeks. He wished time would just bloody hell stop already so his Draco could never be hurt again, but he also knew that the blonde needed to be healed and he needed it hours ago. There was no way Harry was going to waste anymore time. His Draco needed tending immediately.
"What happened to you?" he asked bluntly, perhaps a little too loudly as the blonde suddenly looked around, panicked, then looked back at Harry.
Draco thought he, too, would start hitting him if he could. Draco wouldn't blame him. He did fuck up the child's life.
"no!" Harry half-shouted, half-screamed. "I'll n-never let you go again, D-Draco! You can't die. Please don't die. Please, for me."
Draco calmly walked to the store and started to plead with the mannequin in the shop’s window. Then, he was finally given permission to enter, and walked into the reception of St. Mungo’s only to realize he had no idea how to get to Harry.
"O-of course I w-would've!" he half-yelled, half-sobbed, then grabbed both Draco's hands in his and looked him in the eyes. It was hard to avoid them. So wide and sad and Draco knew he did that to him. "Y-you have to p-promise me you won't do it again. No matter what. Promise me!"
He knelt down in front of the space in between the two dumpsters, knowing Draco hid there when he felt threatened. The blonde was entirely hidden by the shadow of the dumpster to his right and he seemed adamant on staying put. Harry was about to ask why when the blonde suddenly spoke with a forced firmness.
"could you.. Umm...cast this spell on me?" he asked hesitantly, pushing a small crumpled paper to Harry with a spell written across it in handwriting that looks like catscratch.
Draco felt his eyes become wet at Harry’s hurtful words. How could his mate think he didn't like him? Draco loves Harry so much it
Harry sighed. He should've known Draco wouldn't remember anything. What he saw yesterday was probably painful withdrawals.
The next part may take a bit since my work has finally started back up again, so I'll be pretty busy.
"Here is what we'll do." Harry started, hoping his technique would work, "You said you wanted me to be happy today, right? Well, let's make this the perfect day. We'll both put ideas in a jar and draw randomly until the end of the day. Doesn't that sound fun?"
After a quick shower, during which Draco, thankfully, left the door unlocked, Harry moved them back into the sitting room, where Kreacher had left them both plates under heating charms as instructed.
"Sorry about the pain potion. I know you said you didn't want any but I freaked out, whatever you took was causing you so much pain. I didn't know what else to do. Do you forgive me?"
Draco was a monster. He had reeled Harry back in and now they were both miserable. Harry needed to forget about Draco and the blonde still couldn't understand how the brunette had any love left for him.
Harry's jaw dropped.
Draco's expression turned panicked again and he hurriedly shook his head.
"Of course I didn't!" Harry screamed and draco's heart broke. "I am so sorry draco. I hope we can find a way to at least still be friends?"
Terrified that he would get too close to someone who would just abandon him because of his three 'problems'.
"It can't be worse than what you did to me." he said simply looking almost sad for a moment.
Draco stole quick glances between Harry and the plate. Harry felt like understood the blonde's reasoning, but be also wanted Draco to say it so Harry could jump in with an argument. But it looked like draco wouldn't speak, so Harry continued anyways.
"You know what's in there, myrtle! You know no one can see it! Please don't drive me crazy and just tell me if you've moved it."
"Sorry. It's just the last time I said something even close to 'muggles should be treated as humans' father used the cane and my knee popped right out. Not to mention how he would react to the other things. I can't-"
"I-I was g-going to come. H-honest. I was actually g-glad you asked me to m-meet you. I thought y-you hated m-me. W-when I saw you, I th-thought y-you would s-spit in my f-face, not b-be f-friendly. I-I was h-hurt and I s-still tried to go, but then t-the potion and I-I couldn't w-walk. I f-felt horrible about it. I th-thought I w-would never s-see you again, then y-you sent another l-letter m-making fun of me for actually b-believing y-you wanted to see me... "
“Yes, writing down orders and taking them to tables needs a lot of skills. They should compensate me as they would any muggle with my expertise,” he joked, waving the brunette’s concerns off. Harry only frowned deeper.
" Harry-"
Harry’s eyes widened. Where had that thought come from? He wanted to do this. He wanted to marry Ginny.
For the first time in his life, Harry thanked every God and everything on the planet that the court had stripped Draco of his magic. He couldn't even imagine what it would be like to see his magic go. Frightening, no doubt. And not knowing when or if it would return...Ron's story and sentiments made a lot of sense, but, thankfully, Draco wasn't like that."
After three cookies, Harry was satisfied and sure that the blonde wouldn't collapse. Harry loosened his tight hold and Draco instantly sank to the floor and drew his knees to his chest, then seemed to have a sudden onslaught of energy.
Important note: Chapter 14 has been changed entirely. I'd suggest you go back and read it before moving forward so you won't be lost.
"My appearance has nothing to do with the situation at hand. If you choose not to believe me, then that is your right. Eitherway, I am staying here as promised, so if I am lying to you, I'll begin to experience withdrawals at some point and then you'll know."
Draco said nothing and Harry look defeated.
Harry's voice was hopeful, but draco's thoughts were running wild at the memory. He had completely forgotten about Harry and his bruised jaw in the frenzy of Jashua's rage. He had once again hurt Harry and doesn't know how to make it better. Suddenly, he is crying again. Silently, but he hated himself for it. Harry was the one who was hurt and Jashua was very angry, so why was Draco acting like an emotional brat?
"she and headless nick are having a chat.i don't think she'll be back for hours."
"It's not nonsense."
When Harry looked up, he saw that the blonde's gaze wasn't on him anymore. It seemed the worst had happened. Harry was so sure that Draco might say yes this time, but the blonde had seen and there was no way to take it back now. Harry followed Draco's eyes to see the stacks of books about depression and notes he had about Draco's condition, Draco's whereabouts, Draco's pain, everything about him and his progress.
“Yes!” Harry said instantly without thinking it through. He wanted to slap himself when Draco recoiled and flinched at the loud response. Speaking more quietly, Harry explained “I am sorry, Draco. I-I know that you don’t want to talk about it, but you really scared me yesterday and-”
"c-can you cast another test, please?" the blonde whispered and Harry's thoughts were confirmed.
"Yeah, I figured." he says slowly, "Do you want to talk about it?"
"You startin' ta sound like me." he heard a voice say. Perhaps it's his. He didn't know when it happened or why but he was saying the first things that came to mind and couldn't stop. "all clingy and you don wanme to die n'stuff."
Draco couldn't get his mouth to form words, to deny, deny, deny. All he could do was Lau there and tremble as his mind screamed at him.
Harry didn't need to lie.
" D-did the doctors say anything?" Harry asked him, hoping the blonde wouldn't freak out at the forwardness of the question.
"Oh God, Draco!" he screamed and lunged at the blonde, pulling him up to his feet, "What did you do?"
The blonde sat across from Harry once again, looking at him incredously.
"N-no." he said suddenly, answering the question Harry had forgotten he had asked. "I-I will show up. I swear it! I will. I will. Just, please. You must leave. You can't be here right now."
"N-now you're giving up th-things for me. I j-just want to p-please you, Harry."
The unrealistic idea that Draco was now completely fine, though, disappeared in the morning when the blonde started to shake with Harry on top of him. After Draco rolled them over and took charge, Harry had just attributed the shaking to pleasure, but soon it became apparent that something was wrong. Draco's tears were falling onto Harry as the blonde continued to suck him off, determined that Harry finish even though he, himself, seemed miserable, and not stopping even when Harry asked him to.
Harry sighed, hoping Draco wouldn't do anything to himself, but not daring to cast anymore spells on the blonde. His draco had been through enough. He murmured an incantation to make anyone in the house be unable to hurt themselves, then sat up against the bed's headboard, a million thoughts running through his mind.
There has to be some sort of way to scoop out all those horrible thoughts and bring back his draco.
“Y-yes, s-sir,” he stuttered out, trying to get his breathing under control. He wouldn’t have a breakdown again. He could easily be replaced at this new job in a heartbeat if he made any trouble for the boss. He just needed to get through the day and, then, it would be fine. He could cry about it when he gets home. For now, he needed to stay calm and avoid the many noises that surrounded him.
An image of eight children with green eyes and blonde hair running towards Draco as he comes back from work suddenly assaults his brain and he feels tears running down his cheek.
"alright! Alright! I'll stay if that will get you to sleep."
"I made a promise and I won't back down on it." he said firmly, trying to convey how important it was for him that Draco trust him. Draco looked away, seemingly.. Ashamed?
The blonde swallowed, shifted uncomfortably, then let out a sigh and looked away.
Draco looked up at Harry with a puzzled expression and pressed his lips into a thin line.
Harry took a deep breathe, cursing the day of the trial and everything Draco had lost, even if Harry didn't care about any of it. Apparently, it meant a lot to Draco.
"So what do you want to eat and drink? They have the widest selection that I've ever seen." Harry told him, gesturing towards the large menu he had shoved in front of Draco moments earlier.
"Fine! Be like that and see if I care."
Draco finally sees things from Harry's perspective.
Draco blushed and smiled, looking at the floor for entirely different reasons. Harry finally did it!
Harry looked up to see the blonde looking devastated and conflicted.
Harry stood there gaping at Draco like he's lost his mind. This was his chance. He could ask everything he wanted to know, but then Draco would feel betrayed and he might even not want to stay, or worse, do something to himself like he's been threatening to do all night.
"do you... Would you mind if I cast a spell on you to let me know if you're too badly hurt?"
"I wish you had, though. I wish I had known. Perhaps if I weren't so pampered, I would've had the courage to do it a lot sooner and I wouldn't have been a burden on anyone." he whispered, looking at his forearms. Harry's heart sunk further into his stomach.
Harry's heart clenched at the words. He had never thought that there might be someone else who saw Hogwarts as a refuge.
Harry wasn't proud of his decision. But after seeing Malfoy that day, he knew he had to do something. He was shaky, nervous, nothing like Draco was, nothing like his draco used to be. It was simple really... Cast a locating spell and bump into him accidentally later on.
"I-I was h-hoping you'd show up." he choked out between the sobs that Harry hadn't noticed had begun. Suddenly Harry couldn't  take it anymore. He needed to take him away from here. He needed to keep him safe like he couldn't all these years ago, but only with his permission.
They were both panting by the time they were done, but it only took a few seconds for Draco's words to get through to Harry.
"Piss off you mudblood's son! Don't touch me!" he yelled loud enough for his father to hear, which seemed to satisfy the older man as a faint smile made itself known on his face. Draco's eyes said 'sorry', but Harry didn't care about the empty insult. He was more worried than he had ever been about his friend and it took everything he had not to drag Draco off the field and to the kitchens. He could give Draco this game. The blonde promised everything would change afterward. And he promised he wouldn't go through with it if he was feeling too sick. Harry believed him.
"Hey" the blonde said suddenly, taking one of Harry's hands. He didn't know why he did it, but he needed Harry to stop being so upset. "You know it is fairly common for withdrawals to start after 8 hours. It's been like 14."
"No. Not until you talk to me." he replied firmly, expecting a fight. What he didn't expect was for Draco's shoulders to slum and his body to start shaking with fear.
"P-please, Harry. I'll even make it worth your while."
" fine! That wouldn't be ideal. It wouldn't even be nice, but I told you I want you around. I want to be in your life, even if just as a friend. Can't you believe that? And leave thoughts of the future for the future?" Harry asked desperately, willing Draco to just... Stop.
"Yes, I do! I won't let you maim yourself! What about your kids running towards you and building a fort and everything? You'd be willing to give that up?" Harry screams through sobs.
He often wonders whether Jashua truly loves him like he claims. It didn't really matter since Draco had nowhere to go, but Jashua gave him what he deserves, so in a way, Draco loves him and he felt it would be better if the honest, kind dark-haired, blue-eyed man in front of him somehow felt the same. He was possessive and overwhelming, always asking where Draco was going and who he interacted with. He never like the idea of Draco being outside for too long, saying that others may treat him badly. He sometimes cries and hugs Draco tightly when he  brings up leaving. Draco always feels guilty then. He didn't mean to upset him. He just didn't want to burden him anymore. He reassured Draco that he wasn't, that he enjoyed having the blonde around and proved it by locking Draco indoors for another month. Draco never brought up leaving again. That made him think that Jashua does love me and Draco held onto the thought for dear life.
"yeah?"
It together forever, but, finally, he took another shaking breathe and, his entire body trembling, he continued. "I m-meant what I s-said. Y-you... You have control. I-I won't stop you from leaving or from choosing to lose those memories even if I don't support it. It's w-entirely upto y-you. If you agree to the s-spell, I'll cast it. I-if you want to buy the potion, I'll give you the money and come with you. I-if y-you w-want me to ob-obliviate you, I'll do it."
" So.. " he started, trying to keep his voice from breaking but failing, "You.. Didn't mean it?"
“Harry, I would never lie to you, ever. I-” Draco started, putting a lot of effort into not touching the sad brunette at all. His heart was breaking with every second that passed without him making his mate feel better.
The brunette was determined. Something had to be done. He had to take back his rejection. He had to do something. Harry wouldn't leave the blonde to suffer in silence, not again.
He willed himself out of Draco's mind and came to in the bedroom hearing more of Draco's screams at having relived the memory.
“Malfoy, I-” he started to yell but was surprised to find an old man behind the counter when he turned around, one that was glaring daggers at him.
Draco's thoughts stopped as he encountered the very last page of the journal, which had more of Harry's catscratch writing.
The blonde's eyes widen then he looked to the floor and stayed silent.
But as the days passed, and the blonde remained unconscious, Harry's resolve faltered. He would sneak into the wing every chance he could, not wanting Draco to be alone when he wakes up. He would whisper things into Draco's ear, careful not to make his presence known under the cloak. Draco didn't show any signs of improvement.
The thoughts seemed to increase in volume and anxiety levels as they went on and on.
“Mr. Potter, if you’re having erectile dysfunction issues, these potions won’t help you. They only serve to increase your lust for the person closest in proximity to you until you’ve consummated. If there is an initial problem with physical arousal, increasing your attraction or psychological arousal won’t solve the issue.” Malfoy said in a completely professional tone, looking Harry in the eye.
He knew his threat wasn't an empty one, though. Without the abortion vial, the blonde would've taken his life to spare his child a life of hatred and abuse, whether from Jashua, who Draco loves but has a bad temper, or him and the rest of the world who would berate the child simply for being born of a death eater.
The blonde slowly turned around to face her as if just realizing what he had said, then sighed and slumped, feeling terrible.
The blonde’s smile instantly faded. He narrowed his eyes at Harry, glaring daggers at the brunette.
"I'm sorry." he heard the blonde whisper, though it was muffled. He looked back to find Draco burying his head in his hands, leaning over.
Pomfrey seemed to deflate, then said" very well", left an envelope next to the unconscious blonde, and exited the room. Harry wasn't so easy to fool. He had seen through every lie the man had told. But, come to think of it, Draco really was never around on weekends.
"Why are you being like this?" he yelled, frustrated and proceeded to pull at his hair again.
And next to draco. He didn't try to touch the blonde. He just waited awkwardly, unsure of what to do. Suddenly, Draco was snuggling up to him, throwing his leg on top of harry's, hugging him tightly, and putting his head under Harry's cheeks as he sniffled softly.
"It's alright." Harry told him, then placed a tentative hand on his shoulder, which the blonde flinched away from. Harry tried not to let that reaction hurt him.
It was just a bad day, Harry told himself, and it would be over soon and Draco would be fine. With these pleasant thoughts in mind, he let Draco drift to sleep, setting a plan to convince the blonde that he needed to he to help.
"will it hurt you?" he asked, because he would be willing to do anything for draco except that.
But, at harry's words, Draco's sobs only grew louder and more high-pitched.
"I-I am not, Harry. That's not true. I n-need to fix the letter before it's r-ruined forever. Please! I swear-" Draco started, frantic, but slacked in Harry's hold before he could finish.
Harry smiled at the blonde and said "Perfect".
Draco knew this thing with Harry wouldn't last long. He woke up on the third day in Harry's arms and it felt wonderful. That is, until he remembered that he was nothing, that he was nobody. He now knew Harry didn't think so. Afterall, he could've hardly fought the potion and changed the memory. Could he? Would he go through that much trouble just to help Draco? Draco was fine, though. It was a bad few weeks and they've past and so will this.
"morning" he said to Draco as he carefully sat on the other end of the couch. Suddenly, he wasn't  sure of what the right action would be.
"I know what I am doing, Harry. Don't worry." he said, then turned again. Harry couldn't stop himself.
"Would he be upset if you take this home?" the brunette asked gently, gesturing to the plate and coffee cup, which were now in take away boxes.
"You could've died years ago and I would've never known, because you're nowhere and you're everywhere. And I don't know how to t-tell if y-you're re-really you or not."
He wanted all of that, but, to his horror, Draco could feel himself wilting, even in Harry's touch and that was what convinced him that he was completely and irreparably broken.
Harry almost didn't spot the relief on the blonde's face. All he could see were his bloodshot eyes, the bruises he tried to hide under his sleeves, which he was scratching frantically, and the saddest of all smiles he had given Harry, after the one he had showed when the dark-haired one asked him what was wrong during sixth year when Draco had refused to make love to Harry in the light. Only now did Harry know that his lover had been trying to hide the mark, but Harry had shrugged it off back then. Seeing that smile again made Harry want to grab him and demand he tell Harry what was wrong, but the Blonde, by all appearances, came looking for the dark-haired man and Harry wasn't about to blow it by pushing him.
The blonde watched, sorrow spreading through his very core, as Harry got up and left the room without another word, looking devastated.
“Harry Potter talks in his sleep. I know what’s bothering him. Would you like to know?” the elf said, then quickly continued, when Draco looked like he was going to refuse, “I was just thinking if you make it go away, then maybe Harry potter will love you and take his rejection back and you will be normal again.”
"What?"
“Well, they’re not going to wait for me. The whole world won’t wait for me to be able to be bloody functional! They’re due in three months, Harry and they’re going to need someone to take care of them, not- not some child who needs you to hold his hand just so he could muster enough courage to walk out of the house.”
Harry murmured a thank you but didn't let go of draco's arms. The blonde had to pry harry's hand off his arms so he can lay down on the bed as fat away from him as possible. Harry wouldn't have that. He quietly and finally u cast the spell and scooted over to draco then wrapped his arms around him, ignored how he stiffened under his touch. Harry pressed his chest against the blonde's back and finally felt draco relax. He fell asleep trying to pretend, if only just for a moment, that everything was fine, that his draco had come back to him, normal, and would stay forever.
"Wouldn't that make you unhappy?"
"There's something else you can do." he whispers as he looks up at Harry, who also has tears in his eyes for some reason. But before he can continue, he is interrupted by Harry's sobbing.
Harry wanted to cry and older draco couldn't help the tears spreading down his cheeks at the scene. It was entirely different than he remembered. He remembered being pitied, humiliated, disgusted with himself, hurting Harry. But... This was different.
"Liar! Then how do you explain all of what has been happening? You've looked like shit forever. "
"Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Freak. Bloody invalid, Idiot." Draco murmured into the back of the couch without even realizing he was speaking out loud.
It became worse after he saw Draco's torso and the bruises left there by Jashua, he assumed, and the scars that Harry had inflicted upon him when Draco was being controlled and had no idea what was happening. Harry didn't mean to look at the blonde with digust. The feeling had been toward himself and the blonde's so-called 'loving' boyfriend. But Draco seemed to have absorbed the digust completely and aimed it at himself as he shrank away from Harry, curled up into a ball, and started sobbing his eyes out.
Harry's hand flew to Draco's, holding it steady and keeping it from reaching the jar. He needed Draco to remember how fun life could be. He needed him to see the things he seemed to have forgotten about.
Harry looked at the blonde as if he were insane.
" You could still have it again!" Harry screamed frantically, hovering near the door to prevent the blonde from leaving even though Draco had made no attempt to go near the exit and could not leave the Wizarding world without Harry, eitherway.
But Harry couldn't leave it alone. He left the journal behind the sinks in the bathroom where he had found it and, determined to put the whole thing behind him, he didn't say a word of it to anyone. But, a week later, the journal was gone from the bathroom and Harry still couldn't get it out of his mind. He started to look at Draco. Really look at him and he started to notice the tugging of his sleeves, and the silence. It seemed every word out of Malfoy's mouth was either an insult, an agreement to something his friends said, or nothing. It was as if he was programed not to speak a word of his own opinions, not to share his feelings, not to tell anyone anything. Only then did Harry know that whatever feelings Draco had harbored while writing to Harry, he still had them, and they seemed to have gotten worse.
It wasn't perfect anymore. Draco had ruined it.
Harry didn’t want to show him the paper. It was too embarrassing and private. That was the whole reason that he went to the smallest, least-known apothecary in the wizarding world. Of course, Malfoy just
The blonde heard his footsteps, looked up, then smiled widely, ran towards Harry, hugged him tightly, and pulled away starting to rant.
Harry was screaming by the end of it and somewhere along his speech he had let go of draco's shoulders and was clutching at his hair again.
"Yes, that was unpleasant and I've since then spoken to him about it. It did help with the pain from the lack of preparation, though."
"Mate, you alright?" Ron asked from across the table. Harry forced a smile, nodded, then got up and tried to walk out of the library in the most casual way possible.
"Potter, you absolute imbecile!" Draco yelled, but his tone gave him away. He was suppressing a laugh. Then, Harry found himself buried in meat sauce with Scruffie rushing to lick it off. They continued the assault with the Entertained puppy running between them, wagging his tail, as they both laughed. By the time both the plates were empty and Scruffie was stuffed, Harry's stomach growled and he smiled up at Draco, expecting him to say yes immediately.
Harry couldn't bring himself to laugh along just to ease the tension in the room. He couldn't even bring himself to smile at the blonde calling him 'his Harry'.
"yes." he said softly and Draco looked about ready to say no to the proposal, "But losing you entirely will make me a lot more unhappy a lot faster, trust me."
"P-please let me out!"
Harry didn't want this. He didn't want Draco feeling like his own pleasure didn't matter, but apparently, he had pushed Draco away a little too roughly in his haste to prove it and make it all worse. His heart clenched as his lover laid at the foot of the bed unmoving with a terrified look in his wet eyes.
"I am just peachy. Now, are you done with your questions already so I can leave?"
"I'll try, love." he said, then manverued his way under the bed
The girl who had a broken leg actually looked at him and talked to him as if he were dying, like anything she might say might set him off, like she was only bearing his company out of obligation or pity. She beat herself up when he wasn't happy and was so quick to correct him when he suggested she was acting strangely. Harry would've sooner spent the rest of his stay in the bathroom than deal with her. The boy in the other bed didn't speak to Harry at all, but sneaked glances at him when he thought Harry wasn't paying attention. The nurses called him a survivor and said he should be proud, even if his uncle was covering it up. What the bloody hell was that? Proud? Of what? Getting hit and not breaking down? Sure that's nice, but what's nicer would be never to get hit at all.
"No!" Harry shouted, filled with rage at the words he was reading, not aware of the people around him stopping and staring at him.
"I know, but I still meant it. I care for you and I want you to stay. Always."
Knowing Draco would immediately ask to be obliviated if he senses for one second that he was, indeed, being a burden on Harry.
Harry couldn't help himself. He smiled. The journal had been filled with so much pain up until then that Harry had even started dreading reading it, but he knew he had to find the owner no matter what.
"Visit a bookstore?" Draco asked quietly. "You don't read."
“So, you’re not dying?” Draco asked, his smile slowly returning and his eyes lighting up. Harry’s heart seemed to leap at the scene and he nodded happily, glad he got the blonde out of his needy, panicked state early this time. But, as he thought this, the smile on the blonde’s face instantly vanished and Harry growled internally.
The thought was a terrible one and Harry only knew he needed to get to Draco as quickly as possible. He ran up to the dorms, threw his invisibility cloak on and sprinted to the hospital wing, where Draco lay, alone and unconscious, under a heave of blankets.
“No interview or anything. One of our waitresses left suddenly and we really needed to fill her spot. It’s pretty simple. You take this note pad here, go to the tables, ask what they want to eat or drink, then bring the paper to the kitchen. They’ll give you a number. You need to remember which number belongs to which table and take the order to the customers when it’s done. You got all that, Draco?”
The blonde was a complete mess. Hair patches torn out and quite visible, a black eye, a jagged scar down his jaw, a clear limp, and blood all over his damn clothes and a box.
To his surprise, Draco's face was expressionless and he said nothing. For a moment he wondered if the blonde had even heard him. Then, he decided there was only one way to find out. Holding his breath, Harry started to ask.
"yes."
"I-I'm g-giving you a ch-choice, Draco. I-I" he started, then burst into tears. The blonde felt bad for him, but he didn't know what was wrong and he was still angry at Harry for locking him inside, so he did nothing to comfort the other man and waited for him to continue.
"W-what do you need?" Harry asks, trying to bite back a sob at seeing his perfect Draco so broken and sad.
So, Harry took the diary and soon discovered it was a regular one that only resembled Riddle's. He would've just left it behind right then and there, but this mystery person seemed like he was looking into Harry's soul and writing out the words that Harry never dared speak. His ideas. His words. His past. Everything he wrote was just too close to home for Harry, so he kept it. It made him feel less alone, less of a freak as they always called him.
"I am sorry you went through that, Ron, but my friend is a muggle. It isn't the same for him. In fact, I am fairly certain it is just a physical thing that turned into this. If that damned hospital would've been more organized I am sure he wouldn't have stayed like this very long, but I am going to fix it."
Suddenly, Harry caught sight of the psychology section and a thought came to his mind. He thought of Hermione and how she always turned to books for answers. He never used to do that, but desperate times call for desperate measures.
Even through the glamour, Harry could see how fragile Draco really was and he couldn't help but wonder if this would be the end if he would truly lose his closest friend if the blonde would really die because of a quidditch match. The idea was so utterly ridiculous that Harry would laugh if he didn't feel like crying his eyes out.
Harry quickly grabbed the letter from Draco's hand, crumpling it and sent it flying to the ground where a puddle of water lay. Draco watched, in horror, as the letter became drenched, the words ruined.
Draco grimaced, almost as if in pain, then turned towards Harry with that sad smile.
Hurriedly, Harry crumpled the papers and vanished them, determined to make this day perfect and convince Draco to stay.
“Are you deaf, too? Wow, deaf and stupid. You must’ve been a real handful for your mommy,” the guy said loudly, causing the others on his table to snicker. Draco’s stress levels went through the roof, but the blonde was still telling Harry not to do anything.
"Thank God." he whispered, "I thought I killed you."
He smiled sadly and left as Draco returned to his sitting room feeling more confused than he ever had before.
Harry immediately let go of his hair and vowed to stop the habit, at least in front of Draco.
" I-I know you don't owe me anything, b-but I thought since you felt obliged once, maybe you'd h-help me again." he sobs out.
"It's a pregnancy test." he heard draco whisper shakily. And time seemed to stop afterwards. Everything became real, then. If draco has a child he'll stay with that suspicious guy that he's afraid of and he probably won't ever see Harry again. Harry shook his head, held his breathe, then cast the spell, keeping only one eye open. He sighed in relief when nothing happened, then cast it twice more to be sure.
Draco's heart stopped when Harry left the alley the Friday prior.
Harry started to pull at his hair. He didn't know what else to do. Draco was lying to him. His draco had never lied to him. Or maybe he did have a substance abuse problem and just maybe that problem was behind all his horrible thoughts and feelings. All the addicts he had come across in investigations and such felt the same. Harry never thought he'd say this, but he really hoped draco was an addict and that he would be fixed after withdrawals.
"Please don't go! Please stay! What do you need from me to believe that you aren't a burden?" Harry cried out, "Gods, Draco, it hurts just thinking about it. You're so far away from being a burden that using that in the same sentence as having you stay with me is ridiculous. I want you here so badly, it takes everything I've got not to do this everytime you leave on Fridays! I.. It hurts to think I am sending you off to your own doom everytime, and Scruffie and I cry for hours after you've gone every week, but I've respected your wishes and I've done as you've asked for so so long, could you please, just please, do this one thing for me? Please stay."
“Yes,” Malfoy said firmly, still keeping his professional tone, “It was often used by homosexual male purebloods so they could bond with a female and produce heirs. That was before the birthing gene was found to be present in both genders, rendering the whole process of false marriages and the potion useless.”
"W-why didn't y-you tell me?" he whispered a moment later, "Why d-did you just l-leave me like that?"
"but- I don't believe he really loved you at any point in your lives, darling. I am sorry."
For the first time in forever, Harry was extremely grateful that Draco couldn't read his thoughts, that he didn't know the truth. Harry just couldn't be honest with him about this. He couldn't tell him that it would've been better had Draco been gone.
"could.. Could you come in here?"
"No." he said and was sure no amount of forced smiling would take the hurt expression off his face.
Draco shook his head no, then got up and followed Harry out of the place.
The witch’s eyes snapped up to meet his. Harry squirmed as she glared at him for ten whole seconds with her mouth agape.
“No!” Harry answered, suddenly feeling ridiculous, then murmured “I was kind of hoping you’d cure him by lunch.”
"Draco!"
"I'm worried about you." Harry told him softly. Draco continued to stare at him incrediously.
"you can't heal me, Harry. Not from this. Not this time." he had whispered, looking at his left forearm and sniffling. Harry followed his gaze and moved to yank back the sleeve only to be held against the walls with a wand to his throat.
Upon seeing Draco's furious expression and hearing his huff of disapproval, Harry chuckled and dragged the protesting Draco into the place, then sat him on a very comfortable booth, sitting right next to him and effectively trapping him for the day. Draco sunk lower into the booth, trying not to feel anything towards Harry's persistence.
He suddenly went very stiff, which gave Harry his answer.
"w-wha?" he heard draco ask, looking through droopy eyelids at Jashua, who was now straddling him while Draco laid on the floor next to their small table. Jashua's eyes flew to the water glasses on the table and he laughed, a dark sound.
He frantically accioed the box and pressed a cookie to Draco's lips.
Harry nodded slowly, attempting to smile, though he felt like his heart had just broken in half at the scene in front of him. Draco was losing consciousness. He could die. He wasn't even afraid. Harry wasn't even sure the blonde was aware of his presence anymore. Draco was going...and all he cared about was the sodding letter that said his father was proud of him.
Draco’s heart stopped. He wouldn’t be able to get away. How could he not have thought this through? Ron would definitely know it was him. Only one death eater didn’t leave England after the kidnappings and that was Draco Malfoy.
"What dish does Harry Potter like to eat at midnight on Halloween? Who were Harry Potter's lovers until now and how far did he get with each one of them? Where does Harry Potter live? What pet does Harry Potter have and what is his name? What name does Draco Malfoy like to be called even though he wouldn't admit it to anyone? What date, time, and place did Harry Potter lose his virginity?" the blonde asked seemingly all in one breathe. His voice had mixed emotions. Relief, happiness, panic, frustration, and fear. Most of all fear.
to the boss about it.
Zombies was a better description than patients when it came to the people being 'treated' inside the ward. You'd almost think it was a prison with the bars on every window and the guards at the exit. Every single spot of the ward was under surveillance and there were no gardens like the movies represented. The place was entirely closed off, the people inside doomed to become even more depressed. Harry heard a patient begging to use the phones with the nurse refusing and others were jittery and unstable from withdrawals. That was nothing compared to the showers and toilets that didn't have doors with nurses watching over the patients who used them.
With a loud sigh, Harry threw his cloak onto the bed and turned to look at Pomfrey.
"what?"
The furious look on the blonde’s face was replaced with a sad expression. He sighed, nodded his head to acknowledge what Hermione had said, then leaned over the brunette to give him a kiss on the forehead.
"of course!" he said cheerfully, jumping at the opportunity to do something, anything for draco.
"Please tell me you've seen it, Myrtle!" the blonde cried out, tugging at his sleeves and looking around the bathroom frantically.
"If course I did, Harry. There's Charlie, Bill, Fred, George, Ginny, Percy, mother, and-"
Draco didn't even realize he was trying to shake his head, that he was shouting at Jashua, calling him a liar, telling him Draco wasn't his, that he was screaming and attempting to kick the larger man. Only when the lights came on and he caught sight of Harry's lifeless eyes and his motionless body sprawled across the balcony with his limbs twisted in unnatural angles, did he stop for a second, a loud scream threatening to erupt from his throat. It never got to. Jashua seized the opportunity to shut him up with a potion. Draco didn't recognize it, but that was a bad sign. He could almost taste it on his tongue. A distant memory. A potion he wasn't aware he injected. The fertility potion....
After an agonizingly long bath, where Harry had to jerk Draco awake multiple times so the healing potions could continue to take effect, the blonde was, by all appearances, brand new. But Harry wasn't an idiot. He knew Draco would need some time before he would reach the mental state he'd had merely hours before, when he had left the alley happily and looked back at Harry once before proceeding down the street.
Immediately, and without guilt, Harry activated the locator spell and what he realized made his heart sink. Draco had been pacing around their alley for an hour, surely hoping against hope that Harry would show up. How was Draco up on his feet? Harry only felt a small percentage of the blonde's pain through the spell and it was enough to make him want to collapse on the floor right there and sleep forever. It wasn't a calming thought. Harry apparated into the alley instantly, only to find that it was empty.
“H-Harry, I don’t feel so good…”
"I've simply looked everywhere for it! I don't know how I could be so stupid!" he wailed, then placed his face in his hands again.
"You are!"
" No! Listen, you said you like this. Y-you said you were happy.
The sensation started with him having a tingly feeling in his groin. His pupils were dilating and his skin was feeling a bit warm. He let out a sigh of relief, realizing that it wasn't that bad yet. If they got away from each other now, neither of them would do something they’d regret. Just as Draco started walking towards the back door, though, he felt Harry grab his wrist in a death grip to stop him. The blonde froze.
Harry kept smiling despite his panicked thoughts. They hand exchanged rings and were now holding hands, waiting for the officiate to officially bond them
“I’ll report them, I will. Don’t worry, Harry. We’re getting all that money back. They won’t get away with this.”
Harry sighed, pretending to give in. Pretending was easier and he just wanted Ron to go away.
4. Take a bubble bath together
Despite himself, Harry started shaking with an assault of emotions for the blonde. Guilt, passion, love, gratitude… Draco was everything to Harry...Absolutely everything. He loved Harry since Harry was a year old and he never stopped, even when Harry was an arsehole to him. He's so forgiving, so cute, so loving, so generous. He's perfect and Harry was hurting him.
“What did you just say, Draco?” he asked as gently as he could. He must’ve misheard that, right? Why would he suffer because Harry was upset? Harry wasn’t even upset at him!
"Draco..." Harry whispered. His voice steady.
"Draco. This is me. Look." he whispered and wouldn't do anything until the blonde turned his head and focused his red-rimmed eyes on Harry.
There has to be something they missed, Ron. I am fairly certain. Even if there isn't, perhaps muggle depression is-"
"You need to get help." harry told him, firmly, not knowing how much longer he could keep the overwhelming concern and rage out of his voice.
"Y-you're serious?" he shouted, "You think what he did was alright?"
Harry couldn't help it. He started yanking at his hair violently.
Harry hadn't seen that coming. Sure, the blonde had been very reluctant to share so far, but him staying so silent while his thoughts ate away at him was more than Harry could stand for.
Harry opened his mouth to say so when, suddenly, Draco spoke with a shaky voice.
"You know you don't need to do that, right?" he asked the blonde, who looked confused, "I don't want you to pretend around me. I don't even want you to be happy anymore. I don't want anything from you, just honesty, alright? Could you give me that?"
Draco insisted on going to a muggle bookstore, not wanting to risk being seen and sent to Azkaban. Harry quickly agreed and they apparted to a bookstore that Harry knew was far from Draco's house. He didn't want to risk Jashua seeing them. He didn't know want he would do if he saw the large man and wouldn't be held accountable for destroying him.
"you think I would just shrug when your head is blocking my entrance?" he whispered viciously and Draco's blood ran cold. He had been away from magic for so long, he had trusted Harry to know what to do. Now, he was going to die. Jashua, having pleasure at Draco's squirming, continued to whisper through a smile." You had a wizard cast something on you. Wasn't that bright though, or he would've known to replace the memories. The question is who. Was. It?"
"Why is my son not awake?" he asked the witch. The coldness of his voice made Harry shiver. Pomfrey actually glared at Lucius.
Draco shook his head, as if that would make everything magically go away. This couldn’t be happening. Maybe it was just another one of those completely fabricated stories! But where did they get the picture then? Maybe he wasn’t that hurt! But then, why was Ron screaming like that? Weren’t they done being friends?
"Draco.." Harry started, not really knowing where he was going with this. He continued to fight the urge to pull at his hair as his hands dangled uselessly at his side. He sat on his knees next to the blubbering blonde not having any idea of how to make him feel better. They needed to discuss treatment options for Draco that day. Harry was determined that they do. He was still hopeful. This was just a setback. It had to be. Draco had to be alright.
With that, Harry was gone. And draco ran out of the place like it was on fire, then found an abandoned alley where he pulled opened his bag, looking for the shard of glass he had acquired the night he left knockturn alley. His heart sank. One of his ingredients had rotten, effectively ruining the others. He tossed them all out with a sob, then yanked his sleeve back and started to cut deep lines along his mark, the physical pain not relieving him of the hurt look on his Harry's face, but giving him enough strength to get up afterwards and leave the alley, searching for more ingredients.
"it's funny." draco said loudly, breaking his hysteric laughing, "I used to think so, too. Somehow, I thought when it was all over, we would have so many and I would come home from work and find more kids running towards me than the entire weasley clan and they would look up at me with green eyes and say 'daddy's home!' and we would build a fort together. Gods, I was so stupid."
"You don't know, do you?" Jashua whispered, then laughed out loud. "Well, let me ask you another question, then, do you recognize this wand?"
" What I am saying, Mister Malfoy, is that it seems wild magic is at play here. Someone is trying to hide this boy's injuries and they seem to be doing a fine job of it."
Draco was pouring Harry’s coffee for him and smiling at the brunette’s constant praise, when an angry voice suddenly sounded through the room.
Suddenly, Harry had that same look in his eyes. The one Jashua has when he was furious and about to attack Draco. The blonde didn't know why he suddenly felt afraid. This was what he was used to, but was it, though? No. This was new territory. At least he knew what Jashua would do, how far he would go, and that he would never do anything that would cause permenant injury.
With that Harry pulled Draco out of the office and shut the door behind them. The blonde noticed the glares he was getting from everyone around them, but he didn’t care. He was more worried about Harry and his sudden surge in confidence. The blonde was almost certain that Harry hadn’t told anyone about his sexuality. Why would he do and say these things right now?
End of the first part! Hope you liked it! Pleasant surprise/ obvious fact: the whole second part is up and has been since the first part was even a thing, so if you're interested in what happens next it's there. Thanks for sticking by the story and for all the comments, kudos, and such. They really do make my day.
Harry's hands instinctively went to hold Draco, but the blonde whined and looked scared so Harry moved his hands instantly.
"Stop it, you prat! I am serious" Draco yelled, but was laughing, "one second you were fine... Then you just fell over. What was I supposed to think?"
“It should work, then.” Harry murmured to himself, not realizing what his words implied until he had said them. He looked up and saw that the blonde had a look of sadness on his face.
The memories kept flooding his brain, playing out right in front of him. Draco making Harry treacle tart every year on Halloween and talking to him about his parents while they ate it. Them fighting over some ridiculous thing then having angry make-out sessions afterwards. The first time they had sex and how nervous draco was and how reassuring Harry was. Draco sneaking into pivet drive after all his letters went unanswered for a week, only to discover Harry locked alone in a dark cupboard under the stairs and then having Harry tell him what the cupboard was and how terrified he was of it. Draco refusing to leave Harry after that, but Harry insisting that draco staying would make everything worse, so draco left him a key to the cupboard to keep on himself all the time in case that happened again. Draco knew Harry would be too scared to use it, but that having it with him might make him feel safer.
Draco's shoulders slumped and Harry knew he was beating himself up for misunderstanding Harry.
“Yes you did!” the brunette said.
Harry burst into tears, but it was too late. Draco was gone and Ron was gone and his parents were gone and Sirius and Remus were gone and Harry was alone. He had chased away his Draco, his angel, the best thing that had ever happened to him and he wasn't so sure he could get it back this time.
"What are you on about?" Harry asked Ron, panicked, and pulled away to look at his friend's face. Ron gave him a confused look.
Harry was just about to close the diary in frustration. He was nowhere near finding the mysterious owner and he was going to be late to class, but then his name caught his attention in the next entry and he simply couldn't put the notebook down now. He made his way to DADA, placing the notebook descretely behind a textbook to appear as if he was studying, then continued reading through class.
Draco took a deep breathe and leaned as far away from Harry as he could.
Draco simply shook his head frantically and desperately wiggled out of Harry's hold, clutching his head and trembling all over. He wasn't saying anything and Harry needed to know what was going on in his head. He needed to. Draco had that same look in his eyes, that same crazy look he had had the day before when he was threatening to take his own life and Harry was going mad trying to speak to him. His words were falling on deaf ears and Draco seemed to not be there anymore.
Harry got up and cast an alohomora on the lock, which clicked open instantly. He pushed open the door to find his draco curled up in a ball laying on his side on the cold tile floor in the middle of the bathroom.
“What will you do?” Hermione asked, the apprehension clear in her tone. Ron seemed to think about it for hours before he spoke.
"I-I know, I-I am s-so stupid. M'SORRY."
“Y-yes?” he asked, hesitantly, ready to run at any sign of trouble.
Draco felt he owed him that much, so he nodded, then added quickly.
"Going to make breakfast." Draco told him slowly like it was the most normal thing in the world for him to make Harry food while crying his eyes out.
"No!"
“You’re joking, right?” she finally asked. Harry shook his head.
Both older and younger draco blushed for entirely different reasons.
"You heard me." Draco whispered looking at the floor. "I never sent you any replies. You must be mistaken."
Harry could only watch in horror as the blonde ran, stumbling, and made it into a stall just in time to vomit everything the brunette had just forced him to eat. Harry closed his eyes, and, though it broke his heart, he knew there was no other way. Someone had to know about this, about everything. If this continues for a few more weeks, the blonde would be dead for sure and Harry couldn't let that happen. He had to tell Pomfrey everything. She would know what to do, even if she has to force nutrition potions down the blonde's throat. Harry didn't care how she would go about it, but it was the last day of the semester and Harry was out of options.
His thoughts were all over the place. He tried to remember everything he wrote in that blasted notebook, carefully laying out perfect lies to cover every topic. But, he had been writing in it since he was eight and he couldn't remember all the secrets the journal held, only the major ones. He decided that, if the worst does happen, he'll tell his father that the journal isn't even his.
"I could unpack it and you could eat it here. It's fine. I can wait. I want you to eat it." Harry told him with a wide smile on his face and a speck of hope in his beautiful, green eyes.
Harry swallowed down his frustration and rage. He needed to help Draco now then break everything in the house later on.
"why don't you ever learn you little piece of shit!" he yells, but the blonde is in too much pain to concentrate. He fell to the ground on his side, thinking of how stupid he was to return to the market.
He could already see Draco's thoughts clouding his judgment, convincing him that this was a bad idea, that he doesn't deserve this, doesn't deserve Harry. He had to beat them to his Draco.
Draco shook his head then smiled in return, less forcefully this time. "I don't lie. You know that."
"Alright." the brunette said softly, hating himself for what he was about to do, "Can I have your wand, please?"
Draco seemed to take Harry's actions as a refusal. Desperation crept into his voice as his sobs grew louder and his arms wrapped around his stomach while he was pulling at his sleeves.
Afraid he'd say the wrong thing and people would stare at him silently like his father's guests used to.
"And didn't you think I deserved more of than explanation than 'leave me alone'?" he snapped. For once, Draco didn't flinch or draw back. He blinked, then stared at harry open-mouthed, confusion clouding his dull gray eyes.
"Alright. I suppose if you're that adamant and foolish to keep me in your life, I could agree. We could meet here in a week."
I know the chapters are short, but keep in mind, this year passed as a blur to Draco and he wasn't really there for most of it, so that made Harry too confused to be able to get moments with Draco. Even the guilt Harry feels will be short-lived. This is happening during the beginning of a war and Harry isn't too busy for Draco, but he caught on that there was a serious problem too late and Draco was gone before he could do anything. Anyway, I think the last chapter will wrap up the story pretty well and set up the transition for the second part even better.
"Of course I understand. I was the one whose name got called out. I understand-"
Draco's pov.
“I hope your loved one will be alright,” the guy, who apparently knew about St. Mungo’s, whispered, then gave Draco a slight smile and left.
does something so revolting in my apothecary. Didn’t think you’d get caught did ya? Well them magical cameras ain’t for nothin’. Get out,” the old man gritted out, pointing at the door. Harry held his hands up in surrender and sighed, then rubbed his temple. His headache just wouldn’t go away.
“Draco, I am telling you that you didn’t make me angry in any way. Does that make you feel better?” Harry asked, not knowing what else to say or do to make Draco’s suffering disappear.
Harry didn't have a moment to think about it. All he knew was that the universe had given him a second chance and he couldn't blow it again, so he cast the locator spell wordlessly and wandlessly with only one thought in mind.
“Please, just take what you want and leave.” he heard the blonde say shakingly.
Draco heard the incantation and suddenly ran to the door, trying to pry the knob off it, and started clawing at the wood frantically, while screaming at Harry to let him out. That's when the tears finally fell down Harry's cheeks.
"You aren't even listening to me now, Harry. Don't you see! I told you it doesn't matter what you think. I will believe that I am a burden regardless. I will not be made to feel that way again. I am sure you don't like me anymore. My presence is causing you some sort of pain, even if you deny it."
“Isn’t that the place you’re asking for?” he asked, then gestured at a near, dark alley that held the store. Draco could have kissed him!
"I told you to leave him alone!" a slightly older man yelled at Harry. Suddenly, draco was beside him, holding his arm back, talking sweetly to him, and Harry finally understood. Draco had a boyfriend. He didn't care about Harry. He was in the past. Harry didn't know why that thought never crossed his mind before. Just because he had had difficulty moving on, doesn't mean Draco did too. But what they had was special. Wasn't it?
When Harry returned to the sitting room, he opened his mouth to apologize for the thousandth time when suddenly draco lunged off his side of the couch and onto Harry, clasping their lips together, holding onto Harry desperately as if he never wanted to let go. Harry sunk into the kiss and melted. It had been far too long. He knew that much. He had been so frantic in moving them to the bedroom and getting Draco's clothes off that he had forgotten to undo the mind-link spell. He only noticed when his hand flew to Draco's groin and he was assaulted with a memory that wasn't his own, a horrifying one. Suddenly he was standing in the corner of a small sitting room, watching as Jashua cupped draco's crotch through his trousers. Draco moaned and shook his head. It wasn't a sound of pleasure. Somehow, the moan sounded panicked.
“No!” Harry said instantly, then more calmly “No. I don’t want to. This doesn’t bother me, Draco, honest. Or, it does, but not for the reasons you’re thinking. I-I just hate the fact that you’re in pain. I just want you to get better, alright? It’s not about my comfor-”
(See the end of the chapter for
"I am going to throw away anything you don't eat, just to be clear. Maybe just to spite you. So, it's your choice really."
As the potion started to take effect, Draco felt unbelievable pain in his abdomen, but refused to make a single noise or move. He deserves this. He was killing his own child. Father would be so disappointed.
Harry looked deep into his friend's eyes. There was no understanding of what his words were doing to Harry. This must be how Draco felt all the time around everyone. It was horrible.
“Er...Yeah. It would.”
"I don't know what you mean." Draco said slowly, as if speaking to a confused child. This only made Harry angrier.
Older draco wished that Harry hadn't shown him this memory. It was one of the actions he had most regretted, but he understood why Harry did. The only feelings radiating off Harry were sadness, desperation, love, hopelessness, and concern.
" w-what are you talking about?" Draco said aiming for confused, but achieving a high-pitched whine. Another thing Jashua hates: emotions.
Younger draco took his hand and older draco felt the triumphant feeling Harry did at helping draco forget his ordeal.
Those were the only words Draco could think of as he watched past events play out in front of him.
“But I am not angry with you!” Harry said frantically. Had he not been holding the blonde’s hands, he would’ve shook the blonde to try to get some sense into him. Why would he think that Harry was mad? When did the brunette ever insinuate that?!
"Y-you can d-drop the act, M-Malfoy. I know you don’t care about me!" Harry screamed, both his hands clenched at his sides, then looked at the ground and sniffled.
"Alright. You can do the spell." draco said without even realizing it. Then looked up to see Harry wiling widely and nodding his head. He realized Draco and Harry's emotions vanished from within the Blonde. But, he still felt something linger: happiness with the choice. He didn't know if it was harry's or his own.
