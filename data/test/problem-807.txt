"Draco, you ready to go?" Upon seeing the three bags, Harry shook his head. Sirius, on the other hand, decided to be more vocal.
Before he could stop it, their lips connected in an explosion of sensation and Harry practically melted into the arms holding him up. Gentle hands caressed his face as Draco’s tongue slid against his lips asking for entrance. He allowed it without a second thought and lost himself in a wave of sensation.
At three in the morning the next day, Draco had to wake him up again. His blood curdling screams were almost too much for him to bear any longer, but he bit his tongue and resisted asking what he was screaming for. He knew that if he asked questions, he'd be less likely to receive an answer from the distraught man.
“Can I ask you something?” Harry motioned for him to continue. “Have you really never been interested in anyone?”
Draco watched Harry disappear into the bathroom and sighed. He let his head hit the pillows and felt them fluff up around his hair, creating a light cushion that supported his head's weight. He watched the dust against the white ceiling while he thought.
“That’s the logical way of thinking. But with purebloods, it’s a bit different. You have to go to a Seer to have the match approved first. Then you draw up a marriage contract, something to entice your desired partner to entertain the idea of you being together seriously. If they decline, then you either have to redraw another contract after a year or you can move on as well. They don’t have to decline, but they don’t have to accept either. Acceptance means you can move forward with the courting without any further hubbub. If they don’t do either, they will present you with a counter proposal. Within it they’ll include what they don’t like about the original contract or they’ll add clauses for the courting period. It doesn’t make much sense, but that’s the way it is.”
In his peripheral, he saw Harry practically melt into a puddle on the floor. They hadn’t put their wings away since arriving at Hogwarts, preferring to leave them out. It was more of a display for the other than for the other students or themselves.
It was the single best feeling he had ever felt when Draco slid into him. Sure, it burned and wasn’t at all the slight twinge he had felt at first. But Draco was gentle and took his time, something that Harry greatly appreciated now. Slow thrusts gently rocked him in just a little bit at a time until he was finally sheathed in Harry completely. The two moaned and lost themselves in the sensations, both practically screaming when Harry’s prostate had been hit and then again when they came.
"Well yeah...he's a great friend..." He could tell that he didn't give the right answer. "Did I miss something?"
All in all, it was pretty interesting and before Draco even thought about taking a shower he was sitting in the nearest chair and completely enraptured. After a few minutes, he decided that he was confident he could figure out the simpler spells without the hints and notes written in the margins.
"Why yes. So he is. I never noticed." Elizabeth giggled and Draco fought the blush he felt trying to spread up to his cheeks.
The next morning, Harry woke at five-thirty on the dot. It was a habit that not even Severus had been able to break him free of. He got up and started to make breakfast for himself and Draco when he didn't know if Draco would even be up before noon. He didn't have to worry about that for long though, as the man in question walked out of the bathroom at exactly five minutes after six.
They were refined. More modern. Black rims that were no longer circular framed his eyes and no longer magnified his eyes to impossible proportions and a slight silver design was barely glinting in the subtle light on the arms of the glasses.
Walking through the bathroom to Harry's room, he wondered if his classmate had managed to get dressed for bed or if he'd have to do it for him. He was slightly relieved and a bit disappointed that he didn't need to help the other into his pajamas.
They had only been on their honeymoon for two weeks when Draco suddenly bent over clutching his stomach and crying out. It had hurt, a lot, and he knew this was no mere joke. The baby was coming, and it wanted out.
The rest of the afternoon was spent getting manicures, pedicures, facials and they followed it all up with another massage, this one being a deep tissue. Draco's main purpose was to make Harry as boneless as possible so he'd be in a blissful state for the rest of the evening, and hopefully throughout the rest of the week.
He was enthralled. Harry’s cute little hole practically chugged the wine as it came from the bottle and Harry did nothing but moan wantonly and wiggle his hips just a hare. It didn’t take long for Harry’s words to start to slur and it took even less time for him to cave and give the man what he had been begging for. His cock slid home in Harry’s ass, the way eased by the wine still in him. Somehow the idea that Harry was stuffed full of wine and his prick made him harder. It had been impossible to hold off his orgasm, the idea that his semen would be sloshing around in Harry was too much for him to handle. He pulled out and quickly inserted a rather large plug to keep it all in him. Harry would complain in the morning, the one thing he hated was the feeling of a cleaning charm that far in him but Draco didn’t care. Harry would do as he was told.
“I am the only one allowed back here, and Mr. Malfoy says you have some...special fitting requirements, yes? No need to worry, I’m sworn to eternal secrecy as to who needs to be fitted for what.” Harry blushed, and looked at Draco.
The girl had long hair for an infant the color of a mahogany desk, her wide light blue eyes staring up at everyone and everything. The boy had blond hair and half-closed grey eyes. The Healer continued to clean up, and watched Harry and Draco.
"If you don't take the time to go over there and make up with that boy, so help me I will come back to life and castrate you!"
The two were enthralled by how magical Professor McGonagall had made their accommodations. Finally tearing his gaze away from the magnificent view, Harry looked up at Draco. The two smiled at each other and made their way into the living room where they settled into the couch.
“Well, what was the joke?” Draco made a face. “Oh come off it Dragon! Your father has had to do worse to me just so we could have you, I can handle a simple joke.” At this, Draco’s mouth fell open. She rolled her eyes and waited patiently for him to explain.
“Harry, you do realize how serious this is, right? You would have died if I hadn’t sent you any food.” Harry nodded. He knew how bad it was, but he didn’t like admitting it. After all, it wasn’t like they were holding a gun to his head or raping him or anything. Other people have dealt with worse, so he had no place complaining when others could benefit from the help more than he would.
“Non taken.” After all, he’d been told his entire life he was a freak. He didn’t need a stranger to tell him that, he already knew it.
In an act of pure impulse, Draco put the necklace on and as soon as he let go of the clasp, a piece of silver parchment appeared in the unclosed box. He lifted it up to read it.
He had managed to stop himself by grabbing onto the door jam and he just gazed at Harry. He was in his veela form, his cheeks tinted pink and the air around him crackled with excitement and anticipation.
“You mentioned you have nightmares a lot a while ago so I figured it couldn’t hurt if you had him around. I thought it might help. At the very least, it has a silencing charm on it so you don’t have to worry about silencing charms failing in the middle of the night. Just put it on your bed and it’ll charm the whole bed for you.” Harry’s tentative smile turned into a large grin as Harry hugged him.
Neville had been hired to take care of the landscaping, and Harry had laughed for weeks after Narcissa had changed her mind about the flowers she wanted growing outside of the french doors that lead to the patio in the back for the third time in a week. Neville had been so frustrated with her, he started shouting at her to make up her bloody mind before telling him what she wanted because he wasn’t going to be uprooting a single plant after that day.
“But that’s exactly it Harry!” Hermione’s voice rose with excitement. “You’re magic has been getting stronger. When you perform more complicated spells, the air around you practically cracks with how badly it wants to be let out. And simpler spells are becoming harder for you to control. Go ahead, try to make that goblet float.” He did, and the goblet soared much higher than Harry intended for it to go. It returned slowly, after Harry had reigned in his magic a little. “See? That’s your magic trying to burst out. I would be incredibly surprised if you don’t have an inheritance coming.” Harry’s eyes widened. Has this been why everyone was avoiding making him upset lately? He had pushed it off as the news spreading more rumors about him and stress.
Harry was found in a complete state of panic, sitting in a corner with his arms around his legs and his forehead resting on his knees. The poor thing was shaking and Lucius wasn’t sure what to do but he knew he’d better do something or Cissa would have his balls on a platinum platter.
He expected Draco to leave him then, but he didn't. Instead he felt his arms wrap around him tighter. They held him to his chest, something Harry wasn't too sure what to think of. His body relaxed, but his mind was supplying a stream of unpleasant memories, all of which made him cry even harder. He didn't know what to think anymore.
The sight scared him so much that he started to cry. He couldn't handle being around someone like him because he knew that this fragile friendship could end up breaking his heart. At least with Severus he knew that the older man would never go out to find another to be with and would, therefore, never leave Harry. Draco, however, could leave him. Anytime he wanted, in fact. And that scared Harry more than he thought could ever happen.
“Ah, an interesting theory. You know,” he pulled out a rather thick book that looked ancient and plopped it down on his desk before flipping through it. “I haven’t had to look into such a thing but now that you ask, I think it’s high time I take a peek. Don’t you?” Twinkling blue eyes went back to the text, quickly scanning the pages.
“Draco? Can...would you show me your wings again?” His voice was small, much smaller than he remembered it being.
They exchanged letters far more often than Harry had originally restricted them to, mostly because he was going stir crazy in one room day in and day out. He’d caved on the second letter, telling Draco not to wait until the next week to write back, but to keep the correspondence between midnight and four in the morning to prevent the Dursley’s from finding out what was going on.
“So I don’t have to go to the hospital wing. Ron doesn’t like it when I’m there. Says he doesn’t like being concerned for me.”
“I guess not. I mean, some people are attractive, but I haven’t found myself drooling over anyone or anything like that.” She sipped her tea as she thought about his answer.
He winced as his voice cracked, confusion sprinkled on his face. He couldn’t figure out why Narcissa Malfoy was at Private Drive, or why his bed was so soft. Or why she was holding his hand when she was clear across the room.
“Well I think it’s brilliant. Too much, sure. But if you’ve got a bunch of people over it’d be great.”
When his breathing was somewhat normal again, Harry looked up at Severus-he was searching for some form of condolence, for someone to tell him it was all right and that he wasn't insane or weak.
“An early wedding gift. It’s been in the family for generations but I had it embedded with the strongest magic he could find. It will heat against your skin when people who mean you ill will are near and will cast some very impressive shields if someone sends a curse or jinx towards you. And while he thinks I’m unaware of this, Draco also had a master charmsmith add a crafty piece of magic to ensure that anyone trying to hit you will be thrown several feet from you. As long as you are wearing it, you will be safe.” He watched as Harry opened the gift with unsteady hands, although the shaking had reduced significantly.
“For how long?” They both winced. Neither one liked the idea of spending so much time away from the other.
"Everything will be alright. I didn't mean to scare you like that." The admission confused Harry more than his internal battle he had with himself earlier did.
“Alright look. I know I’ve been a right prick since you’ve known me. But I can assure you with every ounce of my being, that I have changed. My family has personally taken Harry in, and I’ve come to be able to call him my friend in the last month he’s been around. I’m sure Harry would love to tell you why my family was the way we were at school.” Harry nodded.
“Ever since then, Lucius became bitter. He started climbing ranks and doing whatever he could to get as close to Voldemort. His plan was to murder him when he was weak, until he realized what the diary was. He approached Severus about it, knowing how Severus cared for Lily. It was then that he defected and Severus told him everything there was to know. Lucius took house elves with him to destroy the horcruxes, and he managed to get most of them. Do you know what they all were, Harry?”
“I-I j-just don’t k-know wh-what’s w-wrong. I-I’m just s-so s-sad,” He tried to keep talking through the sobs, but the sorrow eventually won out, effectively cutting his speech off.
“Oi, it’s not like I’ve thought about it much! Just passing thoughts every now and again. More curiosity than anything, I think I’ve thought about kissing most of the students in our year at some point or another.” Harry stomped down the brief wave of disappointment he felt.
Normal mating rituals can, and should, be continued once they no longer need prolonged skin to skin contact.
Everyone else started filing in, and even from across the room Harry could hear rumors about him and Draco. He just waited for Severus to pass out the schedules so he could leave. A throat clearing from behind him made him look up.
He took a particularly large gulp of pumpkin juice and suddenly saw the dining room at Malfoy Manor. Specifically, he saw Narcissa smiling at him. Juice flew over the table and Harry choked, causing the picture to vanish. That couldn’t have been his imagination, he was sure of it.
"You THINK?" Harry brushed a hand over his forehead and tried to calm him enough to get him to push like he needed to do.
Parents were hugging their children and teenagers were running to each other, no doubt to catch up after the summer. Like Diagon Alley, spells were used in large quantities and made him grin. He almost couldn’t believe he was going to a magical school to learn how to do all sorts of things! But most of all, he was entirely too grateful to be leaving the Dursley house behind. He only hoped it wasn’t a dream.
He thought about how he'd never be able to get another charm for his bracelet and let the tears fall as they formed. He didn't bother trying to stop them and before he knew it they stopped.
The rest of the group stood and made their way to the gardens so Narcissa could show off a little. Once the two were alone, Harry sunk to his knees and crawled to Draco’s feet under the table. Unwilling to wait any longer, Harry reached up and unzipped Draco’s bottoms. He inhaled, taking in the crisp clean smell of Draco before swallowing all of him down.
"I need you to take up Mission X." He couldn't believe it. He got it! This was what he wanted so desperately he lost sleep over it. This was it.
Harry walked down the aisle trying to get to his office, but kept getting stopped every time he made a three inch advance. It was like no one wanted him to get his paperwork done! Just like at school, no one ever wanted him to just get his homework done, they always had to give him something else to do. Like, say, defeat a certain dark wizard. It still baffled him that hundreds upon hundreds of grown witches and wizards made just a boy defeat the most powerful wizard their world had known-he had just been a kid for Merlin's sake!
“As you all know by now; Voldemort is dead!” The roaring cheers were deafening, even with a door between them and the hall. “Yes, yes. A time to celebrate indeed. I will expect the prejudices to disappear this year, as there is no longer any excuses for any of you. It is the time to put our differences aside, and to lead the Wizarding World into a new era! One of kindness, acceptance and tolerance. And leading us into that era are none other than our very own Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy!” The hall burst into cheering again and the two took that as their cue. They joined the professor in front of the students, smiling at the support she was sending them. The cheering died down much faster, the student body shocked into silence.
“Well mate, an inheritance is supposed to turn you into a magical creature of sorts. One that has the physical capability to control more magic with less thought.”
Christmas came around without much change, other than the cravings and morning sickness leaving him. His mood swings stopped too, and for that he was grateful.
"Why you terrible person! I will not lose my shape and I refuse to answer the second as I'm already dirt to society. I'm slightly offended. No, actually I'm really offended."
“Uh...not really. But there’s only one key to my vault at Gringotts and I don’t really spend that much.” If Draco hadn’t been brought up with impeccable manners, his jaw would have dropped.
"You want a shot?" Malfoy nodded and Harry poured him one. He was so overwhelmed with happiness that he didn't see Malfoy grimace at his smile.
He was fully prepared to beat himself up for being such a crappy friend when he thought about Draco. He must not be such a terrible friend if Draco had stuck around, right?
That was always the conclusion he drew. Of course, Harry thought he was overworking himself too. Now that Draco was pregnant and the brunet didn't have to work, he actually had time to sit down and think. He had the time to think about the curse he endured that promoted the growth of his baby.
Draco took a cool shower and promptly fell asleep, not even awake enough to worry about the next day, let alone set his alarm.
I have gone to have morning tea with Severus. You will be able to find me in the Great Hall once you’re up. Take your time, we do have forever after all.
Right then and there he decided that he needed a stiff drink. He had promised Hermione that he wouldn't drink as much as he had been, but today had tried his nerves to their ending point.
“I’m merely disappointed in how easily our son caves to negotiations. I would have thought the Malfoy name was better than that.” Narcissa didn’t even have a chance to reply before Draco had stood.
“I…” His cheeks flamed. His emotions were scrambling to snuff out his conscious thought, but they were failing.
“Finally ready to try the new one?” Harry’s eyes widened. He hadn’t meant to grab the new collar, quite frankly it scared him a bit. But he needed to get over his trepidation and here he had the perfect excuse.
It was passionate at first, and slowed into something kinder-sweeter. Draco was holding Harry’s head to his, still holding him up in the air while Harry’s legs wrapped around his waist even tighter to prevent himself from falling.
After a delicious meal, consisting of a very fresh fruit salad and strawberry lemonade, Draco got into his crimson silk pajama pants and settled down to practice more spells.
"Oh it was rich. He just now came to an important realization and it made him pass out in shock. I'm never letting him live this down!" And try as he might, he could not get another word out of the painting, no matter how many times he tried.
"He didn't give anyone else the case because I told him I'd stay to the end of my contract before quitting. Although at that point it's pretty much just not resigning up. He in turn told me after I got a steady partner that wouldn't leave I could have the case." Harry sat down in his chair and pulled out a bottle of rum.
"No. I want a guy like that in my life too. Sometimes I can't always hold others up, and I've found that most women are too helpless for my liking. They always need someone to lean on. Newsflash: I need someone to lean on too." Harry nodded.
"Just as soon as you write down their names on these cards." Harry wrote them down in his sharp script, and then they left via floo. They put the babies to sleep in their crib by the bed and they laid down with sighs of love between them. Harry knew that it would be hard to take care of two babies and his husband, but he knew that he was glad that he wouldn't have to ever work. He knew that his family would never be able to even make a dent in the vaults he had access to. He couldn't wait to watch the kids grow up and to watch his husband grow old with him.
"Patience dear. Patience." He gently opened Draco up and licked the pink pucker he found there after flinging the boxers elsewhere. He shuddered underneath him and Harry licked harder, loving the heady taste and the reactions he was pulling out of him. He tired of just licking and pointed his tongue, pressing it against his opening and waited. He tensed, but slowly relaxed, turning into putty in Harry's hands. He loved it.
“Right, but I wouldn’t be starting a relationship at that point in my life. If I’m busy supporting someone who truly needs it that I’m close to, then learning to support a relationship at the same time isn’t going to result in a good relationship. And that’s not fair to me or the other person. But if I’ve got relationships that are already in good standing-for example, us-I wouldn’t shut you out just because mum fell ill. I’d rely on you to help me. But I most certainly wouldn’t expect an almost stranger to help me through that.”
"Draco?" He looked up immediately, not worrying about the hope that drained from his face, quickly becoming concern when he was met by a worried expression. "I...I'll do it." Draco's mouth gaped; he hadn't expected him to accept, no matter how much the blond had wanted him to.
To say that Ron was livid was an understatement. He’d heard that Harry and Hermoine had been studying with Draco and practically lost his mind over it. Hermione had appeased Ron in the common room, telling him the three had been paired into a group by the teacher and needed to get the project done. In the dormitory, however, Ron laid into Harry.
“No time for dawdling. Now don’t let go of my hand and take a deep breath.” He did and was suddenly met with a wholly uncomfortable squeezing sensation and fought off the urge to be sick when it ended. “Rather unpleasant your first few times, but you’ll get used to it. Now come along, we haven’t got all day. We’ve a tight schedule Mr. Potter, the train leaves in only two hours!” He let himself be tugged and lead around a magical street with signs everywhere claiming the name to be Diagon Alley. Not having the faintest idea where they were in the country, he let himself gaze on all the magical things around him. Spells being cast without so much as a thought, items floating midair and changing colour to attract the attention of passerby, cauldrons stirring themselves with strange concoctions inside...he could hardly contain his excitement.
“I’d be delighted to. Now, I believe you have someone to talk to? It’s gotten quite late. I’ll have dinner sent up for you both.” She gave him a knowing smile and shooed him off.
"If this is any indicator, then what do you think?" Harry watched as Draco led his hand down to his crotch and pressed his hand into the hardness. Harry rubbed gently, teasing him. He watched as Draco pressed his head back into the pillow, biting his lower lip.
"I'm fine. It's just the DNA changing in the baby, it took me by surprise that's all." Harry nodded and pulled him in closer. They fell asleep holding onto one another with smiles on their faces and one hand each on Draco's stomach.
"So, how about we share the bathroom connected to these two rooms and then you can pick which color you want?" He agreed and chose the royal purple over the navy blue. They both went their ways, and soon, both were sound asleep.
A deep pain seared itself through Harry like a knife. It was unlike anything he had experienced before. It tore through his heart, blinding him. He cried out, curling up into himself on the grass with tears flooding his face. He never cried out, his voice was paralyzed with the pain and loneliness he felt.
"Are they in jail?" Harry nodded and upon seeing this, Draco sighed with relief. Another question, one that was bothering him since he woke up, made its way out of his throat. "Why did you stay?" He couldn't fathom why someone who he used to hate and who only worked with him now would stay by his side for so long. It didn't make sense to him. Harry had no reason to stay for him, there was no need for him to be here. It wasn't like Harry was the only one that could save him. That's what the Healers were for.
And it was with those thoughts that the raven haired teenager started walking down the corridors to the dungeons.
"You got up late. Eat it on the go." Without waiting to see if Draco was following, Harry started jogging down the path. Of course, Draco had no choice but to follow him if he wanted to keep his job and therefore rebuild the Malfoy name, so Harry didn't worry about him following.
“Oh please, don’t be so dramatic. Here, get dressed so we can go to sleep.” Draco tossed Harry some silk pajamas and Harry cleared his throat.
“That’s why it was so big to begin with, I think. Back when it was built it was common for people to travel to balls and huge parties but no one wants to aparate drunk for fear of flinching and hangover potions hadn’t been perfected yet so they only worked with a small portion of the population. Therefore, everyone would stay at wherever the ball was and aparate home in the morning. I like it though, I’ve got plenty of privacy away from my parents when I wish for it.”
The bag he left with was a significant one. It held bottles of ink in silver, gold, invisible, black and dark green. He had bought himself plenty of rolls of parchment, all slightly different shades of beige and ivory. He had even splurged and bought himself a few basic quills for class and two really nice ones. One was from an eagle, regal and black. His plan was to use this one for acquaintances and business. The other was made from one of Draco’s feathers. It had fallen off one day and Harry had held onto it ever since. It had a nice weight to it, and the silver sheen was nicely accented by the sky blue vein running down the length of it. He wasn’t even sure that they would be able to make it into a quill, but the owner made sure to do it quickly for him. Somehow Harry knew Draco wouldn’t be upset, but he still wanted to keep a few of his secrets for the time being.
“For the final time Father, negotiations are to bring two sides to a compromise of which both can live with. I have no problems negotiating. I’m much happier with the contract I agreed to than the one I sent this morning. Now if you don’t mind, I have some things to attend to. Goodnight.” Draco got up to leave and Harry was quick to follow suit. He hadn’t even left the dining room before Narcissa was lashing into Lucius about always needing to have more control than necessary.
"YEAH YOU CONNIVING BITCH! I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU FINISHED ME OFF, MAKING IT TEN TIMES HARDER FOR ME TO MEDDLE IN MY GODSON'S LIFE! WHY, MY OWN MOTHER-" and so the picture ranted for another minute or two.
Silence was the only thing he could make out when he tried listening through the door. Slightly panicking, he turned in frantic circles looking for his wand until he realized the bathroom was silenced. He suppose that made sense, as it was a hospital. Patients wanted privacy and the Healers would be damned if their patients couldn't take a shower without everyone knowing that.
"I was planning on spending the day cleaning. Why?" Draco shrugged. He didn't mind much, and had given Harry the choice to pick what they did. He especially made sure that Harry didn't feel pressured. That was a task, but apparently unnecessary as he still wanted to stay home. They remained there for quite awhile before Harry spoke, a nervous and worried edge to his voice.
Of course, if anyone knew this, they'd go straight to the Prophet and divulge all of his secrets. And then his scary factor would go down the drain. Witches would swoon and wizards would try picking him up. No one would take him seriously, and then he'd be stuck with paperwork for the rest of his contract.
“You’re lonely.” It wasn’t a question, more of a statement. Harry’s body had been so preoccupied with healing itself inside and out, trying to heal sixteen years worth of wounds, that the mate aspect of it all hadn’t been something they thought to discuss. Normally it was a slow progression, the loneliness. It was supposed to be a gradual change, something that took a year or more to develop into a bond with their mate.
He was going to be a father...mother...whatever. He had his own child in him to love and cherish and pamper. He would be free to be a kind, open person to this baby, not fake a cold heart. He swore that he would make sure this baby had the most love any baby could possibly handle.
The counter top ran the length of the wall. It had two sinks, a bonus for brushing your teeth. There was even two doors that let to separate toilets in case they both had to go, or had multiple friends over. There was even a huge tub built into the floor just next to the shower.
Instead he heard a timid voice ask if they may come in. He looked up through his fringe at the newcomer and was startled to find that it was Draco Malfoy. A very, very different Draco Malfoy.
The two worked tirelessly for the next hour, and when Harry thought about their next class he looked at the schedule. They both had another free period after this and they weren't anywhere close to being done with all that Harry had learned. Of course, it would have helped if Draco hadn't asked as many questions as he had.
“We’ll talk about that later. For now, let’s finish on the subject of marriage contracts.” She cleared her throat and started moving parchments around to show him a few sample contracts. “Now once the courting period is through, you revisit the marriage contract. Both parties will have a copy to edit as they see fit and then you’ll both meet with whomever is representing you. A mutual friend of both parties is also there to act as mediator and to create a version with all the edits and compromises. Once that’s done, you all reconvene to go over the final edits again and make minor adjustments as you see fit. And this can happen as many times as necessary-your father’s and mine took nearly seven meetings to finally hash out all the nitpicky bits.”
"I don't want pity. I just want to make sure that you don't make the mistakes I made." Harry got up and started to leave the room. He turned in the doorframe. "And Malfoy? Be sure to be up tomorrow morning by nine. Preferably dressed." He laughed at the slight blush on the pale man's cheeks and flooed home.
“Come now, I’m not completely a coldhearted bastard. Only my family gets to see my nicer side. Now, on with the chain and we’ll get you cleaned up.” A mild healing spell later to make Harry’s face presentable once and the two made their way to Harry’s wedding.
For instance, when he found out that Harry had never eaten a cherry before he had made a point to have an entire bowlful of cherries on the table with their dinner that night. Turns out that Harry didn't like them, but it didn't phase Draco in the least. He was bound and determined to find out exactly what Harry did and didn't like.
"I did?" The fact that anything could scare Moody baffled him, even more so that Kingsley told him he was precisely the thing that could frighten him.
She placed her wine glass down incredibly softly, giving her husband a sweet smile as she did so. In a dangerously sweet and soft voice, she asked “May I ask what’s bothering you so that you’re ruining dinner?” Draco swallowed his mouthful of food, all colour gone from his face.
"Well, I was thinking about going to Luna's. She may have been a little airy in school, but she makes a mean meal." Pleased by the delighted look he got, he kissed Draco's hand and went to bed, as usual.
"Harry..." He watched as the other stopped walking around aimlessly to look at him. "You can't always tell people what to do like that. It'll just make them talk more. I don't think that was a very good idea. I know you were upset and mad that they would fight over us like that, but that's the way teenagers are. They take sides and fight and then a week later everyone's okay again. You'll see, it'll all just blow over...It always has in the past." He stopped his mini rant when a paper was tossed his way.
‘As for your little joke about starving to death; that’s not funny. If you didn’t have me to send you food, you would have likely starved to death already this summer alone. You and I are going to have a little chat about this when I see you. And I WILL be seeing you. Write down the address so Father can come fetch you and your things.
"I...I was just a kid! I didn't understand what was doing on back then. I was just rejected friendship by the most famous wizard ever! I was hurt and I did what I was taught to do. I'm sorry for ever doing it." Draco put the canvas down and walked into the tent with his head down. While he walked away, he could hear his older sister start to talk.
“Harry?” Draco was softly knocking on his door. “Harry, can I come in?” He tuned into his veela hearing and heard a faint sob. So faint, he thought he didn’t hear it until it happened again.
And so Harry launched into his accomplishments and disappointments. He told him everything he could think of and just said what his mind was thinking without monitoring anything. In hindsight, he probably should have at least thought about what he was saying when describing things when he realized what he'd been saying.
"I'll do whatever I please, thank you very much." Harry's eyes flashed with a madness that was rumored around the ministry. All of Harry's partners had switched to other departments or other partners because of that mad gleam he had when he was angry at someone. It rarely ever came out unless Harry was making an arrest or battling someone. No one but his partners ever saw that gleam and they never talked about it if they could help it. Until now.
"I only ever did that one once and that was because I didn't know how bad it tasted. I never did it again. So Remus asked me what I wanted from life. I told him basically what you just told me, except I wanted kids too. Or at least one kid. In a roundabout way we ended up having the best sex of my life, not to mention all the sweet things we did for each other.
"So...Malfoy are you okay?" The other man's sudden concern threw up a few red flags for Draco. He wasn't sure what to think about the sudden concern, especially the enemy of his childhood.
“So when you died on your birthday, at four in the morning, Lucius called a meeting with Voldemort. He brought that slimy bastard in here to show him you had died. But what Voldemort didn’t know, is that when a horcrux is a living being the rules change a little. Your magic is what changed you, Harry. And a person’s raw magic is enough to kill a horcrux on its own. So your magic, while it was assessing you for your inheritance, discovered the horcrux and killed you in order to kill the horcrux. You gave us quite the fright there with that one, you were gone almost three minutes.
Harry was struck dumb. Draco, Draco Malfoy, his partner, Draco Malfoy, was pregnant. Pregnant and dying.
“Wait, doesn’t the courting come first?” His mother sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose. “I’m sorry, I’ll listen.”
“I understand, it’s incredibly delicious. I imagine I did the same thing the first time I had it.” The two smiled at each other and moved on with their breakfast.
Sure enough, Harry was shifting impatiently after a few minutes. Draco was leaned over the table, picking up random things to munch on as he listened to Blaise and Pansy gush about their summer. He straightened up, just enough to look at Harry and bit into the piece of fruit he had in his hand. When he saw Harry blush, he winked at him and politely dismissed himself from the Slytherins.
And no wonder couples constantly spent time laying about in each other’s arms! Perhaps he enjoyed it so much because he was starved for someones-anyone’s-touch, but he didn’t ever want to move from his current position. That was, until Draco woke up.
"Elizabeth Malfoy at your service. And you're Harry Potter. Pray tell, why have you never been able to talk to me?" Her whimsical voice was pleasant to listen to.
He saw Harry looking around with even more confusion evident in his eyes. Draco almost growled-was the boy so deprived at his house during the summers that he really didn't recognize any of this stuff?
By the end of the week, Harry was restless. He wanted to get up, to do something. Draco suggested chess, reading in the garden, studying, even offered to square off in a match of Catch the Snitch but nothing sounded like enough.
“I know as well as the next person that the Potter fortune is vast, but please don’t waste your money on dragonhide gloves like I did. At best, they held out as long as two normal pairs would have. You and I fly different from everyone else. We fly hard. Sure everyone does during a match but we fly hard all the time. I’ve had the best luck with basilisk skin so far.” He held up a pair of glittering emerald fingerless gloves. “I’ll warn you, they’re pricey but very much worth it. I bought a pair last year and they only wore out over the summer.”
So he took off next to Harry at a light jog, keeping up with him easily for a short distance. And then the pain started to settle in and forced him to slow even more. Harry noticed and stopped.
“For the things Ron does. And says.” Harry looked into his lap, his hands twisting together nervously. “I don’t like the way he treats you. It’s not like you start any of it.” Shame curled up from his stomach, making him feel quite warm in his cheeks.
"I'm here because I care about you. You're a person with feelings and I'm sorry I ever doubted that." He watched Draco relax slightly, and silently thanked Merlin that he hadn't botched his apology up.
“We’re too drunk to be having this conversation right now, drink that.” The potion kicked in remarkably quickly; you could see the exact moment Harry sobered up in his facial expression.
Harry quickly concluded that the hesitation was from surprise and dragged his tongue across his bottom lip, elating when the blond opened up without any hesitation whatsoever. They stayed like that for several minutes, leisurely mapping out the unfamiliar terrain slowly. Only after Harry had again retained control, he let his hands roam from the silky hair down his neck, making the other man shiver and lean into him. He kept going, over his shoulders, and down his arms to his hands. He twined their finger together and lifted them up, gently pushing back making Draco lie down.
But...hadn't he caught himself admiring the way his muscles strained when he was doing push ups? Hadn't he thought on more than one occasion that Draco Malfoy was maybe, just maybe, sexy?
“Hermione?” She managed to tear her gaze away from the tomb once she was at the end of the sentence she was reading. When she realized Harry was the one to try to grab her attention, she blushed. She wasn’t used to ignoring him in favor of a book while they were eating.
“Bite me, Harry. Bite me while you ride me.” He held Harry’s head to his neck and Harry could hardly contain the inhuman growl that escaped his chest before he bit down on Draco’s neck.
‘Mum’s gotten into a few arguments with me lately. I think she’s under the impression that I’m lonely and that I’ll never be bonded-or even married-to anyone if I keep going the way I am. Personally, I think she’s off her rocker. I’ve still got time to find someone to fall in love with; after all, it’s not like I’m going to keel over.
Draco continued to send Harry small gifts until early December. They went out every Friday night for a romantic dinner and on Saturday they would go out for lunch. Sunday they would catch up on homework and have a nice candlelight dinner in their room. Harry insisted on cooking on Sunday, wanting to show off his culinary skills to his veela. He wanted to show him how good of a submissive he could be, and without Draco having to tell him what to do, or how to do something.
The homework assignment was given and the page for the practical work written on the board. Harry and Draco were over halfway done with the assignment by the time the class was dismissed.
“Well, students who don’t go home for the holiday break, or-or students who can’t go home over the holiday break...is there something like that for the summer?” She looked thoughtful as she sipped her tea.
Ron had ribbed him endlessly about it, making his heart twinge with guilt, but he stood his ground. He didn’t want to watch a bunch of idiots risk their lives for some money and a trophy.
“Please Sir, I’ve been so naughty while you were away.” Deciding to go with it to see what happened, Draco nodded for him to continue. Harry widened his knees, putting his leaking prick on display. “Oh, so naughty. I know you told me not to come while you were away but we have all those toys and I just couldn’t help myself.”
“Oh yes, she wants to know all about you apparently. I think she’s going ‘round the bend just a tad, but you didn’t hear that from me. She’s paranoid that I’m going to end up single and alone all my life if I don’t date anyone at school and to be quite frank I would rather resolve a few things first before I start showing my interest in anyone.” Harry nodded. After all, it only made sense.
He watched him run the whole way, and promptly passed out when he saw him stop by the tree and start doing push-ups on his own.
"Relax. I'm going to get pajamas, I'll be right back." Draco left the room and came back a few moments later dressed for bed. His legs were covered with some silky material and his chest was hiding underneath a black wife beater. Harry could have drooled, if he was awake enough to.
Suddenly, Harry’s throat was parched. He reached out as Draco passed by again and grabbed his arm in a vice like grip, yanking him closer. Draco, surprised by the sudden movement, leaned into Harry’s chest. He knew what Harry wanted, and offered his neck to make it easier for the angel to get better access.
Tears coursed down his cheeks, and he didn't even bother trying to make them desist. Harry reached over and dried his face, wiping the liquid away softly. He looked up timidly, worried Harry would change his mind after that little display of affection. Which posed several questions to Draco.
"Harry we're in the best salon and spa in the country. Now, I'm bound and determined to make sure that you're happy, and trust me. I know it sounds girlish and petty, but you'll feel absolutely amazing when we leave here." Harry allowed himself to be guided to a changing room and Draco told him what he needed to do. When he got a look of apprehension, he sighed and lifted his arms in exasperation.
Harry, very loudly and deliberately, cleared his throat. The two swallowed and turned slowly to face him.
All of the gifts had come with only one thing written on a piece of parchment: 'Curtosy of your secret admirer'.
“Don’t worry, I’m not offended. I’ve spent the entire summer telling my son and my husband that they’ve been awful to everyone around them for years. It took some heavy persuading to convince Draco, but he caved first. It took Lucius more time to truly see the error of his ways. They’re both very embarrassed and they both want to make it right. Particularly with you Harry. They’re ashamed that they have treated you with such hatred, that they could treat anyone with hatred. It almost tore Lucius and I apart.
All noise was stopped as Snape stood to address the student body. The only noise was the loud banging of the double oak doors slamming on the walls behind them as Harry walked in. He stopped and made eye-contact with the one person who had kept in touch with him over the summer and helped him through his problems enough so he could pretend he was all right in front of others.
“Exactly,” Hermione picked up where he left of as he had started stuffing some more food into his mouth. “All of them are some sort of humanoid creature-so it’s not like you’d turn into a hippogriff. In recorded history, there’s been mostly veela, some vampires, elves, fairies, angels and there was even a dark angel once. All are creatures that can morph their appearance to look like nothing has changed with them.”
“Father had looked into it a little further for me. He said most dark angels have to spend up to two weeks apart. He did say that when a dark angel has a mate that is another creature then it depended on the creature they were mated to, if they were submissive or dominant and how much power they possess. With all the bits of information Father gathered, he thinks we’ll be on the shorter side, needing only a few days.”
They spent the entire evening with friends and family. The politicians had left shortly after the reception meal as apparently mornings were most important at the ministry. Draco’s parents had invited most everyone in their family tree, most of which Draco had met while visiting their France properties but didn’t know that well. Harry had invited a few friends but mostly spent the entire evening with Draco. There were too many introductions to keep track of and even more handshakes to be had. Congratulations flowed like a river and as the night went on Harry got better and better at accepting them.
He looked up after a few minutes of not feeling the body move away from him and was shocked to see Harry's face so close to his. They were just a moth's wing apart, and yet so far away. Draco heard a small whimper-like noise come out from the back of his throat before he felt soft lips press against his.
“Strip, go get your collar and kneel by my chair.” Harry didn’t waste time and simply grabbed the first collar his fingers landed on before kneeling by Draco’s feet. The collar left his hand and Draco smiled.
He dragged himself upstairs to his room and stripped to his boxers in a sleepy haze. He then promptly fell on top of his sheets and fell asleep.
By the time they were done with the debriefing, it was dark out. They left, and Harry told him that he would meet him at Malfoy Manor.
"Hi Draco. Planning on getting up sometime soon?" He chuckled as Draco jumped up and started throwing on clothes. He clearly wasn't aware he was doing it in front of him otherwise he would've demanded he shut the door or he would've gone into the bathroom he could see that adjoined to his room.
Lucius and Narcissa seemed to think that wallowing in his own mind was the best punishment for him. Draco and Severus stood there, shell-shocked. The looked at each other, both knowing what the other was thinking. How could they have treated him with such hatred when he had been on the brink of breaking from the stresses and horrors of what was supposed to be home?
"Congratulations. Baby one is a beautiful girl." She handed the bundle to Draco, who hadn't registered the fact that she said 'baby one'. Harry did, though and looked at her with questions in his mind chasing each other.
Draco opened the gift, much more carefully than he wanted to, and hesitated when he revealed a flat, rectangular, velvet box. He looked up into the eyes of the father of the life growing in him and gathered all the courage he had just to open the unoffending thing.
“While this may sound harsh, and forgive me if it does, but whatever hold you believe he has over you is an illusion. You know just as well as I do that no one invited him here. While he may think he can get his hands on you again, I simply won’t allow it. Draco would never allow it. In becoming a part of our family, you inherit the protections our family can provide you; that includes against Mr. Weasley.” Lucius reached into an inner pocket in his robes and pulled out a small box wrapped in silver and black paper.
"I need them. If we can keep these two motherfuckers in prison, I need your memories." Harry just sat there, and finally nodded in defeat. He did make that obligation before becoming Draco's partner.
Harry kissed him as he pressed in gently, stopping when just his head was in. Draco's face showed pain, but he soon relaxed when Harry pressed kisses across his face. They continued like this until, inch by inch, Harry was finally sheathed in the tight heat.
“Ron, just stop. I’ve got to get my homework done. Besides, I thought you wanted nothing to do with me anymore.”
“I-do you really mean that?” Draco looked as gobsmacked as Harry had felt when he first opened his mouth. But he was coming to accept that what he had said was not only true, he had meant every single word of it.
At one point, Draco actually yelled at him so convincingly, that Harry broke down and sobbed. He refused to leave his side, however, and apologized repeatedly until Draco calmed down enough to tone his yelling down.
"Okay. Well I can tell you what's going on with him now since I know what spells were combined based on previous tests.
He had sponsored these gardens, and therefore he could have anything marked off-limits and could have the best florists and herbologists decorate any area any way he wanted.
“How come you’re trying to help me?” He narrowed his eyes in suspicion. Draco Malfoy didn’t do anything unless it suited Draco Malfoy. His eyes only narrowed more when the blond laughed.
“I know it hurts, believe me I know. Your mate is out there Harry.” He gently ran his fingers through the boy’s hair while he held Harry against his left side. “Either your mate hasn’t met you yet, haven’t turned sixteen, or they’re like us and going through these changes as well. I can help you through this as best as I can until then.” Harry sniffled and pressed closer into Draco’s chest, relishing in the closeness. It was easing the pain, although not by much.
"I can't. The baby, remember?" He looked put-out but nodded anyway. Harry gently kissed his way down his neck, leaving little marks here and there. Draco pulled at Harry's clothes and they both chuckled when he pouted at the cloth for not coming off fast enough. Deciding to help everybody out, they undressed themselves down to their boxers and laid back down next to each other after walking inside to Draco's bed. Harry moved a strand of hair away from Draco's eyes.
He told his house elf to take the night off and proceeded to make dinner himself. Pizza sounded good, so he started mixing the dough. He had just tossed it up in the air for the fourth time when he heard the fireplace roar to life, signaling that someone was trying to fire-call. He answered it.
His eyes were closed, focusing on stretching all his muscles out before he tried to stand up. It was then that he felt the smallest of tugs. His eyes flew open and the feeling dissipated immediately. He closed his eyes again and focused. This must be what they were talking about, the bond with my mate. They must be a year above me then, if they’re seventeen now. He made a mental note to have Hermione do some digging to see who had today as a birthday.
"Almost late boys. Sit down." Harry searched, but he only found two empty seats-on the opposite sides of the room.
He gradually fell asleep on the grass while watching the stars. His dreams were filled with Draco; their dates, the way he smiled, the way their lips felt pressed together, the softness of his feathers…
"Draco?" He looked up at Harry's soft inquiry. "I'd like to take you out to dinner tonight." He nodded and asked what he should wear. "Wear the silk robes. It's warm out, and they'll not rub on your skin too much. I know cotton can irritate your stomach now."
“I-I just thought it would be easier for our school work if we spent the holiday together instead of cutting out time from our classes or becoming a distraction to everyone else. I understand if you don’t want t-” his speech was cut off when Harry kissed them. It was gentle, slow and understanding.
Draco stumbled out of the fireplace, his cheeks reflecting the color of the flames around him. Note to self: don't floo anywhere when you're already nauseated.
Draco, without needing to be told, grabbed a plate and placed a portion on it before passing it to Harry with a slight blush on his cheeks. Realizing he had groaned in quite the obscene way at the flavour, he apologized and took another bite of his oatmeal.
Harry presumed it would have comfortably fit a mammoth if they hadn’t gone extinct. To say it was huge was the understatement of the year.
“Oh is he? Well I hope whatever is on his mind isn’t too much of a bother for him. Come, are you joining me for tea?” Draco nodded and she transfigured his outfit to match hers. He smiled and sat down on the sofa with her before they tucked into their cups.
“Yes my angel, I would be honored and delighted to court you.” He kissed the top of Harry’s hand gently. “Be prepared, angel. I have many things I wish to do for you.” Harry blushed and they continued inside their room.
He heard the door open again and tensed just a little when he felt the bed dip behind him before relaxing completely as an arm slid under his pillow and another was wrapped around his waist. Harry felt himself smile the smallest amount and before he drifted off once more. He couldn’t be sure, but he swore he felt Draco’s lips graze the back of his neck just before sleep overtook him again.
“Oh piss off, you love sarcasm and don’t even try to deny that!” Draco rolled his eyes and shook his head.
"Oh don't bother thinking he got it from me. He most certainly didn't. I was in Azkaban until your third year and I was on the run up until your fifth year. He only got to really know me for the better part of six months all together. But it was some if the best time of my life."
They spent their remaining days at Malfoy Manor laying in bed together. They tried to practice spending time without touching each other but each attempt was met with a dull ache that grew after a few minutes and would build into searing agony. They simply couldn’t handle it yet.
That's right, folks, Harry Potter is rumored to be gay! Some of his closest friends swear that he is, as do many other students in Hogwarts. 'He's always checking guys out...Never leaves the boys alone...Hated dating girls...' and more were all confessed to this reporter.
Draco noticed that Harry went to sleep faster than he did because his essay was written and left out on the table with his bedroom light off. He had a brief moment of jealousy, but it didn't last long. Harry did spend the entire summer with Severus Snape after all.
"Enter." Harry swung the door open and walked in, clearly not caring if the blond followed or not. "It's time." Harry's eyes widened. Was Kingsley really giving him the mission he wanted? Wanted so much he had done extensive research outside of work and made an entire three folders of information just from what he got in two weeks.
To his surprise, he saw her handing a potion to someone with shocking blond hair-what would Draco need from Madame Pomfrey at this time?
“Wait, you have an entire wing of this place to yourself?” Draco nodded and smiled when Harry’s jaw dropped.
Harry picked him up and hurriedly apparated to St. Mungos, straight into an empty healing room. A healer jumped and hid all trace of shock upon seeing the pale man in Harry's arms. She had him set him down in a bed and ran several spells, when a team of seven or eight ran in, all slightly winded from the long run.
And the worst part about that entire envious monster problem he had-he couldn't say a word against it. He had to abide by the courting rules. He didn't exactly know for sure what the reprimand was for not following the rules, but he shuddered to think of the consequences. After all, the rules had been made long before Dark Magic was considered Dark. Who knew what kind of magic bound them to the rules?
It must have been charmed, as it was cold when it touched him but quickly warmed much too quickly to be normal lubricant. It sent shivers down his spine.
Really not much had changed in his routine since coming back to school, other than the school part. He woke up at the same time every day, went to bed at the same time, ate at the same times...the only thing he wasn’t doing now that he was at the manor was sleeping with Draco next to him and listening to Draco read fiction novels. Now Draco was prone to reading textbooks to him, although he’d promised to switch back to the fiction novels during the weekends when their homework was done. Harry was still bitter about that decision, he wanted to know what happened to Scarlett already!
During dinner Hedwig glided down towards Harry. She was carrying a rather large package. He gave her a large chunk of his meatloaf and opened the package.
Leaning forward to play with Harry’s wings he whispered, “I thought you were a virgin, my angel.” Harry nodded, moaning at the sound of his voice.
"Don't go. Please." He couldn't voice much more than that, but as he felt the body next to him disappear, he sat up. "You don't have to...I mean...You can sleep in your bed..." He knew he looked utterly clueless as to what he was getting at, but he truly didn't want to be left alone and he didn't want to freak Draco out. There seemed to be no middle for him with anything.
"Draco!" Rushing to the blond's side, he cast a few diagnostic spells. When they all came back black with a crimson edge, Harry paled. He packed everything by a wave of his wand, not caring if their things got mixed up.
“It’s the smallest wing of the house and really I only use the library, bedroom, sitting room and en suite. I think my parents are hoping I’ll have more use for it when I start having people over. Personally, I think this sort of lifestyle intimidates people. Too much space for typical families.”
Ron did most of the talking on the way to Hogwarts. He talked incessantly about his family and it seemed to Harry like he resented a lot of his older brothers for always being better than him at everything. Harry, quite annoyed now that the redhead was doing nothing but complaining about his family, was about ready to tell him to stuff it and that he shouldn’t take them all for granted when a bushy haired girl opened the compartment door.
“Come now Cissa, you’ve seen the two of them. You’ve seen how much happier Draco has become, how well he was handling the loneliness before we took Harry in. I think you should talk to him about it. The more informed he is, the more likely the two of them can heal faster. I do hate to see them in pain like that.” She nodded, more to herself than anything.
He was beaming at his mother, and suddenly felt a slight tug inside him. He turned to face the manor, still radiating joy. His father was in the window of his study, waving and smiling with pride.
The next few weeks he spent going to Severus and asking him for advice on what to do about it and the teacher had given him the best idea ever. A secret admirer!
“Of course it is.” Draco gave the bear a single spray with the cologne that popped into existence at Harry’s request and Harry hugged it to his chest before burying his face into the faux fur again.
This was how he liked Hogwarts best. It was quiet, the walls splashed with the moonlight from the windows and Harry loved it. You could practically hear the castle breathing magic. While he walked, his mind wandered. He desperately wanted to know why he was having such a hard time falling asleep.
Some time later, he had stopped crying. The pain remained, but it was becoming easier to think through with the sharp smell of grass assaulting his senses. As his mind gradually cleared, he reached out to his bond. It was still there, but it was fainter than it was when he fell asleep.
Crossing his legs, he managed to snap out of it to look at Malfoy. Now that he was up, he wanted answers.
"Yes sir, thank you." Harry covered his smile with a predatory smirk and swooped out of the room so fast he looked like a sexier, deadlier Snape. And he knew it.
“Bring me what you used and then tell me what you did.” Harry got up and sped into the bedroom before returning with his arms full of things.
He didn’t know just how long he would be here, but he hoped and prayed that it would go away. It was all consuming, but eventually one thought came to the forefront of his mind. What if they hear you screaming? He did his absolute best to suffer in silence, for fear of incurring their wrath. He had gotten quite good at silencing himself while he was dreaming or unconscious, and he wasn’t about to let that ability go to waste.
“You will be going with them for the beginning of the summer while I call upon my favors. But rest assured, I will be getting you out of their house before your birthday. It isn’t a sure thing that you’ll get an inheritance, but I do not wish for them to find you in a weakened state if you do.” After a few more pleasantries, Dumbledore dismissed Harry for lunch and called the potions master to his office to square a few things away.
It wasn’t unpleasant, but it wasn’t nice either. Just weird. Nothing had ever gone in that direction before and he wasn’t sure what to think about it. That is, until Draco started moving his finger in and out.
The next morning, Harry awoke by himself. He stretched languidly but took pause when his hands started gliding over what felt like small patches of silky velvet. He sat up to look around him.
"And you felt the need to sit on an uncomfortable chair when you could have been at home? Or staying late at work?"
"What's wrong?" He hovered over him, hoping to kiss him senseless after he reveals his worry, to kiss the pain away. He figured that as long as he has the chance, he might as well use it.
Him! Draco Malfoy! The boy who never stood up for himself against his parents. The teenager who always sought the people who were most likely to break him. And a fair few pretty much had. The man who couldn't say no to his father when he was asked to join in on the group who answered to only one master. He was disgusted by himself, and yet Harry Potter, the exact opposite of Draco, wanted to court him.
The wedding didn’t take place until December of the following year. Harry had spent months renovating the property his parents had lived in the first few months of their marriage before they had to move to Godric’s Hollow to go into hiding and then Narcissa and Hermione spent the next year planning for their wedding to take place on the property.
"Poor Remus never knew what hit him. He already knew he swung both ways, but it was kind of a shock for him when he figured out he loved me too. I never brought it up, but he did one day.
Draco had to leave under the rouse that he needed to use the loo to try and hide his pride that Harry had trusted him enough to start eating more than he usually did. It made him happy that he wanted to listen to Draco, even after all the years of hell he had put him through. He went back fairly quickly.
No one, not even Harry himself, wanted to admit that he was clearly suffering post-traumatic stress. And that would be built from his aunt, his uncle, his cousin, Voldemort, from Dumbledore and from his heritage not coming and from his godfather dying because of his stupidity and everything else in his life. Right down to him not acting on how he felt.
"Mr. Malfoy was hit by a powerful Dark spell, that was never intended to be used in the first place. What it does is it makes a male produce woman's organs and one egg. Being that he also keeps his male organs, he basically fertilized his own baby inside of his body.
As his memories shot by, one after another, he noticed they were fading to something else. His body burned, like he was engulfing certain parts of himself in flames. His shoulder blades, head, and chest got the worst of it. His entire body was uncomfortable warm; hot even. It increased in strength as the memories faded away into the blackness, the blackness became white hot with the intensity of the pain increasing.
“Even if it’s Draco?” That gave Harry pause. He didn’t like that Ron went out of his way to bully the Slytherin, but the repercussions of not participating were bad. The one time he refused to take part in taunting the blond had resulted in Ron screaming at him and digging at his every insecurity before giving him the cold shoulder for over three weeks. He tried to keep everything as tame as possible after that, even going so far as to sneak peeks at the map Headmaster Dumbledore had given him with his father’s cloak to ensure they could avoid Draco Malfoy on the way to class.
He walked around opening doors and listening for any sign of movement. Coming upon the last door in the hallway, he listened at the door before hearing a slight shuffle of cloth. It sounded like silk but he couldn't be sure.
After dinner, they were promptly kicked out of the dinning area. Harry stopped walking as he felt a hand on his shoulder and was led away to the private rooms of Severus Snape.
"I wanted the same thing once. And...I guess it's time you had the whole truth." Upon seeing Harry's confused expression, he continued. "I wanted someone to hold me at night, and someone for me to hold when they're upset. I wanted another man, someone who would understand. And I fell in love without realizing it. We both did when I was set free from Azkaban.
Eventually so many people had asked if they could really fly Draco started whispering to Harry so quietly only his ears had a chance of hearing.
Madam Malkin went to work taking note of every little detail. She even had Harry flap his wings in slow motion so she could fit him even for when he tried flying out. In the end, they left an hour and a half later, empty handed with the promise that the colors and designs Draco had discussed with her would be owled directly to Harry once they were completed. They paid and traveled down the shop fronts. They got their school books from Flourish and Blott’s, as well as a few others for Harry to enjoy on his time off, and stopped at Eeylops Owl Emporium for some food for Hedwig. She really enjoyed the last batch of food that was made for her, but she seemed to pick around the beetle eyes.
"The intense pain is caused from the fact that babies aren't naturally meant to be made like this. He will die, along with the baby, within the next week if someone else doesn't manage to...re-fertilize, if you will, the egg his body made.
He expected to see outrage, shock, disgust, upset, hurt, betrayal, anything like that. Instead he saw a moment of shock and then...happiness. Like that deep-inside straight-from-the-heart-and-soul happiness. Happiness and love mixed in so they were one and the same emotion. Harry felt intruding and a little more than slightly confused.
“I’m in the papers?” Ron’s eyes grew wide and his jaw practically dragged on the floor. The sound of the train whistling snapped him out of it, followed by a jerk as the train started to move.
“Only you can know for sure darling. But it’s worth paying attention to. Promise me you won’t use magic for a few days.” He promised and she left. Draco managed to lift Harry up so they could move to the bed. It was late, and they needed sleep.
"I could and I did for a little while. But my memories were so distorted, so clouded by instinct, pretty soon no one could make heads or tails of my memories, rendering them useless. I've simply been through too much to give accurate memories about any interrogations and fights. They make sense to only those who have fought to live, not to do their job. They won’t hold up in court. And that's always what I get landed with. I know I can't help what missions I get, but it would be nice to just not worry about getting a menial task because I can't provide a decent memory."
Draco had to think about that one. Sure, there were attractive people at school, but he wasn’t attracted to anyone specifically.
Pansy stood and yelled at her to repeat what she just said and when the insult was repeated Pansy sent a hex her way. She tried to dodge it, but didn't manage to get out of the way in time. Then one of the biggest student fights in Hogwarts history broke out.
“The kind that prevents you from having sexual relations with anyone but yourself. It will allow you to kiss each other-and before you ask, no it will not allow anyone’s tongue into anyone else’s mouths. Anything above the jaw and below the wrist is allowed-but again, no tongues or you’ll receive quite the shock. Oh don’t look so devastated! It will be able to differentiate between holding someone without sexual intent and say giving them a hug. You’ll be fine as long as you don’t intend to rip their clothes off.”
“What if someone sees? Do you really want that kind of attention?” Panic laced Harry’s voice. He just wanted a nice dinner, not having to worry about people starting.
That only left sleeping next to Draco. Just the thought of laying next to him with a warm blanket practically knocked him out standing up. He was just having trouble sleeping alone, that was all.
Draco couldn't believe what he had just heard Harry say to him. Did that mean that he wanted a relationship? Or just friendship? Did he just want to be around him because having a baby felt right, or because being with him felt right?
"Yes I did. You knew I wasn't Severus and you didn't know what to think, so I scared you. I'm sorry, I should've said something so you wouldn't have gotten upset. I don't like upsetting you, you know." Harry's face wrinkled in confusion. "Even when we were kids. I never liked hurting you. I just didn't know how else to get you to pay attention to me. And then when I figured out I was going about it all wrong, I thought that you and your friends would never believe me because of the way that I had treated you in years past. So in my mind, I was forced to continue to hate you for you to keep talking to me. Even if it was shouting in my face like you did."
It was six months into the pregnancy when Harry took their relationship any farther. On the sixth-month anniversary of the conception of their child, Harry walked out of his room to find Draco sitting on the couch reading a book.
“You’ll let me stay. I’m your only friend, aren’t I?” Ice and dread spread through Harry like the plague.
Harry woke up and got out of bed. He couldn't sleep, yet again. He tried to sleep on his own, but even when he could sleep he'd have terrible nightmares. And he couldn't take anymore dreamless sleep potion because he'd risk an overdose and slip into a coma.
He just hoped that he wouldn't get there before he could take care of his need to let lose a few tears.
"So Harry, what did you come for? I thought you were doing rather well with not coming, I was beginning to think you no longer cared if I was bored out of my mind after classes." Harry laughed at the dry sarcasm.
Harry had thought about having a family, of course, but when he came to terms with being gay he had resigned himself to never having the luxury of kids that were his. Draco's predicament had sparked a hope inside of him, but he had logic and wisdom on his side. He had to think this through.
He really had to remember that spell. Lots of people could use it. Of course, Healers would need to be taught and specialized, but in the end, so many more couples, fertile or non, could have families. He looked forward to that day. Of course, that day wouldn't come until he could remember what the man had said and done. Which wasn't likely as he was beginning to find it harder and harder to remember the events in the first place due to hitting his head as hard as he did. He had little hope for it, and told Harry as much.
The submissive is the one to initiate the courting phase. The dominant must continue the teasing stage until the submissive verbally expresses their interest in continuing the relationship. Gift giving is crucial for this stage. It is the dominant’s responsibility to not only woo the submissive, but to shower them in gifts. Submissive instincts thrive on it, as it is a show of how much the dominant wants to protect them, to take care of them, and to show that they truly want the submissive for who they are. Meaningless gifts simply won’t do.
Ron had grown quite close to him and his obnoxious traits seemed to dissipate and left Harry quite pleased with their friendship. By the time they went back to Hogwarts, they were inseparable.
They waved at him to get a move-on and he thought he heard Sirius mutter something along the lines of 'before my painting yellows.'
Draco held onto Harry as they soared through the halls to their rooms and landed. He readjusted Harry in his arms, cradling him and walked through the entrance to their rooms.
“AND WHAT ABOUT HIS SCREAMS? WHY DON’T YOU LISTEN TO THAT FOR A MOMENT?” There was silence, broken only by Harry’s screaming and writhing.
"Hey. Feeling worse, I take it?" Draco felt himself nodding. "Here. Take this." The brunet placed a vial of red liquid. "It's a potion for motion sickness. I made it because I get floo-sick every now and again." Draco found himself nodding again and before he could protest, the red liquid was making its way down his throat.
A few hours later, Draco decided to turn in for the night. However, Harry wouldn't let him as he had been ill earlier. He decided to stay for the night instead, although it wasn't exactly his decision. It was more of Harry telling him he was to stay here for the night.
"I am going to keep that a secret. And it'll seem foolish at first, but trust me. You'll feel absolutely wonderful afterwards."
Draco dropped the paper. Rita Skeeter? The crazy old bat that made things up and twisted everything that people said? She couldn't be serious. Like Harry would want an interview with her.
He needed to get a grip on himself. It didn't matter if Potter noticed he was embarrassed or not. Draco was sure that Harry would have been embarrassed if he was caught in the same situation.
“Oh, hi Harry! I heard you were getting married and figured my invite got lost in the post so here I am!”
"I...Draco you...oh bugger. Look, lay down. You'll stress yourself more if you don't." He laid down. "Okay here's the thing..." And so the truth came out. When Harry was done explaining, he looked up from his shoes, which had become objects of extreme interest during his explanation. He did a double take on the current bedridden man.
He didn’t wake up to hear the locks being redone on the outside of the door, and he didn’t wake up to the loud POP’s signalling people apparating outside the house. He didn’t hear the shouting match Vernon was having with the strangers, and he didn’t hear Narcissa Malfoy rush up the stairs, blast the door open, or yell for Severus. He didn’t even flinch when she apparated him away from the Dursley’s forever.
"I suppose you're going to tell me I'm nothing but a crybaby and a loser for breaking down like this." His voice was broken, clearly conveying the hurt inside of him. He was amazed to find Draco protesting.
It made everything so much slicker and easier for Draco’s fingers to slide in and out of him at a much more acceptable pace than the incredibly slow movements that the blond had been subjecting him to. He was staring up at his husband, nerves making him shake in pleasure, and all he wanted was more.
Draco surprised him, coming back just as hard with an image of Harry riding him and biting through the flesh in his neck to drink to his heart’s content. Suddenly, white hot passion ripped through them both and Harry arched off his bed as he came harder than he ever had.
He couldn't believe that he had just kissed Harry Potter. He couldn't believe how much he had enjoyed it-how little butterflies swarmed in his stomach at just the mere thought of what had happened. His lips continued to tingle up through him losing his conscious mind to sleep.
"Ever so pleasant, dear godfather." He refused to listen to another word the portraits said and slowly got up. Taking a few tentative steps, his body taut, searching for any sign that Malfoy was, indeed, hurt.
"I don't know." He walked back out to get the portraits and they suggested they talk, all three of them.
The chaste kiss Draco had given him on the top of the tower had been the only one. Harry was far too shy to initiate anything else and Draco always seemed like he was fighting himself on it.
Once he realized this, his body started struggling in panic. He knew in his mind that he was only making things worse for himself, but he couldn’t bring himself to stop his legs from attempting to fight back. He felt the large hand make contact with his face.
Once she had thought they were in the clear, his back arched off the bed completely. Whimpers escaped his throat, and tears of pain flooded his face. She caressed his hand, it had seemed to help before, and watched him suffer. Draco put a hand on her shoulder, a gesture of comfort as her tears flowed over her cheeks. She just wished there was something she could do. She hadn’t ever felt this useless. Even with Draco’s transition, she was able to comfort him with her touch.
"Draco, I haven't left this chair since I got here." He looked up with bright green eyes, misted over with unshed tears. They pierced holes into Draco's soul, burning the pain and relief into his mind forever. In that moment, Draco felt like he was just permanently branded.
"As you probably don't know this, I'll just tell you everything. Our paperwork documents everything from every situation we find ourselves in. Since it wouldn't do to have me recount the information to you, my boss wants someone with me. Just like with other teams, it would make it more...professional if you were to go with. Not to fight, although you do have to be trained somewhat before you can come with, but so you can document information and lend memories as necessary."
“More like I was restless and didn’t want to be around Crabbe and Goyle any longer than necessary today. Their stupidity is going to rub off on me one day if I’m not careful.” They chuckled and Harry went back to watching the snow outside.
"Now, I hope you two have a wonderful visit. Damion and Shane will take care of everything." Draco nodded his thanks and saw the two men start heading towards the front as he felt Harry lean towards him. He leaned in as he could practically feel the curiosity pouring off the other teen.
“Well I’ve just told you, get going! You too Harry, we’ve much to talk about and no time to waste! Knowing Draco’s father, he’ll have Draco’s marriage contract offer written by sundown and Merlin knows that man isn’t very patient.” Harry started scrambling to clothe himself but froze at her words.
As if it could get any better, he suddenly started smelling wonderful things nearby. Ah yes, the brunch Draco was talking about.
Draco was unnaturally happy about being the person who introduced alcohol to Harry Potter. It was a bottle of Ogden’s Finest, something that his parents saw fit to gift him with earlier that year for his birthday and now for the holiday season. And somehow, Draco managed to convince Harry to play a drinking game which resulted in the two being far too drunk to really think about what they said before they said it, but not far enough to forget everything the next day. They wandered around the castle, arm in arm, singing, badly, the school song and giggling far too much.
Draco glanced down, clearly caught out. "No. I want a guy like that in my life too. Sometimes I can't always hold others up, and I've found that most women are too helpless for my liking. They always need someone to lean on. Newsflash: I need someone to lean on too." Harry nodded. This he could understand at least.
“Are you attracted to anyone from Slytherin?” Draco, taken aback by the sudden turn of topic, took a moment to tell her that no, in fact, he wasn’t interested in any of the Slytherins. “Ah, and what about in general? Are you attracted to anyone?”
"Yes." No doubt could be heard in his simple answer. He was going to do this and he was sure about his choice. He knew what he wanted from life.
“Sod off, you’re fine. Mother just updated my account credit for the holiday, so if you see anything you’d like to try or anything you fancy just grab it.” Harry raised an eyebrow.
Draco kept to his word and didn’t send an owl until the second week of them being out of school. It was some sort of pygmy breed, small enough to be mistaken for a regular bird if you glanced at it. Harry let the bird rest on his shoulder and read the note attached to its leg.
“I tried going to him before. Apparently there’s too many ministry employees that would take advantage of getting magical custody over me.” Draco looked incredibly sad and Harry stood. “Let’s go to bed, I’d like to get some sleep before this brunch happens. What even is a brunch anyway?”
"Malfoy!" Harry hadn't expected that he would be plowed over the one time he managed to stop his forward momentum. He just passed it off as the world being bent on him forever running into people, no matter who's fault it turned out to be.
"So...I have to have sex?" Harry nodded. "But who would be insane enough to have a child with another man? Actually, who would do it without taking advantage of me and then ditching...?" Harry just sat there, completely at a loss.
Draco walked all the way to the Head of Aurors office and stood at the door poised to knock for almost five minutes, mentally trying to prepare himself for what he knew he needed to do. He then promptly gave into his fear and, defeated, he turned to walk away before anyone noticed him.
"So Draco. Ready to throw away your figure and position in society for something so small you can't even see with a microscope yet?" Draco bristled.
“And besides that, I’ve seen Weasley’s wand. It’s a Diggory creation, more of a generic wand company than Olivander’s. They work, but they’re not as accurate as Olivander’s can be.”
“I am. I’ve just been, oh god Draco, I’ve just been practicing.” With the same precision as when he entered, Draco pulled out of Harry. He was sure to leave the tip in.
If he asked someone else then he risked his baby finding out later and being mad at him for lying all their childhood. But then he wouldn't have to ask his partner, and formal archenemy, and the Savior of the Wizarding World for sex. He'd only have to ask for help raising his child.
"Baby two is a wonderful boy." She handed the other blanket to Harry who looked at the baby he never knew about.
“Well, with all the fighting we did I managed to get a lot of looking in. Malfoy honor and all that. Gotta look your enemies in the eyes and all.” There was a heavy pause before he cleared his throat. “They look nicer now. They’re a little deeper green and have swirling ribbons of silver and gold in them. Actually swirling. It’s….I’ve never seen anything like it.”
The moans increased in their urgency and Harry’s hands fisted clumps of the sheets below him. Draco smiled, he was happy he could bring his mate this much pleasure.
"If...If I ever...Ever do anything...Even under the Imperius curse...I want you to kill me. Before I can inflict that kind of fear and pain on someone. Okay?" Draco sat there, shocked.
"Harry, we did some extra research with better sources and equipment. All of it points in the same direction you were following. So file four is what we found, nothing too far off of what we already knew. Brief Malfoy today. You start tomorrow."
It felt like forever, but a few moments later Draco pulled away. He carried Harry up to his bedroom and they curled up together on his bed.
"Draco, if he'll agree. He seems to be the only person who isn’t enamored by my." Severus nodded and instructed him to make himself comfortable and not to leave the room as he swept out the door. He sat on the couch, right on the edge, but his shoulders weren't stiff either. They were hunched as Harry started reading the book on the coffee table.
“Just because you’ll want to doesn’t mean you will. Once you decide you’re going to do something, the spell will prevent it. Wanting it and intending to do it are two very different things. Now are you going to tell me why you’re so eager to learn about all this?” Draco snapped his mouth shut. He wouldn’t tell his mother, not yet. He had to talk it over with Harry first. And besides that, Harry probably wasn’t ready for that anyways. Nope, he wasn’t going to tell his mother anything.
He was so lost in his thoughts, he didn't notice Draco walk into his room wearing the necklace he had given him until he cleared his throat.
That was only accentuated by the sudden proximity of the brunet, and his eyes widened. The other man stayed like that, considering what to do, savoring the moment. Draco just wanted him to let the Gryffindor side out, but unfortunately, before he did, a Healer walked in.
“He’s right guys. They’re a lot nicer than we ever thought possible. Narcissa has personally taken me under her wing as some sort of long lost son. Lucius has even been kind enough to teach me a little about wizarding politics and government. And Draco has been tutoring me in potions and herbology while I’ve been returning the favor with defense and charms.” Ron looked between the two over and over again, his face turning bright red and then going pale altogether.
‘I the case that the mate is undergoing an inheritance change, often outsiders will be the only ones to notice their bond strengthening and forming. The majorly affected will be too wrapped up in loneliness and despair to notice anything but the overpowering feeling of loss. The one undergoing their change still will notice a dramatically smaller amount of loneliness than they would have normally. The closer to their mate they are, the less lonely they will act. They will start to hover around their mate subconsciously, finding excuses to spend more time together.
“I’m sorry Hermione, I must have made plans and not realized the date.” She looked concerned but nodded anyway.
Halfway through the ride, Harry looked up and watched the other with intent eyes. He hadn't been heard from after Harry had cleared him and everyone thought he had stayed in his precious manor for good while his parents stayed on house arrest. He wondered why he ad come back to finish his schooling and what had triggered the sudden change in his look. Although he couldn't really ask, after all he had changed a lot after the end of Voldemort as well and he didn't want people asking about it. The reasons behind it were just too much for him to really handle at the moment.
However, after several failed attempts, he decided to try just one hint. He scowled when it worked effortlessly.
Draco could tell it hadn’t been very long when he was jolted awake by a breathy silent scream. He sat up and looked over to Harry who was screaming, but almost silently. He was definitely exhaling like he was screaming, but it had a high pitched little squeak every now and again.
All too soon the sun was coaxing them out of bed. Harry was still half asleep as Draco practically carried him to the kitchen. He groaned and rubbed his eyes open as he was set into a bar stool at the island. He didn’t hurt, but he was sore from their activities the night prior. Draco passed by him, getting them both glasses of pumpkin juice.
"And their last names will be Potter. Now, I'm tired. Can't you take us home?" Harry looked to the Healer and she nodded.
“So, do you want to talk about it or are you just going to change the subject again?” Harry sighed and resigned himself to the conversation since Draco simply wouldn’t drop it.
“Try this. Close your eyes. Now, feel your wings?” He nodded. “Picture them folding neatly behind you. Good. Now imagine them merging with your spine, becoming part of your back.” The wings slowly disappeared and Draco smiled proudly. “Perfect!”
"Impressive. For anyone but an auror. Now I want you to learn these spells and learn them well. You know where to reach me if you need me." He handed Draco a textbook chalk full of spells that he had made written notes next to. It would figure that he would write in books, he never had much respect for the texts.
"Shush. Just sleep, I don't mind. Really." Draco's voice was soft and calming, something that Harry had thought impossible in their younger years. He had quickly realized lately that he wasn't always a huge pratt. He relaxed, just enough to close his eyes.
As Harry was laying in the warm embrace that eased his hurting, he thought about Draco revealing himself as a veela. He couldn’t remember much about it, only the brilliant silver glow that surrounded him and his eyes. He couldn’t remember what his wings looked like.
“I was reading one day and he asked me what it was about. Since I had just started, I went back and started reading out loud as a joke but he said he was interested in hearing the rest only a few paragraphs in.” He shrugged. “I simply obliged him and it became a part of our routine.”
"Silencing charm Harry." He couldn't make out what the painting said but he got the idea and cast a charm so the blond wouldn't wake up due to their voices.
“That’s not entirely true, he just started wearing new robes on the weekends.” Harry looked out the window, preferring to see the sun setting over the Forbidden Forest than to look at Draco.
"I know it's hard for you. But you don't have to worry about anything anymore. I'm here for you, just as you were for me. So. Who would you feel most comfortable sharing a room with?" Harry looked up, surprised he was being given a choice to sleep with anyone at all.
"So, you had a sister?" Draco ignored the question and looked around. They had landed in a forest, full of trees and lots of cover.
Hundreds of rose petals in all different shades surrounded him on the bed. On Draco’s side of the bed was a small black box and a letter folded neatly in half. He reached for the letter.
Approaching the door, he sighed. He wasn't too sure he wanted to walk through, he supposed he could just walk away. But Harry was too noble for that. So throwing away all of his self-preservation and remaining pride, he opened the door just enough to get inside and quickly shut it again.
“Well, I’d like to change that. Starting this holiday. When the train’s left Hogsmead, come find me at the Honeydukes and we’ll stock up before heading back.” Harry smiled and nodded, excited for the shopping trip and the ability to hang out with Draco without anyone knowing.
But if he were in Draco's position, and Draco in his, then wouldn't he have to consider his partner? Yes he supposed, but what would happen? Would Draco actually be patient enough to stick with him if he was abandoned?
And the down duvet was doing wonders for him as well. It was incredibly fluffy and just heavy enough to be comforting but not so heavy that it made him feel claustrophobic. He could get used to waking up like this.
They graduated Hogwarts with flying colors, both of them getting top grades in all their classes. They decided to decline various offers for jobs and just enjoy each other and the time that they had. Travelling the world on extended holidays seemed like heaven to them.
"It's yours now. Don't think about giving it back, I gave it to you knowing full well the implications behind it." He reached out and took Draco's hand that wasn't occupied with the box. "I hope you'll accept." After saying a quick goodnight to the baby, he got up an left Draco sitting on the couch. Draco knew Harry wasn't going to be spending the night in a bed tonight. The look on his face said it all.
Harry walked to his room, forcing himself to keep a steady pace. When he entered his room, he closed the door and smiled. Casting a silencing charm, he quickly changed for bed, only pulling on a pair of cotton pants.
After his first summer back with the Dursley’s he learned rather quickly that Hedwig was not only unwelcome but in danger of being outright murdered. He had managed to sneak her out when Vernon had gotten too drunk to remember the lock and Harry had convinced him the next morning that Vernon had thrown her out of the open window and then slammed him into his cupboard. He claimed he hit his head and didn’t remember anything after that and the couple believed him.
Harry came to actually care about the blond once he saw him show some emotion other than the cold vivaciousness he usually showed. He wanted him to wake up and didn't think it would actually happen. He felt more tears slide down his face and after a few moments of contemplating wiping them away, he just let them fall.
He could see the exact moment that Harry’s hand made contact with the silver chain because his entire being sagged in relief. The tension visibly left him and suddenly Lucius was being pierced by pools of emerald.
He looked so small and vulnerable with his face streaked with tear stains and red from the ordeal. Draco brushed Harry’s fringe from his face gently and smiled. Maybe his mother had been right, maybe he was lonely. He certainly would like to wake up with Harry in his arms more often, but was that he wanted a person to wake up to or did he want to wake up to Harry specifically?
He showed up in Severus's rooms not long after that and he sat waiting for him to get done doing whatever it was that he was involved with. He just wanted to see him and to talk. After all, he hadn't done that in almost a week.
"...AND ANOTHER THING! I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT ISSUE! YOU NEED TO SUCK IT UP AND DO IT! Or are you just that chicken? Because if you can't do that, then how the BLOODY HELL can you finish the one thing you ALWAYS wanted to do?"
“I suppose you wouldn’t think it that much money if you have a trust vault and a family vault. Goblins only contact you on your seventeenth if it’s a lot.” Harry excused himself for bed then before the tense atmosphere could bother him too much. It was the first time he admitted he might actually have more money than most, and it felt just as horrible as he thought it would.
"You're supposed to find a beautiful, spirit-filled woman with big boobs and hips that'll give you five kids. I'm supposed to find some brainless, rich girl who doesn't know up from down and go to balls and parties. I'm supposed to be perfectly in control and you're supposed to be the one everyone looks to."
"Anyway, it's not natural. And until it IS natural, it will continue to basically suck the life out of you. You'll both perish." He saw the panicked look on Draco's face and hurried into his next point. "Draco, you need someone to...donate?...their DNA and to share this child with you. Like, within the next seven days. That's the only way you and this child are going to survive." Draco's face was blank.
That summer Harry received an invite to stay at the Weasley house. He agreed and packed his things, happy to be out of his aunt and uncle’s clutches for the rest of the summer.
He refused to marry anyone he didn't love, and no one would love him back enough to marry him. He wanted kids, but he knew he'd never get them.
Narcissa looked up hopefully. His screams had quieted down to whimpers and faded out altogether. She was hopeful that after two days being unconscious, he was finally starting to wake up. At the beginning, they had summoned a Healer from St. Mungo’s to check Harry out and she had simply stated that he was still in his transitioning phase. She had two likelihoods of what he was becoming, and both of them caused intense fever and a prolonged transition. There was nothing to do but wait.
"Harry bloody Potter, if you do not simply take the chance on this one then I swear I will burst forth from this blasted canvas and castrate you myself!" Harry, eyes wide with fear, nodded quickly. He knew his godfather only wanted the best for him and he knew that he would do anything to please him unless it put his life in danger. Maybe...maybe it was worth a try, to go after someone that he actually liked. And maybe hatred could be traded for passion someday.
“Fine. They weren’t feeding me and then they just decided to leave me locked into the room they put me in. Aunt Petunia said they were going to attach automatic locks that would let me out every few hours for the toilet but I guess they forgot.”
Vernon yanked him to his feet by his hair. He tried to hold in his cry, as that would only result in a worse beating. He felt himself being thrown like a rag doll, weak with starvation, onto his bed. Pulling himself into a tight little ball, he braced himself for the blow that didn’t come. Instead, he was yanked to his feet again, this time by his wrists. They were so small, Vernon had a free hand that was currently yanking his pants down.
Turns out, Draco wasn’t that bad to study with. Sure his tailored clothes made Harry feel a bit frumpy in comparison but it was nice to know that being put together on the outside didn’t mean you automatically think you know everything.
He forced his mind to shut down; he knew what he had to do and he knew what needed to be done to get him there. It wouldn't be easy, but he'd do the best he could. After all, he'd lied before to save others from knowing the horrors he had to live through. What was the difference, really? This was just one more lie to cover up what he knew the general populace couldn't handle.
"What's Mission X?" It was then that Harry realized Malfoy needed a debriefing day. He was a little disappointed at that, but he would only need an hour or two. He knew that if he went out without proper protocol, he'd be sent back to desk work.
"So, why were you crying this morning?" He stiffened. "I mean, if you don't want me to be hurt in any way I assume that means emotionally and mentally too. And it hurts me to know I can't help unless you let me in. And it hurts me because then I have to think of ways to get you to open up."
"Today. In case you never noticed, the past week we've been tracking these two scumbags. And today we're going to get them."
“Harry, I was worried when Hermione said you ran from the common room instead of meeting her in the library.” Draco sat down next to him and Harry took a deep breath to calm himself down.
Draco had gone to Harry in search of advice when he started receiving all the gifts and had gotten no answer other than a smile and the suggestion that he talk to Severus. That old man hadn't been much help either, other than the fact that he should trust this person wasn't a weird creep.
Draco escorted Harry to Restaurant Le Meurice Alain Ducasse, an extraordinarily hard restaurant to get reservations for. The decor stunned Harry, the white walls and detailed gold and silver accents took his breath away. When Draco had given his name, the staff bowed and led them to a separate dining hall. This one was just as extravagant, but magically enlarged and warded for wizards only.
“If you so much as back talk me one more time,” he growled, “I’ll have your head on a platter. Understood?” Harry nodded, gulping and trying to prevent his body from shaking. “Good. As your best friend, I’m the most important person in your life, not the teachers.” Ron left the room then, slamming the door and leaving Harry to his own devices.
"Well, it's along the lines of honey and feathers. Now, you told me about the movie where the kid made the bad guy walk through glue and sprayed him with feathers...Why don't you explain to me-in great detail, mind you-exactly how he did that?"
“Harry?” he called softly. His feet whispered across the floor in his haste to give the boy some sort of comfort. He felt, rather than saw, the wings stiffen at his approach. “Oh Harry.” He dropped to his knees beside him and gathered him in his arms softly, careful not to touch his wings too much. He knew just how sensitive they could be, especially when emotions run high, and he didn’t want to cause more harm.
“Are you kidding me? You’ve been glaring at me from across rooms and trying to pick a fight since school started again! Don’t give me that innocent act, it’s not going to work. I don’t want to deal with your insincere attitude, just leave me alone already!” Ron’s face darkened and Harry took an involuntary step back.
“Yes, yes, I know all that!” Harry interrupted. “Trust me, I know. But I hope that you know I will have Hermione helping her so I can’t be overruled by you two.” Draco laughed at that and agreed. Hermione would be good for his mother to be around; she was sensible and wouldn’t let all the frills be too much for them. She’d find ways to add more masculine details that his mother wouldn’t think of.
He collapsed on his bed, the shock leaving as quickly as it came and rendering his body a shaking mass of sobs and terror.
“What a right state mum was in. Do you know about Harry Potter starting school this year? It’s all in the papers, of course.”
When I said I knew the implications of giving you the necklace, I realize I never told you. Well asked you, really. The necklace was made by the goblin Staklind. Perhaps you remember Binns mentioning him in class. He was the best crafter of goblin-made things from the beginning of time through the present. This happens to be his absolute piece, the last piece he ever finished and the first piece he started with. He spent almost a thousand years working on it to make it the masterpiece it is. When he finished, it was just before his death and right after a massive 'cleansing' of the goblin society.
Harry seemed to be getting the brunt of the loneliness all at once, and none of the bond. A tear slipped down Draco’s cheek. It had only been a few months for him and the hollow loneliness was already intense. He couldn’t imagine getting a year’s worth all at once.
Draco shrugged. “That’s a bit of a multifaceted answer. On the one hand, I felt it was time I learned about it so I could go into it prepared and decide what I wanted out of a life partner. And on the other hand, I finally found someone I’d be happy to present a contract to.” Harry’s heart skipped a beat. Did that mean what he thought it meant?
"I mean that the magical community won't take kindly to their Savior having a baby with another man. Being gay is widely accepted, but they expect you to marry a beautiful woman and have ten kids in a cookie-cutter house with a gnome infestation." He walked out. "Just try to stay out of public places while he's pregnant, okay?" They quickly agreed and Draco put his head in his hands.
“Aha! Here it is-oh, but that’s terribly outdated! No, this simply won’t do.” He turned the text so Harry could read if he wanted to.
“Students of Hogwarts! It’s my pleasure to welcome you all back. Before we sort the first years into their houses, I would like to take a moment of your time.
"Just do as I say." Harry didn't question him, he learned long ago that it would get you nowhere quickly. "Now close your eyes and imagine Draco. I don't care where you two are, just think about him. Visualize him to the best of your ability." Harry nodded and after a few more moments, Sev continued. "Now just talk. About what you feel. About anything. Just talk. Don't think. Feel."
They worked tirelessly, so much so that they didn't hear the insults sent their way the entire day. All their teachers were ecstatic they were so advanced in their studies, and Madame Sprout actually learned a helpful tidbit from Harry about getting the plants to stop trying to strangle her while she talked to the class. Lunch came and passed with nothing to note, but dinner was when the fighting broke out.
“You always knew me best. Look,” he stood and transformed into his veela self, letting his wings stretch out beside him.
"He never questioned their 'playtime' with me again." Draco was horrified. He wanted Harry to stop, and yet he just couldn't help but want to know more. "They did that ever since. One would abuse me while the other would rape me. They tried to get Dudley in on it, but he always said he'd rather play video games.
“I’m pretty sure because I’m still at school there’s some sort of law preventing a mass amount of contract proposals to me. I’ll admit, I’m a bit afraid of the insanity that will ensue after we leave Hogwarts. I’m not blind, I’ve seen the articles on the how-tos for sending ‘Harry Potter, the Most Eligible Wizard Alive’ a contract. I’ll be honest, I’m dreading it and I don’t really want anyone else.”
"I am. Very much so." To prove his point, he snuggled in closer to the brunet and pressed his face into Harry's neck. "Why the sudden curiosity?"
At this point, Harry realized his musings were headed down a dangerous path so he committed himself to reciting his life rules:
It grounded him in all his anxiousness. The press had been ruthless in finding Harry and picking apart every detail of his life causing social anxiety when Harry was around anyone that wasn’t Draco or the Weasley family.
Please Draco, it isn’t fair that you’re away from me and I have to go without pleasure! The imagery stopped and the lust lessened.
"Here. You pick first names, I'll pick the middle names." He agreed, realizing that it was the best offer he'd get.
"Um...Right. So Kingsley has a job for me which means physical work is going to have to be put on hold for now. So. Show me what you've learned since school." Draco showed him impressive display of various spells. He faltered after a few minutes after seeing the look on his spectator's face.
Father says he thinks it’s time. The bond has strengthened and only gotten easier to communicate through with distance. I miss you, angel. Just pack essentials-I need you here with me. My beautiful angel… His voice drifted off and Harry rushed to grab some spare clothing. He dumped the contents of his school bag and stuffed his clothing in it. He was in such a rush that he didn’t even bother putting his wings away.
Because he HAD done all those mean things to him and he HAD acted without thinking. Now he was screwed. Hopefully literally, but he'd never admit that out loud.
Harry really did seem embarrassed, like he had assumed something other than what he mentioned. But Draco had no such plans.
"I've always wanted to wear the eyeliner and the black clothes. I always wanted to just sit back and do my work and let everyone else alone. Unfortunately with the stress of the entire world on my shoulders, even as a twelve year old boy, I couldn't even focus on class. I'm lucky I passed.
Deciding that he needed a shower, that's exactly what Draco did. However, his warm water was laced with freezing cold after ten minutes and he quickly got the hint. Getting out, he placed a heating charm on his towel and dried off before getting dressed in an older pair of robes.
“Well sure, in theory. It depends on the situation, I suppose. Sure, I could wait until I get my vain streak to calm down a bit but I would do a lot better if I had someone around me to remind me when it becomes a bit obsessive that it’s alright to let something like a single hair out of place go. But if it’s something like...like if my mum just got really sick and was dying. That’s about the worst time to start dating someone, because that will take all of my energy and effort to be there to support her.”
Draco made a bloody good pillow and he was going to take full advantage of that for as long as humanly possible.
The only interesting thing that happened (besides being the youngest seeker in a century) was the TriWizard Tournament. Harry had been incredibly relieved that there was an age limit on the goblet as well as a 24-hour watch overseen by trained ministry officials. He thought he’d enjoy seeing the tournament, a blessed break from all the studying, but he found that the insane amounts of danger most definitely wasn’t his cup of tea. He left the stands halfway through the first task and didn’t bother going to watch any of the others when they happened, preferring to stay in the library with Hermione studying.
After several more minutes of worthless ranting, he stopped only to realize that in his tangents, Harry had gotten undressed and dressed in a fluffy dark green robe. He closed his mouth and quickly followed suit.
“When two males are involved in a situation like ours, one of us will be larger than the other. And since I’m taller and my wingspan is larger, I believe that would be me. Besides, you’ve given so much of yourself to others I want to be the one to shower you with gifts and trinkets. I want to take care of you, my angel.” Harry blushed at that admission. No one had ever cared for him before and he was excited to finally be able to let someone else worry about all that for once.
“Ah, yes. Harry, my boy, how have things been?” Dumbledore turned away from one of his delicate looking machines that was magically whirring in the background to look at Harry. “Please, sit down. You’re not in any trouble, I assure you.” He sat, feeling much less nervous now. He couldn’t help being nervous. Every time he had been called here before he was either finding out bad news or getting into trouble.
“Son, I wanted to ask you something.” Draco motioned for him to continue. “What do you see for your future?”
"Get some sleep. I'll keep watch." Draco fell on the bed, intent on getting some shut eye. But try as he might, he just couldn't let the darkness take him. After about half an hour he heard voices outside.
They exchanged their vows one after another...and then it was over. Draco and Harry were married and Harry kissed him, effectively stealing all of his breath.
"I forgave you a long time ago for everything that you did. I had worried at the time that it wasn't the right choice to make, but now I can see that it was definitely the right choice. You're worth knowing, that's for sure. I'm not sure where I'd be right now if it weren't for you helping me through this. And I know that you don't really think that you're doing anything...but trust me. You are.
They spent the remainder of the day doing yoga, followed by some vegetables, followed by pilates followed by chicken and beef followed by using weight machines Harry unshrunk, followed by dinner. After that, Harry told him to take a cool shower and to get some sleep. They'd be doing a condensed version of their workout the next day at the same time.
Not wanting the warmth to go away, Draco clung to a finger as tight as his feeble strength would let him and gently tugged. It got the 'lay-down-or-I-kill-you-later' point across to the brunet and he felt the bed dip next to him.
"Good. But you skipped a part in your poking around. You have to ask in person." A feeling of dread raised itself to the surface. What if he was just planning on hurting him? But he put a quick stop to these thoughts. Draco had just spent a fair amount of time showing genuine emotions. He wasn't about to ruin that by letting his fears get the better of him.
Harry noticed his discomfort and turned around. When they were about two hundred yards away from the back door, they slowed to a walk.
The man was good looking. His hair made him look like he just rolled out of bed after a night of hot sex, and his eyes had darkened a shade over the years only to add to that 'bedroom sex god' look. Muscles were hidden by a thin layer of skin and clothes, but were blatantly obvious when he did something, anything really.
“How bloody dare you spend your time with him? What, am I not good enough for you anymore?” Harry’s heart sped up. He really hated fighting.
They had arrived at Diagon Alley in the mid afternoon. Perfect shopping time, the shops had all slowed down from their morning rushes. The fewer people shoving them around, the better off they would be.
Harry woke up thinking it was six-the time he needed to get up by if the both of them were going to make it to class on time. He just didn't look at the clock like he normally did.
Suddenly, Draco’s hands were busy trailing through Harry’s wings. His mind reeled with the overwhelming sensations, pleasure tearing through his body and threatening his sanity. Before long, Harry was begging Draco for more. He happily obliged, kissing Harry senseless. Their bodies rocked gently against one another until Harry noticed they both were wearing pants still.
“Prat. Enjoy your time away from schoolwork.” Harry even had the cheek to wink at him, something that did funny things to his insides.
He only stopped when the thread of memories snapped, signaling Harry's thread of consciousness stopping completely for a split second.
“I took the liberty of setting up an appointment at the Ministry. They’d like us to arrive in an hour, if you’d like to consult a Seer.” Harry could very well imagine that his cheeks would set fire to anything around them.
“S-sorry Malfoy. I didn’t see you come around the corner.” Draco cocked his head, evidently curious at the lack of a bite back at him.
They soon reached the hall only to find it jam packed with people, all intent on getting to some notice or another. They silently assumed it was for the next Hogsmeade trip as most of the students looked to be about third years and up. Draco gently but firmly led Harry out the massive doors, his arm still wrapped firmly around the other's waist, and out of the school grounds where he took his hand and apparated them to an alley in a muggle city.
I dreamt that Draco, I didn’t do it on purpose. Shock, curiosity and desire was the only answer he got.
“I’m afraid not, I’ve got grading to resume. Mr. Potter here might have a few free minutes for a cup of tea, though.” She left then and Harry followed the headmaster up to his office on a set of spinning stairs.
On some level, he knew she was right. He knew he was stressed and tense and anxious, especially at night when he knew Ron was in the same room as him. But he also knew that she wouldn’t be telling him this if it wasn’t important.
Harry opened his eyes to look up at him, and Draco’s breath caught. While Harry’s eyes were bright during the day, when he just woke up they were dark green and threatened to drown him in their depths.
They retired to their rooms early that night, leaving the group of Gryffindors out on the grounds. They had been surrounding a bonfire, but once Draco saw Harry scoot closer to the fire he had announced that they were taking their leave early. He didn’t want Harry to get cold outside.
“It’s a lobster benedict. A bit hard to describe, here take a piece.” Harry, seeing no other option, opened his mouth for Draco to place a piece of lobster smothered in some sort of sauce on his tongue. And he wasn’t disappointed! It was rich and creamy and so good that he considered getting his own portion.
The last thing he wanted was to deal with that situation so he left it be and turned the shower off before grabbing the towel from the box.
“I’m here, if you ever want to talk about anything. And I promise you, I won’t treat you differently if you’re worried about that.” Harry recognized the moment for what it was. He could choose to trust Draco, here and now, and that would either make or break their relationship. Draco would either stick by his side and they would grow closer or he’d turn and run. Possibly sell the entire story to the papers.
“When they start to gather the students to go to the common rooms, grab onto me. We’ll show them just how well we can fly.” Harry giggled and they stood up when Dumbledore dismissed the hall.
This time, he had told Hedwig he was going to let her stay at Hogwarts during the summer, to which she seemed quite sad about. He’d spent hours reassuring her that he wanted to take her with but that it wasn’t safe for her to go with him. He loved her too much to see her hurt when she could remain safe at the school owlery.
‘Please let me know by return owl how you’re doing and if you require any supplies. I can only imagine how difficult it is to live without having access to things you may need.
He saw, out of the corner of his eyes, everyone in the vicinity had stopped to stare. They all grew worried at the look on is face. They knew that look. Someone big was going down.
It felt like an eternity later, but the burning in his back subdued itself to a throbbing that he could handle. The pain in his chest finally slowed to a dull ache. His skin no longer felt like it was on fire, just too warm. But with a sudden vengeance, all the pain that had dissipated came back and attacked his mouth. He wanted to scream, but the pain was too much. His back arched, feeling lethargic in the pool of his consciousness.
His face was leaned against the window, apparently charmed against fogging up and was just considering conjuring a big fluffy blanket when exactly that was placed on top of him. He jerked, certain he’d been alone up until that point.
“Come on, you can’t expect me to believe that.” Fingers touched his under the blanket and held his own hands, flingers weaving tightly together. “Won’t you tell me what’s bothering you?”
Turns out Dudley’s idea of a breakfast in bed involved Harry filling every spare centimeter of his bed in plates of breakfast foods. He was unceremoniously kicked out when he delivered the last plate and was immediately accosted by his aunt to clean the kitchen from cabinets to floor to be followed by pruning the roses. After that he was sure she’d give him a million more chores.
No such luck was bestowed upon him. His vegetable stock soup was on time: noon as always. He just wished he could stomach drinking it faster than Dudley could bust through his door. He awaited the sound of the lock...and it didn’t come. He sipped his soup as silently and as quickly as he could handle without throwing it all up again and once he was done put the bowl on the other side of the cat flap for the first time in days. Dudley had been gracious enough to shatter the rest on the floor for him.
It wasn't long before Sev was walking through the door and Harry jumped up to meet him. After a hug and some pleasantries, they sat down to some red wine.
...and then he was! The air felt good against his wings, the freedom was incredible. He flew around the garden, waved at his mother who was silently crying with happiness for her son, and he landed with a soft gracefulness he didn’t think he was capable of.
“Warms your towels for when you get out. Shampoo is the purple bottle and the blue bottle is body wash.” Harry looked at him in confusion. People used shampoo to wash their bodies, didn’t they?
“N-no, I just...well I grew up in the magical world and you didn’t. I just thought that maybe you wouldn’t know all the types of magical creatures that walk the earth yet, especially since dark angels are so incredibly rare. I didn’t mean to offend you…” His voice got quieter with each sentence until he just gave up on arguing.
Harry sat next to his blond partner and waited for him to wake up. He felt a little bad about having to poison his partner but it was a necessary lesson to learn. In his opinion, Malfoy had learned it better than Harry did.
Before he even knew what had happened, Harry was up and at the other end of the room standing in front of a full body mirror.
"Their eyes might change color within their first year. Although, I don't think hers will change much, his definitely will." Harry nodded.
"Didn't you read the letter? You don't need robes, you're seventh year was fucked up. Anyone that was seventh year last year and going back to finish school don't need robes unless they want to wear them."
Harry made the trek down to dinner, hoping his friends would make him feel better. Hermione had saved him a seat and invited him to sit next to her. The plate was already heaping with some of his favorites and his goblet was practically spilling over with pumpkin juice.
“I’ve been good Professor,” he started. Sitting in one of the large chairs in front of his desk was easy now, knowing he wasn’t about to be pummeled with bad news. “I wonder, what could be so urgent as to pull me away from potions? Snape is fuming down there.”
“I know that but it doesn’t make a thousand galleons any less shiny! Do you know what I could do with that amount of money? A lot, that’s how much!”
He walked to the main fitness room and saw his class ready to go and without missing a beat started the young adults' aerobics class. He was going to hurt tomorrow, but it would be worth it to get a new partner-one he knew wouldn't scare off as easy as the others had.
It was just a gentle pressing of lips, nothing exceptional, so light he could hardly believed it had happened. He felt lightheaded, more so than when he had tested out just how high his broom could take him before it would slow to a stop.
When he thought he wouldn't be able to keep the food inside his stomach anymore, he heard a delighted cry from the Healer.
"You embody what is important to me. Strength. Courage. Hope. Determination. Seeking help when you need it and not letting pride get in your way. Self-preservation. You have everything that I wish I could have learned when I was younger. Because if I had learned it when you did, the way you did...I never would have gotten involved with everything that I did get involved in." Draco looked down in shame, worried that the one person he had hoped to call a friend had just been pushed away by his open honesty.
"They used to get by with insulting me and making me do chores and letting their son chase me around. Then I turned nine and Vernon started punching me. Around ten, Petunia started in on it, but she only threw things and slapped me.
Harry stood there confidently awaiting Draco's response. He was prepared for rage, anger, surprise, disbelief, betrayal. Anything but what actually happened.
"Sure. I think I'd like that a lot better than where I am now." He took a deep breath as the Hat yelled out the name of his new House.
"This," Harry growled as he grabbed an entire box of paperwork, "is exactly why I joined the force. And this," he slapped the files on the desk in the center so it made a loud noise. "is exactly why I refuse to quit until my contract is up."
“I guess I just...haven’t thought about it. There’s always something else I need to think about, you know? There’s schoolwork and revising with Hermione and during the summers I don’t exactly get out much. But between those three things alone it leaves such little time to think about kissing anyone.”
Harry woke up the next morning warm and cozy. The fluffy duvet was tossed over him but it was more than that-he felt safe. His mind was still mostly groggy when he realized they had somehow shifted in their sleep so Harry’s head was in the crook of Draco’s arm with his hand laying on Draco’s chest. Despite having a brief moment of shock, he decided to double down on his luck and just enjoy being held by someone.
“Alright, now Mr. Potter. Would you like a moment alone with me or would you like someone to stay? There are some matters we have to discuss regarding your health.”
“Cool, I’ll come with you. I need a book about defence as well.” Harry did his best to figure out a way to get Colin to leave him alone but gave it up as a bad job and went to the defence section. As he passed by the usual study table, he shook his head ever so slightly and completely ignored Hermione before selecting a book and making his way to Madam Pince to check it out.
Draco just sat there, too stunned to do anything other than stare. When he finally gathered enough of his wits through his happiness, he nodded. He watched as Harry gently took the ring and placed it on his right ring finger.
"I...admired him for seeming so powerful, I guess. But when his 'master' came back...he lost that admiration within a heartbeat. So no, not really."
“Defence Against All the Arts? What on earth could you possibly need that for?” Irritation coloured Ron’s voice.
“Well, you tend to end up a bit obsessed for some time. You can yearn to be around someone and you’ll take any way necessary to get there. The whole boys pulling the hair of girls they like came about from that. They’re dealing with crushes and finding ways to be around the subject of their feelings-no matter what. So they use hair pulling as an excuse to be near the one they like. As you age, though, you’re typically less obsessed with how much time you spend together and more concerned with the quality of time you spend together. Petty arguments typically turn to deeper conversations. If you like their personality, then usually it’ll progress but if you don’t like them as a person most of the romantic feelings will fade.”
She smiled warmly. “Think nothing of it, Mr. Potter. I trust you will stay out of trouble this year. Goodness knows, I’m tired of seeing you in detention. I would like to ask, though, would either one of you be willing to teach a lesson in the care of magical creatures classes about yourselves? I imagine everyone will be incredibly curious. It would have to be on the weekend of course, so as to not interfere with normal lessons.” The both nodded, excited about the idea of getting to teach their classmates about themselves.
“You’re making us look bad already. She truly does love to cook though. I hope you’re hungry.” She walked towards the door and turned back. “Would you like me to send Draco back in, or would you rather be alone for awhile?” Harry shrugged. He didn’t know what he wanted right now.
Only twenty or so minutes had passed before he heard everyone filing out the door, the front door being shut, the car being turned on, car doors slamming and then silence.
“Sir, I think you know as well as I that Hermione doesn’t like to share books. Especially ones she hasn’t read yet. Be that as it may, and with all due respect, why are you asking me about a book you sent her?” He let confusion layer his voice thickly. It wasn’t every day you got called to the Headmaster’s office, especially for a book.
Draco had trained Harry well. He was quiet when he was told to be, and loud when he was given the permission to be. He had become proficient in edging himself and rarely got punished anymore. If Draco was honest, he was a little disappointed that such a bratty sub had become such a well behaved one.
“Oh is that how you get your hair to look so silky?” He blushed, not having intended to actually ask the question out loud. Draco just smiled.
“I’ll let Hedwig know to meet you there Harry!” Ron called after him. It was obvious he was in too much of a rush to even worry about it.
It was a piece of artwork that had to have been the finest goblins had to offer. When he looked up at Harry, he tried telling him it was beautiful, wonderful, that he loved it and that it was too much all at the same time.
They had full body massages first, wanting to be completely relaxed for everything else that they'd be doing that afternoon. Following that was a haircut for the both of them, Draco just getting a trim and Harry cutting off at least three inches and obtaining a shaggy hair look similar to Draco's but not quite the same. He noticed that Harry had been quite nervous during this part and made a mental note to never go towards the man with a pair of shears ever.
He then proceeded to attempt to explain to himself exactly what the other man was doing, throwing that batch of dough in the air like that. It looked ridiculous and fun at the same time and he couldn't make heads or tails of what he was doing.
Harry stared at Malfoy as he retreated to the tent. Did he really feel bad about insulting him? He must have or he wouldn't have retreated to the safety of solitude like that. It wasn't like a Malfoy to retreat when insulted or yelled at, they liked to play it calm and collected instead.
“Blimey, look at my shirt…” Ron had been directly across from Harry, and had taken most of the blow. Harry took one look at Ron’s face and started laughing uncontrollably. The rest of the table quickly joined, the redhead included. He tried so hard to send the image of Ron’s face and soaked shirt to Draco and was met with even more amusement, causing him to start laughing harder.
“Well-I…” Harry hesitated, trying to remember the last time Ron was a good person to him. It was harder than it should have been, but Ron had been through a lot of hard times lately. “He’s been through a lot lately, but that’s what friends are for. They support you most when you’re having a rough go of it.”
A nearby couple passed, and Draco could hear them giggling over the two of them sitting under a willow tree. He chose to ignore them.
Draco cared for the brunet-that's why nothing really ever came out of their fights in school except a few detentions. And the thing with the dementors? He did that because he thought Harry had been exaggerating with his Patronus abilities. He was a child and children don't think about the consequences. But he'd just been so good at getting under Draco's skin.
The next week found the two partners at the Ministry waiting for Kingsley to either come out of his office or let them in. Draco was nervous for his first time out on in the field, Harry could just tell. He had been nervous his first time too.
“Now,” she sat down and motioned for him to do the same. “Time to get down to business. And please remember you can change your mind later and this isn’t binding. You can decide to say no later on. That being said, what are some things that you consider non-negotiable for your partner? No matter who that partner is?”
Oftentimes, their mate either isn’t of age, or is another creature who hasn’t gone through the complete inheritance change yet. The latter is most common, as bonds with underage wizards, witches and creatures will still form. There is only one case in which a mate bond didn’t form due to being underage…’
Harry shook his head. “I don’t know what you two are on about. There’s nothing wrong with my magic.”
"Draco?" He answered. "I have breakfast. Do you want any?" He replied with the affirmative and told him to come in once he was comfortably situated in his bath once more.
Which, in his opinion, was rather wise of him. It forced others around him to listen more. Draco had seen the differences between the people who never talked and the ones that could never shut up. Those that talked less were listened to much more than the ones who were constantly running their mouths. And him being the 'Savior' and everything, Draco knew that it was a good thing that Harry rarely spoke so much.
There was one shirt in particular that Harry had seemed to take an immense liking to and had bought on impulse. He had gotten a medium, much too large for him and Draco had questioned him on it.
Christmas Eve's Eve found the two men sitting side-by-side by the hearth where the fire Harry had made (the muggle way) crackled and popped cheerfully. Draco was leaning on Harry lightly, with his arm around Draco's not-so-small waist, hand rubbing soothing circles into him.
"I won't." Harry grabbed the picture and shrunk him. Harry tied a piece of leather around the hook of Sirius's painting and tied it around his neck. Sirius gave him a spell to make sure he wouldn't come off until he wanted to come off.
"Draco?" After the seventh or eighth time Harry called his name, he finally looked from the wall to Harry. The same expression remained, but he took it as a 'I'm listening' gesture. "I'm going to take a shower while you process this okay? It'd be nice to feel hot water instead of a spell for once." Draco nodded and looked back at the wall.
It wasn’t until something warm and wet licked his member from base to tip and he keened when that delicious sensation moved to his sack before his dick truly got to appreciate it.
“I’m glad you see reason. Although, it will be interesting you walking around with your wings and all. Especially since you’ve learned they’re very sensitive when others touch them.” He leaned back, thinking about his options. “Alright, we’ll go to Diagon Alley if you can learn to retract your wings. The first month or so is supposed to be very difficult for you to master summoning them and putting them away, but once they’re where you want them they should stay put.”
She really wasn’t that difficult to find. In a rare turn of events, she was wearing a large pair of baggy velvet pajama bottoms and a tight long sleeved cotton shirt. Draco’s jaw nearly hung to the floor when she didn’t start shrieking about how he couldn’t see her in such a state and to turn around. She wasn’t even wearing shoes-not even a pair of slippers!
He had just reached up to sip from his water when Draco leaned over and handed him a glass of wine. A treat indeed, Harry had been banned from wine several years ago when he got completely plastered off a rare vintage he had found in Sirius’s cellar. Draco had been so furious that he didn’t even bother to savour it that he’d been restricted to butterbeer and firewhiskey ever since.
"Malfoy! Get up and into position." I blankly got into a push-up position and he held his hands by my elbows but directly below my shoulders. "Five more to my hands. Go." Draco was almost crying by the time he was done but his damn Slytherin stubbornness made him stand up and face his soreness and burning muscles. He cast a tempus charm and saw it was only six in the morning.
“Well...you see…” He looked to his lap and his fidgeting hands. He wasn’t entirely sure how to start so he took a deep breath and hoped that he could spew out everything all at once to make it easier.
“Oh yeah? And just how much money do you have that a thousand galleons isn’t worth a few scratches?”
Soft contentment was all either one of them could feel. I didn’t even touch myself...will I even survive the real thing? He had meant that to stay in his head, but had forgotten to block off their bond in his bliss.
"Draco. Since almost a year ago you were put into my traineeship, I have grown to trust you and get to know you like I never imagined. I saved your life and the baby's when I had sex with you, but then I decided to do it right.
"But Sirius...if I lose him...I lost you and everyone else. I can't deal with anymore loss. And after my training sessions-"
“You won’t always have to tote them around like that. There will be some unavoidable circumstances when they will emerge, but from now on it will be painless from what I understand. You won’t be able to hide them for awhile, but over time you will gain control over them, and the rest of your appearance as well.” Harry’s eyes jerked from the ceiling back to the blond.
He got up and wandered to the shelving behind his desk to pick up a picture. He smiled, and handed it to Harry when he turned around again.
They exited the room, both gathering their thoughts after the bizarre experience. Neither one of them spoke about it as they met Draco’s parents to go back home.
“Can I shower first?” His voice was so quiet, he wasn’t sure he had said it at all. Draco smiled at him and showed him to the bathroom where he touched a box next to the shower. “What’s that?”
“I’ve forgotten that my son doesn’t ever wait around when he wants something. Now, back to the estates…”
“It’s said that soulmates are a myth. While we don’t really know if that’s true or not, the Seers are only here to tell us if the match between two parties will work. If they disapprove, either one or both of you will be miserable no matter how hard you try. If they approve, then any issues you’ll be capable of working out and any misery in the marriage is solely your fault.”
"Now, we eat." He walked into the house and pulled out a very large lunch box before handing Draco a banana, an orange, an apple and a juice...thing. Harry had the same sitting in front of him. Draco ate his food faster than normal and downed the juice. It's a good thing he did too, because it tasted terrible.
“Oh, I’ll be staying in the castle this year. Mother wanted to go to France and I think Father wants to spend a bit of their time doing some married couple things.” Harry took in the slightly pinched look on Draco’s face and laughed, prompting Draco to smile and start laughing with him.
“Let’s go to Diagon Alley. I’m sure you’ve noticed I need new clothing by now…” Draco’s eyes lingered over his body, assessing the poorly fitting clothes.
He watched, his knees pulled tightly to his chest, as Vernon loomed closer and closer. He hadn’t started yelling-also a very, very bad sign. Harry cowered into himself with fright. Voldemort himself didn’t instill this much fear into him, and yet here he was, ready to piss himself and Vernon hadn’t even said or done anything yet.
“I’m going to have tea with Mother today to keep her company. Merlin knows, she’ll be dreadfully upset that she can’t take it in the garden, what with the weather and all.” Harry nodded and Draco left the comfort of the blankets to go find his mother.
The first gift he sent was a daisy, yellow in color, and everlasting. It had arrived and Draco hadn't known how to react. The next was a small purple and blue butterfly that was spelled with an everlasting charm as well. A small lily followed that, this one red. A miniature dragon followed suit. The last he gave him was a charm bracelet with one charm to represent each gift he had given him.
"Harry, I'm back." The older man walked through the door with none other than Draco Malfoy. Harry stood, not sure what to do. "Sit. Both of you." They did and he sat next to Harry, putting his arm around his shoulders and pulling him to rest on him. Harry did so, pleased with the way that the regular occurrence at Spinner's End was still in effect here as well.
Ron stood and yelled at Pansy before releasing a hex of his own. Which led to Blaise sending one towards him. Ron ducked and it hit Hermione, who sent one right back. A second year sent a rather impressive hex and after that was a blur of different colored hexes and curses. Harry sent a shielding bubble over himself and Draco, who noticed that everyone else was severely injured or had body parts where they shouldn't be.
"I asked you to let me court you because I wanted to get to know you. Yes more physical contact would have been great. But it never would have allowed me and you to have a lasting relationship.
“You’ll both be taking the same classes, and you’ll both be paired up together and sitting next to each other. I trust you can keep the affection to a minimum during class time. I can’t have you two being a distraction any more than you already will be.”
So he did what he did every other night he couldn't sleep. He walked out to the library and sat down right in front of the portrait of Sirius. He opened his mouth to talk, but no sound came out when the picture put a finger to his lips and pointed behind him. Harry looked.
“I thought you two might need this. Consider it an early Christmas gift to the two of you. Lucius and I will be away for a few days; he’s got some business in Ireland and I’ve always wanted to go.” A dreamy look glazed her eyes over. “Have fun dears!” With that she shut their door softly and a few minutes later they heard the distinctive sound of the floo flaring to life as they were on their way.
"Please...Do something. Anything. Just don't tease me like this." Harry realized that the man actually wanted this, actually wanted him and wasn't doing this all for the baby inside him. Harry smiled and took pity on him.
"Look Harry, I know you have issues but trust me. I'm letting you take my personal stylist whenever you're here because I know him. I've had him ever since I was thirteen and I know that he won't pull any funny business with you. He knows me too well to betray my trust."
"You've helped almost as much as Sev has, maybe more. And for that, I can't thank you enough. I don't know what I would've done if you hadn't agreed to help me out. Even if you just sleep in the other room. It's hard to deal with the things I've had to deal with on top of defeating Voldemort and the media trying to get their paws all over me.
Traditionally everyone got one dance with each of them, but they were hardly traditional after having to go through months of overly-formal traditions. They just wanted to do what they wanted for once.
The interview consisted of five questions: his testing scores, his current residence, what hours he was willing to work, if he wanted field or desk work, and if he was willing to put his life on the line. He answered all of them in a dull monotone and bounced his foot repetitively on the floor to get rid of his extra energy. In actuality he kept waiting for the questions about why he wanted a job or why he would need one. He had prepared for those, but he kept fearing he would be asked about his father and other things such as why would someone want to hire the child of a scumbag that betrayed the Ministry before. He didn't want to answer them but he had expected them; it was surprising to him that they didn't ask those questions
The fact that he had everything he could ever want right there, his eyes started to tear up. Not crying was one of his strong suits and apparently once he started, he couldn't stop.
Harry screamed in his sleep. It wasn’t the first time that night, either. The whimpering had occurred since they had rescued him, but it started in earnest around midnight. The screaming started shortly after. Narcissa couldn’t take it anymore. She turned to the doorway and started yelling at Dumbledore.
The train station was crowded as per usual when Harry arrived, but he was okay with that since all the commotion prevented everyone from staring at him. He managed to get onto the train and snagged a compartment at the very back all to himself. He was excited to talk to his friends again, but Ron never came to find him. Hermione had come to talk to him about their schoolwork and had even helped him with one of his essays he was stuck on, but she left shortly after to find some of her girlfriends.
They, at least, got to kiss each other whenever they wanted. Draco didn't have that choice. He didn't have the pleasure of waking up next to the one he cared about. He didn't have that-and yet they did.
He watched, utterly helpless, as flashes of different colored lights lit up the blond hair of the unconscious man. He began to cry for the second time since he was one and his aunt's scream woke him up.
Harry gasped and lifted his head. He didn’t feel the horrible loneliness as strongly as before. It was still there, aching in the background, but Harry could finally think again. It wasn’t consuming him anymore. He laid back, opening himself up for the first time in days. The stretching would do him good.
“I’m afraid I don’t think there is. But we’ll revisit that in a moment. Is there any particular reason you don’t want to go home? Or feel that you can’t?” Memories flashed before his eyes, phantom pains rearing their ugly heads with the imagined voice.
“Harry, you can’t help everyone. Sometimes, people are beyond our capabilities. And that’s okay. You might not have the skillset to help him; or he just doesn’t want to be helped by anyone. That’s not your fault. Just because you have to give up on someone, doesn’t make you a bad person. It simply means you’re acknowledging that they’re beyond your reach and it’s healthier for you to let them go.” Harry nodded and tried to ignore the way his heart squeezed.
"Do you want to know why he didn't come back?" Harry nodded, enraptured by what his godfather was telling him. "He was caught. He was killed, murdered in cold blood, by a Death Eater." Tears were streaming down both of their faces. Harry never suspected anything between the two, but now he thought about it, it explained a lot.
He sped up when he heard a small rustle. It had sounded like someone shifting when they were upset. Small, fast movements, almost to the point of being jerky. He paused at the door to the tent and looked back at the pictures of Sirius and Elizabeth. Two complete opposites, yet Harry suspected that if they weren't cousins they would have made a great pair.
"And then, all too soon, he went out to spy for Dumbledore...he promised he would come back. He never did.
He pushed the door open and sneaked inside before shutting the door softly. Harry was on the floor in the far corner of the room, wings wrapped firmly around him. The door had helped muffle the sobs, but Draco could see now that the wings were absorbing most of the sound.
"Basic survival spells. You learned them yourself. Nutrition spells to keep you going until you find real food, cleaning spells, sleeping spells so you feel rested until you can sleep. I never left this chair."
He sent the letter off and resisted the urge to simply urinate out of the window. He’d been holding it for longer than he thought and had been waiting for the locks to let him use the bathroom when it dawned on him.
"No...it's fine. I'm just not used to talking about her. No one ever knew...Not even my father knew. I've only ever talked about her with Mother." He could feel his resolve slipping. Giving in, he took her charm and enlarged it.
"Look, this is ridiculous. I'm tired of feeling awkward around people, so spill. What's bothering you?" Draco's voice lifted him from his little mini internal rant at himself for feeling like he should be talking.
"I never knew about you to be honest. And I can say, I'm a little disappointed that I haven't met you before. You seem like a delightful person. Much more so than when I met your brother."
“Goodness, yes! Draco was incredibly active as a little boy and absolutely loved spending time with his father. I know he can seem cold at times, but he’s much more open at home with family and those that won’t judge him for showing emotions.” Harry could practically see it, Draco playing with his father in the study. The image brought a smile to his face.
“Well, you can do it so easily, it must be easy for you to teach it as well. Unless you just don’t have to try for anything in defence.”
