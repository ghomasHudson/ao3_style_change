Draco spins around just in time to see a flash of green light burst forth from the end of Bellatrix’s wand and hit the headmaster square in the chest. His kindly expression goes blank, and Draco can only watch in shock as his body tumbles backwards over the railing and down to the grounds below. She killed him. She didn’t have to, she wasn’t bound to a code of any sort, and yet she killed him. Horror sweeps through Draco’s body at the cold-blooded murder he’s just witnessed, but he feels a hand on his shoulder, pulling him away.
A while later, they are joined on the tower by Professor McGonagall, who takes one glance at the boys and immediately begins to reprimand them. “What did you mean by being up so late Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy?” she asks. Neither one of them responds, and her gaze drifts to the bodies of Fenrir Greyback and Bellatrix Lestrange, still stunned from the events of the evening. Draco watches the wheels click in her head, and suddenly her wand is up, pointed directly at him.
Nothing happens, and Harry wants to cry. Scream. Let someone knock him out, if only for the pleasure of being unaware for a short while. Knowing sleep isn’t going to come, he stands up and pulls on the Invisibility cloak to wander around Hogwarts.
In the back of his mind though is the half-formed image of a boy with black hair, emerald eyes, circular glasses, and a sad smile on his face. The boy tells him the same thing that Dumbledore has just said.
“Harry, do as I say. Trust me.” The words echo for a moment while Harry stands still. “Trust me,” says Dumbledore again, and Harry does. He goes to the stairs and steps below, watching as Draco steps forward, his wand raised. The anguish in the mercury eyes is overwhelming, and Harry wants to go above, pull Draco into a hug, but he knows he can’t. Instead, he simply listens.
“I said no noise. Crucio!” With an almost casual flick of his wand, Draco was thrown into the air, writhing in agony. As he was thrown, the knife stuck in his calf came free and he doubled over in pain. Blood coursed down his leg, making a pool on the floor but the wizard didn’t relent. Again and again, Draco felt the pain rack his body until his vision became hazy at the edges. “Please,” he choked out in a half-whisper. “Stop.”
“Who else is here? I heard you talking,” Draco bursts out at the headmaster. He wants to delay this, go back in time to when he sat right here, pouring his heart into the piano, Harry at his side. The words come out desperate and he knows exactly why. He could have sworn he heard Harry’s voice, but the Gryffindor is nowhere in sight.
Another crash comes from below, and Draco sees a spark of admiration in the headmaster’s eyes. “There are others,” he says. “How?”
Draco looks down, unable to move or protest. He realizes he’s holding his breath for some reason and lets it out slowly, not wanting Ha – Potter to move away. He focuses his mind, trying to correct his slip-up. Potter, yes that’s right, Potter is rolling his sleeve back with a gentle touch. His hands are warm and rough yet extremely careful as they brush across the tattoo and – Draco wonders when he started caring about how Har –
He limped into one of the bathroom stalls, sinking down with his back against the greenish wall. The peeling paint and broken sinks made the place practically abandoned, which was perfect for Draco and his needs. Even Myrtle ignored this place now.
From where he waits below, Harry can see Draco perfectly, and the sight is heart-wrenching. The hawthorn wand is shaking in the Slytherin’s grip, and the look of anguish has intensified from earlier. All Harry can do is hope that the unforgivable curse doesn’t roll off of Draco’s lips, because that will mark the moment when they truly separate, and after that, Harry knows he won’t be able to do anything to bring the Draco he now knows back.
Draco looked up into Granger’s piercing hazel eyes. He hoped he hadn’t flinched at the name, but knew he had when she quickly apologized for having startled him.
he realizes, and a flash of hope lights him up. Maybe, just maybe, there’s a chance that Draco won’t cross the line, won’t allow the Death Eaters to make him into a monster.
A shift occurs, and Harry watches the Slytherin’s shoulders curve in ever so slightly as the music becomes even more poignant. And, to Harry’s surprise, he watches Malfoy’s pale fingers tremble more as he presses on with the same melody over and over. It’s the last observation that impacts Harry the most because it makes Malfoy seem far more human than before. Something he’s been refusing to see lately.
Draco doesn’t want to. He wants to stun Potter, then keep playing for days so he can avoid the inevitable task that looms before him. “You wouldn’t understand, Potter. Just go back to your dorm. I don’t need your pity.”
Two months ago, the war had officially ended. Harry Potter had killed the Dark Lord, bringing peace to the wizarding nations for the first time in decades, and even the wizards in other regions had taken a full month or so off work to revel in the peace. Draco, however, had barely a day to celebrate his newfound freedom before it was snatched away once more. He remembered being given his verdict as clearly as if it were yesterday.
Harry is sick and tired of people not believing him whenever he claims someone is innocent, so his tone crackles with annoyance as he speaks. “Yes, I am. Bellatrix used the cruciatus curse, and if Draco hadn’t stunned her, I would be dead. She tried to kill us, Professor.” He stays right next to Draco, unsure what is going to happen. Surely Snape has told her . . . or maybe he simply didn’t know what happened to stop the curse.
“Get Severus,” the headmaster says weakly, lowering himself down onto the steps. “Wake him, and tell him what happened. Speak to no one else.”
“Malfoy,” the wizard said from the hallway, practically spitting out the name. Draco scrambled to his feet nervously, holding onto the wall for support and trying to keep his weight off of his bandaged leg. The usual cold water routine followed and Draco shifted himself so that the bandage wasn’t soaked as well.
Harry laughs, relieved that Draco is okay with this. “I think I won you over, actually,” he says, earning him a resigned eye roll. “Let’s talk tomorrow, yeah?”
She turns to Snape, a question in her eyes. He nods his head, then says, “I need to speak with Draco in my office. Come, Draco.”
Shocked, Draco looks over his shoulder to where Harry lies on the ground, writhing in agony as Bellatrix flourishes her wand. The impact of what’s happening hits Draco suddenly, and he realizes that it’s his side torturing the others, not the other side taking away his power. Without thinking, Draco raises his wand and sends a silent stunning spell directly at Bellatrix’s head, knowing his aim will fly true. It does. The screaming ceases, and the tower falls silent once more.
“Malfoy!” he thought he heard someone say, but he must have been hallucinating. Nobody cared enough to stop him now. Letting go of the cold metal, he closed his eyes and allowed the wind one last chance to play with his hair.
Below, Harry watches Draco’s shaking hand, hoping and praying that he won’t change his mind just because of the Death Eaters up there. He raises his wand, trying to get a clear view of Bellatrix and the others, but not sure what he’ll do, even if he gets the chance. A sound from behind makes him lower his wand, and he spins around to see Snape standing there, a finger on his lips. Although Harry doesn’t want to trust him, something in his posture makes Harry obey instantly, watching above once more to try and see how this will play out.
A pleased look crosses his face for a moment, vanishing almost instantly. Draco sits down with his back straight, resting his fingers on the keys for a moment. Then, as if he can’t stand waiting anymore, he begins to play.
Why did either of them even care in the first place? They’d only get hurt if they were close to him, and Draco had to hurriedly remind himself that they weren’t even
Draco hears another creak but nothing follows. After he’s passed ten minutes in silence, save for the music, he lets himself cry, welcoming the tears as they run down his face and spill onto his dark gray hoodie. Tomorrow, at this time, he will be a monster. Evil. Unforgivable. But right now, he doesn’t mourn his innocence – he knows he’s always been cruel and unkind to others. Right now, he mourns his loneliness.
They part ways, each going to their own dormitories, but both look back just once. There’s an echo of laughter, and then they keep going, knowing that tonight, at least, they can look forward to the promise of tomorrow for one of the first times in ages.
On that ominous note, the man turned and left down the hallway, his small scorpion Patronus scuttling along next to him. As the protective bubble of the scorpion vanished, two dementors returned, and Draco tried desperately to keep himself from another night of terrible memories, knowing that tonight – or today – he would be tossed into a land of endless pain amid green light and cold laughter.  Despite the fact that he clenched one hand until the point where it hurt, the chill settled into his bones after a minute or so and he could feel himself drifting off into that dreamlike maze of half-truths and horror.
Both of them stare at each other for a moment, neither one speaking. Harry is the first one to look away, a small flush creeping up his cheeks. He decides to answer his own question. “I’m not letting this go,” he says quietly. When Draco doesn’t answer, panic builds up in Harry’s chest, and that confirms how he’s been thinking he feels. He wouldn’t be scared to lose someone if they meant nothing, so he knows he at least feels something. Draco still doesn’t answer, so Harry speaks again. “Please say something.”
With a look of disdain, the wizard lowered his wand. “Trust me, this isn’t the end or even the worst. You deserve it, you know.
There’s a pause while Draco tries to see how he feels about being called his first name by Har – Potter. Despite what he knows Lucius and the Dark Lord will surely think, he decides he likes the way it sounds.
Shadowy figures join the headmaster and Draco on the tower, and Harry, from his position below, listens to the light banter that occurs.
As Potter’s finger hits the wrong key again, Draco knows he must be faking it for whatever reason. Instead of feeling betrayed, however, Draco plays the measure for Potter once more, knowing somehow that he likes hearing Draco play. The thought is confirmed when Potter says, “You’re a decent player, for a Slytherin.”
Harry watches a blush rise in Draco’s cheeks and he smiles again. “Play it once,” he says softly. Draco reaches across him to play as requested, and Harry’s breath catches at how close they are to one another.
THE DAYS PASSED, and he could feel himself slipping, not wanting to be there anymore. But each time he tried to stop caring and just give in, the guard halted that. He wanted Draco to feel the pain, to scream as the curse ripped him apart. It had occurred to Draco that those years of self-loathing and hatred hadn’t been in his own mind. That had all been the truth.
It’s been nearly five minutes when Harry breaks the silence. “You’re one of them,” he says, hating that he was right. That another innocent has been forced to the Dark Side.
The wizard launched into an obviously practiced explanation of how Draco had stolen the knife when the guard had entered his room, intending to kill himself with it. The witch nodded along with the explanation, not even questioning why the guard had been in the room in the first place. She pulled the bandage tighter, and Draco found himself wondering if she could heal it with a wave of her wand. Surely if an untrained guard could help a broken ankle in a minute then a trained healer could heal a wound similarly? But he didn’t ask, knowing that the healer’s presence was the only thing keeping the guard from hurting him.
Harry wakes up, sweat coating his entire body. He rubs his hands against his legs rather shakily, trying to calm his racing heartbeat. A minute passes, then two. Slowly, as always, his breathing returns to normal and he starts to calm down. The Boy Who Lived rolls over, trying to go back to dreamland. Even nightmares are better than lying awake.
Near the railing, Harry takes a ragged breath, his arms still shaking slightly. From experience, Draco knows his head is probably ringing and he feels oddly detached from the world. This in mind, the Slytherin runs over, meaning to assist him, but is pulled back by Snape.
The sight shocks him. He’s expecting an older Ravenclaw, maybe even a younger Hufflepuff student needing some time to think. He sees neither. What is unmistakably Draco Malfoy’s blond hair glints in the moonlight, and Harry’s stomach does an odd little flip flop.
Harry doesn’t move, even as Dumbledore repeats himself. He can’t let Snape come here, especially considering what Draco implied the night before, with his task. Harry knows that Snape is close to Voldemort, and will likely be helping Draco to keep Dumbledore weak. “Professor . . .”
“Bloody Gryffindors,” Draco replies. “You and your stupid hero complex. You almost got yourself killed, you idiot!” It’s only when he pulls back that he realizes what he’s just admitted. That he’s scared for Harry’s life. A smirk crosses Harry’s face, and Draco averts his gaze. He’ll never live that admission down.
Granger was right. He didn’t care. If he stopped caring entirely maybe he’d be kicked out of Hogwarts and every half-hearted attempt he’d made at being normal again would be insignificant. They’d deem him a lost cause, and he could go back to Azkaban, where he’d be reminded why he could never be that carefree boy playing Quidditch on the field.
Draco is somewhat shocked at how clearly Harry interpreted his feelings on the tower. “I might have been able to live,” he says. The look in the emerald eyes is stricken and Draco immediately puts a hand on Harry’s shoulder to stop him from leaving quite yet. “But I wouldn’t have had a life, knowing I killed an innocent man.”
He dug his nails into the palm of his right hand in an attempt to ground himself, but he knew it wouldn’t work as well as he wanted it to. Instead, he stared forwards at the wall, trying to collect his thoughts.
“Suicide risk,” the guard said smugly in response. “Can’t let you have these. You may strangle yourself.”
For a second, Draco stood still, paralyzed with fear. Then he moved, but the knives followed him, finding their marks in his hand, his calf, his foot, bringing a wave of dizziness with them. With a sharp intake of breath, Draco slipped forwards, catching himself just before slamming his face on the stone floor. He barely had a moment of relief until the wizard shook his head. “Stand up,” he taunted, and Draco could hear the sadistic laughter in his voice. Shakily, Draco rose to his feet, gasping again at the pain in his lower leg. When he’d broken his ankle on that first day, the guard had splinted it easily, flicking his wand to dispel the pain. This time, Draco had a feeling the guard wouldn’t mind pulling the knife out and letting him bleed out on the floor.
“Like cursing Katie Bell, hoping she would curse me in turn? Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison? Forgive me, Draco, I cannot help but feel these actions are so weak your heart can’t really have been in them.”
“Hungry, Malfoy?” asked the wizard. He opened the door and Draco flinched in expectation of the water. “Too bad. You know you can’t eat. Traitors don’t deserve food.” Contradicting his words, the guard moved the plate forward with his foot until it was right in front of Draco.
It was a halfhearted attempt at punishment, he realized, sitting back on his heels. He hadn’t even bled. So, with a deep breath to steel himself, Draco dug the knife in deeper and twisted.
“Let me go,” he said, but the person only held on tighter, dragging him farther across the stone. Those tears rose up again, and this time he let them out, seething at the unfairness of it all. He’d been so close to freedom. So close. “Please,” he begged through his tears, “just let me leave. It’ll be easier. Just let me go.”
They sit there for nearly an hour, Harry learning the piece while Draco both teaches and pokes fun at him in equal measures. The occasional joke is made, but for the most part, the atmosphere is almost reverent. Harry keeps messing up as the clock strikes two, but he does this on purpose so he can see the relaxed look on Draco’s face as he plays.
Harry lets Draco’s words sink in, feeling stupid for having gotten his hopes up that something would change. He wants the Slytherin to relax again, but now there’s an awkward silence that isn’t even punctured by music. Suddenly, Harry gets an idea. “Teach me how to play,” he says.
The pain hit Draco before he even had time to register the curse, and it was more horrid and all-consuming than he remembered from before. He had never been burned alive, but he imagined this was what it felt like. Every muscle in his body screamed for relief. None came. Again, the wizard raised his wand and Draco cried out as his body was thrown skywards once more, landing on the stone with a crack that made him sure he’d broken a bone.
“Severus,” Dumbledore says, and Harry watches the silvery gaze flick down, looking right at him. In them is a silent apology, and suddenly Harry realizes what Snape is going to do. He’s going to complete Draco’s task, and Dumbledore knows it. “Please.”
“What is it?” he asked, closing his book with a soft sigh. She was probably going to ask something about Potter, but Draco was sure he didn’t know anything about the Gryffindor that she didn’t. Her hesitant words, however, weren’t about Potter at all.
Harry laughed and darted off to the long queue winding its way down a path marked ‘This Way to the Blarney Stone.’
Draco wasn’t sure he liked any of the implications of that statement, even if he had perfected his wandless warming charms over the course of last Easter, after Potter had taken his wand. There must have been a look on his face because Potter quickly lost his smirk and he began to flail and apologise.
Even knowing how bad it sounded, Harry was glad the trip was basically over. He couldn’t wait to be back home with Draco, away from all the people. No matter how lovely they were, they were still right there, all the time, and Harry was looking forward to locking the world out from tonight until he had to leave for work on Monday. Just him and Draco, at home together. They could visit with their friends and family throughout the week and over next weekend.
over the entrance—and Potter didn’t even know the men who ran the shop and laughed when Draco asked if he could meet the proprietors) to get a ‘jacket’ later that afternoon.
Everyone around them laughs, some commenting on the fact that they're a sweet couple or that Draco is well within his rights to move the anniversary (mostly wives) or that being able to change the date must spice things up in the bedroom (Maude, the vixen).
Harry was not looking forward to Draco getting bitchy with him when he began to feel the claustrophobia of being surrounded by so many people. Harry would offer him the window seat for the next leg of the journey. To save his boyfriend’s sanity, of course, not for any other motives.
Draco asked John as many questions as was polite, while Harry chatted with Deirdre about Teddy and her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.
Harry isn’t sure if they were dating before they moved into a flat together after their training was done.
The next morning, Draco was a little worse for wear, especially considering that they had another hours-long coach journey to make, but Harry knew they were both satisfied. They hadn’t been able to spend an entire night having sex in months, if not years. They both have hectic jobs that require their attention, and they care too much about their abilities to go in on low sleep over something preventable. But today they have a morning travelling through the Irish countryside; they can doze if they need to.
It is during his time at Shell Cottage that Harry runs out of parchment and begins to draw on himself.  The images swirl across his skin, bend in the creases of his arms, twist across the panes of his stomach.  It is difficult to draw on skin, to find the pressure that will transfer the ink from the quill without hurting him or cutting into him.  And the angles are awkward, and the images change with his movements, with his breath.  But the ink washes off with his sweat, when he bathes, and it isn’t permanent.  Sometimes he wishes it was.
The afternoon in Waterford began at Waterford Crystal. The store was filled with crystal baubles, figurines, and glassware. Draco picked up a candle holder for Hermione, that he and Harry could give her for Christmas, and matching vases for his aunt and mother. He also bought a lovely crystal owlet for Harry, as a surprise for his birthday.
Draco forgets that Harry should not be left in charge of planning trips when he declares that, finally for this year’s anniversary, they should do something “big” and Harry claims that it’s his treat, all of it.
Harry has always loved to draw.  Okay, that’s not quite true—Harry has always loved to escape.  Hiding in the school library from Dudley and his gang, reading fantasy novels that weren’t allowed in the house because magic, imagination, anything even remotely “unnatural” or “not normal” were expressly prohibited and seen as dangerous by his relatives, eventually became enjoyable to Harry; it offered him access to a different world.  When he found the superhero comic books and the worlds of men and monsters, heroes and villains, good and evil, he learned to love drawing.
, not to mention antiquated and utterly unfounded, and he no longer had to pretend that he felt the way his father and his mad aunt wanted him to.
Draco jolted when they arrived in Waterford—he had spent the entire morning dozing and had fallen asleep just after they started through Tipperary. Harry nudged him as he shifted to allow Elin and Maude into the aisle.
Draco was excited to explore Killarney for the afternoon, as the castle and boat ride were the only excursions for the day.
They still hadn't had a “big thing” as Harry called it, but they had spent weekends away, gone to the cinema or the theatre, and even spent a weekend being Muggle London tourists.
It was in sixth year, after the Department of Mysteries, after the broken nose and potions book, when Harry began to use coloured inks.  The blacks were darker this year, the greys lighter, but the colours vibrant.  Flashes of greens like the killing curse, the morsmordre, his mother’s eyes; reds the colours of blood—fresh, watery, drying, old—and flecks of silver like the patronous, like a set of weary eyes in a gaunt face, like the ghosts of the castle.  Harry began to draw people: the professors, the ghosts, the students in the Gryffindor common room or the library or the Great Hall.  Piles upon piles upon piles of portraits of Draco Malfoy growing progressively gaunter and more frightened and more harried as he exits the Room of Requirement.  Piles upon piles upon piles upon
“We aren’t going to do a big thing this year,” he decided. “You still have classes and I’ll be starting a new rotation next month. We can do a big thing in two years, once you’re done school and rotations. And in the meantime, we can pick a new date. I don’t want to celebrate us on the same day everyone is celebrating me.” But mostly, he wanted the day he celebrated Draco and him being together to be on a day that nothing else fell on, so it could really be just about them.
The people around them cheer—then begin hooting and hollering when Draco yanks Harry up into a quick, but passionate, snog.
It is not Voldemort he remembers in the Great Hall, after everything has ended; it is the Malfoys.  Without hesitation he draws them, achingly awkward and so grateful to have survived, to be together.  He draws the Weasleys as they mourn Fred, draws the still faces of Tonks and Remus through his tears, sketches the scenes of life and death that litter the Great Hall in the aftermath, the little tableaux each family creates.
They moved into a cozy flat not too far from St. Mungo’s, where Harry was due to start a year of full-time placement, but still within a comfortable apparition for Draco, who was continuing on with his specialization in Mind Healing. It’s on the third floor of a somewhat small apartment complex, has an en suite off the master bedroom, a second bedroom, a second toilet with a shower, and an open concept kitchen-living-dining space.
“So to see these women—it was enlightening.  Also, it turns out, I was maybe a little gay.  Who knew?” And as she laughed, she smiled at Elin, and Harry, and Draco.  “So, how’d you realise you prefer dick, so to speak?”
to Wales for a weekend, but he also didn’t want to have to cross the Severn bridge at any hour of the evening. So, he made the hop to one of the approved Cardiff apparition points, waited for Harry to arrive, and they headed to a hotel in the heart of the city.
After the Death Eater trials, where he had spoken for and against various Death Eaters, where he had testified for Draco and Narcissa Malfoy, where he had testified against Snatchers and Ministry Officials, and Dolores Umbridge and Crabbes and Goyles and Notts and Lestranges; where he had talked and talked and
A brewery tour and tasting before dinner might not have been the responsible choice, but Harry stood by their decision. Besides, they ate enough at dinner, joining another pair from their group, Joyce and Dhillon, to make up for any real drunkenness.
“Don’t worry, dear. You don’t need to be spry for everything,” one old lady, whose name Draco didn’t know, leered with a wink.
. That’s fine; Draco gets on well with octogenarians, and they always like Harry ‘What a Polite Young Man’ Potter.
Draco led the way in the direction he suspected Killarney was, following the path of hotels, signage, and the church spires in the distance. They passed a local brewery on the way into the town and agreed to stop in on their way back to the hotel for dinner.
Luckily, Draco found him endearing, laughing at his expense as he said, “Don’t worry your pretty little scarhead about it, I’ve only started counting since you turned down that girl at the Muggle club on your birthday to come home and have ice cream with me while watching Baking Show.”
Harry had them check out before seven in the morning and catch a cab across town the moment they left the hotel.
“We saw you two sneak out of the show early last night… Did you have better plans?” Elin leered as Maude laughed.
The women seated next to them on the coach almost certainly noticed the difficulty Draco had sitting, but they did nothing but wink and giggle. Draco responded with a smug smirk while Harry tried not to blush. This was worse than being teased about concierge condoms.
Harry could only sigh, because that was his birthday last year—they'd be celebrating their one-year anniversary in a month and Harry hadn’t even been certain they were dating.
Harry froze while taking off his shirt. “Fuck, I hope so…” He rushed to the bags and rummaged around. “Dammit, fuck, and shit, it doesn’t look like we brought any.” Harry paused to consider. “I could walk to the chemist’s in town—we passed one while exploring the other day.”
Everything was actually going very well, in Harry’s opinion, until they arrived at their room for the night.
And while he thought and planned and worked and drew and tattooed himself and others, and researched and sketched, and went to Hogwarts to capture the destruction left behind and help with the rebuilding, there were still teas with Narcissa at the Manor, and with Andromeda in her flat, and lunches at the Burrow, and Grimmauld Place to clean and order and make liveable.  By the time he had moved into Grimmauld Place completely, and Narcissa and Andromeda were having tea there, together, with Teddy, and Draco Malfoy was finished with his house arrest, and was coming to tea, too, and Ginny and Dean and Seamus were all together, Harry knew what he wanted to give Draco.
be the complete pillock Draco knows him to be. But Draco would never, ever, say anything of the sort out loud.
“Right! It’s so fucking magical here.” Harry did not understand why they were both so drunk. They clearly were, however, so maybe it didn't matter how it happened. He just didn't normally swear in front of older people. He wasn't
They sat at a table for four with two other members of their tour—an elderly couple by the names of John and Deirdre. John was a retired physician who started his training as a boy during the Second World War, while Deirdre taught primary until she'd retired ten years ago; but it was her first year without being on a list of possible substitutes in her county and they were taking this particular trip to inaugurate a new tradition.
What surprised him the most was that Harry rejoined him almost ten minutes before they were due to return to the coach. He was flushed from having run back to where the coach was parked, but he seemed pleased to have arrived before time. Draco gave him a kiss on his temple while Harry beamed at him—and quickly dodged as Harry tried to kiss his face.
Draco just shrugged and began boarding the coach. “I contain multitudes. It’s part of why you love me.”
“Draco,” Harry moaned, joining the queue at the bar. “I like talking to people, I like learning about them, but I didn’t need to learn everything there is to know about Deirdre, John, their possibly gay son, their maybe-not-related-to-them granddaughter, and, horrifically, their
They found that the back bench was not a bad spot to be during a scenic tour of mountains and foliage and fog, as they were able to open the curtains of the rear window and look up and behind them whenever they wanted.
“I don’t want to choose somewhere that you and your BBC RP find inherently working class,” Potter had explained with a smirk as he tugged Draco across the Eighth Year common room to where Granger was seated by the hearth.
“Something like that,” Draco hummed. “We went to the same secondary school, then roomed together in Uni, too.” And Harry was so proud of Draco for sounding so Muggle, that he would be sure to let him know that tonight.
A coach tour! He and Draco can take a coach tour to Ireland! Nothing says British Muggle Holiday like a coach trip—even if it also says British Muggle of a
Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter, the two youngest passengers on this bus, the couple celebrating their anniversary, were going to bed before midnight and had not had sex once since their vacation began.
“Don’t worry, Draco! No rock will ever be able to kiss as well as you—or ever bring me as much luck.”
Rather than the double or king he’d been expecting, Harry opened the door to a room with two small twin beds, separated by a hardwood nightstand.
Harry suspects that they were likely dating before the move, because they only discussed the second bedroom in terms of “should we use it as a guest room or convert it into a study?” and they had been sharing a bed for the better part of a year and a half at that point.
It all started during Eighth Year, during their Muggle Studies class, which had been made mandatory for all returning students. Draco was actually somewhat interested in the material—he knew that the Pureblood ideologies he was raised with were, to put it gently,
“You are not coming anywhere near me with those lips of yours until I know they’ve been cleaned and well sanitized,” Draco informed him.

was what you called your preferred stationery store in the first place). “Never mind, that was a dumb question—”
There is death, everywhere, and curses and blood and children.  Harry wants to capture the colours and sounds of the curses, simply so that they cannot hurt anyone else; he wants to lock them in parchment and ink and save everyone.
“I am hurt that you would think I'm calling just to ask you for something,” he informs her tartly. He might be making his Malfoy face. “Maybe I just wanted to call and chat with my best friend on this lovely afternoon. Did you consider that?”
a lot of places Muggles frequented, he had been to very few, and could only remember a childhood trip to the zoo because of a python that may or may not have become Nagini and a disaster with some accidental magic.
, after all. “I’m not Draco,” he muttered to himself, “so I shouldn’t be fucking swearing in front of adults who are older than me.” Joyce and Dhillon burst out laughing.
Draco forced Potter to write his proposal right there on the floor beside Granger while Draco did the same. The sooner they could complete their two visits of the term, the sooner Draco could write his papers on them and worry about other classes.
“Maybe if we were going to Camden Market you could get away with the cloak,” Potter had told him, “but with the museum crowds, you’d be better off looking like a public school pillock and being a bit cold. I’m sure you know wandless warming charms by now,” he’d added, smirking.
“Right, that’s at the very back, gents,” the driver told them. He was maybe ten years their senior and had a slight Welsh accent. “We’ve just got three more pick-up points, then we’ll be heading for the ferry! Head on up to your seats, and don’t forget to buckle up.”
Between sessions of sketching and discussions and kissing and drinking, Harry managed to convince Draco that he could change the shape of the Mark, use charms and ink, and turn if from the snake and skull into a flower and forever.  The snake filled in, wrapping into infinity; the skull replaced with a Zinnia in full bloom—the remembrance of absent friends, forever.
It wasn’t actually that long until they stopped again, but this time it wasn’t for a tea break and a trip to the loo. They had arrived at their hotel for the night.
“Bigger the fool me. I’m going to explore the grounds—if you aren’t at the bus in time for departure, I’m having the driver leave you behind. I could use the extra space; there are some lovely little shops here and I’m sure Mother and Aunt Andromeda would both appreciate a small token.”
Harry rolled his eyes even as he rebuked, “Like you were in any better shape, git. You were snoring before your head even hit the pillow.”
“It was a bit of an awakening, actually,” she told Harry (and Draco, who was paying rapt attention even as he looked out the window).  “I had never seen sexuality and sensuality displayed like that before.  I was raised in a time and with a family where you didn’t talk, or even really think, about sex.  You had children and they helped on the farm.  That was that.
And Harry was back into research, around appointments and applications for spots, and he had to figure out if he could ink over the Mark or if he had to work around, and how the charms and the needles and the inks and images would react with the latent magic left from Voldemort, despite his death.  And he had to imagine what he would paint on Malfoy’s body, what he would cover him with, what traces of his own he would leave besides bruises and bloodstains and scars.  But with his snitch and with his stars and with Malfoy’s silver eyes and pale skin and scars and bruises and pale, shining hair, Harry knew he could find something perfect.
And most importantly, he learned not to trust Harry Potter with the planning and preparation of any trip.
Draco made an affronted sound. Harry prepared himself for the now-memorised rant about how green highlighters are under-appreciated and neon yellow is not, under any circumstances, to be used to signify anything important in life—unless the only other option is neon orange, because neon orange can go fuck itself,
Harry chuckled, nodding to Draco seriously despite his amusement. “Should we do anything while we’re here?” It was Harry’s first time being this close to a stone circle, or at least one like this. Their whole Muggle Studies class in Eighth Year had been asked to meet at Stonehenge for the Summer Solstice, to watch the spectacle, even though they would have already completed the term. Almost all of them had been there.
“Call the front desk and see if they sell any. They sell toothbrushes, they should sell condoms. We can even have them charged to the room and settle it tomorrow.”
“As if,” Draco snorted and Harry made an indignant noise. “Potter here fell asleep before we could do much more than undress.”
“Known each other long, then, have you?” Maude asked, eyes glinting.  She knew the answer, Harry had already told her they grew up together.  Harry thought she was probably just a mischievous fossil, and he respected that.
Before Draco could become uncomfortable with the silence or lost in green eyes, the professor (whose name he should have made a point to learn already) called back the attention of the class.
The green is a different kind of brightness in the darkness than the gleaming bright whiteness of the station.  The angles and shapes of the station would be interesting to draw, all straight lines and Muggle architecture fading into immaterial and ether.  To capture the curse would be tedium, having drawn it thousands of time, from memory and nightmare, having seen it hundreds of times from every angle.  Even the colour is only vivid due to the surrounding darkness—it has lost its lustre through over-use and repetition.
After a quick pop into a shop for some lunch—sausage rolls and coffee—Draco began hunting for their next adventure. There was a big church in the distance, but—
Draco felt that Potter, being Muggle-raised, if not Muggle-born, should choose the first location for their Muggle Studies assignment.
“What? No? How can we? We don’t have passports or even proper government-issued ID. Even if it is just the EU, there’s still crossing back into Britain, with Muggles. We can’t go around
Harry stops drawing after the Astronomy Tower and the funeral and the Goodbyes and the parties.  He reads books in the tent with Hermione, after Ron leaves.  He tries to think, tries to piece everything together, tries to search for clues, tries to stop himself from looking through that book filled with hundreds of copies of Draco Malfoy’s face and eyes and blood, which he somehow managed to keep on his person through all the different flights and fights and trials.  But then there was Christmas at Godric’s Hollow and the nightmares are worse and Harry starts to draw again.  He draws Dumbledore in his youth, the smiling face of Grindewald, the body of Bathilda as it crumples to the floor, the face of Draco Malfoy as he is forced to torture or be tortured.  There is no colour in these images, and no charms to bring them to life—Harry doesn’t want them alive, he wants them out of him, wants to escape the pressure they create in his head, in his chest.
“We do because if you want, it can be today." Harry holds out a ring box. "Draco, will you marry me?”
They were served a full Irish breakfast in the dining room the next morning. Draco had to pass on the blood sausage, but he helped himself to the porridge with Bailey’s and brown sugar. Harry, of course, ate everything including the blood sausage. Draco refused to kiss him until he brushed his teeth.
Harry never really figures out where the idea comes from. Maybe it was stored somewhere deep in his memories of growing up in middle-class, suburban Surrey, with the more-middle-class-than-most Dursleys, but it strikes him suddenly.
, but Harry needed the distraction and the proximity to the bar. And really, Draco was only being stubborn for the hell of it.
The check-in procedure wasn’t actually very difficult, and they were spending an evening in a small, historic hotel, so they didn’t have to compete with any other tour groups for service.
He learned that trips, even impromptu accidental train journeys, need some preparation, even if it is just a handful of pounds to buy snacks before rushing through the platform before the train departs.
There were too many people, and he was stuck sitting beside a lovely older lady that he had never met before, his thigh mere inches from her own.  He wasn’t really used to being surrounded by this many people, not anymore, and he found it slightly disconcerting.
Harry noded along, understanding completely, even as Dhillon and Joyce give them the sort of indulgent looks grandparents seem to be good at. At least, Harry assumes it’s a grandparent thing; Deirdre had worn a similar look when talking about her family.
“You’ll let me snog you immediately after I’ve had my tongue up your arse, but one little peck on a public stone and now I need to be decontaminated like I’m hazardous. You really are a ponce, you know?”
Draco had thought that they were likely to be an earlier pick-up, but if there were only three more stops left, most of the group should be aboard the bus. It hadn’t looked like there was
In fifth year, all Harry’s drawings were in shades of black, from the dark greys of thunderstorm clouds to the deepest black of moonless midnights.  There was no light that year, no colour—not even the burnt russet of dried blood or the shocking vibrancy of fresh blood.  Despite the lack of colour, there was no lack of experimentation—Harry tried to capture the magic around him in quill-strokes and charm work, bringing sections of the castle alive on his parchment, capturing the movements of the stars above the astronomy tower, the clouds shifting over the Quidditch pitch, the tentacles of the Giant Squid waving from the depths of the Black Lake.
When they joined Maude and Elin at their table for breakfast, both women greeted them with cheerful grins and playful ribbing.
It was during his fifth year that Harry began to draw at school.  He learned the strokes and pressures needed to commit the castle to parchment, the angles and strokes of quill, the weight of inks and parchments.  He learned to prepare his own inks, to create blends of different pigmentation and different textures.  He learned about different parchments, different quills, different charms to animate images.  He studied different styles and techniques and periods of wizarding art.  He learned about portrait making, and the magical processes involved, and how portraits interact with each other, and why.  But even as he learned more about oil and canvas, he stuck with parchment and quill and black ink.
But then Ron comes back and there is no reason to draw anymore, no time to draw anymore—there is planning to do, and Horcruxes to find and destroy.  And things get better once the locket is gone, and the nightmares are less and it seems like they have a real chance at succeeding.  Until, suddenly, they don’t.  There are snatchers, and Malfoy Manor, and torture and
“That’s surprisingly good sense, Potter,” Draco responded wryly, “but I still think you could have warned me last night that we’d be leaving before even having a coffee.”
before said trip. “We should head to Cardiff after work on Friday, experience some Muggle nightlife, visit Cardiff Castle or something on the Saturday. You know, a nice little mini-vacation before our trip!”
“Malfoy? Is this your room?” Harry looked around the twin dorm, noticing the pristinely made bed, the hints of Slytherin greens and silvers in the motif of the duvet, the bookcase already overloaded with course books, the meticulously highlighted daily planner (and wasn’t it a treat to it gift to Draco the previous Christmas, only to have to take him to every Muggle stationary from Edinburgh to Cardiff to ensure that he was able to find one to call ‘his local,’ as if a
Harry stops drawing again after they leave Shell Cottage.  There is no more time—everything is coming to a head to quickly and he can hardly keep up, let alone capture it on his arms or on the bits of parchment he was able to scrounge up before leaving the Cottage.  Before he is completely ready, they are at Hogwarts and he no longer wanted to draw.  He can’t imagine attempting to capture the faces of children before they go to war; it is not a record that should be made, and as much as he wants to escape that reality, putting it on parchment would prove that it had existed; putting it on his body would kill him.
“Well, Draco, according to this memo provided to me, this is my dorm room for the year. So, I guess I need to ask: what are you doing here, in my room?” Harry leaned against the doorframe, ankles crossed, as he waited for Draco to react.
“I’m not getting condoms from a hotel front desk! And I don’t want to be seen by any of the old ladies when I pick them up there or settle the tab tomorrow.”
Draco took one look around the room and smirked. “Look on the bright side, Potter. You get a bed tonight, rather than a couch or the floor.”
Hermione is, as always, the best. The brightest witch of their generation. And he tells her as much.
The second tattoo he gave was to George, about a month after the war.  Then, matching ones for Ron and Hermione; an entire mural on Luna’s back; a sleeve for Dean, and one for Seamus; one of Lavender’s shoulder blades; and Charlie, and Bill, and eventually there were enough people interested to warrant opening a small shop and studio in Diagon Alley.
“Where is the stone circle located?” Draco asked at the tourist information centre. Harry gaped at Draco, which was somewhat uncouth, but also, somehow, endearing. Draco ignored him, to the best of his abilities, while he listened to the Muggle giving him walking directions. There was a path, and they could get cycles to get there faster if they wanted, but it wasn’t an outrageous journey to make on foot.
“We’ll grab pasties for breakfast once we get to the pick-up point,” Harry explained, as the cab sped through central Cardiff. “There’ll probably be a Gregg’s nearby. There’s one around every corner here, from the looks of it.” Harry hesitated. “We need to be at the pick-up point by eight a.m., and I thought we should be early—the company said they wait if they arrive early, but if they don’t have to wait for us, we can be on the road faster, right?”
“No faeries, thank Merlin,” Draco muttered to himself. “Those little fuckers are after my hair, I swear, Potter. Never ask me to attend a midsummer’s event near a faerie circle.”
, Potter. You know it’s too sticky to be practical. Let’s just fool around in the shower—but I’m holding you to the gelato.” Draco pulled himself off the bed and headed, naked, to the bathroom. “I can’t believe we forgot to fucking pack condoms… it’s a fucking anniversary holiday and we didn’t pack anything for sex…” Draco muttered the entire way to the shower.
dating. Excellent. Good to know. Um, not to be…whatever…but, um, how long, exactly have we been dating for? So I can be sure to do something for our anniversary.”
The show was good, but Harry was stifling yawns by nine and he could tell that Draco was no better. They finished their drinks and headed back to their room. They did little more than kiss for a bit before passing out, alarm set for 6:15 the next morning.
This was entirely Potter’s fault. Merlin save him from speccy gits.  It was lucky Draco loved the git anyway.
Harry sat in the middle again, chatting with Maude and Elin, as they began their journey into Ireland.  Even though he had only met them a few hours ago, he was already very comfortable with them—they were both sassy old things, and Elin could out-swear a sailor.  Harry, Draco noticed, didn’t retain his ‘these are old people and I should be polite around them’ sensibilities long.  They had all but disappeared by the time Maude finished her story about the time she accidentally accompanied her late husband and his mates to a gentleman’s club.  Her husband had been mortified, having no idea that his friends were taking him somewhere like that, nor any idea why they hadn’t changed the plan when Maude had decided to join them for the evening.  Maude, for her part, had been both embarrassed and aroused.
“Wonderful, thank you,” Draco responded on instinct, all manners and politeness, as was proper for a Malfoy. “How are you lovely young ladies today?” He smiled at them as he was finally able to take his seat in the centre of the bench, Harry having shuffled into the window seat.
The few members of their tour that were still gathering their bags snickered at Draco, and Harry flushed crimson when he realised how many people had heard at least part of Draco's rant.
“We're only here for an hour, and you want to spend the whole time in line behind a gaggle of Muggle tourists.” Draco sighed, exasperated. “Whatever, it’s your trip, too. I will explore the gardens and the rest of the castle while you have your fun tonguing a rock.”
For Muggles, it probably wasn’t much—a feat of engineering, another thing to discuss in a history class or as proof of alien or divine intervention. But for Harry and Draco, for those who used magic or felt magic or
The beauty of the Ring of Kerry allowed them both to forget about their feelings of inferiority (who would have known that octogenarians were so rowdy??). The trees surrounding the narrow road were vibrant, and the mountains around them were damp with precipitation from the constant fog.
Hopefully, Harry was right about there being a stop early on, because Draco was going to need more tea if he was forced to be
He explains his dilemma, what he wants from the trip, the fact that they can’t leave the UK and that he wants to go full Muggle, when she interrupts.
Draco enjoyed exploring the castle grounds, the ancient parts of the castle he could enter, and the small walk of tourist shops full of Royal Dalton and Irish knits. He ended up buying a quaint chintz tea set for his mother, and a set of tea mugs in a similar pattern for his aunt.
“I really need your help!” He’s pleading before he even registers it. It’s practically a conditioned response at this point.
So, something local. But not too local—they’ve done enough in London for now, and they want to have more options for the future, too.
“What do you need, Harry?” sighed through a mobile is the response he gets when Harry's done peppering his best friend with praise (although all of it is true).
“There’s no need, and there isn’t really much that can be done, anyway. With a circle as stable as this one, attempting anything may actually cause harm—wizards are only meant to harness the wild magic of a stone circle when in dire need or when the magic needs to be released and rebalanced. That’s why there are so many in Ireland, you know. It isn’t simply because there's more magic on the island; it's because there have been many times of great need.”
After breakfast, they headed off to Killarney, but much like the day before, they stopped before too long. They didn’t pull into a carpark at a café, though, they pulled into a carpark outside a castle.
They opted not to tour the factory, choosing instead to explore the beautiful town. It was right on a river, and the views were absolutely scenic. There was a museum not far from the crystal shop that they walked through, and they explored some interesting heritage sights nearby.
of portraits of Draco Malfoy as he bleeds out on the bathroom floor, blood pooling around him, tears drying on his cheeks, fire bright in his silver eyes.  These sketches, studies of Draco Malfoy in ink on parchment, never move—Harry avoids charming them; he draws them and quickly hides them, burying them in a box under his bed where his dorm-mates think he hides his porn.
The information on the reconstruction was informative, though Harry spent more time admiring the views of the lake around them, the islands in the near-distance. Unlike Blarney, there was no gift shop or row of boutiques—just an old stone fort surrounded by water.
without end in defence of students in his year and the year above and the years below, in defence of Pansy Parkinson and Theodore Nott and Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle and Stan Shunpike, where he spoken about his own use of the Unforgiveables and laws he broke and the people he hurt and the lives he ruined or ended or saved.  When it was all over, he went to Malfoy Manor for tea with Narcissa Malfoy and to return the wand he took from Draco Malfoy and to mention Andromeda and Teddy and where Draco Malfoy asked him how much it would cost for Harry to turn his Dark Mark into something else,
The professor carried on, introducing the rest of the syllabus and outlining some key outcomes of the course—“This is just like what you’d get in a Muggle University,” Draco heard Granger murmur when everyone received a packet of papers, rather than a ream of parchment, detailing everything the professor had discussed, including the due dates of all assignments and their weighing. She was one of the few who looked prepared to cry tears of joy. Draco thought he understood how she felt. It would be a lot easier to build a study schedule when he already knew when all of the assignments for one class needed to be done. Hell, he might even be able to work ahead.
Potter did not bother to respond, but he did make a point of taking Draco to an ‘M&S’ (a shop of some sort that sold both produce and clothing, with a big, green
“Our trip leaves from Cardiff on Sunday morning, Draco,” Harry had told him proudly at the start of the week, and Draco had tried not to worry too much that he was only hearing this
Harry just shrugged and grinned, charming and unrepentant. Draco pulled him in for a quick kiss, even if he was still a little cross about the lack of coffee.
“This year, since the Eighth Year students have the ability and the right to leave Hogwarts grounds at their own discretion, our main assignment of this course will be that you and your partner explore Muggle culture and history by completing practical research. Each pair is required to complete two trips per term to different Muggle areas, and submit papers (not two feet of parchment, as Draco was used to, but, five to ten Muggle A4 sheets) detailing the experience. Each partner is required to select one destination per term and write up a proposal for myself, and their partner, for
Draco considered the proposition—he wasn’t tired, he was a bit pent up, and as nice as a snog before bed was, he wanted the connection and intimacy of having Harry buried inside him. And they had time to kill before dinner, anyway.
“That’s not true,” Harry interjects. “You don’t get to change the date whenever you want.  We have an official anniversary date.”
“So, you’ll be rooming here… with me…” Draco trailed off, but then the situation seemed to sink in and he threw Harry a blinding smile. Harry told his heart to knock off that pounding thing it was doing. “I told you that you shouldn’t join the Aurors!” Draco crowed in delight, “I’m glad you’ve decided to try something different.” And he gave Harry a quick hug.
“West Glamorgan really does have some beautiful scenery, even in Swansea. Have you ever been, dear?”
Granger was, as Draco had long suspected, the brains of the operation, and provided the names and locations of several suitable museums to consider, as well as the option of the British Library in London, which apparently played host to both locals and tourists and would provide ample Muggle-watching opportunities.
The coach deposited them at the hotel with a reminder about both supper time and the departure scheduled for the next day, then they were free.
“It won’t work for other EU countries, but because of how magical Ireland is, there’s documentation I can get you to show at the border so they let you back in. I’ve picked your destination for you; you need to sort out the rest yourself.” And she sounds just like she did back at Hogwarts, when she wouldn’t let him and Ron copy her homework, but would do all their corrections on their drafts.
He really ought to take it off, he probably looks stupid and overly cocky, but he doesn’t want to make this feeling of belonging to someone disappear just yet. It’s good. Even if no one knows to whom his heart belongs to (stop being so sappy, Jesus), they now that he is taken. It’s good. He only wishes Draco was as enthusiastic about belonging to Harry. Maybe he’s just not ready for commitment. Maybe he wants to keep his options open, find someone to fuck him better (highly impossible, Harry fucks him best, Draco admitted so on one occasion even).
“Ohhh Good Lord yes,” Draco moans as Harry finally slips inside, first only half of his heavy erect length and then the rest of it too, fitting snugly inside Draco like that’s exactly where it’s supposed to be. “
from an unknown Hufflepuff. He had gaped at it, tore it to shreds, and held his eyes open until they watered.
Harry strode over to where Draco sat, curled up in an overstuffed armchair, and snatched the book out of his hands, ignoring the undignified noise he made. “We’re going.”
not me. I’ll be joining my father at the Quibbler, of course. I’ll get to write about all sorts of magical creatures and plant life. It’s going to be quite exciting.”
Harry felt a flush creeping up his neck and coloring his cheeks and he smiled. “Oh. Well, er- no need to thank me, really, Mrs. Malfoy. You saved my life. And please, call me Harry. I find it’s a bit less awkward if the people I live with don’t address me so formally.”
Narcissa had found their immediate family on the wall, and traced her fingers over each of their names in turn, and then paused when she reached her sister. She shook her head, looking sad and suddenly aged by grief. She sighed and then turned to Harry. “Why don’t we start in this room for our renovations tomorrow? We can replace this old tree with your family tree.”
The blood that trickled steadily from the gash on Harry’s temple was forming a dark halo beneath his head. Draco crawled over to him, heart drumming a tattoo against his Adam’s apple. He leaned over Harry, pressing his hand to the wound in a meager attempt to quell the bleeding.
Draco glanced desperately around the hallway, but there was still no sign of help. His hand was slick with warm blood, which he felt beginning to seep through his fingers. He racked his brain for anything that might help, but he knew almost nothing about healing magic. Perhaps a potion or two he knew of might have helped, but nothing that was readily available, and thus, was useless. Draco had never felt so utterly helpless in his entire life.
When he could stand the tense silence no longer, he jumped to his feet, startling Draco and Luna. “Sorry, I just-“ he looked pointedly at Draco. “I’m tired, I’m going to bed. Are you-um, going to bed?”
“Wait!” Harry cried. He sent an apologetic glance toward Ron and Hermione, who were both looking at him as if he were a stranger. “They… They can stay with me. I have a house, one that Sirius Black left for me. Put them under house arrest there. They’ll be under my care and supervision.”
After taking a few bites of their desserts, Harry took them on a quick tour of the house (besides the cellar, in which Harry was relatively certain some doxies had taken up residence), finishing in the room with the family tree stretching across the walls. Harry watched as Narcissa and Draco walked the perimeter of the room, examining the branches of the tree and pausing briefly in front of some of the names. Draco looked a bit bored, as if he had seen his family tree a thousand times. He probably had, Harry figured.
Maude and Elin raved about the previous evening’s show, while Pete, the man in the seat in front of them (who Draco almost beaned on the first morning), talked about how he and his wife, Gwyn, didn’t get back to their room until nearly two that morning, having spent their time after dinner wandering the town before doing some sort of pub crawl that ended at the hotel just minutes before the doors were locked for the evening.
While Draco went to fetch them both a tea, Harry stopped in at the Tesco Express for sandwiches and crisps. They still had sweet pastries from their Costa breakfast run, but Harry just couldn’t pass up a good crisp combo for lunch. Also, Harry was enjoying the opportunity to stretch his legs.
But Draco just shook his head, smile exasperated, and huffed a little laugh. Harry felt immensely pleased with himself, even though he tried to tell himself he didn’t.
Draco’s reaction did not disappoint. “Your… room?” He sounded absolutely flabbergasted, which was always amusing for Harry. “But… but… the Aurors?” Harry just smiled and shook his head.
So, Harry decides, they will do a coach trip, and it doesn’t even matter where it departs from. As long as they can get two seats and a double bed, they are set, as far as Harry is concerned.
But come summer, Harry would return to Privet Drive and Dudley and chores and no food and drawing.  He would spend the first few weeks of every summer holiday drawing—refreshing his skills, re-familiarizing himself with the textures of papers and pens and pencils, drawing and re-drawing the world around him in the smallest bedroom or in the library or the fields and parks, until he was back to the level he was at before he left for school.  Then he would hunt for new books in the library or reread his favourites, and learn new tricks and techniques and skills and styles, which he would practice and practice and practice until summer ended.  At least, that was his plan for each summer.  But usually, it didn’t work out that way.
In any case, Draco tried to set aside his worry and enjoy the short stay in Cardiff. There was a lot of nightlife to explore, and many clubs and pubs to pop in and out of for a drink and a dance, neither of which Draco had been able to enjoy in quite some time.
Harry just chuckled, shaking his head. Draco wasn’t even actually pissed off—he must be enjoying the trip so far, despite the hiccups caused by Harry’s last-minute booking.
” card. There is simply no speeding up some forms of bureaucracy (and creating a real person from magic is one that tends to drag).
One was dressed in a white linen ensemble, with wide-legged trousers and a long t-shirt in the exact same shade and texture, wearing a brightly-coloured patterned scarf around her neck. The other was in denim capris and a blouse. They both smiled in welcome when Harry and Draco made it to their seats, shuffling their carry-ons around to make room.
“How long have you two been married?” asks one of the older gentleman that Harry doesn’t know very well.  His name might be Brian?
He and Harry were able to explore the ship, the duty-free shop, the café, the cafeteria, and the different decks with external platforms with large viewing windows and comfy chairs. They had more tea, this time with scones and jam and cream, sitting outside and watching the endless blues of the sea and the sky.
The forest is eerie and cold, despite the warmth of May.  The shadows and shades, the sharp lines and sharp reliefs, the soft forms of his family around him, would look striking in ink, or watercolour, even though he has never used it.
The coach trip was relatively short this time as well. They were taken to Ross Castle, in the Killarney National Park.
—but he wanted to help Sara, and she really was a beautiful young thing. So, they were married right out of secondary school, and moved into Sara’s grandmother’s cottage, and raised a beautiful daughter, our Lorraine.
There wasn’t a Gregg’s, but there was a Costa, so Draco was able to get his caffeine fix and breakfast. Harry also bought a few odds and ends from the pastry display, claiming that they were “for the road,” even as he promised that there would likely be a stop before they left Wales.
“We’re here, love,” Harry murmured, as though Draco couldn’t see everyone getting off the coach and collecting their luggage from the driver. What a dope. Draco loved him.
It was during the summer following his fourth year at Hogwarts that magic started to bleed into Harry’s art.  The nightmares that kept him awake or screaming also found their way into his landscapes of Little Whining, images of darkness and masked figures and Voldemort and Cedric and gravestones and cauldrons and blackness and blood swirling through the fields and parks and cul-de-sacs.  Then came the dementor attack and the trial—and Harry was locked up in his room, drawing for hours and days and not sleeping and hardly eating, trying to get the images out of his head, to escape from this new reality, more terrifying than anything he had ever even imagined.
The dancing light as Bellatrix fell, the look and laughter on her face, so much like that of Sirius, burned itself into Harry’s mind, but he swore to never draw it—drawing her death would be a betrayal, and a mockery.  Even if it haunts him, even if he wishes to escape it, he will never draw her dying.
“Lorraine is our eldest granddaughter and is actually a mother of two already. She’s why we moved to Wales, you know. She wanted to get away from Yorkshire after her divorce but didn’t want to separate the boys from all the rest of their family—she really is a wonderful girl, and such a caring mother, I don’t know what that fool of a husband was thinking, messing about on her—and she asked us if we wanted to join her. She had found a company that had a lot of locations in West Glamorgan, and a lovely cottage in Mumbles, with a neighbouring house also for sale, and we agreed to cross the Severn with her.
Once their group had looked its fill, and the time they’d been given was up, their driver led them to a hired boat for the main excursion of the morning—a tour of the lake by boat, passing by Innisfallen Island and its ruined abbey, as well as the other islands.
Both women giggled, but it was the blouse lady, seated at her own window seat, that responded. “We’re both very excited. This is our third trip to Killarney, you know. I think our driver is different this year, though. And they seem to have switched one of our hotel stays—but I just love Ireland, especially this time of year. Have you ever been before?” And, before they could respond, “Oh, goodness me, we forgot to introduce ourselves. I’m Maude, and this is Elin.”
Harry devoured the works on art history the same way he devoured the stories of hobbits and pirates, his appetite for escape voracious.  He learned techniques and terms, practicing and doodling and drawing whenever he could—between classes, late at night, whenever he had a free moment to sit somewhere far from the little house on Privet Drive, away from Dudley and Vernon and chores and housework.  He could reimagine the world around him, capture it on paper, in ink, in lines and details and relief—and he would be someone different in this paper world, someone outside his hunger and bruises and baggy clothes and no parents.
“Yeah, alright, you posh wanker, you don’t snore. But what about the gills?” And Harry, unlike Draco, can’t get the words out without bursting into raucous laughter, joined by the women at the table with them.
Draco could tell that he had been insulted somehow, even if he didn’t understand it, but his good breeding and the teasing light in Potter’s eyes stopped him from making more than a token protest.
the location they have selected is important, either to Muggle culture or to Muggle history. Once the proposal has been approved, you may visit the locale at your leisure, but must spend at least three hours observing your destination and how Muggles are interacting with it.
. Like, not to put too fine a point on it, but he and Harry were the youngest there by a solid 40 years, at the least.
“John and I weren’t really that young when we had Philip, you know. But he was certainly young when sweet Sara next door got pregnant. He never said he did it, of course, and I’m certain he didn’t—he’s always been gayer than a mayflower, you know, a mother can
Then, eventually, shocking and wonderful, came that faithful birthday—eleven years old, and a WIZARD!  Once at Hogwarts, Harry had no need to escape, no reason to wish himself away from the real world.  Well, he had some reasons, but he never felt the same urge, the same need to draw this world, to capture it and change it—the magic, he felt, wouldn’t translate into lines and shadows the same way as the Muggle world, and so he never tried.  He would doodle during class, but they would be quick and sketchy and childish and imprecise—quills and ink and parchment were not his mediums and it showed.
It is another night on their anniversary trip where they fall asleep before ten and without getting further along than a lazy snog in bed.
“No, but they’d definitely make fun of us for the rest of the trip for it. Let’s just spell some lube and I’ll buy you a gelato after we eat.”
“Harry, you only start phone calls with compliments when you need something. So, again, what do you need?” And dammit if she isn’t right. He should really start praising her all the time so that these kinds of things don’t happen—and that’s enough Slytherin for now. Serious business.
“Thank Merlin you didn’t,” Draco agrees. “Imagine having to tell my mother that story to her face.”  Draco laughs at Harry’s sudden flush.  “I love you, you sappy git.”
Ross Castle, much like Blarney Castle the day before, was more ruined fort than the magnificent luxury of Cardiff Castle—but it was easier for Draco to enjoy them that way, Harry knew. And Harry could admit to feeling similarly.
Despite the fact that Draco was very much a swot, he never tried to push Harry into his schedule—unless they were working on an assignment as a pair, which they tried to do in any class they shared whenever the instructor even mentioned partnering students up. When they were working together, Harry respected Draco’s schedule for the project and worked to meet his deadlines.
Harry had been thinking about asking if Draco wanted to extend their holiday until Sunday, maybe head to Swansea or Mumbles, stop in at Worm’s Head. But now, he just wants to get home. And he can tell Draco feels the same.
“Dammit, Potter, were you waiting for me to tell the story to propose?  You complete sap,” Draco is choking up a little, “of course I’ll marry you.  Ugh, I can’t believe you waited until I told that stupid story to propose.  I’m telling everyone we know how gross and mushy you are.”  Even as he complains, Draco is smiling sweetly at Harry, giving him his hand for the ring.
“Well, you’ve picked the right trip, boys,” Elin grinned, “Ireland is always beautiful. Although, I’m not sure about your luck being on a full coach for your first go around. Might just put you off, honestly. But there will be lots of free walking time once we get to Erin.” And with another smile, Elin leaned back and began chatting quietly with Maude, leaving Draco and Harry to get settled as the bus trundled forward.
As the Death Eater trials begin, Harry begins studying tattoos, both the magical and Muggle, the powerful and mundane.  He learns about Dark Marks from Death Eaters and historians, theorists and survivors.  He learns about magical tattoos that shift beneath the skin, as little or as much as they want.  He learns about Muggle methodology, of needles and ink; he learns about charms and spells that do just as well.  He learns how to combine his quill and parchment and pen and paper and needles and charms to make something unique and his own.
They arrived in Killarney by mid-afternoon and checked into their hotel. This hotel, unlike the historic one in Waterford, was bustling with people and they easily spotted three other coaches in the lot.
Eventually the coach pulled into a small park with an overlook. There was another coach parked nearby, and a bus-load of tourists were already spread about the area, taking photos and pointing out different views. Draco immediately pulled Harry away from the rest of their group, heading to explore as much as possible during their twenty-minute stop.
“Swot,” Potter muttered, and Draco probably imagined that the exasperation was tinged with fondness.
or anything else he has suffered.  It is a small golden snitch on the inside of his wrist that flutters up and down his forearm and darts around his wrist, trailing stars and moons behind it.  His experience of drawing on himself allows him to capture it, display it, present it, as he wanted to.  The charms used to create its tail of stars, and to bring it to life, had tickled.
Rather than attempt to find other attractions in Cardiff, Harry suggested a train trip to Bath (“Muggle trip,” he’d said when Draco had asked why they couldn’t simply apparate; what a prat).
“Fucking Hermione,” Draco said with Harry, matching his tone.  “Too smart for her own good, that one,” Draco continued.  “And you couldn’t function half as well without her.”
“Malfoy,” Potter returned, matching his inflection. They nodded at each other as Potter took the empty seat.
He could understand what Elin had meant about the full coach being a bit of a determent. So far, the noise level and the crowding hadn’t really bothered him, but he could see it becoming an issue as the afternoon—and the trip—wore on and people started getting louder and chattier.
Maybe something tropical? But Harry and Draco don’t have Muggle passports, and with the fiddling that needs to be done to make a Pureblood show up as a real live person to the Muggle authorities, it would probably take a year to get Draco one—and that’s with Harry pulling the “I’m Harry Potter,
