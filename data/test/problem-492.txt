Harry looked down. Malfoy wasn't joking: his whole abdomen was gently rounded out, as if he were five or six months pregnant. He pressed his palm against the tight surface – the whole thing felt hard and packed now, not just his stomach. At this point, it was undeniable. He expected to feel shock or dread, but it was actually excitement that flooded his mind as he caressed his swollen form.
Harry waited almost two hours for Malfoy to finally emerge – pale and sweaty, looking for all the world like he had indeed been busy puking up his last few meals – from the Room of Requirement.
“Anyway,” he says, leaning closer to whisper into Draco's ear, “the belly really suits you.”
Draco nodded, wincing slightly as he moved his battered pelvis to a more comfortable position.
“Look, Draco,” he began eventually. Malfoy looked up, taken aback – it was the first time Harry had ever called him by his given name. “The snake is about to come up. You need to relax as much as you can.”
“Harder!” cried Malfoy, desperately pulling on his erection. “Harder, Potter! Fuck me harder!”
“Open your legs,” orders Draco, suddenly overcome with the desire to see firsthand what’s in store for himself. An ominous pain in his gut makes the issue all the more pressing.
“I mean, seems pretty obvious to me,” says Potter, untucking Draco's shirt to explore the sharply inclined lower slope of his belly. “Some of my spunk must have remained inside you, and the after effects of the spell we used are making it more voluminous. It'll take care of itself, eventually.”
“Of course,” said Harry, smacking his forehead. “He must be in the room of requirement! I'll take the Cloak, go see what he's up to.”
, Potter,” he explains, patting Potter’s overpacked stomach. “A bellyful of it, thanks to your idiotic spell. And now you’re going to have to push it all out, aren’t you happy?”
As if on cue, Potter opens his eyes.
Potter lets out a yell of pain and falls to his knees, curling in agony around his distended belly. Draco props himself against the nearest sink, eyes tightly shut, and breathes deeply through gritted teeth, willing himself not to give in to the raising wave of panic that’s threatening to overcome him. Surely there
“Nothing,” he says, and then, his tone brisker. “Shall we go to the infirmary?”
eat a big breakfast,” agreed Harry, half-heartedly – the idea of his belly swelling as much as Malfoy's had was preposterous, or so his brain was quick to tell him.
Potter has rolled to his back, the naked swell of his preposterous stomach sticking out from his bony frame. His shirt’s buttons, it turns out, were no match for his sudden expansion.
The next morning Harry, who had woken up at half past six feeling like he was about to starve, scarfed down a breakfast of five waffles and three sausages before heading over to the Room of Requirements to check on Malfoy.
“Lean on me,” he said, wincing as a sudden pains shot through his bloated stomach. Malfoy waddled uncomfortably across the room, his legs bowed to accomodate the unfamiliar object protruding from his asshole. Harry helped him sit on the floor.
“I bet,” says Potter, with a trace of grin. “You look like you’ve swallowed a pumpkin.”
“But now you're feeding it! You'll only make it grow bigger!”
“Maybe later, Potter,” he says, arching his back to push his giant stomach out even further. “Provided you behave.”
Malfoy's pale eyes were huge in his pale face.
“Wait, do you mean that the snake got inside you because you fucked Zabini in front of this fireplace?”
“It's our best chance,” said Harry, crouching between Malfoy's legs, meticulously coating a chicken egg in oil. “I've seen the size of that thing, if it comes out before you're ready it's going to tear you apart.”
“I doubt I'll even be able to get near enough your hole to put it in,” grumbled Malfoy. “Not with this belly in the way.”
“What a shocking development,” commented Malfoy, faking a yawn. The creature inside his own distended stomach was more active than ever, its movements distorting the shape of the great pale orb. Harry glared at him, his palm pressed once more against his packed, cramping stomach.
“Nnnnghh,” moaned Malfoy, in ecstasy, and with a final thrust he came inside Harry's mouth. Harry swallowed greedily.
Potter audibly swallows.
“Did you tell him to stop?”
he thought, stifling a burp. Madam Pince shot him a reproachful glare. Harry tried returning his attention to the book he was skimming – under his jumper, though, his stomach felt packed and uncomfortably warm, and soon he found that he just wanted to go lie down somewhere until all the food inside him had been processed fully.
They decided that having Malfoy lie on his back was their best bet, as far as not upsetting the snake went. Harry conjured a blanket and helped Malfoy to his feet.
you're doing here.”
His belly feels hard, just as it did when his guts were filled to the brim with Potter's spunk, but the shape is a bit different – wider, somewhat, with a slight peak a few inches above his pubic bone. He briefly considers going to the infirmary, but explaining to Madam Pomfrey the likely cause of his present condition – with the risk of the whole story getting back to his parents – is absolutely out of the question.  He tries sucking his stomach in – the bulge doesn't change shape at all.
Absolutely not.”
“You're about to be fuller,” said Harry, his dick painfully hard, and he pushed the egg all the way in.
Malfoy was curled up around his huge belly, tears pooling in his pale eyes.
Draco has to repress a smirk. Potter -- and who would have suspected! The Chosen One, a sexual deviant -- appears to be struggling to keep his composure when confronted with the reality of Draco’s suddenly enormous belly. Not that Draco minds -- he’d sooner die than admit it, of course, but he’s had his fair share of begrudged sexual fantasies about Potter over the years. He just never imagined that the key to actually seducing his bloody nemesis would be a sudden transformation into some sort of blimp.
ways to go about it.”
Draco arches his eyebrow.
“You cast the spell yourself,” replies Potter, grinning broadly in the mirror. He's still shirtless, still slightly flushed from their earlier shag, still sexy as fuck. Draco is fully hard once again.
“What?” said Ron, irritably, without looking up from the Sopophorus Beans he was trying to mince,
“What?”
This time, the voice had been triumphant. Malfoy yelped, his hand shooting to the top of his belly. His eyes were wide with... shock? Anxiety? Anticipation? Harry, mesmerized by the sight before his eyes, couldn't really tell. As if answering Harry's silent prayers, Malfoy started to undo his shirt buttons.
“Potter, c'mon, don't be a jerk,” said Malfoy, in a conciliatory tone that didn't much suit him. “I promise there's no snake inside of you – it's impossible without the ritual. You're just paranoid, and possibly overfed.”
“Of course I didn't,” says Draco, brusquely, glaring at the puddle of clear liquid at his feet.
“The worst part will be getting out of here without anyone noticing,” says Potter, trying in vain to get what’s left of his shirt to cover his middle. “Lend me your jumper, will you?”
“I want you to make me come,” said Malfoy, his purple, slickened erection stiff against the underside of his gigantic belly. “Please.”
Hope you're keeping tabs of how many snake-inducing loads have already been dropped into poor Harry's stomach.
, remarked a small, disquieting voice inside his brain. He squirmed uncomfortably, his erection trapped between his flat lower abdomen and Malfoy's back. “We just need to wait for the whole thing to be over.”
“Right,” he said, leaning closer to the small hole. “I'm going to talk to it.”
The sight of Potter spilling all over his hand, Draco finds, is enough to make him come too.
“What the fuck was that, Potter?” he asks, mystified. “A
“Rest it over my back,” said Harry, bending a bit more. His stomach felt like there was a stone inside it, but at the moment he was far too turned out to even remotely care about the implications. All he knew was that he wanted to get fucked by Malfoy's big cock, and that he wanted it to happen while Malfoy – his asshole dilated to unbelievable proportions, his gut racked by cramps – was struggling to give birth to an enormous snake.
“I suppose we might wait and see if the situations, erm, resolves itself,” he says, slowly. “Mine is not really hurting much any longer, I just feel… well, very full.”
Harry had never had something as big as Malfoy's cock up his ass. The pain, at first, was almost shocking: it felt as if he was being split in two, and he let out a groan. But then he heard Malfoy moan in pleasure, and he remembered what was happening to the other boy's ass, and imagining how intense the sensation must be for him was almost enough to make him come on the spot, the walls of his rectum contracting over the intrusion as Malfoy began to fuck him in earnest.
“Are you OK, Harry?”
it, actually.”
“Please be very thorough,” said Malfoy, resuming his slow stroking. “Very,
“I don't know, then,” says Draco, glaring at Potter. Potter grins.
“I've no idea, do I? Magic, I figured. It even tried my bloody mouth, but now I can feel–”
“Oh,” said Malfoy, pausing mid-stroke. “Potter, is that your finger I'm feeling inside my ass?”
Potter lets out a small groan.
Potter, Draco realizes, is groaning in his sleep. His stomach, which looks even bigger than it was the previous evening, is covered in a layer of perspiration. Supporting his enormous mound with one hand, Draco squats by Potter’s side and watches in fascination as Potter’s belly violently contracts. He has no idea how Potter could sleep through something like that.
“Maybe lay off the Butterbeer, Malfoy,” says Urquhart, eyeing Draco's midsection reproachfully. “The way you've been flying today, we'd be better off with my Granny playing Seeker.”
“I insist: it suits you,” says Potter, his warm hands on both sides of Draco's bulging stomach.
“You could just… undo your shirt,” suggests Potter, in a strange voice. His gaze is still on Draco’s stomach. He clears his throat. “I’m sure you’d feel a lot better.”
“Fuck off,” says Draco, glaring at him. “Not like you’re exactly svelte at the moment, either.”
“Here,” he says, handing Potter the jumper. “Hurry up, I can’t wait to change into something that fits.”
This was the loudest the voice had been yet, and Harry was both relieved and baffled to see that somebody else appeared to finally have noticed something was happening: Blaise Zabini, who was wrinkling his nose at a very pink Malfoy.
“Quite,” said Harry, with a wink, and he pressed the smaller tip of the egg against Malfoy's tiny hole. Malfoy sighed again and wrapped his slender fingers around his erection.
who cast a spell without knowing what was going to happen.”
“Same way I'm going to fly with these if they don't shrink back up before the match,” he says, carefully adjusting his currently enormous balls. “Besides, I'm pretty sure you wanted this as much as I did.”
“How exactly am I supposed to fly with this thing?” complains Draco, cupping his swollen stomach while Potter looks for his trousers. “It's bloody
go around casting spells you’ve never tried,” says Draco, mirroring Potter’s gesture. His stomach is starting to feel a little sore, most likely as a consequence of Potter’s idiotic spell. “Very clever of you!”
“I’m positive it did mention jelly, though,” insists Potter, resting his hand on the peak of his belly. He’s panting slightly, Draco realizes, probably from the strain the fullness of his stomach is putting on his lungs. “I wonder if…”
“Yes,” grunted Malfoy, so lost in his wank that he didn't pay attention to the egg that was slowly slipping past his ring of muscle. “Yes,” he repeated, his free hand rubbing his swollen stomach. “Yes, it's brilliant. I feel so
“You know what?” he revealed, grinning faintly. “I never came as hard as I did while the snake was coming out.”
“Malfoy,” said Harry. “Something's really going to have to either come in or come out very soon.”
“Well, maybe I am,” says Potter, covering Draco’s hand with his own, and he winks.
Hermione wasn’t at breakfast in the morning. When Harry went to her room to check on her Cato was at the door, looking like a very small, very stern nurse. He’d swapped the tuxedo for a tiny pair of scrubs and wore what Harry thought looked like a muggle stethoscope around his neck, only the pieces were pulsating gently, and making a sort of whirring sound.
The rest of July went by pleasantly enough. Grimmauld Place was busy. Neville and Hannah stayed for a week, along with Luna, Ginny, Dean, and Seamus, who basically lived in the house by that point. They went out often to Muggle clubs where no one recognized them. Sometimes they were caught by a photographer who heard they might get a shot of Ginny with Dean, after the Diggle party. Ginny didn’t seem to mind, only saying that maybe photos in the Evening Prophet might finally persuade Mrs. Weasley that things really had ended with Harry. If Ron was disappointed by how everything turned out between Harry and Ginny, he chose not to say anything at all.
Malfoy still had packing to do. He’d meant to do it the night before. Harry was set to meet Ron and Hermione early at the station. They went back upstairs together and stood in the hall for a moment.
Later, when she was napping again, Harry went and found Cato in the kitchen. The elf looked up and said, “Nothing to worry about from me, Mr. Potter,” and went back to work without another word. Harry supposed that was reassurance enough. It was more than he deserved, really, getting caught necking his school rival in the foyer of someone else's home.
Harry swallowed. His mouth was very dry. “Do you deny it?”
“I don’t know how many times I have to tell you, Potter, I’m not up to anything. It’s over. You’ve won. Go home.”
Ginny made everyone drinks while they got ready, playing music, and critiquing their outfits. Hannah came over, with Neville, Lavender, and Parvati, because Harry’s Floo was still connected to the Diggle Estate, and because Ginny hosted an excellent pre-game. This was the sort of thing Grimmauld Place was good for, what their school years could have been like if they hadn’t been fighting a war.
Harry and Draco moved together, one of them throwing up a shield around Teddy, the other sidestepping a pile of something rotten to send a stunning spell towards Greyback. Back at the Manor, Harry thought he’d forgotten it all, but with Draco covering him to the left and Teddy in tears just ahead, he knew what to do. Greyback’s own
Draco just shook his head at her. “Who is even left? They haven’t had the time to rebuild. Edward is my cousin.” He drew a breath, looking away. His voice had cracked. Harry waited.  Draco drew his wand, murmuring to himself, looking sick. The air was very still and quiet. Harry’s heartbeat thundered in his ears. Draco swayed, his eyes cold and unseeing.
Back at Grimmauld Place, things were basically as Harry had left them. Ginny and Luna were in the kitchen, which meant that Dean was likely about somewhere as well, and if Dean was there, then Seamus was either there or coming over soon.
Harry nodded and managed a smile. Dedalus turned and guided Hermione towards the Manor doors. Harry felt a pang. It seemed wrong to send Hermione in there without him, but if anything, she was far more ready than him to face the Manor again. He followed a gravel path around the main house, winding around into a lush kitchen garden, beds filled with vegetables, leafy and green and bursting from the earth. There were neat labels at each plant, in a tidy scrawl he knew was Malfoy’s, recalling the jeering little notes he would send in school.
“And you’ll make it good, won’t you?” Harry caught Malfoy’s earlobe in his mouth and bit down gently.
Harry looked down, remembered that he was in his underwear, and felt that he might melt into the floor. “I just like to be comfortable.”
“No, just, you felt pretty confident, then?” Harry wsat up too, so that he was of a height with Malfoy, and shuffled closer on his knees, tucking his face into the curve of Malfoy’s neck, unable to look at him while he talked about this. “You knew I’d want it this badly?”
“Did you know this, Hermione? That Neville was working with Malfoy on plant stuff?” Harry asked. The exasperation on Hermione’s face indicated that she knew and maybe Harry also knew as well, or would have known, if he had listened a little better when Neville came over.
to Draco. They had never even really been together. And Draco hadn’t given any indication that he even wanted Harry anymore.
Draco pointed his wand at himself and Harry, whispered a
Draco gave an annoyed little grunt. “Since when are you calling me Draco?”
Harry coughed up the dregs of his brandy. “George Weasley?” he asked weakly, as Cato whacked him on the back.
Harry wasn’t used to hearing people talk about Malfoy Manor in such casual terms. He reached out instinctively for Hermione, who certainly hadn’t been back since she was
“Is that what you think, I–” Harry found he couldn’t finish the question.
“Oh, I suppose you could come as well, Ron. I only thought because Harry enjoyed the grounds at the Diggle Estate, he might want to see how Draco has been restoring the park at the Manor.” Hermione said this in a way that struck Harry as purposefully obtuse.
henceforth? You won’t spoil this for Astoria?” She said the word dalliance like Harry was the dirtiest person she’d ever seen.
Harry followed Neville around the garden beds, and then over to a greenhouse he hadn’t noticed the day before. Some of the windows were smashed in, but overall, it didn’t look to be in terrible shape. “The one at Hogwarts is still in a right state,” Neville told Harry, “one of the giants put his foot through it. Repairing magical glass is a bit of a nightmare.” He reached back and clapped a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Lucky for us, Malfoy here has worked to make himself a bit of an expert.”
“Jealous?” Malfoy smirked, sitting up as well. Harry snapped his mouth shut. “Anyway, this whole thing has been against my nature and certainly against my better judgement, given your appalling taste in well, everything, but yes, I suppose I do want to, you know, eat breakfast together. And so on and so forth.”
Before Draco was moved, Potter came to see him in the holding cell. Draco attempted bravado and a sneering tone.
“Oh, come on, you literally carried me to bed.” Harry blushed as well. They hadn’t acknowledged any of it, the fucking or the fighting.
“Harry, you made it out of your closet! I like the look!” Ron winked at him. He had been ready for ages, squabbling with Ginny over the record player, and mixing horrific cocktails from the nicer, simpler drinks Ginny was making. He wore a Muggle tuxedo that he’d had professionally tailored with money from their Order of Merlin prizes. “The Yule Ball was scarring mate; I’m never wearing wizarding formal wear again if I can help it. But this…” Ron did a bit of a twirl. “I can get behind.”
“I’ve been helping young Draco, you know. Managing the Manor is a lot of work and Lucius was terrible at it in the best of times, and I know you saw some of the damage it sustained, in the war. With Lucius gone, I’ve been helping Draco with restoration, land management, that sort of thing.”
“Well, if those are your requirements, I guess we were all trolls then,” Pansy said in a good-natured way, turning to the raised bed where Neville was sweating through his t-shirt. They watched as Neville painstakingly extracted a flowering raspberry bush, leaving the roots intact, handing it off to Draco who repotted it carefully and created a new tag.
Harry felt his face go hot, but he didn’t bother with trying to deny it.
Faced with another day of waiting for Hermione to recover, Harry poked around the old house until he found a broom cupboard with a couple of Cleansweeps. No one bothered him about it. Ernie seemed to have fucked off back to London, and Hermione was still firmly ensconced in her room, with Cato on watch. Harry cast the strongest disillusionment he could and spent the morning flying, avoiding groups of hikers and tourists.
Draco sat across from Harry in the small kitchen of his dingy flat. A bottle of whiskey and two glasses was on the table between them. “I deserve it. Being punished. Shunned.”
Harry froze, his whole body seized with fear and adrenaline. A year ago, he would have known what to do, how to fix it, where to go, but he had changed. He had become soft and now the worst might happen while he was paralyzed on the lawn at Malfoy Manor of all places.
mean?”
“I swear you were raised in a barn. Never have any sense of proper attire. What were you even wearing at dinner? Were those zip off trousers?” Malfoy sneered in the general direction of Harry’s knees.
Malfoy startled, glancing up and then back at the massive hole in the wall. “Well, it’s not as if she really has any expertise in this.”
Harry scowled. “You’re not meant to be out of bed at this hour.”
Beyond the vegetables there was a rose garden. Now August, it was far past its prime and the pathway littered with rotting petals. Entire plants were ripped out of place, no labels or neat writing to be found. Harry felt a chill among the wilting foliage, even though the day was sunny and warm. He jogged forward to the back lawn, hurrying to push away the clammy, cold feeling. He stumbled across the green, away from the decaying scent of the rose bushes, taking in great gulps of the summer air.
while Hermione recovered. He hadn’t really been doing much of anything in the past year. Hogwarts was closed for extensive repair work, so Harry had mostly been living at Grimmauld Place with Ron and Hermione and sometimes Ginny. The house was large, and Harry liked it to be full of people, inviting members of the DA to stay for weeks or months at a time, making it feel crowded and alive.
“I can find him.” He had taken the letter and read it, thrusting it at Pansy and Neville to read as well.
“Right, good.” Malfoy nodded, then fell silent.
Feeling as though he was moving very slowly, Harry cupped Malfoy’s cheek with his palm, stroking down his nose with his thumb, over the cupid’s bow of his mouth, and pressed into Malfoy’s bottom lip. Malfoy’s eyes were very dark, and he made a low, hungry sound as Harry’s thumb slipped into his mouth. His tongue laved over the pad of Harry’s thumb, once, twice, and then Harry withdrew, pressing back into Malfoy’s lip again, slick, shiny, and red.
In the nursery, Draco cradled Teddy and spoke softly to Andromeda, explaining how they had overtaken Greyback, and entreating her to place more protection on her home. Harry sat in the glider and waited his turn. He dozed off at some point, although he couldn’t remember when, only realizing it when he woke to Andromeda lifting a sleeping Teddy off his chest, to move him to the crib.
A ghost of a smile crossed Draco’s face. “Totally useless, Potter, although I don’t know what I expected.”
“And has something… come up?”
Harry smiled and couldn’t help pointing out, “We haven’t graduated from anything yet at all, Hermione.”
! Just look.” Hermione stopped to gesture at the countryside. Harry looked out onto the rolling landscape. It was late in the day and the setting sun cast everything in a soft, low light. It
“I don’t think we need to worry about that, he’s too busy plotting to get into Draco Malfoy’s pants,” Ginny said, taking Dean’s hand.
When Ron spoke again, it was in that same careful, gentle tone, “And you know that whatever makes you happy, we’ll just be happy for you, mate. You don’t need to worry about that.”
Luna shrugged and said, “I don’t know that I would say we’re in touch. He’s my sixth cousin though, so we’re bound by genealogical magic.”
As soon as silence settled over the room, he felt strangely at a loss. Astoria had been right: the problem
There was a loud pop, and when Draco took his next step, he tumbled over an elf that looked on the verge of tears. Either from sadness or joy, he didn't know.
“What are you scribbling about?” Harry whispered. Draco jumped, having been so intent on writing everything down, that he hadn’t noticed anyone sitting down beside him. “Can I read it?”
"Give it back."
For a moment, he wonders if the boy is having a stroke. Finally Potter says, “I can talk to snakes.”
“I’ll see you at school?” he says, jumping off the stool.
Professor Lupin pursed his lips, then nodded to himself. "Alright. When I pull out the drawers, the boggart will manifest itself into a basilisk. I need you to think about one of those skinny balloons, that can be tied into animals. Got it? Yes? Let's go."
Draco's first lesson with Moody was not one he was keen to repeat.
He heard no familiar call of "Firs'-years over 'ere... firs'-years" from Hagrid as stepped onto the platform. Instead, there was a different voice, a distinctly female one, shouting, "First-years over here, please! All first years with me!"
"Right on," Moody was saying. He scribbled the answer onto an old blackboard, and said, "You don't need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can perform the Cruciatus Curse."
"Oh, yes. Severus allowed me to watch him brew some advanced potions that he's been working on for Pomfrey, and Mother has even allowed me to take Muggle Studies this year— as long as Father doesn't find out."
An eerie silence rattles through the store. Draco steps closer to the two grownups, opening his mouth to request something, but hesitates.
he thought as he walked up to the castle.
The next few weeks were probably the best in Draco’s life. He and Potter would meet at the library in the evenings to research everything they could find about Seer’s, but would often get bored and just talk for up to an hour. Divination became enjoyable as well, as Potter developed the tendency to ask Draco if he knew what the weather would be like for any upcoming Quidditch matches, or if he could see Granger and Weasley making up in the lines of their palms. He couldn’t, obviously, and Potter knew that— it was all just good fun. Still, though, the more time they spent together, the more Draco’s pulse would flutter and cheeks blush around him.
Another round of cheers put a stop to their conversation. All of them turned to see the judges putting up the points for each contestant. Fleur had gotten twenty-five in total, and Krum forty. Diggory’s came next, with an impressive forty-seven. Draco held his breath, crossed his fingers and— “Forty-five points! You’re still tied for first!”
The last thing Snape cared about was Harry's safety, but Draco wasn't about to argue against it.
Boot chuckles. “Of course it was. I didn’t think you were the type to purposely fall off beds.”
They turn to them at the same time. Draco feels like he’s on display as Weasley’s eyes widen at the sight of him, while the girl-- Hermione, he’s sure her name is-- lights up with recognition. Hagrid grins, still as friendly in the face as the day Draco first saw him. “‘ello. Malfoy, is it? Come to see the decorations, eh?”
Draco shoved his diary into his school bag, along with his quill and ink. He could see Terry eating a few seats away, but they'd yet to talk this term. The whole thing confused Draco— he'd been getting iced by a lot of the Ravenclaws lately, and he has a feeling it's got something to do with the gossip that Zabini was talking about. Still, he has too much pride to actually ask the blasted git about it.
The rest of their journey to Hogwarts went uneventfully. Granger and Weasley showed up a little over an hour in, muttering about Blaise Zabini and Pansy being made Slytherin prefects. By the time the train was pulling into Hogsmeade Station, the skies outside the window had been painted in stars just visible through the rain, and everybody was thankful to have arrived. Draco helped Luna up and they dragged their suitcases from the compartment, shuffling off in the direction of the doors.
They wandered past the peacocks and metal gates with ease, and were soon standing by the main road in silence. Severus stuck out his wand, and the next time Draco blinked, a purple three-decker bus was parked in front of them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hi, ma’am.”
They chat for a few more minutes before Pomfrey shoos the three away. She gives him another sleeping draught (“In case you need it”) and then Draco is leaving as well. He has a quick lunch just in time for the food to be cleared away, and then decides to visit Severus’ chambers. The man will probably be waiting for a proper thank you for last night.
When the night did come around, Draco put on his black dress-robes and escorted Luna to the Great Hall. She'd tied her hair into two little balls on her head, which were apparently called space-buns, and was wearing a shiny, purple dress that Draco thought was unnaturally reflective. Luna took this as a compliment and put a careful hand on his arm. They laughed their whole way there, and suddenly he was actually looking forward to the following hours.
"I'll be dropping in quite often, and expect regular updates on any dreams you have," Severus continued. They reached the Manor's front door and swept through it. "By the way, who have you been sending owls to?"
A bubble of silence envelopes them. Draco watches the three communicate with nothing but twitches of their mouths and gestures. Just as the feeling of exclusion starts inside Draco, Harry faces him. “Do you remember what Dumbledore said about the third-floor corridor being out of bounds during the Welcome Feast?”
"I was trying to sneak out." Potter folded it up and stuffed it into his pocket. In his other hand, he held the map. "But if you're back early, we can just mess around for the rest of the day."
As they head to the castle, he realises Weasley and Potter were still absent. Draco seriously doubts the pair are smart enough to send a letter to the school explaining they’d missed the train (if that indeed was what happened. He hopes they hadn’t been injured or something else disastrous). It’s more likely they’d found a broomstick to Hogwarts instead, though. That mental image makes him snort.
"I've got a hall pass, specially, from Professor Snape."
None of the Gryffindor's knew how to answer.
The judges all looked at him. Draco stood his ground. His intuition, buried deep under his nerves and regret, let out a ripple of approval. “Sir, I needed to talk to you.”
Unfortunately, Borgin notices. He smirks and takes on a look of triumph. Leaning forward eagerly, he gets into Draco’s space. “Young Malfoy, what is it you want to purchase?”
It was true. After that first Astronomy lesson, Potter never made any more attempts at speaking with him. Draco just assumed his Gryffindor friends had told him all about the evil Malfoy family, and Potter rightfully gave up. This is a nice surprise, though. It even cheers him up a bit.
“Oh,” Draco said, surprised. He’d not seen anything about Potter’s resignation in the Daily Prophet. Did they not know, or had he simply missed that article? “My apologies, then.”
She flinches, as if she thought he planned to fight too.
The spider leapt from Moody's hand, and onto his desk. It moved in a dozen circles, surely making it dizzy, before doing a backflip. The class burst into laughter, though Draco couldn't even muster a weak smile. His father had claimed to be under that curse during the War, and for Moody to practically tell all his peers ... It was mean and unfair. Lucius had donated a lot of money to the Ministry to try and keep his trial hushed up, and it had almost worked until Rita Skeeter wrote an article about it. There was now a fair share of wizards who didn't believe the Imperius story— Draco didn't even, and he was the man's son.
“‘Kay,” Draco says. He attempts to stand but immediately falls back down. A numb pain shot through his leg. “Not to be a downer, but I think Riddle broke a bone.”
She hums and removes a magazine from her trunk. “That’s good because I’m not either.” The girl flips her article around to read upside-down. “I’m Luna.”
He felt, inexplicably, like crying. It explained a lot, though— why his house has been ignoring him, why students he's never even met before seem afraid of him. They're all under the assumption that Draco's going to become a fucking Death Eater.
“Oh tosh!” said Dedalus, “Austen was one of us, an exceptionally clever witch.”
. They’d spent the morning in Bakewell and at Chatsworth house. Then, Hermione had insisted they walk the four miles to Peak District National Park. She really wanted to get the full Lizzie Bennet experience, and all she had planned for them once they got there was more walking.
“Last year, in winter, when Greyback had killed someone very important, although to be honest, I couldn’t tell you who, I’ve certainly blocked it all out by now--”
They flooed to a wizarding pub in Bradford-on-Avon, and then walked to the Manor entrance. The eagle owl that had delivered the ledgers had also dropped off coordinates, taking them down a hedge-lined lane, away from town. Hermione insisted on walking, something about vigorous activity and fresh air. As the gates came within view, Hermione took a deep breath, reaching out and squeezing Harry’s hand.
“It’s like I’m drowning,” Draco said, his mouth still on Harry’s, unable to pull away. Harry picked Draco up in his arms, adrenaline making him seem weightless. “Where are you taking me?”
“Well, maybe not forever.” Harry didn’t take his eyes off Teddy’s little chest as it rose and fell in time with his breathing.
“Wait a minute. Wait a minute,” Harry said, but even as he was saying it, he was changing his mind, leaning forward to kiss Draco again and again.
Neville was at the Manor in the morning, as promised, wearing a great straw hat and dungarees, with wellies already caked in mud. Pansy sat on a chaise lounge that she’d dragged over to the kitchen garden from the patio. She wore an enormous sun hat of her own that was probably quite chic, overseeing the proceedings. Draco was crouched down next to Neville, scribbling notes as Neville took measurements and performed what must have been diagnostic spells. Pansy waved Harry over as he approached. Hermione was already inside, eager to get back to her research.
“I thought you wanted me to
“Is that-” Harry said, forgetting he was under the cloak, “have you got Hermione’s cat?”
“Oh yes, I’m sure you can, my apologies,” Draco murmured, looking at Harry from under his lashes, eyes dark.
“You really must come back next week for Bastille Day! Bring whomever you’d like, there will be plenty of champagne. If you ask me, we haven’t celebrated enough this past year,” Dedalus said as they stood next to the hearth. Harry and Hermione promised they’d attend.
“When have I ever been able to leave you alone?” Harry asked, rolling his eyes.
He got out of the bed and walked to his robes, rummaged around, and produced a small bottle. Harry raised his eyebrows. “You brought lube to the Diggle Bastille Day party?”
Harry lay back down, resting his hands behind his head. “Oh, and where would I find you then? Normally?”
“Maybe I should. I was always more eloquent than you in school.” Malfoy lifted his chin a little, his nose in the air. Harry found that he wanted to reach out and touch Malfoy’s pointy arrogant nose, and wondered if he’d had more to drink than he realized. That arrogance had driven him mad at Hogwarts, and he certainly felt crazy in this moment. He was unable to look away from the lines of Malfoy’s face, somehow familiar and new, under the warm twinkling lights. Malfoy’s lashes were making pretty half-moon shadows across his cheek, contrasting with the sharp patrician angles of his nose and mouth.
“I’m not?”
They still spent a good deal of time together, going out with the Gryffindors, dancing and drinking and avoiding reporters from the gossip columns. At Grimmauld Place, surrounded by his friends and without the threat of violence for the first time in his life, Harry would see her laughing or flying or just lying on the couch, and he knew that he loved her, but it just wasn’t how he had thought.
“Oooh yes, I’ve heard about those parties. Katie and Angelina went on New Year’s and said there was a champagne fountain.” Ginny grinned. “Apparently, Pansy Parkinson went for a swim.”
Harry and Hermione spent the night at the wizarding pub in town, where Hermione secured lodgings under a false name. “I just think we could do without the headlines, don’t you?” she asked, after signing her name in the ledger as Mafalda Hopkirk. Harry hadn’t considered it, his mind too full of Draco swimming and framing walls to worry about tabloid press. He went to sleep in the small room still preoccupied, dreaming of shimmering lakes and deltoids, glistening with sweat or lake water or both, just out of reach.
“Oh yes, much better, just a little tired. I think I’ll stay tonight and then we can head home tomorrow, if that’s alright with you.”
“I think you’d better come.”
He turned and leaned against the door, feeling drained. Walburga Black eyed him thoughtfully from her portrait.
“Well, stop it,” Draco said, kicking at the table leg, petulant like a child. “Why won’t you leave me alone?”
?” Harry said, surely missing something.
Malfoy’s eyes widened and he choked a little, rolling off Harry. “Have you ever, with a man before?”
Harry was silent for a moment. The whole situation felt absurd and archaic, some pureblood nonsense. He certainly wasn’t
“You think so?”
Hermione nodded. “Yes, it’s quite fascinating. I think we’ll use the historical record you sent over to try to gain an understanding of the long-term effects of dark magic on a home like this.”
“Since when is Draco Malfoy inviting you to his house?” Harry said.
“What brings you to Derbyshire?” Dedalus asked, still smiling widely.
“Ancient earth magic, and very important,” Luna said seriously. “Also, it helps purebloods sort out the incest ick factor when they, you know, want to
“Cheers, tell me if there’s any updates on Hermione, will you?”
“Well, I certainly take the
“Is it even worth pointing out that you aren’t either?” Malfoy said, petting Crookshanks gently. The motion calmed something in Harry. He sat down next to Malfoy, “well, whatever you’re doing, I’ve caught you.” Harry yawned and let his head rest against the wall.
“Are we? Seeing each other?” Harry felt quite off-balance, dizziness from the hangover spilling over into something else.
“You can come and see him again in the morning,” Andromeda promised, shepherding Harry to the floo. “You need to sleep, and so do I.”
When Malfoy spoke again, his voice was ragged. “Did you expect that I could just forget everything I’d ever been taught, leave behind my family, my birthright? I was a child! Was I supposed to rejoice in the realization that the shining future my father described was really just endless terror and fear?” He took a breath and looked Harry in the eye, his face marked by a sort of desperation. “Everything you said at my trial, about how I wasn’t a killer, and how I’d saved your life, that meant nothing to you?”
Flying along the route of the hike he had taken with Hermione, Harry thought that if Austen really was a witch, maybe there was a need for Pride and Prejudice Flying Tours. It was a more enjoyable way to take in the hills than all that walking. He could lead them, seeing how he wasn’t really doing anything else. He’d just have to read the book first. When he returned to the house, windswept and tired, there was Malfoy in the hall, sneering at his hair and dragging him in by the collar.
“I don’t know what you want.” Malfoy took a step forward. “But, that’s why I’m asking.”
“Come on Harry, you knew Neville was working with Sprout to get the gardens and greenhouses back in order.” Hermione sat down at the table, gesturing for Harry to sit as well.
you are to Draco Malfoy, he is to be married to my youngest, Astoria. There is a rumor, a pernicious lie, I’m sure, that Draco has decided to give up the match to pursue your affections instead.”
Harry’s mouth went dry, and his heart thudded in his chest. He licked his lips unconsciously, and thought he saw Draco’s cheeks flush, although it was difficult to tell. “I’ll figure it out, I’m sure.”
“What? No, that’s not what I meant, he just said something about reporters.” Harry took another drink. “Wait, what did
walking tour,” Hermione responded, “Muggle literature, you know.” She looked at Malfoy, who was looking at the ground.
“He didn’t apologize to me,” Harry said petulantly. Malfoy hadn’t, he had just fucked Harry tenderly and then offered him breakfast. And Harry had yelled at him and called him a Death Eater.
“You didn’t think I’d forgotten, did you?” Harry asked, trying for levity. He heard his voice tremble and wanted badly to distract from it. “Er, here,” he said, and he wrapped a blanket around Draco’s thin frame.
“Right.” Harry managed, surging forward. The kiss was messy and cruel, and Harry heard himself whine as Malfoy turned his head and bit down, on his jaw, his neck. He was pressed up against the piano, Malfoy working his height and his hips, and everything was over embarrassingly quickly.
As they crested another hill, Harry began to regret his decision to accompany Hermione on her walking tour of
“We haven’t eaten yet, but I’m sure it will be very nice,” Hermione said warmly. “Dedalus had Cato prepare us something. He’s just inside.”
A moment before Harry was about to give up and try something on his own, Draco reached out and gripped his forearm, pulling him into the darkness. They emerged on a soggy hillside, just feet from the mouth of a cave, the sound of a baby crying coming from within.
They sat in awkward silence. Harry wasn’t interested in making small talk with Malfoy. They certainly had never engaged in any before the war. What would he even ask?
“No, I think it will probably help, in some weird way. And I do really want to see Dedalus about his research into the cores of magical homes. I’ve been so aimless this past year, it feels like time to figure out a graduate scheme.”
?” Harry asked, incredulous.
“Here at Grimmauld Place. Just, you know, making it into more of a home.” It was a criticism, Harry knew, and a fair one, delivered very kindly. Behind Hermione, Ron was nodding along in a way that made Harry certain they had had this conversation before, without him there. Any time he thought about his home, it was Hogwarts, accompanied by a sharp ache of knowing the damage it had sustained the year before. Harry looked out the window, into the wilds of the garden, untended for years, but teeming with possibility. It was hard to imagine ever being truly at home in the house Sirius hated, but he wanted to try, especially if it meant Hermione and Ron might be more willing to stay.
Dedalus appeared then, looking apologetic. “I think she must have contracted it in the library. We all had it as children and are immune. We’ll take excellent care of her though, don’t worry Harry! It’s only a mild case, really.”
In the morning, Dedalus saw them off to Grimmauld Place, explaining that he had set up a temporary Floo connection with Ron – “Excellent young man! Saw him last night about the fireworks”– having been let into the
“Hermione! Potter.” Malfoy sounded out of breath. “Are you enjoying lunch?”
Draco demurred, waving Neville off, gazing up at the greenhouse instead. “I wasn’t really allowed to come down here as a child. Some days my grandmother would sneak me in though. She was always a little less immune to a tantrum.”
“I don’t think you knew, darling,” Pansy Parkinson said, grinning wickedly. “I heard Neville Longbottom might be back in the gardens.”
That made sense. Most Death Eater assets were frozen after the war, then subjected to heavy fines, used to rebuild the Ministry and Hogwarts, and as reparations payments moving forward. Deeply uninterested in commiserating with Malfoy over his newfound poverty, Harry turned his attention to a dusty desk in the opposite corner of the room. It was covered in diagrams and schematics, building plans with incantations scrawled in the margins, calculations of materials and costs in Malfoy’s handwriting. Poking out from underneath the parchment was something that looked decidedly Muggle, the edge made of a synthetic white material, standing out against the yellowing scrolls. It was the photo Ginny had taken of Harry, the night of the Bastille Day party, slouching in Sirius’ jacket by the record player at Grimmauld.
“Some people wash before dinner,” Malfoy muttered, with a sidelong glance at Harry that went straight through him.
“A free man without a head!” Draco said loudly, standing up and over Harry, the table wedged between them.
Draco took a breath and looked cautiously at Harry. “My feelings are unchanged from what they were in July. If you feel now the way you did then, please just say so and I’ll leave you alone forever. I really will. But I, I want to try–”
Harry let out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding. He made his way back up to the great lawn and saw Hermione waving down to him as he came up the hill. She led him around the decrepit rose garden to a patio where a table was laid for lunch. As they walked, Hermione was talking rapidly, describing the centuries-old magic at the core of the Manor, mysterious and alive, just pulsating like a heart, out in the open. Harry absorbed none of it.
Malfoy. Not everyone has a poncey horse they can just ride around on, looking down on people.” Harry’s embarrassment slid away as quickly as it had come.
“You really must give a toast! Before the fireworks display, won’t you?” Dedalus seemed not to hear him at all.
“Mmm, this is my home.”
“Right, yes, the Manor kitchens still aren’t functioning. Not for guests anyways.” Malfoy turned away for a moment, touching the back of his neck. “And uh, were you and Dedalus able to find what you were hoping for?”
“Draco Malfoy?” Dean asked, wrinkling his nose, like Ginny had done earlier.
“Pansy! Tell her she should come!” Ernie squeezed Malfoy’s shoulder. “We had a good time last time she was here.” He waggled his eyebrows significantly and leaned against the desk, letting his hand drop to Malfoy’s thigh.
“I should hope not.” Dean spoke from the doorway. “Hello. Harry, Hermione, welcome back. Also, Ginny and I are exclusive now, just for the record.”
“Infamous
“Harry? Are you home?” Ginny shouted as she came through the door, early in the evening, on a weeknight.
Harry shrugged. “Maybe.”
As soon as Dedalus was gone, Malfoy reached over and gripped Harry’s arm a bit too hard. Harry winced and fumbled for his wand, but then they were squeezing through blackness, into what must have been Malfoy’s guest suite, landing with a loud crack on the bed.  Malfoy set in on Harry’s trousers immediately, growing frustrated with the buttons, then banishing them and his own altogether. He knocked Harry’s legs apart and slid in between them, pushing Harry onto his back, balancing above him. Harry canted his hips up towards Malfoy, grinding against him, feeling desperate already, saying, “Don’t you want me to go and have a wash?”
“I think it looks great, Ronald,” Luna said, smiling from the doorway. She did a little model walk into the room.
“Has someone got an actual camera?” Ron asked, turning to yell in the general direction of the stairs. “HERMIONE? Have we got a camera?”
“Well, you tend to be right about when things are good or bad, or uh…” Malfoy paused, looking down, his lips pursed.
“Hmm yeah, no one would say that you didn’t pay enough attention to Malfoy.”
Malfoy’s mouth pressed into a grim line. “Right,” he said tightly, “good night, Potter.” He hurried down the hall, without waiting for a reply.
that’s not true. And anyways, you were always jealous, you–”
“I don’t think it really matters who he likes, the match was made when they were kids,” Luna said with a shrug. “ I think I’m going to go and introduce myself.” She waved at Astoria, who smiled back, slow and satisfied. Harry thought she looked a little like a beautiful shark, predatory and beguiling as Luna made her way over.
“Oh, not to worry Harry! Kind of you to remember at all!” Dedalus said graciously. “My home in Kent was an unfortunate casualty of the fighting in those early days before the Ministry fell. This estate is the Diggle family seat, going back generations. I hadn’t lived here full time in years, but after everything, a long sojourn to the country seemed just as well. Maybe I’ll rebuild the house one day, but for now, I’m happy to be here.”
“Er, I’ve kept busy,” Harry said, feeling the back of his neck warm.
“As I am sure you know, given how
Malfoy came up and peered over Harry’s shoulder at the photograph. “I think it fell out of your pocket. It was there when I went back to Diggle’s guest room to uh…” He stopped, spreading his hands. “When I went back, it was there and now it’s here.”
“And where are you staying?” Malfoy asked.
Draco was just standing quietly, waiting.
there. But Hermione was nodding along and saying something about preservation of the site of centuries of magical history, seeming unaffected.
It was strange, then to see Draco Malfoy here at the Diggle estate, his life seemingly uninterrupted, the war a small hiccough in his birthright as Lord of the Manor. ‘
“Oh, something very evil,” Draco sounded exhausted. Crookshanks leapt onto his lap and snuggled in.
“You like these, don’t you,” Malfoy said in a low tone, “I saw you looking, before.”
Harry spent the next few days hanging around Grimmauld, trying to feel settled and at home. The house was still a bit of a disaster; Mrs. Black screeching in the front entryway, strange clanging in the attic, and peeling paint and plaster. On top of the disrepair, with the endless coming and going of 17- and 18-year-olds, it was never going to be very neat.
“I dunno,” Harry said honestly. “I never thought that far ahead.”
“That depends on who’s asking,” Harry replied, realizing with a sinking feeling that he
Harry suppressed a shiver and turned to face him. “They say that anyways. Why not give them the picture to go with?” It was true. The Prophet often reported that Harry and Hermione had run off, recycling old photos of Ginny and Ron crying from Fred’s funeral. It would be horribly depressing, if it didn’t happen like clockwork any time a slow news day rolled around.
Hours later, when they had finished, slept, woken up, and gone again, Harry slung an arm across Malfoy’s waist as they lay side by side. “You’re not going to see Michael Corner at Hogwarts.”
Harry opened his mouth to defend Ron, but Malfoy was already slipping out of the tent, to where it was darker out on the vast lawn.
years earlier by Shacklebolt.
“What did Malfoy want with you?” Ron asked, when Harry returned, water in hand.
Once Teddy was settled, Andromeda sent him home.
“Maybe I shouldn’t have, though,” Malfoy teased, his breath hot on Harry’s ear.
Harry said goodbye to Ron and got up from the hearth, wandering out of the house and onto the extensive grounds of the estate. He hadn’t really considered what he would
Harry suspected he was being tested on something, but he ignored it and instead recalled the night that Pansy had wanted to give him up to Voldemort. Her cowardice wasn’t exactly a crime, there wasn’t a trial or anything, and he had lost track of her completely in the intervening year. Now, watching her blithely hit on Neville Longbottom in the garden of Malfoy Manor, it all seemed like a lifetime ago.
“Draco?” Harry asked, startled.
When Harry had moved on to his second brandy, Ernie MacMillan reappeared. “Hermione found the library, so we ended the tour there,” he said and walked over to where Malfoy sat with his back to the room. Ernie leaned over Malfoy’s shoulder, trying to read what he was writing.
“No, you were too busy with Ernie MacMillan to have intentions towards me,” Harry cut in, sitting up and letting the sheet pool around his waist.
“I’ll come.”
Harry looked over her shoulder towards the nursery one more time, and then did as he was told. Grimmauld Place was quiet and still when he returned, and he slept soundly through the night, only realizing in the morning that Draco had left without saying goodbye.
“They’ve probably assumed you’ve gone home with one of your adoring fans.” Malfoy curled up, his body a tense comma facing away from Harry.
“I was in Scotland a lot this year, for the rebuilding. I spent time with Dedalus in Derbyshire. And, Ernie has a place in London, but I haven’t, you know, not since we started–”
“Creeping out of Ernie’s room?! The lavatory’s
“Honestly Hermione, I’m surprised you’re getting involved,” Harry said to her as their plans grew more complicated, exhausted, and unable to help himself.
For Harry, it became an obsession. He couldn’t think about anything else, filling the void left by horcruxes and deathly hallows with visions of Draco Malfoy’s white face, dazed and frightened, behind bars.
Harry took the brandy, if only to have something to do with his hands. He had planned on drinking less after dinner but now there was little else to do. Malfoy busied himself with writing a letter, appearing determined to ignore Harry.
“You don’t have to,” Pansy said in a low, angry voice. “You don’t have to open the connection. The Aurors are professionals, they will take care of it.”
know who was asking. It was Catherine Greengrass, Daphne and Astoria’s mother. She had been at the Bastille Day party, keeping close to Narcissa.
“Are you complaining?” Malfoy knelt back down on the bed, next to Harry, his face a little sharp.
“About what?” Harry reached out and gripped Malfoy’s shoulder, his thumb pressing into delicate collarbone.
“Well, have you?”
?” Ginny rounded on him.
“Hm yes, I’d like to see you try.” Harry gave her a bit of a shove over the threshold.
“Do you want to come in, Potter?”
“Well, I don’t think any of our lives really looks like we thought it would,” Ron said, trying to be diplomatic, but secretly he agreed with Ginny, unable to comprehend why Harry had become so fixated.
Harry shrugged, determined to press on. “There’s a first time for everything.”
Malfoy shuddered and gripped Harry’s thighs. “I knew. I always know, with you.”
“Neville? Longbottom?” Harry asked. He heard Hermione sigh. He couldn’t remember a time when she had sighed quite so much as she was doing now.
Malfoy did make it good. He returned to sucking Harry’s cock and then opened Harry up, slow and agonizingly sweet. He warmed the lube in his hands and used so much that Harry felt that he was dripping with it, that he could take anything that Malfoy gave him. When Malfoy finally pushed inside, Harry was surprised at how much he loved it. He twisted and arched into the pressure, pushing his hips up to get
He was still in his socks when he knocked on Malfoy’s door a minute later.
“I’ll see you at Hogwarts then?” For the first time, Malfoy sounded unsure.
“Why don’t you ever use a muffling spell?” Harry tucked his face into Malfoy’s neck, ground his hips against him. “I can hear your whole damn day through this wall.”
“Yeah, I know what breakfast is, thanks. I’m just surprised you want me to stay and have it with you.”
“Couldn’t even take off to welcome me home?” Hermione grumbled lightly, putting her feet up. Secretly, Harry thought Hermione was glad Ron had a job, and even a little jealous sometimes that he had something purposeful to do.
Next to him, Hermione sighed happily. “Don’t you just feel like you’ve traveled through time?”
“It isn’t right, Draco,” Harry said, his own hands clenched into fists, “I’m going to do something about it.”
“Yes, my dear girl!” said Dedalus, and he launched into an enthusiastic history of magical authors who had found great success in Muggle publishing.
“Always so disheveled,
Picking out an outfit was harder than Harry expected. He stood in his closet for ages, feeling tense and excited. Harry had never really cared about his appearance before, and after a year of funerals and solemn ceremonies, he hoped never to look at another set of dress robes again. Eventually he gave up and decided to be aggressively casual, wearing jeans and a t-shirt, with Sirius’ old leather jacket on top.
Sunlight shone through the windows, waking Harry. His head was pounding from the champagne and his limbs ached. He lifted his hips gingerly and found that he ached there as well. Malfoy lay next to him, still undressed. When he saw Harry shift beside him, he said quite stiffly, addressing the ceiling rather than Harry, “Would you stay for breakfast then?”
On the manicured lawn at Malfoy Manor, Harry took deep breaths and focused on a ladybug, crawling up a blade of grass. He pictured Ron, then Hermione, Ginny, Teddy, and Andromeda, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, each of them safe and going about their daily routine, his heart rate slowing with time. After a while, the ladybug flew off, and he followed it, down to a path that wound its way through a marsh, following a stream through natural grassland and wildflowers, a small valley in the verdant rolling hills where the Manor was situated.
“You don’t know anything about it.” Draco said in a monotone, his fixed on the sticky table.
Afterwards, Malfoy lay on top of Harry for a moment. He propped himself up on his elbows and smoothed the hair out of Harry’s eyes, running his thumb down the scar just above them. Falling back onto the mattress, Malfoy laughed a little wild huff and turned away. Harry was exhausted. The thought of leaving the bed seemed impossible. He dipped a hand experimentally in the neat little puddle on his abdomen, trying to muster the energy to find his wand. Without warning, a strange sensation came over him, like a
Harry shrugged. He wasn’t interested in the particulars. “Sure. For everything. And now you’re afraid. Because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of bigotry and hate. That's why you can’t accept that you’re free, forgiven even, that you have to move on and live your life. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!”
in the parlor with the piano, or the breakfast room, or the guest wing.  “The Potters were purebloods, weren’t they?”
“She’s with Dedalus in the cellar,” Harry offered.
“Potter,” Malfoy hissed, “
“It’s not too bad,” Harry said, considering the pinstripe pajamas. “I mean, I’m sure I’ll manage”.
Harry stewed, irritated and mesmerized by the stretch of Malfoy’s idiotic frock coat across his biceps as he fidgeted in the quiet, horror dawning when he realized what he really wanted to ask was, ‘
^^^^^
only instead of feeling scrubbed, he just felt strangely refreshed.
“You sure you want to do this with everyone here?” Malfoy’s lips caught Harry’s ear. Harry shivered, not even sure of what
“You make me crazy,” Harry blurted out, interrupting Draco. “You make me crazy, and you always have. And I was an idiot, for not seeing how you had changed, except for the obvious fact that you had gotten so stupidly hot…” Harry paused. This wasn’t quite coming out how he had wanted.
Harry glanced around, feeling foolish. He hadn’t realized there were reporters. He took a step towards Malfoy, annoyed. “You
“In a manner of speaking,” Ernie said with a sly look at Malfoy, who was still bright red. “Anyway, what about you Harry? George said you’d thrown Ginny over for a Muggle barista, but that was ages ago.”
“I’ve never had it either,” Ron explained when Harry asked if he might want to come down and see to Hermione. “When Ginny had it, I got sent to live with Auntie Muriel for the week. Honestly, that might have been worse than just getting sick.”
It wasn’t until later that Harry remembered about Ernie MacMillan at all, having gotten off on his own a second time in the cavernous guest suite, thinking furiously about Malfoy’s fingers, strong and precise, pressing against the keys of the piano. He decided he didn’t want to know. It wasn’t like it meant anything anyways.
He’d go to Tesco and see a blonde head over by the produce and let himself imagine for a moment. Or at home, he found he was waiting for the doorbell to ring, which was absurd because the house was still under Fidelius, and Draco probably couldn’t find the front door even if he wanted to.
Dean didn’t reply. Things weren’t bad between them, just complicated. It wasn’t exactly true, what George had said about Harry throwing Ginny over for a Muggle barista. Harry and Ginny had never really properly gotten back together after the war. They had tried, sort of, and parts of it had worked well. The sex was fierce and affectionate, and Harry loved it, how intimate and different it was from any type of closeness he had felt before. But it had mostly been just that, and when Ginny found herself weeping for hours after going to see George, Harry felt useless and distant. And when Harry couldn’t bring himself to visit baby Teddy for months, Ginny seemed unable to relate, holding onto her own family more tightly than ever.
“Well, I can stay here and keep an eye on things. I’m not sure that I can help but sticking around probably won’t hurt either.”
“Well, if you’re so certain it’s a lie, I’m not sure why you’re knocking down my door.” Harry crossed his arms.
“I think you like me this way. You know,
“Malfoy just came through here in a strop,” Ron said through an enormous bite of bacon, “Not sure what’s bothering him, but he was raving and when I offered him a sandwich he just said, ‘See! Even Weasley will have breakfast with me’ and stalked off. Not sure what’s got to him, as far as I can tell, no one else in the house is even up yet. Anyways, where did you go off to last night?”
“You, uh- you could come back tomorrow, if you’re interested. Longbottom will be here as well, he can explain it better than me,” Malfoy said. “And then, Hermione, if you’re not done working with Dedalus yet, you can keep on.”
“Yes.”
“How dare you, I’ll leave when I see fit,” Mrs. Greengrass sputtered. “I’ll involve Narcissa, you’ll see.”
“Well, you’ll have to tell Draco goodbye from us,” Hermione said, looking around. Harry hadn’t seen Malfoy since he’d left him sticky and sleepy-eyed the night before. He hadn’t said goodbye to Malfoy then, either.
“Lucky me,” Draco muttered, “Well, what’s your plan now that you’ve apprehended me or whatever. You know I’ve already had a trial. You were there.”
“Oh, and you do? Draco Malfoy, restoration expert? When have you ever fixed anything in your life?” Malfoy coughed and Harry remembered the vanishing cabinet, a sick feeling in his stomach.
was weak and it faltered as Harry threw every hex and jinx he had ever learned.
Hermione was at dinner as promised, looking like her old self. She was deep in conversation with Malfoy and Dedalus, something about the magical cores of houses, when Harry came in from the gardens where he’d spent the afternoon tramping about and lying in the sun. He felt positively grubby standing next to Malfoy, who had changed out of the breeches into soft looking charcoal trousers that draped devastatingly well. It just made Harry want to reach out and muss him up a little.
Harry didn’t spend the night. He went back to his room and laughed helplessly when he saw his shoes, still sitting on the floor by the bed. In the morning, he beat Malfoy downstairs and had coffee waiting. He alternated between reading the
Harry’s face fell. “Isn’t it a bit more complicated than that?” Draco’s chest tightened.
beautiful, like a scene out of a movie, the shadows building anticipation towards a dramatic shift in the plot. As if on cue, two figures appeared, approaching on horseback.
Harry tucked his face into Malfoy’s neck and reached around blindly for his arse, groaning when he realized Malfoy was wearing breeches again.
. Fine. You still don’t know anything. Take me to the bed.”
Two spots of color emerged high on Malfoy’s cheekbones and he gave a stiff nod. They hadn’t really seen each other much in the last year, keeping their distance at Ministry functions when the need arose. Harry wasn’t sure what Malfoy had been doing since the war, other than damage control.
Eventually Harry gave up and tiptoed down the hall to the toilet. He rounded the corner and smacked straight into a wall. Only, it wasn’t a wall, it was Draco Malfoy, looking cross in pinstriped pajamas.
“Alright, Harry.” It sounded strange in his low voice, but Harry thought he liked it. Draco kissed his other cheek and then his mouth. He spoke again, his lips millimeters from Harry’s own. “Sweetheart.” Harry shivered. He liked the sound of that more.
“Malfoy-- er, I didn’t expect to see you. We were told you were away.” Harry forced himself to look Malfoy in the eye, dragging his gaze upwards.
When she paused at last, Harry couldn’t help himself changing the subject. “Hermione, I saw Malfoy, he’d been swimming. In a lake? Pond? I didn’t know he could swim, I guess I’d never thought about it.”
“Insolent boy!” Greengrass shouted, gripping the bannister, swaying from the force of her anger. “You must tell me at once, has Draco Malfoy promised himself to you?”
“Hi Nev, er, yes, very interested,” Harry blustered, acutely aware of Pansy next to him.
“He’s manning the till while George makes a massive fireworks order,” Ginny said. “I wanted to get in on it to be honest, it sounds like fun, but George doesn’t want me accidentally blowing up the workroom. Something about never really being the best Potions student or whatever, not that anyone would have said he was either.”
want?” Harry hovered over Malfoy, waiting.
When it was time to turn another page, Malfoy darted a look at Harry as he reached across. Dissonant chords rang out and then the sound stopped entirely, Malfoy clamping his right hand over his left forearm, searching frantically for something. Harry hadn’t even noticed the Mark; he had forgotten all about it in the close room with the music.
“I’m a wolf?” Draco said, torn between derision and amusement.
Malfoy’s robes finally pooled on the floor and he reached for Harry, slipping the old jacket off of Harry’s shoulders, finding the button of his jeans. “Malfoy, come on,” Harry said, his voice low, as Malfoy slid his hands up underneath the threadbare t-shirt, gentle, skimming over sensitive skin. Malfoy hummed and then his broad, cool hands slid back and under Harry’s buttocks, picking him up in a fluid motion. Harry’s legs wrapped around Malfoy’s waist automatically and he couldn’t help clinging to him, impressed and turned on. The effect was ruined a little when Malfoy caught his foot on the carpet, staggering up to the bed, and dropping Harry with a startled look. Harry laughed at him and he scowled before relenting with a rueful half-smile Harry had never seen before. Harry smudged the edge of it with his thumb, pulling Malfoy down for another kiss.
A window was open to the east and the sun shone through setting Draco aglow in the dim study. “Well then.” Draco stepped forward, took Harry’s hand and pressed it to his lips.
“You know what he looks like now, don’t pretend,” Malfoy muttered in Harry’s direction. “Tomorrow, Pansy, Longbottom is coming by tomorrow.”
“And what of it?”
“Rivers and streams actually,” Malfoy mumbled. He did a surreptitious cleaning charm on himself and the floor, then crossed the room to the door, stopped and reached an arm out. “I…” he faltered, blushing. Harry waited, but Malfoy just turned and left.
“Have I slept with Ernie MacMillan since July? No, Draco, some of us have standards.”
“Stay here?” Harry asked, confused, and thinking about Malfoy still.
Harry shut his eyes, mind awash with memories of Draco in the garden at Malfoy Manor, taking fastidious notes for Neville, at Andromeda’s cottage holding Teddy like he was the most precious thing in the world, holding
“Well, that’s his name, isn’t it?”
“Hiya Harry.” Michael waved and then ran his hand through his hair. “Somehow, I feel like I should have known.” He looked back to Malfoy. “See you at Hogwarts, I guess. Or, maybe not?” Michael’s eyes flitted once more to Harry before he finally made for the stairs.
“I bet you never knew Draco was such a swot,” Pansy said, peering up at Harry from under the wide brim of her hat.
Malfoy smirked. “It’s never bothered you before.”
“Just because you killed the Dark Lord doesn’t mean they have to listen to you.” But he could feel his hands shaking and knew Harry could see them too.
Draco was silent through it all, he seemed too stunned to say anything.
Draco just hummed in response and shrugged, turning Harry’s face back to his, his hand steady, fingers cool against his cheek.
Harry squinted back, contrary in the mornings, especially with Pansy Parkinson. “Well, he never beat Hermione in anything. Or Neville, in Herbology, for that matter.”
Harry thought back on his interactions with Draco in school, steeped in loathing and righteous anger. It was true that Draco was a bully and a bigot, but he had also been magnetic, catching Harry in his orbit again and again. Even if it hadn’t felt
Tucked away from all the partygoers outside, Malfoy moved slowly. He carefully removed his formal robes as he kissed Harry up against the doorframe, long and lingering. The week that they had spent apart seemed to have sweetened things, Harry’s breath stuttering when Malfoy reached up to stroke his cheek and take off his glasses from where they had been digging in. Before, Harry had felt a familiar hostility humming at the edge of his thoughts, pushing him to bite and tug and collide with Malfoy, reminding him of times they had scuffled in school. He still felt some of that urge to fuck Malfoy up, fuck himself up in the process, but even more so, he was overwhelmed by a feeling of uncomplicated pleasure.
“Maybe he’ll teach you,” Hermione said sweetly, her eyebrows raised. Harry thought he was being teased, but he couldn’t be sure. Honestly, he could never really be sure what the hell was happening where Malfoy was concerned these days. “Look, you can ask him now.” She nudged Harry and pointed towards a set of French doors that opened onto the patio from the Manor, Malfoy coming through. He had dressed in a linen shirt, open at the throat, pressed grey trousers, and loafers without socks, giving a flash of delicate ankle as he crossed the limestone. His hair was still damp and curling at his collar. Harry’s palms itched.
“You, throw a tantrum?” Harry said, making eye contact with Draco for the first time that morning. “Unheard of.”
“I think he’s a kneazle. And he doesn’t like you very much,” Draco responded. “I don’t blame him.”
Harry gaped at the painting. She shrugged back. “You’ll figure it out, I’m sure. The Greengrasses were always a ghastly sort anyway.”
Harry wasn’t sure who leaned in first, or if he even leaned at all, but then they were kissing, hot and sure, Harry reaching out to pull Malfoy closer still. Draco turned his head and Harry kissed his cheek, his ear. “I have caught you, haven’t I?” he whispered, low and wondering.
Harry tried not to imagine the circumstances under which Theodore Nott might have taught Malfoy to gently remove bodily fluids, likely either a bedroom or a crime scene, maybe both, and just nodded in response. Malfoy flicked the door locked and pulled the covers up. “If you’re good and you don’t snore, I’ll give it to you again in the morning.” He said it lightly, the old, haughty tone from earlier reemerging. Harry tried to feel annoyed, but instead he was turned on thinking about morning sex, betrayed by his spent cock twitching with interest.
“Oh well, you know, he had Doxy flu as a child, so it wasn’t a problem for him to visit when I was contagious.”
“How do you know I’ve never had Doxy flu?” Harry eyed the elf’s tight grip on the doorknob.
“I can be useful,” Harry protested mildly, running a hand through his hair. He turned to face Draco properly in the dim light.
“Er, maybe,” Harry muttered.
“To the bed.” Harry’s voice was deep and Draco could feel it, vibrating through him.
“Really?” asked Hermione, sounding pleased.
Luna laughed. “I think my aura has that effect on some people. She’s supposed to marry Draco anyway.”
It was the week before school was set to begin. Harry was staying at the Leaky because he didn’t have anywhere else to be. He didn’t bother trying to figure out why Malfoy had taken a room. It didn’t seem relevant any more, why Malfoy did anything. Instead, Harry listened. He learned Draco’s routine: In the morning he took coffee downstairs, and then later, tea, in his room. In the evenings, there were calls with his mother and Pansy, reassuring them that he was ready to go back for an eighth year at Hogwarts, they needn’t worry.
Harry scrambled to sit up too. “Oh, no! Just, in the future, maybe? If we ever…”
“I’m going to fix this,” Harry promised, and then he left.
When Greyback was taken into custody and Teddy was returned home, they gave statements in Andromeda’s garden, a sort of makeshift debriefing with Kingsley’s partially rebuilt force. Harry couldn’t focus on the questions, watching the upstairs window where he knew Andromeda was trying to put Teddy to sleep. Next to him, Draco stood very straight and tall, neatly evading any inquiries about how he knew where to find the cave. The minute the Aurors finally left, Harry made for the back door to the cottage with Draco on his heels.
Malfoy shrugged. “Maybe.”
“Well, Parkinson will probably be at this party as well, if you wanted to join her this time. Malfoy invited her,” Harry said.
“THIS ISN’T JUSTICE,” Potter bellowed when the decision was handed down. Life imprisonment in Azkaban. Draco said nothing, too shocked that he had the righteous Potter anger on his side for once.
“You can come out from under that cloak now, Potter.” Malfoy called out into the darkness, his voice echoing off the flagstones. Harry hesitated. Malfoy sighed. Out of the shadows, something that sounded suspiciously like Crookshanks meowed loudly.
Draco burst out laughing. “The look on your face! Merlin!” Harry poked him in the side. “No, I know, I know. I don’t really want to live here either.” He gestured vaguely to the room, the house. They were laying on a mattress on the floor of a bedroom that wasn’t too damaged.
Harry got up, began to pace around the small room. “I was raised to be a
“Actually, it wasn’t about that at–” Malfoy started to say, only he was cut off when Harry briefly lifted him up off his feet, maneuvering them onto the little bed.
“That settles it.” Dedalus squeezed his arm excitedly. “Wonderful, wonderful…Oh Draco, is your mother here? I must go say hello!”  Malfoy nodded stiffly and gestured towards the house.
After he finished, and Cato shooed him from the dishes, Harry heard music floating in from another wing of the house. He followed the sound until he found Malfoy in a small sitting room, playing the piano. He stood in the doorway listening, watching Malfoy’s hands as they moved deftly across the keys. After a moment, the music stopped.
“Malfoy, where’s your mother?” Harry called out, forgetting for a moment that he was technically snooping.
Ron shook his head slowly, speaking carefully.“For a little while, it was nice to think we could be properly brothers. But we’ve always been like this, Ginny or no. I found my way back to you in the forest for you, you know?”
“And will
Harry growled a little, thinking about Michael in his place.
Once he had caught his breath, he lay down, exhausted. These attacks had begun not long after the final battle at Hogwarts, always prompted by something he couldn’t anticipate, taking him out sometimes for hours at a time. Initially, he had thought something had been left inside him from Voldemort, still poisoning him. He shared his theory with Hermione and Ron after an unexpected storm ripped through the garden at Grimmauld place and left him gasping for air, causing alarm and embarrassment during a pickup Quidditch game. At their insistence, he had gone to see Dark Magic specialists at St Mungo’s who ran tests and scans, each turning up nothing. After the final test, a terrible exercise that required him to stand completely alone in a dark room while waves of terror rolled through him, he was transferred from Dark Magic to Mind Healing.
Malfoy, it was just the convenience of it, having someone around who wanted you as much as you wanted them. Which at this point, Harry could admit was quite a lot.
“You thought I was asking you to move in?” Draco sat up part way, his expression all concern and confusion.
“Er, party?” Harry wasn’t sure what was stranger, that Ernie MacMillan was planning a party with the Slytherins or that he had just invited Harry.
“Bed-time?” she asked so innocently, that Harry guessed she’d been standing at the door eavesdropping for quite some time.
“How did you know it was me?”
Eventually it got too difficult to stay away, which was how Harry wound up accidentally Apparating directly into the small study at Malfoy Manor. Miraculously, Draco was there, mudding and taping the newly repaired wall. Harry caught himself on the desk, which was still covered in blueprints and drawings, the photo of Harry in Sirius’ jacket now hanging charmed to the wall behind it.
The walls at the Leaky Cauldron were paper thin. Harry knew this because he could hear Malfoy next door. He could hear him walking around, the sound of slippers on worn wooden floors. He could hear him making Floo calls, listening to the Weird Sisters on the wireless, and once, crying softly late at night. In the hallway, Malfoy was usually quiet. He had startled the first time they ran into each other, eyes gone comically wide, pink mouth slack with surprise. But he didn’t say anything, just nodded and turned the other way, heading back to his room.
“Er, Cato, how is Hermione doing? Do you think I could see her later tonight?” Harry asked, picking at his meal.
“A lot, probably,” Harry replied glumly, finding that he liked the pajamas almost as much as the breeches.
. Malfoy was holding himself up, tentatively rocking into Harry with care. He pressed his face into Harry’s neck and reached down to grip Harry’s cock between them, everything hot and wet and sensitive.
“Are you feeling better then?” Harry asked, wanting to think about something else.
For a while, Harry felt a strange sense of anticipation, like if he entered a random room at the right time, Malfoy might be there waiting for him. He ate breakfast with Seamus and Dean and was distracted thinking about Malfoy going down on him at the table. Or after flying in the garden with Ginny, he was a little disappointed that Malfoy wasn’t there in the living room, sneering at him. It wasn’t that he
,” Harry whispered back without thinking.
“Well, stop sneaking around. It’s like school. I could swear you were following me again.” Malfoy looked guarded in the dim lighting.
On the walk back up to the Manor, they were intercepted by an owl. The message was addressed to Harry. When he opened it, he found the ink was smudged and there was a spot where the parchment had ripped from a quill pressed too hard.
At that, it seemed Malfoy could stand their conversation no longer. Still looking at the ground, he nodded and said, “Excuse me.” He turned on his heel, squelching towards the main house, apparently too flustered for any drying charms.
“I don’t know about that,” a familiar voice floated in from the doorway. “I seem to remember lots of clippings—”
“Maybe?” Malfoy reached out and rucked up Harry’s t-shirt, his fingers finding bare skin, smiling when Harry shivered at his light touch. “Okay.”
Draco Malfoy was beside him, looking like he’d rather fall off his horse than say hello. Hermione shot Harry a look, which he interpreted to mean that she’d rather Malfoy fell off his horse as well. Not wanting to appear rude in front of Diggle, Harry waved and said, “Hullo, Malfoy.”
“Well, that’s generally what people do, when they’re seeing each other.”
Harry palmed the back of his neck. He hadn’t considered
“Matches are always complicated, you know. Finding someone for Sirius was impossible, even when he was just a little boy, always terrorizing the children of our best contacts, but you couldn’t do much better than a Malfoy heir.”
“Er, right, thank you Cato, I’ll uh, just be on my way then to see her.” Harry hurried first in the wrong direction, doubled back, and found the correct staircase. Once there, he paced outside of Hermione’s room for a moment, willing his erection away.
Harry stepped into the hearth feeling strangely relieved and empty all at once.
“Well, he apologized and cried a little, so we decided we had better move on and start over.”
“Oh, and you did?” Harry tried to smile back.
“Not currently, I don’t think. But it’s only a matter of time before Narcissa pushes him to propose. She can be very persuasive, when she wants to be.”
Harry allowed Cato to lead him back to the breakfast room, where he used the Floo to let Ron know what was happening.
routine. Bullshit, if you ask me,” Harry said, still irritated. He hadn’t meant to forget about what a prick Malfoy was, just because he was apparently good at blowjobs.
“You have traveled through time before,” Harry reminded her, “it was very stressful, and involved a lot of schoolwork.”
“Harry?” Hermione’s voice rang out through the door. “Is that you out there? Cato says it’s perfectly fine to come in.”
“She came to see
“I always did say you loved the attention. Did you call the reporters here yourself?”
Thankfully the door opened, and Hermione teetered in, behind an enormous stack of books. She dropped them noisily on the desk next to Malfoy, who managed to only jump a little.
“How is Draco?” Luna asked, knocking Harry out of his thoughts. “I haven’t seen him in ages.”
“Oh no, away on business. Too bad, you’ll miss him entirely I think.” Dedalus shook his head. “Now then, should we begin? I think the best place to start is likely the cellar. Harry, would you care to join us?” Harry considered the cellar at Malfoy Manor and backed away unconsciously.
Malfoy took a step back and Harry followed, walking until they were against the wall. “Any of it, I guess,” Malfoy murmured, looking at Harry from under the curve of his lashes. Harry pressed himself up against Malfoy hard enough that the wall must have been digging into his back.
“Well, I might see him in the Great Hall at meals, or in class. Can’t really avoid anyone fully at Hogwarts, the castle’s not actually that big.”
“It won’t change what’s happened,” she said firmly, “he’s safe now. You can’t keep watch by his crib forever.”
Hermione smiled back. “Oh, details! Anyways, I’m glad you’re here.”
“Right, of course.” Malfoy swallowed and frowned, looking downward. “And Hermione is well? And her, uh Weasley? Ronald?”
“Good, excellent. Potter, I trust the gardens were to your liking?” Malfoy turned to Harry now, still formal in his address, the only hint of their earlier soggy run-in staining his cheeks and neck pink.
Malfoy blinked. “The vegetables. Yes, I’ve been helping Longbottom prepare plants to transplant back to Hogwarts this fall. Our greenhouses are full as well. Part of the restoration. We prioritized that over the Manor kitchens.”
“With Sprout yeah, but I think I would have noticed if he had said that he was also working with Malfoy.” Harry stood, gripping the back of his chair.
.” Malfoy slid one hand up into Harry’s curls to tug sharply, the other gripping his t-shirt tightly, fingers hot against his collarbone.
For a second, Harry wasn’t sure what to do, wondering if he should go over there or wait for Malfoy to come to him, or just pretend nothing had happened at all. Then, Ernie MacMillan appeared with a drink and canapé for Malfoy and Harry felt a flash of possessiveness, like a shock. He’d forgotten about Ernie. They turned away and the possessive feeling twisted into smug satisfaction when Malfoy neatly sidestepped Ernie’s hand at his lower back.
“You really are stupid, you know that.” Harry got up, poured himself another shot.
“What do you want, Potter?” Malfoy asked harshly, grabbing a jumper from where it had been thrown haphazardly across a sofa, yanking it over his head. He stood up from the piano bench, knocking it backwards, crowding Harry.
“I’m afraid not. She is still quite contagious.” Cato bowed his head slightly, seeming genuinely sorry. “Perhaps tomorrow.”
“No trouble with the gate then?” Dedalus asked, shaking Harry’s hand with a smile. “Draco’s been working to undo most of the nastier wards. Difficult business.”
Afterwards, Cato insisted on Hermione going straight to bed, so as not to overtire her. Dedalus left them after dinner as well.
Malfoy’s fingers trailed downward, ghosting gently behind his balls, circling around and around. Harry realized with surprising clarity that he had been waiting for this all week. He hadn’t been distracted at all by the afternoons spent in the shop or at the Burrow, he’d been imagining this, hoping for it, even.  When Malfoy stopped to take a breath, Harry reminded himself that he was a Gryffindor, affected a casual tone, and said, “You can fuck me if you’d like.”
Harry gestured towards them. “Is it, you know, safe for me to be around those?”
When the tour of the greenhouse was done, Neville took them out to the tree line of a small wood, where there were more little labels, this time stamped in bronze relief, affixed to the bark.
“Come on Ernie, it’s just a letter to Pansy,” Malfoy said, looking irritated.
“Right. Thanks anyways, Cato.” Harry resumed eating in silence.
“Not sacred 28,” Luna said kindly, “so you shouldn’t worry, I think. It would be quite distant.”
CW: This chapter contains a short scene of canon-typical violence, including discussion of implied sexual violence.
“Never took much interest before, I’ll tell you that.” Neville winked at Pansy. “Well, come on then, I’ll explain. These are beds where we’re re-establishing the plants to be sent to Hogwarts for the kitchens, and then we’re doing the same in the greenhouses, only those will be more for Potions and Herbology. We’ve been rebuilding the garden beds and greenhouses at Hogwarts and improving the soil, but all of the planting for this coming school year was done here.”
Harry came to the foyer, still chewing, eyebrows raised.
Malfoy flinched a little. “She said she might do that. And uh, how long have you been in Wiltshire?”
They locked Draco up after the war, in a cell block with the Carrows and Dolohov. There were trials, quick and dirty, before the tattered remains of the Wizengamot. Draco was tried as an adult, and nothing, not even the testimony of Harry Potter himself, could save him from the vengeance of the old guard, furious and eager to punish the boy who let Death Eaters into their precious Hogwarts.
Harry laughed, surprised. “I’d say I was offended that you weren’t displaying it more prominently, but then I suppose I understand. I mean, what would people say, Draco Malfoy hanging pictures of Harry Potter in his house, they’d think you’d gone mad.”
“Now that’s just sad. Anyways, you know that’s not what I meant. Shouldn’t you be tucked in with all the other Gryffindors?”
“It’s just a garden, Malfoy,” Harry said, uncomfortable. An awkward moment passed, Malfoy’s eyes still trained to the ground. “I mean, the vegetables looked really, er, green? And organized?”
Hermione accepted the invitation with enthusiasm, launching into the detailed description of her findings, and Malfoy nodded along politely. When Cato arrived with lunch, Malfoy bowed out and Dedalus joined them in his place, starting a long and boring conversation about the historical occupants of Malfoy Manor.
“You, Draco Malfoy, a Death Eater,
“You know, the meal people eat in the mornings,” Malfoy said in that awkward, stiff voice, still looking upwards.
“You might check in with her about it, then. Last I heard she was engaging in her own, what did you call it? Promiscuity?” Harry spoke coolly, thinking of the way Astoria had looked at Luna.
Affixed to the wall behind Malfoy was the Diggle Family Crest, which looked to be hundreds of years old and very heavy. The symbol of the crest, flames encircling an eagle in flight, nagged at Harry even more so than the strangeness of eating dinner with Draco Malfoy. Something Ernie said about the rebuilding effort at Hogwarts jogged his memory at last.
The room was too warm. Harry wondered if Malfoy and Ernie MacMillan had always been on first name terms. He opened his mouth to ask, and then realized that Ernie’s hand was inching upwards, and forgot the question. Malfoy flushed all the way down to his pirate shirt, but he just smirked and said, “I think she’ll come for the party anyway.”
The man beamed down at them. “The very same. So nice you see you both!” He turned to his companion and gestured him forward, saying, “Come now Draco, you must say hello.”
-connected?” asked Harry, finding he was still limited to one-word sentences.
“Excellent!” Dedalus said, and he was off again.
and motioned Harry forward towards the dark opening. Inside, Greyback was pacing. Teddy sat on the ground, wailing, his chubby fists clenched.
“Hmm well, it was a bit more complicated with you, wasn’t it?” Hermione said lightly, “More than just realizing he was bigoted or a bully.”
Ginny made a face at the mention of Malfoy. Despite how he had spent the past few days, Harry sort of agreed. More and more it seemed like the rest of the world had moved on. Harry often sensed a creeping expectation he was just going to get on with these people, the way Diggle and MacMillan were. People like Parkinson who had wanted to turn him over to Voldemort to save herself, and Malfoy, who had really believed in it all, at least in the beginning, bigoted and cruel even to the end. He didn’t regret testifying for Malfoy, but it had felt like a debt repaid.
Harry’s eyes burned, and he hugged his knees, staring at the floor.
“Mmm, not likely, I never sleep with fans, too strange,” Harry said, as if this wasn’t, stroking a line down the curve of Malfoy’s spine. His whole body was heavy with satisfaction and sleep, and he let it pull him under. He woke up once in the night, in a cold sweat, unable to remember what he had been dreaming about. Malfoy still lay beside him, breathing deeply and undisturbed. His first instinct was to get up, get away from Malfoy, the terrible clammy feeling seemingly tied to his presence in the room. Contemplating where he might go, Harry watched the rise and fall of Malfoy’s chest, steady and calm, until his own heart stopped racing, sleep dragging him under again.
“Genealogical magic?” Harry echoed. Hermione shook her head slightly.
The joist Malfoy was levitating dropped to the floor, his back stiffening. After a beat, he answered shortly. “Staying with friends.”
“I’m sorry Mr. Potter, but you cannot go in,” Cato said firmly, holding the door shut. “Ms. Granger has contracted Doxy flu and is highly contagious. Seeing as you have never had it yourself, it would be unwise to expose you.”
“And now you’re… playing together again?” Harry asked, grimacing as he heard it come out.
Mrs. Greengrass looked sharply at Ginny’s retreating back. “Just another example of your infamous promiscuity, I presume?”
Harry didn’t ask how she got them, and they set to work.
“It’s like he doesn’t even see me anymore,” Ginny said bitterly.
“Never thought about what? Swimming?” Hermione turned to face Harry, and his face went hot. She looked annoyed, then resigned. “He probably learned as a kid, I feel like most people do.”
Harry peered around in spite of himself, at the sound of Malfoy’s name. “He’s not here, is he?”
At dinner, Harry ate alone, served a meal in the kitchen by Cato. He hadn’t seen Dedalus or Malfoy or even Ernie MacMillan all day.
Malfoy’s face was very near, and Harry could see freckles he’d never noticed before, across the bridge of his nose. Harry found himself counting them in time with his own heartbeat, wild in his chest.
is wrong with you?”
The color drained from Malfoy’s face. “That’s what you think of me? Draco Malfoy, Death Eater?”
“The Malfoy Arboretum was a bit of a legend, in its time.” Neville gestured expansively to the leaves overhead. The identification of the trees was clearly very old, some of them dating back hundreds of years, and though most of the species struck Harry as ordinary, they seemed to hum with a deep magic.
“Um yes, very well I think.”
Harry pulled away, impatient and pacing.  “Not to be rude, but how? You’ve got no experience in this sort of thing and not to mention your defensive spells were useless the last time I checked.”
Harry groused as he wandered the grounds of the estate. Even so, the combination of good weather and stunning landscape made it difficult to feel too annoyed. Staying a few extra days in such a beautiful place was hardly a chore, and Harry reasoned he could avoid Malfoy in the massive old house while he waited for Hermione to improve.
. I didn’t get to have a family, didn’t get to experience love, until I was 11. I could have! But that was taken away from me. Everything I did, every path I took, choice I made, was pre-determined in the service of something greater than myself.” Draco knocked back his own shot and grimaced, but didn’t say anything.
“Harry, my boy!” Dedalus Diggle’s voice rang out, cutting him off before he could finish. “So glad you could make it. Really, you’re the guest of honor, I should say.”
“It’s your name, isn’t it?” Harry felt a little shy all of a sudden. “You can call me Harry, if you’d like.” Draco leaned over and kissed him on the cheek, his mouth hovering near Harry’s ear.
In a small study off the main hall, there was Malfoy, his shirtsleeves rolled up, re-framing a wall that looked like it had blown out in a serious explosion. It looked like hard work, Malfoy’s back muscles straining as he maneuvered the lumber, even using magic.
he thought, weakly. “Why can't it happen to Ron for once, or Hermione, or–”
Harry didn't answer immediately.
“What are you talking about?” said Malfoy, irritably.
Potter's eyes widen in shock.
Potter who cast the spell that misfired, but given what he had been doing right before their duel, he doesn’t feel particularly keen on the whole thing coming to Dumbledore’s attention.
Harry grinned. Malfoy was pretty clearly in some amount of pain – the snake's manouver looked excruciating – and if there was anything that he could do to bring him some distraction, well, who was him to refuse the call of duty?
“Good idea,” said Harry, undoing his trousers. His dick, slick from his excitement, looked enormous next to Malfoy's puckered hole. He pushed the head in. Malfoy let out a sound that was half groan, half moan. Harry grabbed the back of Malfoy's knees and sank the rest of his erection inside the intoxicating warmth of his rectum, too overpowered by his desire to worry about the snake roaming the other boy's insides.
“I can’t ever live in Malfoy Manor though.” Harry rolled onto his side, so he was facing Draco.
Harry glanced again at Malfoy who looked back finally, his expression unreadable. “Why not? I’ve been hungry for ages anyways”.
They wandered through the rows of plants, some humming or snapping, most just waving gently in the still, humid air. Pansy asked Neville the proper names for everything saying, “You don’t mind, do you? It’s only that I’ve forgotten since last time...” her neatly manicured fingers resting gently above his elbow. Harry considered Malfoy’s elbows. They were exposed in the heat, and the skin just below the crease of his left elbow still marred with the faded dark mark. If the rest of Draco had become bulky with muscle, his joints remained fine, dainty even. Harry thought of Malfoy nimbly maneuvering their bodies in the guest bed until they clicked into place. He thought Malfoy at the piano, his fingers a graceful contrast with the strength in his forearms, and their harsh whispers reaffirming their long-held hatred, probably a lie already.
Harry made an impatient noise. “You know what I mean.”
Harry did take off the cloak then. “What are you doing with Crookshanks?”
“Hiya Harry!” Neville was grinning at him, stowing his wand, the plants fully watered. “Malfoy said you wanted to hear about the work we’ve been doing?”
“Harry!” Luna replied, smiling at him. “Do you know Astoria Greengrass?” Luna pointed out a blonde girl who Harry thought looked familiar, wearing a plunging beaded dress and bright red lipstick. She kept glancing at Luna, her eyes sliding over Luna’s tube top appreciatively.
“How did I know that the things I was made to do were right? Do you know how lucky I was, that those choices made for me were made by people on the “right” side?” Harry made exasperated air quotes. “You tell me what you were, that you were some messenger of evil. You think you know what it was, but I see what the true story is and you can’t.”
“Yeah, er, Hermione mentioned something about the grounds? Gardens?”
It occurred to Harry that Cato spoke more fluently than any other house elf he knew, but he thought it would be rude to ask.
Harry couldn’t tell if the question was mocking or genuine. “What, and have Michael Corner’s sloppy seconds?”
Draco was still listening. Harry sat back down in his seat across the table, picked up his empty glass, and said, “You can’t see what you are. I can see everything. You’re a wolf.”
Harry heard none of this. He was too distracted by the way Malfoy looked in the dying light of the evening. Had Malfoy always been so broad? Harry let his eyes wander to where Malfoy’s thighs sat astride the horse. Realizing that Malfoy was wearing
promise me that you will leave him out of your
Harry searched Draco’s face and saw his own terror mirrored back at him, but also something in the set of his jaw that looked like determination or maybe strength. Things he had never seen there before.
“Don’t be crass Ginevra.” Harry went across the room and stole her drink. Ginny was beautiful in a sleek satin dress, with skinny little straps that made her freckled shoulders look incredible and strong.
“No, he hasn’t.”
“No.”
“You hate me,” Draco said, regretting it immediately, “why bother?”
Malfoy left the room, slamming the door behind him. Harry lay back down and groaned. To think that just hours ago, he had been looking forward to morning sex. He dressed and went out to find Ron on the lawn, grateful for the bacon sandwiches he had somehow already rustled up.
“Dedalus Diggle?”
Malfoy quirked an eyebrow. “Guest of honor?”
“Draco Malfoy is engaged to my daughter,” Mrs. Greengrass hissed furiously. “A strong match, made when they were children. I won’t see that taken from her.”
“Of course not,” Malfoy said wildly, waving his forearm at Harry’s face. “I never have!” He stared at the Mark so intensely that Harry thought he might be trying to do some kind of wandless, wordless magic.
“Fireworks that you have to buy after hours?” Malfoy raised his eyebrows.
^^^^^
He had also testified for Draco and Narcissa. Their trials were held very early on in the process, a high-profile affair that was covered extensively by the press, the public breathless, hanging onto every word. Narcissa had maintained her steely countenance, but Draco was a wreck, pallid and lifeless as the charges were brought forth. Up on the witness stand, Harry had described in very plain language how each of them had saved his life. Afterwards he was sick in a Ministry toilet. Lucius was sent to Azkaban.
“Of course. You’ll see him next week though. Not to worry!” Dedalus beamed, handing them the Floo powder.
“I want to try as well–” Harry started and stopped again, horrified to find that he felt like crying. For his part, Draco looked like he was only one more declaration away from losing it too.
“No, I don’t think I will, thanks,” Harry said shortly, moving to open the door.
“Oh, you know, just arranging some fireworks for the party,” he said as he walked over to the Floo.
?” Malfoy gestured wildly at Harry’s bare chest.
“Oooh very moody,” Ginny said as he came downstairs, “hoping to catch someone’s eye? I hear Tony Goldstein has been on the prowl.”
Harry shifted Teddy to his hip and sent a
“Sneaking around? I was going to the toilet. You’re the one creeping out of Ernie MacMillan’s room!” Harry replied hotly. It wasn’t like school
you?” Malfoy said faintly. His eyes were very grey. Harry didn’t know what to say. He looked instinctively to Hermione and found that she was watching them with a thoughtful expression.
“Yes, and you tried to kill me in a toilet!” Malfoy said, “But somehow I still wanted to eat fucking breakfast with you.”
They gathered themselves quickly, any afterglow obliterated when Malfoy wondered aloud if Dedalus meant to join them for breakfast.
“Well, certainly not to remember the morning,” Malfoy said.
Hermione’s eyes narrowed, but she didn’t say anything else on the subject.
, you said it yourself. And I should say that you look like you’re going to creep
“Let me know when you do,” Draco reached out and curled his fingers in Harry’s collar, ignoring Crookshanks as he hissed in annoyance.
Draco grabbed Harry’s wrist.
“Malfoy told you that?” Harry asked, tilting a look at Malfoy, who still had a firm grip on Pansy, clutching at her shoulder. If his fingers were digging in, she didn’t let on, just kept smiling, saying “Oh well, you know Draco,” although Harry was beginning to wonder, had been wondering this whole summer probably, whether he did know Draco at all.
Malfoy swallowed. His face was splotchy, the redness spreading to his neck and chest. “Right. Uh, ok. Well, the first thing is—” he paused and leaned down to kiss Harry swiftly, which seemed to have a calming effect. “Real lube is much better than conjured.”
,” Mrs. Greengrass said, somehow looking down her nose at Harry, even though she was a good deal shorter than him.
“We played together as boys. Sacred 28 and all that,” Ernie said, as if that explained everything.
“Oh my! I thought that was, but I never imagined, not here….”An excited voice rang out as the horses drew nearer. Harry squinted upwards, not sure he recognized the man speaking.
Harry went back into his room and closed the door behind him. His heartbeat was too loud to hear what was happening next door, a small mercy. He sat on the edge of the bed, and took off his shoes. If he wasn’t wearing any shoes then he couldn’t walk back out into the hall and take the five paces to Malfoy’s door. Harry slid to the floor with a groan. Even an hour before, the situation would have been unthinkable. But now it was crystal clear, something he’d seen that he couldn’t unsee.
“I let you do a lot more than that.” Harry knew, even as he said it, that wasn’t the point. “How am I the villain here?” His head was pounding. He watched Malfoy dress, his fingers trembling too much to close the buttons of his formal robes. He had to use magic to do them up instead.  “You stepped on my face and left me to bleed, invisible on the ground, you called Hermione slurs, you treated Ron like trash–”
“She looks… interested.”
“You got what you wanted, didn’t you?”
“Oh! Changed your mind?”
“Of course,” Dedalus said warmly, “I think you should feel free to explore. We’ll meet you on the patio when we break for lunch.”
Harry grimaced at his lap, took a breath, and opened the door.
“Well, George Weasley is designing them specially for me.” Dedalus looked sheepish as he reached around for the jar of Floo powder. “Brilliant young man!”
“And Draco hasn’t bothered you?”
“Malfoy, did you nick this the night of the party?”
Draco flexed his hand. “The foot is a metaphor for my inheritance?” His voice was dry.
,’ Harry imagined himself saying, ‘
“Stay for breakfast,” Harry repeated, feeling like he must not be completely awake.
“Couldn’t sleep. Saw you were skulking around and decided to see what you were doing instead,” Harry said, picking at a thread on his cuff.
Once, after one too many whiskeys, and in a maudlin mood that wasn’t helped by the sad records Neville preferred to play after dinner, Harry asked Ron if he cared that he and Ginny weren’t having a happy-ever-after.
“Harry, are you worried about the incest factor of sleeping with
A mountain ash tree was bright red with late summer berries, and when Harry read the plaque, he saw that it had been growing on the Malfoy estate for nearly four hundred years. He stood underneath the tree for some time, examining the bark and admiring the berries, feeling the coolness of its shade. Harry wondered what the tree had thought of the war, if it had minded providing safe harbor for monsters. He felt a little ridiculous, imagining the inner life of a tree, and yet the sound of the breeze making its way through the leaves made him certain that the tree had at least borne witness to the war, but that it had not been the only great or terrible thing to happen there over four hundred years.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Why don’t you give the toast if you’re so concerned?”
back then, in hindsight Harry knew he’d gotten a kind of satisfaction from it. And now, even as things between them changed and the world changed, that irresistible magnetism remained, tugging at Harry through it all.
, a precaution given the um, occupation, which is to say that the connection has never been opened since it was made, but I imagine I could access it.”
Ginny darted a look between them, and kissed Harry on the cheek. “She was waiting for me in the square, wouldn’t take no for an answer. I’ll be in the living room,” she murmured. “Give a shout if you need anything.”
“I don’t want anything from you. I’ve already won, remember?” Harry said, trying to recall his earlier plan of avoiding Malfoy.
“Just arrived this morning,” Harry said.
In the end, it was over quickly, Greyback bound on the floor of the cave, his stolen wand tight in Harry’s grasp. Draco stood over Greyback’s prostrate form as Harry ran to Teddy, waving away the protective spells and lifting him into his arms. Teddy was still crying, smearing snot all over Harry’s shirt, his sobs quieting to little hiccoughs while Harry rubbed gentle circles on his back.
“And besides, it obviously means a lot to you,” Hermione said, holding his gaze “he obviously means a lot to you.”
It was strange then, when Harry heard a voice he didn’t recognize. It made sense to go out into the hall. The voice was unfamiliar, but the man standing in the corridor was not. Michael Corner had his hands in his pockets, his face inclined sweetly towards Malfoy, who was looking out from the doorway, the top four buttons of his shirt undone.
Eventually, they did have a visitor, although it wasn’t one Harry could have predicted.
“Oh, but you aren’t concerned about Potters and Weasleys, where there’s certainly been mixing.”
“You could be wearing that damn invisibility cloak and I’d know you were watching me.” Malfoy did look up then; his cheeks were flushed.
ago Draco, you’ll have to act normal around him sometime. And Harry, you and Hermione can come back and bring the Gryffindor set, you still see Longbottom and Thomas and the rest all the time, right?”
“Come on Harry.” Ron looked to Hermione for a moment, eyebrows raised. “You know how you can be about him.”
Malfoy looked up, his eyes dark and fixed on Harry’s. “Yes.” He reached out and grabbed Harry’s chin, pulling him down. “Yes.”
“Oh, but you’ll let me suck your cock. Very nice,” Malfoy fumed as he extricated himself from the bed.
Harry just nodded in response, not trusting himself to speak.
“Uh yes, I suppose it is. Yeah no, Mal- Draco’s been fine, really. Not bothering me at all.” Harry rubbed at the spot where Malfoy had bit him the night before.
“You don’t have to do this, you know,” Harry said, squeezing back.
When he had finished eating, Harry wandered in through the French doors into a large sitting room, and then out into a dark hall. The Manor looked to be in a worse state than the last time Harry had seen it. The marble flooring was cracked and missing in places, and the trim was splintered along door frames and corridors. There was no sign of anyone living there, which shouldn’t have been a surprise. It was hard to imagine Draco Malfoy roughing it among the debris, let alone Narcissa Malfoy. As Harry poked his head into rooms showing varying degrees of destruction, it was clear that there was some restoration effort going on, but it had to be slow going.
Harry felt his face go hot. He hadn’t said anything to anyone, about the blowjobs or anything else. For his part, Ron looked mostly unconcerned, already shrugging and wandering off in the direction of a tray of mini quiches. From there, it was just a blur of champagne and music and trying to persuade Seamus that they shouldn’t go for a dip in Diggle Pond. Despite what Malfoy had said about the reporters, no one bothered Harry for a quote or a handshake or a tearful salute. He felt safely cocooned amongst his friends, Ron and Hermione smiling and laughing and indulging his terrible dancing. Close to midnight, he went and found Luna, who was resting her feet, as she sat near a pack of Hogwarts grads Harry only sort of recognized.
The first firework went off, startling them apart. Harry glanced around. Everyone was preoccupied with the show, murmuring appreciatively as a particularly complicated dragon exploded above them. Harry set his champagne in the grass and took hold of Malfoy’s hips, steering him into the shadows of the house, Malfoy’s back up against the old stone façade.
This compliment put a dark blush onto his cheeks, which Draco quickly blamed on the stifling heat. It wasn't like what Harry had said carried any real merit, as Draco couldn't really control what he saw, and most of the time the visions seemed to be set years in the future—in other words: useless— but. Still. He was a sucker for flattery. "Oh, please. I'd be as useless as her."
That makes sense. Probably a family heirloom of sorts, passed down from generation to generation… but it doesn’t answer the question of
Draco shrugged, then remembered there were no lights. "Whatever it is, it's terrible."
Potter finishes the story when Weasley trails off.
After retrieving a glass from one of the dusty cabinets, Draco poured some icy water into it, eyes trained on Black's vacant face. Unwisely, he sat in the chair opposite him.
“We had guests,” Potter cut in. “Hermione and Ron came over, plus Luna and Seamus dropped in at one point, too. What’s that got to do with his magic, though?”
"Are we having a pyjama party, boys?"
"Um, yes. Like, explore the castle. We have the map to help us and stuff..."
Draco smiled, a bit giddy. They were standing very close. "Every respectable pureblood knows how to waltz, Potter."
detail, though he didn’t interrupt. It wasn’t the right time, to.
At dinner, he sits beside Potter and Weasley across from them. The professors sit further down the table, while other leftover students are positioned haphazardly around. The feast is large and seemingly never-ending, with a delicious apple pie to finish it off. It’s easily one of the better Christmas’ Draco has had, right up there with last year’s, when his mother ordered the elves to cook a few Indian dishes and decorate the Manor with glitter and hanging lights. Draco’s parents were in a happy mood, dancing and kissing the evening away. He doubts anything like that will happen again. He’s lucky to have even got presents from them.
“Serves him right, for freeing Winky!” said Granger, indignant. “I bet he regrets it now. I bet he misses her, in fact.”
Harry shot a look at Tonks, Lupin and Sirius, who all sat at the end of the table, talking amongst themselves. Then, "Not really. I keep thinking, you know, what if the next time I come back here I've got no wand, or... or future at Hogwarts?"
“Just watch.” Potter pulls the watery thing around himself and disappears. Draco hears a gasp that must have come from his own mouth. He reaches toward the place Potter became invisible, but he’s gone. “I’m here now.”
, Draco thought. He’s never encountered such a person before, nor has he ever heard of a Metamorphmagus losing their powers. Of course, he can’t simply say that. Half of his job was just reassuring patients that they would end up alright, and admitting to his cluelessness wasn’t reassuring in the slightest.
"Obviously not."
"I really don't think Sirius should've come," Granger was saying, chewing on a long strand of frizzy hair.
"Morgana's tits! Give me some warning..."
He had a strange feeling of being watched and looked up the staircase. Harry's egg was here... but no sign of him, anywhere... Or, perhaps, Harry simply didn't want to be seen.
Potter made a face that Draco didn’t recognise. It might’ve been confused. “I don’t think so? I doubt I had any more incidents like that than a normal wizard.”
"I envy you, then," said Severus. "The Knight Bus is a filthy form of transportation. Terribly unhygienic, and the conductor is one of the most annoying people I have ever met—Come
I think I’ve heard that before. There are some crazy stories about you, Wood, having breakdowns after your team loses.
“What? No. You’re crazy. And if I had a boner, why would I come to
Or maybe you’re not with Potter! Will Astoria Greengrass be here tonight?
“Gurdyroot Gryffindor.”
Harry pulled Draco into a kiss, and Draco met his lips with enthusiasm. He lay back on the bench and pulled Harry on top of him, so Harry’s body covered his own completely. The kiss turned deep and messy and intense quickly. Draco slipped his hands under Harry’s shirt and explored Harry’s back with his fingertips, relearning the body he’d been apart from for months. Harry leveraged himself with an arm resting on the bench beside Draco’s head as his free hand gripped Draco’s jaw firmly so that he could control the kiss. Harry felt himself hardening as his mouth slipped across Draco’s face and found the spot on Draco’s neck just below his jaw that made Draco moan when he bit it. Harry was working on forming a new love bite there when Draco started speaking in between panting breaths.
Thank you.
He’s in the clouds!
I love Lou because that character is kind of the noble one, you know? And that light that’s in Lou balances out Sawyer’s darkness. But Lou also has a little darkness too, so the two of them really understand each other. I think it’s real beautiful the way they fit together, like they’re meant to be. That, and, of course, the fact that Lou is based off of someone I know and love deeply in my personal life is what makes Lou my favorite.
“I don’t know, I’d say Snarfatuber is an improvement. Isn’t that the name of Slytherin’s founder?”
she was reading.
Dean Thomas, “Charity for Wizarding World Children”
I think we’re probably going to win.
Hell yes.
“Fuck my life,” Pansy said again, twelve years later at the Malfoy-Potter Christmas party.
Yeah, friends like him.
Granger narrowed her eyes at Pansy. “Seriously, Parkinson. This is the last time I’m going to ask you this. What is Malfoy doing with Harry?”
“What are you talking about?”
Pansy turned to the face the voice and realized that the bush of hair that had suddenly entered her personal bubble belonged to a person, and that person was Hermione Granger.
Well, is there? Any romance between the two of you, I mean.
Very much.
“It’s not the hexing I hate so much as your demands that I grovel for your forgiveness afterwards.”
Ah, your ex-girlfriend’s team. Interesting choice.
Team One: The Bolts
We’ll see.
Oh yeah. I look very fit.
. They’re bloody infuriating to be honest. But they’re also funny and kind and just the best person I’ve ever met. Oh, and beautiful. Really fit, yeah.
A Muggle brand?
You know what? I think Pansy probably got lost finding that glass of champagne. I’m going to go see if I can find her. Nice talking to you.
Then who are these angels? Anyone in particular?
I guess, but I’m still not as focused on Quidditch as Wood.
Okay, let’s get started then.
HufflePinky112 asks: “What does Scarlet think of your new makeup line? Does she use it? By the way, you two are cute together.”
“Okay,” Harry said calmly, forcing himself to hide his anticipation.
Oh, I- You really don’t have to-
Harry still didn’t say a word.
Yeah, I guess my fans have done so many crazy things for me that it’s hard to pick one.
Pansy smiled warmly at Draco. “Oh, Drakey-kins, of course you’re good enough for him. Don’t ever think that you’re not, okay?” Pansy paused in the middle of her pep talk to cup Draco’s face in her hands and make him look her in the eye. “Hey, I mean it. You’re amazing. Harry Potter may be the Wizarding World’s Golden Boy, but if he passes up an opportunity to be with you, then all he really is is a damn fool.”
“Yes?” Pansy said, still not getting it.
“I missed you,” Draco confessed, sounding like he was about to cry. “I missed you, and I love you, and you have no idea how much I wish I could’ve just talked to you every day. It’s been so hard, Harry. I don’t know what I’m going to do.”
Well, no matter who inspired you to write the book, I think we can all agree that it’s fantastic. Tell us a little about your upcoming book tour.
“Have I mentioned how much I love you?”
“No, I just need that concealer makeup you have. You know, for my neck.” To demonstrate what he meant, Draco pulled down the collar of his robes, revealing a series of love bites on his neck. Pansy gasped. “I suppose I could use glamour charms or just wear robes, but glamours are hard to keep on for long periods of time, and I don’t feel like wearing robes all the time, they make me look like my father.”
“Oh, we’re not telling the bloody Order, Harry,” Draco said dismissively, rolling his eyes. He was sat on the bench, crossing his arms as he watched Harry pace the small space of the compartment, making his annoyance obvious. Harry had been trying to convince Draco that they had to go to an adult for help for the past three minutes, and Draco was getting bored of constantly shooting down Harry’s ideas.
Harry breathed heavily. “Well, what do you want to do?”
Friends like Draco Malfoy?
So you’re still together with that person?
That’s great. We all love our fans.
Team Two: The Wings
I’m pumped. I honestly can’t wait to show my husband who’s boss.
Harry shook his head vehemently. “No, no. Never. I’m not—I don’t know why I asked, Malfoy, sorry. Forget it. I won’t tell anyone. I’m not that kind of person. I’ll keep your secret.”
Yeah.
Hold up- most important?
“Yes, mistletoe,” Draco said. He tilted his head as he seemed to consider something.
There, there, Malfoy. We can’t all be Harry Potter.
Malfoy’s glare subsided for the most part.
Harry rolled his eyes. “‘Cause we all know how much you
Yes! Potter and Malfoy are right next to each other! Hands outstretched, they’re both so close to a win!
Yeah, Weasley, Granger, tell us what you think of the couple!
Right. What position will you be playing in the match?
“A reminder,” Pansy repeated, and Draco nodded. “Whatever you say,” Pansy said, still sounding weirded out. “I’ll go get the concealer and bring it back here, okay?”
Chaser: Marcus Flint, “St. Mungo’s Medical Foundation”
Stop spreading lies, Potter.
Of course. What are you most looking forward to seeing in Zabini’s fashion show this evening?
After the incident, Harry didn’t really see any change in Malfoy. He was the same with his ceaseless bullying and standard better-than-you attitude. Harry tried to forget the boy he saw on the staircase Christmas night, the boy who was vulnerable and insecure and oddly alluring. He had almost convinced himself he imagined the whole ordeal when suddenly he found himself being yanked by the arm while on his way to meet Ron and Hermione in the Middle Courtyard. He was dragged into a nearby empty classroom, and he was about to take out his wand to defend himself when he realized he was face to face with Draco Malfoy.
I already have stated a million times that Astoria Greengrass and I are strictly friends. Yes, we dated publicly, but that was a small, very brief thing. The relationship that my book is based off of is not a small thing. It’s big, it’s real, it didn’t happen because we were just doing what was expected of us. It happened because it’s meant to be.
Pansy sighed, deciding to let the book be. “Draco’s diary. It’s pink with flowers on it. It’s kind of overtly gay, even for Draco.”
Oh yes, that’s right. You and Potter went to Hogwarts together. And you’re close friends now, aren’t you?
Yeah, um, and I think the person who inspired me to write this book would be thrilled to see you all here today as well.
Um, I don’t have a girlfriend right now, no.
“Sorry?” Pansy said, genuinely confused. She subconsciously took a few steps backward. She had heard the story of Granger punching Draco in third year, and she did not want to be close to this girl when she was in a confrontational mood.
Pansy looked up at Draco from her place on the common room sofa and smiled mischievously. The boy was rubbing the back of his neck and looking at the floor, altogether appearing quite nervous.
“What the-”
“I don’t know. What do you want to do?”
“By ‘them’ you mean the love bites that Harry Potter gave you, correct?” Draco kicked Pansy again, and Pansy smirked. “No, you can’t see them at all,” Pansy assured him.
I don’t know, Wood, I’ve seen you get pretty emotional during practices.
Honestly, I don’t think I can give you any “deets”, sorry. If you want to know about Draco and Harry just ask them, not me. I’m totally not their spokesperson. Or, you know what, ask Ron Weasley, he loves talking about Drarry.
Got yourself a stylist?
Chaser:
Harry smiled. “I
Draco smiled in amusement (or secret fondness) at Harry. “Bubolump is a type of salve. It’s made up of Bubotuber pus and Snarfalump seedlings.”
I see. We’ll let you go now, Harry. Your friends are probably waiting for you.
Draco had just figured out a charm that would make their breath (clearly visible in the cold winter air) morph into shapes and letters. They were  still laughing over Draco making Harry’s breath spell out, ‘I am the Frozen One’ when they stumbled into the castle.
Pansy’s hold on Draco’s arm loosened, and he used the opportunity to pull his arm away from her. Pansy wasn’t fazed by the action though, she was too busy being shocked. “Did you give him a blowie?”
Greer.
You should probably consider yourself lucky for that, Reuben, cause this one doesn’t tend to shut up after he starts talking.
“I promise, Draco.”
“Honestly, Granger, what the fuck are you on? I thought you of all people would know that cocaine is banned at Hogwarts.”
You know, there’s some speculation that Lou is based off Astoria Greengrass. Do you care to comment on that?
“Okay, whatever, Malfoy. But why are you trying to help me in the first place?” Harry asked the question like it should be the obvious question to ask, because, of course, it was. In his mind the only way Draco Malfoy would ever offer him help was if he was held at wand point and threatened with wicked hexes to his perfectly-styled hair.
Relax, Wood.Your secret’s safe with us, I promise. Anyway, shall we move on? My next question is about each of your favorite Quidditch teams.
Hm, did you read it?
“Brilliant!” Pansy exclaimed. Draco tore his gaze from Harry’s mesmerizing fingers just to glare at her. “Draco should be able to help you with that. He finished his own essay three days ago.”
Merlin’s fuckin’ beard! The Snitch is going straight for the ground! The Seekers don’t let up, though!
That’s what counts, isn’t it? Wood, has anyone gotten a tat of you?
The next day, Pansy was once again disrupted in her reading by a certain blond Slytherin. This time, however, she was reading
“It doesn’t have to make sense.” Pansy leaned in closer to Granger, enjoying the way Granger’s eyes dilated as she glanced at Pansy’s lips. “I mean, I’m attracted to you even though that doesn’t make sense.”
Yes. I’m playing for the MH double A, or the Mental Health Awareness Association.
“Whatever. I’m happy for Draco. Him and Potter will never be as great of a couple as Theo and I, but still. They really have something. I can see them getting married and having kids and growing old together.”
At breakfast the next morning, the school turns into a nervous frenzy after somebody overhears McGonagall speaking with Flitwick about a student being attacked in the same way Filch's cat had been. None of the professors deny, which is enough proof it had happened.
Draco swiped a dash of marmalade over his bread and thought about his words. Harry very well could be right; the Ministry had been trying to make him out as crazy all summer, to dispute his claims of the Dark Lord being back, and having him be expelled from Hogwarts would be the cherry on top. Still, he needed to comfort his friend. And more than that, he
, Severus.”
Another voice answers for him. “He was sleeping, Professor. I think he was having a nightmare, because he started yelling.”
"What? The diary? Don't be dramatic.”
On February 14th, Draco enters the Great Hall and is gobsmacked by what he’s greeted with— the walls are covered in horrifying pink flowers, and heart-shaped confetti rain from the ceiling. It is
“Draco.”
“Keen observation,” Draco says, dryly. “To be honest, I thought you might’ve forgotten about
Lucius places a hand on his shoulder, lips thinning in disapproval.
Sirius grimaced, “If you say so. Now, Harry, I wanted to be ready in case anything went wrong at Hogwarts. Your last letter... well, let’s just say things are getting stranger. From the papers I’ve been stealing, I’m not the only one who thinks so.”
In the end, Draco nods off during a particularly boring passage about experimental breeding on dragons. A shame, really.
“I bet you’re hungry. You are, aren’t you?” He scratched at that one spot behind her ear. “Come on, then. I’ll get you your dinner.”
“Harry, did you still have your wand on you when you left the Top Box?”
Inside is cramped and permanently filled with the sounds of animals that ranged from toads to Fire Crabs. Draco reached the counter and finds Parvati Patil standing behind it. She raised an eyebrow at the sight of him. “Back again, Malfoy?”
Without thinking, Draco shoved his hand into the air, praying to somebody up above that he wouldn't be ignored. Fortunately, both Trelawney and Umbridge turned at his movement. "Professor Umbridge, don't you think it would be better for you to see if Professor Trelawney's students could predict something for you? I mean, that would prove whether her teaching style is effective or not, yes?"
“You’ve thought that far ahead, then?” Harry said, not looking him in the eye.
“I’m Luna Lovegood,” Luna Lovegood says.
“I don’t know. I guess because you’re my friend,” Harry answers nonchalantly. “I was gonna look around the school with it. Wanna come?”
Again, the boy doesn’t say anything. He’s just beginning to run out of icebreakers when there’s a heavy thump-thump-thump at the shop’s front window. They both look over, and Draco almost falls off his stool again.
He waves. Draco gives a shy wave back. Potter starts walking over, but another boy, the redheaded Weasley that bumped into him on Monday, drags Potter to the gaggle of Gryffindors across the classroom. Draco is relieved, he’s not entirely sure what would’ve happened if the great Harry Potter sat down with Lucius Malfoy’s son. Nothing good, that’s for sure.
The hand on his cheek lifted. Draco briefly missed the contact, and then noticed a strange glint had come into Harry's green eyes. "You like boys?"
Draco breathes in once, twice, and back out. He counts to ten in his head, barely resisting the urge to punch Potter in his annoying face. The two others stand to the side of them, waiting; watching. “You must be fucking delusional, then.”
Weasley flipped him off. Harry was still worrying his bottom lip between his teeth, while Granger pulled her thick hair into a floppy bun. "Whatever, Malfoy. Let's just get out of here. Oh, and Harry, did you notice how Cho was looking at you earlier...”
Potter releases a wet laugh and tugs Draco to his chest. “Oh, my God, Malfoy! Don’t ever do that again!”
“You don’t need to lie, Draco,” Snape murmured, almost comforting. “The headmaster and I have known about you for a very long time. Since your first-year, in fact. I had no intention of ever confirming it with you, nor telling the Dark Lord about it, so I hope you forgive me for doing so, anyway. It was the only way to gain back his trust. Not even Lucius could’ve shared such important information with him.”
“Ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches. Spring. Try--” this time, Ollivander hasn’t even let Draco’s fingers curl around the blasted thing before snatching it back. “That’s not good at all! Have a go at this one, beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible, too.”
“... Oh, Merin, and then there was this idiot who wheeled in a whole group of Muggles that had been attacked by a band of doxys! It was such
Draco waited for some kind of reaction, but Potter just kept reading. He got to the last page in no time, and finally looked up. “Some of these seem really familiar, you know.”
Severus sneered. “Ever since you started hanging around Potter you’ve been acting differently. I should have put a stop to that friendship when it began.”
After dinner, the opening song started. Predictably, Harry made a fool of himself on the dance floor, and Draco took pity and dragged Luna out only a few seconds in. Other pairs followed suit.
Standing, Draco went and grabbed the cat food from the pantry. He poured the recommended amount into a yellow bowl before sliding it over to Helga, who had been lurking about an arm's length away.
Draco only ever heard complaints about Hagrid's classes, though he didn't dare say so. "Come on, or we'll get left behind."
“Yes, actually. Your mother has asked me to make sure you don’t do anything else stupid over the holidays.” He glares pointedly at Draco’s Ravenclaw tie. “So, don’t do anything stupid.”
Not even a day had passed after Harry's arrival before Draco was made to play house-elf, again. Mrs Weasley was determined to have the house as clean as it could be, which meant waking early each morning to get it all done quicker. It was dull work, and only Granger's reproachful looks were enough to stop him from summoning Kreacher to do his bit, as the elf was determined to only follow his orders— in a way that was actually helpful, that is. Eventually, morning became noon and Mrs Weasley called for a lunch break. Draco noticed Harry and Black whispering between themselves at the Black family portrait, but ignored them in favour of grabbing some sandwiches off the tray that Mrs Weasley was keeping afloat with her wand. He joined Granger and Ron, who he ate with in silence.
A harsh intake of breath has Draco glancing worriedly at his father, but the man is busy staring resolutely at a spot on the wall.
“Have you figured it out?” Granger said, ominously. Draco briefly wondered if she’d gone mad.
The rest of her speech was lost on him. It sounded like she was just repeating the same stuff, so he guessed it would be alright to zone out. It was only when Granger jabbed him in the arm that he realised the class had moved onto... staring into teacups? Somebody, probably Potter, had gotten one for Draco, as well.
Longbottom held up a plant in response. It looked to be almost pulsing. "That is absolutely—"
Harry and Granger had disappeared after Sirius a moment before, leaving him to deal with Severus and Weasley; plus a werewolf that could come back any moment. Draco licked his lips, and noticed Sev’s eyelids fluttering. “You’re alive!” he said, relieved. Who knew three disarming spells could knock someone out for so long? “You’ve got to listen to me, Black was innocent the whole time! It’s all because of Ron’s rat! Peter Pettigrew is alive, and an unregistered—”
Severus looks at him. He frowns, obviously annoyed, but still ends up murmuring, “Fine. Wait for me in my office.”
Draco has hardly woken when his three Gryffindor’s make the noisiest entrance in history. Harry leads the front, eyes worried behind those ugly classes, while Granger and Weasley arrive not too far behind. Madam Pomfrey never stood a chance.
“You just said you don’t know who he is,” says Draco. “So what does it matter if I told Severus you guys happen to know Flamel’s name?”
“It’s not like that,” he said, as they left the castle at noon. The three Gryffindor’s walked at a considerable distance ahead of them, checking over their shoulders every few minutes to make sure Draco was still with them. “I’m serious, Luna.”
Potter stepped closer. "We have time."
“Good morning!” a misty, familiar voice interrupted. Professor Trelawney seemed to have appeared from the shadows. A pair of Gryffindor girls made excited sounds. “I have decided to begin teaching you of the intricate art of crystal-gazing early. I sincerely doubt any of you will get it on your first try, but I am anxious to give you a sufficient amount of time to practice before exams!”
copy into her bag, along with her timetable that had been laid out on the table. “Fine! I give up, then! I’m leaving!”
“Cedric Diggory is going to die,” Draco said. As the words floated in between them, he found himself knowing they were truer than ever before. “And the Dark Lord is going to return, with the help of Peter Pettigrew. And Harry is— is... going to fight him. The cup is a port-key.”
They chatted about nothing important for a few hours, and soon enough the train was pulling into Hogsmeade station, where a gaggle of eleven-year-olds immediately came pouring out and into the boats that would sail them across to the castle. A gush of frosty wind had Draco huddling closer to Luna for warmth. He noticed Harry, Granger, and Weasley doing the same a short distance away.
Another tiny noise came from the step that Draco knew would often Vanish. None of the others noticed it, as Snape had started on about how somebody had broken into his office. Moody was arguing back.
He thought about it for a moment. Draco was sure he knew where this was going.
In his dreams, he stands in a room coated in dust. The windows and doors are all boarded up, while a smell like rotten meat wafts through the claustrophobic place. Up against one wall, Draco realised with alarming clarity, is Severus Snape. Opposite the professor, is a man shrouded in shadows. He steps closer for a better look, but flinches away when he gets a glimpse of the man’s face.
Draco shook his head, grinning. Their conversation was interrupted when the Sorting hat broke into song; it went on and on with warnings, and suggestions that the school would do better united than divided in these times. Draco thought he had a pretty good idea why it had decided to branch out this year, but didn't voice it, for McGonagall started calling out the names of first-years as soon as silence fell over the hall, again.
The conductor, a short witch that Draco guessed was only just of age, gave him a sickly sweet smile as he got on. “G’mornin’, I’m Jessie. Where’re we takin’ you today?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Over the next few days, Draco was tasked with cleaning out a few of the guest-rooms for when the Weasleys arrived. Professor Lupin would sometimes drop in to help— though he suspected there was an ulterior motive there, like visiting one Sirius Black— but for the most part, Draco's first week at Grimmauld Place was incredibly lonely, as Tonks was not kidding when she said the Order of the Phoenix kept her busy.
Harry arched a curious eyebrow. "What is it?"
A moment later, the trapdoor flung open, only it wasn't a student this time. Umbridge revealed her self entirely, rather ungracefully, with a clipboard and quill in her hands. The class fell silent at once. Unaffected, Umbridge said to Trelawney, "I trust you got my note about inspecting your class, today?"
“Don’t,” Potter says easily. They exited the bathroom and headed in the direction of the Hospital Wing. “I didn’t go down with the intention to battle anything. I just wanted to save my friend, so no. No, uh, thank-yous.”
The Gryffindor's did, eventually, hurry off without any more comment. Harry flashed him a quick, grateful smile before disappearing back into the dark, and Draco most definitely would not be storing it away for the future.
"I, um..." Draco looked over Moody's shoulder. "I get nightmares sometimes, and Madam Pomfrey gives me Dreamless Sleeps when I really need it."
“Oh. It’s a cloak,” Draco says, trying to sound excited. That was it?
Draco crouched down and rummaged through the mess of clothes and knick-knacks until his fingers finally caught the edge of one of the books he'd brought. It was an old, tattered version of some potions manual which the Manor's library had looked after for years; the pages were browning, and the cover was falling apart. Ignoring this, he opened it up to a random page and started reading.
Beside him, Potter smiles, nudging him. “Cool, right?”
Of course!
Granger went silent, eyes furious. Suddenly, she began to pack up her things. She shoved her
“Are you always clumsy?”
It was, truthfully, quite embarrassing what had appeared inside the crystal ball. Draco was perhaps expecting images of war, or dead bodies strewn across a field, but instead, he’d seen something even worse. He’d seen an older Hermione Granger, perhaps seventeen or eighteen, with her arms locked tightly around Ron Weasley’s neck. They’d been
"Of course," said Umbridge, smiling creepily at Trelawney. "Well then, if you could just predict something for me?"
Lowering his book, he tilts his head. The girl is somewhat soft-looking, and while Draco’s own hair was far more white, he supposes she had the potential to pass as a Malfoy in certain lighting.
“What? And you just walked off?”
She was gaping now. Draco rolled his eyes. "Oh, don't look at me like that. I got really unlucky in the family department." He tapped his chin, pretending to think. "Let's see. Aunt Bella got herself locked up in Azkaban after torturing two Aurors, Sirius killed all those Muggles, everyone is obsessed with blood purity, and don't even get me started on what Grandfather Abraxas did to one of the—"
Draco waved his wand and the blonde locks on his head pulled themselves into a loose bun. “I doubt it’ll be busy. Maybe I’ll run into Neville, he’s probably back from Hogwarts by now. I should visit if I don’t see him.”
Draco blinks. Potter’s face has turned all red like he’s the one that should be embarrassed. “You noticed all that?”
"Let's work together," explained Potter. Weasley frowned but didn't comment, swivelling around in his seat to work with Dean Thomas, instead. "I'm sure you've got some interesting dreams, then?"
He stares at the teenager who had spoken. He’s got handsome features, but the malicious emotion in his eyes ruins it. Draco’s mind, inexplicably, screams a name to connect with the boy.
"Shut up," Snape muttered, a sneer hidden under the thick front of his black hair. He narrowed his eyes at Draco. "What are you doing out of bed? And with - with him?"
He curled a hand around Luna’s wrist and tugs her toward the exit. As soon as they're gone from view, the pair run in the direction of Ravenclaw tower, giggling and yelling the entire way. Draco is sure that at that moment he’s never had a friend like her.
The carriage came to a stop, and Harry got out first, with Draco and Luna just behind. He noticed Granger and Weasley stepping out of a second coach a short way in front. All of them clamoured forward in an effort to escape the biting air quickest.
He pauses. Draco spots the familiar figure of his father approaching them, and immediately remembers what he’d come over here to do. Not bicker with Potter, but try to warn them. He glares at his feet, ashamed.
“Well, not mine specifically. He’s been in the family for ages,” he says. “I’m sorry about this by the way. I can write a letter home. My parents will be able to order Dobby to stop bothering you.”
"I'm not going in there! I thought speaking to snakes was normal!"
Black’s face stretched into a snarl. “Malfoy’s boy, is it? I should’ve known you’d get your filthy, cowardly into Harry.”
Their carriage jolted forward as Luna shut the door behind them, cutting him off. Draco swayed in his seat when they began moving down the road and passed the gates to the school grounds, which were drenched in utter darkness. The castle could be just seen up ahead, its countless windows dripping with orange candlelight. He gazed up at the flickering shadows for a while, before darting his attention back to the horses that drove them.
"What, and interrupt their date?"
Draco shrugged and settled into his sleeping bag.
Inside, Draco seated himself at the back of the room with Terry. They quickly unpacked their textbook for the year, only to get informed that they wouldn't be needing it. He groaned and placed his white head of hair onto the table. "Kill me, now."
copy. "Um. Extreme sadness? And those look a bit like glasses."
Borgin and Burkes is just the same as he remembers it to be; dusty and pulsing with a twisted type of cruelty. His imagination also seems to think he’s being watched.
The best part of Hogwarts is the library, he discovers at the end of his first day. The walls of books stretch along endlessly, a supply that surely nobody could finish in a single lifetime, which makes him giddy. A few older students lurk about, but for the most part he finds a secluded table to sit alone at. Draco is completely, perfectly alone. Brilliant.
Luna and he found an empty spot beside some third-years, who all hastily turned away when they sat down. Frowning, Draco asked, "Do I smell bad or something? Are my robes inside out?"
“Hold on.” Potter glances back and forth at them. “Vampires are real?”
Draco freezes. “Of course I know you. Everyone does.”
A beat passed. Potter hesitantly grabbed the one at the top of the pile. Draco's hands flinched to grab it from him, but he stopped himself. They were friends. He trusted Potter. Mostly.
He swore. It was immature enough to be jealous of Cho, who Harry actually fancied, let alone a stupid Weasley. The two were best friends— brothers, even. It made sense for Weasley to be the thing that Harry would miss the most. In fact, it was almost sweet, in a way. Only... Why not Draco? They were just as close, weren’t they?
it whispers.
Luna rested her cheek onto Draco’s shoulder, again. She was still half-asleep from her nap during the task. Harry looked embarrassed. “You shouldn’t’ve worried.”
It eventually takes them an hour to get out. Draco’s cheeks remain annoyingly wet the entire journey, which neither of the Gryffindor’s address (clearly they valued their lives).
"I believe it," Weasley said. "He always seems to know about things in advance. And it's a better explanation for why he knew about Crouch last year than him being a Death Eater in training."
It’s been three years now since he became a Healer for St Mungos, so Draco knew the corridors well. He reached the room number scribbled in hasty scrawl at the bottom of Edward’s files in minutes.
He attempts to pen a letter to his parents, but only gets as far as ‘Dear Mother and Father’ before giving up. After, he writes half a journal entry, feels eyes on him, and stops. During class, Draco only feels worse. Everyone else already seems to have a goal in mind with their grades, what with being Ravenclaws and all, but Draco knows that’s not why he was Sorted into their house. The hat hadn’t even mentioned his intelligence in the few seconds it was on his head. He briefly ponders what the other boys would say about that (would they call him a fake? Make him even more of an outcast?), but that train of thought just leaves him feeling quite sad. Oh, what would the proud Lucius Malfoy say about his son, now?
This leaves Draco feeling awfully uncomfortable and very alone as the remaining adults prodded at him.
Potter moved first, Draco and Granger only a step behind. They each bombarded him with questions:
Draco can admit it. He’s scared.
Madam Malkam’s face was looking rather concerned now, so he blinks out of his stupor and says, “I’m fine, sorry. My fault.”
… Clearly not.
Draco was late to his first Divination lesson. He had forgotten his books at the Ravenclaw tower and wasted about five minutes trying to answer the door's riddle. A sixth-year student had eventually taken pity and let him in. It then took another few minutes to find the stupid classroom, where it seemed everyone was waiting for his arrival. A bit embarrassing, especially after realising Luna had left a flower behind his ear during their impromptu picnic at lunch.
Draco absently flips through the first chapter, while his father starts grumbling about stupid Ravenclaw habits. “This is exactly what I was looking for! Father?”
“So,” Draco says awkwardly. “Play Quidditch at all?”
"Malfoy?" Granger said, incredulously. She lent him a hand to get up with, which Draco took gratefully. Weasley had stood up on his own, and was now brushing away dirt on his red pyjama trousers. "What are you doing here?"
“You don’t need to poke fun. I thought we were getting along rather nicely for once.”
Draco leaned down to pet her, smiling apologetically when she cried out for breakfast. “I’m sorry, Hel. You finished the box last night. I’ll go and fetch some food from Diagon Alley now, or Hannah will kill me for starving us both to death.”
“I’m. Not. Joking.”
And so it began. Draco’s eyes started stinging after staring into his crystal ball for only five minutes, and if it weren’t for Granger’s complaining, he would’ve fallen asleep.
“Defence,” he answered. “Lupin had us go over our Vampire essays. I think he was very pleased with mine.”
of growth he’d had over the summer. “No, this’ll be my second-year. What house do you--”
to them. I’m simply displeased because we’ve been forced to rid ourselves of valuable heirlooms simply because the Ministry has decided to conduct a few raids in a pathetic search for items that would most likely not do well to be found in our home. Now.” His voice becomes colder. “remember what I said-- don’t touch anything.”
work.”
“Language!” a voice chides, goodnaturedly. Draco glances over from his new spot on the floor to find a hand offered out to him. He takes it, recognising Terry Boot as the one helping him up. “You’re Draco, right?”
He raised a dubious eyebrow at that. Draco had been under the impression that if you wanted to see into the future, it was as easy as staring into a couple of crystal balls and writing down whatever showed up. It was sort of why he'd taken the class— something simple, not so complicated. Arithmancy was fun, and sort of had the same idea as Divination, only a lot more precise.
“Of course. But, do you like me or
“They’re doing it again,” Pansy said disdainfully as she plopped herself on Blaise’s lap.
Well, what’s basically gonna happen is that there’ll be two teams, like you said, of celebrity players, and each celebrity will pick a charity to play for. The winning team will get 75% of the proceeds to be split up amongst the charities chosen by that team’s players. The other 25% of the proceeds will be split up and given to the losing team’s charities.
Now that we’ve covered your to-die-for new products, we have a game we want to play with you, if that’s alright.
Yeah, that’s the one.
So you’d say that you’ve gotten over her?
Next question is from TessBarrow006: “What’s your favorite color in the new Scarlet Nights eyeshadow palette and why?” Oh, and we have the palette right here so you can point it out to us.
“Come on, Parkinson. I know what you’re doing. Trying to get Harry to trust Malfoy, go out with him, shag him, only so that Draco can go and spill all Harry’s secrets to the Prophet.”
“I predicted this, didn’t I? They’re married, they have kids,” Blaise paused to smile and wave at Lyra and Lily, Draco and Harry’s twin four year olds, seated at the kids’ table. “And they bought this big house to grow old together in.”
No, I hate vacations actually. Sunshine sure is depressing.
“Excuse me?”
Yeah, we’ve been married four years now and we just had a daughter last winter.
Harry very much doubted that, and he didn’t believe that this singular act of amity somehow proved that Malfoy was in fact a good person at heart. But he could recognize the effort.
Pansy glared sharply at Blaise. “What do you mean when you’re right?”
Yes, actually.
Moved on? To whom?
Something like that, I think. Anyway, I’ve got them and I’ve got Ginny Weasley.
Welcome. So, you’re all playing in the upcoming “Quidditch for a Cause” match, organized by Mr. Harry Potter here. Now I think we all know what “Quidditch for a Cause” is by this point, but maybe you could all go around and say what position you’re playing and what charity you’re supporting.
“Is writing poetry for Harry Potter,” Granger finished. It was clear that she was not impressed with Pansy’s explanation one bit.
Yeah, I’d say that’s more of a reflection of the uncertainties we were going through as a couple when I wrote the book. There’s been a lot of challenges in our relationship and I didn’t want to tell a love story that’s dishonest or fake in any way. I wanted it to be real. So, yeah, the end of the book isn’t happy and mushy, it’s heartbreaking.
Draco shook his head adamantly. “I am way too scared of Granger to make her upset.”
Oh, no. That’s not what I- I just meant that neither of us are pining for each other or any shit like that by this point.
“Or we could wait an hour.”
Yeah, I think this painting is one of my favorites. It’s called “The Embrace.” It’s showing, well it’s supposed to show at least, that even though the world beats us down love can still redeem us in a way.
“You go on,” Draco told Pansy, barely sparing a glance toward her outstretched hand. “I just want to check something.”
I think we’d better get inside, Ronald.
Harry sighed. He threw the Invisibility Cloak to the compartment floor and jumped down after it. He stood in front of Draco, who was looking infuriatingly smug with a little amused smirk on his face. Harry wanted to kiss it away.
Harry leaned in hesitantly. He put a hand on Draco’s cheek and Draco’s eyes fluttered shut. Harry knew his heart was going faster than a Firebolt when he closed his eyes as well and lightly pressed his lips to Draco’s. Draco made a small sound, like a whimper, or something. Harry didn’t know if that meant he should stop, so he moved to pull away, but then Draco grabbed him by the waist and pulled him closer. He let Harry deepen the kiss and made one of those little whimpers again, which Harry figured out was a good sound.
There they are again! They’re coming back down!
So is that right? You were in Morocco with them?
Oh, and now someone else in yellow-
, Draco thought. He watched Snape reach out for the Marauders Map, a dawning realisation on his face, when suddenly Moody spoke again. "Accio parchment!" The map flew from the floor, and into his calloused hands. "Ah, yes. My mistake. I must have dropped it..."
Draco almost got away with it. He hadn't run into any prefects or teachers on the way and was just approaching the first set of stairs leading to Ravenclaw tower, when he saw Professor Moody.
Potter laughs. “He hasn’t given anyone else tails, if that’s what you’re worried about,” he promises. “In fact, I was just with him before I saw you and Snape talking.”
"Easy-peasy," said Draco, not even having to think about it. The previous night, he'd woken early, images of giants fighting to the death haunting his sleep. "There were these hideous creatures— giants, but don't tell Hagrid I called them that— which were battling each other for no reason I could see."
“Alright. Sorry for wasting your time, Malfoy,” said Potter as he stepped outside. “See you around?”
Draco allows him to rub warmth back into his arms, all while keeping in time with the counting. One, two, three… seven, eight… ten… He still feels like shit, and probably looks it too, but Severus’ presence at least helped his heart rate not be so deadly. Once his vision has finally cleared, he’s mortified to realise all his roommates had watched the ordeal go down. They stand around him and Snape, varying degrees of worry painted into their faces.
"Obviously," he said, putting particular displeasure on the 'O'.
“Did you hear what happened? With Potter and his friends?”
The teacher arrives then, and Draco gets to forget all his problems for one more night. Astronomy turns out to be a fun class, as he already knows a lot of stuff. Perks of having private lessons since he learnt to walk and all that superiority rubbish. When it ends, Potter is hurried out by his friends, leaving no chance to say goodbye to Draco. Once again, he's glad for it and leaves for the trek back to his own dormitory.
A wizard with greasy hair appears behind the counter, his broad shoulders droopy and his face covered in dirt. “Ah! Mr Malfoy, what an absolute pleasure it is to see you. And you’re brought your son along, too… I hope you haven’t come here to accuse me of cursing him again, have you?”
"Shove off." He stood up, but it did little to erase the height difference. Draco had grown quite a bit over the summer, so he was finally taller than Harry (not as much as Weasley, though) yet Zabini was unfairly long. Like a noodle, or something. "And who do you think you are? Waltzing into my space and asking inappropriate thinks like, like—"
“Fulfilling my duty as your godfather,” Sirius replied easily. Draco noticed he ate in a very dog-like way. “What did you bring
A twig snapping had him tensing up, again. He squinted through the numerous trees, and heard a boy saying, "I'm okay. Tripped over a tree-root."
Harry had said Zabini had laid off them by the end of last year, but if he's back to being the school's bully— and specifically to Draco— then it would only add to the long list of problems that the Dark Lord had started... Draco licked his lips and straightened up, again. There was no point in dwelling in something that hasn't happened, yet. That went for everything else, too. Literally.
He was starting to think that the punch might've had a bit of alcohol in it, as Draco felt a little too light in his shoes. "I have to tell you something."
“Is this where you three live?”
Draco purses his lips. He’d pushed a lot of his friends away in the last few months--Vince and Greg, even Pansy-- in a last-ditch attempt to be left alone from their questions about his dreams. Pansy is dramatic about things as mundane as brushing her teeth, and both Vince and Greg would show an annoying amount of concern in their own, admittedly, unique way. His mother always tells him that he’s lucky to have such caring friends, but he couldn’t bring himself to agree. Now Draco was starting to regret it, since he no longer had any idea how to make conversation with someone his own age.
“Alright. Just this once.”
Black neither denied or confirmed it.
"Right. Well, um. Bye."
"Must be an Auror," Michael Corner whispered.
"Excuse me?"
“Alright, fine,” Draco agrees. He probably could’ve argued for longer, to keep up with appearances, but he’s curious now, about how the school decorates for Yule. “The Great Hall, you said?”
Potter laughs.
The green robes pulled over her shoulders shifted as she crossed her arms, a frown line appearing between her thick eyebrows. “Shouldn’t you be working?”
my tumblr is @milfdraco for anyone interested :V
Potter tries running away. Draco grabs onto his hand and tugs him back. "Where are you going? The Duelling Club is at the Great Hall."
She lowered her magazine, making her wide-grey eyes emerge from the top, and nodded. Harry took the seat opposite them, while Ginny and Neville sat down closer to the door. Luna watched them before saying to Draco, "How was your summer?"
Harry went even redder. “Neither do you.”
When he arrived home, his head took on the numbing emptiness that it sometimes did these days. Draco picked up Helga from where she was attempting to dig a hole in the couch and presses their foreheads together. He pretended the stinging in his eyes was from exhaustion and nothing else.
Michael Corner makes a face across from the two. Draco ignores it. “Luna, he hasn’t died.”
“Lucius.”
“You’ll likely sleep through your morning classes, because you’re having it so late.”
The story is weird. Draco instantly believes it’s true when Potter mentions Dobby, though. “That meddling elf! Oh, what my father would do if he found out…”
Luna was the one to answer after a beat of silence passed between the four. "It was a dementor. Daddy says they look after the prisoners in Azkaban. That one was probably looking for Sirius Black."
“Hold on, Hermione—” Potter started to say.
“Magical snakes?” Borgin murmurs, sounding curious as he walks around the counter and towards a shelf coated in spiderwebs. “I have a large collection of books about magical creatures, although none so specific. Maybe… ah.” The man reveals a leather-bound, thick book. The spine is covered in inky splotches that resemble birds if you squint. “This one has lots of information about reptiles. Dark ones, ‘specially.”
"Oh, it's splendid," Luna giggles. "I've already sent cards to Terry, Penelope, Ron, Pansy, and you! Although I doubt you've received it yet."
The window looked out over the Manor's gardens. As a child, he would often stick his head out as far as he could, simply to get a whiff of the roses and wet soil down below. On this evening in June, Draco has only glanced outside once, instead keeping his eyes on the bedroom door, where Severus Snape would be arriving in a little under an hour if everything goes according to plan. If it didn't... He doesn't want to think about it.
A few minutes of meaningless chatter pass between the three. Draco jumps up for the bathroom at some point to splash cool water over his face and smooth out his hair. When he comes back, Boot and Corner are ready to go downstairs for food together. They talk the whole way there. Something warm floods through his veins; he thinks it’s contentment.
“Up or down?” He asked her, gesturing to his hair. “Up, right? Or else it’ll go frizzy.”
