"Just that the ceremony didn't go well."
"I wanted the
Draco eyes the thestral foal who sucks on the blood left on Harry’s fingers.
"Not that I don't appreciate the confidence. But I'm not sure I can protect you against a cascading failure of 1800 years of magic."
Harry is super creeped out.
Which had happened often in Harry’s past. It’s normal for him. Sure, he really likes Draco now, but it would be surprising if it just happened to be mutual.
"The current ruling family? Of course. They’re in many history books. What do you want to know about them?" Hermione says promptly, her lips moving almost automatically when presented with a question.
The vibrations stop. Harry's heartbeat picks up, anticipating...
"So. You're a Prince."
I'm not allowed to move! Harry wants to yell. But that would break immersion so he bites his lips instead.
"You know me too well."
“It’s not gloating if it’s true,” Draco says very seriously. ”And I’m quite good at Quidditch. We really should have a Seeker duel some time."
Sirius's entire face scrunches up, like Harry just punched him.
Draco stays silent at that, their footsteps resonating in the empty halls.
He distinctly remembers the Prince doing this scratch at their last play session.
"You could say this is my way of testing the waters," Draco answers, an unsure smile half forming on his lips.
It has. Despite being good friends at Hogwarts, he hasn't kept up with Neville as well as with Hermione and Ron. He even sees Luna more than Neville, despite not being that close at Hogwarts, since they keep running into each other at the Four.
"... Yes? Isn't it obvious?" Draco answers, confused.
"I just want. One moment.” He lifts his pointer finger. “One peaceful moment with you, not spent arguing and worrying about the wards or Draco or any of that shite. If this is too much to ask, then I'd rather you go, so I can catch some sleep."
Lady Zabini makes a delicate little laugh behind her hand that sounds like crystal.
"The spell's been altered since then to cover quite a lot of other things. Dark creatures and dark wizards alike. Disease and famine. Muggle wars, even. Some slip through the cracks. The protection is working nevertheless. I can feel it tugging at my magic sometimes."
"So what you're saying is that I'm too ugly to have someone be just interested in me?" Harry sneers.
"So where did you hear about it?" Harry asks.
"Hey Kitty Cat," Harry whispers.
‘Well, it’s an asshole move, and I don’t want to be an asshole.”
So tempting. But not yet.
: I’ll give you the contact of a good ward mistress. But don’t get your hopes up, it’s never perfect. There's no escaping the media.
"Mendy is so very sorry Lord Potter sir! Mendy will punish herself promptly!"
They hug on the ground in a hazardous pile. It's not a happy hug, but it's warm.
for Merlin's sake. "Because you like... my... face?"
They stop talking over each other. Sirius sighs.
"Harry will..." He licks his lips. Harry can see his heartbeat on his throat. "... Use his magic to stimulate my nerves and my brain."
"She made a big speech against werewolves rights not six months ago, the last time Hermione and the Longbottom boy managed to bring up the issue to court,” Sirius continues. “She voted against Remus being able to teach, and made a big show of it. You can be sure her son voted the same."
How is it not like that? Harry doesn't really have the words for it. But thankfully he doesn't have to elaborate because Remus starts talking.
And so begins Harry's torture.
Heavy breathing better not count as sound either because he's panting.
What is this bizarre universe where Draco is the one trying to convince Harry they're together?
Harry groans and looks toward Remus to share in the embarrassment. But instead of an amusingly mortified Remus digging his elbow in Sirius's ribs, Harry finds Remus with his mouth slightly hanging, like he's seen a ghost. Confused, Harry looks back toward Draco. The awkwardness seems to have spread to him, and he looks at his toes while tapping his fingers against his arm.
"Shut up. I've spent the better part of yesterday studying those books, this morning being grilled by Lady Zabini, and now this. I'm trying to remember everything but my brain is melting."
Harry hums, and his fingers fidget against Draco's hand.
"No, why would I? I..."
"You're with me?"
"I can't say no to that voice." Harry smiles.
"About... my family."
"Finally?" Harry can't help wondering aloud.
"Didn't have the time."
"So, what does your not-boyfriend have to do with this?"
“Act calm and it’ll be fine.”
"Children are a key topic when discussing long term relationships. And this is a place where I'm not willing to compromise. I need to have at least one child."
Harry takes a moment to take in her appearance. He doesn't have a lot to compare to, besides Hogwarts elves. And he has rarely interacted with them at Hogwarts. The elf in front of him is not dissimilar. Like Hogwarts’ elves, she's wearing what looks like a napkin draped around her, and nothing else. Can't the Crown afford to clothe their staff?
Draco licks his lips, and starts talking.
"What does she have against you anyway?"
"Want me to pet you?"
"... not denying that one."
"I can take Harry—"
Sirius's spell flies right toward the Queen, but she flicks it away with a move of her wrist. A wardrobe catches the spell and explodes in splinters.
: Thanks, you too.
"Okay study time over, you two," Ron calls from the doorframe. "You put down those books before your brain liquefies right out of your ears and you come eat dinner."
"Lady Zabini," Harry guesses.
"I'll let him know," Harry says with a half-smile.
"Don't let the bag drop. Understood?"
Harry sits on the nearest worktable, his feet dangling against heavy tomes stacked under it. The Prince talked a lot about his potions, when he was still Kitten, so Harry isn't too surprised to find him here. He's impressed by the size of his collection of ingredients. His eyes wander through braids of unicorn hair, dragon scales, kraken teeth, and many more he doesn't recognize.
"It's not just you?"
"I did not hide anything! I just didn't mention it, because it. doesn't. matter. Where you came from doesn't define you, and..."
Not a friendly person, apparently. Gods, he’s so bad at those political games.
"It would be amiss of me to not have at least greeted each of the current Lords, wouldn't it? The Wizengamot has missed you, Lord Potter." Her face and tone are so amiable Harry wonders if he imagined the pause before that.
But before Harry can think of a question, the elf suddenly looks alarmed.
Draco tosses the lube at Harry, who catches it easily.
Then he flops down over Harry's lap.
That's... yeah, okay, that's an issue, but...
Kitten waits beside the bed while Harry grabs his wand to quickly perform a scourgify on it (it looks clean, but you never know). When Harry allows him with a nod, Kitten sits on the bed and scoots over. The black vinyl covering the mattress squeaks under him. Harry sits sideway on the edge of the bed. He sets down his bag and gets the toys out.
: Okay I get it you can stop the lecture.
"Okay, what the hell was that about?"
"I AM saying he has an ulterior motive!"
"I'm sorry that Draco didn't mention you. It must not have seemed important to him," Harry deadpans in response.
Harry's eyes flick toward Draco. How does he know that? He's pretty sure he's never mentioned that particular information about himself when they talked. He's not one to brag.
Draco wordlessly summons a vial from a shelf.
I know the ruling family, Harry," Sirius says, sombre. "They're rotten, the whole lot of them. The only thing they care about is power, money and their reputation in court. Anyone who comes across them gets used, then crushed and thrown away. I've escaped that shite a fuck-long time ago and I've ever been happier since." Remus gently squeezes his shoulder at that, and Sirius laces their fingers together. "You don't want to get involved with this trash, pup."
Sirius frowns. More worrying: Remus frowns too.
"Don't forget to remove these before leaving."
And then he realises he has no idea how he's supposed to proceed.
: Someone's grumpy today.
"I may. Do you think you will be available?"
"Let me translate then."
"So you've known him for a week, really," Sirius concludes.
The thought gives him an idea. Someone has to do the Reparos and the sweeping. You know people by how they treat their inferiors, right? That's the saying? So maybe what he should do is interrogate the house elves. That could give him a better idea of who Draco and his family really are.
Harry was still looking at him with that maybe-concerned face, and Draco decided to move on.
“Oh,” Harry said, relaxing a little. “I guess being in a physical form would take some getting used to, after ten months in the aether.”
Draco looked up at the ceiling, folding his hands in thought. “Did you notice anything about how they carried themselves? For instance, did a staring woman sit in a feminine way, did a staring man spread himself out in his seat? Did they slouch or sit rigidly upright? Did they fidget or move their face in any certain way? Any ticks?”
And he was sucked away from his sanctuary, the excited grin a near permanent fixture on his face.
Draco guided Harry through a basic meditation, and Harry followed his instructions intently. Draco watched him, occasionally, watched his shoulders gently rise and fall with his measured breathing, watched his thumbs absently rub the inseam of the denim on his knees. When Draco told him to open his eyes, he sighed and gave Draco a little smile, and Draco fought to keep his face neutral, to not betray the glow in his chest through his face.
“I know, you only did what you had to do. I doubt you enjoy being praised for doing what was necessary, or for surviving. But Harry, it is a bloody
to stop, even if he could.
“I think that was when you realized you couldn’t rely on adults,” Draco spoke slowly, hoping he was making sense. “You learned you’d have to fight the important battles yourself, if they were going to be fought at all. They never did take you seriously, when you told them something was terribly wrong, did they?”
, and Draco was afraid. Afraid of being too much, afraid of Harry’s view of Draco changing drastically in this moment. A frankly
Draco looked up to face his attacker, blinking through a haze of pain. But Lucius was still at the table in the middle of the room, wand resting on the surface in front of him, watching Draco intently with a somewhat anxious look on his face.
“Do you have any idea how many slavering muggle men have given me this song on a mixtape, trying to get into my knickers?” she asked, and Draco shrugged again. “Too fucking many, Draco.”
Harry suppressed the glow in his face at the thought of Draco going to all that trouble just to buy baklava from muggles for his house elf. Yes, Draco was definitely different—this was certainly not the snotty, arrogant boy Harry once knew. Nothing like his father at all.
Ron looked at him like he’d grown a second head. “The
Harry rubbed his hand over his jaw, thinking. He turned considering eyes back to Draco.
Harry didn’t respond, but the truth was written on his face, in the purse of his lips, the distress in his eyes. Draco nodded slowly.
“…Because he’s a muggle, Cissa.” Harry raised his eyebrows at her. She made more dismissive motions with dancing fingers.
“Of course, I had a bit more time to figure that out, as a teenager,” Draco continued. “You were quite busy, as I remember.” He paused for a moment, pondering how much he wanted to push. Harry kept watching him, waiting, silent as ever.
and I was the only one coming apart. I felt
“I hate this,” Draco whimpered, dragging him into a consuming kiss, locking his legs around Harry’s waist.
“Green,” Harry answered without thinking, his chest warming at the way Draco’s eyes lit up.
But of course, he didn’t have a
Well, it wouldn’t do to continue stalling.
He crouched down and managed to pry up the loose tile with his fingers. It was heavy, and made a horrible grating noise as he slid it out of the way, revealing—
“You seem to be getting along with
So he let his annoying snake body hang limp in the bird’s firm hold, and waited, wondering how long it’d take him to get back to the school from wherever this creature was taking him.

, it always had.
He watched the curls of his hair above his forehead, he watched the breath coming in and out of Harry’s straight nose. He watched Harry’s shoulders tense, barely, with the effort of moving his magic like this, he breathed the smell of rain and ozone in the air around them, until finally, Harry released his wrists, and opened his eyes.
Draco’s eyes widened in panic. He tried to hold his lips together, but it was no use. “Not a memory,” Draco panted as the truth burst through. “A dream. A fantasy.”
Draco smiled, his head tipped back, looking down his nose at his father. He knew he must look insane with the blood in his teeth. “Ron Weasley owes me five galleons,” he slurred, trying to hold back a manic giggle. Lucius glared at him, tightening his grip on his wand.
It was his best guess, at the moment. There was nothing for it. He left the study, and walked to his room to put on a proper suit.
“Where did he go?” Draco asked, furrowing his brows. Harry assumed he meant Timsy, and shrugged.
He hadn’t started taking the potions yet, hoping to recover from whatever this was first, but it was only getting worse. He didn’t know what he would do if he couldn’t finish this. He couldn’t return to England empty-handed. All of this had to be for

Though it was odd that Draco had switched to ‘the Dark Lord,’ when he was evidently perfectly fine with saying Voldemort’s name.

Harry spun in a slow circle, thinking hard. Most of these memories were his, but not all of them. He Vanished the empty vial in his hand.
Harry whispered, and the blinding, familiar stag burst forth, galloping once around the garden before trotting up to them, bowing its regal head.

Draco was vibrating a bit from the nervous feelings of all of those memories. “Sweet Circe, that was

at potions—
Harry opened his eyes, and turned reluctantly towards Draco, with an expression full of pain, regret, and wariness.
Harry stood completely still.
Draco hesitated. He knew, in his bones, that Weasley and Granger were practically Potter’s family, and have been hearing anything the other Healers had to say about his case, but he didn’t want to test his bonds right now.

Bad luck, that.
He supposed it made sense, in a way. He could already talk to snakes. The Sorting Hat had wanted him in Slytherin. And he was always sneaking about, slipping through grabby fingers, spying on Malfoy or whatever. Who, currently, was nowhere to be found.
his traitorous brain supplied.
“Then he trusts you,” Draco noted, impressed. “He wouldn’t have left if he thought I wasn’t safe.”
“Two-timing me already, Harry Potter,” he grumbled, before narrowing his eyes. “What kind of ice cream?”
It felt like an apology.
“I’ll let you listen to it, if you can help me figure out how to play it,” he offered. Pansy rolled her eyes.
No answer. Harry closed the door behind him, stepping further into the house. It felt awfully cold.
“Potter,” Draco greeted, standing from his comfy chair and shutting the notebook. Potter looked at him, meeting his eyes for a moment and giving him a quick nod, before his gaze continued its wandering journey, taking in the details of Draco’s study. Draco bristled at the scrutiny, feeling protective of his home, but he tried to rein it in. He recognized what Potter was doing, other than familiarizing himself with Draco’s study—walking to the window and looking outside before looking back, and hurriedly inspecting every corner of the room with his eyes. He was taking inventory of exits and escape routes, vulnerabilities for potential threats. He was putting his back against the wall so he could see everything, and every way in or out. Draco did the same thing in unfamiliar places. He still did it at the Manor. He never felt truly safe unless he was behind his own painstakingly-crafted wards, in his very own home.
“Knew that would cheer you up,” he said quietly. “Feel ready to get to work?”

“Specifically, Auror Weasley, lucky for you. He’s taken on a new case, just this morning. I want you to observe it.” Kramer looked pleased with himself, clasping his hands over his stomach. “Observation
who he was. He’d hated it. It certainly wasn’t helping him feel any calmer. His hands were shaking again.
Her eyes were wide and anxious, her grip firm where she held Harry’s shoulders. Harry was sweating from the effort of forcing himself to find a way around his contract, which must have been tightened recently. That, or he’d never needed to test it like this before. He could practically hear Hermione’s brain whirring behind her eyes, and begged internally that she would understand.
Draco closed his eyes, his hand subconsciously moving to his stomach, remembering the agonizing, burning feeling, mixed with the rush of euphoria and relief. He sighed, knowing he was caught.
“But I’m a skeptic, of course,” Draco said with a smirk, finally taking a sip of his tea. He frowned when he noticed the ink on his hands, snapping Harry out of his thoughts.
“So, Draco was furious at everything, after finding out that Kingsley’s been manipulating you for years,” Hermione gathered, “apparently using
Harry’s gut twisted as he followed the line of the book down Malfoy’s chest, to find long, thin, crisscrossing scars over his abdomen.
When Draco opened his eyes, Harry was watching him anxiously again. Draco gave him a tiny, reassuring smile. “Alright?”
Full prompt: vampire Malfoy, Harry falling in love with him without realizing.
“It’s not true,” Draco said gently. “I don’t know if you know that now, or not. You can have a normal life, a real love, a family, with anyone—even if they’re not a woman. Family isn’t just about blood, about getting the girl and settling down and breeding a Quidditch team of sprogs that look just like you and the wife. Family is a decision made between people, a connection, usually of blood relation, but blood isn’t the deciding factor. As long as the relationship is cherished, cultivated, held above all else… Timsy is more family, to me, than my father ever was. Because he chose to protect me, when I was in danger, even when it was against orders he’d been given. Because he decided to remain with me, when he was freed. I cherish him, and the way we care for each other, the same way I cherish my mother, and Pansy, and Camila.”
“But we have to, Harry. We need that breadcrumb—it’s not enough that we both know what it is. It has to be seen, which marks it along the path, in your mind.” He gestured toward the half-completed lightning bolt pattern on the bottom half of the chalkboard.
“The Department of Mysteries exists sort of on the

“You sound quite sure of yourself, Draco,” Lucius drawled from behind him, causing both of them to start violently. Boran backed himself even further into the corner, hugging his knees again. Draco turned his head, glaring at the blurry figure standing outside of the bars.
Narcissa snorted—actually
Draco scoffed softly. Harry’d just done that, hadn’t he?
things when he’d taken this job. But instead, he’d existed on the outskirts, just like Kramer had said all those years ago. He’d been on the outside, looking in, watching life pass him by.
The breeze ended, and Harry and Draco both swayed. He felt a disconnect now, something had changed. Harry’s mouth opened to say something, but no noise came forth. Harry’s panic was rising. The figure continued to gaze at Harry with their ever-changing features, and Draco had never seen someone so inconceivable. Were they even human?
Draco must not have liked that.
he felt like Draco was burning off every weight Harry had been carrying, engulfing him in a liberating flame until he was only himself again.
Draco turned him abruptly, pushing him back against the solid trunk of a moss-covered tree. Draco’s lips were suddenly inches from his face, and Harry stared at them for a moment before lifting his eyes to meet his intense gaze. He felt Draco’s firm grip on his shoulders again, holding him there against the tree.
Draco’s breathing was harsh outside of Harry’s head. He could hear Harry’s shaky breaths, and he could feel his left hand trembling in his lap. Almost there, almost there…

“That’s impossible,” Hermione said. “Isn’t it?” She got up and rushed to the shelves, finding
Draco nodded at her as she stepped up next to him, eyeing him with sharp, calculating dark eyes. “Granger.”
And then you’re going to sleep, and we will never speak of the number of chocolate frogs I let you have today.” Scorpius giggled with glee, and Draco bit his lip to stifle his own. Harry had told him immediately about the chocolate frogs, but Scorpius liked having his own secrets with Harry.
Harry snorted. “His hair’s too short.”
Draco concentrated more. Tired, stressed—a feeling of dull dread, and resignation. Exhaustion. Potter was seated at the bar, a number of empty lowball glasses in front of him. The pub was nearly empty, it must have been very late. The bartender was nowhere in sight.
His hair was getting long, and it was constantly in his eyes, but he didn’t trust himself to cut it. He made muggles uneasy, like this, and if he were to try to cut it magically, he couldn’t guarantee he wouldn’t accidentally slice his own head off. So, it continued to grow.
Harry snorted at this, and Draco grinned.
“I told you I would answer you honestly,” Draco reminded him again, because Harry apparently hadn’t really believed him. Hopefully he would, now. Draco had had practice in honesty, but it still felt heavier, more difficult, with Harry. More important.
Draco tried to get another look at the figure from Harry’s peripheral, but his vision was swimming, and their image was constantly shifting. There was definitely some sort of charm there. Harry continued to shake his head, apparently trying to not hear what they were saying. Meanwhile, the indecipherable figure moved closer.
Draco tried to control his dread at the invitation to tea. He knew he’d have to accept, sooner rather than later, if he didn’t want his mother bursting in and providing one of her powerful guilt trips. She still felt he belonged at the Manor, as the sole Malfoy heir. There was a lot about Draco that Narcissa didn’t understand—his career, his home, his lack of a partner (and his preference of the gender of that partner)—but he knew she loved him, anyway. He needed to see her. She was his mother, after all—he just wished he didn’t have to see her
“I’m so sorry, Draco,” she whispered shakily, and Draco squeezed her trembling hands to stop her.
“Why does the Wizarding World fall at Harry Potter’s feet?” Lucius asked, moving on quickly. He probably already knew
Harry looked up from his volume of
He needed these memories back. All of them. But how was he supposed to go about that? He seriously doubted the Department would just give them back to him, if they hadn’t yet. What was it they needed from all of those boring memories? People-watching and weather-watching and hundreds of cafes and shops and streets?
Harry met his eyes, shaking his head slowly before returning his face to the notebook.
He’d tried to summon his glasses from the bureau, and accidentally summoned the bureau.
Harry nodded, sitting forward in his chair. Draco wanted to look away from his eyes, sitting this close, but couldn’t, considering the eye contact was necessary for the work. Harry made him feel like he could do it wandlessly, if he wanted, with those bright green eyes piercing him so intently—all Draco would have to do is tip forward, just a little, and fall.
Harry brought the tip of his wand to his temple, and pulled out a memory of wandering the Manor, one long and interesting enough to give him at least two minutes. He dropped it into the mouth of the vial, surprised that his hand didn’t shake.
Draco sighed, looking down at Harry with resigned, wary eyes.
Harry beckoned to Parkinson and Timsy, once they’d been given the secret. He was glad that no one was questioning their presence anymore. He knew he shouldn’t be bringing them into danger, endangering more of Draco’s family—but he also knew what they were feeling. He wouldn’t have been able to stop them from coming to Draco’s aid, just as no one would have been able to stop

“You might have more luck with a muggle biro,” Harry mumbled, clearing his throat. Draco looked up at him.
“Tell me the truth, Draco,” he demanded, “how does Potter feel about you?”

He slipped on his Invisibility Cloak and marched right into the office of the Warden, shutting the door behind him with a hard
Draco’s jaw tensed at the slip. Instead of answering, he waved his hand around at the shelves. Ron stared at him in disbelief, then got up and started walking among the shelves, peering closely at the spines of the many books.
Draco retrieved the pouch of treats from the other side of his door, and held it out to the annoyed owl, who looked at it curiously before hopping onto Draco’s hand and gorging himself on its contents. The sight reminded Draco of how Weasley had looked at many of the school’s feasts, in the Great Hall, and he chuckled to himself.
“Because I’m tired of not living the life I want to live,” Harry answers. Draco swallows.
Harry’s musing and worrying was interrupted by the soft click of the door opening and Hermione’s gentle voice, which instantly made him suspicious.
“Seconded,” Parkinson spat. Harry ignored her, turning a stony gaze towards Narcissa.
Harry nodded, and Draco took another deep breath, lightly rubbing the Mark on his left arm.
“How long has she been… corporeal?” Draco asked, eventually. Harry paused in his vegetable chopping and looked up at him.

Harry turned to look at Ron and Hermione, in warning. He’d be blaming them entirely if this all went tits up. They were impervious to his glare, staring at Malfoy with identical stunned expressions.
Harry laughed. “‘Mione, does Malfoy
He scooped her up into his arms—she felt too light. Insubstantial.
Harry shook his head, scratched something out, wrote again.
“Well, then.” Draco clears his throat. “Happy Birthday, Harry.”
After a tense, precarious moment, everyone had stabilized with their own personal bubbles of clean air. All eyes, Kingsley’s especially, were wide with a mixture of fright and a single-minded ferocity that only preceded their most dangerous and important missions. Harry hadn’t seen that expression on Kingsley’s face since the Battle.

“Shut up,” Draco rasped, not taking his eyes off of him. “I tortured myself, and I’d do it again. Evidently, your insufferable martyrdom is rubbing off on me.” Draco smirked, but Harry’s face twisted in pain and guilt. He squeezed Draco’s hand in his own, bowing his head in defeat.
“What habit?” Draco frowned. Ron’s lips quirked in the slightest smile, not

before. “Spill. What’s the matter with you? You’re acting weirder than usual.”
He leaned over, tucked a lock of wayward blond hair behind Draco’s ear, and kissed him lightly on the temple.
“I want to say yes,” Draco sighed, “but I don’t think I would. There’s things I wish I’d done differently, but it’s so much. I wish I’d shown you kindness, but I also wish I had known how. I wish I hadn’t answered your slight with a death threat, but I also wish I wasn’t created in Lucius’ image. I have a lot of regrets, Harry, but none of them do me any good, when my mistakes have made me who I am.”
Draco poured the odd strand into the placid part-liquid-part-gas of the Pensieve and looked at Potter for confirmation. Potter tilted his chin down—Draco was getting very familiar with these barely-there gestures—and they both dipped their faces into the Pensieve.
Hermione opened her mouth to argue, still perplexed, “But Harry already told—”
Harry’s smile grew. “Cake batter,” he answered, and Draco’s eyes widened.
“You do?!” Hermione nearly leapt out of her seat, redirecting Malfoy’s attention. Malfoy cleared his throat—was he
“See you Thursday, Harry,” Draco smirked, and Harry returned it, nodding. His eyes were bright, twinkling with amusement and something like pride. Draco met his gaze for only a moment before turning away towards the front door. Ron walked him out.
“Right. I’ve been going over what the attacker has said, and done, and there’s a possibility that I’m involved in whatever little prophecy made them attack you in the first place.” Harry jerked back. That was expected, but Draco carried on.
Harry’s stomach dropped. “You mean, he was having another one of those episodes,” Harry said, “and you just sent him home? Alone?”
technically—just weirdly overcooked, but Draco ate it without complaint.
He’d flown through Fiendfyre, to keep Draco safe. He would lasso the moon, if it would make Draco happy—no matter the cost.
“If death is nothing, kill the boy…”
“Are you done? Can we get started now?”
He burst through the trees and skidded to a stop at the edge of the cliff, taking a deep breath, the bright, uninhibited sunlight landing warm on his face. The corralled winds whipped up his hair as he stared out over the magnificent fjord, all sheer, dark cliffsides and deep blue waters, brilliant sunlight and endless trees and
Draco unwrapped his arms to cradle Harry’s face in his hands. Harry was hit with his fierce gaze again, and he could see the hurt and resentment in it, still—but it looked more like protectiveness, this time.
“Everything, honestly,” Hermione replied, “but most importantly, why you seemed to be having the time of your life while Draco was healing you, until the very last day, when you came back fully healed and just as unhappy as you were before you were attacked. What happened?”
“Do you have questions for me?” Draco asked, because he needed to.
Harry was writing again. He’d used up several pages by now.
“I said,
“Timsy!” he called, setting down his food and standing as Timsy apparated in. Timsy sighed as he heard what was playing.
“Draco, I can—”
“You—” Harry bit his bottom lip, leaning in closer until his nose brushed Draco’s. “You nest in my scrunchies?”
what to do, and he just
Harry thought it over for a moment, checking that his wand was secure in his pocket, just in case, then shrugged. Draco smiled. “Come on, then.”
It was the complete opposite of the Dursley’s.
.” Draco could perhaps avoid the agonizing taste sensations with Occlumency, but he definitely couldn’t Occlude away a digestive emergency.
Then Willem talked, too, about his early life, and his lovely wife who had died too young. He talked about his brothers who had all moved to the city, and how he always felt most at home on the water, and the few other witches and wizards he had met before Harry.
It wasn’t enough, the pretending. It would never be enough. But he had Draco now, so he held him close, felt every place Draco’s body touched his, and swayed.
He furrowed his brows, trying to make sense of his turbulent thoughts. Draco continued to stare at him, a blush appearing high on his fine cheekbones, his grey eyes wide and questioning and a little terrified. He opened his mouth to speak.
It opened easily with an ominous creaking noise. Harry flicked his wand to light the lamps, and stepped inside.
” Draco laughed, catching up quickly. “Where the hell did you learn to
As soon as he finished reading, words were coming out of Draco’s mouth, beyond his control. “Because I don’t want to take any chances that you won’t believe me,” Draco heard, and yes, that was true, but the potion demanded more, so he finished with, “and because that’s how much they normally used on me, so I assumed you would want me to use that much, too.”
Draco thought, unsure if the maelstrom in his gut was of his own making, but he didn’t move. Harry’s eyes were wet, and wide with fear and guilt—the same face Draco remembered seeing above him when he was sixteen, clinging to consciousness in a puddle of blood and water. Harry’s breathing was shallow and hoarse, and his hands were gripping Draco’s shoulders tightly, as if he was afraid Draco would disappear.
“And then, she tells me that actually,
Pansy pinched her lips together. “Does it matter?”
the sofas were too small anyway—
“Back to work, then,” Draco declared, and led the way back to his study.
“Take a guess.”
But it didn’t matter. He was a Healer, and he had work to do. He took a moment in the sitting room to gather himself, breathing deeply, calming the shaking of his muscles, resetting his priorities, before he made his way back to the study, confident that the colour had subsided in his cheeks, at least, if not his lips.
Occlumency, indirectly—she’d only wanted to see him suffer, for fun, but he’d eventually learned how to keep her out. He’d never thought his godfather would do something like that—Severus certainly hadn’t been
“Almost there, Harry,” Draco murmured, his voice shaking again. “So close, I can feel it.” He heard Harry huff, and without even seeing it, Draco knew it meant something like
No one would ever believe that Malfoy was actually carrying a small, compact mirror, weaponizing the glaring sunlight and aiming it directly into Harry’s eyes from across the field. No matter where he was, Harry winced with every blinding flicker. And when Harry
Harry looked away, uncomfortable, and made a dismissive motion with his hand.
It was fast, and it was agonizingly slow.
Malfoy’s shirt was untucked and unbuttoned at the collar, under another knit jumper—forest green, today. His bright hair was pulled up into a ponytail at the back of his head, a few stubborn strands escaping to frame his face. His trousers weren’t pressed, though they fit him perfectly, and Harry knew for a fact there was a scuff mark on the toe of those smart brown Oxfords, because he’d stared at it in shock for ten minutes that morning before Malfoy finally snapped at him.
straighter, a brilliant white. It wasn’t his teeth that looked sharper, necessarily. It was his
The fire slowly died back down, the noise subsided, and Draco peeled his hands off the armrests, flexing his fingers. He chanced another look at Harry, who was simply watching him, with an unreadable look on his face. Draco watched him back, amazed that a man could still be so bloody good, having grown up like that.
Harry pressed his lips together, glaring at his friend. Ron simply stared back, waiting.
Draco shook himself, taking a deep, slow breath, then another.
"I know it is, love, but that's—we don't have time—" Harry pulled Draco to his feet and started dragging him to the door. Draco tried to dig his bare feet into the stone.
“I want to stop this interrogation, because it feels like the Aurors, again. I want to sleep off the Veritaserum. I want to drink Timsy’s hot chocolate.”
Harry was fully glaring at him now, standing from his chair, his fists clenched at his sides.
“Yes, darling.”
“Without a second thought,” Kingsley replied, with a face of stone. “I’ve changed my mind, and your recalcitrance is endangering a life. Help us remove this bond, or find somewhere else to work.”
without thinking about it. You could do it, too, quite easily, if you just stopped
“Draco.”
She was fully sobbing now, and Harry felt like a huge hand was squeezing him so tight he would surely pop. Draco’s wards were impenetrable, allowing in no one with ill intentions. Draco’s floo was only accessible to Narcissa from the Manor, as long as she called out the name of the house. Apparently, Lucius had had time to figure that out, and find a way to Draco using the path of least resistance—his own devoted wife. Typical.
“Masters will not be eating Timsy’s cooking with Masterses hands being filthy,” Timsy croaked quietly, and Draco half expected him to roll his huge eyes.
Their meditation lasted at least ten minutes, and Harry looked much more calm by the end of it. Deciding not to allow Harry any time to get nervous again, Draco slowly lifted his wand, waited for Harry’s nod and eye contact, and cast. His mind fell forward into Harry’s, and the flashes began, but slower this time.
this time?
They sat in silence for a few minutes, enjoying the chocolatey warmth of their drinks. Draco glanced at his watch. Barely ten-thirty—they were definitely becoming more efficient.
When they got back to the study, Draco decided to be proactive and ask for hot chocolates in preparation for the work. Sixth year had been a shitshow, for him, and he knew it probably would have been for Harry, too. They’d probably need the extra comfort.
Draco was obviously losing blood flow to his brain, if he was spouting nonsense like this that made Harry’s stomach flip. They’d never even liked each other, and barely tolerated each other now. Harry had probably misheard him, or something.
“Timsy,” Kingsley mumbled in what may have been a greeting, or an observation. His eyes widened in surprise, then narrowed shrewdly at Parkinson. “Aren’t you the one who—“
He spun slowly, taking it all in once again. He didn’t think he’d ever been assigned to observe something so
Draco took Harry’s left hand and placed it on his right shoulder—Harry furrowed his brows in confusion. Draco scoffed softly.
And Malfoy hadn’t seen Harry since he
Harry set the bowl on the nightstand and dropped his face into his hands.
“Why do you think your mind chose that memory specifically?”
He falls into silence again, his lips pinched.
Once they're done circling the lake Harry gets his broom out of his pocket and unshrinks it.
"If you don't have any more questions, let's get your documentation."
"Yes, Lord Harry Potter Sir. A good house with a lot of work. What else could an elf possibly need?"
"A place here..."
: Plus with the ceremony stuff I thought you might need me in an emergency.
"It's not only because of you, don't get an inflated head."
"What do you know about the Black family?"
In answer, the Prince reaches for his magic and pulls him in.
Draco makes a pleased humming sound. Harry's other hand slips over Draco's hand and caresses his back with the most gentle of strokes.
The 12th. Today is the 12th. Harry's eyes slowly turn to the clock.
"If you put it that way, of course it sounds terrible," Harry grumbles. "But you don't have the... the context. You don't know him."
“You don’t know what you’re missing. Hey, hey, be gentle. I’m human, I’m squishy,” Harry says to the baby thestral in gentle warning.
Harry nods frenetically. Ten minutes. He can do ten minutes. He doesn't know what Draco will throw at him to make it difficult, but he's certain he can make it!
"Don't worry, I will still keep everything secret," Harry says.
Harry coils Kitty white blond hair between his fingers and slowly starts to tug.
Harry's eyes follow the shape of Draco's fingers around a glass mixing rod, delicate as ever.
"What? No, pup, no! That's not... It's just that it just so happens that HE, of all people, approaches YOU, of all people, it's just UNLIKELY..."
"Harry's from 1991's class. We were technically both at Hogwarts for a year but no, we didn't know each other. A shame too. I would have loved to face him at Quidditch, but since I dropped it in seventh year to focus on my NEWTs..."
"They look new," Harry whispers, almost afraid the wind of his voice against the wounds may hurt.
Harry gives her a flat look. Lady Zabini sips her tea delicately.
Kitten understands the keyword and moans in anticipation. They didn’t discuss doing this particular activity tonight, but it’s something they’ve done a lot and Kitten always likes it, so it shouldn’t be a problem.
"Unlikely. And I have an alarm on the door."
"YOU'RE THE HEIR TO THE THRONE! You're going to marry a nice Lestrange, or Bulstrode, and if you don't calm down RIGHT NOW I'm revoking your privilege to choose! Gods, I hope the heir you father will be better than you are!"
Harry drowns his thoughts in coffee. At least he has plenty of work today: He should make a complete tour of his animals and the grounds before going into the ceremony, to be sure no potential emergency is hiding from him. He should at least check if Annabelle is recovering well from giving birth, and if her foal is healthy. With how shy that unicorn is, finding her should take the better part of the day. That should keep him busy enough to stop worrying about everything.
: As a matter of fact, I do take my parchment with me.
"Need? What for?"
"What did she say?" he asks in a carefully composed tone.
"What? No! That's not where I was going. You two are second cousins."
Harry puts his hand in Kitten's hair again. He cards his fingers through the strands. Amazingly soft, flowing like water, like silk, and in such an incredible almost white colour. Harry will never cease to marvel at his hair. He gently guides Kitten's head to rest on his lap. Kitten goes with the movement easily. The rest of his body sprawls on the bed, his robes opening like a flower.
"So. Are you ready for your reward, Kitty?"
"Okay... but what you're saying is that some people from Draco's family are douchebags. But you don't actually know him."
"Here, to help you out."
"Oh. That's good," Draco says with real relief in his voice. He kneels down next to Harry, who’s still slumped against the door, and folds his legs under him with far more grace than Harry thought possible for just sitting on the floor. "I don't blame them. I understand that Sirius's position is... difficult, to say the least."
"That's not what I meant. She was very... Do you think she could have given me wrong information on purpose?"
"Neville!" Harry interrupts.
He lets Kitten breathe while he searches for the right spots. Then, when he's sure to get the maximum effect, brings him back up to the top of ecstasy. He settles easily into a steady, pulsating rhythm. This sort of direct nerve stimulation becomes too much very quickly. They learned that the hard way. So he's gentle in his rhythm. He gives Kitten more than enough time to recover, so he can safely bring him to the highest level.
Harry looks pointedly at the Prince's back.
"Who the hell..." Harry hears Sirius grumbling as his heavy steps approach, until the door opens, revealing his puzzled face. "Why did you bother knocking, pup? It's still your home, you don't need to knock."
"You," Harry points to some guy he's seen here a couple times. He doesn't know his name, but his demeanor looks okay. "What do you think, isn't he cute?"
"I know. I'm saving the design so I can reproduce and study it later," Harry explains.
Harry bites Draco's lower lip in reply.
Draco snorts.
Draco plops down on the couch the Queen just left, visibly more relaxed as well, and drops a biscuit into his mouth.
The plug is still vibrating inside of Harry, but it isn't too strong, and he's almost used to it by now. Still, he tenses, expecting it to suddenly vibrate harder, or for Draco to flick a spell at him... But nothing happens. Draco just studies his potion, looking very focused.
The guard knocks on a door, opens it, and announces in a loud voice: "Lord Harry James Potter."
He's repeating himself, but he can't think of a better word. How different his playful kitten feels, with magic as old as time at his fingertips.
"A ritual that is NOT. DARK. Yes, I'm sure," he adds when Sirius opens his mouth. "I spent most of the past week researching it. Hermione is helping me, too. This isn't a teenage Slytherin luring me into a Hogwarish prank. Gods, grow up Sirius."
"You said things would be different."
"It hasn't torn us apart. It only made us closer," Harry objects with conviction. He holds Sirius's hand, and Sirius holds back with a vice grip.
"Mmmmh... It's been too long since I've seen you in a collar. You're definitely subbing next time."
"DON'T TOUCH HIM!" Sirius yells.
"I see. Some humans can be quite difficult to work with indeed," the Queen answers, her tone perfectly polite. But Draco's eyes smile at her words. A joke that went over Harry's head? The Queen keeps looking at him, obviously waiting for him to continue. What could he add?
"Is everything alright?"
With that, the Queen gets up, gathers her robes, and leaves the two of them alone.
Harry is totally freaking out.
"So Narcissa told me. I don't know what you're hiding, Lord Potter, and quite frankly I don't trust you. Be honest. What are you here for? What do you want?"
"With a bit of help from friends," Harry concedes. "And I'm worried. This ceremony sounds dangerous."
The Prince comes to sit in front of him, next to the Queen.
Just as Harry settles down on the couch, grumpy to have been had like a child, something suddenly pinches his nipple. He gasps, not expecting it at all.
Harry’s heart swells. It’s not often that people are concerned about scaring the creatures, instead of the other way. He takes one hand off the broom handle to squeeze Draco’s fingers reassuringly.
"Hermione. You know about the Black family?"
Everything is messed up in his head. But one thing stands out.
Draco's frame tenses for a moment before he answers. It's brief, but Harry's trained eyes catch it and he notes the information.
"Bloody hell, what's all that?" Ron exclaims as Harry dumps the books on their coffee table.
Harry looks down to see that, indeed, Draco left his cum to dry on his stomach. He feels himself colour, thinking about what an image he must paint. Spread on Draco's couch with a fucked out expression and covered in cum.
It should be simple. Draco and he are so good together. They have something. They have chemistry. Draco's status as a prince shouldn't change that. Isn't that how the love stories go? The Prince hides his identity so he can meet someone who sees him for who he really is, and can fall in love without the promise of riches and nobility. The being-a-prince thing is supposed to be what the Prince's suitors are after, not a complication! Not that Harry is a big fan of fairy tales or anything but...
"Haha... okay… I'm not freaking out. Only, ‘tis a bit strange to ask those questions when we're not even, you know, together." Harry chuckles to help make the statement more casual.
: You're welcome to come over. I'm working right now but if you don't mind me not paying much attention to you, you can just hang around I suppose.
Harry bites back a groan. Oh yeah. It's been far too long since he's had an occasion to play into that particular kink of his.
Kitten hums softly, eyes closed. Harry can almost hear him purr.
"I mean, yeah? This children talk is coming out of nowhere."
"Okay, fine!" Harry lets himself fall flat on his back. "I know I should talk to him but I'm avoiding him because I'm scared of the confrontation. Or worse, that he'll pretend to suddenly be deaf if I bring it up. Or worse, that he'll continue ranting about... urg..."
"Good to see you mate," Harry greets back. "Gotta take a pint together sometime, the four of us."
"I understand. I'm not asking you anything at the moment. Just..." Draco pauses, searching for his words. "If you do want to pursue a long term relationship with me, you know what to expect from me."
"Me too."
Harry yawns.
Buckbeak does take a bite out of him which Harry heals with a flick of his wand. The hippogriff does not seem apologetic about it at all. Asshole. The next day he gets an owl from the Ministry asking for help about a matter with the Centaurs, who for some reason don't mind too much interacting with him in comparison to any other wix. Harry finds it a bit insulting toward the Centaurs that the ministry thinks he's the go-to person for that, since he's more of a magical beast handler than anything, and Centaurs should really be classified as beings, not beasts. But if the Centaurs mind they don't speak about it. The ordeal takes him on a trek in Hogwarts’ forest for three days and he's knackered by the time he apparates back to his shack. He doesn't notice until the next morning the eagle owl sleeping next to Hedwig on her perch, a letter with a silver seal embedded in it.
"They did what they could to mitigate the disaster. It was my own fault for panicking."
"Grab my magic one last time?"
“Let’s go through it one item at a time.”
Harry's hand slips through Draco's hair to settle on his shoulder.
"I can kinda feel it in your magic, sorry," Harry apologizes. He releases Kitten's magic back to him.
"To help you perform your duty, of course."
"I hope you didn't sprain your brain on this," Draco answers as he reclines against the wall.
"First, you need to understand the importance of the bath."
At first it's all Kitten's magic. Familiar, precise, pleased to have him. But then, Harry feels it. Radiating from the Prince's spine. Something pulsing low, quiet and deep as the water. He can see the tendrils of the spell, emerging from the Prince's back like wings, anchoring him. Harry reaches for those tendrils of foreign magic and it feels like nothing he's ever felt before. It's not one magic: it's many. It's not one voice: it's a cacophony. Nature's power and wizard's alike, and something so ancient it disappears in the shadows of time.
“It is a risk worth taking. Your enemies are not looking to kill them, it sounds like. Whatever
They nodded slowly. Harry placed his plastic fork in the middle of the table, pointed his wand at it, and transfigured it into a crude stick figure. He made sure they were watching, though their eyebrows were raised in ambivalence.
Draco mounted his broom and kicked off to join him, flying laps around his house to warm up. The old forest around the house swayed in the light breeze, and the sun shone down on them generously. Its warmth suffused his clothes, which Draco appreciated. He had forgotten to put on a cloak or gloves before leaving the house, and felt uncharacteristically bad for depriving Harry of the same.

“This one is all you, Ronald,” she murmured. Ron ignored her.

Harry was begging Timsy in his head. He felt something like agreement—Timsy obviously had no need to use Occlumency to keep his own emotions at bay.
Harry smiled, shrugged. “I’m always losing stuff.”
“Come for a walk with me?” Draco asked when they were finished, as Harry stood. Harry nodded, a small, tired grin on his face.
LOL, prompt by vukovich!
which didn’t make any sense, but this was all in his head, anyway, it wasn’t supposed to.
The other two Unspeakables had fled, and those were the two the Aurors were still tracking down. Harry didn’t think those two were any real threat—they’d seemed meek and uncomfortable in the memory he’d seen. But he still wanted them dragged before the Wizengamot and thrown in Azkaban for even entertaining the
“Draco tried to tell me Unspeakables were involved, but I didn’t believe him,” he said quietly. “He asked me to check on Lucius, since Narcissa hadn’t heard from him in months, and I simply wrote the warden, and accepted the reply I received from Azkaban. I failed
“You can’t be serious,” Shacklebolt mumbled between chuckles.
Harry thought distantly, before beating it away and focusing on the task at hand. At least he was using it for something good, this time, right?
Harry gasped as the memory pushed him back out of the Pensieve.
They were about to leave the house when Willem stopped, holding up a finger and rushing back into his bedroom.
sounded from outside, much closer, causing the invisible Lucius to freeze.
“That was intentional,” Harry said. “It was a very self-serving gift.”
Harry sat still for a moment, eyes searching Draco’s expression. The morning light from the window was hitting the left side of his face, while the soft firelight danced on the other. Draco was mesmerized by the play of light on Harry’s skin.
“I need you to keep him safe,” was all the explanation he gave. They knew he wouldn’t be so concerned for Draco’s safety if it wasn’t under immediate threat. Which it was.
A few drops of rain began to fall from the thick, Unspeakable-grey clouds. Harry flinched at each one.
“It was just a
A sudden
“Huh?”

He did.
“Nosy,” Draco corrected. “Who knows what you do with that information.” He returned to his writing, filling the kitchen with that soft scritching sound. He kept glancing up at Harry, which only stoked Harry’s curiosity, prickling under his skin.
Harry leaned in the doorway and watched him, completely enamoured, hopelessly in love.
Draco paused at the door to the sitting room, once he realized Weasley hadn’t followed him. He turned back with an annoyed question on his lips, to see Weasley struck dumb by the door, left hand still held out where it had handed off his cloak. His wide eyes goggled at Draco in pure shock. Draco raised an imperious eyebrow at him. He hoped he could still manage it, in his striped pyjamas and dressing gown, with a rat’s nest of bed head.

Harry eventually deemed him not-dying, and released him, making his way back to the chair. Draco followed him, trying to rub feeling back into his face.

is assigned to the case of his arch-nemesis’ missing mother, and no one bats an eye?”
“Now, why did your subconscious mind decide that overhearing a bunch of Hufflepuffs gossiping was paramount to your development?” Draco asked, smirking, pen held above the paper. Harry snorted again, shaking his head. He twirled his pen in his fingers, staring at the fire for a bit in contemplation before finally writing—
“Kingsley approved it, Harry.”
Harry huffed another laugh at him, and picked up his sandwich again. It felt like a casual lunch between friends, the way they were laughing and joking with each other so naturally. Draco allowed himself to believe it for a second and a half, then swept the fantasy aside.
“Did you think she was your only chance at a normal life? A family?” he asked tentatively. Harry grimaced, and looked away. Draco took that as a firm yes. He thought for a moment, carefully forming the rest of his words.
Draco opened the chocolate bar and broke off a small piece. Harry was writing in his notebook, and turning it towards Draco.
He thought it might have felt wonderful, if it didn’t feel fucking awful, and if he had ever wanted such power.
He shifted immediately and groaned as he stood on creaking joints. It was always a little weird to have knees again.

the figure continued,
“Ready for another?” he asked, and Harry took another deep breath before nodding and meeting Draco’s eyes.

for this kind of humiliation.
Harry’s smile was a diminutive, tired thing, but he set down his mug and closed his eyes, beginning the meditation that would end their day.
Harry whispered his love into Draco’s sweaty skin, tried to brand it with his fingertips, poured it into Draco’s mouth. Draco held on tight, riding the wave of Harry’s devotion, and didn’t let go—not even after they came down, their bodies loose and warm and simmering with bliss. He curled up next to Harry, his lips on Harry’s shoulder, their fingers laced together, as if that could tie Harry down.
“Hm.” Draco hummed shortly, still worried. “If you’re sure…”
Just a room, but not a fun one.
“My mother,” Draco said, his tone threatening, “tells me that
“Yes, I’ll take the case. But is there some sort of deadline on this? Do I need to start
Draco tried not to scoff. Easy for him to say, he wasn’t trained to save the day himself since he was
Harry nodded. “It is.”
"Draco—I'm sorry—I thought—"
Harry gaped at the shimmering, glowing bird for ages, imagining that he could smell the sea salt, the cool eucalyptus. He pretended he could feel the sea breeze it brought on its wings, its silvery glow that of sunlit clouds, of Draco’s eyes.
he thought grimly.
Draco took it, and immediately recognized it as his own—the same handkerchief he’d given Harry at St. Mungo’s, that very first day. He huffed with a weak laugh.
“Quite serious,” Draco answered. Harry could feel the smile against his neck. He pulled Draco’s hand down, bringing it close to his face. “She never elaborated on it. Though I did make her tell me what a

“Accidentally,” Harry mumbled, “...back then.”

Harry was staring at him with wide eyes, lips parted—almost fearful. Draco frowned again.
“Stupid—Gryffindor—” she panted, rolling off of Harry as he tried desperately to draw breath. Not his finest landing, but he had Draco’s bloody
Draco realized he’d always been the one explaining the importance of Harry’s memories, out loud, and he might be expected to do it now. He could—he had plenty of ideas, his mind was working a mile a minute, but none of it was anything he wanted to say out loud. So, he waited, in what felt increasingly like a staring contest.
“Well, I’m going to find some, I’m starving. Come along, if you want,” Draco mutters, “or don’t.” He turns away and walks leisurely down the sidewalk, as if the earth isn’t shifting beneath his feet, as if he hasn’t finally broken an unending cycle of misery, one way or another. Potter will follow, and Draco will buy him falafel, and spend as much time with him as Potter will allow—or he won’t, and Draco won’t put himself through this shit again. He will stay home on Friday nights, and ignore Pansy’s complaints, and not think about the twats Potter goes home with.
“Mum! Can
“Alright, I’ll get it. Head on over to the sunroom.”
“...but the scar was yours, before it was theirs,” Draco mumbled, frowning, pieces clicking together in his own mind. “And when it became a symbol of the Boy Who Lived, followed by the Chosen One, followed by the Saviour… you still took up the mantle, each time, even when it was thrust upon you. Because you had to—that’s just
“You done nothing wrong,” Draco slurred. “‘S’that what happened? You’re a Seer, he took you for it?”
Draco raises an eyebrow at him, but Harry’s watching his elegant fingers curl into the skin of a clementine, peeling it back in neat swathes. He looks radiant, luminescent, in the beam of evening sun through the small kitchen window, reflecting white-gold off his long hair, illuminating the almost-imperceptible bursts of mist from between Draco’s fingers. He looks like magic, Harry thinks.
“You can’t honestly believe that you’re the only one who can change the world, the only one with that kind of power, that you
Harry opened his eyes, quirked his lips, and nodded once at Draco. Draco raised his wand.
“Sixth year,” Draco continued quietly, “How many times did you try to tell the staff that something was happening with me, that I needed to be stopped?”
“I’ll hang back,” Hermione said, “I’ve seen them all already.” She darted a glance at Harry. “Harry has too, obviously.”
“No, because energy can’t be destroyed,” Hermione answered. Her gaze fell on the book Draco had abandoned. “One of the major laws of thermodynamics.”
He wondered if that was how Harry was so brave—being horribly afraid, and just doing it anyway.
“And me,” Malfoy tacked on to the end of Ron’s sentence. “You’re going to have to trust
Ron looked frantic.
“Let’s get you home,” Harry said, standing and pulling Draco up with him. Draco huffed, but didn’t protest, and let Harry lead him out of his own childhood home, out to the imposing front gates to apparate.
“There a difference?”
A figure sat a couple seats down from him, and was speaking to him, but in this intoxicated state, it was almost impossible to make out any words. He couldn’t even tell the gender of the speaker, could not discern anything about their looks at all. It must have been some sort of Notice-Me-Not, but not one Draco had ever seen. He concentrated harder on the words.
“I think I want to be a wandmaker,” Harry told him one day, sitting across from him at another cafe. Draco looked up, blinking as he came back to reality. He smiled softly.

“I’m sorry you had to see that,” he mumbled. Harry did nothing—simply watched him with that knowing, expectant gaze, and waited.
“Who’s that he’s got?”
“Not a chance.”
Long grasses were shooting up from the thawed earth, everywhere but the simple rock path that led to the door. Harry could see the sprouts of wildflowers and narcissus and even tulips around the corner, and buds promising colourful blooms on flowering shrubs and trees.

if he hadn’t been able to see and feel him breathing and shivering. He cast several more warming charms, making Malfoy shiver again. He placed his hands tentatively over Malfoy’s frozen ones, trying to warm them.
“I did take the full vial,” he explained in a low, placating tone. “And we did get started on the breadcrumbs the same day. But I wasn’t, erm… compromised.” He could feel the hint of a blush creeping up his neck, remembering the flood of warmth and Harry’s magic in his veins—
“No, it’s easier to read it when I remember it. I know what the words are.”
Harry, incomprehensibly, looked a bit resigned, and defeated. Draco felt like he was missing something, but Ron only shrugged, and looked back at Draco, gesturing toward the Pensieve. Draco took a deep breath, and they both plunged their faces in. They landed with a swirl of colour in the muggle pub, next to the bar.
He hid it away, locked it up, and returned his wand to his temple, pulling out all the rest.
Draco walked with Harry across the lawn, towards the shed, talking at him about the magnolia tree and the garden and Timsy’s horticultural quirks. Harry just listened intently, nodding sometimes, tilting his head to the side when he questioned something, pointing out things he wanted Draco to talk about. Surprisingly, it felt like a conversation, even though Harry wasn’t able to fully contribute. Draco found himself wishing he was able to. He wanted to know what Harry liked about the place, what his own home looked like, when the last time he went flying was, what he had for breakfast. Draco was content with their dynamic, for now, but couldn’t wait for them to finally free Harry’s voice, so he could actually speak to Draco, like Draco was speaking to him now.
and every time, you leave me depleted. I’m cutting you off.”
“A free elf, ‘Mione,” Ron said quickly, hands up in surrender, because her mouth had opened for a fiery debate, “trust me on that. I’ve met him.”
When they both felt calmer, Draco raised his wand. “Ready?”
Harry snapped his fingers to get his attention. Draco looked up and met Harry’s sharp glare. Harry shook his head, and grabbed his notebook to write.
Draco?”
“He decided to act on that prophecy, remember? He set it in motion, he’s making it come true. You remember it, yeah?” Draco’s voice was low and hushed, and he kept his eyes on the boy’s face, willing him to understand, to take Draco’s reassurance. Boran nodded faintly.
He quickly left the study and jogged back to the sitting room, kneeling in front of the fire. He needed to call—who? He needed to call
Harry.” Draco took another step forward. Harry stepped back, and hit the wall. “You got yourself struck by
Full prompt: either "birthdays" or "rescue". To which I said: both, yes, both
“Yes. You’re right. Fuck it, I’ll fight them off myself if I have to.”
Draco let out a choked sob, feeling dizzy, cold, much too lightheaded. His breathing was too fast, too much, and his vision was darkening at the edges. He could hear Pansy speaking soothingly to Boran, who was crying with relief. He raised his clammy hand to hold Harry’s against his face.
“You think you’re so sneaky, Potter,” he said, making Harry laugh sheepishly. “You’re that desperate to know what I’m writing?”
As he watched, Harry began his task of focusing on each breadcrumb, and Draco saw miniscule flashes of silver light among the web. He focused on the whole, trying to memorize the image, to recognize a pattern in the bigger picture. Harry’s breadcrumbs flashed intermittently.
“Also it’s rather strange,” Draco said. “A bit too much, even—even for you.” His voice was smaller than he intended, and Harry ducked his head around until he met Draco’s gaze. He was smiling softly, his eyes bright with naked adoration, and Draco’s anxiety unraveled infinitesimally at the sight of his husband’s dear face.
“Yes, he was Obliviated, but…” Draco furrowed his brows. This was the weird part. “He wasn’t Obliviated very
“So they knew, then?” Draco crossed his arms again. “You told them she was around me?”
Harry unrolled the scroll carefully, noticing a large black stain and a puncture in the middle of the parchment. A small letter fell out of it; Harry bent to pick it up, deciding to read that first.
“You’re wonderful,” Harry answered. Draco rolled his eyes again, and Harry was painfully endeared by the blush on his cheeks. A few flyaway hairs had escaped his top knot, curling slightly from the steam.
Potter,” he growled. “Because I
Teddy spoke a mile a minute, practically bouncing with excitement, and Draco had the sudden urge to go out and buy him a broom, right then and there. He quelled it quickly. Andromeda was right, of course, eight was much too young for a real broom. But Teddy’s energy was infectious, and Draco wanted to fuel his happiness.
Draco was frowning now, especially because this song was good, too. Why couldn’t Harry have had horrible taste? Why couldn’t he have given Draco a mixtape of his favourite bullfrog choir show tunes, or something?
He froze at the sight of Harry, who had frozen in return at the sight of
“Harry wasn’t exactly
Draco laid his wand on the side table, and rubbed his thighs with his now-free hand, felt the Mark on his left forearm, traced the scar inside his collar. He felt his own breath moving in and out of his lungs, his own adrenaline slowly funneling out of his body, leaving cold sweat in its wake. His Occlumency barriers came down slowly—he still felt too much.
Harry burst out laughing again. “You can just say she’s out of my league, Willem,” he snickered. “But no, it’s not like that. We’re not even friends, I don’t think.”
He saw Draco’s wand, first, followed by a pale hand, then his arm, covered in the sleeve of a blue jumper. Draco turned into the room, aiming the wand at Harry instead, piercing him with fierce, fearful, familiar grey eyes.
“Harry,” Draco repeated, firmly gripping Harry’s shoulders, forcing him to make eye contact. “What is it?”
“Seventh year,” Draco sighed as they settled into the wingback chairs. “You feel ready for it?”
He let the memories come, keeping an eye out for that silvery glow.
Harry wanted to lock Draco up, he wanted to hide him away until this mess was sorted. Which he had no right to do. But keeping Draco safe was definitely a higher priority than making him happy, which was a higher priority than kissing him. Keeping Draco safe was more important than Draco
“I suppose I am
“It hurts, Harry,” he whispered.
“Well, start writing,” Draco snapped.
It was Draco’s turn to look shocked. Muggles loved a metaphor, apparently. Ron turned his face towards Draco.
Sweet Merlin, Draco hoped that Harry focused on something else this year, even though he knew, from experience, he probably wouldn’t. There really was no way to prepare for seeing the worst of himself through someone else’s eyes. Meditation and Occlumency could only do so much.
Harry groaned and rolled his eyes. “No, we don’t,
Draco nodded, still tetchy. “What else would it mean?”
Draco raised his eyebrows. He hadn’t thought of that.
He still hoped.
“We’ll be alright,” he soothed quietly. “I forgave you a long time ago, you know—and I did deserve it.”
Knockturn Alley was still unpleasant, but Harry’s Invisibility Cloak made it tolerable.
Draco tried to rein in the sorrow and shame. “I did, as a child.”
The broom clattered to the floor as Draco stood suddenly,
She made a sound of effort, pulling away from him, but he held on tight.
“No.”
“Your powers of observation continue to delight and astound.”
“That
Draco tilted his head to the side, thinking. “No,” he decided. “When they cursed you, they technically
Draco’s shadow covered the light again, and the door swung open to reveal him, lean and ruffled and maddeningly beautiful. Draco looked exhausted, agitated, almost frenzied, his hand clenched on the doorknob like it was the only thing tethering him to the earth. His eyes landed directly on Harry’s own.
Harry skimmed down the page, his stomach dropping further with each line.
“Everything,” Draco continued with a shrug. “She’s nothing if not curious.”
“Well, we kind of… fought,” Harry said lamely, eyes darting to the side.

Weasley looked chastised, Granger looked intrigued, and Potter looked… still cagey. It made Draco feel like he was cornering a wild animal, treading carefully, desperate not to spook or anger it.
there. All I want is for you to be happy. If that means nearly punching Robards in the face then…” Draco grinned, knowing Harry could feel it on his skin. “Honestly, good for you. That man is a fucking nightmare.”
“Very well. As I’m sure you’re aware, you’re in perfect health, physically. Your larynx is intact, nothing is inflamed, there’s no curse residue, there’s not even a hint of Dark Magic on you, your magical core looks fine. This means that whatever’s wrong with you is entirely in your mind, which is why Weasley was about to kick down my door at five thirty in the morning. Just because it’s happening inside your head, doesn’t mean it’s not
Kitten shivers under his touch.
Hermione transitions flawlessly to teaching Harry what she learned about the wards during the week. Surrounded by the help from his friends, head full of information and belly full of cookies, Harry's sure he'll be able to put aside this discovery and avoid the crisis.
Draco smiles fondly.
Harry turns toward Ron and Hermione and quickly summarises what he has discovered. All during his talk, Neville stays silent and picks nervously at his fingernails.
"So you won't talk? Very well." Lady Zabini marks a pause, sips her tea. "Then listen instead. I have decades of experience handling this ceremony with Narcissa. If there's nothing more I can do, then I'll do my best to teach you everything I know. So that when the day comes, the ceremony runs with as few disasters as possible."
"Yes. It's in three weeks."
"Now, Kitty. Why don't you tell our audience what I'm about to do to you? So they understand exactly why you will yell to the heavens?"
"At least, I thought there was..." Draco frowns.
Later, when he finally stands up and approaches, Harry is whimpering, three fingers deep into himself.
"Harry and I are good friends," Draco adds. Is 'good friends' a euphemism or what? "He's helping me with a state matter."
"I wonder if my parents know this," Ron wonders.
He lets out a small relieved breath.
"What do you want?" Harry asks directly, not in the mood for games.
"STUPEFY!"
"Come here."
"... Can I talk to a house elf? Please?" he whispers hesitantly.
If they have children, they'll be queens and kings. If they marry, it will be all over the media, and they'll get congratulatory cards from foreign royalty. Harry's name will appear in History books. Draco Lucius Malfoy, some-number-th King of the United Kingdom. Married to Lord Harry Potter and father of King blah blah blah...
"I'm recasting muggle repellent charms around the loch. It’s a pretty walk."
"Are we in the palace?" Harry whispers.
"Pleaaaase!" Kitten's cheeks are streaked with tears.
"You're such a barbarian."
version sounds like!" Sirius barks.
They fall into a companionable silence after that, drinking tea and lacing fingers. Then they chat quietly. Harry vents about his latest trouble with his hippogriffs. Kitten complains about a particularly inept coworker he had to suffer. They feed each other scones and all is well in the world.
"Then Draco is a wuss!" Sirius spits.
The Prince sighs in relief.
Harry crosses his arms, uncomfortable.
Okay, what the hell?
"Please don't do that again, okay? Hitting yourself like that. It's not healthy."
. But it wouldn't be safe, not at all. Having direct control over Kitten's magic is a delicious power. And like all power, it can destroy much more easily than it can create.
The guy points to himself to be sure. He seems to not have expected to be singled out and is grasping for ideas for a few seconds.
Past-Sirius starts rummaging through the many cabinets, bookshelves, cupboards, wardrobes, desk drawers and many more in the cavernous room. This single room is bigger than Harry's childhood home. Most of it is shrouded in darkness, but the clouds move, and the light falls on the walls, the elaborate moulding, the hardwood floors...
