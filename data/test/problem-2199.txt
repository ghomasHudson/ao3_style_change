"Ms. Malfoy, I don't know who you think you are." She began but faltered as Asteria stepped up close to her.
"I need some robes," She pulled out a piece of parchment, holding everyone's sizes, from Fred and George, down to Ginny, it even included her own. "I need at least four sets of each size, eight for the size at the top, they are twins." And handed the note to Malkin's who nodded, and went instantly to work. It took the witch 20 minutes to return with shrunken boxes, tied with ropes, and stacked, which Tonks book in the bag with the books and other things.
"I do not, but Mr. Potter and Mr. Ronald Weasley do know. So head on in, you can operate from here, my dear. They'll need your leveled head." He finished officially waving her off. She gave a simple flick of her wand, appearing on the front step, and slipped through the door, she rushing into the kitchen just to see Sirius handing out mugs of Butterbeer to everyone, who sat in chairs around the table. Fred and George seemed angry, and Ron just held Ginny's hand, and Potter was staring at his hands. Sirius noticed her entrance and paused.
"If you use the attic, giving you a more direct opening, your signal should go further. If and only if, you use a larger magic connecter, something Goblin-made, or," Draco paused, waving his wand and summoning something from his things at his sisters, handing it over. The box was black velvet, and Draco's long fingers pried it open, revealing a shining silver dagger, with a snake handle.
"That's enough, Lucius. You want a bloody prophecy, here." Asteria held her own out, and Lucius barely glanced at it as he grabbed it.
Umbridge would regret doing this, she would regret causing Potter more pain. Asteria had many ways to damage this teacher, but she had to do so in a way that it didn't reflect directly on her, she let out an aggravated sound in the back of her throat, and retreated towards the Head Common rooms, she slipped inside and went into her room, discretely going to trunk and shoving her parchment from earlier inside, and shutting. She leaned back against the bedpost and let out a breath of air and let her eyes wander shut.
"Don't apologize, Harry. We have plenty of space. And after everyone is healed up, we have other safe houses we can send them to." Bill replied, and let them inside.
Asteria had to grip her leg to stop from racing out there and grab Potter. But she watched as the creature began to lecture the hood figures, ripping masks from them, one of which was her very own father, as he hit the ground, and seemed to be blubbering, which made her physically ill. She watched as Potter shouted, and suddenly, things took a turn. Potter was released from his spot on the grave, and grabbed his wand, pointing it at the creature, and he suddenly took cover. He was trying to catch his breath, from what Asteria could see, she inched out, wand ready, still hiding in the shadows. She took a deep breath, prepared to fight as Potter stepped out and took his stance, ready. And she felt a surge of pride for the young boy, and they flicked their wands, and their spells hit, connecting a link, and Asteria jumped out of the shadows, sending various jinx's and curses flying, as a ball formed around Potter and the creature, she kept close to him as she took a hex to the thigh, and waist, before sending even harder spells out, when Potter jerked away, and grabbed her arm.
"Oh, hello Draco." She smiled at him, and even covered in grim, she seemed to shine. "The other should be here momentarily."
Asteria grabbed her cloak, and put her wand into the side of her boots, and tossed her hood on, to hide her face. She followed her cousin out the door and apparated directly outside of the Leaky Cauldron. Asteria refocused her hood, and walked directly towards Flourish and Blotts, the haul would be big and pricey, but she didn't mind, although Molly would be furious, when she realizes that Asteria slipped out before checking with her, for money. Asteria intended to buy everything; firstly, because the Weasley's deserved it, and two, they had enough to deal with. She had enough money to afford all the books 500 times over, so it wouldn't hurt her. She had learned a few months with the Weasley's, that they were a proud bunch, and they were incredibly caring. Asteria walked towards the desk, and the bookkeeper's eyes widened at her face.
"Come on, Harry. Let's go inside." Draco whispered, against Harry's head, where he softly nodded, and they both stood. Draco dropped an arm around Harry's thin waist and they walked up to the cabin, where Bill stood against the door.
"Lucius was never meant to be a father, Draco. He doesn't hate you, he hates everything." Asteria responded, kneeling in front of Draco.
By 5 pm, she had 40 feet worth of essays to write for most of her classes. Nevermore thankful that Moody, Sprout, and Binns didn't seem to hand out any homework, much like Draco had told her. But McGonagall, Snape, and Vector had no problem handing out requirements for the long essay's all three had to be at least 10 feet, and the others had been shorter, but still requirements. She silently grumbled under breath as she headed to the library to begin her homework, refusing to listen to the Slytherin house and their various rants about the day. At least the library would be quite enough for her to concentrate.
"I love you, Asteria." He responded and she leaned up, attaching their lips in a fevered kiss. He squeezed her tightly as he devoured her mouth. He leaned her back, laying her on the cloak in the sand. She gripped his hair tightly, letting him settle between her legs, as she pulled her mouth away for a breath, his lips traveled down her neck, alternating being kissing and sucking on the pale skin. Causing her to moan softly into the night.
"Yes, during the First Task, the dragon was distracted by the noise, and the people distracted by the dragon. It isn't an invisibility charm." She explained, and step to the side for Potter.
"I don't think Ron and Hermione should go with me," Harry replied, looking directly at Draco. "I should go alone and not put anyone else at risk."
"All he ever tried to do was help and now he's gone." Harry cried against Draco's skin. Draco glanced from the direction from where Harry had come and could see the prone body of his old house elf. Draco had always liked Dobby and he sighed squeezing Harry as he quietly sobbed. There was nothing Draco could offer or do, except hold his boyfriend tightly, rubbing his back.
"I should've expected, being a dragon tamer and all that." Asteria responded, leaning against a wall by the Great Hall. "But that doesn't explain, why you are still here."
"What? It's a bit obvious, honestly." She shrugged, "He, first, wasn't anywhere in the graveyard tonight, and the look on his face, makes it a bit clear, he'd only kill to protect Potter." She finished and earned a grin from Potter and Dumbledore.
"Potter!" Asteria called out but was forced back as her mother held onto her, too many people, too much noise. "Let go of me, Mother!" She shouted, releasing herself from her grasp, and she grabbed her wand, taking off after Potter. She nearly caught up, but paused, slipping into the shadows. She watched Moody drag Potter up the corridor, when someone grabbed her arm, she jerked around, wand ready and was shocked to see Charlie.
"Sorry, I'm late, Molly." She said, side-stepping the witch and going into the kitchen, "I believe I got everything. She reached into the bag and pulled out the robes, bring them to size, and passing them out to each person, keeping hers next to her. "Madam Malkin's wanted me to say hello, and hopes you are doing well. She missed you this year." Asteria supplied, reaching in and grabbing the stacks of books, and passing the appropriate stacks to everyone, placing her's on her box of robes, and followed suit with the ingredients, and paused, letting out a breath.
"I cannot allow you to manhandle my students, Dolores," Dumbledore spoke, and for the first time since she walked into the office, he seemed angry, and that was even more powerful than anything she had ever seen.
"Yes, well." Fudge spoke up, giving Umbridge a particular look, "Potter still broke the decree by holding a meeting tonight. He must be punished."
"All these people dead, life's over. Because Voldemort believed I'd be his undoing because he made it so." Harry continued and finally looked at her. She saw it in his eyes, he knew. "You know, don't you? What I have to do?"
"I'm Asteria Malfoy, and I know all your dirty little secrets, Dolores. So I suggest you keep that in mind before you make your next move." Asteria whispered, giving her darkest, meanest smirk. "Because you should know, half-bloods who pretend to be purebloods, don't last long." She finished, before shouldering past the plump witch, who wore a shocked expression across her face and Asteria walked back to the library, giving a nod to Madam Prince, before entering the Restricted Section.
"Cleared of all charges!" Asteria shouted softly, and Sirius, Remus, Tonks, and the Weasley twins clapped and cheered softly. Potter laughed and was engulfed into a hug by Molly as Sirius pulled her away from the celebration.
"Bullocks. Every time something doesn't go as planned, you cut and run. You did it in our fourth year when Harry needed you, and you've done it again, abandoning both Harry and Hermione." Draco spoke, stepping closer. "Now, you sit here, acting like someone we should all pity, but that's not how this works."
"There are men in clocks out there?" Draco whispered, darting away from the tent flap, Asteria stood, and glanced outside, noting the black clocks and skeletal masks and felt a deep surge of anger, and she walked back, tossing an arm over Draco's shoulders.
It had been a week since the battle and Asteria was standing at the Ministry, watching Harry recount his story in the Forbidden Forest, requesting that her mother be cleared of all charges. She had assisted them in the Manor during their hunt, she had full-on lied to Voldemort about Harry being dead, and had protected him. She'd been shocked slightly when Harry had told her and Draco the story. But unlike her younger brother, she didn't know if she could hold out on hope. She sat in front of the entire Wizenagot, and watched Harry go over in explicit details, what happened in the forest, she flinched as he recounted the Killing Curse, his time in the space between, and how he came too, with Narcissa hunched over him, asking if her children lived. Kingsley sat at the head of the others, listening to the proceedings, as Asteria gripped her brother's hands. Harry stepped down, and returned to his seat beside Draco, wrapping an arm around his shoulders.
"Potter, what're you doing back here?" She asked, and he looked at her, confusion and fear to play on his features. Before he had a chance to answer, shouting came and it grew louder as Dumbledore, Snape, McGonagall, Karkaroff, and the Beauxbatron headmistress came barging in.
"HAVE YOU LOST YOUR BLOODY MINDS?!" She shouted, protecting both Hagrid and McGonagall, facing the officials and Umbridge.
"Go on. I'll be good." She replied, and stepped back the way she came, as Potter send red sparks flying, alerting everyone to Krum. She nodded and took off, and within moments, came stumbling up to what looked like a dementor, and she froze, wand raised. But as she watched it, and realized her assumption was wrong. Raising her wand.
Finally catching her breath, pain subsiding, Asteria stood, and laid on her bed, staring at the ceiling, they were leaving tomorrow for Hogwarts, and she felt every bit of the upcoming worry. Her eyes fluttered shut, as sleep began to take her.
"Ernie lives out in Willow's Creek. He's got a decent-sized place out in the woods out there. His wards are impressive." Ernie said as he turned the bus sharply.
"Yes, he keeps his wand is in the hilt of it. It's suppose to make him seem sophisticated, just makes him look like a prat." Asteria waved her hand about.
Asteria pulled his shirt off baring his freckled, pale skin to the moonlight and herself. Her fingers clutched at his shoulders when he ground himself between her legs. He leaned up and pulled her shirt off, revealing her pale skin and black bra, and he instantly kissed her skin. She moaned against, as her fingers fumbled with his belt buckle and button. He gave a wave of his wand, and both their pants vanished, as he positioned his erection between her legs, and pushed inside. She whimpered and moaned, as he groaned into her neck, before moving to kiss her hard.
"You telling me you don't look up to your father?" She asked, and paused, "Or the stories you know of your father?"
"I suggest you behave in Umbridge's class, as best you can, Ms. Black. But if you must retaliate, don't get caught, you understand?" Her eyes widened at his statement, and she nearly laughed, but nodded, and watched as he sulked away. Encouragement on retaliation against a teacher was shocking, which meant that in one night, she had already gotten on Snape's nerves. She passed the papers down the table and took in her schedule and fully understood him now.
She was shocked slightly when a few people walked into the room, it was early. She quickly pulled out her wand, summoning a piece of parchment, and wrote a quick note and vanishing it with a silent flick of her wand, sending it to Arthur, before settling back in her crouched position, wand tucked into the side of her boot, easy to access, but not immediately in her hand. She was stressed out when the rest of the court witches and wizards came through, and a few followed, opening a backdoor, letting a hoard of Dementors in, and a plump witch flicked her wand and a cat appeared, corralling the creatures to the ceiling. When Fudge came into the room, and Asteria resisted the urge to strangle the stupid little man. His constant need to undermine Dumbledore and her, he had successfully killed all hope that anyone would believe the claim of Voldemort's return, and leaving people for the taking, once the Dark Wizard decided to act.
"Pomphrey said that you let out a large burst of uncontrollable magic and that you might be out for some time, until your magic replenished itself," Draco added, with a shrug.
"Tell Voldemort I said hello." Draco grinned darkly and apparated on the spot, landing precariously on the floor of his sister's home, vomit in his throat at his own actions. He had resorted to dark methods to achieve his goals, which in some sense reaffirmed everyone's beliefs of Slytherins that they just always go bad. Because he knew he'd do it again. Part of him relished the thought of leveling the playing field of Death Eaters by handling them without killing them, but another part hated what he had done to another human being.
"Then, we will get along just fine, O'Conner." She finished, dropping back against the cushion. The rest of the train ride was silent, and she barely noticed when he left to change, but she noticed enough to change her clothes, and prep for leaving the train. The jarring stop, made her stand up and step out and begin her job of ushering students in different directions. She gave a nod to the Twins as they flanked Potter, and she continued on. The ride to the castle itself was slow, but once there she ushered students in and took a seat at the front of the table and nearly choked on her own breath when she saw the plump witch from the Ministry sitting next to Snape, and her eyes immediately sought out Potter's and he looked concerned. Asteria glanced back and made eye contact with the woman, and instantly felt her insides freeze, she fully acknowledged how hard this year was going to be with this woman here. Not only had she insulted the plump witch, but she had outright mocked and insulted the Minister.
"It hurts! Oh, Gods, it hurts. Make it stop, I'm begging you make it stop!" Asteria cried out, her hands gripping the arms around her stomach. "I can't make it stop!" She sobbed, her body shaking, her eyes staring up at the sky. "Alice, I'm so sorry." She leaned forward and cried out. But his hands never released her, and another set grabbed her face and saddened green eyes looked at her.
"I need the password to the Prefect bathroom, don't ask questions, just give it to me." Asteria asked, giving him her best smile and he sighed.
Draco's coat covered the body in his arms, but she could clearly make out the look of anguish on his face as he walked right past her to the Weasley's and laid the body down at Molly's feet. And suddenly Asteria knew, with perfect clarity that war had drenched the blood on the Weasley clan, and she looked at George, as she knew he knew, the tears were flowing freely, his hand on his chest as it clenched and unclenched, before he dropped to the ground when Draco moved, who then put a hand on Ron's shoulder. George started sobbing, as he pulled back the coat, revealing the face of Fred Weasley, the ghost of a smile still on his face.
"I do understand." She whispered, pulling him close to her, "You don't have to say it, just always remember that I love you." She kissed his forehead, and let him cry into her chest.
"I found no evidence he had been involved." Draco replied, "Stan Shunpike was who had originally taken Asteria, he, however, died over the summer, and Rowle had taken over the position. From what I gathered from Rowle's memories. She never really spoke, she didn't make any noises during her entire confinement. He was running out of ideas on how to get answers out of her. Rowle had decided that if he couldn't get her to talk, he would call on You-Know-Who to perform Legilimency on her, but Rowle couldn't get into her head."
"There are wards placed in the necklace that will help protect you from your father." Alice's voice lost its teasing manner, and took a more serious tone, as did her face. "How bad was it when you returned?" She asked, and Asteria leaned back and let out a breath.
"I'm sure he did, probably to keep me safe from dangerous Slytherin's, but this just looks worse." She sighed, folding the parchment, and left the room and headed downstairs, she was heading to Diagon Ally to buy books for everyone, a suggestion made by Remus to keep Potter safe, and she agreed, even to her needing a guard, at Potter's request. So Tonks stood near the door, her face morphed just enough so no one would know the Auror was associating with her. Which didn't bother her, simply because she enjoyed her cousin's company?
"Wait, you're Malfoy's sister from the Cup." One of the red heads answered, and Asteria looked at them, that's right.
"Possibly, but I do not know where it is." Yaxley coughed again, and Draco sighed, before pulling another vial out of his pocket and grabbing Yaxley's chin forcing the mouth open to pour the liquid in.
With all the surrounding darkness, it was hard to imagine being freed from it, or what it was like to be free, to feel safe. It was beginning to be hard to focus on what life was like outside of the darkened room. She hadn't eaten in who knows how long, or had anything to drink, hadn't really slept. She just wanted her bed, her brother, Harry, and Charlie. She wanted to be hugged by Molly and joke with Arthur. She wanted to laugh with the Twins and let Granger grill her about potions. She wanted to fly a broom with Ginny and make faces behind Bill's back with Ron. But most of all, she wanted her mother, to hold her, to tell it was going to be okay, that she was still proud of her. She wanted Alice to braid her hair, and talk about boys. She wanted Sirius to joke with her and tell her stories of Remus. She wanted to listen to Tonks talk about Remus with the same light in her voice as Sirius. She wanted to feel the wind on her skin, and listen to the trees on Hogwarts ground. She wanted to stare out at the black lake and catch snowflakes on her tongue with Harry.  She wanted her brother to read to her as he used to. She wanted Charlie to kiss her.
"Yes, her name was Isolt. She was born in Ireland, but when she was young her mother and father were killed by her aunt." She paused, and looked at Potter confused, he looked conflicted and looked at her.
"You're okay," Draco whispered against Harry's neck as he let out a breath. Harry pulled back, pressing a deep kiss to Draco, before releasing him. Harry barely had a chance as Molly rushed forward and pulled him into a hard hug.
"I know the area, alright. You can let me off here, Ernie Prangs. I appreciate the information." Draco said, standing. "And you said you wanted a name, so I'll give you one." Draco stepped forward as the bus slammed to a stop, he leaned down close to Ernie's ear. "Neville Longbottom." He whispered and apparated directly out of the bus, stumbling a landing in a cemetery in Willow's Creek, the sun began its descent and the streets were empty. Draco looked around and went towards the woods to the left of the cemetery and silently thanked the fact that his mother's family had lived here, giving him some knowledge of the area.
"Because if he is anything like you, Sia, then he can't be that bad," Potter said, before straightening. "I've got detention with Umbridge so I have to go, I just wanted to check on you."
Even once they came to you. You can't whimper, you can't cry. You refuse to move. No matter the pain they inflicted, you can never cry out, beg for mercy.
"Mother! Father!" She called out, keeping her tone light, a tone she reserved for her family, it was a fake tone because she had to keep up appearances. She knew everyone was home. She had stayed longer in America, saying goodbye to her friends and making sure she didn't forget a single thing. Being that it was August 16th, and she started school back at Hogwarts on September 1st. She was shocked that she wasn't being greeted by her family. Her father's anger at her refusal to come straight home after term ended, her mother's complacent behavior and her brother's curiosity about school in America; Asteria knew what she signed on for when she ignored her father's summons to return directly home.
Suddenly the room slightly shifted and a pile of old damaged books appeared on a table near her. She stepped closer and picked the first book up, and felt the magic coursing through the pages, she sat to the ground and opened it, revealing dangerous dark magics that she had never heard of. And she diligently began to read, her stomach and mind reeling at the information she gathered.
Draco stood under a ledge hidden in the shadows, every instinct had led him here, but now they were telling him to run. But from where he stood he could see so much of the Ministry. And right now he was watching the love of his life run away from Yaxley, and he needed him. Draco quickly cast his disillusionment charm and followed the group as they ran. Granger holding Weasley and Harry apparated away, and Yaxley attempted to follow, but Draco grabbed the blond wizard and was suddenly on the front step to a dark house he knew was the previous headquarters of the Order. Draco was quick, bodyslamming Yaxley through the door, and flinging a precarious spell at the older wizard, rendering him unconscious. Draco rolled off the body and attempted to catch his breath. He had decided to take his own hostage to find out information on his sister, or who could've taken her. Finally, Draco worked his way to sitting and glanced at Yaxley, who lay in an awkward position on the floor, Draco was quick to stand and haul the body up tossing it over his shoulder, using trained Quidditch muscles to perform his task, and apparated on the spot, reappearing in the living room of his own home base, his sister's house. He was quick to set the body down, and tie it to a metal chair he had found in the cellar. He went about discarding his disguise and pouring a clear liquid down his captive's throat before waking him.
"From the moment I stepped foot in Hogwarts, my every step had to be calculated, because Lucius had his spies watching me. Parkinson, Goyle, Crabbe, and Zabini are in no way my friends or confidants, they watch my every move and report everything to Lucius; who was concerned that I would take the same rebellious nature of my sister." He paused and glanced at Asteria. "If I didn't react to something in a specific way or make life difficult for all of you, I would have to face punishment, that Asteria usually took the brunt of when she returned home. I hated to see her hurt so I followed orders.
"Now everyone pair up and simply practice the spell. Asteria and I will make rounds and hand out pointers." He finished, and everyone bustled and began practicing. The young kids struggled, and Longbottom.
She felt Charlie stumble beside her, as he went down to his knees, the tears trailing down his face. She dropped to her knees and pulled him into her arms, letting his tears soak her chest, as her own dripped into his hair. She reached out her hand and gripped her brother's tightly. She could see his pain all over his face. She knew the Draco had spent a large amount of time with the Twin's while she had been kidnapped. She glanced around and finally saw Harry, who had his hands clenched at his side, looking around at the bodies laid out in the Hall, the death that he, no doubt, blamed himself for. She released Draco and Charlie and walked to the dark-haired wizard.
After years of training, a person could maybe pick up a sort of sixth sense for things, like emotional ranges. Something she had learned years ago with her father. So whenever someone slipped into the darkness, she could practically taste the hatred, the violence that radiated from the stranger. She was positive she knew who the person was, but couldn't exactly pinpoint the name. She could barely pinpoint her own name. She didn't hear the steps but felt malicious intent and tried to brace for pain because it always came.
"Sia, I understand. Merlin, if I could convince Harry to run, I would. But Remus is right, Harry won't run, he wouldn't leave his friends." Sirius answered, but his admission settled her because it wasn't just her. They were fully aware of what would happen if Potter stayed, but they knew how he'd react, and so did she, but it didn't mean she didn't want to try anyway. Asteria sat on the couch, and both men followed her, sitting down next to her.
"His injuries were serious, but he is going to be okay. Bill is with him now, and Charlie is on his way back as well." Molly said, pulling Potter into a hug, before reaching out to her. Asteria let the woman fold her into a hug, and Asteria gave her a small smile, pushing her to a seat.
October 30th, the night before Halloween, at the feast, the other schools arrived along with a bustle of Ministry employees. Durmstrang and Beauxbatons students had arrived and Asteria was late to the feast. Missing the main speech by Dumbledore as well as the entrances by the other schools. Having lost track of time in the library, due to homework, she slipped in silently and took a seat at the edge of her table. No one but Snape seemed to notice her entrance, and yet he did nothing. There were murmurings at the sight of the Goblet, and the blue flame that was sparking from the top. She gathered all she needed thanks to the gossip around the table, as students chomped down on the food. The champions had tonight, and tomorrow to put their names into the Goblet, and then the champions would be selected at the feast tomorrow night. It all sounded simple enough, she had to wait until tomorrow, as it was her birthday, but that was fine. She had gotten a letter from her father that morning, reminding her what would happen if she didn't put her name in it. At least he was aware that the likely hood of her being chosen was slim.
"Merlin, mate. When was the last time you ate?" Fred asked, and Draco shrugged in response, and Fred grabbed his arm, tossing his own hood up and dragging Draco out the back door, leading to Diagonally, and nearly forced him into the door of his shop.
"Listen, Potter, I'll look into it, okay?" She offered and patted his hand. "I'm good at digging up information." She didn't add that she was still sitting on serious information, but catching up to Dumbledore at this time, was incredibly difficult. She didn't want to burden Potter unnecessarily with information he wouldn't really understand, he wouldn't understand why someone would stoop so low into the some of the darkest arts in the magical world.
"I know, but it needs to be an option. I do not want him to die in this, Remus." She replied, running a hand through her dark hair.
Asteria let out a sigh as she reached the common rooms, and went and changed, putting on her comfiest pants, and curling up with her little brother on the couch, as they traded off, telling stories. And it went silent as midnight hit.
"Lucius was the one seen, and there were strands of long platinum hair in her hand, and she had markings on her back like she'd been hit with a thin stick of some sort." Potter supplied, slowly, watching Asteria. She looked at Charlie.
"Did you have fun, father?" She grumbled and walked towards the kitchenette and grabbed a cup of tea.
"I'm inclined to trust you, Ms. Malfoy." Dumbledore said as he slipped into the hospital wing, "You have shown a piece of every house here at Hogwarts, bravery worthy of Godric, loyalty honoring Helga, intelligence surpassing Rowena, and a certain cunningness envious of Salazar, I've never been more proud, especially since you have only spent two actual years at Hogwarts." He had supplied, "I had wanted to resort you, but Lucius was against that entire idea."
"Sia, oh Sia." His voice wasn't enough to break the pain, and she tried to thrash out of his hold. She screamed again, and again, her voice going hoarse, and she couldn't make it stop.
"No, I aided in the escape of an innocent man, away from a dangerous witch," Asteria responded, and checked on McGonagall, who shockingly was still breathing, she let out a breath of relief. "But you have angered an even more dangerous witch in the process. All of you, know this, I have seen your faces. If you do not remove yourselves from my school, you won't get another chance at it. I know you, and your families and they will suffer for your insolence." Asteria stated, letting her cold, gray eyes connect with each of their faces, leaving Umbridge for last.
"That's not all that's on your mind though, is it?" There it was, the reason he avoided Ginny, she was observant and intelligent beyond her years, and Draco could only cock his head at her.
The saddest part of her captivity was the loneliness. Even when whoever came into the room, but there was no conversation. It was like being tortured by a ghost, but she knew it was an actual person.
"Thanks, Bill," Draco replied, and led Harry to the bathroom, pushing him through the door, and reaching around him and turning on the water. "Get cleaned up, I'll be in the room next door." Draco supplied, before pressing a gentle kiss to his cheek and exiting the room, heading back into Asteria's. Charlie's head was down, resting on her prone hand. It was beginning to ache just looking at her, patiently waiting for her to wake up. Draco was fully aware that if she ever woke, she probably wouldn't be the same again. She'd been through too much to ever be the person she used to be. She wouldn't suddenly wake up and be the same badass witch she had been. She would probably try and put on a front for everyone, but Draco had seen enough and had learned a lot in the last 11 months. He knew deep down how damaging what she went through had been. Maybe one day, she'd been close to who she'd been, but it would take time, love, and support. That he was willing to give, and he knew Charlie would as well. It was obvious, that Charlie loved Asteria. Charlie lifted his head, leaning back in his chair close to the window.
"You are a jerk, Sai. But not wrong, I do have to go." She said glancing at her watch, "It's almost time for the feast." She said with a wicked grin.Asteria glanced at her own watch and noticed it was true. They felt the library, arms locked and trailed down to the Great Hall. It had been rearranged for the announcements, Asteria and Alice, took their seats as Dumbledore began to speak, he droned on about the rules, what the tournament would entail. And waved his hand over the Goblet, a piece of paper flying out and into his hand.
"I'll take care of Professor McGonagall. They are going to try and put you in Azkaban, so go." She whispered, and he nodded, vanishing into the Forbidden Forest.
But soon the trio vanished from the cottage to return on their hunt, and she had stood on shaky legs as she'd watched them leave, a worried frown settling on her face. Draco had returned to his own job, meticulously disabling the Snatchers and Death Eaters so the Twins could tell the world where was safe to hide. She didn't judge her brother, especially after he told her what had happened with Yaxley, oblivating them didn't seem to hold, it was the best option to take some of Voldemort's forces out of the battle.
"Weasley still being a prat?" She asked, referring to the conversation they had, had a few days prior. Potter's eyes narrowed at the table, before leaning back.
"Appearances, Potter. We all have to keep up with our own. At least for now." He replied. "If after a match, we didn't get into a fight, like we do every year, someone would get suspicious."
"Oh Harry, my sweet boy." She whispered as he wrapped his arms around her waist, his shoulder's shaking as he began to cry. "It's over." She whispered delicately as she tightened her hold on him, glancing up and seeing her brother, covered in dirt and blood, his pants torn around his knees, and his left sleeve missing as he watched them, tears in his eyes. She patted Harry's shoulder, before pulling away, turning him, and pushing him towards Draco, who was fast to wrap his boyfriend up in his arms as they both let the tears fall. Draco's face buried into Harry's neck as his shoulders shook. She glanced around and watched as Auror's gathered all the remaining Death Eaters in ropes, including her parents. She looked away and was suddenly swept off her feet, and she laughed as she recognized Charlie, who wrapped her in his arms, holding her tight.
"Not yet. I had hoped to give this to you later after you were back to yourself, but I want to give it to you now." Draco responded, and reached under the bed he slept in, pulling out a delicately wrapped small box, and handed it to Harry. "Happy Birthday."
Five delicate hours later, they, except for Sirius, poured up to the fireplace to floo, which Asteria wasn't looking forward too. She hated flooing, especially since turning 17 she preferred apperating, but Molly had insisted. The Weasley children had livened up after getting some sleep and were full of chatter. Potter was faking his way through the chatter, and Asteria was too tired to be full of energy, having not slept yet, instead cleaning up the kitchen, and arranging for all their trunks to arrive with Granger later in the afternoon so she had spent some extra time transfiguring everyone's pajamas into proper attire, which had also been a tiring process. She almost passed at the chance to go but decided she needed to keep up appearances, sliding her hood over her head to avoid attracting too much attention. But she was attending to add protection and support; since they couldn't request for Auror protection, and being the only one besides Molly to legally perform magic, she had to go; according to Sirius.
"I believe you are correct, Severus," Dumbledore added, and looked at Barty Crouch. "Is there any way we can undo this?"
"Don't pretend ignorance, Dray, you know what I'm talking about. Now let's get away from here, so no one makes any assumptions. If anyone ever asks, Mother. Father never left the tent." She whispered, dragging her brother out of the tent, and holding his hand as she broke out into a run. It only took them a moment to reach the line of the woods, and she had to skid to a stop to avoid plowing into a small group, she barely recognized the group, but her brother did. And his Malfoy exterior came out to play.
"Sia, look at me." She tried to rip her face out of Potter's hands, but he held fast, "I need you to focus on me, Asteria. I know it hurts, but I need you to calm down." His voice held no malice just sadness.
When one word jumped at her, one piece of magic screamed out at her, and she realized what happened, what the truth was behind Voldemort's return. And she knew how he had accomplished it.
"Your idiot brother Ronald has run away from Harry and Hermione abandoning them in their mission," Draco muttered under his breath as he flinched, flexing his hand and walking to the sink.
"But I could, I was best in my Potions class under Severus Snape, and I am still a Malfoy," Draco said, unable to resist the luxury of fear that played across his captives face. "Now, do you know where my sister is?"
"No. Best to let them come here themselves." Draco supplied, taking his seat. "And I didn't want to give something to cause Harry to feel even worse about." Charlie nodded.
"Because I am a woman, I won't be the Heir, you will be. I need to prove myself worthy so father can marry me off to some monster." She responded, and rolled her shoulders.
"Crucio" it was silent, but it was painful as the spell hit her in the chest and she hit the ground, biting down on her tongue. When suddenly, Krum stiffened and fell to the front, face first, revealing Potter behind him, wand raised.
"Think about it, Charlie. At 11-years-old, Harry went against You-Know-Who who was attached to his DADA professor. At 12, he had to go against the spirit of You-Know-Who AND a basilisk. At 13, he learned one of his father's best friends betrayed them to said dark wizard. At 14, he gets dragged into a dangerous tournament, because Albus didn't vex his professor enough, and has to witness the return of the person who killed his parents, and wants to kill him. At 15, when the entirety of the Wizarding World thinks Harry is a liar and insane, he was practically tortured by ANOTHER professor and had to witness the death of his godfather, who he loved very much. At 16, he had to learn everything he could about the monster who is hunting him and then watched his mentor be murdered by his DADA professor or ex-potions professor. Now at 17, he is on the run, probably fully aware of what's happening back in the world, and is out risking his life for a war that isn't his bloody problem. All because of that twisted headmaster and You-Know-fucking-Who." Draco explained, his temper flaring slightly.
"You really shouldn't allow yourself to dwell so much on dreams, Potter," Lucius responded with a smirk. There was silence as Potter grabbed her arm, and launched an exploding charm at the top of the rows, Asteria launched a knockback jinx at the Death Eaters in for y of her and they began to run.
"But we seem to be having a hard time getting enough signal to broadcast to more people," George added.
"Mrs. Jones, come to have a seat, you as well, Ms. Black." Dumbledore insisted, prying Mrs. Jones off her, and helping her to a seat, and Asteria followed suit. "Well, it has come to my attention, that Ms. Alice Jones has disappeared," Dumbledore said with certainty, and Asteria felt her throat close up.
"The first task, it's involves actual dragons." He repeated, louder then before, and she leaned back.
"Next, the Beauxbatons champion.." a piece of something flew out of the Goblet and into his hand once more, "is Fleur Delacour!" And once again, cheering happened, including Alice, whose face shined with pride.
"Thanks, Potter." Draco grumbled, "Under Lucius' orders, I have been forced to join the Inquisitor Squad, which is a group of students who are under Umbridge's rule and are loyal to her." Draco finished a look of shame on his face.
"Oh, can she tell us about six months' worth of meetings?" Dumbledore asked, raising his eyebrows. "I was under the impression that she was merely reporting a meeting tonight." Asteria suddenly felt the fierce stare of Albus Dumbledore, and glanced up, brushing Potter's hand gently. She retreated and stood behind Edgecombe.
"No, I'm quite sure I would've seen him in the graveyard, but I suppose you are like this imbecile and have no actual brain in your head. But if you'll excuse me, I must get back with Mr. Potter, we have celebrating to do." She smiled, darkly, before leading Potter away from the two.
"Maybe they didn't at one point." Asteria responded, "but now, after spending the better back of the school year, being trained by me, being taught ALL the things I, a Malfoy, was taught, I think they stand a beautiful chance."
He takes Harry’s glass from him and puts it on the nightstand. Harry collapses back against his pillow a little too quickly and has to close his eyes to stop the room from spinning.
There’s a part of Harry that wants to snap at him to fuck off, but there’s also a twinge in his bicep where Malfoy hauled him out of the path of falling stone and certain death.
But then a blink and all he could see was his psychotic aunt flinging books in the air and using them for target practice, Nagini curling her body through the rungs of the ladder.
“Well, not really,” Luna disagrees mildly, but Harry can see she’s not happy with the whole situation. “It’s very upsetting that Draco is coming under this scrutiny. He didn’t kill his father.”
She came to him a month after the trials when he was still in a numb sort of shock, sitting on the floor of his flat with his back against the musty sofa and trying to imagine how to be a person in the world. She asked him to fix an heirloom pendant that her grandmother had given her. She’d broken it as she fled the battle.
Parkinson makes absolutely no effort to wait for them and is around two corners and half-way down a long corridor before they catch her up just as she reaches the doors to the library.
He spends a few hours putting the finishing touches on his Christmas surprise for Rose and then Floos to the Lion.
The door opened to her left, and Potter walked in, his hair a mess, as usual, but dressed in his nicest clothes, but the way his hands were folded in front of him, spoke volumes. He was slouched, trying to look smaller, invisible. She wanted to wrap him up and take him from all of this, from war, from battle, from everything that could hurt the poor child that just wanted to live his life. Asteria felt a surge of anger, and had to clench her hands, straightening her back as Dumbledore walked into the room, his calming presence silenced the light chatter of the others, and sent her back to lean against the wall and let out a breath, a quick glance around, and she let the charm hiding her up, and let Potter see her, before refocusing the charm, and watched him let out a deep breath, sagging into the chair, and she focused on him, wishing she could protect him from this, like she wanted to protect her own brother. But she had to let him do this, they wouldn't be able to hide from Fudge and the entire British Wizarding force. She drowned out most of the commentary, knowing if she listened to closely, she'd be liable to start fighting back, so she focused on Potter, on his reactions, his defensive nature, his slouching that was familiar, trying to make yourself a smaller target. And that's when it clicked in her head, and she felt a surge of rage in her chest at the thought, that someone, that some insignificant muggle hurt him, beat on him. She'd seen Potter be brave, face death and battle head-on, his head high, and ready to fight, so it had slipped past her, but she knew the signs because she had done the same things until she ended up in America.
"Yes, you do seem to spend a large amount of time with my father, Minister." She said, looking at him with accusatory eyes, "And yes, Illverymore, but I'll be returning to Hogwarts for my final two years." Fudge seemed to be stunned, still by her earlier statement, but she had heard a cough to cover laughter from the Weasley's group.
"I'll try to send word, but I might not be able to let you know what's going on." Draco supplied and George nodded, dismissing him with a worried glance. Draco slipped outside and pulled his cloak closer against the winter wind. He prayed he wasn't too late for his sister. He slipped silently into the bar and wasn't shocked by the atmosphere. Since Yaxley had threatened barman Tom, things had changed drastically. Tom was no longer the warm fellow, one could buy information off of, but a silent broken man who rarely spoke to anyone. Draco slipped over to the shadowed pillars near the stairs without a sound and picked a spot, casting a disillusionment charm, pulling out the parchment from George and studying it. It was simple enough, a wordless charm to track magic movements. Now, all Draco had to do was wait for the Death Eaters to appear. He had studied images of Rowle constantly over the two months he had been restricted to the Weasley's flat. He felt he could now pick the Death Eater out in a crowd better than before.
Asteria at in a compartment aboard the Hogwarts Express, as was trying to squish the murderous rage brewing in the pit of her stomach. Her father had let the news slip about the Tri-Wizard Tournament and had said that she was to put her name in the goblet, whether she wanted to or not. She was under no circumstance to say no; he had given her a look that told her, he would make her life even harder than he was already doing. He had locked her in her room for the remained of the summer, refusing to risk her letting something slip, but she had announced to Fudge and the Weasley's that she would be attending Hogwarts at the start of the school year, so he had to let her out. But he made it very clear, what he would do to her mother if she went against his orders.
of an educational institution that had messed the pair of them up irreparably and there was no way they could let Teddy go. Draco had to be very
Harry wants to protest, because that’s nonsense. Everyone thinks Malfoy is a bloody genius, they’re always telling him so.
When he comes back inside, the sixteenth door is lit, and the fire is roaring happily. Malfoy seems to have regained his composure. Harry wonders if he should say something. Apologise maybe, or just confess all the ridiculous messy feelings inside him that threaten to spill out.
The game the next day is unbelievably tense. The teams are so evenly matched that any time Harry thinks he knows what’s going to happen, the opposite turns out to be true. The Arrows are capable and confident, but their opponents seem to have an answer for every play. As the closing minutes of the game start to count down, the Arrows are very narrowly behind.
It doesn’t make any sense to Harry either, but the wealthy witches drifting around Luna’s store swooning over her selection of Plimpy Home Pedicures seem to be happy, so who is he to judge?
The memories of Malfoy that Harry’s been keeping firmly locked up keep pushing their way forward. A country inn in the Lake District with a bed barely big enough for the pair of them. A Muggle members’ only club in Soho with a ridiculous faux bearskin rug on the floor. Memorably, once, the gleaming tiled bathrooms on the second floor of the Wizengamot. He forces the thoughts back as he takes the stairs up to the East Wing two at a time.
Muggle, definitely. Harry can’t think of anything worse than people recognising him as he slips and falls on his arse repeatedly.
“To be honest,” Harry confesses, “I get pretty confused about which bits of Christmas are Muggle and which bits aren’t.”
“Blimey,” Ron yelps a minute later, as Morgan and North swoop through the middle of the field at a truly frightening pace, knocking Bludgers left and right, while casting assists on the Chasers’ brooms that send them rocketing towards the goal.
“Had a raid go a bit pear-shaped,” Harry concedes. “I got suspended until Christmas so I’ve just been in visiting a woman who got hurt.”
Ron’s face twists even further and the pair of them burst out laughing at the ridiculousness of the situation.
“It seemed appropriate to do something more significant to mark the tenth. The school is putting various things on with the students on the Friday. The ceremonies will be on the Saturday.”
The village of Godric’s Hollow is much prettier now that it’s coming into summer, Draco thinks. Even the riot of Potter Cottage’s overgrown garden has a certain amount of charm. That is, until he has to force his way through a particularly vicious patch of scratchy vines to get to the front door.
Harry slides a tumbler of Firewhisky in front of Draco and leans in to stage whisper loud enough for the other two to hear, “For the record, I think you could charge a lot more.”
Padma is out for the morning chasing down a lead in Shropshire, and when she returns she looks exasperated. “What are you wearing?!”
After an hour he’s sweating buckets and completely shattered, but he’s the happiest he’s ever been. He feels like a remedial flying student in First Year, worse even than Neville had been, but he also feels an incredible sense of hope.
“Does this mean we can have new brooms next season?” Harry asks, figuring now’s as good a time as any.
Then Nott brought him a table runner that was more than a century old. Gold embroidery down the centre was intended to shift throughout the meal, showing you what the next course would be, but now it was stained with blood and Merlin knows what. Draco retched when he saw it.
The mood in the group is subdued. As wonderful as it feels to soak out his tired limbs and get properly clean for the first time in days, no one seems to know what to say to Hermione. And everyone is acutely aware of Neville’s and Ron’s absence.
“Yes, I went to the study, Ron,” she says, and her voice is trembling a little now. “I went because I wanted to destroy the cushion I held over Lucius Malfoy’s face until he stopped breathing.”
Harry is about to follow when he realises Malfoy has stopped moving and is just standing there, looking rather a lot younger and more defeated than Harry has seen him recently. Harry has a vivid memory of him, in the hour after Voldemort’s death, being led quietly away by his sobbing mother and his incensed father. This Malfoy reminds him a little too keenly of that earlier, more broken version.
The strange thing about imagining you’ve seen Draco Malfoy on a street corner is that then the evil little ferret takes up residence in your brain. Harry starts to think he sees him everywhere, just out of the corner of his eye. One time, he looks out his window and thinks Malfoy’s in the small park opposite his house but by the time he shoves his shoes on and sprints across the street to look, there’s no one there. Later in the week, Harry’s walking toward the queue at the little coffee cart at the mouth of Knockturn Alley, and he’s sure Malfoy is taking a cup. But Diagon is crowded and Harry has to manoeuvre around several throngs of shoppers and a couple of well-wishers and when he gets to the cart there’s only two old witches in the queue arguing over whether they should be cutting back on their sugar or can treat themselves to a slice of cake.
The panes of glass have knitted themselves back together and the walls have made space. He can see blue sky and
“And the castle seemed to adapt,” Hannah goes on. “Luna’s Christmas light spell held. But anytime something got us closer to the door, it was as if the castle fought back against the threat.”
owning a car,” Harry tries to reason with him as he trots down the front steps behind him, wishing he’d pulled a dressing gown on over his pyjamas, “How are we going to remember what it looks like?”
. They seem smaller than he imagined, having loomed so large in his imagination for the last few weeks.
“Nice to see you too, Parkinson,” Harry sighs, waving his wand to clean up the mess. “To what do I owe the pleasure?”
“What are you talking about?” She levels her glare at Harry, rather than Draco, which Harry feels is a bit unwarranted.
The counterpoise charms he’s using are designed to slide into the gaps in the rings’ magic, almost like a prosthesis. If he’s right, the spells will hold the rings in balance. Not repaired—not whole—but no longer dangerous.
“If you’re serious about this,” he said, kissing Harry again as he fastened his coat, “then there’s no reason to rush.”
Draco gets up, moving to sit beside him on the sofa. He reaches out to lift Harry’s head up so that he’ll look at him properly. There’s a faint flush across his cheeks.
The champagne with Pansy has made him too relaxed to do any serious work, but he lies on his sofa with the books open around him and lets his mind drift a little, turning Lily’s ring over and over in his hand.
And then later in the week, he can’t work out why the Beaters keep overshooting the charmed training Bludgers, until Morgan admits that Harry has them flying too slow.
“The one on patrician bonds!” she says, as if that should have been obvious, and with what Harry considers a really unnecessary amount of excitement. She produces a thin, ancient-looking leatherbound volume from the top of a teetering pile.
Granger remains tense and hunched but says nothing. Lovegood finishes her charms, and sits back on the floor with her file to update her notes.
“Oh!” Neville looks startled, probably because Harry has started acting like a crazy person. “That’s a
“What’s this going to mean for the ritual?” Ron asks. “Should we try those spells? No point in carrying on if they don’t work.”
“I’ve told you everything,” he says, smoothing a hand over the map in front of him, weighted down at the corners with pebbles against the crisp spring breeze. “There’s no need for you to … If you come back tomorrow, I won’t have anything new for you.”
It ends as quickly and surprisingly as it began. Potter pulls back with a gasp, staggering a step backwards into the street. His lips are bright red and his eyes are flashing. The thundercloud is in full effect. Draco almost feels like he can
Neville’s found a way to splice in the Japanese bristles that manage to get an extra couple of seconds of speed out their brooms. When Draco times the Chasers and realises how fast they are, he plain tackles a startled Neville to the ground in joy. Even Leila helps out, devising a modification to one of her existing charms that will abide by all of the League regulations, and yet still lift some of the muscle strain players experience in their quads when they lean heavily into a turn.
At this, Hermione gives him her full attention, prompting an “ow” from Rose as the dinosaur tugs free. “Ron said you’d been staying over. Is the house really that bad?”
That should be the end of it. Hermione’s been like a drill sergeant with them all about preparation. They’ve practised over and over, for weeks. There’s no way she can realistically suggest they substitute
“Too much to hope for professionalism from the Aurors then, I see,” Parkinson drawls, pushing her salad listlessly around the plate in front of her.
. He’s spent years carefully rebuilding his name and jealously guarding his privacy. Then Harry shows up, and overnight it’s all blown up in his face.
“Don’t be so melodramatic, Potter,” Malfoy retorts, already heading for the front door. “I’ll fix it, obviously, and in time for you to entertain your Weasleys.”
“They need to get better at casting though, Potter,” Malfoy says, with a warning edge to his tone. He rebuttons his coat, and heads towards the door, calling over his shoulder, “It’s not optional.”
Harry’s forced to concede that tearing Viktor’s clothes off Draco in Viktor’s house is a little much, even if that’s all he wants to do in this moment. He steps back and takes a breath and tries to get his body to understand that message.
“Maybe next year,” he says, putting the unused cutlery away in the drawer, and trying very hard not to think about whether such a fragile thing can last that long.
At home Harry realises he hasn’t really given any thought to how to set the tree up, or keep it fresh, and by the time he manages to find a bucket and hit the tree with every charm he can think of to stop it from falling over, he’s exhausted and wishing he’d gone the magical route after all.  Still, it looks impressive. Tall and stately, filling the room with the smell of a forest, but in a good way. Harry’s pretty proud of himself. So much so that he heads straight up to bed, and forgets about the advent calendar entirely.
“Alright,” Harry says, taking and turning the large iron door handles and pushing. “After you, I guess.”
true Ginny. He may have used you, but he could never change who you really are. You’re our Ginny. Brave and beautiful and —”
him stay away from your trial,” she cries, her voice thick with emotion. “Because you didn’t deserve it! You didn’t earn it! He was all ready to stand up for you for not identifying him that night at the Manor. But that was nothing.
“Breakfast will be in the Blue Room in the morning, Harry,” Luna says gently, giving her tacit forgiveness for his abrupt departure. “And then I think Draco is organising a hunt. The woods on the grounds here are really beautiful.”
When Harry comes out of Belle’s room on Thursday afternoon, he goes to find Luna. She’s not at the Healer’s station, but Scary Magda tips her chin in the direction of the Staff Lounge and so Harry decides to try it without risking any further questions.
Harry loves the Weasley clan more than he can say, and there’s never been a single moment where he’s felt like anything less than a son and a sibling. But around the holidays it’s always a little tough. Ever since it became clear that he and Ginny weren’t remotely suited to each other, coming to family dinners solo has always made him feel self-conscious. Even Charlie has stopped gadding about Romania and settled down with Andrei, the innkeeper who lives next to the dragon sanctuary.
There’s an almighty bang. The floor rocks beneath him and Harry is knocked to the ground. An explosion of light and magic bursts out overhead, so severe it feels like it burns his eyes even though they’re closed. All the power leaves him in a final cataclysmic rush.
“Hello, Melinda!” Harry’s delighted to have solved that particular social conundrum without having to ask.
He snatches up his notebook and begins to write. Granger has the good grace to wait until he’s finished this time.
Draco’s expression closes in like a stormfront. “Of course,” he says quietly, pushing Harry back and rearranging the covers defensively. “My apologies for misreading the situation.”
“Suit yourself,” she says happily. “I have rounds.” She drifts off in the direction of the general wards, her voice lifting up again in song. “
Granger flinches at that, but she’s not a stupid woman. She draws a folded parchment from her robes and passes it to him.
“What is it? Where are we?” Harry calls, waving his torch around to get his bearings. The ceiling is low, with heavy wooden beams overhead, like a cellar. He hears a broken sounding cry and swings his light in the other direction.
“Oh. Well, we can make do with what we have at the moment, honestly. I have a line on replacement bristles out of Japan that are really good for precision turns.”
“Well,” Leila looks around at the empty public pitch. It’s far too cold for anyone else to be here in the middle of a weekday morning, a fact Harry was counting on when he chose not to wear a Glamour. He doesn’t want to begin working on this at the club, and it was hard to think where he could go that would have space and privacy. “This will do for now. We start.”
Draco waves away her protests for the dozenth time. “We both know not everyone feels that way. Besides, I’m very happy out there with the
, Draco Malfoy. You love Christmas and you wish your mother was well enough to celebrate it with you. You came home from France because you don’t trust anyone else to save her, even me. Probably especially me. You hate surprises, which is why you read the last page of a book before the beginning. Why you need windows in your Advent calendar and why you vanish the wrapping on a gift. You never want to be surprised again, in case it turns out as poorly as it did when we were kids.”
“We need to take him in, Harry. You’re basically harbouring someone who isn’t even allowed to be here.”
Something about the grim little room makes Harry feel sad. As if Malfoy doesn’t plan on sticking around long, or as if he doesn’t feel like he deserves an office of his own. It all feels so
Harry thinks about coughing to announce his arrival, but there’s another loud thump as a pile of folded linen flies out of the box and hits the floorboards in front of him and he decides to escape without enduring any further lectures.
things that Malfoy will always be: a bully, an inflicter of pain, a Death Eater. Perhaps this ridiculous weekend will put an end to whatever the hell it is they’ve been doing once and for all. Harry can find less complicated ways to … let off steam when he needs to. Merlin knows Malfoy doesn’t seem to even
This time the Arrows hold out for a lot longer, and are fairly bursting with questions when they come in to land.
Harry crosses the threshold in time to see Malfoy give the paper to a young woman, who glances at it briefly and then turns to the shelf behind her where thick shiny green envelopes are stacked, presumably full of photographs.
Harry is afraid it’s too late. And he’s afraid of that fear too, because it means that whatever this is, it’s certainly not just faintly ironic sex anymore.
Harry’s already changed into his pyjamas and is propped up in bed with his playbook. Malfoy stares at him for a long minute before chuckling to himself as he kicks off his boots. Harry adjusts his glasses self-consciously.
“I’m sure,” Harry snaps, cutting him off. “Maxwell told me himself. I need you to take it off, in case we’re subject to a Games and Sports audit.”
He watches Hermione’s expression changing as he speaks, from something like denial, until just tiredness and resignation.
Harry shakes his head quickly. “No, I know. But if I’d been doing my job properly that day, you wouldn’t have been injured. So I just wanted to stop by.” He glances at the copy of
“It was nice of you to visit him at home,” she continues, the line of little blue glass bottles following the gentle arc of her wand.
"Head Girl? I just don't get it." She added, and Potter shook his head at her as he dusted a curtain.
Asteria stood in the Great Hall at Hogwarts, sitting in her seat, watching as students trickled inside. She looked at the tiny eleven-year-olds, ready to be sorted. She caught sight of her brother at the Slytherin table,  who flashed her a smile, before focusing on the new students. She glanced down at the Gryffindor table and got the same reaction from the Trio, and she leaned back, letting her mind wander.
"Yeah, they were talking about the book Skeeter wrote about Dumbledore," Harry responded, leaning against a pole.
Once the gong sounded, Asteria took off at a dead run, into the maze, and kept her eyes angled downward, and took an instant right turn, going right then left for a few more meters, and paused, squatting downward at the sight of a large spider, she slipped her wand from her boots, taking precarious aim, mumbling a silent stunning curse and watched the spider drop freeze and collapse. She was quick to get back on her feet and jump over the spider and continuing on straight until she was forced into a fork in the maze. She stood there catching her breath when she heard a high pitched scream in the distance.
"We all took off, and it happened suddenly, they were there. The Death Eaters. And it went crazy." Harry answered, running a hand over his face, "I saw Moody take a spell and fall, and then Voldemort was there and he was flying, without a broom, and Hedwig got out of her cage and protected me, and then my wand did something crazy and acted on its own, and hell, Draco, it's just been too much." And Draco didn't respond, just pulled Harry into his body, holding him close.
"Do you know where the Chamber of Secrets is?" She asked, there wasn't a point in hiding behind the subject, she wanted to get to her cousin's.
"Really?" He said and looked at the book, his eyebrow rising at the old tome on his desk. "Where did you get this book, Ms. Black?"
In the week since the battle, the three of them had stayed with the Weasley family, as Asteria hunted for a home. She had finally found one, about 6 kilometers away from Hogwarts. With her accepting the role as the new Potions Professor as well as the Head of House Slytherin, and Charlie accepting the teaching position as well, she felt being closer to the school was nice, considering Harry and Draco had decided to return to the school. She hadn't had to look for long, both McGonagall and Abe had made suggestions at where she could find something. The house she picked was large, closer to the size of a Manor, with more than enough room for everyone. She had loved the look of the house, decorated in a light grey and black trim on the outside, and full-sized windows, that let in plenty of natural light. The inside was decorated similarly to the outside, with light grey walls, but white trim, along each entryway. The home came fully stocked with furniture and a stocked large library. Draco and Harry already picked their room and decided to call the entire west wing theirs. Which Asteria had no issue with, as she had taken the east wing for herself. From her room, she could see the ocean near the Manor, and opening the window would let the sandy smell into her room, basking her in it. Charlie had returned to Romania to pack up all his belongings, and she wondered how things would play out concerning her mother.
"Yes, ma'am." He replied with a smug smile and a bow. "I saw your picture in the prophet, and saw you beautifully defeat that dragon during the first task."
Two months later, Asteria still hadn't acted on her anger towards Umbridge. Snape's words about not getting caught constantly played along with her head every time she thought of just outright hexing the pink witch. She had written to Alice, using a code they had created in Asteria's first year and hadn't received a response yet, it had begun to worry her. A full month without a response from her best friend was beginning to look suspicious. And on that Friday, she received a letter, not from Alice but from Sirius. Written diligently in code, but Asteria knew her cousin's writing.
"Both her legs were broken in multiple spots, and she had a few cracked ribs, which was impairing her breathing. She had some slashes on her back, and I'm not sure what did them, but I was able to heal them, but the scar's remained." She supplied, a look of pain crossing her face before disappearing. "The bruising was around her ankles, wrist and a few others on the tops of her arms, probably where she had been grabbed and chained."
"I figured, love." He responded in a supportive voice, but he still seemed sad. She looked at him, grey eyes searching blue ones.
"I'm sure Dumbledore had his reasons, Sia." Granger supplied, and the older witch shot the younger girl a glare, softening after a second.
"Yes." Dumbledore looked thoughtful as he stood and walked to a portrait, and spoke to it. They waited in silence as the previous headmaster disappeared, and Asteria stood in silence keeping to the back of the classroom. She didn't know what was going on at this point, and she was a bit concerned as to what it was, as she leaned against the wall beside the door, going unnoticed, by the group. Something bad had happened, or Potter just had a horrifying nightmare, however, she doubts Potter would react as such for a bad dream. Asteria took a quiet breath, running a hand through her messy hair, wishing she had brushed it this morning before heading to the library. Dumbledore straightened and spoke quietly with the portrait, and moved to another, and to, all the Weasley's obvious restraint, everyone remained silent while he spoke. And he turned, facing everyone in the room, his eyes finding her, he didn't show any indication of her presence.
"I need 3 sets of Seventh-year books, 2 sets for the fifth year, and one for the fourth year, can you do that?" Asteria asked, "And can you do it quietly?" She added, placing a little pouch of galleons on the counter, and he nodded quickly, bustling around, and pulled out 6 large stacks of books, tied together with rope.
"He's right, Potter. We are currently in a three-way battle, between us, the Ministry and Voldemort. We don't know who is a spy for who, and we need to keep things as realistic as possible." Asteria added. "This is war, and until we can get Fudge either out of office or see sense, we have to be cautious; because right now, the Ministry and Voldemort's forces are focused on us, here at Hogwarts. Which in turn means its a two on one battle, with us with the most to lose, because this is a school with innocents. So we have to wait it out." Both boys looked at her in curiosity.
"Oi, Malfoy!" She paused, slightly; wondering if someone meant her or her brother. She glanced back and saw a guy chase after her. And she paused in shock.
"I can't believe he did that. That-That bloody Weasel!" He snapped and paused. Draco glanced at him, taking in the shocked look on the redhead's face, and started to laugh as water ran over his bleeding hand, doubling over as George followed close behind.
"No, why did Dumbledore know?" He asked, his expression growing serious, and Potter looked away, he knew.
"I am done." She stopped, taking a breath, "I officially renounce my Malfoy Heritage, I renounce you as my father. And, if I so much as catch an inkling that you put that disgusting mark on Draco, I will make what Voldemort is capable of, look like child's play. I will end you and your pathetic existence without a single moment of hesitation." She finished, walking towards Charlie, who sat on the edge of her bed, and he wrapped a delicate hand around her waist, lending her support, as her father stood, giving her a murderous look and leaving. While her mother looked at the two, her hand over her mother, and she paused, after he left the room, she walked towards her daughter, taking her face in her hands.
"Why in Merlin's name did they choose the second task to be in the Black Lake, during FEBRUARY?" Asteria nearly yelled, as paces her common room. She adjusted her Slytherin scarf and shoved her hands back into her pockets. She glanced back up at Alice, who sat in on the black chair, her legs crossed.
"Shit, I didn't even realize," Draco muttered under his breath as he took a chair that Remus offered him. Sitting beside his sister's bed, brought back plenty of memories of his childhood. How when he was six years old, he'd snuck out and into the forest by his Manor, and gotten hurt. Father had been furious, but Asteria came flying into the room at eight years old and claimed to have tricked Draco into going into the forest. Father had beaten her so severely, that she hadn't been able to move for a month, and Draco had sat by her bed then.
"As I mentioned earlier, you aren't allowed to be caught, it will draw too much-unwanted attention to yourself." He finished, straightening as Ravenclaw's and Slytherin's came into the door, alike. He flashed her a knowing look and she sighed, preparing for her class.
"Of course he couldn't. Your sister is the most guarded person I've ever meant, and if they had gotten anything out of her, that would put both you and Harry in danger, which she would never actually allow." Remus added, with a knowing look. And Draco blanched again, finally realizing his own part in this war, while earlier he had just brushed off most of it, only involving himself for Harry and his sister. If his father or Voldemort found out that Draco was in a romantic relationship with Harry Potter, Draco, himself, could be used as a manipulative pawn for the Death Eaters to get to Harry, because everyone involved in the war, knew Harry would drop everything for the people he cared about, and that included his Slytherin boyfriend.
"I used the spell you gave me. I followed the three from Ollivander's to the Manor, and then followed Rowle to the Ministry, and finally to Godric's Hollow." Draco explained, "Rowle went to the cemetery, and moved the angel statue, revealing a secret chamber. Where they had her blindfolded, a muggle charm over her ears, and she was" Draco choked out, "chained to the floor, like an animal." Draco closed his eyes and snapped them open. "Harry and Granger were there. I didn't ask why I had to get Asteria somewhere safe."
"I'll be fine. Harry, love you have to go." Draco urged and grabbed out at Granger. "I love you, Potter. Be safe." He said, before taking off from Harry, and taking up a stance beside Remus, his wand drawn.
"Well, my cousin is in Beauxbaton, and since last year was my last year, I decided to participate in a internship of sorts, at Beauxbaton." She answered with a grin, "But this school is freaking stuffy." She mumbled, adjusting her revealing top.
"No ma'am, I wouldn't risk scaring my lovely face for a dragon egg." She chuckled, and Potter followed. Dumbledore entered, and gave both her and Potter approving smiles.
That smug bastard, Charlie, had come to Illverymore to talk about dragons in her Care of Magical Creatures class and stayed the last three months of her school year, it wasn't until after, when she ran into him at the local bed and breakfast, did they hit it off, and began to drown themselves in a summer romance, that never went further then kisses and long walks on the beach. She let out a sound in the back of her throat. He had never pressured her, but she had told him about her father, leaving out his name. And she had nearly fallen in love, before breaking it off and fleeing back to her family manor. She laid back, tossing a hand over her eyes to hold back the emotional distress currently fumbling around her chest and stomach. She knew very well, Charlie wasn't going to be leaving the area. He'd stay to keep an eye on Harry for his parents, and wanted to kick herself.
"Draco, come here!" She shouted, and winced as her voice carried. Her brother poked his head out of the room and raised a brow.
"No shit, but Tom is the best to go to for information. However, he is currently occupied." Draco sighed, leaning his head back and closing his eyes as his stomach growled.
Draco woke when the sun began its usual descent back down, he'd slept the day away which wasn't a bad thing, as he peeled himself off the hardwood floor. Once on his feet, he groaned his body sore from the floor, as he stretched out his long limbs, and apparated back towards the Leaky Cauldron, pulling his hood up as he stepped out of the shadows, he nearly swallowed his tongue as he watched Yaxley yanking Tom out from behind the bar with force. Draco inched back into the shadows and watched the scene unfurl. Yaxley looked furious, as he slammed the old wizard against the brick wall.
"How the bloody hell are we going to do that?" Draco asked, shock on his face. "The git doesn't let the snake out of his sight."
"I didn't know you were home!" He shouted, bouncing on his knees. He had grown a few inches in the time she'd been away, he was thin but it balanced his sharp features well.
Asteria stood at the dock, in between Krum and Potter, barely listening to the Headmaster. Her brother was in the Black Lake, and she had an hour to get him. But she actually had to get in the freezing water. She glanced down at her wetsuit and grumbled under breath. Potter glanced at her and shivered. But the others nearly fell into the water when the gong sounded, and they willingly jumped, all except Asteria, who pulled out her wand, and forcing barriers up, literally parted the water as she jumped, landing gracefully on the floor with a soft thud. She stalked forward and felt the eyes of the other champions, and the merpeople watch her as she walked to her brother, who was still floating in mid-air, she cut his rope and levitated him back towards the dock.
"Don't be like that." He smirked. "Asteria, after our time together over the summer, you can't say you don't miss me."
Three hours later, Asteria sat in her hospital bed and stared around her. Draco and Potter stood off to her right, Potter standing in a seemingly defensive form infront of Draco. Granger, Ginny, and Weasley sat in chairs infront of the bed; and Charlie, Tonks, Remus, Arthur, and Molly crowed the left side of her bed, and they were all glancing around, but Asteria, herself, had placed wards and charms to hide the conversation about to be had.
"I need to buy a new house," Asteria added, with a chuckle. "And of course, Harry, Draco you are welcome to live with me while you attend your final school year."
"Lemon Drops?" She asked, and the gargoyle moved, opening up the stairwell, she took their stairs two at a time, and came to the door, knocking on it gently.
"He's back!" Potter cried out, "Voldemort is back!" And suddenly people were rushing them, and as tightly as Asteria held onto Potter, someone pulled them apart.
"The Gaunt family..." Dumbledore paused and looked at her. "They stopped coming to Hogwarts a long time ago, believing the school had buried Slytherin's true hopes for the school he helped build. The Gaunt family was very disturbed. Years of inbreeding and isolation led to a family that was very dark.
"You don't understand! You aren't out there! You aren't doing anything!" Ron shouted, and was slammed against the glass of the door, but not by Draco, but by Bill.
"I'm going to start helping Draco, taking out Snatchers and Death Eaters before the final battle happens."
Asteria took a deep breath, and went to the door, softly opening it, and leaving the room, going towards the stairs. She wiped her eyes, ran her hand through her hair, and took some steadying breaths, as to not alert anyone to her emotional state, she plastered on her best fake smile and walked down the stairs prepared, already by the noise coming from the kitchen. She could do anything with a little acting.
She glanced to her left, down the staff table, Charlie sat next to Flitwick whispering animatedly. She had found some peace, speaking with a Mind-Healer once a week about everything that had happened in her life. Diagnosed with a severe case of PTSD, much like a lot of the people she knew, the healer had stated that no spells existed to treat said issue, but it was treated with other things, based on muggle technology. Asteria had teamed up with Granger to find some of those things, to begin using, repetitive therapy, and selective behavior treatments. Everyone who was struggling began similar treatments, and the generation of War Heros began to heal, each person cutting themselves off from the press, to avoid uncomfortable questions and inquiries. The Daily Prophet made an article on the War Heros and Heroines who had to take the time to heal before they could speak about all the things that had happened. Which gave everyone a chance to heal.
"Have you seen Harry?" Draco's voice sounded behind her and she felt her body tense up, as she looked back at her brother, and she shook her head. How could tell her brother that the love of his life was sacrificing himself to save them all?
After the situation at the Ministry, Draco apperated them to her Manor, where their mother followed. She had taken her daughter to the main bedroom, and they discussed all things until Charlie returned early the next morning, came barreling into the room, before skidding to a stop at the sight of mother and daughter curled up in the four-poster bed, fast asleep. He had left it at that and made them breakfast and coffee for when they woke up.
"They were, though I don't recognize the spell." Remus supplied as he brought over two vials of fresh potions. "They formed long criss-cross patterns along her skin."
"Potter, Happy late Birthday," She smiled, handing him the quidditch things she bought him, and he beamed at her. She reach in and grabbed two of the magical quills, and handed them to Granger, "Congratulations on making Prefect, Granger," the young witch smiled, and she turned to Ron, "And for you, Weasley, congratulations," Asteria said, pulling out the Nimbus 2002, she bought him, and his eyes sprung with tears, "Your mother asked me to get you a broom; she paid for most of it, I simply covered the last of it." Asteria smiled at Molly, "And don't worry about that Molly, I wanted to help with buying him the broom, it's a great accomplishment to become Prefect, I'm quite proud as well." She clapped Ron on the shoulder, "Now, I think I'll take my things upstairs to my room. It was exhausting out there today, honestly, I don't know how you've done it for your all your children all these years, Molly. You are truely the best kind of mother, I hope your kids realize just how lucky they are to have you, sometimes, I wish my mother did the things you do, it's beautiful to see real love between a mother and her children." Asteria said, touching her shoulder, and she saw tears brimming Molly's eyes, and she nodded, and let her slip up the stairs.
