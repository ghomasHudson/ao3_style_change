Draco inclines his head. His eyelashes flutter shut, and remain that way for a second longer than they should if he were as unaffected as he is trying to be. “Small mercies,” he says, without even a trace of bitter humour.
Harry inches his finger slowly in, all the while keeping his other hand on Draco’s cock and though it does hurt like hell, it feels better than Draco thought it could be. He closes his eyes and just lets himself feel, the burn, the pain and the overwhelming pleasure.
Scorpius realises. He’s alarmed by how disappointing it is.
Watching my parents fall apart.”
Draco’s flicks a confused glance at the scar on Harry’s head and then it strikes him suddenly. The resemblance between them.
He’s taken three weeks off work and he intends to spend them all sleeping.
“You’re very interested in my friends all of a sudden,” Harry says, a little petulantly. “Why should I tell you about them?”
It feels important, the weight of that admission. It feels heavier than Harry’s gait. He doesn’t know if he should pile on the burden, but he can’t help it, can’t hold it back.
“Not when I was a child. When I was in the Forest. During the Battle of Hogwarts.”
He would push Harry away and apologise, ask for a little space and catch his breath. He knows Harry would understand, would bring a hand to hover over his eyebrow before removing it and walking away, no touch of disappointment in his movements, understanding shrouding his eyes. He knows Harry and Harry is kind in unfathomable ways. But he can’t bring his hands to cooperate.
Instead he bends his head, and presses a soft, delicate kiss to the leaking tip of Draco’s cock. Draco bucks up with a startled gasp at the sensation– Harry’s soft lips touching him the most tender teasing he’s ever experienced in his life.
Harry looks at him and is almost surprised by the lack of embarrassment. “Yeah,” he says.
Blaise sees, of course he does. There’s no way to not see what Potter– even his name– does to Draco.
When it comes to India, it’s just as complicated as sex. In fact, the situation is ridiculously similar. He’s waiting for something, some sign or symbol or signal that he should plunge headfirst into something he had not even contemplated for the first seventeen years of his life. The Gryffindor in him is roaring with frustration and the cautious boy is reigning the lion in with wary questions and an unwillingness to take a step forward into the unknown without adequately safeguarding his heart.
On Mondays and Thursdays, Hermione drags Malfoy into Muggle cafés and museums, holing him up in libraries and exhibitions. She comes back home bright eyed and talks about whatever she’s seen and the headway they have made on educating each other as their first projects. Maybe their only projects if the proposal doesn’t go through but Hermione had been determined to make some actual progress while they figured out the technicalities of their paperwork. Even if it turned out to be unofficial progress.
Potter considers when Draco trails off, spluttering. “I’m not sure,” he admits.
“That doesn’t make it okay.”
“And there’s no going back.”
Just parents, loving and grieving and trying their best to hold on and let go of their son.
“Then what happened?” She asks, looking as confused as he feels.
“If my presence here is as pointless as you seem to think,” he says, shoving the notes he had taken out back into his bag, “Maybe you should have let Granger know. She’d have had the decency to cancel.” He moves to get up when he hears Potter sigh.
Draco doesn’t look at him when he snaps out, “Anything else you require, Potter?”
“You could come with us,” Ron says. Hermione nods against his shoulder.
Potter saved me from Fiendfyre, Potter spoke at my trial, Potter took me out for drinks, Potter came with me to Italy, and then Potter became Harry. He doesn’t know how to convey any of that in a manner that does not make this sound incomprehensible and ridiculous, so he shrugs.
“As friends!” Potter rushes to clarify, once he realises what asking someone to a Ball implies, the dunderhead.
Draco stares. His words have escaped him. He opens his mouth but he has been stunned into total silence by this revelation. Finally he breathes, “Harry wants it?”
Ah, the inevitable question.
“What about half-bloods?” Harry asks.
“I am no mistress,” Draco had said, swallowing around the choking feeling in his throat.
Harry gets up, stretches his legs, raises his arms above his head and swings them around before clutching at his arse and wincing slightly. His tailbone is sore from sitting in one position for quite so long and he can’t feel his thighs. Just as he grips his arse tighter, trying to relieve some of the soreness, the conversation stops and Harry looks down to see both Malfoy and Hermione staring at him.
Now, in the darkness, fingers tracing absent patterns onto each other’s skin, thoughts racing and catching up, and tangling, perhaps, there is peace.
“Learn,” he says, finally. Draco finds himself the startled recipient of the full weight of Potter’s stare. “Change, grow, whatever. Rehabilitate. Not be… who you were.”
If only he’d listened.
It’s easily fixed, and no one who doesn’t peer at the strange animal motifs will notice anything out of place, but the simmering tension coiling in his gut as Draco’s cool indifference comes back to him does not disappear.
It’s a letter from Granger– a typical, brusque missive that might be expected of the woman.
Harry’s hands are wandering, with less purpose than they’ve ever had. They trace the jut of his hips, they cup his jaw and Draco shudders at the touch of the warm, calloused palm against the sharp contours of his face. They slide down Draco’s side, and he smiles into Harry’s mouth at the sensation and his head spins when Harry smiles back.
And Draco had chosen him.
“You need help,” Luna says matter of factly. “And before you object and tell me it’s unnecessary, I’m going to give you a rundown of exactly what you did today so you know to what extent this has gone.”
“It’s alright,” he tells her. “I’m not too tired, I barely sleep anyway. I’ll stay awake and if anything happens, I’ll wake you up.”
Harry gets angry sometimes. They pick fights over small things and end them over larger declarations of vulnerability and hurt. Draco goes blank sometimes, the cynicism he inculcated as a survival tactic resurfacing to rip his progress to shreds. Harry doesn’t allow it, stitching his reformation back with quips and cutting comments and patience flavoured with gentleness. Draco learns to seek him out when the precipice feels too close and Harry learns the best ways to walk them both backwards.
Another reminder of his inadequacy when it comes to being a friend.
“Sorry,” he says, as gracefully as he can. His voice breaks on the word. “I was distracted. I thought I saw something behind you.”
So Potter doesn’t know about that haunted admission.
“Hey,” he asks, once satisfied, the hints of a smile playing along the edges of his lips. “Less drunk?”
Before he can follow through with that plan, Draco’s voice, rough with desire washes over him.
“Where are you going?” Draco asks. The words come out rushed, tripping over each other in a badly practiced dance, as though this combination has never been rehearsed by Draco’s silver tongue. “Why do you need to—?”
“Don’t get me wrong, being dead at sixteen is a better fate than being a Death Eater at sixteen trying not to fail. Being dead at sixteen is all I hoped for when
‘I think we need to come up with a safe word before we do this,’ Draco says, mouthing at the sweat slicked skin of Harry’s shoulder.
Draco shrugs.
The Hallows were loose ends. Tying them up was more complicated than the vaults, but it’s fascinating what a few favours and a little goodwill will do for you.
That thought is a shortcut to flashbacks, the memories of the Manor, of one too many
“What changed?” Hermione asks quietly.
“We will not dance,” Harry tells Draco, hands on his hips. His hair is falling into his eyes, he’s got a five-o-clock shadow and an exasperated expression Draco would love to kiss right off.
“The Christmas Ball, Draco. The one in three weeks, the one McGonagall has continuously been talking about. Who are you taking?”
Draco was so broken before he met Harry. Not Harry Potter, but this Harry who cracks terrible jokes across diner tables and talks him down from his anxious highs, Harry who chews his bottom lip when he writes his friends letters, Harry who sleeps curled into the space between his shoulder and his throat every night. Dating doesn’t seem a big enough word to hold what they are together. Dating bursts at its seams when Draco tries to imagine shoving themselves into its constraints, like an overstuffed pillow groaning under the weight of too much cotton and belligerence.
Harry smiles and lets go of Draco’s cock, only to swirl his finger around the slit that is now leaking precome on Harry’s stomach. Harry thrusts up again and Draco cries out, driving his nails into Harry’s hips.
From the iteration of the event in the papers and his relentless interrogation of Hermione and Blaise on his bad days, he knows the facts of the case just fine, but he wishes he could remember how Harry and Draco had acted around each other in those months of silence during the trial.
It’s almost all overwhelmed by black as his vision tunnels further and then it turns abruptly grey. If he weren’t in limbo between where he was and where he is, the grey would be soothing. It’s beautiful, the colour of storm clouds on a day made for staying indoors, the colour of Hermione’s soft sweatpants and Ron’s favourite coffee cup.
‘Alright,’ Draco murmurs, stilling his movements. ‘Just know that it’s okay to withdraw consent at any point. Use the safe word if you need to and everything stops.’
Draco nods, bewildered. Harry’s grin widens and says, “Your prostate. Say hello.”
And then he gently slides his finger along the slit, making draco squirm and moan. “Or would you like to be fucked? It takes more getting used to, but it could be better sometimes. Fucking is all about flying. Taking it feels like an extended moment of catching the snitch. Feeling that flutter in your palms. Feeling it jerk and twitch and knowing you have it, knowing you’ve won. That intense, beautiful feeling, that’s what taking it feels like.” His hands ghost down the length of Draco’s shaft. “That first slide in feels painful, hurts like hell. But there’s this moment, this moment when it just fits in and you feel so full, so deliciously full that you can’t imagine living without the added pleasure. Without the feeling of being connected to that person at a level so intimate and so,” he leans in close and whispers, “so incredibly filthy that you want to keep going till the end of time.” He quickens his pace, “It hits your prostate and it sends shockwaves up your spine and into your entire body, travelling from your arse to your arms to your thighs, to your cock. You can feel it coming, feel the pleasure cresting, feel the pain and the beauty of it right through to the moment when you can’t hold back anymore, the screams, the moans, the clenching and tensing and falling back.”
“No. I thought I would go back to Hogwarts to repeat seventh year but I didn’t think I would be welcome.”
Harry’s smile is bright in the dimness.
“There appears to be a wide chasm between being an upstanding member of wizarding society and being a decent fucking human being,” Harry snarls. “And if you wish to take even a single step in the direction of bridging that fucking gap, you’ll put me on the stand and let me tell the Wizengamot that Malfoy was a child when half this shit went down.”
“If I’m amenable? Merlin, Malfoy, I’m so much more than
The receptionist looks among the three of them and lets him know that there are no more extra rooms. Draco offers to put Parkinson up somewhere else, but she acquires a look so terrified on her face at the prospect of being left somewhere alone that Draco eventually sighs and throws his hands up.
He knows she’d been thankful she was dying when it had finally happened. Malfoy vanity is unparalleled, but Black vanity is unsurpassed.
“Nor do we, mate,” Scorpius says, gloomily. “For instance, Father knows she wants to shag him, and that she’s probably a shit therapist, and he also knows he won’t ever sleep with her, but he’s flirting anyway.”
“I didn’t know,” Harry repeats, still sounding lost and broken. “I really didn’t know.”
He pretends it has nothing to do with not being able to look himself in the eye and face everything he said–
The drink almost comes back up, but Potter’s expression smooths over before the mood can sour further. “You will have to come back to Britain,” he says, voice giving away none of his true thoughts on the subject of Draco’s Mark though Draco is certain any of his harsher guesses will land close enough. “People will care here.”
Malfoy doesn’t look up.
“Uncivilised barbarian.”
Draco snorts. “When it comes to you, Potter, when have I ever bothered to be polite?”
They had seen him in tatters, shreds of a real person and instead of running or leaving, they had stayed and fixed up not only him but also the mess he made. Of his people and of his home. A lump rises in his throat as he watches the two of them sleep, chests rising and falling in unison. Draco raises a hand in his sleep and brushes away a stray lock of hair from his forehead and all Harry wants to do is pick him up, take him to bed, tuck him in, kiss his forehead and when it is time, wake him slowly, with his mouth on his dick.
“Get on with it, Potter. We do have all day but I’d much rather not waste it.”
Dumbfounded, Harry stares at him, his eyes wide and terrified.
“No. But please, please don’t disregard what Hermione was telling you just because I said what I did.” Then he seems to rethink his words before he asks, “What was she talking about anyway?”
That voice, that intensity. The thinly masked rage. He doesn’t know how long a measly door will hold Potter back in a mood like this.
“Oh,” Malfoy says, embarrassed. “I’m sorry, I didn’t know—”
Two days after Potter’s visit (which he still can’t trust himself to classify as illusion or reality- which is unfortunate given that he sent Granger a letter of appreciation already), Draco receives an owl. It’s a Ministry owl which shoots him frequent disapproving glares and reminds Draco uncomfortably of great-aunt Alexandra. He hands it a couple treats and with one last look laced with disgust, it takes the treat, hoots loudly enough to startle Draco and disappears before he has had time to open the envelope and read the contents, forget composing a reply.
It hits the wall and the sound of shattering glass fills the emptiness of the flat and for a brief, blissful moment, the pounding stops.
“Look Potter,” he says, suddenly weary. “I know you’d rather be with your friends or be by yourself in India or wherever else you want to go, or back in Britain with your girlfriend. You don’t have to stay here with some pathetic charity case of a failed Death Eater to assuage your survivor’s guilt or whatever it is that made you come up with this mad plan. You can go back.”
As a child, Draco had wrapped himself up in those curtains, pretending they were draperies. Sitting on the floor, the soft fabric of legends told in art caressing him, Italian sunlight bathing his surroundings in golden light, Draco had thought he’d found heaven. He’d woven countless stories, adventures and tales about the people he saw in them, knights and statues and long-haired women and creatures that looked like woodland nymphs. He’d been the hero in all of them, and now, in the idyllic room left to him by fanciful ancestors, Draco knows why it had been so easy.
“Yeah.”
Draco frowns. “If I call her Weasley, how would one know which one I’m talking about?”
“I’m Draco Malfoy,” Malfoy says, after a few beats silence. “Nice to meet you, Potter.”
Perhaps it is privilege, perhaps it is brattiness, perhaps it is entitlement—but Draco has always found a certain amount of solace in blaming the universe for his circumstances.
Scorpius buries his face in his hands and groans. “Do you have any idea how bloody awful it is to die and still not know what happens after Death?”
He groans, “Mione! I’m not going over to say I’m anything.”
“Good.”
Before the chairs came, before the bed, before the time Scorpius couldn’t get up without the help of magical levers or canes or stabilising potions, Aunt Hermione had asked him why he wasn’t more bitter. It had been in the hospital, on their third visit to the Healer after his diagnosis, when Harry and Draco weren’t looking at each other in the waiting room. She had given them a look when she had walked in, summoned by Scorpius’ discreet owl– a look so blatantly disgusted that even Draco Malfoy turned away.
“Was that not alright?” Harry asks, concerned when he sees Draco’s face.
Harry’s lips are soft, slightly bitten and slightly swollen but so beautifully perfect that Draco knows he can stay caught in this moment forever. If lightning was to strike him down right at this second, he would die the happiest man on earth. He nips slightly at Harry’s full lower lip and drinks in his startled gasp. He tastes like pancakes and it is everything Draco has been dreaming of.
Harry smiles a little, relating to the expression all too well.
Scorpius doesn’t remember the case that ripped his family apart.
“We just want to listen in on what Hermione and you have to say,” Potter shrugs.
“Arse.”
A hand on his shoulder startles him terribly. He looks around to see Ron standing behind him, a patented glare fixed on his face. He lowers his eyes to the ground, hoping Ron doesn’t shout at him here because that would wake up the two of them on his couch but also expecting a dressing down, a reprimand, a falling out with his best friend.
It’s definitely not his fault that he is now being tortured by thin walls that do absolutely nothing to disguise the sound of Potter’s pleased, choked-off moans as he wanks.
“So what you propose is a curriculum for children ensuring when they reach Hogwarts they are of the essentially same magical and muggle background regardless of blood status?” Malfoy asks, chewing his lower lip.
Those words, Merlin, those words.
“You’re awfully knowledgeable about Muggle history,” Potter says, his surprise dripping off his words. Draco wonders for a minute whether he ought to be offended or not. He figures it’s warranted.
“Is this not the right way to go about apologising?” He asks eventually, unsure of how to take her expression. It isn't one he has encountered on her usually expressive face.
Maybe he could travel.
“I don’t think I feel much about them anymore.” He pauses with a grimace. “To be honest, I thought they were… animals before." He winces at how that comes out but soldiers on through the truth,"They were inferior, lesser beings. Like House Elves and Goblins. But now, after the Muggles in our cellar, after I heard them talk among themselves… they were just like us. They were terrified and they were scared of magic but they-” He doesn’t know how to say it. “There was a Muggle family in our cellar for a few weeks. Parents and their five year old daughter. He killed them of course, in time. But when I took them food and water at night, the father, he… he would whisper stories to the girl. He would talk about strange Muggle fairytales, sweet ones and he would comfort her every time she cried.” He stops, the words tangling in his throat. He remembers standing outside the cell, quietly, listening to the story himself. It was a winding tale about a princess who went to sleep for a hundred years. He remembers crying, trying to be as soundless as possible as the man told the child her mother had gone to sleep for a while.
”Ehm… yeah”, Harry says awkwardly.
In less than twelve hours, he gets to leave this horribly dull place forever.
”Ready, Harry?” Lockhart says in a stage whisper and brandishes his wand with a dramatic flair.
come up with something then!”
that has his husband round on him incredulously.
”As there is little foolish wand-waving in this class, many of you will hardly believe this is magic and I don’t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of ensnaring the senses… I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death —
Draco’s eyes darken. “Everything,” he says, and Harry wonders, for one spectacularly wild moment if anyone back home in Britain is imagining in their wildest dreams that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy are about to spend the night together.
“I agree,” Hermione says, sounding frustrated, “but we do have to first have a plan of the whole thing before we get down to the details. We can’t simply set everything in stone now, it has to be flexible.”
”Want to go for a fly after breakfast?” he asks Draco eagerly.
, Mister Potter, but apparently you’re still nothing but a naughty, evil little liar… let’s see if another week’s worth of detentions will do the trick!”
”Yeah, of course… Come on…”
”Don’t you dare, Dumbledore!” Remus hollers. ”
Finally, they come apart again, both of them breathing heavily and smiling like idiots… But Harry doesn’t care what he looks like, because he feels
”Shh!” Madam Pince hisses from the Magical Beasts Section.
”Unbelievable”, Draco mutters when Lockhart praises Granger for getting full marks.
”There’s a spell —”
”Somewhere big enough to fly…”
”Oh… yeah…” Harry croaks. ”I suppose.”
”And you said Lucius Malfoy grabbed Draco and the two of them Disapparated?” Granger cuts in, still scribbling away on the parchment.
”What, now you want to invite Pansy
”Other than that, life at Hogwarts is pretty much back to normal”, Harry writes, only feeling a small twinge of guilt considering he’s not lying
Neither of his dads have seen him play an actual, real game before. Mainly because he’s only ever played one. Back in Second Year he played against Gryffindor and caught the snitch despite his arm being broken, winning the match. Sirius had actually planned to come and see that game, but he’d been called in to work at the last minute and couldn’t make it and Harry isn’t sure what excuse Remus had given him at the time, but now he knows that he’d still been recovering from the full moon.
”This is a bit paler than some of the other ones I’ve seen actually”, Harry says, frowning at the phial. ”I hope there’s nothing wrong with it. If Slughorn gave us another version that’s been tampered with I swear…”
their son’s arm like the
In fact, the dormitory looks almost exactly like his own, with a massive window in the far wall and big four poster beds lined up on either side of it — except there’s five of them, not seven, and instead of the murky, dense darkness of the depth of the lake outside the window, a spattering of stars can be seen on a patch of actual night sky.
”Okay? Why?”
”Don’t be silly”, Remus says immediately and tears his eyes away from the window again. ”Stay. Finish your coffee.”
He’s riding on the back of an eagle owl, soaring across the bright blue sky, the breeze cooling his skin… A hill rises up in front of them and on top of it stands a house covered in ivy. The owl plummets and soars in through a broken window on the top floor of the house, then continues to fly through the house, until they reach a dark room at the very end of the gloomy passage. The windows in this room are all boarded up.
”But I have no doubt that you’ll manage”, Snape continues smoothly and lets his gaze wander away from Harry again, to linger instead on Seamus. ”As long as you
He curls up in bed and lies awake for a while, listening to the muffled noises of the party while thinking about what happened between him and Draco in the Prefect’s Bathroom. When he finally drifts off into sleep, it’s with a small smile on his lips.
”, Professor Snape continues with determination, ignoring Sirius outraged exclaim. ”
”DEATH”, Professor Trelawny exclaims dramatically.
Wrenching the front door open, Sirius hurtles inside. But he has barely stumbled across the threshold, when the sight of his best friend —
”Well, what do you want to do about it?” Harry counters. ”Organise a protest?”
And before he can tell Draco
He can feel hands on him and realises he’s manages to get himself twisted up in the bed-hangings and Draco is trying to free him. He stops moving around immediately, gasping for breath and in the next moment, the hangings come away and he stumbles out of bed and land in an ungraceful heap at the blonde’s feet. He retches, and the feet jump back startled.
”He’s dreamy”, Daphne mutters and then starts giggling with Pansy again.
”No — IT’S TIME —!”
Harry nods silently. It feels so bizarre, like something taken from a dark fairytale. Not something that a bunch of Hogwarts students would get up to in their spare time between classes and revision. He plays with the idea of himself and his friends doing something similar.
”Okay!” Harry exclaims happily and hurries over.
” Harry hears Remus calling for him.
”And what if whatever hurt it finds us first?” Draco demands, but there’s a quiver of fear in his voice.
”It tastes foul”, Harry mumbles.
unfair?” Harry demands. ”You were four against one—!”
”How does that work, will you teach it to me?” Harry asks hopefully.
Once they have all gathered around her in the snow, the witch tells them her name is Professor Grubbly-Plank and she is their temporary Care Of Magical Creatures teacher while Hagrid is indisposed… She then  leads them around the paddock where the huge Beauxbatons horses stand shivering in the cold January air, the fumes from their Single Malt Whiskey wafting towards the students as they trudge past and continue towards the edge of the forest, where a unicorn is tethered to a tree.
”Yeah. They’ve left the Pyrenees now and are heading back to Britain. Narcissa probably won’t let Draco visit me before school starts anyway, though…”
Snape stands up with such speed, Harry flinches. The man’s eyes are flashing furiously.
”That’s… none of your concern”, Snape mutters with a forced calm, negated sligthly by the agitated look in his eyes.
”Yes, well”, Snape snaps. ”Dumbledore?”
”Do you realise how
Remus wrenches his arm out of Sirius’ grasp and throws the shards of glass he’s carefully gathered up against the sink with such force that half of them bounce right out of it again. Harry jumps, staring in fear as his daddy’s hands curl into fists in his hair and he more or less collapses into his seat again, hyperventilating quietly.
And even weirder than that, another shape is floating in mid-air next to him. Harry squints at it. It looks like that pompous gryffindor ghost Nearly-Headless Nick, except… Except he isn’t pearly white and transparent like a ghost should be. He’s solid and burned to a cinder. He’s even smoking slightly.
He can’t help but notice that she’s very careful not to get any blood on her many rings when she grips his hand, but as soon as their hands touch, Harry’s thoughts are immediately distracted by a searing pain — not in his hand, but the scar on his forehead — and he gasps and snatches his hand back again, stumbling to his feet.
”I just wanted to say… I like you.”
It’s not until he’s served the breakfast and taken the seat opposite Harry that Remus looks up and meets his eyes again. Harry feels another twinge in his chest and it takes all of his self-control to not look down… the worry in his daddy’s eyes is mixed with disappointment now, and Harry feels awful… angry Remus, as scary as he is, would be so much easier to deal with…
Harry tunes out the old witch’s musings after a while, when it becomes clear that she’s not paying enough attention to him to see whether he’s actually listening or not, and stares out the window instead… He thinks about his daddy’s mysterious travels that he’s apparently still too young to know the reason for… He thinks about Nicholas Flamel the alchemist and where he might have read his name, since he’s not in the habit of reading books about alchemy… He thinks about Draco…
starts to play out in his mind…
remember that… I thought she was going to peck me!”
”You alright, Harry?” Sirius adds when the two other wizards have turned back to the cookbook. ”You look like you had a rough night…?”
you’re referring to, but if it turns out to be in the realm of bad ideas I will be sure to back out of it…” he intones and gives her a grin.
”Oh, apparently Skeeter is an unregistered animagus, which I guess is illegal”, Harry shrugs.
”But…?” Dumbledore prompts gently.
”Don’t worry about it, Harry”, Remus mutters.
Harry blinks.
”Okay”, Draco says happily. ”Let’s do that then!”
”—Yet”, Blaise repeats with an appeasing nod towards the blonde. ”It
, he tells himself sternly and scans his notes…
”Are you all right?”
Lucius finally breaks the eye-lock and stares at the ground in front of him instead. Something resembling resolve seeps into the cloudy grey. His knuckles whiten around the silver top of his walking stick… Harry remembers the weight of it on the back of his neck, as Lucius used it to shepherd him and Draco towards the Stadium at the Quidditch World Cup… that seems like a different lifetime now…
”That’s a good idea”, Narcissa says with another incline of her head, before she turns to Draco and places the tips of her fingers gently on top of his shoulder. ”Draco darling, why don’t you take Harry to Florean Fortescue’s for an ice cream… Mr Lupin and I will join you shortly.”
”What do you think?”
”I don’t want to t—”
”I already know how to cast a Shield Charm”, he says loudly, leaning back comfortably in his chair and giving Diggory an expectant look as the young man falters mid-sentence and swivels his eyes over to meet his.
been some interesting developments already—”
Harry doesn’t know what to say to that, so he just pulls a sympathetic face and knocks his shoulder against Draco’s.
”What’s going on?” Harry asks cautiously.
He dozes off for a while and the next time he blinks his eyes open, Remus is sitting on the edge of his bed, reading the same book he had his nose buried in during the train journey from Hogwarts. Two mugs of hot chocolate are steaming under a stasis charm on Harry’s bedside table and the sweet smell makes Harry’s tummy grumble softly.
“Would you like me to explain why I think I am here?” Death asks, breaking him out of his pensive thoughts and Scorpius looks up startled.
“What did you just say?” He asks her, feeling his eyes widening. “I called you an arse,” she says, not looking up. “It’s not that surprising, surely?”
To realise his breaths are laboured, and his throat is aching, and his palms hurt from where his nails have dug in.
The words die on his dry, bloodied lips, festering like poison in the spaces between his teeth, when her eyes roll back. She slumps forward, neck lurching at an awkward tilt, body shielding Lavender’s from the rest of the prying world. She lies there, silent and still, more blood pooling around her feet, soaking the steps in the stench of death.
Then he thinks—
“Alright,” he says, quietly. “Alright.”
When they break away from each other, Harry’s eyes are shining and his lips are kiss-swollen. In that moment, Draco knows Harry has never looked more beautiful.
Instead of answering, Granger stops her stirring and looks up at him. Her face is flushed from the cauldron heat and her eyes are watering from the pungent fumes indicating her potion is brewing properly.
He blinks at her. The simmering anger that surges and pulses beneath his skin, in his veins and arteries, in the blood coursing through them, threatens to overwhelm him again. He suppresses it with effort, grits his teeth and bites out, “Not a word of what I said was a lie.”
She barks out a laugh. “I assure you, I’m not. I think I’d go stark raving mad if I had to be cooped up in Grimmauld all day, everyday. No, I’ve been helping George out at the shop, learning to cook from Mum, this and that, you know.”
“Goes back to the Medieval times,” Draco says, gesturing towards the archways. “The Muggle parts attract tourists from all over. The wizarding part is smaller, more reserved. The Malfoy villa is there.”
After an inordinate amount of time has passed, Harry starts feeling uneasy. It has been half an hour, maybe more and a nagging thought at the back of his mind makes him get up and unlock the door with magic.
He fails.
word you said was unfair,” she says, eyebrows drawn together, the corners of her lips turned down.
Right now, the two arcs of his thought collide, combine, thread themselves together into a bittersweet surge of melancholy for everything that could have been and everything that is.
“Would you mind terribly if I apparated you, Malfoy?”
“What is it I’m supposed to do?” he asks instead.
He looks at Potter and he knows his voice is shaking because the words come out strangled, “I–I can’t.”
He looks like he went flying into a chest of drawers and rooted himself out of the wreckage.
They’re sitting by the Lake because Hermione is talking to McGonagall about her potential in different career fields and while Draco is trying to write his Charms essay, Potter is throwing stones into the lake, watching the water ripple.
“There’s one about the Gryffindor Boys Dormitory Orgy. I don’t think the details people seem to know are quite right,” Potter shrugs.
“Would you mind if I partnered with you today?” she asks, speaking so quickly that Draco thinks she’s speaking another language initially. “Harry isn’t coming to class and I don’t think we can brew Trisstesia by ourselves. It’s the sort of thing that needs a partner.”
“I came here because France is buzzing with Saint Potter’s birthday and there are banners in every wizarding neighbourhood proclaiming the joy they feel at the knowledge that the Saviour has lived another year,” Parkinson says. “I trust that you understand Britain will be…”
Of course there is guilt, stark and black against his pale forearm, a hideous mangled scar of a war Draco fought with himself as much as he did with the classmates he saw growing up.
Kingsley nods, and Dench waves a Sonorus Charm at Draco’s thought. Despite it, his voice comes out feeble, starved, thready like a fading pulse.
Healer Choudhury is a small witch in beige robes with a kind face who smiles reassuringly at Draco when he calls. When he explains the situation, the smile drops and she looks grave. “Oh dear, I’ll be in in a minute. Tell Hermione I’m on my way, won’t you?”
“Thank you,” he says, unsure how to to convey your mouth around my dick was the best I have felt in my entire life and I never want it to stop.
“I want you buried deep in my arse when I come,” Draco informs him, raising an eyebrow. “If of course, you’re… amenable to that,” he amends.
He doesn’t make heads turn, but Draco’s eyes can’t move away, fixating on the way Potter’s resting expression appears to be a subconscious smile.
“My mistake,” Scorpius had said, poking him in the arm. “Files can’t kiss you
Hermione laughs and says, “Either you order takeaway or you cook it, I’m not trying again.”
“That’s…” he swallows, “That’s where the Killing Curse hit me.”
The words catch him off guard. Blaise’s almost mocking mistress and definitely mocking gay lover echo in his head. Ironic, that Ginevra should be offering him more dignity than even his best friend did.
When Harry’s fingers start to feel numb from the rapid writing and the chicken scratch on the paper appears to barely be legible, he casts a glance at Malfoy and Hermione still passionately discussing the merits of history lessons on the medieval age in both Muggle and Wizarding culture and decides he has had enough for the day.
“What do you even care about my comfort?” Scorpius asks, banging his hand against the cabinet door he’s leaning into. When it doesn’t make a sound, he stifles the urge to scream till he’s hoarse. He’ll never be hoarse, and screaming into a void for all eternity does indeed sound more like the hell he’d thought he might go into on an off-chance. Now that he hasn’t (or at least is being told he hasn’t), self inflicted misery sounds a little… pointless. “I’d be comfortable not watching my father drink himself into alcoholism and a pot belly or watch my other father punch the walls into submission, but here I am, and here you are.”
“Bit hypocritical, Malfoy,” she says.
“You just—”
Harry’s waiting outside the Great Hall with Hermione and Weasley whom Draco is seeing after almost seven months. The last time Draco saw Weasley was in May when he’d been wearing tattered clothes, face covered in soot, grime and blood. Now he looks transformed, standing beside Hermione in black robes. Auror training has clearly done wonders for him and Hermione seems to share this opinion if her smitten and rather awe-struck expression is anything to go by.
Familiarity. Stability. Hope in something bigger than yourself.
Nothing.
She seems, for lack of a better word to describe how bizarre the situation is, kind. “You could have sent an owl,” Draco says after a few seconds of dumbfounded staring at her open expression, trying to gauge the plot she must be concealing because surely, Hermione Granger is not calling him to Sunday brunch for social niceties. He comes up with nothing. Granger looks as earnest as Godric Gryffindor himself– Draco finds it hard to laugh in her face at the mere concept of ‘meeting’ though it is what he wants to do.
“Bottle’s almost empty. How long have you been taking it?”
Potter looks at him, head cocked a little thoughtfully. “You’re not disagreeing.”
“Okay,” Draco says, and he still sounds a little unconvinced but it’s a few steps in the direction of progress from the standpoint of absolute denial so Harry counts it as a victory.
So when he finds himself climbing the spiral staircase with tears spilling down his cheeks, he knows its probably one of the worst ideas he’s had in a while.
After a minute, he feels the bed dip beside him and Draco is rubbing something that smells nice and feels like heaven into the bruise he knows is forming.
Neville had sighed.
Scorpius shakes his head. “It’s been a while since they even shared the same bedroom.”
Hermione looks down and swallows. “But he’s alright.”
“Don’t you miss the Weaslett—Ginevra?” Malfoy asks. They’re at a pizza parlour, a dimly lit room with a sign outside which claims in broken English that they have the best pizza in San Gimignano.
Of course he knew magic had a smell. How could one not when they spent three nights a week with Harry Potter and his casual displays of wandless, wordless magic that thickened the scent of a crackling fire on a winter evening in the air? The blanket of that magic kept Draco warm when Harry would get up, pull on his robes, spell his messy hair clean and dry after an orgasm and say, “Later, Malfoy,” and leave without looking back.
. He has no shirt on, only a pair of casual pants that hang low on his hips like they’re about to fall off. No slippers. When he glances back up at Malfoy’s face, he notices the way his cheekbones stick out and his sunken eyes have settled somewhere close to the back of his skull. Malfoy has always been unnaturally… pointy but right now, his body seems to be only angles, nothing else. The skin beneath his eyes is a bruised purple and hangs in an ugly, unseemly way. His hair is a dishevelled, lanky mess, his skin so pale that his blond eyebrows seem too dark. He looks like a ghost and Harry takes a minute to absorb the fact that Malfoy, slick haired, snide, smirky Malfoy is even capable of looking like the apparition that stands before him. If he hadn’t known Malfoy was alone in this house, he would have probably thought this was someone else. If he hadn’t taken a moment to ascertain that this is actually Draco Malfoy (which is obvious after a careful look), Harry would have thought it was a ghost of some Malfoy ancestor.
“How do we know he isn’t doing it simply for personal gain?” A wizard with a hooked nose asks. He was one of those sceptical from the start to the finish.
“That was… probably worrying. And completely uncalled for. And I couldn’t warn you, it happened so suddenly—”
Draco’s eyes are blown dark. “That was…”
Which is why he doesn’t pay attention to when their conversation goes from Abraxan horses that his grandfather had specially made stables for in the barn to Harry’s hands on his buttons and his lips on his earlobe. He only realises that Harry is no longer touching him, no longer kissing down his sensitive, tingly ear when a draught passing through the windows touches on the exposed trails on his skin, cooling them in  fashion he isn’t particularly fond of.
The minute Harry steps back to let Draco through, he steps in and uses his slight height advantage to grab Harry’s face entirely by surprise. His eyes widen fractionally before Draco is brushing his lips across Harry’s, gently, tenderly, completely at odds with the bruising force with which he keeps ahold of his jaw. After one second of frozen surprise, Harry sighs just slightly against his lips before parting his lips delicately to let Draco’s tongue slip through. They push and pull against each other, Harry’s arms coming up to twine together at the nape of Draco’s neck and Draco’s grip loosening on Harry’s jaw but remaining possessively there none the less as his other hand brushes long fingers through Harry’s tangled hair.
, he thinks, bitterly, throwing his duffel down on the bed.
Draco has been avoiding him for a week, in the weird, condescendingly polite way Harry has only ever experienced firsthand from his uncle’s boss who once came over to Privet Drive and looked at him as though he were a potted plant instead of a human being.
rings like a gong through the fog of his brain. The buzz of chatter and the footsteps of people, the crush of tourists and locals fade into background noise. Behind the sunglasses, Malfoy’s eyes are wide.
He doesn’t say anything, but he does spell the door unlocked and grits his teeth when the handle snicks and the heavy wood creaks open.
“I know,” Malfoy says. “But she doesn’t. She saw you speak for me, saw you speak for her, heard you sent a written recommendation for Theo and so she—” He hesitates and says in a carefully blank voice, “She hoped.”
When Draco looks back at him, there’s something so pained in his expression that Harry feels his heart break.
It isn’t often that he understands Pureblood traditions, but on some days he understands the sentiment behind some of them.
of it—”
“My other father,” Scorpius says, feeling gently perplexed. Merlin, they must be from somewhere else. “Harry Potter. For Merlin’s sake, don’t you know
Draco is… ‘youngest of Voldemort’s loyal supporters, otherwise known as Death Eaters’.
“She said no,” he says. Well, then. That’s awkward, isn’t it?
One of the last broken promises.
Harry grins.
It’s criminally impressive and Harry can’t quite decide whether he hates it or loves it, so he settles on a combination of both.
push it down.
Draco lets one hand slide from Harry’s shoulder, down the sweat slicked planes of his back to the dip of his spine, back up again, to the short, fine hairs of his nape. He buries his hand in the curls at the base of Harry’s neck, twisting and pulling as Harry pushes in at an agonising pace.
“Yes, Harry, Draco Malfoy. Hermione said you both have become some sort of friends. He was here for what happened. Do you remember?”
Harry shrugs. There are people who don’t know about him and Ginny breaking up. There are people who do know and choose to wilfully ignore like Molly and on occasion, Ron. Harry prefers the former to the latter. It’s less messy.
Harry exhales and looks back out at the window.
The fight drains out of her. “I never—I don’t—”
In the safety of his own room where his expressions aren’t on display, Harry can admit, a little reluctantly to the fact that he’d have preferred the old Malfoy to this Draco. The snarls and the biting insults were well worn and safe territory—Harry knew how to give as good as he got. But this Draco is cool and collected and spares Harry nothing but a token survey every morning before leaving him to his own devices. If Harry packed his bags and left the next morning, he doubts Draco would notice.
“Will you be handing me the papers then?” Draco asks, breaking the hush. It’s sudden. Harry startles.
Harry pinches the bridge of his nose.
For the first time, the inevitability of what he is about to say seems overwhelming.
“If Harry doesn’t receive professional help soon, he may need to be institutionalised. For his own safety and that of others including yourself.”
“Ginny. You call her Ginevra. You call us all by our last names but you call her Ginevra.”
change, and this is one of them.
“…we need concrete plans before we present anything to the Council!” He is saying, voice rising slightly. Harry hasn’t registered what he was saying before that, having tuned out thinking of Malfoy but it sounds like Hermione and him are arguing.
Draco trips on his own feet and his satchel empties its contents all across the floor and when both him and Potter bend down to pick up the large quill lying at their feet, their foreheads bump hard.
“I think,” Harry says and his breath ghosts along Draco’s lips gently, “The only reason I had this much fun was because I went with you.”
Then–
There’s a whispered spell and a sweet vanilla smell scents the air. Another and Draco feels slightly dizzy and his belly cleaner.
“What that spell did.”
Potter looks rather interested. “I didn’t know you had that in mind,” he says.
When he’s walking to the dungeons, Granger catches up to him. She’s breathless and a little red in the face but her eyes are shining.
“I need to pack,” Harry repeats and Draco’s face falls. His lower lip trembles and his eyebrows furrow and his whole body curls in on itself. Harry figures there should at least be a little bit of pride to be found in reducing Draco Malfoy to this, but even as he searches the darkest, murkiest parts of himself, nothing resembling triumph surfaces. There is only disappointment.
She leaves.
“I’ll be moving out,” Draco says, by way of response. Scorpius can’t help the startled gasp that falls from his lips. He knows he doesn’t need to hold it back, not anymore, but the wince that accompanies the betrayal of his true emotions is automatic. If he had been alive, it would have been unforgivable.
It is Potter. He enters, looking entirely unsure of himself, hands shoved into the pockets of the Muggle trousers he insists on wearing, boots scuffing the floor.
“Am I to know?”
“If you don’t want to, I understand but my memories of this Lake aren’t that great and I would like to… rectify that. Will you show me?”
“You seemed to know what to do about it, don’t you know what it is?” He knows, he knows he is being a bastard, a right ungrateful, poncey one at that but he can’t help himself. The shame prickles under his skin, on the back of his neck, behind his eyelids.
Another one, to the apple of Draco’s cheek, butterfly soft. “How about this?”
‘Yes,’ Harry groans, letting his head fall back against Draco’s chest, allowing him better access to the tender juncture of his neck and collarbone.
Somewhere between killing the Dark Lord and ordering beers at the counter of a small but cosy pub in Shoreditch, the open book of his existence has slammed shut. The glimpses Draco catches of the man beneath the veneer of cheerful chivalry seem to be in a different language from the one Draco is fluent in.
“And now, I’m going to take that bottle out of your hands, give you a Sobering Potion, rub your back while you puke, make you take a cold shower and then put you to bed. Does that sound good?”
Arguably, also the worst, but like he really doesn’t think about that unless he’s having a bad day.
Hermione shoots him a suspicious glare but lets him pass by anyway to access the stares.
“A coffee couldn’t hurt,” he allows. Though he envies her, though he almost begrudges her the married bliss she enjoys with Harry, he doesn’t, he can’t hate her. Ginny Weasley is much too charming, much too forthright and much too witty to be hated by anyone.
“Are you homophobic?” Harry demands, jerking his hand back. If that’s something else he needs to deal with—
Harry presses another kiss to the inside of Draco’s lips. “This?”
“I’m glad,” Malfoy says, quiet and honest. After last night, it’s not as unfamiliar as it once would have been.
“Ron proposed,” he says. “To ‘Mione. In Australia.”
It had to be worth something, something great, something like his sanity or someone else’s life or an apology he could not avoid. Otherwise, the words avoided him as much as he avoided them. His thoughts were images, memories, fantasies. Not words. Never words. The moment they turned to words, he had what Granger had called them. Panic attacks.
The elf stares up at them, eyes wide and ears perked and says in a tremulous voice, thick with an Italian accent, “Is Master Malfoy truly being here or is Gianni being seeing things in his old age?”
“What was what?” Draco asks, cringing when his voice comes out dull and heavy.
They were all just people once, trying to live their lives, trying to work the kinks of their minds and complicated thoughts out through art. Somewhere in these streets, Michelangelo probably had his first kiss. And then, he had not been Michelangelo, world famous artist and sculptor, he had probably been a shy boy with a crush. Somewhere on these streets, Dante had probably tripped on a loose stone and cursed himself out to the shock of passersby.
A hangover does not hold a candle to writhing on the floor bloody and emptied from a cutting curse and Potter has seen him there, so really, there is no shame in this.
“We did,” Harry says. His voice breaks on the syllables. If Draco’s lost himself at sea, Harry is crashing on the jagged rocks.
“Today I asked him to go with us to the Weasleys. He hasn’t gone in months. And he got all cold and shut off. I kept asking… I kept asking why but he wouldn’t say. And I got frustrated and told him if he didn’t want to come, we’d go without him. And he…”
Instead of letting the secret hurt him further, he lets himself revel, just for a minute, in the moment, in the knowledge that he’s in the arms of the man he loves, being touched and kissed and pulled against a chest broad and firm and strong, beating with a heartbeat Draco hears in his own core.
“How do you take it?”
you make. Why are you cutting yourself off?”
“Dear Merlin, the bloody
“When did he do that?”
An opportunity, Kingsley had called it. A hideaway, Draco had taken it to mean.
Harry turns on him where they’re sitting, waiting at the Portkey office, behind five other bleary-eyed witches and wizards. “If you have something to say, spit it out,” he says, patience wearing thin.
name. He can do this. He can breathe, can’t he? He can breathe.
Eventually something softens in Harry’s rigid stance, and Draco releases the breath he’d been holding, afraid to even move wrong.
He can hear voices. Some sound like his mother’s, tinkling and cheerful, asking him to come home. Some like Sirius’, boisterous and tinged with mirth, repeating
“So where–” Harry begins, cutting himself off, when he doesn’t understand how to phrase his question better.
If they smell blood, they’ll be merciless.
Harry’s grip on his wand tightens as he leans against the doorframe.
“How were we?” Hermione asks, almost bouncing on her heels.
“What time do you think it is?” Harry asks.
The urge to give up is stronger than it’s been in a while, and a solitary tear escapes Draco’s eye and trickles down his cheek.
“The extra blankets in the cellar.”
He watches Harry hesitate in the middle of the bedroom, fully dressed with the leather pouch tucked into his pocket. For the first time this morning, he looks lost. Off kilter. Like a ship on high seas without a sail. His fingers flex in the air, and his hands reach for something– someone– who isn’t there.
And there is it again, the mocking derision. Draco’s temper flares hot.
Visit, visit, talk, call, visit, smile, talk, talk, talk.
“That’s not a real answer,” Pansy says.
Without a second thought, he pulls her against his chest as she clings to the front of his t-shirt and sobs softly, her body shaking. It takes him a moment to understand that the dampness against his cheek are his own tears soaking into her bushy hair.
“India?”
Granger frowns. “I don’t like you,” she says after a while, biting her lower lip. “I don’t like you right now and I don’t know if I ever will. But Malfoy, after what I saw, I can’t say I don’t respect you for living where you did. And for stepping out into Diagon Alley. And for not, not… giving up.”
The anxiety attacks are so frequent that Draco has forgotten how to separate them from his thoughts. Every time he thinks in words, every time he is conscious of his bend of mind, they spiral out of control. Initially he had been afraid but now, now he has learned to live with it. The shortness of breath, dizzying nausea, racing heartbeat, he greets them all like old friends. After all, he thinks slightly bitterly, it isn’t like he has
“I love you.”
Now, as he sits on his bathroom floor, exhausted and drained, he lets himself think. The Calming Draught in his system will keep him from more anxiety for a few more hours and Draco finally has the luxury to just think. About Granger’s proposal, about his own reactions, about Potter.
“I’m proud of you,” she says. “You said you didn’t feel happy or satisfied when you saw him like that and you reminded me that you’re still–” she pauses, searching for a word and settles on, “–our Harry. Mine and Ron’s.”
“Our grudge extends beyond the War, doesn’t it?” he asks her, raising a hand to his right cheek, a memory of being called a
There’s a trembling to Harry’s fingers that no Auror worth his salt should have. It’s an erratic, arrhythmic jerk that patters Harry’s fingers almost involuntarily against the firm leather. There’s a glint in his eyes that sends a phantom chill racing down Scorpius’ spine.
“That was more fun than I thought it would be,” Harry admits once they’re out on the grounds.
He leaves out everything that not being wanted dredges up, he leaves out the part where leaving will shatter his soul, he leaves out the part where all he wants to do right now is wrap Draco in his arms, fall back into bed and go to sleep without thinking of tomorrow and what fresh horrors it might bring. He leaves out that he was dying and all he could do was stare at a wall.
Draco slides it back across the table. It almost falls off, coming to rest on the edge.
“Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh Merlin fuck, fuck, fuck, I’m gonna, I’m gonna, Harry please, please, please please…”
They sit in silence for a few minutes. She sips her tea and Draco stares dispassionately at his hot chocolate. The mere thought of putting it to his lips makes him nauseous.
“The boy?”
Malfoy looks up, startled astonishment evident on his face.
, Draco thinks,
He turns around, and finds Harry standing in the doorway, nervous and fidgeting. He’s always like this on a Tuesday evening, after spending all of Sunday in the company of the Weasley brood, in Ginevra’s loving arms and Ronald’s backslapping. He’s always a little late on Tuesdays, uncertain and aggressive, taking and taking and taking and giving nothing back.
“It’s not your mother.”
When Harry’s tongue swipes across his bottom lip, Draco whimpers which Harry uses to deepen the kiss even further. There’s salvation in this kiss, Draco knows. There’s repentance and hope in every breath that ghosts across his skin, in every push of Harry’s tongue against his own.
“Art in general,” Draco says, closing his eyes and thinking of the way even a walk in an innocuous side street seems to brim with artistry and elegance in Florence. “But yeah, Michelangelo.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Draco says. And it’s a half truth, because while Draco knows what Potter might be suggesting– why the emotion? Why the sounds? Why the words and the comfort and the– but he doesn’t know why Potter’s asking him. He didn’t initiate this strange, slow pace, didn’t ask for Harry to treat him like a lover.
He turns, but Draco’s hand shoots out to grip his wrist.
do you talk to people, exactly?”
“Why didn’t you tell me?”
Before any of them can register that Malfoy has begun to speak, Harry has to bite his tongue from gasping in shock. A split second before he opens his mouth, the Glamour Malfoy had maintained so carefully from the start collapses and Harry sees the emaciated ghost he had seen in the Manor two days ago. Malfoy doesn’t seem to notice. Instead in a trembling voice he says, “I don’t think I can explain how sorry I am for those years. I was a child and that isn’t, isn’t an excuse but it is, it is an explanation. My father was… strong. No one went against him and when he told me something was right or told me I had to do something, to go against it was unthinkable. He spoke about the glory of the Dark Lord and I believed him. He said, he said Mud–Mudbloods were filthy and Muggles were the bane of our existence and I… believed him.”
“Malfoy, you’re a grown man. Do stop the sulking. And the damn pouting.”
Scorpius turns.
The shifting, watery features are suddenly solid, as though they’d been that way all along, and Scorpius gasps. Dominique Weasley is sitting in front of him, auburn hair done up in two French plaits. She looks just as he remembers her– full of youthful beauty, a smattering of freckles on her nose. He remembers her lying pale and still in the coffin, Fleur’s wrecked sobs and Bill’s trembling hands as they lowered her into the soil– Molly’s screams that she was only twelve.
“I’ll leave you to it, then.”
Something rears its ugly head in the pit of his stomach and he clenches his fist against the surge of annoyance and anger that rises up within him. He knows he shouldn’t be this angry over open curtains or with Hermione or about
New beginnings and all that.
He looks towards Death, and stares into the indeterminate eyes. If he takes them for what they are, they aren’t ever-changing or even multicoloured. They’re a swirling abyss of normalcy devolving into the madness of infinity. It starts off as an iris of speckled shades that narrows into a pinprick that isn’t black as much as a vacuum. If Scorpius looks into them for too long, the realities of infinity and time will break his mind.
Parkinson holds her hands up, adopting a deceptively innocent expression. “Thank me later,” she says, disappearing into Draco’s room. Draco stares when she slams the door in his face.
Harry grins. “Was it good?”
‘This,’ says Draco, letting one end of the coil drop from his hand so the whole thing unravels across the floor, ‘is a lot of fucking rope.’
“Now, if you’re good at what you do, when you fuck, you get the added pleasure of getting to watch.” He bites down, gently, almost lovingly and Draco has a feeling that by the end of today he is going to die. “You get to watch the way their eyes shutter closed, the way their mouth falls open, the way they,” he slides his hand down Draco’s stomach till he reaches the navel and strokes Draco across it with teasing, light touches, “scream, when you hit the right spot.” His hand goes lower, teasing, brushing, not quite touching. “The way they dig their nails into their palms first and then the sheets and then your back. Or maybe if they reach out and cling to the headboard.” His eyes are black, only a ring of green around the pupils.
“I could show you,” Potter says.
When he draws back, Harry’s eyes are closed.
Theodore Nott had been another underage Death-Eater, similarly acquitted of war crimes by Neville and Luna for participating in the Final Battle against the Death-Eaters. He had gone to Mungo’s a month after the War, complaining of severe chest pain but had been sent home with medication. Two weeks later he had been found dead in his bedroom.
He turns back towards the looming archway in front of them.
“If I’d have known she was coming…” Draco says and trails off when he realises there is no way he could end that statement without offending one or the other of them. “She’s not here for long, right?”
Draco brings the glass of smoking Firewhisky to his lips, and stares at the carpet. It needs a few cleaning spells, he thinks, staring at the dark hairs caught in the fur.
‘Potter, you giant wanker, I have to pack!’
Unspoken words, but they are louder, clearer, more of a declaration than anything either of them could ever phrase with sound and meaning.
Ron had been standing at the foot of the bed, wand limp in his hand, murmuring, “Harry’s going to wake up, it’s a trick, he’s going to wake up, kill You-Know-Who, he will wake up, he’s not actually dead, not actually dead.”
A tentative smile creeps on to Malfoy’s face, tugging on his lips.
“I’m not going to be a dick about it.”
Best wishes, Hermione.
Draco realises Potter is avoiding him when he doesn’t turn up at the Manor on both Wednesday and Friday.
“Draco’s fine,” he says, meeting her eyes with a curt nod. “But if you don’t feel comfortable calling me that if I call you Ms. Richards, Mr. Potter-Malfoy would be acceptable.”
Her world famous Saviour husband rising in the Auror ranks, being groomed for either Minister or Head Auror.
Their lips fit against each other and the last coherent thought Draco is capable of is a fervent thanks to Salazar that Harry didn’t wear his fucking spectacles today before he’s overwhelmed by
When Potter attends Potions, which is a scarce occurrence, Granger partners with him. Draco isn’t hindered by that, he’s more than competent at chopping his own ingredients and grinding blackberries hardly ever requires another person.
Except, one month after Scorpius’ seventh birthday, Harry had arrested Selwyn, dragged him out of the house in shackles with a murder charge to his name and an allegation that he was attempting the resurrection of Voldemort.
Harry cuts himself off, but Draco’s heard enough.
‘Please, Draco, I c-can’t.’
“Of course,” the woman murmurs. Her gaze turns assessing, honing into the slightly unfocused nature of Draco’s rambling. He doesn’t seem to notice. “Where did this one start, then?”
“To be honest,” Draco admits, “I was expecting worse.”
“If you’re about to say I don’t need to talk about it, you can stop there. Don’t finish the sentence.”
“But you have those views?”
Harry starts laughing again. “If I tell you when I had the time, I think you might get up and walk away.”
“Who the bloody hell is Anthony Filibuster?” Harry had asked, turning the circle of Draco’s arms with a snort.
Malfoy dutifully puts the elf down after a moment and the disoriented creature blinks twice before bowing deep enough to touch his nose to the ground.
He finds himself in the library and wanders through the shelves of books, knowing each as intimately as the back of his hand. He has grown up here, learning to read from ancient Potions tomes, words he did not understand, could not pronounce, but got excited by anyway. His godfather, Severus, always knew exactly which portion of the library to send him to when he was in one of his moods. When he grew frustrated by his father’s demands, he would be asked to go and spend some time in the section of Wizarding classics. Folklore, fairytales, myths and scenic imagery always calmed him down. Put him in a better mood when facing his father. When he ranted about Potter with real anger blazing in his eyes, Severus would ask him to go and find the ingredients to some very specific potion found only in one specific book. His concentration would be focused on his work, not on Potter. When the Dark Lord had been here, Severus had looked grave and told him to spend as much time possible learning about the Dark Arts. Not to use them but to understand them.To understand exactly what he was dealing with in every room of his childhood home.
Draco smiles, his heartbreaking smile, all angles softened by it. “Give me a minute,” Harry says, staring at it, unable to look away. He wants that smile to fall apart under his ministrations, segueing into an expression of open-mouthed pleasure. He wants to see how many of Draco’s angles soften with orgasm and how many of his muscles clench. He wants to count the stars that appear in Draco’s eyes when he looks at Harry in the aftermath, constellations worthy of a man named after the skies. “I want to learn to suck you off.”
“I’m going to the Great Hall. You coming?”
“Wait till Slughorn sees,” he tells her when they walk into class side by side. “He’ll hate you for forcing him to acknowledge I attend Potions.”
He accepts Potter’s offering of sunglasses and acknowledges the fact that he’s fucked with a resigned sigh and a particularly hard shove to the glasses up his face which he regrets immediately when the bridge of his nose begins to hurt.
He turns his head, and Harry is still sitting on the armchair, watching the two of them with unreadable eyes. “Come here,” Scorpius admonishes. “You’re too far away.”
He punches her in the arm and she shoots him a faux betrayed look. “How did it even happen?”
And Draco’s expression scrunches into one even more endearing as he contemplates Harry with total bewilderment.
Both of them cock their heads to one side in an eerie replication of the other and say, “Oh,” in unison. It’s right at this moment that Ron chooses to enter, sees the two of them sitting on the couch with their heads tilted to one side, Harry gripping his arse with one hand and glowing red numbers in the air and walks right back out.
He’s sitting on the sofa by the time Potter nears it, his heavy gait giving away his pent up frustration. Potter moves light as a cat until he’s angry, when every aspect of him seems to radiate
He can feel his dams break, his walls crash and the carefully pushed back vitriol rise. “
“–and he’s an ex-Death Eater. I don’t care. Not really, not the way you apparently think I should.”
He almost has another one, stopped only in time by Potter adding, “Didn’t know her knowing was that much of a fear for you.”
“I know.”
“What Potion?”
“Indeed,” Blaise says, raising those perfectly arched eyebrows. No straight man has eyebrows that perfect. Figures that Blaise is not a straight man, but then, Draco wonders with no small amount of disappointment,
Draco snorts. The Firewhisky sloshes. “For the amount you’re being paid, you have all day and all night and all of whatever’s in between, whenever I want, don’t you think? That is what you signed yourself up for.”
When Harry sat up, groggy and disoriented, Ron had entreated him to go and kill ‘that noseless bastard once and for all’ and no matter what Harry said, Ron continued to pleadingly beg him to kill Voldemort as though he had no consciousness of where he was. When he went to fetch Hermione after sitting Ron down and telling him he was going to go and get him a glass of water, he found her hyperventilating in the kitchen.
It makes him sick, as though he’s hollow. As though a piece of him is missing and has left a gaping hole in its wake.
“No, you haven’t. I’m here, I’m real and I understand why you would think I’m not but I am.” Potter says these words and Draco realises he must have spoken out loud. He doesn’t even have control over his speech now. Brilliant.
There is no accusation in the words. Pansy would have thrown those same words at him like sharpened knives hurled in a rage with deadly accuracy. Instead, Blaise, well, he– he serves as a reminder. A reminder of a similar evening with a little too much drink and far more laughter when the confession had spilt from Draco’s lips like a happy, dirty little secret. Blaise had only told him to be careful then.
Draco stays with Granger late into the night. She sits on the bed in the room Weasley is sleeping in and he sits in an armchair by the fire. Harry is with Lovegood in another room and Lovegood has sent a Patronus saying Harry woke up for a while and in conversation consented to therapy as long as the Mind Healers were discreet and didn’t give him special treatment simply because he was the Saviour. And then, he had gone back to sleep.
Harry laughs, incredulous and bitter, because
Draco blushes bright red, up to the tips of his ears. “Sorry, stupid question, I’ll go change—”
He does, until his brain quiets completely, the sounds and screams fading away to nothing, the spasms and tremors of his body leaving him with nothing but painful cramps that Harry knows will go away soon enough.
“Potter,” Draco says, because even when Harry has hurt him, in ways that have nothing to do with pulling a magical noose around his neck tight, he can’t bear to watch Harry hurt himself. “Potter, look at me. I’m fine.”
“A show?”
With a small sigh, Harry holds out a hand which Draco takes in his own, gripping a little too tight. Harry pulls him closer and Draco follows, without hesitation.
“Haven’t you looked around?”
Suddenly Draco is gripped by painful realisation, painful, burning understanding of Harry’s testimony on his mother’s behalf.
‘It’s the Black family cabin,’ Harry says with a weak smile. ‘What do you expect?’
Harry presses more kisses onto his overheated, sensitive skin and Draco stifles the uninhibited moans that rise to his lips, but he can’t help the whimper when Harry sucks at a spot on his collarbone. He cuts it off immediately, but it’s too late, the damage is done.
He resolutely does not step outside the office because he knows the moment he sees the younger Aurors rushing around with boundless energy and enthusiasm, his own resolve will crumble to nothing.
They’re lounging on the garden floor, clothes probably mottled with grass stains and bug juice, but for once in his meticulous life, Draco couldn’t care less. It’s nice in a way he never thought sunset gazing with Potter could be.
Draco feels his throat tighten and convulse on the lump in it.
“Do you know who it is?” He asks, and his fingers twist in the lacy edge of the tablecloth. “Who he’s…”
“Don’t.” Draco can’t handle Pansy. Pansy with her biting words and sharp fury and intense hatred of Draco’s ‘stupid’ decisions and her miserable fucking sympathy– he loves her, but he can’t– he doesn’t know– oh fuck it all, not
Draco raises an eyebrow, and splays his hands open in a gesture of faux innocence. “I barely said anything.”
Muggle advancements, Granger said, would help the Wizarding World. Telephones, medicine, university, social education, all of it. So for the two years of their lives that Muggleborns were to spend learning about magic, Purebloods would learn about everything that… wasn’t magic. Draco had wanted to laugh. He had wanted to point at Granger and exclaim, “You think Muggles can help us?”
At this point, Draco has begun to get dizzy from the sheer speed at which she talks and how much information she seems willing to share with him about their personal lives, even if it does happen to be about Potter’s owl. He holds up a pointed hand to stall her barrage of words.
Nothing.
She hadn’t. She was dead.
Harry’s hands are usually engaged in taking off Draco’s clothes during these first kisses. But when they finally break apart for air and look at each other with smiles that feel perfectly appropriate despite how out of place they actually are in their fucked up reality, Harry’s hands reach into Draco’s hair, his nails stroking Draco’s scalp gently. It feels a little too intimate, a little too hopeful and Draco knows he should pull away before this memory becomes something he can use to summon a Patronus, but he can’t.
He chooses to numb it all down regardless, lifts up Malfoy’s slight frame and carries him back to the kitchen. It isn’t an easy task given that Malfoy is pretty tall and no matter how wispy he looks, he’s heavy when he is dead weight in Harry’s arms. He lays him down on the kitchen floor, the kitchen floor on which they sit together and have much and solve crosswords in the Prophet. It isn’t an ideal position but Malfoy seems to relax slightly and Harry heaves a sigh of relief.
“Have you told your friends about me?” Draco asks. His friends know. He knew they’d find out from the very moment Pansy had shown up on the doorstep of his room, wand tucked into her hair, looking sharp and observant as she took in Draco’s every move. They’d written to him, some longer missives—Blaise’s rambling eloquence spilling into a three part letter, Astoria’s detailed descriptions of her year at Hogwarts, a couple paragraphs dedicated to wishing him well—some short, barely a line—Theo’s ‘good for you’ and Millicent’s ‘Finally’.
Draco closes his eyes against the foreign light in those green eyes and focuses on the sensations.
The pain at hearing him apologise, call it a mistake. Tell him he shouldn’t have gone along with it. Tell him it was okay to say no as though Harry could even imagine saying no to such spectacular kissing, not to mention he had been wanting it for weeks.
“It’s Harry Potter. I’m sure you guessed as much.”
Draco stares. “What?”
Harry doesn’t want to open his eyes. Doesn’t want to be faced with the white wall again, doesn’t want to think about leaving and how Draco doesn’t want him around anymore. But Harry is nothing if not confrontational, so he opens them anyway.
‘Mm,’ Harry mumbles. ’S’nice.’
“What did you do?” he asks, because it seems significant.
“I’m sure I have no idea what you’re talking about—”
none of which is particularly interesting. When he methodically works through the list of recommendations, they talk about Frankenstein and about Rebecca and during one particularly scarring conversation, Lolita.
He tries to focus past the pounding at his temples and hears the even breathing of somebody else in the room. “Water,” he manages, the word coming out raspy and broken grating against the roof of his raw mouth.
‘Not her. The Weaslet– Ginny Weasley. She’s your girlfriend right?”
He doesn’t really know why he’s here except that he had found one of his diaries from sixth year where he had detailed in almost clinical terms the numerous ways in which he had failed to fix the Vanishing Cabinet. The flashes of white light, the dead animals, the strange sounds. The Room Of Hidden Things threatening to bury him alive, under the weight of towers of long-forgotten things. He had become one of those Hidden Things that year. The journal had taken him back and now… he can’t think of anything else.
“The Lake is lovely this time of the year,” Draco tells him, looking at the dark waves.
Without knowing how to stop himself, he pulls Harry closer until they’re pressed bodily against each other, skin pressed tantalisingly against skin. Draco’s shirt is still hanging off his shoulders and Harry has lost his T-shirt at some point during the process and Draco can’t help but lean in to kiss Harry senseless.
Rome is a king, and Draco is a prince, and Harry is a happy voyeur watching a kingdom thrive before his eyes.
He’s sobbing and he’s shaking and suddenly someone is pressing a glass of water into his hands and he looks up to see Gianni’s watery blue eyes staring down at him, leathery face screwed up in worry.
He had prepared himself in abstraction for what the trip would probably entail and then adjusted his expectations around what he got to know of Draco. But somewhere, he’d forgotten to factor in the sleepy bedhead of a blond man who wasn’t fully functional without a cup of coffee, forgotten to factor in the mind-melting kisses, the arbitrary hypothetical questions about philosophy and the universe, the slow hand jobs and the slower blow jobs.
“You’re supposed to be taking notes, Harry,” Hermione chastises at the same time Malfoy says, “Something crawl up your arse, Potter?”
“No one would want to service someone with the Dark Mark, Granger. Not even supposedly unbiased St. Mungo’s healers.”
, Draco thinks, derisively.
Draco nods again.
“I thought Ginevra was with Potter,” Draco manages after a few seconds.
“Prize pet you got there,” Malfoy snorts. Hermione shoots him a warning glare and Harry clenches his fist to keep from throwing the notepad at Malfoy’s blond head.
“The night my mentor Albus Dumbledore died at Professor Snape’s hands, Draco Malfoy was on the verge of killing him. I was there, hidden under an Invisibility Cloak. There are Pensieve memories I have submitted to the Minister confirming the same. Draco Malfoy lowered his wand when Dumbledore offered him help and safety. He was willing to betray the Dark Lord, and if Snape had not stepped in, I strongly believe we would not be here today, debating a child’s decisions.
Harry shakes his head to clear it. There’s a fog over his thoughts, a veil that isn’t letting him process everything that just happened. The fact that Draco gave him the kiss of his life and then ran away from him, apologising, swearing and saying it had been a mistake. Harry knows he should feel something but all he can feel is the reminder of Draco’s warm, chapped lips moving against his and the pressure of his spine against Harry’s fingertips. His emotions are all hidden behind that veil and for some reason, it won’t budge.
“Whatever hair potions you use, obviously,” Malfoy snaps. “Merlin, Potter, don’t be a daft git. About doing this—this thing. With me.”
“No shower,” he gets out.
“Malfoy? Are you alright?”
“What?” Harry asks, surprised and a little hurt. “Why’d you suggest it if you didn’t want me to come along?”
Harry can’t stop his own grin from widening when the tips of Draco’s hair gently brush the bridge of his nose. “Marginally.”
“But then again, what’s the point of all that potential either if you’re going to waste it holed up in a villa?”
“Where’s Dad?” Scorpius asks, when no answer seems to be forthcoming. He’s confused, but the part of him that is supposed to feel confusion is distant, like a voice trying to reach him underwater. “It’s his day off. He’s supposed to be where you are.”
“You’re telling me you’ve been here since he was, what? Seventeen?”
It’s a feeling he hasn’t felt in a long time which is why it takes so long to place it but Harry has a feeling that he’s floating. That he’s weightless in time and floating and doesn’t need anything more to be added to his life for him to die happy.
“Rose and Hugo would be nice,” he says instead, clearing his throat. “Merlin knows Rose will bring me back and kill me again if I don’t say goodbye. Victoire and Teddy too. Aunt Hermione, if she’s not too busy. Ginny, please. She made me promise… Oh and,” he closes his eyes and smiles, “Professor McGonagall. If she agrees.”
Draco looks hesitant but says it all the same, “Alright then, Po– Harry. Call me Draco.”
“There’s a valid explanation, Mione. Let Malfoy handle Harry and I’ll tell you about it.”
“For me?” Draco had asked. Teased, just a little. There had been a smile lingering on the edges of his consciousness, threatening to traipse onto his mouth.
“I’ve had a while to get used to it.”
He shies away from her piercing, perceptive gaze and grimaces. Malfoy. As usual, making him more uncomfortable than he already is at the worst of times. “That miserable twat doesn’t deserve it.”
“Real,” Draco says.
They sit there together till the sun comes up.
“What?” Harry says, dumbfounded and floundering in the face of a Malfoy who has reacted to the situation so contrarily from what Harry had expected of him that it’s laughably ridiculous. “No, why would you—
Everyone had come to know about the Horcruxes after they had all been destroyed. Voldemort with his fragmented soul, immortal in artefacts. They had come to know that each had been destroyed in the time Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley and Harry Potter had disappeared for a year just before the War. Some on 2nd May, 1998 by others but most during that time.
“I’m not going to apologise because you deserved that.” To the point, concise.
Not the roughened edges of affair, or the sting of cheating or the hiss of a whispered mistake. Infidelity, a name, a sin, a rounded roll of a word, sitting casually between them.
Eventually, they both nod in acquiescence. Harry gives Scorpius a watery smile, presses a kiss to his forehead and leaves, shutting the door softly behind him. Draco waits for his steps to fade down the hallway before sinking back down and letting his head drop onto the bed. His shoulders shake, his hands clench in the bedsheets. Scorpius lets him cry uninterrupted.
“I don’t think I’m ready for that much of a culture shock, yet.”
His whole body feels heavy and weighted, like a drowning body with stones tied to the legs. His brain is still undecided between overwrought with worry and completely blank, a strange flickering juxtaposition that leaves him overwhelmed as he lies on the bed, blinking up at the white ceiling, trying not to choke on the overwhelming sweetness of Harry’s shampoo.
It is agonising but when he is finally used to the feeling of three thick fingers inside him, he raises his head and says, “Please. I’m ready now. Please?”
“Can’t we postpone this talk?” Harry asks. He knows he’s being a coward and that admission feels foreign and tastes bitter on his tongue but he wants to avoid this. He wants to avoid telling Draco the true extent of the damage done here, wants to hide from the reality. This moment, this perfect moment with them sharing body heat in a quiet, cozy room with no interruptions, no more unhappy resentment or untold desires– when faced with the prospect of losing it, Harry wants to dig his heels in and refuse to do anything that would enable that. And the impending conversation will do exactly that.
Harry knows this. Sees the way Hermione stands apart from him and Ron when they talk to Molly, eyes distant and sad. Sees the way she can’t seem to stop crying some nights. Sees the way Ron pulls her close and mutters reassurances into her hair.
The thought makes him sit bolt upright in bed. That’s it, isn’t it? His foot taps to the rhythm of his erratic heartbeat and his brain whirls through Draco’s reactions and behaviours the entirety of the past week. The unhappy slant of his lips, the fervent desire obvious in his eyes to be as far away from Harry as possible, the maddening indifference. Draco wants him gone, but he’s a coward, so he won’t say it to Harry’s face. He’s going to make Harry lose it and then pin it on him when he is forced to leave.
“Keeping busy.”
“We need you, Harry” Scorpius had once heard Uncle Ron whisper in the hallway outside his room. “It’s the nastiest piece of work we’ve seen in a decade and a half, mate, more people have died in two weeks than the last three months. Please, just today.”
Draco isn’t sure Harry knows just how much his world has shifted in those few moments Harry spent telling him why he could stand to touch him. For so long Draco has avoided mirrors, avoided looking at any reflections, afraid of the reminders. But now, Harry’s soft words washing over him, he thinks of those marks the way Harry tells him to. Reminders of survival, not reminders of anyone claiming him.
“Harry, it isn’t Hermione, it’s actually me. Would you please open the door? I don’t want to use magic.”
He talks a lot when it’s just him and Scorpius. Fills the quiet room with his rich baritone, stories of places Scorpius will never see and people he will never meet. Scorpius thinks he should be a little more resentful of Death, but Harry Potter could have been a writer if he wasn’t an Auror, given his uncanny knack for making even the mundane act of walking down a street seem like something out of a fantasy novel. He finds himself unable to resent that which allows him to spend this much time with his father, taking trips down lanes as vivid with brimming life as Scorpius had been even a few vital years ago.
Through it all, neither Draco nor Harry issued any statements. Draco did not confirm what Selwyn had told him. Harry did not relay what had led him to arrest Selwyn under those charges in the first place.
‘We need to talk,’ Draco says when Harry walks into the kitchen the next morning, clad in nothing but boxers, blinking blearily through his spectacles and yawning.
“It’s my birthday in five days,” Malfoy says. They’re drinking wine, sitting in the drawing room which is a cosily minimalistic affair done in cream and gold. Malfoy has loosened the top two buttons of the shirt he wears underneath his robes which he lost sometime earlier in the afternoon. He’s not drunk, not even tipsy, but his tongue has loosened somewhat.
The sound of Harry choking on his spit is music to Draco’s ears.
about
“What project were you discussing with him anyway?” He asks finally, his interest piqued all of a sudden. He was so caught up in the utter wrongness of Malfoy’s presence in Grimmauld Place that he hadn’t even thought to consider why he might have been there at all.
“Okay.”
She shrugs one shoulder, effortlessly. “You drove him away, Potter, you’re going to have to go find out yourself.”
“Alright, alright, I’ll see what I can do,” he concedes.
“It’s still you,” he says. “Still you, still your skin, still something you own. Something you survived. He hasn’t claimed that part of you, Draco. The skin on your shoulders doesn’t belong to Greyback. If it did, I wouldn’t go near it, but it doesn’t. It belongs to you. It’s still yours, Draco,” he enunciates, carefully, slowly, making sure every word hits home. “Still yours.”
“How’s the shop doing?” He asks. He’s always harboured a secret admiration for Fred and George Weasley for the stunt they pulled in Fifth Year, and their ensuing resounding success. During the summer of Sixth Year, more than once he’d placed orders under a different name for some puking pastilles and skiving snackboxes. The wrappings are still buried beneath the mattress in his childhood bedroom, the one he moved out of after the events of the War.
Harry’s brow furrows and clears suddenly. “Let me,” he says and pushes Draco’s legs further up, changing the angle entirely. He shifts slightly, pulling in and out deep inside Draco and suddenly, all of Draco’s nerves are singing on fire as his prostate receives the full impact of Harry’s thrust.
“You know it’s quieter here. More peaceful.”
“N-no, ‘Mione, I’m sorry, I went off, I don’t know why I said those things to you–“
“Stop,” Draco says, breathless and flushed, arching wantonly.
There are secrets there.
, and yet.
Draco hadn’t known what to do, but an uncomfortable tightness had wormed its way into his chest and had expanded into a writhing beast since.
him.” The words are choked, strangled. His voice barely sounds like his own.
For the past two years they’ve been trying.
“The world has seen extensive damage and there are open wounds that require healing. The Muggle World, though not entirely aware of the inflicted damage must be given an opportunity to understand what their children are entering into before their children are taken away for the year to an institution half of them do not believe in. Unless we begin the introduction early, the barriers of prejudice will remain unchanged and we will only live to see the rise of yet another fanatic,” Kingsley is saying, his deep baritone resounding in the silent, circular hall.
There’s a hand on the back of his neck and it’s the anchor he’d been looking for—not overwhelming or claustrophobic, but something steady to keep him grounded.
Harry smiles, gently and sweetly, completely at odds with the way he was talking a few moments ago and kisses Draco again. This kiss is laced with promise, tasting of salvation and smelling of sweat and skin and sex. Draco’s never had a better kiss.
With one hand, Harry pushes Draco back down on the bed, raises himself and crawls back up Draco’s torso, hands mapping the areas which lips had claimed moments ago. For a minute he thinks Harry will lean in for a kiss and prepares himself for it, smiling sultrily at Harry, wanting to feel those soft, dry lips against his own. But instead, Harry reaches down unexpectedly and sucks viciously on his right nipple and Draco sees stars.
“No, Potter, fuck
He’s seen it before, Lovegood’s face at the Ministry events where Harry appears with Ginevra on his arm and the photographers swarm them like bees. He’s suspicious his own face resembles that melancholy, resigned set more than he’s comfortable acknowledging.
Given context, it feels like Harry has finally lost the last vestiges of control over himself.
“I can’t talk with them… out there.” His voice comes out slightly shaky. Granger turns around, evidently surprised to see him in his kitchen. There’s a Death Eater in her kitchen standing behind her, she’s going to draw her wand and kill him, she is going to call the Aurors, he is going to go to Azkaban–
“Alright.”
Potter’s eyes are unreadable.
“Gin,” Harry sighs, because he knows where she’s coming from. The less impulsive part of him that’s looking for stability screams assent with the sentiment. “It’s complicated.”
It’s a strange realisation to come to– the knowledge that one is dead. It’s less something he feels and more something he… doesn’t. Since the last time his eyes had been open, something within him has simply stopped.
He lets her take her time, let’s her breathe deeply and evenly and then asks, “Better?”
Harry opens the window to the owl with the daily newspaper, and once he takes a quick look at the headlines, he folds it back up and puts it under Draco’s coffee cup.
A week into classes where the teachers say little to him and he works alone most of the time, Draco walks out of the hall and heads to Potions only to find Granger waiting for him outside the dungeons.
Harry doesn’t blame Malfoy for being sceptical of Mungo’s. To some extent, even he is.
But Malfoy’s panicked eyes betray the true depth of his terror.
“No, we’ll go,” Draco says, hauling himself out of bed. “I feel a little…” He gestures towards his head in an expansive fashion that could mean anything but Harry takes to mean overwhelmingly restless.
“You’re rather outspoken.”
Harry shakes his head. He’s too far gone to know what he wants or care what Draco gives, as long as it relieves some of the pressure that’s pressing against his abdomen, threatening to explode.
This time Weasley is the one who shrugs. “No. That’s just for fun.”
Draco’s heart clenches so painfully that he thinks it will be shrivelled forever. “Harry,” he says. “I came back.”
“Well, pardon me but I thought you were supposed to be at my house on Friday afternoons. Yet, you weren’t. Tell me why I should stick to the first name when you insist on treating me like a stranger?”
Draco hesitates but Harry doesn’t. His hands reach up to cradle Draco’s face and he barely has a split second to appreciate how large Harry’s hands really are before he’s being tugged forward, meeting Harry’s lips in a searing kiss.
Relief brings a grin back to Harry’s face, small but sure. This isn’t prejudice, this is understandable cowardice. This is Malfoy not wanting to get hexed, which is simultaneously familiar and deeply unfamiliar given Malfoy’s penchant to say the exact things that grated enough on Harry’s nerves for his magic to itch for a fight. So he says in a voice as amicable as he can make it, “Not the Muggle ones.”
He doesn’t know how to respond.
She nods and hands him a cup. She adds a splash of milk to the other cups and a sugar to each of them and before he can stop himself the words are out of his mouth. “Potter takes two sugars too.”
Draco snorts. Potter’s lips twitch.
Draco pauses on his way to the door, towel still slung around his hips, hair wet and a little, nervous smile playing at his lips.
“Volatile, Draco,” she says. “There’s a reason.”
“You absolute menace,” Draco says, biting down on his exposed earlobe. “Bumping uglies, Potter,” he says, startling a laugh out of Harry. “Buggering, doing the do, the old in and out—”
– in my bloody kitchen looking comfortable as you please!”
Harry scrubs a hand over his face.
“How?” Harry whispers. His head is a riot of colour and thoughts he can’t discern, but there are words he can still make sense of, and
I have the time as you very well know. I agree that haste cannot hurt when it comes to formulating the proposal and would like to go over your plans with you if you so desire. I wish I could suggest an alternative but as I am unwelcome in most spaces and you are likely not going to agree to a meeting in the Manor’s kitchen or my bedroom, Grimmauld Place it will have to be. Beggars can’t be choosers.Thank you for your time.
Malfoy jerks, startled. “I beg your pardon,” he says, cheeks tinged pink. “I was… processing.”
Death has its symphony, Harry has come to realise. In the rhythm of blood and the crescendo of screams, in the drumbeat of bodies falling, in the thundering of a heart.
“Good things come to those who wait.” Harry’s tone is amused and teasing.
“You said you had firsthand knowledge, Mr Potter.”
Draco stops.
Harry doesn’t have an answer for that which will make sense or be believable to someone who thinks they are hallucinating so he goes with a simple but firm, “No.”
What, I don’t understand–”
But Harry doesn’t leave. Doesn’t pull on his clothes or shut Draco down, or say in those closed, clipped Auror tones that he must leave now for personal reasons.
Harry says nothing for a brief moment. When he speaks, he appears more composed that he has in the past few minutes. “When?”
“What do you mean?” Something in the tone of her voice betrays that she is repeating herself. That he didn’t hear her the first time because he was too caught up in his own head.
The months right after the War, Harry had felt something in himself give way with every single funeral he attended and eulogy he found himself giving. By the time he had attended the last one, he felt far more drained than he had ever felt before. The pain of Sirius’ death was compounded a thousand times, the cries of agony and the whizzing lights of Avada Kedavra and Crucio reverberating and echoing in his skull.
It had been right up there alongside the other worst days of his life– Sirius dying, Dumbledore dying, Fred dying, Ron leaving.
His head thuds back against the kitchen cabinets, a pose he has perfected in the months he has spent sitting in his kitchen, either too exhausted to work or too relaxed from the Calming Draughts to stand and not fall on his face. He knows from experience that a Calming Draught does not act as a numbing charm and the pain felt when on it is still very, very real. That’s when he hears Potter’s breath hitch.
“You knew he’d cheat?”
he widens his mouth and slides Draco’s cock into it inch by painstaking inch as Draco howls in ecstatic pleasure.
Harry is mute. He can’t help it, he can’t speak. Malfoy is so distinctly unlike himself right now that Harry thinks he needs to find a suitable bush to puke in. Instead, he reigns it in, meet’s Malfoy’s suspicious eyes and says, “No, I don’t think your magic is failing. I think your house trusts me.”
, Ron had said, a few glasses into the night,
“And after that… he came back. He started cooking again, started sleeping in our room when he wasn’t feeling too great, started talking to us. He made amends with you and I thought, I thought he was… okay! But… but…” Her speech is so garbled at this point that Draco has to strain to make out what he is saying.
“Just say yes,” he whispers. “Just say yes to what I’ve said, and we’ll be okay.”
Draco hadn’t known what to say so he had mutely nodded. Granger’s smile had widened as she said, “Good.”
At the time, Draco hadn’t known why Granger’s disappointment twisted something inside his core, but he’d called out, quietly to her, stopping her in her tracks.
“What brought this on?” Draco asks, eyes sharp and expression demanding. A few months ago, it would have made Harry furious. Now he sees it for what it really is, an expression of concern disguised under cold factuality and rational understanding of the situation. He responds in kind.
“No,” Malfoy says.
“So tell me, what are you doing?”
Harry pats his shoulder sympathetically.
Hermione smiles at him and though he tries very hard not to, the corners of Malfoy’s eyes crinkle just slightly. Harry can’t help but notice how much better he looks when he has that slight softening to the sharp planes of his face, less pointy and jagged, more approachable.
Draco’s nerves disappear.
That’s a pipe dream now.
Death meets his eyes with an unnerving gaze. Scorpius can’t pinpoint the exact shade of their eyes. “Sometimes,” they say, and the gravelly voice is far more gentle than Scorpius expects it to be, “sometimes, some of you–” They break off. Look away. “Sometimes there are bonds stronger than that of your mortality and my arrival. Bonds which tie you to something other than me. And when that happens… you must wait.”
Scorpius startles. He hadn’t even thought to do that since he got his bearings. He was caught up in… other things. Like having a corporeal form despite being dead, whatever that means. Like greeting Death the way his father had once told him to when he’d been drunk and vulnerable by his bedside.
“The taste,” Healer Brocklehurst had said hesitantly, when Scorpius had complained, “has been described by many in the same position as the taste of Death.” Harry had grown pale hearing the words, his tongue darting out to smooth over his chapped bottom lip. Scorpius remembers Draco’s fingers twitching against his arm. As a fifteen year old who had once been an open mouthed child exploring the hallways of a dusty Manor house filled to the brim with insect life not merely limited to small spiders, Scorpius chooses to characterise the unpleasant taste in a less melodramatic fashion.
Whatever had risen in Harry’s chest resembling hope sinks. “A man like me?” he asks, voice bitter and tone harsh. Of course Malfoy is still a prejudiced prat. Of course he’s still a biased fuck—
,” Draco had said, wiping off the flecks of blood from Scorpius’ chin and neck without flinching. “Lest you come back to haunt me.”
“Probably.”
Draco wonders distantly if Harry would follow through even if he could listen.
The warm, wet heat moves further down, to his thighs and Draco knows how much Harry likes being bitten and touched there, but now it only serves to amp up Harry’s painful arousal even higher as Draco sinks his teeth gently into the soft skin of Harry’s inner thigh. He pulls off and soothes it with his tongue and if Harry had his hands free, he would have probably strangled Draco by now for doing this to him, but fucking Salazar, it feels so good.
‘Does it chafe?’ Draco asks.
It’s Potter’s turn to shrug. “Anywhere. Everywhere. I was kind of hoping to land up at some point in India, but not right away.”
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry notices Hermione’s lips tilt up in a smile.
“And how’s Harry?” She asks Ginevra, and Draco’s grateful their attention is directed towards each other, thankfully missing his flinch.
“Would anyone care to tell me what a Death Eater is doing in my kitchen?” He keeps his tone deceptively casual, as though he’s asking what Hermione’s cooking for lunch.
Malfoy and Mione look at each other. Then they look back at Harry and nod simultaneously. “Alright. Harry, you’re taking notes.”
He knows that the second Draco touches his dick, he’s going to explode and maybe that’s why Draco completely ignores it in favour of moving down his abdomen, lower and lower, until he reaches Harry’s bollocks, heavy and swollen.
“And if that was something I didn’t want to be, I wouldn’t be.”
was sixteen. But Scorpius was my son, the boy I wanted to protect from the person I had become when I was sixteen. He was a Ravenclaw, and multiple times Flitwick told me he would be some sort of miracle inventor because he devised a charm at twelve that poured his Potions ingredients into the cauldron for him.
A fair, indisputable point. Draco can’t argue it so he chooses to settle back against the couch. But just because he has to accept it doesn’t mean he has to be happy about it or anything.
P.S. Harry and Ron really did send their regards in the morning but right now there’s just Harry and he made a face.
He swats at her hand and she laughs. She’s been laughing a lot more, Harry notices. Ever since he started making an effort, she’s been smiling brighter and laughing more. Ron too has been talking more, talking about George, making inappropriate jokes. It twinges but Harry knows they had been walking on fragile eggshells around him for a while now. So he powers through the exhaustion that comes with the effort, the anger that makes him see red, stays quiet even when he wants to be alone and focuses on the smile Hermione is throwing his way. He might want to sleep it off in his room but if he does that, when he wakes up, they won’t be here. And he can’t bring himself to deal with that.
”Yeah? What else are we gonna do? Nothing?”
The other boys gasp in excitement and crawl a little closer to the edges of their beds.
”We’ll discuss it later”, Lucius says smoothly.
he amends, looking at the bubbles floating from the still open egg as it continues to sing.
He glances over at Draco to see the boy has cringed back in his own chair, his nervous gaze flitting between Harry and Sirius a few times, before flickering over to Remus for reassurance. Remus gives him a small smile and gives his head a tiny, subtle shake.
”Harry”, he scolds. ”You should be in bed—!”
is gone. Harry is alone again. But he’s not floating anymore, he’s gliding, slithering… across cool tiles, between metal bars and through cracks… his body is taut and flexible,
”George!” the woman shouts sternly.
Another smirk flickers onto Professor Snape’s face, but he studiously ignores looking over at the Slytherin side of the classroom. Instead, he pins Longbottom with a stern look and the chubby Gryffindor gulps.
”Harry, I don’t blame you at all…” he murmurs softly. ”But…”
, he thinks wryly.
”Oh give it a rest, I’m fine”, Draco huffs and leans back in his seat again. ”Haven’t you seen how scared they look now? They’re not going to try anything again, at least not for a while… I think they lost their nerve when they nearly got caught.”
”But…” he adds slowly, eyes flitting around their surroundings quickly. ”I meant what I said before, Harry. That was a great job on the Horntail, it really was, but you’re still the underdog in this competition and to tell you the truth I feel bad about all this… how you were thrown into this Tournament and all… and I’ve taken liking to you, I mean… the way you handled that dragon!” he whistles and shakes his head. ”So anything I can do to help, anything at all—”
”It’s okay”, Harry says quickly. ”I’m sorry I forgot, but tomorrow I get to drink the potion, so we can… we can sleep together then, if you want, that is…”
”No, I get it.”
” Seamus exclaims, his half-lidded eyes popping dramatically. ”Harry, maybe
— before he realises that,
Remus bends down to give Sirius a quick kiss, before taking the seat next to him.
As soon as they hit the wet tiled floor, the sink pops back into place hiding the entrance again. Harry goggles at it… But —
”Nothing, never mind”, he says quickly.
Harry struggles to wrap his suddenly numb fingers around the new goblet that Draco holds out, but eventually manages to clasp it in a secure grip and takes an eager swig — then immediately gags and splutters.
He feels Draco’s hands on him, his slender fingers trembling but firm as they clutch his shoulders.
”And who’s this young lad you’ve brought with you, Lucius?” the man, Barnaby, says loudly and Harry quickly whips his head back around and gives him a polite smile. ”Dark hair like that, I daresay he’s not a relative…”
”Can I help you, Draco?” Harry says calmly.
All the Gryffindors are beaming and chatting excitedly. Even Granger looks happy, despite being late for class.
”Why isn’t he here himself?” Harry asks curiously.
”You found us, good”, he says, wiping his hands on a kitchen towel. ”I wasn’t sure if I should have met you at the station.”
”Is it true, though?” the Weasley girl asked in a hushed voice, also leaning forward towards Harry. ”You’re not really you?”
Breakfast promises to be a tense affair, much like the second half of the dinner the night before, but Harry thinks he might be too sleepy to be bothered by it. That is, until Draco gets into a hushed argument with his mother over eating breakfast and insists he can’t travel on a full stomach or he’ll get sick, and Narcissa finally agrees to let him skip breakfast and go get ready, on the condition that he eats something once they get there… Now, Harry is happy as long as Draco is happy, but he really wishes the blonde would stay at the table and keep him company while he eats breakfast at least. As it is, the blonde dashes out of the dining room again, to go take bath or something, and Harry is left to share the tense silence with Mr and Mrs Malfoy. He’s never felt quite as uncomfortable before in his life.
”I told the other Harry the same thing.”
”Do you remember your biological parents?” Ms Skeeter ploughs on swiftly.
Harry nods, draping his arm over the back of Draco’s and giving his hand a grateful squeeze before shuffling around to face him.
”Crabbe and Goyle”, Harry mumbles. ”They’re thick and mean, and we’ve said maybe three words to each other since we got Sorted…”
”Harry”, Remus admonishes gently.
He nods towards the High Table where a very morose-looking Hagrid is picking at his food and Harry looks but barely sees, his mind buzzing with terrible possibilities…
”Well, we better get going…” Blaise says, frowning at Harry. ”You’re staying here, I’m assuming?”
”Yeah, same…”
”What?” Harry says in confusion.
”No — we’ve never —
I think that, in my version of the Canon Universe, Draco would have come out to Pansy (and she would have come to terms with him being gay) a while ago now. So by the time Neary!Harry gets there, I imagine their relationshop to be like this, with Pansy basically being Draco's sassy faghag in private and his beard in public/around their families.
Harry thinks in frustration.
As she reaches the foot of the golden stairs and steps into the light spilling out from inside the castle, they get a good look at the black satin robes hugging her body and the many opals gleaming around her neck and on each of her olive fingers. She smiles serenely at the slightly wide-eyed audience, but her large, black eyes sweeps past them almost at once and settles on a point above their heads.
”What do you mean Ron started it?” Harry exclaims in a long-suffering voice and giving the blonde an exasperated look. ”He hasn’t done
”Not really”, Harry argues. ”We’re both Seekers and we haven’t got a Snitch, so…”
As it turns out, Draco had been wrong in thinking the girls wouldn’t want to get involved because they’re the first to sign up after Draco and they’re not the only ones. Harry counts seven signatures from their year alone, besides Draco and the girls, Theo also decides to sign up, as do Crabbe, Goyle and Millicent. And those are just the Fifth Years. There are at least ten older students on the list as well.
A glimmer of surprise in the man’s eyes, tells Harry that he hadn’t expected Harry to be grateful at all.
Draco must be the only student who doesn’t believe in Divination and still cares about doing the work… he’s definitely the only Slytherin listening to Trelawny with a politely avid look on his face now, as the woman begins to talk about the larger schemes of the universe.
NOW —!
He keeps replaying the scene in his mind, trying to work out what it all means… Dumbledore looking right at him and saying he wouldn’t be
”Silencing Charm!” Blaise calls out from his bed across the room.
”They are going to want blood in the morning and I will be the first one to point them in your direction, Finnigan—”
DRACO!”
”It’s okay”, Harry cuts in desperately. ”I can do it!”
”Harry…” Draco whispers finally. ”Are you asleep yet?”
unable to sleep for hours and listening to the sounds of other people having fun nearby.
—?” Draco gasps as he thunders to a stop right next to him. ”I couldn’t hear anything —!”
”Told you”, Harry whispers.
, some irreparably
pile.
”I’ll tell him to wake you”, Sirius assures him gently, giving his shoulder another squeeze.
”I know”, Ron says, mistaking the look on Harry’s face for a reaction to the prospect of being sorted into Slytherin, but Harry doesn’t bother correcting him. ”Anyway, what’s you Quidditch team —?”
”Well, you can hardly complain about unwanted visitors then. Perhaps we could continue this discussion inside?”
”Certainly!” She titters and proceeds to package the tiny glass bottle in a shiny box twice its size.
”Good…” Draco murmurs with a smirk and leans in to brush his lips over Harry’s. ”Missed you too, you know…”
…” he adds, spitting the words out like he was trying to undo the kiss itself. ”You knew, and you let me believe —”
Something heavy whacks against his side and he is immediately thrust into something solid, either a wall or a pillar, and again he gasps for breath, waiting for fangs to sink into his flesh,
”Sure”, Harry mutters, thinking if it can get Draco to cheer up, what’s the harm?
”I don’t want to hear it”, Snape snaps. ”Just keep your head down and control your temper.”
A sudden
he thinks.
”I don’t like people who attack when their opponent’s back is turned”, Moody growls, directing the ferret out into the Entrance Hall, bouncing it higher and higher, as it squeals in pain. ”Stinking, cowardly —”
”Let’s just say I’m glad to hear there are some people who don’t believe everything Rita Skeeter writes in that blasted newspaper… apparently, my dads have been getting… well, hate mail, basically… my daddy’s even been getting death threats.”
Hagrid frowns at him, ”Of course I can’t tell yeh tha’… Number one, I don’ righ’ know meself see… And number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn’ tell yeh even if I could. That stone’s here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts — beats me how yeh even know abou’ Fluffy —”
”All right…” Sirius says briskly, as the floor of the fone-box begins to sink with a shudder.
”Think he would?” Seamus grins mischievously. ”Talk to the Minister?”
used to it. ”It makes for such a nice change!” he adds, proving Harry right.
It shouldn’t be such a shock to his system to feel the hard length of his boyfriend’s cock brush against his own, after all it’s not like he’s never felt it before (by this point, Harry has got every inch of the other boy’s naked body more or less memorised), but it is and it sends a jolt throughout his body.
”Are you?” he counters.
”You have?”
helpful, he’s told me everything
Draco lets out a breathy chuckle and nods. Then killing the distance between them in five quick strides, he throws his arms around Harry and hugs him tightly.
”Library”, Draco says shortly.
They both watch Draco follow Remus insde the cottage, presumably to help him cook, the blonde’s new favourite passtime ironically enough. He might not love to eat, but he loves to cook. Harry sucks in a deep breath and straightens up.
Remus watches him uncertainly as he stomps past him and disappears into the front of the shop. He pulls the robes off angrily and dumps them on top of the counter, waiting for his daddy and Madam Malkin to come, so they can pay up and leave the shop already.
”Very advanced”, Remus says, but smiles kindly at him. ”But if I was going to have private lessons in it, I’d want Professor Snape to teach me…”
annual draw, when the name
Remus sends Hedwig with a message to Dumbledore, before he and Sirius Side-Alongs Harry and Draco to the edge of the school grounds. By the time they’ve walked along the winding road from the wrought-iron gates up to the castle, Professor Snape is waiting for them at the top of the staircase, looking extremely apprehensive.
”Oh, thank goodness”, he pants. ”I just heard someone got hurt — what —
Swirling around, he looks for Hedwig but her cage is empty.
”Y-yeah — yep — fine”, Harry says and quickly chomps down on a piece of potato to prove it, but quickly begins to cough and splutter as it tries to make its way down his windpipe.
”Well”, Remus says and stands up. ”Dinner should be ready in fifteen minutes, Harry, if you want to freshen up… we’ll go over the Dreamless Sleep schedule after we’ve eaten, okay?”
”What happened there, Harry?” he asks quietly.
of course! A real corker, I thought! Had a blast! Some would say a little
that…”
”One — two — three —”
Draco’s eyes immediately shutter, but he sniffs indifferently and says, ”I have no idea what you’re talking about…”
”Come on, it will be okay…” Harry whispers and gives him an encouraging smile. ”Draco… we’re invisible!”
”Level nine: Department of Mysteries —”
who can’t even look at a picture of two wizards lying naked together, without feeling like he’ll explode with heat and embarassment?
Remus glances between him and Draco and hesitates.
Harry frowns.
”Fine”, Harry mutters, sinking down on the bed next to him. ”Nothing special. What did Dumbledore want?”
Snape huffs out a sigh of exasperation.
And no sooner has this realisation hit Harry than he spots the white-blonde hair flowing around the head of the figure on the far left. Heart stuttering in his chest, Harry gapes in horror, his shout of alarm emerging silently from his mouth in yet another perfectly round bubble that floats away and disappears into the gloom above him.
”Ah well…” Harry mumbles awkwardly.
”Don’t say the name”, Ron whimpers.
Harry hurries to follow Riddle out of the office. They make their way through the castle, following the all-too-familiar path down to the dungeosn… Harry glances up into the other boy’s face every so often, still struck by his handsome features but also the tense look of determination on his face…
” Parkinson says slowly, her voice dripping with acid.
”You said at the time that you and Draco just slept, nothing more—”
”Oh, no dirt…” Blaise says, studying his immaculate nails idly. ”Just the latest gossip about the Gryffindorks…”
He’d assumed anyway.
”What’s wrong?” he asks. ”You think I’ll be put on trial after all?”
”Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve been practising!” squeaks Professor Flitwick as he perches on top of a huge pile of books behind his desk. ”Swish and flick, remember? Swish and flick! Also, saying the magic words properly and clearly is very important — remember what happened to Baruffio when he mixed up his ’s’ and ’f’ and found  himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest…”
WEASLEY IS OUR KING!”
just—” he grabs a hold of Harry’s robes when he goes to step into the bubble and fixes him with a pleading look. ”Please, Harry — try floo calling your house!”
Looking around again, Harry counts only three Gryffindors — Granger, Weasley and the annoying girl who’s always hanging around the Patil twins — four Ravenclaws and one Hufflepuff, Macmillan, who’s a bit of a pompous bookworm, but nice enough.
… Harry feels his cheeks grow hot as he glances at one particularly perky blonde, straddling a motorcycle.
” he exclaims as he remembers his omniculars and realises the play-by-play function might still be possible, even after the fact. ”Actually, maybe you can! Hang on, be right back—!”
Remus and Sirius arrive at the castle, looking livid and Harry feels genuine fear when the werewolf’s manic eyes lands on him. But the other man doesn’t attack him. He doesn’t even address him, but swivels his eyes to Snape instead who greets them curtly and then instructs them to follow him to the Headmaster’s Office.
”The Amortentia — what did it smell like to you?”
he thinks with pang.
”What’s this?” Harry asks curiously and pulls the shiny red package closer. ”Bit early to be handing out presents, isn’t it?”
”The poor owl that delivered it nearly passed out”, Remus tells him. ”I gave it some water and one of Hedwig’s treats, then let it rest for a few minutes…”
”So what? I should stop
”No, he’s… He’s not going to be celebrating Christmas with us this year, Harry—” Sirius says.
”I… I’m… My dorm is on the dungeons, Sir… I swear, I’m not playing any games…”
He reaches out to pat the back of Harry’s clenched fists in a soothing manner.
It’s obvious to everyone in the room that the blonde is anxious about the idea of having to out his parents and Harry can see why. It’s one thing to run away from home and distance yourself from your family, but it’s another thing entirely to completely destroy their lives. If they’re outed, their reputation and futures will be ruined forever — and that’s probably the best case scenario, Harry thinks. A lot worse can be done to them by the rest of the Death Eaters and Voldemort himself.
Grasping one of the Cup’s handles, Harry immediately feels swooping sensation in his stomach, like he’s being pulled through space by an invisible thread hooked to his navel, while the whole world swirls around him and Krum, connected by the Triwizard Cup in their hands.
Suddenly, they can hear the faint rustling of something slithering over the ground, like a cloak trailing over dead leaves. Harry’s heart hammers hard in his chest and he holds his breath, straining his ears… but whatever it was, moves away from them and soon the sound fades into the night again…
The group leaves the Great Hall with a decided spring in their steps, chatting and laughing amongst themselves. Their good spirits carry them through the day and only reach new heights when it’s announced that Professor Snape will be taking their afternoon lesson in Defence Against the Dark Arts, since their regular teacher is
It comes as no surprise that Granger’s hand would immediately shoot into the air and begin to twitch with the restraint from not compulsively blurting out the answer. It is surprising, however, that Draco merely shoots her a glare and doesn’t attempt to compete with her for Professor Snape’s attention. Since it is Professor Snape, Harry suspects Draco would be allowed to answer as well, and knows that that would make the blonde feel better, but he’s not even raising his hand. Harry frowns.
he adds to himself, watching his supposed friends filter in, all shooting him looks of varying degrees of sourness.
anymore.
He nearly slaps his hands over his face when Draco immediately turns rose pink, even as he replies airily. Harry resolutely avoids looking at both of his dads and starts blabbering about quidditch as soon as the blonde trails off, just to keep any potentially awkward silence at bay.
”What…” Harry croaks faintly as panic begins to course through him.
Harry nods again, impatiently, and strides over to the door without as much as a word in farewell.
Harry’s breath hitches and he’s keenly aware of his dads’ intense eyes on him. A lump has started growing in his throat, he tries to clear it but it doesn’t help.
”—it’s hardly going to be risk-free, is it?” Harry ploughs on stubbornly. ”So what’s the use of—?”
He springs to his feet, excitement running through his body like a hex.
”I… I think I’m going mad, or something… in Dumbledore’s office, after, I… for a second, I thought I was a snake and I… I wanted to attack him too!”
”I normally open the ones from friends and… well, you… here, and save the ones from my dads for later and we normally open our presents together in the living room.”
”All right”, Madam Hooch says and both teams quickly mount their brooms. ”On my whistle… three… two… one…”
It’s clear that Draco is already stressed what with his mounting school work piling up more and more each night, despite how much he works on it. So it really shouldn’t come as a surprise to Harry when he says he might not try out for the quidditch team, but it still does.
”If it’s between quidditch and Muggle Studies”, he tries to argue with him. ”Draco, come on… Just drop Muggle Studies!”
”Yes, she’s well in her right to do so”, Professor Snape snaps. ”Please tell me you did not just risk detention by breaking curfew, so that you could come and complain about having to serve detentions?”
”Want a hand?” someone says suddenly and Harry jerks his head up, an older boy with flaming red hair and a face full of freckles is sticking his head out of a nearby compartment, and Harry realises his is one of the voices he’s just heard.
”But…”
”Shut up, Malfoy!” Parvati Patil snaps and Pansy Parkinson lets out a high-pitched giggle, ”Ooh, look who’s sticking up for her
”Mister Potter”, McGonagall says reprovingly. ”Pull yourself together! I assure you, the Gryffindor dorms are just as adequate as those in Slytherin! Now, let’s go — I, too, would like to get to bed at some point tonight!”
The group of friends explode into peals of breathless giggles.
”Yeah, you’re right…” Harry says, nodding sadly and then favouring the professor with a fake reassuring look. ”Oh, it’s not his fault, Professor. Dumbledore has been
”It’s er… a thing for ehm… eavesdropping…” Harry mumbles, pulling a little harder on the woolly straitjacket.
Harry has got so used to sitting with the Weasleys at the Hufflepuff table that it feels weird to go sit in opposite ends of the Great Hall again once term starts. But at least Draco is back again and Harry gets to catch up with him instead.
Less than an hour has passed when the signs start popping up all around school. Massive signs with enormous, glaring letters on every wall. Not just on the house noticeboards in the Common Rooms, but in the hallways and classrooms as well and they immediately become the topic of conversation throughout the castle amongst students and teachers alike.
That’s your job, isn’t it?
let them go because
Finally, the two men manage to pull the curtains closed again and an eerie silence falls, broken up only by Sirius panting breaths.
”Harry, my boy…” Dumbledore interjects gently. ”Why don’t you sit back down, so we can talk?”
”And the identities of the Death Eaters?”
”See you later”, Harry says and it almost comes out like a question.
But Draco doesn’t appear to have heard her at all. He’s staring at the paper in mute anger, his eyes flitting frantically across the page. Harry cranes his neck to read the headline, but Draco quickly crumbles the paper between his hands so the article is hidden. Harry frowns at him. The blonde stares back with an unreadable expression in his face.
He meets the man’s eyes dead on, willing him to believe him. For once, he’s actually been doing what he’s been told, yet he’s still not improving and he doesn’t want Snape to think that is because he’s lying to him about doing his exercises.
”Check it out…” Draco murmurs and pokes the button with his index finger.
into a chocolate frog”, Crabbe grunts.
”Fine”, Draco says surly. ”So what do you suggest we do? You heard what McGonagall said. Dumbledore won’t be back until tomorrow.”
thoughts and feelings in return. Which brings us back to Occlumency.”
”Here we are!” Remus says in an unnecessarily loud voice, and Harry and Draco immediately let go of each other again. ”Yes, this looks very nice Narcissa. Good choice.”
”Severus Snape”, Harry tells Remus calmly, gesturing with finger towards the guestlist insistently. ”He’s a Slytherin, but he’s also an Order member, so I don’t see it being a safety issue—”
”I’m not the one they’re trying to assassinate—”
But she also slips her hand into the space between Harry’s elbow and his side, smoothly linking their arms together and Harry feels his face twitch again.
Professor Snape pushes to his feet for a second time and this time he rounds the teacher’s desk and faces the students with a dramatic swirl of robes.
Unable to tear his gaze away or do anything, Harry simply stares back.
The last in the group is a very young man who looks anything but happy to be there. In fact, he looks completely terrified. His whole body is shaking and his freckled face completely drains of blood as he stares up at Crouch.
”We’ll need to send for Minerva”, he says. ”And the Weasley children ought to be woken—”
Harry notice several wizards and witches smile indulgently at him. Crouch’s scowl however only deepens and he looks down at Bagman with pure dislike and distaste.
”How are we going to get inside?”
Scrambling to his feet, he points his wand at the creature.
friends, possibly… He feels a pang in his chest, thinking about Ron, and Hermione, and suddenly he feels extremely lost and lonely.
Just as the man plucks his wand from his belt and points it at him, Harry rears up from the floor, stretching high into the air. The man’s face pales and he gasps, a hex on the tip of his tongue, but he’s too late — Harry strikes, his sharp fangs sinking into pliant flesh, once, twice, and on the third time a rib snaps between his jaws… A pained scream is wrenched from the man’s throat and he collapses back againstt he door, before slumping to the floor…
In the corner opposite the fireplace stands a gramophone on a rickety table, emitting strings of mandolin melodies over a cheerful man’s voice singing about snow and palm trees.
Remus chuckles a little, then sniffles and nods. He pulls away again and combs his fingers through Harry’s hair fondly.
But the rest of Remus chastisement is quickly lost when Sirius reigns him in for a deep, affectionate kiss. Harry smirks and quickly leaves them to it, joining Draco in their room instead.
”, Draco grouses. ”We’ve
”Get.
”But Albus… surely… I mean,
”Right then, Ron”, Hagrid says matter-of-factly. ”I think he might let yeh ride ’im now!”
Perking up slightly, Harry nods and eagerly starts to describe the whole match from memory and by the time he gets to Victor Krum pulling off the Wronski Feint, he’s so excited he can barely stay seated.
Wheeling around angrily, Harry points over Remus’s shoulder, ”Why does he have to
”Ready to go?” Draco says, sidling up to him and Harry nods and as they make their way out of the shop he asks Draco if he wants to get an ice cream or something in the Tea Shop.
good.
”It’s good, isn’t it?” a dreamy voice drifts over to him and he tears his eyes away from the magazine to blink at Loony Lovegood suddenly stood in front of him.
”I’m fine”, he repeats. ”Just tired. I’m going to bed, all right?”
”You can’t attend the actual meeting”, Remus corrects firmly. ”But you may accompany us to Grimmauld Place and wait with the Weasley children while the meeting is going on, and then I thought we might stay for dinner…”
”You got a Nimbus 2000?
”You’re almost as bad as Granger”, Harry mutters one day in the library, glancing from the frantic jerks of Draco’s quill to the Gryffindor in question who is sitting at the next table, pouring over piles of notes and mumbling anxiously under her breath.
She buries her head in her hands and shakes like a leaf in a storm.
“The one I took from you in the Manor.”
The Dursleys weren’t kind about it, him being a brown-skinned boy, fucking up the whitewashed symmetry of their family. There had been multiple reasons for Vernon’s prejudices and Petunia’s rabid rage against James, and though magic had been one, the melanin hadn’t helped.
When the handle starts digging into his back, Harry pulls away, flustered and a little dazed. They enter, and Harry is glad he didn’t leave his underwear on the floor before leaving today morning. His bed is a little untidy but he doubts Draco cares when he’s pressed up once again against the wall.
Potter turns, his torso twisting, showing off the lines of his criminally trim waist and the way the jumper hugs his sides. “Nothing,” he says, turning back. “Probably an elf.”
“Just a scar,” Harry swallows.
How could I not?
“If you don’t mind me asking–” he begins hesitantly. Granger looks up inquisitively. “What’s Potter’s deal?”
Draco scowls because Potter always knows how to hit the nail on the head even when he doesn’t know he’s holding a hammer. “We have villas,” he says. “One in France, another in Italy. We have some property down in South Africa too—”
‘I know,’ Harry says, stroking his jaw with his thumb. ‘I know.’
“It’s not mine. You’ve… you’ve redeemed it. You should keep it.”
He startles at the echo of Ginevra’s voice in his head, the sharpness of her words, the precise nature of her delivery. Come to think of it, spending his year of exile in France, being coddled by his mother’s elves does seem futile. Disappointment smells of the familiarity of his mother’s perfume and the sharp tang of beer as he meets Potter’s eyes across the table.
“Right,” Potter says, voice oddly faint. “Right.” After a moment he says, “I think I’m good here.”
“Do you have eggs?”
Harry’s eyes flicker briefly over to Ron’s, heart pounding with gratitude. Trust his best friends to know what he’s terrified of. Trust them to reach into the aching parts of him and draw away the doubts.
“Harry saved your life,” she says, tilting her head to the side. “Hermione told me.”
When Hermione tells him about the Pureblood and Muggle Culture Project, Harry stares at her for a few long moments before whispering, “That’s brilliant.” Hermione smiles and says, “I know,” and Harry feels slightly stupid for being an absolute knob about it in the kitchen the other day.
“Hmm?”
“Darling–“ Narcissa had begun, but one look at his face, and she’d caught on. “I absolutely agree with you,” she’d continued. “Lucius was always so fond of you, Archie, he knew all about the little problems of the shop, of course, but he still poured in Galleons, knowing he was doing you a favour. I can’t expect the same of Draco.”
Malfoy drops his fork instead. He’s pale in the face and shaking a little, and Harry refuses to feel bad. All of a sudden, this Malfoy isn’t the one who thanked everyone in front of a packed Wizengamot or the one who refused to identify him at the Manor or the one who lowered his wand on the Astronomy Tower. This is the one who called Hermione a Mudblood from second year, this is the Malfoy who joined the Inquisitorial Squad—Harry’s hand flexes, and he knows the scar screaming
“How are you even here?” Malfoy asks, brows furrowing as though Harry is a complicated puzzle he can’t quite figure out.
“Okay,” Draco says after a few minutes of silence. That’s a common word in his repertoire now, a filler for the times when Harry’s grace leaves him speechless and spellbound. “Okay.”
, Draco had told Hermione when she had sat down beside him and asked if he wanted to just talk it out with Harry. Divorced and in a good mental place with no romantic entanglements pulling at her from any side, Hermione Granger pressed the point with both Harry and Draco time and time again.
Malfoy clears his throat. The elf bows again and says, “As the young masters are wishing.”
This time her smile is more genuine. “If you had to make it up to us for each of your fits Harry, you wouldn’t have time to do much else.” These words have the opposite reaction from the one Hermione had clearly intended if her amusement is any indication. Harry feels ripped to shreds by the grief that replaces the rage he was feeling minutes ago. She seems to understand and her eyes widen. “No, no, I didn’t quite mean it like that. I just meant that we’ve seen you at your worst and we, we haven’t made you make it up to us ever, have we? You will anyway.” She covers his hands with hers and a quiet, reassuring confidence tinges her words, “When we least expect it.”
”What?” Draco frowns. ”What do you mean—?”
Draco blushes a little and shakes his hair into his face, but he also chuckles and does as he’s told and joins Harry and Sirius at the table. Harry watches him fondly and as soon as he sits down next to him, he leans over and squeezes his hand.
”What are you
When they get to platform nine and three quarters, Harry hugs Sirius goodbye quickly and then turns away to give his dads some privacy. He catches sight of Seamus’s grinning face in the crowd and feels his face flush even as he gives the Irish boy a warning glare. The other slytherin simply laughs though and then lets out a catcall — ”Way to go, Professor!” — Harry squeezes his eyes shut and groans.
They both take flight again in a flutter of wings as Sirius opens the window, only to soar inside as the window is pushed all the way open. They land gracefully on the counter and Remus unties the small message from the Northern white-face while Sirius pays the other for the paper before taking it over to the table. Harry tries to get a glimpse of the headline of the front page, but Sirius flattens the paper on the table before he has a chance. The picture had been of some old witch he didn’t recognise though, so the paper is clearly keeping quiet about the Triwizard Tournament and Viktor’s death still.
”That’s fun!” Sirius comments and starts flicking through the magazine when Harry moves on to his next gift.
”How dare —”
”Did you see my —?”
”Is that b-blood?” Draco whispers.
”The Ministry of Magic wishes you a pleasant day”, the woman’s voice says and the door slides open.
Hope you like it! Comments are my fuel, so keep them coming :)
”I wonder, dear”, says Professor Trewlawny to Pansy who immediately shrinks back into her armchair. ”Would you pass me that teapot?”
Harry shrugs. He really hates Apparating anyway, it always makes him nauseous. He catches Sirius giving Remus a gentle smile, then quickly looks away as the two men lean in for a kiss.
”I can’t believe he made one every day, all that time… We weren’t even talking”, Harry says. ”I thought he hated me!”
”My Lord… Yes, My Lord”, Rookwood gasps in relief, his eyes watering slightly.
Sirius is in favour of not inviting any Slytherins at all, much to Harry’s and Draco’s outrage even though the blonde holds back from expressing it, probably because he’s still a bit scared of Sirius. Harry on the other hand, is vocal enough for the both of them, reminding his dad that all his friends are in Slytherin.
Granger nods thoughtfully, staring down at the small drawing. She grabs the quill back and sketches out a quick floor plan of a second room next to the first one, divided by a thick line. She writes
”Not much farther now”, Harry says, his cajoling tone of voice matching his hesitant hand movements as he tries to gently pry the girl’s fingers away from his shirt. ”She’s just over there — see that door?”
”Did you
And also they smell really nice. He can’t put his finger on what the scent is, with his brain now turned into a quivering Dugbog, but he knows he likes it —
”You’re not small”, Draco repeats firmly. ”You’re actually thicker than I am.”
”Sir, I wanted to ask you something…” Riddle says and Harry finds it slightly disturbing to see a small, coy smile play on his lips.
Defence teachers…”
”Shhh…” Draco hushes softly, his fingers digging into the flesh of Harry’s thighs and Harry forces himself to relax against his pillows again.
”When I said ’where is my son’, I didn’t need a lecture on muggle science, Dumbledore! I needed you to tell me
”What’s your name, anyway?” he asks.
Feeling a bit at a loss, Harry swifts his weight a little awkwardly from side to side. He scans the room, searching for a familiar face. Of course, the familiar faces want very little to do with him now, he remembers bitterly and makes his way over to one of the sofas and sinks down on it.
… before you start to
”Well, you’ll have about four days to get it done while I’m away”, Remus mutters.
”And then what happened?” the old man prompts gently, now gazing up into the ceiling.
They step inside the grotto and Harry looks up at the many fairies sitting perched on the branches above him and smiles. Looking down again, he catches Ron staring at him before the other boy quickly looks up as well and nods in agreement.
Harry feels the fight drain out of him as quickly as it had resurged, replaced with a heavy feeling of hopelessness.
to be a Parselmouth doesn’t mean I’m related to Slytherin!”
”I’m fine…” Remus says, his smile softening. ”Ready to practise your Patronus?”
He claps his hands enthusiastically, and the other teachers join in, albeit less enthusiastically but that’s always the case, Harry has learned. The students don’t join in, which is a first, and a testament to the shock they must all have experienced at the sight of this Moody — who doesn’t appear to care one way or the other, by the way, Harry thinks studying the man’s face as he begins to chew on a piece of sausage after having given it a suspiscious sniff first… He then reaches into his cloak and pulls out a hip-flask that he takes a generous swig from, and Harry lets out an incredulous but amused breath. He looks over at his friends across the table. Blaise’s eyebrow is raised and Seamus is out-right grinning.
”GET OUT!
”Harry—”
”Professor”, Granger says hurriedly, her eyes flickering between Draco’s bruised cheek and Umbridge’s face. ”Malfoy
can account for what happened to Viktor Krum in that maze, Mr Potter” Umbridge says coldly. ”And although I admit a resurrected Dark wizard with a murderous plot serves as an excellent alibi, if no such Dark wizard exists, we might ask ourselves who
? With a sinking feeling, Harry realises that that is actually very likely…
”I know”, Harry says quickly. ”But she’s worried you’re not eating enough. Right?”
He blinks in her direction. He is sure he’s a right sight- maybe she will laugh at him.
“Fucking
Across the table, Bill nods in agreement.
fault Voldemort decided to exist in his timeline, it’s not
“We know we’re working with nine year old children from Pureblood and Muggle brought up families.”
Draco closes his eyes. There’s memories, flashes of colour and sound pulsing against his eyelids, recollections of his aunt giggling maniacally as he cast Crucio on some poor Muggle sitting in his cellar with wide eyes and no understanding of what was going on around him, of his desperate attempts to cast a Patronus charm when he was holed up in his own room, of Potter screaming Expelliarmus and his wand shooting out the brightest jet of red light he had ever seen to meet Voldemort’s green halfway.
When Harry wakes up again, the sluggishness has receded, as has the headache. His throat is still parched but there is a glass of water on the bedside table to fix that up. He looks around to realise they put him up in a guest bedroom, one of the only ones fixed up to house a guest. Unable to adjust to the feeling of being a guest in his own home, he gets up, stretches his legs and finds his way out onto the landing.
Scorpius doesn’t mind it. Not as much as they all expect him to.
He didn’t mean to, but the sudden, overwhelming shock of knowing that Ginevra
desire mud in our blood. But, surely you’re not forgiving me for calling you… what I did and tormenting the Weasel- Weasley the way I did and Potter, fuck, Potter- surely you expect more from me- you haven’t forgiven me and the Aurors haven’t forgiven me-”
Draco half expects Harry to throw punches or hexes or at least throw his words about, but Harry ambles over to the sofa and perches on the arm of it, his delicate pose at odds with the heaviness radiating from every angle of his posture.
Her face crumples and Draco’s senses fire as the panic sets in.
She stops moving. It hits him for the first time she probably hadn’t known he was there. When she walks over to stand above him, he peers at her sheepishly through his eyelashes with an expression he sincerely hopes conveys his desire to be forgiven for what he said to her. She merely waits, hands on her hips, eyes focused on him.
By the time Harry’s mouthing just above the waistband of Draco’s jeans, the sounds and moans are falling uninhibited from Draco’s lips. Every time he thinks he might be going overboard, Harry’s voice sounds in his head,
Draco wasn’t much of a cook, but he hung around chatting about Scorpius’ latest antics and Blaise’s latest conquests and his latest client wanting to feel him up despite him being happily married and that being a pretty regular fact in the papers.
The woman nods. “That is a common tale in quite a few cultures, yes.”
When Harry opens his eyes with open hunger and longing plain in them, he thinks Harry understands him. He hopes he isn’t wrong because if he is, it would bring him to his knees but he thinks Harry feels the same way.
Draco leads, Harry follows.
“Just want it to work, s’all,” he mumbles.
On his other side, Ron exhales a shaky laugh.
And that’s that.
“Shit,” he whispers quietly, lips scratching against the soft pillowcase, dick twitching in his hand. He ruts gently against the bed, the cool cloth of his pyjamas keeping the friction heady and strong but not unbearable. His precome slicks the way and his movements are gutting rougher as he coasts the shore of his orgasm, the waves of it lapping at his nerves but not daring to spill.
Harry almost swallows his tongue in surprise. And chokes. And bursts into a coughing fit. When he looks back up at Malfoy, it is to find him glaring. “What?” He demands.
“N-no,” he splutters, eyes wide. “It’s not like that!”
A hush descends for a minute. “There’s something you must understand,” Death says at last, “before I explain anything else.”
‘You have for the past six years,’ Harry tells him, teasingly. ‘Or so I thought.’
There is legacy in every step of the city and with the rest of their lives stretching out before them, who Harry and Draco are here is a legacy in itself.
“No,” Draco rushes to assure. “I liked it.” He pretends he isn’t blushing and adds, “A little too much.”
Greg doesn’t write and Draco tries to not take it personally, tries to not let it sting the swollen part of his heart that still mourns Crabbe with every breath. Vince had been stupid, Vince had been destructive and hurtful and pigheaded until the very end, but Draco had loved him, a friend and a brother and when he’d been eaten by Fiendfyre, Draco’s childhood had been buried with him.
“To apologise.”
His hands fly into Harry’s already messed up hair, gripping it, tightening in it. He has always been sensitive there to the point of it being on this side of painful. But the sensations travelling up and down his body is so far removed from painful, the little electric jolts of pleasure arcing across his spine, his legs, his chest, his dick.
He doesn’t realise what Draco is doing until those long, deft fingers have reached over to undo the button of his trousers with no warning whatsoever. He turns to look at Draco who has a faint blush on his cheekbones and who is determinedly not looking his way.
“I don’t think of time,” Draco says automatically, eyes focused on the little tilt of Harry’s mouth. “It’s all a social construct. Illusions.”
“Wait, what?”
“Malfoy, would you mind telling me your version of things once, please?” She asks, finally breaking the silence.
You… you’re you and your friends are supposed to be noble and good and Gryffindor and I…” he trails off.
Choudhury looks over to where a stunned Harry is still lying on the ground. “Am I right in guessing this is his doing?”
The elegantly labelled bottle doesn’t speak, doesn’t poke him in the ribs, and most importantly is always up for a spot of midnight fun without complaining. Truly, everything Draco could want in a roommate rolled into one gorgeous bottle of amber liquid.
”I… Back in the Department of Mysteries”, Harry says frowning. ”In one of the rooms down there, the one where the Order was duelling the Death Eaters. I don’t know exactly what kind of room it is, but it’s like a theatre and it’s got an arch in the middle of it, a stone arch… Everyone was gone. The Order, the Death Eaters, my friends, everyone… Except…”
Harry feels himself smiling despite himself and shakes his head.
Harry’s feels a weird mix of pique and amusement, and just a hint of affection, because what other reason could Snape possibly have to hold back other than Harry being in the room? He must obviously care enough about him to not want to hurt his feelings, why else would he stop himself from speaking his mind?
”What are you doing home so early?” the man asks, crossing the threshold and frowning at him. ”What’s going on?”
”D-da-ddy —?” he says, his voice breaking.
”I’veaskedgranger”, Draco mutters quietly.
”Professor Snape is going to have a fit…” Pansy comments drily.
”Oh, I say that”, the wizard says. ”They know about the Time Room.”
”Thank you, Gildreroy”, Dumbledore says.
The office is empty and eerily quiet except for the muted buzz of a hundred sleeping portraits hanging all around the walls. Harry feels like screaming and fists his hair again, curling in on himself. Draco’s tentative hand touches his arm, but Harry throws it off when he jerks up.
”Who hasn’t”, Harry mutters. ”Mad-Eye Moody gave me the idea to summon my broom in the first task and Ludo Bagman offered to give me pointers right before, and today when I was on my way here, as well — he literally stopped me in the street to help me figure out the egg!”
of Granger to
And then with obvious effort, he presses a shaking arm against the floor and hoists his shoulders a few inches off the ground and lifts his head to meet Harry’s gaze… Harry’s heart drops into his stomach, even as he hears another tinkle of cold laughter leave his mouth… His dad’s face stares up at him from the floor; it’s gaunt and stained with blood and despite the tension of pain around the eyes and mouth, he scowls in defiance.
with you…”
”I’m not sure about the bridge thing, but I know I need to be in the clock room tonight at five thirty”, Harry says resolutely.
Remus gives him a fond look and smiles a little secretively, but doesn’t say anything. Sirius turns to his husband and gives him a look, but Remus merely shrugs as well.
”Yeah. Not right now, maybe later…”
, and still he feels like he’s floated away from his own body, away from the chair and the classroom…
He catches the flicker of doubt in the blonde’s face, but pretends not to have seen. If he says it enough times, he thinks Draco will start to believe him. But if he keeps saying it now, he’ll only overwhelm him and drive him away from this moment. Instead, he focuses on the naked chest underneath him.
sexy—”
Harry feels a stab of sympathy for the house-elf as it quickly scrambles to its feet again, cradling a broken arm to its’ chest. Sure, the elf’s warped way of trying to save Harry’s life actually almost got him killed, but his heart had obviously been in the right place and even if it hadn’t, no-one deserve that kind of abuse… Making his mind up, Harry slips back inside McGonagall’s office.
Harry scrawls quickly.
”This is uncharted territory for all of us”, Dumbledore says quietly. ”But we will figure this out… You have my word, Remus, Sirius… Harry…”
Harry nods.
For a moment, the prospect of the future crashes down on Sirius like a monstrous tidal wave and he wonders desperately how he is going to break all this to Remus… But as he looks down into the sleeping face of Harry, and the thin cut on his forehead shaped like a lightening bolt, he knows that whatever else happens, he will devote the rest of his life to taking care of this boy.
He’s sitting hunched over it in front of the fireplace in the common room later that evening, halfway through the introduction when he comes across a passage in the textbook that states:
”It’s okay, it’s just a table cloth —” Sirius says, reaching for his husband’s hands and trying to still their frantic movements.
”Yeah…” Harry mutters.
”I — I — I don’t — I didn’t —” Harry stammers, as fresh tears well up in his eyes.
don’t you want to tell me though—?”
Harry wheels around to see Ron and Granger exit the potions classroom behind them. Ron’s ears are beet red and he’s glaring daggers at Draco, while Granger offers Longbottom a hand and helps steady him as he gingerly gets to his feet.
More students begin to titter. Harry himself is torn though, as much as he rather have Professor Grubbly-Plank back as their Care of Magical Creatures teacher, his hatred for Umbridge is significantly stronger than his dislike for Hagrid’s idea of teaching, and besides he does feel a bit bad for Hagrid. After all, even though he might be a giant oaf, he does mean well and Umbridge is clearly prejudiced against him because he’s part giant — or, as she would say,
”Weasley, cut up Malfoy’s roots for him”, Snape says without looking up.
But before he can finish the sentence, Draco’s hands flies up to clamp onto either side his head, the wrapped perfume bottle swinging from his wrist and hitting the side of Harry’s neck. And then Draco’s lips are pressed to his.
The giant oak doors of the castle swing open to reveal a tall, stern-faced witch in emerald green robes.
Harry looks down at the steaming cup of coffee and frowns, feeling his stomach knot tightly. Finally, he raises the cup to his lips and pretends to take a sip, but keeps his lips firmly closed against the rim of the cup. Umbridge’s smile stretches out happily.
The man stirs suddenly. His eyes begin to flutter open, then snaps open wide as he spots Harry in front of him. The man’s silver Cloak falls to the floor as he jumps to his feet and reaches for his wand —
”You know perfectly well what I mean…”
Draco opens his mouth to retort, but before he gets a word out, Ron and Granger suddenly walks up to their table and he swivels his head around to glare at them instead.
A Dementor comes gliding towards him and he collapses on the ground, feeling like all the pain in the world has settled into his limbs and frozen his veins; somewhere in the darkness a woman screams,
Sirius bites his lip to keep from saying anything, but he looks very apprehensive. And it is suddenly clear to Harry who was arguing when he was waking up. He glances over at his dad, who gives him a pinched little smile but winks discretely to show him that eveything’s okay.
”Yes, but there were three of you and one of him”, Remus counters. ”Well, four of us and one of him, I should say… I never did anything to stop either of you and I should have. I felt bad about it then and I feel bad about it now.”
”You were in the Forbidden Forest —?” Ron gasps incredulously.
”Thirteen”, Sirius replies without batting an eye and Harry blinks. ”What?”
Both girls exchange a sly look and smile coolly, before darting their eyes over to Harry and he shifts uncomfortably.
”Sir?”
”My dads are here?” Harry says in surprise. ”What, now? They’re here now?”
”Tell me what happened…”
”Took a piece of me with him too”, Moody grunts and chuckles again.
So it’s with a heavy heart and squirming stomach that he drags his feet to Snape’s office for a second time on Friday afternoon for his Career Advice meeting. This time when he knocks on the door, despite knocking so gently it’s barely audible, he can immediately hear Professor Snape’s approaching footsteps on the other side of the door and a moment later it swings open.
Even though Harry tells himself sternly that nothing happened between Draco and the other Harry and that it's clearly paranoid of him to think it did, as he lies staring out into the darkness, unable to fall asleep, his heart keeps pounding:
”I think this is it — here somewhere — this is the entrance to the Chamber — I’m sure —”
”I’m so sick of that girl”, Draco grumbles. ”I feel like my life is just infested with Gryffindors, it’s like they’re a fungus that just spreads over everything—”
Harry thinks.
to think about it”, Blaise says immediately.
Harry spins around to see Malfoy and Parkinson glaring furiously at him from the doors to the castle, just before the blonde boy turns on his heel and stomps off in a huff. Turning back to the Gryffindors, Harry catches both of their winces before they give him sympathetic looks.
”What”, Harry mutters again, shooting her a glare.
”I wish…” the blonde continues, his voice oddly thick and strangled now. ”I wish my Harry was here. I don’t know how I’m supposed to do this without him.”
Professor Snape nods grimly.
for me… That’s weir—”
we’ll give you something to think about in the meantime! If you look at the golden eggs you’re all holding you’ll see there’s a clutch at the top… that’s right… you need to open your egg and solve the clue that’s inside, that will tell you what the second task is — and you really need to know ahead of time this time, because otherwise you won’t stand a chance! — All clear? Okay, off you go then!”
”Maybe. But they probably won’t yell so much if you’re waiting for me outside…”
, it’s Malfoy and Potter!” Seamus protests.
Harry stifles a groan and shares a sullen look with Draco and his friends. They all return it with sympathetic looks and smiles.
”I… I thought they were funny…” Hagrid says uncertainly.
The glint is back in Draco’s eyes, the one that reminded Harry of that vampire guy, Sanguini, and now he knows why; It’s half
The boy nods wordlessly, still catching his breath. But he does hold his hand out blindly in front of him, offering the parchment to Harry, who grabs it and give the short message written on it a quick look, before pocketing it and turning back to Granger.
He starts untying all the letters hurriedly and one by one the owls take flight again, until he’s left with a pile of parchment and a table littered with feathers and droppings.
”You know, you don’t even have to go out there”, Draco says. ”You can just forfeit, you don’t have to do anything!”
”Draco…” Harry says, making sure to let enough exasperation spill into his voice.
”Sorry”, Draco says and looks anything but. ”You are awake now?”
He looks around half-expecting to see Hagrid lead a couple of live lions into their midst, but Seamus points to the approaching Gryffindors.
The snake slowly shuts its huge mouth again and slumps back to the floor. Harry feels a surge of relief. He looks up at Finch-Fletchly, grinning and expecting to see a similar expression mirrored in the other boy’s face. But instead, the boy stares at him just like that time in the courtyard. Harry’s grin quickly falls.
Harry looks between the two of them for a moment, then sinks into his own thoughts. On the one hand, he knows he should feel relieved that Voldemort didn’t get the prophecy, since it was obviously important to him.
Remus sighs again, ”You’re only allowed to bring
, which also happens to be his dads’ café of choice.
He sits down in the creaky chair and slouches over the desk, opening his magazine to the first page and begins to read the first article. He’s vaguely aware of Weasley Senior at the desk opposite him, shuffling papers around and reading a memo as it comes zooming into the office after a few minutes. The man sighs heavily as he puts the unfolded aeroplane aside. Harry glances up at him, but says nothing.
”— scared of me —”
”—he was lying on floor, quite alone. Marvolo’s ring was gone. Meanwhile, in the village of Little Hangleton, a maid was running down the high street screaming about the three bodies she’d found in the drawing room of the manor: Tom Riddle Senior and his parents… the muggle authorities were understandably perplexed, unable to determine the cause of death, because the Avada Kedavra Curse does not usually leave any sign of damage — the only known exception sitting before me”, he adds, nodding towards Harry’s scar. ”The Ministry on the other hand knew at once that this was the work of a wizard and they also knew that a known muggle-hater with a previous conviction for attacking one of the murder victioms lived right across the street. So obviously they called on Morfin and he readily admitted to the crime, claimed to be proud of it and happily handed over his wand… which was proved at once to have been used to perform the Killing Curse. He went with them without a fight. The only thing that disturbed him was that his father’s ring was missing… ’He’ll kill me for losing it’ he said, in fact, he kept saying it, and it’s the only thing he ever said again for the remainder of his life, which he spent inside Azkaban prison…”
”Well, I want a word with your team captain”, Remus says firmly. ”And Hooch. And the
”Really…” Harry mutters.
The accumulated homework of the day takes Harry a good two hours to finish and by the time he’s getting ready for bed, exhaustion is tearing away at him and he feels his eyelids droop in expectation as he drags himself to his bed.
one?” Harry says.
First of all, I want to apologise for the insanely long wait...
”What?” Harry says, falling back against the backrest of his chair again, feeling at a loss.
He turns back to Lupin and looks more closely at his face too, noticing similar changes there. Although the man looks far from well, his hair doesn’t have nearly as many grey hairs and the lines around his eyes and mouth are barely noticible.
Draco just frowns down at his breakfast tray.
”Opera, theatre, same difference”, Draco says dissmissively. ”You bring
as we’re sitting here
”Boys are so gross!”
Harry knows exactly what to expect from a detention with Toad Face by now, has every part memorised, from the exchange of cold greetings at the start, through the punishment itself, which is a confusing mix of pain and tedium, to the most dreaded moment when the woman walks over to him and grabs a hold of his bleeding hand with her own meaty paws to check the damage… but even so, even though he knows exactly what to expect and manages to get through the full three hours with his emotions in check, jaw clenched and hand moving swiftly and determinedly across the parchment, when he’s finally allowed to leave the injustice of it all, combined with the searing pain in his hand, makes his eyes well up and by the time he reaches the dungeons he has to take a moment to collect himself before entering the Common Room.
where they stand and, more specifically, where Draco stands with his father — is Draco even safe to go home to Malfoy Manor for Christmas? Or should Harry invite him home to Creirwy’s Hollow?
Then with a final, cool smirk he lets Draco pull him away. Glancing over at the house hour-glasses on the wall, he catches the last of the emereld marbles dropping into the lower half of the Slytherin one, just before Draco pulls him towards the stairs to the dungeons.
he thinks in mild interest.
”Let’s check it out”, Ron suggests and touches Harry’s elbow gently.
”Not from over there, they aren’t…” Harry says, giving Draco a pointed look. ”AH!”
”She’s not writing for the
”I mean, did you talk about what his parents have decided for him?”
Remus and Sirius takes Harry back to Hogwarts.
”I am not an orphan!” Harry yells, his fury finally getting the better of him.
There’s a brief moment of silence when Harry squints up at his daddy’s blurry silhouette, struggling to keep his eyes open while the hypnotic rhythm of Remus’s fingers combing through his hair is expertly lulling him back to sleep.
The man, who had more or less been hanging in the figures grasp, looking like he might faint at any moment, suddenly springs to life as well as soon as the figures have glided away from him. He starts thrashing in the confines of the chains and as he tosses his head back, his long, dirty hair moves out of his face and Harry gasps.
Draco nods while Harry buries his face in his hands.
“I also have here Luna Lovegood and Dean Thomas’ signed declarations that though they were held captive at Malfoy Manor for weeks and subjected to inhuman abuse, the accused often provided them and other prisoners—even the Muggle ones, with food, warm blankets and potions to heal their wounds. He did this at great personal risk to himself upon discovery. He never participated in any of the torture though he was subjected to the less than forgiving consequences at Bellatrix Lestrange’s hand for his insubordination.”
Harry thinks he might be too.
He almost spins on his heel and leaves but both Potter’s green gaze and Granger’s pleading one are fixed upon him already so all he can do is awkwardly fidget, unsure if he’s welcome.
“Why?” he asks, clearing his throat. “This is… kind. Too kind.”
In the darkness of the night with Potter’s green eyes appearing a dark blue, with Draco’s heart beating in his throat, his ears, his mouth, with a wand between them that they’re both holding, the admission feels like something more.
“Doing well,” he says, grateful for the distraction. “We just got our new shipment of Moleskine journals.”
“Calming Draught.”
Draco walks around the edge of the bed and stares down at Harry for a second before summoning a length of rope into his hands. When he reaches down to take one of Harry’s wrists in his own, the question is clear in his eyes.
His neglected dick bobs in the air but Harry pays it no mind, continuing his assault on Draco’s nipples. At the hint of teeth, Draco gasps and arches, with the soothing suckling he moans in pleasure. At the rough pinching and nibbling, he thrashes his head from side to side, lower lip pulled into his mouth, eyes closed and forehead scrunched.
Part of the reason Scorpius doesn’t allow himself to dwell on those ‘conventional questions’ (what will happen to my father… after?) is that he knows his mind will wander to Harry, and eventually his tear ducts will catch up. If he starts crying when both his parents are in the room, it will create a situation so painfully awkward that Scorpius will probably begin to wish for Death quicker than it’s coming.
Harry concedes the point.
If his magic worked anymore, he would have looked up the Transfiguration charms himself, but it doesn’t, so that’s pointless. He’s been meaning to ask Aunt Hermione discreetly when she comes to visit next– he’s forgotten the last few times.
“The Manor,” she admits, biting her lip. “I think that is where he is now.”
She shrugs. “He’s been pulling away for a while. Two years, give or take. I always thought, I always
They Floo to Grimmauld where Hermione is waiting, wand raised with a murderous expression on her face. “Draco Malfoy, who do you think you are–” but Weasley holds up a placating hand.
“The Draughts,” Potter says. “Calming Draughts.”
So instead of letting Draco go and get his lunch or whatever, Harry reaches out and almost childishly grips at his wrist and mumbles, “Stay,” hoping Draco listens. “At least till I fall asleep.” As an afterthought he adds, “Please?”
Who would have thought that he would live to see the day his fingers would begin to shake anytime he noticed someone’s eyes on him, his hands would get clammy at the mere indication of someone's approach and the notion of approaching anyone himself would make acrid bile rise in the back of his throat?
‘Draco, please,’ Harry begs, eventually. ‘Please, baby, give me something.’
By the time Malfoy’s birthday rolls around, the tentative truce they’ve struck has extended to long walks through the wizarding section of San Gimignano and brief but interesting forays into the Muggle part which usually involves copious amounts of gelato and pizza.
Draco blushes right up to the tips of his elf-like, pointy ears. “It’s not like, um, that I haven’t, um,” he stutters rather adorably, “done anything at all. Slytherin boys dorms were saintly places but the Quidditch locker rooms were a whole different story altogether and I’ve done… things. Some things. Most things. Just not…” he makes a clarifying motion with his hands and Harry bursts out laughing. When he finally reigns himself in, Draco is glaring at him through narrowed grey eyes.
‘Sit down,’ Draco says.
When Hermione Granger approaches Draco Malfoy in the middle of Diagon Alley in October after the War, Draco
Draco doesn’t know what to say to that admission of forgiveness so he attempts to lighten the mood by saying, “Enough for today. What have you got for lunch today?”
“And you broke the Fidelius Charm for that? I don’t even know what it is!” Harry asks, incredulous and enraged. Something rattles in the background and Harry feels his magic surge dangerously in his veins.
On the 2nd of January, Harry drags Draco to the Portkey Office and books two to Mumbai, India for March.
The sound hits a crescendo—his eardrums rattle with it, his breath shakes with it. The parched back of his throat is slaked with the blood of it, and the broken spaces between his ribs echo.
When long minutes have passed and he hears nothing but her breathing and the soft footfalls are she walks, Harry dares to venture a tentative, “Hermione?”
