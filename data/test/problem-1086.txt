An hour later finds us back home. Before we've even made it over the hearth, I'm clawing at the light blue jumper I'm wearing, tearing it off before ripping the white button-down underneath it. My hands then reach for his shirt. I rip it off before he can say anything and then I'm grabbing him by the hips.
"Nonsense, I hope your break was nice," She adds a wink as she stops talking, and Harry groans as I pull a mortified face.
"Hey, daddy he has my middle name!" Scorpius said excitedly. I wanted to slap my hand across his mouth the second the words escaped it. A light seemed to flick on in Harry's brain and he stared at me.
(and since it's our kids, I wouldn't be surprised if one of them did)) and were different shades of blue and purple.
the kids are out of the house," I said calmly, turning to Ginerva. She huffed, but obliged, sinking back into the cushions of the couch.
"How did it go?" Mother asked, letting Scorpius run upstairs to his bedroom. Her blonde hair was currently cascading down her shoulders, falling to her tail bone. She wore her sapphire blue dress and flats. I sighed, falling onto her couch.
I looked at Scorpius. He stared at me, his head tilted to the side. He looked so handsome in his button-up shirt and tie. His blond hair was gelled back and he could pass for me if is eyes weren't green. It was him I was doing this for. My son. The light of my life.
Draco was lying on the bed, his mother at his side. There were tears on his cheeks and he was squeezing Narcissa's hand so tightly it looked broken. When he saw me, he began crying.
After a few moments of just breathing together, Dracona helped Hailee take off the strap-on, haphazardly throwing it onto the floor beside the bed and snuggling into Hailee while the taller girl whispered a quiet
"Don't cry, Daddy," Scorpius said, wrapping his arms around my shoulders to hug me. I close my eyes tight and hold him even tighter.
After all the training in the DA, after fighting dementors in the third year, not one person, not even Luna, who never lost hope, could produce a Patronus.
"Oh, Harry, I'm so dirty!" I said, immediately trying to wriggle out of his grip. A week in Azkaban hadn't gone well for me and my tattered striped uniform was covered in dirt and goodness knows what else.
"Harry P-Potter took his life late last night, please have respect for his loved ones. The funeral will be held on Tuesday. Everyone is allowed to come," McGonagall stepped down from the podium.
"Come in," I said cooly, turning around and stalking into the house. As I walked through the living room, I leaned over and sat James in his playpen.
"Fucking hell, you better still have it," Malfoy moans. Hailee understands immediately what she's talking about. Hailee reaches around in the drawer of her nightstand and pulls of the emerald green strap-on. Malfoy moans at the sight of it.
His mum had bubblegum pink hair and every so often sprouted a pig nose. His dad held up chocolate as if to hold it to a toast, then would nibble a bite of it off.
"Yes, Ginerva?" I said, whipping imaginary dust on my pants, turning to be met with the scowling ginger.
I could feel my life falling apart as she stood here, at our front door. I balanced James on my hip and just stared at her.
"No, I'm not letting you go, not again, never again," He said. His words made me momentarily freeze as his words sunk in.
I was ready to snap some remark or other but James began crying and if he woke Teddy up I'd never get him back to sleep.
I made my way to our shared bathroom and heard him grunt as he rolled out of bed. I heard him stomp to the closet, the rattle of a hanger, and then he came into the bathroom as I brushed my teeth. He had put on a red tank top and, dear Merlin, he looked painfully hot in it.
With the boys gone and dinner dishes finished, I wiped my hands on the towel that next to the sink for that exact reason and turned around to where a still sulking Ginerva Weasley sat at my kitchen table. Harry had escaped downstairs to the basement to grab a bottle of wine at my suggestion and, now that I'm sitting here face-to-face with his ex, I wish I had been the one to go to the basement.
"I love you, Amour," Harry said back, kissing the side of my head. I pulled back and then looked down at myself, gasping in horror.
"That's a brilliant idea, Mother, why don't you and Molly here go finish the roast a-and Hermione and I can set the table," I said, nodding quickly, sending a pair of, what I hoped was, pleading eyes at my husband, who nodded and led a very stiff Mother to the kitchen, her eyes locked on a still sulking Ginerva Weasley.
I watched him flicking through the pages, staring at each muggle taken-picture in awe. He stopped at a picture of Scorpius and Blaise. Blaise was turned around, so it was hard to tell who he was unless you knew already. Scorpius was turned around too, sitting on Blaise's shoulders.
The pit in my stomach simply grew larger and larger as the house got bigger and bigger. I tightened my hold on James, who sat on my hip, fisting his chubby little hands into my hair. I felt Harry squeeze my hand that was interlaced with mine and I smiled.
"How can we help you, Ginerva?" I asked her kindly, wiping my hands on a dishtowel left next to the sink for that reason. She visibly cringed.
It was another week until Sunday Roast, where Harry and Draco decided to tell everyone. Even their boys didn't know yet.
"My parents definitely had a hard time raising me," Scorpius started. I felt Harry grip my hand a bit tighter and I turned my head to look at him. He smirked at me and I smiled, my eyes flickering down to our wedding bands. Turning back to Scorpius, I stared in awe of the young man he'd become.
The blonde leaned up and kissed the dip in the middle of Hailee's collar-bone before closing her eyes and falling asleep.
I would generally give James the entire thing but dinner was soon and I didn't want him to be too full.
When he finished, I grabbed the bowl and tossed it into the sink. Usually, I'd go ahead and clean it but I wanted to get to the living room. The yelling had simply gotten louder since I gave James his snack and I knew the only reason Teddy hadn't rushed into the kitchen crying was because of the silencing charm I'd put up between the living room and the boy's room.
"What, love?" I said, grabbing my dark green blazer before walking over to him. I sat on the bed next to him. He just grinned evilly at me.
"Draco can handle himself, I know that better than anyone, that's why I've stayed back but I'm done with you're shit! Don't you ever,
"I'm going to wake up Teddy then he, James, and I are going out for a bit, perhaps to pick up some things for dinner," I said to him. He nodded, kissing my forehead. Making my way down the hallway, I woke Teddy up and, no more than fifteen minutes later, the kids and I were out of the house.
"Hey, Haz," Draco cried. His voice was cracky and small as millions of memories went through his mind.
"I'm sorry, Dray, it was a spur of the moment. I felt so happy to feel him in my arms and I... I'm so sorry, my love," He said, pulling away so our eyes could meet. I looked into his pools of emerald. I wanted to be mad. I wanted to hex him for trying to take Scorpius away. I wanted him to hurt as I hurt.
"Can I?" He asked me. I answered by grabbing him by his neck and pulling him down to me, pushing our lips together.
"Why so fussy, my love?" I asked, lifting a crying James out of his crib. Rocking him back and forth in my arms, I shushed him lightly.
I open my eyes and look up at Harry. He's still asleep, gorgeous green eyes locked shut. His long eyelashes cast small shadows under his eyes in the faint light coming from the en suite. I then realize my shirt has been taken off and my skinny jeans replaced with a pair of Harry's old trackies that had to be tied as tight as possible in the waist so I could wear them.
"Thank you," I breathed. I turned to Harry. He smiled at me and I simply looked at him. After my freak out the week before, I was arrested and put into waiting cells in Azkaban. Scorpius had gone with Harry.
"Please," Draco said, "one more time I want to hear your voice call me your love, please, Harry!" Draco was screaming, tears running down his face. "I love you, come back to me. Don't leave me," Draco leaned down, making their foreheads touch, "come back for your little dragon,". Draco kissed the lifeless lips, tears falling down onto Harry's face. Draco leaned back and took Harry's glasses off his face. "G-goodbye, My Love," he said, his sobs making his small frame shake.
Draco had given Laura the pink shirt and handed Teddy the blue one as the kids ran over to the fireplace, where Harry flooed in.
When Ron heard the door lock he immediately ran to it. He had seen Harry walk up here. Harry had tried to take his own life only one other time.
They sat me in a wheelchair and forced Hermione to stay in the waiting room. As we got to my hospital room, I shouted out in pain, clutching at my pregnant belly.
"Somethings up. The kids are asleep and I've blocked the Floo, talk to me," Harry's eyes are filled with a sense of determination. Draco was a good liar, many knew from experience. But not when it came to Harry. He could never lie to Harry.
"Oh, it was only 15 minutes early, darling, you aren't going to die," Draco said, looking at his daughter with a hand on his hip and Teddy retreated into the kitchen.
"Aren't you adorable," I cooed, pressing a soft kiss to his forehead as I picked him up again, before laying him down in his crib. I covered him up with the quilt my mother gave me at my baby shower and watched as his eyes slowly fell closed and he drifted off into sleep.
They walked in and took a seat, Remus - who had just come from his chambers where Sirius lay - walked into the room, his face puffy from crying.
He would wake up next to me in a cold sweat and grab me tight, pulling me to him. I'd have to assure him I was alright, that they hadn't got me. Harry didn't have nightmares about Voldemort anymore, no. He had them about me. He said that every time he went to work, he would be terrified that he'd come back to find me in a pool of my own blood.
"I do live here," He said, sending a confused glance at me. I shrugged. We had an entire conversation with our eyes alone and I smirked as Ginerva gaped at us in confusion.
Scorpius is sobbing as he reaches for me. I can do nothing but cry hopelessly while screaming that I love him. But seeing Scorpius being taken away sparks something inside of me.
He claimed the stairs, slower than usual. He took in everything. Finally, he reached the top. He opened the oak door leading him to the opening of the tower. He closed the door behind him, sighing. His breath caught in his throat as he heard Ron's voice as the freckled boy walked up the stairs. The raven quickly ran and locked the door.
"Yes, my love," I gasp as he grabs me by my knees and pushes them onto the bed beside me. My thighs ache beautifully and I moan when I feel him position himself at my entrance.
"Damnit, Potter," Her strong accent drawls. Hailee looks at her with question. "You move too god damn much, honestly," And then Malfoy is on top of her, straddling her waist.
but today was simply different. Sunday Roast was a once-a-month get together for family and friends when everyone would pile into the magically held together house and laugh, talk, and get drunk off our arses.
"See you later," I whispered. Harry nodded and gave me a kiss on my head before I spun around, making my way to the door and my impatient son.
"Gross, Papa!" He yelled at Harry. Draco giggled, walking over to Teddy and picking the blue-haired boy up, he smushed kisses all over his cheeks, causing the 5-year-old to screech.
Teddy smiled as Maisie skipped over to Victorie and plopped down beside her. Victorie enveloped her soon-to-be sister-in-law in a hug and kissed the top of her head.
"Please show us," Draco nodded, slowly walking to the middle of the room. He thought of his happiest memory.
A chill of horror crept up my spine as everything began to go in slow motion. I could see it all happen as if it happened slowly.
"Fucks sake, Ginny, you broke up with me over owl the week after you left," Harry said, pinching the bridge of his nose between his forefinger and his thumb.
"Yes, now, now-" My words are cut off by a scream as he pushes into me with one thrust. My back arches and I tug him down to kiss me. He begins slowly thrusting as I fist my hands into his hair.
"I love you, Draco," He says, pulling away to nuzzle that sensitive spot underneath my ear, pressing feather-light kisses to it, not enough to make me hard but enough to make me whine softly, my hands flying up to thread through his hair.
"'Love you," He mumbled quietly, kissing my scalp gently, his lips lingering there for a moment or two more before he moves to rest his chin on my head.
" Another hiss in Parsletongue that has me pushing back on his finger before we change positions so that he's sitting against the headboard and I'm straddling him, letting him thrust his finger in and out of me.
I turn to look at Harry for the first time. I'd walked down the aisle with Luna Lovegood on my arm and I made sure to keep my eyes looking anywhere but at Harry. I let them settle on Longbottom instead. He had walked down the aisle with Cho Chang and I couldn't help but wonder if she felt the same way I did.
"Her arse will be as red as her hair," I said jokingly, causing Harry to let out one of those hearty laughs that warmed me to the bone. He moved his hand down to stroke the side of my face. I smiled at him.
"Do what? Live my life? Marry the love of my life? For fucks sake, Gin, just because you left so suddenly doesn't mean everyone's life stopped. You missed so many weddings, so many babies. You left," Harry ranted.
I walked downstairs and to the kitchen. I flicked on the kettle and grabbed 9 eggs from the fridge. Thankfully, all our kids like their eggs the same; scrambled with cheddar cheese. That was easy enough and just as I separated them onto 5 plates, Teddy was flopping his way down the stairs, James following not far behind.
But here I was, walking up to the acacia wood door, Harry's hand slipping out of my own so he could open the door, strutting through the door as if he lived there his entire life. I snorted at my thought before following him through, Teddy running into the kitchen where Andromeda always sat, drinking tea, mixing in Malt when she thought no one was watching.
Well, we've come a long way. I honestly cannot thank you guys enough for the number of reads on Come Back, I Still Need You, and Hold On, I Still Want You. This is unreal and I have you all to thank.
"Of course," He responds, gesturing for me to come up. I crawl up his body until he's lying on his left side with me facing him on my right. His right hand comes up and cups my cheek, bringing me in for a tender kiss.
"No, I'm fucking furious," I respond before looking at his erection. It's standing tall and proud and I feel my mouth water. I want to feel the weight of it on my tongue, the aching of my jaw as he pries it open.
I scream louder than I've ever screamed before until the Aurors are knocked over and Harry drops Scorpius on the ground to cover his ears. Scorpius is sobbing as he runs over to me. I fall onto the floor and grab him the second he is in reaching distance, holding him so tightly it's hard to see where my body ends and his begins.
Hailee brings her hands to Malfoy's waist, holding her tightly, suddenly filled with the urge to mark Malfoy.
Teddy had ice cream all around his mouth and some on his shirt. His hair was chocolate brown to match and I shook my head fondly at him.
A flare of something nasty found its way out of me and, before I could move or say anything, Weaslette was thrown into the back of the couch. Harry's eyes were wide as he wiped his lips vigorously with the back of his hand. I was breathing heavily.
"I need a place to stay, I thought Harry lived here," She said, sending a glance to Harry. Harry's eyebrows scrunched.
"You're Harry's maid and nanny, so how much does he pay you?" I almost lost my footing and stared at her with wide eyes. In the corner of my eye, I saw Harry choke on his tea.
"Do what?" He asked. I rolled my eyes, pulling my hand from his grasp. I begin to walk to the door but Harry is faster, he steps in front of me and pulls me into his arms.
Alarm blaring in my face, I felt Harry groan tiredly beside me. I moaned in annoyance and flicked the alarm off, flopping back down onto our bed and scooching into Harry's embrace. He was warm, like always.
"My offer still stands. Scorpius will leave with Mr. Potter, the court is adjourned,". I go to protest but soon Aurors are coming over and grabbing Scorpius, handing him to Harry.
"Seriously?" She said. Like that- all of the smiles were replaced with frowns and looks of annoyance.
"You have a son!" He exclaimed happily. Scorpius was on my lap, playing with the long strands of my hair. I whipped around to him.
"I can't help that I'll miss you, honey," Teddy physically cringed and Draco laughed, ruffling the turquoise hair.
"C'mere," Harry puts his arms out, ushering Draco into his embrace. Draco shakes his head fondly but feels himself falling into Harry's arms, letting his husband envelop him in a hug. Harry laughs again.
"Can I... can I talk to you?" I turned around to be met with the man I once fell in love with. I nodded. I turned back to Granger.
Reaching above my head, I opened a cabinet and pulled out one of the small plastic bowls we bought exclusively for James and Teddy. They were unbreakable (unless one of them cast an accidental
Harry pulled Draco into an embrace and kissed his cheek, nosing his neck. Draco let himself laugh, smiling brightly, leaning into Harry.
The last person to walk up to Harry's body was Draco. His shoes making small noises on the grass. He walked up to Harry.
"Looks like Teddy's photo collection is going to grow," Harry said, causing Draco to throw his head back and howl with laughter. He didn't know why he found the statement so funny, but he did.
"You're still here?" Ginerva drawled, seemingly annoyed. My eyes flicked to her and, for a short moment, I wished the dumb girl knew I wasn't a morning person.
"Do you remember when we sent the boys to Mother's after a fight with Weasley last week..?" Draco watched as Harry's cheeks flushed lightly with the memory of last Monday, the way Draco had felt around him, squeezing around him as they came.
The kettle was whistling now and I walked into the kitchen and quickly made 3 cups of tea, putting cream and sugar in mine, cream in Harry's, and leaving Ginerva's black, setting the cream and sugar on the tray so she could make hers how she liked.
"She's okay," She said, walking over to me and setting her on my chest. I let out a sob as I saw her. Her eyes were squinted tightly shut as she cried. She had a small patch of blonde hair on her perfect round head. Her skin was pale like mine and I decided she was the most gorgeous thing I'd ever laid eyes on.
I see Scorpius up in the stands, but instead of sitting on my mother's lap, he sat next to Harry. Pansy was sitting on the right of Scorpius, holding his hand. I expect to see Harry looking murderous at the fact that I was free. Instead, he looked very relieved and my eyebrows furrowed. Mother sat next to Pansy, looking anxious.
My eyes flickered to his middle finger, where a divide symbol lay. I showed him my hand, revealing the multiplication sign on my middle finger.
Hermione was beside me a second later, her wand pointed at the woman with a sneer that rivaled the ones I used to throw at Harry across the Great Hall at Hogwarts (which was another story).
"Hello, handsome," I greeted, sitting him on the counter, allowing him to watch as I continued to clean the dishes. Teddy giggled every time I splashed water on him and I'd smile at him.
"Oh?" He taunts, unbuttoning the button on my jeans and undoing the zipper before yanking them off my legs, throwing them somewhere out of my peripheral vision.
Suddenly, my back crashed into something hard and I heard the faint sound of Harry screaming my name between yells to stop. A fist collided with my face, once, twice. A weight was lifted off of me.
"No!" I scream. Harry seems to snap into reality when Scorpius is in his arms and gathers his stuff, walking out the door.
" It was screeched so loud I damn near plugged my ears. Instead, holding onto the facade my mother had raised me to have, I simply cringed. Speaking of Mother...
Finally, with a deep breath, I turned to Ginerva. She wore a sulk that made me want to cringe in disgust.
With a final push, I shouted out in pain, gripping Harry's hand like a lifeline. I went silent, begging to hear the quiet cry. My baby wasn't crying. She wasn't breathing.
"No!" He screamed as he ran down the stairs, running to the courtyard that he knew Harry's dead body would lay. He caught the attention of Hermione, Draco, Ginny, Luna, Neville, and McGonagall as he ran, screaming the word 'NO' over and over again at the top of his lungs and they began to run with him.
After seven years of visiting multiple mind-healers, dreamless sleep potions, tender and caring love from Harry, the happiness from Teddy, and a miracle baby, I was okay again.
"Because I want to ride you into the fucking sunset," I say simply as I feel my knees his the foot of our bed. A devious smirk comes across his face and I send one right back. He pushes me back onto the bed, crawling on top of me.
"You're a messy Metamorphogus, aren't you?" I teased. Teddy giggled and nodded, letting me pick him up and carry him to the sink in the kitchen. I sat him down on the counter and lifted the shirt off his head, banishing it to the laundry room with some wandless magic and grabbed a clean rag. Wetting the rag with water, I began to clean and wipe all of the chocolate chip ice cream off of Teddy and he giggled every time a tickled him.
"Mornin'," He mumbled above me. I hummed in response, kissing his collarbone before sliding out of bed and walking to our walk-in closet.
"Bring it in, you lot," Teddy said. The large family all bundled into a hug together and, less than 10 minutes later, Draco was crying as he waved Teddy goodbye.
"You will do amazing things, son. I got you a little something," Harry pulled out two chocolate frogs.
"Good," Pant, "grief," another pant. Harry is inhaling tons of oxygen in quick breaths while Draco is taking large, long breaths.
"Explain tonight. Come over later, 7 sound good?" I nodded silently. Afraid that I was overstepping, I kissed his cheek softly. He pulled me into a kiss.
"Ginny, that man over there is my husband and I love him! I'm tired of you trying to put him down because of his past. We've all had a shitty past! You left your grieving family behind for six years for
I raised an eyebrow at him as I leaned down to spit the frothy toothpaste out and grabbed the cup I kept on my sink to rinse my mouth before giving it and my toothbrush a wandless cleaning charm. I stuck my toothbrush in the cup and kissed Harry's bare shoulder as I made my way out of our room.
Four months later, no one had seen nor heard from Ginny Weasley (which was fine by me). Our baby was growing by the day. In fact, today was the gender reveal party.
"Absolutely!" He chuckles at me, holding his hand out and inviting me into the flat. I take his hand and feel electricity zap its way through my arm.
"STOP, MUMMA!" He begged as Draco tickled his sides. Harry lifted Laura upon his hip and kissed the top of her head, letting her lie her head on his shoulder. To this day, Harry's children were his pride and joy and he wouldn't trade them for the world.
Teddy began talking to Harry about the Quidditch game that aired yesterday and James began to yell at Lyra for stealing a piece of his bacon and I sighed as I felt Harry's ankle wrap around mine underneath the table.
"Don't think about being tired, we may be in our forties but don't think for a second that I'm not going to bend you over the counter when we get home," I just barely suppressed a whimper at that.
So pink, so pretty. I wanted to kiss him. I couldn't indulge in the kind of kiss I wanted right now, Mother would roll over and die, but I did press a peck to his lips. He grinned into the kiss and pressed his lips to mine.
"Come, Dracona, come for Daddy," Dracona screamed at the use of her given name and came onto Hailee's dick with a cry of her name. A few more thrusts later, and Hailee came too, falling beside Dracona as she pulled out.
"That was great," Draco pants out. Harry collapses on top of him, letting Draco roll onto his chest. With a wave of Harry's hand, their come and sweat are gone and they simply feel the warmth radiating off one another.
Malfoy's eyes were closed but Hailee didn't need them open to know what they looked like. The outer ring was grey, simple, stormy, grey. But, Hailee knew, the closer to the pupil, the more silver Malfoy's eyes seemed to be. The flecks of pewter color that did things to Hailee.
Sticking the plastic spoon into the light pink snack and slid it onto the tray of James' high chair. He let out a sound of approval and dug in, scooping some of the yogurts onto his spoon and stuffing it into his mouth. As he busied himself with eating, I put the groceries away and threw the reusable bags underneath the sink, beside the cleaning supplies.
"Who is this?" Harry demanded, looking upset. Before giving me a chance to respond, he stood up quickly, throwing the book at me. I dodged it.
Sirius wiped away another tear as he looked himself in the mirror. He stared at himself, lips trembling as he wished so hard that he could be hugging Harry close to his chest, helping his walk out of the hospital wing rather then what he was about to do, escort his godson out in a casket to the graveyard.
"We'll have to tell the boys," Harry says five minutes later. They're now spooning, Draco on his left side with Harry wrapped around him protectively, pressing kisses to his nape every so often.
Ginerva was looking a bit faint now and was fanning herself with her hand. Even though I didn't like her, I sent a wordless, wandless cooling charm in her direction.
me. My back arches off the bed and a horse scream make its way out of me when he plants his lips around my hole and
I was pregnant. I was over the moon excited, of course, and I knew Harry would be too, but with everything going on with Weaslette, I wasn't sure I wanted to bring a baby into everything.
I looked up at the brown eyes scanning up and down my husband's frame and felt my magic flicker again dangerously.
“Honestly! Have you two always been like this?!” Jane shouts, breaking the argument between the two of them up.
Giggling as Harry pulls him down onto his lap, Aby sits there for a moment before remembering what he was going to do. "I thought you wanted tea and a snack Potter."
“Right so I’ll be putting the anchor points on you along your body, starting at the tattoo, down to your feet, and going up your body. Now if you don’t want the snitch to go somewhere, let me know so I don’t put a guiding mark there.”
"I figured you wanted this done with," Aby replies, putting on gloves to inspect the way the snitch was healing on his skin, examining it for imperfections or ways he could improve the art before it fully set.
"You don't know that," Aby points out, snapping at Potter again. He’s about to shove him again to get to the floo when Jane wraps her arms around him.
"It comes with the territory of being a decent tattoo shop in magical London. Some wixen won't go do muggle ink so they deal with us," she explains. “There are two other shops in London, but we’re the closest to Diagon being between the main streets, but still bordering the muggle area.”
Finding Luke there, Aby is about to explain that Potter stayed the night, when the brunette walks into the kitchen far quicker than he anticipated.
Flicking on music eventually, Aby lets himself get lost in the music as he works, watching the stag come to life. It was about three hours later when he’s wiping down the finished outline of the animal, exhausted from a full days work.
“I’m sorry that you all have to deal with that. Do you get a lot of arseholes coming here?” he asks curiously.
“Is your husband going to be joining us Jane? I don’t think I’ve met him yet from coming into the shop,” he asks as she returns from the small kitchen with two packs of beer, wanting to change the subject from Luke’s observation.
Harry pulls out of his back pocket the pamphlet he’d been owled with all his preparatory steps, waving it a bit. “I did. I also bathed and took a gentle pain potion.” Harry likes that this place took in all sorts for employees - the parlour was growing on him by the minute.
“Mal-Malfoy? Draco Malfoy?,” he sputters, staring at the blonde in astonishment. His gaze roams over all of the blonde’s tattoos and piercings, wondering how it could even be the same Draco, but knew it had to be. After all his cold case had never left his desk even after five years of inactivity. He has a debt to pay back after all.
“We build in anti-muggle spells into the ink, so when you’re outside of wizarding territory the snitch will just rest. Believe me, it comes in handy. Saved me more than a few awkward conversations,” he mumbles, laughing to himself.
Harry barely makes it to the shop before closing the next day, but doesn’t want to miss a chance to see Malfoy or talk about the tattoo.
Harry watches a wry smile cross the other man’s face, as he shakes his head. “You were booked under Abraxas...as in Draco Abraxas Malfoy,” he sighs, rubbing his forehead. “So please, take a look again at our other artists' work. They have much more experience than me, and I don't want to lose this shop the commission because of a mistake, so I’ll be sure to give you a priority booking.”
"Goodness knows with him. If he's in bed already it won't matter," he shrugs, not paying any attention to the hand holding as they walk along the street.
"Just the constellation down by my ankle and small dragon on my other calf. He flies about so he's not easy to catch. Give it time though. Good ink costs money, especially muggle ink since I can't trade on it."
Several weeks ago though, he’s found one of Sirus’ old journals from his time after Hogwarts right when the first war was getting underway. Between the secrecy and planning was Sirius detailing how he’d gone into London and gotten a muggle tattoo, and how it amused his friends to no end. Soon after he got another, magical this time, that tracked the phases of the moon for Remus in case they went somewhere without a calendar.
"Well that comes with being in a society a few decades or a century behind most things, depending on the subject," Aby smirks, and leans in to focus on a stubborn curve, playing with his tongue ring as he concentrates.
Of course this meant that the week dragged on for him more than he cared to, but come Friday he leaves work early to change into something different, and floos over to Malfoy’s flat. He hopes what he is wearing works for tonight, opting for a nice pair of purposely worn jeans and a simple black t-shirt, under his coat.
"I think we all need some dinner,” Jane claps. “Luke how about you call for some takeaway and I'll fire call Michael so he doesn't think I've disappeared.”
“Why is it complicated?” Luke asks, beckoning him over to the couch with him and Jane, used to communal cuddle piles.
Harry raises his eyebrows as Malfoy said he had been thinking of one for him. “I will admit that I am already itching for another, so what were you thinking,” he asks, following him outside and down the street.
With each step down the music grows louder, and Harry is greeted with the sight of a crowd of people all packed in to watch a show.
She cackles, kissing his cheek. “I have indeed seen your cock, so I know what you have all the guys ranting and raving over.”
"I wasn’t this good at first as Luke can attest to, but I've gotten better over the years. Cooking is like potions in a way so it was a transferable skill after some practice."
Aby looks up a little taken aback by the rushed tone, his mouth agape enough that Harry can see the ball holding the ring bar in place. He closes his mouth and thinks for a moment. “I have about eight between my face and ears, and a few more elsewhere…”
Harry stammers, looking away to gather himself. “Sorry. I just...After being around Remus for so long before he passed, I just don’t think about it anymore. He got to be pretty open with me, Hermione and Ron about it,” he tries to justify. “That’s part of the reason that I hated Fenrir Greyback so much,” he adds, glancing up at Luke. “In any case, I’m sorry to hear that it happened. I’ve seen how hard it is to deal with.”
When the blonde looks at Harry with an artfully arched brow, there was no doubt in Harry’s mind who he was talking to. Seeing a scowl form on Draco’s mouth as he scans the ledger, he realizes Draco must have spotted Harry’s name - and only his first name - as he’d asked to keep the last name off in case it caused unnecessary fanfare, or in this case, a very awkward encounter.
Turning to watch the band with the blonde pressing to his side, Harry swore that he could feel eyes on him, but brushes it off - he has flirting to do.
"Oh a treat for me? A fit auror showing off his muscles," she winks as she admires the swirling snitch. "He does have such a talent for those doesn't he?" she muses as she begins ringing Harry up and handing him the healing draughts for this session.
“Yes. I’ll try and get you in some days that I don’t have long appointments running into the afternoon. I’m not charging you for this as it’s an experiment,” he added, walking Harry over to the ledger behind the counter. "I've got a smattering of day appointments but if you want to wait until Thursday and Friday we can do the last slots of the night and grab dinner if you like," he suggests, ignoring the look Jane gives him. “If we need more appointments after that we can do it then. Or do you want to do it later?”
"I guess it is. The wizard radio doesn't have anything quite like this,” he notes, knowing that he’d probably grow a third arm before the Wizarding Wireless played a gay love song. He enjoys music about people like him falling in love, living life, or just feeling, and he knows he isn’t going to get it from his world so easily. "Steph, one of the other artists, likes to go to shows and I go with her occasionally. My ex did too and I got introduced to the wonders of music outside of Celestina Warbeck that way."
Harry perks up a bit as he heard Malfoy mumbling the words along with the music, smiling a bit, finding the action slightly endearing. “One of your favorite bands?” he asks quietly after a moment, tapping his own fingers along with the beat.
“I still want her to attack my cock with a needle, Aby,” he chuckles. “I want to step up my sex game,” he adds, realizing he’s had a beer too many since he was confessing that so readily. “Anyway, thanks for tonight. I ended up having a lot of fun with you and your friends. Maybe we can do it at mine sometime. I’m at 12 Grimmauld Place. It’s unplottable, but now you have the address.”
“I don’t see how you being a Death Eater would lose him business. This isn’t exactly the best part of town,” Harry answers without thought.
“Thank you for everything Jane. Wish me luck,” Harry salutes, following her directions, and walks back to his station.
"Well that depends on you," he explains, trying not to bristle at his rarely used last name. Picking up his wand again, he taps the trace to change the outline colors on Harry’s skin, showing him some options.
As Aby descends the stairs to the basement he catches sight of Potter leaning against a wall, talking to a couple, enjoying the conversation and a drink. Catching Harry’s eye to check in with him, he sees his friend is alright and goes back to the crowd waiting for the next band to start.
“Wait...so you don’t mind sleeping with people that your friends have already slept with? I always thought that was a big no-no when it came to ‘friend code’ or whatever,” Harry questions as he stands closer to Malfoy as the platform fills up.
“Oh that’s pretty cool. I’m just getting into this whole scene honestly. Have any advice for a newbie?” he asks, with a smile of his own, trying out small talk.
"Yeah all good. The people I was talking to headed out so I came to find you. I’m sorry. I’m a horrible wingman by the way. I know you want to get laid tonight.”
“Oh wow, I didn’t know that that could happen. Hopefully you won’t have to worry about any of that with me,” Harry replies, settling back into the chair again as he decided to not complain about the pain anymore.
“I always do. We have lunch occasionally,” Harry informs him, a knot of some strange emotion in his stomach as he looks at Malfoy and sees the complicated emotions running over his face.
Aby keeps his mouth shut since Potter's idea of lucky seems to be very skewed to his own, but it wasn't his place, again. "Michael wouldn't appreciate aurors coming into the shop looking for you."
"Well the muggle world doesn't know you, but you could always get a very enthusiastic witch or wizard who would caterer too all of your needs because you're Harry Potter," he wryly suggests.
“Oh that’s okay, I’m a little early despite thinking I was going to be late, so I don’t mind hanging around the shop,” he assures.
“He hasn’t forgotten who you are, darling. He just doesn’t care about it. And Harry seems just as private as you are- so I definitely think that you should give it a try,” she encourages.
"Yes, and he's only sort of cross with me but I'm not sure how he'll be for you. At least you'll get your art finished,” she whispers through a sad smile and send Harry back to Aby’s station
“Yes, yes. You know I promised, especially now that you lot are paying me in more than just food,” he grins, smiling at his coworker and friend.
“Can I leave you my number? I mean if you ever change your mind about being friends?” asks, as he puts on his shirt, rolling up the sleeves to admire the tattoo.
After he exchanged words with the person on the other line, he gestured to the Healer's behind me. I turned.
"What the bloody hell is going on here?" I snap, watching Teddy run to Harry, lifting his hands in a demand to be lifted. Harry's expression lightened immediately and he lifted our son, smiling at the teal-haired boy.
"And I will fight tooth and nail for him. I will die and kill for Scorpius. And, Harry," I say, whipping around to him. He looks smart in his suit, his hair still a mess. He stares at me angrily.
Hailee sighed and leaned back, staring at the ceiling of the abandoned Ancient Ruins classroom they do it in. They meet every night unless one of them absolutely cannot make it. They usually do.
"Thanks, Ma," Harry said, pressing a kiss to her cheek. We sat down on one of the couches. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Ginny sit down.
Ginerva and Harry were now in the living room, sitting closer than I liked on the couch, and watching something on the telly. Teddy was still playing with his blocks and sent me a smile when I walked in the room, his eyes momentarily flashing grey.
Grabbing a spoon of my own, I slid into a seat next to James and let him babble as I ate the rest of the yogurt in the carton, listening intently as a few actual words slipped out of his mouth.
An hour of shopping and 72 pounds later found me and my sons walking back home to Grimmauld Place. After using a few discreet weight-lifting charms, Teddy held two bags, one containing bread and two bags of crisps, the other holding four tomatoes and one onion. Some other spices were also in the second bag and I scolded Teddy a few times for swinging the bags around.
"Harry, if you go, don't expect to see me here when you get back," I said firmly. He looked up at me and just stared, before grabbing some floo powder.
Blaise and Harry never got along well. They didn't hate each other but weren't the closest of friends.
When we arrived in the kitchen, Teddy had already sat both of his bags on the kitchen table and looked at me expectantly. I heard a crash from the living room and pulled a face.
Ginerva rolled her eyes before huffing and turning around, making her way back into the living room. I rolled my eyes and heard Hermione sigh.
"Why did you have to come here? Why couldn't you go to Weasley Central?" I heard Harry snort at my long-time nickname for The Burrow and Ginerva's brown eyes narrowed into slits.
"I'm so sorry, Harry," I finished. Harry looked at the table, not meeting my eyes. His jaw was tense and I wanted the world to open and swallow me whole.
"I understand that not telling Harry about his son was wrong and I regret it. But what I don't regret was having that angel," I say, turning to look at him. Scorpius is looking at me again now. He's smiling, showing off his perfect baby teeth.
"Is she okay?!" I asked frantically, five seconds away from getting up and waddling over there. I looked at Harry, breathing heavily. He looked at me, the same panic in his eyes.
"I- I," I couldn't say anything. I looked at Harry for help. He sat his tea down and looked at Ginerva.
"You tried to take him from me. My son, our son," I said, my words somewhat muffled by his chest but I knew he heard me.
"I love you too, Harry," I whisper the promise into his hair, kissing his scalp through the messy curls.
I felt Harry's arm wind around my waist and my anger went down so fast my head was spinning. I leaned on him, feeling the warmth of his torso leak through my (his) old shirt. It went almost down to my knees and had new holes every time I washed it.
Pansy walked over to Draco, picking up the blond head and sitting on her lap as she sat down. She rubbed the halo while tears rolled down her face.
"Fuck, Draco," Harry fists his hands into the sheets as he fights to arch his back. I pull away and swirl my tongue around the tip.
"Stay out of trouble, don't be like you dad," Draco said strictly, throwing a sideways glance at Harry. The brunet currently had their 6-year-old daughter in his arms.
He finally made it down the small aisle, stopping at Harry's open casket before letting the tears fall.
"Yes," I say, walking out of the closet, now fully clothed. He nods, turning around down the hallway, most likely to go get the boys.
"Mr. Potter will have full custody of Scorpius Malfoy while Mr. Malfoy will have monitored visits every two weeks," Judge Marigolds ruled.
Opening it, I leaned down to the bottom left drawer and pulled it out to reveal different cold things, including yogurt. I pulled out a strawberry one, something my son and I had in common and sat it on the counter.
It was my sworn rule, though. I would never smoke (not that I did anyway) or drink while pregnant (I did have a
"I'm so sorry, Dray," He said the moment the door closed behind us. I refused to meet his eyes. I'd always forgive him quickly but not this time. Because this time he tried to take my son. And Scorpius was my life.
"And be nice to everyone, don't get hurt, you'll give your father a heart attack if he is called to Hogwarts because you bloodied yourself up somehow. Stay on top of your schoolwork and no kissing until you're thirty!" Draco finished. Laura had her face in her palm.
"Merlin's sake, she looks like a bloody goldfish," I whispered to Hermione, who had to use her hand to hide a snicker.
My eyebrows scrunched and I looked at Harry. He looked as clueless as I felt and I turned back to her.
"Why, Hare, why did you leave us?" His voice was barely a whisper. His knees gave out and right as he was about to his the ground, Remus caught him, leading him to his seat.
I held four bags. One was filled with ground beef and the bag of chicken nuggets, along with a bag of frozen chips. The second had two boxes of spaghetti noodles with the breadsticks. The third held a bottle of Merlot. The final bag had two tubs of ice cream I grabbed when Teddy turned a blind eye.
Beside me, I hear Ronald mumbling something about being Molly's actual son and not being greeted like that. Harry chuckles before saying something along the lines of '
When I wake up again, I'm in my bed. I will my eyes shut as I feel the hardness of an all too familiar chest underneath me and a strong arm around my waist. The light of the sun is already peeking through the curtains that matched the dark blue color of our bedsheets,
Charlie sat on one of the couches with Noah on his lap. Charlie grinned, a row of his teeth showing. Noah was smiling from ear-to-ear in excitement, mumbling something or other under their breath.
I smiled at him, looking at his jet black hair and silver eyes. His skin was tan like Harry's and I remembered the day he was born like yesterday.
"Seriously, Harry?" She said again, turning her eyesight to my husband, who looked a bit taken aback.
"Hello, handsome," I greet him with a smile as he gives me a grin back, fisting his chubby little hands into my hair. I kissed his cheeks and he gave a slobbery little giggle. Following Harry into the house, we sat down on one of the many couches in the living room of The Burrow.
"You two play nice, now. I'll call you for dinner, love," I told them, running my fingers through Teddy's hair. It flashed platinum blond and I smiled at him.
I found myself straddling his lap, elbows resting on his shoulders, his hands warm on my hips as our heavy make-out turned into lazy kissing, lips moving together sloppily
"Feeling better?" His voice is deep and husky and I bathe in it for a moment, savoring the moments we can have like this, where we can just be together. No crying James, no hungry Teddy, just Harry and I alone, together.
"Yes, brilliant! Point that thing at a legal practitioner in front of an officer of the law, I'm sure that will go down well for you," I hissed, my eyes narrowing with every word.
and when she obliged, I smiled at him). When James began crying because he dropped a bite of spaghetti, Ginerva rolled her eyes and huffed loudly, mumbling something along the lines of "demon baby" and "death-eater spawn" to which I discreetly threw a harsh stinging hex at her which resulted in her death-glaring at me and me looking sickeningly innocent.
Scorpius had his fiance- nope, I reminded myself, we were at their wedding, his wife standing next to him. Hayley intertwined their fingers and rested her head on his shoulder. She looked stunning with her brown hair in a delicate updo, flowers scattered throughout. Her blue eyes were filled to the brim with love and adoration as she stared at him.
Anywho.. please let me know what you think about this chapter, I changed my mind on things quite a few times and I'm hopeful that I chose the correct path for this fic.
“Is Master Potter and Master Black ready for breakfasts?” Kreacher drawled out, wanting to continue to please his masters but secretly waiting for a moment alone with the intruder.
Draco hadn’t meant to say it aloud, and from Kreacher’s panicked look, it seems he has said something he hadn't meant to say, as well. Kreacher started to get wide eyed and a painful wail started to come from within him, making Draco step back from him.
“No- Harry isn’t in need of saving,” Granger carefully responded. “Honestly Draco, I thought Syltherins were supposed to be clever.” She sniggered. If looks could kill, Draco would have killed Granger a long time ago.
“Master Potter has ordered Kreacher not to allows yous to have more than two per week, Master Bla- Malfoy,” Kreacher looked like he wanted to wring his own neck from giving Draco the unfortunate news. Kreacher’s obedience may lay with Potter, but it was evident that Kreacher still wanted to please Draco, the closest thing to a Black he had seen in years, and follow his commands.
Granger looked at him with disapproval. If Draco hadn’t been so upset over the situation, he might have apologized about snapping at her so much.
It was a beautiful August day and the garden was even more beautiful; Fissy must have been tinkering out here as it reminded Draco of the Manor’s layout. The walls surrounding the garden were lined with magnificent purple Wisteria trees, giving the border an ethereal feel. It felt less like being trapped in a box and more like being in another world. Following the purple theme, there were dozens of clusters of Ebb Tide roses creating walking paths on the ground. The clusters led to a sizable gazebo, adorned in grape vines twisting and hanging around the structure. Everything smelled heavenly, whiffs of lavender, as well as citrus fruit of some sort, assaulting Draco’s nose, and he was overwhelmed at how the scents and scenery were invading his mind, laying calm over his body.
“Well, by your logic, if you are considered evil because you’ve been overshadowed by evil your whole life, then by default Harry is good because he has lived his life overshadowed by good.”
Today, unfortunately, it looked like, was going to include a particularly awkward and upredictable visit. Draco had been in the living area next to an open window, letting the late July breeze fill the room. He was currently reading a newer book he found in the library,
It seemed like time slowed down, but Draco could hear the clock in the corner of the room, ticking, unfazed by the silence in the room, or the subject of conversation looming over everyone’s head.
Draco’s nerves were getting the best of him as he trudged down the street until he was met with an unfamiliar twang of strong protection wards, sending shivers through him as he stepped through them. That was odd, he thought. He had never felt the wards at Malfoy Manor feel so strange, and it was especially strange since this was technically his familial home. If a ward wanted Draco out, he would not be able to get through it so easily. If a ward had accepted Draco as family, it wouldn’t have felt like that. Draco’s heartbeat picked up. Just what kind of situation was he being led into?
“Thank you, Kreacher,” Granger accepted her cup, elbowing the older Weasley, and he muttered out his thanks to the house elf as well.
Sure enough, Draco let out a mewl. Both hands fly up to cover Harry’s in an effort to keep it in place, throwing his head back to rest on Harry’s sturdy shoulder. He was so lost in the pleasure, just letting his husband do whatever he wanted to make them both feel good; he trusted Harry to take care of them.
Any time spent with Harry was Draco’s favorite thing. Even if he had to sit through a thousand corny romantic tragedies, or only eat pasta for the rest of his life, Draco was the happiest he could ever be, as long as he had Harry Potter-Malfoy right beside him. Draco had vowed two years ago to always love him, and he wasn’t ever going to break that promise.
Draco slowly came down from his high, and was a moaning mess again as Harry worked his cramps and tight muscles out with his skilled hands. He always knew what to do for Draco. He always showed how much he cared and loved for his husband in his own way, and right now Draco could feel the enormity of it all.
“Sorry to intrude so suddenly, Malfoy,” Granger finally spoke, seeming to have the most courage out of the group unanimously made up of Gryffindors.
Potter put his hands up in defense, not wanting to feel any more of Granger’s wrath. “Woah, Hermione, wait! She’s not mine, she’s Malfoy’s.” Potter said.
“Draco,” Potter nodded, shaking his hand. “I’m Harry Potter, nice to meet you. I’d absolutely love to be friends with you,” Potter said and smiled.
“Master Black?” Fissy questioned. “You will address my master as his givens name, or nothings at all.” Fissy held her head up high, looking down her nose in no doubt a learned trait from the Malfoy family. Now that she was a free elf, she could express herself as she pleases.
Draco pushed Potter’s hands off of his shoulder as he sat up and walked out of his bedroom to the bathroom in the hallway, the only room separating Draco’s and Potter’s bedrooms. Once in the bathroom, Draco shut the door, locked it for good measure, and stared at himself in the mirror above the sink trying to catch his breath and bring himself back to the present. He was alive, whether he liked it or not. He wasn’t in any imminent danger. There was no Fiendfyre.
With another smile and a “thanks, mate”, Potter disappeared and left Draco alone to his own devices. Thus leaving Draco alone in the room like he had been only just minutes ago, though this time Draco felt a bit uneasy. Why was he feeling so awkward around Potter? It’s not like he has a choice to be in this house, and like everyone said, he might as well try to be civil and take Potter’s advice and enjoy himself tonight.
could possibly do. Nothing was in his control, nothing was going his way, and nothing would work out for him, Draco had decided upon hearing the news that he was going to need another trial, and his previously decided fate had been nullified by means of mistrial.
He stood there in dark muggle jeans, blue and white checkered plaid button up, sleeves rolled to his elbows. He looked like any normal teenager, except to Draco, he was the vision of nightmares coming true. He had many dreams about the War, most of them containing Potter. He dreamt of being cursed or beaten by the boy in front of him, knowing that Draco was partly the cause of some of his friends’ death. Draco almost wished for Potter to show up while he was in the dungeons of the Ministry. Maybe if the guards had just walked far enough away, Potter could have put Draco out of his misery without any fuss and never have to worry about anything ever again.
Draco might not be able to practice with potions for a few years, but he wanted to keep his mind somewhat sharp and attuned to the subject in the event he could actually do something with his life one day.
The food is good, Draco orders the eggplant lasagna, and Harry orders chicken tetrazzini. Both men share their plates with the other and it couldn’t be more corny when they spoon feed each other bites. Soon they are both a bit giggly from their several glasses of wine each, but Draco doesn’t have a care in the world. They order the large tiramisu to-go and they make their way to the apparition point. Normally Draco would advise against apparating while under the influence, but he’s confident that he won’t splinch either of them. He’s cursing himself when he feels butterflies in his stomach as they appear down the road from home, but holds himself together. Nothing would be worse than Draco taking his turn at ruining an anniversary by getting sick all over himself in public.
12 Grimmauld Place, it turns out, is in London. The Borough of Islington, to be exact. Draco recognized the area right away. He was being escorted down Grimmauld Place from the apparition point by three senior members of the Aurors. Their badges had disillusionment charms on them to keep muggles from seeing. This batch of Aurors were all female, but they were no less intimidating than any male in the same position. Aurors had one basic job description; a Dark wizard catcher. And that’s exactly what Draco was to them, for all they cared. He wasn’t a human, or a young boy -
“Malfoy! Wake up!” Draco startled awake as he was being shaken at the shoulders, giving out an indignant cry of surprise and terror, being woken from such a vivid vision. Harry Potter stood over Draco, looking with concerned eyes through his glasses down at Draco’s sweating, heaving body, taking in the sight of the blond.
Draco cleared his throat, “I wanted to apologize on behalf of Fissy and myself. I was unaware she would show up and I can see that it has caused an unnecessary snag in your life. I will send her away at once to avoid any more upheaval in your home.” Draco almost felt sick at apologizing.
Everything feels so odd and out of place, yet it's so familiar due to it being the space Draco has spent the last couple months sleeping in. It’s like being stuck in a weird déjà vu.
When Draco didn’t respond, Potter took it upon himself to make the new member of 12 Grimmauld Place as acquainted with the house as possible, as he would be an inhabitant after all.
“We know you’ve been here for a bit, and Harry and everyone else here agrees that there really isn’t any point in you moping around for the next few years or ignoring everything going on. That isn’t a way to live,” Granger looked softly at Draco. He wondered how much Potter had told Granger about what had been learned about Draco.
“I was a slave to parents who were more concerned with blood purity than raising a child, I was a slave to the wrong side of a war, and now I’m a slave to this bond. Do you think I can really change what my fate is?” Draco asks hesitantly, not able to meet her eyes anymore, wanting to curl in on himself and not be seen any longer.
Draco put his hands up in surrender, hoping to get the house elf to calm down, and possibly leave him alone. “Okay-Okay, it’s okay,” Draco rushed out, not wanting Potter to hear his house elf wailing in pain when they were together behind closed doors, doing god knows what to the elf, “he won’t punish you for anything, you know that,” Draco tried but that didn’t seem to get the elf to calm down at all, so he tried a different tactic. “He doesn’t have to know that you said that, I- I won’t tell him if you don’t,” Draco offered, and that made the house elf perk his ears a bit from their everlasting droop on the sides of his head.
“You need to spend more time with Harry. If you deplete your magic too much, it will go through the bond and start to affect him, as well. To keep you both healthy and in magical shape, you need to be around one another. I’ve been reading a journal from a doctorate student in Russia, Karl Jakubowski, he has some ideas on what could help, but like I said - it’s just a journal, not medical fact,” Granger looked hesitant.
Potter raised an eyebrow, “I know who you are, Malfoy. Do I need to owl Dr. Inkwood? You seem a bit off.”
“Good day, Mr. Potter,” the shortest woman spoke. “We spoke earlier in the floo, I am Auror Harrissa Brynan, to my left is Auror Florence Fluke, and to my right is Auror Carrunia Joro,” Auror Brynan introduced, and it gave Draco a slight sense of relief to at least finally know the names of his escorts.
“Issa help Kreacher prepares Master Malfoy’s favorite foods. Fissy knows everything about helping Master Malfoy,” Fissy gloated. Kreacher’s ears perked at this. Maybe having another house elf around wouldn’t be so bad, especially one that happens to know so much about one of his masters.
“Merlin, I love you Draco, but why must you wake me at such an ungodly hour on our day off?” Harry asked as he tugged Draco on top of him, getting a squeak out of the older man at the sudden position change.
“It’s fairly simple, really,” she said. “You are connected to Harry. He can help resupply your magic through the bond.”
Soon enough, the languid strokes of Harry’s broad tongue turned into pointed, jabbing actions. Draco fell to his forearms at the feeling and Harry delved deeper into the man, pushing the cheeks apart for an even better angle. Had they been anywhere but home, they would have to put up silencing spells; the moans coming from Draco and the obscene slurping coming from Harry was almost deafening.
Draco sighed. Of course Potter was going to limit his use of the potion. It was highly addictive, even to someone who didn’t have mental trauma that kept them awake until the wee hours of the morning. It was Thursday, or maybe it was Friday now that it was the middle of the night, and he had already used both of his weekly allowances, leaving him stranded until he was allowed another two for the week starting on Sunday.
. Draco missed his 10” hawthorn wand. Even if he wasn’t being held wandless for his crimes, Draco didn’t even know where it was. The last time he had seen it, it was being ripped from his hands by none other than Harry Potter at the Manor just months ago.
“I’ll allow it for today, but only because it is our anniversary and because you just gave me two stunning orgasms,” Draco compromised. That made Harry smile harder, leaning over to kiss his husband.
Draco looked around the room, scanning it as if to make sure he wasn’t still in his dream. Making sure there was no Fiendfyre to consume him. His eyes fell onto the glass of water on the nightstand and immediately grabbed it, downing it in seconds. The Fiendfyre in his dream almost made Draco feel like he had been really there again, his skin smoldering hot to the touch, throat parched dryer than a desert, it felt like.
“Malfoy,” Draco corrected the elf, who insisted on calling him by the ancestral name of his ancestors that Kreacher had served for generations. “Do we have any Dreamless Sleep potion?” Draco added, knowing that there was no getting back to natural slumber after his fitful sleep.
Draco’s eyes began rolling into his head, full body spasms wreaking havoc on his slim body, thrashing still in fear, sheets soaked in tears and sweat. His vision fades as two tall figures approach him. There are voices calling to him, but he can’t respond. A shadow falls upon him, and Draco welcomes it; the darkness taking him away from his pain and letting himself plummet down into the realm of unconsciousness.
Draco had wisely saved his weekly allowance of Dreamless Sleep in favor of using it leading up to the party. Having used one last night, Draco woke up refreshed without nightmares to addle his brain, but he still felt highly-strung for the coming days. He decided to try to remain calm and just go about his day as normally as one could in his particular situation.
Draco let out a strangled moan not being able to say anything. He could feel Harry’s grip tightening on his throat and he was drowning in everything
“Young Mr. Malfoy, you have been summoned from your temporary dwelling to be made aware of the decision that has been made for your subsequent sentencing,” Kingsley Shacklebolt, the Minister for Magic, spoke. “As you are now aware, you are unable to return to your previous residence of Malfoy Manor. It comes with no personal amusement or benefit to make you aware that the only chances of you not being sent to Azkaban, alongside your father, have taken a rather cosmic plummet, all thanks to the aforementioned.”
“Harry- oh-oh-Har-” Draco called out but was cut off from his chanting when his orgasm rolled through his body, toes curling. He threw his head back and let out an animalistic wail, grinding his hips back and forth between Harry’s mouth and hand. Harry diligently worked him through his intense orgasm until Draco’s dick stopped spurting.
Now Draco just has to make sure Kreacher has gotten ahold of the present he wanted to gift to Potter. It was a small hand blown glass pendant Hungarian Horntail that was meant to add a protection charm to the wearer. Draco had seen it in an advertisement in the
With two fingers now pumping in and out of Draco’s wet hole, Harry couldn’t help but tug at his own neglected cock. Pleasuring Draco was his main focus, but seeing his husband writhing and moaning at every touch made his dick so painfully erect he thought he might burst. Not wanting to chance an awkward premature accident, Harry took his hand away from himself and set his attention back on opening his husband up.
It was true. Draco had nothing that came from the Manor, the only things he ‘owns’ are that which Potter has graciously bought for Draco through Kreacher or Hermione. Fissy really was his only connection to his past life.
“Oh, um, actually Malfoy it’s a good thing you are here. I was hoping you might actually stay for a cup of tea. There are some plans I wanted to include you on,” Potter had blurted out, seeming a bit out of breath from not enough oxygen in his lungs. Draco was perplexed. What on earth could Potter want to include him in?
“Draco, you are capable of so many things. Use that Slytherin ambition of yours and show the world who Draco Malfoy really is. Take and rewrite what is rightfully yours; your story.”
“Merlin, Harry. How did I get so lucky to have a husband who wants to fuck like bunnies?” Draco asks, sniggering, still not moving from his position.
“I’ll explain everything as soon as possible. I promise you’re in good hands until then, and you need lots of rest,” she made her way back to the door, and turned to smile and wished Draco a good day before disappearing, the door closing with a soft
“I has not broken ins, sir. Your wards simply did not keeps me out, I am here to serve Master Malfoy,” Fissy looked at Potter like he had three heads. Like he should have known that.
But boy, oh boy, was he wrong. The day that they were supposed to start packing and head to the port-key, Harry had gone and gotten himself injured during a training exercise, the dense git that he is. So the entire time they should have been relaxing in some tacky American hotel with over-priced cocktails, they were instead stuck inside St. Mungo’s hospital while Harry’s leg was being repaired. Like come on, how does someone fall and injure all four major ligaments in the knee during a training? And get a concussion so severe that he could only speak parseltongue for an entire day? Well Harry Potter-Malfoy had figured out a way.
(Same note from the beginning- I'm shamelessly fishing for comments as well as promoting my other in progress works)
fashion and made his way down the flight of stairs. Draco obediently followed. Kreacher’s voice could be heard now, sounding very alarmed and agitated, along with another voice that was much lighter and almost
“Right well Malfoy this is Ron and Hermione, Ginny and Neville. Everyone, this is Malfoy,” Harry said awkwardly. Nobody spoke, and Draco rolled his eyes at Potter because
“Kreacher, you asked what I would be needing?” Draco asked, Kreacher nodding. “What I need right now is for you to forget that you said what you said to me, and not be upset further on it. Additionally, I would like to take my bath and be in silence. That’s what I need from you.”
“Tell me what you want, Drake, baby. Wanna hear you,” Harry was leaving kitten licks all over Draco’s skin, and the blond man was absolutely drowning in Harry’s lust.
Draco was hoping Potter didn’t see his wink. Potter was just here merely asking Draco to not be so uptight and high strung at his party and here Draco was practically screaming out to Potter
When Draco first arrived, he had asked Kreacher if he was allowed inside the room full of tomes and ancient scrolls. The house elf looked puzzled by the question, deep in thought for a moment, and disappeared quickly. When he returned he had a slight airiness about him. “Master Potter says Master Malfoy is allowed ins any rooms he chooses at any times. Except for his office, Master Potter tells me everyone must knocks before entering his office,” Kreacher had informed him. That had opened many opportunities for Draco. The power he got from knowing Potter trusted him enough to go into anyroom far outweighed his curiosity of why Potter didn’t want Draco to go into his office without permission.
Harry moaned at the pull of his hair and gave everything he had in him, ignoring the ache in his jaw and quickened his hand jerking.
Harry’s resolve to keep from kissing doesn’t last long, and Draco takes it as a victory. So they snog for a while, rolling around and taking turns for control of the kiss. Neither one of them takes it further, as they both want to save their efforts for the night ahead of them. But that doesn’t stop either of them from rutting against the other to relieve some of the pressure of being turned on.
he knew who they were. It wasn’t like he hadn’t known of these people for almost half of his life. He didn’t have to say anything on the redundancy, because Weasley- er- Ron Weasley beat him to it.
If Draco had been a stronger man, he would have let Harry enjoy a lazy day in bed. He knew that Harry didn’t get to sleep in many days due to his intense schedule at the Ministry, though he kind of deserved it with his ambition to be the youngest Auror in wizarding history. It made Draco’s heart swell with pride when he talked about it, but he saw how much energy it took from his Harry to go above and beyond day after day.
“You’re trying to fight the bond, in your mind. But your soul is where your magic comes from, and that’s where the bond is. The more you ignore the bond, the more your magic will drain, which will affect you physically. You’ll be more agitated, moody and will become tired more frequently. I didn’t think you’d be this far gone with the withdrawals, though,” Granger said, tapping her fingers against the wood of the table.
Potter nodded to everyone, then let his gaze fall upon Draco, clapping his hands together once. “Well, if that is all, gentlewomen, then I’d like to take him in now, and begin the acquaintance process,” Potter shook the hands of all three women, and Draco was being pushed into the doorway by the arm on his elbow. Once across the threshold, Fluke, Brynan and Joro made their pleasantries, and took their leave, Potter closing the door and sealing off Draco’s last morsels of freedom with the heavy door.
Draco’s was holding so tight to the headboard, his knuckles were turning white. He couldn’t help but swivel his hips and push back onto his husband, loving the feeling of being absolutely stuffed full. “Harry, please,” he whined, wanting to feel everything Harry had to offer.
To mark the occasion of their first wedding anniversary the year previous, Draco had decided he was going to go all out and plan a huge, romantic weekend away in America. For months on end, he planned for this week-long getaway. He knew Harry was stressing about his Auror training and Draco himself was getting a bit too carried away in his potions research. They severely needed some time to just focus on one another, and forget about everything that was going on in their lives; from day-to-day
With a sigh, Draco said what he’s always thought about himself. “I think the wizarding world was so caught up with the Boy Who Lived, that they didn’t see the ‘Boy Who Didn’t Have a Choice’. I always felt like the victim of a twisted joke, but nobody seemed to understand me. I know it sounds conceited, ‘woe is me’ and all that. But I’ve had to live so much of my life in evil’s shadow that I can’t possibly ever be seen as good. No matter what I’ve done, I’ll always be ‘Draco Malfoy the Death Eater son of Death Eater Lucius Malfoy’,” Draco rubbed his hands over his face, feeling light headed as the words rushed from him. “Harry Potter is what you’d call ‘good’. I couldn’t ever be compared fairly to him. He defeated Voldemort, afterall.”
“Harry- want you now,” Draco gasped as Harry brushed just right against the bundle of nerves inside of him. Harry hurriedly pushed a third finger in, wanting to make sure he was open enough to fit his girth.
“Gods, you’re so perfect. Always so perfect for me, Drake,” Harry complimented holding onto Draco’s hips to steady himself and resist the urge to pound his husband right away.
“I was adequate, but Harry darling you were phenomenal,” Draco complimented. It was true; it was phenomenal sex.
“Why are you here, though?” Potter asked, “Why have you broken into my home?” Looking around, the kitchen looks like it had been burgled.
Kreacher and Fissy really went all out. There was cinnamon toast, bacon, petits pains au chocolat, omelets, yogurt with granola, tea, coffee and even mimosas were served to the pair. If Draco didn’t know any better, he would have thought this looked like a date with Potter.
“What is your name?” Granger asked after a moment, still flustered from the situation that needed to be fixed.
The aura of Grimmauld Place had shifted in the days leading up to Potter’s birthday. The house creaked less at night, and the people (Draco’s ancestors) in the portraits on the wall chided at passers by less often. Draco even noticed, oddly enough, that the house seemed to breathe a sigh of relief when it was full of chatting people; shuddering, almost as to thank the occupants for their presence.
“I’m sure you’re very familiar with our Savior. You spent the last seven years of your life trying to manipulate and thwart any attempt of his to save our world as we know it. Why he has agreed, more like he has
Suddenly, from two doors down, Potter flew out of his room and practically ran into Draco in his attempt to follow the noise, stopping short when he saw Draco’s stilled body.
by something else; a kiss. It was your souls’ way of creating an unbreakable vow to each other. I’m sure you’re aware how binding those can be,” Granger grumbled knowingly. “You need to kiss Harry periodically to keep the bond healthy, if not- you may risk getting weaker and even causing Harry’s magic to diminish.”
Harry hopped off of Draco and pulled his hips up to make him kneel again. “Grab the headboard, and spread your legs.” Draco did as he was told, knowing that Harry wasn’t shy about anything he wanted.
With their anniversary coming up, both Harry and Draco were preparing for a special night. It was their second anniversary of being married, and they desperately wanted it to be a night worth remembering. They also wanted to redeem themselves from their previous anniversary, which had gone horribly wrong.
, Draco jumped out of his bed (more like a slab with a blanket) and was brought face-to-face with his usual guard.
Anywho.. please let me know what you think about this chapter, I changed my mind on things quite a few times and I'm hopeful that I chose the correct path for this fic.
Harry pulled his mouth away from Draco’s entrance but didn’t stop his stroking. “Yeah? Want you to come, baby. Wanna have you come from my mouth,” Harry wasted no time in diving back into Draco, slightly motorboating his cheeks to get his mouth back where he was before.
Draco helped clean up the mess the best he could, Potter doing most of the work since he used his wand. They didn’t speak a word until breakfast was served. There were so many stainless steel cloches sitting atop platters of food on the small table, Potter needed to transfigure the table to accommodate their plates.
He feels heavy in his bed, yet something feels off. His sheets are scratchy against his skin, but Draco feels almost like he’s floating, levitating in bed somehow. The limbo between sensations is making him feel queasy, and he has to focus on curling his toes to stop the wave of nausea.
“Kreacher does not deserves Master Black- er Malfoy- giving him helps. Kreacher doesn’t wants Master Malfoy to lie for him,” Kreacher teetered between relief and pain, wanting to please both his masters, but Draco knew he couldn’t disobey Potter.
Draco let his mind slip to thoughts of the alternative route his life could have taken. If it hadn’t been for Potter, he wouldn’t be able to experience this garden. Instead he would have been locked up in a dingy cell surrounded by death and despair. Clementine brought him back from his thoughts.
Again, I'm terribly sorry for the time in between chapters. Life has been weird lately, so please please please forgive me for not updating in a bit!! Here's another chapter, as you might notice I had extended the chapter count because I don't think I can finish this story in less than 4 more chapters sooooooo yeah. Thank you again for the support and please comment/leave kudos/subscribe/do whatever makes you happy I just like validation haha!! Enjoy
It was enchanting, and Draco was mesmerized. He barely heard the slight clearing of a throat, so caught up in the flora bombarding his senses.
Who was Shacklebolt even talking about? Why couldn’t anyone give him any clear answers? And where in bloody hell is 12 Grimmauld Place?
“Right, well you can borrow some things of mine until I’m able to take a trip to Diagon Alley. Might have to send someone else, maybe Hermione since it’s hard for me to be in public right now,” Potter stated. Of course it’s hard for him to be in public, Draco thought. What with thousands of witches and wizards wanting to praise Harry Potter, the boy who lived, for saving the wizarding world and defeating the Dark Lord. Draco had a sudden epiphany. How could he be so stupid? Of course Shacklebolt had been referring to Harry Potter, of all people. The
The Aurors took their wands out, Draco assuming they were under a disillusionment charm inside of the wards, as there were some muggles out and about, seeing as it was beginning to transition into warmer summer days, from the cold, dreary spring. The wands pointed at the bricks that were in between number 11 and number 13. An unfamiliar incantation was muttered by the shortest of his escorts. Soon, Draco began to see why exactly there had been a missing place number.
Draco followed Officer Otters, and another guard, unfamiliar to Draco, flanked him in the rear. He was brought to the lift that was promptly opened upon their approach. Draco had only been in this lift three times, now four, but it never made him any less nervous to be trapped in such a confined space with people he didn’t know and with no protection.
“Harry!” Draco shouted, getting so close to falling over the edge again in such a short time frame. He could feel the heat starting to seer through him, starting in his curled toes, working up his body as Harry kept sucking. Harry’s fingers jabbed hard into his prostate, and Draco’s body arched up, coming harshly into his husband's greedy mouth. Draco’s own mouth opened in a silent scream, feeling so overstimulated from the entire night’s events.
“Yeah, enjoy yourself. You don’t have to be miserable your whole time in my house. I understand you’re here to serve your time, but I think what you’ve been through and continue to go through is punishment enough,” Potter can’t be serious. This has to be some sort of joke. That’s all Draco could think, because
“Gonna make you come again, baby,” Harry whispered and didn’t give Draco enough time to react before sucking his hard dick down and shoving two fingers into his gaping, wet hole. All Draco could do was moan and grasp at Harry’s hair, holding on for dear life and Harry began bobbing his head and fingering his hole with clear purpose.
Draco stared incredulously at the door where the woman had disappeared as fast as she had appeared. His mind was racing with thoughts and he can’t help but feel groggy again, or maybe that’s the medicine flowing through his veins. He can’t tell, and soon enough he was back in his comatose state but not without the eerie whisper of
“Harry! I cannot believe you!” Granger shrieked, smacking Potter on the arm. “You bought a house elf and didn’t have the audacity to tell me first? You know how I feel about elvish welfare and I cannot believe you went behind my back like this. I still haven’t gotten around to the idea of Kreacher, let alone another undeserving servant!”
Harry’s thrusts were getting a bit skewed, having a hard time holding back his own noises, grunting on every thrust in. He didn’t think he could hold off from his orgasm again, he wasn’t that strong of a man.
Draco swallowed hard. Were they asking for his permission? This was his house as much as Malfoy Manor was his house. He had no ownership, no say in the on-goings or anything. What could they possibly be including him for?
“I’m- I don’t know. I was on my way to the bathroom,” Draco answered, giving Potter a less than postured shrugged.
All four people stared at Draco, they hadn’t expected to see Draco, though none of them reacted past wide eyes. He probably would have been hexed if they didn’t know Draco was already in the house. His presence was surprising, but expected. Draco stared back, equally shocked to see the faces in front of him, noting two red heads,
“Honestly, Draco, I don’t know why you don’t just let it go for now. We’re doing everything we can to solve this,” Granger reached across the table and rested a hand on Draco’s fist that lay next to his tea. Another thing Draco has noticed, Granger had been calling him by his first name, instead of his surname like usual. He didn’t retract his hand like he would have in his younger years, instead enjoying the warmth from her hand.
Draco spends the next hour or so dozing in and out of slumber. Whatever medication he is being administered clearly has a dose of sedative in it, since he had just woken up from sleep and felt like he could sleep even more.
Looking further around the room, Draco sees that his room has been altered. He can clearly see that it is his room with the tell-tale haze of magical charms floating around. The charms are some sort of transfiguration, making the space more resemble a hospital suite than a bedroom. Even his bed has been modified, with rails on the edge of the queen sized mattress.
Sometimes Draco had to be reminded just how powerful a house elf could be, especially if they had been within a powerful magical house with strong magical masters. Depending on how well the elves were treated, they could become more powerful than their own masters. That’s why most house elves were treated like scum; to keep their powers diminished just enough to serve what their master’s required and nothing more. Kreacher obviously had strong magic within him, but his allegiance to the Black house and Black family were much more potent than any desires to overcome his masters.
“Well, how the tables have turned, eh Potter?” Draco snickered, though low in his belly he felt a bundle of nerves building at the sudden influx of thoughts as to what Potter needed help with. Maybe he needed help shaving that god awful scruff from his face that seemed to be growing darker and thicker by the day, as if Potter wasn’t even aware of its existence.
“You’re a free elf? And you’re choosing to serve Draco Malfoy?” Granger wasn’t convinced, but then she looked down at the clothing Fissy was wearing. Draco had insisted that she get rid of that horrendous smelling potato sack and put on actual clothing, though Potter had to help with that bit as nothing was her size and needed to be transfigured into smaller proportions. Granger was smart, Draco knew that. It wouldn’t take her long to figure out that if Fissy was wearing clothing, then she was indeed free to do as she pleases.
, the lube charm. Harry lubed up his long digits and pressed one in, nice and slow. Draco moaned and asked for more and Harry obliged after pumping in and out a few times. Draco liked to feel the stretch, Harry liked to please Draco.
So yeah, it was a great anniversary, even though they had to throw away the forgotten tiramisu. Draco was just happy he gets to wake up every morning with his favorite person by his side, and he gets to call that person his husband.
“Master Harry Potter has requested that I helps Master Draco Black with whatsevers he is needing,” Kreacher’s drawl slightly soothes the ringing in Draco’s ears that he hadn’t noticed until that moment. Of course Potter sent in the house elf. Couldn’t just leave well enough alone and let Draco get through this himself.
Draco had finally looked up, only to stare incredulously at the Minister. His confusion diffusing into the stuffy room and the burn of eyes upon him escalated.
To Draco’s surprise, Potter had been quite enthused about Draco joining him for meals. The conversations were kept in a safe zone, respectful of both parties, topics always being something they both could easily participate in. This left only a few subjects; quidditch, Grimmauld Place, and Potter’s upcoming party.
“I hope you like it, Draco! Your house elf was such a huge help in this, I can’t thank her enough,” Dr. Inkwood said, gesturing for Draco to sit opposite her in a cozy wooden chair adorned with a cushion and knitted blanket. Draco notices that she had a long floral dress on again, this time with a flowing pleated skirt. She looked radiantly beautiful and Draco had a moment of jealousy that she could look like that almost effortlessly.
Harry pressed forward, popping his head passed the tight ring of muscle and paused to give Draco time to adjust. He pushed further again, slowly inching in to be fully seated in Draco’s tight, wet heat.
“I- I want your mouth, Harry,” Draco was so out of breath and he hadn’t even been doing any work. “I want you naked,” he added, wanting to see and feel all that Harry has to offer. Harry chuckled at Draco’s words and effortlessly vanished his clothing, earning himself another groan from his husband.
“Oh, Harry,” Draco choked out, obviously becoming emotional at Harry’s words. Normally, Draco didn’t wear his heart on his sleeve, and neither did Harry. But here and now, with so much love in the air and nothing to lose by letting go, neither man had it in them to hide the tears that they shared together. It was always sickeningly obvious to others just how much the pair loved each other.
But alas, Potter had never shown up to fulfill Draco’s death wish. Yet here Draco was, perched on the lowest step to enter the home that astonishingly seemed to belong to the very last person he would ever have thought of when he apparated side-along to Grimmauld.
Draco cleared his throat and regained his composure. “Well, I suppose I could do with a firewhiskey or two,” he said with a smirk and a wink.
Once Draco had given every account of his past that he could remember, it was his turn to ask questions. It was only fair, he thought.
The next few weeks pass rather smoothly. Granger sets up camp in Potter’s library, working tirelessly for any clue how to deal with the ‘soul bond’ as everyone is now referring to it. Each day, Granger would report to Potter and Draco separately-as they haven’t spoken a word to each other (Potter’s birthday gift stowed away in Draco’s sock drawer). Draco did his best to help with the research, picking through the texts that felt a bit outdated, maybe even archaic. He mostly tried to absorb what Granger bestowed on him, but noticed his energy levels were draining as the weeks wore on. His muscles feeling numb on occasion, and a constant throb in his temple were the most irksome to Draco.
, he called him. Draco had never felt so humiliated than right now, reality finally hitting him that he would have to live with this person for the next five years.
I'm SOOO sorry I haven't uploaded in a few days. I was distracted because it was my BIRTHDAY!!!! But yeah, now that that's over with, I should be back to a more regular schedule with my uploads. I'm also starting writing some oneshots if anyone would be interested in those :) I have a DM/HP oneshot up right now and I'm currently working on a One Direction Larry Stylinson oneshot soooooo if that's your thing please go check it out :D
“I haven’t the foggiest idea what you’re going on about,” Draco commented nonchalantly, sniffing his nose.
But that was years ago, and Draco had learned to cope with losing both of his parents. It brought him closer to Harry; both knowing what it's like to be orphaned, though Draco’s circumstances were much different to his husband’s, it still made him feel more connected.
Draco was a little disgruntled at the thought that his only contribution to the party was something as menial as picking music and colors. But then he remembered; everything else either requires magic or the ability to leave the house. Both things he was unable to do, so he took the job without any verbal complaint and set out to be an overachiever. Not like he had anything else to be doing, anyway. And Potter actually had a decent musical library.
The party wasn’t supposed to begin until 8pm the next day, the day of Potter’s birthday being a Friday meant they needed to plan around people’s work schedules, and not wanting to have the party the day after on Saturday in favor of the birthday boy being with everyone on the day of. Draco hadn’t been on board with that decision, but since it was Potter’s decision and the entire party was to be celebrating Potter, nobody objected.
Harry carefully pulled out of Draco and flipped him over, the blond going boneless from the lack of oxygen and the blood flowing back to his brain. He looked totally blissed and fucked out, but Harry wasn’t done with him yet.
“Malfoy, I need a favor,” Potter said. He was within a meter of Draco and his cologne was rather strong, smelling of cedar and citrus. It was quite overwhelming.
“Harry, I would say any anniversary spent with you is more than okay. I love you more than anything, and I’m so lucky to have such a caring, loving sap of a husband who just so happens to have the biggest dick in all of Europe,” Draco nudge Harry’s nose with his own, giggling at the end, not being able to keep a straight face. Harry giggled along with him.
Draco was sentenced to twenty-five years of house arrest. He had been held in the dungeons of the Ministry of Magic until his trial was brought before Wizarding Britain’s highest court of law; Wizengamot. Draco had not been allowed to be present for his own defence. He was told his presence was only necessary to be read the disciplinary actions bestowed upon him. Draco wanted to fight it, but there really was no way anything good could come about it. It wasn’t fair, no, but why would anyone in their right mind be
“Give me your best answer, nothing is off limits or wrong to say,” Clementine assured, resting a comforting hand on his elbow as they strolled between roses and other various plant life.
“I love you more than words, Harry,” Draco broke the kiss. He knows that Harry knows how he feels, but he still likes to tell the man how much he loves him. It had taken him a long time to figure out just how much Harry meant to him, and even longer to finally be able to tell him in concise words. The whole ‘growing up with emotionally distant parents and thinking you will die by the age of 18’ thing makes it weird to express emotions properly. Thankfully Harry had given Draco the time he needed to get his head out of his ass. He can’t imagine not having this gorgeous man in his life. If Harry had pushed Draco to commit sooner, it might have ended badly, but Draco doesn't like to think about what could have been, when the present was everything he’s ever dreamed of accomplishing.
Slowly, and rather loudly, the numbers 11 and 13 began to separate, revealing brick by brick the home that Draco had only ever seen in photographs that his mother had shown him years ago. Number 12 Grimmauld Place. Draco was able to deduce that the home was under a powerful Fidelius charm to keep muggles and unworthy wizarding folks at bay. Stood in front of the building, Draco felt small, and that was saying something as Draco was quite tall and lean.
Draco was finally left to his own devices, where he should be thinking over the dream he just had. He needed to get some closure, but the only thing that his brain was allowing for thoughts was
Draco nodded. It was one of the few forms of communication Draco had granted towards the master of the house. He hadn’t spoken a single word to Potter in the entire time that he had been staying at 12 Grimmauld Place. This weekend marked exactly one month since moving in, and Draco still couldn’t get used to being in the presence of Harry Potter every bloody day. It was like torture, being made to cohabitate with the man he swore to never see again.
So now it was a year later, Harry having fully recovered from his foolish injury and was in full swing of his Junior Auror career. Draco had even accepted an potions apprenticeship at The Apothecary in Diagon Alley. Things were finally falling into place, but it was much harder now to go on vacation abroad for an anniversary, so Harry and Draco did what they could to make it a special day, nonetheless.
This created a major problem, mainly for Draco, and total chaos within the Ministry rumor mill. If he was not able to return to the Manor until the Master of the house lifted the wards, then he would no longer qualify for house arrest. Draco didn’t know what to do, there wasn’t anything that
Bliss. Pure bliss is all Draco can compare to what Harry is doing to him. His warm, wet mouth against Draco’s taut rim. His body was so responsive to Harry’s touch, trembling at the intimacy and pleasure of the ministrations.
“... However, Mr. Malfoy, you seem to have made at least the smallest of ripple effects outside of your usual activities leading up to your time here,” Shacklebolt reminded Draco of Officer Otters, not only in their appearances but in their demeanor. They both had nonchalant ways of carrying themselves, exuding authority without being overbearing or threatening. “You have had a saving grace come to you in the form of a savior that is known to all of Wizarding Britain,” Shacklebolt continued. What does that even mean,
Kreacher bowed to Draco, standing up as straight as his body would allow after, and giving Draco a resolute nod. Kreacher gave Draco a once over, snapping once more to make a pile of fresh clothing appear next to the folded towels before putting on a calmer face and disappearing with a
’s market section and thought it equal parts ironic and useful as Potter had fought the Horntail (and nearly perished) in 4 year, and was known for getting into situations needing a bit of extra protection.
Potter nodded. Draco wondered what they had talked about. Maybe Shacklebolt had tried to persuade him to reconsider his agreement again, Draco hoped. Potter added nothing.
He was just a Death Eater that got caught and the marred skin of his left arm would be proof forever of his wrongful involvement in the War.
So they got engaged and had a large party to celebrate the both of them, and an even bigger wedding the following year. Anybody who was anybody was in attendance of the union between Potter and Malfoy. Of course, everybody was there but Malfoy’s own parents. His father was rightfully rotting away in Azkaban and his mother had been so distraught about losing her husband to Azkaban that she literally went looney. She had to be sent to the mental ward of St. Mungo’s and they kept her there until Draco was able to find a more permanent setting for her to be cared for. She still knew who Draco was, but sadly wasn’t able to cope with much more than simple small talk. The day that she was transferred to her nursing home, Draco had cried and Harry had rocked him to sleep. That was the day that Draco decided he only needed Harry in his life, and coincidentally it was the same day he decided to sell Malfoy Manor, in favor of living at Grimmauld Place.
His peaceful browsing of the pages had been abruptly interrupted by the sudden roaring to life of the fireplace. Bright green flames rushing into the room from the chimney gave Draco a proper scare, and then without any warning or time to prepare for what was happening, four familiar faces stepped through the floo, one right after the other. Draco was stunned, paralyzed in his lounging position of the chaise longue.
Draco thought. He supposed he could always ask in the appointment, and started making a mental list of all the things he wanted clarified as soon as possible. Over the past few days, he had lots of time to think.
Draco had been quite peeved when he got the owl from Ron Weasley stating that there had been an accident involving Harry at the Ministry. He had specifically asked Harry ahead of time to take the week off including the day they were to travel, but Harry, being the stubborn, workaholic prat that he is, asked if he could work up until it was time to go for the port-key. Draco only conceded because Harry asked him while batting those pretty lashes at him, not being able to say no to his gorgeous green eyes. Well, that and Harry sucked him off twice that night in means of convincing him to change the plan.
“Drake, baby- oh gods, I’m gonna come, oh-oh,” he punctuated each word with hard thrusts, feeling his core clenching with the effort and impeding orgasm.
“Fuck, I love this,” Harry moaned into Draco’s mouth, bodies moving together with the air of familiarity. Draco moaned back, his hands traveling anywhere he could reach and Harry pounded into him from behind, his leaking erection bobbing with each thrust.
“Do you see yourself as good or evil, Draco?” Clementine broke the silence, letting Draco set the pace for the walk, knowing he was still recuperating.
They lay like that for a while, enjoying their post coital haze. They talked about everything and nothing at the same time, just appreciating one another, whispering
Granger had stormed out of the floo disheveled into the living room at half 10 the next day with panic oozing in her voice as she explained to Draco and Potter that the intended caterer for the event had suddenly dropped dead the night before. Apparently he had had a stroke, and Granger was teetering between being upset that the man died, and upset that now she had no idea how she was going to follow through with the party without the huge amounts of food that was ordered.
“Yeah, you were amazing love, loved every second of it,” Harry said, crawling up to lay next to Draco, pulling him into his body to tangle their legs together.
He had been poked and prodded and spells cast upon him that he couldn’t even identify. Draco also knew that his memories had been extracted, duplicated, and examined, though he was never told what they had found out.
later, Draco stood at the end of a long, abysmally white table, not being offered a chair, still being flanked by Otters, and Nichorn Wranrie, according to the badge Draco was now able to read. He was being stared at by no less than 15 members of Wizengamot, sitting around the long table, seemingly only the most senior members in attendance of the intimate meeting. Draco averted his eyes downward to the blinding table. It seemed to radiate heat, or maybe that was just the feeling of having so many judging eyes on oneself.
his D.M.L.E. badge read, his identification picture obviously hadn’t been updated recently as he was clean cut and shaven in the photograph, and younger then but he was now sporting a shoulder length tight braids and a tidy beard speckled white from age, perfectly contrasting his dark, blemish free skin.
Friday morning arrived and Draco got up early to make Harry breakfast in bed. He wanted to go all out for his husband, but he knew the man could barely stomach more than tea and toast before 9 am so that’s exactly what he made. He could have had Kreacher make the breakfast, but he wanted it to be special. Plus the old house elf never got over the fact that Draco sold Malfoy Manor, stating that such an heirloom should have been kept in the family. He didn’t want to bother the aging elf.
Draco had reluctantly agreed to stay for tea, only answering in a slight nod of acceptance of the situation. It wouldn’t look well upon him to openly deny a direct invitation from the host in front of guests. Draco was better mannered than that.
Harry removed his fingers, earning a whine from Draco at the emptiness. He grasped his erection and whispered another lube charm to coat himself and lined up to Draco’s waiting hole. “You ready, baby?” Harry asked as he teased at Draco’s opening with the head of his dick.
"Harry, Draco!" I smile at Hermione Granger, now 26, as she ran up to meet us, baby rose cradled in her arms. Weasley was coming up beside her, wrapping an arm around Harry, pulling him into a hug as Hermione and I kissed each other's cheeks.
"Bye, Nana!" He called, throwing himself into Mother's arms. I wanted to scold him because, even with her beauty, my mother was getting older and more fragile. God forbid I say that out loud, I'll face the end of her wand.
"I asked everyone to find you. I went to the Manor, I went to Pansy's, I looked so hard for you,". My expression softened.
There was a tent in the front yard with two bars, one serving champagne, the other with virgin drinks (mostly for Hermione, who was still breastfeeding, and me). Harry indulged himself in a glass or two of champagne, asking me if I was sure three times before he drank it. I wasn't an alcoholic or anything, but I did like a drink every now and then.
You may not understand this with your little cashew-sized brain but I am, technically, a Black. Not to mention, Harry now owns this house, and the contract we signed six
"Ginny, I think it's best if you leave," Molly finally said. The read-head whipped around to her mother.
"I'm going to get breakfast started. Make sure the kids are awake for me, yeah?" I asked with another kiss on his forehead. I felt him nod rather than see it and smiled as I slipped out of the bed for the second time.
" Malfoy let out between bounces. Hailee moaned as the strap-on teased her clit with it's vibrating while Malfoy's bounces added pressure that Hailee wanted to die from. She tried to imagine what Rox and Holden would say if she died because of Malfoy's sex. Nothing good, she guessed.
"Harry, if another child squeezes its way out of me, I won't be able to get my body back a fourth time!" Harry remembered Draco's argument. It led to, protected, sex on their bed which led to sex in the shower which led to Draco being horrified that he was pregnant again when in fact he had a cold.
"We've been doing everything we can to get ahold of him, no one can reach him," I let out a sob of protest. Someone had to be able to reach him. I heard a crash in the hallway and Healer Marshell whipped around to look, then looked back at me and smiled.
"How?" Draco ponders a second later, turning around to look up at Harry, who has the beginnings of a smile around his mouth.
"I WANT DADDY!" Scorpius screams, kicking his legs as he reaches for me. I try to run after him but Aurors stop me, two of them holding me back.
"It's alright. James was too busy stuffing his face with yogurt and the silencing charm between here and the boy's room is still up so Teddy didn't hear anything," I explained. He nodded, then gestured to the floo. I nodded.
?" Andromeda had to stop my Mother from storming towards the ginger. I was about to say something when the woman's legs suddenly seemed to become jelly and she sunk to the ground.
"Put a bloody shirt on," I hissed in his ear. He kissed my cheek and looked cautiously between me and Ginerva before turning on his heel to our bedroom, Teddy still in his arms.
It was sloppy, teeth clashing and tongues dancing with each other. The morning breath was something the both of us could overlook, I thought, as his hands traveled down to my hips, gripping them hard. One of my hands moved into his hair as the other cupped his face before sliding down his chest.
"Well?" Harry's voice had Draco sucking his lower lip into his mouth, chewing on it until Harry's hand reached up to free it with his thumb. His hand moved down to grab Draco's.
The day Harry and I began going out, it was national news that The Chosen One's girlfriend had disappeared, leaving only a note explaining that she "needed a break after fighting so hard". Harry found me in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, my arm streaming blood.
I knocked on the door. It swung open not a moment later. Harry greeted me with a smile and pulled me in for a kiss. I kissed him softer than he would've liked because he tried to pull me back to him.
After having Jonah, Draco got pregnant again and had Maisie. He put his foot down after Maisie, refusing to have any more children.
"What?" I ask with my mouth full, sending him a dark look. He smiled at me and leaned over the table to wipe the side of my mouth, laughing lightly.
"We're making a mistake," Harry said jokingly. Draco shook his head, walking over to clean Laura off.
Ginny looked almost miserable as she and Harry interlocked their hands, getting into position to make an unbreakable vow.
Harry continued writing, the quill scratching against the parchment. Another teardrop fell onto the yellow paper.
An hour later, Hermione, Pansy, and Ron walked up to the Gryffindor Boy's Dorms to find Draco laying in Harry's bed, wearing that pink hoodie that Harry would always wear, silent tears running down his cheeks.
"I don't see why I wouldn't answer the door if I live here too," I clarified, turning around and flicking my wand at the dishes in the sink one by one.
I quickly ran over to my wand, lifting up and waving it in the air, demanding it to call my husband.
She stood in the corner of the room, smiling softly. Molly stood next to her, hands clasped over her mouth in excitement. Andromeda stood beside Molly, wearing the same smile Mother was and sending me a sort of
A beautiful silver stag erupted from his wand, it stayed for a good minute before Draco collapsed onto the floor, sobbing.
"But what if the secret is so bad that you would possibly hate me from keeping it from you. That you'll never want to see me again," I said, begging him to understand how serious this was. Then he spoke a few words that made me truly think I could tell him.
"The Patronus Charm is a spell used to fight off Dementors. It is a very hard thing to do. Most full-grown wizards have issues trying to do the charm. A few people do. I have taught this charm before. An a-amazing wizard learned this at just 13. You have to think of your happiest memory while saying," Remus pulled out his wand "Expecto Patronum!" A silver wolf ignited from the tip of his wand but faded quickly.
Her mouth still opened, Ginny slowly walked to the door and, with last longing look at my husband, she was gone.
"Dray, does Sherry go well with pumpkin pie? I know you and Molly made some and-" I cut him off by nodding my head excitedly, grabbing at the bottle of white wine as a small child might grab at a toy in a store window. Harry chuckled and handed me the bottle before turning to Ginerva.
Hermione, Ron, Draco, Pansy, Neville, Blaise, Ginny, and Luna were all gathered at Gryffindor table. You didn't have to look close enough to see one empty seat in the group.
Harry held me to his side as Pansy and I talked about her new Louis Vuitton bag that Blaise had bought her as an engagement present. I cooed over it and began crying when her wallet was a different color than the bag, when they were, in fact, a set.
"Because I made a mistake," Harry says simply, crouching down to be at eye level with a still-angry Scorpius. I just watch them, my tears slowing. Harry looks at me then.
Weaslette turned her nose up and huffed. I was panting softly now, my knees feeling somewhat weak as I basically crushed all my weigh over Harry. He held me throughout it all, summoning Weaslette's suitcase wandlessly with a quiet whisper of an incantation I didn't hear because I couldn't hear anything over Weaslette's voice ringing in my ears.
Eyes fluttering open, the first thing I was met with was the face of my husband. I blinked a few times and everything came into focus. Something soft and wet brushed against my lip and I jumped before Harry's hand came up to cup my face, moving some of my hair out of my face.
"Daddy is going to take you to Nana Cissy's for a bit, sound good?" I asked him. He nodded and jumped off my lap, walking over to Harry.
Aby worked on his notations and charm notes as Harry talked to him, glancing at the glowing stag every so often.
“Alright Aby, I was just curious. I haven’t been a part of the gay community for as long as you have apparently - still learning,” Harry mutters, putting his hands up in surrender. “You’ve never thought about settling down with one guy though?” he probes, glancing over at him, using the moment Malfoy thinks of his reply to take him in.
“Take off your shirt and sit down with your chest to the back of the chair. I should be done within the hour," Aby says without looking at Harry, causing the auror to frown at the way he was spoken to.
Harry hands in the doorway for a moment, watching the man eat and relax before he steps into the room
Aby walks him out of the station and into quieter part of the city, knowing the route to Will's house well. Stopping in for some food, he pays for them both informing Potter he could get the alcohol, and leans against the counter with him, eating the vinegary goodness. "So how was your week?"
"He always seemed like a good father. Honestly the Weasleys are a lucky bunch and I wanted to send their mother a gift for getting rid of Aunt Bella," he mirthfully admits. "Speaking of the Weasleys, has Granger had her child yet?"
“I wouldn’t do that!” Harry exclaims, looking between Jane and Malfoy. “Not only is Jane married but she’s a business owner at the place I do business! Care to sit in while she does her job just so you can make sure I’m not playing the field and fucking her?” he continues, glancing at Jane apologetically.
Harry pouts a little when the two men abruptly leave. He thought he was getting on pretty well with Leo; it had been a while since he's been touched like that and was enjoying it.
“Aby’s my lovely test subject. I was seeing if I could get six different charms into one ring, so Aby brewed the antidotes to some common poisons, and tested the jewelry for me. If the ring does it’s job it can detect up to six kinds of poisons or drugs and gives the drinker an antidote by delaying some effects and identifying what was ingested. Handy for people out at bars or people with very interesting jobs,” she finishes, looking rather pleased with herself.
“I don't have a muggle mobile so I won't be able to do much with a number," he shrugs, taking his gloves off. "Just watch out for my mother will you?” he asks, before Potter leaves his station and the shop.
“No, no. I would never say anything bad about him to you. Godfather’s are important to people, Sirius was important to me even though he wasn’t in my life for very long,” Harry assures him, wrapping an arm around Malfoy’s torso, pulling him closer. “What...what did he say whenever you came out to him?”
Aby instructs him to sit back down and begins to prepare his tray, were he lays various inks, bottles, and his inking wand. Adjusting the chair, Aby slides his stool over and get ready to work.
Ignoring Harry, Aby sits on his stool, stretching his neck at bit. "Just give me a moment. Skipped lunch taking that wanker and I’m rather hungry," he sighs, summoning his lunch from his charmed carry all.
"I... I never got my tattoo removed," He said. He whispered it, but due to the silence, everyone heard him. My breathing hitched.
saying anything bad about my husband or our kids ever again!" He was in her face now, their noses almost touching. His face was painted red with anger and his magic felt even stronger. Ginny sat there, her mouth opening, then closing again.
"Harder, oh dear god, please go harder," I'm begging shamelessly at this point. When his hand wraps around the base of my cock, my eyes fly open and I'm scratching at his back.
"Come on now, love. Let's go see Nana Cissy," Scorpius wriggled his way out of Harry's grip. As he patted his way to the door, I turned to him.
"Hi, baby," Harry cooed at him, kissing James' forehead. I smiled at them when James started giggling, running his hands through Harry's hair. He'd grown it out and it now reached just below his ears. Mine was at my tailbone now and Teddy loved trying (and failing) to make his hair look like mine.
I wound both arms around his neck and pulled him down to kiss my lips. Our lips met and, before long, his tongue was prodding its way in, finding mine quickly. Our tongues interlocked, our lips moving in a dance only we knew.
The doors opened to reveal Ginerva Weasley, looking beautiful in her white dress. I stand next to Weasley, my suit feeling perfectly tight, perhaps I'll find a shag at the reception.
Hell, I didn't know. That was the point, of course, I hadn't known with James either. We didn't have a gender reveal for James. Somehow, I'd known.
When we pulled away, the three red-heads were pointing their wands in the air, chanting a spell under their breath.
"That's enough!" I blinked as Harry jumped off the couch. His magic crackled around us. I glanced worriedly at Hermione, who sent a glance right back at me.
"Me too," Harry pants, thrusting harder, causing Draco to arch his back. Harry begins pumping Draco faster, making the blond come first with a moan of Harry's name. Harry follows soon after with one harsh thrust and he fills Draco with his come.
He got up from the red, soft chair he was sitting in and picked up the paper, tucking it into the pocket of his jacket, walking out of Gryffindor Common Room, and towards the Astronomy Tower.
"How far along are you?" Hermione said, sinking down beside me and giving me a huge smile. I remembered the same talk when I was carrying James.
"Aunt 'Mione!" Hermione coos and hands Rose to her husband, pulling James into her arms with a sloppy kiss to his cheek, making the toddler giggle.
James in arms, Teddy clinging onto my leg, my mouth fell open. Harry held his head in his hands. An overwhelming sense of possessiveness came over me when I realized he was still in his pajamas, even more so after remembering his pajamas consisted of only trackies.
"I'm not trying to poison you, you know?" I snapped. I threw a glance at her still untouched cup of tea.
The crease in Weaslette's shoes as she lifted herself onto her tip-toes, the puckering of her ugly pink lips, the widening of green-eyes, Harry trying to lean away.
"Do you also remember not using a condom..?" Draco had tears falling now, looking down at his lap, his long hair shielding his face from Harry.
Ok that's it I'm going on actual hiatus now LMAO. I said I was going to go on hiatus two days ago now here we are ASFHASHFBLKF.
It was simply because I was part of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. Absolutely and entirely Pureblood. The fact that I had Veela genes in me as well simply supported my pregnancy. It wasn't the first case of male pregnancy in the Wizarding World and I was sure it wouldn't be the last.
"Harry?" I turned and called into the house. He was by my side in an instant, wrapping an arm around my waist and looking at our unexpected guest.
"Yes," With a flick of my hand, we're both naked and I switch our positions, flipping him onto his back on the bed.
"Mr. Potter, I think it's time for the baby," The Healer, Healer Marshell, said, walking into my room. I shook my head violently.
Hermione and Pansy walked up next, Hermione's face flooded with tears. She just cried. Pansy had silent tears running down her face as she left Hermione away.
"Draaacooo," Harry moaned from the bed. I snorted, sticking my head out from where I was getting dressed.
"I love you," I sobbed, pressing a kiss against his, now tear-soaked, neck. He simply tightened his arms around me and I inhaled deeply. Inhaled the scent that was so uniquely
Harry came down a few moments later, Lyra, now six, with her legs around his waist and her arms around his neck. She was smiling, big and wide at me and I smiled back at her.
I look down and Scorpius is staring up at me with those big green eyes. He holds his arms up for me to pick him up. Ignoring whatever the judge hisses at me, I pick him up, balancing him on my hip like I've done so many times before.
Maisie had silver eyes and dark black hair. Jonah looked almost identical to Harry, green eyes, and black hair, although, that had been a choice. Jonah was born a metamorphagus and he and teddy would constantly bother their sisters with their powers, once tricking Laura into thinking that Maisie had somehow fallen off of Laura's tall wardrobe when, in reality, it was Jonah, crumpled up to look like he had broken a bone or two.
When we arrived home, I used wandless magic to unlock the door and instantly grimaced at the sound of arguing.
Handing the frog to Laura, who obliged happily, he tore into the second one, this time giving the frog to Jonah.
Usually, the view of The Burrow just beyond the horizon from the apparation point would make me calm down because
to. This, after all, was Potter’s home, which he had graciously taken Draco into instead of sending to Azkaban- which Draco still hadn’t mustered the courage to ask
“No need to speak, save your voice as I won’t be here long. I just wanted to introduce myself while I was here today before we meet in a few days. I’m your mind healer,” though her voice was soothing, it did nothing to calm Draco’s heart from racing.
The sounds were definitely coming from the kitchen, and Draco made sure to stay well behind Potter who never lowered his wand, knowing that if there really was any danger, he had no way of defending himself. The kitchen was a massacre, pots and pans laying in various degrees of unrest, stacks of plates and glass cups missing from their places in the cupboards laying in shards around the room.
The ride up to the Minister’s office level was short, as magical lifts needn’t take much time to move within wizarding space. Draco was being led from the lift to the giant mahogany double doors that sealed off the entire end of a hallway. Two quick raps of the knuckle by Officer Otters, and an equally quick
Kreacher informs Draco on the fourth morning in bed that he will be seeing Dr. Inkwood that afternoon. So Draco accepts Kreacher’s help, along with Fissy, in getting him into better looking shape. They dress him in dark slacks and a nice button up shirt. He was in desperate need of a shave. Looking like a caveman isn’t how he wants his first mind healer appointment to go. He wants to make a good impression on this doctor and hopefully she will see what a big farce it is that she was even owled into the situation.
Showing love and affection had always been difficult for both Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy. Both had been raised in less than adequate circumstances; Harry being raised by abusive family members that despised him for existing, and Draco raised to hate all those below his own blood status and being forced to become a Death Eater. Suffice to say that when they first started dating, it was painful to learn to love and to figure out what each other’s love language was. But they made it through dating for two years before Draco decided he was tired of calling Harry his ‘boyfriend’ and thought that ‘husband’ had a better ring to it.
Potter was the one to break the silence, rubbing his hand on the back of his neck nervously. “So do you have any belongings or anything?” He asked.
Draco had wondered just how long Clementine planned on sticking around, feeling like he had been violated enough when he saw the Quick-Quotes Quill come out to record his words. Brief flashbacks of Rita Skeeter entering his brain, causing chills to run down his back as he remembered how many times the woman had printed vile articles about him and his family, though some were deserving. Clementine had assured him that this wasn’t the type of note recording that ended up in the prophet, that this was purely clinical in nature, so he was able to calm himself again.
Their anniversary fell on a Friday this year, and Draco had begged and pleaded with Harry to take a sick day from the Ministry without exceptions this time around. Harry agreed because he still felt bad about their trip falling through last year; they had given the America trip last minute to Andromeda and Teddy. Teddy was starting to get to the age where he was able to retain major life events and Draco had non-refundable deposits on most of their trip. There was no sense in wasting the trip, so Draco owled his aunt Andromeda and told her the situation, stating that Harry would want Teddy to experience America. She agreed and once Harry found out, he cried because of how generous Draco was to his godson Teddy.
back into the room to check if anybody would like to stay for dinner. Draco hummed, taken aback by the idea of being accepted into Potter’s social circle. Were they really doing this out of the kindness or their hearts?
“Issa here to serve Master Malfoy. Master Lucius Malfoy is no longers Master of Malfoy Manor,” Fissy explained, hiccupping between words. “Mistress Narcissa Malfoy says she is no longers needing so many house elves, she has freed most of us.”
“You’re fighting it,” Granger commented one day while Draco made tea in the kitchen. She hadn’t found much information the past consecutive days. She had been watching him closer day by day, though. That’s how Draco found himself cornered in the room with her.
Of course he was being sent to Azkaban. There was never a doubt in his mind that he wouldn’t be sent to rot in the most desolate place imaginable. The only time Draco ever let himself get his hopes up for anything different was when he was in this exact room, two weeks ago, being told he would be released to the Manor for house arrest. And now those hopes were being chewed up and spat out, all thanks to his loving father.
“No one has even noticed that I’ve been coming here. I don’t know what kind of life you think I lead, but nowadays I only go into the wizarding world for work, and spend most of my time alone,” Harry points out defensively. “And I can’t help that you and I were headed in the same direction that night! Merlin, to think I was hoping we could be friends.”
Harry is startled by not just the harsh language but the fear in Malfoy’s eyes. “But...but what if she didn’t tell your father? I’m sure she’d be willing to keep things a secret just to see you,” he says softly, wanting to calm him down a bit.
"Hey, are we still on for tonight? The monkshood shipment just came in and honestly it's been better since you've started brewing for us," Luke asks, looking at Aby from across the room.
"I'm certain I will. Still have plenty of room and I'm the shops test subject," he muses, knowing that Jane loved his willingness to let her trying new techniques on him. “But enough about me. Shirt off. I'll need to remove the hair in whatever area you want the snitch to rest, however fine. Is that alright?"
As Aby stepped outside he saw Potter against the wall snogging the blonde he’d been chatting up. Not wanting to interrupt, he ducked into an alley to pull out the weed cigarettes he smoked now and again. He knew it was a horrible habit but he only indulged every so often. He from where he was standing he heard a goodbye and the close of a car door, and thought nothing of it until he heard footsteps coming down the way.
Aby had to think for a moment to mentally count them. "I think I'm up to fifteen at this point. Some small. Some large," he shrugs, finishing his small sandwich with a final bite.
Aby’s eyes widen in fear. "No. I would hate to put my mother through the death of her son twice. Because make no mistake Potter. Lucius will murder me because he'd rather go to Azkaban than live with having a faggot of a son and letting him walk about."
Harry spent the next few days trying to resist the urge to go by the shop, or find a way to run into Malfoy, not wanting to appear too eager. But luckily, Malfoy’s owl arrived before Harry’s patience ran out and got the best of him. The letter was short and simply, asking Harry if he wanted to go out that weekend, no more detail than that. But with a quick answer of yes, Harry was looking forward to the end of the week.
"That's one of my favorite pieces. Only one done so far as a friend of the shop let me experiment on him for it. Unfortunately a piece like takes at least three sessions so if you want it, we'll have to book more times."
Harry had almost fallen asleep as Malfoy worked on him, smiling to himself whenever he could hear the blonde singing to himself. He basks in the contentment of the ongoing moment, and is brought to when Malfoy declares himself done for the night.
Abraxas wanders with his head low down Horizont Alley. It was far too early and far too cold for the floo at work to not be open, but he needs to open up the shop today. At least he could get a coffee out of Luke or Michael if he guilts them about the shut floo, he thinks as he opens the door to Magus Atramento, one of wizarding London’s three tattoo parlours.
“It wasn’t a problem. I genuinely enjoyed working on your piece. If you ever need more art or a recommendation for a muggle artist feel free to come back to the shop,” Aby offers, as he begins to clean up his station.
“What are you doing tonight?” he asks, turning away to not focus on his arm and the blood coming out in tiny droplets from there.
"That she is. I'm glad she's going out and not staying cooped up in the manor," he sighs, needing to end this conversation now before he begins to cry. "I need to go home Potter. I hope you have a good weekend and I'll see you in a week to finish your tattoo,” he murmurs, picking up his pace to head home.
Aby stops in his tracks. "You know that isn't just information you tell people casually. Perhaps under the influence of drugs or alcohol, but not simply as if it's a fun fact Potter. Merlin I swear this explains so many things," he mutters, trying to wrap his mind around this.
Harry turns to see his arm in the mirror. “I like it Malfoy. It already looks good. Are you going to do them with colored ink?,” he asks curiously.
Luck was not on his side that day it seems, because as Potter turns to respond, his eyes widen in recognition. “Mal-Malfoy? Draco Malfoy?,” he sputters, staring at Aby in astonishment.
"It's not pathetic it's just something you have to work on so come on," he gestures and opens the door back to the living room. There they found Jane and Luke, who were pleased to see that neither was dead. "Potter will be staying for dinner and will probably be around more because well, he needs a life beyond auroring and we're a lively bunch aren't we?"
Clearing his throat he continues, hopeful that the man might not recognize him after so many years. “Apologies, appointment or walk-in?" he finishes.
"No I don't," he lies, leveling a look at his friend. Jane glares at him with a look that says ‘I know you’re lying,’ causing Aby to huff.
“Well I switch, and have sex with men and women” Harry answers. “What charms would you recommend for that? And can you do multiple charms?”
"The max of three charms can be used for these piercings right now. Now come and strip down to your boxers for me love, don’t be shy," Jane insists, grinning at Harry.
"Thank you Potter but I assure you that's just the booze talking," he murmurs as he fall into a state of half slumber until their stop comes up.
"Permanent cushioning charms do wonders to a rather inexpensive mattress," he chuckles, and without hesitation slides an arm around Potter.
Sorry for the delay in posting. I spent the last few weeks editing the whole story to change the verb tense, fix a lot of typos, and generally clean it up. I'm not working with a beta so I have to look it over more than a few times to actually like it.
"Potter general etiquette dictates that if you see a bloke at a gay bar that doesn't come up and say at least hello but instead gives a tight lipped smile after a look of panic, that most likely he'd like to remain under the radar. Just wanted to give you space." He half lies, knowing the other half is that he doesn’t want to see him more than he needs to. "I do hope though you don't arrest me for this though auror," he adds, holding up his cigarette.
Aby was certain he mishears Potter and just goes about gathering what he needs. "It seems I have this same slot next week free, and then I’m booked for two weeks after that. So within a month you'll be all done if that's alright? I can have someone else do movement if you wish to do it one day after the other."
“I’m not trying to screw you over...I just want to help. I thought it would be different after the war but it’s the same system in most ways, just different people being screwed over,” he deflates. “I’m just trying to not be their pawn this time around and use it to my advantage. That includes, helping people like your mother. I owe that to her. Believe me, I’m not here to screw anyone over,” he repeats. “And honestly,” he smirks, “I wouldn’t have even tried to insert myself into your life again, Aby, if you weren’t so good at what you do,” he finishes, knowing it’s only half the truth, and testing out his name for the first time.
“You’re right and I kind of hate that. I don’t have much of a life outside of work anymore. It’s kind of pathetic when you think about it,” he says finally with a deep sigh immediately following.
“Hi I’m Harry,” he Auror greets, recognizing the large man from his initial booking. Luke looks at the proffered hand and frowns. “I’ll leave you to it Aby,” he grunts, and turns to walk out.
Harry blinks his eyes a little while later when he feels the tap. He sits up a bit, and feeling the stiffness in his arm, but also feeling the undercurrent of magic. Standing up, he looks in the mirror, his mouth falling open.
“Really? Well it’s lovely and it’s a brilliant way to memorialize him,” Harry remarks softly, leaning down a bit closer so that he can see it better. “Does it do anything special?,” he inquires.
"Well that was fruitless. I guess I should have told you that when you flirt, focus on the right man."
"How about this?” Aby begins to offer, “come around some time, stay for dinner, get to know me properly, and I'll take to a sex shop and get you something fun."
"Yes. That is certainly one way to put it," he murmurs, wiping away a bit of blood before moving on.
“Uh, no, just Severus would cast his patronus at night around my bed to let me sleep while I was in the manor. He usually stayed in my rooms when he was visiting. That’s the only time I’ve really seen one up close.”
“Aby is just finish up back and will be out soon," she offers, watching Harry pace the room a little.
Stopping when Malfoy turns on his heels to face him, he watches as the blonde goes from ready for a fight to subdued in a mere moment. “It’s simple. Some people don't want to have a former death eater doing their work, the same way they have issues with us having a werewolf on staff. Now did you eat before coming?" he tacks on, turning around again to keep walking to his station.
“Well do I need to take you to bed now to make up for it?,” Harry asks with a cheeky grin, his eyes following Malfoy around the room despite talking to Luke.
"And even if you did help with that, I suggest you keep your eyes to yourself,” he warns with a small growl before Malfoy comes back with the boxes.
"The liquid in the bottle occasionally swirls but nothing more. I wanted it simple for him. I know he was an arse to you but he was my tutor and my confidant until he died. First person I came out to actually."
“Yeah, that’s all that happened. And I was just on my way home,” Harry promises, as he easily catches the hangover potion.
“I always have time for my friends,” Harry assures, and leads Malfoy out of the shop door, and towards the back streets of Magical London that merged with the muggle world.
Playfully swatting at Malfoy, he nods. “Fine. I’ll see myself home and maybe even contemplate a proper mean. I’ll see you soon, have a good night, both of you.”
Harry followed Aby to his room, and when the blonde opened his door, Harry wasn’t sure what he was expecting to see. It was certainly not the decor of the Malfoy he used to know. Inside was a modest bed and dresser, with the only personal items being Malfoy’s record collection and a stack of what looked to be second hand muggle books.
“I understand. We all had to do things that we didn’t necessarily want to do during the war,” he mutters, knowing his own roll was thrust upon him without choice. “I’m really glad to know that you’ve grown though, Malfoy,” he adds hoping he isn’t bothering the blonde by getting a little soft.
Aby is sitting in front of the floo when Harry arrives, sitting cross-legged in worn jeans and a baggy teal sweatshirt with a tank peaking underneath, as he reads a book. "Well look at you. Didn't think I've seen you so casual. You look almost passably not like a professional narc," he muses, his eyes roaming over the auror.
“Oh no, no. I wouldn’t know what I was doing in there. I wouldn’t know what I was looking for,” he stammers nervously.
“Why are you so insistent on getting rid of me?,” Harry asks, frowning at him. “Is it because I’m an auror? Part of your past? A speccy git? What!?” he exclaims, his voice rising. “I’m sorry for what I said the other night but you make me feel like I’m an inconvenience,” he tells him honestly, remembering that feeling from childhood.
“Malfoy?” Potter got the man’s attention again. “Are you okay?” he asked, much more stern this time, demanding a response.
Draco almost couldn’t recognize himself in the reflection. He looked like a ghost; pale and spooked. Splashing some water onto his face felt like ice on his flushed skin, only momentarily soothing the burning skin.
“Wines, whiskeys, beers, you name it,” Potter smiled. “Seamus is bringing loads of different types of drink, says he owes me for his life and alcohol is apparently how he aims to show his thanks,” Draco laughed at that, surprising himself and Potter at the sudden bark that escaped him.
And yet, the aforementioned was here. Sitting on the side of Draco’s bed (well, really the bed belongs to Potter, but Draco had used it for the last month so he’s taken to calling it his), looking down, hands still on Draco’s shoulders. His hands, somehow, made Draco feel even hotter. If his skin was fire, Potter’s hands were molten lava comparatively.
Potter eventually gave the okay to release Fissy from her bindings. Kreacher begrudgingly did as he was told. Once freed from the ropes, Fissy immediately apparated across the room to stand in front of Draco with a quiet
“I’ll never get used to hearing those delicious noises,” Harry mumbled into Draco’s upper thigh. “Think I’ll be down here a while so I can get more of your sounds.” That elicited another loud moan. Draco loved when Harry talked to him like this, his voice getting deeper and sexier than normal. Draco felt like puddy under Harry’s wandering hands and wet mouth.
After the play, Draco apparates them both to an upscale Italian diner for an early dinner, the play having gone longer than planned. Draco doesn’t normally enjoy plates full of carbs, but he knows that Harry’s favorite food group is pasta, whether he admits it or not. So Draco orders them a nice wine, not even caring to ask for the price as anything goes for his husband today. Who is he kidding, if Harry asked for the most expensive wine in the world with a fast food dinner, Draco would willingly do it.
Draco thought. “She seems to be the only tangible connection you have to your life before- well, before you came here.”
“Do you think, perhaps, he has chosen to live his life the way he has? He could have given up so early on, or at any point in time and yet he didn’t. Does that not say something about choosing your own fate?” Clementine stopped walking, holding Draco’s shoulders at arms length to look him in the eyes. “Your past life and actions do not define who you are, Draco. What you chose to do, and be, in life defines who you are. If you believe that you are evil, then you are choosing that. But what if you didn’t, what if instead you chose to defy what has been decided for you?”
Draco mentally cheers, admiring the way he can move his extremities again without pain ripping through his body. He’s especially thankful that he no longer has any spasms that had contorted his body so uncomfortably.
Draco makes it two days after his talk with Granger without incident. On the third day, Draco’s body is shutting down.
, Draco thought. A tray holding six cups of tea with all the fixings and a plate of tarts on the side was placed upon the table between everyone, Kreacher having made one for Draco even after he refused. He wondered if Kreacher had heard Potter ask Draco to stay, or if the house elf took it upon himself anyway.
“Intruder!” Kreacher bellowed, “Masters Potter and Black must tell Kreacher whats they wants him to do with the intruder.”
“Well, I suppose if I can’t have that, then fetch me some towels, and run me a cool bath,” Draco requested, his breath finally becoming normal again. Adding on a small, “please,” quietly, but loud enough to get a giant toothy smile, clearly pleased that he was given something to do to serve Draco. The house elf snapped twice, the faucet in the large clawfoot tub came roaring to life, and a stack of fluffy white towels appeared on the counter in front of Draco.
He’s about to drift into a dream when suddenly the sound of knuckles rapping on the door in quick succession echo through the room. “Good morning, Draco!” a cheery black haired lady chimes loudly, as she walks in from the hallway. Her voice split into Draco’s head, and slightly startled the man, causing a groan to escape him.
Draco sits through all five acts without complaining, knowing that Harry had enjoyed the play and not wanting to ruin his mood. It isn’t very often that Draco gets to have Harry so carefree and happy all to himself, so he puts on his ‘good husband’ persona and suffers through the trainwreck of tragedy in silence. And if he tears up a bit when both Romeo and Juliet die, well then that’s nobody’s business but his own.
“Is Master Malfoy requirings anything else?” Kreacher asked, looking hopeful up at Draco from his short stature. “Master Potter requests tea ands a sandwich after he has his night terrors,” Kreacher tells the taller man.
“Master Black is not to be knowings this, Kreacher has made a mistake in sayings that. Kreacher deserves to be punished,” the house elf was properly freaking out now, thinking of the punishments he usually sustained from Draco’s ancestors.
“No need, she’s the reason I’m doing this. I want to start over with you. I remember how much of an arse I was that first day at Hogwarts, and more so after that of course. But it was the worst first impression I could have given you, and obviously it led to everything we’ve been through over the years,” Draco rambled on. “I want to introduce myself as the Draco Malfoy that I want to be, not that pompous, cocky eleven-year-old Draco Malfoy that was being spoon-fed lies about everything. So,” Draco said and held out a hand to shake. “Hi, I’m Draco Malfoy, I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my life that I’m not proud of, but I have a lot to offer. I would love to be friends with the one and only Harry Potter, if he’ll have me.”
A week had passed since Draco’s episode that involved Potter and Kreacher. He had mentally celebrated being one entire month closer to his release from house arrest, but the commemoration only gave him brief happiness. He was still stuck here for years to come. His celebration was also short-lived due to the increase in visits Potter had been getting from the remainder of the Golden Trio.
