“Yeah,” Harry said. Draco dropped his hands to his sides.
The first Sunday lunch that weekend with Hermione and Ron, he told them in halting words about what had happened. True to Kingsley’s word, most people thought he was on assignment.
“Do you regret us?” The question pops out of Harry’s mouth before he can even register it. Even Draco seems a bit shocked by it, mouth a little open before he shakes his head as if to clear his thoughts.
Reciting the facts, as terrible as they were, reassured him. Dragonpox was only supposed to be dangerous to children and the elderly. You could add extra willow bark to a standard pain potion on the early stages, Draco thought. But it must have been too late to suppress the fever. He would have hallucinated before his organs failed one by one.
Harry looked down and he was dressed in shiny black boots and a deep crimson waistcoat with shiny gold military buttons. His clothes seemed well made but Draco dressed much more simply in an array of greys.
“Your father will be the death of me,” she said fondly. “Upstairs in his books again because he thinks he’s found a new alchemical compound. I’ll be lucky to see him for a fortnight. At least my work stops at 5.”
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione said. She didn’t argue with him.
At best, in the Healer program Draco had a few people who tolerated sitting next to him during breaks at St Mungo’s and occasionally borrowed his notes. So he had resorted to consulting Pansy and Theo over Chinese takeaway at Theo’s flat.
“Maybe if we had both survived the first War but...it was never like that. We were too young. She was like family,” Kingsley said.
“I know but I do have to go back home to study,” Draco admitted. He looked as put out as Harry felt.
"If I understand this would also reduce secondary infections?" Harry interjected when he was done. His expression was so attentive. Draco was aware he practiced most of his speeches on Harry but he never expected Harry to read academic Healer journals.
Of course floos worked both ways, but when did Harry ever come looking for him in the Manor? Lady of the fucking Lake, his face hurt. He would never be annoyed with anyone who came into A&E complaining about something being broken ever again. He could taste the coppery brightness of his own blood down the back of his throat.
“Bill won’t be pleased and we’re already behind schedule,” Draco said.
They are at St Mungo's yet again, with another Healer. Healer Smythe is competent, but with the bedside manner of a frozen turnip.
"So what then? You just switch partners and don't speak to me for three
Despite all this, nothing else ever came close to the way it felt to kiss Draco Malfoy.
“Thank you, Draco,” Harry said, sincere. Something twisted up in Draco’s face.
Harry nodded. He didn’t trust himself to speak.
“He will be, okay? We’re running tests about what kind of magical damage Draco might have done and on what happened to his magic. Any other details, he will tell you himself if he wants to.”
“I’m not built for manual labour. Why can’t you use a spell?” Draco complained.
“Hermione said to bring Rosie in because it’s getting warm out,” Harry explained.
The wards must have accepted him, because with a loud crack, Draco apparated mid-stride.
“Good,” Harry said.
“It’s not even real. It looks ridiculous,” Theo said, but he allowed Pansy to lead him, too.
She insisted on dancing to the wireless pop station, so she led him in a waltz, then a salsa.
“Brief me,” Harry said.
“What about the Ministry?” Draco leaned into the touches even as he continued to deploy an under-used and ill-sharpened defensiveness.
“You’ve never met Fleur and Maddy isn’t here,” Harry told him. Draco’s eyes widened a touch and then his face shuttered.
“I think we are,” Draco said.
"Yes, I've met your parents," Harry said dryly, and they both caught each other's eye and cracked a smile.
Melinda assigned him writing exercises. She talked a lot about trauma.
"Draco, introduce me."
“Harry, broom ride?” Teddy asked for the fiftieth time this visit. Teddy’s hands were sticky with juice and one hand was patting Harry’s face in what Harry was sure was meant to be an affectionate gesture. Disgusting but cute.
Fortunately for Harry, Hermione came back.
The team all groaned even the Captain who liked being on the team to burn off excess energy. But they did the floor-work with the determination to do it right and get out of there. Out of a sense of fairness, Harry got down in the mud and crawled along with them. He could use the exercise.
“Where’s Angelina?” Harry said to George.
Face messy with saliva and jaw sore, Harry had sat Draco on the stairs, summoned lube, and fucked himself on his fingers while Draco watched. Harry stopped every time Draco reached forward, until he understood. Harry had waited for a bed for the rest though. Put Draco on his back and waited until Draco had been about to say something before he sank onto him.
“There’s a stray rune,” Harry said breathlessly. The rune was wedged near where the middle of the floor had been and still glowing green.
“Nothing like that. There’s a very decentralized structure. Small cells carrying out particular operations. But I’m worried about the intelligence we’ve been receiving. Someone is moving a lot of Galleons to fund this. We thought the recent arrests with Dark objects were one-off incidents, but if they are connected, it’s about to get much worse,” Kingsley said.
Penelope was dressed in a pink maxi dress and ankle boots. She had piled all her long blonde curls in a bun on her head.  Athena wore dark jeans and a long sleeve white t-shirt. Kingsley was dressed in a black Adidas tracksuit.
Draco has some defenses. Harry has none. In Auror training when everyone picked a specialty course, Harry had said tersely ‘none of that' to Draco and avoided Legilimency altogether. Draco went to defensive mind magic; Harry had done a course in advanced weaponry.
“You live with a Healer.” Draco scoffed. “Did you eat there? Drink any water lately?”
“You know the standard Time Turner rules, and I already told you not to get killed,” Hermione said. Sometimes Harry hated the wry sense of humour she’d developed coping with her job. He raised an eyebrow. She grabbed her Firebird back.
Harry coughed.
“Sorry about that. Just busy,” Harry said. Hermione made a little disbelieving sound.
“What’s the matter with you?” Harry shot back. “You’re the one who asked for this.”
Harry rewarded him with a kiss on the cheek. Harry buried his face in his neck and sniffed deeply. Draco was going to complain about what a base, horrid thing it was to do, but unfortunately his body hadn’t got the memo and was responding in a way Harry would be well aware of.
They were getting closer and closer together.
“Do you want to have a quick drink?” Harry says, instead of the goodbye that had been on the tip of his tongue.
“How was it?” Harry asks. He stands at the stove stirring a stew. Something tomatoey from the smell of it. Usually as soon as he was through the door of their Linden Garden flat, Harry would be all over him.
Well, Draco certainly hoped so. After they slammed the door, Draco decided no matter what, he needed to get out of there. There was a dull ache in his chest and the little wandless magic he could manage wouldn’t come to him anymore.The pain in his wrists was duller than what he’d recently experienced, so he slowly started to pull at the ropes.
"To remember. Why are all of yours gone?" Harry asked.
“How good to see you,” Harry opted for instead.
Having his birthday party at their place was a terrible idea. Draco should have made his excuses and begged to go to a nice restaurant. For one thing, Healers as a group tended to drink too much on nights off. For another, this party also brought the Slytherins around. They declared this his whiskey birthday.
Whatever she is, she has taken the form of a elderly woman but something is off about her eyes. They glitter too brightly. She moves too quickly. She feels like too much magic is contained in her body.
“This is my new friend, Harry,” Valerie says, cheerfully. “Maybe you know each other?”
“Is that all?” Harry pushed. He wanted to know why. Why was it that every universe had drawn them together in one way or another? This was the second universe where Draco had been on the right side. He had all the makings of a spy, so maybe it was wish fulfillment.
“You’ll be the best man at my wedding?” Theo asked. He was wringing his hands as if Draco would say no.
“The time is almost equivalent, give or take a few milliseconds. No matter how many times you jump, you would have three months,” Hermione said. “Tomorrow come in for a test run, then you can start.”
“Really? Like what?” Draco said. He stood, tapping his foot impatiently as if he knew Harry was bullshitting.
“What are you waiting for? Dinner and a show? Hurry up, Malfoy,” Harry said.
Draco lowered his wand. Harry scrambled for a question of his own.
goes unspoken but Harry feels it in Draco’s heated sigh, the shivering of his body, the warmth of his breath when they stop kissing but still have things to share.
Draco felt like a naïve child. Part of him had believed that it would be as simple as going away for a little bit and everything would be fine when he returned. He was bitterly aware of the irony of being upset that someone had been unfair to him because of who he was.
fail your psychological profile in your yearly review as it stands. I believe in your ability to do this job, but you will not endanger yourself under my watch. You are not well. We can agree or we can disagree, but you will walk out of here without your badge today either way,” Kingsley said.
He called because he’d looked at Draco Malfoy in a Muggle bookshop and realized for the first time that there were questions about himself that he could not answer. What were the odds of their meeting? What did it mean? Why did it feel like Harry had stayed the same and Draco changed? Why did everyone seem to change but Harry?
“Alright?” Harry asked when he caught his breath.
“Dance and then we’ll leave?” Hermione said.
The last thing he remembers really well is the pattern of grey tile in Draco's sitting room. He has never been here before and he’s surprised it looks so minimalist. The palette is muted, Draco has just one stiff backed couch for two, and everything is neat but dusty. Draco manoeuvres him against a wall. Harry wants to ask if they can at least do this in a bedroom.
"Sorry. I should have warned you before—" Draco began.
“You are our only hope of this hell being over. I’m tired of this.” Draco said.
“Of course, Mr. Potter. Your assistant said...” she trailed off, looking at Draco and Hermione.
“Head Healer Forsyth Cummins, sir,” she responded.
“No,” Draco said carefully. Greg smiled. It seemed sinister somehow. The Goyles had hidden their assets better than the Malfoys; only his father went to Azkaban for ten years. Greg had paid some token amount of reparation money and never been on probation. He was uncomfortably aware that they had switched social positions.
“Sorry, is there any way to change the setting?” Harry finally asked halfway through his third session. Healer Blishwick smiled.
Harry climbed the stairs to the bedroom and thought he might have to go wandering in Diagon before he spotted a bound notebook. He flipped it open. It was a copy of the calendar but on Harry’s weeks there were at least two times marked ‘Draco Malfoy Greengrass - Nero, Diagon’. He flipped back. Same place for two years.
“A few of us in the Sacred Twenty-Eight have formed a small social club. Wine Wednesdays, some trading, if you’re interested,” Greg said.
Zacharias was also wearing a highlighter yellow long sleeve shirt that said “COOL” in red letters, dress shoes and khaki shorts which would draw attention from any Muggle. Had Zacharias failed Stealth? He should have, the bastard.
Draco smiles back and taps his coaster on the table. All at once Harry can see Draco at eighteen with the Draco now superimposed over him. Draco in dress robes, sneering, back rigid. Draco who sits languid in the booth, smiling in a way he never would have let himself before.
Harry and Draco’s friendship began as a careful thing, played out in neutral territory over years. It was a relationship constrained to a casual nod in Diagon Alley, a polite inquiry in passing at Andromeda’s, and a detente at the explosion of engagements, birthdays, weddings, store openings, baby showers, semesters abroad, and welcome back dinners. And though Harry had grown up expecting his social life to be carefully limited to the small circle of friends at Hogwarts, he was pleasantly surprised by how widely he could share that joy now.
“Salazar. That’s enough for today. Let’s head back to camp.”
For now, this was enough.
“I love you, Mum,” Harry said. This was the only time he would ever get to say it. “Tell Dad I love him too.”
Draco flushed.
being nice to me,” Pansy wails, muffled by Draco’s shoulder.
“I want your family to like me,” Draco said quietly.
“Guilty.”
Andromeda was not around to hear this plea, strategically, Harry thought. Teddy would deliberately shift to look more like him during these conversations, which he found very confusing emotionally. A black haired, golden skinned, green eyed boy looked back at him. Teddy didn’t have his nose or mouth right, but an impression was enough.
In the end, these were the things that ruined every adult relationship he had. They said they understood, but inevitably, it hurt their feelings. Being an Auror had made it worse. And then he chose to be alone. He stopped trying.
It was near midnight in the late summer when the time came. A Ministry bell clanged in their living room loudly enough to wake them both in bed. Harry wasn’t in the habit of questioning Draco about his work at all, but as he watched Draco pick up various things around their shared house, he could feel sharp twinges of anxiety in his chest.
“Personally, I don’t think that’s the case at all. Reports say that he had been struggling in his personal life, but he kept to himself at work. This seems like it had more to do with him than the work,” Kingsley admitted.
“You knew her as a kid then,” Harry asked.
“Why did you agree to join this operation, then?” Harry had to strain to hear Kingsley’s words.
“I don’t think I have to take leave. I can do whatever it is you need from me while I’m here,” Harry protested.
He needed something to do besides returning to Healer Blishwick twice a week.
He gave Harry a look like he thought Harry might be tempted to take a sip from one of his cauldrons to disprove this theory.
“The birthday boy is fine. Potter, catch up,” Blaise said. He lined up three shots of whiskey. There was that famous Gryffindor courage, because Harry winked at him and took all three in a row. Blaise clapped him on the back and leaned in to tell Harry something.
“I didn’t know if you wanted me to,” Harry said in a hushed voice.
To make it worse, Head Auror Kingsley Shacklebolt had summoned Harry to his office the following Monday. Harry was presented with a letter that approved his non-existent request for paid administrative leave.
“We’ll have time for blood traitors when we’re done with the mudbloods,” the second one said. Draco tried to catch his eye, but he looked away.
“I dream of it most nights,” Draco answered, opting to look out her office’s window. Trees mostly blocked the view. He watched the branches of the closest linden tree scratch the panes.
"I have to take care of something," Harry said. His voice was lower than usual, still sleep rough.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, please, please.” Draco heard someone plead faintly and then realized it was him.
Draco tried to think. There had been a faint red bubble dome covering the property.
“If she actually takes after Dorcas, it’ll be a cold day in hell first,” Kingsley said. He laughed a little but it was tinged with sadness.
“Have you ever known me to bake?” Pansy answered archly. Theo and Draco looked at each other knowingly and drank from their flutes rather than challenge that suspiciously non-specific denial.
“No, ma’am,” Harry said.
“I’ve got one last book for you.” Draco accepted it. And when Eustace gave him a brief hug, he accepted that too.
“Will he ever marry? He could have anyone he wanted.”
He spoke to the parents, but he couldn’t help notice them.
"Hello," Harry says coolly.
“I won’t take you in, okay? Return with me, once. I’ll give you one of the Firebirds now. I just want to talk as ourselves,” Harry said.
“Trainee Forrester, please apologize to Trainee Malfoy.” That took the wind out of his sails. He couldn’t help but shoot a puzzled glance at Healer Cummins. Trainee Forrester looked furious.
It hadn’t really been a surprise that they ended up in Blaise’s hotel room. They had got some looks for kissing in the hotel lobby and lingering a bit. He could imagine how it looked, with Blaise dressed in a bespoke charcoal suit and Draco, following, wearing a bargain bin black polo and thrifted black jeans. It felt thrilling. No one knew him.
“That’s fucking bullshit,” Ron said. Harry shrugged.
“I think people stopped using foundling about a century ago,” Theo said, helpfully.
"There has to be a better system than coming to these things and begging people for research funding," Harry said in a low voice as they entered the main ballroom.
“You know I can’t hold babies,” Harry said.
“And I’m Albus fucking Dumbledore,” Ron said. “If you know each other so well, he must know you’re not really into half-measures.”
“Similar mechanics though,” Harry said. His workshop reminded him of Molly’s kitchen during a holiday meal, the more he looked. But presumably, it was always like this.
“You can find a Cursebreaker apprenticeship wherever you’d like. I cannot. Save us both trouble and go back to camp before you ruin my prospects,” Draco said. Curiously, this sounded like a conversation they had had dozens of times.
When Kingsley invited Harry to dinner with his wife Patience about nine months into his leave by Owl, Harry figured it would be good to show he was doing better.
“Relax, Potter. My hypothetical spouse is safe from his attentions. The Potionmaster General’s wife in Aqui-Sext, however...” Draco trailed off. “Well, I suspect Desjardins passed because the man didn’t want to see him ever again if he failed.”
Draco cleared his throat and focused on the hem of her purple robes to stop the bile in the back of his throat from washing into his mouth.
Her deep brown skin gleamed and her hair was always in some elaborate confection of long twists. She was as tall as Kingsley, as loud as Kingsley, and needled her husband relentlessly while he cooked.
Draco cut him off with a kiss which was okay because Harry didn't know where his sentence was going. He wanted anything Draco had to offer even if Draco was only here to kiss him until he couldn't see straight. He just wanted.
“I think I can make it so you’ll be okay. They want to keep this quiet. You’re safe,” Harry whispered.
“But what do you mean? Where did he go?” Harry insisted. Hermione hesitated.
“It’s allowed in an emergency. It just makes my feelings very...confusing,” Draco said, half to himself. Draco took off the glasses and dropped them on the table. He rubbed his temples, then walked towards the living room. Harry followed, as if they were not in his house.
“You’re a horrid woman,” Draco said without much heat.
“Tracey Davis, as I live and breathe,” Draco said sarcastically. He knew he could identify her if she spoke for long enough. Seemingly remembering this was a hostage situation, she vanished the rest of his meal and hexed his mouth shut before forcing the hood back over his head.
“I have some questions about the irrigation systems you’ve employed in the southern fields if you’ve got a moment.”
Draco moved from Harry’s side and started looking at some shelves behind the cash register. Harry followed, trying to be careful not to get water on the books. It was a tidy and small but packed bookshop. It looked so mundane that he almost wanted to check again that this was the Draco Malfoy he knew.
“Ten minutes are up, you’ll see him in the morning.”
They both walked through Diagon Alley, getting pointed stares from passing wizards and witches. Some offered smiles to Harry then their gazes slid to Draco and they frowned. Lavender Brown saw him from outside the Leaky and spat at his feet. It landed nowhere near him, but the sentiment was clear. No wonder his mother still refused to go out in public. Harry didn't react but he didn't greet Lavender either. Draco could feel her eyes on them.
“No, I understand. It was unexpected.” He paused and turned away from Harry.
“Something like that,” Draco said.
“I like London,” Harry said simply.
Harry was beautiful in every way he could imagine. He seemed a bit bewildered by Draco’s insistence. But if Harry thought it was strange he didn’t say anything about it, just ‘yes’, ‘please’, ‘more’ and then brokenly, ‘Draco’.
Patience was monitoring the washing up, prodding wayward dishes with her wand at the sink, and they sat at the dining table.
They still lost on Saturday, but from then on asked him to fly and join them for all the drills. Sometimes they would laugh at him as he struggled through the harder bits; after all, he wasn’t thirteen anymore. Gryffindor played well enough and took a reasonable second in the House Quidditch rankings for the year. All his students passed. Most of the seventh years got an O or E on their NEWTs.
Harry, from the beginning, seemed to trust him right away. Draco wasn’t sure how Harry marked him as changed before he even believed it. Trust made it easier to know that even if this wasn’t love yet, it came honestly. Draco wasn’t certain what this really was for him.
Alright, so Harry wasn’t that oblivious. Draco was always good-looking. Harry could admit that much.
“Minor like the last time was minor?” Harry said.
Draco side-alonged him directly into his living room with no warning. As a former Ministry official, Harry should have said something about the fact Draco had Apparated from a fully lit set of stairs in a mixed Wizard/Muggle neighbourhood. But he was more intent on the fact that Draco loomed closer in his field of vision.
Worse still was being awake and remembering. One late night, Harry had pinned Draco against the kitchen counter and kissed him until Draco had been the one to tap out for once. Harry rolled the wooden beads on his bracelet. But this wasn’t that kind of memory.
“Give us a light, will you?” Harry asked one day while he searched Sirius’ hall closet for the key to the garden.
Draco reached into a dresser and pulled out a pack of cigarettes.
“She’s upstairs,” George answered. Harry was most worried about his reaction to Draco in this setting. George looked guarded but not hostile.
“Congratulations, it’s not Wizarding or Muggle Meningitis,” Draco announced.
“Sit on the other side,” Harry said.
“That’s what you said last week.” She didn’t use another charm, but she was loud enough without it.
“What do you want?” Harry asks, tearing his mouth away. Fuck, Harry’s almost dizzyingly hard already. “What do you want to do?” Harry corrects.
Draco tried not to shiver at the casualness with which Harry treated the information. Whatever some of these groups had mixed themselves up in was more than a social club if Aurors were surveilling them.
“How are you?” Harry says to be polite. It comes out stiff, formal.
Still, Draco tries not to think too hard about why it feels like he’s lost something when finally, he can unhook his bare ankle from Harry’s.
“Crimson,” Penny hissed at him. The water moved softly to Harry’s left.
Patience Shacklebolt was a whirlwind of a woman. As a muggleborn, Kingsley had sent her off in an illegal international portkey during the war. Harry had spent little time around Patience aside from the occasional Department function, but he liked her.
Harry heard everyone’s gentle breaths over the earpiece.
“Padma’s half in love with her,” Harry whispers back. “I thought after Cho…” Draco shrugs as if to say,
“Why would you do this for me?” Draco demanded.
He supposed it didn’t matter what he wore, but he still opted for a black t-shirt and black joggers and sat in the kitchen for a few moments, before taking out the Firebird and looking at it.
It was late October before he got a note back with a time and place at dinner. The note wasn’t even signed. Harry thought about binning it and refusing to go. He thought about conjuring the ghost of all the anger and hurt and letting it harden him.
“You didn’t know?” Hermione said. Harry shook his head no. “If you’re interested, I have a book you could read.”
Draco could see the righteous indignation building up. He didn’t want to make an enemy this way. He could see what would happen when she went round to tell people how the Head Healer had punished someone for him.
“If they’ve done this, they could strip magic from people. They could make themselves impervious to magic like Draco saw,” Kingsley said.
Harry angled his chin up defiantly. “You’re right.”
Draco told them both about his plans for his NEWTs and to become a Healer. Neither seemed very surprised. He planned to sit for seven exams since he needed five to give himself a safety net.
It's like hitting fast forward because they both scramble to get completely naked as if they'd been waiting for permission.
Harry was searching the cottage where Draco was supposed to be held. Nothing. He ran back outside and saw a flash in the distance. Before he could be sure it was Draco on the horizon, a jet of red light shot out and the person went down. Harry ran, firing some of the nastier curses he knew by instinct.
The Firebird reminded him of a paper crane made of steel. It was a beautiful contraption, and if he looked closely, he could see the morning light playing on it. At its heart was a bright white glow, like the centre of a flame. It looked like some sort of mechanical art piece from the Louvre more than a practical device. It dimmed somewhat while he held it, and he looped the chain around his neck.
Draco had never mastered throwing off an Imperius, so he sat still even though he was shaking inside.
“Oh.” Harry tries not to sound disappointed.
“Can I sit with them?” Harry said. The welcome witch froze.
. Harry had even signed it the proper way with his family’s ancestral home. The traditions were all mostly rubbish anyway, but someone must have told him the custom. He moved the peace lily to his bedroom. To make sure he watered it, he told himself.
It was a tense, awkward meal from then on until Arthur and Molly cornered Harry.
Their townhouse was in a small enclave of wizarding homes in Brixton. The exterior was plain and unassuming, but the inside was eclectic. There were little handmade charms in every window and doorway. It was a cultural thing, he thought, but didn’t want to ask. All their furniture was the same beautiful dark cherry wood which seemed more adult than the museum of mismatched dated antiques he lived in. They even had framed Muggle postcards from travelling.
“That’s why I’m wearing linen,” Draco insisted. Harry knew not to bother him when he was like this.
They continued thanking people. Laid out in front of him, he could see the divide between who had faced consequences and those who had largely got away with it. Both the Goyles were there. The Parkinsons came forward together, although without Pansy. Adora Nott greeted them by herself which meant her husband wasn’t around as he wasn’t allowed to trade in Britain.  Anneliese Crabbe was by herself. There were widows everywhere but there should have been more of them. It was a nasty thing to think but he felt it.
“Hermione, you can’t take care of everything else and not yourself. You’ll burn out. You saw what happened to me when I burnt out. Get some sleep.”
Harry thought of how far he had to walk to find Draco’s shop, how the other shops surrounding him had shuttered windows, waterlogged notices and yellowing newspapers mouldering on their doorsteps. He thought of the abundance of opportunities for forgiveness and amends available in almost every other world Draco had picked. He thought of his Draco eating alone in the basement of the Ministry and that he had worked in the department no one else in the Ministry liked.
“It’s better for me when I make steady plans. What about Tuesdays? I can come for lunch or dinner depending on my schedule,” Harry offered. Andromeda brightened.
It was an empty rough wooden cottage. Draco had assumed that they were denying him a bed and chair, but there were none. From guards marching him outside to a copse of trees to do his business, he didn’t think there was a loo either.
“Shush, it’s okay. I understand,” Harry said. “Come home and we’ll sort it.”
“I have to get back to my third years,” Harry said.
“We’ve cycled through two standard Potter topics in five minutes. What were you thinking next? Perhaps,
The card was still sitting on Harry’s kitchen table at Grimmauld and it had been at least a month. If Kreacher had been alive, it would have been filed away at least. Instead it gathered dust.
The second time, Harry is well and truly pissed off before they even get to St Mungo’s. The perpetrator escaped, but not before flinging a cursed jewellery box at both of them. It hit because they were both distracted. Draco’s attention was taken up with keeping the walls from collapsing on top of them. Harry was distracted by Draco, and that’s nearly unforgivable.
It was a gentle remark from her as if she had sensed the significance of him asking. They talked about what it had been like for Harry, the only biracial kid in his school in Surrey. Incidents as an adult, too. Hermione knew. She had plenty of her own stories. How shocked she had been to come to the wizarding world and find out there was yet another thing she couldn't help that people despised her for. The way people sometimes spoke loud and slow or played guessing games about where they thought they might be from. Trouble was that Harry had wanted so desperately to know where he was from. Here was one more piece.
"The Minister won't like the sound of this at all," Kingsley said darkly.
When they landed at St Mungo’s Auror wing, Harry collapsed. Healers surrounded him in a swirl of lime green robes but he couldn't hear a damn thing. Blood was trickling out of his ears, sticky and hot. He used the last of his strength to cast a patronus to Kingsley.
“No. Not anymore. I’m okay now,” Draco said. His hand was flat on the tabletop and Harry was seized with the urge to put his hand over his, like they had at breakfasts before. In some ways, all that time Grimmauld had been a liminal space, its own universe.
“Do you want Dreamless Sleep?”
“I promise,” Draco said more firmly. Pansy kissed him on the cheek and apparated, mid-stride.
Harry fidgeted with the glass case. "To answer your question from earlier, I come to you because...I like sharing happiness with you. And I always feel like we um, expressed that in a way that I realised might be confusing? And we are friends. And I like you a lot?" The last part was definitely not planned, and Draco whipped his head up as if to confirm what he just heard.
Harry wanted to kick a table. They were somewhere and nowhere all at once.
“It’s not red. That’s not our Draco,” Hermione said.
“Can I borrow your wand?” Draco asked casually.
“Perhaps...perhaps we could have tea sometime,” Narcissa offered, her voice wavering.
Right wing rotated twice clockwise.
His hands shook when he reached for Draco in that dark bedroom. It was ordinary and small, no velvet or green or opulent four-poster as Harry had imagined. It was a plain, neat white room, grey sheets on his bed, a book left on the dresser. Harry was suddenly nervous. Maybe waiting had made him too tentative. He tried to remember how this went with someone new, pressed up against Draco, tasting his mouth.
His father, who had loomed large over him all his life, was
And this time they were on the same page about what occasion was worth celebrating.
Harry waits until Draco leans forward and brushes his lips tentatively. The bond fizzes to life in Harry’s veins. This is something different than the others. They should stay away from each other so it could dissipate. There is no pain when Harry lets go out of shock. They should go straight to St Mungo's.
“You alright?” Harry asked, noting Draco lapse into silence. They walked a bit further than they needed. It was a beautiful cool summer evening with a slight breeze and Harry wanted to enjoy it a bit more.
“No, Molly’s in the kitchen and George is setting up the lights and balloons indoors,” Ron said.
Harry had been avoiding interfering with other universes’ Harrys but maybe it was time to interfere a little.
There was a pang of sympathy there as he caught Draco’s brief slip. It was only because Harry had lost so many people that he recognized the pain that had passed over his features. Harry remembered the Greengrass sisters vaguely. Pretty, blonde and pureblooded. He had always imagined Malfoy married to someone like that by arrangement, but he had loved her. He missed her.
The Special Task Force descended on a shipping container on the Greenwich Peninsula near midnight. There were mostly muggle flats here, and a cable car for tourists that was closed. So far, all their operations had been surveillance and the occasional questioning of a stray low-level operative who inevitably knew nothing but wasted their time. Most of the information that came in was useless or after the fact. Minister for Magic Dale Steel was getting impatient.
“Mmmm, you smell like the hospital,” Harry teased. Harry lightly bit on the column of his neck and a little frisson of pleasure passed through him.
Some things never changed. Pansy huffed while she straightened her grey silk robes and checked for snags. Draco didn’t even see her cast the stinging hex that hit his ankle. Pansy snickered as he grabbed it. They were too old to break furniture roughhousing again, so he called a reluctant truce.
"Harry, I have to go," Draco says. "I'm working today."
Not having access to any magic or unfiltered news had bothered him the most, actually. Muggles seemed, on the whole, alright. They were no more inclined to evil or ignorance or weakness than any wizard. It didn’t seem like the sort of conversation he could have with Greg. Greg smirked again, and Draco realized he really did not like that expression.
"Fucking finally!”
There were flowers everywhere. They had coaxed the garden to bloom and multiplied them. All the arrangements had been placed under a stasis spell and arranged in accordance of closeness to the family. Only he and his mother would attend the burial.
“You’re very good together,” Theo remarked later, as they were walking through Wizarding London. Pansy was talking Harry’s ear off about something up ahead and he was nodding. The hair potion had worn off, so Harry’s hair was starting to get messy again.
All right, fine, Draco wasn't doing so well on the not touching part. It was so much easier to redirect Harry's attention with a touch of the knee, a hand at the small of his back, fingers splayed on his forearm.
Andromeda stared at a lesser Rosier cousin who had clearly been eavesdropping and turned her back to him. For someone who had left the pureblood inner circle decades ago, Aunt Andromeda still knew how to deliver a cut direct. The cousin scampered away.
“Well, what do you want to do, Harry?” Ginny had asked him several times. No matter where the fight started: whose turn to wash the dishes or attending a party or how long she’d be away or living somewhere other than Grimmauld, it always ended on this topic.
There had been things he had been doing for no reason at all, like continuing a relationship with Ginny past its natural end, staying up too late to keep his Auror schedule even though he wasn’t going in and drinking too much. There were things he had avoided doing like cooking in his own kitchen, doing anything about the remaining renovations at Grimmauld or even figuring what he wanted out of his life.
“No,” Harry said firmly.
“What does your son want from Fortescue's?”
“Of course, Malfoy,” Harry said, attempting to match what he thought this Harry Potter would say. Maybe he should have done the Acting Society at school instead of Quidditch. Circe knew he was no good at pretending to be himself.
“The entire day it was you,” Harry said. He didn’t see the point of pretending. He held up his Firebird to eye level. Draco would recognize it. He was smart enough to recognize the glow of a proximity spell.
Returning to his normal voice, Draco said, “What are you holding in your hand?”
Two people came by and woke him up roughly.
“Many in the court feel that this is exceptionally lenient considering your crimes. However, we have agreed that reconciliation must mean an effort to re-integrate those lesser criminals involved in the Death Eaters.” Whispers broke out. Lesser meant next to nothing under the circumstances and Draco got the distinct feeling not everyone agreed.
“Are you feeling okay?” Draco asked him. His hand was resting on Harry’s thigh. Too high up to be friendly, too casual to be new.
Draco stood in the ballroom with his mother in deep black robes an hour later, receiving people he hadn’t seen in decades. People he’d rather not see at all. But they were all bound by the same customs. At least, no one would ask him questions or make remarks where he could hear it. They all offered their condolences, and their respect.
“No. You’d report directly to me. It’ll be a small team.” Kingsley was asking. He wasn’t ordering. And that was what worried Harry most.
Draco made gentle shushing noises, led her to her rooms and gave her a sleeping draft for her nerves. He collapsed outside of her room, expecting it was his turn to cry. But nothing came. He supposed he should have told his mother she was not alone, but Draco didn’t count in the way she meant.
The minute he catches sight of him, Harry knows it wouldn’t have mattered how long it was. It was always going to feel just like this, overwhelming and breathless and too much. Harry has almost forgotten the shape of his name, it takes so long to come up. There is a Draco in his head who is still eighteen and here is this man, who is clearly not the same person. Draco is just as stunned to see him.
“Not everyone is you, Harry,” Draco said. Curious that he switched to his first name. That felt intimate but correct.
“If I ever figure out how to shield electronics from magic in here....” Patience trailed off.
Teddy. He meant Teddy.
He expects her to argue with him or needle Draco or even ask when they can be available to view another house. Instead, her mouth goes a bit wobbly. Not her usual crocodile tears for dramatic effect in the Pansy-And-Draco show way. She just slumps in her black dress and tears run silently to her chin.
Draco glanced over at Harry’s expression, which was caught between confusion and more laughter.
good in emerald dress robes and black patent leather dress shoes that Draco picked out, that was just a bonus. Draco could look, respectfully. Look and don't touch had always been his rule for Harry in terms of his overall feelings and it had worked so far.
“Bonding curse,” Draco says shortly once they arrive.
“You’re always late and you’re never sorry,” Draco replied.
“Of course.” Harry brought out his wand and the blood vanished from the floor and their clothes. Surely Harry saw enough blood in his own line of work, why did he look so worried?
“I’ve got this friend who is having a party. Very cool girl.”
“No, I don’t think I will,” Harry said. He reached for his wand to cast another cooling charm.
Harry didn’t think he would ever get over the fact that he could not pretend to be himself with his own face on. Harry expected Draco to sit on the other side of the table but he dropped in the booth next to Harry. The place setting was also there. Harry stared.
She handed him a package thick with documents and hurried out into another room. With no supervisor in sight, he carefully opened the package. There was a thick sheaf of official-looking identification papers and cards for a Drake Malloy: birth certificate, national identification number and bank card. On the bright side, they were all labelled with a brief explanation because he had no fucking clue what any of those things were or what they were used for.
He spent the rest of the weekend alternately drinking some gin he had found in Sirius’ wardrobe and playing terrible pop music on the wireless that kind of reminded him of being in pubs right after the War.
“Absolutely not. Let’s get you home. You’re a menace.”
Harry had a...thing about people wearing his clothes. It made his throat itch. No one should dress in someone else’s castoffs. Even if Harry was going to wear things in poor condition, it made him feel like he wasn’t taking care of the people around him when they did. He had since realized that gritting his teeth because someone borrowed his housecoat or cardigan was not typical for friends and especially not lovers.
“You’re not at all curious about what other lives you could have led?” Hermione asked.
“I’ll be sure to get you vinegar someone’s pissed in so you can both have something you’ll enjoy,” Draco shot back, shrugging their hands off.
They had done that again, in Harry’s flat the next morning after a measured conversation about the weather. Then again, in the coat closet at Ron’s birthday party with a hastily constructed privacy charm, because it felt like Draco knew how Harry felt. They had kissed too, in this very shop in the backroom on Draco’s workbench, when they got the news about Andromeda's full recovery.
“Of course I don’t know you! Every time I try to get to know you, you push me away!” Kingsley shouted back. Harry had never heard that tone from him. He sounded like he was pleading. Why would he be pleading about anything?
Athena was the first to grasp it. Harry could practically see her mind whirring with possibilities.
Head Healer Forsyth Cummins taught the second-year practicum herself. Draco rather suspected it was so she could save St Mungo’s money by making sure she didn’t have to waste wages on anyone who would drop out in their third year rotations. She reminded him of Professor Snape with a broad Essex accent and without the vaguely avuncular concern.
Harry laughed. He hadn’t expected Draco to be this amusing in any iteration. This had nothing to do with the investigation, but Harry thought he liked these Dracos absent from their context. They were all missing something, but they were intriguing. They were vivid in a way his Draco didn’t seem to be. What were the choices those Dracos had made that made the difference?
“Scared, Potter?” Draco mumbled.
“They go to an in-between place. We can’t study it because no one remembers being there. Like a dream,” Hermione said. Harry frowned slightly.
Harry laughed. His mum theatrically rolled her eyes.
“Hogwarts doesn’t change much, but it’s good to be here,” McGonagall said. She clapped her hands. “Shall we?”
Draco kissed him softly once. Harry kissed him back harder.
“Alright,” Draco agreed. Harry watched the line of his throat as he took the shot easily and then shuddered.
“I went on my Grand Tour with Blaise Zabini. We started in Italy since one of us spoke the language and we both wanted to get far enough away that no one could report back. We were sixteen. Father wouldn’t have minded the drinking and gambling halls, but he didn’t like the political salons. Too many radicals, actors, practicing out-of-wedlock homosexuals...” Here Draco winked.
“I like it,” Draco says. He examines a trellis and brushes his fingers on the overgrown roses. Most of the time these days Draco looks tired, but right now he looks content. Alert. A sweet impulse rises in Harry and he kisses Draco’s cheek softly, then his hand. Draco leans against him, tipping his head back against Harry’s shoulder. Harry wraps his arm around him and tries to imagine living here. He can’t.
“Really? How interesting.” Greg told him more about Quidditch before abruptly again, focusing on Draco.
Twice a week Draco answered incredibly invasive questions from mind healer Melinda Bar de Houck. She was a witch, but one who seemed perfectly at ease with the Muggle world. She was in her mid-forties, spoke English with a slight German burr and had a collection of cardigans and pins that Draco, despite himself, liked. Her office was a brisk 40-minute walk  from the bookshop in a small plaza.
There was so much relief when he saw Draco. This Harry practically bowled Harry over with the strength of his feelings. It must be exhausting to feel this much all the time. He would have thought a continuing War would make him the opposite—more reserved, more disciplined.
He sent one last letter, and it was the most pathetic yet. He almost didn’t send it. It said:
“Let’s see.”
“You’ll Obliviate me, won’t you?” Draco whispered. Harry nodded. He could do that. But why?
“No,” Harry admits. “I never ended up joining. I went to uni. And now I mostly teach and do some research at Lexham U. Still Defense,” Harry says. The more they speak, the more Draco’s accent slides back closer to Harry’s.
Tomorrow finds them a few blocks down at an old English-style muggle pub that has seen better days. It feels weird, like a facsimile of home but exaggerated to cartoonish effect. The place is empty except for the sole staff member. The barman takes their orders, gives them both a pint. Harry has a Molson Canadian, because it sounds safe and he drank it yesterday. Draco asks a flurry of questions about what's on tap before ordering a Double Black IPA, whatever that is.
Draco put his wand away and held up his hands. “It would be good to do a physical examination too, if I may be permitted?”
“I’m fine,” Harry said. He took a deep breath. His body felt a bit panicked, but he knew some of his memories were trapdoors. Sometimes he would catch a whiff of a sickening sweet perfume that reminded him of Umbridge and he would have to pause. Remind himself that she was long dead. Try not to choke on the memory. What was he remembering?
“Putting yourself down. I don’t—we don’t think about you like that. You have other interests.” It was almost touching how hard Draco was trying.
Slowly, over the next few months, he felt like all the missing parts of him were returning.
,” Harry said. “I know what I want.” He felt sick at the idea that all of this could be summed up as confusion. It wasn’t a matter of picking up the wrong brand of toothpaste.
Quite like that one, because at least I can take part.
Theo sat and watched, but by now, Draco was used to his silences.
But a reluctant half dose didn’t even touch Draco’s nightmares.
“Of course Penelope did!” Ron said, only mildly outraged.
“Potter,” Draco said. His voice was soft and dangerous.
“I’m not a baby,” Teddy said. He very much looked like one to Harry, but he refrained from saying so. He was tall for his age and tried to eat Andromeda out of house and home, but Harry could lift him one-handed which was probably his best measure for a child being big.
Draco was able to wriggle his fingers and undo the spell without them noticing, but he was a little offended that they didn’t even bother with something more complicated than a first year spell. They entered somewhere that smelt of mothballs and lavender. Draco was thrown to a rough hardwood floor with a scratchy blanket and heard a door slam shut.
“This is supposed to be a close universe?” Harry asked, watching one patron snort a white line off the bar. Neither the bartender nor the other patrons paid them any mind. He wasn’t a Hitwizard or anything, but he thought people should at least be discreet about their drug use.
Harry knew he should have been at least counting the shots.
They were already friends against all odds.
"Why is it always me?" Draco wondered aloud after Harry passed his licensing exam. "Why do you always come to share
“That’s why you should buy me a full-size broom,” Teddy said.
Draco bit down on the back of his own knuckle, eyes fluttering shut.
Good, Harry wasn’t the only one surprised, as evidenced by the incredibly stilted conversation they were having.
Draco tilts his head to the side. There is something about the way this creature feels that abruptly lets him know she...
Harry felt distinctly unwell himself, but he was suddenly glad he’d kept up seeing Healer Blishwick. All the implications hit him and he narrowed his focus to the exact colour of the living room flooring for five breaths before the feeling returned to his hands.
“Azkaban?” She breathed, barely daring to ask the question.
Harry looked at his hand, a shade of deep brown he had never seen on himself. After a summer playing Quidditch and hiking, his heritage was always more obvious to other people, but this was more than a few afternoons in the English sun.
“Just call me Gabe.” Gabriel put a hand on his shoulder as a friendly gesture. A shiver passed through Draco, but if Gabriel noticed he didn't react. “Ravenclaw, but I think I’m four or five years older than you. Shall we?”
“Do not,” Harry mumbled. He wasn’t so far gone that it was on purpose, he thought.
Draco used a different quick motion, and incantation for each of the runes, and they disappeared. Sometimes it was a tiny controlled motion, and sometimes it seemed like Draco had to throw all of his weight onto the balls of his feet. A few times he bit his thumb of one hand and continued to cast with the other as if it was nothing. Harry found it fascinating, watching him work.
Harry wondered if a wizarding house that was old enough could talk because Narcissa cocked her head to one side and said, “Pansy and Theo are here.”
“We don’t know,” Kingsley said. Admitting that seemed to weigh on him.
“Did you go looking for me?” Harry asked, softly. It seemed like breaking the stillness of this moment should be more reverent. It felt like he should have more to say than a foolish hope.
Eustace was a foot shorter than Draco with a full head of white hair. Draco would peg him somewhere between fifty and seventy if he had to guess. He would find out soon, he was sure. Eustace was extremely chatty and did not seem to need his input to continue speaking.
Draco turned to Camilla Thiessen. She was dressed, as always, like she had robbed a jewelry store and then one of the peacocks from the Manor for her hat, in heavy diamond gauntlets and collar over gaudy patterned robes. Her eyeliner was caked on and crooked. Draco adored her, if only because she actually read his papers and always came prepared with a question that wasn't about profits.
The worst, because no matter where he was in their flat, Draco was exactly aware of where Harry was, and he couldn’t relax as long as he was trying not to slip up and do something stupid. Every once in a while, Harry got caught by one of the Slytherins, and Draco could tell they were teasing him. Draco didn’t think anyone would outright tell Harry about his crush, but trying to help was almost certainly worse.
“Draco. There will be more invitations to that kind of thing. Don’t go to any of them. Promise me,” Pansy looked worried.
“I will buy you a broom when you get to Hogwarts, if you keep your grades up until then,” Harry said.
“They were mistaken. I’ll sit with them,” Harry said. Damn him, he was curious. He wanted to know this version of them both.
“Let me be. It doesn’t matter,” Draco said. His voice was so flat, emotionless.
“Precisely,” Hermione said. She smiled the way he did when faced with first years who needed encouragement to grasp basic wandwork. Harry rolled his eyes.
It is, Harry wanted to say. Simple’s got nothing to do with it. It’s worth it. I want you to choose. Was it the same for you or was it just me?
But Harry obediently came to the dance floor and did some two-stepping and finger pointing to the beat. There were only a couple inches between them and they kept getting knocked closer together.
The antechamber was unassuming. Stepping into the larger structure, Harry turned slowly in a circle to take it all in. It looked like someone had built it just yesterday, smooth clay brick, detailed carvings and intact gold inlay tiles. The structure itself was impressive enough, but Harry had never seen a pyramid so well preserved.
“Harry Potter is no doubt shilling hair potion for Witch Weekly and attending ribbon cuttings. I don’t know why he had to walk into my shop to gloat on top of it all.”
Harry rolls his eyes. They do too much fieldwork for Senior Aurors and they both know it, but he didn't particularly want to solve that by spending a week in the dusty depths of the Ministry's sub-basement. Their assigned section is through three vault doors.The lanterns light one small portion of this cavernous mass of shelving at a time. The sound is muffled and time seems slower down there.
“Those are yours,” Harry said.
Funny enough, it was that sentence that shocked Harry into reflecting despite the lovely meal and stroll, he was here for a reason. Florean in his universe had died. Draco knew what ice cream flavours his children liked. Here was Harry, licking a chai ice cream cone like none of it mattered. Draco handed him the bag as they finished.
"So you do know me."
"I feel like I'm at a disadvantage here, because I don't know what you were thinking," Harry murmurs.
“We’re not seventy-five years old, we’re not doing a bus tour,” Michael Corner says firmly, tossing the flashing conference pamphlet advertising just that into the tiny plastic bin under the desk of their shared hotel room.
Draco’s condescension came in handy since Harry did not know what he was supposed to be doing. Instead of pretending he knew the incantations, he focused his attention on Draco and followed his wandwork. As though Draco were the point on an Auror case, Harry used his intent and magic to bolster Draco rather than trying to do anything on his own.
“I could share the information I’ve learned about mechanics. Nothing private,” Draco said.
“Why the fuck does it hurt when we aren’t touching?” Harry says groggily. Draco might have said that more politely. He likes Tadenik most of the time.
Harry was staying up just in case. Athena had let him know the operation was a success with only a few escapees. They’d managed to round up all the dangerous items for later study. Minister Dale Steel had done a triumphant press conference with particular emphasis that he had arrested his own senior staff in the pursuit of justice.
Harry did not call a mind healer out of any sense of professional preservation, though he should have.
“Do you want to sell it, then?” Draco asked carefully.
“Are you well? Any symptoms?” Draco said. His wand was already out, although he paused as if waiting for permission.
If Harry didn’t know him better, Draco looked to be perfectly at ease, composed and professional. A more casual acquaintance would have missed Draco's bloodless fist clenched hard on the front display case, and his gaze was distinctly frosty.
“Listen to me, Teddy. Your classmates are being silly. We’ll talk to the school and it will stop, and you will make new friends,” Harry said.
"You're not—" is the first thing Harry thinks to blurt.
It felt like if Draco turned around at exactly the right moment, he could spot himself and Pansy wearing the minimum amount of uniform they could get away with and complaining about homework. Draco shook his head.
"Have you seen him lately?"
Harry didn't want to linger where he could make a mistake, though.
“I’ve never been able to produce a corporeal Patronus here,” Draco said.
“When I came here last time I wanted your support. Unwisely, you declined. Do what you want, Malfoy. Fuck Harry Potter in the streets like a whore. Spend your time with a pair of blood traitors. Pretend you live in this new world. I wanted to remind you that you live in the old one. You’ll know soon enough that all those changes they made were optional,” Greg said. Draco set aside the insults. Something about the way he spoke doused Draco’s spine in ice water.
“What do you mean clearly?” Draco sputtered.
“Draco, maybe you should take him home.”
, all grace and easy athleticism, but he had kept to himself as an adult. They were both alone a lot. Maybe Draco had always been alone, and he was new to all of this.
He committed to memory the sound when Harry was getting too close writhing on Draco’s fingers, the taste of the skin behind his ear, the scent of their sweat mingling and how it felt when he finally let go the one way he was allowed.
“I have to go find my friend!” Harry shouted over the music. The man he was dancing with shrugged and danced off in another direction. The thick press of people’s bodies against his was sweaty and hot.
“Oh, and one last thing.” Gabriel pulled out a silver bracelet, engraved with enchantments. “It mutes your magic.”
"Neville's too good for you and you know it," Hermione said.
“Indirect spells only. Aim at the ground. We don’t know how many of them might have the absorption magic,” Athena said.
The best because he was so happy to see everyone: Margaret from Paediatrics, Jim from Intake, most of his year in Spell Damage, some of his unit, all his childhood friends.
Since he was the only person besides Hermione who knew what he was going through, a hastily cast Muffliato in a private enclave of the Rose & Dagger was all he needed to confess the part he'd left out of his discussion with her.
“I don’t think he knows anything,” the second one said.
Theo seemed content to poke around the room, reading some books Draco had brought home with him and picking up a toy snitch on Draco’s desk. Theo seemed to let Pansy do all the talking. And talk she did. Pansy told him stock prices, which shop vendors would allow former Death Eaters in and which Ministry officials would accept bribes.
“What horrible evidence have you brought for me this time? A hellhound’s head? Three Dark magic infused slippers? The cursed knickers of my late Aunt Bellatrix?” Draco said as they finished dinner.
So he knew Gregory Goyle was not one of the people who had taken the Fall as a reason to change his views.
And then Harry was kissing him again and didn't stop when the door to the kitchen banged open.
“And I owe you a Life Debt. If you’re going to waste my time talking rubbish, get out of my shop,” Draco said. Draco made a pushing motion and Harry found himself on the other side of the glass shop door with Draco waving with a serene expression on the other side.
Harry finally realized he had missed out by not waiting for Draco to kiss him.
“I’m not fucking sleeping here anymore,” Draco says, after the newest poltergeist rips the sink out of a wall at Grimmauld at three am in a rush of water. Harry is forced to admit he might have a fair point between the phantom rats, a recurring Boggart problem, rotting floorboards and a rattling sound in the attic that Harry isn’t quite brave enough to investigate.
"I am not. Bisexual," Draco answers neatly. This information is like a bludger to the back of the head.
Draco grabbed his arm to stop Harry from falling over, but Harry wasn’t that close to the edge.
Neutrality gets that much harder when he climbs the spiralling front staircase to their rooms. The memories flood in unbidden. Here’s a light and a stark reminder that he had been a boy in these halls. The nursery where house-elves had changed his nappies and his parents had sung him lullabies was untouched, as if they had shut it something like twenty years prior and set it in amber. The wainscotting is bright, the wallpaper a tasteful patterned baby blue. His crib is still there, as is the bassinet.
“It’s for you. It’s a gift. A gift for you. Because you like that sort of thing. I’m not implying anything.”
"Hi," he says. He sounds nervous.
So he did. During his evenings, he learned to turn on and then watch television even though he understood none of the shows, wrote to his mother, and read something until it was about time for bed. When he couldn’t stand to be idle, he would do push-ups in his bedroom until his arms gave out.
“You have to teach me these things, Theo. Draco and I are disgraced aristocrats and now you’re a man of the people,” Pansy said. Theo snorted.
The kiss had been a dare and Draco had kissed him easy as anything, playing it up for the crowd until Pansy told them to knock it off. Suddenly confronted with a lap full of Draco Malfoy, Harry froze and let him sit there for an hour all the while knowing he was doing something wrong. Ginny had kissed Michael Corner too, but it wasn't the same. She wasn't Michael's friend in that way. Harry spent half his time outside class studying with Draco, or arguing with Draco or sometimes even napping with him.
“Go, let’s go.” They make quick work of the stairs and see a tall broad woman trying to fight through the flames to retrieve something. She is desperate, wand upheld, trying to use a charm to blow back the fire but feeding the growing flames. She has to be involved if she’s still here. But Harry would say that no one deserves to die over something so minor. So Draco grits his teeth and draws up his cloak and its protective spells and steps in front of Harry.
“We don’t know. It’s pretty clear that they are all answering to a central purpose,” Zacharias said.
“Does that sound like something he would do these days?” Harry asked Hermione incredulously.
“I’m tired from the Portkey,” Harry says. To his credit, Michael ignores him.
“You can go to Seven Sisters. There’s another outside that station. You will hardly find an empty street corner this time of day.”
The ground was pockmarked and hilly and awful. Harry was suddenly grateful for all those runs, because they had taught him to stay steady. He ducked and held up the Portkey and felt someone grab onto his trouser leg. He tried to kick them off but they held on steady when they arrived at gates at Malfoy Manor. The sudden weight made them all fall, and Harry saved his cushioning charm for Draco while he crashed to the driveway so hard his teeth rattled.
“Don’t put too much pepper, dear. The boy doesn’t have an iron cauldron for a stomach like you do,” Patience said. She elbowed Harry conspiratorially, grinning widely. Harry sat on their couch, holding his mug of tea. Her smile and laugh was contagious.
“Are you alright ducky?” An older woman said at the landing. She didn’t wait for his answer before putting her hands on her hips and shouting up the stairs.
“Is Ron coming?” Harry asked. He expected Hermione to answer.
“It's yours. Your room was closer.”
“Fine then. Sometimes, for special cases, we need outside consultants and researchers. We pay, but not a lot. It would be helpful,” Harry said.
In the end he had taken NEWTs for Transfiguration, Potions, Herbology, Charms, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Arithmancy and Ancient Runes. After a week straight of exams he slept for fourteen hours.
Harry asked Hermione about the other universes in a roundabout way because otherwise, she pursed her lips in that unhappy way of hers. She didn’t want him to dwell, Harry thought. But it was impossible not to dwell.
“I feel strange,” Harry admitted.
Harry seems furious the moment they are drawn together. Draco is not surprised. He had been thinking of the last bond curse when this happened. The guilt warring with the practicality, the way Harry had gulped down air after he came, the satisfaction that Harry wasn't immune to him. No doubt the image had inspired their current predicament.
“If I’d known it was that tricky, I might have sent one of the Senior Cursebreakers with you. Good job. That’ll be the toughest part and we can get some Alexandrian government officials in sooner for recovery,” Bill said finally.
His working theory, considering the last universe, was that Draco didn’t want to stay out there or he would have stopped jumping at the first halfway decent universe and tossed his Firebird off a cliff or under a bus. Harry would have never found him.
"I'll show you," Draco promises. "But we will go on a date," Draco is letting him go reluctantly, Harry thinks.
“I am,” Harry admitted. “You’re happy?”
“You don’t pay me to talk, Harry,” Draco said. He had draped himself in a sheer emerald green silk robe that only reached mid-thigh. His legs were so long. There was so much skin. Harry felt his cheeks heat and looked away.
Had he ever heard Draco tell a story before? Was he always this unfocused or was this courtesy of this world?
There was one key fact Harry had forgotten about Draco. He was incredibly enjoyable to rile up. And it was so easy. Harry wasn’t even doing it on purpose.
“You called Hermione and Ron?” Harry asked Penny.
"Sip your water, Potter.” Draco hadn’t even turned around. “If you sick up on the floor and set off a trap, I’ll kill you.”
"Draco. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to—I would never have acted on what you saw."
“No.” At least Benjamin didn’t look put out. He handed the chart back to Healer Cummins, who Draco belatedly realized was staring at him.
“You are correct.” Healer Cummins said quietly. “Why did you laugh, Trainee Alden?”
Harry returned to himself slumped over the kitchen table. His back ached a little. He was mentally exhausted, although on the whole his body felt fine. He stood up and drank three glasses of water and finally stopped himself from shaking. It was over. He felt both wrung out and renewed.
“Is picking terrible ice cream flavours a Malfoy trait?”
Harry was a few inches taller than both of his parents, taller than he was at home. His father looked like him aside from the thinning grey hair, but some differences wouldn’t show up in a memory or photograph. Like the fact that the sheepish smile on his father’s face looked exactly like his own. He’d assumed his kids in the other universe had their freckles from Ginny, but it could have easily been from his mum.
Much of the time he had no context for why he was doing what he did. It was typical for a newbie, but it bothered him that Harry sometimes wouldn’t know until months later who they were tracking or why it was urgent to decommission an object. Sometimes he never found out.
He continued to see Blaise a couple times a year when he came to London, but it was nothing serious.
“We’ve been over this. It’s Kingsley to you, Harry,” Kingsley said, pointing his quill at him.
Over the next few weeks, Draco got into a routine. Every morning, he tried to make coffee, and it went badly because there was no magic. He could not cook, so whatever mess of coffee he made was his breakfast. He generally managed to make himself a sandwich for lunch.
Harry, selfishly, liked watching Draco hold babies. Draco had a natural warmth to him that came out as he cradled anyone’s child. He was patient, and made funny faces. He forgot to be so self-conscious.
"He's around, but you know how he is," Hermione said.
Draco’s hair was mussed, his lips were red, and his pale neck already had faint pink marks where Harry’s teeth had presumably been. Harry’s Firebird did not glow.
“Just because you knew Dorcas doesn’t mean you know me!” Athena shouted.
“I can’t today. Tomorrow?” Draco says. “I’d really like that.”
“Believe me, enjoying nightclubs is the least of our potential problems,” Hermione said. “You should see what I’ve seen myself get up to.”
"I don't know what I saw," Draco lies neatly. In any case that was a fantasy. Draco knows he doesn't look like that in real life. "That's not why."
“Were they poor?” Draco asked gently. It was probably the closest they had come to personal topics recently and apparently Draco had led them straight to Childhood Trauma.
But it wasn’t the truth.
The next morning didn’t reassure him in the slightest. He drank half a coffee, stared into space, and realized he was running late. He had apparently forgotten his Floo fee because the network shut his Floo with an extremely pissy note that said his account was in arrears once again. He sprinted to the Apparition point and Hermione said nothing about him arriving twenty-two minutes late and out of breath.
They looked at each other so lovingly, Harry noticed. He set aside that pang of envy.
She looked every inch Lucius Malfoy’s wife and he suspected that was the armour she was using to get through today.
“No. But he will,” Draco insisted.
“So why do you work there again?”
“I’m sorry,” Draco said.
“You learn by doing, don’t you?” Hermione said. Right, so she was going to send him into the multiverse with nothing but a magical device and a set of vague instructions. She smirked a little. Harry thought she would have a textbook or manual or something.
“Your valet won’t thank you for that,” Draco said. Draco reached out and straightened his cravat. A tingle passed through him.
Harry thought it could be something more, but it wasn’t.
“You don’t like the house,” Pansy states flatly, when she arrives back without the key.
“You’re in Grimmauld Place, at my house. It’s okay,” Harry said.
“I’ll fucking bet,” Harry says, because he can’t really help himself. Draco shoots him a
Draco stepped back and passed him his wand.
“No,” Harry said quietly. “It was a punishment. I forget to eat sometimes when I’m stressed.”
“Nonsense. You’re doing fine and I’ve got to watch the stove,” Molly said. She smiled and waved at Rosie, bundled in Draco’s arms. She had made her mind up to try for Harry’s sake and Harry loved her for it.
Draco refused. It wasn’t until hours later when Harry awoke to him flailing that he said, “I won’t take a full dose.”
“Of course they are real,” Harry said.
Harry stunned him without a second thought and kept running. A yellow jet of light shot towards his face and he dropped into the mud rolling unconscious Draco onto his back. Harry fired off two more stunners, dark red with intent, blindly. He knew they hit but added two more lightning spells to the ground where he thought they had stood, just in case. He stood up, slung Draco over his shoulders again and began to sprint. His breath was coming fast and wild but he had to reach the edge and get him out.
“So you’d rather tell me what you will do after your program is up, is that it?” Melinda pressed. Draco groaned.
"Draco Malfoy, I've been looking for you," Yannick said, clapping a hand onto his shoulder.
“We work together,” Harry explains.
“Death Eater scum,” Trainee Forrester said as she passed. It wasn’t particularly inventive but he couldn’t say he didn’t deserve it.
Harry didn’t bother denying the charge. He had given up on pretending he wasn’t fixated on Draco Malfoy and should have long ago. It was freeing. Harry Potter, the Boy Who Knew Draco Malfoy Was Up To Something.
"We'll sign the waiver," Draco says.
Draco lets his hand drag along the wallpaper, leaving streaks in the yellowing grime. His fingers dance over the bannister as he goes down the stairs, watching motes of dust plume upward. He holds onto the front door so long, he felt like he might not shut it.
He had corresponded with Headmistress McGonagall, who agreed to allow him to take his NEWTs without attending once he returned. There was only a year and a half to go. He would need some time to study. No magical materials and no wand meant there was not much he could do at the moment. At least, now he was sleeping, the tremor in his hands had subsided.
There was her own bitterness there for his paternal grandfather that his mother had shut up tight when he was a child. He was fascinated that apparently all this had gone on and he’d never noticed a tension between them. But her story wasn’t done.
Honestly, what the fuck did Theo do at the Department of Mysteries all day that gave him insights like that?
He startled awake, even though this dream seemed more benign than the others. This fucking case. It was getting to him. He rubbed his face hard. Harry tried to hold on to the dream, but the details slipped away like trying to catch wind in a sieve.
“Would you like a glass of water?” Draco said. Harry’s eyes flashed. Draco couldn’t tell whether Harry liked or hated it when he acted like it was his home. But he reacted and that’s all that mattered.
“You need someone here,” was all Penelope said.
He had run a few scans with his wands, poked at it with his magic, checked its properties and removed some of the protective spells. The whole thing made him queasy until he was certain it was a dud. The necklace was a hideous, heavy thing made of goblin wrought silver, crystal and genuine giant sapphires the size of a knut. There were similar pieces of jewelry the Malfoys had in their vault but nothing that was so tasteless. Without a doubt, it had been chosen to look expensive rather than nice.
"I want to date you," Draco says. "I want to date you and I don't want to lose my job over it."
All the rest passed in a blur.
“Two dozen of the special kind with pistachios,” Harry said. She only made them around the holidays and it would annoy Ron, but they could sort that out themselves. Ron was in Ibiza on an Auror mission right now, anyway. He didn’t have to know.
"Not a replica."
“Pansy has already done one scandalous thing. She’ll get married in the forest by Parkinson Place like the rest of them,” Draco chimed in.
In thirty seconds, this Harry had seen more action than Harry had in the last five years.
Harry, despite himself, sat up by the fireplace and waited. Harry would have sworn he stayed awake but he drifted between sleep and wakefulness until he startled. He was being levitated back to the bedroom, against Draco’s chest. When Draco noticed Harry had awoken, he smiled and pressed a soft kiss to his forehead.
“Paris?” Harry asked.
“You could quit,” Harry told him. Draco wasn’t the type, too loyal, but Harry could put the idea in his head.
“You could also go into Major Procedures,” Pansy said. Draco sighed.
Pansy and Theo swept in together so late there was barely anyone left but their house-elves, tidying up the remaining refreshments. His mother hugged both of them, kissing the tops of their heads.
“Gobstones?” Pansy offered to Draco. She hadn’t bothered repeating all the sentimental nonsense Draco had heard all day and he loved her for it.
“Wait,” Kingsley said into charmed earpieces. They waited. Five minutes, fifteen minutes, thirty minutes.
“He could have some sort of spell that only absorbs stunners,” Harry reasoned.
“You’ll make yourself ill when it wears off,” Draco snapped. Harry thought of casting anyway but decided he didn’t want to collapse of heat exhaustion. It felt unfair to do that to a borrowed body.
“You don’t know how? Weren’t you raised by—” Draco abruptly cut himself off. Harry was embarrassed, but the Dursleys never bothered allowing Harry out enough for him to learn about the Underground.
That kiss was supposed to be for a laugh but a lot of his confusion coalesced into something bright, sharp and painfully clear. Harry wanted him. Even though, at the time, he was dating Ginny. Even though they were friends despite a Quidditch rivalry and a perfectly normal amount of sucker punches off the pitch between years one and three. Even though neither of their parents would like it and their friends barely tolerated each other. Even though, later they were roommates.
“I hear you’ve been hanging around Harry Potter. You’ve changed, Draco.” The faux concern in Greg’s voice was menacing. Draco decided the best play was not to speak unless asked a direct question as they sat. Draco did not offer him tea or coffee or petit-fours. He was not welcome.
"You've convinced me," Mrs Thiessen said.
“Trainee Malfoy, you’ll do well to remember very few people would disagree with her. Get out of my sight.”
This time the first sensation Harry became aware of was overwhelming heat. He was sweating lightly as if even his own body recognized giving up too much water in this environment would be foolhardy. There was a crisp blue sky as far as he could see and endlessly blowing beige sand.
“Do you want to get out of here?” Draco asked him. “Come if you’re up for it, Hermione. Last time was fun.”
That night he dreamt that he was in his quarters at Hogwarts and it was gradually filling with ice-cold water. The waves lapped over his desk, over his kitchen and his dining table.
“If you ever say another sentence to me with the words “dead sexy” and “Draco Malfoy” in it I’ll have you committed,” Ron said, after listening to Harry’s directionless ramble.
“You know it was that or in-house counsel for Gringotts if I wanted reasonable hours so my son isn’t raised by a rotating cast of expensive, unionized house-elves. My wife hates...I mean, Astoria would have hated the idea.”
“Are there any rules?” Harry said, tapping his finger on the desk.
“I’m trying,” Draco said.
“I’ve told him that,” Draco said as Harry replied, “I fucking know it isn’t.”
That morning it seemed like they had shattered the illusion they could hole up in Harry’s house together. There was something wrong and it was beyond them to fix. Harry was beginning to worry that it would ultimately hurt Draco even if he didn't want to give this up. Draco agreed to have Harry contact Hermione.
“Patience has been hoping you might come for dinner again.”
“I want to stay there,” Draco said. He was resolute. No sign of the Draco who had knelt in front of him and wept remained.
He did not read the rest of the letter. He could not read the rest of the letter. He held his mother while she sobbed until his robes were wet with tears and her voice was almost gone.
They wake up in the middle of the night and fuck again, so quiet most of what Harry hears is their bodies and the sheets sliding against themselves.
Harry cast for a far universe. He couldn’t be sure why because he had been sticking mostly close. But he thought he should see a far universe to know if his theory was correct. He had an inkling about the pattern all the universes formed.
"Technically legal. No one is pleased about the clause exempting cursed objects for heritage reasons.  But it would go elsewhere in MLE if it were less powerful and to the Department of Mysteries if it were more arcane. The making-a-bomb part is very illegal though and these are uncommonly powerful."
“He left me alone. Why would he leave me all alone?” She could barely speak.
Harry noted Marcus Flint had a lot of accounts the Revenue Service had traced illicit money with a double line linked to Gregory Goyle. They were evidently funding most of these ventures, circled in blue and green.
They meet again, for the first time in years, halfway around the world at a house party.
“Yes, I know smoking is a filthy habit. Stop looking at me like that. I'll get cancer and you'll be very upset,” Draco said, misreading Harry’s confusion. His accent had shifted a little, and he sounded like he spent more time speaking French than English these days.
“He regretted it every day of his life,” she said.
He had kept a single photo of them on his dresser, taken sometime around his fifth year at Hogwarts at some function. His father straightened Draco’s dress robes and smiled at him.
“Mr. Warbeck.” Draco inclined his head slightly, with his hands behind his back clasped firmly at the elbows. It was an old Pureblood gesture of respect, but he fell back on those manners when he had nothing else.
“You didn’t know I would say yes,” Harry said. Hermione, politely, did not say that they both knew he would do it regardless of the test run.
“Sorry,” Harry said. The apology only made Draco scowl more.
Harry sits up. Draco has donned his boxers but hasn't dressed. He can see Draco changing his mind as he crawls halfway up the bed to kiss Harry against the headboard. Harry is not nearly awake enough for this.
“Trainee Forrester, Trainee Malfoy, come round.” Healer Cummins called. Well, fuck. Now he was really in trouble. She never called anyone to give them a lollipop and a job well done. Maybe he’d forgotten something yesterday?
“Thank you for everything,” his mother said.
“Chike, this is Harry. We...we went to school together.” Draco stepped aside and Chike gasped.
“I had a headache,” Harry said.
“Patient should be sent to negative isolation,” Draco said aloud, half to himself.
Now he was standing in Draco's shop with an expensive present in his pocket. One that was meant to say, 'I'm sorry' and 'I was listening' and 'I've missed you'.
“Pansy would have an excellent commission off this place,” Harry counters.
“I’ll stand for both of you, obviously. Let’s keep your horrible cousins out of the mix, shall we?” Draco said.
“Fuck, that hurts,” Draco complained.The swelling went down immediately, but the feeling of his nose cartilage moving around was horrifying. This was not a good time, but he should probably apologize to Harry for doing this to him someday.
So, of all the inconvenient parts of being bonded several times, one of them is that apparently Harry's brain has begun to associate Draco’s close, sustained physical contact as interest. Nothing has changed. But now if Draco puts his arm across the back of Harry's chair, Harry pays attention.
“Good,” Harry said. She beamed. This encounter pierced the fog he had been in.
"You don't look at me like you want to tenderly dry hump my leg," Hermione said primly. "Or Ron. Or Luna. Or Neville."
“Was he like me?” said Harry. Draco shook his head no but didn’t elaborate.
Draco might have, Harry thought suddenly.
It was when Harry started working that he just wilted. Not under the pressure, but after realizing the job was less than he wanted. He liked some things: putting together pieces of information, asking questions to witnesses, recreating scenes of crimes and writing reports.
“Does being a Death Eater come with a pension this time around?” Draco asked between bites. Undercooked and burnt groats with no sugar. What a treat.
"How was I supposed to know?"
“I didn’t have a choice,” Draco said.
“Experimenting?” Kingsley said. He didn’t sound as skeptical as Harry would have thought as they gathered in the living room of the safehouse facing Athena’s chart.
“I need to—you don’t know me,” Draco said. Harry knew he was trying to be reasonable. “I don’t know you. We bonded over an experience no one else has. Think about this for a second.”
“No, if you stun a troll it bounces off their hide,” Draco said. “On that thought, I’ve never seen any protective spells that absorb spells. They mostly reflect them. There’s too many spells to cover otherwise.”
“I think in Egypt it was a phoenix. Some swans and peacocks. Very bird-heavy now that I think about it. I think it was a badger in the Regency world. I couldn’t produce one in many worlds, but I never stayed long in any world like that.”
But he couldn’t. When he arrived at the Three Broomsticks on Friday evening, Draco was already there, not touching his drink. It felt like greeting an ex-husband even though arguably nothing tied them together but a mad dash through a dozen universes, a schoolboy rivalry, a few kisses, and a handful of confidences. They sat in the front room, even though there were more private rooms.
“Could be nice,” Draco says.
Harry had a far more charmed life in comparison, but did Harry admire Draco in some small way because he wanted to be him? Or was it because Draco was devastatingly good-looking and he was a tiny bit attracted to him?
“Good?” Harry asks. Draco’s gaze is a bit unfocused when he opens his eyes and answers.
“Goyle. You should have owled. I was about headed to the hospital,” Draco lied.
“I’ve seen enough curses in my life, thanks,” Draco remarked. The recruiters from the industry associations came by every year with offers of free brooms, event tickets and shop credits which made him uncomfortable.
Harry dug up an old Prophet from a nearby pile of abandoned construction material. He couldn’t read anything but the words ‘General Bellatrix Lestrange’ and the same date he had left his home. He couldn’t imagine. It had been ten years. Ten more years of Voldemort’s rule here. That sent a chill through his body.
“Is Potions the running or the fucking in this metaphor?” Harry said.
Harry was still afraid Draco might decide he could never be happy here and leave in the night with the Firebirds. Harry had left them on the kitchen table, all three tangled together. It was almost a defiant thing, leaving it out in the open. But Harry was not Draco’s jailer, and he could leave at any time. Either with a Firebird or by walking straight out the front door.
"How are you finding the event?"
The Chief Warlock was Griselda Marchbanks, and he didn’t even have to look up to recognize her gravelly voice.
“Hi,” Harry said. His mouth went dry.
“He seems to know his way to the floo. This isn’t a hotel, Draco. He’s welcome to come as a guest and stay with you. He should eat,” she continued.
,” one of the hooded men said.
Penny was somewhere to his left. Zacharias shifted in the water somewhere behind him and Harry fought the urge to kick him. Even a muffling spell might tip off someone that they were there so he needed to stop moving.
At least, Harry thought Draco was frowning at him, but he could be frowning at the potion that was pouring plumes of marshmallow scented black smoke onto the floor before Draco contained it with a wave of his wand.
“You didn’t answer me,” Harry said.
“Canary, Pine, Navy let Crimson take point. Move to cover,” Kingsley said.
“Maddy is nothing like Teddy. Went straight from sitting to walking as if she thought all that crawling business was undignified,” Tonks said.
“Fine,” Harry said.
“Doing what?” Draco asked.
“Just a minute,” Draco called. Harry turned away from the counter to look through the aisles as if he had come in for an antique Bergère chair upholstered in blue velvet, with a pattern of gold stitching of leaves.
“Extended travel visa access and a better seat than the Americans at the next Wizarding Nations meeting hosted in Europe,” Hermione said. Draco snorted.
Draco was exhausted. Between Healer training, writing quick preliminary reports for the Task Force and seeing Harry, he barely caught his breath.
“I know it’s hard but you have to wait,” Ron continued.
“She slept with Parvati,” Draco murmurs in explanation for why she suddenly had to do her job at Padma’s brokerage. Harry gives a low whistle.
“You know that our marriage was arranged?” Draco nodded.
They locked eyes only briefly. Harry opened the door to Forwellsteads at the same time as Draco moved towards the door, a wary expression on his face.
Harry was not surprised to stroll into Malfoy’s Apothecary.
"Worth a shot," Draco says.
"Alright. Have I ever told you how I got recruited to the cause?”
Harry’s sheer stubbornness could be attractive even if he didn’t understand it.
“Fred, it sounds like Draco has volunteered to bring the liquor next week,” George said, clapping Draco on the shoulder.
Draco nodded as if everything she said was perfectly reasonable. He had given up on this point trying to calculate whether people were reacting to his history specifically, the general idea of him or something else. It would have driven him up a wall otherwise. The laws were clear enough. Had he not chosen a diversion program he wouldn’t even be eligible to apply. He had once employed that superior tone himself.
“But we were told it used to be a literal death wish. A gift from a Gaunt a century back to her mother-in-law,” Harry said.
“He had a funny way of showing it,” Draco said. He desperately wanted to stop the torrent of resentment because it seemed inappropriate, but it was picking up speed the more he thought about it. He thought he’d finished it during his emergency therapy appointment but resentment was a bottomless hungry thing.
She marches them to the third house with grim determination less than a day later. It’s rather average-looking two bed, two bath in Clapham. Modestly sized, warm maple floors, lots of daylight, galley kitchen. Harry can see himself in it, and when he looks over at Draco, he seems to like it.
“If you want the Firebirds, I’ll let you have both and tell them I woke up here without them,” Harry said. It was a gamble. Draco could disappear back into the universes. He was betting on something that he wasn't sure of.
A tall broad Healer said gently, “We'll need you to let go, won’t we?” Something about the way she spoke was soothing so he did let them float Draco, though he kept walking alongside. A Mediwitch joined. He told them as much information as he could remember, conscious he was babbling.
"You feel so good, Draco," Harry says. There's no hiding face to face. He picks up the tempo, gratified to see Draco arch his back more, push back harder.
Harry didn’t say that it wouldn’t have mattered who taught him. He had taught Hermione after all. He wanted to keep that part to himself. A small sign some of this had been real elsewhere and meant something.
“Well, you couldn’t travel to possibilities where you don’t exist,” she pointed out.
In some ways it's like fucking a stranger and Harry prefers it that way. There's no way he could stand this if everything came flooding back at the first tentative touch. Instead Draco fits against him differently, moves with no urgency. When they finally tumble into a bed, Harry can’t even bring himself to tell him it’s Michael’s. Not with Draco peering down at him, gaze dark and hot.
Lee Jordan had told him later. The lily was the symbol of safe havens for Muggleborns during the War.
“It would have been a lot to live up to, even if you didn’t ask her to,” Harry said softly.
If you taste an unfinished potion, you'll die unpleasantly.”
Even though the endearment was half-mocking, something warm and steady sparked in his chest. Harry watched him once again.
Draco was sure his face was flaming Weasley red. He didn’t expect to be made an object lesson for their morning huddle. All he tried to do was keep his head down and qualify.
“Felix Felicis?” Harry said.
"And you couldn't have said anything? Three months Draco. I thought I did something."
“At least that boy didn’t take after Lucius,” His mum said in a slightly disapproving tone. Subtler than Molly Weasley, but there nonetheless. It was surreal to have any insight into her personality. His parents could be something other than a collection of other people’s memories. His throat closed. He wanted to stay. He wanted to stay so badly.
He closes the window when enough air has rushed in to make it feel less stuffy. His trunk and closet should be empty, but he checks both, just in case he missed something.
“But it didn’t sound like nonsense. I mean, he’s changed but Greg was never...Greg was a pretty literal thinker when I knew him. He doesn’t have flights of fancy. If he says it, he believes it. And he didn’t strike me as delusional.”
“What else is possible?” Harry asked. He had half reclined and it seemed only manners had prevented Draco from clambering onto his lap. He got one heated look for his trouble.
Draco looked directly at Griselda Marchbanks for the first time. Her eyes were kinder than he expected and she paused as if waiting for him to speak. His mind whirled with the possibilities that diversion could mean. What was so bad they would forgo Azkaban for it? He wished he had taken that pre-trial meeting with the public defender. It didn’t matter.
Draco was studying for one of his mid-term exams for this year in the solar, when the owl came from the Ministry directly to his mother. She was taking afternoon tea with him before going back out to the garden. As the brown Ministry owl swooped in through the open window, Draco had thought for a second Harry might have written him from work instead of using his owl Gideon. But then his mother read the letter first and sat right back down in her chair. Draco grabbed it from her hands and began scanning:
Well, then. That made sense to an extent. If Hermione was with Draco, Ron would have to be with someone else. But he would have imagined someone like Katie Bell or Lavender Brown. Maybe someone more nurturing and indulgent. No matter what world they were in, that wasn’t describing Pansy Parkinson.
Harry shook his head.
He had this argument with his friends in reverse when he bought his cottage. All his friends had tried to get him to be closer to them in the summer. They had wanted him to move closer to wizarding communities, or in a bigger city at least. Not because you couldn’t apparate or Floo, but because it was harder to do impromptu dinners or casual hangouts—out of sight, out of mind.
Hermione cleared her throat, and they both sat up.
“I didn’t know visualizing your magic would make you shed glitter, Harry,” Hermione said.
There wasn’t much fanfare the day the Ministry finally allowed him to go home.
“Wait! Don’t jump, it’s already unstable!” But Draco pulled the wing back and went blank behind the eyes.
“The lab is unstable!” Draco calls to Harry, who is sprinting toward the fire. Draco knows Harry is reckless. He has shown that more than enough times in Auror training. Even now years later, as a Senior Auror, Harry is often the first into an active situation.
It seemed hard for him to speak and Draco had white bandages wound around his chest. He gestured for Harry to come closer again until he was pressed against the railing. Harry went to kiss him on the forehead and Draco tilted his head last minute so he caught his lips. Harry tried to keep it gentle but there was a tinge of desperation in making sure Draco was alive and knew how he felt and was here. Draco tasted like awful potions and Harry did not care.
Every day he walked the half hour from his flat to the bookshop because he was honestly frightened of all the people he saw milling into the Underground station. He hadn’t realized how many of them there were.
Harry tapped twice and suddenly it was colour-coded: green for cashflow, yellow for research, red for operations, blue for trading.
Draco pulls his hand out of Harry’s only to be hit with a wave of pain so severe it feels like someone is trying to scoop out most of his internal organs with a blunt pickaxe. He gasps and Harry jolts awake too, holding his head.
“I couldn’t tell what was real.”
Harry didn’t know what to say to that, so he kissed him until Draco relaxed, breathing evenly.
Draco needn’t have bothered, but Harry didn’t want to startle him.
“I can’t believe you proposed,” Draco said for the third time. He could tell Harry thought this was rude to Pansy by the sharp kick he got under the table.
“You’ll have to tell me,” Draco said, quietly.
Draco has woken up in St Mungo’s often enough that he is not immediately alarmed by the flat grey walls of the Auror’s Ward. But as he shifts he realizes that his hand is firmly being held by Harry. He turns to find that the Healers have pushed together two hospital beds and lowered the guardrails. Harry is asleep.
Harry looked at them all as if they were speaking Swedish. It must seem strange to him, but that Theo even mentioned his mum meant he was firmly one of theirs now.
“It has,” Harry agreed. When he turned his attention to Draco he realized why. Where Hermione and Draco clasped hands here, they wore matching silver wedding bands. Without him, his stomach lurched at the idea.
“So how are you, Unspeakable Potter? What are you brooding over today? Is it the fate of the universe or climate change?”
This time when he jumped back in, Harry found himself waiting out front of an old Wizarding castle in Kent that was often used for events. Cameras flashed and Harry tried to blink away the splotches of colour in his vision.
"I didn't need any more reminders," Draco answered honestly.
“Love you too,” Draco said.
“Pansexual is fine for me, too,” Theo said, his back still turned to them both.
The floor had opened in the middle and tilted like Tower Bridge. Harry edged towards the middle where he could see nothing but a dark hole of indeterminate depth. Harry kicked a pebble over the edge. It was longer than he liked before he heard it hit the ground. Then he spotted something out of the corner of his eye.
“Isn’t that the reason for all this? Aren’t you getting to know me?” Draco said.
“Okay,” Draco said. Harry could see him accepting even if he wanted to argue.
On the kitchen table, Hermione had left a note wishing him luck. He activated the security protocol she set up with his wand as instructed. He stowed his wand in a locking drawer and checked his Floo was still closed.
“You bastard!” Pansy lunged for him and Draco waited until the last minute to dodge and then slung her over his shoulder.
With overwhelming pride, Draco flashed a little wallet photo of that same blond, chubby-faced boy Harry had seen. Scorpius grinned and waved. "We went to Brighton this week." Harry had never thought about Draco much, but he had especially never thought about what he’d be like as a father. Draco seemed good at it. Harry wondered if he was any good at being a dad.
“And a bad friend,” Draco added, petulantly. So they were friends here. Harry didn’t know how to process that. Their kids were friends, and he supposed it must be hard to come by other parent friends when most people his age didn’t have any.
“I need to get the sand out of my gear,” Draco said to Bill, once they finished their report.
“An antler chandelier in the bedroom.” Draco makes a sound of faint disgust.
“They can’t suspect anything, you understand,” Draco said intensely, staring at Harry.
They didn't make it to dinner or to Astoria's party that night. But Harry didn't stay the night either like he had before. He didn't wait for Draco to wake up and tell him about which repairs he was doing in his shop and what he was hoping to find at auction from Gringotts. He didn't stay to tell him in halting words how it felt when they finally put the Mediwizard badge on his robes. He didn’t know how to share this, because he didn’t know how to parse it.
“What do you want from me, Greg?” Draco said. He was scared, yes, but he was also running out of the little patience he had. They might have once been friends, but he didn't want to listen to this speech. It was no doubt connected to what Harry was doing, but he was not an Auror and he didn’t know how to question anyone. If Greg had any hint he had been involved in their operation, he would probably be dead.
“Can you still do the....” Draco says. Harry uses an unnecessary flourish and his magic scrapes hot over Draco’s body with something extra along with the requisite spells and lube.
“You can get it some other time,” Greg said. “Where’s the parlour gone?”
It was to date, the first time he thought Draco had ever said his name. Probably a habit from too many lives Draco had jumped through. Harry could tell his Firebird was still hot as Draco gripped it. Harry reached for him.
Harry barely heard anything Sirius said. He just looked at him. Fuck, that twisted up everything in his chest. He understood for the first time why Draco had gone to such lengths. It was like the Mirror of the Erised but worse. He could feel this. He could hold this.
Curiosity plays over Draco’s features. Draco’s eyes flick to his mouth and then up. Harry would bet all the gold in his vault that Draco is wondering the same thing he is. Is this part as good as Harry remembers or had he allowed their attraction to become overblown with nostalgia?
He hit all three in rapid succession with a Bodybind which they shook off. He followed up with a nasty fire hex which hit. Whatever shielding they had wasn’t perfect. He cast thick ropes to bind them. For good measure, he melted the asphalt slightly until they all sank at least three inches.
“No. I’m not sorry about us,” Draco says. “But I’m not sorry about leaving either.”
“How was your visit home?” Draco asked idly, flicking through the rest of the paper.
“How fortunate you find yourself in a shop,” Draco said with a broad sarcastic sweep of an arm. Harry bit back an explanation for his disappearance, though it made him feel off-kilter.
“Yes, sir. I will take leave. Thank you sir,” Harry said. The second sir was probably overkill.
All in all, it’s time for a new place. The idea of living with Draco is more appealing than it is terrifying.
“We need your expertise, Healer Malfoy. Let’s go to your room,” Pansy said, taking his hand. She offered him a reassuring squeeze.
“First, I wanted to see who else I could have become,” Draco said. “Then it was...I don’t think you’d understand. It was only Theo left. Everyone else I knew has left or died. I was tired of being alone.”
“Were you involved?” Harry asked quietly.
He could live here happily, Harry thought.
It didn’t feel like it was for the best.
“I’ve caught half your year trying to shag each other in break rooms. Some kissing won’t kill me. I have three kids. I’ve done it myself,” she said. Something about the gruffness in her tone sounded like affection.
His expression was placid. No light of zealotry had been lit recently. This was simply who Greg had chosen to become, Draco realized.
“You must want
They spot the same shadowy movements in a smudged and cracked window from the ground below. Even before the building had been half-engulfed in flames, it was a flimsy thing, made of a stack of shoddily Transfigured shipping containers in this forsaken industrial park in Manchester. Harry is looking at him with a question, and despite his recklessness Draco knows Harry won’t go ahead without him.
“Let’s have dinner next week maybe and catch up?” Harry offered. Draco gaped. Hermione frowned.
“It’s...it’s always nice to see you and Hermione. I’m not as much of an intellectual as you two,” Harry said, poking fun at himself. Draco frowned.
“Actually, I’ve spoken to her supervisor and the Department Head.” Here, at least, Kingsley had the modesty to look a little guilty over using his privilege that way.
“I’ll show you something wonderful. Everyone will be jealous that I sold a house to Harry Potter. I’ll keep my job. Everyone wins!” Pansy says when they approach her about it at a Sunday lunch.
“This is for you.” Harry opened the box to reveal a battered gold ring with an inscription that said ‘in joy’. It had been difficult to track down; it was still gorgeous as the day Harry found it. He immediately understood the moment he found it why the weight of history made this antique ring more beautiful than anything he could have bought new. Draco gave in immediately, bringing out a jeweler's loupe to look more closely.
“Yeah. Sorry. How are you?”
At present in Grimmauld Place’s kitchen, Draco was examining a strange necklace under protective spells that may or may not have anything to do with a rash of vandalism. Harry was standing and eating because Draco had taken up the entire table.  Harry was shovelling food in his mouth at a ground speed only previously recorded with Ronald Weasley during a Halloween feast.
“I do not know whether I’m thankful or deeply regret becoming an Unspeakable,” Draco said finally.
“Did you find what you wanted?” Harry said.
“Your opinion, Meadowes?” Zacharias managed.
"You're right," Harry crawled down his body without ceremony, pulled down his boxers and went to work figuring out exactly how to take him apart with his mouth. Harry gave one tentative lick from base to tip. Draco didn't react until he got near the tip then he groaned. Okay, so Draco liked that. Harry returned, applying a bit more suction in earnest.
The floors are still a warm maple, with a scorch mark where he’d dropped a candle while reading at night. The wood matches the shelves all lined up with Hogwarts textbooks and the writing desk that had been a replica of his grandfather’s. Draco leans over his desk to open the window and it glides open like it has been waiting for his return. He can see even more of the wildness of the land from this vantage point. Yellow and brown have overtaken everything; it is all dead or dying.
Narcissa Malfoy greeted him with kisses on his cheeks at the front steps of the Manor. They had always been an affectionate family, but that was privately. Gabriel was standing in the pathway. He was a little uncomfortable with how she seemed to have changed. She was tan for their colouring. Her hair had gone white, there were lines in her face that were new and ones she wasn’t bothering to glamour.
“No, you don’t understand. I’m not talking about arithmancy." Harry hesitated then decided to go ahead.
“It’s a perfectly fine house in a reasonable price range,” Draco protests.
And if he looked
Draco nodded.
Sometimes the house would shift the way Wizarding buildings did. It would seem to take and hold a breath, with the shutters flung open and the hallways bright. And Harry would wonder if he was dreaming then, too. It made him feel like the entire house was only anchored to this universe but for the grace of Merlin. Nothing felt real anymore.
“There aren’t any balancing runes, why the fuck would someone do that? Feed it a thimbleful of magic and you’re liable to blow your own face off.”
“I’m not a hero, Potter,” Draco sneered.
“Hope you don’t mind but I needed the sleep,” Andromeda said, coming downstairs from her nap. “Teddy’s missed you.”
Draco had been offered a floo directly into the Headmaster’s quarters but that seemed like too much to deal with all things considering. Instead, he apparated into Hogsmeade and walked across the fields and towards the castle.
“Someone engineered you in a lab to drive me spare,” Draco said. “Bed. Now.”
“What happened?” Harry asked again. Clearly he wasn’t going to relent.
When he took the Firebird in hand again, it was with determination. One more for today. He didn’t want to search in any far universes at the moment. That had been too unfamiliar. Too much. The proximity charm meant Malfoy had been there at some point, but he couldn’t have stayed long.
“Er....”
Bill...Weasley? Well, that made slightly more sense as to why Harry had apparently picked the surface of the sun to inhabit. He couldn’t say he’d never considered Cursebreaking, but in the same way he’d considered being a Quidditch star: as an idle fantasy right after the War.
“I didn’t say that you couldn’t do anything,” Draco said. He sounded a little disappointed as if he’d expected Harry to bring himself off in front of him. Harry had some self-control, but not a lot. There was a line of thought that would go nowhere helpful.
“I think it’s getting too hot. Ron, why don’t you give Rosie to Harry and Draco and they can go indoors? It’s starting to feel like the south of Spain out here,” Hermione said.
He passed one other person, an elderly Black witch who shuffled past slowly, heading back to Diagon. Her eyes flicked up to his scar and then to his face. “This area is no good. Be careful, sweetie,” she called. Harry nodded. Before he’d thought it was because he looked young and these strangers didn’t know who he was. Now, he took it as a small acknowledgment of kinship.
“You want to be cleared to go back, Harry.  That’s understandable. But you told me you were very disappointed and unhappy there. So why?”
“Yes, I think we’ve met before,” Draco says smoothly. He has to lean forward to be heard over the music.
"Burns differently in your forties," Remus said, sticking his tongue out in disgust. Tonks laughed, her face flushed red.
Harry and Zacharias stared each other down and then Harry claimed a desk in the living room. Penny claimed the desk beside him, which left the dining room set up for Athena and Zacharias.
"Do I what?" Harry asks. He doesn't want to misstep by assuming Draco's asking what Harry thinks he's asking.
“If you didn’t come back for your parents’ funeral, I could hardly expect you to come back for me.” A careless remark, that cuts Draco visibly. Harry regrets the hurt the instant it appears in the clench of Draco’s jaw, the too-hard grip of his pint glass. Harry tries to backtrack.
It was drizzling heavily as Harry made his way through Edmonton Green, ducking from shop to shop. He had forgotten his umbrella and raincoat. The streets were crowded enough on a Tuesday afternoon that he couldn’t just Apparate out of there. His toes squelched horribly in his trainers and he idly fantasized about throwing them out to walk barefoot.
Pansy raised one perfect eyebrow at Draco and mouthed ‘Durmstrang fourth year’. It had been the first time he drank grain alcohol and he had been kissed by some boy named Ivan, immediately thrown up over the side of Durmstrang’s boat and cried inconsolably for an hour in the field while Pansy rubbed his back. Pansy had been sworn to secrecy.
“There’s nothing to be nervous about,” Harry reassured Draco. Harry could see him fussing and retying his bowtie for the third time.
“But she joined the Task Force. ” Harry asked.
Harry didn’t think he had ever seen Draco eat before and he tried to focus on his own food but it was like dining with the Queen. Harry was trying to follow his advice about eating slower.
. Draco tasted good, he tasted right, sliding his mouth over his. It had been so long since he felt even a shadow of this desire for someone. This felt specific; it couldn’t have been about anyone.
Then he laid on the ground in Harry's makeshift workshop, sweating profusely. Harry eyed a wood joint on the crib to see if it was perfectly flush. Harry was very excited about the project. A week ago they’d gone all the way to South Glamorgan to pick the right planks.
“I don’t stock any hangover potion in this house,” Molly warned, as she bustled past.
It was dark and the space was small and he was trapped and they were going to—no. Draco shook his head. He felt around the room he was in blindly. It was a room and not a cupboard. If he kept his breathing deep and even, the fabric on his head wasn’t so bad. They might hurt him but they were giving him time. Time meant he could think.
“This is an estate, not a house. And it's too expensive.” That's not really a problem for Harry despite cycling through new careers every few years. He shrugs.
“Thank you for bringing him back, Gabe. I appreciate it,” His mother said warmly. They must know each other. Had she been checking on him? He turned to her with a question, but she merely beamed at Gabriel.
It was quiet for a few seconds, the air filled with the sound of Draco’s heavy breathing. Then without warning the floor shifted hard, throwing them towards the left wall. Harry threw up a shield charm before they both crashed into it. This entire area seemed delicate and Harry didn’t want them touching anything unnecessarily.
"There are universities there, I've heard," Draco says.
“Fuck,” Draco says, stunned.
Harry almost couldn’t meet her eyes. She hadn’t talked about it like most of her work, but she had taken Theodore Nott’s loss hard a few months back. The rumour had been that he had vanished into thin air, but no one outside of Mysteries knew for certain.
“You’re brilliant. I—I can’t say anything but you’re brilliant,” Harry kissed him once excitedly and ran downstairs without him. Draco started after him when he bumped into his mother.
“I’m just glad you’re taking some time away,” Neville said. Harry laughed to himself later. It wasn’t going to be much of a vacation.
“Malfoy, you’re not getting off scot-free, but you do now have more information than the rest of the department on this project so I’d like you to share it.”
That night he fell asleep quickly.
“I can try to get closer,” Zacharias whispered. The charm made it sound like he was speaking directly in Harry’s ear and he hated it.
“Seeing the best of him isn’t the same thing as seeing someone. He’s made different choices here. Maybe he’s worried about what you will think of him?”
“Fuck, that was so good,” Harry slurred. Draco dropped beside him, breathing heavily.
He looked down at his own robes. Slightly too short in the sleeve, and his borrowed overcoat that was for Lucius’ slimmer build. It had been stubbornly resistant to alteration charms but he should have bought a brand new one. Pansy would have murdered him if she saw this outfit.
“You’ll get some cues. There’s a sort of sense-memory held in the body. If not, pretend,” Hermione said quickly.
Draco had packed three boxes of books, the best of his clothes, his paintings and his beloved french press, the only muggle way he’d found to get a decent cup without paying for it. Draco shouldn’t really miss anything. It was all still there for him: the British Museum, hiking at Hampstead, the Underground, his local pub, the good Tescos further away and the bad Asda around the corner and muggle lemon drops. But they would never again feel like his.
So maybe he was in training, and he was behind all his peers as far as a career. Most pureblood children didn’t even move out until marriage.
Thank you so much for reading. I appreciate it.
“You used to say you regretted introducing us again,” Draco said. He said it with a light laugh. Harry opted not to answer that for a moment by taking a large swig of champagne.
He knew two things. First, it made the most sense to try in every universe to find Draco and speak to him in case it gave him more clues. Second, there was something very deliberate in the choosing. Draco was searching for something or someone.
Draco hesitated before answering.
“Come here,” Harry muttered. Harry pulled Draco into his lap and looked up at him, waiting for permission. Harry wasn’t shy about kissing so it wasn’t kissing he wanted.
Draco had heard rumours that the Muggles Harry was related to weren’t great, but he’d assumed that had been a combination of exaggerations to make Harry Potter seem even more heroic and simple anti-Muggle prejudice.
“Porridge again?” he said to the woman guarding him during his third meal. “Any jam?”
Harry didn’t expect anyone to be around when he came by early to finish reports. The master bedroom was closed and he could hear Athena and Kingsley arguing. Not like how everyone argued with one another, but it was startling and loud. It seemed personal. Harry was trying to figure out how to make himself known.
“We don’t know,” Healer Tadenik replies. “We think...”
“Maybe,” Harry said. Ron shook his head once as he realized he was giving him relationship advice about Draco.
“All of the appliances are antiques and original to the home!” Pansy says.
"Harry," Draco says, sounding a little helpless. His name in Draco's mouth feels so right. Harry is fucked and he knows it but Draco is asking for more so Harry slings Draco's leg higher and presses deeper until Draco chants his name over and over. Draco reaches for his neglected cock, heavy and hard against his stomach. Harry pushes his hands away and wraps his hand around Draco's cock.
He recovered in time to say, "Yes. Reducing hospitalization would mean fewer deaths."
“Close your mouth if you’re going to stare,” Draco said, not looking up from his book.
“What?" Harry says.
“Can’t the prosecutors do this part?” Draco asked after explaining another spell proof so Harry could do it in the kitchen of Grimmauld. Harry wasn’t good at them, but he would redo it until it was correct even if each one took him an hour. Draco might have given up if it was that difficult, but Harry refused to let him do them in case it compromised the investigation.
“But it’s not ours to live in, Draco. You know that.” If they remembered that, they couldn’t continue. Harry understood more than anyone else could, but they had stolen seconds, minutes and hours from themselves in these worlds. It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t a good thing. And Harry felt that deeply, even if he wanted to stay here too.
Harry knew he hadn't missed Ginny the way he should. He felt her absence in being alone at home more than he thought about her.
“Does it have to be you that gets him?” Harry asked.
“Hold that thought and we’ll be right back!” Hermione grabbed Harry’s hand and walked them to the hallway where the loos were.
“They exist in a liminal space outside of time,” Hermione said.
He had bought all his partners fairy silk robes and brand new Quidditch jerseys and woven shorts without holes in them. The ones when he was really trying: Ginny, Roger, Keltie, Francis, Quinn. He had talked around his quirks—a polite euphemism for the collection of habits and beliefs he had adopted to survive. Except now it was clear to everyone else he had survived, but Harry carried on as he might not.
“Children should be spoiled, Harry.” Draco continued, oblivious. Harry put his hand over Draco’s right at the kitchen table.
"Why would anyone be to blame?" Harry says. "There's a new place down the road I'd like to try tomorrow morning."
“Should I stay behind when they find him?” Harry asked.
“Is that still the case?” Harry asked. He wished that Draco had just said that instead of claiming they knew nothing about each other. Without a question, Harry would stay away if it was important for Draco’s wellbeing.
“Magical maladies specialist, remember? I wouldn’t be a very good flatmate if I didn’t at least check,” Draco said. “You should lie down.”
"I know. I know. But Robards suspected something with the medical clearances. And if we wanted to keep clear of the fraternization rules, it can't look like this started while we were partners.”
"I don't advise—"
Sometimes Harry got it in his head to ask questions though he could tell they pained Draco to answer. But it was a way to fill the morning, afternoons and evenings besides long walks in Muggle London. There was both too much time with nothing to do, and too little as the clock ticked closer and closer to August 15.
No. If the Malfoy family and all the other purebloods had been more invested in fairness than pride, perhaps it would have remained his home. As it was, it could stand as a monument to them all. This is a place where evil was done. There is no glory in it, just rot and ruin.
“I’ll apparate you home,” Penny said. She was kind and firm in steering him to their apparition point behind the building and even more so as they landed on the doorstep of 12 Grimmauld Place. Penny cast a Patronus—a dove—that rushed down the street.
Draco puzzled over his National Art Pass and why on earth something like that would be in his package when a wizard walked in. He was tall, taller than Draco even, deep tawny skin, short curly hair, hazel eyes and...handsome he realized belatedly, in a way that made Draco uncomfortable because it was so foreign to him. His mouth went dry. The wizard looked familiar, Draco just couldn’t place him.
There were other things to occupy him anyway: Harry's apprenticeship with Ollivander, trying to get his parents to believe that he was actually bisexual and not just too shy to tell them he was gay despite their acquaintance with one Remus Lupin, whether Puddlemere would take the Cup, why Draco always finished the milk but never went to Tesco on his way home, whether Neville was actually okay or just faking it, and when he would feel like a real adult.
"Take it easy, boys," Arthur said.
“Harry,” Malfoy greeted him warmly. “You’ve been dodging our owls.”
Harry absorbed that information. As trainees, his cohort had spent a lot of time arresting fleeing Death Eaters across the continent with the European Wizarding Commission. If Kingsley was worried with as much information as he must have access to...
“Can you tell me where I can apparate from?” Harry says.
“Look, I know the Gaunts were Dark zealots since time immemorial. I have no doubt that the necklace was once cursed but I can’t feel a cursebreaker’s signature on this. Putting it on wouldn’t even give you a headache,” Draco explained.
"I thought she would marry me, you know," Harry said after they had stumbled home. It was three in the morning and he was on the melancholy side of drunk, having gradually gotten more sober at the chippy.
"You and I both know that making people beg for money is a favourite pastime of purebloods," Draco whispered back.
In his world, every time they went to functions they rated the food like they were on one of Hermione’s favourite cooking shows. Nothing had cracked a five out of ten in years. It made Harry happy they still had that even if they wouldn’t go looking for food afterward. As if she had caught herself, her smile slipped off her face and she turned to Draco.
“Why, Trainee Malfoy? Have we run out of MHS funds this early in the quarter?” Healer Cummins said, heavy and sarcastic. More laughter.
Hermione tossed him her Firebird.
"You didn't. But I thought it wasn’t serious for you before the last time. Dedicated to work."
“Sounds ethically dubious to do that to someone.”
“It’s a pain in the arse is what it is. Come on,” Draco said.
Harry has a routine. Tourist traps mean straightforward menus and an understanding he is going to order in English and no one will mind. Not that anyone had seemed to mind so far.
Draco firecalled Melinda the day after.
He flopped onto his bed and Harry followed, sitting by his feet. Harry made a go-on gesture.
“I think she would be happy about it.”
No one seems to want to talk about the invocation of self in defensive magic or why some magic can only be shown and not written. Harry has interesting things to say about that. He’s presenting a paper on it this weekend and everything.
"Ah..." Healer Ahmed waits a long moment before saying, "I don't advise it, but if you were to consummate the bond, it would still be reversible."
They ate a severely under-seasoned chicken breast with a salty brown sauce and boiled veg. Harry caught Hermione’s eye and they both made a face. She tapped two fingers of her glass and gave him a tiny knowing smile.
Kingsley wrote him that they would be working out of a safehouse from here on out and he only managed to memorize the address before the note disintegrated in his hands in a puff of purple smoke. He was more comfortable in Muggle clothes, and wore a pair of jeans, Nikes and a plain black t-shirt to blend in with the crowds.
“I want to see where it goes,” Harry said.
“Everything there costs an arm and leg. D’you know that’s how Alastor lost his leg? London real estate,” his father continued, winking outrageously.
“They said I’m like you,” Teddy said, barely above a whisper. Harry was confused, what about him would strange muggle children know? Then it hit him.
Harry watched little Teddy curled up, his hair a splash of bright blue.
He glared at every single one of them in turn. Harry felt chastised even though he had listened to Kingsley. Penny met his eyes and looked away. Athena met his eyes, too.
"Should I be worried about that?" Harry asked.
“More,” Harry insisted.
There are two codas I've written in the series. I've reordered them, so the first is an epilogue and the third is Pansy/Theo.
“You keep talking to Indie and her brother will beat you up!” A group of boys had yelled another morning. They shoved each other around for a second and proceeded to their school. Their conversations were so...ordinary. It surprised him.
The last log collapsed into the pyre with a spray of sparks. Draco wiped the few tears that had slipped out.
“I know the difference between our reality and those other ones. I know you are not them,” Harry said.
“Who taught you?” Draco asked breathlessly.
“I’m not Auror anymore,” Harry said, to no effect.
They travelled  in a private floo to a flat. His flat, presumably. Plain, lots of dingy linoleum and beige curtains, very muggle. His living room had a couch and some electronic box. No art. No carpet. His kitchen had one pot, one pan, and a gas stove that probably did not have a self-lighting spell. Not that he could cook.
Every single day Draco sweated hauling boxes of books up and down the stairs, reading the front pages for basic information, then sorting them in sections. He was unfamiliar with all of them. He had never, to his knowledge, read a Muggle book at all. Sometimes when he finished a particularly grueling task, he’d sit behind the counter and read passages at random until Eustace caught him.
"See you," Harry said. Those were the last words they had said to each other.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I wish that both of you could have...” Narcissa trailed off, watching the flames dance.
He had kissed Draco slow and reverent once they stumbled into the foyer of Grimmauld Place. Kissed him all the ways he knew how, then trailed smaller presses of his lips against Draco’s cheek, his neck, the solidness of his sternum. His hands had wandered, thumbs in the dip of his back, fingers spread. Draco had let out a long sigh. At the time it felt like surrender, but in retrospect it could have been relief.
“Yeah. Yeah. I’ve got you.” They both carefully laid flat, with Harry wrapping his arms around Draco’s calves. Draco’s chest was hanging over the edge and remembering how deep the chasm went, Harry tightened his grip.
“Sometimes I think they didn’t bother teaching us anything important about ourselves.”
His Floo activated and Ron came out first, followed by Hermione. Ron reached out to let her steady. Hermione looked a little off-colour. She was larger every time he saw her and he was surprised there was a whole month to go before she gave birth.
“What was he then?”
Draco sighed. “Theo won’t come back with anyone else.”
And while it was awkward the first few times they all did seem to like Draco fine. Maybe it helped that they’d gone to Draco’s old pub, where he knew the muggle bartenders and they teased him about tipping too much like always.
“I’ll walk him to the Tube station and get lunch,” he said to his coworkers. They both nodded. There was something surreal about watching Draco don a raincoat and grab a black umbrella.
“I’ll think about it,” Harry said.
“The only thing we ever do, Harry. We carry on, best we can,” Kingsley said.
“Pull the other one. What is it? You're not happy,” Draco said. His voice sounded worried.
Hermione was good enough to hide her secret triumph.
“Promise you won’t die on this ridiculous Task Force and you’ll find out,” Draco said.
The only room he doesn’t check is his parents, mostly because he hadn’t been allowed in their wing of the Manor unless it was an emergency when he was a child, and he had never got to be an adult here.
“Simply put: Theo managed to slip out of every reality, and that’s very bad. And he needs to come back here and he’s stuck right now,” Hermione had tried explaining. “We have to go get him soon when the time is right.”
Narcissa Malfoy was wearing brand new velvet robes, perfume under-laced with the subtle scent of Pepper-Up Potion, a decent makeup glamour and hair in elaborate braids forming a crown. Her face was unreadable until she saw him. Every lesson she had ever taught him echoed in Draco’s head: never leave the house without looking presentable, back straight and chin high, and guard your feelings closely.
“You two make enough money to stop drinking this fucking swill,” Draco said to the twins. Draco shook his head, making a face.
“I’m sorry Harry but it won’t be safe. If you go to Grimmauld, I’ve secured it to contain the magical activity.”
Inside, at least, the cottage was cozy. It wasn’t until Ron pointed it out during his last visit that he realized it kind of looked like the Gryffindor common room with overstuffed sofas, macrame hangings and plush red carpeting. Oh well.
"That's so—" Harry moans so loudly he is embarrassed. Harry tries to focus on the smaller details: the weight of Draco’s arm pinning his hips, the warmth of his other hand rubbing soothing circles on his upper thigh. Draco continues to suck him off efficiently until Harry grips his shoulder too hard.
“I didn’t say I'm an innocent, Harry,” Draco said in between bites to the column of his neck. The biting and his voice were making Harry feel shivery, out of control and good. “It’s a lot right now. I’ve been out of this body for months. Doesn’t feel right.”
“Is this your flat?” Harry asked.
Harry led him to the sitting room and sat down beside him on the loveseat, facing him.
And Merlin, Draco’s hands were everywhere. They pulled at his hair, took off his jacket and slid up his back. It was Harry who broke their kiss to mouth around Draco’s jaw, to taste the salt on his skin. Harry allowed himself a few precious seconds longer so he wouldn’t startle Draco and then pulled away to find out where he was. He felt guilty that he had let himself get carried away.
“I didn’t think it was?” Harry answered.
"If you'll excuse me," Yannick said. And they were left side by side, sipping champagne in silence until the next potential donor came by.
He doesn’t know the neighbourhoods or what they signify. Someone names a bar in the middle of a story and a chorus of voices jump in to complain about fucking tourists. Harry is a bit self-conscious because he is a tourist. Although he’s never chundered in an aisle of Jean Coutu, their equivalent of Boots, as someone does in another story. The griping about their Ministry goes over his head. He’s aware of McGill because it’s their Faculty of Magic that’s hosting the conference. The Wizarding World doesn’t seem cut so sharply from the muggle one here. They use the same money, frequent the same shops, go to the same universities.
There was so much to celebrate when you were allowed to. So many occasions to be marked with lopsided cakes with burnt sugar icing and terrible dancing and sleepy conversations lingering by the Floo for just a few more minutes.
“That sounds good for you. I didn’t think the Aurors would have been a good fit,” Draco says. That's a more delicate way of putting it than Draco had put it back then, which was something like, “I think it speaks poorly of the institution that a third of the Aurors went to Azkaban for war crimes and another half joined a vigilante group to stop them, but what do I know? I’m a Death Eater.”
After Ginny dumped him, Harry found out that living with your ex after you've broken up might be generous but it was also a good way to make yourself miserable. Draco had offered his place, then they were flatmates and before they knew it, several years had passed. Harry and Draco were friends. At least, that’s what Harry tried to remind himself on a regular basis. Friendship. Platonic friendship.
“Why?” Harry asks.
Harry forgot sometimes it would have been so much more time for Draco. Days maybe, weeks. He seemed to have spent more time lingering, revisiting, recircling worlds. Harry didn’t often ask these days, but Draco knew more about their other lives and had felt them deeply.
“In plain English, Hermione,” Harry said.
“Not at all. I should come by more often,” Harry said.
If his mother noticed a man had asked him out, she said nothing. Nor did she say anything about Draco’s haircut when her eyes had flicked upwards, although Draco had clearly gone to a Muggle barber and said 'give me the gayest haircut you have' and the barber obliged.
“That would be...” Hermione said.
Embarrassingly, Harry had idly wondered why she worked in Special Crimes if she seemed so fragile. Penny sat him down, made a cup of tea splashed with whiskey and waited with him. She was silent, but it was a warm comfortable silence while Harry kept having to remember he was anchored in a human body. She had a resilient, flexible strength he had mistaken for weakness.
“Let me do the counter-curse this time,” Draco said. Harry wasn’t going to argue, and he gestured to Draco to go ahead. Draco turned around.
“Would you like to hold her instead?” Draco asked Molly. Harry knew it would be a hard sell for Molly to like him even if she tolerated him for Harry’s sake.
The Draco he'd seen around the Ministry was quiet and kept to himself. He ate in the Ministry canteen. No one ate in the canteen. Harry hardly saw him in Wizarding London except for work and formal events. He gave off the same unsettling aura as the other Unspeakables, but even Harry didn’t think he’d been biding his time to do something nefarious. He was probably still a right bastard, but Harry had looked evil in the face plenty enough to know the difference.
Ron had never joined after finishing Auror training. It would be another six years before his trainee license would expire. But once Ron had started working at Weasleys’ Wizarding Wheezes and expanded their franchises, Harry got the feeling Ron would probably never return. Ron seemed to enjoy retail real estate, stock logistics and wizarding freight shipping  more than he had ever liked catching Dark wizards on the run.
“Don’t forget my sticky buns. Rose glaze,” Harry reminded her.
“What changed then?”
“I assume if it’s in your house, you’ll eat it.”
. You must be able to work together with
Harry got up and scrambled around, spreading the splotches of blood around. Unsanitary. He got a glimpse of the stains all over Harry’s knees and forearm.
"Draco—"
Draco didn’t miss her use of his first name. If Harry wasn’t careful, she would start giving him investment tips. Draco kissed the side of Harry’s mouth. He was happy.
“I’m not an Auror anymore,” Harry reminded both of them. He had wanted to see the back of missions forever.
Harry could guess at what happened here. He started all his relationships with a friendship. But then he would have introduced them again at a party or something. Hermione would have only agreed if Harry vouched for him, he thought. Harry was not good with feelings, even his own. He wouldn’t have recognized what it meant when his chest tightened when he saw them together. By the time he would have noticed them circling each other, it would have been too late.
Ron took him out for a drink to let Hermione take a nap in their empty flat after work. It turned into four or seven drinks. First, they circled around the usual topics: work, Quidditch, where each Weasley was.
“I didn’t mean it,” Teddy said. “They keep calling me...”
Draco hops down from the counter to fold her into his arms.“None of that,” he says sternly, but it’s with the utmost care that he pulls out a handkerchief and swipes at her tears.
“I told Natalie my godfather couldn’t visit because you were at your boyfriend’s place feeling sick according to Gran. And Nat told the whole class and she won’t speak to me.”
“Yes. Last I heard she was doing a Potions mastery,” Pansy said. “Apparently not a lesbian after all.”
"With someone?" Draco shakes his head no.
“I will next time. I should have. Sorry. I need you to look at some evidence when you have a chance,” Harry said.
“Or half a street in Port Talbot. The Department took ten weeks to tell me they weren’t certain if it was possible,” Harry said.
“Go home. We’ll call you once we have a better idea,” Zacharias said calmly. And it was the fact that someone who didn’t care much for him was showing concern that made him pause.
“You’re not scheduled today,” Greg said simply. How the fuck did Greg know his schedule?
Draco heaved a deep, long sigh.
“Wonderful. Please go home. I am formally suspending you for the week. You will make it up in overtime. If you gossip about it, I’ll remove you from the program for undermining my practicum,” Healer Cummins said. Trainee Forrester left in tears.
As much as Harry was glad this had amounted to something potentially helpful, they were skirting around what Harry wanted to speak about.
“No. You interview him here for whatever information you need.” Harry said more firmly.
“Wait, how did that end with you as a spy?” Harry said, confused.
Harry didn't realize how used to Draco he is until he is gone. They see each other once at the lifts and Draco raises a casual hand in greeting, but otherwise has been nowhere to be found. Draco’s new partner is the one to pick up case files.
“First, they came for coffee shops, now they’re turning every pub in this country into a microbrewery calibrated to the tastes of a medieval peasant,” Draco said.
Harry hated it when people made sense. And doubly so when that meant the Minister for Magic was asking him for favours. He couldn’t care less about the devices, but he still had a hard time knowing anyone was in danger. That was why he had left the Auror Department. Someone was always in need of rescue and it weighed on him, whether or not it was his case.
“That’s disgusting,” Harry said.
“And what did he want?”
“How am I to keep up with all this new language? I changed the important one about blood status, so I think I’ve done quite well for myself,” Pansy sniffed.
As he stopped in the last world, he realized he might have made a mistake in his assessment.
“This way,” Harry said. Draco begrudgingly followed. He had not realized that Harry’s hair curled along the nape of his neck when long enough. He tore his eyes away.
Images bubble to the surface. Harry has been thinking of him, certainly. Draco sees his fantasy-self sliding two fingers into himself and arching beautifully off a bed that is probably Harry’s. He would blush but he is trying to focus on helping Harry. He clears his throat.
The loudest noise Harry had ever heard boomed from the shipping container and the yellow metal went to pieces like a child blowing confetti. Harry had cast a shield charm out of pure instinct and dropped into the water grabbing at Penny and Athena roughly. He could feel the crackle of his earpiece but he couldn’t hear a damned thing. He could see nothing but bright spots in his vision. Shrapnel rained overhead but Harry kept his face in the water for several long minutes. Penny rolled away and leapt up.
“I don’t think anyone who grew up in an estate with grounds is allowed to call himself a man of the people. That’s when people start sharpening their guillotines,” Theo said.
Aunt Andromeda came in late. She wore a black silk Muggle dress and made no concessions to a traditional funeral otherwise. She was unadorned and stood out among the peacock feather hats and heavy heirloom necklaces and brooches encrusted with jewels. But she had shown up at all. Looks and whispers followed her around the room.
“I’m going to stay,” Michael says.
She ordered a glittering chocolate torte for the table. Maybe Draco should slip Harry a few Galleons. Harry had never dined with the likes of Pansy Josephine Parkinson before he agreed to pay for the bill.
Athena shook her head hard.
There was something about the tilt of his neck that beckoned Harry’s hand, and Harry rested his hand on his cheek. He was taking liberties. But Draco leaned into the touch. He looked at once content and desperate to not have it snatched away.
Harry made a full report to Kingsley to follow up with the brief messages he had sent by Patronus. He expected to be reprimanded sharply. In the very least, he had held on to evidence for too long and had stunned five men without cleaning up after himself or alerting the department. But Kingsley only listened without asking any questions.
“Sorry, I promise I’ll get to it eventually,” his dad said. His dad kissed his mum on the cheek.
“Dean was so drunk when Ron did this to him that he cried over the ‘84 Quidditch championship,” Ginny confessed.
“Your man’s alright,” George told him when they finally returned Draco to him, an hour or so later. Charlie and Bill agreed.
"Do you know how I met Patience, Harry?" Kingsley said, as Harry reached the door of the master bedroom.
Yannick made a pained expression and leaned in. "Let's just say, a lot of people here think mind healing is a form of advanced coddling and that it would be better if people just toughened up."
Harry wanted to laugh at Draco’s self-satisfied little smile. Draco stirred a vial with a glass stick and it made a pleasant tinkling sound and turned bright green.
“If you’re ready to return to service, I have a special assignment for you.”
“Am I allowed to contact my parents?” The witch looked at him like he was being ridiculous.
Draco traces Harry’s lightning scar, across his jawline, the wetness of his full bottom lip. Draco smiles when Harry tries to catch Draco’s thumb with his teeth. Draco traces down his chest with a brief pause to brush his thumb in the hollow where the Horcrux locket had burned long ago. It feels good. It feels so good. So many people Harry has slept with either avoided the scars or paid them too much mind. Harry feels himself drawn to his hands.
“The last part. I can shut out the rest of our meeting.” Harry cast and watched as he cut those few minutes and Draco’s eyes went blank and refocused. Harry hurried and gave him the wand back; he didn’t want Draco to realize the missing time was his fault.
“It’ll be good. No one will interrupt if I kiss you in the kitchen,” Harry says, then demonstrates.
“No,” Draco said. “I wanted to see the sunrise, since we’re awake.”
“Is this Muggle?” Theo finally asked about one painting. Draco nodded. “It’s very good. I like your art.”
"At worst, on paper, you’re currently guilty of not filing some reports and mild insubordination. No one knows,” Hermione said.
"Off, " he murmured. His magic must have gone a little bit haywire, because everything but Draco's boxers disappeared.
Even Harry's glasses were different,  a more rectangular shape with tortoiseshell frames. It suited him. What right did Harry have to go around looking like that in public while Draco was trying to have a breakdown?
Draco was familiar with that face. The “I have secrets I can’t share because of my job” face Harry was sporting. He’d always figured Greg was a suspect but it was confirmed.
“I don’t think you’ll be able to,” Hermione said. “Do you want to hear more baby names?”
“He’s a patient, Auror Potter,” Mediwitch Routh said. They had an audience too, and he watched Draco turn that lovely shade of pink.
“I know,” she said. Lucius Malfoy had let her down too, in many ways. She spoke again.
“A vanilla cone,” Harry said. He wasn’t looking at the board in the shop. He was looking at Florean Fortescue.
“You should meet my other friend actually, I think he just got here. He’s also from London.” She wanders back inside and brings someone back around.
“I’m out. Do you know any potions that aren’t controlled substances?” Draco’s lips were twitching minutely like he was trying not to smile.
“I would hope so,” Draco said.
The balcony overlooked a small pond. There was a wry smile playing around Draco’s lips as they faced each other, leaning on opposite bannisters.
“Harry isn’t likely to agree without details. Go ahead, Hermione,” Kingsley said.
“It’s still not right,” Harry insisted.
“Are they ever going to leave Longbottom alone?” Draco held up the Prophet. MORE LIKE THE MAN WHO LIVED: LONGBOTTOM TOPLESS IN CORFU see page 3 for more details. Harry snorted. His Neville would hate that.
“Draco?” Harry called back.
“Luna would like me if I were a shrub,” Draco said. Harry shrugged. He wasn’t wrong. They apparated the edge of the property Ron and Hermione had bought. They were hosting a small housewarming party there, even though they wouldn’t be moving in for another month.
“Stop!” A man shouted.
“It’s not a mission I’d give an Auror,” Kingsley said.
“Okay. Rotate in one direction, then back.” Hermione demonstrated without touching the Firebird. Her fingers ghosted over the device lightly.
"You flirt with the bartender for a top-up and half the department for first pick of case files. Forgive me for not thinking it signified anything."
Draco refused to be hurried along with Harry’s  kisses. He wanted to take Harry apart slowly with his lips, tongue, teeth, fingers and cock. He wanted to be inside him and have him inside. He wanted to taste him. So he did.
months?"
"No. You?"
They were standing in front of the block of flats where Harry had left him every single time before.
“Oh sweetie, you’re soaked. I think we have a towel and a shirt in the back, at least. We’ve a spare umbrella under the cash, no?”
“Ten minutes,” said Healer Cummins.
He was glad that they hadn’t made him wear his uniform again, just black robes.
“He would have liked you all night long,” Harry said. They both burst into giggles.
“What were you looking for?” Harry prodded.
“I am,” Harry said. Easily.
“The Firebird he took is an earlier prototype. It isn’t stable. He could seriously hurt himself or get killed by accident. And even unintentional damage could have severe consequences,” Hermione said.
“Do you think about what happened?” She asked at the end of the fourth session. It was too early for probing spells and Pensieves, she had said. Melinda was in an emerald green cardigan with a tiny pin that said ‘persist’ in bright red cursive script.
There were groups of students sitting in their uniforms sprawled across the lawn chasing the first bit of consistent sunshine. They looked so young to him that he almost couldn’t believe he had been that small once. None of them seemed to take any interest in him, dismissing him almost immediately as an adult and therefore unworthy of attention.
“Lovely,” Draco says, looking at the oak shelves. The light is dim in here, and the air is stuffy. Harry coughs.
“I’ll be off then,” Penny said smoothly.
“I’m going to miss that,” Draco said.
“No, Teddy. I don’t have my broom with me,” Harry said. Teddy smiled at him with the openness of a five-year-old. If Harry was not a trained Auror, maybe Teddy would have been able to snatch the wand he had left on Andromeda’s living room table. A spray of harmless green sparks went off as soon as Teddy’s hand brushed it.
“Harry, we’ve found him. Very faint traces of magic but he’s on an old Wizarding farm in Shetland,” Kingsley said.
“I didn’t realize it at the time, but the fact I never saw Theo on my travels means a lot of things.”
“Half of them still think I’m spying for the French,” Malfoy chuckled as they entered the balcony. “The French paid better than our own country, to be perfectly honest. If I’d known that’s all I’d be accused of for the next decade, I might have been tempted.”
“We know how they recruit, how they fund their activities, and even their cover stories. But we still don’t know why,” Penny added.
"Tell me anyway." Harry needed a distraction.
“And I nearly did!” Draco roared back. “So did you. That’s nothing to be proud of!”
And he left Draco there on the floor.
“I hope you talk to someone,” Ginny had touched his shoulder lightly then took the last of her things from his place.
“Put me down or I’ll hex your left testicle off.” Draco laughed and then set her down.
“Will the command centre give us orders to proceed? ” Athena whispered. She sounded impatient, a little growl underlying her tone. Harry could barely see the shimmer he thought was her ahead.
"He thought it was amusing. He kissed me and sent me on my way," Draco said.
Harry gives Draco a meaningful look. Their hands are still clasped.
Harry cut him off with another searing filthy kiss. Draco seemed not to mind tasting himself on Harry. Harry had mostly forgotten about his own needs until Draco found his way to his erection. He moaned almost embarrassingly loud in the small space. Draco shushed him gently until a few short pulls later, he came all over Draco's belly button, though he hardly seemed to mind. Harry collapsed next to him, vanishing the mess he'd made.
Theo looked happy enough at this celebration dinner for the engagement though. It was only the four of them. Harry cleared his throat.
“I think he liked you,” Hermione said.
So far they had been in a relationship, a general and his spy, coworkers and actual friends. But something as simple as “Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were bound closely by fate” sounded too much like rubbish to consider seriously. Maybe there was something he had that Draco wanted. Draco would not be the first person who had learned Harry had touched the Hallows. And he wouldn’t be the first desperate person to think Harry could bring someone back.
“You could come to Zurich to visit. I’d like that,” Draco says quickly. Harry feels a cautious hope spread.
Her magic sort of felt like Draco’s but different. Elegant and calm like her wandwork.
“For God’s sake, Harry, I’m not going to take him in for waterboarding,” Hermione said, putting her wand away as she rolled her eyes. She turned to Draco.
Less than fifteen minutes passed before Draco came out again. Draco kissed him softly on the cheek.
“None of the attacks have been fatal yet, correct?” Draco asked. Harry nodded.
“There’s someone else for you,” Narcissa said. Harry was still standing awkwardly in the doorway when Draco spotted him. His smile became much more shy.
“Mum!” Draco said.
“After the War, sometimes I found I couldn't breathe either,” Draco said. The music was loud for a brief second, then quieter again as the balcony doors closed. Harry fumbled with the Firebird as his hands shook.
“The bombings last month were fueled by Dark objects. Someone has found a way to convert their magical energy from its intended purpose to pure destruction.”
“You’ll lie down, won’t you?” his mum said, stepping into a spacious grey and white flat. Somehow this was what made him tear up a little.
It was only a split second where Harry saw the outline of Zacharias with his wand raised as he rested one hand on the corner of the shipping container. Why could Harry see Zacharias at all? Shouldn’t there be—
As if that phrase summoned him, he spotted Draco across the room. His hair was tied back in a bun and he had opted for no shirt at all and a green tartan kilt which somehow made him look more naked than if he had gone starkers.
“In the way that running is like fucking, Potter, sure.” Draco slashed the air and two cauldrons began pouring themselves into empty glass vials.
“This is why I never come to Brossard,” a pink-haired wizard adds. People laugh.
“Oh?” Draco says. “I thought I saw him.”
“Lavender Brown? Really?” Harry hadn’t heard about her in a while. She spat at Draco that day in Diagon Alley. But he assumed like everyone else she had moved on with her life and hated Death Eaters which was understandable. Why would she work with them?
“I’m not nervous,” Draco said.
“I don’t think I should,” Draco said. Harry stood in the same spot as Draco picked up his wand from the kitchen. “I’m sorry.”
“Look, didn’t he pick the worlds? It sounds like he picked all these places where he was the best possible version of himself,” Ron said.
She reached a hand out to cup his chin like he was a boy again and her eyes were brimming with tears.
"No. You came back regularly, which displaced small, manageable amounts of magical energy. That was the dreams. He displaced a great deal of magical energy and shunted it into our timeline in one go and nearly killed himself doing it. We hadn't known because it was mostly theoretical and no one had ever gone for longer than an hour before this."
A reliable informant told them that one of the more dangerous cells, Prima, would be meeting here tonight to conclude planning a bombing of the Muggleborn Resource Centre in Central London. Kingsley had appointed Athena the point person which made Harry nervous. She was good. She was very good. But she was not an Auror.
“I should check on him,” Harry said. He was going to cross the lawn when Draco looked up and shook his head subtly. Harry stopped.
“Sorry the team isn’t any good when you spend all this time with us, Professor,” Aman Clef said, shuffling his feet. He had dropped the Quaffle a half dozen times during passing drills, including, memorably, directly on Harry’s head from twenty feet up. His temple still throbbed a little.
“Anyone could travel to parallel universes, right? But most people have a limit. More than a few hours and you begin to forget yourself. If you stay too long, you become who you are pretending to be.”
“It’s nothing. I need a break,” Harry said.
Well there was a surprise. Draco wanted to make eye contact with Theo to assess what the fuck was going on but he was stubbornly examining his books and paintings.
“We both know I’m not coming back, Kingsley,” Harry said with a bit of a smile.
Harry hadn't exactly had time to go for a haircut, and he let Draco wrap a curl around his index finger while they sat on the couch.
“If you don’t want to share a camping bed again, we better head home,” Draco said.
“We only just heard about what happened,” Ron said.
“There could be someone inside,” Harry says. “Look! There’s someone inside.”
“You won’t be debauching me on a sawdust covered floor in any case,” Draco said smoothly, rolling to stand. Harry always gave him room as if he knew he didn’t like feeling trapped. Harry stood up himself and offered a hand up.
Pansy came exactly once, meeting him for tea years ago at the Victoria and Albert museum dressed exactly like a High Street mannequin in fancy Muggle clothing. She wrote to him twice a week but never visited again. Draco got the feeling that Pansy found the entire experience very disconcerting because, like him, she found it was not nearly as different as she had thought.
“Not exactly. There are patterns to how you jump. It’s a shorter jump to universes that are like ours, and a longer one to universes that aren’t. If we cast for a close, it’s more likely to be one that seems somewhat familiar.”
“I learned this one in New Zealand,” Pansy declared then led Draco in a complicated twirling dance. Draco finally got the hang of it about a half hour later.
“It’s alright,” Draco offered.
The Firebird was still warm, but no colours.
“Mother has been burning all our invites anyway,” Draco joked.
“May I?” Narcissa asked. But she didn’t wait for the healer’s answer and threw her arms around him. They stayed like that for a few brief moments and Harry watched. He was aching desperately to hold him too, but this was important and he could wait. For all he knew, Draco was about to be furious with him.
“Nothing about this is funny, Draco. Promise me,” Pansy insisted. Draco met Theo’s cool gaze and then Pansy’s grave expression more carefully.
“In the middle of enjoying the sights, we met a wealthy Italian merchant and his wife who persuaded us to follow them to their villa for a week. You know how the old country houses are in the summer with people traipsing in and out. Opera singers, minor royalty, other merchants. One night they introduced us to a nice chap named Benedicto. Our age, but very sheltered. Have you ever heard of a fucking Italian over the age of twelve that wasn’t allowed wine at dinner?”
,” Draco said, his tone sharp and hostile. He ducked his head immediately after as if he had got out the habit of responding meanly and didn’t know what to do with himself.
"What happens if I invite you up to my hotel room?” Harry says, reckless.
“I’ll knit cardigans. You’ll be my best customer,” Draco said. Melinda laughed aloud.
“I told Tinzel the substitution wouldn’t work,” Draco muttered to himself, vanishing the contents of the cauldron and writing some notes in a journal.
“Tell my cousin Edward never to have his Wolfsbane made by that hack of a Potions Professor at Hogwarts ever again. What you brought me for testing was at least half-strength what it should have been.”
“I know, I just...” Harry trailed off.
“I wasn’t looking for
“It was probably more impressive before our government let people pillage the site, curse it and take what wasn’t theirs,” Draco said. He sounded a little wistful despite his words.
“I...shouldn’t have got him involved,” Harry admitted, guilt washing over him.
“I imagine it was in spite of me. But she did join,” Kingsley agreed.
"Harry. I'm Draco's date. Pleased to meet you." Harry looked like he had shaken hands just this side of too hard.
All Harry can think of is the last time Harry had seen him. Through the blur of his job and his friends and their kids, he had stopped really thinking about that time in his life. He had basically forgotten, but it comes back into sharp relief.
"That's all I can tell you so stop asking before I accidentally invoke the Departmental Geas."
“I don’t need your charity. And I already know you’re behind the Ministry ordering from my shop,” Draco accused. Harry didn’t deny it. Sounded like something he’d do.
“Do you have a Healer’s note for that?” Draco asked.
Either way Harry doesn't even let them get out of the entryway before he kisses Draco, impatient and deep. Draco wants to protest that this isn't necessary but he likes it so much. Then Harry is slow and deliberate, like wringing the last drips of honey from a jar. He undresses Draco with care.
Then his vision was filled with Harry’s grinning face. Harry was pouring sweat too but he looked good doing it, all tousled and glowing like a wet dream. Draco felt like a wet noodle.
"Not really," Hermione said.
“I remember what you thought,” Harry says, with a small smile. “Do you...do you miss London?” Harry wonders. He wants to ask,
“Stability Potion, Oxygenation Spell, Stamina Potion,” Healer Forrester said.
Harry added Galleons to a tidy pile Draco started.
“Well? Do you like my new nose?” Pansy asked. She turned her face to the side so he could see the likely expensive work of a permanent cosmetic glamour.
“You have killed the joke twice now,” Draco informed him.
“I think you’d like something that’s got a lot of different stuff every day. I don’t know if you’d be satisfied knowing a lot about one area,” Theo said. “Is there something like that?”
And he would, but the menu was in Italian. All he had learned of the language from holidays besides please and thank you was ‘sorry I am not interested in sex.’ Draco didn’t bother even pretending to consult with Harry before ordering smoothly for both of them.
Maybe he should do as his parents bid him and restore the glory of the Manor. The money is there, after all. The time is there too, should he wish to contract out most of the stonemasonry, tiling and window repair. It would only take an Owl from his Ministry desk to a builder and then to Gringotts.
“Why did you kiss me?” Harry asked. What he wanted to ask was: will this happen again? Would you like it to happen again? Are we seeing each other?
“Everything?” Harry asked, running his fingers over the smooth wood. He had done this a fair few times as an Auror.
“Valerie, come tell Fatima about the trip,” someone calls from inside the flat. She leaves them facing each other.
But Draco didn’t. His face softened, looking sweet and vulnerable in a way Harry hadn’t seen in any universe. And he kissed him. It was more passion than finesse, Draco’s mouth hot beneath his. Harry wanted to remind him he was kissing him in his own body.
“That would be a cool job for you, I’d think,” Harry turned around once again and he was smiling.
“Besides, I can’t cook,” Draco admitted.
“You look like you’ve seen a ghost,” a voice said. Harry saw the hand on his shoulder and for a second he froze.
It took Harry less than a day to shut up the cottage properly. He wasn’t there most of the year, anyway. It was a matter of gathering a few clothes, shutting the Floo, changing the wards again, and taking everything Wizarding out. The cottage was remote, and from the outside looked like nothing more than a stonewashed hut, but he never knew if someone might stumble upon it by accident.
“I don’t live far,” Draco says, apropos of nothing. Harry thinks it might be an invitation. Harry licks his lips.
“You want a cat?” Harry had never thought Draco would want a cat, but after picturing a discussion with Luna about keeping a pet, he understands why it’s never come up before.
“Are you feeling well? The Browns always pack too many people in,” Draco said, his brows knit together with worry. Draco placed a hand on his arm.
Harry asked the first question that came to mind since he was hungry and a little desperate for more of this normalcy. “What are you making for dinner?”
Harry looked down at his own forgotten Firebird. It glowed a steady, bright crimson.
“She hasn’t said anything? She broke up with me,” Harry murmured while they set the table. Molly dropped the kettle she had been floating over to the table. Harry flicked a freezing charm before the boiling water splashed on someone. Molly abruptly exited the room on the verge of tears.
arrived at the Manor.
“Really?” Harry said, so loudly that someone from another table looked over. Harry lowered his voice. “What do you mean?”
Bill sat them both down in his tent. They gave him an account of the afternoon. Harry thought it would be unfair to blame Draco for not seeing the last rune since he was largely useless, so he glossed over that part as they took turns. Bill pinched the bridge of his nose, though he didn’t seem upset with them.
“I’m going to drive home. I can drop you at your hotel, Harry.” Harry didn’t even notice Draco had come up beside him. Draco says his goodbyes and jogs for a tiny burgundy Honda Civic. Harry follows. Rain slicks Draco’s hair back and his shirt is almost translucent in the time it takes him to unlock the door. Harry is soaked through. He flicks the rain off both of them with a neat spell and buckles his seat belt.
Some of them smirked at the grass and mud stains on his front, but it seemed to cheer them.
Another trainee stepped forward who Draco actually knew. He had lent notes to Benjamin Kwanu once, which means they were practically friends as far as his interactions with other students had gone.
“Do you want to be alone for a second?” Harry nodded.
“I’ll be at your place at 7 pm,” Draco said. “And Harry? Get some sleep. You look terrible,” Draco added. Apparently they were on a permanent first name basis.
Harry gave him a long, considering look. He had tried at least to make this on Draco’s terms and not his. So Harry had seen him every weekend for three months and gave him a chaste kiss on his doorstep. He waited for Draco to tell Harry he could get close again or to even come into his building past the main door. He had given him time and space when both were making him feel ridiculous because he already knew.
“Oh God, I’m being so pathetic that
After breakfast, they did more kissing until Harry wasn't sure if it was lack of air or a sudden rush of blood south that made him dizzy.
“You’re nine,” Harry said instead.
“Potter?” Draco said, first.
“The last one. It felt too strange to be in universes where there wasn’t a War or where I was too different,” Draco said.
“Well, now there’s the two of you and I’m single. Bad scheme, don’t you think?” Harry was aware he was drawing closer and closer to interference.
That is not the most important matter at hand, but it's easier than thinking about how he is in some horrible upside-down world. Draco is propositioning him, but only because of a cursed box. In Harry's fantasies this always happened because one late night, Draco had realized Harry had been missing in his life and their friendship could be more.
“You said only kissing. I’ll wait until you’re comfortable with more,” Harry said firmly. Even he felt slight disorientation in his body, and he had been returning here to eat and sleep. He can’t imagine how much worse Draco must feel. Draco wasn’t sleeping well and sometimes Harry awoke in the middle of the night to feel Draco awake and staring at the ceiling.
The shops were getting less busy and the cobblestones more uneven. Still, it was nothing out of the ordinary. There were the same signs of the War if you knew where to look, but nothing, nothing like that last world. A small stencilled lily was still visible on the lower-left corner of some dingier looking homes. It looked almost accidental, like a child’s drawing, and it was easy to miss if you didn’t look.
“Hello!” Bill called.
“We don’t need to make conversation. You can go back and tell all your friends you saw Draco Malfoy, and he looked pathetic,” Draco spat out.
“Well, fuck.” Ron said. Hermione busied herself trying to clean up.
“Of course.” Healer Blishwick waved his wand, and they were in an office building once again.
“A present,” Draco said, pulling out a package from his bag. Harry looked at him. They had already sent money to Rose’s trust. They had discussed his propensity for generous and unnecessary presents. He was still not over the fact Draco had bought Teddy a brand new Firebolt without telling him.
Harry has always been sensitive to magic, but after studying it more, he can
"Sounds like he will, George. Something refined for our pedestrian tastes," Fred said, mirroring George.
“Current studies for what happens if you get murdered in another body are inconclusive,” Hermione said. Her face was carefully blank.
“Not for much longer. In September I’m back to Zurich,” Draco says. “I’m mostly doing contract work for potions development firms. And are you with the Aurors?”
"Spirit or letter of the law?" Harry said.
They dropped the subject, but Draco let Harry walk him to the apparition point. Draco pressed his lips to Harry’s too quick for him to react, too quick for Harry to pull him closer.
“Do you think she’ll return?” Harry asked.
“Of course, Eustace,” Draco was embarrassed to feel a vague prickle in his eyelids.
and nearly blinded himself. Draco had not yet got used to the wand before the Ministry took it and his control was completely off. Fuck.
“I was. They were annoying, you know?” Here Draco smiled faintly at the memory. “I had forgotten how annoying they could be. Constantly hovering, asking for an update on everything I did or ate. If I didn’t write every other day, my father would write a dramatic letter. My mother asked a lot of prying questions about how I meant to get heirs of my body to satisfy their last will and testament when she wasn’t asking about restoring the Malfoy name.” Here he laughed, recalling their exact words. “They were absolutely terrible but I missed them. It made it easier to think that I could let them go,” Draco said.
“Draco should come in for questioning—”
“You covered it. Who are you? You would have died for him once!” Greg shouted. His composure had cracked. For all that they were adults, they had known each other as children. And that meant it was harder to pretend.
“They’ve closed the apparition point,” Draco said, ignoring Harry’s comment. He sounded indifferent to this, but perhaps it was that it was irrelevant to him. He pointed to a triangular symbol faintly glowing red. It had been open when he got there an hour ago.
“Just tell me what you’re searching for!” Harry said.
