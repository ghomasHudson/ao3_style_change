He walked down the hall silently, folding his fingers into milky white fists. Pain reverberated out from where his fingernails dug into soft skin. Reminding himself to take deep breaths, he pushed open the doors to the lavatory down the hall, exchanging a polite nod with an older man making his exit.
Harry widens his eyes, his gaze falling back to the syringe on his coffee table. He really should throw it away.
“For life,” Harry repeats, feeling his voice go scratchy and raw, too. He pulls them both in close, and Hermione peppers his face with kisses.
They reach the door, and it swings open by itself, the house seemingly excited to be tending to a real Black.
Hermione smacks him on the shoulder.
Suddenly turning in the doorway, Draco called out. “Harry.”
The coil disappears silkily into the parchment before returning just seconds later, wrapped around another. The second coil is significantly smaller, glowing much softer than Harry’s own, and more of a faded and dim yellow to his burning orange.
“You probably get this from a lot of patients,” Draco started as they continued past a handful of Mediwitch break rooms. “And I may sound entirely crazy.”
After the ceremony, Harry entered the house in preparation to leave but found himself wandering aimlessly through some of the halls. It was easy to imagine why Draco had grown up in the way that he did. Especially when much of his childhood had been tied to a house like this. It wasn’t warm or comforting in the way that The Burrow was. It was intimidating and shockingly bare. He would have imagined garish light fixtures and ornate decorations to adorn the inside of the Manor but found that there was just an immense amount of blank space.
Harry knew he wouldn't be able to live with himself if things, their relationship, continued this way, but at this point, there wasn't another option.
“I would be confused if I didn’t,” Draco remarks, coming around from behind the desk to stand in front of Harry. “I’ve studied violin since I was a child.”
“Tonight, at eight. We will meet outside the kitchens.” Malfoy stated simply, turning on his heels as his friends followed eagerly behind.
“Alright. I’ll be in my office if you need me,” Ron said, even though they both knew that Harry wouldn’t. They hadn’t eaten lunch together in several weeks.
“I’m not really hungry.” Draco sighed, rubbing at his bleary eyes, still sleep-tired from the night before.
“Yeah, I don’t feel great,” Harry whined, letting his head lean back against the headboard as he gulped down the potion. It smelled foul and left a bitter aftertaste in the mouth. It promptly halted the waves of nausea, but Harry’s headache remained.
Draco beamed in response, “What did you say?”
“Draco, what —”
“No, I’m not,” Harry says defensively. “Why the hell would you be skulking around a corner like that, how was I supposed to know?”
“Yeah,” Harry breathes, opting not to inform him as to why.
“Deal,” A bright smile colored Harry’s features, and warmth spread across his body. He wasn’t going to apologize anymore or dredge events from the week passed and risk further upsetting Draco, but they had made up, and that’s what mattered.
Harry would choose the fate of death sooner than reveal his involvement in a perceived criminal underworld.
Luna responds with a tinkling laugh, “I don’t know him well, but he invites me to these often, and I enjoy speaking with him. He has interesting things to say.”
He doesn’t respond, rubbing his bare arms with his hands.
Draco’s first instinct, to shy away from her touch, was replaced by a sense of gratitude. He felt comfortable around her in the way that he was sometimes comfortable around strangers. There was nothing to answer to. No preconceived notions about his character to be disproven.
“Draco’s an interesting name,” one said, sidling up next to Malfoy. “What’s it mean?”
Instead, he said, “I’m fine. You worry like a mother, but there’s no need. I genuinely just had a headache today.” Which was, in part, truthful.
“Harry, I just need someone,” Draco said quietly, as though he were embarrassed to even say such a thing.
Harry steps closer, aware of how his body is positioned between Draco’s legs. He dabs another layer of liquid from the vial on, letting it settle into the skin.
Harry trudged out of Slytherin disappointedly, and he could practically feel Parkinson sticking her tongue out at him behind his back. He had wanted to stay and argue until Draco allowed him in, but Zabini was insistent that he stop “invading Slytherin space” and just give Draco some time to process. If he needed space right now, he should have it. Though Harry was stubborn and already had plans to confront Draco at some point. He just needed to catch him at the right time.
“It’s a beautiful day for a wedding,” Narcissa says, looking at the sky. Harry isn’t sure if she’s being serious, as grey clouds creep over the dark sky. “I do apologise for my tardiness. Kipsy needed some assistance with Lucius.” She whispers his name as though it is a curse word.
Once inside, Draco brought apples from the garden and used small quick movements to slice it with his wand. He would bake them in cinnamon and serve them with cream for dessert. Harry always found the dish too simplistic and never sweet enough for his taste. He preferred something heartier, like a chocolate cake or treacle tart.
The older gentleman nodded his head in acknowledgement, but refused to meet Harry’s eyes.
“As we do every week, we’re going to start with our mission, and a few affirmations,” Azalea says.
Harry knows he’s lying when he shakes his head, but he forces himself to take a breath and think before he speaks, which is something very new for him. He’s embarrassed by how many times he has to remind himself they aren’t schoolchildren anymore. “You’re allowed to have friends. I won’t be the one to get in the way of that,” he says.
“I really like him,” Harry said, his words almost a whisper as if he were afraid to say them out loud.
Draco crossed the empty street in a few easy steps and pushed in. The bell announced his arrival from behind him. A portly man behind the counter was scribbling something into a notepad, the pen dwarfed by his large fingers.
Harry’s cock was pushing at his entrance now, and he was entirely too intoxicated to just listen. Draco yelped in surprise at the unwelcome press.
“She does that sometimes.”
“Hi,” he said, his voice timid and small. Harry wondered if this was how he’d been as a child, in a Manor alone with Lucius and Narcissa.
The words
Draco must have taken the whole damn bottle, when Harry only needed the smallest sip to knock him out completely in the nighttime.
Harry found his appetite had escaped him. The happy familiarity of the morning had cleared off to reveal reality. Which was double potions with Slytherin’s first thing after their meal. Harry could’ve sworn that the Professors conspired to place Gryffindor’s with their opposites, just for the casual drama of it all. He buttered a slice of toast and took a few tentative bites before leaving the remainder on his plate. Ron chucked the rest in his mouth as they left for their Monday lessons.
. The words died in the back of his throat and never made it to the surface. Harry’s eyes were eager with desire.
He reaches the Hampstead stop soon after that. Using a discreet Point-Me Charm, he takes a deliberate right onto Heath Street, trudging down the dimly lit main road toward what can only be the general area of Mansfield Place. It’s a nice area, Harry thinks, as he begins his walk down a narrow, wooded path. It’s too dark for him to make out more than shapes, but he knows that if it were light out the whole place would be green and lush and gorgeous.
Despite the guest of honour’s disappearance, Harry was having a good enough time. George had spiked the pumpkin juice, and cheeks all around were stained a rosy pink. Everyone was swaying in place just a little more than usual.
, Weasley,” Draco teases from the doorway, and Harry’s attention snaps up. He has barely registered Draco’s face when Hermione covers his eyes.
“Er,” Harry pauses for a moment, wondering if he should just get to the point and then take his leave. “Sure, I guess.”
Draco stiffened but attempted to maintain a calm composure. “Indeed.” There was no need to fight.
“So, you and Draco,” Hermione says, taking care to keep her face low, though no one else seems to be paying attention. “You two are together quite a bit.”
He launched himself at Harry with a driving force, tackling him into the overgrown grass of their front lawn. They lay still for a moment before Draco nuzzled gently into Harry’s neck.
Draco was absolutely unequivocally going mad, Harry thought. He had broken his husband.
Ron looked uncertain. “Harry, maybe you feel like that, but are you sure he does?”
“Move,” Draco commanded, but it sounded like a soft and pleading mewl.
Draco swallowed him whole and then eased back out again, flicking his tongue teasingly across the tip and meeting Harry’s gaze ardently. He hollowed his cheeks, sucking at Harry like it was his life’s purpose. Harry began to move, slowly at first, but increasing his pace and relishing how it looked to have Draco’s pink lips wrapped so beautifully around the length of him.
“That bad?”
“Five,” Harry answered too quickly, playing with something on his finger.
Someone is in front of him.
“Harry?” he called into the emptiness, feeling immense and unfamiliar relief when footsteps echoed in the hallway beyond the sitting room.
Harry looks at the clock as it ticks down to midnight: five minutes left until a brand new year. While he’s not quite sure exactly what he wants to do with it yet, he’s absolutely certain he wants to spend it with Draco by his side.
Hermione turned back to him, cocking an eyebrow. “And I supposed when you spoke up, it did absolutely nothing either.”
“Like hell you don’t,” Harry growled. He threw a plate then, without quite realising what he was doing, and it shattered against the wall by Draco’s head; shards of porcelain skittered across the hardwood.
Harry shouldn’t drink; he knows that he shouldn’t. But the gash in his thigh is throbbing, and the burn of alcohol would be a welcome distraction. He reaches out, chest tightening ever so slightly as their fingers brush at the exchange of the glass. Harry takes a sip.
If he happened to turn around, Harry would Apparate away immediately. On such an empty street, it would have been obvious to Harry that he was being followed.
It’s not that Harry had necessarily been privy to every time Draco had used. But he seemed to be in better spirits, spending more endless hours with Harry than back at his home, where he is more likely to take something. And now that Harry thinks of it, he’s never explicitly stated that he wants to quit, and Harry had honestly just assumed he might do it since he has someone to care about him. Which is, by all means, a very selfish assumption.
Harry swallowed slowly. “Crystal.”
Draco nods.
They continued breakfast primarily in silence while Draco wrote a note for Lyra to take to Gringotts on his behalf. He then wrote another one for Ginny.
“Fuck you,” he says abruptly, standing from his perch on the bed and storming out of the room.
Harry blinks. “I enjoy it most of the time,” he argues, before pausing.
“You sound a bit like Hermione,” Harry observes, amused.
It tasted no different than his usual cup at all, but there was something oddly familiar about it. He smacked his lips together, searching for the feeling again in his next taste. Again — something strangely stuck out.
“Listen, er, Malfoy. I feel sick. I think I– I think I have to go.” Harry stammered, but gathered his things and took off running down the hill. It was a coward’s move, Harry knew that, but he couldn’t stand there for a moment longer. Once the high wore off, he’d be faced with the consequences of his actions, and he would rather do anything but that.
“Ginny, I’ll have to catch up in a bit,” he said, rather pragmatically, and didn’t miss when she huffed away from him. She knew better than to make a fuss in front of Odessa.
Claude cocks his head to the side as if to say,
Draco broke away from his thoughts. “He really won’t see me?”
“Draco,” he smiles encouragingly, turning him forward by the hips. “I think it’s wonderful that you want to do that. I just don’t know if I should come with you for the first time.”
Draco gasped, one hand coming up to cover his mouth and hush a strangled cry creeping up the length of his throat.
They’d all been a little suspicious about the quick turn, but it was hard for anyone to find any obvious fault in their relationship anymore. Harry supposed there really wasn’t one. But something about new Draco put him on edge. He wasn’t comfortable at all with the way things had been, but he certainly wasn’t satisfied with them now either.
“Harry?” he asks, his words muffled against the sheets.
It didn’t matter if their relationship was grey and unhappy. At least they were together.
The house warms almost immediately at Draco’s presence, and Harry finds himself irritated at the fact that it’s often so stubborn with him.
“The Ministry decided it was best, and safest, to stop the practise. Usually soulmates found each other anyway,” Hermione explained. “I would bet a fair amount that Molly and Arthur share complementary magical cores.”
She was younger than Harry himself.
“You don’t feel that way anymore, though,” Harry guesses.
A pause followed.
He thinks back to what Narcissa had told him the month before.
Harry swallowed uncomfortably. “I don’t. Not at all,” he said and meant it.
Harry’s eyes meet his, enraptured. Their bodies press close together, the heat between them warms the winter-cold kitchen. Harry shivers despite it all, wishing he could stay wrapped up in Draco’s arms for the rest of his life. He leans his head happily on Draco’s shoulder, as he guides them around the open space.
Harry finds himself smiling. “Well, why don’t you?”
“Does it help you to know that I can’t control myself?” Harry spoke in a strained voice, as though it cost him something to say.
Draco stays silent, now letting out a soft hiss as Harry dabs more dittany onto the wound. It looks better already, less red and angry, and pinker around the edges, as though it’s beginning to heal. He takes out a small vial, made up of a myriad of herbs he’s unfamiliar with, but it’s very clearly labeled “For Cuts.” The Healers at St Mungo’s who created the kits knew what they were doing when it came to Aurors.
He really wanted to have the decency to confess. Draco deserved at least that much. But something inside of him stopped him from doing so. Because if he did, he’d never have Draco back in the way that he wanted.
“Evening, sir,” the man said in a warm voice, adjusting an apron around his hips. “How can I help?”
Draco raised a delicate eyebrow. “I’ve noticed.” He wanted an apology, not an excuse, but supposed he wouldn’t get one. Then, “Neither have I.”
When they had first moved in, Draco had set up a Muggle wireless radio, and Harry had been more than surprised. They’d danced to music in their kitchen while making breakfast each morning, and Draco would casually flip pancakes with just a flick of his wand. Harry had still not mastered such precise movement.
for that,” he sneered, advancing on Draco, who flattened himself further against the wall. “I never asked for any of this.”
“There’s not much to talk about, is there?” Harry steadied his breathing in his chest and was too cognisant of the uncomfortable press of the vial against his leg.
Draco is clad in a navy-blue tuxedo that clings to every sharp edge of his body like it is made for him. He usually has his hair gelled into place, especially on workdays, but he’s let it loose a little, and it falls longer around his eyes just like Harry likes it. He’s radiant and beautiful, and Harry wants this image of him burned into the backs of his eyelids.
“You alright, mate?” Ron whispered, tugging him forward gently.
He pauses for a few minutes before peering out the small window but can only make out shapes and colors. Nothing too striking is identifiable. Before he can move back, a man opens the door, and he startles at Harry in the way.
“She’s an absolute nightmare.” Pansy sighed and then yelped as something clattered against the floor. Ginny must have thrown something. Her usual weapon of choice was a pot lid.
Harry shrugged, gathering his things from his desk. “You know, I don’t —” he started, but was already heading for the door.
“Professor I don’t –”
Harry blinks, letting the statement sit heavy in his lap for a moment.
“Yes,” Draco draws his knees up to his chest, as he seems to do whenever he’s uncomfortable. “They made us both feel better at first and be better versions of ourselves. On my highs, I feel limitless. Like I’m the exact person I want to be in that very moment.”
“It’s only been a few months, Ron. We haven’t tried hard enough yet,” Harry said, only to say it.
“So, what were you saying about medicinal plants again?” Draco had asked, mostly attempting at politeness rather than chasing any inkling of curiosity.
He bucked violently from underneath Harry, terrified of his inability to voice his lack of inclination. Harry groaned, a needy and desperate thing that exposed unrelenting desire. He kissed him again, fierce and cutting. Draco could barely taste Harry’s lips against his, overwhelmed by the tangy metallic of his own blood. He couldn’t take it.
“You have such a big heart, Harry, but you can’t help everyone,” Hermione says. The pity in her tone doesn’t make him feel any more relieved.
, the voice warned at Draco’s resistance.
He nervously fiddled with a loose thread on his blue jeans and wished he could transfigure his trainers into something more stylish. He sat further back in his chair and wondered why Draco always made him feel a bit inadequate.
“No, Mr Potter, that’s not what I mean,” Ethel’s face becomes serious. “Let me be clear: once you know who the person is, over the course of a few days you’ll begin to feel their core, their magic in your body. It’ll be subtle, but you will be aware of another presence there. After knowing a specific name, your core will fight back if you try to push it away.”
“Oh, shove off.” Harry groaned, but he laughed along with her. “What bothered me was she asked me even though she already knew. How pointless!”
“It seemed quiet,” Malfoy hums and then raises a delicate eyebrow. “At least, it usually is.”
“No,” Draco concedes. “Pansy does sometimes. She says that even though we aren’t close, she’s my mother, and she deserves to know if I’m alright.”
But he was breathing, a soft and shallow thing that sounded more like a wheeze.
A silence falls over the table for a while as Harry considers the words spoken between them. He’d surmised already that Draco probably was avoiding finding out who his soulmate is, but he hadn’t really expected this. A deeply rooted self-hatred that makes Harry’s eyes sting. Anyone would be lucky to have Draco in their life, he realises, because for his terrible past and numerous flaws he’s more than them, he’s offered Harry a chance at real happiness without even coming to recognise it. How could Draco not see that about himself? How, in Merlin’s name, could he perceive himself to be so valueless? The questions are enough to make his head spin.
“Yeah,” Harry says sheepishly. “I don’t think I knew quite what I was walking into.”
“Then, we have very different definitions of what nice means.”
Draco pulled them out of his reach teasingly and met Harry with a wry smile. “Only if you promise they’ll have feta.”
“Mr Potter,” she says. “It’s nice to see you.
If this was sex, then Harry had never had it.
With a loud crack, Draco had vanished from the front stoop of the bar. Harry was left feeling bewildered and a little empty. He had looked forward to this moment all week, and quite suddenly, Draco decided to keep avoiding him. He was confused about why they hadn’t apparated together after all this time of doing so. Harry wasn’t sure what he had done wrong, that he had done anything wrong. Nothing too terrible had taken place in their outing to Perth, but Harry certainly felt as though something in their dynamic shifted. He would never voice to Draco that it felt a touch like a date because it was obvious now that his feelings were unreciprocated. Luna had been wrong after all.
“Dorian Locke,” Ron read aloud, as though the subject wasn’t already in the room. “Charged with the murder of Pauline Marchand and already confessed.”
“It’s uncommon,” Draco corrects.
“It’s your name, isn’t it?” Harry replies.
Draco’s eyes widen with surprise, and he pauses for a moment as though considering his options. His eyes track back to the door for a quick second, but he climbs in, Claude jumping out of his grasp to settle by Harry’s feet.
He had never felt so alone while being surrounded by so many people. The party emptied out quickly afterwards. “It’s a Sunday, we have work tomorrow” and “Sorry, the kids are waiting up for us!” were the most common excuses he received. He knew people were leaving because thick tension strained heavily between him and Draco, though, frankly, he didn’t care.
“After the war, when we could finally be together, we rushed things. I know everyone says that jokingly, we moved fast and didn’t take a breath. I used to laugh at it because it was so precisely something we would do. Jump in headfirst without really considering anything else.” He paused, meeting Harry’s eyes, and then staring down at their intertwined fingers. “I was so alone after everything, as I suspect you were too. My parents lived. I’m grateful for that. I know the same can’t be said for so many others. But they were all I had, and then my mother fucked off to a faraway country to escape all this. And my father, who was supposed to be rotting in a cell for the rest of eternity, staged a breakout and disappeared. I don’t blame them, but I felt even more alone than during the war. I went from being smothered with attention and demands to absolutely nothing.”
She had, of course, completed her set of potions before anyone else.
“It’s not your job to fix him,” Hermione had said. “He has to be willing to do the hard work by himself.”
Something was seriously wrong with Harry.
The sun was just beginning its descent over the horizon, and the sky was the colour of a ripe tangerine. Harry thought it was beautiful, but Draco preferred pink sunsets because they were softer and slower.
“You know I’m not an entirely incapable adult,” Harry says, frustrated. “I can cube potatoes.”
showing him something other than apathy or disgust. Harry had already, reluctantly, decided it was best not to administer such a potion again. But if this was the way things could be, it wouldn’t really harm either of them in the end. Draco seemed happier even, like a weight had been taken from his chest. Harry certainly felt like this was a Draco he knew better than the actual one.
Harry shakes his head. “I don’t know if he wants that from me.”
“Wait,” Harry calls abruptly, spinning on his heel.
“The potion doesn’t solely affect the user. It affects the person who administers it as well.” Locke toyed with the sleeve of his robes, and when he looked up, his features were impassive, clinical.
“I think I just want to
“I think being good at everything is stupid,” Harry says. “It’s best to focus on something that drives you and perfect it, instead of trying to do everything all at once.”
Something about being around her brought out a playful side of him that nobody had seen in years. He tried to muster it around Ron and Hermione, but they were too wary of any positivity from him at all nowadays. Draco was a whole different story.
Harry noticed her charcoal eyeliner made her sharp features appear harsher than they probably were, but he disliked her all the same.
Harry and Draco had warded the garden together, ensuring that no matter the season, fruit borne from their trees was perfect.
. Something about that felt ominous, and Harry waited for a sign that maybe Draco would return even a fraction of the feelings he had. That he wanted to be friends, more than friends, outside of their assigned project. No such sign presented itself, and Harry was growing impatient.
“No,” Draco snaps. “It was a party for my friends.”
Harry couldn’t remember Pauline at all from Hogwarts but knew for a fact that she wouldn’t have looked like this then. An unwavering sense of melancholy had replaced her charm. She looked like an addict, with hollowed cheeks and sunken eyes that sat behind the grimmest of smiles to have ever plagued the earth.
After they cleared out, Draco thumbed through the pages of a glossy magazine, before Clove demanded he get his lazy bum out of bed and go for a walk.
“When you first arrived, there was little hope that you were going to make it. Against all odds you pulled through, and we placed you in a magically-induced coma to stabilise your cognitive function and allow your body to heal — to wake up on its own. During this time, we ran some standard tests.” The Healer paused, his eyes imperious.
He stands quickly, the chair rattling against the floor as he pushes it aside, and a crazed laugh escapes his lips.
Harry can barely hear him above the noise, but he watches his lips move. Seamus is saying something about Dean, about his life. He seems happier than the last time they met. Less empty. He watches Seamus mouth something unintelligible before wandering back off the way that he came.
“Er, okay?” Harry said, unable to muster the desire to argue.
“My own magic will betray me?” Harry asks, his voice going a little higher in pitch than he’d like.
“There’s nothing around here for ages, Malfoy,” Harry says, eyes wide. Maybe he didn’t need many people, but what a lonely existence to live. The thought makes Harry’s head hurt more than it should.
“I mean, I had no intention of bringing this up,” Pansy said sharply, turning a blaming eye on Ginny, who waved her away with a hand. “But seeing as my lovely girlfriend has taken it upon herself to stick her nose into places it does not belong, I guess I’ll concede. Ginny, so eloquently, is wondering how you and Draco have managed to repair your relationship. I, on the other hand, am just fine in the dark. This is hardly an appropriate dinner conversation.”
Draco nods. Harry’s getting used to the drastic highs and lows that he seems to have, but wishes, somehow, things could be different. It’s just so hard to see him like this, so numb and reserved, and not himself. He takes a tentative sip of the hot chocolate, smacking his lips gently together as though he’s trying to decide if he likes it or not.
Harry wrapped an arm around Draco’s back before bending down to look at him. His hands were already wet with tears.
Harry felt Oli’s grip drop slowly, and purposefully, to his waist. He swallowed, hoping he wasn’t displaying nervousness so obviously on his face though it certainly felt like it. As Harry walked, pressed closed to Oli’s side, he could practically feel eyes boring into the back of his head. He flushed at the thought of Malfoy seeing him in a compromising position like this.
She leads him into a room that’s bare, with a simple desk and two chairs in the middle. Piled high on the surface are large, though neatly organised, stacks of paperwork filing themselves gently into cabinets that sit to the far right of the space. The woman raises her wand, and the flying papers still. She motions forward for Harry to take a seat as she crosses to the other side and comfortably settles into her chair.
Harry can practically feel Hermione roll her eyes next to him, and Ethel huffs.
“I love you both, but that is too much information for my liking,” she snickers. The look on her face is wiped away immediately as she spots something that makes her face grow cold and surprised. Harry is almost a little afraid to turn around.
The wedding ring Harry toyed with in his fingers fumbled, clattering to the ground and creating an unseemingly sharp noise against the quiet.
“I’m so sorry,” he groaned, weight heavy against Harry. He should have just told the truth. Damn Severus and his mother for relying on shortcuts.
With a sharp crack, Harry Apparated just outside of his picket fence. The dove-white paint had chipped away the winter before, and Harry lacked the enthusiasm to bother repainting it. Harry walked the pathway, stepping on dead plants that crunched unpleasantly between the pavement and the sole of his boot.
Harry fumbles around the drawers for washcloth, reaching out to dab the wetness away from Draco’s head.
not spend the rest of my life around the git just to satisfy some ancient wizarding practise. That hardly seems fair.”
“I’m sure you have a soulmate,” Harry says, pained. “You deserve one.”
“Don’t talk,” Harry says. “Just give it a few moments.”
“I don’t know about that,” Harry says uncertainly, but he takes the pill anyway. Harry hasn’t heard much about the drug, but the name doesn’t make it sound so bad. He knows he is definitely not sober, because only a severely inebriated version of himself would ever accept some sort of mystery drug from Draco Malfoy of all people.
He was so delicate; it made Harry feel strong and possessive in a way he usually didn’t.
“How are they different?” Harry asked faintly. The entire situation felt surreal.
“You’re all set,” the baker interrupted, eyeing the pair of them warily.
“Before there are questions,” Robards began looking pointedly at Harry, Ron, and Delaney, who filled an insufficient number of chairs in the large room. “Auror Patil and Auror Finnegan are safe.”
“What’s wrong?” he asked, concern in his tone.
Harry felt eyes searching over him, attempting to extract some sort of explanation for which he had nothing to offer. Strangely, he felt transported to an interrogation room at the Ministry, and Ron seemed like he was about to tear through his mind with Legilimency or even tip some Veritaserum into his cup.
Draco is doubled over the toilet, eyes closed as shallow breaths puff from his small body. His slender arms wrap around the bowl, clutching the edges like they are a lifeline.
Harry frowns. “That’s really not a smart way to be thinking about things, Draco.”
“What is it, Harry? Why are you so embarrassed of me?” Draco snapped, folding his arms across his chest.
“Your concern.” Harry’s hand caught Draco’s in a crushing grip. “I don’t need you worrying after me. I shouldn’t have to do this to you.”
Harry, unthinkingly, holds up the covers. “Get in.”
Lyra had brought in the paper, which lay untouched on the countertop. Draco filled a glass of water for himself and nabbed a few plums from the fruit bowl. He settled at the table with his afternoon snack and opened the
His words were like a vice grip on Harry’s throat, choking him until constellations erupted before his eyes.
Lavender doesn’t seem to take any offense though, returning her long, manicured nails to Dean’s hair. “Not at all. We agreed quite quickly after we found out. I’m not really interested in men anyway—romantically, that is. I’m actually with Parvati right now.”
“Yes, Mrs Malfoy,” she says, clasping her hands together excitedly, as though she isn’t called often.
Ron seemed as though he were going to mention that it was still early in the morning, but Hermione held him back. Harry disappeared quickly up the stairs, pushing past ogling Gryffindors on the way.
“God, you’re stubborn.” Hermione shakes her head. “Complicated doesn’t necessarily mean bad.”
He waved his wand and muttered an incantation. The spell dissipated, and Harry sat back down pleased.
Harry pulls up a barstool at the island, and Hermione stands across from him, her arms folded over the length of her torso.
“I can do this,” he said to the mirror once more. “This is normal. All couples have rough sex. I look fine.”
The cake in her hands was simple and plain — cream frosting with a mint and vanilla sponge. Harry, in the past years, had always brought Draco a decadent chocolate for his birthday. He wondered if Ginny knew his husband better than he did. It didn’t make him angry, like the way Draco paid more attention to the damn owl, but it did incite a little sadness.
“He’s an Auror,” Pansy quips, swirling a negligible amount of champagne around in a flute.
“As usual.” Harry cut his eggs into bites, hoping his thoughts weren’t painted on his face. He focused on the running yolk instead. When he gathered the nerve to look up, Draco had already moved on to the morning paper.
“Alright, alright,” Locke ceded, turning his gaze on Harry with a wicked understanding. When Ron glanced down at the file to flick to the next page, Locke winked, and Harry’s stomach dropped through the floor. He knew. “I’ll volunteer information without any deal at all, you know.”
But, before he could say another word, a blinding pain erupted from behind the center of his face. He slammed his eyes shut to block off incoming light from the patio doors. He could hear Harry saying his name, but the sound was blurry and distorted as if it were miles away.
Harry caught her arm as she stood from the couch. “Don’t bother honestly, Malfoy tried to argue with her, and it did absolutely nothing.”
“Definitely famed,” Blaise hums in agreement. “They’re massive. You were there?”
Another sharp flash of pain pushed him forward, seeking out every surface of Harry’s skin he could touch to ease the throbbing.
Draco did, even if he wasn’t going to voice it out loud again.
“I can assure you, I wouldn’t want that ever again,” he said, his eyes wide. Harry stepped closer, and Draco placed his hands protectively against Harry’s chest.
“Things like that can get dangerous, you know,” she says, flicking her wand in the direction of her wardrobe. A collection of jumpers emerge from inside and line themselves up dutifully against the wall. “Yellow or pink?”
Harry mulled his words over, almost a little infuriated at how logical Draco sounded. Harry had expected pity but was undeniably relieved at its absence. He let a tight breath out of his chest.
They paused in front of a restaurant with a forest green exterior and large flower basket hanging in the doorway. Gold lettering adorned a wooden sign that swung delicately in the gentle wind. The hinges squeaked as if they were going to give way. It wasn’t exceedingly crowded inside, and Harry figured this was a good thing because they had both forgotten to replace their robes. Draco went in first, and Harry followed behind.
“This is hopeless,” Harry sighed, taking off his glasses and rubbing his eyes. “I’m getting nothing from this at all!”
“Nah.” Seamus shrugged, taking a sip from his coffee. “This is a big one. Top secret and all. Only the
“Well, there’s nothing wrong with his sentencing, right? I’ve served my time quietly. As far as I’ve been informed, Draco has too. I assume we’ve done what has been asked of us?”
Harry should have felt guilty, really. But any regret was overshadowed by a pounding sense of relief that Draco hadn’t been able to leave him yet. He’d take this Draco, the depressive and empty one, over a happy one that wasn’t his to have. Because how could Draco be happy if he wasn’t with him?
He aimed the remote at the box and switched it on.
The question lingers in the space between them for a moment before Harry really lets it sink in. Because honestly, he can’t be sure. It’s easy to say that he’s only doing all of this for his soulmate because that is, truthfully, what he’s been told is required of him. Though now, he’s not so sure. It’s not that he pictures something romantic with Draco, but he can’t deny that there is some semblance of attraction there. Harry feels protective in a way that he's not sure is only a result of their shared connection, and it's beginning to scare him.
“Something’s wrong, Harry,” he said. “There’s a reason why neither of us can control ourselves around each other. There has to be something. Maybe we were cursed or poisoned? Something new, perhaps. I’m surprised I haven’t noticed the signs until now. I was using thistle. It helped me regain control for a moment there.”
Suddenly, the castle feels more confined than it had looked from the outside.
Harry watched the clock, nibbling at the edge of a self-inking quill, as the hand struck eight. The workday had run a bit longer than usual, but Proudfoot had promised him a hard stop hours ago, and he deserved to go home for some rest.
Draco stiffens next to him. “Yeah,” he says, his tone clipped. “But you’re here now.”
Oli fixed his eyes on Harry, and his thoughts were etched across his face. Harry didn’t lean away. Oli licked his lips slowly, and there was something hungry in his expression. “So, Harry. We don’t usually have guys like you coming around here. Must be my lucky day.”
They entered the kitchens to the surprise of a smattering of house-elves. The small creatures were at the boys’ feet immediately, begging to bring them supper or tea. Malfoy allowed for both, and Harry attempted to hide the surprise on his face. He was unaware that they had plans to share a meal together. Harry felt uneasy, especially at the casualness in Malfoy’s tone when he spoke to the elves. He couldn’t help but think of how harsh Lucius was with Dobby and wonder why Malfoy himself wouldn’t reflect those same qualities. It wasn’t as if they were any different.
Harry narrows his eyes. “Didn’t seem like you were too choosy with the guest list, though did it? Are you already getting so tired of your Slytherins?”
“Fuck,” Pansy breathes. “We don’t even have a first aid kit.”
“I don’t feel great.”
Draco makes a sound, curling tighter in on himself.
He passed the mouse to Lyra, who snatched it out of Harry’s fingers eagerly.
“I heard the music,” Harry says. His eyes trace over the elegant curves of the violin. It’s beautiful in Draco’s hands.
Harry turns his head, tears pricking insistently at the corners of his eyes. He exhales roughly, willing them away. Their bodies are still pressed together, warm and pliant in each other’s embrace.
“Yeah,” Ron said, unsettled.
“Can’t hear you, mate!” Seamus calls back, tapping his ears. “Just follow me!”
“What the hell was that for?” He fought the urge to shout as they emerged from the classroom together. He breathed through his nose to maintain composure, but found it slipping from his grip anyway.
made him stay. He had been prepared to leave, his bags had been packed, and he had a private bedroom waiting for him at Ginny and Pansy’s for an indefinite amount of time. He still wondered, worried about what had made him change his mind.
He realizes through gasping breaths that Malfoy is trying to say something and positions the boys head in his lap. He bears a resemblance to a beautiful statue of a Saint, crying out a river of blood. The sight makes Harry’s stomach curdle.
An hour had passed, and Harry was the first to arrive outside of their usual meeting place. He headed inside to grab a table and organize his thoughts onto a paper before Draco could make fun of him for his disorganized process. Another hour passed, and Harry was losing a sense of time as he worked. He found his thoughts wandered to Draco often, but he willed them to go away. Still, he was making good progress, and the large binder they had used to store their notes was growing heavier by the week. McGonagall would be pleased with their progress, though Harry was beginning to doubt she even cared much about the project anymore. She had not bothered to request an update or monitor any of the places they were visiting in the Muggle world. It was most unlike her to leave them to their own devices.
As the anticipation builds, he finds his head clearing just a bit. It feels better to know that he won’t need to force a romantic relationship if he doesn’t want one, but he’ll have to maintain a friendship at least. He hopes it’ll be someone nice, someone sensitive to his reservations too.
“I usually wouldn’t, but I think this needs to be acknowledged,” Ron chuckles. “You’re a right mess.”
“Yeah, we had a particularly tough case today.” Harry knew he couldn’t divulge information about the case at all, but Draco wouldn’t ask anyway. He never did out of respect for confidentiality.
Draco felt desperate and open, and the desire to be filled up with the entirety of Harry was almost overwhelming. He lost himself entirely in the sensations sometimes.
“I never want your tea again, Harry,” Draco whispered, and nervously sidestepped another attempt at physical contact. “I-I’m going to go. Please,
“Darling, you look dreadful.” She smoothed down an unkempt strand of hair on the side of Harry’s head.
,” Harry admonishes. “Who you are now is this kind and caring person that I think I’d do anything for.” The words slip from his mouth before he realises it.
“Don’t touch him,” he growled, shoving the man’s arm away from Draco’s shoulder.
There isn’t an enchanted night sky in the ceiling anymore, and all Harry can see is black. They stay like that for a long time, Harry thinks from the ticking of the grandfather clock on the wall, but it feels like seconds when Draco turns over to look at him. He seems to have cleared his head by just the slightest bit. He doesn’t look better, but he looks like he feels more sober.
Theo frowns. “He’s not having a good morning...”
“Malfoy!”
“Is it that surprising for me to be a voice of reason?” Ginny replies, tucking the next batch of jumpers away.
“Alright.” Ethel takes a final sip of her tea before setting the cup down onto the desk. It clatters roughly against the wood and, for a moment, Harry wonders if the liquid will spill over. “Best to get to it quickly. Just sit still for me, please.”
Draco’s shoulders tighten a bit, and he sits up straighter on the barstool. His eyes remain focused on his bowl. “Not really.”
did you do Harry?" Hermione asked knowingly. She could always read him frighteningly well. But Harry knew he had a miserable excuse for a poker face.
“It’s fine,” Draco says too quickly. “I’m fine.”
“Stop,” Harry bit out, his eyes blurring through tears. He took a few shallow breaths, hoping he could calm himself down, but it was unlikely anything would work. The panic was beginning to cloud him. “You cannot leave me. This isn’t over just because things aren’t as good as before.”
Draco’s gaze followed a long and manicured fingernail across the room to a leather booth cloaked in darkness. He could only make out a faint outline; legs kicked up on a chair as though he were in the comfort of his sitting room. Draco could barely identify any features, but the man was huge. Tall, absolutely, with a menacing and overly-muscled frame.
Draco felt his stomach flip as nausea crashed and crested around him in waves. He could barely see through the pain by the time he opened his eyes and reached for Harry’s fork. Shovelling a bite of eggs into his mouth provided the sweetest relief he had ever felt before.
“With who?” Draco asks instead, skeptically.
“I’m saying
He walks forward slowly, his shoes making contact with the floor beneath him. He’s noticed the bathroom is flooding. The loudest sound in the room is Harry’s heart hammering away frantically in his chest. He wouldn’t be surprised if it gave out right then and there. But he reaches the corner and flattens his back to the wall, forcing a deep breath before coming out from behind it.
the one who hasn’t bothered to change.”
It hit him like a cursed Bludger when he was seated comfortably at his desk with a spread of croissants and danishes at his fingertips. It was at this time that Draco’s stomach would rumble, usually at the sight of such perfectly-baked foods. He’d always had a sweet tooth, while Harry, like a heathen, preferred savoury in the morning. He never wanted eggs as the first meal of the day, but he’d be damned if he was going to ask for something custom-made. Instead, he would forego the meal at home to enjoy a better one in his office.
“That’s one way to describe it.” Harry shakes his head, passing Draco a glass of water from his nightstand. “Do you remember what happened?”
Draco looked ethereal like this, so yielding under Harry’s heavy gaze. He felt in control, powerful, in a way he never had before; relishing the feeling, he closed his eyes at the thought.
“I do.” Harry manages, though his voice is hoarse as if it hasn’t been used in days. He wants to ask how long he has been at St. Mungo’s, but the words escape him once more.
“I know,” Harry said because he did.
“Are you really?” Harry raises an eyebrow, adjusting the basket on his hip.
“I — Harry, um, don’t —”
“How are you liking the party?” Harry asked, a little too hopeful for his taste.
The darkness made it challenging to discern buildings, but they were strikingly similar to Hogwarts. Everything was stony and old and elegant. Harry quite liked it, though Draco was not nearly as impressed as he was.
“So what was that all about?” Ginny asked through a mouthful of pastry. “Honestly, it’s like she wants to be your mother.”
“Stop.” Harry pulls his lips away from Draco’s, wiping his mouth with the back of his shirtsleeve.
“We didn’t—” Harry begins weakly.
The faces around her are bright and encouraging, and Harry feels his heart swell with sadness for Ollie. He has plenty of money to buy her a place or get her by in the meantime.
“You have been in this ward for a week.” Dumbledore offers as if he has read his mind. Harry isn’t all that surprised.
“Lyra, come,” Draco said, and the owl hopped closer to him.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Harry said firmly, digging his heels into the springy ground of the vegetable garden.
The door squeaked uncomfortably on its hinges, and the house was still and silent.
“Somewhere to be?” Lavender asks.
Harry had since visited the apothecary he frequented to see if the man who’d sold him the stuff was still working there. Instead, he was met with a younger woman. She looked to be no older than a teenager, but Harry couldn’t care less when he needed a refill.
Harry knew this was his chance to tell them what had happened. And it would test the strengths of his and Ron’s friendship once more. But Harry was aware that if he couldn’t open up with them now, he never would. He took a deep breath into his chest and told them what transpired the night before.
He entered the kitchen, beelining for the liquor cabinet, which was open more often than not. Without much thought, he selected a square-shaped tumbler that Draco had insisted was elegant and modern when they had purchased it. Harry didn’t much care what their glasses looked like as long as they did the job. He poured himself a substantial amount of Firewhisky, admiring how the auburn liquid curled around the back of his throat like fire. He loved every second of the sweet burn it gave him. He found that physical pain was the easiest to understand than any other.
It was a low blow, Harry knew that. But he also knew it was just what was needed to get under Draco’s skin, to ensure that he’d never leave the house again without Harry’s express consent.
It’s quieter in here, Harry notices, and the sound of thumping music is fading into background buzz. Luna is sitting cross-legged on the counter, organising bottles of alcohol by height and colour.
For a moment there was a pause, and Harry thought Draco hadn’t heard him. But when he went to open his mouth again, Zabini rolled his eyes.
Harry took a wary step back, as Zabini and the unidentified boy turned to look at him too. Zabini snapped his fingers and whispered something under his breath, and the kid bolted back between the walls.  With both of their gazes pouring like heavy concrete over his body, Harry felt especially small.
“Yes, I am.”
“You alright, mate?” Ron says from next to him.
Harry apparated himself to the heart of Edinburgh and was too preoccupied to appreciate its beauty. The city itself was louder and more packed full than Harry could have imagined. Maybe it was due to living in Surrey, but he always expected the Muggle world to be quieter than the Wizarding one. And while it was definitely less chaotic, as things were not flying about or moving on their own, they certainly were not any less crowded. Harry figured it was rush hour, which was why the Aldi’s was chock full, and he practically had to squeeze past two older ladies to get by. They side-eyed him irritably but allowed him to pass through.
“Yes,” Narcissa says, without offering much more of an explanation. Harry doesn’t feel as though it’s his place to push.
“Dinner will be ready in ten,” Blaise says. “I'll call out.”
“I’m not going to ignore it,” Harry says listlessly, “I’m just not going to think about it.”
He probably shouldn’t drink but fuck it. If he is going to see Draco tonight, one drink can't hurt. He nods back at Seamus who gives a toothy grin.
Harry held him as he retched against the hearth, breakfast, and bile coming back up from the pit of his stomach. Draco felt tears wet his neck, but he couldn’t be sure if they were Harry’s or his own.
Even if the potion’s strange magic was raging inside of him and begging him to start a fight, Harry wouldn’t concede just yet. It was important for Draco to maintain a small pretence of reality still. After all, he still didn’t know what was happening, even if he had marginally begun to catch on.
“I don’t want to die,
“I was thinking I could cook you dinner,” Draco says. “As a thank you for the past few weeks.”
, Draco tried, but the words drowned themselves just before reaching the surface.
Instead, he found his lips saying something entirely different.
“Draco,” Harry says low and whispered, but he’s sure Draco hears it perfectly. “I need to talk to you.”
Harry’s almost forgotten that that’s what they’re doing. Dinner together, alone, in the lantern-lit kitchen of Harry’s home. Candles that he has never touched have lit themselves on the countertop. The house knows what it’s doing, and Harry feels nervousness, along with irritation at his betraying home, rise in his chest.
“So what does this mean, then?” Harry had asked, incredulous. “Is he going to be like this forever?”
“He’s hurt. I know you were hurting too, and that’s why you did what you did, but we must think about what this is like for him as well.”
“Why not?” Harry shrugged, pushing his glasses up further on his nose.
Harry takes the cup impulsively and finishes it in one fell swoop. Neville chuckles.
“Tell me later,” he mumbles, and Draco doesn’t respond.
to spend my twenty-fifth playing mediator to goblins all day,” Draco snapped, pushing his plate away. “You don’t understand how vital my position is, how important it is that I —”
“I’d rather he be in prison than dead on our bathroom floor,” Pansy rasps.
“I love him,” Harry says quietly, out into the open room, the only response is the pitter-patter of rain against the window, the sound of Claude scratching unclipped claws at walls by the doorway.
Harry muttered something unintelligible, and the air around him smelled lemony and fresh like cleaning product. Draco’s mouth was dry and cracked when he put his lips back together.
From the front steps of Draco’s bizarre cottage, Harry, despite protests from his body, Apparates directly to the Ministry.
The interview continued like that for a while. Both of Pauline’s family members insisted she would never have done something like this. And while Harry wanted to believe them, he also knew that there was always more to a situation than what meets the eye.
“But I’m not hurting anyone,” Draco begins to argue, distressed. “I just need something to help me forget.”
“You’re good at that,” Draco sniffles.
“I don’t blame you,” Harry says. “I would imagine it’s really hard to take care of anything when you’re in that state.”
“Don’t touch me,” he said, his voice a feeble appeal against the wall of noise surrounding them.
Luna seemed unbothered by the thought. “Naturally, one will argue with the voices in their head ever so often. That is nothing to worry about, Draco,” she said as though speaking to a small child. She presented as very maternal in the moment too.
“Mum’s requesting you,” Ginny says. “Come say hello.”
Narcissa stands tall beside him. She looks proud to be his mother, and Harry can understand exactly why.
Harry takes a deep breath, and then another. He’s not here to pick a fight, and as the reality of the soulmate situation comes back to him, he realises he needs to be on Draco’s good side for the rest of his life and this isn’t a good start.
She didn’t seem like the type.
“No, Draco, I don’t.”
As Harry noticed, Malfoy had cleverly apparated them to the back, so they walked around the front to the entrance of the museum. The structure was even more imposing from the front, but Malfoy appeared uninterested in the exterior. They entered the museum, which was thankfully free of charge. Harry hadn’t thought to bring or even acquire Muggle money, but he was sure Malfoy had somehow already thought through that.
, he just needs to sleep. This will make headlines if we call Healers, and what, with Potter here, too? It’s too messy.”
“We’ll have to do that more often,” Harry says with a chuckle. “Wow.”
It was over in a second, as Draco cried out and felt his release soak the bottom of his t-shirt. Moments later, Harry did the same and pulled himself gingerly out of Draco.
Harry Side-Along’s Draco to his favourite, discreet Apparition point in Diagon Alley, the tug in his stomach settling as his feet touch gently down onto firm ground. Draco looks like he might be sick, and his cheeks are blue in the winter air.
He downed the tea quickly, taking no care in the fact that it burned through his throat.
Draco’s hands shook as he undressed himself and stood naked in front of the mirror. He barely recognised himself in his reflection, forcing a whimper down his throat from where it had risen.
Draco stands first, fuzzy socks slipping against the frictionless hardwood. Harry stands too, feeling a bit like he’s learning to walk for the first time. He reaches a steadying arm out, and Draco meets him on the other side, offering an elbow. Harry holds tight.
If Draco wanted him to have these flowers, Harry figured he knew what that meant. Even if it was a practically unbelievable thought.
Draco couldn’t, though. His mind was wild with panic and rage at being held against his will for something he had never done. His therapist had prescribed antidepressants a number of years ago, but that was all legal. Draco struggled against the group of wizards holding him down, feeling repulsed by the unwanted touch.
Draco squeezed his hand. Harry could only hope that it was his way of saying it back.
There was no way Harry was an addict. Draco would have seen the signs. He would’ve known. Occasionally, Draco would fumble through their bedside drawers for a tissue or pain reliever before bed, and his fingers would always knock into cold glass in their exploration. Dreamless Sleep was an easily identifiable purple, though. Not blue.
“Draco, really, I have no clue what you’re on about. I think we should just go home,” Harry said nervously, fidgeting in his seat.
There’s a sharp pain blooming behind his ribs, and a soft crackle of energy, as something glowing orange and stringy emerges from the middle of his chest and floats itself to Ethel. Harry stares, mesmerised as the coil of light hovers just above the large book.
They stay there, limbs, bodies intertwined for just a moment longer, before Harry reluctantly pulls out, collapsing next to Draco.
Draco’s cheeks were red and flushed, his gasps stuttered by cries of pain and pleasure. It wasn’t long before he was telling Harry to fuck him harder and faster, with blond hair plastered to his sweaty forehead.
The bell jangled in the doorway, and Draco drew his gaze up. His breath caught in his throat.
A merciful smile flickered across Draco’s features for a brief second, before it was replaced by unwavering emptiness. Harry wouldn’t have even caught on if he didn’t recognise the irony of their situation.
“I understand why you were angry. But I want to know why you said what you did.” Harry pushed, feeling the alcohol bubbling uncomfortably in his stomach. There was only so much he could say before setting Draco off. Narcissa had aptly named her son. He was explosive, but Harry didn’t think it was unpleasant. It was just Draco.
Harry chose to have both Ron and Hermione walk him down the aisle, and both of them cry as they do. Ron will never admit it in the future, Harry knows this for sure, but he’s dabbing at his eyes with his shirtsleeves almost as much as Molly is.
“I don’t know.” Draco sighed, pulling himself reluctantly to his feet and holding both peppers in one large hand. Harry couldn’t help but admire the way his fingers stretched over the swollen red. “I felt like it. It’s nice to do something that you just want to do without thinking of the consequences.”
Harry, on a separate countertop, prepared a roast chicken with clementines from the garden. They always found excuses to incorporate the things they had grown into the meals they ate.
He wakes the next morning after only a few hours of sleep and calls off from work.
And there was something different about
Harry sits up in the bed, regretting the decision immediately as his head spins unpleasantly in place. He knows he probably shouldn’t wake the sleeping body next to him, but it’s not someone he recognises immediately, and it sends a jolt of worry through his chest. While he can’t remember much of the night before, he certainly wouldn’t sleep with someone random…
Harry had invited Draco to Christmas quite last minute when it became clear he didn’t have any concrete plans. He had, in all honesty, expected Draco to decline the offer. But Pansy and Theo were going to their respective families and Draco, in his own words, couldn’t bear to be around more old family ties than necessary. So, Harry had invited him in the hopes that he would actually come, but with distinct expectations that he wouldn’t.
“How flattering,” Draco deadpans.
“Harry,” Hermione groans. “You don’t have to
“Good evening to you too, Parkinson.” Draco laughed, hiking his coat up over his shoulders in the chilly winter air.
“Okay, alright, Weasley!” Draco held his hands up in surrender. “You win. I will not have my office become the site of a juvenile food fight.”
“I’m not!” Harry says earnestly. “I genuinely think so. I really enjoy spending time with you.”
There’s a moment of silence then, as Harry listens to both of them breathing together, watching the rise and fall of Draco’s chest underneath the blanket. His face is going blue in the cold.
“I know.”
Draco continued, “Still, I thought Muggles were supposed to be nice enough.” He wrinkled his nose.
“Yes.”
“Oh, Merlin.” Harry let out a pleased hum, rutting gently against him, thickening cock pressing into the space between Draco’s legs.
Still, he hadn’t actually seen Harry since he’d left him behind in their garden.
“Sure, but we better make it quick. I don’t know when Draco will be home, and I should get started on setting up,” Harry said, but they changed direction to the pub anyway.
As they make their way towards the door, Harry feels a certain sense of unease cloud his stomach. He had intended to come to the Manor and get the job done; in other words, he’d prepared himself for the uncomfortable conversation and subsequent repercussions. Now he’s at a loose end, unsure of where to go next, and if he should pursue Draco despite Narcissa’s strange warnings.
“I apologise for waking you then,” Draco says. He places the instrument gingerly on the desk and steps away as though the distance makes a difference.
What kind of Malfoy was if he just let himself deteriorate? Draco’s pride was a wily beast when it was allowed outside of its cage.
“What would you have done in there if I hadn’t intervened?” Harry asked, eyes hungry and demanding, something like Carrow’s.
“Harry, where are you going?” Hermione asked suspiciously, concerned at the expression on his face.
“Oi, Harry!” Neville called, as he approached the grounds too.
“I’m not sure what that means,” Harry says nervously. “Like it’ll get angry?”
“The ends justify the means,” Harry told a particular chocolate cosmo as he clipped weeds away from its stem. He gave it an affectionate pat on its petals, moving to the next one down the line.
Harry lets out a laugh, hanging up his coat on the rack. “I did warn you they’d be a lot.”
“What,” he says, eyes widening. “Come off it.”
Ginny snorted in laughter. “And even apart from the whole sickly pale thing you have going on, you’re just dreadfully skinny. A wizard straight out of the 14th century!”
“Want to buy me breakfast?” Draco asks cheekily, as they exit the basement. “I’m thinking eggs and bacon, baked beans, and something entirely too greasy to be beneficial to our cardiovascular health.”
“We can’t apparate back.” Harry found himself saying, “we’re too drunk.”
“Tastes like nothing.” Draco smacks his lips with displeasure.
They kiss to seal their bond, and it’s like their cores strain through their chests, aching to be pressed together forever, as close as they can be. Harry finds it hard for himself to pull away but doesn’t particularly feel like putting on a show for their audience.
Harry scoots closer so that his knee bumps into Draco’s.
Ron, instead, was fascinated by them in an instant. “What did you say these flowers were called again?”
“Darling?” A voice startled Draco away from his thoughts.
Harry’s mind goaded him, encouraging a behavior he would never dare in any other moment but this one.
“Draco, I-I can’t breathe.” He heaved as the world spun dizzyingly around him. Harry sucked in a deep breath through his lungs, but faltered. Everything was tightening and compressing and squeezing inside of him.
Harry shivers as his dragonhide boots make imprints in the snow-buried walking path of Malfoy Manor.
Before Harry can reply, the door creaks open, and Theo enters with a few bowls in his hand. He kicks the door shut with a bare foot and stumbles over to the bed, climbing onto the mattress with all the grace of a Hippogriff foal.
Draco found himself slightly disappointed in how little he knew about himself these days.
“Nonsense!” A boy named Noah called happily, from across the table. “We’ve made new friends, let’s toast to that.”
“Er, I actually might be busy tonight.”
They laughed together, and Harry felt warm.
“Wandless magic,” Draco says, taking a tissue and dabbing gently at his eyes. “I’ve always wanted to master something like that. Ever since I was a kid my father always told me I had to be the best at every subject.”
“My office is just around the corner, I have dittany and healing potions there,” Harry says. "Doesn't that sound tempting?"
She forced Harry to stand, shuffle over, and open the window so she could fly out. Only she didn’t. Instead, turning a disdainful eye, she preened against the autumn air as if to say,
If that wasn’t permission to defy Harry outright, he didn’t know what was.
“What do you think?” Theo sneers, but there isn’t much anger behind the statement. He seems more tired and irritated than anything serious.
Harry pauses for a moment. It would be the poorest time to tell Draco the real reason and would undoubtedly cause a rift in what seems like a tolerable relationship. He looks at the ground, pushing a stray pebble around with the tip of his boot. Somehow, the question sobers him.
“There has, unfortunately, been an incident involving Imperioserum. We know the last few weeks have been quiet. Delaney and Ms Granger have reported rare instances of use. If this substance is more widespread than we thought, it seems to be moving through different channels. It might be more present within quieter sectors of society than we initially hypothesised.”
Harry doesn’t dare move. He’s not sure how it happens, but he finds himself on the ground, letting the blood and water envelop him. His arms are curled possessively around Malfoy’s body. He will
“Oh, not much, just admiring the talent.” Harry tipped his glasses onto the bridge of his nose and pointedly raked his eyes over his husband’s body.
Draco closed his eyes, consciously missing the way Harry said his name. Like it was the most beautiful thing in the world.
Draco felt relieved. Safe.
“Ginny,” Draco tested out once more, rolling the word around his tongue. She looked up casually from the magazine.
Neither of them heard the familiar click, and Harry took his own wand out. “
“Well you know how you and Voldemort had twin cores in your wands. It’s kind of like that, but with people.”
Cooking had always been relaxing to Harry. Something about chopping vegetables and drizzling olive oil and stirring things in a pan was soothing and formulaic. Draco always liked using his wand, letting foods chop themselves. It was reminiscent of the Burrow in some ways, when Harry would return home and see Draco sprawled out at the table while sliced bread floated itself into the Muggle toaster. Harry never cared much for the magic of cooking, though it was fascinating to watch. He preferred to have control over the ingredients himself.
Still, although everyone seems to know that Harry hasn’t found his match yet, it worries him more than he’s willing to admit.
Maybe he could sneak off to the bathroom or pretend illness. What would Shacklebolt say if the Saviour of the wizarding world didn’t want to take part in what otherwise might have been the most compelling case of the decade? Harry knew if his heart were in it, things would pick up speed because he wanted them to. A part of him wished he could provide that for the potion victims and for the department, who wanted to solve it just as badly.
“You know I’m only saying this because I love you.”
Ron stood awkwardly in the entryway with a file in his hand.
“It wasn’t?” Draco asks, his interest piqued. He finally sets the book aside.
“Listen,” Harry says sternly then. “I need to tell you something, but do you pinky promise you’re sober?”
“We’re not involved!” Harry bit out, almost hurt by the truth of his statement.
It was one of the warmer summer nights they’d had when Harry stepped outside of the Ministry and into the unusually light streets of London. The sun hadn’t set yet, casting a faint yellow glow over everything in sight. It was beautiful to see the city so warm and inviting like this, and sometimes Harry wondered what it would be like to live away from the country. But then again, if they did, friends would visit much more often.
“Draco is different from how he used to be when he was younger.”
And for a moment, only the crackling fire makes noises in the room, accompanied by the forced sounds of Harry’s desperate breath. His head feels tight, still leaden with stress and exhilaration. He always recalls the chase as enthralling, but this one had been too close.
“Get out,” Draco repeats coldly. “It’s laughable that you think we’ll ever be friends in this lifetime.”
Pansy catches her bottom lip in her teeth, and she looks too scared for Harry not to start panicking. “He’s always like this the morning after,” she says, “but I think he might’ve taken something bad. He always sleeps it off, or at least is responsive when we talk to him.” She wrings her hands.
And then it hits Harry quickly, a touch of sadness that he can’t quite seem to pinpoint the reasons for. He stands with it for a moment, feeling confused and disoriented, before neglecting to put on his trousers, pretending not to notice as Pansy and Theo snicker at his behind. He stumbles out of the room in boxers and a t-shirt, peeking in various doors of the small, dark hallway.
, the voice directed, though it was unusually more gentle than Harry’s words.
He turned gently, a soft glance thrown over his shoulder.
Harry let his eyes fall to Draco’s hand, where it was stationed gently on his thigh.
“I am.”
“The symptoms he has described are extremely common among those suffering from depression. You told me that he has a hard time taking care of himself, doing the bare minimum. Not to mention that he rarely gets out of bed.” She had shrugged, as though resigned to the diagnosis. “When I spoke to him, he told me that his bed was where he felt the safest.”
His hands were growing shaky from the pent-up anger and emotion inside himself, and he would break soon. Draco knew it too because he was turning a beet red, and his hands were trembling more than they usually did at the dinner table.
Somehow, Harry had convinced him to go on a morning run, followed by a quick ab workout. Draco was not spending his Saturday curled up on the couch with a book and his owl, so he figured the day was already ruined.
Draco blushes and Harry kisses his cheeks where they’ve coloured.
“It’s like a drug, you see. You’ll be ruthless. Merciless. Overindulgent. I suppose you know that there is already a little something dark in the back of your mind. It’ll tell you to do depraved things. Of course, you can always decide if you want to listen or run.”
“Mr Malfoy, please stay still or I’ll have no choice but to sedate you.” The Healer spoke in a calm and even tone that upset Draco further.
sorry!” Harry cries, his body quivering with emotion and helplessness. He screams for help until his voice goes raw, but it is becoming clear that no one can hear him.
“What?” Harry’s eyes snapped up, bewildered.
He watched Draco go, admiring the lean lines and sharp angles of his body. Pale skin flushed and red against the sticky summer heat.
“Not that it’s any of your business, but I’m checking in with my Auror.”
He follows behind Draco down the staircase, noticing it takes them an exceptionally long time to get to the bottom. Harry’s unsure how, after the night he’d had, Draco’s even able to walk, let alone manage to take himself home. But he reminds himself again that he’s not Draco’s keeper. He’s not allowed to be worrying as much as he is.
Harry scrambles for a notebook, a piece of stray parchment, anything really. In the end, he manages to locate a paper receipt from a Muggle convenience store he’d visited just the other day for a quick snack. Scrambling through his bedside drawer for a self-inking quill and finally locating one, Harry copies down the address before he can forget it, sticking it directly into his wall with a push-pin Sirius had used to hang up his posters.
Now, hearing the clanging of pots and pans as Harry struggled to summon the right one was oddly endearing.
A part of him knew what had to be done. If it meant pain, then Draco would endure.
“It was busy. Proudfoot and I caught a domestic abuse case.”
The corner of Draco’s mouth gives a slight upturn. “I wouldn’t be falsely accusing you if I did say that.”
Ron and Hermione leave his place soon after the conversation, once Harry promises he’s not just going to sit on this new, terrible piece of information and wait for something bad to happen. He’s absolutely certain that he won’t be ready to tell Draco about the soulmates thing any time soon, but he knows something significant needs to change if he wants to keep both of them alive.
He extracted himself from Draco almost clinically, gathering his clothes without a second glance in his direction and stalking off to the bathroom for a shower.
She angled her Prefect’s badge toward Harry. He’d forgotten entirely that McGonagall appointed her, though it made sense. Luna was as fair and responsible as any Ravenclaw.
The smell of their bedroom was something that always stood out to Harry after he’d been gone all day and had forgotten entirely what they’d let their lives become. It wasn’t bad at all, citrusy and tangy in the way that Draco usually was, but it was also rich. Sharp in the air, cutting against the skin.
It had been a while since they’d had guests over for anything other than a strictly planned birthday celebration.
“It’s very interesting, sir. Something I’ve never seen before in all my time here.” The shopkeeper drew up his frame to match Harry’s height, squinting his eyes at him in a familiar way. “Say, do I know you —”
“I’ve been having trouble with some voices in my head,” he said a little quickly, before catching his tongue between his teeth to stop the words.
“Listen, Draco,” Harry starts.
Harry frowns, pricked by a statement he knows means no harm at all.
Draco, with an encouraging hand, pulls him back down into his arms. “I want you,” he says. “I trust you.” Words Harry never expected to hear spoken from his lips.
“Hot chocolate?”
Harry makes an exasperated sound, and Draco only laughs.
Draco retrieved his phone again, this time dialling Pansy. The novelty of just speaking to someone for no reason still hadn’t worn off.
“Hermione, this is a joke, there must have been an error in the system. Help me out here,” Harry pleads, frowning at the two of them.
“Is something the matter, Potter?” His eyes flicked between the magazine in his hands and back to Harry.
“I can do what I want,” he said, and Harry suppressed a chuckle at the irony of his statement.
, Harry wants to say, but he doesn’t. Because it is unfair of him to assume that Draco will change for him, even if it’s ultimately for the better.
“You have your own office,” Draco remarks.
“Did you tell him?” Ron asks, coming over to sit in the chair across from Harry’s desk. He begins to fiddle with the collection of chocolate frog cards on the surface, just to do something with his hands.
“Just getting some tea,” Harry said, and the moment the words left his lips, they both winced.
“What was that all about?” Zabini asked quietly, but Harry was still well within earshot.
He fingered the blue vial of the other mysterious potion, and thought back to the stranger of the apothecary.
Draco’s wearing a pair of clubmaster eyeglasses, but from behind the frames, Harry can barely see any silver. His pupils are dilated to the point of almost black.
The week passed in a blur of classes and commotion, but Malfoy was an expert at avoidance. They only had potions together for the term, and Harry figured this was McGonagall’s doing, considering she was already forcing them to spend more of their time together working on the project. Dumbledore wouldn’t have even spared him that. During morning lessons, Harry found himself trying to catch Malfoy’s eye, but the boy always rushed from the classroom as though there were something urgent he needed to attend to. His Slytherin groupies followed close behind, and Harry refused to go near them. They still convened at the Three Broomsticks after class, but Malfoy routinely cast silencing charms around himself as they poured over previous Muggle studies textbooks. Harry could never get a word in edgewise. What started as pure annoyance on Harry’s part was turning into outright fear. He worried Malfoy would never speak to him again.
“A friend of mine at the Ministry. She’s not affiliated with my department, but I think she could really help you,” Harry says earnestly.
my school bully! I was not bullied!”
“I never said you were —”
“You’re not, Ron. I mean, you know the last thing I’d want to do is spend so much time with him.” Harry sighed, contemplating how he was going to explain this adequately without being shouted at. “But I just don’t have the energy to argue with anyone about anything right now. I’d rather just keep my head down.”
He doesn’t quite know what to say and opts for, “You can call me Harry.”
“You followed me,” Harry stated, without bothering to defend himself.
Immediate concern flashes across Narcissa’s features before it is schooled back into careful nonchalance. “He’s not dead, is he?”
was the real thing. Even still, Harry couldn’t believe what he had just done. A voice in the back of his mind screamed at him to let Draco go.
“Harry, I know this may be a strange request, but I was hoping I could ask you for a favor?”
“Get on with it then,” he said, sliding his wedding band around his finger. An unpleasant feeling caught in his throat, like the one he felt just before he sicked up after a particularly drunken night out — pure anticipation.
was quite obviously more dependable. It retained the added benefit of lacking in mention of Harry or himself respectively. Still, the breaking headlines stood out to Draco like fiendfyre, and he wondered how neither of them had caught a glimpse of it at the breakfast table. Maybe Harry had and declined to mention it. To be fair, their minds had been elsewhere.
Ron silences her with a concerned look.
“Sure,” Draco said, noncommittally.
He tried again.
“You know, when I came here, I expected a cup of tea and some biscuits.” Ron groaned, but followed Harry’s lead, cutting away at anything and everything.
He wondered if he had really just agreed to stay with Harry or if he was trapped inside a fever dream of his own making.
Ron smiled though, hooking his arm casually around Hermione’s waist. “I’m sure of it.”
Draco flushed a rosy pink, and bent forward to press his lips against Harry’s forehead in response.
As he meets Draco under the archway, the flowers somehow seem to bloom brighter. Luna stands just behind them, wrapped in cornflower blue robes, a flower crown braided down into her flowing blonde hair.
“Ron, wait, stop!”
Draco allows a soft moan to escape his lips, but it sounds more like a gasp for air than anything substantial. He lazily opens one eye, and then the other.
“Hard day?” Draco spoke again, his cheek pressed firmly into the curve of Harry’s collarbone. So uncharacteristic.
Draco took control, tugging at Harry’s cock with a few lazy but deliberate strokes.
He figured it hurt so badly because his subconscious knew that was how Harry would feel if Draco were to be successful.
“Yes, I’m fine. Don’t worry about me,” Draco said, choosing his words carefully. Nothing negative, he reminded himself, though he knew it wouldn’t last long.
It hurts him to see Draco letting himself waste away.
“I spent so much time watching you in the Great Hall, Draco. I just knew.”
Narcissa pauses for a moment, cocking her head to one side in confusion. “As far as I know,” she begins joylessly, “he hasn’t bothered to find out.”
Draco’s cold gaze turned frosty at that, “We can take care of ourselves, Harry. We don’t need you to swoop in and save the day all the time. You don’t have to unload your entire guilt complex on me, and if that’s why we are friends, then I don’t want to be anymore.”
But in some ways, Harry’s tired of making headlines.
Harry came seconds later, growling at the pressure and squeezing tighter around Draco’s small body. When he removed his hands from his husband’s neck, purple fingerprints formed an alarming circle on ivory skin.
That grabs Draco’s attention, and he turns back to face Harry.
It’s been a couple of weeks since he’d received the news, and Harry has already begun to feel the effects of being apart from Malfoy, whether he is going to admit to it or not. He’s come down with a terrible cold and fever, which he is sure isn’t from the bad weather, since he’s been at home or at the office for most of his days. The following week, he had been sent out on a surveillance job; he’d merely tripped down a flight of stairs and shattered several bones as a result. The Healer who had mended them remarked that his bones were entirely too brittle for someone of his age and wanted to order more tests out of urgent concern. Harry had refused, knowing what was causing his sudden deterioration, even if he wasn’t ready to admit it out loud.
The front garden is cramped at best and feels even more claustrophobic due to overgrown plants, weeds, and flowers that litter the small planter boxes haphazardly interspersed amidst the mossy cobblestone patio.
“Don’t lose him because you’re scared,” Hermione whispers, and then leaves it at that.
He fails to notice when Snape and McGonagall enter the bathroom. Snape is absolutely silent, but his face contorts painfully, his hand reaching up to clutch at his chest. McGonagall gasps audibly, and her wand clatters to the tiled floor. The professors attempt to reach the body but find themselves blocked by an invisible but resistant wall. Harry has cast a
something.”
“Ha,” Draco smiles. “That obvious?”
He climbs them slowly, taking care to balance himself on the railing. When he reaches the landing, there’s hardly any light except for some that seeps out from under the crack of the first door he sees.
a voice echoed in the back of Harry’s head. He barely paid attention to it as he claimed Draco’s lips once more, kissing down his neck and spinning them around, so his husband was pressed back against the counter instead.
Harry found himself growing defensive, but forced a deep breath because he wanted his best friend, of all people, to understand. “Not that you bothered to take any notice, but the war changed all of us. There’s no point in going back to the way things were before! I’m tired of pointless rivalries, all for what? If this is how you’re going to act, then it seems like
Music, a warm and cosy mix of acoustic sounds in the air, swells in the background as Fleur plays her lyre, and Percy strums gently at his guitar.
“I didn’t know you lived here,” Harry says, and while he’s talking about the castle, he means Romania, in general.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said, more forcefully than he meant to.
He’d thought through the decision for a while before asking for the business card of Azalea Otter’s contact information. Harry knew, through various drug-related incidents and offences he’d been assigned to, that there was often a type of social worker and liaison that helped with recovery options. Ron had told him not to involve himself like this just yet, but Harry couldn't help it. He’d been growing increasingly worried, and while Draco’s demeanour seems to be happy and light now, his body has been showing signs of wear like it never has before.
Harry looked up from his coffee, startled. “Christ, Ron, it’s only a meeting.”
“We always have to be in shape because of the fitness retests.” Harry reached out a hand, which Draco grasped reluctantly. He groaned at the pressure between his joints as he heaved himself onto sore legs.
A chorus of stiff and awkward hi’s and hello’s greet Draco back, and despite how small he is, he sinks further into the cushions. For a moment, Harry wonders if this was a bad idea.
“I think life is just really hard,” Draco says, composed. “But what matters at the end of the day is how well you treat yourself, and how the people around you treat you. Harry will never admit to it, but he’s taught me what loving someone unconditionally means, because he does it so thoughtlessly and so easily, every single day. I worked hard for my sobriety, but I would be remiss not to mention the man who stood by me at the peak of my addiction and through my first, and hopefully last, relapse. So, I just want to say thank you.”
Draco narrows his eyes, and suddenly they look a lot crueller than they did the evening before.
As Harry reaches for the door handle, Narcissa clears her throat.
Harry startled, turning to face Draco. “You what?”
There it was. The truth.
“Let’s go.” Harry stood, pulling his cloak from the chair.
She’s dressed in beautiful, simple olive-green robes, her hair braided up into a bun, no strand of blonde out of place. She clasps her hands together in front of her, and Harry feels as though he’s about to be scolded by a professor. But her change in expression is quick as she relaxes into the environment. The thin, tight line of her lips curves upward, into what Harry can only call a willing smile.
Harry draws him up from where he’s curled into his lap, wanting to look him in the face when he says it.
“That’s my name.”
“But their lives are so much more complicated.”
Harry walked out of the room, making sure to avoid the floorboards to the left of the door, which protested loudly whenever they were stepped on. He had quite liked the personality of their magical house, and something had reminded him distinctly of the Burrow. But now, not so much.
Draco attempted. Even if the words had been spoken from his lips, he knew it wouldn’t help.
He had always been unable to hide his emotions from Pansy, so he didn’t bother much with it anymore. If he had said he was fine, Pansy would’ve smacked him decidedly across the head until he revealed the truth. She could always see through him like he was as transparent as a pane of glass. Harry felt bare and uncomfortable in her presence, but he also welcomed her company. It was nice to know that she knew the real him and not the million other versions that existed to the rest of the world.
He never lasted long when Harry prepped him like this. He groaned heavily into the pillow when Harry’s tongue licked back and forth over him before pressing just the slightest bit inside. Draco instinctively spread his legs further, pushing back into the touch. He cried out when Harry’s tongue left him, but was flushed with a hot sensation as he felt two lube-covered fingers press inside of him.
They entered the museum, passing through metal detectors at the front. Malfoy looked confused but followed behind Harry, emptying their items in the plastic bin. The security guard stared at the foreign currency suspiciously, but she let them through anyway as if to say she didn’t want an explanation. Soon enough, they were inside.
“But why were you an–” Harry began but abruptly cut himself off as Malfoy shot him a glare.
was still hardly the most reliable source in the wizarding community. In fact, Luna’s
“I did, but I was informed the potions were never picked up.”
He wondered, humourlessly, if most people felt that way around him.
Sometimes, Harry felt like Robards and the Minister were actively keeping him on the case for a show of good faith, even if that meant he wasn’t tasked with anything significant to force a breakthrough. When they finally cracked it, his name would be right there on the
“I will hear
“Oh.”
Harry hated how absolutely reasonable Draco sounded.
“I want to see Harry,” Draco said through gritted teeth.
Once the Mediwitch moved away, the stony-faced Healer turned back to face him. “Do you remember why you’re here, Mr Malfoy?”
“It’s nice,” Harry says.
They sat in silence for a minute, as Harry softened inside of Draco, but neither of them dared to move. If they moved, they’d have to acknowledge what had just happened. Finally, minutes later, Draco clambered off of Harry’s lap. They dressed in silence.
“What exactly will it do?” Narcissa asked, amassing the room’s attention.
“Oh, you take that back,” Draco growled, but it was all good fun. He wasn’t sure when the last time sunshine had shone down upon their relationship like this.
Harry was so flustered, and he could feel his face turning red and a bulge pressing through his pants. He willed himself to stop thinking about Draco because this was neither the place nor the time. He combed through the aisles again, taking notes and observing different Muggles, immersing himself in the research as a means of distraction. He found it interesting that Dudley had consumed so much milk as a child and noted that many of the shopping carts were filled with it. Harry couldn’t clearly remember Petunia letting him have any after a point. He never liked the stuff that much anyway, it made him feel like a baby.
Draco broke contact first, and his expression was wary. “You left me alone.”
As Harry steps out into the frigid winter air, he feels the paper wet and the address mar against raindrops petering down from the sky. He barely registers himself walking the long length of the grounds and edging past the wrought iron gates before he’s Apparating directly into his bedroom, tearing through wards with a loud pop.
Harry doesn’t know how to answer. He owes it to Draco to tell him, to reassure him that he’s not all alone in the world, and there actually is someone out there who wants him more than anything. Because if there’s one thing Harry’s willing to admit to himself now, it’s that he wants Draco. And he wants him in a way that is growing far past physical attraction.
“What’s going on?” Draco asks warily, his eyes locked on Harry’s.
“Really?” He asked, walking up to a bust that was strikingly beautiful. He wanted to reach out and drag his finger along the delicate arch of its nose. The docent at the door glared at him, and Harry took a deliberate step back in surrender.
Harry’s face pinched, fear trespassing upon that mask of calm. “Shit.” He stood, stepped down, and began pacing the length of the foyer. “Fuck. Oh, Merlin.” He laughed, long and drawn out, crazed in a way that made Draco queasy.
“Why are you here, Harry?”
An affectionate laugh escaped Harry’s throat. “Your wife is much better at this than you are.”
“Don’t be so stubborn,” Harry groans. “You’re going to bleed all over a Muggle grocery store, that can’t be sanitary or safe. And don’t tell me you’re alright with letting your face scar up like that.”
He’s heard of them before through various cases he’s worked at the department. “Sounds like that could be something that is really useful for you,” Harry says carefully, testing the waters. It’s still challenging to know what might make Draco snap.
“Can’t remember.”
Harry, mortified, looks up to meet the pale and angry face of Draco himself. Draco’s lips crease into a thin line, and he glowers down at Harry. Now that they’re standing in front of each other, Harry realises how much shorter he is in comparison.
This Draco was not his, and it was becoming clearer by the day.
Draco turns away, and he seems to stiffen on the settee, eyes glazing over with apparent disinterest. If Harry knows him at all, he’ll turn the conversation back around. He’ll deflect. It doesn’t matter that they’ve spent the better part of ten years apart. That they’re both pushing thirty, and haven’t bothered to reconcile because it just doesn’t matter anymore.
The power Harry held was inconceivable.
“Please, can I kiss you now?” he asks. “I
Harry feels something clench in his chest. “Everyone remembers a happy ending.”
“Everything
“What the fuck,” Harry says. “Who did this to you?”
In the weeks that Draco had been in the hospital and the potion had worked itself out of his body, Harry had been met with a withdrawal of his own. Locke’s words had stuck with him for some time. He knew the potion had influenced his emotions, fixated on his temper and amplified it. Sobering up from it had been an intense shock.
Carrow’s burly fingers brushed over the outline of Draco’s cock from underneath the table. It jumped underneath his touch, but Draco willed it to settle.
“It’s complicated,” Harry says quietly, unsure if he’s ready to divulge any information to Narcissa just yet. If it would help him access Malfoy, then maybe, but he’s not entirely certain how she’ll react to the news.
He cleared his throat instead and beckoned Ron over with one hand. He approached awkwardly as Pansy gathered her things and made a swift exit. She gave Ron an affectionate pat as she passed him but didn’t bother to say goodbye.
Afterwards, the group congregates in the sitting room to open presents. Harry unintentionally receives more than he gives, as usual, and insists that no one get him anything the following year. This statement never goes over well, and Molly promises him a lifetime of presents to make up for the Dursleys. Draco receives presents too, which neither he nor Harry really expected.
Harry stumbled into bed that night, confused. Being with Draco had been incomparable to anything he had ever experienced before. He had never known love and lust so intertwined like that. It was as if everyone else had been practice, and this,
“Aesthetics, I would consider as clothing and style in terms of, well in terms of anything really. For example, home decoration or fashion.” Malfoy jotted notes down on his pad as he went, and Harry was stone-faced watching him work. “While culture, I would categorize as arts and literature. Music too.”
“I don’t need you to buy things for me,” Draco frowns.
Hermione nods, and Harry feels his heart clench painfully in his chest. It's not an entirely fair or true thought and is one he'll never voice aloud, but he often wonders why things always seem to be so easy and straightforward for them when they can be so painfully hard for himself.
Draco’s room is minimal, similar to the rest of the house. What catches Harry’s eye is not the obnoxiously green bedspread or the sheer amount of books in the room that could easily rival Hermione’s collection. It is a portrait of medium size that hangs on the wall across from his bed. A blonde boy of maybe ten or eleven plays with a small dog in the frame.
“There were extremely high, practically lethal doses of an unknown potion in your system. Your husband may have missed the signs, but our tests cannot hide the reality of your situation.”
Luna, used to his honesty, merely shrugged. “Are you sure something
“Alright,” Harry agrees.
Harry artfully dodges, kicking off his trainers and putting his feet back up on her mattress. It’s a Friday evening, and there isn’t much for him to do. Ron and Hermione have designated it a date night, and Harry’s hard-pressed to intervene in their domestic bliss. He’s not bitter at all. Really, not at all. He’s happy for them with every fibre of his being, but if there was one week he could’ve used a pub night with the two of them, it would’ve been this one.
Harry picked him up and eased him gently onto the bed as though he were as light as a feather. Draco’s eyes met Harry’s, and he couldn’t deny the intensity, the passion that remained between them. It was why they had sex despite all the fighting. Sometimes it was the only way Draco felt like their relationship was still alive and kicking.
“Oh, Draco,” Harry gasped, steadying himself with one hand against the cabinet and another tangling fingers gently into Draco’s hair.
“Harry, this won’t work.” Draco gestured at the space between them. “We can barely go a day without dramatics. What kind of relationship would that be?”
Harry smiles as they enter the Ministry lobby. He’s not even thinking about the camera flash when he pulls Draco close and pecks him right on the mouth.
Draco joined him minutes later, wrapping one of Molly’s knit blankets over Harry’s shoulders.
“I guess not,” Harry admits, toying with a loose strand of thread on his jeans. “Will you at least come with, so I don’t have to go to this thing alone?”
She waves at Harry from the doorway.
Harry blinks a couple of times, letting his eyes adjust in the blackness. “Are you okay?”
Carrow plastered on that same smile in front of him.
“Thank you,” Draco smiles. “If there’s anything I can do to help in the kitchen, Harry can attest to the fact that I’m not a terrible cook.”
“She doesn’t call you Master,” Harry observes before he can stop himself. He curses himself for speaking without thinking.
“Can you give us the room?” Harry asks the group surrounding Draco sternly.
intentionally overdose, and you’re struggling with your mental health. That’s not to say you won’t get better and grow from this experience, but it is the reality of your situation.”
“Has he?” Harry replies breathlessly, taking a sip of his drink. It tastes foul, though he’s never loved alcohol anyway.
“So?” Luna prompted, quirking an eyebrow in his direction.
He couldn’t remember the last time they touched without violence anymore.
The room went dark.
“Now, can I ask you something?”
“How the fuck do you do this every day?” Draco asked, bending down to tie his trainers. He ended up sitting down for a rest anyway, cross-legged on the concrete pavement.
“I know.”
“I’ll come with you,” Draco said hurriedly at the voice’s mercy, floating dishes to the sink and setting them to clean. He was surprised when Harry neglected to protest.
Harry resists the urge to make a scene, but he glowers at her in response.
Draco stood over the sink, hands clasped around the corners. He aimed a fierce
It was no secret that Malfoy had left London soon after the war. He stayed for a while, as many Death Eaters had chosen to. To be close to the Ministry, to prove they weren’t planning on crossing another line. But, as Harry knew all too well, crimes against former members of the dark side were hardly regarded as crimes at all. London still is, and may always be, too dangerous.
Harry’s breath catches in his throat. “When will you realise that all I want is you?”
Draco’s hand comes up to cover his mouth. “You’re not—”
him to wait. It’s a right mess. The goblins are up in arms, and I have to head over to prevent any further uprising.” Draco shrugged, still paging through the first few articles of the
Draco relaxes a bit at the explanation, but he still refuses to draw his gaze back up. “I know,” he reassures. “I’m doing this for myself, first and foremost.”
Harry climbs down from the ledge.
Harry knew he should’ve felt remorse, or even the slightest inkling of guilt, especially when confronted so viscerally with the products of his actions. The feelings didn’t come through. The magic in his veins buzzed excitedly at eliciting any and every adverse reaction from Draco. It fed off of his pain and misery and redirected the energy toward Harry instead.
It’s a rainy Christmas morning, not quite cold enough to snow, and the Burrow is glowing a warm orange from the inside out. Harry’s always loved Christmas here; it feels nice to be surrounded by family. It’s strange because he relishes the small arguments, the bickering, the debating that comes with the Weasleys and their Christmas Days. Everyone is just happy to be here, despite all the sibling rivalry.
Ron agrees, sniffling, his arm tightly hooked into Harry’s as though he’s reluctant to let go. “Best mates for life, yeah?”
“A thing,” Greg squawked, flustered. “Don’t be daft, Draco. She’s
Proudfoot caught him eyeing the clock like a meal. “You can go now, Harry.”
Harry slides down to the ground, leaning his back heavily against the sink cabinet. He hugs his sweatshirt tighter over his body as he sits down on the tiled floor. The first few weeks of January are always especially cold.
It feels strange that Draco Malfoy would be throwing a party in his home, and that Seamus would be in attendance. As Harry gets further inside, he is surprised to see various familiar faces: the Patil twins chug something from red cups in the corner, both of their arms hooked around, of all people, Astoria Greengrass. Lavender and Dean sit hazy-eyed, tucked up next to each other on the couch, enraptured by Millicent fucking Bulstrode recounting some sort of tale that elicits quite a reaction from her audience. Goyle is kissing Katie Bell on an armchair by the fireplace.
“Hey!”
“Sorry,” he said, taking a bite of salmon. “What did you say?”
Draco snorts in response. “Please, save the ogling for afterwards, we’ll be late if we don’t leave now.”
Recognising Pansy’s loopy handwriting, he placed it gingerly on a stack of unopened letters by the trellis. He didn’t have time to explain their relationship to their acquaintances anymore.
Draco desperately wanted to lean away but knew what would happen if he did. He worked to appease his entirely unwelcome inner demon instead and allowed the intimate interaction. He’d just have to grit his teeth and wait this one out.
He places the stack of files gingerly on the countertop, backing away from the two of them.
“She’s just outside,” Harry says.
Draco made a noise of acknowledgment, clearly unsettled by Harry’s truthfulness. His brows furrowed, and he stared intently down at a rough spot on the wooden table.
He sleeps that night more soundly than he has recently, but his dreams are full of Draco. Harry pictures the scene in the bathroom, but in an alternate reality where Draco lives and lives and lives. He grows old, and he has children. He makes a life for himself. The dream shifts, and red blurs Harry’s vision. He yells for Draco, urging him to take his hand, but the boy disappears into the blackness.
Harry paced the length of the kitchen, extracting the blue vial from his jeans. Maybe he would give something new a try in the morning.
“So, you feel better?” Harry said, hoping there wasn’t too much expectation in his voice.
“You’re right.” Something warm and whole appeared in Draco’s eyes that Harry hadn’t seen in years. He felt his heart soar, and his body was quick to follow.
“What do you mean?” Harry feigned innocence, but Ginny narrowed her eyes at him as if to say,
Draco had never asked Harry about anything Auror related before. It would have been far too risky for the Aurors to have Harry in his position of power if they knew he was running home to tell his Death Eater husband — reformed though he was — the confidential details. So Draco never asked out of kindness and respect. Really, he never wanted to put Harry in an uncomfortable position like that — to choose between a spouse and a career.
“The potion worked at first, didn’t it?” Locke asked, eyes widening with intrigue as though Harry were a sick case study.
“Write to me, will you?” Harry asks, though he curses himself for it sounds pleading, and entirely too desperate.
Draco would play the part if that were needed.
“Congratulations, you know my name,” Harry deadpanned, his eyes fixed threateningly on Carrow.
“Please don’t be sorry. This is all my fault.” Harry heaved him up easily into his arms, guiding them to the bedroom where he laid Draco out on the bed.
!” He spat the words out menacingly, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand. Before Harry could formulate a response, he had stalked away and rounded the corner out of sight.
That evening, Harry left supper early. He sat with Ginny and Luna, who came over from the Ravenclaw table to join the Gryffindor’s group. Ron encircled himself with Dean and Seamus, purposefully laughing loudly at their jokes. Hermione shook her head at both of them. It wasn’t her first time being caught in between one of their fights, and she didn’t deserve to be put in such an uncomfortable position. Harry admired her for bothering to put up with the two of them at all.
Hermione and Ron are at the door, too, Harry notices. Hermione is crying, her face blotchy and red, stained by tears. Ron is ghostly white. When he sees them, Harry drops the shield unknowingly. He’s so tired, but his body still cries while his mind wanders elsewhere. He heaves dryly and finds his chest tightening against Malfoy’s. The blonde’s eyes are open and are staring into the distant ceiling. Harry does not know how he hasn’t noticed they are the most beautiful eyes he has ever seen in his life.
Harry considers the question. “It didn’t feel great, at first,” he says, supposing honesty is the best policy when it comes to the two of them.
“I don’t know what you’re playing at, Harry, but whatever is going on is crossing a line,” Draco said, his gaze hardening under the weight of Harry’s own.
It’s only when they leave that he realizes what has happened. That it was not a terrible nightmare.
Draco came seconds later, fucking himself roughly through his climax, crying out loudly into Harry’s shoulder.
Harry left his tools in the flowerbeds; he’d come back for them later. Ron led him inside and settled at the table in Draco’s seat. Harry busied his hands with the kettle to keep himself from jumping down Ron’s throat all at once. Sometimes it felt like his friends treated him with kid gloves, and he wasn’t too pleased with it.
“I was surprised,” Harry said dumbly, wanting to take the words back the second they left his mouth.
Harry would be gone, and Draco would be alone. He hated himself for wishing it at all.
Dumbledore is on his feet next to Harry but joins him in the grass before crossing his legs in front of him. “I’ve always thought the Great Lake was most beautiful at sunrise.” He reflects.
“This isn’t the end of the world,” she says. “You don’t need to be romantically involved, just on good terms.”
His breath caught in his throat.
Harry clears his throat, straightening up in his chair as though posturing will somehow make him feel better. “Well, I was going to tell him—”
“Don’t start with me, Harry,” Ginny warns. “You know what being soulmates means. You don’t get to just fuck off from each other for a week, your core will not let you. Don’t be stubborn, because this time around it’ll kill you.”
, Harry. Get the
Harry isn’t really listening as she begins to talk about her own resolution. It’s something about ridding Wrackspurts from their family home and perfecting a potion that she and Neville use in their vegetable garden.
Harry remembered the glow, the warmth in his chest when eating something his husband had baked for him from a tree they had grown together in their first home. There was something homely about it, something pure and chaste. When Harry had planted the peppers, at Draco’s request, their domestic bliss fractured.
Draco swallowed, uncomfortable already at the implication.
“No, but I assumed you would eventually,” she said mildly, returning her attention to Opal, who mewled blithely against the cotton jumper.
Draco’s lips upturned into a small, genuine smile. “Thank you, Hermione.”
“What?” Draco’s eyebrows rose on his forehead, “You want to go to dinner. With me?”
Draco frowns, his jaw tightening. He turns back to the tea, beginning to pour the hot water into their mugs. “And why’s that?” he says, tone clipped.
Harry had lied about where he was going.
“But you were back so late,” Ron said, eyes widening. “You surely weren’t with Malfoy for that long, right Harry?”
“We’re taking quite a while to get the basics of our research completed.” Draco said, “I think we should split up again today.”
“You never skive off work.”
“Oh,” is all Draco says stiffly, eyes unfocused and shifting in direction. “I have bad highs sometimes.”
“I don’t want to be some sort of test subject.”
Harry shakes his head, a mirthless laugh escaping from his throat. “A bit.”
He can’t visualise the area that Draco lives in well enough to properly Apparate there, though he thinks he knows of the place. Harry finds he lives quite far from Hampstead once he’s been on the train about a half hour and still hasn’t reached his destination.
“Drugs,” he identifies.
When Harry felt someone sit down next to him, he could hardly believe it was Draco before his eyes met piercing grey.
He went back for more, gaining confidence at the affirmative noises, and took the whole head into his mouth, playing gently with the tip and swirling his tongue roughly along the shaft. Draco cried out, squeezing his eyes tight as Harry licked and sucked at him from below. He pushed further down along Draco, feeling something hit the back of his throat, and hollowed his cheeks instinctually.
Harry knew things had been better, and the majority of their friends had noticed that. He’d only seen Ginny in passing, but she’d neglected to ask him about the state of his relationship — which was pleasantly surprising.
Harry’s not sure what fast-acting liquor had been in Neville’s cup, but he’s woozy, his body loose and languid as he parts the way. Even still, his head has never been clearer.
“The Weasleys are wonderful,” Draco prefaces, with a slight smile. “But they’re an exhausting group.”
“What are we doing?” Draco asked softly, but the question wasn’t tinged with sadness or fear. He just put it out there, as if he were asking what the weather was like.
A trickle of cold sweat ran down the back of his neck, making him shudder at the sensation. He took a step back, as though the space between them would widen and stretch into comforting and safe oblivion.
Draco broke away first, tightening his scarf around his neck with one hand and balancing the box in the other. He shifted, making toward the door as he heard Harry begin to order his tea and a pastry to go with it.
He was proved instantly wrong as they left the classroom.
Harry offered a weak laugh, but he dreaded the questions that would follow the answer to Ron’s question. “Well, I was with Malfoy.”
Harry knew the answer before he asked, but he needed to be sure. “Ron, you’re not acting like this because I’m bi–”
Because although he hadn’t wanted to reveal they were soulmates until after Draco had decided to recover, it is clear that will be an increasingly challenging goal. And really, Harry cares for Draco more than he will ever know. He has to accept that while he doesn’t understand Draco’s reasoning for his continued drug use, it’s a harsh reality that they must face together. It’s crucial that he remain in his corner, even when it’s easy to walk away.
“I’m not.” Draco sat taller at that, preening happily. “But this is something common among Muggles, so it’s purely for educational purposes. Blaise was dying for me to share, but I wouldn’t trust him with my secrets while I’m incapacitated and suggestible.”
Pansy returned only moments later, with coffee and promises that they’d be back to visit but Draco really should get some rest because he looked “absolutely terrible.”
Conversations with Draco used to feel like double Potions on a Monday afternoon. Somehow, now, it is a bit more like Quidditch practice. Achingly intoxicating. Harry shifts his weight unconsciously, and the pristine white of the bandage stains too quickly in red.
“Yeah,” Harry says mirthlessly. “It does.” It feels nice, at least, to know that she recognises the unfairness of it all.
“You’re making me nervous with all that fidgeting.”
“It happens like that,” Blaise concedes. “Pansy owled me this morning that they’re having another get-together tonight. I might pop over just to show my face for a bit if you’re interested in coming with me.”
“I think I loved him.” Harry says suddenly, his own words catching him off guard. He feels quickly embarrassed at the revelation.
“Draco, answer me,” Harry says through gritted teeth.
He crossed the room silently, careful not to wake Draco — who was, by all means, a heavy sleeper until it was most inconvenient for him not to be. The hinges squealed as they were forced open, and Lyra clambered inside with all the grace of a hippogriff foal. She nipped at Harry’s fingers insistently, demanding preparation of her morning meal. Harry was more than happy to oblige if it meant she’d leave him alone.
“Harry,” Draco said, gathering his breath for one more attempt.
“I’m willing to try if you are,” Harry said pointedly. “There’s no reason not to. And when have we ever been able to interact without some animosity? It’s what makes us all of this great. Imagine if we were boring!”
“It’s about time we did this for you,” Hermione says, with warm and full eyes as they reach the end of the benches. “We love you so much, Harry.”
Malfoy reached forward to touch the deep blue denim of Harry’s jeans and snatched his hand back as if it had been burned. Harry felt a low pull in his stomach at Malfoy’s hand on his upper thigh. It had been a long while since someone had touched him there at all.
“Do you blame me?” Harry blurted out, his eyes going a little wide at his own words.
“Upstairs,” Lavender repeats, picking up her wand to end the Silencing Charm. “I think you’ll be intrigued by what you find there.”
“Draco?” Harry tried again, but he wasn’t worried. He usually didn’t receive a response.
“I didn’t know you two were together,” he says, feeling acutely as though his presence isn't enough of an obstacle to stop them from jumping each other's bones.
“You think he likes me?” Harry asked, feeling hope bloom in his chest.
“Fine,” Draco groans. “I suppose we have a deal.”
Draco was closing in now, and his face pinched in the storm. He hoped to God that Harry’s destination of choice was close by, because he was on the verge of giving up for the warm shelter of his favourite armchair and a mug of extra sweet hot chocolate. Maybe with a few marshmallows if he was going to be indulgent. Draco wished he wasn’t so damned curious all the time, and then perhaps he’d be at home instead of out in the pouring rain.
Draco stood anyway, making his way to where Harry was standing in front of their laundry bin. His feet moved almost mechanically, without much consent from Draco himself. Harry smelled like sweat and soil, and Draco hated himself for letting it wind him up like this. The feeling in his head wasn’t gone just yet, though, and Draco hesitated before reaching out.
“I know you are.” Draco bowed his head. “I don’t want you to think I’m taking you for granted. I’m so lucky to have you to take care of me. I’m grateful that you’re putting up with me through all of this.”
“Oh, bugger off.” Pansy huffed. “Now that you’ve offered yourself up, though, as my personal errand boy —”
“Oi, if you’re going to be here, you have to participate,” she remarks, giving him a sly wink.
Harry leaves the words there and hopes the department won’t select him for a random drug screening any time soon. He doesn’t want to admit how wildly irresponsible he’s been, especially to Ron. Something about being around Draco seems to throw him off his axis.
“Do you know why you are here, Harry?” Dumbledore asks him mildly but firmly. Still maintaining intense eye contact with the boy.
“Why do you do this to yourself?”
Harry listens in as she guides the group through a myriad of phrases repeated back to her. When he doesn’t join in, Ollie pokes him in the side with her elbow.
“I can vouch for that,” Harry says from the corner.
is wrong.”
“What?” Draco said wildly, despite knowing Harry hadn’t been the one to say anything at all.
“Nothing,” Draco said, silencing Harry with his lips.
“I thought you didn’t want to see him,” Ron says, and the words are quieter than Harry expects.
“I know I’m not,” Harry says with a wicked smile.
“I don’t,” Malfoy says, and there’s a layer of distinct amusement in his tone that Harry doesn’t particularly like.
A large crash wakes Harry quickly. He stretches in place and knocks into his glasses as he goes to rub his eyes. The book lays folded open, abandoned on his chest. It’s still dark outside, and the moon is higher in the sky than he expects it to be.
Draco hums, leading Harry to the middle of the floor.
He strode back to the castle, as a light rain began to speckle down upon him, dampening his trainers. The sky was a little cloudy and dark as the day transitioned to night time. He cast a
“Nice, Potter.”
“You really think that?” Draco asked, shaking his head, “I did what was asked of me, you’re right. But I did it willingly. I only wanted to make my parents proud, especially my father. I wanted to serve the Dark Lord for him. I never believed the message as much as I should have, but I still believed it. You can make excuses for my actions as much as you’d like, and try telling yourself that I was just a child, but it doesn’t change the fact that people are defined by their choices. I made mine.”
“I’ve been well,” Draco said, pausing to adjust his weight. “How about you?”
Harry’s not sure what that means, but he offers her a smile. She returns one back two-fold and begins making both his and Ron’s orders unprompted.
A small bruise purples underneath Harry’s tongue, and Draco draws in air through his teeth.
“He does that sometimes,” Theo says, through a mouthful of vegetables.
They continued past the gift store and turned right into a large room full of windows. Greek statues lined the ivory walls, and students sat on stools with sketch pads in their laps.
Draco raises an eyebrow. “There’s a reason I brought groceries, you know. I’m betting your pantry is full of instant noodles and box mac and cheese.”
“Do you want to try something amazing?” Draco asks suddenly, sitting up slowly in the bed and reaching out a steadying arm to the bedpost.
“I think I know that at this point,” he huffed, reaching for a cleaning draught by his bedside that tasted of fresh mint and citrus.
That’s what he decided to go with, as stressing out for the rest of his work day wouldn’t do him any good. Maybe, in a moment of panic, he’d tensed in front of Ginny and couldn’t reveal how he really felt. That was more likely than a random curse or illness rendering him unable to think for himself. That or he’d been secretly struck by the Imperius Curse, but that was a ridiculous and unfounded thought.
Draco sits with the words for a moment as Harry nervously plays with his fingers.
Days pass before Harry actually leaves the comfort of his bed. Glasses of water magically appear by his nightstand and are quickly vanished after they have been drained. He suspects the house elves have something to do with it. Hermione was not allowed in the boy’s dormitory, so she had not managed to sufficiently drag him out. Ron seems almost scared of him in a sense. No one approaches his bed, and he doesn't care.
If he wasn’t, which was more likely the case, he decided checking himself directly into the Janus Thickey Ward might be wise.
