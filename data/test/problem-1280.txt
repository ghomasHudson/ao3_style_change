Ariel gave him a small, slightly sad smile as she took her hand from his face and began to turn on her side. "Goodnight, Professor Severus."
"You're not going to die," Voldemort shouted, his voice rising out of frustration that he couldn't find the anti-venom fast enough (but, also, because panic crying grated his ears).
He never felt more loved or cherished in that moment than he ever had in his entire life. He couldn't physically handle it. He started to convulse. His face turned a dark blue as his breath went ragged. Soon he was hyperventilating and, to Ariel's horror, the corners of his eyes misted. Before she could react, he threw his arms around her waist and sobbed into her abdomen for ten minutes straight, telling her in croaky wails, how much he loved her, and how he would never hurt her and how she had to promise to never, ever, leave him.
Her head turned sideways at him as she regarded him quietly. Her tail rippled the waters behind her and Tom followed the ever-expanding rings until they vanished into nothing. Finally, she told him, "I'm sorry. I can't. It's just something I can do as a siren."
A few days passed. Within that time, Ariel's affections for Snape doubled. Their first date together was populated entirely by animated conversations on a variety of subjects (with the one glaring exception being their relations with Tom/ Voldemort). In their discussions, they found they were held identical positions on numerous subjects including but not limited to: potions, politics, culture, mythical beings rights, marriage, and parenting (to other's relief neither of them wanted children preferring rather being childless adults who did as they pleased for as long as they pleased). Severus managed to tell her his life story in 5 minutes and happily spent the majority of the evening listening to Ariel tell stories of herself, of her former life in the sea, of old adventures and of course, of her family.
"Merlin's beard," said Voldemort with a small proud chuckle, "You're speechless. I left a siren speechless."
His words cascaded down her ears like cold rain. She felt her stomach lurched violently as the reality of what he said settled on her.
"I won't," Draco promised, snatching the vial from his hand, uncorking it and tossing its contents down his throat. It hit his stomach with a burning sensation before he felt the wavy warmth, warning him to find a bed soon before he would pass out mid-step. In a bratty slur, he told Snape, "Thank you Uncle Sevy."
The mouse waited for a few minutes, listening for the snake's movements but when none came, the little mouse took a chance. It scurried as fast as it could out of the opening and into the living room. It was heading towards a second, secret opening in the fireplace that the mouse knew would mean home-free.
"More like a man of few interests outside the stony walls of academia." He scoffed, slightly embarrassed by her generous smiles. "Um, so, you swam all night just to see me?"
Narcissa took Ariel's teacup full of wine from her then lightly grabbed her by the wrist, transporting them from the garden to inside the mansion. As the witch expected, Ariel hadn't acquired the leg muscles yet for apparition and crash-landed on the wooden floorboards. She helped her up then handed her back her cup which hadn't spilled a drop.
She waited for alarms to go off. For the angry voices of guards to break the air. But none of that happened. And Bellatrix unleashed a wicked laugh as Ariel and Lucius walked over to her.
She waited for him in the garden. She sat at a round little patio table, watching two albino peacocks wander through the manicured backyard freely until eventually one of them got tired of being followed and attacked their companion for no discernible reason. Shrieks were made; talons were drawn. The squabble ended as soon as it started with one victorious and the other cut up, missing tufts of feathers, red streaking the immaculate white body.
"No," Tom said, quickly, almost disgusted by the idea of being related to those morons. "They're just kids that live with me at the orphanage."
Ariel smiled, saying nothing for a short while, then added just to annoy him, "And you didn't trip over your words once while you read."
Nagini swerved her massive body around her ankles, swishing the blood and staining the hem of her dress as it circled her, threateningly. She could almost hear the snake warn her, I wouldn’t try anything if I were you. Ariel snapped out of it long enough to tell him, “I wanted to see you.”
"It's mine." She replied. When Snape gave her a disbelieving look, she reiterated. "It is! Look I can prove it." She took the crown back and set it on her head where the moment it rested against her forehead a Jamaican accented voice projected from the center-most sapphire.
Draco watched, numbly, as Snape whispered something into her ear. Ennui swam through him like a virus. Here was this woman, the only person in the world who could possibly be spared by the Dark Lord's bloodlust, sobbing, looking utterly sick with fear. He knew the sounds of utter, hopeless fear. He knew those frightened tears like sleet or rain. But if she—Lady Ariel, Miss Hero, the Dark Lord's Favorite—was scared shitless, how was there any hope for him and his family?
"It means I," He said with a flourish of his arm, like he was an artist showing off their latest project, "Have an army of undead bodies. Who do as I command. Who attack without pain."
"But we never thought we were subject to such extensive research," said Adriana with a coy smile that belied otherwise.
He looked at the sketch then back at Ariel, giving her a toothy-lipless smile that made her insides clench.
"Not just on me," He replied, almost awed. "But in the world. Ariel, you made history. And you realize once I rise to power, and they start writing about my life's story, you're going to be one of the most famous creatures to ever walk to the planet? There will be songs sung about you and your influence. Historians will fight each other to the death just to get a word from you. You will be a living legend."
It wasn't until they were gone did Lucius cry out, "Okay. What the hell was all that?" He turned to his wife and sister-in-law and demanded, "Since when does the Dark Lord have a friend? And who the hell was that woman? Why does she treat him like their equals? And why the hell haven't either of you—?"
He thought it was a songbird at first, some lonely creature calling out for its mate or to its family until he stopped walking long enough to listen. As he stood there, the singing grew louder and more lovely and recognizably human. The moment he realized it was a woman's voice singing did his black-shoed feet carry him towards the heavenly noise, further along, the perimeter of the lake. He hit a bank of tall reeds and pussy-willows before a nagging voice in his head warned him, you know there is only one creature who can lure people to the waters with such a sound. And they're always waiting for men like you to—
Without turning his head, Voldemort pulled out his wand, pointed it directly at his young adult self, and hollered, "Crucio!"
“Everything!” She gaped. She felt suddenly unhinged. Sitting in this garden in this house of blood having morning tea with the world’s most diabolical wizard underneath an Indian summer sun pretending like they were mother and son. She looked up and saw Tom’s ghost dissipate from the table, leaving only the Dark Lord. She knew then and there she was a fool to think she could change him back into the boy she barely knew. With that, she abruptly got to her feet and said, “I gotta go.”
"Not for a few hours." He whispered back. "Though we should probably go to bed. I'm sure you have a lot of things you want to do with your new life."
Tom listened quietly, his eyes averted to the ground, suddenly inexplicably embarrassed by her praise. The two of them lapsed into an awkward silence until Ariel broke it by saying,
"Did you hear that Ruth?" Harry asked his new goat friend, with mock dismay. "That dweeb over there has the audacity to call me a nerd."
"Ariel, I lied the other night when I said you were my hero." He said, drawing closer to her as her bottom lip trembled and her eyes brimmed with tears. "Because the truth is, whenever I thought of you over the years, it wasn't hero-worship. Whenever I thought of you, I would think about how…" He caressed her wet face with one hand without her flinching. "I would've given anything to be your son. To be your real son."
"I do. But up until last week, I was, in fact, Severus Snape, Potions Master and guest editor/ contributor to Potions Heads Monthly."
Shortly after Voldemort went to the grab Draco, Nagini woke up from her 3rd nap of the day looked at the couch her master's beloved currently occupied and said to herself, approximately, 'I don't know what that thing is but I'm going to climb the shit out of that.'
He turned his head and saw her stares. "What?" He glanced backward then laughed as he had just remembered something. "Thanks for reminding me." He said as he bent down to retrieve a small sack from his robes. He stuck his entire arm into the ridiculously small cloth bag and rummaged around until he finally pulled out a few articles of muggle clothes which he quickly threw on. As he dressed, he spotted Ariel's stares and told her, "Ma, it's just a tattoo. I got it 30 years ago."
Ariel studied Draco's face for a moment as if waiting for his façade to crack. But when it didn't, she asked him, "Would you like some tea before you start?"
"You may find it hard to believe," the Dark Lord continued smiling broadly, "But Ariel knew me when I was nothing but a pudgy little orphan. Back before I knew of my magical blood or I knew of my greatness. Back when I was languishing away in the muggle world, Ariel found me trying to steal from her personal collection. And though she could have easily drowned me then and there, she didn't. Instead, she taught me two of the most important lessons I ever received as a child: First, she taught me there is strength in numbers." (This garnered a tittering of laughter. With his return to power, his followers were in the hundreds of thousands, if not millions.) "But most importantly, she instilled in me a passionate pursuit for immortality. And if it wasn't for her, I can honestly say, I wouldn't be the great wizard that I am today."
He was slow to pull his gaze away from the quaking Malfoys but when he did eventually turn to Ariel, they changed instantly. No longer indecipherable, he regarded her and her bottle with the round-eyed patience and the closed-lipped grin of someone who indulging their obviously intoxicated friend.
"Boil for an hour, stir regularly until it turns blue and add a pinch of cinnamon for taste!" They recounted simultaneously before they burst into laughter.
"Excellent," Voldemort said, mollified. "Well, if that's that, then the only thing left then for this meeting is for everyone to get up and pay respects to our honorable guest." Voldemort decided while he pulled a chair from the wall and created a new space for himself beside Ariel at the head of the table. When a stunned silence kept the Death Eaters from moving fast enough to his liking, he shouted, "Now!"
"Merope." Even with her lovely voice, she couldn't improve such an ugly name. Tough break, she thought sadly. But then again, what's an ugly name in compared to forever being known as the woman who gave birth to the darkest wizard who ever lived?
His face contorted instantly. Color grew within his cheeks, hair produced at remarkable speed and, to her heart-stopping surprise, a face she once knew returned. In less than a minute's time, a twenty-something Tom Riddle stood in Voldemort's robes wearing the widest smile.
"Don't shame me," Ariel said half-heartedly then she tore her gaze away from Snape long enough to ask him, her expression changed to that of inviting evocation, "This doesn't bother you?"
"Aw, thank you for asking. It's called the Voice Disguiser Potion. And, basically, it'll change your voice into any speaking creature so long as you have their spit." Ariel laughed a little too loudly when she explained, "See, I got the idea because…You see, a hundred years—wait, no a hundred and fifty years ago? Whatever. Back in the day, I used to hang out with pirates quite a lot. And you know pirates. Fun as hell but damned if those drunk bastards don't know how to behave. So anyway, one of my friends, Jack, got arrested for piracy—which is a bum rap in my opinion. I mean, how come its imperialism when politicians pillage and plunder countries for their sugar and rum but it's piracy when a bunch of drunks on their own boat does the same thing?"
"Actually, he doesn't bother me at all. He and Ariel only visit each other, at most, once a week, and every time I enter the room he makes an excuse to leave."
"Oh Tommy," she said, feeling cherished and ready to dote the hell out him when a thought crossed her mind and her face changed. "Wait. Why did you get me flowers? Is someone dead?"
"Forgive me, my lord, but it was pretty obvious from the beginning that you had…high esteem for Lady Ariel. But even as you were gushing over her, nobody in that room thought you were any less evil or frightening."
"Would it be inappropriate to ask you," he said after he took his first sip, "If you slept well last night?"
Dumbledore frowned hard. "She might not." He said with the glum sadness of a man well acquainted with resentments and shame. Then in a brighter tone, he said, "That's why you should marry this creature. So you can spend the rest of your life telling her she has nothing to feel guilty about."
Narcissa hugged the bottle into her chest, trembling with fear, as the Dark Lord stepped over the threshold and closed the door wordlessly. Her mind raced with images of her violence and death as the sounds of the locks clanked shut. He stood there with his white-spidery fingers tightly wound around his hook of a wand. All pretenses of dignity and courage fell away from her as he put a silencing charm on the room, concealing her to whatever fate he had in store. She started to quake with unmitigated fear as he slowly approached her bed.
Draco ran into him and clamored onto him as he used to when he was five. Severus stood there still while silent tears ran down his worn-out face.
Something in his face changed. She felt her throat tighten and the air thin from her lungs as images of her torture, her drawn-out murder, flooded her mind.
"Who needs her?" An older, handsome Tom scoffed from the near distance. He was lounging in the sand, aloof. Too good for banalities like feelings. "We did just fine before and after she came along."
"It's not that hard," Ariel replied. "The dementors at that place are dumber than jellyfish. Plus, most of the guards there aren't paid enough to check on the prisoners every hour like they're supposed to."
Ariel squirmed in her seat, unsure of what to make of this conversation. It didn't feel like a win. But then again, he wasn't reaching for his wand, which laid idly against his saucer plate, and she wasn't struck dead either like she had expected.
Ariel stared at the ceiling for a moment in silence then asked, "Where did he find the supposed Horcrux?"
Arista smushed his cheeks between her hands and cried, "Such a handsome boy!" She released him and slung her shoulder around his as she whispered, "I bet you fend off admirers with a sword."
"I spent decades on that army! Decades!" He raged. "I would've unleashed it too. I would've enslaved the world with them, in two years, tops. Is that good enough for you now? Mom?" He threw his arms at the mess of rocks, face wild with fury. "Will anything I ever do be good enough for you?!"
His mouth clamped tight with disappointment. His insides broiled with envy. Why couldn't he be special? He knew he was special. He knew it in his bones. So why was every adult he ever came in contact with trying to squelch his potential?
"Just the pain in the ass ones," he said, buttoning his shirt back on. He then glanced over to watch Ariel wrap herself with his cloak. Sentimentality swam over him as he confessed, "Last night was…phenomenal."
He stood aside while Ariel quickly darted inside but was shocked to see her come right out before the door had a chance to close. She had with her a leather-bound journal which she shoved in his arms and instructed him, "You gotta learn how to hide your stuff better kid." She then added, "Oh, and don't feel bad about having a shrine dedicated to your crush. When I was your age, I had a life-sized marble statue of my crush in my room." With that, she sealed herself back into the lavatory while a stunned Draco looked down into his own arms to discover she had given him back his diary and, after a moment of confusion, did as she said and tucked the journal into his inner jacket pocket.
"I doubt it," Narcissa said emphasizing doubt. "I mean, this is the Dark Lord. If he wanted to, he would've forced himself on her already."
She rushed out the bathroom, hairbrush still in hand, and peered down the hallway banister which gave a full view of the living room. Voldemort was crouched before one of the wall length bookcases but his face was drained of the rage she heard earlier replaced by the glee of a small child who had spotted their parent after a short but agonizing separation.
"I did." She scooted closer to him. He tensed, afraid that the closer she would get, the closer he would be to coming undone but didn't move away. "It seems me and you have a couple of things in common."
He was a considerate guide, letting her use him for balance, helping her over the boulders and down into the cove.
Ariel held back the urge to gag. Her breath smelled like her ass and her mouth switched places. "You know I'm dating Severus right?"
"Wow," she breathed, unable to pry her eyes away from the dingy gray slabs. "So, the dead are…just buried here?"
Ariel felt delirious standing before such a creation, who captured her wheezing reflection in its smooth golden base. "Oh, my cod…" She ran her hand against the cauldron's rim. She couldn't help but let out a high-pitched squeal at the soft feel. "Ahhh!"
Ariel gave his cold, colorless hand a soft squeeze of forgiveness. "You can make it up to me by reading me a story."
"Twenty-five I think." It was in-between the making of his first and second Horcrux. Back when he was still discovering the lows he would sink in order to be immortal.
Eventually, the dementor halted and angled itself at a cell. Ariel peered inside. A man with scraggly white-blonde hair laid in a heap against the concrete floor on his bed which was nothing more than a thin, uncomfortable-looking mattress and a small threadbare blanket, too little or thin to bring any real warmth, especially in such a chilling place. He didn't even lift his head when she stuck her face in-between the metal bars to get a closer look at him. His face was obscured by the shadowy cell.
"And I would never make you," Voldemort said with a loving smile. Then with a quick kiss on the cheek, he announced, "I really should go. I love you, mom. Tell Severus I'll see him soon."
"Oh, I saw your copies of Potions Heads Monthly. That reminds me, I really want to introduce you to one of my followers. Good guy, kind of boring but I think you'd hit it off. He actually edits for that magazine."
Timid Draco led a quiet Ariel down a lavish, emerald green-carpeted corridor past galleon-encrusted chandeliers and wall-sized oiling family portraits until, in the end, stood the bathroom door.
The giant cobra dropped from the ceiling and fell into Ariel's lap but she continued to lavish the beast with pets like Nagini was merely a friendly dog.
"No shit," Ariel replied, barely listening for a nauseating numbness had begun to erode her insides.
"You might as well rip your dick off if you're going to be such a little bitch." Ariel bellowed at him.
Bellatrix's head shot up high enough for her to peak through her errant locks of hair to cast a stunned look between the pair. Ariel nodded and smiled at her reassuringly while Voldemort gave her a hard look that said, bitch, you are so lucky.
You hoped her love would turn you into a better person. Well, lucky for you she's a piece of shit too. It's probably better for you now. At least you know she's not too good for you.
Besides. At least the odds of him killing her are significantly lowered now. Hell, this might even help you.
Narcissa waited a few months after the war ended and a few months more until Snape's injuries healed to visit them. It was nearly six months when she dropped by Spinner's End.
Ariel turned her head over her shoulder and gave him a thoughtful smile. "Yes and no. I mean, I won the bet but the prize wasn't worth all that much to begin with." She whipped her head back to the chopping board and said, "But isn't that how it always goes? You sacrifice everything for something you think you want, just to get it and realize, this isn't what I wanted at all."
He pondered this question for an uncomfortably long time. "I've lost count. But if I had to guess...personally...in the tens of thousands."
One would think that after successfully getting away with murder and escaping to a luxurious log cabin in the middle of the picturesque mountains of Brasov Bellatrix would be happy but she wasn't.
"Just the way she looks at you," Voldemort replied off-handedly. "Also, she told me earlier that she thinks your voice sounds like sex on a velvet rug during a thunderstorm."
Pause. "Well…I…." Snape faltered then made another, longer pause. "He really cleaned the whole house without magic?"
“Yes.” He sighed, rolling his eyes, looking more disappointed with himself than with her. He glanced at her and upon noticing her baffled expression, he said, “I would never force you to do anything you didn’t want to do, Ariel.” With another roll of his eyes, he muttered, “God, I’m going soft.”
The Dark Lord was in a fantastic mood lately. His capricious temperament of before had tempered slightly since Ariel's arrival. While his bloodlust didn't disappear entirely, that would be deranged, he was slower to punish his followers and his cruelty was redirected to where it belonged: muggles, sub-creatures and blood traitors. And the Malfoys were grateful to be in his somewhat good graces again.
That whisper—her lips—the look in her eyes. He flung himself into her and buried his mouth into her while they tore at each other's clothes. He unknotted his own cloak while she unhooked his belt and unzipped his erection free, which hovered straight out. Hard as diamond and as long as a loaf of bread.
They rolled off each other, got up from the dirtied cloak which Snape cleaned with a flick of his wand and handed over to Ariel. She took the cloak and gave him a wicked smile as she wrapped herself within the cloth and secured it above her chest with a simple knot. "This is so warm!" She observed with a shudder. "You might not get this back."
At last, Dumbledore stepped out of the wall and appeared with his wand raised. "I'm not the only one on borrowed time, Tom. Or should I say…mama's boy."
"Yeah, he used to teach the subject too," Voldemort said in-between sips. "Oh, that reminds me…I need to call a meeting soon. I got to introduce you to the troops." He nudged her with his elbow playfully and said with a laugh, "Can't afford to lose any more followers to you now."
He stopped so abruptly he felt his heart slam into his ribcage. Aunts. The very word tickled his ears. Less than two months ago, every last one of his family members was dead. Now, not only did he have a mom—a beautiful, sweet, loving, lovely, funny, fun, brilliant mom too—but now…he had aunts. Six aunts.
"I'm an auntie?" Attina cried, her voice two octaves higher than normal, her hands crossed over her breast as if to save her heart from exploding.
"You know what? I agree, Ron. It is a good day." Harry said, closing his textbook. "We should do something to celebrate this good day."
"What," Snape said, clearing his throat after a half-minute of intense deliberation over his next choice of words. "Makes you think that, My Lord?"
Draco upped the ante by reaching straight for Harry's groin, which tensed and stiffened under his touch.
He smiled at her, heart aflame. "Well, those were the only things I wanted to know. Got any more questions for me?"
"Well," Bellatrix said as she slowly rose to her feet looking uncertain and thwarted. "Thank you…for not killing me."
She gently touched Snape on the forehead, who dutifully continued to lap up her throbbing genitals, and when he stopped to see what she needed, she said with a pant, "Please fuck me."
She wrapped her index finger around the handle when she felt the presence of someone looming over her. When she looked up and saw Lord Voldemort joining her, she had to stifle out the primal urge to scream, vomit blood, and have a heart attack.
His obvious flattery garnered a real smile out of Voldemort. He patted Snape on the shoulder winked at him and said, "'Almost'. Good answer." After a pause, his face turned somber and his hand returned to his side. "There's a second reason I called you here tonight." He dug into the pockets of his robe and took out four vials. He handed two to Snape then downed his lot like shots of copper and puke flavored liquor. Snape watched his master's bald head start to sprout red hair and his tall slightly doughy stature shorten and slender. Within seconds Ariel stood in Voldemort's robes, held his wand, and bore his broad bastard's grin. When Snape's stares lingered he told the wizard, in Ariel's melic mezzo, "Any day now. We only have so many hours to kill."
Ariel watched with a dazed expression on her face as Bellatrix air-mopped the floors clean and Narcissa washed the blood stains from the carpet with a flick of her wrist like they were simply two sisters tackling chores together rather than abating a murder scene. She almost didn’t hear Voldemort’s voice when he said to her, “I thought you’d be searching for housing right now.”
Snape's lips twitched upward before he held out both hands, hovered them above her tail as his mind locked and eyes locked onto the task in hand and began to recite words from a dead language.
“You’re going to eating good for a while Nagini,” he remarked in parseltongue with a chuckle as he whipped a finger the size of his leg into the bloody meat pile. Torrent of blood rained down on the already soaked wizard, splashing his white skin and black robes. He loved the feeling of blood raining down on him the way most people loved summer rain.
"Hello, everyone. I'm going to keep this short because, believe it or not, even sirens can't stand public speaking. Ha. Get it? Can't stand… 'cause they have…tails."
"I would've—I would've—I would've…if I could've…" She said through croaky sobs as she held his calloused hand against her soft face.
Snape glanced at her uncertainly but then a voice in his head told him when are you ever going to get this close to a siren again and his hand shot out to her tail. As he ran it up and down a small patch of scales, he was dismayed by how rough and cold the tail felt against his palm. It reminded him of a wet brick wall.
Ariel nodded again, gently recoiling her spit-covered hand from Bellatrix's grip as she said with a sympathetic shrug, "These things happen. You weren't the first person to kidnap and I doubt you'll be the last. At least, now we both know."
"That's very kind of you," Narcissa replied with a small bow before she took the empty chair across from her. Ariel lifted the tea kettle but Narcissa declined with a small shake of her head. "Thank you but I'm not much of a tea person."
"No thank you, Lady Ariel," Draco said as he headed for the stairs, eager to get as far away from the Dark Lord and his oblivious mother as he could.
"It was my pleasure," Snape said, making sure his lips barely parted so the words came out in a soft rumble turning Ariel's sweet smile into a lusty lopsided grin.
"I had fun," Voldemort said with a small surprised laugh as if shocked he could still feel such trivial emotions.
Once the panic settled down and Draco was on the other side of the house, crying over how shitty it is to clean without magic ("how do muggles do this every day?!"), did Ariel turn to Voldemort and say, "Happy birthday."
Ariel didn't respond to this lie with anything other than a look of second-hand embarrassment while Voldemort, who always enjoyed being front and center to other people's humiliations, told him bluntly, "You're too late Draco. We've seen the shrine."
Voldemort's eyes squinted slightly as if confused. "You... didn't make any...life-changing decisions over the holidays?"
"Wait, that was illegal?" Harry asked. Then he asked, more emotionally, "Is that Hagrid never adopted me? Is that why I'm still at the Dursleys?!"
Nagini descended from the top of the couch towards the back of the couch where she eventually made contact with the floor and lazily wiggled her huge body towards the kitchen where, in a chewed-out section of the molding, hid one terrified mouse.
"Imagine you broke every bone in your body at once, got set on fire and someone cuts your heart out of your chest all at the same time."
It took everything in Draco to not run up and hug his mother when he found her. He wasn't ashamed to admit he missed her, and his aunt. But when he tried to catch their eyes as he took his seat at the dining room tablet all his mother did was squeeze his hand underneath the table before turning her solemn face downward, as if suddenly fascinated with the black wooden table she and her husband had owned for generations. He couldn't help but notice the manic glee in his aunt's eyes were gone. Something was wrong, he knew and when he looked across the table to find Snape with his hands folded out in front of him, nose pointed down like he was waiting for the worst, Draco felt his heart drop to his feet.
For a while all Ariel did when she got her legs was stroke them, her hands running up and down the contours of her new limbs, her teary-eyes unblinking as if the moment she looked away they would disappear on her again. She remained on the ground, on Snape's cloak, who took a seat beside her but kept his eyes away from her.
He reconsidered her advice. She wasn't telling him he had to make friends like all the teachers and social workers told him to, but she did make a good point. Things were easier whenever he had someone else there to take the fall for his plans.
Just when she thought her heart could take the wait no longer—a small tornado appeared in the center of the room. And from that small cyclone appeared Ariel, Bellatrix and, to her heart-pounding wonder, Lucius.
He gnashed his teeth, eyes flared. "Must be so easy for you to judge. I forgot, mom, how many deaths did you cause during the 1840s? Hmm? Last time I checked you decimated a third of the Scottish sailing community."
Snape smirked involuntary then stiffened his face and said in his usual seriousness, "When are you going to the cave with Potter?"
If they were ever going to be in the Dark Lord's good graces again, he would have to prove himself able to make up for his father's shortcomings. He would have to be a good spy. He would have to prove himself craftier, smarter than his father. He had to be the perfect, clever, stoic servant. Like his godfather.
“Now, I’m not a fashion guru, but I’m pretty sure that if you come to me for a change of clothes then you really need to invest in some more.” Ron was telling the truth, the majority of Harry’s clothes was still hand me downs and most of them were too big. “Since you going shopping anyway, you could ask Malfoy for some advice”
“Draco, this is a great idea. Thank you, I was afraid that I would wake you and you would hate me. You’ve got yourself a deal.” At this Draco smiled as well.
At Draco’s words, McGonagall stepped to the side and let them into the room. Harry already knew how the office looked like so he didn’t bother looking around, but he noticed that Draco was still taking the room in.
“Okay, I did a lot of bad things and most of them I did because I wanted to protect my parents even though they don’t deserve it. I hate that even though they were horrible to me I still did everything I could for this shitty family that hated me now. I’m sorry that I used you and I wish I’ve never done it but I cannot change it no matter how much I want to.” Noticing that Draco began to scratch at his hand harry quickly took Draco’s hand in his once again.
He watched as Draco laughed and kissed him. “I would like to spend more time with you, but I’m not so sure about the cat. We would have to ask Sam if he would be okay with a cat. Also, we need to get him a frog or a toad as a pet at Hogwarts.” Harry smiled Draco was always so thoughtful.
McGonagall smiled. “I’m sure this can be arranged. So Mr Black the only thing felt is your accommodation. I know that you and Mr Potter became rather good friends, so I decided to put the two of you in one room. I believe that this arrangement will prevent a lot of people form targeting you, plus you wouldn’t have to worry at night. Of course if there any problem I sure this can be changed.” Draco was speechless, not only was he treated with respect and understanding, but McGonagall was also making sure that he was comfortable and safe.
“Draco! Wake up. Come on!” He could hear that Draco’s breathing was picking up again. He touched his shoulders and shook the boy. “Draco you need to wake up!” This time he screamed so loud that he was afraid that he will be heard in another room.
“Emm…” He looked up towards Draco and their eyes locked. Draco smiled at him encouragingly and tilted his head towards the door as if to let Harry know that he should talk with Ginny in private. “Yeah, okay. Let’s go.” Slowly he made his way towards the door expecting her to follow.
From that point, Neville always sat next to them sometimes asking Draco questions connected with potions. The blond was extremely talented at potions which turned out to be a good thing since Slughorn preferred to let them work on their own which lead to explosions and melted caldrons.
“Boys it rather late, so I would appreciate if at least one of you get to the point.” She looked at them expectantly.
“Are you seriously going to take McGonagall’s proposition?” His voice sounded hopeful and Harry couldn’t help but smile at the blond.
Draco noticed that this brought Weasley’s attention, he looked up from the baby and glared at his friend, for a moment Draco was worried but when the redhead spoke he wanted to burst out with laughter. “Are you kidding me. Harry, you know that Hermione is helpless in the kitchen and the last time I tried to cook something ended up in flames. You cannot keep doing this, we cannot spend our whole money on taking out.”
Draco was still half asleep. Harry couldn’t tear his eyes away from him, “Morning.” Harry smiled at the blonde in his arms, he still couldn’t comprehend how did he get so lucky.
Andromeda’s arms were tightly wrapped around him. He couldn’t breathe. Vaguely he heard Andromeda tell Potter to help her move him to a guest room. He couldn’t stand
Once again he was in the forest, but something changed, the fear that was always present wasn’t so prominent. He could still feel it and he could still feel the presence of the shadow, but somehow it wasn’t as bad as before. Slowly he started to walk in the direction from where he could feel the shadow’s presence. Maybe it was stupid and reckless, but he needed to know if it will attack him.
Draco was putting a black shirt in is trunk he was wearing Harry’s hoody and one again Harry couldn’t take his eyes away from the blond man in front of him. His clothes just looked better on Draco, all the baggy sweatshirts and hoodies looked just right. The more he looked the more he knew that he has to tell Draco about his feelings and he has to do it rather sooner than later.
They pulled away and stepped outside. Harper was lying on the grass, their training broom next to them, Sam was standing a little to the left still holding a tennis ball in his hand.
The blonde looked at him and Harry saw how exhausted he was, the storm of emotions that was today really took its toll on him. “I think I would much prefer to sleep.” Harry smiled hearing the scruffy voice that was tainted with exhaustion.
He quickly averted his eyes and looked at her. She had a funny expression on her face as if she knew something that he didn’t.
“Harry, Malfoy sit down. We already ordered for you.” In the corner of his eye, he saw Draco flinch at the mention of his family name. Harry was sure that no one used it since he moved to Andromeda’s.
“I need to know how long are you staying, I need to apply the healing spells one more time and I don’t know what Draco’s reaction will be this time.” Although this was not a question Harry immediately knew what was being asked from him.
When their argument started to come to a close Draco noticed that the boy in his arms started to yawn, he turned towards Andromeda. “Teddy is falling asleep. We need to go before he attaches himself to me.”
He looked as the rest of the students quickly left the Hall, Harry was still planted next to him and Draco was grateful for this comfort. When all the students, but Harry and he left McGonagall spoke again. “Mr Potter, I don’t intend to hurt Draco in any way. I just need to ask him some questions and talk with him. You may leave find your new dorm and then come back to guide Draco there, but this is something between me and Draco only Mr Potter.”
“He made me swear never to tell anyone. At first, I wanted to argue with him, but he finally convinced me that if anyone else knew Lucius would most likely kill them before they could do anything with this information.” There was a pause, and he worried that Andromeda would cry again. “I think about this all the time. What if I helped him that day? Would I save him from the fate of becoming a Death Eater, would he be happy?”
“After the kiss, you didn’t have to leave.” He carefully watched Harry’s face, the confusion and nervousness slowly melted away from his face and Draco slowly started to smile.
It's Valentine Day, also I tried to write some action in the next chapter, so this is your warning. If you wanna read it you can mentally prepare yourself.
“It will be okay Draco. I promise she is the headmistress and she informed us that any student in need can come to her at any time and as we are students in need I don’t see a reason that would make McGonagall change her mind” Although his voice was calm, Harry felt almost as panicked as Draco looked.
“That actually would be lovely. Why don’t we go climbing and have a picnic?” Draco smiled at the idea and enthusiastically nods his head, he saw that Harry did the same and Ron kissed Hermione.
“Draco you were just a scared boy.” The tenderness in Harry’s voice almost made him believe that his words were true, but he couldn’t look up and see if Harry meant it.
When Slughorn finally let them leave Draco was afraid of whatever waited for him. Fortunately, he didn’t have to wait for long, upon opening his bag feathers started to spill out of it. Quickly he closed it, but this time it didn’t contain the white feathers. They started to fall from his bag and quickly scattered around the entire classroom. The vanishing charm, that he cast only made the feathers multiply faster, reluctantly he sent the bag to the dorm hoping that the problem will disappear on its own.
He locked his eyes with Ron, he looked uncomfortable as if he wanted to run away. Harry could only imagine what Draco was feeling.
Draco looked at his hands, they were shaking and he couldn’t muster the energy to make them stop. Slowly and on shaking legs he stood up and made his way into the man’s office.
“Oh, okay.” He stood up and held his hand to Teddy, a smile appeared on his face, when the boy didn't hesitate to take it. “Come on, time to say goodbye, Teddy.” He watched as the boy ran from one person to another saying his farewell.
“Draco, are you all right? You scared me.” He noted that she sounded worried. He hated when other people were worried about him.
He could feel the blood on his face. It was dripping for his face making a small puddle on the floor. He had enough. He tried to save them, all he ever did was in order to save them. He was torture, he was beaten, and he was almost killed, and he endured it all because he wanted to save them. He wanted his parents to live, and he did everything in his power to save them.
A moment later he looked at the pamphlet and read the name of the exhibition for the first time. The pamphlet read
He sat next to Hermione and started to discuss with her the next potion essay when suddenly the door of the Great Hall flew opened. In the middle of them stood furious Harry Potter, feathers still glued to him. Although they didn’t cover him whole, little and big patches of them could still be seen on the boy clothes and in his hair which made him look even more hilarious.
“I’m sorry that she said that, but I’m very glad that you didn’t listen to her.” For a moment they only stared at each other, then Harry broke the silence. “Do you maybe want to go for a pit with Ron, Hermione and I later this week?”
He was also happy because Draco’s situation improved, more and more students from lower years decided that the blond is okay, most of them attended Draco’s lesson, but some decided to bury the hatchet without the extra convincing. Sure there were still those that hexed him, but there was less and less of them. Draco also relaxed more after McGonagall informed him that she will personally oversee his exams as well as write him a letter of recommendation for any job he will apply.
Harry was silent for a moment then he kissed his forehead and started to stroke his cheek. Draco smiled at the gentle way that Harry touched him. “Is there anything I can do?” This made him smile even more.
“You wouldn’t have to persuade me. If miss Weasley would agree then I would go with you.” At his words, Harry blinked at him and Draco noticed that his eyes flickered down. For a moment he could swear that Harry was looking at his lips, but that was impossible.
“I will say this only once so listen closely. Draco is my boyfriend I will not hide him. This is my life, not yours, I don’t care what all of you think about me but let’s make one thing clear. The war is over the ones responsible paid for their sins, Draco did what he did for a reason and if I can see it then you all can also get yours heads out of your asses and see him as more than a boy that was forced into a role he didn’t want to play. Now if I see any hexes thrown his way I will personally make sure that the detention you will face will be the least of your worries.” Draco almost shivered to hear Harry’s tone.
“Pandora sweetie if you take anything from the box home you will be sleeping in the garden with the gnomes.” The girl looked up at Draco’s voice, her gaze held pure chaos, and suddenly Harry was enormously happy that he won’t be home till nightfall.
Draco knew that this explanation may not be enough for Harry’s friends and he needed to tell them why he treated them this way, why he was an asshole all his life. He needed them to know that he is trying and that he is worthy of a second chance.
The image of stuffy ministry officials in their perfect suits trying to gift him a tree made Harry smile. The blond looked very pleased with Harry’s reaction and began to laugh himself.
Harry and Ron were still in the air and Draco couldn’t believe his luck. Avoiding being seen by the two boys, he entered the changing room and located Harry’s things and put the strongest sticking charm he knew on Harry’s clothes. Just as he was coming out of the changing room, he noticed the youngest Weasley was looking at him. He smiled at her and held up one of his fingers to his mouth, she smiled back and nodded. Upon seeing this gesture Draco relaxed and made his way onto the stands. He got there just as Harry landed on the grass and made his way to change.
Draco felt as Harry started to slowly open him up, one finger, made him moan. Two, made the moans turn needy, soon he couldn’t stop the begging from escaping him. Three, Draco felt the need, for Harry to finally enter him, grow bigger, the sensation was becoming unbearable. Finally, the fourth finger joined and Harry started to stretch him for the last time. After an embarrassing number of moans from Draco, Harry slowly exchanged his fingers for his cock. Draco felt his body tense, then after a moment of adjustment, Harry started to move and he felt himself relax.
After a moment of silence, he decided to give her only the basic reason. “I wanted to know if occlumency can somehow interfere with dreams, Hermione was just curious and decided to help me with the research.”
Polish people, I love you and we will get through it. No matter what we will survive this nightmare!
“Are you sure that he is okay?” She was surprised that it was Ron who asked the question. She still felt as if she couldn’t form words.
A hand on Harry’s shoulder successfully startled the two of them. “Not to spoil the fun but you two have a room where you can fool around.” Harry felt himself reddening at Hermione’s words. Looking at her he noticed that Ron was standing slightly to the side his face had almost the same colour as his hair.
“Are you two aware that I don’t need a babysitter  and that I’m perfectly capable of taking care of myself?” Even though his expression was full of furry he was aware that voice lack any trace of anger.
He aparated to Andromeda’s home and knocked on the door without hesitation. Andromeda opened the door, Teddy was placed on her hip. He was holding a plush dragon. Harry smiled at this picture.
He stood up. “Right, sorry Hermione, Ron we couldn’t leave them at Andy’s cause she was with us. I’m sure that next year they won’t be as exhausting.” He smiled as his friend glared at him. He turned towards Pandora and noticed that Harper joined her next to the box. “You two put back everything that you took and step away from the box.” He watched as the duo put several small objects back to the box, when they straighten up he looked at them his eyes set hard. The children stood unmoving for a moment then Pandora placed a small ball back in the box, he smiled. “Okay, let’s go.”
“Almost all the shouting and insults stopped, I’m not saying that this is bad I feel like they planning something.”
He watched as the man in front of his rose his brow looking unimpressed. “There’s only one way to find out what is missing Harry”
“Draco, are you okay?” he could hear the worry in his mother’s voice. His mother never used this tone with him.
He considers to stay silent for their trip just to spite the blond, but after a quick mental debate, he decides that today’s going to be an official embarrass Draco Black day. He feels as a wicked smile appears on his face. “Well darling, now I’m ready. Let’s join our friends and introduced you to some muggle culture.” He knows that this is a dangerous game, but he is willing to play it, besides the flush that appears on Draco’s face as he heard the word darling being directed at him is almost worth the lecture that he for sure will get from, Hermione.
“Don’t worry about them as long as I’m behind the bar they won’t do anything.” She smiled at them once again and led them back to the bar.
He looked at Hermione then at Draco, the Slytherin was crimson, the colour almost matched the sweater form Molly, that harry was currently wearing. Without looking at Harry, Draco quickly entered the classroom.
Draco could hear the blood pulsing in his head, he was nervous and afraid, but he knew that he has to do it if he wants to have a chance for a normal life. He never tried to speak to it but today seemed like a day for trying new things. He looked at a place where he assumed the shadow’s eyes were and spoke.
“Now we know that if I ever want to change my hair colour it won’t be to pink this colour does nothing for my complexion.”
“Oh, this will be harder, in order to get rid of something that is made from your fears and things that you were tod to be ashamed to need to face them and accept yourself, Mr Black.” McGonagall looked at his concerned.
He looked at the boy next to him and discovered that Draco downed his drink. “The sooner we begin the sooner I can go home”
“Mr Black I believe that I know what is the problem and how to solve it. It may take some time and I imagine that it will be hard, but I believe that you can do it. Besides you are not alone, I’m sure that Mr Potter will be with you during this journey.” She watched as the scared look on the boy’s face changed into something more peaceful at her word.
During Weasley’s little act Draco watched Harry and noticed the different emotions that crossed his face. At first, it was confusion, maybe even fear but the more was said the bigger Harry’s smile was.
Harry was complaining the whole walk back to their apparation point. Draco thought that their trip was very successful, Harry had new trousers, new shirts, new shoes, new everything and he was very proud of the whole wardrobe change. Draco was sure that everyone at Hogwarts will appreciate the change and honestly the fact that Harry was still arguing about the fact that Draco told him that he lacks style is pretty amusing.
When the train finally stopped a McGonagall’s voice sounded in all the compartments. “Hello, students. All first-year students will go with Hagrid, all students from year 2nd to 7th will travel by carriages and the returning 8th-year students are to wait for me. Thank you and I will see you all soon.”
He leaned down and started to kiss the Slytherin once again, this time he finished by turning the blond around and froze. “Draco, we don’t have lube.” When he looked at the blond he noticed that his face was now crimson.
“There you are Ron, you just ran away and I didn’t know where you went. Are you alright, mate?” Draco smiled at Harry’s concerned tone, the boy had no idea what about to happen.
“Ron I don’t think that barging in their dorm now is a good idea.” Harry almost laughed at Hermione’s panicked voice, but quickly he remembered the blonde that was still in his arms.
Draco eyes watered and he did everything in his power to stop the tears that gathered in his eyes. His throat close of and the only words that he could express was a weak “Thank you.” that felt inadequate in this situation.
“Well, since in the 6th year I was forced to accomplish an impossible task in order to save you two, I would say that the grades I received were not that bad.” He could hear his voice tremble, he hated him, and he could see that his father noticed.
After what felt like forever Harry finally broke the kiss and look around because of the noise. Every person in the room stared at them for a moment and then began to clap.
It was the 1st of September, and Harry was once again standing at King Cross station waiting for the Hogwarts express to disappear. This time Draco, Andromeda and Harper, who was a year younger than Teddy and insisted on going with them, were with him, the rest of their family thankfully stayed with Hermione, Ron and their children. Harry knew that this was harder for the two than for him. Teddy was hugging his grandma, and Draco was ruffling his hair.
Please stay strong and keep fighting. Don't let others tell you that you don't matter to that there is nothing to be done, they are wrong and you are dynamite of a person and your explosion can bring change.
So once again Black Lives Matter and they always matter. I will be writing this statement forever so get used to it.
“My parents weren’t fans, so they decided to express their dislike with the beverage very soon in order to make sure that I never even think about tasting it.” The blond was looking at his hands avoiding their eyes.
Letting go of Draco was one of the hardest things that he had to do in his life and he killed Voldemort. Slowly they made their way to their dorm. When they finally open the door, Ron and Hermione were sitting in front of the fire. Both of them immediately looked up and Harry noticed the worried expression that Hermione was shooting at Draco.
I know that you probably are sick of all the bad happenings in the world but please if you have time let any member of the LGBTQIA+ community that lives in Poland know that they matter and that they are seen.
Harry smiled and Draco tried to mimic his expression. He looked at Harry and suddenly he realised one day the boy will be the death of him.
He found Harry in the library and before the Gryffindor could sit down he made the bench move. Harry landed on the ground with a satisfying sound that made Draco stifle a laugh. He watched as the boy quickly stood up and looked around, probably searching for him. With a quick charm, he levitated Harry' school bag on top of a bookshelf in the far end of the library. Not waiting for Harry’s reaction he made his way out of the room.
Draco let himself be guided towards their bed while he was kissing Harry’s neck. After his legs made contact with the bed, he started to tug at Harry’s shirt. Harry must have understood his need for skin to skin contact because The Man Who Lived quickly took off his T-shirt and thrown it the corner of the room, a moment later Harry removed Draco’s t-shirt and pushed him on the bed.
He looked at Harry’s emerald eyes and even though he could still feel the throb that the hex lest he quickly pecked Harry’s lips and begun to eat.
After Valentines, the two of them didn’t have as much time as they wanted to have of course the two of them tried to spend as much time together as they could, but with N.E.W.T.s approaching and with the amount of material they had to learn especially Draco most of the time they had was spend studying.
of February was never a priority on Draco’s list until now, he knew that the boy who lived most likely never had a Valentine day date and although Draco didn’t care about the holiday he wanted Harry to experience it. Asking for Andromeda’s help was getting easier and easier, she didn’t even question him when he asked if she could send him his favourite blanket.
His father was a different story, Potter didn’t testify for Lucius. There was no point in trying to save him, but even without saviour’s testimony Lucius only got a lifetime of house arrest. Draco couldn’t believe when he heard the verdict. His father, the person that invited the Dark Lord into their home, the killer, the torturer was set free. Lucius could do whatever he wanted and no one could stop him. Draco couldn’t speak.
Another thing that is the situation in Belarus the situation there is horrible, please educate yourself on the happenings there and help in any way you can because people there have enough and they are fighting for freedom.
“I love you.” Harry noticed that he sounded breathless, he looked up and noticed that the smiled on Draco’s face grew.
Draco shifted awkwardly next to him and he wondered if there was any way to smooth the blond. Would he appreciate if Harry held his hand?
year all his hope evaporated, he was tortured by other Death Eaters, his father became even crazier and his aunt took pleasure in messing with his head, but the worse was Voldemort who took special pleasure in torturing his youngest follower. He wished to die, but when the tortures were too much and he would get too close to death someone would always heal him and save him.
The smile grew and Harry’s cheeks were slowly reddening. “Well I draw this on our second day back and I put it in your bag two days ago because I wanted to see how long it would take you to finally use any of your books.” Harry almost laugh seeing the mischievous glint in Draco’s eyes.
“Actually, I was thinking, considering the peace at which you are completing your studies, you will finish in a year or so after that we could, you know.” Draco just looked at him.
“You are free to go back to Hogwarts. I’m sorry that the question made you upset. The ministry gave me a whole list of questions to ask you, but I think that this is quite enough.” Draco just stared as the man stopped talking for a moment. “ Do you have anyone that could come get you. I don’t feel comfortable leaving you alone or letting you go alone when people clearly intend to hurt you.”
I actually wanted to post this chapter earlier today, but my dog ate a fucking needle so that's how my day went.
“Yeah, I’m sorry. I just. Never mind. I’m going.” He hated that he sounded unsure, so unlike himself.
Draco landed on the bed with a small gasp he felt as his breath leaves him. He recovered and managed to take a deep breath just as Harry sat on his thighs, successfully pinning him in place. The raven-haired man started to kiss his way down Draco’s torso, making sure that he kissed every part of his scars. Draco knew that he was a mess, but he couldn’t stop the moans from escaping him with every kiss Harry planted on him. When the Gryffindor started to draw near his bellbottom, Draco felt as Harry's hands started to unbutton his pants. Draco shivered at the sensation, and lifted his head watching as a smirk appeared on Harry's face.
His cheeks started to heat up again, but he managed to control his voice. “It’s actually not bad.” He noticed that Harry beamed on his words. “But, it still needs some work.” He smiled when a small grimace appeared on Harry’s face. He laughed.
The arms tighten for a moment and then his aunt spoke. “You don’t have to repay me Draco. You already help me a lot with Teddy. This is for you a place where you can be you.” He smiled at her words a place where he can be himself. He already loved it.
“I’m fine. I just need a moment. There’s no need to worry. I — I just need a moment” he couldn’t stop the tears. He was so weak. “I will be down in a second. You don’t have to wait up.” He was so pathetic, breaking down over something so stupid.
“I still need to say it. I’m sorry Mrs Weasley, for everything. I was an asshole and I’m sorry for insulting you and your family.” He felt as Mrs Weasley hugged him tighter. He never wanted to leave the hug, but his cousin, that still was in his arms had a different idea. The boy started to wiggle in his arms and Draco had to extract himself from Mrs Weasley arms in order to shift the boy higher in his arms.
He couldn’t stop himself from blurting out the question that just appeared in his mind. “Can I help you babysit tomorrow?”
When the two of them entered The Three Broomsticks the loud chatter stopped and Harry could feel all the eyes turning towards them. Before he could do anything the first wand was drawn and pointed at Draco, Harry quickly stood in front of the blond.
“Thank you for once again making my boyfriend ran away.” He was aware of the bitterness on his voice, but after all, he did deserve one moment alone with Draco.
Quickly Harry focused on the task before him, picking up the familiar knife was easy, he started to slice the ingredient his cubes came out uneven no matter how hard he tried to get them to match. Soon a hand appeared on his making him stop what he was doing. Draco was behind him, his left hand hugged Harry’s waist while his right slowly slid toward his wrist, the motion making Harry shiver. Draco’s hand finally made its way to his and the long finger closed around Harry’s slightly shaky hand.
Draco watched as Harry furrowed his eyebrows before commenting on his friend weird antics. “Well, that was suspicious.” At this comment he couldn’t hold his laughter anymore, Weasley truly was a bad layer.
“I’m good, although I’m kinda worried that something bad might happen.” He felt silly confessing this but the nagging feeling didn’t let him rest.
“What is this?” He knew that his father would scold him for his childish behaviour, but for all, he cared his father could fuck off.
Draco kissed him right under his ear. “Like this.” Moving slightly lower the blond planted a kiss on Harry's throat. “This.” This time Draco moved up and kissed him slowly taking Harry’s breath away.
Harry’s eyes lighten up at the invitation. “Since Hermione and Ron have a date night and I’m banned from my own home I think I  will stay.” Harry smiled and Draco knew that the expression on his face could only be adoration.
This is not really a chapter. I just wanted to let you all know that I posted the first chapter of my new fic called
Finally, she broke the silence. “I’m sorry to hear that.” Her voice didn’t betray anything, he didn’t know what she wanted to accomplish.
Draco was happy, the four of them decided to spend their first summer after Hogwarts away from London. Even though he missed the busyness of London, the anonymity that Spain brought with itself felt amazing. The weather was sunny and hot making, it a perfect escape place.
Polish people keep your head up, don't let them beat you. You can change everything, start with the people that surround you!
I want you all to know that I think that you are talented and should do that thing that you always wanted to do!
“Yeah, the air is weird and I don’t really like the busy cities much. I prefer being somewhere nice and quiet where muggle can't drive their cars.” He looked at Hermione and for a moment worried that she once again will take his comment as an attack on muggle inventions, but to his surprise, she smiled.
“No, I’m not leaving you. I know that you don’t have a functioning quill and I also need one, if the shopkeepers want to behave like children then they also lose me as a client.” He hoped that the annoyance that he felt did not make its way into his voice. “We can just go shopping in muggle London.”
Soon the first Wesley’s will start to attend Hogwarts alongside their children, and Harry knows that the combination of George and Angelina’s children, Fleur and Bill’s children and theirs will make for some extremely hard years. Then just as Teddy will finish the school Ron and Hermione’s first child will start the school and Sam the youngest of Draco and his adopted children will join him. It will be an exhausting period during which their oldest and middle child as well as the oldest Wesley’s will still be in school and will have the chance to corrupt the youngest generation.
Little Tom almost blushed, proud, and thrilled to receive some praise (praise was nonexistent back at Wool's. Any and all good acts were met with apathy while any and all mistakes were met with swift and severe punishment). "Nothing scares me," he replied confidently.
By six weeks, they were practically living together, effectively splitting their free time together between Hogwarts and Spinner's End. Ariel moved into his childhood home since there was no sense in hunting for a new home when his sat unlived in for 9 months out of the year and spent her days thoroughly enjoying full use of his laboratory while he worked after which they would rejoin in the evenings and enjoy each other's intimacy.
By the time Snape and Draco arrived for their impromptu midnight meeting with the Dark Lord, the general consensus of the room was, what the fuck is going on?
They both cringed, audibly. He was listing the names of her sisters, proving that he had read all the books he swore he read about her.
Ariel didn't hesitate. She looked him in the eye and said, "We both know that I can't help you kill a child."
Moments later, they were on Azkaban grounds being pelted at by strong winds and freezing ocean spray. Ariel managed to lock her knees in time and landed on dead, frosted grass upright. Before she was the massive, black towering pit of despair otherwise known as Azkaban. Ariel craned her head to look for the top of the prison but it disappeared in the stormy clouds above. She then glanced at Bellatrix who had her arms folded across her chest, smirking. An hourglass dangled out of her robe's pocket swinging violently in the blustery air.
"You know why we met ma?" Voldemort told her in a cold unfeeling voice that Snape and the rest of his followers most associated with him. He leaned forward and said, "Remember those two kids from the orphanage? The ones who came into the cave with me? I lead them in there. I was going to kill them. I planned on bashing their heads in. That's why we met. Not because you were kind but because I was what I am now—I am a god of death. And soon, no one will be able to stop me."
A thwacking noise jerked Ariel out of dreamless sleep. She opened her blurry eyes to find she was on the ground. Confused, she raised her head only to find that she was still in the Gaunt family cemetery.
"I don't know why," Bellatrix said acrimoniously. "I spent twelve years in Azkaban for that man. I barely got a thank you. This fishy bitch is here for two hours and he thanked her forty times for being "a spectacular influence on him"." Then, Bellatrix gasped. "You don't think he wants to fuck her, do you?"
Hermione charged towards him, mouth opened, ready to lecture him into coming with them but then a horrible wrenching noise came out of her. To Harry and Ron's disgust, she was doubled-over, puking up the four Butterbeers and plate of fried pixie fingers she consumed that night.
Ariel smiled at him then read the tale of "the Wizard and the Hopping Pot" which he listened to in captivated silence.
When Ariel went downstairs that next morning, she found an ocean of flowers awaiting her. All kinds: sunflowers, lilacs, lilies, tulips, foxgloves, rare ones like the iridescent fire irises of Iran, and roses in every hue even blue and aquamarine. Vases of these beautiful flowers occupied every flat surface of that one room and it smelled so fragrant and divine it was like stepping into a small paradise. She beamed immediately at Voldemort who stood in the middle of it and acted earnest when he explained, "I didn't know which was your favorite so I made the florist give me every flower known in the world."
"We should make this a weekly thing." He said, trying and failing to sound off-hand as he suggested, "Maybe make Mondays into Mother-Son days."
His quick lie made the Dark Lord smile. "Such a well-mannered young man." To Ariel, he said, "You know it's funny, I was talking to Draco, here, about how, as a late Saturnalia gift, I was going to send a bunch of elves to clean this house—because I couldn't help but notice how filthy this place has gotten over the years—and Draco, here, not only offers up his services but he insists on doing it without magic!"
"It's a habit," he said. "I was taught it's rude to call adults by their first name. And since you don't have a surname, I thought Lady Ariel was the only proper way to address you."
He hadn't slept more than two hours continuously since he got back to Hogwarts. Every time he managed to fall asleep the Dark Lord's voice would slither into his dreams, reminding him with flashes of his father's misery, what would happen to his entire family should he fail.
Draco felt his spine rust over with terror. He looked to Snape but only saw that his godfather's cold calculating eyes were focused on his master.
"Well, I stand corrected," Bellatrix replied with a cat-like grin as their fingers intertwined, readying themselves for departure. "I got to admit I
She obliged, her voice getting louder, huskier, and more desperate for his skillful touch. His tongue ran back and forth over her clit, faster and faster, the louder she screamed his name. Soon the whole room was filled with the sounds and smell of her pleasure. He wouldn't stop. Not until he was sure she had enjoyed herself thoroughly.
“Ariel.” Voldemort said in a friendly voice as he quickly stuffed his wand into his robes and walked through the shallow puddles of blood over to her. “What are you doing here?”
His words caught the attention of Alana, Attinna, and Aquatta who had railed around Ariel, demanding to know the why's and how's and when's of this adoption tale.
"Oh, don't be such a prude, Potter," Draco replied coyly, inching closer towards him, reveling in the discomfort he was sure to create. "There's no shame in desiring other men."
Snape watched her leap, dash, sprint, twirl, run in circles, attempt a cartwheel, fall to the ground laughing, get back up, and dance badly. He couldn't help but take pride in her unbridled joy.
Draco laughed so hard tears came out of his eyes and his nose was running. It was the first time all year he laughed that hard.
Only then, he thought to himself bitterly as he made his way alongside the breezy lakeside of Hogwarts, will I finally be—
But how could he plot when his eyes couldn't bare the garish sunlight coming through his classroom's windows? How was his supposed to think of a plan to fulfill his order when his head felt like it was filled with mud? He couldn't bare it. He needed sleep. He needed rest, desperately. And that's why he found himself, half-dead, in front of Snape's office door his limbs so heavy from exhaustion he could barely bring himself to knock.
He loved ice fishing. Or his version of it anyway. He loved the cold and the wait and feel of ice crystallizing against his bare feet, melting then hardening then freezing against his flesh. He couldn't wait to peel his feet from the ice, yanking off a huge chunk of his flesh along the way nor more than he could wait for an unlucky fish to swim his way.
Draco secretly believed the dark mark sucked the ability to sleep out of you. Since he joined the Dark Lord's ranks, sleep eluded him.
Voldemort wasn't much of a singer but thankfully with Ariel's voice, he could sing a Hungarian Horntail into letting him ride its back, literally.
"Well," Attina said with a happy laugh as the witnesses broke out into overjoyed cheers, drowning out the eldest sister's voice as she tried to continue, "With this I now pronounce you two—"
She turned away but Draco hesitated to follow her. He searched for the Dark Lord's eyes, to make sure it was okay first, but the only one in the living room when he looked was Nagini, coiled up and snoozing on an armchair. His stomach gurgled, louder, begging him to eat but his gut warned him against the idea. You can't eat now! You must flee! Danger is near!
"Did you hear?" "Hear what?" "No?" "There was…" "No!" "Yes!" "We lost…" "Merlin's Beard." "For fuck's sake!" "How?" "Who?!"
She looked down at herself, having forgotten she had tugged on her swimsuit mere minutes beforehand. "I am. I'm going to go to visit my sisters."
Ariel pinched him in the upper arm. "You're such an asshole." Tom feigned as if she had stabbed him and she pinched him again harder to which he let out an actual yelp of pain. But then they dissolved into fits of laughter and for a moment it felt like old times.
It was Tom's sixteenth beach day with Wool's but come New Year's Eve he would turn seventeen thus ending all legal obligation to stay in the muggle world. Free to live his life in the magical world, untethered by the past.
"Mom…" Voldemort said, his voice as gentle as the wind. "I'd like you to meet…" He gestured to Ariel with an open, flat palm and said something he wanted to say for decades, "Mom."
"Decades!" Voldemort cried out with a laugh as he flung his arms open wide and stepped forward to embrace her. He folded his arms around her but she was too shocked and terrified to return to the hug. But he didn't seem to notice her stiff spine or her flared, disbelieving eyes when he drew backward, his cold dusty hands clapped onto her upper arms and peered down at her face, grinning. "Sixty years if you can believe it!"
Draco did as asked and watched in amazement as the Dark Lord beheaded the fish with one loud heavy-handed CHOP then methodically began to debone, gut and cube the meat.
"Sounds splendid," he replied his voice so uncharacteristically airy and warm it sent a chill down Lucius's spine. He looked up at Bellatrix and told the stony-faced witch, "Come along and join us, Bellatrix. We should give the husband and wife some precious alone time." Bellatrix compiled without hesitation, following Ariel into the hallway. Voldemort lingered in the doorway and said, without breaking eye contact with Lucius, "Welcome back home, Lucius. I can't wait to hear the details of your daring escape."
"Another thing we have in common," he murmured. "I meant about having a lot of enemies, not about having a tail. Obviously."
He tried to remember when he first arrived to visit. It had to have been no later than noon. Did he really sleep twelve hours? That was more than six times what he normally slept.
"Sorry I'm late," he announced, as he climbed down from the rocks to find Ariel swimming patiently in the same area he first met her. "Someone syphoned the gas from the bus again so we had to walk the rest of the way."
“What do you mean if I still want to? You’re the one that got the unfortunate luck of starting an affair with Lord Voldemort’s adopted mother.” Ariel argued, self-deprecatingly. She gave him an appraising side glance and remarked, “A saner man would run while he had the chance.”
"You know, you're welcome to come and meet your aunts if you want," Ariel said to the back of his head.
"Of course, My Lord," Narcissa assured as she corked the bottle of wine, tucked it under her pillow, and sat upright in her bed attentively. "How—how can I help you?"
"Nar, have you lost your mind?" Lucius said in a terrified whisper. His pale face lost the little bit of color it had at that moment. He hoped against hope that the Dark Lord had forgiven him for his trespasses at last summer. He thought the red-headed woman was his gesture of clemency. But if he didn't send for him, then that means the Dark Lord still hadn't accepted his failure to retrieve the prophecy. Which only meant one thing. "You've doomed us both."
Ariel let out a dejected sigh then told him, her voice rife with emotion, "I can't stand looking at it." She punctuated her sentence by punching her tail. "Every day, it mocks me. Every day, I beg and plea and pray that one day I'll wake up and it'll be gone. Just so I can go out and make my limb regeneration potion, get some legs, live on land, be apart of this magical world at last. And every day, I wake up heartbroken because it's still there. And I'm still…"
Ariel dropped her hand only to find Bellatrix's hand slipping into hers a second later. She glanced at the dark-haired witch, who told her, half-mockingly "Hang on, Lady Ariel." With that, they disappeared from the laboratory in a dizzying wind.
"You know you're a lightweight for an evil wizard." She said as she took a seat on the edge of the bed. "You barely had half a cup before you were passed out."
"Wait," Narcissa spoke up slowly. "So, this potion not only disguises your voice but it can transfer magical properties over to the drinker?"
What's the problem? I finally meet the woman of my dreams and it turns out she's the Dark fucking Lord's fucking idol, that's the problem.
He didn't agree. Inwardly, he suspected that he never felt safe enough to sleep for that long—to let his body surrender to such a vulnerable state when there were always foes afoot—but for the first time in his life, he could trust someone to protect him. He could feel at home, sleep in this bed in his mother's house, and rest, knowing she was nearby.
Ariel clinked her cup into the width of the wine bottle before she swallowed the whole of the content. Within seconds, she felt the blood in her body warm and her brain cells start to buzz pleasantly.
A few moments of silence past before one of the iron doors cracked open. A dementor came out to greet her, its cold faceless visage peering down at her like it wanted nothing more than to gobble her soul whole.
She blinked at him but before she could answer Dennis's voice cried out, in confusion, from behind, "Do what? I didn't do anything."
"I don't care," he croaked, his tears rolling down her tail and blending in with the drops of lake water that hadn't yet evaporated.
Bellatrix went ahead with a solemn face and averted eyes as she gave Lord Voldemort and the pseudo-siren she had kidnapped a low, unyielding bow. "My Lord." She said with deep reverence. Then she picked up her back only to bent it again for Ariel tips of her long scraggly brown hair brushed the floor before Ariel's still-bare-feet, her voice almost halting as she pled, "Lady Ariel." To Ariel's discomfort, Bellatrix took the groveling one step further by dropping to her knees, crawling closer to Ariel, grabbing her by the hand and profusely kissing her fingers, pleading in-between wet kisses, "Forgive me for my earlier trespasses." (Kiss kiss kiss) "I know I deserve to be punished for my earlier trespasses" (kiss kiss kiss) "but had I known—"
Snape remembered being in a bar. It was late and he had a vague feeling telling him that he should be going somewhere, looking for someone. Then a male silvery voice came from the side and said, "Hey handsome. Can I buy you a drink?"
His face was that of such pure loathing, burning, eyes narrowed with that terrible glint in his eyes that she saw all those months ago, when she was just a kidnapped enemy, before she was special to him. His mouth was a tight line. Then a horrible second later, his lips parted wide when he threw his arm above his head.
"If it makes you feel any better, lots of people get motion sickness when they apparate for the first time." Draco offered as he and Snape helped her to her feet.
He stood there trying to look embarrassed. "Mom, stop!" He protested without conviction. But she gave him a few more kisses and another tight embrace. Once she was done, she took a step back and appraised him. Her noseless, pale, gray-skinned, bald, heavily scarred, snake-looking, vicious, cruel, spiteful, narrow-minded, angry, too-smart-for-his-own-good, loving, witty, thoughtful, sweetheart son.
He was stunned to find the downstairs bloodless but relieved to hear humming instead of screaming. Ariel was on the couch with Nagini, stroking the venomous snake's long body while it slithered triumphantly along the back of the couch.
She nodded. "To this day, he gets upset whenever I bring up Sebastian around him. Or call him crabby."
Ariel's heart seized and burned for him so profoundly after that if he had asked her to ruin her life for him, she would've without hesitation.
The dementor did nothing for a while, merely floated there, ominously. As if trying to determine her lies from truth. But she was flush with liquid courage and locked eyes with the faceless ghoul, who eventually turned around and, to Bellatrix's delight, led her inside the prison.
"I can't help it," he said his eyes pinned on Ariel. He turned his head to his aunts and told them, "I'm still in awe that a creature like her took an interest in me. I mean, she would go out of her way, once a year, to spend the day with me. Me. This no-nothing child that she didn't owe a single thing to. I used to look forward to that day more than Christmas and my birthday and every holiday combine. And there was never a day that we spent together that wasn't filled with joy and laughter and wisdom and love…No, no, it's true. You were a perfect older figure to me. Your sister was the first person in my life to make me feel loved and valued and cared for…And…And…" He turned to Ariel, his eyes shining with stuck tears, face soft with the need to know. "Mom, I have to know. Why? Why, out of all the children in the world, why did you choose me? Why me?"
"Did you make me give the coin back to you?" Tom asked, modulating his voice so that it was less of a demand and more of a question.
Ariel laughed with him, telling the teen once the laughter faded, "I thought you'd get a kick out of that."
Ariel went to Malfoy manor first, thinking he would be there either torturing the Malfoys or torturing someone else at the illustrious manor.
Ariel was alone, in the living room, with the newest issue of Potions Heads Monthly when a soft sibilant sound pulled her nose out of the magazine. She looked up and found Nagini floating above her head, staring at her with unblinking black eyes, her little black tongue poking at her, hissing away as if saying, you smell good enough to taste. But Ariel didn't flinch or scream or was startled in any way to see that man-eating cobra instead she gave the fearsome beast a small smile then reached up and gave its chin an affectionate scratch.
Worse, she could feel Death was nearby, standing before her. She felt their presence like a panic attack.
Narcissa gave confused Bellatrix a closed-lipped grin and explained, "Our esteemed guest wanted a tour of the estate."
He let out a cold laugh them turned his head at Ariel and said, vindictively, "Good." Then he pushed himself from the bed and stride out of the room, demanding, "Make sure she's transported to the safe house."
Draco had to will himself not to flinch at the sound of the Dark Lord's name. A cold chill came over him as the images of previous nights' events replayed in his head. "I have no idea what you're talking about, Potter." He replied coolly, taking a swig from his glass. "I don't work for the Dark Lord."
He paced the small bathroom floor a thousand times, his head burning with scenarios, convinced that his bad manners were going to get that kind creature killed... or worse (there was always a worst-worst case scenario when it came to the Dark Lord).
The Dark Lord smiled nastily at the room. Their consternation, their fears, were intoxicating to him. Then, he took the chair, pulled it out from underneath the table and proclaimed, "That's why I wanted to introduce to you someone who has been a spectacular influence on me for the last sixty years."
A split second later, the mirth in Voldemort's face died, replaced by a rage that contorted and scrunched his face. Fenrir's face paled instantly as he felt his body being bound by invisible forces, reducing his muscular body into a rigid heap. The air in his lungs slowly started to seep out of him, both from fear and from the Dark Lord's will, and he felt his throat constrict the little oxygen he had left. He gasped for air, his face reddening as he slowly and painfully began to suffocate. He could only watch as Voldemort drew closer to him and told him, to his everlasting horror, "That red-head is my mother, you colossal fucking idiot."
To her and Bellatrix's shock, the snake-faced man waved his arm allowing her body to gently drop to the ground while the invisible shackles fell from her limbs and lips.
"It should be. It is 200-year-old vampire wine after all." Narcissa informed with faint pride as she poured herself a second cup.
Bellatrix snatched the bag and started rummaging around. "Ha, nerd." She laughed, pulling out a copy of Potions Head Monthly to deride her. But then her hand touched the crown and her eyes bulged out of her head as she held it in her hand, looking equal parts mesmerized and baffled.
Ariel nodded, doing her best to keep her face neutral as cold disgust coagulated in her bloodstream.
"I had to make sure." He said as he wordlessly conjured a handkerchief with his wand and handed it to her. "For some reason, I have a hard time believing people aren't always trying to kill me."
"Maybe you don't," Ariel remarked with a shrug. "But you know, I've lived a long life, and the one thing I've noticed is: things are a lot easier when you're not doing everything on your own."
A blinding rage threatened to pour out of the Dark Lord but he managed to suppress it long enough to join in on Fenrir as the werewolf chuckled salaciously.
When Ariel gestured for him to step into the circle, he jogged to join her and laced his fingers around hers, planting a quick chaste kiss on her cheekbone as they disappeared from Spinner's End.
She tossed the floo powder at the ground, crying out, "Diagon Alley." With a loud blast of green flame, she was gone and Snape stood there, staring at the spot she last stood wistfully, before he remembered Draco.
He thought the way most people who chase a dream believe, that his ascent from Potion's Masters to his dream of being a Defense Against the Dark Arts professor would solve everything. He thought it meant he would finally be happy and that happiness would cure everything else—the depression, the self-loathing, insomnia. He dared to think that accomplishing his life-long goal would turn everything else in his life around but sadly, he discovered less than a week after the school year started, that his stupid brain didn't care if he had the dream job or that he wasn't in Azkaban or homeless. It didn't care that he was the youngest potion's masters of the school's history or that he had earned Dumbledore's trust or that he had several talents and skills acquired through a lifetime of studying and discipline. It was why, on this day, twenty minutes after midnight, that Snape finally had the epiphany that just because you land the dream job, get the dream salary, get the coveted office (away from the dungeons and the draft and the muffled but undrownable sounds of his horny students' squeaky beds from above)—none of that meant anything if he still had to deal with himself. Even a prick like Snape could recognize just how much of prick he was which only served to make him pray for Death to come already and snuff out his rotten waste of a life.
"Because…" He started then stopped. He almost told her the truth. He never told adults the truth if he could avoid it. Yet this adult—this mermaid, who despite being a different species than him was still older than him and thus considered to be another odious adult to him—was threatening to break his self-imposed rule of never telling anymore what happened at Wool's.
He walked to the head of the tablet, clasped his pale spider-like fingers around the headboard of his chair and told the room, "As I'm sure you are all aware, we lost five members to our organization today."
"Well," Bellatrix said with a wide-toothed smile as she took the bottle of wine from Narcissa, walked over to Ariel and refilled the teacup that sat beside her on the floor, "Cheers to you on becoming an official potions-maker."
She glowered, quacking with rage. He smiled, victoriously until Ariel threw her entire body at him. He reacted fast, but she caught onto him, and when he disappeared he took her with him.
"Yes, it's an honor to give you my room while I'm away," Draco said hurriedly like a man on his way to confession he didn't want to make. "But I want to throw this out there: all that stuff you see on my walls…it's for a project."
After a few hours, Voldemort begged for an escort home which Scrimgeour was glad to oblige. He sent two veteran Aurors who jumped at the chance to do this favor, to be the knights in sleek robes for a pair of damsels in distress.
"Fine," Hermione shrugged before she tossed the liquid back. She gulped it down in seconds and came back up to the sound of her two best friends' cheers.
"I will never understand how anybody can find cleaning without magic peaceful," said Voldemort to Ariel. "But he insisted."
(This wasn't a lie either. One time he didn't feed Nagini for 15 hours and he came home to a half-eaten couch.)
She landed in an ankle-high pile of ashes, which shot back up into the narrow chimney and stung her mouth and eyes, causing her to cough. She was waving away tendrils of smoke when she stepped out of the fireplace to find Bellatrix, Narcissa and Voldemort dripping from head to toe in blood, each pointing a wand directly at her.
He climbed over a set of rocks and leaned forward to discover, just beyond the rocks laid a cove were in the cove beheld an assortment of wonders: Books, paintings, tea kettles, jewels, gold chalices, pots, pans, utensils, great treasures mixed with everyday items like a ramshackle museum.
Nothing hurt. She could breathe as deeply as she wanted. Her hand no longer burned or throbbed. It didn't even bleed. The cut turned out to be no deeper than a cat scratch. It took Ariel three minutes to calm down her deep, panicked breathing.
Narcissa managed to pull herself together long enough to give him a vigorous nod, promising her silence.
Ariel sighed, disappointed but unsurprised. "Well, thanks for your honesty, Professor Severus." She started to turn, to dive back into the lake and swim away when Snape's hand tapped her lightly on the upper arm.
“So, Bellatrix wouldn’t walk in, see us and try to kill you in a jealous rage,” He replied. Then with a laugh, he said, “She truly hates you.”
“I love you too, mom.” He whispered, holding her head in his hands until the light slowly faded from her eyes and her body slumped backwards into the sea of softness.
"I hate you!" The eight-year-old boy screamed, punching and kicking the Dark Lord who took the abuse without resistance. "This is all your fault!"
Tom beamed at her, eyes stinging, lips shaking from smiling too hard. She held out her hand for him and he propelled himself into the waters to reach for it.
"Yes, him. Now I know you're only trying to do your job and I respect that, I do, but if I could just speak to this man for a few minutes…" Ariel started but her sentence trailed off as she watched the strange man lowered himself to his knees until his black eyes and her blue eyes were at the same level.
He punctuated the speech with a small plea because he found himself unhinged under her warm smile and her big blue eyes which he feared would undo him entirely if he were to spend another second being looked at by her.
"I don't think we should…" Dennis began fearfully, taking timid glances over his shoulder to the mouth of the cave.
He opened his mouth to correct her but he was stopped by a growing warmth in his heart. That little shit, he thought tenderly.
So what?! You have to be a morally reprehensible person to be liked by the darkest wizard to ever live!
"So, tell me," Voldemort began slowly his voice speciously pleasant. Lucius opened his mouth to speak but Voldemort cut him at the wick. "Not you." He then swerved his head to Ariel and said, sweetly, "Ariel. Tell me. What happened in the thirty minutes I was gone?"
When Scrimgeour opened the door to find them, his heart broke instantly for the pair. It was too easy for Voldemort, with Ariel's magical voice and his talents for manipulating others, to make the minister of magic believe a hundred or so lies: how they were twins that were kidnapped during a sister's day shopping spree at Diagonalley ("there was just this explosion... then I looked up it was just You Know Who and five dead bodies...") how for the last few months they'd been kept in a room with no windows and kept as sex objects; how eventually He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named started confiding in them about future plans (the scheme to blow up Stonehenge, recruiting gnomes and invading Iceland) and how, after a daring miraculous escape, they came to that cottage in the middle of nowhere with the earnest hope to be apart of the team "to thwart his diabolical plans"
"Good. I'm making trout." She turned her head to the pile of onions then looked at him again and said, "Sweetheart you don't have to stand there. Take a seat if you want."
"But...um...you know, I was thinking... it is pretty pathetic that my number one nemesis is still a child. I figured, eh, his birthday's a month from now. He can fight me like a man."
She used a play from Narcissa handbook to ensure Dumbledore and Potter could explore that cave wouldn't running into her son.
"Oh. Good then." Voldemort said, his voice back easing back to its normal octave. "This actually makes the next topic I have to talk to you about much easier. At some point before, during, or after you…ugh…go to town on each other, I need you to convince her to help me kill Harry Potter."
She looked down at his hand sitting on top of hers then lifted her head and said, "I remember looking at you and just knowing right away that you were full of this…rage. I figured, maybe, if I became your friend…you wouldn't grow up to be a serial murderer."
He hugged her for what felt like an entire hour in silence. She planted her ear against his chest while he rested his chin on her crown. For a while, they stood there, in the middle of that old house, listening to each other's pulses, breathing in each other's scent. To her, he smelled like sand and seaweed. To him, she smelled like coconut oil and the Earth before a thunderstorm.
"I can give you one now if you want," Narcissa offered calmly though inwardly she was eager to finally get a chance at some alone time with this creature.
I don't care, said a second voice as he combed through the tall reeds, his feet treading on squishy mud as he pulled himself closer to the body of water. Let it be the last thing I ever hear.
Every time she called him sweetheart it felt like a comforting breeze against exposed sweaty skin. He felt himself ease a little bit with water sloshing in his belly.
Narcissa winked at Ariel before she pulled a half-drank bottle of wine from her robe's pocket and poured a generous serving into the two teacups. They toasted silently before they both tossed back the contents, laughing as they coughed up fire and poison.
A childhood hero of yours truly…Her eyes, head, and stomach swirled as her brain forced her to relive those words. She fought down visceral shame and abject despair when his voice finally broke through her, asking, cheerfully, "Sugar?"
"Now," the Dark Lord began as he started to walk slowly around the table, "At first, when I found out, I was furious. Absolutely furious. After all, how could we lose five members in a random Thursday morning squabble, right? But then, I found out who the person responsible for such an attack was…" The Dark Lord turned on his heel and started back to the chair. Everyone waited with bated breath as they watched him return to his chair and rubbed his chalky hand against the ornate back of the chair before he turned his attention back to the room and said, "Then, that's when I realized—this was my fault."
Narcissa smiled into her cup but Ariel noticed when she raised the cup to her lips her eyes creased with quiet despair.
Bellatrix was refilling her teacup when she asked, "So tell me about this creation of yours. What does it do? And what inspired you to make it?"
Hogwarts, despites its beauty at nights, felt more like a catacomb lately. A catacomb that rarely offered peace of sleep but instead waves after wave of disappointment, miseries and some of the dumbest young people on the face of the Earth.
"Please let me have this," she begged her voice so soft and cracked with emotion he had to relent and she continued, "I know you hate goodbyes, but I just wanted to say," (she grabbed his hand and gave the first four fingers a loving squeeze) "That I am so proud of you and that I love you so much and that I wish you nothing but the best of luck with whatever path you choose in life."
"I know." He said with a dejected sigh. He was lying flat against the wet sand, staring at the abject darkness.
Voldemort inhaled deeply then smiled at the ceiling. The air smelled faintly of lemon drops and mothballs. "Ah, Albus." He said with a malicious smile as he slowly walked out of the doorway. "You just don't learn old man, do you?"
"Why do you want to control people so badly?" She asked after she took a seat on the water-logged sand, leaving her tail in the waters.
Arista let out a false gasp of offense while a shadow of a flattered grin tugging at the corners of her lovely lips. "What lies has my sister told you of me?"
Ariel tried to catch a glimpse at the cover of the book he took but only saw symbols she didn't understand written, in what looked like, crystallized blood. She didn't have to know what the book was called to know the book possessed an energy that sent a clammy fear down her spine. It was clear that this book held the power to create, and teach great evil and that if she let him walk away with that book it would cause great harm.
“I don’t know. He seems pretty fond of that…” She snapped her fingers, trying to jog her memory. “Shrine boy.”
"Ugh, all these rules. I feel like I'm back in school." Ariel opened her mouth to scold him when Voldemort cut her off, "I was only teasing, mother. You know I'd do anything for you."
She knew, the way most people who spoke with Voldemort knew, he was probably lying but she ignored it in order to appraise him. It had been nearly two months since they last saw each other and he looked terrible even for him. The white in his eyes was streaked with red and he bore the haggard, shallow-faced expression of a man who hadn't seen sunlight in many weeks. Purple and green veins glistened against his bald head like fresh claw marks.
"Um." Narcissa did not know how to answer that question without getting killed or maimed so she circumvented the question with another question. "My Lord, have you ever heard of the word association game?"
"Of course I—Ariel I love you more than I love anyone or anything in this entire universe. I love you more than I love myself and I love myself way too fucking much." Ariel smiled so hard her face looked like it was going to crack down the middle. "I can't believe you didn't know that by now." He said, offended.
Narcissa, fearing if she didn't at least try to comfort him he would torture her for it later, pulled the blankets off of her, and bravely approached the fetal-positioned Dark Lord.
"You can't intrude if you're being invited." She replied, taking a half step towards him, wearing the sweetest smile. "Besides, I'm sure my sisters would love to meet their nephew."
But Voldemort didn't turn his head. He continued giving her this hard stare like he was only now realized her defiance.
Ariel grinned but her eyes drifted down to his mouth and the smile faded at the corners. "You know what the first thing I thought when I heard you say my name?"
"Young?" Lucius blurted out, unhinged by the surrealness of the scene: this red-headed woman, who looked young enough to date his son, talking to the Dark Lord like she knew him for years, sharing a drink and a laugh with the man like he wasn't the most dangerous apex predator to walk the face of the Earth, and most bizarrely, all the while Bellatrix sat by without so much as a hint of jealousy in her eyes, like all of this was normal.
"I just want to see if he could make it sound sexy," said Arista as she made her way to embrace Ariel. She glanced over her shoulder, her bright orchid eyes blinking curiously at the young man who hung back at the edge of the lagoon. When she let go, she asked her sister, "Aren't you going to introduce us to your shy friend?"
"You lie every time you open your fucking mouth!" She lifted her head in time for him to pour the copper-tasting liquid down her open mouth. She stalled. They all did.
Ariel made a derisive snort. "I might as well be." Then her angry face contorted as another crying fit came over her. She squeezed her mouth in an attempt to make the tears stop but he quickly succumbed to weeping and the two men had to watch, helplessly, as she croaked out, "I loved that boy so much." She buried her head in her hands and moaned, "I loved him so much…" She lifted her head and told them, "I would've adopted him in a heartbeat if I could've. If it wasn't illegal…If I had legs…you have no idea how often I fantasized about what I would've done…I would've taken him away from that awful place…" She let out a sad laugh. "I would've kicked the crap out of every worker in that shithole orphanage and then I would've loved that little boy 'til my last dying breath." She wiped her face with her sleeves and forced out a bitter laugh, "I guess I still do. God, what's wrong with me?"
Ariel plunged forward. Her mouth landed on his softly but quickly their soft kisses got rougher, hungrier, more insatiable. Soon, they were all hands, groping, touching, clutching at another, their bodies pressed so hard into each other they looked like two halves of cells trying to fuse together, all gasps and moans and empty of thought. Ariel straddled his waist and rubbed her unclothed mound into his covered erection and they moaned loudly with anticipation.
Within minutes, she felt it. That rapturous climb. She arched her back, squeezed her thighs against his head, and yelled, "YES! SEVERUS! YES! I'M COMING!" He unhinged his jaw to gobble as much of her as he could while she finally burst. It was magnificent. Her first orgasms in literal decades and it was just as wonderful as she remembered.
Voldemort stormed inside the shack with his wand drawn. He stood in the doorway, waiting for an attack to come. His eyes darted across every inch of the room, searching for this foe. Minutes passed. "Reveal yourself," he ordered the empty room.
She whirled around to discover the Dark Lord sitting at her kitchen table, venomous Nagini draped across his shoulders, book in hand, with a smile on his face that made her insides melt with terror.
“Good. Use that. Better to be scared of him than to let him trick you into a false sense of security.”
Ariel looked up from her copy of Potions Heads Monthly, in stunned silence. He reached over and took her hand, explaining, "I know it's sudden. But with everything going on, I'd be honored if I could spend the last few years of my life being your husband."
Four plain tombstones awaited them in a single row with the exception of one lonely and noticeably smaller slab which hung in the back of the lot by a craggily oak tree in a grassless plot of land that couldn't be reached by the sun, like an outcast. The ones closest to the house were hidden by patches of tall grass, their names and their years on Earth defaced by rain and cruel passage of time.
"I am Lucius Malfoy's attorney and I need to speak with him at once," Ariel ordered, authoritatively as she shivered from the torrents of gelid water raining down on her.
"Whatever it is, it would be an honor to serve the Dark Lord's mother." Bellatrix avowed rising to her feet to get uncomfortably close to Ariel, adding with a sultry whisper, "And I mean that in every way possible."
Snape looked to the side like he spotted a ghost in the corner. Then after a heartbeat, he said, “When he killed my best friend and her spouse, I knew I was on the wrong side.”
"I...guessed that," Ariel replied, still in shock. "Um...uhhhhhh...I'm going to... ignore all of this if you do me a small favor."
"Yeah. Wow." She said sarcastically as she let her tail rest in the patch of unclaimed earth. Her eyes were narrowed and her posture was hunched as she continued, "I hate that tail more than I hate my enemies combined. And I have a lot of those."
She expected pain. Instead, she was met with the sounds of rumbles as the world violently shook. She opened her eyes in alarm expecting the earth to collapse underneath her and swallow her whole. But it didn't though.
Inverto Homonous, he thought fondly. One of his finest inventions. "I don't want to brag but... yes. How did you hear about that?"
"No-no-no! Ask her if she's proud of us!" Young Adult Tom's ghost insisted. "Then ask for specifics."
From there, the conversation changed. Tom floated quietly while he lost himself in their various conversations, giving half-truths to questions when they were thrown his way, smiling often, occasionally darting out of the lagoon to sip from his collection of Polyjuice brew.
The Dark Lord said it himself. She's been a "spectacular influence" over him. Maybe she still holds some sway with the wizard…
Then she turned around and revealed the loveliest face and the prettiest smile which she delivered onto him, welcomingly. His face went cold with fear.
"I bet we could find buried treasure in here," Tom told them tantalizingly. Even back then, he knew the best form of persuasion involved riches.
"Damn." His face dropped. He appeared mildly disappointed. "I lost the pool." Noticing his follower's visible incomprehension, he explained, "There's a bet going around on when you'd beg her to marry you. I guessed around New Years'."
She gave him another charming smile, held out her hand for him to take, which he did without hesitation, and the two of them started towards the castle, giddy with horniness.
"What kind of bullshit is this?" Bellatrix exclaimed, half-dismayed and half-seething with jealousy as she stood against the glass door that separated the kitchen to the giant, well-manicured, and albino infested garden with her sister. They were watching the Dark Lord hold an animated conversation with the red-headed land siren.
He smiled to himself. He knew this feeling wouldn't last long but he dared himself to believe that he deserved to feel this happiness. And when another voice in his head tried to remind him, no this feeling is unearned you're still an awful human being, for once he was able to point to a good deed and say, but I did one good thing today and that better mean I am better than I was yesterday.
Ariel dumped her drink into the sink, then poured the rest of the sleeping draught spiked rum down the drain as well. Then she turned to her drooling monster.
"This is incredible," he said breathlessly as his charmed quill furiously transcribed all the fake plans. "You're so brave for doing this."
With that, he reached forward, tapped Ariel on the hand, and said, his voice soaked with sincerity, "I can't thank you enough for what you've done for me." Then he paused and she noticed a realization cross over his eyes. "Hm. I just realized…I think you were the first person to actually give a shit about me. Hm." Then he let out a dismissive laugh as he took another sip of tea.
"Yes," Narcissa informed with a closed-lipped smile as Ariel dashed over to the cauldron, with the zeal of a child who spotted a coveted toy.
Moments later, Voldemort crossed over into the light like a ghost sliding out of one realm and into the next. He had his wand out and he wore an unreadable expression.
"Hey, baby," called out a janky-looking wizard into her ear as she passed by him and four other similarly dressed wizards smoking together against a brick corner. He made loud kissy noises at her and cried out obnoxiously, "I love your hair. Love to see what color your nipple hair looks like."
"I think this is the wettest I've ever been, out of the ocean." She breathed before she straddled his hips and started riding him.
"Severus Snape." He corrected with a charmed smile of a man who experienced serendipity for the first time in his life.
"You…you adopted a witch?" Arista gasped her voice pitchy as it started to crack as tears appeared in her big, violet eyes.
Slowly, they rubbed at each other, squirming with delight at other's touch. Their mouths hung open like draw bridges as their breathing went ragged from enflamed desire. It was wonderfully naughty, trying to keep their passions low as they fondled another underneath this grimy booth. There was no one in the bar catch them. The bartender was out on a smoke break and Ruth was napping in a pile of hay. And for a few glorious minutes, they were no longer Harry Potter the boy who lived or Draco Malfoy the boy without options. They were simply two horny teenagers shuddering and gasping, and stealing kisses, in a smelly, dimly lit old wizard's bar.
“Of course you can stay as long as you need Draco. But I have one condition.” At this both Harry and Malfoy look at Andromeda, he noted Malfoy just looks resigned as if he waited for an impossible demand to be placed on him.
“With the amount of time you spend practising I am sure that you will be the best, even better than Harry was.” Harper smiled at him.
As a treat and compensation for my absence, I made them hold hands for almost the whole chapter. Have fun!
Harry quickly pulled Hagrid towards his jacket, when the Half-Giant finally put it on, he coaxed him out of the hut. The five of them started to talk about the holidays and Harry stepped closer to his boyfriend. “I love you.”
“Well, first of all, I don’t think you need fixing, you may be damaged but you are not broken. Second of all, I will always try to help the ones that need it, and it’s not my saving people thing so before you get to that conclusion I want to stop you right there. I believe that you need saving about as much as I do. So I have a proposition, we help each other. The past month was one of the most relaxing months I had in forever and you had a lot to do with it, I don’t want our friendship to end when we are back at Hogwarts” Harry could see a small smile slowly making its way onto Draco’s face. “And I’m sure that you also want to stay friends. So we help each other heal okay?”
He looked so withered and pitiful like a deer during the food-barren winter months. All his dignities, his pride, were gone.
Draco quietly set his mop and bucket down on the first floor and walked back up the flight of steps with a broom in hand so he could sweep from the top down. He walked on his tiptoes so his footfalls wouldn't cause the old steps to creak too loudly as the pair continued on. But the Dark Lord must have sensed he was eavesdropping because after that their conversation devolved into snickers and whispers. His ears pricked, trying desperately to catch a phrase or two, but after a while, he gave up and focused on his cleaning.
He was relieved to heard movement on the other side of the door. He was so sleep-deprived he barely stirred when he heard a distinctly feminine voice ask, "Who's that?"
Ariel was utterly speechless. She merely stared at the undead army in thunderstruck agog as they groaned and rasped hungrily and roared at the irritating light and meandered about mindlessly.
It was the biggest bald-faced lie he'd ever made in his short life. But Draco would have said anything to keep the Dark Lord's wand from turning onto him or, worse, his parents.
The look on her face one would have thought he had admitted to cannibalism. "Don't say things like that Draco."
Ariel held the treasures to her chest and wept not out of guilt or shame or regret but out of love. Love for the boy in the cave nobody loved. Love for the young man in the cave who had to destroy himself to prove his self-worth. Love for the evil wizard who surprised her, time and time again, with his capacity to love.
"Why shouldn't I be happy?" Ron asked. "The sun is shining, five Death Eaters got killed today, it's Thursday which means it's only one more half-day until the weekend, there's a good possibility that Malfoy is dead and or at least crying, and as of right this second, I am officially all caught up with my homework."
He left the frozen lake once he caught enough fish for the three of them. His bloodied footprints trailed the frozen lake and disappeared into the back door of the old house.
"Ariel," Snape said with the sadness of someone bitterly familiar with regret. "You mustn't blame yourself."
Snape turned his head but hesitated. He thought about lying. To spare her. But then he thought against it, thinking it would be an insult to her intelligence to lie to her when he knew she likely guessed the truth, and he told her, "Where else but a cave?" A lapse of silence passed before he said, "I'm sorry darling."
But his crackly, dried out foot barely made it past the fourth step when the unmistakably annoying voice of Bellatrix LeStrange rang up from behind him, saying, "My Lord! My Lord! Where are you, My Lord?"
"I love it," she confessed, tracing the shape of his ear with her index finger like old times. "I love clingy."
The whisper network told him Scrimgeour had taken up in a family friend's unused summer cottage. "Apparently, he doesn't feel safe at home," Voldemort said with a boisterous laugh. Snape felt a burning hatred for him. How dare he use Ariel's body and voice to deceive and create havoc but all he could do was stand there, his wand burning in his pocket with bitter impotence, as Voldemort tapped his shoulder and stole him away. The two of them showed up on Scrimgeour's doorstep covered from head to toe in blood-soaked rags looking like the twin faces of pure misery. Voldemort even gave Ariel's clone a black eye and a cut on their shared collar bone to play up the story.
"I already asked her," Voldemort's irritated voice cut in. "And she's not going to kill you. So, you can stop slobbering on her already."
"It's my own fault. I keep staying up late to read." He half-lied. Half-lies were good for him. Nobody, except her, got anything close to the truth out of him.
But he held it for a time without speaking as long-forgotten memories flooded over him. He felt a laugh build in his chest and after a few moments of grotesque smiling, a crow-like cackle broke out of his chest.
Narcissa whipped her head at Ariel with big, wet brown eyes. She thought about bribing her with the Deluxe Circe Self-Stirrer 5000. If that wouldn't work, she would've given her all the gold in her Gringott's account. She would've given her any bit of jewelry, clothing, her loyalty, her life, anything the siren asked for. But looking into Ariel's blushing face, her eyes soft with tipsiness, she realized then that now was the best time to appeal to the woman's recklessness.
"I don't know. He seems pretty fond of that…" She snapped her fingers, trying to jog her memory. "Shrine boy."
Ariel's favorite quality about herself, besides her voice, would always be her hair. Not because it was long or lovely or it held a perfect bounce but because of the color. Those long fluttery vibrant blood-red locks that draped her back. That could be seen from miles away and drew predators and prey in better than any bait.
"What?" Snape said when he opened the door to find Draco's slumped against the brick hallway wall. "Oh, Lord. Draco you look…"
Tom barely remembered the other two children and when they approached the rock he sat on and discovered Tom was talking to a strange lady with blood-red hair and a fishtail swimming in a dim watery cave, he didn't chase after them as they ran away screaming.
“Keep reminding him of your usefulness,” Snape offered. Then he took a step back and suggested, half-seriously, “Play scared if you can. He loves being feared.”
"Wow, she has…good aim." Ariel remarked as she watched Nagini slither over and gulp the furry corpse down.
"Be quiet, you. Children should be seen not heard." Young Adult Tom sneered as he got from his imaginary feet to glide over his current self. "C'mon Voldemort. Chin up. Look at all you've done on your own. You're a half-blood. The bastard spawn of a silly witch and muggle scum. Yet you have purebloods worshipping your every move. You're so powerful your very name strikes fear into the hearts of millions. And in less than a year, you're going to be so powerful not even Death will be able to stop you. You've done more than most wizards will do in a thousand lifetimes. So why are you wasting time wallowing over whether or not some walking fish loves you?" Young Adult Tom punctuated his speech by shooting the child who was trying hard to rub away his tears a look of pure disgust.
Draco shrugged, though he knew exactly why he was there. He was there because he needed to disappear and Potter wasn't letting him. He got up and took his drink to the far end of the establishment where he took the first least messy table he could find.
Ariel froze before the dead woman's grave. Guilt filled her veins and coagulated her bloodstream the longer they stood there, in silence. Their heads bowed slightly as if lost in prayer. Ariel wondered if her ghost was there, in that graveyard, watching them. She looked over her shoulder but saw nothing. She turned her attention back to the tombstone, which she couldn't help but notice was better maintained than the other graves.
"Ooh! What is it?" He asked as he watched her climb from her chair and pull a badly wrapped package from underneath the couch.
“Thank you,” she rasped after she chugged the entire glass and set the empty cup on a nearby nightstand. She raised herself up and asked, “How long was I out for?”
He made the plan the moment he saw the cave. He was going to lure Dennis and Amanda into the cave and he was going to see what the insides of their skulls looked like. Convincing them to sneak away was easy. For some reason, the other kids always listened to him even if it was obvious, they were terrified of him. He couldn't explain it himself. He had such a small, childish voice, it grated against his own ears, but he knew what to say to get people to like him. To do what he wanted.
When she wasn't enjoying the intimacies of a new, fulfilling relationship, she did as she pleased. Which often meant potion-making, or exploring, or, as was the case for her on that fine crisp November morning, visiting her sisters.
"Right?" Ariel agreed. "But yeah, anyway, I walked in, grabbed Lucy over here, and then I was out like the wind." She one-shoulder shrugged the ending, like what she did was as commonplace as closing a door.
Greyback nodded, then bowing frequently, thanking the dark wizard profusely as he dug inside his robes for his wand.
"You two can go back," Harry insisted, his feet turned sideways, towards the bar. "I'll be there soon."
The two married that night on that nameless beach underneath a bright purple moon in a ceremony that took less than five minutes with Attina as the officiant and the rest of Ariel's sisters, and Narcissa, Snape's only guest and the only person he trusted to keep this a secret, as witnesses.
"Don't worry mate. The second you turn seventeen, we're burning that shithole house to the ground," avowed Ron.
No sooner had her feet crossed the invisible threshold into the cave did the cold winds cease completely as if never existed and the freezing climate was replaced by a warm tropical atmosphere. She paused, catching her breath, allowing the cold to thaw from her body while she stared into the impenetrable darkness that lead to the bowels of the cave.
"I'm the most powerful dark wizard that ever lived! You should be telling me I'm great every day! You should be spending all day telling me you're proud of me! You should be singing my praises! Literally! You—"
For a while neither of them said anything. They merely stood on opposite sides of the room avoiding eye contact. But then eventually Draco broke the silence and asked, in the tiniest most pathetic little voice, "Am I going to die?"
"Did you? Look at your life. Your only friends are murderers and thieves. Your husband's a Death Eater. You claim to be miss ethics but you don't seem to mind lying to your sisters about me. You have a voice so powerful you could probably rule the world for good but you waste it getting fucked by some greasy half-blood—"
“I know this is difficult for you,” Voldemort said after another stretch of silence. “I know I am not at all what you hoped I would be.”
It was enough to send him there even though he had scoured every inch of that ramshackle shack over the years.
Ariel cut the murderous wizard a sideways glance. How was this wizard before her, this hideous noseless creature who was practically begging her to love him, be the cruel, soulless Lord Voldemort? How could this be the same wizard she had spent so many years appalled by tales of his never-ending evil? "Well, I don't know…If we do make this a weekly thing, are you going to be on your best behavior?" Her voice turned serious when she added, "Or am I going to see things I wish I hadn't?"
“And I want you to know…” He whispered as he lifted his head to look her in the eyes. “You were the best mother a bastard like me could ever ask for.”
She came to in a cold room swathed in the navy blues of dusk, vaguely aware that someone was touching her head. She opened her eyes, expecting Voldemort, and was relieved to find her beloved Severus, sitting on the edge of the bed she laid in, stroking her cowlick. When he noticed her awake, they kissed and embraced, grateful to have another day in this horrible world together.
Even as he led them away from the comforts of the summer sun to the coolness of the cave, they believed his lies.
Then, the sound of the Dark Lord calling his name yanked him out of his guilt-ridden thoughts. He quickly splashed his face with water, dried away distress, and left, bracing himself for what he imagined was going to be a bloody shitshow.
For one awful second the Dark Lord stared at him, injecting himself into his mind, determining his lies. But then an instant later the Dark Lord's face softened and the hardness in his voice creased when he said, "I don't doubt that Severus. And as it stands, no, I wouldn't be upset if you two were to marry. I wouldn't go to the wedding because I think they're boring and the idea of marriage as a legally binding contract as idiotic but I'd send a gift and try not to torture you too much for being her husband."
Physically, he was alone in that dark cave off the coast of an icy beach but mentally he was in a dark cave with two of the most annoying ghosts to ever exist.
Ariel let out a sigh of incredulity. "This—you—" She pulled her gaze away from the undead and looked at him with genuine absorption. "Wow. You really have your own undead army." She looked back at the zombies and said in soft awe, "Holy shit..."
Hopeless, and convinced she was going to die, she wanted nothing more than to cry but found the spell used on her wouldn't let her. She was nothing more than a living statue, helpless silent, and doomed.
But then his mind reminded him of his work. Since his duel with Albus, he had become obsessed with getting everything ready for war. In his last six weeks, he had spent every last hour of his time in a sunless cave trying to figuring out a way to spare the inferi from decomposition. And here he finally found the book that held the curse that would solve his decaying army problem. "Oh, I wouldn't want to intrude…"
Lunch came and it was terrible (Ariel used way too many onions and he forgot how much he detested trout) but Draco scarfed every bit of it down underneath the Dark Lord's watchful eye.
Severus's heart broke immediately. For he didn't know. But of course, he lied. "No. You are not going to die. Not tonight."
She hadn't been in that old house for more than a few minutes, having Floo Powdered from the warmth of the Hogwarts bed to brush her hair and teeth before she would dart off to meet her all six of her sisters off the coast of some nameless beach when she was jolted out of mindless contentment by the sound of an angry voice hissing, "If I don't find that fucking book I'm going to slaughter every single fucking person in this deadbeat town."
"Oh, that Wiley Bastard got out fine without my help," Ariel assured. "But it did make me ask myself if only there was a way for me to lend my non-mermaid friend my magical voice so he could talk his way out of getting wrongfully executed. Or you know, prank each other. And that's when it hit me. So, to make a long story short, I spent the last…oh…century perfecting the formula? Finally figured out the ratio last year. And bam! You are looking at a published potions maker."
"Yeah, I bet you don't. So, where were you all day? Pretty weird that you're out of school all day the same day five Death Eaters are murdered."
"No," he lied as he grabbed for a gold coin that dazzled at him from its dirt shelf. His hand was halfway into his shirt's pocket when a voice scolded him gently, "Put it back."
He said it so matter-of-factly she wanted to cry but instead she gave him a small apologetic frown then let out a heavy sigh. What am I getting myself into? She thought as she looked down at the powder sitting the palm of her hand. She looked up, her red lips a tight line of worry, and told him, “Good-bye, professor.”
"Yes, but I still did just get you flowers because I love you and I thought that's what people do when they love their moms."
Tom loathed beach days, almost as much as he despised the adults who ran Wool's with an iron-will but were mawkish and caring out in public. He hated it all. The sun, the sand, his housemates who ran around like chickens with their heads cut off and shrieked and played and ate sandy treats like they were regular children. But Tom knew better by then. They would never get to be normal children who grew up into normal adults with normal lives. They were all doomed, himself included, to lives of poverty, hardships, and unnoticed deaths. He saw their lives for what they were. They were the bastard offspring of cadavers who will grow up to be nothing more than pathetic adults with nothing to look forward to than a pauper's grave. If they ever grew up to be adults at all. And that knowledge scorched his soul and filled his little body with more rage than he knew what to do with.
Reflexively, everyone in the room attempted to appease the Dark Lord by dissuading him of his blame.
"Oh...n...no. No, thank you." Ariel said. When Bellatrix wouldn't move away, she added, "I'm going to need you to take a couple of steps back and also never do...any of that again."
You wouldn't have guessed this couple didn't believe in public displays of affection the way they rushed to another with arms opened wide. Ariel awed loudly as the spouses shamelessly showered the other's face with a thousand kisses. Even Bellatrix, who never cared for Lucius, couldn't help by be endeared by the utter happiness in her little sister's face as she cried tears of joy and clutched her husband close, whispering, "I never thought I'd see you again."
He stalled as if trying to decipher whether or not she was telling the truth. Then, his eyes scrunched tight and his lips parted wide as he bent over into uncontrollable laughter. His laughter was contagious to everyone but Ariel who cut a worried side glance at Tom who cackled away, as if it were truly the funniest thing he had ever heard. Eventually, he stopped laughing hard enough to wrap his arms around her neck and profess with total endearment, "I love you so much, mom."
"I agree," Bellatrix said. "There's no way you can break someone out of Azkaban that easily without being detected."
She brandished a tiny translucent vial. "I'm sure you can guess what this is." She twisted the top and use a dropper to deliver precisely three drops of the clear, odorless liquid onto her tongue. She caught his eye and gave him a waiting smile.
"You didn't." She stammered out as she used her sleeve to dry her face. "I just—I didn't—I didn't realize how much an impact I've made on you."
Ariel was the only one who didn't freeze under his impenetrable gaze. Bellatrix didn't dare breathe, let alone move. Narcissa and Lucius clung to another, refusing to let go, but didn't dare stand as the Dark Lord's eyes scanned over them with an unreadable expression.
"Desire her?" He echoed, repulsed. "Ugh! You think that because I worship the woman that I want… ugh!?"
Snape looked at her tail then looked her in the eye and said slowly, "I'm afraid to say I don't think potions can fix this problem for you. Frankly, even with your wealth, it would be very time-consuming to create one potion let alone create enough potions to sustain you for the rest of your life."
Draco thanked him, then Ariel then ran into the kitchen, desperate to be done with these menial tasks so he could go home and spend the rest of this miserable year as far away from the Dark Lord as he could.
He winked at her once then left the room, leaving Narcissa to resume her solitary drinking her mind spinning with the formation of a new plan to save her son's life.
"She's not joking," Voldemort reiterated with glee. "Ask Bellatrix." He turned to Ariel and asked brightly, "Did you want to demonstrate?"
"So, what should I do?" She rasped. "I mean…I still love the guy. Which scares the living shit out of me, because I know the longer I stay on the land, eventually he's going to ask me to do something that I won't be able to do."
"I didn't mean to embarrass you," Voldemort started looking extremely uncomfortable by the wild display of emotions.
"You could take everything from me and I wouldn't care in the slightest." He replied with a breathless quality that made her heart melt.
The air in the spacious room thinned. Nobody dared make a sign of mourning for the dead. When you're a Death Eater, death wasn't seen as a tragedy. It was seen as a mark of weakness not only for the individual and group but on the Dark Lord too. And the Dark Lord loathed failure.
"Start from the beginning." Voldemort interrupted encouragingly. "Whose idea was it to start day drinking?"
They did this position for several minutes without talking, overcome with intense desire neither one of them had felt in years. Then Ariel pushed him over, flipping him onto his back and climbed on top.
"Well yeah... not like I need them." He affirmed, trying to sound like his usual arrogant self. "I can still take over the world on my own."
With his ego bruised, the wizard stormed towards Ariel chasing her down until he managed to yank her by the wrist and force her to face him. He had his wand out, his mouth opened ready to deliver cruel retaliation, but Ariel stopped him dead.
"Blessing?" He said with a cold laugh. "You don't need my blessing," he said with an irritable hiss. All docility disappeared in an instant from his face. He was like a garter snake that turned into a rattlesnake ready to strike "This isn't the Muggle world Severus. Should she marry you that's her prerogative. And should she marry you I will support her decision entirely and be giddy as a fucking puppy for her because I think Ariel deserves to be happy. But should she refuse your proposal and or dump your ass because you know, she's a masterpiece and you're a pale greasy old shoe smelling atrocity, or worse, because you mistreated her in some way, my prerogative will be to saw off your head and skullfuck—"
"It's very nice to meet you, Tom Riddle." She said. "Were the two kids who ran off your brother and sister?"
“Yeah.” It felt like a lie. It tasted like a lie when it left her tongue. But for some reason, even as she stood on feet coated in giant blood, staring into the face of a man she knew would kill her with a smile on his hideous, noseless, lipless face should she fail to meet his expectations of her, she wanted to be there. Or rather, she knew she had to be there. “I don’t think we’ve ever seen each other for two days in a row. Thought we could change that.”
The young man disappeared in a red flash and the curse shot into the mouth of the cave-like a ballistic, colliding into the cave with a thunderous BOOM. Rock fragments rained down onto the remaining Toms but Voldemort cast a shielding spell above his head and the fragments dissolved into dust. Once the dust settled, Voldemort told the invisible child, "Don't listen to him. He doesn't know jack shit."
Ariel's body eased as a relieved breath escaped her lips. "Wow…I don't know what to say." She paused for a few heartbeats then added, "You know, it's funny. I often wondered what happened to that little boy in the cave…"
"Harry," Ron began, sobered. "Hermione's right. He's not worth it. Let's just go back to the dorms."
He didn't even realize his own hunger until she mentioned it. The mere suggestion caused his stomach to churn loudly.
Ariel arrived into Diagon Alley in a swoosh of smoke only to find the shopping promenade was nearly empty. Shops stood in unlit clusters of failure and hard times. There were fewer shoppers. Anybody who walked by her kept their heads down and their feet hurried.
"Because I want to be able to trust you, Tom. But I know trust goes both ways." She outstretched her hand holding the vial.
Voldemort touched his hand to his clavicle, charmed. He had a look on his face like she had given him the highest compliment he had ever received in his life. "That means a lot coming from you."
He smiled, bringing the cup to his lipless mouth. "Good." He sounded like he meant it. "You know, I never would have pictured you two together." With a snicker, he added, "He
"It doesn't look like an old house at all," Ariel replied, turning her head towards the grand mansion which stood so sharp, tall and proud against the cloudy sky it looked like it was turning its nose at the heavens itself. Then she turned her head to Narcissa and said, "I would love a tour sometime."
"Oh, Severus." She cried before their mouths reconnected and they rolled on the ground together until the desire was too strong for her and she broke apart, her voice husky voice begged, "Where the hell's this office?"
She looked to the ground and said, "shit." She turned to her right and began rummaging through a red cloth bag which was teeming with magazines. "I was hoping you were the man I was looking for."
"I should start by sending fewer people on missions. Whenever there are too many people there's too many chances to fuck up."
He smiled and blinked. "Not at all. Which is saying something for me because I usually run out of energy for all human interaction once I hit the ten-minute mark."
After which Ariel would repeat everything said during their conversations to Severus and he would relay any messages sent by Dumbledore.
"For fucks' sake," Draco said with an angry sigh. "Is it so much to ask for a clean glass?" He glanced at Harry's glass and made a grossed-out noise as Harry took another small sip. "How can you drink from that? It looks like it was washed with sand."
Her nose crinkled and another smile unfurled out for him. Their lips were so close. His groin ached at the thought of her kisses. Her salty kisses trailing his body. Their bodies colliding. Her luscious voice saying his name over and over while he—
"Like elf shit? I'm aware." Draco said, lifting his head to reveal a haggard, shallow face and a pair of empurpled, puffy eyes. He rubbed his temples and asked, "Who were you talking to?"
"Mama felt weird." He explained with a snake-like grin. "Or do you prefer, mom? Ooh or madre? Wait—what am I saying, we're not Italian."
In her agonizing wait, she heard the woman's high-pitch laugh and the sound of footfalls coming towards her but whereas she expected the woman with the high-heeled boots instead found a chalk-white snake-faced creature in ash-black robes standing over her.
His free hand hovered over against his thigh, stiff with paranoia. But then he glanced down and saw his younger self clinging to her dress, pressing himself into her leg like she would fly away at any second if he didn't anchor her down. He took the vial and downed the rest of the contents in a single gulp. When he opened his eyes, the first thing he noticed was the shocked look in her face.
His wand exploded with blue light but Dumbledore blocked it and the curse ricocheted into the ceiling, leaving behind a massive hole. Voldemort struck again, whipping his arm across his chest furiously as he launched another curse which Dumbledore, effortlessly, repelled, sending the beam of light into a wall where it shook the house to its core.
"There's no way I can go to class today. I haven't slept in weeks. I'm so run down I'm convinced if I stay awake another hour, I'm going to literally drop dead. I need a sleeping draught." Snape would have told him no had the boy not added, with the most desperate little voice, "Please."
Voldemort rolled his eyes then pushed himself from the couch, announcing, "I'm going to get the boy before he assumes the worst."
All his attempts to kill Dumbledore without having to look the old wizard in the face were one spectacular failure after another. Worse, everyone knew it was him. He felt everyone's eyes. They knew. Potter knew. So did his friends. His teachers. Dumbledore. The Dark Lord. They all watched him try and fail and it was absurd how well everyone knew yet no one came for him. No teacher, no judge or executioner. The only one who talked to him about it was Uncle Sev but he merely screamed at him for not letting him to the task himself.
He turned his attention back to the garbage and a piece of paper being used for a bookmark caught his eye. He knelt down and pinched his long, dried out fingers around the page, pulling it out from its place. Just as he suspected, it was nothing but a moving sketch of a mermaid diving into water rendered on torn parchment paper.
"You think," Voldemort said in-between a wide-mouth laugh. "She's my sex worker?" Voldemort continued laughing darkly as Fenrir's face slacked with confusion. "That's hilarious! Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha!"
"Yes—yes, my lord." Greyback stuttered in a croaky voice of someone who just had their throat stomped on. "I swear—I swear."
The woman held out a waiting hand which irked him greatly. He wanted to be defiant. To tell her to fuck off and run off with his newly acquired riches but he felt his free will leave his arm as it rose up, against his wishes, to give back what he stole. When the coin fell from his fingers, he felt the control return to his arm and it was at that moment he recognized the power in this creature before him.
"You're a teacher here?" She asked, lifting herself then turning her body to face him so that only the tip of her tail remained in the lake.
"I did." She paused then asked, "Is it true... is it true you made a spell that can turn people inside out?"
"Yes, and as much as I would love to be the one to kill Harry Potter, he has turned out to be an...impossbily hard child to kill. So, if I can't kill him, I'd be happy to just... watch him be forced to rip his own dick off and...slowly bleed to death on the cold hard ground, begging to be euthanized."
Ariel silenced him by quietly wrapping her arms around his waist and resting her head against his chest and whispering, "I'm so proud of you."
She took to the first open clothing shop she could find. She half-ran into the shop not because she was fearful but because the morning September sun hung dull and cold and she needed something with sleeves immediately. She approached the counter, dug out the gold sickles she collected over the years, and dumped two handfuls of them onto a dusty counter. She looked up into the business witch who stood behind the counter and told her, with a misplaced smile, "Good morning." The owner of the shop did not return her greeting but rather continued to eye Ariel warily with a face that said what the hell do you want? Ariel flashed her a warm smile and told the shop keeper in her melodic voice, "I need a new dress. I'm going on a date tomorrow."
Ariel didn’t hesitate. She looked him in the eye and said, “We both know that I can’t help you kill a child.”
Ariel looked down at her hands, the steam from her cup wafting against her forehead as she searched through the words she wanted to say next.
Determined, Ariel made her way to the formidable entrance. A sixteen-hundred-meter iron door covered in spikes, bearing a sign that said WELCOME TO AZKABAN THE UNHAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH. Unsure of what to do, she cleared her throat then cried out in her loudest voice, "I'm here to visit Lucius Malfoy!"
But Voldemort raised his non-wand-wielding hand to the group and everyone shut up immediately and he continued, "No, it's true. This ambush that left us five men short was, in fact, my fault. After all, neither Rudolfo, Yemo, nor the Beckles triplets would have known better had I been a little more…open about my childhood."
"I am," Ariel replied softly her head tilted down coyly at Snape enhancing her sparkling eyes which gleamed under his gaze. "Nice to see you again, professor. I can't thank you enough for…" Her right hand receded from her lap and began to trail the highway of her thigh. "Your work yesterday."
Ariel pointed at her crown which shot out little balls of confetti and light while steel drums rang out a cheerful tune. "See?"
"Ah!" He cried, though the second it left his mouth he regretted it. It was merely Ariel, standing at the bottom of the steps.
It was twenty minutes after midnight and already a shit day for Snape. Then again, it was just another shit day in a shit year amongst a shitty lifetime.
Neither of them waited to hear the rest of the announcement before they pulled each other into a passionate kiss cementing their decision to spend the rest of this Hellish lifetime together, whatever that might entail.
Voldemort gave him an odd smile when Snape didn't elaborate any further than asked after another short beat, "Any announcements you'd like to make?"
After Voldemort dropped Draco off to Malfoy Manor (literally too; poor Draco fell ten feet from thin air just to land in a pile of mud and peacock shit), he did what he normally did when he was upset: slaughtering muggles.
“No,” he replied simply. “It went…well, it went pretty good actually.” He waved at the carnage and said, with a dismissive laugh, “This is just how meetings usually go for me.”
"I'm Ariel no last name because mermaids don't have last names." She said, her eyebrow quirked with suspicion even as she slid her hand into his and gave it a cursory shake. "I thought you said you taught defense against the whatever arts."
She watched his face, studying him as he studied the sketch, her heart pounding so loudly she was convinced the snake-faced creature could hear it and that's why they took so long to address her.
Anger radiated within him daily, hourly, constantly, and with no one else to turn his anger on, he unleashed it onto his fellow orphans. Because if he was going to be miserable then so would they.
It was a fair question. Nothing about the place, from its sticky hay-covered floors to its rampant zoo-like smells to its unwashed bathrooms to its cobwebbed ceilings and decidedly strange decor, screamed 'come for the cleanliness and ambiance'. It was one of those bars that locals loved because it was gross, it's old, it's without pretense, and you could disappear in the corners with your troubles and a pint of beer without having to pretend to be anything you're not.
Dumbledore took a swig of the liquor bottle and rasped loudly. He despised the stuff. The smell, the taste, it was all vile, but he was tired of the pain that coursed from his fingers to his core and sometimes traveled down his nerves, making his hands gnarly shaky and weak. And worse, his body was constantly cold and clammy. Drinking warmed his cheeks and gave him the fire he needed to remember what he was staying alive for: to take Tom cockface Riddle down once and for all.
Voldemort laughed. "You're kidding, right? The woman's a literal god. Or she might as well be one. Her grandparents were gods, her father was a demigod. The woman can make a person rip their own genitals off just by telling them to. I've wanted to do that since I was 8. Hell, that power alone is half the reason I want to achieve immortality so badly so I could spend the next however many years learning how to do that with just my mind. I want to be just like that woman. Also," He paused to look around the room to make sure they were alone. Then with his piercing blue eyes boring into Snape's soul, he added, "I'm only going to tell you this because you two are going to be intimate soon and it'll probably come up anyway but," His face softened slightly. "Some of my few good childhood memories were with Ariel." Snape didn't dare speak while Voldemort's eyes went dreamy and distant. "I remember…when I first got the news that I was a wizard. I snuck out to tell her. I suspected she knew I was magic but she pretended to be surprised when I told her. Then she spent the whole night asking me about what I wanted to be, the classes I would take. She even found an old tie from her collection and showed me how to do a Windsor knot."
"My Lord." Narcissa blurted out breathlessly. Then she remembered her place and took a nervous bow before picking herself up and asking, with some calm, "What do I owe the pleasure?"
"I did," Ariel said, pensively as the boy's phantom appeared in the kitchen and climbed onto an untaken chair to join them. Ghostly scenes of their time in the cave together passed by her eyelids. Him, nine and full of baby fat. He, a few years older, showing off his school uniform. Him, a preteen, handing her a drawing, explaining to her, his prepubescent voice soaked with haughty pride, the difficulty of pulling off an animation spell on a drawing for his age. She still remembered him telling her when she tried to give the sketch back to him, 'No, I made it for you'. She remembered being so touched by his thoughtfulness she had to wait until he left for Wool's to cry. But those sweet memories crumbled to dust as her thoughts turned back to the headlines from the last decades of his murders, his bloodshed, his cruelty. "Meanwhile…I've heard about He-Must-Not-Be-Named every day for the last forty years and I had no idea the two were the same person."
“Wait, we’re still going on that date, right?” Ariel asked, as she was pulling on her dress. It was daybreak after they eventually went back to Snape’s office to have earth-shattering sex, slept and reluctantly rose to part ways.
Voldemort's face was impassive, though his ice blue eyes poured over her which caused a cold sweat to run down her back as she felt the furious grip of death descend over her.
Dumbledore batted the lightning bolt away, back towards him. Voldemort had to leap out of the way to avoid being hit and the white lightning shot out of the house, into the backyard, where it made contact with the trunk of the tree that Ariel slept beneath, leaving behind a vicious, gaping, smoldering tear.
The woman didn't seem to care about them either for her focus was squarely set on him. He could tell from the expression on her face that his unwillingness to be afraid of her interested him.
Yet another woman disappointed in me for being something I'm not, he thought sadly as he watched her pull out a waterlogged copy of 'POTIONS HEADS MONTHLY' and begin flipping through the pages.
"But what about the Great Viper of the Seas? You used to be the living nightmare for sailors and the British armada! Now, you're so...ugh, kind, and, ugh, compassionate. It's sickening."
"I forgot about this article." He said, his voice barely louder than a whisper as emotion bubbled up from within. He lifted his head and found her eyes on him. The mere flicker of her eyelashes sent his butterflies into his stomach and blood to his dick and he had to push away thoughts of her moaning his name as he cleared his throat and said, in his normal voice, "I'm glad my words positively resonated with you."
That was their last conversation before the disaster fight at Slughorn's party and summitted with Draco, once again, storming out of his office. From there, they didn't say anything beyond perfunctory small talk from then to the end of the fall term.
"Really?" He asked, somewhat surprised. "Hm, I didn't expect him to tell you so soon. He usually dragggggs these things out for as long as he could." He glanced at Troubled Ariel and said, "We don't have to talk about this now."
Ariel goose-honked when she laughed, holding her hand to her face with slight embarrassment as she kept on laughing and she looked so beautiful in that moment. He almost proposed to her then and there. When she looked back at him, she gave him a closed-lip smile of utter adoration. She then caressed the side of his face and breathed, "You're too sweet." Snape held her hand against his cheek and they laid there like that for a few heartbeats in content silence.
At the sound of "nephew", Voldemort made a noise he wasn't proud of: something of a deranged little squawk of utter jubilation. Then with breathless energy, he said, "I would love to." He quickly stuffed the black book into the pocket of his robes then dug into his other pocket and drew out a vial which he promptly uncorked and ingested the contents in a single gulp.
"Last time I got it appraised they told me it is priceless but you could easily sell it to the Museum of Magical History and get two hundred million for it."
"I am." She lifted her head to unleash a dozen kisses onto his cheek and side of his face, squeezing him tight, telling him, over and over, "I'm so proud of you!"
"God, you're worse than a cat in heat," Voldemort remarked, half-annoyed and half-amused by the obvious lechery in her face.
He smiled, bringing the cup to his lipless mouth. “Good.” He sounded like he meant it. “You know, I never would have pictured you two together.” With a snicker, he added, “He hates children.”
"Can't blame a witch for trying," muttered Bellatrix as she backed away. From the allotted distance she asked, "What can I do for you, Lady Ariel?"
Nagini tried cramming herself inside the chewed-out opening but found her head was too big. When that plan failed, she merely followed the sounds of the mouse's claws scratching up the wall.
"Grab me a boning knife," he ordered as he began rolling up his sleeves. He must have remembered about Ariel because he added, "Please."
The searing pain was replaced with a burning pain which was replaced by a dull pain and eventually was replaced by the relieving absence of pain. She picked up her woozy, sweat-covered head to find Snape staring at her lower half, looking mesmerized. She lifted herself onto her elbows and when she looked down to see the dreadful tail was gone, replaced by two bare legs, she sobbed from joy.
