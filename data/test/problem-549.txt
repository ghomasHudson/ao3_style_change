And if the Savior of the Wizarding World looked miserable, then what hope was there for the sorry bastards like him?
As if sensing his line of thought, her cheeks pinched in a frown.  “Not just wandlessly – I need your guarantee that you won’t enter another being’s mind without
After several minutes, he glanced down at the page he had typed.  He seriously considered burning it.  But then, after rereading several times, he decided that it was actually the perfect thing to unsettle Potter.  He remembered the man’s blush from the night of the Sorting Feast and desperately wished to summon such a beautiful expression to his face once more.
Regardless, he worked himself to the point of exhaustion every day between potions and flying class – yet still, in the midst of all that, he found time to torture himself about Potter.  What was the man
Draco’s eyes widened, amazed that someone like Harry could face his embarrassment like that, head-on.  Then, he laughed, because
With his bare hand, he drew his wand from his pocket and cast the cleaning and lubricating charms in a hurry.  Then, his wand clattered to the floor, forgotten, as Draco flipped Harry back around to face the lockers.
Draco finally freed his hands to set his book aside without crumpling it.  “Hardly.  Now get off so I can read!”
“I’m perfectly fine on my own!” he lied.  “Unlike ‘Savior of the Universe’ over here, who needs to be the center of attention at every waking moment!”  He felt the conversation spinning away from him, but he couldn’t quite get a grasp on himself enough to stop.
“Awful,” Harry replied.  Then, his eyes widened in surprise.  “Everything has changed, and I feel terribly off.”  He said it with such uncharacteristic indifference that Draco could tell it was the potion forcing him to lie.  Well, at least
When her feet hit the pitch, Draco amplified his voice and called out “First!”  Several of the students, hearing this, grew sluggish in their efforts, figuring the winning position was already taken.  The teams in second and third, however, seemed to double down on their efforts to complete the circuit before the other.
His muscles were taut with the effort of not coming.  The wet heat, the attentive grip – it was all he could do to hold himself together.  Draco let his eyes fall shut for a moment to center himself, flicking them open every few seconds to remember he wasn’t dreaming.
It was these thoughts that consumed him until hours later, when Harry finally stirred.  The man’s hair was messy – messier than usual – and he stretched like a cat before smiling up at him.
They arrived at the dining room – stilted and formal in the wake of him taking most of his final meals here in the kitchens or in his room – and sat stiffly at opposite ends, with his mother in between.
“I’m sure they can manage without me for a while.  Besides, it might even the playing field a bit,” he said over his shoulder, turning to stride down the path towards the Great Hall.
Finally, Harry got around to the point at hand – asking Sam about his crush.  The boy folded and confessed, describing his more-than-friendly feelings for a classmate he’d been hanging out with.  When asked if he’d told him yet, though, Sam’s reply was immediate:
“What, no more arguments, Potter?”  His voice was low and hoarse, but he smirked like it wasn’t a vulnerability.
Harry, who’d stopped his pacing in time with his monologue, threw himself back onto the couch.  “I…suppose.  Yeah.  Yeah, I feel guilty.”
Draco glanced over at Potter, catching his grimace as Slughorn clapped him jovially on the shoulder.  In his opinion, if Potter felt uncomfortable, then he deserved every bloody second of it.  When he’d sat with Longbottom and his wife this morning, that had been understandable – they were friends after all – but sitting between Slughorn and
Standing over the cauldron as it bubbled green, then blue – inhaling the earthy scent of fluxweed as he stirred, then paused, then stirred...  At times, it was easy to forget that he was allowed to use his wand again; he’d gotten so used to doing everything by hand.  There was something so distinct about crushing lacewing flies under his knife blade that invigorated him in a way that a severing spell wouldn’t.
As if reading the thoughts from across his face, Malfoy grinned a wicked, private smile, then drew him into a step backwards, then forwards, then a tight, unanticipated spin.
Draco reached wordlessly for Harry’s jeans, popping the button and sliding down the fly – a motion that made Harry let out a small hiss as his cock was freed at last.
The potion hissed as the leaf hit its surface and sunk, disintegrating, into its depth.  All of a sudden, the maelstrom ceased.  “Huh,” he said, pushing his goggles up onto his forehead.  “Now, can you explain to me what just happened?”
“Do you… do you feel more like a bloke, then?”  He winced at how clunky the question sounded in his mouth.
But it was also because Harry was preoccupied – once again speaking with the younger boy, Sam.  “What were you saying?”
Beyond the horizon of Harry’s back, Draco could see the man’s release spattering upon the parchment and quills and the sheer hedonism of the sight sent him following his own climax.  He sank his teeth into Harry’s back to muffle a shout.
“Potter.  Didn’t know you were so eager to celebrate Slytherin’s victory with us,” he quipped, letting the words tumble from his mouth like firewhisky.
, did he look flustered now.  His breaths were coming in nervous huffs, and his smooth brown skin was flushed nearly scarlet.
And Harry, knowing his line, and—this time—that there was no room for miscommunication, tugged Malfoy back in by his jumper, so that he was speaking the words against his lips.  “If I’m a snake, then let’s rattle.”
Her sword glinted in the green glow of the common room, and Draco snapped into teacher-mode – a mode he was only recently discovering he
“They forced my hand a bit, what with my father and all,” Draco raced to explain.  “I’d really rather not.”  With Harry, it was usually better to be explicit with his feelings.
“You look bloody ridiculous,” Draco couldn’t help but shouting down to him.  Potter left himself too open to insults to resist.  “I knew you were a twit, but I never realized you were thick-headed enough to bulldoze a forest with your face.”
Granger paused her furious scribbling in her notebook to peek over the edge of the cauldron.  A little crease knit itself between her brows, and Draco was startled to realize that after today’s long session, it was starting to look familiar.  He’d never imagined he would know anything but Granger’s disdain.
His head was spinning with new information, and he had checked out several books to give to Marla.  For now, though, he disillusioned them as potion books; he didn’t want to explain the situation to anyone until Marla was ready, and he was sure she’d appreciate the discretion.
“Only if you come back and demonstrate more for my Quidditch class,” Draco replied, then immediately bit his tongue.  It wouldn’t do to sound
“Well, you didn’t want me to, did you?”  She huffed an amused sigh.  “Really, Harry.  We ended things mutually, so it wasn’t like I was
And then, suddenly, it was too much.  The feeling of Harry squeezing around him, the warm slide of his skin in Draco’s hands… He came with a groan that he covered by biting down harshly on Harry’s neck.
When they’d both stopped pumping and twitching, Draco pulled out, leaving fluids trailing down Harry’s thigh.  He stumbled over to his chair, buttoning his trousers messily as he went – for once, not arsed with getting it right.  “Well,” he said, when he’d caught his breath enough to ask, “was it everything you fantasized?”
Twitching.  The body was twitching.  It was undoubtedly dead, but it twitched with every sickening shuffle as the snake repositioned its body to swallow.
His stomach twisted as she smiled back, even more blindingly.  “No, no – I have no intention of interrupting
“And Professor Potter – of all people – was the one to re-spark interest!”  Draco’s eyebrow might’ve twitched.  “I suppose it stands to reason, since his duel is undoubtedly the most famous of our era – but still,” Flitwick paused, face struggling between pride and envy, “it’s a shame that it took something like
Disdain danced in Jameson’s eyes – alongside obvious malice – but there was fear in there now, as well.  He got up and left without a word.
“Potter, wait!”  He reached out a hand to grasp his robe, but the man had already moved out of range.
than ever before.  He’d shown up at breakfast with a smarmy, supercilious disposition, and acted like – after everything –
The teasing continued throughout the dessert course, and by the time they left, Draco couldn’t remember what he had been so nervous about to begin with.  He and Granger made a research date that their partners accepted with resigned sighs on both ends, and his shoulders felt slightly lighter as they Apparated their respective ways.
As it stood, the only sections of the book he had found enlightening were the parts involving Cedric Diggory and then Harry’s childhood, which he knew admittedly little about.  The part about Diggory was curious, not because he knew one way or another whether Potter
Harry’s petulance softened, and he leaned in for another quick kiss before drawing away with a sigh.  “Fine.  Go on!  Talk to your parents.”  He met Draco’s eyes.  “But I better see you at dinner.”
of?  That you’re toiling away in some Knockturn potions shop, taken advantage of by your supervisor?”
Mother had left the house the way it was the day the Death Eaters vacated it.  Sure, she had asked the elves to clean and restore, but otherwise, everything was kept the same.  The rooms where the most terrible of tragedies had occurred – well, she simply shut their doors.  As if, someday, when the memories had blurred a bit around the edges, she could simply throw them open again and see not a woman getting devoured on their formal dining room table, but instead, the easier times of winter suppers before the war.
kind of represent a chronological tour through the Jewish holidays?  My late mother was Jewish, so my selection is kind of an homage to her.
VOLDEMORT: You actually completed one of your bakes on time, it looks like.  Though [his eyes fall on HARRY] you had a bit of help, I see.
don’t think that – why don’t you test it on me?  It’s always good to see how different people react to a potion.”
.  Unless Potter touched him first, he couldn’t risk exposing his desires like that – or inflicting them upon a man who would likely never want him, no matter how flustered or aroused he may temporarily appear.
.  It was a phase Draco related to on a deeper level and wished he could return to without conscientious compunction.
“Oh?  And what all will be featured in your ‘house of horrors?’” She seemed genuinely interested for once.  “I remember back in my day, we had parties – nothing as formal as a Ball – but there were always pranks involving Peeves and, sometimes, scary-story telling in the common rooms...”
He leveled a furious gaze at the man who had caused him so many problems, and was surprised to see vivid green eyes staring back at him.  Potter looked...
After it was over, Harry collapsed back on his pillow like his very spirit had left him, which was the most flattering reaction Draco had gotten from sex yet.  He looked utterly wiped and blissed out in the best of ways, and it was truly a shame that Draco was still rock hard with wanting him.
.  You have to check your wand at the door – and if you fuck yourself up out there, then you’d best be able to drag yourself back up the stairs to get it before you pass out.”
, to say to distract from the stupid grin curling across his face.  “Well…do you fancy checking out the Ball?  I haven’t had the chance to see it yet.”
you, Draco,” he’d said.  “Can’t I do that?”  And Draco had dropped it, because he didn’t want to get into an argument that revealed the intricacies of his self-loathing and inability to accept favors from anyone.  Instead, he’d muttered something trite about “bloody Gryffindors” and insisted on paying for Honeydukes.
It was Potter.  Despite how incomprehensible the implications, Potter was staring into a mirrored version of himself.
– and almost purpled with blood in his arousal.  Precum leaked freely down the side, and it took everything in Draco not to fall to his knees and lap it off.
Being as busy as it was, the last week of the semester absolutely flew by, and then there was only the Quidditch match before everyone went home for the holidays.  Draco had made some headway on his potion this morning, and he was almost convinced that he’d gotten it right this time – all he had to do was test it sometime after the game.
– that’s for sure.”  When Harry turned back to face him, Ron was watching him with a considering gaze.  “I’m not going to stop you, Harry.  I can’t say that I
Harry surveyed the room before gesturing to the Bat’s Blood Soup fountain that burbled nearby.  “Let’s get some Mice Pops to dip!”
Ignoring the swear, she continued to heal him, wand working steadily over his battered form.  It took many minutes to address all of the injuries, and by the time she was done, Draco had gone from debilitating
using him to get out of these responsibilities – but like any good Slytherin, he fell victim to flattery.  “I’m honored you think so, Sir.”
It was clearly an insult about his upbringing, which Draco couldn’t be arsed about at the moment.  “Now, now, Professor Potter,” he quipped, relishing the way Harry once again twitched at the title, “you’ve
The man flopped into the proffered chair gratefully, looking like he’d just fought in a war.  Draco offered him tea, and he politely refused – though he looked a little wistful in doing so.  “It has come to my attention,” he began, “that Minerva is trying to kill me.”
His remorse about Dumbledore was the reason he was sitting in The Three Broomsticks instead of the more inconspicuous Hog’s Head Inn.  Though he would have less of a chance of being noticed there, he would likely be noticed by Aberforth - the one person with even more reason to hate Draco than most anyone else.
The question took him by surprise, though Potter’s poorly-veiled interest inspired him to respond as mysteriously as possible.  “Wouldn’t you like to know?”
He could feel all the eyes in the courtroom on him.  Analyzing this new information and comparing it to what they saw in front of them.  Given how he looked, they would surely distrust the praise.  Some shifted their disappointed glances to Potter, and that made Draco’s stomach clench with dread.
Jenkins was livid now, clutching his camera like a lifeline.  “They’re afraid to ask!  I ask the questions and get the answers that no one else will!”  He was on a roll now, face glowing with self-righteousness.  “That’s my job as a
going on!”  He tried one last-ditch effort of hopping over the end table to skirt past her towards the door, but she cut him off by grabbing a fistful of shirt and shooting him a dirty glare.  Shit.
She pleaded that things could go back to normal.  He told her “normal” didn’t exist for people like them.  Not now, not anymore.
The man seemed to come to Draco’s line of thought a couple beats later, when he stiffened slightly and cast his gaze around the room.  “No chance they’ve all just forgotten the articles, is there?” he muttered after he’d surveyed their surroundings adequately.
, everyone will have left, and we can go in and-” his gaze dropped to Harry’s lips, imagining the rest of that sentence instead of speaking it.
Harry leaned into their shared grip to take the first step, but Malfoy squared his feet and pressed back like he was fighting off all the horrors of the universe.  “Potter—"
He picked up the Judith Butler tome, filled with his notes breaking down the complicated prose (notes he fully intended to leave in the book when he returned it.)  “Because what’s the worst that could happen?” he continued.  “We’ll both end up more knowledgeable on this topic, and then – even if it’s not you – chances are we’ll both meet someone, someday, who these truths apply to.  And when that happens, I want to be able to support them in any way I can.  Don’t you?”
“Fuck,” he mumbled, body limp against Harry’s, positive that he had made himself look an utter fool.
Her hand dropped from the door, and for a moment, he was terrified she’d come after him.  What happened was worse.  She merely toppled to the ground, the weight of her body pushing open the doors as she fell.  The resounding
“Er,” panic began to set in as Draco realized the enormity of the commitment he’d just agreed to, “what are the responsibilities, then?”
Her resulting expression hurt him; but, sometimes, pain was just the foreshadowing of transformation.
Despite his continued misgivings, Draco’s life fell into a tidy routine at The White Wyvern.  In the mornings, he’d wake and be served breakfast downstairs by Gloria – the older woman who’d eyed him worriedly from the bar the first night he’d arrived.  She looked at him no differently now, their pleasant (if not overly long) exchanges colored by her obvious discontent and not-insignificant pity.
With trepidation, Draco pulled the scroll from his leg.  Under the intent, watchful gaze (and pick-like beak), he didn’t dare toss it to his usual pile.  He broke the seal with a wince, noting how neither Mother nor him had been so official in all the time he was gone.  The Malfoy crest glared from the wax, red and shiny like hardened blood.
Dejectedly, Draco began pawing through his wardrobe for an appropriate outfit to wear.  It was early yet, and he didn’t need any particular costume for the “house of horrors” event, so he had time to choose whatever he liked.  Though, his selection was limited rather severely to the few pairs of formal robes and suits that he’d taken with him from the Manor last year.  In his childhood, he would’ve had his choice of any number of eye-catching outfits, but now he was grateful he’d managed to retain even these.  Clothes, as it turned out, were bloody
is this, Potter?”  He waved the office hours form through the air like it had offended him terribly.  After all, it had.
He hadn’t thought it would matter – so much of their limited interactions had already drawn from the past.  What was one more stray comment?
Draco raised an eyebrow at that, amused despite himself, but his eyes dared Harry to respond in an appropriate way.  Which –
Draco’s hands were clasped tightly in his lap.  “I appreciate your hiring me,” he said mechanically, trying to crush down the panic in his chest and think fast.  “More than you can know.  I’ll do better – I swear it!  I should’ve warned my students better about the pranks.  Or went with them, so I could supervise-”
Which was exactly what his father was relying on.  The more diminutive Draco felt, the better chance Lucius had of crushing him.  “Denial – another small rebellion among larger travesties.  I’m warning you, Draco: if you continue to defy me like this, there will be consequences.  You can go on deluding yourself, but you can never delude
“Hi,” he repeated.  “Now, what are we feeling today?  Are we ready to move on to simple rolls, or do we want to stick to the vertical slaloms I set up last class?”
He saw Potter’s eyes glow, and then he was swooping down right in front of him, forcing Draco to halt his stampede if he didn’t want to get clipped.  He staggered a bit to avoid him, yet managed to stay upright, and was willing to let it go until Potter had the audacity to smirk at him ghoulishly.  Like a bloody
good, okay?” Harry retorted, voice rising with defiance.  “What, you want me to wax poetic about how the leather grips your arse?  Hell.”
what I’m talking about,” he said, pressing his pointer finger to Potter’s chest.  He could feel the heartbeat racing, wild, underneath.  “Sixth year, Potter.  Chasing me around,
And thank you to everyone for reading!  I'm trucking along with writing this (though I might be a little busy as we lead up to the holidays...and I still am considering writing something small for Christmas - GAH!  We'll see how life happens.)  But I hope everyone is staying safe and indoors!
Draco didn’t even try to hide the shock that graced his face.  Surely, he had misheard. The request was so unexpected that he had trouble wrapping his head around it.
Whereas the steps had been perfunctory and reckless from Harry, Malfoy made them feel fluid and practiced.  His turns were effortless; his timing was perfect—his hands were steady as they guided Harry through a dance that was as intoxicating as it was frightening.
[The judges approach HARRY’S work station, hesitating as he dumps several cups of flour into the mixing bowl, sending up a white cloud several feet in every direction.  He looks up, grinning good-naturedly when he sees the emcee.]
But nope.  It was what it was, and despite twenty minutes coaching himself to the contrary and ‘channeling his inner lion,’ Harry was
” Harry continued quickly, before he could be interrupted, “just because he struggles with this particular spell doesn’t mean he’s not brilliant at other ones.  Ones even
Harry was still looking at him, so he forced himself to answer.  “Not at the time, but later.”  His voice dropped to a whisper.  “Mother told me.”
He strolled into the Great Hall, distracted and late, but when his eyes landed upon Harry, the man was already beaming up at him.  Draco felt something crack and melt inside of him.
When he got to the pitch, they were already circling and hitting bludgers at each other.  This was a bit surprising for two reasons – the first being that Draco would not have pinned them as prospective beaters, and second, because they were actually quite decent from what he could see.  The two of them must’ve been practicing over the summer.
It wasn’t until three days later – or nights, rather, as Potter came banging on his door at nearly four in the morning – that his trick was finally acknowledged, and Draco could be openly triumphant about it.  Well, as triumphant as he could be, given the circumstances.
; they’re not giving me anything.  I asked everyone to make a showstopper, and what you brought me is a cake that I might get at the supermarket.  Technically, it’s very well done – but there’s nothing
have a point.  The house elves were sure to put together a feast that rivalled any spread of sweets they could offer.  And costumes were part of the dress code as well.
Potter glowered so hard Draco could feel his disdain like a physical touch.  Which was amusing, but also sobering, and once he was done cackling, he offered him a hand.  After all, he loved irritating the man, but his goal was to draw him closer – not alienate him even further.  “Come on Potter, there’s more to see.”
going to leave him hanging, which he corrected by bursting into amused laughter.  “Merlin, your face.  It was a
They ended up in the Room of Requirement, as there were still people milling around both the boys’ and girls’ dorm rooms in their wing, and the library – sorry Ron! – was out, too.  The Room had morphed into the perfect interrogation chamber: a long wooden table with uncomfortable chairs at either end.  The lighting was bad, coming in slatted strips through the window, and the only decoration was a life-sized painting of him – the same that hung in the lobby of the Ministry – so Harry knew for a fact that Hermione was pissed.  The thing was proportionally-off and hideous (which she knew), and it was obvious that she was including it to make a point.
He seemed as hesitant to move as Draco was, but more than anything Draco did not want to be present in the flow of students on their way down for breakfast. So Draco squeezed Potter's hand one last time before getting up and walking to his room.
Draco nodded. It had been an exhausting day and now he didn't have the energy to leave his room. He didn't think he'd be able to stomach food if he managed to move from where he fell. He stiffened when he felt Harry take his hands to look at the broken and discolored skin.
Without realizing he was doing it, Draco's thumb started to run back and forth across Harry's knuckles. Harry turned into his side and brought their hands up and just watched as Draco continued to comfort him silently. Draco rolled to mirror Harry's position, making their knees touch.
All Draco did with that non-permission was draw his feet onto the couch and maneuvered them to be resting beneath him. He knew his feet would go numb and when he decided to stand again his ankles wouldn't want to support his weight, but he didn't care. He still expected to be disciplined for sitting in such a disgraceful way, for not preserving the
.  (As expected, the dicey men who’d fucked him couldn’t keep their traps shut about bagging a fallen aristocrat.)  It had ended, as always, in a fight.  One in which Lucius had hurled insults about his son’s reputation, and Draco had reiterated that his father would just never
“It’s not like a crush or anything,” she said, surprising him.  “I mean, I think Kat’s the greatest, and she’s my best friend, but…”  Here, she took a deep breath.  “I just want to be like her.”
so!” he assured.  “Well, now that that’s settled-”  He patted his knees with finality before moving to heave himself up.
With cautious steps, he reached the window and threw up the sash.  The bird stepped in, glaring at him until he unwound the missive from his claw.  Then, without waiting for a response, Agamemnon jumped from the ledge and soared away.
He cupped Harry’s other cheek and squeezed, watching his whole body squirm at the sensation.  The intensity of it all was confusing him – he was past all those feelings, wasn’t he?  In agreed-upon scenarios like this, was it okay to think thoughts like that?  As long as he drew the line between fantasy and reality?
“Here, I’m going to go grab you one of the Nimbus 2001s from the storage room.  You can try it out and see if it works any better for you.”
“Oh, really?  The same Divination essay that Ron conveniently left for the library to start five minutes ago?  You’re not
it?  There was this terrible feeling building in his chest – like something that was always there, only now it was growing larger.  Suffocatingly so.
Draco’s eyes snapped to his.  “No.”  He couldn’t imagine anything more torturous than dealing with his father
TEACHER’S VOICE: [muffled, vaguely familiar] Remember to add your hot milk mix in small doses to the egg – otherwise it’ll cook and turn to scrambled eggs.
was thinking.  So I decided to check with Hannah.”  There was no reason to inform him that Hannah had been the one to bring it to his attention in the first place – he had nearly forgotten the students’ rumors by that point already.
The words dunked him in ice, not dissimilar to the feeling of passing through a ghost.  “Father,” he managed – but only just.
Once Harry had settled in next to him, Draco took a fortifying breath and decided to get this over with.  “It seems that I will be spending Christmas holidays at the Manor.”  He tried to convey the long-suffering battle he had fought before arriving at this conclusion; he didn’t want Harry to think he
The game was fun, of course, but tedious – as there wasn’t much for him to do in terms of refereeing.  Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors were too sanctimonious to cheat, usually.  But there was excitement in the stands, and when Gryffindor’s seeker caught the snitch and ended the game, the whole house exploded into cheering that no doubt carried back to the castle.
Neville had immediately raced off to find Luna once they reached the entrance to Hogwarts to show her the new books. The other four all headed straight back to the Inter House common room. Unfortunately, Ginny was leaning against one of the windows. Once she spotted Harry approaching she met him halfway and snogged him senseless. Blaise fake gagged and received a middle finger from Ginny for his efforts.
Hermione read over the question before going back to reading over his previous work. She motioned for Draco to sit and got right to explaining. She used textbooks and diagrams to help, which was a great help visually but Draco felt as though he was being overloaded with extra, unnecessary information. They ended up spending the majority of the three hours going over the question, double and triple checking everything. He dropped off the parchment on the way to dinner.
That's what Draco could smell, Harry's aftershave. Draco didn't want to admit that it was nearly as comforting as the lavender. But it was. That scared Draco more than anything. As did the tension that had settled over the two boys as they ate. It diminished Draco's appetite and he found himself only eating just over a third of the stew.
Draco had hidden in the alcove behind one of the bookcases. It was a surprise that they hadn't spotted him yet. He had to cover his mouth with his hand to hold back the gasp that bubbled up. He did not want to be on the receiving end of Ginny's wrath. He pulled himself in tighter, he could no longer see the pair he could only hear them.
Most of the students had gathered around the tree sitting with their unwrapped gifts and admiring them. Wrapping paper mountains were dotted across the floor and Draco knew he'd probably be n clean up duty with Hermione in the morning. He'd started his walk towards Harry when the door swung open.
"I'm not angry," she swivelled her head back to her boyfriend. "I have you to myself Thursday's after lunch now."
Blaise muttered a goodnight before almost sprinting to the dorm. Sprinting away from the slight tension that had dropped over the four. Theodore glanced at Draco before going after Blaise. Harry poked Draco's cheek.
Finally, one night Ginny had been ill and Blaise had overworked himself so fell asleep almost immediately after dinner. Harry and Draco were both free to stargaze. They waited up in the common room until around half eleven before Harry wrapped his invisibility cloak around the two of them. The two barely fit, both quite tall and Harry was fairly broad. Draco's sure their shoes and ankles were visible but he didn't care. He just wanted to be up at the Astronomy tower. The sooner they got there the sooner the electric feeling Draco got when Harry's arm brushed against his would stop.
"It isn't some big realisation. I've known exactly what I felt about him ever since he started visiting over the summer. The butterflies in my stomach were the biggest indicator."
Ginny was sat at the eighth year's table, doting on Harry. Blaise and Theodore both fake gagged at the sight, laughing together before Blaise buckled and rushed over to where Pansy was sat with Susan. Hermione gently pulled Theodore towards Neville and sat him down, trying to distract him from the way Blaise was acting. It seemed as though no-one wanted to be an audience to Harry and Ginny. Harry met his eyes, a pained expression on his face. Draco was looking for an escape when he spotted Luna. He tried to send an apologetic smile to Harry, but Draco had a feeling Harry knew he was not sorry at all.
He hadn't noticed Blaise approaching him until a hand was waving in Draco's face. He blinked slowly pulling his thoughts out of the Harry spiral and onto Blaise.
If Harry marked the exact sentence when Draco had officially nodded off so they could continue reading together it was nothing more than subconscious coincidence.
"Hello Draco. Neville told me about your trip. I hope you're all feeling ok," Luna greeted as he sat. "It is nargle season after all."
Draco smiled and pulled the covers over the two He tucked Blaise's head under his chin and rubbed circles into his back. He'd done this with Blaise before and it had always helped him sleep.
"I always admired you. And Fred," Draco added, smiling. "Even through the hardest parts of my life your pranks kept going around me. They helped me so much, I don't think I'll ever stop repaying you. I'll swing by during the holidays, some weekends too if I can get away."
"The only time I'm free long enough is for three hours after lunch on Thursdays," Draco remembered his full schedule.
"Anything for a fellow Gryffindor beater, Georgie. Besides it's not like he actually got up to much."
Draco had not returned for his seventh year as his father wanted him by his side. If he had gone back life would've been better, he would've had his friends.
Draco sighed, bidding Theodore good night before retreating to his room. He made sure to shoo Theodore away when he had come to check Draco's progress. Which, admittedly, was none. Blaise wouldn't let Draco in if he even suspected Theodore was lurking somewhere. He knocked gently on the door, announcing it was just him. Draco heard a spell being whispered before the door opened, revealing a very tired and tipsy Blaise. Dean and Seamus were in Dean's bed, sleeping soundly from what Draco could tell, so he led Blaise to his own bed as quietly as possible. He made spae for the two of them to lie and cast
"Oh poor baby, what a terrible thing date nights on a Monday must be," and really Draco had been trying to not get involved. He tried to hold it back, but now he was far too comfortable around Harry and Hermione and his true sarcasm needed to be released. Harry and Hermione were clearly trying to keep in their laughter after recovering from the shock. Hermione had let a few giggles out but Harry was holding strong. Ginny looked ready to slit his throat.
Harry continued laughing as Draco made himself more comfortable in the pillow pile. He really did feel like a cat, aching to go to sleep in the warmth of the fireside.
"How about we start off with Truths? Start with really simple, impersonal stuff and then when we're a bit more comfortable we can move onto more personal things. It can turn into Truth or Shot then," Theodore suggested. "Once we're sufficiently drunk we can move onto the classics. Still taking a shot if you don't answer or do the dare though."
In Draco's opinion the, hug lasted far longer than anything he'd be comfortable with, but the two men looked comfortable enough in each other's company. Besides they'd obviously known each other for years, Alex could not have been more than three years older than George which meant they would've been on the Gryffindor quidditch team together. All the Weasley's seemed to have a thing for Quidditch men, Draco could've sworn that Percy had a fling with Wood before he ended up with Marcus. Not to mention Ron's obsession with Krum in fourth year. He didn't know whether Bill had ever had the same inclination, Charlie most definitely would not have but Fred was an exception, Lee Jordan didn't play Quidditch at least - as short lived as that relationship was.
"No bloody reason?! He's killed people Harry. He has the dark mark. He's a Death Eater. It's his fault Fred is dead, it's his fault half the people who died are dead," another scoff. "He gets to come back though. Sauntering like he's still the precious prince of Hogwarts and can do no wrong."
"I hate being part Veela, have I ever told you that? I've had people kiss me because they were accidentally charmed with my looks," Blaise let out a sob. "I don't want it happening again. I though Pans and I would end up married, 'cause of our families, you know? Theodore had to go and bloody kiss me and suddenly I think he's the Veela."
They ate their food in silence, sitting in the warm glow of the fire. A house elf appeared to retrieve their plates but also brought them some chocolate cake straight from the kitchens.
"I liked it," Blaise whispered, brokenly. "It was just a dare but he kissed me and I liked it, Dray. I want him to do it again."
"Honestly, Harry. He's so fussy about the quality of his work," Hermione huffed. "I don't know how you deal with him."
There was firewhiskey and some cakes dotted around the desks in the common room. Hermione had made it into a whole event. Draco had to admit it was pleasant all lower years had been banned from the evening. There wouldn't be anyone invading the peace f the moment. People were hugging and chatting with everyone as they were given gifts over the course of the evening. Hermione was overjoyed as she opened the first edition, but still scolded Blaise as it was at least 10 galleons over budget. Blaise claimed that he got the conversions wrong and managed to get away with it.
Pansy came running down the stairs before tackling Draco in the biggest hug he had ever received. She promptly did the same to Theodore before practically throwing herself at Blaise, knocking them both to the floor. Laughter rang out within the group, though Blaise tried to keep a straight face it wasn't long until he joined in with the hysterics. It must have been quite a sight for the poor fourth year student who had come to retrieve them.
Draco had heard back from George first. His letter had arrived before Ginny's. Charlie's letter followed soon after saying the same thing. The only difference was that George said Ginny was being an incredibly petty bitch while Charlie merely said she was blowing things out of proportion. Draco supposed that meant he had two Weasleys on his side as he hadn't heard back from the others. They believed him, that's what mattered most. In the aftermath Draco had done his best to avoid Ginny. It had only been a week and a half but he was running on a 100% success rate. He'd managed to head in the opposite direction whenever he saw her coming and had timed his meals so that the two would never be in the Great Hall together at the same time.
"Piss off. Nobody here cares. Me especially," Harry spat out. "Fuck off with your new boyfriend and his parents."
George was plating up when he walked down into the dining room. It looked like a hearty stew with some dumplings. Heavier than anything he'd eaten since Hogwarts. Draco wondered whether George had brought the ingredients with him. He certainly did not get them from the empty pantry. He took his seat and inhaled deeply. The food smelled delicious but there was another scent weaving in with the stews.
It was why he was unsurprised when that Wednesday afternoon had gone the way it did. He'd known that Ginny had arranged a movie day for Harry in the common room and had taken his leave for the library to study for his December tests. There was only so much studying his brain could take and it had been at least four hours since he'd left. He'd thought it would be safe to return as Ginny usually headed for lunch at this time. He headed back to the common room in a haze of bliss, only to walk in on Ginny screaming in Harry's face. Harry was trying to calm her, acting as though she was a dangerous, wild animal.
When they reached the tower Harry produced a blanket and some cushions for them. He wouldn't answer any of Draco's questions on where they had come from, or if he'd been carrying them somehow for the walk there. Harry sent him a playful glare and Draco let up the questioning to open the shutters while Harry set up their space. They had spent an hour up there and Draco had moved his train of thought from the necessary constellations for the lesson to just about every constellation he could point out and tell Harry about.
Hermione shook her head in disagreement. Draco kept his eyes cast down on his plate of food. He had been hoping to get through dinner without Ginny glaring at him. He'd been fairly successful since term began, with a few nights she'd glared him out of his appetite. He'd never sat exactly opposite her and even after a couple of months she was
"I've been informed that this is your favourite," George smiled, taking his seat opposite Draco. "I see Harry's things fit. Good, I didn't think you'd fit into mine and it was too late to get anything from one of your friends."
"That's such a good job, Draco. I'm sure you'd be fantastic," Harry was the quickest to recover. "If they don't let you in give me a call. I'm sure a recommendation from the Chosen One will change their minds."
Blaise groaned and finished his drink. That seemed to be the end of the conversation but it was the most Draco had heard from Blaise about the topic so he didn't want to push it. The two headed back to Hogwarts and quickly hid their haul form prying eyes. A lot of the eighth years were asking around, trying to discover who had who and what people were getting. Draco would absolutely not risk his gift getting to Harry before it was even done. If it could be done.
Harry did something unexpected. He gave Draco a brief hug, before saying goodbye to continue his original mission of finding Dean. Draco sat in shock. Having Harry's hand on his back when he was more focused on his pillow was one thing, but being alert during the hug was another. He couldn't remember hugging anyone but George, Blaise, Pansy and his mother. Though Pansy's were one-sided. He liked Harry's hug, he wanted more. The feeling started to bubble in his stomach. He did not want to deal with it and tried to ignore it and shove it down. He knew exactly what the feeling was and he absolutely could not be feeling it for Harry Potter.
"Hmm," Blaise played with his glass, rolling the bottom around on the coaster. "I really like T. I think I've always liked him, Dray. That's the scary part."
George laughed, leading Draco gently to the upper wing. George had successfully managed to navigate his way to the upper wing and Draco's bedroom. He didn't know how George got him there, nor did he care. He just watched in silence as George drew him the promised bath and added the lavender bath salts Draco had stolen from his mother months before.
Draco was still worrying about his friend when they reached the pub. Blaise led him to a booth towards the back before leaving Draco to head up to the bar. He returned with five butterbeers balanced carefully on a tray.
The other four laughed at Blaise's comment. It wasn't the social life that Draco was worried about, in fact he would much prefer it if he did have the time. He was worried about the other students. He would absolutely hex anyone who gave him trouble, so long as it was self defence. He just wanted to avoid the trouble and he thought that throwing himself into his schoolwork would work well, among distracting him from other things.
Harry and Draco arrive at a mutually beneficial arrangement, while Draco finally stands up to Ginny.
Theodore came stomping back into the common room: "He's bloody locked the door. You're going to have to talk to him."
"I know it isn't really. There's no way he found out about anything if I haven't even discovered it myself."
"I don't think we're at the point of comfortable nudity," George let out an unsure laugh. "I'm going to cook and I'll grab you when it's ready if you haven't shown up before then."
"That young man told me my son was safe and alive. I owed him a lie. I care more about Draco than my reputation. I hope you rot in Azkaban when they throw you in there."
"I'm bi. I can't remember whether or not I told you that yet. But I am," Blaise refused to meet Draco's eyes.
"What? I thought it might be nice for you to listen to some Muggle literature. Plus, Hermione's mentioned she's trying to get you to read this for months."
"Wait, I was supposed to dare him," Draco refused to admit it came out far whinier than he wanted. It was hopeless in any case as Harry had already begun making his way around the circle. Most people got a peck on their forehead or cheek, Hermione got a shorter peck on the lips. It was followed by light giggles, covering up blushes or scoffing at the stupidity of it. Draco tried to will away the feeling in his stomach, he was not sober enough to address that. Before he had reigned it in Harry was kneeling in front of him, smiling softly. Draco could admit that Harry's eyes shone when he smiled like that. He wasn't expecting the gentles kiss on the lips, one that lasted a breath of a second longer than Hermione's had. They both couldn't help but laugh, too tipsy to care about anything that was happening. Harry finally made it back to where he had started and spun the bottle carelessly. It had moved from the centre during it's spin but landed on Seamus.
"You unloaded on to me, it's only fair I unload a little back, right?" He tried to act jokingly. Like he hadn't just dropped a bomb on Draco's carefully constructed world.
Draco thought Hermione should've mentioned it wasn't a particularly large group on the Hogsmeade excursion. In fact Draco wasn't sure it could even be classed as a group at just himself, Hermione, Blaise, Neville and Harry. Nobody really needed to go to every shop so the plan was to split up and then meet at The Three Broomsticks for a late lunch. Despite Blaise not needing the things Draco did, he had stuck to the latter's side all day. Even when Draco spent nearly two hours in Tomes and Scrolls, finding the books he needed rather quickly but stopping to browse for the ones he wanted to read on Hermione's recommendations. Blaise finally grew tired and dragged Draco into Honeydukes to stock up on the two's secret sweets supply, that wasn't so secret.
Finally becoming more aware of the world around him Draco sluggishly walked to the front door. Unaware but frankly unbothered about his possible appearance he used what little strength he had to open the door. He was well aware of how heavy his body felt to move.
Draco shoved George that time, with Alex muttering about not being too harsh. Draco chose to ignore the two and headed to the car himself, sitting in the back. No doubt George would want Alex up front with him. As worried as Draco was about Christmas becoming too sickeningly sweet he wasn't opposed to the three of them being slightly cramped in the flat.
"We both know you're doing as good as usual in Potions and Charms. Neville says Herbology isn't causing you any problems. You should be teaching Astronomy. So it's gotta be Muggle Studies," Harry's voice was quiet. "I could tutor you. If you would be willing to tutor me in Astronomy?"
So much for no lower years invading the peace. Ginny came through like a whirlwind. She had bragged about her new boyfriend, stating he was infinitely better than Harry had been. She called Harry ungrateful and said that he didn't know what he'd lost. It was petty until she had the audacity to claim that she'd be meeting the boy's parents over Christmas, something she never would have done if she stayed with Harry. Draco didn't know when Ginny had turned into such a horrid person. Perhaps she always had been. It never mattered much to him. It had gotten too much for Harry, though Draco was proud he'd held restraint until that moment.
"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort," Harry started to read out loud.
"Perfect! We'll do an hour and a quarter of Muggle Studies and an hour and a quarter of Astronomy, with a half hour break in between," Harry decided. "We'll make this work, I'm sure."
Theodore took Blaise's face into his hands and kissed him deeply. Draco noticed the faint flush on their faces, though Blaise's was harder to see. He wasn't sure whether it was from the alcohol or the kiss itself. When they finished Blaise's blank expression hadn't changed. Theodore's smirk was still in place as he spoke.
Draco lifted himself away from the pillow and nodded before promptly shoving his face back into said pillow and screaming again. He felt the bed dip next to him, nearly jumping out of skin when a warm hand was tentatively placed on his back. It wasn't long until the hand was rubbing small circles at the bottom of his spine.
He had lost his friends who had set off immediately to inspect their new living space and resigned to glumly following the ones who wanted to avoid him most.
"No," Harry tried to remove his hands, now fully aware of the blood. "Wouldn't want to be a bother. 'sides I've already got most of it."
Once they arrived he was shocked at the common room. It looked as cosy as the Hufflepuff's but all of the houses banners were displayed. While the dorms were still split by gender they had been arranged so that students from houses mixed with others. He was sharing with Blaise and Dean. Theodore, Neville, Harry and Seamus would be sharing the room opposite. Though he wasn't sure whether Dean and Seamus would stick to that arrangement or find ways to share a room.
Lucious had always wanted to play happy families at Christmas. Mostly wanting to show the strength and infamy of the Malfoy name. When he was younger it hadn't bothered Draco, really it made him happy because his father actually seemed to want to spend time with him. He grew wise in his teenage years. Ever since he was fourteen he'd spent Christmas at Hogwarts, away from his father's hold. The castle always decorated itself beautifully and the mood would become more uplifting the closer the date crept up to the 25th.
"I can't bloody believe you did that. We were all wondering when she was going to say something about the tutoring sessions. There was a betting pool," Blaise momentarily looked sad. "I should've bet on you blowing up at her."
"If I wanted you dead I would've abandoned you in the Room of Requirement," Potter scoffed. "Besides I made a promise to your mother. I intend to keep it."
The Manor would be dreadfully empty and would be constantly monitored by aurors. Draco supposed that it may just be exactly where he belonged.
The longer Draco stayed in the bath the sadder he got. The lavender filled his senses and he missed his mother terribly. Her portrait wasn't the same thing as being enveloped in one of her hugs. He escaped and wrapped himself in the fluffy towel. He slowly sank to the floor, leaning against the tub. He tried to slow his breathing slight to avoid crying but he just created an opening for the sobs to fill his lungs. He would be ashamed to say he spent around a half hour sat in that position, crying.
"Blaise-ikins!" A screech echoed through the dungeon. It seemed as though he wouldn't be without Pansy after all.
Draco spent many hours reading up on Charms, asking McGonagall for help when he reached an impasse. He'd spent many hours perfecting the charm on practice pictures to make sure they moved as smoothly as a regular wizard picture. On top of his lessons and Winter reading he was incredibly drained and it hadn't gone unnoticed by his friends. Blaise and Pansy would tease him when they found him asleep at the desk but still wrapped him in a blanket or made sure he got to bed at a reasonable hour. Theodore would laugh whenever he came across Draco hunched over the pictures but would leave him a warm drink and some food from the kitchens. Draco was very grateful for his friends. He would've reached a maximum a few days before the gift exchange if it wasn't for them.
Though perhaps the show of bravery at the battle was a bigger step towards his wish. Running Potter's wand back to him, disowning the Death Eaters he had been officially sworn into only moments before. His mother had dragged him back to her, clinging onto him tightly. His father had other ideas.
They refused the offer of an escort and picked up easy conversation as they made their way through the familiar corridors. It wasn't long before they arrived, noticing that they were the last of the eighth years to arrive. Harry and Hermione waved, Draco smiled in return before they turned back to Dean and Seamus. Neville was talking to a couple of Hufflepuff students and the few Ravenclaws kept to themselves. All conversation hushed the moment McGonagall reached the podium.
Draco and his friends would always do a small gift exchange before they left to see their families. Hermione had informed him that to further strengthen Inter House bonding they'd be doing what the Muggles called Secret Santa and the gift exchange would be held on the 16th. Dutifully he stood in the common room, waiting to pull a name from the garish Santa hat Hermione was waving about. It was peppermint cane striped with glitter on the fur trim. Draco didn't have any idea where Hermione might have found it.
They made their way towards the car. George was insistent that his mum had let him borrow it, Draco had a strong inkling that none of it was true and it was far more likely that George had stolen it yet again. Everyone had heard about the twins exploits in second year. George paused at the Manor doors.
"Lucious, he did the right thing. Leave the poor boy be," his mother's hold on him tightened even further.
"You are seventeen years old, for Christ's sake. You might want to think about acting like it," Draco sighed. "I highly doubt Harry wants to be dating a small child."
Draco sat in silence after Harry had left. He was the third person Draco had come out to, only Pansy and Blaise knew. Though he suspect Hermione might have figured it out herself. He felt almost lighter after telling Harry. It was another step towards being just Draco instead of Draco
Draco could feel his heart breaking. He hadn't needed time to decide exactly what to do with his feelings. Harry had made that decision for him. He still stared at Draco with Lucious' eyes. Draco's grey eyes still shone with fear. Except this time his father was in Azkaban. What were the repercussions of standing up for who'd he'd become since the war?
"Seamus, my best friend of 8 years. My boyfriend of 5 months," Dean jokingly took in a deep breath. "I like you."
The two boys walked in a comfortable silence to the pub. Thinking about the trip, Draco realised it had mostly been spent in silence. Blaise had only spoken to him in Honeydukes and it was small talk at best. He hoped that it was because Blaise had taken his advice and was mulling over the Theodore problem sober. Although that might have already been decided if Blaise's attitude at breakfast was anything to go by.
"I think you should let Harry go through that. We can grab a few of the plainer things and get you your own clothes in the new year?" George entered the bedroom.
A quick visit to Hogsmeade allows even more group bonding for the Inter-House eighth years. Followed by hateful glares and lost appetites.
DISCLAIMER: I do not support JK Rowling's stance on pretty much anything at this point. I especially do not agree with her transphobic views. I love the characters though and as many people on both here and Tumblr have pointed out - it's great that we as a fandom agree that Harry Potter came out of nowhere from an anonymous author that left so much room for fans to create their works from.
Once they arrived Ginny was sat with Harry yet again. This time he did not have an escape as Hermione pulled him to sit next to her, immediately opposite the ginger she-devil.
Seamus nodded against Dean's chest, the latter bidding everyone good night as they left. This prompted a few others to do the same. Even though there weren't any classes the following day, it was getting late. A lot of the students were too drunk to be coherent anyway. Soon it was just Theodore, Blaise, Harry and Draco. They'd happened to be the most sober in the group. Draco had been enjoying himself too. The other eighth year's made bonding incredibly easy.
"The one you're named after?" Draco nodded. "Is that how you got into astronomy? Most Black's are named after constellations, right?"
Draco watched as a few students approached McGonagall, Harry included. Draco wished to ask him about it but knew that Ginny would be looking for Harry. It would have to wait until they had all settled in for the evening. Draco himself had owled McGonagall prior to returning about his subject changes. He knew everything had been arranged for him.
The group burst into laughter, whether they knew about it or not. In this act it seemed as though much of the tension dissipated. The eighth years grew more comfortable with each other rather easily. It only took a few more simple rounds - during which they had found out about Hermione and Ron's first kiss in detail, Harry and Ginny's first time in less detail and they watched Neville place his hand into the fire to see if it would burn (it did, but nowhere near nonmagical fire would've) - before they had grown comfortable to move into a more risqué set of questions and dares. This also could've had a lot more to do with the amount of firewhiskey that had been consumed. Draco was only tipsy, as were a few others. However most people had been taking shots out of boredom and were teetering on the edge of too far gone.
Draco nodded, taking a seat on the large mass of pillows in front of the fire. It was warm and reminded him of the nights he and his mother would read together. He managed to say upright for a total of two minutes before collapsing and sinking into the pillows. He felt his eyes closing. It seemed that he needed to catch up on sleep after all the excessive studying.
"Sorry, I didn't mean to unload on you," Draco withdrew into himself, hugging his knees to his chest.
"Well, we have the same timetable. Though I was not allowed to take Muggle Studies and plants don't really like me," Harry laughed.
"McGonagall has arranged it all. I'll be doing Charms with her as one to one classes, I'm sitting in on the sixth and seventh year classes for Muggle Studies. Other than that, I'll be attending seventh year classes just like the rest of you."
As George opened the door he revealed an Auror. He looked younger than the ones Draco had seen the most of, but he was familiar. Draco could've sworn he remembered the green eyes staring into his, full of concern. And he was sure that the brown hair had been a fixture in the kitchen and drawing room though it had no need to be.
"Quidditch practice has been rescheduled to fit in with the new captain's timetable. Besides, Hermione is perfectly capable of tutoring you," Ginny scoffed.
"The way I see it we've both lost the person we loved the most. We have that in common," George said, tears welling in his eyes. "That person tried to protect you from your father. She did her best but you were still forced into what you did. Anyone with half a brain could see how much it destroyed you from the inside out. You deserve that second chance, Draco."
As he packed a bag Draco realised he was in dire need of new muggle clothing, or at the very least less formal wizard clothing. Even his pyjamas seemed far too formal for Christmas with George. He rummaged around the back of his wardrobe and found a bag marked 'Sirius'. He wasn't aware there was a bag of his cousin's clothes, though he vaguely remembered Andromeda dropping off some clothes for Draco when he was young. His father had protested greatly and banished both Andromeda and the bag out of the house. His mother must have snuck it back in.
The other two had joined Draco on the floor - periodically bursting into bouts of giggles - when Hermione came down to walk with them to dinner a half hour later. The four walked to the Great Hall, Hermione and Blaise were trying to ask questions about the spell he created. Draco wasn't answering them, both for George's sake and his own. Also the three boys could burst into laughter at any moment so honestly Hermione didn't get much out of any of them in terms of conversation.
They'd found an empty bottle to spin. Theodore insisted that the randomness made the games more fun. He'd also been the one to kick it off, putting so much force into his spin it seemed endless. Though it did end, landing on Blaise. The usually soft spoken Theodore smirked and Blaise's usual cool composure dropped. It was an odd show for Draco.
"At least now there's someone less scary than your father to keep you in line," Theodore smiled walking into the room.
"You've always been surrounded by people even if you weren't interacting with them. You're friends and family were always there if you needed them," George crossed his arms. "This is the first time you're truly alone."
"Draco!" Blaise smirked, emerging from the boys dormitories. "This is a surprise, I didn't think we'd be seeing you. You look healthier than when I saw you last. Weasley's been treating you well then?"
It wasn't until a few days after the incident that Draco saw Harry again. He seemed to be holding himself carefully, afraid one wrong move would get him into trouble or ruin the progress he had made. Draco recognised it from the way he held himself when he was younger, though he doubted anyone else could even spot a difference. Theodore had informed him that the almost daily letters from Ron had stopped, and Harry's letter's had become little more than a page instead of the two or three they usually were. It was clear that Ron and Harry were tiptoeing around each other, not knowing the best way to approach the subject. Harry was curled up in the chair nearest to the fire. He was reading a book and carefully trying to take a sip from a mug using only the one hand.
Harry was right about one thing. Draco did not care about himself. He never had beyond the drive to stay alive. For the first sixteen years of his life, he'd been shaped to become a Death Eater. It's all he had known. Now he was marked with the Dark Mark permanently he wondered if it was all he would ever be. He couldn't be like Harry. Someone who stayed strong despite the pressures mounting on them. He wasn't built for it. Sixth year had been hell. Draco had been left exhausted by his inner conflict and had spent most of the year trying to overcome one illness or another. Blaise had tied him to the bed, once. He'd forced countless strengths of dreamless sleep draughts down Draco's throat and then stayed awake all night, just to ensure Draco slept well enough. His friends were inherently good people. Draco was not. All he'd known was how to be harsh and cruel, that the only person he could rely on was himself. He knew the last part wasn't true anymore. He didn't think he could change the first part. He was trying and he thought that he had been successful but it became painfully apparent that Draco was misled.
Blaise laughed filling his arms with as much as possible, then filling Draco's once the space had run out. Draco was rather happy that Blaise paid, he didn't want to know how many galleon's were spent on sweets that would be lucky to last the fortnight.
"Hey," Draco whispered, kneeling down and gently taking Harry's hands into his own. "You know there's spells for this?"
"You could enchant the book," Draco smiled, glad to see Harry taking some time for himself rather than forcing his extroverted nature that wasn't as bright as it had been.
Draco got caught in a similar self-deprecation and identity questioning spiral that he had in sixth year. Only this time he was alone. He didn't pay attention to his surroundings. He went through the motions necessary for survival. He really should've questioned where exactly the meals he was eating had been coming from. He hadn't cooked, he hadn't left the manor to get food. He hadn't even bathed. He was unknowingly ignoring the army of owls that had taken residence in the garden. He was numb.
"I've been alone my whole life," there it was. The talk. "It doesn't matter any more now than it has before."
There had been a lot of kissing dares, but other than when Harry had kissed everyone Blaise and Theodore hadn't been kissed. Draco thought they had been lucky, he'd ended up making out with Neville and kissing a tipsy Hermione. Both with rules that it was never to be mentioned. Draco looked at the two of his best friends. Blaise had dropped his cool composure once more, though he was trying to keep his face blank. Draco couldn't tell what he was thinking. Theodore was confident, ready to rise to the challenge. This was such a change from the boy they had known before the war, Draco could not guess the outcome.
The war had taken its toll on everybody. It affected everyone differently. Two out of three of the Golden Trio return for their eighth year. One very blonde, very familiar ex-Death Eater also returns. They all have their own troubles and difficulties fitting in, finding where they belong in this new Hogwarts. And of course all Eighth years share one dormitory, not many of them came back after all, not many were alive to come back. As they're all confined in such close quarters new secrets come to light and students find things out about each other that they never knew, or even considered, before.
Draco nodded his agreement and George left rather briskly. Draco couldn't remember the last time he'd even washed his face. Let alone bathing or showering. His hair must be in the state of greasy, tangled curls. As he undressed he caught a scent radiating off of him and he was surprised that George came within 5 foot of him. He sighed as he entered the tub and he slowly sank into the familiar comfort of a warm, lavender bath. The scent was making him slightly drowsy but it smelled like his mother so he revelled in it. He spent the first ten minutes dipping completely under the water before resurfacing for air. It was something he'd done as a child. He decided it would be better if he did scrub away the scent that lingered and wash his hair.
"I'm gay," the words had come out on their own. Draco didn't know why he'd admitted it. Maybe he could put that down to his own alcohol consumption. Harry had just come out to him and they were friends. Draco trusted him.
Harry held up his bread to Draco. Quickly catching on Draco lifted his own slice up so that they could 'cheers'. Draco selfishly wished that they could have more nights like this one. Nights where they were just two boys who hadn't been able to eat dinner. No problems or pressures looming over them because of their surnames. Just two teenagers sat in the warm, welcoming kitchens. Eating in peace.
"He did say you've been out of it for the past couple of days," George shrugged, finishing the stew. "You shouldn't be alone right now, Draco."
Dean shrugged at the question, pulling Seamus seamlessly into his lap. They both smiled as Dean leaned down to kiss the smaller boy. As Draco - unsurprised himself - looked around the group he could see a few shocked faces, but found himself to be in the majority of people who already knew. It was rather obvious from the way they acted towards each other. Draco had picked it up during McGonagall's speech in the Great Hall. Blaise had not.
The true hunger didn't until around 10pm when it felt as though his stomach was trying to eat itself. He left a note for Blaise in case he woke up and found Draco's bed empty explained he'd snuck off to the kitchens to find leftovers.
"The Burrow is too Fred like. So we're gonna go to ours. We'll eat all the food Mum's stocked our fridge with, watch crappy Christmas telly, maybe get a bit shitfaced and then open presents."
"I don't suppose I could trouble you for some of that soup I saw at dinner, could I?" He asked as politely as he could.
"Hmm," Draco answered, nonchalantly. "Blaise has mentioned that in the past. It's true. Though I expect he did not mean it to be a compliment."
There was a sharp slapping sound. Draco screwed his eyes shut, he had been on the receiving end of that sound too many times. Adrenaline began to kick in. That was his mother. His mother who loved him, cared for him and protected him as best she could. Draco lost himself and began through curses, hexes and jinxes. Anything he could. It wasn't enough dark magic, but it was something. His father was too busy shielding to fire back, but Draco was running on empty.
"Harry, you were supposed to be back two hours ago," she snapped once she finally detached herself from his mouth.
Dean laughed, the two heading down to the common room together. Draco soon found himself sitting in a circle which spread over the sofas, armchairs and floor. It seemed that a game was being decided upon. Never have I ever being an option, as was truth or dare. It just happened that no-one really wanted to participate in either while sober.
"I can't tell you how to feel, Harry. I know that this is very conflicting for you. Hermione is going to be absolutely unbearable until Winter exams are over. Ron's her brother so I don't know how much of a help he'll be to you. But...I'm here. You can talk to me if you need to."
"Despite the war we've managed to have some first years. Trust me it was a process to find as many as we did and it's still not all of them. This means that there is not space for you in your old houses. The faculty and I came up with a solution. Or rather it came to us. The Room of Requirement has taken up permanent residence on the Third Floor. When inspected there was no damage from the events of the war. It has changed into a house of it's own, dormitories and the common room are already established. You will be living in this Inter House. Look after it. You will be attending most classes with returning seventh-years, though a few will be attending one to one classes alongside these. I assume you all want to continue with the subjects of study you had begun. If not please talk to me immediately. With all that said I shall leave you to find your accommodation. Good luck."
"Are those Harry's? We'll just bring these up for him," Dean quickly excused the three, not wanting to intrude or question what was making the Slytherin's laugh so much.
George smiled as he cleaned up around Draco. He shooed Draco out of the kitchen promptly, dealing with the mess himself. Draco hurried to his room, filled with an excitement that came out of nowhere. He wasn't exactly looking forward to spending Christmas at the flat but he definitely did not want to spend it in the Manor alone.
the new Quidditch captain. It was perfectly fine for you to practice on Thursday afternoons when everyone is available," Harry looked angry. " Stop being petty and go back to the original schedule. You have me Monday afternoons and evening's completely."
"No!" It came out in a roar, guttural and full of pain. He dropped down, crying over her body. Ready to accept his life's end all over again as his father readied another.
Harry let out a loud laugh at Draco's hesitation of the phrase. Once again it set the entire group off laughing. The conversation drifted from school back into their personal lives. Mostly if anyone had made plans for Christmas yet - Hermione had of course - but Draco wouldn't join that topic. No-one pushed him for an answer.
"That's brilliant, Mione. Um, honestly I'm not sure what I'll do. Definitely not an auror," Harry sighed, smiling bitterly into his empty glass.
"That's it," George stood, his chair screeching against the floor. "Pack a bag. You're coming to the flat with me."
Draco must've expressed more confusion than he wanted because it wasn't long until Harry was justifying himself.
"It's fine. I was stuck with this question for the seventh year class. It's the very last question but I can't make heads or tails of it," Draco pointed towards the end of his parchment.
Draco sat for a few moments, staring in shock. He pushed his plate away and stood, moving his chair far more quietly than George had.
Ginny went for him over the table, red in the face. Harry held her back by her waist but he was smiling. Draco had worried he'd gone too far. He nodded at the door with his head, motioning that it was probably best if Draco left. Ginny had slunk back into her seat so Draco deemed it safe for him to leave without being chased. As he stood up he felt a sharp pain in his chin, Ginny smirking instead of sulking.
Out of the corner of his eye he saw Blaise hovering nearby. Theodore had approached Hermione, pulling a name out before smiling slightly. Draco watched Theodore's eyes dart to Blaise but just as quickly they had zeroed in on Pansy and Blaise was forgotten. Draco still didn't know exactly what was going on between the two boys.
Draco left the two, choosing to be alone with his thoughts as he made the way to the Great Hall. He didn't run into any other eighth years, Draco thought they must either already be at breakfast or sleeping of the hangovers he was sure many would be nursing. Once he reached the Great Hall he realised there were now five tables instead of four, though the fifth was significantly smaller than the others. The eighth years were firmly situated on the fifth table. Just as Draco thought a few were looking rather worse for ware. Hermione spotted him and waved him over. As soon as he dropped down onto the seat next to her he helped himself to a plate with French toast and some bacon. Draco also grabbed himself a glass of orange juice before focusing on his meal.
I'm trying to sort out an update schedule for this so it'll be weekly, rather than over two weeks between updates.
"Well, after I kissed you earlier I thought you should know. Besides we're friends now, aren't we? I would've told you sooner or later."
