His fingers tremble as he pops the button on Potter’s jeans. His breath stutters out of him as he lowers the zipper.
Draco breathes out through his nose and says, “You can’t leave your own party early, Potter.”
“Don’t,” Draco gasps out when Harry goes to roll off him, “Stay right here, please.”
“Harry? What’s wrong?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco’s feet touch down on the uneven ground outside of Azkaban. The sea is raging around the small island, waves crashing against the rocks and spraying foul smelling water up around him.
“Yes, good morning,” Draco greets, a hint of confusion in his voice, “What are you doing here?”
And that’s when Harry loses it, delighted laughter bursts out of his mouth, causing him to double over and clutch his side.
Harry’s face falls but Draco refuses to feel guilty. He isn’t going to pretend that he and Harry are on friendly terms. Granted, Draco had rather expected more anger on Harry’s part considering how things ended between them.
Draco wastes no time, swallowing down Harry’s entire length. He hums in pleasure at the taste of precome hitting his tongue and he slowly starts to bob his head up and down. One hand moves in sync with his mouth, while the other grips Harry’s thigh tightly.
Harry’s lips are slightly chapped, his palm warm where it rests against Draco’s cheek. The tip of Harry’s tongue nudges at Draco’s bottom lip and Draco is instantly hard, the arousal igniting in his body like a fire springing to life. Draco gasps and opens his mouth, allowing Harry to slide his tongue inside, where he twists it around Draco’s, the wet friction addicting.
Harry firmly slams the lid to the box closed and clears his throat, “So um, are we still asking awkward questions then?”
In the end, the choice is made for him when Potter opens the door, the smile on his face melting away when he gets a good look at Draco.
Harry laughs, leaning in to kiss Astoria’s cheek, “It’s fine. I am allowed to pick on him about this later though, right?”
“Can’t focus with you doing that,” Draco complains even though he doesn’t want Harry to move, ever.
“Is that a Phoenix Fire Tree?” he exclaims when he finds his voice again and Harry just nods, “Where in the hell did you get it?”
“I know,” Potter says with an embarrassed sigh and Draco's eyes reopen with a questioning look, “I spent six years watching you. That included meals,” Potter continues, looking more uncomfortable by the second, his hands clutching his coffee like a life line, “Wow, that sounded less creepy in my head. Anyway yeah, I know how much you like chocolate, Malfoy.”
Draco’s smile is enough to light up Harry’s entire world. “How’s forever sound?”
“Excuse me?” Malfoy says faintly, wiping his face.
Draco has a ridiculous, possessive thought that no one else should ever be allowed to witness this Just Kissed Potter. It should be for Draco’s eyes only.
“It’s okay, I’m here,” Harry whispers, mouth moving down to Draco’s neck.
Narcissa is watching the scene unfold with narrowed eyes. She glances at Harry, giving him a small, sympathetic smile which he tries his best to return, before she focuses her attention back on her son.
Draco.
Potter grips his own cock tightly around the base and Draco lifts up without needing to be told, silently waiting for Potter to conjure lube and line himself up. And then he sinks down, savoring every single second of the delicious burn.
“Fuck you,” Draco hisses, the tips of his ears reddening in anger, “This is over, I’m done.”
Finally he asks, “Are you sure?”
Of course, Ron chimes in next, “What the hell is
So no matter how uncomfortable this gathering might be for Draco, he’s trying,
at the morning edition of the Prophet. He almost feels like he’s watching from somewhere outside of his body as the paper bursts into flames, the engagement announcement disappearing until all that’s left is a pile of ash.
There’s a small line of people waiting to get on the ride. They take their place and Draco watches as the teenage girl in front of them stuffs some kind of fluffy, blue and pink colored food into her mouth.
Hermione bustles in a moment later and spots him immediately. Draco watches as she winds her way through the small tables, her blue dress swinging against her legs. She looks commanding and beautiful. Merlin, he’s missed her.
The question surprises Harry. Most people don’t ask why, they just share their feelings on the matter, as if Harry has nothing better to do than listen to complete strangers drone on about his career options or his love life.
They sit in silence for a few minutes, both sipping their drinks and Draco nibbles on his muffin. Which is delicious. The rich chocolate melts in his mouth and he has to hold back a moan.
“Language!” Molly scolds, swatting at her daughter with a wooden spatula, “Now what is going on?”
Harry smiles for the first time in the last 24 hours and falls back against the bed with a hysterical laugh, because holy shit he really just did that.
“You brew potions all day, it’s literally the same thing,” Harry retorts, adding the onion and once again feeling thankful to Molly Weasley for teaching him the spell that keeps his eyes from burning.
Harry doesn't know when exactly he jumped head first into the rabbit hole that is his feelings for Malfoy, but he’s still waiting to reach the bottom. Free falling and only able to hope that it doesn’t end with him shattering to pieces.
“If you call getting attacked by a werewolf drastic, then yeah. You could say that,” Harry replies simply, shrugging one shoulder as if it means nothing.
Love is reckless. It’s impulsive. Vulnerable.
When Potter collapses against his back, Draco allows it. He lets Potter brush his lips against his neck in a soft kiss, so gentle and more intimate than anything else they’ve just shared. It makes his throat tight, plants little seeds of
“Do I like it?” Draco murmurs almost to himself, “Harry. This is—Do you have any idea how rare these are? Of course, I love it.”
“Ready to go?” Kade asks, smirking at Draco’s obvious ogling. It doesn’t bother Draco in the slightest that he’s been caught admiring his boyfriend. He lets his eyes caress the long lines of Kade’s body, pulling his bottom lip into his mouth the way he knows drives Kade crazy.
Draco gulps in a big breath, silently wishing that he was able to absorb some courage out of thin air. He reminds himself that this is for Harry.
“Neville is technically a professor there and you never specified! Plus he was the only person I could name that wouldn’t give me nightmares when I thought about it later,” Potter says with a sour look on his face, “Just answer the question, Malfoy.”
Draco swallows, takes a step closer. “You’ve sent me something, every single day. Why?”
He tries to keep his eyes from searching out Harry and fails miserably. Draco doesn’t want to think about the disappointment he feels when he doesn’t spot that mop of dark hair anywhere in the sea of red.
One of Potter’s hands cups his hard cock, and the other tangles in his hair. Potter’s eyes are almost black, a blistering heat burning there as he stares at Draco, making him feel seen in a way no one else ever has.
But then Harry’s mouth is gone and a hand is clamping around the base of Draco’s cock. He cries out at the denial and his body moves forward, seeking out what he so desperately needs. But Harry’s free hand comes up to pin him harder to the wall.
When the boy finally clears his throat and speaks, Harry feels guilty for his internal grumblings.
Draco’s mouth parts and his eyes widen, the angry flush that stains his cheeks starts to darken and spread down his neck. Harry wants to know how far down it goes. But he’s not thinking about that right now.
Draco laughs, the sound muffled against Harry’s neck, “I’ve created a monster.”
“Thanks,” Harry says with a grateful smile. It’s a running tradition that Hermione brings Harry chocolate frogs on Valentine’s Day. Harry probably should have expected it.
Ron whistles softly. “I didn’t think it’d been going on that long.”
“Watch it, Malfoy,” Harry warns without looking up from the menu.
people.”
“Sit. Eat your toast and have some tea.”
“Is this really what you want?” Harry finally asks, once Draco’s mostly dressed, and he doesn’t recognise his own voice, “Some sham of a marriage—she’ll never be able to make you happy.”
Draco watches as Harry’s eyes take in the tapestry, the large tree intricately woven with gold yarn, depicting generations of Potters’. The bright green leaves and red-orange sky make it look like a vibrant piece of artwork. Which Draco supposes it is.
“Was that really necessary?” The owl turns its head away from him and ruffles its brown feathers rudely.
They stay pressed close afterwards, allowing their breathing to slow and their heart beats to settle. Harry closes his eyes and tucks his face into Draco’s neck, just hiding there, safe.
“Fine. I’m fine. A little stressed maybe, but having my mother taking up residence in my guest room will do that,” Draco answers, making Andromeda laugh.
So Draco doesn’t let himself worry. He pushes his nerves down and decides to just enjoy his night.
“Hi yourself,” Draco smiles against his lips.
“No, hey. I have no problem with, er that. At all. I swear,” Harry says quickly, “You just surprised me.”
Draco could have ignored this duty. He almost did. But in the end, marrying Astoria seemed like the right thing to do. And while it was in line with his parents wishes, Draco knows that it was his decision. His choice.
“Draco,” his father says as the guard closes the door, “Nice of you to visit. Finally.”
“I think I already am,” Harry says, the sound of his fingers moving in and out of Draco’s slick hole reverberates off the walls in the room, “I am fucking you, Draco. With my mouth. With my fingers. If you want something else, you’ll have to be more specific.”
The kiss isn’t one shared between lovers; rather a fight between life long enemies. Its teeth clashing and lips bitten. Its Potter’s nails, digging in and carving crescent-shaped marks into his skin. Years worth of pent up emotion rushing out of them the only way it knows how.
Draco swallows and meets Hermione’s brown eyes. “I’ve been well. How are you? And Ron? I do hope you got the gift I sent for Rose’s birthday,” Draco says and then quickly drops his eyes back to the table, focusing on adding sugar to his cup of Darjeeling.
This isn’t the common room late at night or a supply closet in-between classes. No one will catch them here. They’re in an unused part of the castle, the door locked. The implications of that; that Potter can torture him, for as long as he wants and with no mercy, makes Draco moan around his cock.
“Spread your legs and bring your knees up some,” Draco rasps against his ear, and goose flesh breaks out all over Harry’s body.
“No, Potter,” Malfoy retorts sarcastically, “However did that slip my mind.”
After Scorpius is fed, his hair brushed, and has been wrestled into his school uniform, they step into the Floo, closer to being on time than they usually are.
“Everything alright?” Harry asks, the concern he’s trying to hide showing plainly in his eyes.
That’s the thing about Draco. Once you chip away all the Malfoyness and get past the defense mechanisms, what you find underneath is a kind, compassionate person. Yes, Draco still has sharp edges, a biting retort always ready to roll off his tongue, but he’s soft in a way Harry never got to see when they were younger.
(See the end of the chapter for
But his legs won’t corporate. Something keeps him standing there, frozen, probably the part of him that knows beyond that door lies comfort. Refuge from the anger and regret. Potter can make all of it fade away to nothing. Like the sun chasing rain clouds out of the sky.
He thinks back to the dream and lets the rest play out behind his eyelids.
Something is wrong here. Malfoy is meant to mock Harry, to call him uncultured and mannerless, he should be pointing out Harry’s lack of parents or calling someone a Mudblood or something. Anything but this stiff politeness.
“Not the same but similar, especially when they’re cut at the beginning of the flowering stage. If they weren’t so rare they would probably be used a lot more commonly,” Neville answers easily, happy to indulge Hermione’s never ending questions.
“Draco, tell me you have not gone and done something as utterly stupid as falling for that idiot Potter,” Lucius demands, his fists straining against the Incarcerous. If his hands were free, Draco bets he’d be on the receiving end of a slap right now.
Potter refuses to let Draco use magic to help with the snowman, and by the time they have it complete, Draco’s arms ache and his fingers are numb. But the boys are pleased, adding Potter’s discarded scarf and a carrot nose to their creation.
Harry revels in the fantasy, his hand stroking faster, hips fucking up into his fist.
“But it’s itchy,” James complains, pulling at the collar of his shirt.
Draco is aware that he needs to say something, but every word he knows seems to have evaporated from his mind.
Well, it’s technically true.
Draco feels like he’s going to spontaneously combust if Harry doesn’t get on with it and fuck him already.
“Would everyone shut the hell up,” Ginny yells and it’s rather effective, the noise dying down a bit. Blaise slings an arm around her slender shoulders and grins.
As for the loud Muggles, the bright flashing lights and the smell of deep-fried food; he wasn’t so sure.
Harry groans miserably, “Yeah but Robards hates me. He’ll probably partner us together out of spite.”
“These. Off. Now.” Harry demands, each word punctuated by an open mouthed kiss on his chest.
Damn right they will, Draco thinks. But now he’s curious. Was that an offhand comment? Something to tease and antagonize Draco with? Or did Potter really tell Granger that he and Draco are friends now?
“Do you have a minute?” she asks, and Draco is quite happy for the interruption.
Harry wants to tell Draco, yes, to all of it. But the words get stuck in his throat. Instead, he catches Draco’s mouth with his.
Draco gratefully accepts the mug that’s offered to him. He takes a sip and groans, his mood already improving as the sweet hazelnut coffee warms his belly.
Draco’s movements are shaky as he climbs up, facing Potter and waiting for his next instruction.
The sight he’s met with when he comes around to the back garden has an involuntary smile spreading across his face. Various Weasley’s are on their brooms tossing a Quaffle back and forth. Molly is levitating trays of food, enough to feed a small army, to a long table that’s set up. They are balls of light floating over the table, making the already mouth watering food look even more delectable. Hundreds of fairy lights are wrapped around the trunks of a number of trees and the fire is already burning brightly, the flames reaching up towards the darkening summer sky.
He looks to be about sixteen and Harry supposes he’s probably doing his back to school shopping for Hogwarts. He doesn’t look the type to start trouble, but Harry’s hand goes to his wand anyway, out of habit.
They make their way into the living room where Harry takes a seat on the sofa and Malfoy drops down beside him, kicking off his shoes and stretching out his long legs. He’s been in Harry’s home a few times now and Harry’s pleased with how relaxed Malfoy seems to be.
“Honestly, Malfoy,” Potter finally says, shrugging a shoulder, “I don’t know why either, but what I do know is I like you. You’re not bad company when you aren’t being an arsehole and I’d like to get to know you better,” Potter holds a hand out, a small smile tilting his lips.
“I thought Sirius Black left the house to you?” Draco asks, mostly to stall but he is curious.
The guard goes to retrieve his father and Draco takes a moment to breathe carefully in and out, counting backwards from ten inside his head. He needs to be in complete control of himself when his father comes in. Lucius Malfoy can identify a weak spot and exploit it in a matter of seconds. Even after years in Azkaban, his mind is still sharp.
“Thank you Kreacher,” Draco says, taking the bundle from him. Kreacher bows and then pops away.
“I apologize, Potter,” Draco says as he fidgets with the lid on his cup, “I just, got in my own head. I thought you possibly had a wildly unusual lapse in judgement and wouldn’t take too kindly to hearing from me again. We’ve never been friends before and I guess I don’t understand why you’d suddenly want to now.”
Draco doesn’t say anything, just watches, his eyes tracking every movement as Harry works himself open. He’s done this enough on his own to know what feels good, knows the right places to rub to send sparks up his spine, and it isn’t long before he’s rocking back onto three fingers, craving more.
“What do you want on the pizza?” he asks Malfoy.
Draco looks up at the cloudy sky that promises rain. “I don’t know. It doesn’t look like the weather is going to cooperate with that plan Potter.”
“Thank you,” Draco says, with as much sincerity as he can, “I love you, you do know that?”
“Shh it’s okay,” Harry soothes. He doesn’t know what to say to make this easier for Draco and a part of himself, a part he hates, doesn’t want to make it any easier for him, “Everything’s gonna be alright, just breathe,” Draco takes in a gulp of air, his breath shuddering out against Harry’s neck, “And I promise to be on my best behavior. I won’t punch him in the face or anything. Swear,” Harry’s words have the intended effect, drawing a snort of laughter out of Draco.
Harry stops, his lips hovering over Draco’s, “I’m gonna kiss you now. If you don’t want me to, you better do something to stop me,” Harry whispers, and Draco’s eyes fly open, a thousand questions swimming in their depths.
“He just doesn’t give up,” Draco mutters, giving the owl’s head a scritch before it flies away.
“Draco—I want. Can we—“ Harry stammers, unable to force the words out through the tightness of his throat.
Draco didn’t mean to say all that, but he can’t take it back. He watches Potter scratch blunt fingernails across the scruff on his jaw. He looks like he’s dissecting Draco’s words, looking for another meaning.
*~~~*
“Hey there,” Draco murmurs, opening the window to let the owl in, “I’ve missed you.”
“Say Voldy sucks eggs,” Blaise instructs while holding the camera up and aiming it at them.
“I was in sixth year,” Harry replies. He realizes what he’s said a moment later and wants to bite off his tongue.
“You can sign the divorce papers,” Draco says, pleased that his voice comes out even. He’ll never admit it but the thought of officially ending things, the finality of it, makes Draco feel like a heavy weight is pressing down on his chest, stealing his breath.
Draco’s hand tightens, twists on the upstroke, and Harry bucks into it. He’s so, so close, can feel it building, taking him impossibly higher. And then—
So Lucius fucking Malfoy is the one to blame for this. That piece of information makes rage burn in Harry’s stomach. He wants to storm into Azkaban and give that snooty bastard a piece of his mind. But that won’t be helpful. Astoria seems to have a plan.
“Potter!”
“Hello father,” Draco greets, standing from the table.
. . .
Harry hauls him to his feet and then his hand is wrapping around Draco’s still hard cock, pumping up and down, squeezing lightly and twisting on the upstroke. Just how Draco likes. It only takes a few minutes and Harry’s lips against his neck and then Draco is coming too.
Draco follows Harry into the house, feeling jittery with nerves and out of place.
Harry tries desperately to come up with a plan that will result in the end of this ridiculous situation. Because if Harry knows anything, it’s that he is not equipped to deal with polite Malfoy’s so early on a Monday morning.
“Yeah?”
He strokes firmly from root to tip, gathering pre-come on his fingers to ease the slide. “Yes,” Draco hisses, his head tipping further back and Harry brings his free hand up to Draco’s throat.
He leans forward, pressing one more kiss to Draco’s mouth, before starting to sink down. The head of Draco’s cock pops inside, and Harry’s body burns at the feeling. Its a pulsing ache, just this side of painful, and it makes everything tilt out of focus for a second. He has to take a moment to steady himself, biting hard at his bottom lip. He can hear Draco’s breathing hitch and stutter, and Harry looks down to find him clenching the sheets in his hands so hard his knuckles are turning white, eyes squeezed shut and head thrown back on the pillows.
Harry tries to communicate this with his eyes, silently urging Malfoy to take what he wants.
Harry lifts his head, dislodging Draco’s fingers. He stands and Draco worries he’s said the wrong thing, that Harry doesn’t understand. But Harry just straddles his lap and cups Draco’s face in his calloused hands.
Instead of answering, Harry stands from the table and lifts his t-shirt. Draco gasps when he sees Harry’s left side. Three claw marks, vivid red, start at his hip and run the whole way up to just below his armpit. Draco brings a hand up to cover his mouth as Harry turns and reveals the bite mark on his back. Draco stares. He wants to demand answers, he wants to say so many things but he has no words.
“Hey, hey, shh. You alright?” Harry asks, his lips brushing Draco’s ear as he speaks.
“You- when.. What?” Draco demands, the ability to speak in full sentences deserting him.
Draco stalks off, cursing himself. He should have known better.
“What do you want me to say?” Draco finally looks up and meets his gaze, and Harry’s heart stutters in his chest as he takes in the dark circles beneath Draco’s eyes and the way the normally striking grey irises are dull and flat. “I have a responsibility and I can’t ignore it any longer.”
Harry doesn’t think he’s ever been more sure of anything in his entire life, “Yeah, I’m sure. Please.”
“Happy Valentine’s Day, Malfoy.”
Draco looks up through his lashes, meeting Potter’s eyes boldly as he snaps the elastic band of Potter’s boxer briefs against his arse. The sound echoes around the room and is only drowned out by Potter’s moan as he unceremoniously shoves his prick down Draco’s throat.
Adrenaline is pumping through his body, making his heartbeat pound in his ears and his hands shake throughout the entire process of signing out and retrieving his wand. Draco’s swinging quickly from anger at his father to self loathing and then back again.
When Draco steps out of the fireplace he expects to find Potter sprawled on the sofa, wearing joggers and a ratty shirt, and looking too good because of it. But the living room is empty.
“Of course—but we were talking hypothetically back then,” Draco points out, clutching the heavy parchment like a life line.
Harry’s party is a much bigger affair than Draco’s own was—loud and rowdy and honestly a bit overwhelming. But Draco expected nothing less.
Harry jolts awake, ripped suddenly from sleep and shoved back to reality. He’s in bed, alone, the blankets twisted around his legs. His shirt is sticking to his skin uncomfortably, sweat soaking through the fabric.
With the smallest effort, Harry hoists Draco up, those long legs wrapping around his waist. Draco rolls his hips, rutting his half-hard cock against Harry’s and it’s so,
“So,” Draco says. He wraps his hands around the mug, not really sure how to begin.
Draco grumbles but allows it, and a moment later he feels a cleaning charm wash over him. The bed dips as Harry settles back down beside him and then he’s being pulled into Harry’s arms, already drifting to sleep.
Draco’s heart stops. He doesn’t know if he’ll ever forgive himself for hurting Harry but he’ll reassure him every damn day for the rest of his life if that’s what it takes.
“Has he been going here since the start of the term?” Harry asks, still reeling from the shock of this whole experience and positive that he would have noticed Malfoy at some point over the last two months.
Harry’s teeth pull at Draco’s skin and Draco knows he’ll be covered in marks in the morning. The thought causes his heart to beat wildly in his chest and a moan escapes his throat. Draco rolls his hips against Harry’s, the friction setting his blood on fire. Harry kisses the trail of blond hair leading down from his belly button, stopping suddenly, his lips hovering just inches above Draco’s straining erection. Harry flicks his eyes up and the hungry, pleading look in them nearly makes Draco come untouched.
for him. Most people probably assume he relies on his house elf for everything. But he and Astoria both agree that they want Scorpius to be raised and cared for by them. They share the parenting duties equally, working together as a team, and even though it’s not a marriage built on romantic love, Draco is still grateful to have a partner so well suited to him. He already has more than he deserves, there’s no reason to want for more.
It’s like being consumed by fire; flames lick up his arms, across his chest, down to the tips of his toes. It’s exactly what the itch underneath his skin has been screaming for. Harry breaks away with a gasp and tucks his face into Draco’s neck, inhaling deeply. He smiles as his nose fills with the scent of ink and leather and something sweet that’s undefinable but uniquely
But, no matter how hard he tries, Harry can’t fall back asleep for a long time.
Harry looks down at the worn surface of the table, rubbing his finger over a crack in the wood.
“You’ll what Draco? Be gone for good this time?” Hermione demands fuming. Her outburst catches the attention of the other diners and the waitress, who is leaning on the counter watching them intently.
“Thank Salazar,” Draco replies, standing up and allowing his wife to fuss over him just a little more before he turns to eye himself in the full length mirror.
Stomach flipping, Draco quietly sets his fork down on his almost empty plate and walks over to the sink where Kade stands, waving his wand to send the clean dishes to their rightful places. Draco wraps his arms around Kade’s waist from behind, kissing the soft skin of his neck. Kade covers Draco’s hands with his own, lacing their fingers together where they rest against his stomach and laughs fondly at the open and unprompted display of affection.
“Not yet,” Harry says, voice rough, his throat probably sore from the fucking it just endured.
Harry vaguely registers the sound of plates being knocked to the floor, their forgotten dinner spilling and probably staining the carpet. But Harry can’t find it in himself to care much, with Draco hovering above him, trailing kisses down the side of his throat.
Potter comes with a gutted out sound, his movements going erratic and then slowing as he shudders through the aftershocks.
Malfoy looks startled for just a moment before his face smoothes out and Harry’s treated to another genuine smile.
“Sirius’ were the same too,” Harry offers, and Andromeda nods.
“You really liked it?” Harry asks again, his voice uncertain.
Draco works one more finger in before he finally relents. Harry vaguely hears the slick sound of Draco stroking himself, feels the blunt pressure of Draco’s cock against him, and then finally,
He whines, arches his back and Potter knows what he needs. He always knows.
good one. Amazing really,” Harry whispers against his lips and Draco breathes a sigh of relief.
“No, no. We have to go pick up Rose. I’ll talk to you tomorrow,” Hermione grabs Ron by his arm and drags him towards the fireplace, “It was nice seeing you, Draco.”
Potter smiles and god, Draco is getting too used to those smiles, “No problem, Malfoy.”
“Because I bought the tickets that let us ride all the rides as many times as we want. You have to wear this wrist band,” Harry answers, excitement glowing in his green eyes.
“Oh come on, Draco,” Astoria says with a roll of her eyes, “All the coffee dates and the movies and he’s here all the time. You two act like you’re attached at the hip. I think you should kiss him and just get on with it already.”
“You what?” Hermione demands, her eyes wide.
“You could’ve Flooed,” Harry says, watching as Malfoy brushes the snow from his hair.
They all take their shots and then the conversation continues to flow easily, more easily than Draco could have ever imagined. These people have no reason to make him feel welcome, yet they are.
Draco pulls out and scoots back, giving Harry room to flip over. Then he takes Harry’s legs and hooks them over his arms, before he lines back up and pushes inside once more.
. . .
He doesn’t think about what will happen after this, doesn’t think about the pain and the heartbreak he knows he’ll suffer. Instead, he thinks about how whole and complete he feels, buried deep inside Draco. He thinks about how much he loves him, how much better and brighter his life has become since Draco came along and filled in all the empty spaces.
Still, it feels extra important that Harry makes today special. He wants to drive all the worry and anxious thoughts out of Draco’s head.
“Yeah, she knows that we’re friends,” Potter answers, and Draco still can’t get over how easily he says it.
“Fuck, you feel so good. Always feel so good inside me,” Draco whimpers, his hands coming to rest at Harry’s sides. Harry looks down to where Draco is holding tightly to him, his fingers curled possessively around Harry’s ribs, his nails biting into the sensitive skin there.
“Is this you trying to do something nice again?” Draco questions, a pointed look on his face.
“Yours,” Draco agrees, and Harry pushes inside.
Tormenting Harry Potter has always been one of Draco’s favorite things, just because they’re together now doesn’t mean he’ll stop. He grins at the broken off whine that leaves Harry’s lips and lifts his head.
“Your precious Auror duties and hero complex not keeping you busy enough?” Draco asks snidely, causing Harry to look at him sharply.
Harry nods and quickly obeys, gripping the pillow above his head, knuckles turning white as he holds on tightly.
Malfoy does, and Harry can feel Malfoy’s heart speed up from where their chests are pressed together. Harry slips two fingers inside, resting them on Malfoy’s tongue.
Malfoy is smart and kind and a good dad. He matches Harry’s quick wit and sarcasm with his own brand of snarky comebacks. He challenges Harry, bringing out his competitive nature, but it’s nothing like the rivalry they had in the past. They’re friends now.
“Stand up and bend over,” Potter says, and while he might look unaffected to someone else, Draco doesn’t miss the way that his eyes have dilated, the way his fists clench at his sides as he waits for Draco to move into position, the way he lets out a low, rumbling moan when Draco is bent over and spread open in front of him.
Malfoy, who takes Harry’s reaction as one of disapproval, immediately closes himself off. The shutters slam down, wiping every bit of openness from his face.
In a fit of spontaneous clarity, Harry grabs his wand. He tries not to focus too much on the fact that it takes him three tries before he’s able to cast his Patronus, but once the stag stands before him, he knows exactly what he wants to do.
told Astoria we would,” Harry replies, flicking his wand to send the dishes to their designated cupboards, before pulling Draco into a kiss that tastes like syrup and coffee and cinnamon, “Anyways it’ll be fine. We just have to get their school uniforms, how hard can it be?”
“Maybe I don’t want fucked tonight.”
“You know what, fine. Run off back to New York Draco. Marry some guy you’ve known a year instead of staying here and trying to fix things with the man who has never given up on you. Did you know he came after you Draco? Did you know that he refuses to move on at all?”
“I never signed them,” Draco says simply. Harry’s eyes snap up, full of questions and something Draco thinks might be hope, “I tried to. I put quill to parchment at least a dozen times but I couldn’t do it,” Draco swallows nervously, meeting Harry’s eyes with an unwavering gaze, “I can’t walk away again. I still love you. I’ve always loved you, even when I hated you, and I’m pretty sure I’m gonna love you forever.”
“You buy me coffee every morning, Potter. Say thank you, shut up, and drink it,” Malfoy orders with an eye roll.
He always sleeps peacefully in Potter’s bed. There are no nightmares, no waking up in a cold sweat reaching for his wand to defend himself against some unknown enemy. Harry sleeps on the side of the bed closest to the door, and it makes Draco feel safe somehow. Protected. Settles some deep buried fear that Draco always carries with him. That fear, Draco knows, is probably a result of the year spent with Voldemort roaming the halls of his childhood home. But it’s washed away when he has Harry’s warm body next to him, his arms possessively wrapped around Draco, his breaths deep and even.
Harry feels Draco shift around, and then his mouth is kissing the dimples at the base of Harry’s back, continuing up a moment later to drag over every bump and divot of his spine.
Narcissa steps closer to Harry, her aromatic perfume invading his nose as she threads her arm through his delicately. They set off onto the dirt pathway that winds through the grounds of the Manor, Harry only looking back to Draco once, before he puts his mind to the task of finding out just how mad Narcissa is over this whole mess.
Draco could give in, and god does he want to, but he knows that once he gets Harry into bed he intends to keep him there for a long time.
With another sharp flick of his wand, the dishes from his abandoned breakfast fly across the room and smash into the wall. The cupboards swing open and then slam closed a second later in a series of loud bangs. His raging magic flows out of the room and through his flat; bookcases are knocked over, picture frames fall to the floor and the lights flicker wildly. Anger pulses through his body in violent waves, but underneath he can feel his heart breaking.
He resists the urge to wrap his hand around Draco and start stroking, and instead slides his fingers up under Draco’s shirt and across his stomach, petting gently and feeling the muscles jump in response. His other hand moves lower, cupping Draco’s balls and tugging.
“You’re cheating!” Draco grumbles loudly.
Harry laughs, pulling back to look at Draco, “Yeah, that was a surprise.”
The whole idea of it is just absurd. Yes, there might be a small part of Draco that wants more than just stupidly good sex with Potter, but he knows it could never work out between them. He would rather just enjoy what they have, for as long as it lasts. Because Draco isn’t stupid, he knows this will eventually end.
—” Harry gasps out, when the movement causes Draco’s cock to brush against his prostate and send electric shocks across his skin.
Draco sighs, “Yeah, I just—“ Draco stands and stretches, his muscles tight from sitting for so long in one position, “I was just thinking.”
“There?” Draco asks, thrusting up, slow and deep.
Draco thinks something stronger than tea is probably required but he keeps his opinion to himself.
“Why now?” Harry asks, watching Draco closely.
After a moment Harry clears his throat and lets his shirt drop.
Draco stops walking and pulls Harry against him, deepening the kiss and slipping his tongue easily into Harry’s warm mouth, giving exactly zero fucks about the show they’re putting on for anyone looking.
Draco turns away and forces his legs to carry him back out the door and into the chilly evening air.
The rest of the night is lost in a haze of heated touches and sweet words murmured against warm skin. Draco is drunk off the feeling of being in love, pressing against Harry, demanding harder and closer and more.
Instead, he quickly drops Malfoy’s hand and rubs at the back of his neck to keep his traitorous fingers occupied.
All too soon Draco starts to crest the edge, his body oversensitive and muscles tense.
“It’s Granger-Weasley now, but you can just call me Hermione.”
Dream Malfoy must understand because in the next moment he takes Harry’s wrists in each of his hands, pinning them to the back of the sofa, pushing them down until Harry can feel the strength of grip. Until he can feel the magic crackling right beneath those pale fingers.
The sound of Malfoy shuffling around downstairs snaps Harry out of his thoughts before he can examine the feeling too closely.
“Why, because you’re already married? Or because you’re in love with Harry Potter?” Kade asks, his tone going cold as ice, "But I guess that's the same thing huh?"
Potter meets his eyes, searching for something there, before he picks up his wand and twirls it in his fingers. “Maybe. But you won’t tell me no.”
Potter laughs and then they’re twisting away from the sidewalk, landing in a secluded alley somewhere in London a moment later. Potter leads him out of the alley and down the street, their shoulders brushing as they walk.
Harry chases and catches and chases some more. Finally, embarrassingly out of breath, Harry waves James off telling him it’s time for a break, and makes his way back across the park towards Malfoy.
Draco whines, a hand reaching weakly for Harry as his weight suddenly disappears.
“Potter—“
in a broken whisper, that Harry finally adds another finger. Draco is so tight around him, his body pulling Harry in deeper and deeper with each thrust of his fingers. He rubs over Draco’s prostate, making him cry out and arch up from the bed. There’s a sheen of sweat covering Draco’s body, his mouth parted in pleasure, grey eyes sparking bright. And Harry has to be inside him, now.
His mother brought a hand up to her chest as she inhaled sharply. “I will not have you speaking to me that way, Draco.”
“What are your plans for the day?” Harry questions, handing the last pan over.
“Unless you’re planning to kick me out,” Astoria says with a laugh, and relief rushes through him, “Once the boys are older and off at Hogwarts for most of the year, I assume the living arrangements will change. But for now I’m quite happy with the way things are.”
Blaise has given him copies of all the photos that he’d taken at the party, but Draco just can’t seem to stop looking at this one. He looks at it first thing in the morning before his feet even touch the floor. He looks at when he’s stressed throughout the day, when he needs something to lift his spirits. He looks at it before pulling the covers over himself and drifting off to sleep every night.
Well, not get him back exactly, because as much as Harry wants it, Draco was never his to begin with. He has no claim on Draco, no matter how badly he wishes things were different.
If someone doesn’t touch his cock soon, he’s going to lose his mind. He doesn’t care if it’s Malfoy or his own hand, he just needs more. He’s been teetering on the edge since Malfoy straddled him and he can’t wait any longer. Harry’s ready to jump off the cliff and fall to the sea of pleasure below.
Draco sits on the sofa, knees drawn up to his chest as silent tears slide down his face. A bouquet of beautiful red roses sit on the coffee table next to some parchment and a quill.
“You love it,” Draco whispers, but Harry doesn’t think he has any idea how true that statement is.
Astoria waits until he has finished and cleaned his hands before saying, “I have something for you,” her tone cautious.
“I’m trying,” Harry finally says, “I’m trying to live for myself, trying to not care what other people think but it’s never been easy for me. I don’t think it ever will be.”
It’s just the same as he remembers; crooked, overgrown and shabby but radiating warmth and loving energy.
But here it is, solid evidence of their newfound friendship, right in the palm of his hand.
“Present later, sex now,” Harry retorts, his nimble fingers reaching for the button on Draco’s jeans.
The simple truth of it is, Harry loves Draco, and there’s no one else in the world he would rather go through all the ups and downs of life with.
He does pull back, the reason being more that he needs to drag some air into his lungs, and less that he has any intention of stopping or slowing down.
Of course, Harry also knows that it would have been a disaster if they had started a relationship when they were younger. They hadn’t been ready then; both of them too damaged and stubborn. They would have ruined it before it ever had a chance to turn into something even half as wonderful as what they have now.
Harry drifts easily back to sleep, Draco a warm, comforting weight against him.
Right. Draco’s birthday. That’s what he needs to focus on, it’s the whole point to this outing after all.
Malfoy is looking down at him with a soft look of affection on his face. Then the corner of those full lips twitch up and there’s that smirk. It’s mischievous but Harry isn’t worried. He has nothing to fear. Whether awake or asleep, Harry trusts him. He knows he’ll let Malfoy do whatever he likes, surrender himself to it.
Malfoy’s pulse flutters wildly against the place where Harry’s fingers rest on the side of his neck. Harry waits a beat, then relaxes his grip, smiling when Malfoy blinks up at him with wide eyes.
“You can do this. You are Draco Malfoy and you will take no shit from Harry sodding Potter.”
And then he’s spinning away.
“Huh. He never said,” Kade replies, understanding dawning in his brown eyes.
“I’ll wear that ghastly Gryffindor scarf,” Draco answers, trying to seem disgusted by the idea, when really, he can’t think of anything better than wrapping himself up in that scarf, warmed from Potter’s skin and smelling spicy, sweet just like the man himself does.
Their friendship has solidified over the last month, between play dates and coffee, Malfoy has become someone that Harry wants to keep in his life for the long haul. Harry has trouble remembering what his life was like without Malfoy in it. And that’s what scares him.
“That was my decision to make, not yours. All I needed was you Draco. Nothing else mattered, nothing people said could touch me if I had you standing beside me.”
Anyways, that's it...at least for now. I do plan to continue this series at some point, so I hope everyone sticks around to see where this story goes next <3
Yes, Harry is aware that he has a tendency to be a little...
Sunday dinner has become one of Draco’s favorite things. Lately, he has even found himself looking forward to going to the cosy, crooked house—eating the most delicious food he’s ever tasted and watching fondly as Scorpius runs through the overgrown garden with the other children.
One quickly becomes two and Draco removes his mouth, stretching Harry with just his fingers. He kisses all the skin within his reach, and when Draco grazes his prostate, Harry feels like his nerve endings are sizzling—sparking and igniting. It’s all
“Thank you, Malfoy,” Harry says sweetly, batting his eyelashes.
He slides his fingers out gently, then slicks his cock, watching as Draco pulls his knees up and back. He leans over Draco and kisses him urgently—tongues twisting and teeth clashing together —as he lines up and pushes forward, barely meeting any resistance before his cock breaches Draco’s body.
It’s been a shit day. A shit week actually. It turns out, Auror training isn’t as fun or rewarding as Harry built it up to be in his head. Robards has been insufferable, and what’s worse, is that he partnered Harry with Zacharias Smith—who is somehow even more of a prick than he was in school.
“If I do something you don’t like—or if you change your mind, at any point, all you have to do is say stop. And I’ll stop,” Draco says with such conviction that any nervousness Harry feels starts to fade away to nothing.
Harry is lonely and bored and maybe just a little bit drunk and that has to be why he can’t stop thinking about Malfoy.
Harry’s eyes snap to Draco. He sighs as he recognizes the pleading look in those grey-blue eyes. And though Harry’s terrified to let Draco out of his sight, he knows he won’t deny Draco anything he needs. Even if what he needs is to be left alone with the man who just had his hands all over him.
Harry’s not sure how long they stay like that, just touching and kissing. Draco’s skin is warm, his lips smiling and eyes soft, and Harry thinks--
Please forgive me for my over use of commas as well as any other mistakes. This is very much unbeta’d and a work in progress. At the moment I have 8 chapters ready to go and I’m planning (fingers crossed) on trying to post one chapter a week but no promises.
Harry knows he’ll pay for that later but when he hears Draco’s shocked shriek and then howls of laughter from the boys, he can’t say he really cares.
“Yes.” The answer comes, breathless and without hesitation. “Potter, I—“
, did you just say you love me?” Draco asks, frozen to the spot, struggling to get the words unstuck and briefly considering the possibility that his hearing was somehow damaged from all the spinning in circles.
“Can I stay with you tonight?” Draco asks without turning around, his voice is quiet, unsure, like he thinks Harry might say no. Which is ridiculous, because Harry would have Draco in his bed every night if he could get away with it.
The universe seems to be on his side, because he inches ahead, winning by only a few seconds.
“Obviously,” Lucius answers, and Draco thinks with his fathers skewed worldview he probably truly believes that he would be. Lucius has never been one to acknowledge his own flaws or take responsibility for his actions.
Maybe they can just skip the date. Draco would be happy with dragging Harry back to his room and locking them inside for the night.
Draco’s hard, and if the impressive bulge straining the front of Harry’s jeans is any indication, he is too. Draco rolls his hips tentatively, his tongue moving inside Harry’s mouth. His ears ring at the sound Harry makes, at the way it vibrates through him, spreading down his body to the tips of his toes. So, Draco does it again, pressing forward harder and closer this time.
“If I get this is on one try—you have to suck my dick,” Harry whispers the words, his face burning bright red but he doesn’t look away, keeping his eyes locked on Draco’s.
“Draco—oh fuck, Draco. I’m gonna—“ Harry warns and Draco redoubles his efforts.
Draco registers the tingle of a cleaning charm and then nothing but the feeling of Harry’s warm tongue dragging roughly back and forth across his opening. Harry alternates between fast, probing licks and slow, gentle caresses. After a few minutes, Draco’s loose enough for Harry to work his tongue past the tight ring of muscle and inside. A slick finger joins Harry’s tongue and Draco moans, writhing on the bed as he rolls his arse back against Harry, needing more.
Potter seems surprised by this, a look Draco can’t quite interpret clouding his face.
Draco shivers at the command and stretches out on his back. He lets his legs dangle off the edge, the wood desk hard and uncomfortable beneath him. Potter steps closer, roughly parting Draco’s legs and sucking his cock down without preamble.
Draco swallows loudly, closing his eyes and leaning against Harry before answering, “I’m fine. As long as you’re here, I’ll be fine.”
. . .
inside his brain, makes him want more.
Harry doubts that very much.
! Harry, please.” Draco’s hands come up to grip Harry’s shoulders for support.
“Yes, and your dad is still sleeping. Why don’t you all go and wake him up while I finish this,” Harry suggests with a smirk, “You may have to really jump on him!” He yells after them as they rush up the stairs.
The next afternoon Harry goes to the Manor, thankful that Neville okay-ed taking Draco’s present through the Floo.
But when he opens his mouth what he says is, “Sure. Coffee sounds good.”
“A few months after you left,” Harry says quietly, grabbing Draco’s hand, rubbing a thumb over his knuckles, “C’mon.”
“Right,” Draco replies, relief and anxiety battle for space inside his chest but he gives Harry a small smile and leans forwards, nuzzling into the crook of Harry’s neck, “I love you so fucking much.”
“I said that he won’t listen
Draco frowns. “I do not.”
“Thank you,” Draco steals a kiss, just a quick press of lips, before looking at Harry with narrowed eyes, “Where’s my present?”
The thought of facing a hoard of Weasley’s as well as Harry already has Draco’s nerves on edge but there’s no point in entertaining thoughts of not going. One simply does not go against the wishes of Molly Weasley.
Draco waits, counting the seconds in his head. When he gets to 200 he stands and walks casually in the direction Harry went.
The next morning, Draco is back in the greenhouse. He finished his work a while ago but stays sitting at his work table, enveloped in warmth, letting his thoughts drift.
“Well,” Molly glances between them with a knowing look in her eye, “I have more desserts to bring out, but I better see a plate in your hand when I come back, Harry,” she says, pointing a finger at him.
“I haven’t signed. I mean, it would be amazing, but the training schedule is brutal. I’d probably have to move and…” Harry trails off with a shrug.
But Harry catches his wrists, pinning them against the bed, trapping him there. “It does matter,” he says, face serious. Then his mouth is on Draco’s, and everything else falls away until it’s just warm skin and desperate kisses.
Hermione picks up the thread of their conversation easily, as if she hasn’t just interrupted it to wandlessly cast a spell she invented. Draco wonders if she realizes just how brilliant she is.
Draco has a bad feeling about what exactly Hermione needs to say to him that requires them speaking privately.
“It doesn’t matter,” he says, looking over and giving Astoria a tight smile. It really doesn’t matter. There’s no point in pursuing a friendship with Harry Potter. Maybe they’ll get the kids together a few more times, maybe they’ll start to learn more about one another as just Draco and Harry, not Malfoy and Potter. But Draco knows it won’t last. Eventually, Potter will remember who Draco is, he’ll remember the things Draco has done, and that will be the death of anything they manage to grow between them, “I have to get this Valerian Root cut, so please just tell me whatever it is you came in here to tell me.”
Draco’s impression of Harry is terrible and has them both laughing again. They calm down after a few minutes, and Harry grabs the shower gel from the shelf and rubs soapy hands over Draco’s back. He moves around to Draco’s chest, then down both arms to link their fingers together.
Draco
“I always knew that Granger was strange,” Malfoy says, shifting around beside Harry.
The swings look like broomsticks and not only swing forward and backward but dip up and down too. A green dragon lowers its scaly tail to the ground, allowing the children to climb up easily and slide down off its snout. The sandbox is piled high with multicolored enchanted sand that sparkles in the afternoon sun and easily moulds into whatever shape the children desire.
I'm so sorry this update took me so long!! Real life got in the way big time the last few weeks but I’m back :) and I hope you guys enjoy <3
Draco hesitates slightly before turning the door knob and stepping into the room. He stands frozen, only for a moment, as his eyes flicker around. And then he’s moving across the room, stopping to examine the pictures and knickknacks scattered around. The room is full of reminders of what they had, tokens from all the places and things they experienced together. When Draco picks up the green jumper that’s folded carefully over the back of the chair and raises a questioning eyebrow, Harry feels his face heat.
Draco’s eyes drift to the scars on Harry’s side. His fingers tighten on Harry’s hips as he places kiss after soft kiss against the marred skin. Harry stands still and lets Draco cover as much of the scars as he can reach before roughly pulling him to his feet and crashing their mouths together.
Part of Harry wants to be angry with Draco, wants to tap into that old hatred, to just move on with his life and forget all about the last six months. But he can’t.
Alright, so maybe it does have something to do with a certain blonde git.
Definitely not what Draco was expecting.
Harry presses him down, pinning his wrists to the bed as he pounds into him as hard as he can. Draco matches his pace, rocking up to meet each deep thrust, shaking and gasping every time. Draco babbles, an endless litany of demands. He begs and pleads, and Harry gives into every request. Harry goes harder, faster, holds Draco tighter. Sweat is dripping down his face, burning his eyes, but he keeps them open, watching with reverence as Draco starts to come apart beneath him.
Draco is only able to let out a sigh of relief before Harry’s lips are on his, the kiss more sweet and gentle than any they’ve ever shared before.
This had been his home for four years, his sanctuary after the war. After everything, it still feels more like home than the Manor ever did. Draco swallows around the lump of emotion that seems to be lodged in his throat and arranges his face into a blank expression. He raises an only slightly shaking hand and knocks loudly against the door.
“No, I suppose not. Although I was hoping it went well. You two are long over due for a conversation,” Harry snorts and Hermione glares at him, “This mess needs sorted Harry and you know it.”
He lands in the kitchen of Grimmuald Place and inhales deeply through his nose. He can immediately tell that Draco is no longer there. As he makes his way through the big empty house, the loneliness that he constantly carries with him presses down, threatening to suffocate him.
Draco snatches the package up before the sauce can start to soak in. He shoots a glare towards the menace of an owl, who is now perched on his countertop.
Hermione laughs and stands. “Flattery will get you breakfast, if you feel like getting your lazy arse out of bed that is.”
Draco reaches out and pushes Harry’s messy curls back from his forehead gently, not wanting to wake him when he looks so young and untroubled in his sleep. But Harry stirs against him at the touch, pressing a kiss to Draco’s shoulder before he even opens his eyes.
Or Draco’s strange fascination with Muggle souvenirs. Harry still has an entire shelf full of shot glasses he’ll never use.
Then, later that evening, they’re in the sitting room. His mother and Astoria have magazines and photographs spread over the coffee table, the witches and wizards in them happy and celebrating on their wedding days. He’s been zoned out of the conversation for a while now, but he thinks they’re talking about seating arrangements. Draco is here, a silent bystander, while a life he doesn’t want is planned around him.
Draco makes a needy noise, voice pitched low as he begs, “Please.”
And then Potter starts to fuck his face, slow and deep, seeming content to take his time.
“Are you sure we have to go?” Draco asks, arousal starting to course through his body, “We could just stay here and I can undress you with my teeth.”
“I’m in love with Draco Malfoy,” Harry whispers, and it’s the first time he’s said the words out loud. It’s freeing, cathartic in a way, to finally admit what he’s been keeping locked inside for so long.
He knows what he has to do. But it doesn’t make it hurt any less.
--and Draco comes. His release splatters the wall in front of him and he has to brace himself against the intensity of it.
Harry meets his eyes then, his mouth parting slightly, clearly about to say something that will do terrible things to Draco’s heart. And fuck if Draco can’t feel his defenses slipping already.
Kade hesitates, his eye’s searching Draco’s face.
Draco winds his way through the crowded shop, finding a small table in the corner near the window. Draco sits and watches the people pass by on the sidewalk outside, firmly keeping his eyes away from where Potter stands across the room.
“It’s complicated,” Malfoy sighs, a weary expression clouding his face, “Maybe one day I’ll tell you.”
He takes one look at Harry and then drops his eyes to floor. “I take it you’ve seen the paper.”
Harry can’t quite believe his friend is taking this so well. “And you don’t care? I mean, it’s Malfoy. I know how you feel about him.”
He slowly makes his way upstairs and into the bedroom, going straight into the en suite to open the warded cabinet above the sink. He glares at the rows of potions bottles before grabbing one. He carries it back into the bedroom where he sits on the edge of his bed and stares down at it with true hatred.
“Her cooking is even better than I remember,” Draco finally says, taking pity on him.
“What?” Draco chokes out. He will have to murder Potter if he speaks a word of any of this to anyone.
Draco feels Potter move closer, slicking his cock, his knuckles brushing against Draco’s arse.
Astoria walks over, smiling, “Yes, I can see that Draco,” she says, prying the bottle from his hands and asking Fipsy to fill some glasses.
“Fine,” Draco rasps before clearing his throat, “That’s fine, I don’t mind. Where are we going anyways?”
“Alright?” Draco asks, voice strained, his body trembling against Harry’s.
“Hey little man.” Draco lifts Teddy up, grinning when the boys hair changes from blue to blonde.
It’s later, after he’s gone home for the night, that the full weight of everything that happened today finally hits him.
“I’m sure. Please.”
Harry laughs. “Okay, bath it is.”
Harry smiles and lifts Draco’s arm to his lips. Starting at Draco’s wrist, Harry places kiss after kiss up the entirety of the tattoo.
“You know,” Draco’s lips are stained red from the strawberries and Harry can feel the beginnings of arousal starting to course through his veins again, “You really outdid yourself. How are you ever going to top it for my birthday next year?”
Malfoy looks at Harry’s hand first then at his face, hesitating slightly before gripping Harry’s hand hard and pumping his arm a few times.
While it certainly wouldn’t be the first time Harry was confronted with an upset Draco Malfoy and preceded to fuck it up beyond repair, the logical part of his brain knows that this is classic Draco. Lashing out and pushing him away.
Draco can’t believe his fingers are wrapped around Harry’s hard cock. He can’t believe that he’s the one that has Harry slowly shaking apart. Can’t believe the ease with which their lips keep meeting in urgent kisses, the way Harry grips his shoulder so hard his pale skin is sure to bruise.
He doesn’t know that Potter sends a quiet plea out into the universe, offering to do whatever it takes, to make Draco his.
They’ve been taking things slowly though, enjoying intense make out sessions that more often than not end in frantic hand jobs, neither of them angling for more. Both satisfied with this level of physical closeness, and content in knowing they have all the time in the world to learn each other at their own pace.
“You’re sorry,” Kade says flatly, “Draco, do you have any idea how crazy with worry I’ve been? You don’t show up with your Portkey, you don’t answer my calls. Jesus. You lied about everything. Was any of it real?”
Time creeps by slowly in the seconds before their lips meet, the tension between them building higher and higher. Then suddenly, all the choices that led here, to this moment, finally converge and explode.
Harry has stepped closer now, his fingers trailing, almost reverently, over the branches where his parents names are woven. His mouth is parted in shock and Draco can hear his breaths coming faster.
Draco breathes in deeply, tries to calm his racing heart, and affects a cool tone, “Charming as that is, Potter, I’d like to get cleaned up and go back to the dorms.”
“Alright. I should get going then but Harry? If you need anything let me or Ron know.”
“Harry?” she asks softly.
Over the years, Harry had come to know all of Draco’s strange little quirks. Like his habit of sitting on any and all elevated surfaces. The kitchen table and countertops, Harry’s desk in the study, and even the wet bar in the sitting room were just some of the places Harry would find Draco perched, one leg tucked under his arse and the other leg swinging, while he read or listened to the wireless.
“Robards, I’m not coming in today. Or any day for that matter. I quit.”
“Your cock, Harry,” Draco stutters out, “Fuck me with your cock.”
Draco’s led down a hall and into a room, designated by a small sign as Visitation Room 4. He goes in and takes a seat at the table, the only piece of furniture inside. The paint is peeling from the walls, little flakes chipping off and falling to the floor, which doesn’t look like it’s been cleaned in decades.
Harry snorts, and Hermione looks at him with one eyebrow raised in question. “No, actually I don’t. I quit.”
. . .
Draco stomps through Potter’s flat toward the kitchen, intending to dig up some parchment and leave Potter a rude note to find when he gets home. Draco stops in his tracks however, when he enters the room and finds Potter sitting calmly at the kitchen table, just the hint of a smirk on his face.
“So this—thing,” Harry says, indicating the small sapling that’s sitting in front of him on the work table, “will turn into that?” Harry points to the tree in the corner, its branches curvy and thick, a few reddish orange flowers starting to bloom towards the top.
Fair warning though, this is still pretty angsty, but things will start getting better soon and there will absolutely be a happy ending!
They rock against each other, the pace turning frantic and desperate. Draco pins Harry to the wall, catches a wrist in each hand and chases that delicious friction until he’s crazy with it, until Draco’s about to come in his pants like a fucking teenager and he doesn’t even care.
After Draco left, Harry stayed frozen on the floor, curled in on himself as the tears streamed down his face. He doesn’t know how long it took, but eventually his eyes ran dry and he was able to stand. He took one look around at his bedroom, his ears ringing with how quiet it was, and he knew he had to get out of there.
“Of course it was real. Kade I…I never meant for you to find out like this, I was going to tell you everything the minute I got back to New York, I swear. But then…” Draco’s eyes sting but he doesn’t doubt his decision. He knows he belongs here.
Malfoy stays at Harry’s house until late, not Flooing home until well after midnight. Harry trudges up the stairs to his bedroom, quickly stripping out of his clothes and crashing into bed.
“Are you sure? I haven’t ever...” Harry says, as if Draco doesn’t already know this.
“We’re going to Apparate, I’ll side-along you.”
But because of ten precious minutes he’s here, his fingers tracing patterns on the soft skin of Draco’s back.
“You moved rooms,” Draco says, his eyes drifting from Harry’s to take in the details of the bedroom.
“I miss him,” Harry admits, his face immediately flushing with heat. He swallows thickly and forces the words out, “I don’t want to lose him, Astoria.”
Astoria eyes him shrewdly, her face calculating. Finally she drops her gaze to the gold watch that adorns her wrist. It was a present from Draco, he gave it to her the day Scorpius was born.
“Sap,” Draco replies teasingly, but Harry can see the emotion shining in his eyes and he knows Draco feels the same way.
don’t look at each other like that,” Astoria replies, shaking her head like she can’t believe she has to spell it out for him, “I was giving him until the end of the week and then I was taking matters into my own hands. But here you are.”
“I’m sorry," Draco mumbled, feeling about five years old, "But you’re going to have to get over it, because I’ve already invited her and Teddy to the wedding.”
“Please what?” Harry asks a little breathlessly, curling his fingers and grazing Draco’s prostate.
Harry can’t think about what this means, not now, with the dream version of Malfoy still so clear in his mind. It can be a problem for later. Something for tomorrow Harry to deal with. He pushes the thoughts to the back of his mind, firmly locking the lid to that box he’s designed for all things Malfoy.
“I’ve seen the way you two are together,” Astoria continues, completely ignoring Draco’s last statement, “You’re practically dating already.”
He and Harry had fought. Screaming at one another until their voices were raw. The Prophet had run a particularly nasty article that day.
, and Harry does, feet flat against the mattress, his body arching up into it, Draco’s name on his lips.
“Easy mate,” Ron says, nervously looking back and forth between them.
“Present first, then sex,” Draco explains at Harry’s distressed whine.
“Oh, you’re one of those people,” Malfoy drawls, his tone teasing. He’s migrated even closer to Harry now, looking over his shoulder. Harry tries to focus on what he’s doing and not on the way his body lights up, tingly and hyperaware of Malfoy’s close proximity, “I should have known you’d be one of
“I love you too,” Harry replies quietly, giving Draco one more kiss before dragging him out of the warmth and comfort of their bed.
Draco prepares himself for the backlash but it never comes. His father just smirks meanly and looks at Draco like they’re both in on a some big joke.
“Says who,
“Engaged?" Hermione says faintly, "Draco, what. I mean how can you - fuck!”
They’ve done this enough times now that Potter knows he’s close, and he pulls off Draco’s cock, stilling his fingers. He ignores Draco’s complaints, leaving him hanging, squirming and twisting as he tries to find friction.
Draco sighs. He knows that look. It’s the look Potter gets when he’s made his mind up about something and Draco figures there’s no use arguing.
“Cast a lubrication charm and start with one finger,” Draco instructs and Harry gropes around for his wand, giving up after a moment and casting wandlessly, “Fuck, it’s hot when you do that.”
Draco’s hands twitch beneath Harry’s grip, his eyes flitting from Harry’s face to his cock—dripping and smacking against his stomach. “Go on,” Harry gasps, freeing Draco’s hands, “Touch – ah fuck – touch me, Draco.”
Harry mouths at his inner thighs. “Don’t,” he says, voice muffled as the words are mumbled into Draco’s skin, “I wanna hear you. Wanna make you feel good.”
“Yeah,” Harry answers, voice rough, “Make yourself come, sweetheart.”
“Thank you,” Harry says softly. He doesn't really believe Remus’ words but he’s grateful for them all the same.
. . .
Potter summons the cake with a flick of his wrist and a muttered
And yet, his attempts have yielded no results. It’s as if Draco has dropped off the edge of the Earth, slipped right through Harry’s fingers and disappeared.
“Fine. I’ll go say hello to Harry. But you better be down in five minutes, or else you’re not going to like what I do,” she threatens, kissing his cheek and disappearing out the door.
Once there, Harry swallows his nerves and thrusts out a hand, “It was nice seeing you Malfoy, I’ll be in touch about the play date.”
“See I’d believe that, except I already asked Ginny about it and she didn’t invite him.” Harry opens his mouth but Ron barrels on before he can get a word out. “She said Pansy didn’t either.”
Suddenly, the need to see Draco, to look into those blue-grey eyes and watch as he comes, flares bright behind Harry’s ribs.
“Potter.”
Yes, Harry knows this is a dream but he can’t help himself. He wants to enjoy the illusion.
Draco whimpers again and Harry loses all restraint. With a growl he grabs the bottom of Draco’s shirt, yanking it roughly over his head. Harry means to carry Draco to bed that very moment but he’s distracted by the brightly colored ink that decorates the pale skin of Draco’s arm.
The Floo powder is gritty between his fingers, the feeling of it rubbing roughly against his skin grounds him to the moment.
“Well. That escalated fast,” Harry says, breaking the silence and drawing a snort of laughter from Draco, “We never do things halfway, do we?”
“Suck.”
And Harry doesn’t know what else to do. So he pulls Draco to him, their chests colliding hard—and then they’re kissing. Harry slides his hands beneath Draco’s shirt, his fingers clutching warm skin, and he feels the exact moment that Draco goes pliant against him.
Harry laughs softly. “No. You don’t snore.” Harry rolls them so that’s he’s hovering above Draco, looking down at him with bright green eyes and a small smile. “But you do talk.”
“Harder,” Harry demands, doing his best to rock back against Draco with more force, “I’m not going to break.”
When Harry’s eyes begin to sting, he slams the doors closed, deciding to get the hell out of this bloody house and as far away from memories of Draco as he can.
Draco’s neck has always been sensitive and it's one of Harry's favorite spots to kiss. He loves the salty, sweet taste of Draco’s skin tingling on his tongue. He loves feeling Draco’s ragged puffs of breath against his hair. He loves the noises he can draw out of Draco, the soft groans of pleasure.
“I love you too,” Draco whispers, afraid to say the words too loudly and shatter this overwhelming feeling of contentment he’s currently floating along in.
With a smile Draco rests his forehead against Harry’s, a million questions on the tip of his tongue.
“You can cook. I’ve seen you cook,” Harry states, beginning to dice the onion and firmly ignoring how much he wants to wrap Malfoy up in his arms and never let go.
, want you to fuck me.”
“Please don’t do this. You don’t have to push me away,” Potter says earnestly. He runs a hand through his hair and charges on, “And don’t say that I don’t know you, because I do. I fucking
Malfoy growls—actually
Or at least that’s what he keeps telling himself every time the thought of Harry Potter pops into his head.
Don't worry things will get resolved quickly in the next chapter!
“You have no idea what I need,” Draco snaps. Everything is crashing down around him, conflicting emotions running rampant through his body. This whole idea that he could be Potter’s friend, that they could be more, that Draco could actually be happy—was so
Well that was…thoughtful. What’s Potter playing at here? Surely if he asked Draco along so he can tell him that this tentative friendship is over, he wouldn’t be buying Draco not only coffee but a muffin too. But Potter is Potter and he’s a Gryffindor, so that’s probably exactly what he’d do.
“Go on then, Potter. Do it,” Draco goads. His sneer firmly in place, lips tilted cruelly, “You know you want to.”
The rest of the afternoon passes in a dazed blur. He knows they eat lunch, and he definitely holds Teddy at one point. He thanks his Aunt repeatedly for welcoming him so graciously into her home, and smiles when she tells him to stop by anytime. But through all of it, Draco is quietly freaking out, internally screaming at himself for letting this happen and wondering what he could have done differently to prevent it. But he quickly realises that it’s pointless. The damage is done, and he knows nothing would have stopped him from falling for Harry.
“No. Draco I can’t. You left more than just Harry behind when you took off. I know you thought we all just tolerated you for Harry’s sake but we loved you too. You were one of my best friends and you just left,” Draco catches a quick glimpse of the wetness on Hermione’s lashes before she turns away and storms out.
“Wouldn’t say there’s much that’s bloody good about it,” Draco grumbles as he takes a seat and pops the bubble covering his food.
With autumn fast approaching, they decide to take advantage of the warm air and sunshine, sitting outside at one of the wooden tables.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I did,” Kade grins, clearly amused by Draco’s reaction, “I thought we could enjoy the view.”
Draco continues with his gentle pace, but Harry wants more.
“I wish I had a camera,” Harry mumbles to himself with a laugh. He’s regretting leaving his Muggle cell phone at home, even if the camera on it isn’t the best.
“Shh,” Harry whispers, “You’re alright, god, you’re perfect. I won’t let anyone see us.” And he won’t. Because this is
Everything slows then, the world narrowing down to the point where they’re connected. Draco folds his body over Harry’s back, their skin meeting in sweat-slick perfection. Words of praise fall from Draco’s lips, softly whispered in broken syllables against the shell of Harry’s ear.
Harry paces the length of his kitchen anxiously, the floor cold against his bare feet as he waits for Orion to return. He’s been up half the night trying to compose that short letter to Draco. His table is covered in scrunched up parchment and two quills lay broken, ink splatters staining the worn wood. After snapping the second one, Harry gave up and got a Muggle biro to use instead.
It’s starting to snow, light fluffy flakes falling from the cloudy sky, already beginning to cover the stoop where Malfoy and Scorpius stand, wrapped in heavy coats and scarves.
Potter starts up a punishing rhythm, pounding into Draco, each hard thrust shoving his body forward against the unforgiving wood beneath him. Potter’s hands squeeze at his hips, fingers digging in and pulling Draco back against him.
“Yeah, you too,” Harry replies as he pulls back and nervously looks around.
“Shit,” Harry mumbles under his breath as he pulls Draco tighter against his chest and yanks the duvet up over them, “Come in Hermione, we’re as decent as we’re gonna be.”
“Alright. Fuck,” Harry groans, “You’re so fucking beautiful Draco. Spread out like this for me. Only for me.”
Draco suddenly feels self conscious with Harry’s intense gaze on him. “What do I say then?”
They’re so close, though still so far from where Harry wants to be.
As Harry entertains himself with all the different tactics he can use to avoid Draco, his eyes stray over to the metal cabinet that sits in the corner of the room. Silently cursing himself, he gets to his feet and walks over to the offending piece of furniture. Even after all this time it still unnerves him to see it sitting there, the front devoid of any decoration. He lets his fingers brush against the cold metal, hesitating slightly, before pulling the doors open and staring solemnly at the magnets that clutter up the back of them.
Malfoy wanders off, over to the other corner of the room where Harry sees Pansy Parkinson sitting primly and eyeing him with uncertainty.
“Shut up,” Potter laughs, his eyes crinkling at the corners, that same look of affection and desire crossing his face for a brief second. Or maybe Draco’s just projecting, it’s hard to be sure, “Wanna race?”
Happy reading!
“It’s the only room I haven’t changed,” Harry lets go of Draco’s hand and steps back so he can open the door, “Go ahead.”
Draco shakes his head, pushing those thoughts to the back of his mind and turns from the window. He slowly makes his way back to the bedroom, hesitating only a moment before crawling back into bed and wrapping his arms around Kade’s sleeping form.
Draco pulls his winter cloak tighter around himself, the soft fur lining not doing much to warm him as he makes his way across the grounds of the Manor. The frost covering the grass crunches under his feet and his breath puffs out in front of him, like little white clouds dancing in the chilly morning air. He should have cast a warming charm before he ventured outside, but he hadn’t expected it to be this cold. His fingers are already starting to go numb, so there’s no sense trying to cast one now.
. . .
They kiss until the ride starts to move again and even then they don’t pull back. It’s only when the ride operator clears his throat that they actually break apart, both with apologetic smiles but unembarrassed to have been caught.
The thought of that, of someone seeing them and knowing that Draco belongs to him, makes Harry’s cock twitch, suddenly so hard it hurts. Draco must like the idea too, because he whines, rubbing against Harry again, harder this time.
Harry speeds up his strokes then, twisting at the top and reducing Draco to a shaking mess—whines and whimpers falling from his lips. Desire, possessiveness and need all curl together tightly in the pit of Draco’s stomach, Harry’s hand the only thing able to soothe the knot of tangled emotions.
“Come on baby, I’ve got you. Come for me.
They hold each other tight, bodies pressed together so closely, that Harry can hear every hitch of Draco’s breath and feel Draco shaking against him
Eventually, Harry flops down on the bed and pulls a still pliant Draco into his arms. This is the only time Draco will allow it and Harry’s going to take advantage. He cuddles close, throwing a leg over one of Draco’s, and kisses him once more.
“Ouch, stop! I think it’s adorable,” Harry says as he slides his hand around the back of Draco’s neck, gently tugging him into a soft kiss.
And now that he has the taste of Draco on his lips, he doesn’t think he’ll ever get rid of it. He’ll never be able to forget this feeling, his mind already storing it away for safe keeping. Harry savors it, enjoying all the sensations, cataloging every one.
“Night, Draco.”
Draco’s eyes slam closed on a particularly hard thrust but he can hear Harry’s rough, gasping breaths and only has enough presence of mind left to demand
“You alright?” Kade asks, his voice groggy with sleep. He rubs his fingers over his eyes before squinting through the darkness to look at Draco.
“Come on then. Do try to not stomp my feet though, you oaf.”
you. I see what you’re trying to do right now and I’m not gonna let you, Draco,” Potter steps forward again as Draco’s brain shorts out at the sound of his name leaving Potter’s lips.
Harry gives his aching cock only one soft lick before he sits back on his knees, making a distressed whine fall out of Draco’s open mouth. Harry smirks and Draco can only bite his lip and watch, as Harry stands and peels his jeans and pants off in one sweeping motion. His cock springs free, red and hard and already wet at the tip.
“The things the papers were saying. Merlin, Harry. You didn’t deserve that. You were being harassed every time you left the house, everyday at work. I was protecting you the only way I knew how.”
Harry Potter. They are not in a relationship, they’re not even friends. They have sex—very, very good sex—but that’s all it is.
, to have a good night and make Harry’s birthday as special as Harry made his.
“Draco? Where are you going?” Narcissa asks with a frown.
Hermione elbows Ron before looking to Harry for an explanation.
“Kade Parker. It’s nice to meet you too,” Kade replies, his American accent only increasing his appeal, “Wait - Harry, as in Harry Potter?”
He doesn’t fight it when Harry’s tongue slides between his lips. Doesn’t question what brought this on so suddenly. Only whines, when a hand roughly yanks at his hair, breaking the kiss and making his head hit the wall behind him with a thud.
When he steps out Fipsy is waiting, just like they planned. The elf helps Harry sneak out to the greenhouse, leaving the gift there to give to Draco later, after the party. A few other house elves are scurrying around, working hard to get the rest of Draco’s surprise ready.
Draco wakes up curled against Kade’s chest and for one blissful moment, it’s just an ordinary morning. But then images of the night before flash through his mind, making his stomach drop. The Empire State Building. The proposal. What the fuck have you done, Draco thinks, internally cringing.
“How in the fuck am I supposed to do that?” Harry squeaks out, his voice raising in pitch. This sounds like a sure fire-way to die of embarrassment, while simultaneously   being tossed out on his arse.
“Dad, is it time for Al and James to come over yet?” Scorpius asks, a whine in his voice.
The boys stay with Harry on Christmas Eve and Ginny is there, bright and early the next morning, along with Ron, Hermione, and baby Rose. They all watch happily as the boys tear into package after package, the living room soon filled with colorful paper and more toys than Harry knows what to do with.
Harry’s in too deep now. There’s no going back. Somehow, when Harry wasn’t looking, this small crush, the harmless attraction, took on a life of its own. Growing into something more solid day after day.
Potter’s mouth drops open and an offended squawk escapes. Draco just laughs.
“I love you, too.” Draco laughs a little wetly. “And thank you.”
“I wanna fuck you,” Harry whispers against Draco’s lips, “Can I?”
This is the first Christmas since his and Ginny’s divorce but Harry’s happy that very little seems to have changed in their holiday traditions.
Just as he's thinking that there’s a specific spot he should be searching for, Draco speaks again, as if reading his mind.
"Thank you," Draco says. Out of the corner of his eye, Draco sees George dipping Harry low to the ground, both of them laughing unreservedly. As if feeling Draco’s eyes on him, Harry looks over and straightens up.
Malfoy clears his throat again, “You’ve been busy this past year. Quit your job, got divorced,” Malfoy smirks and throws Harry’s question back at him, “Why?”
“What did you cast?” Draco asks intrigued.
Harry just needs to come up with a way to get him back.
Draco squeezes his eyes shut, but he can feel Potter’s body pressing into him gently, can feel his warm breath on his face, the calluses on his hands, his magic buzzing against the flushed skin of Draco’s cheeks.
Malfoy nods, “That sounds fine.”
“Shh.” Harry presses a kiss to the corner of his mouth, and then pulls Draco’s shirt up and off.
He washes and rinses his hair, ignoring his cock, hanging half hard between his legs. But the more he resists, the stronger the need becomes. He only feels slightly guilty as he wraps a hand around himself and starts to stroke, images of tanned skin and green eyes filling his mind. It isn’t long before the fantasy comes to life around him.
And who knew a Weasley would warm up to Draco so fast. The alcohol is probably a large contributor but Draco’s choosing to ignore that fact. He directs the line of shot glasses bobbing behind him to the table before sliding back into his seat next to Harry.
He’s jolted from his thoughts when he feels the magic of the wards tingle against his skin. Harry panics for a moment, thinking Draco has come back but he quickly disregards that, knowing that it’s probably just Hermione coming over to check on him.
Harry Potter is bad for his health—he should come with a warning.
Draco quickly does as he’s told, undoing his belt with shaking fingers, the buckle clacking loudly as it hits the floor. Harry pushes him back onto the bed as soon as he’s kicked away his trousers and pants. He licks and sucks his way down Draco’s chest, stopping to bite roughly at Draco’s nipples.
His feet slide on the marble floor and he flings an arm out in a flailing attempt to balance. He manages, somehow, to stay upright and before he can even turn around to see who or what has just slammed into him, an irritatingly familiar posh voice echoes in the empty hallway.
The sun is starting to set, the sky a beautiful orange-pink, puffy white clouds hanging lazily in the distance. The city is sprawled below them, full of people, cars, and lights. But up here everything is quiet and calm.
“So you really love this guy?” she asks, watching him closely.
. . .
“I met someone. We’ve been together about a year now,” Draco blurts and then pauses, steeling himself, “He proposed a few days ago, and I’ve said yes,” Draco confesses, glad to finally be able to tell someone. But as he watches the blood drain from Hermione’s face, he almost wishes he lied. He wishes that he hadn’t ever come back. Or maybe, he wishes he never left in the first place.
“It’s perfect, thank you,” Draco says, audibly swallowing, his adams apple bobbing, “No one’s ever—“ Draco breaks off, shaking his head and struggling for words.
Hermione’s already sitting at the table with a cup of tea, nibbling on a triangle of toast, when Harry walks downstairs a few minutes later.
“Come on.” Draco clenches down, digs his heels into Harry’s back. “Fuck me like you mean it, Potter.”
First Malfoy apologizes and now he’s smiling. It’s apparently a day for firsts.
Harry takes a step forward, reaching out. “No, Draco wait. Please just—“ his words cut off and a tormented sound breaks free from his lips, because Draco’s spinning away, leaving nothing behind but a burst of magic and a loud crack ringing in the air.
Draco’ll come up with a perfectly understandable reason for why he needs to stay a few more days and Kade will just have to get over it.
“Don’t you dare lie to me Harry James. Honestly, you’re twenty-seven, a grown man. You should know how to take care of yourself by now,” she says, her voice much too loud.
After his mother and Harry are out of sight, Draco nervously takes a seat at the table, indicating with his hand that Kade should do the same.
“This is brilliant,” Draco blurts before he can stop himself.
When Lucius enters the room a few minutes later, the thought that he looks much the same as he did towards the end of the war hits Draco square in the chest. The stringy hair and hollow look in his eyes betrays his outward air of confidence. The dull brown prisoner robes don’t help.
“Y-Yes,” Draco clears his throat and rubs both hands over his face, ignoring the way they shake, “I’m fine. The storm woke me up,” Draco says and finally looks over at his boyfriend, giving what he hopes is a reassuring smile, “Go back to sleep, love.”
Harry buries his face in the crook of Draco’s neck and inhales deeply, making Draco shiver and whimper softly. The sound goes straight to Harry’s already hard cock.
*~~~*
“Yes, well. Things are different now.”
“I asked you to come for coffee today because I haven’t seen you since we took the kids to the park. And maybe I’m mistaken, but I was pretty sure you said that you would owl me when you wanted to get together again,” Potter says and Draco feels instantly guilty because he did say that but then he convinced himself, in a fit of anxiety, that it was a terrible idea and had avoided the issue for weeks. So this is Potter calling him out. Interesting, “I respect your decision if you really don’t want to but I couldn’t just let it go. I thought we were maybe...becoming friends and well. In case I wasn’t clear Malfoy, I had a great time and so did the kids. I’d really like to do it again. Sometime soon.”

His eyes scan the tables and land on a blonde head tucked in the back corner, and suddenly, Harry forgets all about his earlier grumblings. Because there’s Malfoy, covered in red glitter, furiously trying to brush the stubborn particles from his clothes.
Draco can't form coherent words at this point, his vocabulary reduced to little
“Hey, less of the
One hand grabs his thigh, holding tight, and the other wraps around Harry’s cock, those elegant fingers quickly collecting the precome and using it to ease the glide. Harry’s vision whites out for a second, overwhelmed by the dual sensations of Draco’s hand stroking him and Draco’s cock hitting his prostate with perfect accuracy.
The girl-Weasley is harder to interpret, but Draco has a suspicion that this is a ploy to get him alone, and quite possibly hex him to death.
His father looks at him critically and a moment later his eyes widen, the pieces clicking into place.
“Harry informs me that he’s taking us out for a family dinner tonight, Draco. You boys talk while I go and call Andromeda,” his mother says with a small smile. Her blue eyes are alight with happiness as she walks into the house.
Draco never had that as a child, and he is beyond grateful that Scorpius gets to.
Thanks for reading :)

The press had been harassing them even before they officially got together, furious that Harry spoke at his trial and befriended him after the war. It only became worse once they came out as a couple.
“Jesus,
Draco just squeezes his fingers back tightly.
that wants to roll off his tongue. He drops any pretense of having a normal conversation with his father and just sits there silently instead.
“You’re teasing,” Draco whines, struggling in Harry’s grip.
“What do you want?” Draco asks, his voice calm and patient.
“Hermione, I love you dearly but if you think I’m moving right now you’re mad,” Draco says glancing at Harry, who gives him a nod and a reassuring smile.
“I’m fine, just tired,” Draco replies and the look Kade gives him clearly says that he doesn’t believe that. But he doesn’t push.
“Draco, come here! Potter wants to document this wonderful evening.”
Something that feels a lot like hope is spreading through his body, a million questions on the tip of his tongue. But before he can get any of them out, Hermione goes on, “Regardless, Harry will sign the divorce papers if that’s what you’re worried about. He’ll sign them because he’s still just as stupidly in love with you as he’s ever been. He would still do anything for you. And just so we’re clear, you don’t fucking deserve it.”
“So, Harry tells me your going to be a curse breaker?” she asks after the silence starts to grow awkward.
“You’re back now, that’s all that matters. And look at you,” she tuts, starting to fill a plate for him, “Skin and bones. Do they not feed you properly in New York?”
“I hated it,” he admits after a moment, “Being an Auror I mean. I was tired of fighting. I absolutely loathed all the paperwork and politics and other nonsense that came along with the job. Honestly, I kept on with it longer than I should have but that’s what people expected of me,” Harry finishes with a shrug.
“Come here,” Harry says, voice scratchy as his fingers wrap around Draco’s hips and drag him forward.
