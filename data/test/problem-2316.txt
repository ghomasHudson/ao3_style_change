That was the best way Harry could articulate his feelings. That moment when a wave has just swallowed you and it's throwing you around, not allowing you to come up for a breath. That's how Harry felt constantly.
"Uh, Malfoy. We were just talking about what we are planning on doing after graduation, what about you?" Hermione asked. Harry cast a thankful smile her way for making Draco included.
The portrait of the Fat Lady was in sight and Dennis did the honours of opening it. The golden frame of the painting swung open and the nostalgic image of the cozy red common room could be seen from where Harry stood on the stairwell.
Harry dodged his way out of the thick of the game and into an open area of air above the Gryffindor goals where just below Ron was cursing at the Hufflepuffs animatedly.
"I don't know!" Harry stood to face him, his tone was very annoyed. "It's a name, it's not like we have been shagging in broom closets!" He tried to grab the parchment but Ron was much taller than him and simply held it high above his head.
The weight seemed to pull back and punch him in the gut as he saw the distance between them. The air he breathed in through his nose was hot, their noses would touch if they were any closer. Harry could see every detail of Draco's irises and realised that they had never been this close before.
"Oh, um, yeah. Sorry. Dumbledore," Harry stammered, not expecting to be interrogated by the Gargoyle.
"What I need to talk to you about is you and Ernie," Harry leant against one of the poles of Justin's bed. "How did you two start, being... together?"
"What are you looking at Potter?" Malfoy snapped. Harry hadn't realised he had been looking at the boy beside him.
Harry noticed the stone wall of the corridor abruptly turn from dusty and dark grey to a clean and lighter tone. This must be the new wing. It was decorated much like the rest of the castle with paintings and statues lining the walls and pillars on the corners. The group climbed a flight of stairs and came to a landing with a beautiful set of doors, dark wood with black iron hinges and ornate patterns reaching across the door.
"Of course it's him," Ron complained loudly as Harry and Draco arrived by the set of couches the eighth year students had claimed.
"And the matter of the Quidditch game this Sunday," McGonagall continued. Harry clenched his fists in his lap in anticipation. "I'm going to allow you to play."
"This is pitch is reserved for the Gryffindor team this afternoon!" Ron yelled. "So pack your stuff up and leave!"
"Potter, I don't have the energy to argue with you right now. Can I get a rain check on this disagreement?" Malfoy looked exhausted but all these ailments he was suffering did not point to any plausible sickness.
Harry knew exactly what Draco was insinuating, his red eyes begging for it. Harry knew it wasn't the most healthy way to deal with hurt but he also knew that momentary pain relief was still pain relief.
Harry felt his pulse pounding in his head. This was it, his final Hogwarts Quidditch game ever. He could no longer hear the cheers of the crowd over the sound of his own shaky breath and steady heartbeat. It's now or never.
Harry soon was able to move almost as fluidly as Draco across the floor and the two were entirely bright smiles and laughs. Harry realised how much he loved Draco's laugh. Not his cynical, know-it-all chuckle, but Draco's genuine and pure laugh that rang like sweet bells in his ears.
"Last potions lesson? I did see you struggling. We can go over that now if you want." Draco feigned an interest.
The Great Hall was even worse. As he made his way to were Ron, Hermione, and Ginny were sitting it felt like the eyes of the entire school were on him.
"I wonder who else is going back to Hogwarts," Hermione said while sorting Harry, Ron, and her school supplies again.
He had one of the worst nightmares of the last few months that night. Even after the amazing afternoon, he had with Draco, once he fell into unconsciousness, his mind was plagued with memories of the war as it was every night.
Harry and Draco had managed not speaking to each other for almost two weeks. Even in Potions class, the only communication they had was pointing the ingredients they needed and scoffing at the other's idiocy.
"Oh, that's marvellous!" Hermione exclaims from across the table. Harry looked up at the staff table where he spotted Professor McGonagall in the middle, smiling at him kindly.
"Did he? Wait, I don't want to know," Ron shook his head. "But just know that I'm still annoyed you're ditching us for him."
It took all of Harry's self-control not to laugh. "I wouldn't know about that, Professor," he said calmly. "I was on my way to Herbology."
"Please tell me you are going to do something with that hair?" Draco asked, snapping Harry out of his daydream.
Harry fought the urge to fall asleep in front of the crackling flames, he'd rather postpone the inevitable nightmares for as long as possible.
Harry was helping shovel snow from the Weasley's front garden when he spotted Pigwidgeon flying overhead toward Ron's bedroom window. The small owl, though not very smart, realised that Ron's window was sealed closed to ward off the cold and rerouted himself to the kitchen. Harry stuck his shovel in the snow and walked toward the tiny owl shivering in the cold. He pulled off his gloves and stuffed them into the pocket of the coat before carefully untying the ribbon from Pig's leg and letting him fly inside to warm up next to Errol, Hermes and George's new owl Athena.
"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I have never been able to produce a Patronus," said Draco nonchalantly.
"We shouldn't be late for dinner," Hermione broke the tension aptly, pulling her coat tighter around herself. Draco nodded his head silently. Hermione, clearly done with the awkward silence, apparated back to the Burrow, leaving the two boys alone on the platform.
"How are we supposed to have a conversation with you sitting all the way over there?" Harry asked, quickly concocting a less desperately pathetic way to tell Malfoy to come closer.
"Even after all these years of pointing out all our flaws, you're such a Gryffindor sometimes," chuckled Harry, referring to his stubborn nature.
Harry didn't acknowledge his comment. He was too busy thinking up ways to get back at the horrid students. Malfoy sensed this and opened his eye again.
"Well I'm joining the Ministry," said Hermione, holding on to Ron's arm to keep him involved in the conversation as he seemed eager to leave for more food. "I'd like to be involved in the Department for the Control and Regulation of Magical Creatures. Make a difference you know?"
"That's good because lover boy came to watch," Ron winked at Harry and pointed up to the stands where Draco indeed sat next to Hermione doing school work presumably. Ron's attitude toward the Slytherin had been slowly shifting from one of disgust to almost tolerance over the past few weeks. It was strange to see Ron this amicable with Malfoy.
The seventh and eighth-year students boarded exclusively on the final carriage, given privacy from the younger years. Harry managed to catch Draco as he was boarding and interlocked their fingers as Ron and Hermione found an empty compartment.
"Would it kill you to shut up? Got it!" Harry pushed himself back onto his feet and extended the object toward Malfoy.
He had been running through the destroyed corridors, the sounds of spells being cast and people screaming rung through his ears.
"What does this have to do with me needing a tutor?" Harry sighed, resting his elbow on the arm of the chair and placing the side of his head on his fist.
"Malfoy, they're fourth years, can't you fight back?" Harry took a step closer knitting his eyebrows together.
"Oi!" Ron shouted. The blurs had no chance of hearing that so Ron touched his wand to his throat, casting the Sonorus charm. "OI!"
Thankfully, when Ron shook his best friend's shoulder, the dark-haired boy groaned and Ron let out a sigh of relief.
"McGonagall will understand," said Harry confidently, bringing his hands down from his head, admitting defeat. "And he'll come."
Harry sipped his goblet of Pumpkin juice while Ginny recounted a joke a Hufflepuff friend of hers told while they were in Hogsmeade the other day.
His team flew down to meet him and they cheered together as they were one match closer to winning the Quidditch cup.
He slid it towards Ron who, as per Harry's instruction, did not react. In fact, for several seconds Harry was worried that he had broken his best friend and he could hardly detect an even an intake of breath from Ron.
"Exactly. This is so clearly Granger's work, not your own. You expect that mud-, uh, know-it-all to take your exams?"
"I know I want to be an Auror," Ron smiled smugly. "That's how you make a real difference you know."
"Can you two relax?" Harry rubbed his eyes with the palms of his hands. "He wants to repent, he wants to start over."
"Definitely," Draco smiled smugly. Harry sighed with a smiled and pulled Draco toward him, almost causing him to fall on top of him. "Really, Potter?"
"Everybody listen up!" Harry got the team's attention in the small room that connected the male and female locker rooms. "We're going to give our all to Slytherin out there today if it is the last thing we do. This, of course, will be my and some of your last year at Hogwarts, so I want everyone here to play their best so we can finish this year with a Gryffindor winning streak!"
Draco's hands found their way onto Harry's hips and he unconsciously stumbled forward. Draco smirked and broke the kiss, but not retreating too far from Harry's face.
- Also, not a warning, but I much prefer Harry and Draco's initial meeting in the film than in the novel, so that's possibly the only thing in this fanfiction that will be based off the films -
"What is it?" Hermione snatched the package off her boyfriend. "Oh." She looked up from the package towards Draco. "It's for you."
Harry's thoughts went straight to the Prophet. Did some sleazy journalist write another horrid article about him?
He pulled the heavy wooden doors open and slipped out into the hallway. Before taking a step forward he felt something hard hit his ankle and he tripped, almost landing on his face if it weren't for his fast reflexes, putting his hands out to stop his fall.
"He's suffering," Harry threw himself down onto Ron's bed. "I wouldn't want to be alone in that castle either."
"Can I come in?" Draco whispered. Harry nodded, wiping his face to clear it of any tears that may have appeared while he dreamt and pushed himself up against the headboard, crossing his legs and grabbing his glasses.
"How have you been, Harry? I haven't seen you all day, so sorry about that." Her smile was too bright, her eyes too full of hope.
They trekked back up to the castle and after a quick shower, had gotten dressed in casual clothes to laze around the common room for the rest of the day.
"McGonagall again?" Asked Ron with his mouth stuffed with toast. Harry nodded, tearing open the envelope.
Harry shrugged off his coat and extended his arm toward Malfoy who placed his suitcase on the wooden floor hesitantly before removing his own coat and placing it over Harry's arm.
"Well, think of it this way; you two get to hang out together without your favourite third wheel hindering you," Harry smiled sweetly at Ron who seemed to consider his statement before nodding.
Potions was the last class of the day, Harry feigned an emergency bathroom visit, telling Ron and Hermione he'd meet them in the Dungeons. It took a lot less convincing than anticipated to get Ron to leave him alone in the common room after their free period. The entire hour he had kept his eye on Malfoy who was across the room, bent over a table studying intently.
"Well, for the first seven years of us knowing each other, I was downright horrible to you," Draco reasoned. "Weasley is your best friend, I wouldn't blame you if you chose him over me. It was just a dream."
Harry found himself deep inside the Forbidden Forest, wand missing. The moonlight trickled through the thick leaves over his head as he walked on an instinctual path through the trees.
Harry sat himself down again grumpily. He took another biscuit. "I don't know where he is. He's been missing since yesterday morning."
The group turned the corner to where the large wooden doors of the Great Hall were wide open, the sound of chatter pouring out. There were a few students of the younger years which Ernie shooed from the entrance in order to make the entrance that he envisioned.
Harry hit the back of his head against the doors and shut his eyes. This is not how he wanted his secret to come out.
"Merlin, Potter, give me a heart attack why don't you," Malfoy huffed, sitting back down in his chair and turning his head away. Harry whispered the counter charm for his wand light and walked over to the Slytherin boy, sitting in a yellow armchair beside him.
The darting around after the quaffle did not help. He found himself having to pause quite a lot, claiming he was watching the other players for a moment.
He couldn't attend the ball, he just couldn't. But what if they wanted him to make an appearance especially, talk with the guests? He really couldn't do that. He closed his eyes as the excited conversations of students grew ever louder.
When Harry caught up to his boyfriend, Draco reached out his hand and locked together only their little fingers, letting the momentum of walking swig their arms between them.
"Two of you in one morning? It's too early for this," said the gargoyle. Before Harry could even rebut about how the Gargoyle sleeps all day anyway he was too caught up in what it had actually said. Two of you?
It felt like an eternity that Harry was shaking hands with witches and wizards from every major wizarding body of government and school across the world.
Harry sat up fast, his chest shaking with the effort to suck in air. He rubbed his eyes and groaned lowly as he lied back down onto the crimson sheets of the bed in the eighth year dormitories.
"Well then, what would be a fitting end to the Chosen One then?" Harry joked as he interlocked his fingers with Draco's. Draco looked around the room quickly, earning a laugh from Harry. "Everyone's outside, enjoying the weather. Well? I'm waiting."
"He's got a point," Hermione looked at Harry worriedly. "But anyway, it will be nice to be back at Hogwarts without any looming threat over Harry."
"Yeah, just a minute," Harry returned his attention to his box and swallowed thickly before shoving the contents down his throat.
"Potter, I thought I didn't see you at dinner," McGonagall peered at him curiously over her thin glasses.
"Are you saying you didn't believe in me?" Harry laughed quietly as he raised an eyebrow. Malfoy shoved him jokingly before returning to his notes.
"It's awful Hermione," Ron groaned as Professor Larrowreed retreated behind her desk to read some novel that looked old and worn, so Ron and Harry took the opportunity to tell Hermione about their sleeping arrangements. "The git has to sleep right next to us."
"And why are we outside when we could be sitting in front of a perfectly good fireplace?" Draco complained as Harry dragged him out into the snowy garden of the Burrow.
He called in sick to both Quidditch training sessions that were held since his trip down memory lane. He had lost interest in everything really. His appetite vanished and even after a week he could see his ribs in the mirror and he berated himself about how sickly he looked but still did not have any will to eat a morsel.
The merriment was contagious amongst the Gryffindors, some third years set off some of the Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes indoor fireworks with showered red and gold sparks across the room, flashing images of the players' faces, and words like 'Win!' and 'Lions!' and 'Gryffindor!'
Kings Cross was still bustling and their presence was hardly noticed by the muggles milling around on their way home from work. Harry made sure to stay close to Hermione as she cut a path through the crowd.
"Okay then, what about here?" Harry grabbed Malfoy by the back of the collar and pulled him into an empty classroom, slamming the door behind him.
Draco definitely noticed, which was what Harry dreaded. He felt Draco squirm next to him but he still did not remove his arm, it was as if Harry had lost control of his body.
"Parents, family, and students," McGonagall stepped up to the podium. "This past academic year has seen great success amongst our students. I have been lucky enough to see their growth from the day they first arrived at our gates to today. I know that this cohort will do amazing things for the wizarding world and I wish every single student here the best for their futures. I invite the seventh, and eighth, year students of Slytherin house to stand as I call them up. Professor Slughorn, Head of Slytherin house will present you with your N.E.W.T certificate."
"No, no, no," Justin laughed. "You know how most people are straight, or heterosexual. And then some people are gay, or homosexual. Well, this may just blow your mind but some people are bisexual. They like both boys
Here he was, sitting under an Oak tree in his final months at Hogwarts with Draco Malfoy's head in his lap and running his hands through his hair. From the beginning, all the odds forbade it but now in hindsight, it seemed as though this was the only feasible outcome.
Harry was far too flustered to reply, instead, making the fruitless decision to return his focus to Herbology. His mind, however, was far too busy listening to the steady pattern of Draco's breathing and the way Draco's fingers were tracing unseen patterns on his left forearm.
Harry nodded. But it wasn't long before he was thinking with his gut rather than his brain. When you live with your peers, there is not much opportunity for privacy and all Harry wanted to do was kiss Malfoy.
"No, he's not," Harry looked back to Malfoy who was clearly very uncomfortable with the ghost's judgement. "What are you doing here?"
"Well he shouldn't," Draco scoffed. "He's got that obnoxiously happy family. Getting along and caring for one another."
Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose's younger brother, having an animated discussion about which house they would be sorted into when they finally went to Hogwarts
With a flick of his wand, he tossed the box to the bed next to him. Neville caught it uncertainly. He grew up in a pure-blood household so he knew the risk he was about to take when he dipped two fingers into the box.
Harry slumped down onto the bench seat of their compartment, Hermione and Ron still waving out the window to Mr and Mrs Weasley getting smaller and smaller in the distance. Harry watched as Ginny entered the compartment to ask Ron for some money for when the trolley lady does her rounds later. Harry ended up throwing a galleon at her when she started to argue with her older brother, this seemed to satisfy her and she headed off to her friends.
"You need to stop this reckless behaviour right now! You could have been hurt if it weren't for Miss Weasley's expert flying. She caught you out of mid-air by the way. Potter, I will not allow you to compete in the upcoming Quidditch match unless you gain back the weight you have lost."
Harry frowned at Ron's nonsensical words. He stood hunched over and catching his breath as if he had run at a breakneck pace from the Great Hall to the Eighth Year's wing.
"You were whimpering and crying out, it was really quite distressing," Draco smiled sympathetically. "You woke up the whole dorm, except for Weasley and Macmillan, those two would sleep through anything."
The five of them briskly walked across the castle to make sure their excursion was completed before the curfew was enforced. Harry instantly recognised the familiar pathway to the Gryffindor common room. Pain shot through Harry's heart when he saw the Fat Lady's portrait talking with the students gathered around her.
An image worthy of a feature role in one of Harry's nightmares. Draco Malfoy's perfectly sculpted face with bloodshot eyes and tear marks on his cheeks.
For the first time in a while, Harry ate till he was full which wasn't a lot in perspective, but Harry felt a small spark of pride in his chest at the trivial accomplishment.
Harry looked out the window again, trying to figure out what was happening. It was impossible to tell from the distance. A blue dot scores a goal.
Stepping inside the portrait hole was like stepping into another life. A life that felt like a millennium ago as well as just yesterday. The crowd of Gryffindors cheered as he looked around the common room clad in scarlet and gold.
"You seem uncharacteristically chipper this morning," McGonagall notes. "Would it be offensive of me to assume that you are up to something?"
"Harry, you said there was something off about him," Hermione set down a brown feather with white speckles on it. "Maybe the war has brought his ego down."
It took Ron all of one day, with Ginny's help, to ask Hermione to accompany him to the ball to which she, of course, said yes. Harry couldn't help but glance over to Draco on the other side of the common room as they were celebrating.
"Downstairs?" Draco raised an eyebrow. "People will worry. And by people I mean Ronald, and by worry, I mean jump to conclusions."
The sun was shining brilliantly as they made their way across the grass toward the Black Lake. It really was a beautiful day. The students piled themselves into groups of three as they prepared to board the small boats. Harry, of course, clung to Ron and Hermione as they waved goodbye to Mrs Weasley, who had begun sobbing again, and her proud husband who was hiding the few tears that rolled down his cheeks.
"Harry, come with me. Ron, you stay here. Harry needs to help me with something," Hermione stood up from the table and motioned for Harry to do the same.
"I think it is you that needs to watch it," Malfoy smiled. "Here." Malfoy tossed the Firebolt toward him.
The temporary pain relief was definitely working. Harry's hands held Draco's waist, holding him tight as the two moaned into each other.
"Will you two pay attention?" McGonagall snaps. Harry quickly turns his eyes to the professor who placed her face in her hands.
"Then," began Draco slowly. Harry could almost hear the cogs turning in his brain. "You have... feelings for me?"
Harry eagerly grabbed a plate and loaded it full of bacon, eggs and two slices of toast before sitting down next to Ron at the table. Mr Weasley, followed shortly by George, arrived in the kitchen as Harry buttered his toast, watching the butter melt slowly into the bread before taking a bite.
He sat grumpily as the rest of the school filed out of the hall toward the school grounds. The food and plates had disappeared off the tables and Harry fiddled with the piece of parchment in front of him as he waited for everyone to leave.
Upon its purchase, Malfoy had sent the company both Harry and his own measurements but still remained adamant that they would be unsatisfactory. Harry on the other hand, who had never had anything tailor-made for him in his life, thought that the robes fit quite well.
When he arrived in the room, he could not see Justin but he could hear the faint sounds of someone brushing their teeth from the ensuite. Harry followed the sound and pushed the half-open door wide enough so he could enter.
When they reached Ron's bedroom Harry dropped to his knees in front of Ron's dresser, reaching his hand underneath it, feeling around for where he hid it.
Harry looked back to Draco apologetically as McGonagall led him away but the Malfoy merely rolled his eyes with a smirk and found a seat at one of the tables.
Harry was pushed in the direction of Madame Hooch who was now accompanied by Professor McGonagall in the centre of the field holding the large silver cup, beaming proudly at him. He tucked his broom under one arm and slipped his gloves into one of his pockets as he looked around at every student and staff member peering down at him, still applauding his victory.
Harry rolled over to his other side where he reached down to grab his watch which lay on to of his sneakers on the floor.
"Maybe if studying is the agenda, we should stay here, utilise the library," Harry suggested. Ron and Hermione both looked at him like he had just suggested that they bring Voldemort back from the dead.
Harry smirked to himself as he swung a leg over his own broom and kicked off the stone pathway. He knew they would be in trouble if they were caught flying outside of the Quidditch pitch but at that moment, he couldn't care less.
"Let me talk," Draco whispered, he sounded a little out of breath and the blush in his cheeks gave his pale complexion some welcome colour.
Malfoy was still absent the next morning too. Harry went down to breakfast with Ron, discussing who they wanted on the Quidditch team that year without thinking about the absent blonde too much.
"Harry." He looked up when the Professor used his first name. "There is no reason for you to feel guilty about it."
"I'm sorry. It's just, who was the one who spent a good thirty percent of his adolescence taking a dig at this family?" Said Harry in a tone that could not be perceived as anywhere near apologetic.
The question stunned Harry to his very core. It was something that he had avoided thinking about ever since he and Malfoy began their friendship.
Draco readjusted himself, bringing his legs up beside him and sitting closer to Harry before resting his head on Harry's shoulder.
"What? No!" Harry stopped in his tracks. "I can't, we can't. We can't be boyfriends, he's a, a boy!"
A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last carriage. Their faces only came into focus when Harry, Draco, Lily, and Regulus had drawn right up to them.
"Oi!" Malfoy yelled. Harry turned just in time to see a Quaffle just before it hit him square in the face.
"Of course not," Hermione placed an arm on Harry's bicep defensively. "I'm surprised, but I think it's cute. Right out of a romance novel."
Harry, try as hard as he might, could not think of a reason to argue against the offer. He knew it would make him feel a thousand times better to be in the sky again.
"I'm not gay," Harry said, looking around the room anxiously, scared that they were attracting attention. "I know I liked Cho and Ginny. This is a one-off thing."
"A boy of your age and your athletic lifestyle should not weigh this little. I've asked your friends too. They've noticed that you've been eating hardly enough or even skipping meals altogether for several months now."
"Mr's Malfoy and Weasley and well and Miss's Granger and Weasley, as well as a number of other students, have informed me of your current state. We're worried about you."
Not a single word was said when Harry and Draco walked into the Weasley's kitchen. Everyone's eyes were on the blonde haired intruder, Harry swore he could see several jaws unhinge.
Harry crawled over to sit beside Draco. Harry picked up the blonde haired boy's right hand in his left. He held it gently as if one faulty move would cause it to break.
Again, neither Harry nor Draco spoke up. Harry looked past her out the window. In the distance, small blue and yellow figures dart around. He could barely tell what was happening but one of the yellow blots seemed to score a goal.
"Well, at least now you don't look like a twig," Ron smiled, holding a bread roll in his hand. Harry grabbed one from the basket and tapped his to Ron's in a toast.
"We should have left five minutes ago," said Harry after glancing down at his watch. He rushed to the ground to grab his bag and robe.
"He hasn't got mummy and daddy to back him up," Ron snapped. "He's gone soft, trying to get Harry to protect him before decides to leave him in the dirt."
"This is all your fault!" Draco grumbled as he threw the Shooting Star and the Quaffle into the Quidditch shed.
Harry took a deep breath in before stepping forward and placing a hand on his shoulder. Malfoy flinched but didn't pull his arm away.
His movements were slow and deliberate. Harry watched intently as Draco lifted his hand and rested it on Harry's arm. Harry took this moment to catch Draco's gaze at such a close distance. Green and silver intertwined on the train station platform that Christmas Eve,
Harry felt it before he saw it. The tiny wings brushed his cheek as if taunting him when it flew past his face and toward the Slytherin goal posts.
"Potter you are so thick! Probably not the best thing to say around you right now but it's true. Why do you think I kissed you the other week?"
"I've never had any sort of feelings for a boy before, at least I don't think I have. Not until this year, not until... him."
"Professor Slughorn has informed me of your need for a tutor," she looked over her glasses, raising an eyebrow at him.
"What she want you for?" Ron tried to catch some of the crumbs running down his robes. Harry shrugged his shoulders. His mind travelled back to last night and he prayed right then and there she wasn't going to pry him about his absence from dinner the previous evening.
It was the morning of the Hufflepuff versus Ravenclaw Quidditch match and Harry was looking forward to being able to switch off from class work, from his own thoughts, from Draco Bloody Malfoy.
"You don't need an excuse to be nice to me," Harry rolled his eyes, taking the cardboard box from his hand.
"It has been thirteen hours since you last saw him." The tone of judgement in his voice was unmistakable.
The grey clouds in the ceiling above had dissipated and, for now, the clear sky above filled the students with a slightly more optimistic outlook for the week ahead.
He made it up to the Owlery, clutching his cloak around himself tightly to conserve his heat in the frighteningly cold weather. He found a school owl easily enough, they were everywhere, and attached his reply to McGonagall to its leg.
Harry rolled his eyes with a smile while Anthony tossed the box toward Terry Boot who was reading a book on his bed, the last against the east wall.
"No, no, no," Draco grabbed Harry again, making sure he was listening to him. "I meant every word, I just can't imagine that it helped you in any way." He guided Harry over to a two-seater couch and motioned for him to sit with him.
"Uh, no thanks," Harry's cheeks reddened against his will. "Can't we just ask your mum for more bedding?"
"Oh, don't you worry, I'm just getting started. Depulso!" He smirked. Malfoy lowered himself before kicking off the ground to build what little speed he could muster on the school supply broom. He raced to meet the ball.
"I was told to let the others know when you woke up," he turned to walk away but stopped. In one fast movement, he leant over Harry and laid a delicate peck on his lips before he was gone.
Ron had remarked (rather loudly) that his change in demeanour was probably because his Daddy was locked up in Azkaban and his Mother on house arrest. This made many of the other boys laugh. Harry stayed silent, struggling to tear his eyes away from the velvety curtains of the four poster, as if his eyes could bore through the fabric. He looked even worse than he had last time he had seen the boy, at least then he had been wearing a sharp suit and tie in preparation for trial.
"Do you want to leave?" Harry could barely hear Draco's voice over the noise but he got the grasp of his message and nodded. Draco held Harry's arms as he stood up, admittedly feeling a little better in Draco's presence.
"You act like I'm not just naturally a great person," Draco placed a hand on his chest in mock offence. Hermione and Ron shared a concerned look before turning back to Draco which did not go unnoticed. "That was a joke, just by the way."
"You know, that makes a lot of sense," said Harry, making sure his sarcastic tone was evident. "Really explains a lot about you."
"Just let him use the owl, Ron." Both boys turned their heads toward the door where Ginny was walking past, clearly just hearing a snippet of the conversation.
He soon realised that he had neglected to bring a clean set of clothes so once he had dried himself he just got back into the same pyjamas he had slept in.
"Look so, we need to talk about what... we are," said Draco. Harry just walked closer to him and looked up at his grey eyes. "What, what are you doing?"
"It's the kind of thing pals tell each other, isn't it? Like I would tell you if I was into dudes. I'm not by the way."
"And Malfoy catches the Golden Snitch! One Hundred and Fifty points to Slytherin!" Parker shouts into the megaphone. The crowd erupts into a cheer as Slytherin win the game against Ravenclaw.
"Harry, Harry!" He had not realised he had been staring into space until Ron had flown over to check up on him. "Are you okay, mate?"
"You're the one who threw it at me," Harry grumbled as he sat up, throwing Malfoy's pillow at his bed and reaching for his glasses.
"Of course not," Draco cautiously wrapped his fingers around Harry's hands. "I can imagine the sort of stuff that has been on your mind the past week, plus, my declaration of my love to you was a tad dramatic."
He, Ron, Hermione and Ginny all ate ice cream at Florean Fortescue's Ice-Cream Parlour and Harry couldn't help but appreciate how the cold ice cream filled his insides with warmth, a small act of normalcy despite being trapped inside his chaotic mind.
"What have I done?" Harry asked. It had been two weeks since he had talked to Justin and he still had not managed to work up the courage to talk to Draco about the two of them. Every time he tried he just ended up snogging him to avoid it. Draco, of course, never seemed to complain.
He tossed it to him and Draco's seeker's reflexes caught it without hesitation. His expression made it clear to Harry that he was not impressed.
"Why can't you just leave me alone? You and your goddamn hero complex. You just have to save everyone, don't you? Well, guess what Potter? I don't need your pity!" Malfoy raised his voice so that the whole room could hear, whether this was on purpose or not, Harry could not tell.
Draco walked a little behind Harry while they retreated upstairs. Harry shoved his hands in the pockets of his dressing gown while he pondered why Draco was acting so cold after last night.
Malfoy had moved back into the Eighth year dorm by the weekend, hex free. Harry tried to meet his eye whenever their paths met but he could never get Malfoy to raise his gaze.
"Wicked," Ron whispered. Though he held a beautiful broom in his hands, Harry could not help the pang of guilty sorrow he had for his old faithful broomstick. He knew it was selfish to resent the expensive item in his hands. "Let's go down to the Quidditch pitch this afternoon."
Then there was his face. Harry unconsciously drew a sharp breath when he saw it. For one thing, it was the perfect embodiment of 'vomit green', and not figuratively. His skin, only on his face and creeping down onto his neck, was vivid green. Not only that, but the left half of his face was covered in angry looking boils.
They made eye contact from across the tracks and Harry brought himself and Hermione to a stop just before they would have tumbled off the platform. A train pulled into the station, blocking Draco from view. Harry felt Hermione pull him back as a crowd of people pushed passed them into the nearest carriage.
Harry leaves with his bag over his shoulder and hands in his pockets. It was the first day of December and the air was icy. His footsteps echoed loudly in the stone corridors as everyone else in the school had already arrived at their first class for the day. He made his way to the Transfiguration wing and knocked quietly on the wooden door of the classroom.
"Thank you," Harry chuckled under his breath knowing that no matter how hard Draco pushed him in their tutorials, he could never be the Half Blood Prince.
The nightmares had gotten worse but Harry made sure to cast a charm around his bed every night to hide his whimpers.
Harry woke peacefully, the short nap unburdened by the nightmares that plagued his deep sleep. Draco was still asleep on his chest, he smiled at him and lifted his arm, the one Draco wasn't lying on, to brush his blonde hair from his face.
"Just try not to be yourself until we get back to school," Ron suggested. "Is that too much to ask?"
Soon it was dinner but Harry passed, feigning a sore stomach. He was soon left alone in the common room, his charms paper, though messy, was finished and tucked inside his bag and Harry stared into the flickering flames, his mind drifting off to unsavoury topics.
He held it up, looking at Malfoy. If they had to be here together, Harry thought they might as well do something productive.
"It was nice meeting you, uh, properly. But I should be getting back to the Weasleys," Harry scratched the back of his neck.
"Uh-huh, just go back to kissing me." Harry knew how desperate he sounded but he couldn't care less as Draco happily obliged his request.
He did this for a while, looking behind him every so often at Malfoy who still refused to look at him, hovering only a few feet above the ground.
Harry held his duffel bag in one hand and in the other, the suitcase with the large Malfoy crest pressed against his thigh, preserving the hidden identity of the case's real owner.
"No," sighed Ron. "Well, yes, but that's not what I'm talking about. Ginny told me about what happened."
"Well, captaincy isn't an excuse for laziness," Harry forced a smile, Hermione said that forcing a smile would help him feel more positive. Something about chemicals.
"Of course," she nodded eagerly as if she had just been waiting for him to ask. "I'd have to fit it in between all my studying but I'm sure we could work it out."
"Merlin!' Ron gasped. "You're joking." Harry shook his head. Neither of them said anything for a while.
"Well, I was thirteen and like a lot of thirteen-year-old boys I was, starting to realise things about myself," Draco sighed. "While the rest of my dorm was discussing the women of our year, I was less than interested. It was around February when I found my first, to put it simply, crush."
Draco pulled back again and Harry was about to argue but he planted a peck on Harry's lips before he could say anything.
"You do know how to tie that right?" Draco sighed, much to Harry's relief he was finally buttoning his shirt up.
Draco opened his eyes slowly. He looked up at Harry through his eyelashes and Harry felt the same feeling he felt last night on the tree stump.
"I see. Potter, I must ask, do you find yourself feeling guilty about the events that transpired here four months ago?" She peered at him as he shuffled uncomfortably in his chair.
"Keep quiet, Malfoy," Ron hissed. As they made their way through the crowd of witches and wizards waving their children off to Hogwarts before term resumes. He turns to Harry. "I'm still annoyed you let him use the cloak."
"But arguing about Malfoy is my third favourite hobby," said Ron sarcastically once he was completely sur his girlfriend was out of earshot. Harry tried to stifle a chuckle.
Harry pulled his hand to his head and to his amazement, Park was still sitting there with his rubbing hers.
"I'd rather not," Draco glanced around at all the younger Gryffindors glaring at him. "I came because I had finished breakfast and was wondering if Potter was still willing to accompany me to Hogsmeade."
James had reappeared, he had divested himself of his trunk, owl and trolly and was evidently bursting with news.
"You know, we never got a thank you from Goyle and Malfoy," Harry said as he ran a hand through his dark hair.
"No, I couldn't," Harry chuckled, placing a hand on his stomach. He wasn't lying, he loved Molly's lasagne but his stomach was still getting used to a healthy amount of food.
When recounting his visit to McGonagall's office at lunch that day, Harry neglected to tell Ron and Hermione about Malfoy. Focusing on his captaincy of the Quidditch team, he told them about the new broom he was promised.
"Because you did save my life," Harry shrugged. "You could have easily identified me at the manor, but you didn't. You brought me time to escape and I'll never forget that." Harry looked over to Draco who seemed determined not to look at him. "And I knew you had no choice. That night, on the astronomy tower I was there. He told you to kill him, didn't he? You were just a kid. We did a lot of stupid things where kids."
"As I said, everyone's outside," Harry smiled, handing complete control over from his brain to instinct. He pulled a little harder and Draco gave in, climbing onto Harry's bed on his knees as Harry lay back on his elbows.
He walked up the stairs and into the office and his stomach dropped. There were two chairs facing McGonagall's desk. Malfoy's blonde head turned to look at him with a scowl.
"He has not yet been informed but he too has no choice either," she reached over to a scroll of parchment to begin writing something down. "The war has been won and Malfoy has chosen his side. I suggest you remind yourself that is the same as yours. You're excused."
Madame Hooch disbanded the Gryffindor's party at 9:30 sharp, ordering everybody to get ready for bed.
"Potter, I invited you here to extend two invitations, one I hope you'll accept and the other you don't have a choice but to," she said from the opposite side of the desk, watching Harry over her thin framed glasses.
"I don't want to lecture you, but McGonagall promised me that she'd make my life hell if I didn't," he said.
Everything was calm until Harry saw Malfoy slink off out of the hall. It was sixth year all over again. Harry's mind raced with all the possible things Malfoy could be getting up to while the whole school was distracted by the feast. He reminded himself that Malfoy didn't really have any friends and probably wanted to eat and leave as soon as possible, that was until he saw a few Gryffindor students from the middle of the table get up and follow Malfoy out.
"Tea?" McGonagall offered. Harry nodded politely. With a flick of her wand, Harry heard a kettle begin to boil in a room off to the side.
"That's good to hear," McGonagall nodded. "And what about Mr Malfoy, I have received the notes from your latest tutoring session and am pleased to see you two have gotten past your differences."
"I guess some people didn't want their kids going to school with Snape running the place," Ron shrugged his shoulders, watching as they all gawped up at Hagrid and headed in the opposite direction to the boats.
"Good morning everyone," she said enthusiastically. "Welcome to your second year of N.E.W.T transfiguration, My name is Professor Larrowreed." The class didn't respond, still amazed at how upbeat she seemed to be at eight o'clock in the morning. "You must have been expected Professor McGonagall but sadly she can not join us as she is far too busy with her duties as Headmistress so you're stuck with me." Ron raised his eyebrow at Harry. This professor didn't seem all there, she reminded them of another blonde hair ditz across the room in a blue scarf and reading the Quibbler under her desk.
Regulus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to move, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son's thin face, already ablaze with excitement. Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide away from him...
Harry was slicing his Knotgrass while he was caught up in his head, thinking about how to talk to Draco. He thought jokingly to himself that the last person that he this much trouble talking to was Cho Chang.
"No, of course not. I didn't even know how I felt about him till after Christmas this year," Harry shook his head.
"Oh, that's right. You can't be a Gryffindor, you're too much of a coward," glared Harry accusingly. Draco looked him dead in the eye, resuming his unreadable expression.
Herbology passed uneventfully, though Professor Sprout promised them that next lesson they would be studying six-foot tall carnivorous daisies which amused both Harry and Ron.
Harry watched Draco's face turn red with anger even from the other end of the corridor, yet he made no effort to grab his wand.
"We got defence against the dark arts first," Ron pointed out. "We get to meet the other new teacher."
It was commonly agreed upon that no one could throw a party like a Gryffindor. The Gryffindor common room was dressed in scarlet and gold decorations and food from the kitchens was continuously brought up by some crafty third years.
"I'm not going to listen to your sob story, Potter, I'm here to make sure you get through your potions N.E.W.T with a passing grade, against my will, I might add."
The office was minimalistic and clean. It had a gold and white theme making the room seem bigger as light bounced around the room.
Harry didn't know what to say to that, there was truth in her words, but it wasn't the truth he wanted to hear. He finished the piece of buttered toast in his hand and under Hermione's stern gaze, he ate another.
Harry sighed, knowing he couldn't win against Draco's will. But he couldn't help himself as he leaned against the table, watching Draco do the work that he himself probably should be doing.
"I..." Malfoy bit his lip, refusing to meet Harry's eye. "Yeah, okay. They threatened me that if they see me talking to you, they'll come for me again."
"Huh?" Harry was incredibly confused at this point, it wasn't often that Draco's lectures turned into beauty tips.
Harry scanned around, looking for the tiny winged ball while also keeping an eye on Summerby, who was circling the pitch intently.
Several minutes of this passed. Harry who was still leaning against the tree's trunk had closed his eyes, his fingers still lazily entangled in his new boyfriend's hair, inhaling the sweet smell of the countryside in Spring.
Harry turned his head left and right, he was still unable to see his box. Slowly and discretely, he reached for one of the silver bowls and picked up a ladle. He dipped it into some chicken and pea soup and poured it into his bowl. To his surprise, it didn't disappear.
"I just want to ask, what is up with Malfoy this year?" Ernie sat up off his boyfriend, fiddling with his wand.
The common room was empty when they arrived, Harry assumed that they were the only ones to bail on the ball to which he felt relieved. Draco led him up the stairs to their shared dorm and he threw his jacket dramatically onto Harry's bed.
It was all too suddenly that George was right in front of him. Harry wasn't unnoticed for long, George saw him out of the corner of his eye and leant on the handle of his shovel in the snow.
"Thestrals are nothing to worry about," Harry told Regulus. "They're gentle things, there's nothing scary about them. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the carriages, you'll be going in the boats."
"Freddy, I need to write to mum about this... and George," said Ginny, tears pooling in her brown eyes as she gazed at the ghost of her dead elder brother.
"Harry dear, would you like seconds?" Molly Weasley asked as she flicked her wand, raising the rectangular glass dish, half filled with lasagne off the table.
It wasn't just Ginny who had heard the rumour of a special notice. The entire hall was buzzing with speculation as to what it could be.
"Harry James Potter, sometimes I swear you are thicker than Ron," she rolled her eyes. "You have been sleeping in the same dorm as two people who call themselves boyfriends for the past year!"
However, the opportunity for the first shower was something Harry was not going to lose. He grabbed his robes and towel before heading into the en-suite sleepily.
"Oh, that isn't new. If I recall, this is your handiwork, Potter," Draco said flatly without looking at him. A weight sat heavy in the pit of Harry's stomach as Malfoy felt out his shirt as to make sure he put the right button in each hole.
"It was her idea really." Harry wasn't technically lying but he definitely wasn't telling the whole truth. She had said it aloud, but he had thought it for a while before. "After the war, we both changed. We're different people."
When Harry decided to get ready for the trip to the station, Ron had begrudgingly wandered off to annoy George or Ginny. This was of course before he was roped into cleaning by his mother in which he seriously reconsidered his priorities, but it was too late.
"Your shirt's buttoned wrong," he replied stupidly. Draco froze before looking down at his chest and sighed as if he wasn't surprised he failed to perform such a simple task correctly.
"Hey, I'll be back I just need to, uh, use the bathroom," said Harry quickly as he jumped up from his seat to follow the five students.
The second of May, 1999, one of the warmest days in the year so far. The eighth years had unanimously decided that the day would be set aside from studying for many reasons not including the heat. Some were discussing their hair, outfit, and make-up for the ball this evening while many had chosen to sit alone, reflecting on events that transpired on that day only a year ago.
As McGonagall began naming the Gryffindor students, the reality of it all sunk into Harry. This was it. The end. Goodbye Hogwarts
"As a matter of fact, I did Confund the examiner," Ron whispered to Harry, as together they lifted Regulus' trunk and owl onto the train. "I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let's face it, I can use a Supersensory Charm for that."
"Potter, you know I'm all for the dramatic but you really shouldn't have done that," Draco glanced around at the bar patrons uneasily, most of whom had returned to their newspapers or food, a few still whispered amongst themselves about the boy they perceived as evil.
"Oh, Harry, we must feed you up, dear, you're getting awfully thin," Mrs Weasley smothered him as he and Ron came down for breakfast a few hours later. Harry smiled weakly. He had lost the ability to care for himself barely a week after the war ended. Mrs Weasley had always given him big portions of all her meals but now even more so. Harry only felt a tiny pang of guilt as he sneakily dropped some under the table for Crookshanks to gobble up.
"It's almost the 2000s guys, better prepare yourselves now," said Justin before leaning over to place a soft kiss on his boyfriend's lips.
"Where are your manners, Potter?" He nodded to where his arm held his assigned partner, Susan Bones' hand. "Be a gentleman."
"Well, that's great!" Harry said with his most supportive voice while inside, he was remembering how neither of his parents could come to his graduation. "They wouldn't not let her? Would they?"
"Horace informs me you've been performing as poorly as ever in class. He's even assigned you a tutor. I guess it's hard actually doing work without using somebody else's."
"I can't wait for Christmas," Ron groaned. "Just so I don't have to think about conjuring spells or healing potions or sleeping curses for even just a little while."
Harry crumpled the piece of parchment in his hand. It only took Harry a second to realise what he had to do. First thing's first, he had to talk to George.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow and turned away from Harry, clearly pretending to be interested in the hem of his robes.
It was a relief when they stepped inside the building and felt the warm air grace their skin. Quickly shrugging off their coats and scarves, they ordered four Butterbeers from Aberforth and chose a booth near the window. Hermione sneakily grabbed Neville's wrist and pulled him into the seat next to her, forcing Harry and Ron to sit side by side. She smiled innocently at Harry when he realised this, and he slid into the seat first before Ron begrudgingly joined him.
Harry couldn't say the words his mind was screaming even if he wanted to. He didn't even understand the words himself.
Harry and Draco parted ways on the way to Defence Against the Dark Arts as their two houses did not take that class together. In fact, out of all the classes that Harry took, he only had potions class with the Slytherin house. He, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny arrived to DADA barely in time for class to begin thanks to Peeves the Poltergeist's antics on the staircases.
The ensuite door swung open, disrupting their conversation with the sleepy presence of Ernie, Neville, and Ron.
"I only gave it to you because I had an extra one and having two this late at night would just make me sick-"
Draco walked over his bed to sit and face Harry, their knees were but inches apart. Something the back of Harry's mind told him to shuffle even closer to Malfoy. He ignored it.
"We've been testing each other on stuff from as far back as first year," said Ron. "It makes me kinda wish I had paid more attention, anything from third year and before I have no memory of!"
"Hey, Draco," Harry whispered to the boy already in bed reading a thick and worn book. "Did you put the cloak back in my case?"
"Are those?" Harry reached out his hand, but Draco pulled his sleeve back down quickly and went back to leaning on his arm.
Harry scowled but turned back to face the back of Ron's head and offered his arm to Parvati. Ron was very happy that he was able to wear some nice robes for this ball, and that he got to take Hermione who was smiling as she clung to his arm.
"Very much open," Harry laughed. He walked up the stone steps and pushed open the door. "After you."
As they set about concocting the Forgetfulness potion they were assigned, neither of the boys attempted to make conversation. Harry had no clue what he would even say to the Slytherin after their conversation the other night.
The Gryffindor list was the longest. He bit his lip as he thought of the students who should be there right now, celebrating the victory with them.
"You don't help me and I am forced to organise daily meetings with Madame Pomfrey where she can reveal exactly what you've eaten that day and the revoking of your captaincy over the Gryffindor Quidditch team."
Happiest memory. Maybe winning the Quidditch cup for his last year at Hogwarts. Sure, let's go with that.
Harry did not know how to reply. The eyes of the entire pitch were on his conversation. After a few seconds of awkward silence, he could tell Dennis was no longer the babbling and carefree first year that fell in the lake. Dennis sighed and looked at the ground some twenty feet below, he definitely knew why everyone was staring.
"That doesn't change the fact that I can't do it," Harry looked up at Draco who was unsurely placing a hand on Harry's shoulder.
He looked up to the staff table where Professor McGonagall was already staring back at him, looking quite pleased with herself.
Harry raced after him, weaving in and out of the chasers wearing red and yellow robes. He caught up easily enough, Summerby's Nimbus 2000 was fast, but not fast enough.
"Hurry up, Harry," Ron called. "Hermione's already annoyed that we came here instead of studying, for you by the way."
"How are you feeling?" Madame Pomfrey asked the student in a comforting voice, Harry felt a little annoyed she had not spoken to him like that.
"He needs to rest now, please shoo," she flicked her wrists at his friends who give him one last encouraging look before they made their way out of the room.
Harry only had one piece of toast as he knew Mrs Weasley was not likely to break her tradition of sending her children as well as Harry and Hermione chocolate on the morning of Easter.
"I know, I know!" Harry cut Ron off in a harsher tone than he had anticipated. "I've got it under control."
Ron rolled his eyes and remained sulking in his chair. Hermione gave Harry a small smile in support.
"That wasn't quite what I was expecting," Hermione smiled a little when Harry revealed his secret to her. She glanced back to Draco who was beginning the potion set for the lesson.
He watched as Draco swallowed thickly before inching forward so slowly that Harry didn't realise until their noses brushed ever so slowly.
Harry frowned. Returning to the Weasley's for Christmas was obviously a given but he had just never thought about it. At the beginning of the year, he could not wait for Christmas break but now, he felt like the scars left by the war had begun to heal, just a little.
His eyelids felt heavy as he forced them open. He stretched his muscles gently, repositioning himself carefully.
"What! You wish! I'm not paying you for something I don't actually want to do. And even if I did, no," Harry rolled his eyes.
"Lumos," he whispered. The light from his wand illuminated the room and a small squeak followed by a thump caused Harry to jump and point his wand in the direction of the fire.
"He deserves to know!" Ginny leant over the table slowly. "They're saying that Malfoy slipped you a love potion."
Airwell scored a goal for Slytherin, distracting Harry as the snitch shot upwards without warning. He cursed under his breath as Park charged after it, giving her the lead.
"Harry, Hermione, Ron," the booming voice of Rubeus Hagrid wasn't easy to miss even over the commotion of the platform. "I can't believe ya finally graduating"
The three descend in silence, Ginny heads in the direction of the girl's locker rooms while Harry and Ron head to the Broom Shed to pack away the Quidditch supplies as they had gotten changed in the Eighth year wing.
But no matter how many times his brain thought about the consequences, Harry's feet would not halt their pre-determined route to the Quidditch pitch. Or was it their will to follow Malfoy?
Harry walked at an incredibly fast pace against the tide of students with his fists balled up by his sides. No one dared stand in his way as his scowl parted the crowd like the red sea.
Harry rolled his eyes. He had been getting changed in a room full of boys since he was eleven. He sat on his bed and stared up into the canopy. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Draco shrug off the shirt and toss it onto his bed. Who needs care when you have an ironing charm?
Harry watched them leave, still walking miles apart. He turned back to Ginny who grabbed him by the forearm and dragged him down the corridor and into an empty classroom.
Harry placed his fork down momentarily on his plate and brought his right hand under the table cautiously. He turned to the conversation, more like an argument, that Ginny and Ron were having as he reached for Malfoy's arm in a gesture of support. His hand connected with fabric and Draco jumped in alarm.
The day passed slowly. Draco had insisted that Harry go and spend some time with Ron and Hermione as the both of them were also grieving. Even though Harry initially resisted, talking about the war felt like the least appealing thing to do, he found some comfort in his best friends.
The five students advanced on the Slytherin, but Harry decided that their threats were more than enough damage for one night.
"I did hear that rumour," Draco sighed, shuffling closer to Harry. "However, during my lesson yesterday, we were notified that it will only be required in the written exam."
"Harry, help!" Hermione yelled. Harry spun around quickly to see the Weasleys, Hermione, Ginny, Neville, Luna and Hagrid standing behind him. He tried to run to them, but his feet were heavy like lead.
Harry groaned and reached his fingers into the box. This time the toast didn't disappear from his fingertips.
The sound of the door opening caused Malfoy to spring up from the bed at a speed Harry thought not possible.
Harry raised an eyebrow as he imagined Malfoy cowering in a bed in the Hospital Wing. He was somehow glad that the old Malfoy wasn't completely gone. A cold though? Really? Not quite worth Madame Pomfrey's time.
Harry played dumb and simply nodded, it was Ron that needed to start the conversation, not him. He was the one who couldn't get over one tiny thing.
Ron batted his hands away but his eyes soon snapped open when he smelt the one thing that guaranteed a response from Ron; food.
The two tumbled into the common room and began tearing at the brown paper before they had even sat down. Harry and Ron stared in awe of the beautiful Firebolt that now lay in their arms.
Suddenly he was ten again, sitting in his cupboard under the stairs at 4 Privet Drive, sobbing softly to himself after Dudley and his friends had yet again beat him up as his uncle bashed his knuckles on the door demanding him to get up,
Someone knocked on Ron's door and Harry called out for them to come in. Hermione poked her head around the door with fluffy white earmuffs on her head and a deep blue scarf dangling from her neck.
Ron's shouting grew to a chant throughout the entire common room. Harry looked to Draco apologetically whose face had morphed from shock to amusement.
"Malfoy, you idiot!" Hermione yanked the hood back over his head. "You're not supposed to be here. If anyone who works at the Ministry is on that platform and sees you, you will be in so much trouble! We'll be in so much trouble!"
"I'm going to get some air," Draco turned, taking his coat off its hook and leaving Ron and Harry alone together.
Harry laughed as he was pushed against Ron and Hermione and up against the wall. He wrapped his arm around Ron's shoulder and smiled as the photographer began taking his photos. The flash was blinding but Molly continued to insist they do more and more.
Harry nodded. Letting his hand go limp in Draco's. The tingling feeling that shot up Harry's arm was extinguished before it reached his brain. The antidote may have cleared his system of the poison but the memory was real, and the wounds they reopened were real too.
Luna Lovegood had briefly come to tell him how lovely it was to see him and Draco dancing together before she had become distracted by some flower across the room.
"It's fine," Draco placed his suitcase emblazoned with the Malfoy crest at the foot of the makeshift bed. "But I guess it is better than being at Hogwarts or... home."
"I think you should know that the Patronus charm is a very advanced piece of magic. You aren't going to be the only one who can't do it," said Draco, rubbing small circles into Harry's back
"Two against one," Harry smirked, signing off on his letter. "And I'm sure Pig would be happy to spread his wings for once."
Harry bit his lip, trying to focus on anything else than what his brain was thinking. Like trying to read the spines of the books across from him. Or counting how many students were sleeping instead of studying.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down at a desk in the common room during their Care of Magical Creatures free period. Harry was in no mood to study, he barely listened as Hermione explained what they were planning to do in their free hour.
"It would be rude to deny it, it's not money they'll supply, just an adequate broom that will allow Gryffindor to win the Cup again," she said with a twinkle in her eye.
"Mr Potter?" McGonagall smiled, placing a hand on his shoulder as if already checking up on him. "There are some people who would like to meet you, and some who I'm sure you've already met."
"And I stand by that. You could pull it up to keep it out of your face if that bothered you. But I refuse to talk about it."
"Draco, you don't seem to understand! We... you know. Where do we go from here? Do we act like it never happened? And if we didn't, how does this work?"
Harry quickly found Ron, Hermione, and Ginny who pulled him into a celebratory group hug. Finally released, Harry looked around for Draco but barely caught the back of his head turning the corner, heading back up to the main part of the castle.
He looked back to Ron and Hermione who were too busy arguing to notice his discovery. He picked up the piece of parchment, unravelling it gently.
"Oh." Draco seemed stumped with the information he had just received. He pulled himself together and stood up straight, an inch or two taller than Harry. "Do you want to know the best way to be sure?"
Behind Mr and Mrs Weasley, the rest of the Weasley children looked up around the hall reminiscently, clearly remembering their time here or perhaps their own graduations.
"Whatever," Terry flicked his wand and absentmindedly sent the box across the wand and onto Malfoy's emerald sheets.
"Welcome students to what hopefully will be a more calm academic year," she said with a weak smile, evidently trying to lighten the mood. "We have repaired all the damaged to the building around us but it will take much more time and patience to repair the damage in our hearts. But now we enter a new year, let's get on with the sorting." McGonagall clapped and the ornate doors swung open again and a group of eleven-year-olds led by Professor Sprout entered the hall walking between the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables.
They just talked for nearly an hour and a half until the sky was lit up in beautiful hues by the setting sun when Hagrid quickly ushered them back up to the castle for dinner, lest they are caught out of bounds after dark.
Leaving the change rooms with the rest of the Gryffindor team, Harry was greeted by the entire eighth-year cohort wearing an assortment of Gryffindor paraphernalia. In the front was Hermione and Draco, the latter fussed with the platinum blonde hair peeking out from under a Gryffindor beanie with an unamused sort of expression.
"What was that? You don't have a wand?" Laughed Ron with a mocking tone. "Did McGonagall make you leave it with her? See, she doesn't even trust you."
Draco tapped the tip of his wand to the top of Harry's head and the slightly shorter body felt a shiver down his spine. Draco stepped back, admiring his work and Harry spun around to look in the mirror. His hair was straight, combed in a side part and slightly backward. Harry touched it tentatively but Draco slapped his hand out of the way.
The lesson continued as one by one they showed off their skills at different spells both defensive and offensive. Professor Dellow would periodically yell out a different spell and they'd all take turns, stepping forward and blasting light at the dummies.
"What do I get out of this? I know that you aren't going to tell me about yours," said Harry, looking away from Draco.
They suddenly stopped moving, causing Harry to step on Ron's heel which earned him a punch in the arm.
"Can you just be a grown-up about this?" Hermione chastised as Harry finished placing his Standard Book of Spells Grade Seven into his bag.
He walked briskly in the direction in which Malfoy left, scanning the halls from him before spotting the back of his blonde head.
He hadn't told anyone either, not even Ron. How could he even bring that up with him? After he had returned from the empty classroom to the Great Hall, he had received many questions as to where he went from not only his circle of friends but also many nosy passerbys. He simply said that the two talked, no details.
"So you didn't mean it?" Harry nodded, pulling away from Draco and heading the bathroom to get ready for bed.
"You better open it, it's from McGonagall," Ron managed through a mouth full of muffin. Harry carefully slid his finger under the seal, tearing it open.
. He looked around as his left leg bounced anxiously. He didn't even know if Malfoy was coming! How long would he wait anyway? Hermione placed a hand on his knee to stop him moving.
Silence fell between the two again as Harry opened the box carefully, making sure the confectionary frog inside did not escape. The silence wasn't uncomfortable however, neither of them had anything to say as they sat in each other's presence.
Harry rolled his eyes and met him at the sink beside him. "So how are you feeling, graduating in a few hours?"
"This might come as a shock to you, Potter," Malfoy began in a very thick sarcastic voice. "But you're famous. When you defeated the Dark Lord the entire wizarding world knew everything about you from your birthdate to all the colours that specked your stupid little eyes."
Madame Hooch came in to tell the team that they were needed on the pitch. They walked out to the cheers of the crowd, Harry in the lead with Ron closely behind him. Some Gryffindors in the stands begin to sing the revised version of 'Weasley is our King" much to Ron's amusement who was bowing and waving as he walked behind Harry.
Draco narrowed his eyes sceptically before reaching his pale hand into the box and pulling out two and popping one into his mouth.
Draco seemed to know what that muffled response translated to and hummed to himself in satisfaction.
He stumbled backwards into Malfoy who grabbed his upper arms to keep him from falling. Harry could make out a vaguely Slughorn shaped blob nearing him and seemed to be mouthing something at him.
"Come on," Ginny waved him over. "Apparently McGonagall has an important announcement during dinner."
"You can stop staring, Potter, it's unsettling," said Draco flatly. Harry blushed lightly in embarrassment.
The four of them settled in for the long train ride. Ron and Hermione opposite Harry and Draco. As the train hummed to life and the scenery around them began to move at increasing speed, Draco lay his head on Harry's shoulder and Harry felt an overwhelming sense of calm wash over his body. He looked out of the train window at the stone castle in the distance.
"Great," Harry smiled, reaching under his bed for where he had probably dropped the Call Back Snitch.
"Regulus Neville," said Harry as he stared into his son's bright green eyes. "You were named for two of the bravest men I have ever known, one of them was a Slytherin and sacrificed himself to rid the world of an evil man so the rest of us could live in peace. And your brother likes to forget your father was also in Slytherin and he's pretty alright too I guess," Harry laughed.
"Hello," said Draco Malfoy. Hands in the pockets of his black pants, the Gryffindor scarf he wore at the game hung loosely around his neck.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had all taken the offer extended to all seventh years who want to repeat their final year. At first, Harry and Ron didn't want to go but Hermione talked them both into it. Ron had only taken a 'pretty please' and a kiss on the cheek to write up a letter to Hogwarts, while Harry wanted to be anywhere but those haunted halls. It would be like his first year all over again. People pointing and staring at the boy who defeated He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. But he had reasoned it would be better to be with his two best friends than sulking around the Burrow till he found his own flat. He had no intention of returning to Grimmauld place.
The class resumed in conversation as small groups of students hunched around desks writing hastily on pieces of parchment.
Harry took a deep breath and forced himself to face his arch nemesis. He walked toward the Dark Lord with his fist curled up by his side. When he entered the clearing he saw two trees framing Voldemort, each with a person tied to them with a cloth bag over their heads.
"It's probably because he wants to stay with his new best friend Malfoy," Ron folded his arms as he slumped back in his chair. Harry frowned, shocked at his friend's words.
Draco jumped at the mention of his name, he turned to see Harry standing in the hall, smiling at him tentatively. Malfoy began walking briskly away from him.
"It slipped my mind I guess," Harry threw the quaffle in the large basket. "Or I assumed she would sooner."
"Hey, no. We are not doing this right now. Was it them? Did they put you in the Hospital Wing again?"
"Because as much as you and Mr Potter do not get along, the one thing you both have in common is a passion for Quidditch. I expect you to attend every training period, without question."
"You do remember that we were titchy first years, right?" Harry raised an eyebrow at his best friend.
was engraved in beautiful cursive writing on the top. Harry lifted the lid back and saw a perfectly balanced meal laid out inside.
"And I win, yet again!" Ron cheered. Harry folded his arms grumpily. "You need to step it up, mate."
As they made there way up the first few stone steps of the castle, Draco made sure to take a peek at his reflection in the large windows, tossing his hair a little more.
"Keep stirring!" Draco scolded. "I want something. A reasonable excuse as to why you have been avoiding me since we ki-"
"That was easy wasn't it, or are you going to need me to hold your hand as you go in?" Asked Hermione in a patronising tone as they arrived outside the doors to the Hospital Wing.
"I was there again," Harry began, nodding in the general direction of the forest. "Except there were no Death Eaters, no Hagrid, just him. He told me that he was going to kill me, he does that a lot. But this time he told me that I had to choose either you or Ron to kill as well."
"Yeah, that's kind of the point," Hermione grabbed Harry by his robes and pulled him back into motion.
"What are you looking for?" Harry rested his forehead in his hands on the table. It was really too early for this.
The only difference Harry noticed as he took a seat, was under each of the house banners adorning the stone wall from which they entered the hall was four gold plaques underneath each of the house tapestries and Harry didn't need to look for very long to guess what they were for. The writing etched into each of them listed the students who gave their lives in the final battle. Harry wrenched his eyes down to stare at the wood table beneath him, forcing air into his lungs steadily despite their persistent rattling.
"Because it's one of my rules," Draco turned to him. "Never think about Potter with a ponytail. At least not in public."
"Come with me," he got to his feet and extended a hand to Malfoy who didn't take it, instead pushing himself off the floor. Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry shrugged. "There isn't much to say I guess. He yelled at me to get out before we could get anything done." Hermione looked at him disappointedly when he announced this, but he ignored her. "And you'll never guess why Malfoy was really in the infirmary," he quietened his voice to a whisper and leant across the table. "He was attacked by a bunch of students, they hit him with a bunch of curses and kicked him!"
Draco tentatively placed his fingertips delicately atop Harry's and stepped forward into the common room.
They fell silent again, simply staring into the flames together and being comfortable in each other's presence for the first time in their lives.
"No, I just. You were brilliant!" Harry reiterated hopefully. Draco held a straight face, taking him apart with his eyes.
Harry had stopped listening to the commentary and had no idea of what the score was. Unless Slytherin had completely incapacitated Ron and were just tossing the Quaffle back and forth through the hoop, he was confident that they had not overtaken their score.
Looking at his watch, there was only around fifteen minutes left of the Gryffindor and Slytherin Potions class so Harry took his time as he made his way to the dungeons. He thought about McGonagall's request. Sure, he'd love to return to the Burrow with Ron, Hermione and Ginny for Christmas. But on the other hand, he knew Draco would not return to the Malfoy Manor but him being alone at Hogwarts was an idea that Harry wasn't comfortable with. He was hopeful that all of his bullies would leave for the holidays but he knew that Malfoy had been damaged by the horrors of his past just as much as he was. Being alone in the castle was not something he'd wish upon Malfoy, not after the events that occurred in the past two years.
"Wait, what?" The weight of what Draco suggested hit Harry all at once. Could they really become a couple? Harry didn't even know if Draco had any feelings for him. The idea of himself being with a boy still had not occurred to him till that moment. Harry, of course, had never had high expectations of his future, he was never certain if he'd live to finish his wizarding education.
McGonagall nodded. "I believe you should trust your friends more with telling them how you feel. You know, I think that would be good for you to vent your emotions."
"Excuse me," Draco tutted. "You're the one who interrupted a perfectly good moment with questions about my sex life."
"Yeah, Harry," Anthony peered across the room. "You probably know him the most, having to hang around him all the time."
Harry nodded in acknowledgment of her as he entered the room, closing the door behind himself. He took a seat in front of her desk and helped himself to a custard cream from her tin.
- This chapter contains a major character discussing their self-harm scars. If that would make you uncomfortable, there is a chapter summary at the very end for you to read. –
Harry turned on his heel, facing away from Draco, raising his wand in the air. He just wanted to get this over and done with. To prove to that git that he was wrong.
Draco looked up at him with an expression that Harry only got to see on the rarest of occasions. The Draco with his barriers completely lowered, a Draco who didn't have any snarky comments, a Draco who was just a broken and lost soul.
Malfoy never ceased his glaring at Harry whilst he mounted the broom begrudgingly. Harry laughed under his breath as Malfoy kicked off the grass and rose in the air, clutching the rickety broom for dear life.
"Alright Potter, let's get this over with," said Malfoy in such a quiet voice that Harry would have missed if he hadn't been listening so intently.
Harry shrugged off his school robe and placed it on his bag upon the grass. He loosened his tie and picked a hair, presumably Crookshanks', from his jumper.
"Why on earth would you do that?" Draco's voice was judgemental but his eyes gave him away. Most people thought Malfoy's grey eyes were unfeeling and cold but being this close to the boy revealed just the opposite. The grey irises were practically translucent windows to his soul, if he let you, you could see right in.
McGonagall finished her speech and with a flourish of her hand, the golden plates in front of them filled with food and the silver goblets filled with water and pumpkin juice. They tuck in, Even Harry's mouth watered at the sight of the feast laid before them. He picked up a jacket potato and some steamed vegetables and picked at them gingerly, only eating just enough to get his stomach to shut up. Hermione tapped him on the shoulder and pointed up to the staff table. Next to Professor Slughorn sat a young witch with black hair coming down to her collarbones deep in conversation with the potions master.
"I'm fine, really," Harry tried to sit up but with a flick of the nurse's wand, he is forced back down.
"Leave him alone," said Hermione, hitting her boyfriend in the arm. "Let's just get this over with."
"What do you mean," Harry frowned, grabbing Draco's wrist. He half-heartedly tried to pull away from Harry but let his arm go limp in his grasp.
"Are you positive I'm not going to get eaten alive?" Draco began walking slowly toward the Fat Lady's portrait.
Harry guessed that is what he used to trip him and snatches it out of the air, still scowling at Malfoy. Draco smirked shadily, and he held the handle of his Nimbus 2001 with both hands, leaning on it a little. Narcissa must have sent it
He didn't care that everyone was beginning to notice how sleepy he was in class. He didn't care that Draco and Ron had already caught him from falling twice while he walked down the stairs from the dorms to the common room. He didn't care that he was waiting in McGonagall's office for her to dissect him and tell him what to do. He didn't care.
He looked to Malfoy for a reaction but received none. Harry was having serious doubts about the legitimacy of any Illness at all.
Harry froze as George Weasley sat next to him, eagerly digging into his breakfast. "Oi, Harry. Could you pass me the salt?"
Harry couldn't control it. He was leaning forward, millimetre by millimetre, so slowly but all too fast. Draco was looking down at his lap again, clearly processing what Harry had just professed.
"Who are you writing to?" Ron asked. Harry turned from Ron's wooden desk to face his friend who had just returned from a shower, his green pyjamas a little damp around the collar. The sun had set and all occupants of the house were readying for bed. Even Pigwidegeon had tucked himself away in the corner of his cage.
"Harry!" he exclaimed, placing a hand on a royal blue armchair to catch his breath. "You will never believe... bloody hell... Ginny!"
"Okay, but you need to shower," Draco shoved Harry off him and stood up, offering his hands for Harry to pull himself up. They both walked in the direction of the eighth year bathrooms.
As Harry looked at him, he laced his fingers through his husband's and he lowered his hand absent-mindedly and touched the lightning scar on his forehead.
"Come on, Potter," Draco said, holding his broom in one hand. Harry smiled as he saw him wearing the sweater Mrs Weasley knitted for him.
Harry extended his arm out and Park did the same. Their hands were mere centimetres apart as they reached for the game-ending ball. It was so close.
"Is this a regular sort of dream?" Malfoy asked. Their eyes met and Harry could see no ill-intent in the boy's eyes.
"I'm glad we've only got Debbie Downer tonight," Justin said as Harry peered into the box to attempt to suss out the least risky bean.
"Don't get sappy on me, Potter," Draco punched Harry in the thigh. "Or just at least not in front of two hundred, highly likely to be armed, Gryffindors who definitely do not like me."
Harry decided that now wasn't the best environment to dive into Draco's family issues. "Is that my scarf?"
"Let me finish this sentence," she said before scratching the final line of her Ancient Runes essay and placing her quill back in its case.
Someone had placed an ill-timed curse on the Slytherin team's usual Seeker, Chloe Park. So while she was in the Hospital Wing, Draco Malfoy had stepped in to replace her.
"Helpful," Hermione smiled sarcastically. "So we don't know if he's coming and if he is, we don't know where?"
They arrive back at the Burrow too soon but Harry knows it would only get worse tomorrow as they leave for Hogwarts.
The four of them fell into silence as they set about completing their assignments. Draco finished his essay rather quickly as promised and let out a satisfied sigh.
It was then that Harry had an epiphany. A memory of something that was buried somewhere in Ron's room that Harry never imagined would find its proper home.
"Students, in just under two months time an entire year will have passed since the final day of the second Wizarding War held here in our very walls."
He followed the boot prints in the snow until he saw the outline of a person sitting on a tree stump.
"Before we start our feast, there are a couple of announcements I would like to address." Groans echoed across the hall from the tired and hungry students. "Hogsmeade visits have been reopened as all third years and above will know," Harry recalled with his seventh-year book list came a familiar permission slip for the wizard only town that Mrs Weasley signed for him. "And as most of you know, several students that should have sat their N.E.W.Ts last year have returned so we have an excess of students. So, in our reconstruction, we have a new wing where we have a new common room and dormitories where they will all be staying."
