“I swear to Merlin that if you have done something stupid I will tell everyone about the pigeon incident.”
The room was filled with cheering, and a lot of crying from Molly, Charlie opened bottles of champagne soaking everyone in the process as the sparkling drink fizzed and bubbled out of control.
“Sorry, not tonight Nev, I’ve got a load of studying to do so I need to go to the library.”
Draco gently pushed Harry backwards until he was pressed up against the tiles, the porcelain cold against the heat of his body, his painfully hard erection crushed against Draco’s equally hard cock. Draco broke the kiss, Harry reached out to pull him back, wanting more kisses, more Draco, but the blonde dropped to his knees taking Harry’s quivering dick in his hand, caressing him in long, tight strokes, smearing the beads of pre-come across the head.
Harry felt faint. This was it, this was where the rest of his life was going to be decided. “Yes.”
“Kreacher lives to serve.”
The elf jumped off the bed. “As you wish Master.” He scuttled out of the room leaving Harry mercifully alone.
Draco chortled. “Merlin, does she still believe in all that stuff? But send her my love, she was one of the few people that didn’t turn their back on me after the war.”
Harry got to his feet, he closed the door, locking it with Alohomora, and walked slowly over to Draco who was still staring at the far wall of the room. He placed a hand on the blonde’s shoulder and squeezed it gently.
“Hello Kreacher, hello Harry, I brought some Fringlefruit flowers, they are in bloom right now. Quite lovely don’t you think?”
“I’m fine, wounds are healing up, and my strength is coming back with the blood restoration potions Draco has been force feeding me.”
Harry didn’t know how long he spent going through video after video of the band on stage but by the time he had watched the last one Kreacher had removed his empty dinner plate and replaced it with hot apple pie and custard which had long since gone cold. Harry yawned and made his way upstairs to bed where his dreams were filled with images of sweaty bodies and platinum blond hair.
Dean Street Studio really does exist, and Take That and Spandau Ballet both recorded there among many other artists.
“Master Neville is here Master Harry.” Kreacher announced even though Neville was already enveloping Harry in a hug.

Harry jumped when Hermione rapped a spoon over his knuckles. “Ow! What was that for?”
“I don’t like being an Auror.”
(See the end of the chapter for
’ by Charles Dickens, Harry smiled to himself; it seemed that not all Muggle items were deemed useless in the purebred wizard world.
Harry sucked at his knuckles, that spoon had really hurt. “I know, but it’s never felt like the right time to talk about it.”
“Fuck,” Harry whispered, “you are beautiful.”
A rustling noise reminded Harry that the roses he had bought were currently being squashed between them. He pulled away and held out the bouquet to Draco.
“You really like him.” Hermione stated with a soft smile.
Kreacher’s eyes grew large and round. “Yes! Master Harry will forget he has seen the tree!”
“Right!” Dan laughed. “I’ve been to some parties that ended up like that.”
Harry had taken a few days off work to be with Draco, so they spent the next couple of days  exploring each other’s bodies until they were utterly exhausted. Although the sex was fantastic there was a deeper connection, their past had created a bond that tied their souls together and Harry knew he never wanted to be with anyone else. Draco was in the process of writing the second Lumos Solem album but he was finding it extremely difficult. He had written all the tracks from ‘
What a total softie Draco is - just adorable :)
“Yeah mate you’ve been gone ages, we looked all over for you.” Ron said.
Harry was propped up in bed with Draco laying next to him on his uninjured side. The blonde had refused to leave Harry’s side for a single second since Harry had woken.
With the tension broken the atmosphere was more relaxed, and Harry made sure that Draco was involved in all the activities. The ritual of gift opening took place in the living room, there was a huge pile of gifts under the tree which Bill handed out. One by one the family opened their gifts, Hermione particularly loved the otter hairpin that Harry had bought at Camden Market, and Ron was very happy with the dragon skin wallet Draco had helped Harry chose.
Draco sipped at his coffee. “Now that you are feeling almost normal we should talk Harry, talk about last night, and about the kiss.”
“I think we should, and it was lovely of him to sing that song about Harry don’t you think?” Luna said.
“I went to see this at the movie theatre as a re-release for Dudley’s sixth birthday. I wasn’t supposed to be going but Mrs. Figg had broken her wrist and was in hospital so there was no one to look after me. It was one of the few times the Dursley’s ever took me anywhere. I love this movie.”
Draco had sent the first new message around one in morning, Harry remembered that he had stumbled through his front door at just before one.
“Err, yes?”
Molly screamed. “You mean….a baby!”
“What?” Harry’s face turned very red. “It’s not that funny.”
Draco led Harry by the hand into the main room of the apartment; it was a huge open plan room with the far wall almost completely taken up by floor to ceiling windows and a sliding door leading to a substantial balcony. There was a contemporary kitchen of marble, granite and stainless steel appliances with a breakfast bar, a dining area and a lounge area with several large sofas and an enormous TV mounted on the wall above an inset gas fire.
“Have you seriously not talked about how you are going to make it work between you? Do I need to lock you both in a room with a bottle of firewhisky so you can sort it out?”
Luna was right - Draco wrote My Heart Is Green about Harry.
Hermione chuckled. “A pissed off Molly is terrifying. How’s work going?”
Harry arrived home intending to start decorating the bedroom, which he had neglected for weeks, before going to Ron and Hermione’s party that evening. He needed to keep busy, and the mind numbing boredom of painting walls would do just that. He banished Kreacher to the kitchen, the last time he had allowed the elf to help had ended up with more paint on the elf than on the walls, and spent the next several hours cutting in, painting the walls and glossing the trim. Despite keeping himself busy his mind floated back to Draco. Harry was, by now, sure that he was in love with Draco but had not said the words aloud, scared that the blonde may not feel the same way, and worried at how their relationship could work long term. Whilst Harry had been brought up a Muggle he now spent very little time in the Muggle world, except for his time with Draco, and with Draco still adamant that he did not want to come back to the wizard world Harry could not see how they could sustain their relationship. There was also the issue with Ron. Whilst Hermione, Luna and Neville all seemed to have accepted Harry’s relationship with Draco, Ron clearly did not, and Harry was saddened that his oldest friend would not look beyond Draco’s actions in the past nor give him a chance to see that he had changed. In some ways Ron was acting as bigoted now as Draco had in the past, Draco had been universally scathing on ‘mudbloods’ without exception, and Ron was displaying the same prejudiced view on Death Eaters. Harry did not want to choose between Ron and Draco but if he had to he would chose Draco. Whilst Ron was the biggest part of his past Harry knew Draco was his future.
“Thanks Luna, I really appreciate your help.”
“Hey Harry,” Hermione’s clipped voice came from the Talkkey, “everything ok?”
“Not me Master Harry, it was Master Draco. It was to be a surprise but now you have spoiled it.” The elf’s ears dropped down over his shoulders in despair. “Master Harry was supposed to see the tree when it was finished not before.”
He darted from the room on legs that felt like jelly, vowing not to return for at least ten minutes. The last thing he heard as he closed the door behind him was Pansy telling Draco he needed to remove his underwear, and he very nearly fainted.
“Mistress Hermione, a very happy birthday, Master Ron so good to see you! Master Harry, Mistress Hermione and Master Ron are here.”
The waitress cleared their plates and placed the bill on the table.
“Ready Potter?” Draco unlocked the door with Alohomora and opened it. “We should do this quickly.”
“What is it Malfoy? What are you hiding?” Harry tightened his grip on Draco’s arm causing him to hiss and drop to his knees. The stinging sensation on his scar intensified. Harry started at the blonde in alarm.  “What the fuck is going on Malfoy?”
Harry noted that Draco’s wand was in the box, he was pleased that Draco had chosen to keep it. The box was full of scraps of paper torn from notebooks, newspapers, paper napkins, anything Draco had to hand to write on at that minute. Harry picked up a few at random and read them.
The walk back had tired Harry more than he thought and he fell asleep in one of the library armchair next to the fire. He awoke to the chatter of tiny voices and the scampering of little feet coming from the main foyer of the Manor. Harry crept out to the hall and was astonished to see a huge Christmas tree with the house elves scrambling up the branches to hang decorations on the boughs. One elf was swinging precariously from the top of the tree trying to place a star on the highest point.
Kreacher brought Draco his coffee and a fresh cup for Harry, plus some sandwiches and pastries that he must have rustled up in the kitchen. The elf set everything on the coffee table and left Harry and Draco alone quietly closing the door behind him.
Harry stoked himself faster, moaning as he neared his release.
“How dare that Death Eater show his face here!”
“Stubborn like someone else I know,” Draco said ruffling Harry’s hair.
Harry pulled his wand from is back pocket, as an Auror this was an inbuilt reaction, but quickly replaced it when he realized that the girl was a Muggle.
“How are you feeling? Still feeling like shit?” Draco’s voice didn’t sound angry but it sounded hollow to Harry’s ears.
Harry spent a ridiculously long time getting ready to meet Draco, a long hot shower with some nice scented shower gel that Hermione had bought him at Christmas, a clean shave and he even used some hair product to try to make his hair look presentable. He dressed in his favourite pair of jeans, a tightfitting dark blue t-shirt, black trainers and a black hoodie, he checked himself in the mirror and deemed himself ready. When he checked the time it was already eleven fifteen, which meant he was going to be late. He decided to take a cab to the restaurant, he didn’t know the area well enough to apparate there and the underground tube would involve changing lines so a cab was the quickest option. He managed to hail a cab within minutes, he texted Draco letting him know he was on his way but would be late. He received a reply immediately.
Harry laughed, “I thought I might actually kick myself in the face.”
“What are you doing,” Harry asked, “and what is that noise?”
“Maybe he will come round and come back to the wizarding world.”
“Hey there sexy, come on in,” Draco said with a grin.
Harry knew that Draco was behind the opal necklace that had cursed Katie Bell, he was so fucking sure of it, but he just couldn’t prove it. He didn’t trust that Slytherin bastard one inch. Draco had been acting suspiciously all year; sneaking around at night, disappearing into the Room of Requirement, and being even more shifty than usual. Hermione, Ron and even Dumbledore thought he was making mountains out of gnome hills but he knew that Draco was up to no good. He was going to find out what Draco was doing, what he was planning, what he was hiding; but he’d have to do it alone, he couldn’t rely on Ron or Hermione, they thought he was seeing things that weren’t there. But he knew, he fucking knew.
“Not that again,” Hermione huffed. “We need to go to bed, it’s late and we have a ton of homework to catch up on tomorrow.”
“I haven’t the faintest clue, but as Muggles they have no idea what it means.”

“We thought next summer, I’ve always loved a summer wedding.” Hermione was glowing.
“Hermione? Ron? Do you want to go?” Harry asked. “It might be fun.”
Harry felt his temper rise. “I will be studying in the library,” he stood up grabbing his book bag. “In fact I’m going there right now!” He clambered over the bench and marched out of the hall feeling the eyes of his housemates following him the whole way.
Harry hesitantly pushed open the door and peaked inside, both Pansy and Draco were sitting on the sofa and Draco was mercifully fully clothed.
Draco tightened his grip on Harry’s shoulders as Harry thrust his hips upward to meet Draco’s downward thrusts. Harry drove himself harder as Draco pushed down, burying himself deep inside the blonde who moaned his pleasure into Harry’s hair. Harry took Draco’s cock in his hand sliding it up and down his long, hard length, his hand still slick with lube.
“Malfoy, please talk to me.” Harry said softly. “Whatever it is, whatever is going on, we can fix it.”
“You know I don’t like surprises, it messes the balance of my chakras.”
Harry reluctantly put on his shirt pulling himself up to sit on the sofa to watch Draco dress himself.
“Draco.” Harry closed his eyes and let his head drop back against the pillows. “Fuck.”
at Draco who burst into giggles.
“Hi Luna, how are you?”
“D, what do you want to do next?”
Draco passed bottles of water to Pansy and Harry whilst gulping down a bottle himself. Harry was grateful for the water, although he had only been standing on the stage watching it had been very hot and he was thirsty.
“Even if he did it would be very hard on him. Here he is still Draco Malfoy the Death Eater.”
“You mean you are ok with me and Draco?” Harry was astounded, he was sure Ginny would have been as upset as Ron.
Its Christmas at Malfoy Manor and Draco has a surprise up his sleeve for Harry.
Harry was now wondering if a surprise party was such a good idea. “Umm…..maybe?”
His bedroom was not the biggest in the house but he had turned the small room next to it into a master bathroom with a walk-in closet. He set his wine down on the vanity unit and stripped off to take a shower, one of the few things he had insisted on when he was having the house remodeled was for a huge walk in shower, after so many years of sharing cramped, cold bathrooms at Hogwarts he wanted to enjoy a shower in comfort. He spent a good ten minutes under the hot water, easing the crick in his neck and the aches in his shoulders from all the report writing he had completed that day, then flung on a pair of sweatpants and his old Gryffindor Quidditch jersey and headed downstairs to the study.
The shower had helped to relax the tenseness from his shoulders but he still felt like he’d been kicked in the head by a hippogriff. He pulled on some old sweatpants and a long sleeved t-shirt and flopped back into bed, Kreacher had obviously been back whilst Harry had been in the shower as a new steaming cup of coffee sat on the bedside cabinet. He pushed the pillows up on the headboard to drink his coffee but something hard was pressing into his back making him very uncomfortable. He reached round and pulled out his phone. Another three missed calls and another text message from Draco. Harry knew he had to read the messages however much he didn’t want to, so with a shaking hand he unlocked the phone and opened up the message thread he had with Draco.
When they reached the head of the line Luna went through first followed by Ron. As Ron walked through the metal detector the Goyle lookalike yanked him back pulling out Ron’s wand from the pocket of his jacket.
“Come on Potter, let’s get this over with.”
“Sure,” Harry pulled the blanket from the back of the sofa over them grateful that it wasn’t full of dust. “As long as you don’t snore.”
Harry didn’t know much about music but he had to agree that the song was beautiful, and it made sense that Draco would write something so heartfelt about his beloved school house and the childhood friend who had always been there for him. The stage erupted into noise and light as the band launched into their final song, and was amazing to see all the lights from the crowd’s phones from up on the stage. The band took their last bow and the houselights came up bringing the show to a close. Draco slung and arm around both Harry and Pansy as they walked back to his dressing room, Pansy talking nonstop the whole way about Draco, the show and of course her anti-splitting trousers. Harry was very aware of Draco’s arm around his shoulder, Draco was radiating a lot of heat, he was soaked in perspiration, his hair was damp and tangled, beads of sweat rolling down his face. Harry wanted to lean up and lick them as they trailed down Draco’s neck. Back at the dressing room a large basket of fruit and snacks had been placed on the table along with several bottles of water, some Muggle canned drinks, two bottles of red wine and wine glasses.
Harry reversed the spell with a big grin on his face. “Remember when I hit you with that spell at Dueling Club in second year?”
“What’s that?” Ron asked pointing at the grey doorway.
“Thank you Kreacher,” Harry said. “Could you pour Nev a glass of wine?”
Although Harry’s wounds were healing Hermione still didn’t think he should travel so he was staying at Malfoy Manor with Draco, who was now freely apperating back and forward to London. When Kreacher had learned of Harry’s injuries the elf had descended on the Manor to take care of Harry, and was now managing the resident house elves, berating them for their lack of care for the Manor and grounds. Draco said the Manor had never looked so clean and tidy as it did under Kreacher’s rule.
Harry joined Draco on one of the sofas, it was big enough for them to lay together spooning.
Harry stared at the report form in front of him. He’d been staring at it for thirty minutes and was no further forward in completing it than when he had arrived at the office that morning. Although he had always wanted to be an Auror he hated the paperwork part, he’d never been good at producing written work and at Hogwarts had relied on Hermione to correct his mistakes before he handed in his homework. With his mind on one of his two best friends he decided to see if Hermione wanted to go out and grab some coffee. Harry had soon discovered that Muggle coffee from an actual coffee shop was much better than the stuff the Ministry provided, and Harry had found several coffee shops around The Ministry where he could get his daily fix. Harry used his wand to tap the round disk on his desk saying
Harry smiled. “I have everything I need. I borrowed one of Hermione’s spells, this bag holds a lot more than it appears to.”
Pans, like you and me.”
“Really Harry, you should let him retire. He’s not safe on his feet!” Hermione admonished.
“Same thing I always did at school, I faked it. Got into a few sticky situations, almost got myself killed trying to use a hair dryer while sitting in the bath, but it all worked out eventually. The internet helped a lot.”
“You’re so damn sexy Harry,” Draco breathed against Harry’s lips “you’ve been driving me wild for years.”
“There is no specific law preventing it,” Hermione said, “I checked. Whilst it’s obviously frowned upon it’s not illegal under any wizard regulations.”
“Master Harry, sit up. Kreacher has brought Master Harry some water and coffee. Kreacher thinks Master Harry might have a headache this morning, Master Harry will need water.”
“I’m pretty well sloshed yes. I did tell you that I have a habit of drunk dialing.”
“That’s because I am.” Draco placed a hand under Harry’s chin and lifted his face until their eyes met. “I wrote that song about you Harry.
Harry gets to know Draco a little bit better - question is does he like the new Draco?
Harry maneuvered Draco to sit on the sofa and held him in his arms. “Tell me what happened.”
Pansy turned back to Draco and gasped in horror. “What is that garbage you are wearing? That shirt is ghastly. Take it off right now and I’ll burn it. I have made you some simply gorgeous and exclusive shirts.” She pulled out a black shirt from one of the bags, it shimmered in the lights and, rather than being a buttoned shirt, it was a tunic style with a wide deep V-neck. “Come on darling, try it on.”
“Are you sure?” Harry’s heart was beating hard in his chest, he had not had sex for a long time and he thought he might come there and then.
“So how was the concert?” Neville asked. "Did you enjoy it?"
Harry felt hot tears on his face.
“Just two more songs and we’re done.” Draco was breathing heavily, out of breath from the performance and the sweat poured off him. He ran a towel over his hair and dragged his fingers through it to untangle the knots. “Pans, these trousers are amazing, you are amazing.” He gave her a kiss on the cheek. “Gotta go, see you in ten minutes.”
Unfortunately Harry knew exactly which look Ron was referring to, he had seen it every day at Hogwarts.

Harry thought sourly.
“You’ve seen Malfoy since we left Hogwarts?” Harry asked Luna.
“Lumos Solem!”
“Are you sure you want to hang around?” Draco asked. “It’s fairly boring.”
Harry was miserable. Draco was leaving for a tour of Europe that morning and their last night together had been both passionate and emotional. Their parting that morning was sweet with kisses but ended with tears, both men had developed deep feeling for each other and the time until Draco returned seemed to be a lifetime.
Pansy Parkinson rushed into the room, she was just how Harry remembered her from school; haughty, hard faced and totally vacuous. She dropped the bags she was carrying and threw herself at Draco covering his face with kisses.
“It’s not that. I’m leaving tomorrow to go on tour for a few weeks, I have to be up really early and I still haven’t packed yet.”
“Not bloody likely,” Ron grunted, “I have no intention of ever seeing him again.”
Despite the fact he knew that the guilt was not his he couldn’t help but feel he was responsible for Hermione’s obvious distress.
Ron threw a pillow at Harry. “Piss off mate, I’m trying here, just leave his cock out of it.”
I hope you are enjoying this fic - please leave comments and feedback as they are much appreciated.
“Ron, the Yorkshires should be in the oven by now,” Hermione shouted from the kitchen. Although she left the actual cooking to Ron she presided over the preparation with a precise timetable and was unforgiving if the timings went astray. “And don’t leave Harry just standing there, take him into the living room.”
“It’s three in the morning Draco you jackass,” Harry yawned. “Are you drunk?”
“Yes. I think he’s the love of my life.”
“Hermione and I found some good Muggle coffee shops around the Ministry where we can get some real coffee.” Harry grinned. “Actually I found out about Lumos Solem in a Muggle coffee shop just before you left me the tickets!”
“No!” Harry shot up out of the chair. “That’s quite alright, thank you Walter. I should be going….reports to write and stuff. Right, gotta go, bye.”
Ron met him the other end with a huge smile on his face. “Alright mate?”
Draco’s long fingers gripped Harry’s shaft and began to stroke him, slowly slid them up his length, squeezing lightly when he reached the top before slowly sliding back down. Harry pulled Draco towards him, desperate to have more contact, placing his mouth on the slender neck he sucked at the white skin. Draco groaned, Harry felt the rumble from his throat beneath his lips making his cock jump in Draco’s hand. Still sucking at his neck Harry’s fingers fumbled to undo the buttons of Draco’s shirt. Draco froze.
“Occasionally I have a song that just flows and I write it in one go but usually it comes together in bits and pieces. I think of a lyric and scribble it down, my songs come from an idea and then I use some of the lyrics I already have.”
“Yes, he knew he was gay since he was a kid.”
, he thought.
“Thank you, it’s beautiful, and so thoughtful. It’s lovely isn’t it Ron?” Ron gave a slight nod but continued to stare stonily at Harry. “Ron! This is ridiculous. Harry is your best friend.”
Another invitation and Harry learns the subtle art of texting
“Of course. You’ve been my best friend since we were eleven years old, and we’ve been through a lot together, me, you and Hermione.”
********************************************************************
Harry laughed. “Actually he’s still a dick, but a dick in a funny way.”
“It was a complete shock,” Hermione babbled. “Ron took me to Shell Cottage, said he had something to show me. We sat outside on the sand dunes, with a picnic, watching the waves, he pulled out the ring, got down on one knee and everything!”
“Just tell me.” Harry was getting irritated. “It can’t be that bad.”
“Girls are not really my type Harry, and thank you for the compliment.”
Harry panicked, he was already half aroused and if Draco took off his trousers in front of him Harry thought he might explode on the spot.
Draco brought over the tea and settled on the sofa with Harry pulling the throw over them both.
“That was nice of you, to bring those herbs for him.” Harry said once Draco had left to fetch the wine.
Harry cupped Draco’s face in his hands. “This isn’t a passing fancy. I think I’ve had feelings for you for a long time too but I just didn’t know what they were. The whole of Gryffindor thought I had a crush on you apparently, I guess they were right. I can’t promise that we will live happily ever after but I can promise that this is real for me and not just a thing.”
“How can I take Harry to the living room
“It’s our dog Fluffy's favourite stick, must have forgotten it was in his pocket.” Hermione grabbed Ron’s sleeve and pulled him away from the entrance. “We’ll just take it back to the car.”
is for your emerald green eyes, for the boy who never gave up, for the boy who gave me hope, for the boy that saved me.”
“He was forced into becoming a Death Eater Ron,” Hermione said. “You know that.”
“Come on, thirty minutes won’t hurt, and they have those almond pastries you love.”
Hermione was perched on the edge of the sofa, sitting on her hands and it seemed like she was quivering.
“Hi Pans, it’s good to see you too.” Draco laughed pealing Pansy off him. “Good journey?”
“How is your mother, is she still at Malfoy Manor?”
“No you weren’t,” Hermione said crossly, “we checked.”
“Draco darling!”
“I tried Harry, I tried to talk to him he just wouldn’t listen, you know how he gets.” Hermione said between sobs. “He’s still so angry about Fred that he just won’t listen to reason. He can’t see past the Draco he knew from Hogwarts. It makes me so angry to see him treating you like this, we argued for hours.”
“The fuck it doesn’t,” Harry felt his temper rising, “why did my scar react when I grabbed you?”
“Too many people have been hurt or killed by magic. My father is dead, my mother is an outcast, Snape and Dumbledore are dead, Crabbe, Fred, Cedric, Mad Eye, Lupin, Siruis, Tonks, all dead, you almost died, the list goes on and on,” Draco whispered, tears slipping down his face. “All because of magic. Magic is evil.”
The party went on through the afternoon and well into the night. Ron had set up broomstick races on the baby broomsticks, seeing Hagrid trying to fly on a broomstick meant for a child was hilarious, and everyone cheered when Hermione won the race. Ron had also created a ‘bucking broomstick’ that tried to throw the rider off, the aim was to stay on the broomstick as long as possible before getting thrown off. Harry lasted about three seconds, Draco did much better but Neville won by hanging on for a whole twenty five seconds. Draco laughed and said it was down to all the years of experience Neville had of trying not to fall off his broom, which earned him a tickling jinx from Neville. Harry had booked a band for the night, he was slightly worried that it would annoy Draco but he saw he was having fun dancing with Luna, twirling around, hands in the air laughing at some silly thing she said. The drinks were flowing, food weighing down the tables and as the moon rose more fireworks lit up the sky.
Harry switched his phone to hands free.
“Music is his way of dealing with things, his emotional outlet.” Harry smiled, “You should see him on stage, he’s incredible.”
“I’m pumping you faster now Harry, you are so close, I can feel your cock pulsating, ready to come all over me.”
tissues” and a box came flying out of the bedroom into his hand.
“How completely bizarre,” Hermione muttered, “I should report it to The Ministry, might be a wizard gone rouge and trying to expose the wizarding world. That would be a massive cleanup job for the Obliviators.”
– rock track
Hermione had refused to have a house elf so the couple prepared their own meals, and Harry had to admit that Ron was actually a good, but messy, cook. Hermione, on the other hand, was not as gifted in the kitchen much to her annoyance and to Ron’s delight.
Harry was dragged awake by the sound of his phone ringing in the middle of the night. He fumbled to pick it up in the dark nearly dropping it on the floor, but his heart stopped when he saw it was Draco calling. It was three in the morning, people only called at that time when there was an emergency, maybe he was sick or had been injured. His heart was pounding as he accepted the call.
Harry grinned sheepishly. “Well it can’t hurt to let him know he has friends here in the wizarding world.”
“Are you happy Harry?” The question came out of nowhere and took Harry by surprise.
“I didn’t mean just me. We could get help from the Order, we could go and talk to Dumbledore –“
“Hermione!”
The record label had been pushing Draco and the rest of the band to finish the album, they had booked studio time for the band to go in and record despite the fact that the tracks were barley written. There was also an aggressive publicity campaign, the label wanted to keep the momentum going, so had booked the band for a seemingly endless round of photo shoots, guest appearances and interviews for Muggle TV, radio and magazines. Draco was either out at an event, in the studio writing and recording, or, if he found the time, sleeping. Draco had invited Harry to a few events, which Harry had duly attended, but it broke his heart to see his boyfriend paraded around like a pet kneazle in the name of entertainment. When Draco was on stage he was magnificent as always, in interviews he was engaging, intelligent, charming and he always made time to speak to the fans that lined up to meet him wherever he went. It was only Harry that saw the mask fall when Draco got home, saw him staying up until dawn to try to get lyrics written or learned, saw him skip meals because he was running from one interview to the next, saw him fall into his bed exhausted after being up for thirty hours straight in the recording studio.
“Then I suggest you find the right time.”
“You seem to be carrying a lot of guilt Harry.”
Harry pushed Draco hard. “Run. Go to the Leaky Cauldron.”
Lumos Solem!”
, Harry thought.
Peace and love xx
, interesting article on the gulping plimplies plague, who knew they only appeared once every fifty years?”
“Well he does have more to feel guilty about.” Ron held up his hands at the murderous look on Harry’s face “Ok, ok. I’m sorry. Look, I’m willing to give him a chance but the second he goes all Malfoy on me I’m done.”
“Mine too,” Draco agreed. “Malfoy Christmases were really prim and proper, really boring now I think about it.”
“Neither I or my mother were exactly welcome in the wizard community nor were we able to use magic. I started going out to Muggle music concerts, met my bandmates and I decided it was best for me to just leave the wizarding world behind.”
I was always disappointed that Neville and Luna didn't end up together, and having them together in this story didn't work either :(
Harry could not for the life of him think why a Muggle magazine would contain a wizard spell. There were still many dark wizards on the run and if they were trying to infiltrate the Muggle world it would be disastrous.
Harry laughed at the parting comment. Neville had a way of making Harry feel better, he never allowed Harry to be ashamed of any of his thoughts or feelings. Out of all of his friends Neville had been the one Harry had come out to first, he knew that Neville wouldn’t judge him and would be happy to just listen, letting Harry talk his way through his complicated emotions.
“This is where I keep all my random scraps of lyrics, and reminders from my past.”
“That I haven’t told them about Draco, and I don’t want them to find out by accident.”
“Quiet day in with Draco, he needs a rest so I’m going to give him a pampering day.”
“I have one more gift to handout,” Bill said with his arm around Fleur. “This is a special gift, it’s the gift of a new life.”
“He offered a Quidditch masterclass run by Ginny as an apology, although he didn’t ask her first so now she’s mad at him too.”
“You’ll never believe it,” Ron said, “He’s a singer in a Muggle rock band!”
Neville rose to give Harry a hug. Neville had grown tall and, although he had lost all of his childhood puppy fat, he was a large man, Harry always felt rather small next to Neville.
Harry grinned as he headed towards home, the new Draco was not only hot but he was fun to be with, and Harry liked the new Draco very much indeed.
A look of sadness clouded Draco’s eyes. “My parents use it to clean up after the Dark Lord has finished playing with people.”
Even though Harry had seen the large crowds on the videos, he was still surprised at the sheer number of people cramming onto the floor. “No shit, this is a bigger crowd than even the Weird Sisters get.”
Late night call from a drunk Draco???? Yes please ;)
The week passed slowly; Harry was becoming more disillusioned with being an Auror with each passing day, far from the exciting vision he had of secret missions and daring raids most of his time was spent tracking owls, reviewing tracing spell data and writing dreary reports. It wasn’t that he hated it, he just didn’t love it the way he thought he would. In complete contrast Hermione was in her element with her job in The Department of Mysteries, and Harry wouldn’t be surprised if she ended up as Minister for Magic, she was cut out for the politics and bureaucracy of the Ministry but Harry wasn’t. The only things that Harry looked forward to on a daily basis were his messages and calls from Draco. Their schedules were somewhat offset, Harry worked a day shift whereas Draco’s day tended to start at four in the afternoon but they managed to find the time to talk on the phone every night and sent messages constantly through the day. Draco was due back home the following Friday and Harry couldn’t wait to see him. Harry had not yet broached the topic of his relationship with Draco with Hermione or Ron, he was not sure how they would react, Ron in particular, so he had said nothing but felt a coward for not being honest with them. As Neville had suggested Harry had asked Luna if he could book a session with her at her mind-healing clinic, and whilst she had initially declined, as Harry was a friend, she finally agreed when Harry said he needed her advice as a friend. She refused to see him at the clinic and was coming over to Grimmauld Place that evening for a late dinner to talk and advise him as ‘a friend not a client’.
“We’ve talked about this Ronald,” Hermione scolded giving Ron a stern look, “we are here for Harry.”
Harry was mumbling now, completely lost in the moment, Draco lapped his tongue around the swollen head one last time then released Harry from his mouth. He shimmied up the bed to straddle Harry, grasping Harry’s throbbing hardness in his hand with his own, pumping their cocks together fast and hard. Harry writhed on the bed, hands gripping at the bedclothes beneath him as his climax raced towards him. Draco cried out as his cock pulsated, his come splattered on to Harry’s stomach, long strings of white beading on his skin. Harry thrust his hips forward one last time and let out a guttural growl as he released his hot come over Draco’s hand mingling with Draco’s spent seed, his body bucking with the force of his orgasm.
Peace and love xx
***********************************************************************
“Want some company?”
Harry smirked as he sent his message.
“Stop calling it that!”
“Holy fuck Harry, I’ve wanted this for so long.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Those girls are crazy. A few nights back a girl threw a bra onstage and it landed on Dan’s guitar head. He played a whole track with a neon pink bra hanging off his guitar.”
“You are disturbing my inner peace Potter,” Draco growled. “Do something useful, go to the shops and get something for dinner, I’ve not had time to go yet.”
“Does that happen a lot? Fans wanting photo’s?” Harry asked.
Harry laughed. “I don’t think I ever had a girl throw a bra at me, jinxes and hexes yes but never a bra.”
“Sure,” Ron smirked, “all that stalking him around, constantly talking about him, not obsessed at all.”
“I missed you too Gryffindork,” Draco murmured, placing his lips on Harry’s, “more than you will ever know.”
“No!” Draco snatched his hands away and shot up off the sofa. “For fucks sake Harry don’t you get it? I can’t do any of those things, I can’t do anything but play my part, do what I’ve been asked to do.”
“The snake is for Slytherin, hawthorn for your wand.”
“I’d love to.”
“I’ll talk to him Harry, once he’s calmed down.”
Draco gave Harry a skeptical look. “You are up to something, I can see it on your face. What have you done?”
Peace and love xx
Harry got his wallet out but Draco motioned for him to put it away.
The bed shifted as a warm body pressed closer to him and a hand closed over his own squeezing it tightly.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “Goes all Malfoy?”
“Then I will look out for you Darcy. It’s going to be a great show.”
“Harry? Harry?” Draco’s voice was trembling. “I thought I’d lost you, I thought….”
“I wonder if the use of a wizard spell in a Muggle band name is permitted?” Hermione speculated. “I should probably check the laws on that.”
Harry was confused. “Why didn’t you make it, you were always one of the best at potions.”
“Fuck,” Harry gasped as Draco pulled Harry’s shirt out from his trousers and ran his fingers up his spine.
“You are just breathtaking.” Harry reached out and ran his hand over the long blond hair, it was as soft and silky as it looked, and it ran through his fingers like liquid gold. Draco’s hair had always captivated him, even at school Harry had found himself staring at the blond locks, wanting to stroke it, feel it under his fingers.
Harry felt his face flush red as he pulled his own wand out from under his hoodie.
“That’s great Harry, you deserve to be with someone who makes you happy.”
“Yes!” Hermione bounded up from the sofa holding out her left hand where a ring sparkled. “Ron asked me to marry him and I said yes!”
“Yes, I like him. I like him a lot.”
Another pause.
Harry laughed, elves did not get the concept of sarcasm apparently. “I’ll just go back to the library.”
“Harry can I have a word?” Draco put his arm around Harry and steered him to an empty table. “You ok Harry? You look a bit unsteady.”
Draco maneuvered Harry to the street and hailed a passing cab.
Harry lost the tiny piece of control he had left over his temper. “I’ll tell you what is fucked up,” he shouted. “Fucked up is when your best friend thinks calling my boyfriend a Death Eater to my face is acceptable. Fucked up is when your best friend is acting like an utter twat because I’m in love with a guy who you cannot even give a single second to trying to get to know. Fucked up is when your best friend puts his own bigoted views above our friendship.”
“Of course Master Harry,” Kreacher started to bow again but caught Harry’s disapproving look and decided against it. “Master Harry is a very busy and important man.”
Draco hugged Harry tighter. “I thought you might like to stay over.”
Draco got out of the bed, giving Harry a very nice view of his pert arse, pulled out a big box from the walk in closet and placed it on the bed.
Harry felt his face flood with heat as the Slytherin contingent broke into sniggers, including Draco who formed his thumb and forefinger into an L and placed it on his forehead mouthing ‘loser’ as he did so.
“Yes, it’s mistletoe,” Draco smirked. “So hurry up and kiss me Gryffindork.”
Draco sighed and pushed his plate away. “Like I said it’s complex. I have done a lot of soul searching over the last five years and I have worked through a lot of shit that was going on in my head. Daddy issues, very clichéd but very true in my case. Anyway, it’s taken me a long time but I finally feel that I’m the person I
Ron made a beeline to the bar. “If I have to speak to Malfoy I need a fucking drink first.”
“He kept you locked in a dungeon!” Ron exclaimed. “Why would you write to that tosser?”
“In the band logo? I thought green roses represented fertility.”
“It frightens him now.” Harry thought back to the sobbing man he had held in his arms the night before. “He saw a lot more dark magic than we did, he saw people tortured, and worse, in front of him, he was forced to kill people to save his family, it traumatized him, left him with deep psychological scars. To Draco magic is a tool for inflicting pain and suffering, he can’t see past that.”
Harry knew Draco was right but the rightness didn’t help with the pain and the tears that flowed down Harry’s face stung with the bitterness of it all.
album:
It's Ron and Hermione's engagement party where Harry has to face the whole Weasley family.
Draco’s laughter went on for a while. “That is simply adorable.”
“And I recall you crying like a baby when Hermione punched you in third year,” Ron said, a big smile on his face, “that’s what being hit by a girl is like.”
was at the Manor. Even this far away I could hear the screaming. I would bring my guitar sometimes, when I thought I wouldn’t get caught, and sit here and play.”
Ron grimaced. “Do not ever remind me of that again. Lavender was an absolute nightmare as a girlfriend, but I kind of miss her silly giggles and squeals.”
Neville shifted in his seat. “Actually I have. I looked him up on the Muggle internet. He acted the same as the old Malfoy, kind of arrogant.”
Harry was happy to be outside even though his fingers were turning numb from the cold, he had been cooped up inside for days. It was so tranquil here, as if the Manor was muffled from the world outside, Harry could imagine Draco as a child having fun, playing in the fountain with his friends, flying around on the baby broomsticks that most wizard children owned.
Peace and love xx
Draco wiggled slightly on Harry’s lap. “So do you.”
The crowd cheered and suddenly there was Malfoy. He was wearing a dark grey shirt, partially unbuttoned as usual, skintight black jeans and dragon scale black boots. With only the tiny white bulbs backlighting him he look ethereal, he raised his arms and bowed his head, blond hair covering his face. The whole crowd raised their arms in salute and as Malfoy screamed the words to the opening song into the microphone the entire place erupted.
“No house elves in the Muggle world so I had to learn. I actually enjoy it but it’s much nicer cooking for someone else than just for myself.” Draco poured two cups of coffee. “I even ground the coffee beans myself.”
“You feel amazing,” Harry sighed.
Harry laughed. “Fuck off Malfoy.” Harry had been tracking an owl from a known dark wizard but had somehow managed to place the tracing spell on a random pigeon sending the Auror team on a wasted mission to intercept the startled bird on a bench in Reagents Park.
’, and Harry couldn’t help but wonder how different things could have been at Hogwarts if that Draco had been the Draco he was now.
Draco dragged Harry to his feet. “Bedroom is this way.” He looked at Harry’s small book bag. “I have things you can use, pj’s and stuff.”
Harry’s stomach rolled with anxiety. “Do you really think he’ll come round? He was so angry.”
“That’s his stage act, I think the Draco on stage is based on the old Draco. He never wanted the fame, he’s not that cocky, conceited tosser anymore, so he puts on the old Draco on stage to be able to perform. The real Draco is nothing like that. I promise you Nev, he’s a totally different person.”
“Thank Merlin. So who is it? Tell us everything.” Hermione said.
“Right, you two are not leaving this room until you sort this shit out.” Hermione snapped.
Harry finished his wine, went up to bed and lay contemplating the text message exchange with Draco. He had actually enjoyed bantering with him and was surprised that Draco had a sense of humour that wasn’t just mean and nasty as it had been at school.
“How’s Hogwarts?” Harry asked. Neville was studying under Professor Sprout to become next herbology professor when she retired. “Kids still giving you a hard time?”
“Well,” said Hermione, “that was an experience. I don’t think my eardrums will ever recover.”
Draco shook his head. “Thank you but I can’t, I need to go home.”
Draco obediently pulled the sweater over his head; it was at least two sizes too big for him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Exactly Potter, he would have taken my feelings and used them for something dark and evil.” Draco’s voice hitched and Harry realized he was crying again. “I couldn’t let that happen.”
“Exactly. I wrote that song about coming back from the brink and I though it sounded cool as a band name.”
“Just when I thought you couldn’t get more attractive, you add cooking to the list of things you are good at.”
“Hi Hermione.” Harry shrank back in his chair ready for the worst.
“I have a plan, I’ve been making some enquiries, I should know for sure in the next few months. In the meantime I intend to spend some time with my boyfriend.”
“What is it?” Harry asked.
as he did so, the disk began to emit a rather annoying tune, which sounded like someone playing a harp with a beater’s bat, whilst he waited for Hermione to accept his call. The communication disks were a new installation in the Ministry, the flying paper messages had been abandoned after an unfortunate incident where the message network had been compromised and all the messages had ended up on the wrong desks. There had been some rather embarrassed faces in The Ministry that day and the paper messages had been swiftly replaced with the Talkkeys.
“Seems he wants to at least have contact with the wizarding world now,” Harry said.
“Great,” Harry said. “Kreacher made it especially for you.”
“To be honest, I’m really struggling. It’s not how I imagined being an Auror would be. It’s, well, boring.”
Harry did love Camden Market. The place was crowded with hundreds of market stalls selling everything from clothing, to second hand books and vinyl records, to bric-a-brac, to food, to handmade jewelry. It was bright, vibrant, and exotic; Harry had never seen anything like it and was fascinated by the mix of Muggles that wove between the stalls or haggled with stall owners over the price of their wares. Draco held Harry’s hand as he led him through the maze of small booths stopping every now and then to examine a piece of jewelry or an item of clothing. Several fans recognized Draco and asked for photos or autographs, Harry was annoyed when it happened to him in the wizard world but Draco was always polite, asking their names and saying a few words before moving on. Harry was truly amazed at the change in Draco. The sneering, arrogant, spiteful bully was totally gone and had been replaced with a generous, sensitive, caring man. Harry thought back to their lunch at the bistro where Draco had said that he had now become ‘
Kreacher scurried from the kitchen. “Mistress Luna is here Master Harry.”
’ He hoped Draco was now trying to work out if Harry was joking or not.
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry. “The memory will be forgotten but my feelings won’t, I’ve had them for years, and trust me Harry when I say if I ever have to choose between you and Him it will always be you. Always.” Draco’s own tears mingled with Harry’s as he pressed his cheek against Harry’s. “I’m yours Harry, I always have been and always will be, and maybe someday we can be Draco and Harry again but right now it has to be Malfoy and Potter.”
“Well, I was pretty sure you’d say yes,” Ron said sheepishly, “but I wasn’t sure about Harry.”
“I’m a Slytherin, I’m good at deflecting.” Draco stood up and walked towards the battered sofa, his back to Harry. “The point is what do you think would have happened if he had found out about my feelings for you?”
“You have no idea Harry, no idea.” Pansy sighed dramatically, “I worked all through the night to get these outfits finished for Draco.”
Hermione sighed. “It will take time but he will get there eventually.”
“More so now, as the band has gotten bigger there are many more fans.”
Harry laughed. “I thought you were with Pansy Parkinson at school?”
Harry guided Hermione to her chair and gave her a bunch of paper napkins, she mopped her eyes and took a large gulp of her coffee.
Harry opened the envelope. It held a small white card with silver print.
Harry couldn’t judge Draco’s mood from the texts, and he couldn’t think of a really good reason to refuse.
Draco returned with a bottle of wine and some glasses. “Neville did you know you have a clump of gillyweed on the back of your neck?”
“It’s my hand on you Harry,” Draco’s growled, “it’s my hand that is caressing you. My fingers wrapped around your delicious length, my thumb smearing your pre come across the engorged head.”
“Malfoy was a Death Eater, that’s not my definition of sensitive!” Ron snapped.
curse in order to bend him to the task of killing Dumbledore. No wonder Draco had now turned his back on magic, Harry thought, he had seen enough dark magic to last a lifetime.
After dinner came the usual round of pickup Quidditch. Harry, George and Draco played against Ginny, Ron and Charlie, it was a hard fought game and by the end everyone had lost count of the score so they called it a draw. Under Harry’s advice Draco had bought his guitar with him, he played some Weird Sisters songs that got everyone up and dancing, and then some of his own songs, which everyone declared to be fantastic.
Draco had prepared eggs benedict, a huge pile of bacon, French toast, sliced fruits with yogurt and a carafe of fresh coffee.
“Holy fucking shit!” Harry sank back in the sofa. “That was amazing.”
“They don’t know that. I just need to pop around the corner to put your wand in my purse.”
“Come to bed Harry.”
“I’m a bit nervous to tell the truth, the kids kind of scare me. They mess about in class, sneak around at night, do stupid things and never do as they are told. We weren’t like that were we?”
Harry toyed nervously with his beer mat. “It’s complicated.”
Harry uncorked the vial and brought it to his lips, it smelled disgusting, like rotten cabbage and a week dead niffler. He gagged at the odour. “Are you sure you aren’t trying to poison me Draco?”
“Did you catch up with him?” Ron asked.
“I assume by the vacant expression on your face that you are trying to remember how to write your name Potter. Very taxing on such a small brain I’m sure.”
“This is us making happy memories.”
Harry sighed. “Yes he does, I think he feels more guilt than me.”
“What?” Three sets of eyes bored into Harry’s face.
“Fuck Draco,” Harry breathed, ‘I did this to you.”
He grabbed his book bag and set off towards Camden Town hoping the forty minute walk would help to clear his mind. It was a beautiful evening, cool and dry, and Harry enjoyed the freedom of walking rather than using Muggle or wizard transportation. Ron was still not talking to Harry, Hermione had been trying to get Ron to see sense but so far he was being resolute in his decision to cut ties with Harry. Hermione was sure he would come around in time and had advised Harry against trying to contact Ron, she felt it would be best to wait for Ron to reach out to him. Harry knew that was the most sensible route but he missed his friend and wanted things to go back to normal as soon as possible. It reminded Harry of the time Ron had left Harry and Hermione when they were on the run hunting Horcruxes; Ron had stormed out in a temper leaving Harry and Hermione to continue without him, but he had returned once he realized he had overreacted.
“I love Luna, I really do, but all that talk of wrackspurts and nargles would have driven me crazy.”
‘That’s what I’m worried about,” Hermione muttered under her breath. “That’s exactly what I’m worried about.”
Draco shrugged. “It wasn’t the best time of my life. Then after the trial I was sentenced to a year of house arrest at the manor so I just kept on playing and began writing songs.”
magazine.”
“Bloody hell mate, that was all a bit horcrux pendant.” Ron said.
Harry picked up a small grey rock. “What’s this?”
“Didn’t you see him on that stage strutting around like one of the peacocks from Malfoy Manor?” Ron snorted. “Same old Malfoy, center of attention and loving every minute of it.”
“What about now? Is he still a mini Lucius?”
Draco’s body relaxed but the anxiety was still evident on his pale face.
Harry had been so angry when he got home that even Kreacher stayed out of his way, cowering in his nest of bedding in the kitchen scullery. Harry had shouted, screamed, thrown things around but now he just sat on his bed, head in hands crying. He and Ron had so much history together; they’d grown up together, shared a dorm together, studied together, fought together, almost died together, he was family, yet Ron was happy to throw that all away just because he didn’t like who Harry was dating. Harry wiped his eyes and sent a message to Draco.
Ron grumbled a response under his breath that sounded like ‘treacherous fucking Malfoy wanker’.
Harry smiled and typed his response.
“I’m fine thank you Harry, I’m not a big drinker.”
“Bloody hell mate,” Ron said, “it’s like you are obsessed with him. Next you will be telling us you know what colour his underwear is.” Ron narrowed his eyes. “You don’t know what colour his underwear is do you?”

Peace and love xx
“I think it went up the chimney,” Harry said, “and your shoes are still on your feet so it’s all fine.”
“What does all this stuff do?” Harry asked in amazement. “I thought a laptop was high tech but this is incredible.”
Draco sat down next to Harry hugging him close. “You are my heart Harry, my beautiful Gryffindork.”
“The ones that shouted Lumos Solem?”
Harry slumped back in his chair closing his DADA book with a loud thump. He didn’t exactly know why he was so angry; he felt like he had been constantly on edge for the last month, he knew he was treating his friends badly but what with captaining the Quidditch team, trying to obtain Slughorn’s memory and Draco using the Room of Requirement for Merlin knew what, he was constantly stressed out. His stomach lurched at the thought of Draco. Draco was at the center of it all, and whilst he had protested the contrary to his friends he was coming to believe that he was actually obsessed with the blonde boy. The Slytherin filled his thoughts in the day and his dreams at night; he was acutely aware of his presence, could feel his pull of his energy whenever he was in the same room, and some mornings he woke with his name on his lips. He felt like he was losing his mind.
Harry waited a good fifteen minutes before he dared knock on the dressing room door. He had downed two shots of Muggle whiskey in that time, but he was still somewhat shaken, and he hoped to fuck that Draco was fully dressed.
The audience had started to move towards the exits and the security were ushering people out into the foyer.
As the day drew to a close Bill gathered everyone around the Christmas tree.
Draco.”
*********************************************************
Draco burst out laughing.
Draco wound his arms around Harry drawing him closer and placed a string of feathery light kisses along Harry’s jaw and down his neck, it was so sensual that he thought he might come there and then. Harry gasped and pushed himself against the Slytherin, Harry could feel Draco’s hardness pressing against his own, it was a new but highly erotic sensation.
“Yes, well then, put it on,” Molly said, “I had to guess at the size.”
Peace and love xx
“I cast the spell on the leather myself, they won’t split I promise.”
“Master Neville, such a pleasure to host you again, I hope your grandmother is well?”
************************************************
“I’m so close Harry, so very close.” Draco rasped into Harry’s ear.
“Yes, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE!” Ron bellowed.
“I’m not hungry.” Harry continued to glare at the Slytherins who were still laughing at him. All except Draco who had his head down, shoulders hunched, toying with the food on his plate. Whatever Snape had said to him earlier in the day had obviously troubled the boy in some way.
They had almost reached the halfway point of the alley when a figure stepped out in front of them, wand pointed at Harry.
“We’ll be there,” Hermione said ignoring her boyfriend’s protests. “Like you said it might be fun.”
“There’s more in the potion cellar,” Draco’s voice was now even closer, right next to Harry’s ear, and fingers brushed lightly over his brow.
Harry reached under his pillow, pulled out his phone and switched it to silent mode. The resulting silence was an immense relief. He looked groggily at the screen, eight text messages and twelve missed calls, all from Draco. Harry groaned again as the events of last night came rushing back. He was horrified at what he had done, he had kissed Draco, properly kissed him, with lips and tongue. Harry flopped back on the pillow phone still in his hand. He didn’t want to look at the messages Draco had sent, his stomach flipped over as he thought about what they might say.
Harry knew Neville was referring to Draco’s affiliation to Voldemort and the fact he had fought with the Death Eaters at the Battle of Hogwarts.
Draco raised himself up on an elbow and smirked at Harry. “Scared Potter?”
– hard rock track
I hope you are enjoying this fic - please leave comments and feedback as they are much appreciated.
“Is that a message from him?” Ron said flatly.
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco and hugged him tightly. Draco’s hands caressed up and down Harry’s back, he ran them through Harry’s hair and ran his fingers across Harry’s cheek.
“You are so beautiful.” The words tumbled out of Harry’s mouth.
I hope you are enjoying this fic - please leave comments and feedback as they are much appreciated.
Harry felt the heat of a blush rise up his neck. “Thanks.” He hid his red face behind the menu.
It took a good thirty seconds before Malfoy replied.
“Then you will have to change that perception, you have me pretty much convinced,” Neville smiled. “If you truly want this to work then make it work.”
Harry took a sip of wine, it was delicious, Draco clearly knew his wines. “Yes, I mean the paperwork sucks but the rest is great.”
“You can’t really think Malfoy has changed?” Ron asked. "I mean he can't be that bloody different."
“Yes Harry,” Draco said as Harry stared at him open mouthed, “I’m a Slytherin, an ex-Death Eater and gay. The trifecta of bad shit.”
A good old fashioned wand fight!
“The Ministry reversed the spell, you can do as much magic as you like.”
Harry lost sight of the blonde as the crowds broke up, he too wondered what had brought Malfoy to the Ministry but the rumbling in his stomach reminded him of the reason he was in the foyer. He made his way out onto the street and ordered a sandwich and a coffee at the small bistro a few streets over. As he ate Harry thought back to the last time he had seen Malfoy in the Ministry. It was just after the war, during the trials of the captured Death Eaters at the Wizengamot, where Harry had testified at both Malfoy and his mother Narcissa’s hearings. It had shocked many that Harry had spoken in defense of the Malfoys, especially the Weasley family who were still grieving the loss of Fred, it was one of the many things he and Ginny had argued about, but Harry knew it was the right thing to do. Malfoy had the chance to hand Harry over to Voldemort at Malfoy Manor but had feigned ignorance in identifying him that had allowed Harry and his friends to escape. Harry saw the recognition in Malfoy’s eyes, and knew the Slytherin had deliberately defied the Death Eaters by not confirming it was Harry in front of him. Harry had also taken Malfoy’s wand, the wand that had ultimately defeated Voldemort, and whilst Malfoy had made a show of trying to hold on to it Harry had always felt that it had been willingly handed over. Narcissa had also bravely rebelled against Voldemort by declaring Harry dead whilst she knew he still lived, and in return had asked Harry to help save her son.
Harry discovers what Draco has been up to since leaving Hogwarts - and it rocks :)
“You have to do it Master Draco,” the little elf squeaked, “or the Dark Master will hurt Mistress Malfoy.”
“Seriously Potter?” Draco laughed. “That was your solution?”
Harry stared at the piece of paper. “This is my favourite song from the album. It’s so full of emotion, you sing this one like you are singing from your heart.”
Harry remembered the gift he had brought with him. “I have something for you.
***********************************************
“It was very good Mal….” Hermione stumbled over the name, “…Draco. You are a talented performer.”
Harry replaced the chess pieces to their starting positions on the board. “We haven’t spoken about it.”
Harry nodded. “Yes, he needed to be something other than Draco Malfoy the Death Eater.”
“This is perfect on the sofa, under a throw, watching a movie weather,” Draco said. He chucked the TV remote at Harry. “Pick a movie while I make a pot of tea.”
The Three Broomsticks was still the same as Harry remembered from his school days. It was insufferably warm with a fire blazing in the hearth, even although it was a warm September evening, and the wood smoke cast a misty haze across the whole room. The inn had changed hands after the war and was now owned by Dean Thomas who’s injuries sustained during the Battle of Hogwarts had effectively shattered his dream of becoming a professional Quidditch player. Madam Rosmerta had sold the business to Dean, unable to face working there after the part she played in helping smuggle cursed objects intended to kill Dumbledore. Even though she was under the
“Do you know what I’m doing right now? Even while I’m talking to you.”
Harry continued to stare at the photo of Malfoy. His hair was longer than when he had last seen him at his trial at the Wizengamot, but it was still the same shade of platinum blonde, and he was as pale and slim as ever. He was pictured wearing a black shirt with several buttons undone exposing an expanse of white chest, and tight black jeans that hung very low on his narrow hips. He looked sexy as hell but the thing Harry noticed immediately was the fact that Malfoy was smiling. The smile totally transformed his face, he looked relaxed and happy, a million miles away from the scowling boy he had known at school.
“That was about his traitorous Slytherin heart,” Ron snorted. “Typical Malfoy, Slytherin to the core”
“The curse story is still doing the rounds.”
“What will you do? You are not seriously thinking of going on tour with Draco?” Hermione said shooting Draco a sharp look who raised his eyebrows in return.
“I never really had a proper Christmas until I went to Hogwarts.”
Draco yawned. “Not tonight, I’m exhausted, I need to go to bed. That can be a talk for another night.”
“Hogwarts in an excellent school. Many of you have parents or siblings who completed their education here, but you will need to work hard to pass your O.W.L.S, and some of you may be lucky enough to go on to pass N.E.W.T.S. Be sure to study in your spare time, make use of the library and complete your homework on time. Dedication, commitment and application is what is required to make witches and wizards of you all.
“I heard Malfoy was at the Ministry today, caused quite a stir in the teacher’s lounge. What was he doing there? And what has he been up to the last five years?”
“Hey you,” Harry said as he accepted the call, “how was the show last night? Nottingham wasn’t it?”
Hi Hermione, I love your shoes,” Luna smiled, “but Ron you need to lose the wrackspurts round your head, they are making you very miserable.”
The discussion moved on to other topics. They spent the rest of the time drinking, talking and laughing about old times and new until the early hours. Neville left first, shortly followed by Luna, Hermione went to bed leaving Harry to have a final glass of firewhisky with Ron.
Harry knew there was no reasoning with Ron when he was in a rage. “Ok, I’m going, but Draco is my boyfriend and you are my best friend, I don’t want this to be a choice between you.”
“Come in Harry, I’m perfectly decent.” Draco called out.
Draco pulled away an apologetic smile on his face. “Whilst I find you irresistible I don’t think today is the right day my little Gryffindork.”
“See you Harry.”
“Late again Harry?”
Harry’s mind was racing trying to find a solution, he came up blank but if he could talk to Dumbledore he was sure they could come up with a plan to save all of them.
Harry gets some advice from Luna and a late night call from Draco
Walter brought up a new webpage with a large photo of the lead singer. Harry stared at the photo, he couldn’t quite comprehend what he was seeing, but a glance at the tagline under the photo confirmed it.
Harry had been home for a couple of hours and was clearing out one of the closed up bedrooms with the help of Kreacher, who wanted to keep everything even the two hundred broken twigs from an old broomstick, when his phone vibrated in his pocket. He pulled it out and was surprised to see a message from Draco.
“Pay no attention to them Harry, they are not worth it. Stupid little children.” Hermione patted Harry’s arm, “Just ignore them and eat your dinner.”
before boarding the mothership for home, he was sobbing.
“You should give it more time, you’ve only been working as an Auror for a year.”
“I’m worn out, the fashion industry is so very difficult, so draining. I work my fingers to the bone, the very bone of them, just to keep up. I’m just so in demand, my designs are so popular. I’m just a faded out wreak.”
Harry rolled his eyes, Hermione hadn’t changed one bit since their school days. She now worked in the Department of Mysteries, where she was permanently snowed under with research, and she loved it.
“Draco, I’m so sorry.” Tears formed in Harry’s own eyes as he realized the hopelessness of the situation. “But if you go through with it you might die or be given the Dementor’s kiss if you are caught.”
Harry hung his head, he couldn’t look Draco in the face.
“Err, I thought I might, I’ve never been to a Muggle concert. And the band is quite good, I watched a few videos, Malfoy can sing really well. Anyone want to come with me?”
The last message made Harry’s stomach clench, the words ‘we need to talk’ never led to anything good in his experience. He checked the call log, all the calls had been placed around the same time as the text messages. The phone vibrated in his hand and a new message alert from Draco appeared. Harry sighed as he realized that Draco would know Harry had now read the messages from the status indicator on the message thread. He had no real choice but to read the new message.
I really hope you enjoyed reading this story as much as I did writing it.
“You seeing anyone?” Harry blurted out.
Draco raised his eyes to meet Harry’s. “I never wanted to be a Death Eater, I hated Voldemort, he scared the motherfucking shit out of me. But my family was in too deep, we had to go along with it, fake it, or we would have been killed.”
The elf moved forward and placed a hand on Draco’s arm. “Is Master Draco sad? Tilly does not like to see Master so sad.”
The elf loved anything shiny and Hermione always bought a gift for him when she visited.
Harry noticed a bundle of letters addressed to Draco in Luna’s handwriting and next to it a plastic bag full of leaves, twigs and dried flowers.
Hermione gave Harry a withering look. “Absolutely not. We are not at Hogwarts anymore; you can write your own damn reports.”
Peace and love xx
“Went down the wrong way,” Harry gasped, “I’m fine.”
On the way home they are confronted by a familiar face.
“For the love of Merlin Potter, just fucking do it.”
‘You should never give up the one you love Harry, which is why Ron will come round in the end, because he loves you.”
“Of course my darling.” Draco rose from his seat, placed an arm around the girl and smiled as she aimed her phone at them.
“Draco I –“ Harry’s words were cut off as Draco leaned down and silenced him with a crushing kiss, his tongue pushing  into his mouth , sucking and nipping at the delicate skin of Harry’s lips. Harry moaned as Draco placed small kisses along Harry’s jawbone working towards the soft spot behind his ear, then kissed and sucked his way down Harry’s neck. He reached his collarbone, running his tongue along the bony ridge to the soft hollow where it met the shoulder, sucking hard. Harry arched his back as Draco’s kisses turned in to small bites working his way down his chest towards his nipple that hardened along with his cock. He sucked in a sharp breath when Draco took the nipple in his mouth rolling the hard nub of flesh between his lips, licking and sucking, and a hand trailed lightly across his stomach, a touch so light that it felt like a soft breeze on his skin. Draco’s fingers danced across the skin above the waistband of his sweatpants, Harry raised his hips to allow Draco to pull them off, a low moan escaped his lips as Draco removed the rest of his own clothing.
Draco was arriving back home tonight and Harry couldn’t wait to see him; the calls and text messages had been great but he needed the physical touch of Draco, needed them to be wrapped around each other, needed to be intimate with him. They had agreed to meet at Draco’s apartment, he wasn’t getting home until eight that night so it made more sense for Harry to go there. Harry left work as soon as he could, took the floo back home to get showered and changed. He debated about taking an overnight bag, he didn’t want to look presumptuous but equally he didn’t want to be without the essentials if he ended up staying over. In the end he took a leaf out of Hermione’s book and cast an undetectable extension charm on a small book bag; he packed a change of clothes, toiletries and pj bottoms and placed a gift for Draco on the top. He was ready much too early but he was far too nervous and excited to just sit at home waiting so he decided to walk to Draco’s from Grimmauld Place.
“Draco, that feels so good,” Harry gasped, “so damn good.”
Aww - don't you just love a happy ending :)
“You never told us that before.” Harry said.
The floo roared to life again as Neville arrived, Kreacher hobbled at an incredible speed from the kitchen to greet him.
Draco interrupted her. “Yes, Harry and I are kind of friends now.
“That’s brilliant, well done.”
“It’s nothing awful, just come on.” Harry dragged Draco by the hand leading him along the path towards the terrace.
Harry rifled through the box some more; Draco really was a hoarder, the box contained all his Hogwarts letters, a feather from his owl, his Slytherin tie, prefect badge, not the inquisitorial squad badge Harry noted, but he did find a ‘Potter Stinks’ badge.
“We have to,” Draco sat back down next to Harry and looked him in the eyes, “it’s the only way.”
Harry typed a reply.
Harry brushed his teeth and took a quick look in the mirror; his face was a sickly greenish grey colour, his eyes bloodshot and swollen but there wasn’t anything he could do about that in the next five minutes.  He made his way tentatively down to the lounge, each step driving a spike of pain through his skull, and asked Kreacher to fetch Draco. They appeared seconds later, Draco’s face was very pale but Harry couldn’t read which emotion he was feeling as his face was an expressionless mask.
“I need to go home,” Harry muttered suddenly feeling very, very drunk, “I’ll apparate from here.”
“He cut all ties except with me,” Pansy preened. “I am his oldest and best friend, and he just couldn’t bear to not have me in his life. He would have been distraught, absolutely distraught. I see him several times a year but he does not allow me to talk about anything wizard related. He couldn’t even wear my spelled clothing until he had an unfortunate incident on stage with some Muggle made trousers.”
“I was not obsessed with Draco Malfoy.”
Harry smiled.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Be good, the pair of you, and stay quiet.” Draco gave them both a quick hug. “I’ll see you after.”
His finger hovered over the send button for several seconds before he pressed it. Less than a minute went by before his phone pinged with an answering message.
Draco stopped dead in his tracks when he saw the marquee. “Is that what I think it is? Have you planned me a surprise birthday party?”
“And have you listened to it?” Draco asked.
So Draco is now a Slytherpuff?? ;)
The reply came quickly.
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand. “This is the Draco I want people to see, the Draco who loves flowers, sings love songs and has a kind heart.”
“What the fuck?” Neville nearly choked on his wine. “Malfoy is in a Muggle band?”
“I’m headed this way,” Draco said pointing to the left.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No! There is no other way. This is how it HAS to be.”
Ron had prepared a lunch of handmade flatbreads and a salad, it was tasty as all his meals were, but Harry had very little appetite. He didn’t want to ruin Ron and Hermione’s excitement by telling them about Draco but if he left much longer it the would be worse. Hermione was happily chattering about wedding favours and flower arrangements, Ron was nodding and agreeing with everything she said, Harry knew he was being a twat but he had to tell them today.
and a bottle of her father’s wine, which Draco poured down the sink after Luna left, but the visit cheered Harry in a way which only Luna could do.
“Merlin,” Harry panted, “holy fucking Merlin!”
“It was like that for me at Grimmauld Place, for the longest time all I could think about was the people I’d lost  from The Order; Siruis, Lupin, Tonks, Mad Eye even Snape. That’s when I decided I would have the house renovated; make my own memories there, the good kind.”
“Yes. And now I’m gifting it back to you.”
“Thanks, on our way,” Draco called back. “Harry, Pans, you can watch from the side of stage if you like.”
“Wait until I get up at eight, I’ll call you then and see how you like it.”
“You are welcome Harry. Did I tell you about the dabberblimps I found in the basement? Father was very upset because they ate all his socks.”
Draco had whipped up a wonderful dinner of spaghetti carbonara, he really could give Ron a run for his money, and Harry was standing at the kitchen sink washing the dishes by hand as Draco had refused to let him use magic to clean up. Draco moved to stand behind Harry, he wrapped his arms around his waist and placed a line of soft kisses on the back of Harry’s neck making Harry shiver with desire.
Harry glared at Draco but took the wine.
Draco is back from tour, guess who's excited about that!
Harry showered, changed and wrapped the engagement gift he had bought for Hermione and Ron. He had commissioned one of the wizard artists to complete a small pen and ink drawing of Hogwarts, which he had set in a silver frame, and it had turned out beautifully.  He threw in a handful of floo powder and headed over to Jeram Cottage.
“Relax Potter, you know he can’t get past the wards. The mark does more than summon him; it acts as a kind of communication device. If you touch your mark it creates a link with the Dark Lord, allows him access to your mind, allows him to read your thoughts.”
“Maybe you should be friends, what happened in the past doesn’t mean you can’t be friends now.”
“Is it?”
“So you pretended to fancy Pansy instead. I’m offended, I’m much better looking than Pansy.” Harry huffed.
“No, no, no, no, no!” Draco’s voice seemed to be coming from a long way away. “
Harry’s breath was coming in gasps, he almost could feel Draco’s hand on him, he was so turned on.
“I watched her make it, made sure she did it correctly.”
Harry’s heart ached for the boy next to him, he must have had to endure some terrible sights, Harry had been traumatized seeing Cedric die so to watch the same thing over and over must be horrific. He rolled on his side and put his arms around Draco, pulling him into a hug.
The blonde gave a small nod, accepting Ron’s use of his family name rather than his given name. “I’m very glad that you are all doing well. Technically I’m still at work, there are people I have to go talk to, but I wanted to come and thank you all for finding the kindness to come here tonight, it means a lot to me. Please feel free to stay as long as you like.’
“I should get going too,” Neville stood and stretched. “Let me know how it goes with Malfoy.”
Draco returned with a tray of sandwiches and snacks, Ron dug in at once.
“Hi,” Harry said, “did you need to see me about a case?” As an Auror Harry often gave evidence at trials but it was unusual for the clerks to visit him in his office.
“Err, that’s great, really great, umm, not the bone part clearly, that’s sounds painful, I mean it’s great that your designs are so in demand.” Harry winced as he saw Draco trying to smother his laughter.
Draco is struggling with recording the new album and takes Harry along to the recording studio.
“There is a lot for me to feel guilty about; I’ve hurt people, used people, let people down.” Harry swallowed around a lump in his throat, “People got killed because of the things I’ve done.”
“Awkward long hug,” Harry said, “loooooong hug.”
“I’ve wanted this for so many years, dreamed about it, fantasized about it. I want you.”
*************************************************************************
The table erupted into more raucous laugher.
Draco gave Harry the middle finger salute. “Seriously, could you imagine me being married to Daphne? She was as dumb as a bag of rocks, and she doesn’t have a cock. It was not a good match.”
– hard rock track
01.40
This is only my second HP fic so please forgive any errors.
“In the study please, I have some work to do.”
Instead of answering Harry licked the finger that was caressing his lips then sucked it into his mouth running his tongue across the tip.
Harry nodded which was a mistake, he swallowed hard to force the vomit back down. “Like death warmed up.”
“I made you a potion, it won’t completely cure a bad hangover but it will make you feel a lot better than you do now.”
“No it’s not funny,” Draco grinned. “What is funny is that I’ve been wanking about you since our second year at Hogwarts.”
Peace and love xx
Draco increased his pace, grinding and rocking in Harry’s lap, plunging Harry’s length deep inside him, growling as it skimmed over his prostrate. Draco added his own hand to Harry’s entwining their fingers as they stoked Draco’s engorged member together. Harry couldn't hold on much longer, the tightness of Draco around his cock, the harness of Draco in his hands brought him closer and closer to release.
“I’m sorry. If I could help ease the pain I would.”
“Fucking Slytherin prick tease,” Harry muttered helping himself to a piece of French toast.
Harry poured two glasses and sat opposite Luna at the table. “I just read
Harry huffed out a breath. “I’ve tried, but the stubborn little git refuses.”
The girl blushed bright red to the roots of her hair and rushed back to her friend, talking to her in an excited whisper.
*******************************************************************************
It was a good idea.
Draco trailed a long finger across Harry’s lips. “It’s my job. Touring is part of the job.”
“It’s amusing jackass to you,” Draco called over his shoulder.
Harry laughed. “No you bloody idiot, I mean after tonight. What do you think you will do?”
Harry told Draco the story of the girls in the coffee shop, about Walter doing a Muggle internet search, and Harry doing another search at home.
“Whilst I appreciate the sentiment there is nothing you or anyone can do to fix this.”
Harry was already grabbing his jacket from the back of his chair. “Great, see you outside in five minutes!”
“This tree,” Kreacher pointed at the tree clearly confused.
“It feels good.”
Ron was delighted to find that the drinks were complimentary so downed two Muggle whiskeys in quick succession before bringing over drinks for the rest who were standing around a table in the far corner of the room. Harry, who had his back to the room, saw both Hermione and Ron’s eyes widen with shock and he turned slowly round coming face to face with Malfoy.
Harry knew Draco was a talented wizard but he hadn’t appreciated how strong he was, he doubted even Hermione would be able to perform Occlumency to that degree. “Why did you even need to learn it in the first place?”
I hope you are enjoying this fic - please leave comments and feedback as they are much appreciated.
Ginny shrugged. “Obviously it was a bit of a shock at first but Luna says he’s changed, you say he’s changed and Hermione said he seems different. I think mum and dad were a bit skeptical at first but they trust your judgement. It’s just Ron who is being a tosser about it.”
Harry glanced at the screen. “Yes.”
him?”
“My hand is on my cock, I’m so very hard, and I’m thinking about you.” Draco murmured in a sultry, sexy voice. “What are you doing Harry? Are you touching yourself too?”
Harry smiled at the typical Nevilleness. “How are things at Hogwarts?”
Harry smiled at the clerk. “I’m sure you did the right thing.”
“He really is trying,” Luna said, “you should give him a chance.”
Harry looked over at Draco, who was now on his knees, his face pale and clammy and the wand wavering wildly in his hands. Their eyes met.
“Sixth year.” Hermione, Ron and Neville all said together.
“Not yet,” Harry conceded. “What were you talking to that house elf about?”
Harry lifted his head to find Draco holding a bunch of mistletoe above them. “Mistletoe” he whispered.
“I never thought I’d see the day when a Malfoy was allowed back in The Ministry.”
“Got us a couple of butterbeers,” Neville said resuming his seat. “I’m guessing from your note that this might be a multiple beer kind of conversation.”
There was an uncomfortable silence.
Harry closed his eyes, his hands still stoking himself as he thought about Draco; his hair, his eyes, his lip, his toned body.
“It’s so light and airy, my house feels so dark compared to this.”
The last words were whispered so quietly and with so much anguish that Harry’s heart went out to the blonde. Harry had always seen Draco as an arrogant, overconfident arsehole but at this moment all he saw was a scared and lost boy, and when Harry thought about it he realized that this was how Draco had been for weeks. The boy sitting opposite him was not the boy who had spent years taunting Harry and his friends, this was not the boy who had gotten the Ministry to order the execution of an innocent hippogriff and this was not the boy that had helped Umbridge uncover Dumbledore’s Army. This boy reminded Harry of himself, a boy full of fear and insecurity.
Harry turned and practically ran from the office almost colliding with Hermione as he barreled through the door.
Harry sat in shock. Of all the things he could have imagined Draco being tasked with killing Dumbledore was not one of them.
“We should go.” Draco kissed off a flake that had landed on Harry’s nose. “It’s cold and you are still not fully recovered.”
Seems like Harry is becoming a bit obsessed with a certain Slytherin :)
“Don’t you just wish that you could just do something different, be someone else?”
Draco replied within seconds.

“But?” Neville was always astute.

“Why not? The truth is easiest to hear when it’s delivered straight not when it’s wrapped up in layers of words.”
“That was interesting,” Hermione said, “he does seem to be different.”
“You do?” The disbelief was evident on Draco’s face. “You like me?”
“I’ll come Harry,” Luna said. “Although I might need to wear my wranglegrass necklace. Dabberblimps are attracted to music and when they get in your ears it is very annoying.”
“You called me Harry.”
“They’re for my boyfriend,” Harry said handing over some Muggle money.
His hand was aching and his coffee was cold by the time he finally finished the first report, he leaned back in his chair to stretch his sore shoulders when his Talkkey squawked at him.
“Oh, there were many times,” Hermione chuckled. “There was that time in sixth year when he was obsessed with you and –“
Harry has a surprise for Draco - but will he like it?
“You dark horse Ron,” Harry laughed. “I didn’t think you were that romantic.”
“Beautiful aren’t they,’ the florist said with a smile as she wrapped the dozen roses in cellophane, coloured paper and tied it with a green bow. “Lucky girl.”
Draco poured a glass and slid it across the table to Harry along with the lunch menu. “So you are an Auror now, do you enjoy it?”
Harry took the wine from the ancient house elf. “Thank you Kreacher, but you know you don’t have to cook me dinner every night.”
“Oh no, but we wrote to each other,” Luna replied. “He was effected by the war too, he suffered like everyone else. He knows the harm magic can do and it scares him now.”
I hope you are enjoying the story - please leave comments and feedback!
“Morning sleepyhead.” Draco smiled enveloping Harry in a tight embrace. “Hope you are hungry.”
Peace and love xx
“He needs to keep working to do the cooking, Harry’s cooking is terrible,” Ron grinned. “No offence mate.”
“Well I’m glad, you and Draco will help each other heal and grow, you and Draco are more alike than you think. You both feel deep and hard.”
“Enough.” Snape barked. “I’m sure there will be a plethora of future occasions where the pitiful Potter will provide cause for amusement with his dimwittedness but for now turn to page 472 of your books and proceed to read chapters 28 and 29. And do it quietly. Mr. Malfoy a word if I may.”
“So Harry, did you want to talk about Draco now?”
Luckily the traffic was light, the journey took twenty five minutes so Harry was only fifteen minutes late by the time he arrived at the restaurant. Draco had chosen a small boutique bistro, it was a contemporary design with dark wood furniture and polished chrome fixtures, and the place looked full. Harry gave Draco’s name to the hostess who led him through to a booth towards the back to where Draco was drinking a glass of red wine. Draco rose to greet Harry and there was a rather awkward pause, Harry felt strangely self-conscious and he was relieved when Draco nodded to Harry indicating he should take a seat. Harry gratefully slid in to the booth taking off his hoodie as Draco sat back down.
“He looked good though,” Hermione said, “kind of sexy actually.”
“Give him some air Draco,” Hermione said gently. “Let him come round in his own time.”
“Of course,” Harry grinned. “Of course I will.”
The streets outside the venue were crowded with fans, many of whom were wearing shirts with the Lumos Solem band logo on the front. Harry had asked Neville the previous night about the meaning of a green rose and it apparently represented fertility, it seemed an odd choice for Malfoy to use in conjunction with the symbols for Slytherin and his wand but he knew it must hold some significance. Harry spotted Luna standing by the box office, she was wearing a yellow dress with huge orange spots, a silver belt made of bottle caps, purple shoes, and what looked like a necklace made of hay wrapped around her neck. Harry made his way over to her and shortly after Hermione and Ron appeared through the crowd. Hermione waved a hand at them but Ron merely scowled, it was evident that he was not pleased at being there and Hermione all but dragged him by the hand to join them.
“I’d been planning it for weeks, had to be special didn’t it, couldn’t just ask her in the middle of Wizard Wheezes.” Ron tried to be nonchalant but Harry could see he was proud of himself.
Hermione nodded. “I’m happy for you Harry, if Draco is the one that makes you feel like I do with Ron then I’m happy. I’ll work on Ron.” She gave him a hug. “See you at work tomorrow.”
Draco sighed but carefully placed the box on the coffee table and Harry knew Draco was touched by the gift, not just the wand but with the knowledge that he had helped bring an end to the war.
“None of your business, just fuck off and leave me alone.”
“I’ll break the wine glasses if you keep doing that,” Harry said.
“Yes. By giving up your wand to me the Elder wand also changed allegiance to me, meaning it refused to attack me when Voldemort tried to kill me with it. Because you
“None of us do, but seeing Hogwarts now, rebuilt and with happy students, it helps erase some of those bad memories.”
“Your Muggle device has been making sounds all night,” said Kreacher. “Kreacher did not know how to make it stop so I hid it under your pillow. Would Master Harry like some breakfast?”
Harry grinned. “Yes. He’s just so amazing.” Harry and Draco had spent every minute they could together over the last two weeks and their relationship was deepening with every passing day. “I hate that he’s leaving to go back out on tour next week, he’ll be gone for four weeks.”
Ron was staring at Harry open mouthed. Harry stomped over to pour himself another firewhisky.
Harry saw Draco go down. “Fuck you Rowle.
“You tell him Ron,” Hermione squeaked.
Draco lead Harry into the bedroom, it was large room with another set of sliding doors leading to the balcony, and a big en suite bathroom. Draco prepared for bed whilst Harry rooted in his bag to retrieve his pj’s and toiletries, the blonde emerged from the bathroom wearing just black silk pj bottoms and smelling of mint toothpaste.
“I, err, I’ve met someone.” Harry felt his face burning. “Someone special. Someone who I think might be the one.”
Draco’s face lit up with a shy smile. “I know I’m hot as fuck, but do you fancy me, as in the person inside not just the incredibly hot person on the outside.”
“Did she just say Lumos Solem?” Harry asked Hermione who was trying to save her papers from the tide of coffee running across the table. A condiment container does not make a good dam for holding back coffee spills apparently.
“Then take them off, I want you naked with me.”
Harry and Hermione fell into a comfortable silence, in the way old friends do. Hermione was making notes on the research papers and Harry was enjoying sipping his coffee when a shriek from a girl at the next table made Harry drop his coffee cup in shock.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thank fuck for that!” Ron said hugging Harry. “I was more nervous about asking you that than I was asking ‘Mione to marry me.”
“I’m going come so hard,” Draco panted. “So hard.”
“More,” Draco gasped, “more.”
Draco laughed, “I do have a habit of drunk dialing, you have been warned!”
“I was there Harry, I don’t need to see it again,” Ron said irritably.
“This is on me, my treat.”
“That’s good enough.”
“Welcome to Hogwarts, this is the start of a long journey for you all.” McGonagall smiled at the children. “You will shortly receive your class timetables, I advise you all to commit these to memory, and please do not ask any of the castle ghosts for directions as you may find yourself in entirely the wrong place.
“What the fuck,” Draco sniffed as the closing credits rolled, “that was not a movie for kids. That was the saddest thing I’ve ever watched.”
“I have a bottle open, we can have yours with dinner.” Harry poured out two glasses and handed them to his friends.
“Fuck……fuck…….fuck.”
“I have to kill Dumbledore.”
“Sorry sir,” Harry mumbled.
Draco made good use of his new Muggle camera taking photos of all the good memories. And there were plenty; Patsy got drunk and ended up making out with George, much to Draco and Harry’s amusement, Neville fell into a bush getting stuck until a laughing Draco pulled him free, Molly was dancing wearing only one shoe and Hagrid set his beard alight on one of the floating candles.
‘I’ve eaten here several times,’ Draco said. “I recommend the beef wellington or the duck, both are rather excellent.”
” The purple light from Harry’s wand narrowly missed Rowle as Harry ran from behind the dumpster towards Draco who was still lying motionless on the ground.
Draco indicated the marble corner bench in the corner of the shower. Harry sat, Draco knelt in front of him positioned between Harry’s legs sucking at the soft skin of his inner thigh up to his hipbone leaving a trail of already purpling bruises.
“I quit the band.”
“Maybe you need to make new badges Draco,” Blaise smirked. “This time saying Potter is a loser!”
Harry chucked the floo powder onto the fireplace and headed for home. He was more than half drunk and very tired, he fell into bed and didn’t stir until Kreacher woke him for breakfast.
Harry needs to talk it out with someone - and Neville is the man for the job!
01:07
“Will Master Draco be staying for dinner?”
I hope you are enjoying this fic - please leave comments and feedback as they are much appreciated.
“Oh go on then, just a small glass of white wine.”
“I’m nearly there,” Draco panted against Harry’s mouth. “I’m going to come.”
I can imagine Harry being and absolute nightmare as a patient.
There was no denying that Harry was now physically attracted to Draco, but physical attraction did not involve personal feelings, and it did not mean they could ever have a friendship. Draco was clearly trying to create some kind of civility between them but Harry was not sure that he wanted Draco in his life even if he was a changed man. Luna’s comments nagged at the back of his mind; Draco had treated Luna horribly yet she had obviously found a way through that and was on good, if not friendly, terms with him now. Luna might be whimsical and strange but she had a way of seeing through to the real core of people and could read things about people that others just could not see. If Luna said that Draco was different now he believed it, but that still did not mean that Harry wanted his friendship.
“Thank you Kreacher,” Harry said with a grin, “come on in guys.”
“Um, so should we use these then?” Harry held up the backstage passes.
Kreacher had already laid out Harry’s dinner, shepherd’s pie with peas and carrots, one of his favourite meals, and another glass of red wine, at the desk where Harry worked when at home. The study was a cozy room; it had a fireplace flanked by two comfortable sofas, two huge bookcases that Harry had filled with photos and mementos along with his books, and at the opposite end of the room to the fireplace, a solid walnut desk with a black leather chair. After finishing his meal Harry pulled out the muggle laptop he had bought to send emails to Dudley, who he was now on relatively good terms with, but it also had a web browser installed as standard and tonight he had some browsing to do.
Hermione raised an eyebrow. “Probably since when the whole of the wizarding world made him into a social pariah.”
“What will you do?” This was probably the time for the discussion that Harry had promised Hermione he would have, but it still didn’t feel right.
Harry reluctantly left, leaving Draco to finish ‘calming his spirit’, and walked to the supermarket to buy dinner. Although Draco loved to cook Harry had no idea about recipes or what was needed so he picked up some random ingredients and some fresh vegetables that he thought looked like things Draco might cook with. He also grabbed a couple of bottles of good red wine, they could get drunk if Harry’s ingredient choices were totally off, then headed back to the apartment where Draco had thankfully finished with his meditation. He placed the bags on the kitchen counter and was immediately scooped up in Draco’s arms.
Through the red haze of pain Harry saw Draco’s fingers slide forward and grab Harry’s wand. Rowle looked behind him and laughed as he saw Draco pointing the wand at him with trembling hands.
“Sure, I’ll bring the wine and dessert.”
“I thought you didn’t want any arguments?” Harry said as Ron glared at him.
The view of the storm from the apartment was magnificent but the weather was preventing them from talking a walk over to Primrose Hill as they had planned for the afternoon.
“Yes of course, but first a goodbye kiss.”
“You don’t know how many nights I have dreamed of doing this,” Draco murmured against Harry’s neck. “How many times I’ve wanked thinking about doing this.”
“To happy weddings.” Harry raised his glass.
“Hi Harry, I hear you are shagging Death Eaters now.”
Harry fell into bed but sleep didn’t come quickly. He stared at the ceiling trying to piece together what had happened that night, he had the strangest feeling that he was missing something, a tickle at the back of his mind, a ghost of a memory that he couldn’t quite summon. He sighed and closed his eyes willing himself to fall asleep, but the last conscious image he had before sleep claimed him was of blonde hair, grey eyes and soft pink lips.
Harry sniggered. “Why call the band Lumos Solem?”
As the last student took their place at their house table McGonagall placed the hat on the stool and returned to the staff table.
“I love him Ron, and nothing would make me happier than for you to get to know him. Draco now is not like the Draco you knew.”
The boys spoke the words in unison, both boys mourning the loss of the night that they would never remember.
***********************************************************
Draco took a long swallow of wine. “After the war I was in a really dark place, so dark that it was suffocating, and there were times when I thought about ending it, to make the darkness permanent, at the time it seemed infinitely more preferable than living with the guilt and the horror of what I had done. Music was the only thing that I held on to, it was the only thing that made me keep going, it was the way I climbed out of the black hole I was in.”
Draco took a handful of tissues. “Wandless magic, that’s pretty impressive.”
“Thank you Mrs. Weasley, thank you for inviting me.” Draco visibly sagged with relief at the warm welcome.
“Thanks Draco, that’s a very un-jackass thing to do.”
Harry’s orgasm hit him like a tsunami, a crashing wave of pleasure washing over him as his cock spurted come all over his stomach. He was dimly aware of hearing Draco groaning whilst he was still coming, long and hard, his whole body convulsing with the force of his ejaculation.
Harry reached out and pulled Draco to him. “You were on your own then D, you had no support, no friends, no life. It’s different now, you have all of those things. You have me. I’ll never let you fall back into the dark place. I love you, I won’t let anything bad happen to you.”
The foursome made their way back out onto the street which was now deserted except for the last of the road crew loading up a tour truck.
“When’s the wedding?” Harry asked.
“This is a fan show, smaller venue, a thousand tickets, so no support band.” Draco got to his feet and headed to the bathroom. “I need a pee before I go on stage, if I can get out of these trousers. Did you really have to make them quite so tight Pans?”
“I never thought, not in my wildest dreams, and there have been plenty of those I can assure you, that you would ever feel the same way about me.” Draco smiled again. “Can I kiss you?”
“It’s a beautiful design don’t you think?” Luna ran a hand over a t-shirt displaying the band logo. “Very clever too, shows who he was and who he is becoming now. Draco was always very deep and reflective.”
“Stay,” Draco whispered, “please stay, I want to sleep with you in my arms again tonight.”
“No we can’t. I don’t know that I can keep those memories hidden from Him and if he finds them he will use them. I have to keep you safe too.”
So Draco is a Muggle rock star - who'd have thought it ;)
A lazy day where Draco learns that kids movies are not just for kids, Harry has a gift for Draco and Harry spends the night again ;)
Harry grabbed his jacket and walked out of the room to the floo fireplace, he had the powder in his hands when Hermione caught up with him.
Peace and love xx
“I’m scared that it would set me back,” Draco whispered, “put me back in the dark place.”
Harry picked out another random piece of paper.
“Thanks Luna, I’m really happy but it’s….complicated.” Harry pushed a dumpling around the bowl with his spoon.
“Hello Potter, remember me?”
“If I didn’t have one before I would now,” Harry mumbled but he gratefully accepted the water and drank the whole glass. “Leave the coffee on the bedside cabinet please Kreacher. And thank you.”
Peace and love xx
Draco didn’t answer for a long while.  He stared at the floor and when he lifted his head his face was a blank mask but Harry could see the tears forming in his eyes.
“If I said I was staying in the Muggle world would you come with me?”
Harry’s heart leapt.
“The Portkey from Paris to Calais was a bit bumpy but the rest were fine. You look wonderful darling, just wait until you see what I’ve brought for you.” She turned to pick up her bags and noticed Harry for the first time.
“Umm, he left some tickets for me.” Harry said. “Lumos Solem are playing a concert tomorrow night and he left me four VIP tickets.”
“Yes,” Hermione shuffled nervously on her feet, “and I don’t think you are going to like it much.”
“In front of us or behind?” Draco said in a low murmur.
“Draco?” Harry managed to lift his eyelids and found himself staring into stormy grey eyes. “You should have run, you could have got hurt.”
Harry’s stomach was fizzing, he had the strangest sensation of the potion expanding to the size of a quaffle ball then burst like a bubble. As soon as it burst his headache receded to nothing more than a slight nagging behind his eyes and the nausea completely disappeared, in fact he was starving hungry. He snatched a sandwich and ate it in three bites with a large gulp of coffee to wash it down.
Draco clearly remembered the incident too. “Do you want me to break your nose again?”
“Then it’s time you did. You are clearly in love with each other so you need to talk about how to make it work.”
The moan that came from Draco’s mouth was a sound that Harry could listen to forever.
The days until Draco returned moved at a snail’s pace, Harry was becoming more and more disenchanted with being an Auror and it was a struggle just to find the enthusiasm to go to work. Despite the daily calls and messages, and a few late night phone sex sessions, Harry missed Draco more and more every day, it was like an ache, and he was miserable with just about everyone. Hermione had threatened to spike his coffee with a laughing potion unless he pulled himself out of his ‘self-indulgent misery’ and got on with life ‘like a normal person’. The day finally arrived for Draco’s return, Harry didn’t even bother going home, he had brought his bottomless bag to work with everything he needed, and apparated straight to Draco’s apartment as soon as he had finished work for the day.
“Norwich,” Draco chuckled, “but for someone as geographically challenged as you its close enough. It was a good show, great crowd.”
“I want to feel you inside me,” Draco said in a low voice, his face buried in the nest of dark hairs of Harry’s groin.
There was a photo accompanying the article showing the band on stage at the 2002 Glastonbury Festival. It was hard to make out details but there was something familiar about the singer up front holding the microphone.
“You are pressing yourself into my hand, I’m gripping you harder.”
Harry chuckled, Hagrid always seemed to have less control over his creatures than he thought he did.
“Yeah, see you at six thirty. Night Ron.”
“You kept all the stuff Luna sent in her letters? I just binned them.”
She gave Harry a tight hug, she was still tiny but she was strong and Harry thought his ribs might fracture.
A small smile tugged at Draco’s mouth. “You are such a Gryffindor. Do you mind if we stayed like this for a bit? Maybe sleep for a while? I don’t get much sleep but I think I can here, with you.”
Lavender had been one of the students that had died at the Battle of Hogwarts.
The smile faded from Draco’s face. “You know that this changes nothing, that outside this room we are still Malfoy and Potter, Death Eater and The Chosen One.”
I hope you are enjoying this fic - please leave comments and feedback as they are much appreciated.
It was Harry’s turn to gape. “What?”
Harry let the cock slip from his mouth. “Are you ready?”
Harry eased a second finger inside, scissoring them to slowly stretch Draco’s narrow tract. Draco’s cock twitched as Harry stretched him wider, he had a gorgeous cock, long and thick with prominent veins, Harry leant forward and took it into his mouth savoring the salty taste of pre-come on his tongue. Draco moaned as Harry’s mouth worked him, his breath quickening with every lick from Harry’s tongue. As Draco’s ring relaxed Harry added a third finger continuing to stretch him, getting him loosened up ready to take Harry’s aching dick.
“He was always kind to us when we were at the Manor, he brought us extra food when no one was looking, gave us warm blankets and cleaned up our clothes for us.”
“I’ve not forgiven him, he did some horrible things, but he did help us at Malfoy Manor and that deserved to be acknowledged.”
“Or Won-Won.”
“It’s Molly. Well come along you two, there are gifts waiting to be opened and food to be eaten.
Harry had left the office soon after receiving the tickets, it was Friday, he had dinner at Hermione and Ron’s place that evening and he needed to get home to change. After picking up a couple of bottles of red wine and a delicious looking chocolate cheesecake, Harry dumped his clothes on the bathroom floor and jumped into the shower. As the hot water cascaded over him, Harry pondered on the concert tickets debating in his mind whether he would go or not. Having watched videos of the band on the internet the previous night he was intrigued, he had never been to a Muggle concert before, although he had seen The Weird Sisters several times, and he wondered how different a Muggle concert would be. His thoughts drifted to Malfoy; the Malfoy he had seen on the videos, drenched with sweat, shirt plastered to his body and long hair flying as he raced around the stage. Harry’s cock twitched as he thought about his school enemy, and as a gay man Harry found Malfoy incredibly attractive. His hand slipped down to caress his rapidly stiffening erection. He closed his eyes, his mind picturing the beads of sweat rolling down Malfoy’s chest, long fingers wrapped around the microphone, pink lips open wide as he sang. Harry ran his hands up and down his engorged member, his breath coming quicker and harder as he pumped himself faster and faster, finally letting out a cry as he came long and hard, his come splattering against the wall of the shower. He let the shower clean him off, the water washing away his come but not the embarrassment Harry felt about wanking himself off thinking about Malfoy of all people. He dried himself quickly, threw on some jeans and a blue shirt, grabbed the wine and cheesecake, and instructed his floo to take him to Jeram Cottage.
Neville was silent for several minutes. “You know I’m just worried about you Harry. I don’t want to see you get hurt. If Draco is still - ”
Harry took a deep breath. “It’s Draco.”
“Ok, text me when you get home,” Draco said as the cab stopped by the curb. “Another awkward quick hug?”
“Pansy’s trousers still holding up?” Draco had told Harry the story of his ‘incident’ with the Muggle trousers he was wearing on stage splitting at the crotch which Harry had found hilarious.
“But –“
Luna came to visit bringing another bunch of Fringlefruit flowers, the Christmas edition of
“My silly little Gryffindork, sending the Ministry on a wild goose, or rather pigeon, chase. It’s rather endearing.”
Draco wiggled his free hand between them to unbutton Harry’s shirt then dipped his head to flick his tongue across a nipple. Harry’s moan rivaled Draco’s as he sucked and lightly bit the brown nub of flesh on Harry’s chest. Harry released the finger from his mouth which Draco dragged across Harry’s stomach leaving a shiny wet line, then moved to undo the button and fly of Harry’s trousers. With both hands now free Draco pulled at Harry’s trousers and pants, Harry lifted his hips to help, and with one swift yank the clothes were down to his thighs and his rigid cock sprang free. Harry sucked in a breath and held himself still, not sure what to do next.
“If you are very lucky I might cook you dinner, with something very special for dessert.” Draco grinned lasciviously, whilst slowly licking creamy white yogurt off a spoon.
Draco smiled fondly and kissed the top of Pansy’s head. “You really are the best friend I could ever ask for, even if you are a silly goose.” Pansy giggled like a girl and clung onto Draco’s arm. “I have to go and schmooze with people, so grab a drink and let’s go party.”
Harry and Draco finally have 'the talk' - will it be a happy ending?
It's concert night - will Draco be any good? Will Ron survive the night? Will Luna do something whacky?
– rock track
on Draco in sixth year. Harry couldn’t face reading the messages just yet, he shoved the phone back under his pillow and reached out for the coffee Kreacher had left. His hands were trembling and he had to hold the mug in two hands to stop him from slopping coffee over the rim, but the caffeine made him feel marginally more human, marginal being a very relative term as his head still felt as though his brain was being clobbered with a troll’s club.
“Relax Harry, you didn’t actually need to be here until six thirty but I figured you would be late so I told you six.”
“Yes. No. I don’t know. You just have to get down here.”
“Um mate,” Ron said, “about the wedding. Would you, um, will you be my best man?”
Draco cupped his hand behind Harry’s head drawing him forward into a passionate kiss, long, sensual, desire building with every breath Harry took. Draco pressed up against him, the kisses became urgent, lips mashed together, tongues swirling together fighting for control, bodies pressed tightly against each other their cocks grinding against each other. Harry bit back a moan as Draco’s hands ran down his back settling on his hips, thumbs massaging the small hollows at the base of his spine.
’. Draco’s voice was so haunting on the recorded version, the sound more intense, with layers of strings including a harp; it brought him to tears every time he listened to it. If he could have snuck the CD player into his office he would have done, it would have been a welcome distraction from the piles of reports he completed on a daily basis.
“I’m not stubborn!” said Harry stubbornly.
“What?” Harry asked confused by the comment.
Harry held Draco’s hand and led him into the kitchen where the rest of the family were gathered around the large wooden table.
' CD non-stop at home, he really did like the music but his favourite track by far was ‘
“Quiet, no drama.” Neville grinned, “Not unless you count the time that Hagrid lost control over a batch of blast-ended skrewts, they ended up running around in the laundry room and set fire to a couple of baskets of bedsheets. Took us days to round them up and I’m still not convinced we found them all.”
“Yes, Master Harry must go back to the library, must go now.”
“It’s really you! Draco Malfoy!’
“Badly. Matt and Rupe got into a huge argument today, Rupe actually threw a cymbal at Matt, thank Merlin he throws like a girl or it could have taken Matt’s head off. Dan and I had to break it up.” Draco snuggled his head into Harry’s neck. “This is nice. I like having my hair stroked.”
“What the fuck are you doing here Potter?” Draco said with his usual sneer. “You stalking me or something?”
Harry flopped down on the bed next to Ron. “Ok. No cocks. So let me tell you about my boyfriend Draco.”
“Oh, well that’s good,” Luna said, dropping the rug and getting to her feet. “I like these shoes and I would be terribly sad if they disappeared.”
“Sure, be right back.”
There was a long pause.
Ron said nothing but he poured two glasses of firewhisky handing one to Harry. Ron sprawled out on the bed, eyes fixed on the ceiling, while Harry took the loveseat under the window and sipped on his whisky. The silence was excruciating but Harry knew better than to be the one to speak first. In the end the silence was broken by a ping from Harry’s phone indicating he had a message.
“If Ron has a problem with you and Draco then that’s
A tinge of red flushed Draco’s cheeks. “To keep my mind safe from people like Dumbledore, but it had the added advantage that I could keep the Dark Lord from learning about you.”
‘Fiendfyre’.
“Green roses, they are gorgeous, I love green roses.” Draco gave Harry a long lingering kiss. “Thank you, that’s so thoughtful of you. No one has ever bought me flowers before.”
Draco made for the door but Harry wasn’t going to let him walk away without getting answers. He grabbed hold of Draco’s arm as he passed by and was shocked when Draco gasped with pain, his knees buckling as he sagged against the doorframe. At the same time Harry felt the scar on his forehead sting, it felt like fire ants crawling across his skin.
Harry held the remote out of Draco’s reach. “Have you ever seen it?”
Harry grinned. “Harry and Draco, I like the sound of that.”
Draco reached over for his coffee and took another sip. He pulled a face at the bitter liquid. ‘I much prefer Muggle coffee, wizard coffee tastes like hot dirt.”
Draco shrugged. “I could go solo, or maybe form another band. I don’t want to think about it right now. What I need right now is some quality time with my boyfriend who I haven’t seen for weeks. I missed you so much.”
Draco looked at his hands, “I don’t practice magic anymore. I don’t even have a wand.”
“You can’t stop me Draco,” Harry said defiantly.
Harry nearly sliced through his own hand,
“Thank you for inviting us Draco,” Luna said. “You have come a long way you know.”
Harry was momentarily both horrified and embarrassed, then a second message arrived.
******************************************************************************************
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco grinned. “Formal handshake or awkward hug? Or maybe that air kissing thing the French do?”
Harry glanced around, there was nothing to use except his school shirt but he figured if he used the bottom bit he could tuck it in his trousers so it wouldn’t be noticeable. He reluctantly pulled the crumpled shirt from underneath him.
Peace and Love xx
“Pansy was my cover, she’s a dear friend and knew I was gay so helped me keep up appearances for my father.”
“We got backstage passes!” Ron whispered excitedly. “I’ve never had a backstage pass before!”
Harry pointed to the right. “Um, I’m headed that way.”
“Anyway, I thought you had forgiven him,” Hermione said, “you testified for him at his trial.”
Draco laughed, “It was really good to catch up Harry.” He stood and grabbed his jacket from the seat.
With a start Harry realized what he was doing, he pulled away, stumbling back towards the waiting cab.
“Thank you Kreacher, black, no sugar or cream.” Draco dropped onto the sofa opposite Harry as the elf scuttled off to get Draco’s coffee.
“Mistress Hermione! You are so kind to Kreacher, you are indeed a very special friend to Kreacher.”
Harry woke in an unfamiliar bed. His head felt fuzzy and he could swear he could hear Draco talking to Ron; deciding he must be dreaming he let the conversation wash over him.
Harry felt tears pricking behind his eyes, he still missed Dobby. “Thank you.”
“Ron,” Hermione laid a hand on her fiancés arm, “Harry is right Draco didn’t –“
Like Harry, Draco had a huge walk in shower; it was white marble tiles, dual shower heads with a small marble bench in one corner. Harry stripped off his clothes and stepped into the shower letting the hot water cascade over his body, luxuriating in the warmth.
“If by that you mean Harry constantly whining about being bored, getting out of bed when he wasn’t supposed to and generally being a pain in the arse, then yes he was a model patient.”
A knock on the door roused Harry from his work; he called out a ‘come in’ and was surprised to see one of the Wizengamot clerks enter his office.
“It’s only as complicated as you make it Harry. The only people who matter in this are you and Draco.”
Harry was close, he felt the tingling starting in his balls, spreading up to the base of his pulsating cock. He groaned loudly tightening his grip on Draco’s hair, pushing himself into the softness of Draco’s mouth, the pressure in his balls growing with each lick from Draco’s tongue.
“You’ll have to wait in the control room, be good and don’t touch anything!”
“It’s me, Harry.”
Malfoy had never used Harry’s first name before and it threw him off balance. “Err…yes, thanks for the invite...Draco.” Harry had come to think of him as Draco in his mind but the name still felt odd on his lips.
Harry woke to a pounding both in his head and on his head. He cracked open his eyes to see Kreacher standing on the bed whacking Harry over the head with a wooden spoon.
“Draco? Are you alright?”
“Surely you can’t be thinking of actually doing it? Kill Dumbledore? Draco you can’t do it.”
Harry pushed to box at Draco. “Even if you don’t use it, the wand belongs to you,” Harry said.
Harry laughed. “It’s nothing like that, just going to run him a nice bubble bath –“
Malfoy had invited Harry to a show the following night. He wondered why Malfoy would invite him, yet he knew he would go just to see the blonde perform on stage. The thought of seeing him in the flesh rather than on video was not something Harry was going to pass up.
Harry’s cock jumped and he quickly tugged off his sleep pants. “I’m naked now.”
“Aren’t you going to read it?”
Peace and love xx
Harry slid out of the booth. “Yeah, it was good.”
at him. Now he was seeing him up close he realized how wretched he looked; he had always been pale but now he was so white he looked like one of the castle ghosts, and he had lost a lot of weight, his cheekbones prominent and his eyes sunken. He looked dreadful. Harry’s anger dissipated and was replaced with concern.
Harry had the grace to feel embarrassed. “Err, yes, I guess that would probably do it.”
“No, really he isn’t. He knows that he can’t change what he did in the past, but he’s worked hard to find himself, the real Draco underneath, and he’s nothing like Lucius. He won’t even use magic anymore.”
Draco and Harry were playing a game of wizard chess, which Draco was winning by a long margin, when Neville arrived by the floo. Harry had invited him over as he was not good at having nothing to do and he was getting irritable at staying in bed.
Draco exaggerated a sigh. “Typical Potter, always believing that he can save everyone.”
Two more strokes and Harry felt Draco’s cock throb in his hand then the hot wetness of his come coating his fingers. Draco sighed softly which pushed Harry over the edge. His orgasm rolled over him like thunder during a summer storm, deep and long, rolling on as he spilled his seed over them both.
“I can work with this,” Draco said handing Harry a glass of wine. “Go watch TV or take a shower whilst I make dinner.”
“What the actual fuck?” Harry exclaimed to a startled Hermione. “Malfoy is a Muggle rock star?”
Harry’s mind snapped back into the room to find Snape leaning on the desk in front of him, his face hovering inches from his own.
01.24
Draco gave a wry smile. “That’s probably a discussion for another time. How’s Ginny, what is she doing now?”
Harry had just finished painting the final baseboard when he received a text from Draco.
“I think Ron is finally coming round to the idea that Draco isn’t a monster.”
Harry got a bit hot under the collar there :)
The rest of the room joined in the laughter as Draco promised to wear it on stage on his next tour. Harry hugged Molly and quietly thanked her for including Draco in the festivities.
Draco snuggled closer to Harry laying his head on his shoulder.
“I just mean we are here to spend time with you.” Hermione said rather too quickly. “Where do we go in?”
“You know, that face he pulls, like someone just took a shit on his shoes.”
Harry sipped on his coffee. “Yes, I like him a lot, more than a lot. I think he might be the one ‘Mione.”
“Thanks ‘Mione, but I’m not sure I even want to go back.”
“No, it was mutual, kind of. Actually I was a complete twat.” It felt awkward discussing his love life with Draco, and he certainly did not feel comfortable enough to tell Draco he was gay.
“Happy birthday Hermione!” Harry handed her the gift he had bought, a solid silver quill stand for her desk. Hermione was thrilled and promised to take it to work the following week.
And Hermione swears like a sailor!
“Oh, sorry to hear that. I hope the breakup wasn’t too horrible.”
“Yeah, I know, Malfoy the bloody saviour.”
, stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind her, leaving Harry and Ron alone.
Harry groaned as Draco pulled himself up then pushed back down, the tightness of Draco’s ass pushing down on him made his balls ache, he was trying to hold back, wanting to draw out the pleasure for as long as he could.
“Harry.” Draco groaned as he exploded in Harry’s hand, strings of white come splattered against his stomach as Draco rode out his orgasm, moaning until he was spent.
“Draco was amazing,” Harry said his eyes still on the stage where Malfoy had been. “Just fucking amazing.”
Harry nodded, having grown up with a Muggle family he had used the internet on Dudley’s computer when he had the chance, but he had rarely used it since moving out of the Dursley household.
“I want to watch you sing, I love your voice.”
Draco gave a rueful smile. “Oh but it is, it was always about you. You know what is on my arm don’t you?”
“I’m sure Draco does not want to hear about that,” Harry felt his cheeks flame red.
Harry chose a shower, he always enjoyed a long hot shower, it was his form of meditation he supposed.
Harry had never had phone sex before but he found it sexy as hell and his thoughts were on Draco, his boyfriend, as he fell back to sleep.
Harry smiled, that was the first time Draco had called him his boyfriend. “I miss you too.”
“Potter?” She looked back at Draco. “Merlin’s tits! Are you and Potter finally –“
In contrast Harry’s days were filled with writing mind-numbingly boring reports and his evenings spent reviewing them.
” Rowle’s wand emitted a white light.
“He was there to have his magical core restored.”
“Yes, and I’m not sure I’m ready to be a professor.” Neville had always lacked confidence in himself.
“You seem to be getting obsessed with Draco again.”
Harry shrugged, he finished his drink and stood up to leave. “Who knows? Anyway we won’t be talking to him, we will just be there watching him. Thanks for dinner Ron, it was amazing as always.”
Harry almost collapsed with relief. “Come on, your party awaits.”
Harry opened the wine, poured himself a large glass and sat with Luna on one of the sofas catching up on the previous few weeks since they had last seen each other.
Hot tears pricked at the corners of Harry’s eyes, he had really fucked things up, worse than when he had used
Draco muttered something inaudible but he unbuttoned his shirt and took it off. Harry almost gasped; Draco’s abs were honed to perfection, his wide shoulders were toned, as were his arms, but the thing that Harry noticed first were the faint, fine scars which crisscrossed his pale chest, the scars that Harry had put there back in sixth year. Harry swallowed hard as he remembered how he had almost killed Draco that night. Pansy gave Draco the new shirt; he quickly pulled it over his head, shoved his arms through the sleeves and straightened the shoulders.
Draco ran a long delicate finger across Harry’s lips. “You ok with this?”
“This isn’t about me.”
“Maybe I should go,” Harry said.
I hope you are enjoying this fic - please leave comments and feedback as they are much appreciated.
“I was never going to leave you Harry.”
Harry snuggled against Draco. “It’s beautiful here, so quiet and peaceful.”
“Hey Malfoy,” Bill smiled, “there’s even one for you.”
“Yeah, I found him in an old storage room and….” Harry faltered, his memory seemed a bit hazy, he recalled going down to the storage room then an image of a blond boy running away from him.
Harry took a sip of his wine. “Hermione said he’ll get there in his own time, he’s as stubborn as shit so it will probably take months,”
Neville chuckled. “I might have accidentally dropped a pot of stinksap in the classroom and locked the second year students in there for five minutes. Pomona wasn’t happy but the kids haven’t given me any trouble since.”
“It’s a piece of Hogwarts.” Draco took the rock and rubbed his fingers against the rough surface. “I knew I was never going back so I took a piece with me after the battle.”
Harry looked at the card on which was printed Draco’s name, address and phone number. The address was in Camden Town that, although not so far from Grimmauld Place, was not an area that Harry knew well but knew it was an area where trendy Muggles liked to hang out. Harry put the card and letter back in the envelope and shoved it in his backpack, he had a lot of work to do and couldn’t be distracted by thoughts of Draco, his feelings were complicated when it came to the blonde who had been such a dick to him over the years. Kicking the backpack under his desk Harry focused on the task of tracking the movement of owls that he suspected of delivering messages to some dark wizards, and Draco, for the time being, was forgotten.
Harry held Draco’s hands in his own. “We can figure it out, Dumbledore will find a way to –“
“Um, should I leave?” Harry mumbled.
I miss live music :(
“I don’t fucking care anymore, you can argue all night if that’s what it takes, but I’m fed up with this. You are
Harry rejoined the line and made his way through the metal detector meeting Luna on the other side who was looking at the stall selling Lumos Solem merchandise.
“I take he’s not the dick he was at school then?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry sighed, “I guess. Do you think you can help me write my reports?”
“But you get all those girls squealing at you,” Harry poked Draco playfully in the ribs, “that must be nice.”
“Yes,” Hermione said at the same time as Ron said no.
“Oh don’t be like that Harry,” Draco sulked, “I just miss you. Can’t I call my boyfriend because I miss him?”
“He really does make me happy, he’s not the same Draco we knew from Hogwarts. I swear to Merlin that he’s more Hufflepuff than Slytherin now.”
Harry walked over to the cubicle Hermione had indicated; a very fat man in a red sweater rose to meet him and shook Harry’s hand.
It was fully dark by the time Harry and Draco left the studio, it had been raining and the air was misted with a light fog. They decided to walk to a small restaurant for dinner, taking a short cut through an alleyway that ran behind the studio to Wardour Street. The alleyway was gloomy, dark patches of shadows hugged the walls and the sparse light from the streetlamp at the far end reflected feebly in the puddles of rainwater. Harry felt a prickling on the back of his neck, it was the feeling he got when someone was using dark magic, he glanced around but couldn’t make out anything in the murkiness that surrounded them. Harry gripped Draco’s hand and whispered in his ear.
“What are you feeling Harry,” Luna asked, “what emotion is worrying you the most.”
Harry finished his meal and returned to his office, he tried calling Hermione on the Talkkey, she didn’t answer so Harry ploughed on with writing more reports on the status of current cases. If he had known that being an Auror had meant writing so many reports he may have considered a different choice of career.
.’ Draco replied.
Draco guided Harry through the throng of people, arm around his shoulders, and out the door to the street behind the venue. The fresh air hit Harry and he immediately felt his legs go wobbly, he grabbed on to Draco to stop himself falling over.
“Is Professor Sprout still intending to retire at the end of the school year?”
09.49
“Harry, Harry…wait.” Draco’s face was whiter than ever, his eyes open wide with shock.
“I know exactly what you mean, being an Auror isn’t what I thought it would be. Don’t you want to be in the band anymore?”
Hermione pulled two bottles of wine from her tiny purse. “We bought some wine, should we open it now?”
Draco remained silent.
, their little voices filling the foyer with sound. Harry found himself crying, it was so charming and sweet, he felt somewhat lost as the carol ended and the elves fell silent.
“Errr, I think I’ll stick to this,” Harry held up the bottles of wine he had bought, “but thank you, I’m sure your father’s wine is great.”
Draco broke down into quiet sobs, he was clearly still traumatized by everything he had seen and been part of.
The banging on his head stopped immediately but the hammering inside his head continued unabated.
Yep - never piss Hermione off or you will regret it :)
“Let me introduce you to the rest of the band.” Draco led him round the room introducing him to the various band members, they all seemed nice guys but Harry felt out of his depth when they started asking him about his musical tastes. He thought back to Dudley’s record collection at Privet Drive, the only band that he could remember was Queen, and he only remembered that because of the song
“Professor Crane is retiring too.” Crane was the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor that had taken the position after Snape’s death. “Minerva is having a hard time finding a replacement.”
Harry nearly choked on his wine. “Neville, you blew up the bridge and chopped the head off a giant snake. I don’t think that counts as well behaved.”
“Pansy? Pansy was shit at potions.”
“All the dramatics, like when I lost it while I was wearing the horcrux pendant.” Ron gulped down his drink. “I acted like a tosser then and I’m acting like one now. I’m sorry.”
“You know she’s really pissed when she swears like that,” Harry said. “I can’t remember the last time she swore.”
Hermione stepped forward and held out a small silver muggle coin to Kreacher. “A thank you gift for dinner Kreacher.”
“Kreacher is happy to serve, I shall bring some food shortly.”
He must have drifted back to sleep as he found himself struggling to wake up from a dream of Draco calling Harry a jackass and stamping on Harry’s head with his dragon scale boots. He woke with tears sliding down his face and, although his head was still thumping, he needed a shower. Half walking, half stumbling he made his way to his bathroom and stood under the shower for a good long while, the hot water washing away the tears that kept falling.
Draco raised his head, his face was etched with fear and tears pooled in his eyes. “Please Potter, just leave it.”
Ron nodded and grinned around a mouthful of toast, “Obffeffed.”
“Fucked up is one way to put it, there was a war, a huge war, half the school got destroyed.” Harry was drunk enough that he forgot he was talking to a Muggle.
Draco raised his head and Harry could see the tears rolling down his face. “Then tell my father it will be done.”
There was a lengthy pause before Draco replied.
Hermione gasped. “And what? What happened?”
’, he sang the track over and over until the he was happy with the takes, he was a perfectionist who would settle for nothing less than a flawless performance. Harry was fascinated by the mixing process, it was so complicated, but his eyes were always drawn back to Draco. The blonde sang with his eyes closed, his face serene, and the emotion in his voice was clearly audible, he looked and sounded beatific. Harry could hardly believe that this stunning man was his boyfriend.
Harry gently pushed slightly further in, pushing deeper in small increments, the sounds falling from Draco’s mouth made Harry’s cock twitch, he wanted to listen to those sounds forever, the soft grunts, hisses and moans that made him want to scoop Draco up and never let him go. Harry pressed further until he was fully seated inside him, the tightness of Draco around him very nearly pushed him over the edge.
Rowle ignored Draco turning back to face Harry. “I think I’ll kill you with a little spell that Malfoy here knows a lot about.”
As Harry crept along the corridor towards the storage room he was surprised to hear the murmur of voices, the map still showed Draco as being alone but he could definitely hear two voices. He tiptoed his way to the open doorway and risked a glance inside. Draco was slumped on the floor with his knees pulled up to his chest leaning against an ancient looking sofa with a tartan blanket draped over the back, and to Harry’s utter astonishment a small female house elf was standing at his feet.
They followed the crowd of people who were lining up to pass through the gates to the venue. The gates were manned by two burly Muggles, who reminded Harry of Crabbe and Goyle, and every ticket holder had to walk through a large grey freestanding doorway before handing over their tickets to be scanned.
Harry looked at the purse, it was only the size of a small book but he knew she could carry almost a whole house worth of stuff around with her in it.
“I’m not obsessed, I just really like the music,” Harry said indignantly, “and what do you mean again?”
“I’m sorry I interrupted,” Harry whispered back, “I just missed you so much that I couldn’t wait to see you.”
The single spotlight lit Draco up and the crowd cheered, he held up his hands to quieten them.
Harry glanced at Draco’s arm, he was wearing a long sleeved shirt but Harry could guess what it covered.
Harry took another sip of wine and considered Draco’s message, although he seemed genuine Harry still didn’t quite trust him, but there was only one way to find out.
“Would you like some Pimplefruit wine Harry? My father made it, he fermented it in an old umbrella stand, and it’s really very good.”
Draco wouldn’t be able to apparate to Harry’s as he hadn’t visited before, and he had no access to the floo network in the Muggle world.
Harry gazed in stunned silence at the boy in front of him, although he saw him every day he hadn’t really
Harry is feeling rather delicate and has to face the music with Draco
Neville did beat Draco, he beat him three times, and as Harry predicted Draco was still in a sulky mood when they went to bed after Neville left.
Pansy tutted. “Careful darling, this is a work of art not an old rag.”
Harry held still for a second. “Ok?”

Draco pulled a vomit face. “You make me sound like a fucking Hufflepuff.”
“Hi ‘Mione, just trying to write a report but I need caffeine. Want to go grab a coffee from the Muggle place we found a few weeks back?”
find out what it is.” He slammed his glass of pumpkin juice on the table, grabbed his book bag and stomped out of the hall. The irony of mirroring Draco’s earlier actions was lost on him but not to his Gryffindor classmates.
Harry learns an interesting fact about the new improved Draco and there's an old face back in town.
, so grow up and sort it the fuck out.” Hermione cast
“What’s going on?” Harry asked. “Why do you look like you are about to explode Hermione?”
“What? Like no magic at all?” Neville was clearly surprised, Draco had been a very strong and proficient wizard.
“Guilt is a complex emotion Harry. We feel guilt about things we’ve done and things we haven’t done, guilt about other people and things we couldn’t control. You have to understand whether any of your guilt is real, really down to you, and then deal with that.”
“Maybe you should go Harry,” Hermione said shakily.

“It’s break a leg Pans, not break an arm,” Draco laughed.
Harry picked up his phone to read the message from Draco.
Harry, fully hard now, wrapped his hand around himself and began stroking up and down. “Yes, I’m stroking myself.”
Neville held out a bag to Draco. “Hermione mentioned that you had used up a lot of your herbs to treat Harry, I thought you might need to replenish your stocks.”
Harry held Draco in a hug. “When we got home after the movie I was locked in my ‘room’ under the stairs and I wished that I had a family that would come and take me home. I always felt like an alien at the Dursley’s.”
“This is the wand that killed Voldemort,” Draco whispered.
Harry forced the potion down, gagging slightly. It flowed down his throat in a slimy blob, it was like swallowing a slug. It really did taste foul, he felt it hit his stomach and he clamped his mouth closed in case the potion decided to come back up.
Peace and love xx
Draco’s face was still stony. “This is an important question Harry so please be truthful. Did you kiss me because you wanted to or because you were drunk?”
Draco’s face softened with a smile. “Thank you Gryffindork, I always wanted a surprise party but father said they were a stupid idea.”
“You can stand here,” Draco whispered, “but no further in.”
“No.” Hermione grabbed a bottle of firewhisky, dragged Harry and Ron into the guest bedroom and shut the door.
Malfoy was dressed in all black, covered by a black formal robe and his hair pulled back into a neat ponytail; he looked so much like his father that Harry did a double take. Draco held his back straight, head high and eyes forward but Harry could see that this was not out of arrogance or pride, this was the stance of someone just trying to keep himself walking without breaking down. Malfoy passed within feet of Harry but either did not see him or chose not to acknowledge him, and carried on walking towards the elevators. As he passed by the crowd began talking in excited and shocked whispers.
“Fucking wanker,” Harry muttered as he typed a response.
“What is it you have to do? It can’t be that bad.”
“Is everything ok?”
“Apparently not.” Neville took a long swallow of beer. “Anyway, you didn’t ask me here to talk about the Hogwarts faculty.” Neville gave Harry a searching look. “Is Malfoy still a dick or has he really changed?”
Harry looked at Draco in surprise. “She plays seeker for the Holyhead Harpies, I thought you would have known that, you were always a huge Quidditch fan.”

“You could do it easily with a bit of practice.”
“You’ve come so far D, you have worked through a lot of your issues but you still haven’t faced that part of your past.”
This Friday night it was Harry’s turn to host Hermione, Ron and Neville for dinner. Luna couldn’t make it as apparently it was moon frog mating season and she had to stay home in case they accidentally humped her shoes. Harry, like Hermione, was a disaster in the kitchen and, after his first attempt at making dinner resulted in a small fire in the kitchen and the loss of Harry’s eyebrows, they had all agreed that it was best to leave the cooking to Kreacher. It was Hermione’s birthday, Harry had given Kreacher free reign over the menu and the little elf was happily making mountains of vol-au-vents, a huge main course and a choice of three desserts plus a huge decorated birthday cake. Ron was always particularly happy when it was dinner at Harry’s as he enviably took home boxes full of leftovers.
Draco nodded. He let go of Harry and unbuttoned the shirt shaking it free of his body. His skin was snow white and he was so thin that his ribs and shoulder blades were clearly visible, but to Harry he was perfect. Draco turned his left arm towards Harry, the mark was vivid against the white skin, raised and red the mark appeared like an angry scar.
When they reached Wizard Wheezes Harry gave Ron a hug. “Send everyone my love, tell them I’ll see them in the new year.”
Draco pulled Harry fully into his arms wrapping them around his back. Harry inhaled the scent of Draco’s hair, the same scent he had smelled earlier that day, it was a scent he now fully associated with the blonde. Harry tilted his head, Draco was looking at him with a gentle smile on his lips, lips that looked soft and pink, Harry needed those lips on his own, he wanted to kiss Draco so badly. Before he knew it he was placing his lips on Draco’s, they were soft and warm, like velvet, he ran his tongue over them and suddenly Draco’s tongue met his, swirling together in their mouths.
“He was very good yes,” Hermione said exchanging looks with Ron.
Harry busied himself with slicing the duck to hide his blush.
Harry’s cock twitched in response, “Fuck Draco….”
“Right, you just carry on thinking that my little Gryffindork. I’m sorry about Ron, having your friends turn your back on you is awful. Only Pansy stuck by me after the war.”
“You did all this for me?” Harry asked. “Bought a tree and taught the elves to sing?”
Harry didn’t know what to say. He remembered meeting Draco in Madam Malkin’s before their first year at Hogwarts, how obnoxious he had been, and how he had made fun of Ron which was why Harry had turned down Draco’s offer of friendship. Yet his father had coached Draco to be a bigoted, elitist wanker, he had been spoon-fed those beliefs from the cradle. Young Draco knew no different or any better.
Draco collapsed to lay beside Harry, lips meeting in a slow, post orgasm kiss.
“Master Harry, welcome home.” Kreacher was waiting for Harry with a glass of red wine. “Dinner will be in thirty minutes.”
“Is that even allowed? Using a spell for Muggle band name?”
Harry immediately knew what would have happened. Bile flooded into his stomach at the thought. “He would have used that, used you, to get to me.”
Harry kissed him, and carried on kissing him late into the night until they fell asleep exhausted as the snow continued to fall in Malfoy Manor.
“You mean that Malfoy can use magic again?” Ron seethed. “You’d better get the Aurors to keep an eye on him Harry, a gringlecat never changes it’s spots.”
Harry rarely ventured in to the Muggle Liaison Office, which was part of the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes. He worked with the Obliviators a fair bit as sometimes Muggles accidentally got caught up in Auror missions and memory modifications were often required, but Muggle Liaisons was more a political department which Harry had no real need to visit. Political relationships with Muggles had become very strained during the war with many innocent Muggles dying during Voldemort’s attacks, which the Muggle government had to cover up by reporting unfortunate gas tank explosions or faulty structural engineering. The relationship was slowly improving but there was still a rift between the two worlds that occasionally caused a few issues. It was very strange that he had been asked to report there, and even stranger that Hermione was the one asking.
“And to think I used to be jealous of all the attention you got at school from Potter fans.” Draco laughed.

“Well that’s what happens when you get famous, that’s why you do it right?”
Snowflakes began to fall, the soft white flakes covering their footsteps from earlier.
Kreacher bowed his head, closing the door as he left the room.
Draco finished up his wine. “I have to get going, I have sound check in an hour and I need to grab some stuff from home first.”
“No thanks to you.” Ron muttered which earned him a kick from Hermione under the table. “Business is great thank you Malfoy.” Ron said through gritted teeth stubbornly refusing to use the name Draco.
“Hi Harry,” Luna continued to peer under the rug, “I thought I saw a Nargle hiding under here and I don’t want it to steal my shoes again.”
Draco pulled Harry into a long and sensual kiss, Draco tasted of wine, chocolate and happiness, Harry wished that this moment could go on forever.
“Do we have to do this? Surely –“
Hermione pushed open the door to the office. “You probably should just see for yourself. That’s Walter over there in the red sweater, corner cubicle.”
“See you later jackass.”
Pansy turned to Harry wiping away her tears. “That is the most beautiful song he has ever written.”
There's some good news and some bad news coming Harry's way
“I always thought you and Luna might end up together,” Harry smiled.

Harry eyed the teaspoon that Hermione was still waving around very near his hands. “I’ll take that as a yes. Thanks Hermione, you always give the best advice.” He grabbed his jacket and made a run for his office.
***************************************
Hermione’s face was a picture. “You most certainly will NOT. Harry Potter, if you even think that you –“
“Jackass.”
The image of Draco stroking his cock made his own cock twitch, he didn’t think he had ever been so aroused. Draco’s fingers danced around the waistband of Harry’s trousers, Harry moaned and ground his aching cock against Draco’s making him hiss with pleasure. Draco pulled harry down onto the old sofa, it was saggy and lumpy but big enough that they could lay down facing each other.
The party was full of Muggles but after having a few more drinks and taking Draco’s advice of ‘faking it’ Harry had a good time chatting to various people about Muggle sports, entertainment and politics. Draco was moving through the room making the time to talk to everyone present, smiling, laughing and having lots of photos taken. He had even been outside to chat to the fans who had been waiting outside since the show ended. Harry drained the last dregs of wine from his glass and made his way to the bar for a refill where he bumped into Dan, the band’s lead guitarist, who was also waiting for a drink.
“What?” Harry realized that Draco though he was disgusted. “No! I have no problem with you being gay, in fact I’m…..” It was on the tip of his tongue to admit he was gay but he just couldn’t say it. “…I’m just surprised that’s all. I had no idea.”
Harry finally bought a CD player and had been listening to the '
Harry couldn’t help but laugh. “Bloody hell Draco, I fancy the arse off you. You are as hot as fuck.”
Harry’s head was swimming with a hundred thoughts. Draco had feelings for him. Draco had shuttered his mind to protect Harry. Draco had been such a dick to him to deflect away from his real feelings. He was shocked how much Draco had risked to keep Harry safe, amazed that the boy had been able to keep his feelings locked down so tightly. Harry’s heart fluttered in his chest. He had never stopped to question his own feelings about Draco, they were pitted on opposing sides and Harry had assumed his obsession with the Slytherin was born from the need to thwart him. Yet what if it wasn’t? He reexamined his emotions. He thought about the way he was always aware of Draco’s presence, the slight tightening of his stomach whenever he was nearby, the need to follow him and be close to him. Then there were the dreams. The dreams where Harry was always chasing Draco but could never catch him, the dreams where he felt sadness when he slipped out of Harry’s grasp time and time again. The truth washed over him like a tidal wave; he had always had feelings for Draco but had always misinterpreted them, what he felt was not aversion it was attraction.
Draco finished his water. “I don’t eat or drink alcohol before a show but afterwards is another matter.” He opened a bottle of wine and poured two glasses. “Shit, I forgot to ask for a bottle of white for Pansy, would you mind asking at the bar for one Harry?”
“Ollivander said he thought the allegiance had changed to me when I took the wand from you but after the war was over the wand didn’t feel right in my hands and I never used it again. I went to see him a few years ago, he reexamined the wand and said he thought it was loyal to both of us because despite us tussling for it, in your mind you wanted to give it to me. By gifting it back to you I think it will become totally yours again.”
***************************
Hermione rapped Harry over the knuckles with the spoon from her coffee. “Please behave Harry, this is serious, you have to talk about this.”
“If Draco hadn’t have acted so quickly we would have lost you Harry,” Hermione’s eyes were bright with unshed tears.
