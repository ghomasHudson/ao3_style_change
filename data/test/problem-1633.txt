To the left of Harry, Ron was poking Hermione with his wand. Splog was chatting animatedly with Luna.
The shrieking stopped.

Warm, dry lips. The taste of peppermint.
Harry contemplated this. Something was nagging at him, wanting to be said.
"Fine with me," he said. "But I really am—”
“A book?”

“I’m just
Harry studied her: Ginny's face was small and heart-shaped, surrounded by flaming red hair.
Hermione rolled her eyes. Hagrid frowned.
And yet, when the cloaked man rounded the corner, Harry had the curious feeling that the man knew exactly where he was.
Filch hobbled around the corner, Mrs. Norris at his ankles.
A moment later, a chill spread through Harry. For a split second, he thought it was just the draft of the room. Then ice poured through his veins, freezing his blood. He watched in horror as his wand arm seized up. His fingers fossilized around his wand.
Harry gaped at him.
Curiosity getting the better of him, Harry slit the envelope open.
Finally, just seconds before class began, Malfoy entered. He ignored Harry’s stare.
“So, I should just believe you?” asked Harry. “Based on what—your assurance alone? Do you
Harry’s brow furrowed. The name wasn’t familiar. But a memory nudged forward, one of Ginny waving at a tall black boy, then running away from Harry, back across the Quidditch pitch…
“Fuck off, Malfoy,” he spat. Clutching the snitch, he threw him the Nimbus and snatched his Firebolt back.
"I said,
After a few moments, Malfoy said, “I assume you don’t speak with those Muggles anymore.”
His bottom lip was fuller than the top. It looked soft and firm.
"Bogey," laughed Harry. "Boogey."
“For once…” Harry said, his voice hoarse. “I think I know what I want—but it’s
“Sorry, sir.” He tried for an ashamed look.
Harry realized that he was implicated as well. But the cruel reality stood that Malfoy would be the one to fall. So, in case anything went wrong tonight, Harry could always…
Harry’s anger mounted. Mercilessly, he continued, “You would be. But still all you do is mock everyone. Make jokes at their grief. You deserve
“No, I like it," said Harry.
A brow was raised on Malfoy’s otherwise blank face—an unspoken challenge.
"I'm just trying to understand."
Harry rose as high as he dared. With the firelight, it was much easier to see below him than above. Underneath, robes billowing behind him, Malfoy circled like a large crow.
“Harry,” murmured Draco, tasting it. “Okay.”

"Good for her."
Harry wasn’t sure if the last part was said pointedly, or if it was just his imagination.
"Well, what then? Someone else?" he retorted, attempting to recover some of his pride. "I know you stole that hellebore from Boughbranch."
For the umpteenth time in nearly five weeks, Harry had lied to Ron and Hermione. He'd needed an explanation for his disappearances, and it was easier to pretend that he was still behind in Remedial Potions than to explain that he was secretly dueling Draco Malfoy. But each time, shame writhed in his stomach; this, along with mounting trepidation, accompanied him as he climbed down to the dungeons.
He tried to wink at her, but he felt his right eye droop sadly and slide right off his face.
Harry's heart thumped erratically. He shoved his wand between Malfoy's ribs, twisting hard.
"I don't have
"It's
"Potter,
Harry considered Malfoy, deeply intent on his homework, nothing but a silky blond head and hunched shoulders.
Malfoy gauged Harry. His expression was unreadable.
"Here you are, dearie," she said. "That'll be five sickles and seventeen knuts."
"How many fingers?" she asked briskly, holding up her hand.
This time, Harry laughed. "Merlin, you're high."
Malfoy's cheeks were flushed pink. His hair, once slicked back in an impenetrable platinum helmet, fell gently in soft strands around his face.
Harry did. He didn’t want Ron to see it; he didn’t want anyone to see it. But it wasn’t like he could say that. Harry shrugged.
"Yeah, whatever."
“Some of us do read, Potter. I know that’s difficult for you to comprehend.”
Neville groaned around a forkful of sausage. Even Dean and Seamus looked nervous.
“A marvelous idea, Malfoy,” said Boughbranch. “Perhaps if you had lent your—no doubt—

“He’s the author?” asked Harry. “He’s a wizard?”
“What,
"You're not a bloody girl," hissed Harry. Speech any louder seemed to have eluded him. "And neither am I.”
It was a strange feeling, making Malfoy nearly laugh. Harry wrapped his stinging thumb in a cotton scrap.
“Professor!” she squeaked, “the Headmistress is asking for you.”
Besides the scowl twisting his face, Malfoy seemed healthy. Beneath bare, flushed shoulders peeked the top of white bandages.
Then the corner of Malfoy’s mouth tugged up. In the golden gleam of torchlight, his eyes glittered.
, Malfoy?” he spat, ink splotches muddling with his trousers.
And then, in an instant, it all happened: the tapestry was flung aside, and Harry was pushing Malfoy to the ground and hissing under his breath, and then Malfoy was gone, and Harry was staring, wild-eyed and panting, at the faces of two dumbstruck Ravenclaws.
But it didn’t need to work. Behind Malfoy, an opening had appeared in the dungeon wall. A loud, rushing vacuum, deep and hollow, swallowed the stones. Malfoy whirled around.
“One minute,” called Harry.
He unstoppered it and handed it to Malfoy, who opened his eyes. Malfoy tilted his head back, downed the potion, and grimaced. Then he dropped his head against the dungeon wall.
"That all?" said Harry testily.
"Need something, Malfoy?" said Ron coldly.
Harry scoffed. “Thanks to people like your father, not everyone has that chance.”
“Yeah, course,” said Harry. He turned to the Fat Lady and her friend and said, “
"...Harry?" she asked, concern furrowing her brow. "What's wrong?"
does it appear?”
Sputtering blue fire glided over their heads. Dark tongues flickered across the dungeon walls.
"Doesn't it bother you that she still hates you?" Harry asked. "Even after your death?"
Only Harry was left hanging on a clothesline—nothing solid beneath his feet.
Harry left the pitch.
Harry met Malfoy's cool gaze.
He waited five minutes.
"With Occlumency," clarified Malfoy. "I know...from personal experience."
He shoved Malfoy's chest, firm and hard and much too real under his hands. Malfoy fell back as easily as if he were made of paper. His breath stuttered.
"I have you two, don't I?"
Then Harry heard, just to his right, a short intake of breath—
let’s start with who wrote you this? And
“But—”
“Okay, they didn’t see you, at least,” said Harry.
Shock colored Malfoy’s face, and something else, something bare and vulnerable.
“Let me—” said Harry. He reached for Malfoy’s bag. “What do you need?”
fucker," he said, inspecting the red scratch its claws left behind. "What is it, Gin?"
“Oh, that’s right, you shouted
But Harry should have known it wouldn’t be that easy. Nothing ever was, not with Malfoy. Malfoy lurked somewhere on him—a wart, a boil. Even when punctured and drained, he remained under Harry’s skin and took root, festering.
seen it. Why do you suppose that when we Apparate we do not recall ever visiting such a void?”
Malfoy in the hospital wing. Malfoy needing his wand. Malfoy’s letter:
“There it is again,” said Malfoy. “
Harry grimaced slightly. “That day…of the battle. When I went to meet Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest—” Malfoy flinched, but Harry hardly noticed; his heart was racing. “—I was alive, but she told him I was dead. After I’d told her that you were okay. If she hadn’t—I don’t think I’d be standing here right now.”
Then he touched his wand to Luna's forehead, reviving her, and with a lazy wave, repaired his desk.
But then Splog stopped, because next to Harry, Malfoy raised his hand. It was an unusual sight: Malfoy usually spent Transfiguration staring into space or doodling on spare parchment.
Before Harry could respond, she turned and hurried away, her hair shimmering behind her.
"Mother, it's been nearly four months," he said quietly. "You’ve got to get up.”
She pinched him. “For the tenth time, because I hate it. And I don’t need it to play for the Harpies, whatever Mum says."
him—like he was just property, like it was his purpose. He should have felt ashamed. But then Malfoy clutched his waist tighter, scratching his teeth across Harry’s pulse—and Harry leaned into him, gasping. He felt feverish; there was no room for shame, only the firm wall of Malfoy’s body, his spiced scent, the way his mouth plundered and took—
,” snapped Harry. “Try that again and I’ll hex your bits off.”
He pushed aside his robes and slid up his shirt. Against the hard expanse of pale skin, a violet bruise blossomed. As Harry watched, the edges of the bruise faded into ugly yellow.
As if pricked, Harry dropped Malfoy’s arm.
These were the thoughts currently dominating Harry's mind while in Herbology. He was too preoccupied to even notice that the Flower of Quetzalcoatl he was meant to be tending had suctioned to his thumb and was gurgling happily.
, of all people.
"Right," repeated Harry. "It's just—it's a surprise, isn't it? I didn't know you were like that."
, as if they didn't hate each other's guts, suddenly flipped a switch. Familiar heat flooded him.
The night air seemed to freeze every hair on Harry’s body. Stormy grey clouds blanketed the sky; the only light shone from the few torches blazing outside the castle entrance. For the second time that day, Harry conjured an orb of blue fire; then he made two more. Warmth spread to his toes.
Harry had never had this before, had someone just
Ginny's musk filled the room, filled Harry. The wetness between her silken thighs threatened to swallow his tongue.
Harry examined it critically: it was long and lean, with an immaculately polished mahogany handle.

" Boughbranch looked up sharply, and Harry lowered his voice to a whisper. "The whole reason you invaded my mind was to get that fucking thing."
Harry peered up at him through his good eye. Malfoy blew his hair out of his face and glowered back. But it was for a moment too long, and there was something in that look that Harry couldn't identify.
"Well, listen to this," said Hermione, pulling the morning's
"Yeah, well, don't think the Ministry would want word out that they're interrogating their own employees, would they?" replied Harry.
And then Harry realized—the man’s voice he’d heard speaking to Professor Boughbranch, in the shadows of the second-floor corridor—had belonged to Professor Roman.
“Oh, come on, Ron, where have you been—"
"Three Butterbeers, please," Harry told Madam Rosmerta, who beamed at him.
“Don’t be thick. How would it look if I came to Pomfrey with another broken bone? She’s too suspicious for her own good.”
“Showing off, Potter?” said a familiar voice. “You’re late.”
He reached out abruptly; Harry's grip tightened on his wand. But Malfoy only plucked a stray peppermint from Harry's shoulder. He unwrapped it and popped it into his mouth.
Exasperated, Ron sighed and snatched away the note. “Honestly, you two, what—”
Harry felt as though his heart would break free from his chest, or maybe it had left him already. All he knew was that he was trapped against hard stone, and Malfoy…
Harry got the impression that Malfoy wasn’t being entirely honest.
“Awful,” he lied. “Really abysmal.”
Then there was the
Repelled by an unseen force, the ropes Malfoy’s spell had conjured threw themselves back at him. He darted to the side, but a tendril wound its way around his forearm. Malfoy vanished it with a jab of his wand.
Malfoy looked up. A ghost of a smile played at the corner of his mouth.
—as Harry had read it. He had waited to see Harry's reaction.
Heat, unrelated to the twisting fire, flooded Harry. He curled his fist so tightly pain stung his palm.
Ron, chewing, had just unwrapped a chocolate frog.
"You're just special, Potter. Is that what you want to hear?”
The familiar, quiet darkness filled Harry with calm. Somehow, shrouded under his cloak and melting against the stones…was when he felt the most himself. It was as if he were not really Harry Potter, but just himself, Harry, and he was one with the castle.
"My dear lad, what's gotten your wand in a knot?" the wizard asked. "Care to join us?" he lifted his glass, sloshing wine onto his robes.
“Oh…" mumbled Harry. "That's not...exactly true."
Then there was the sound of fast approaching footsteps.
the same," said Malfoy.
"Sorry, Baron," he repeated, clearing his throat. "Don't let me keep you."
eat," he said as she swallowed. "The house elf tells me you continue to send back meals. I can't always take care of you, especially if you insist on my attendance at Hogwarts when November comes." His tone was reproachful, as if reprimanding a stubborn child.
Harry wasn't under any illusions. Anyone could be pleasant (or, at least, in Malfoy's case, only mildly insulting) for forty-five minutes. He knew Malfoy wanted to stay on his good side so that they would practice dueling.
“Pat Rumple and John Steely,” clarified Neville.
"I wouldn't be asking for help if I thought I was better than you, moron."
"Of course you can," she said soothingly. "What's that in your other hand?"
He doubted it. Malfoy always found a way to stick around, stick on him.
Malfoy raised a blond brow. "Why, going to run to McGonagall?"
Malfoy was staring at his textbook with a fixed expression.
Then he shut his book.
Boughbranch’s office door swung open. She entered and surveyed their potions down her nose.
He looked up past Ginny to the door. Malfoy stared back at him, clearly in shock.
"I've got to get going," said Harry, eyeing the gold clock above the mantel. "Remedial Potions."
to Luna Lovegood?
he dropped the potion bottle into his bag.
But to Harry’s surprise, a grin broke across Malfoy’s face. He chuckled, all white teeth and crinkled eyes, and something lurched in Harry’s stomach.
Malfoy’s eyes flashed dangerously. “Your point?”
before he crumpled to the floor. Dizzy, he squinted across the room, where a Malfoy-shaped blur was slumped, motionless. Harry scrabbled for his glasses and shoved them back onto his face, but it was too late: Malfoy was already on his feet.
Malfoy trailed off into the silence. He shifted, turning his head. His mouth nearly touched Harry's ear.
, as far as we know—no wizard has
Harry glanced at Malfoy's potion. It was, infuriatingly, perfectly pink. It only fed Harry's annoyance. It was already October, and Harry was getting no better at Potions. He’d thought he’d almost had it this morning—until his cauldron had decided to explode. And this effort so far seemed to be going worse than the previous one.
” hissed Malfoy. But it was too late: an animal-shaped streak of black shot out from between his legs and headed straight for the door.
Inexplicably, Harry felt the urge to prove him wrong.
“If you’re going to die,” reasoned Harry, “it should be a bit less pathetic.”
believes your mum killed your dad. And, honestly, it doesn’t matter what people say, about her or about anyone. If you counted the number of things people have about me—of course, you probably started half of them—”
And then he saw it: the firelight had thrown a ray onto the Black Lake, and in the distance was a golden glimmer.
“Ginny,” corrected Harry automatically. “And she’s not my girlfriend.”
Harry held his breath. He wondered if they could hear the pounding of his heart; it nearly broke his chest. An excruciating silence passed.
Harry narrowed his eyes. Malfoy didn’t look panicked anymore. Instead, he looked…annoyed. But Harry wasn’t sure what he’d done.
Harry ignored him.
Harry’s breath caught in his throat.
Harry stared, uncomprehending.
"It's alright," Ginny cut him off. "I guess it was pretty adult of you. I can’t exactly hate you for being honest, can I?"
"Um—" Ginny glanced down at herself, grass-stained and sticky with sweat. She turned back to the team. A tall black boy waved. "Can it wait? It's just that I've got to shower, and…I've got something…”
"I hit a table," grumbled Harry, climbing down the staircase. He'd had a terrible night of sleep, and Hermione's questions were grating.
It was a long time before Harry fell asleep again.
Malfoy was lounging at a desk, long legs stretched across three chairs shoved together. Dread settled in Harry's stomach: Malfoy was thumbing through a garish pink magazine.
Malfoy kissed like he was searching for something, but that something must have been too deep to reach. Roughly, he took Harry’s mouth until, gasping, stars appeared at the corner of Harry’s vision.
“Women aren’t birds,” said Hermione automatically. “...And it is, essentially.” She blushed. “Harry, you still haven’t said anything.”
evidence,
"Don't get cocky, Malfoy,” said Harry softly.
"I guess," said Harry, fingering the seal.
A few people glanced his way. Ron and Hermione gave Harry quizzical looks before returning to their work.
He wondered why Malfoy hadn’t hexed him into oblivion yet.
“Yep,” said Harry. He loaded his quill.
With a familiar dread, Harry poured his brownish sludge into a glass vial. It looked distinctly chunky.
"All I'm saying is that you'd better not have dropped Ginny for some Slytherin girl. That's just wrong, mate."
Harry thought at once, but the web’s fibers only multiplied, stretching across the invisible shield like a fisherman’s net. The spell couldn’t touch Harry, but now Harry couldn’t touch Malfoy either.
repeated Harry testily.
“What’s happened?” yawned Ron. “And why are you looking at Harry like he’s told you he thinks McGonagall’s fit?”
So, Harry groaned, bid his farewells, and made his way to detention.
let’s start with who wrote you this? And
of a whistle. Gryffindor team descended onto the grass. Ginny noticed him and jogged over.
The silvery web that shot from Malfoy’s wand caught Harry off guard.
It had been a strange comment, thought Harry. Malfoy knew very well that Harry could do a Vanishing spell, as the Eighth Years had practiced it in Transfiguration just that day.
Malfoy shrugged. “Purebloods are a different breed. Lineage and all that. But to most people, it doesn’t matter. After all, nothing really matters anymore.”
“No, I told Ron, didn’t I?” frowned Harry. “I had—”
Wordlessly, he held out the Firebolt. Smirking, Malfoy took it (Harry winced) and offered his own broom.
Harry forbid his eyes from drifting to the Slytherin table. He took his usual seat.
Through a mouthful of sausage, Ron managed to say, “You don’t know what goes on in families like Malfoy’s, Harry. Those old pureblood families are knee-deep in weird shit. And they have ties
“Who?” said Harry, distracted. He was watching Ron. He hadn’t thought, just handed his homework over. The words on the page weren’t really his own, but Malfoy’s. If Ron thought about them too closely...
Malfoy let out a short breath. He said flatly, "I wanted to know where you've kept my wand.”
"Maybe not," said Harry, “but I think it's in your best interest to tell me."
"I know what's going on in your tiny pinhead, Potter," muttered Malfoy. "Don't get used to it."
"You've just healed me!" Malfoy said furiously.
Harry lifted his head.
Through November, he continued to meet Malfoy in that damp dungeon classroom. They’d duel; Harry would win, Malfoy would insult him, and then they’d duel again. In between shooting jets of fire and blasting desks apart, they’d slump on the ground, catch their breaths, and Harry would ask Malfoy about the four uses of buttercups or the ingredients of a Forgetfulness Potion. Rolling his eyes, Malfoy would oblige.
He was a flower to be opened, petal by petal—but he wasn’t, because he wasn't a fucking
been bothering you?”
Malfoy had begun to pack up. "Go right ahead," he said neutrally. He raised his hand. "Professor, I'm meant to see the Headmistress at half nine, as she informed you earlier."
Harry rolled his eyes. “Well, you both have a fetish for books.”
“Come on, Potter, I’ll even help you with your Potions homework,” said Malfoy, exasperated. “Merlin knows you need it."
“Yeah, it does, actually.”
"Okay," said Harry. "Didn’t know you enjoyed cat food."
In tandem, the two kicked from the ground. Faintly illuminating the sky, the flames rose with them.
Heat crept up Harry’s neck as the words coiled around him once again. The image of Draco Malfoy, unbidden, surfaced: his slender fingers folding parchment, then sliding down to touch Harry’s, slipping the note into them.
“Why?” asked Hermione innocently. “Does it make you uncomfortable?”
He sighed again, deeply. "Look, Potter, I'm sorry, alright? Just—drop it. I'll be ecstatic if I never touch your mind with the length of a broomstick ever again."
he said enthusiastically. He bent low over his essay, reinvigorated.
All these weeks, Harry had taken for granted his blissfully Malfoy-free existence; it seemed he couldn't have a good thing forever.
SHACKLEBOLT: SIMPLE OR SIMPLY INSANE?
“You did. He may have been just a Death Eater to you, but to me—he was my father,” said Malfoy bitterly. “And Crabbe was my friend.”
be in the library right now. I could get away from the noise in the common room
Malfoy glared at him for a second, then looked away. He was—Harry realized—embarrassed.
"...and then she just up and left," Harry finished, frowning down his bottle.
Trying to sound as if he couldn’t have cared less, Harry said, “You alright, Malfoy? You seem…off.”
Nervously, Harry licked his lips. Malfoy was observing him with a strange intensity that made him uncomfortable.
why you tried to read my mind to find it.”
this?” said Harry. “I mean, I could tell anyone about you—the school, the papers—don’t you realize?”
From behind the suit of armour emerged a small, black cat with unusually large ears and a tufted tail like a lion's.
But the ghost that turned to face him wasn't Myrtle. Gaunt-faced, with horrible, blank staring eyes and robes spattered with blood—was the Bloody Baron.
It worked. Heat spread through him like a kiss just as Malfoy, eyes alight once more, raised his wand.
“Ever the pompous prick,” said Harry, but there wasn’t much bite to his words.
Harry fiddled with the edge of his sleeve, Malfoy with his fingernails.
. He was a
"I can walk on my own," he told her as he was led up the stairs and through corridors.
Malfoy's smirk faded as the ashes, smeared across Harry's fingertips, drifted to the stone floor like black snow.
Hermione started, seeming to realize that she'd been staring at Harry peculiarly. “Um, do you mind, Harry…?”
But as always with Dumbledore, Harry was unsure. Perhaps, in a last bid for his life, Dumbledore had been bluffing. Perhaps he had been wrong.
Harry pulled his cloak tighter around him. Shrouded against the shadows, he crept along the corridor. As he reached the corner, the voices became words.
Ron eyed Harry's head lolling on his sister's thigh and said, “So, remind me again. Why aren't you two together?”
Malfoy stilled under the blackboard. Then it liquidized, melting into a hundred, glistening black salamanders; like spilled ink, they raced across the stone floor before disappearing into dark smoke.
what he’d been thinking, how he’d imagined Malfoy’s body against his own...
“No, nothing like that,” said McGonagall, smiling slightly. “This meeting is for any concerns you might have regarding N.E.W.T.s, schoolwork, graduation—really anything regarding your last year at Hogwarts. After all, this is a pivotal time for students. Extraordinarily stressful, some might say. Though, in comparison to your earlier years, Potter, it might not be,” she finished graciously.
“What the
"Well,” said Harry, “what do you like?"
Harry held up the treats. Malfoy rolled his eyes as if the exchange alone was an inconvenience. He didn’t bother with a response.
had to worry about—status, lineage, duty,
An impressive four minutes later, pink and short of breath, he arrived at the dungeons. On the board, Boughbranch had written the instructions for a hair-restoring potion, along with a note that she would be by periodically to check on their progress.
"Yeah no, of course," Harry told Ron, who looked unconvinced. "That's not what's happening at all."
It was this fact that made Harry uncomfortable. He told himself that it was why he was meeting Malfoy in the dungeons, when he could be in the common room watching Dean and Seamus charm their homework to fly repeatedly into Parvati's hair.
“What?”
Malfoy sighed, “Potter, I know you have an insufferable need to help people to feel good about yourself, but I think I can disarm someone on my own.”
headline: CHOSEN ONE CHOKES ON COCK. Has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it?”
It was too much;
"Careful, Malfoy, your nose is turning black," said Harry, searching the textbook's index.
“Sorry,” he muttered. “That was rude.”
With that, Malfoy left the armoury.
Malfoy’s laugh clung to Harry, followed him all the way to bed.
was he going to lose to Malfoy, Firebolt or not.
Malfoy snorted and said, “Don’t be.”
. Ever since I saw you both in your mind—what I felt when you looked at me—” His voice was hoarse, as though he had not used it in a long time. Harry wondered if that was how Malfoy sounded when he first woke up, or maybe when he was about to—
A deep shame weighed on him. It wasn’t as though last night was a surprise. Strangely, now that Harry thought about it, it had felt...inevitable.

Blowing a loud raspberry, Peeves dropped his last armful of crackers on the Hufflepuff table. They exploded on impact, shattering ceramic plates and patterned teapots. Pumpkin juice was flung into the bewitched clouds on the ceiling.
"But I don't have a copper rod.”
"No...
Harry paused. He could beg Hermione—but it was getting increasingly difficult to be around her and Ron nowadays. And he had a strange unwillingness to leave quite yet; unlike the common room, the classroom was quiet. Even Malfoy's company had been...somewhat pleasant. No, that was too generous. It had been tolerable.
“What did I say? Oh—that again. George, was it? Or Fred?” Malfoy shrugged carelessly. “Not much difference either way, is there?”
“Right.”
"What do you want, Potter?" said Malfoy, wary at once, though he didn't seem surprised to see Harry. Perhaps it was because he'd seen Ginny leave nearly in tears.
“Leave the fucking cat, Malfoy,” said Harry.
"I suppose it doesn't matter," said Hermione. "Although," she added thoughtfully, "it does bring up the question of
“Sure, Potter.”
," he said.
As the sounds of rummaging and rifling filled the classroom, Harry saw Malfoy tear off a piece of parchment, scribble something, and fold it in half.
“I’ve got it!” Harry said hastily. “You’ll be late for Arithmancy. I’ve got a free period—you just go.”
“You’ve been avoiding me,” said Harry.
the one familiar with Remedial Potions," said Malfoy.
A look of amazement spread across Ron's face.
Harry checked his watch: a quarter to twelve. He stared out the window into the night. It was black and cloudy; not a single star broke the sky.
"As if I—I couldn't care less about
"No," said Harry, insulted.
sounded in the darkness. Then a girl’s scream echoed through the corridors, followed by a boy’s cursing and Peeves’s piercing cackle.
Then irritation overtook him.
Most of all, it was uncertainty that plagued Harry. He
"Anyway," continued Malfoy, "I was just taking you up on your offer."
“Bertrand’s Law states that a Vanished object may only be successfully Recalled in a different locus if certain prerequisites are met,” recited Padma. “That is to say, the witch or wizard must possess sufficient will and the correct technique; the object must be tangible or corporeal; and the object must be Recalled in its entirety, or else its fundamental attributes may be altered beyond recognition.”
Malfoy passed the pipe to Harry. The embers stayed magically lit, sparks dancing within their glass prison. The moment seemed surreal, like an unusually vivid dream Harry would have during an afternoon nap.
"In Laughing Draught?" finished Malfoy. He looked momentarily impressed. "Yes, but this isn't it. Related, though."
she said. “You’re acting quite strangely, Harry. I think you should know.”
At that moment, Peeves swooped down above a gaggle of entering first years.
behind him.
Harry shook his head, needing to emphasize his point—Malfoy
Rubbing his eyes, Harry looked up. Hermione was clutching a slip of parchment, a book splayed open on her lap.
Harry pulled away and snapped, "Don't be ridiculous.”
Malfoy raised a blond eyebrow. "Convincing, Potter."
"Skeeter then just goes on to insult Kingsley for the rest of it," said Hermione, folding the paper. "But it's interesting, isn't it?"

Hermione bent down to help him gather his books.

But his fingers continued to tingle, and his pulse skipped, unsteady.
was the anchor of his future—
"I've thought it over," Harry told Malfoy carefully, “and I've decided what I want."
"Is it...legal?" Harry squinted at it. Surprise and curiosity had tempered his irritation.
Of course, Malfoy had yet to show.
Malfoy stared.
It was empty. There was no sign that anyone had been there recently; the Dursleys could have been on holiday for all he guessed, judging by the thin layer of dust that coated the kitchen countertops. Indeed, the only thing that suggested otherwise was that the television had been left on.
“Yeah well, I didn’t, so shut up about it,” said Harry. “No one cares about how much you hate Muggles or how filthy you think they are either.”
“It’s all right, Professor, really,” said Harry hastily. “It was just a thought.”
” he yelled, blasting a jet of water into the ebbing flame. “
Professor Ivor Roman was seated behind a mahogany desk, massive and glittering with large gems. For a long moment, he surveyed the class, one long finger languidly caressing his goatee. He looked as if he were watching an ant colony in a fishbowl.
But Harry was now questioning what he was doing in the first place.
Malfoy snorted. “He said you weren’t a waste of space? Charming, Potter.”
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. “You mean you did yourself a favour.”
Harry looked up. He met Malfoy's gaze. Then, quite deliberately, he placed his wand to the parchment and burnt it to a crisp.
Harry felt a sense of loss as Ginny jogged back to her team. But, to be honest, he didn't know what he'd planned to ask her anyway.
Pretty tame for him, Harry thought as he hurried away, Ron and Hermione in tow.
The tick in Malfoy’s jaw had stopped. But Harry was unstoppable.
Dread formed in the pit of Harry's stomach. He felt as though something terrible was about to happen, and he thought he knew what it was. He looked at the door. Then he glanced over his shoulder.
"She's in the pipes," Harry muttered. He squinted suspiciously at the largest faucet, expecting at any minute that Moaning Myrtle would come swooping out of it.
Luna squinted at him, looking puzzled. “What
—it's
It didn’t seem like nothing. Harry bit his lip. Malfoy’s eyes flickered downward so quickly that Harry thought he might have imagined it.
The door creaked open. Harry tensed.
"I trust you'll make sure he drinks that, Potter. You have five minutes.” She retreated to her office.
“You’re going too—” Harry momentarily forgot what he was saying, distracted by the way Malfoy’s jaw flexed. “Um, I think we should—” Malfoy bit his lip—“slow down.”
"Piss
“Blimey, Harry, who gave you this? Because that’s sure as hell not your handwriting.”
Scowling, Malfoy pulled his shirt back down. Harry watched the trail of hair disappear underneath his trousers.
," Harry said. "Malfoy stole hellebore from Boughbranch's stores. I'm sure of it."
But when they reached Prunella's Pet Shop a couple of hours later, it became apparent that Ginny could hold it in no longer. She had been scrutinizing a box of owl treats for Pig for the whole of five minutes when, finally, she said, "Harry, I want to ask you something, and all I want is the truth."
From the wall, Professor Dumbledore let out a loud snore.
Malfoy stared. Those grey eyes, forever capricious, were shining with something like—
It wasn't until ten to eight that the three made their way back to the castle, red-faced and worn out from the cold, but happy nonetheless.
For a split-second, Harry had the urge to throw his cloak over Malfoy as well—but the thought of Malfoy so close, pressed up against him, was paralyzing…
Malfoy was just playing with him, Harry decided. He hadn't even been in class that day. Logically, Harry knew it was because Malfoy treated house points like chump change, but he couldn't help fixating on Malfoy’s absence like he did his other strange behaviors. He felt pathetic for giving the whole thing so much thought. He should've gagged at the letter, scoffed at it with Ron, and tossed it in the rubbish.
The Lady snipped, “A little privacy, do you mind?”
It was perhaps a stupid and naïve decision. Harry raised his wand.
“Harry, who—?” Hermione paused. “Emily Brontë,
Now, Harry’s unease seemed silly. Slowly, he relaxed.
, Harry, who gave you this? Because that’s sure as hell not your handwriting.”
Face impassive, Malfoy watched him. But he just said, “You’re special, Potter.”
Harry’s heart thudded to his feet. Any sign of sleep left him at once.
“Because, Harry,” said Luna gently, “You,
really
"Yeah, of course," he said.
Harry supposed not. He thought for a minute, watching Malfoy's pale face, stubborn and set. Despite Malfoy’s efforts to appear stoic, there was a touch of something vulnerable in his grey eyes.
Harry felt Malfoy’s glare. As forgiving as Splog seemed, he doubted Malfoy would have been given the same treatment.
Red patches appeared on his freckled face as he read it.
“You know an awful lot about my relationships.”
The kneazle was sort of cute, thought Harry. Its fur was so black that the only features Harry could see were a small, pink tongue and two large, golden eyes.
“It’s a quote from a book.”
," said Malfoy, pulling a face.
"You're on probation," Harry realized. "You
"Er—what exactly are you two doing?" asked Harry.
They climbed up another set of stairs.
The three of them spent the evening playing cards with Neville, Seamus, Dean, and Ginny—until Dean and Ginny got into such a row over points that they began setting decks of cards on fire.
It looked as if that were the answer Malfoy had least expected. He seemed at a loss. At last, he said quietly, “How can you know that?”
with Ron and Neville. Malfoy was nowhere to be seen.
Malfoy sounded exasperated. He pushed his pale hair out of his eyes, and Harry glimpsed a gnarly scratch on the back of his hand.
“Stellar choice of location, Malfoy,” Harry complained, vigorously rubbing his hands together and blowing into them.
When the ninety minutes were up, Harry poured his potion into a vial and set it on Boughbranch's desk. From this angle, he could see Malfoy back in the store closet. Harry didn't know what else he needed, since his potion looked irritatingly perfect.
He rounded a corner, then stopped abruptly. His breath came in choked gasps, and his thoughts—
Finally, Roman spoke.
“I’ve been sitting next to you for

But Harry thought Hermione was right. The whole thing

Harry fingered the edge of his parchment, creased it, and smoothed it out again. He could feel Malfoy’s gaze.
"Right," said Harry, "of course."
The three made their way to Charms. The conversation weighing on him, Harry took his seat. He watched the door for Malfoy.
outside."
But when Harry arrived, Hagrid was nowhere to be found. Instead, he found Luna and, for some strange reason, Parvati Patil on their knees in Hagrid's vegetable patch.
“Skeeter’s upped her game,” scoffed Harry.
Suddenly, a knock at the door sounded. A third-year girl with blonde ringlets entered. When she saw Harry, her face turned the color of his potion (a deep red rather than the pale pink it was supposed to be).
believe—”
Harry wasn't sure if Malfoy intended to poison someone, but he wouldn’t be entirely surprised if he did. And yet...he couldn't help but remember Professor Dumbledore's words to Malfoy that night he'd fallen from the tower.
For some reason, Malfoy hadn’t seemed worried.
At last, Malfoy sighed, “Things would have been simpler if you had, Potter.”
“No,” said Hermione softly. Her eyes followed Harry’s. “Imagine finding out about your father’s death this way. The

Though everything in him protested, he drew from Malfoy’s grip. Malfoy released him easily.
Boughbranch glimpsed him. At once, she straightened and said shortly:

look. Then her eyes dropped below his jaw. They widened.
"How am I supposed to know about some old codger? I'm a blood traitor, remember?" retorted Harry. "Don't know a lot famous wizard-wise."
Needing something to do, he rolled the plum, small and hard, between his fingers.
called Malfoy.
,” he muttered, pointing to his bag.
Malfoy scoffed, but his eyes betrayed him. He looked away and ran a hand through his hair, which fell, as always, like silk.
" said Harry.
"I'm not a ponce, Malfoy, if that's again what you're suggesting."
“Oh—right,” said Harry, feeling stupid.
Ginny caught sight of Harry near the stacks and waved. Tentatively, he smiled back at her.
Hermione sat in the old squashy armchair by the fire, engrossed in her Arithmancy textbook. At her feet, Ron played Exploding Snap by himself.
Finally, the man’s voice said, “Yes. I thought I’d sensed that infernal poltergeist, but it must’ve taken off.”
“That’s not the point, Malfoy,” said Harry firmly. “The point is that—however shit he was, there was a glimmer of
“Still worth mentioning,” muttered Seamus. “Anyway, I see the royal prick himself is even avoiding the Great Hall now.”

"Hermione," Harry said tentatively, “have you heard of something called hellebore?"
Ron guffawed and turned the cover. Groaning, Harry craned his neck to read:
"But you said you don’t think about me at all,” said Malfoy.
He’d thought he hated Malfoy. And yet he let Malfoy shove him against walls, smirk into his ear, bite his collarbone. Each time he thought of what people would
Silence, heavy and awkward. The scratching of Madam Pomfrey’s quill. Harry’s thudding heart.
Looking disappointed when Harry didn’t respond, Malfoy remarked, “That’s it then?”
"Because Roman’s a vampire?" said Ron eagerly.
Malfoy's eyes widened. Harry had him.
He brushed past Malfoy to his desk.
“Alright there, Malfoy?”
After a moment, he rolled his sleeve back up his left forearm. The Mark was exposed again, stark under the blue light. Harry realized it wasn’t black at all, but badly faded, mottled and ugly.
. Harry felt sick.
"Never mind," he replied. He checked his watch. "I've got to run. Let Hagrid know I stopped by if you see him, will you?"
“It must be hard being the Man,” said Harry thoughtfully. “Or God, even, having to sentence him.”
, my—”
“My mother,” said Malfoy, “is none of your fucking business.”
“They’re two of the suspects in the Malfoy case, remember?” said Ron, scribbling. “The two Aurors who guarded Malfoy’s cell the night of the murder. Clive Hawkes, the Head Auror, assigned them.”
Harry didn't fare much better in the rest of his classes. He would forget Malfoy for an hour at a time, but then, suddenly, he would be all Harry thought about.
Something in Malfoy’s tone reminded Harry of a different time—and then he realized why he’d gotten the impression that Malfoy wasn’t being honest earlier. When Malfoy lied, his voice became oddly flat.
Harry felt the edge of Malfoy’s smirk when he breathed, "Did I offend you, Potter?"
Itching his nose with his quill, Ron snorted. “Give him a break, ‘Mione, you sound like Mum. He’ll tell us soon enough. Won’t you, Harry?”
Alarm filled Harry.
Malfoy dashed aside, shock on his face.
Boughbranch’s voice sounded from the darkness. “Is everything alright?”
Harry paused, dumbfounded. That wasn’t an answer he was expecting.
And strangely, though Harry hadn’t felt the truth of his words while he was saying them, he suddenly felt warmth bubble in his stomach, like a glug of good butterbeer.
At once, Harry sobered.
Finally, Harry reached the entrance to Gryffindor commons. The Fat Lady was giggling, corpulent and shiny. Next to her, her toothless old wizard friend poured wine. Harry felt as though he were watching something he shouldn’t be.
It was the most Malfoy had ever spoken in class. And it was certainly the most…earnest Harry had ever heard him, maybe ever.
Malfoy digested this. His grey gaze flickered over Harry, thoughtful, curious. Then he smirked, dropped his bag to the floor, and raised his wand.

“I am,” said Malfoy. He gave Harry an incomprehensible look.

In Classroom No. 10, Malfoy sat cross-legged in the corner. He was reading a frayed, yellow-paged book. As he turned the pages, dark patterns shifted across the stone walls.
But Harry’s bacon was looking like bits of flayed skin.
Softly, Harry murmured, “I always wondered if you had it. I didn’t know for sure.”
“Feeding a kneazle,” said Malfoy wryly.

There was a dreadful

Irritation flaring, Harry gritted his teeth. “Tell
"She'll be back," said Malfoy carelessly, taking another drag from the pipe. "Needy bitch."
"Defense," said Harry shortly.
He left the tower and climbed upstairs to the common room.
"Harry," hissed Ernie Macmillan, his partner, "
Through their bickering, Harry spotted the newspaper that had slid off Hermione’s lap. It was that morning’s Daily Prophet. On the front page was a photograph of a man with salt-and-pepper hair and a deep-etched scowl, as though he had never felt happy, not even for one day of his life. Above the photograph was the headline:
Every inch of Harry was glacial down to his blankly staring eyelids. Desperately, he imagined fire filling his blood, shooting through his veins. Malfoy began to stir. With every particle in his frozen body, Harry thought,

Malfoy whipped out his wand, but it was too late. Peeves flipped upright and cried, “STUDENT OUT OF BED! STUDENT OUT OF BED IN THE DUNGEONS!”
A blonde, curly-haired girl disentangled herself from the group. She looked vaguely familiar. Her girlfriends giggling behind her, she strode towards Harry.
REALLY
"Uh, I never took it."
“‘What if,’ ‘what if,’” murmured Luna. “Don’t you think you’ve suffered enough?”
“Green?” said Harry hopefully, ignoring Arleigh’s snigger.
“You could say my father deserved what he got,” said Malfoy. “Or you could tell me that I deserved worse. I know you think it.”
“Potter,” Malfoy sighed against his lips, “you taste like pumpkin. Why the fuck do you taste like pumpkin?”
“You wouldn’t know poetry if it hexed you in the arse,” retorted Malfoy.
"On his

Sparks danced across Ron's schoolbooks, which he had earlier pushed carelessly to the floor.
him. In fact, Harry thought Malfoy might curse him right then and there.
Malfoy looked up. His grey gaze held Harry’s.
Nine o’clock came reluctantly that night. When Harry arrived at the dungeons, he found Boughbranch at her desk. Two cauldrons sat on adjacent tables in front of her.
She came over. Her red hair was woven into a plait and dotted with tiny white flowers. Harry had never seen Ginny wear it that way before; it somehow changed her.
Harry frowned. “Is there something wrong with that?”
“That wand...” he said slowly, “it’s yours.”
Harry was flummoxed by the sudden turn the conversation had taken. “Don’t talk about things you have no idea about, Malfoy.”
“What, being a snitch doesn’t make you popular?” said Harry.
But then her thin chest fluttered, and her dull eyes blinked once, slowly. Looking into her flat gaze, Harry got the impression of a shallow, still pond.
He caught his breath. Then he tapped his wand on the spot where Malfoy used to be. Shimmering, Malfoy materialized. He was scowling, but Harry detected fading panic in his eyes.
Malfoy straightened immediately, scowling, but swallowed his retort.
He shook his sleeve back over the Mark and glared at Harry. Malfoy seemed uncomfortable under the scrutiny. But he was defiant all the same.
Harry made a split-second decision. He hurried out the open door and turned sharply down the Charms Corridor.
you to know it was me, genius."
“The broom doesn’t matter, Malfoy,” said Harry.
"Like what?" asked Luna. She tilted her head inquiringly.
“And yet…” said Malfoy calmly, “it was important enough that you tried to shield it from me.
Surprise abated Harry’s anger. He paused for a moment. “You know, we’re really not like that.”
“What do you think you’re doing?” said Harry, taken aback.
"Er, thank you?"
The flames hissed; the potions bubbled. Boughbranch coughed; she turned a page. Malfoy seemed to be waiting for something.
Malfoy looked at him pityingly. "I'd buy a mirror if I were you, Potter."
“So, it’s true,” he said and snickered. “You really lived in a
Boughbranch appeared. “Well, what are you two waiting for? Get to work. I’ll be in my office.”
and the wizarding world’s greatest, most notorious sorcerer was vanquished,” said Malfoy. He chuckled derisively, then composed himself, remembering that he was meant to be playing nice. “Please, I’m not a
“No,” said Malfoy softly, “I didn’t mean it.”
Then he saw, among the fallen books and parchment, a note written in familiar, smooth script:
One arm cradling his ribs, Malfoy rooted through his bag. Harry heard the clatter of inkbottles.
“Malfoy, I’m—” Harry began.
Professor Sprout, looking on critically, said, “If these don't help your pest problem, nothing will.” When she saw the three, she tapped her watch pointedly and headed for Greenhouse Four.
Now, this wasn’t nearly enough time. It hadn’t been Harry’s fault. Not to mention that none other than Malfoy had been sitting next to him (Ron and Hermione had escaped with only a pair of backward guilty looks).
“You’re pureblood too,” countered Hermione, “and I think the Ministry would have suspected Narcissa Malfoy if she were actually guilty. I mean, they released her the same day Lucius was murdered. And the Ministry
Embarrassment crept up on Harry—and
. “That’s entirely different, Ron, and you know it,” she said, looking disgusted. “
"Yes," she nodded vigorously, reminding Harry of a bobblehead, “of course you do!"
“Speaking now, are you?” Harry muttered as Boughbranch advanced, grey eyebrows especially frizzy.
Boughbranch eyed Harry. He hoped his expression didn't reveal that the assignment had completely slipped from his mind.
There was the sound of heavy footsteps, and then Splog was frowning down at him.
But instead, Malfoy sighed, “Fine. Let’s get on with it then.”
It was different. Malfoy was hard where Ginny was soft. Even his lips were rough, pressed against Harry’s. And he was tall—taller than Harry, even, by a couple of inches.
"And you, pet, that'll be four sickles," the cheery Mrs. Prunella told Harry. He looked away from Malfoy to pay her, and by the time he did, Malfoy had left the shop.
“What they’re capable of,” said Malfoy quietly, “is who they really are.”
“Er, what are you—”
, Malfoy.”
Harry found his voice. “Two things, you mean.”
Harry whirled around. Malfoy stood in satin dressing robes and bare feet, looking past him.
“About what you’d expect,” said Harry.
soft, Harry realized. Up close, his face seemed to belong to someone else; flickering blue light played in his eyes, softened the angle of his jaw. His hair shone almost white. A slight dimple pressed one cheek.
Malfoy, de-petaling his chamomile flowers, glanced over at Harry.
Malfoy leaned in. Unconsciously, Harry held his breath. Malfoy’s scent was so distinctly masculine, woodsy and pepperminty, that it threw him off for a moment. He felt strangely lightheaded.
Pain stung Harry’s scalp. His head was jerked backwards. Malfoy kissed his throat, open-mouthed and wet.
Hermione gave him a long look.
“Wondered when you’d show, Potter,” said Malfoy. “Dear Gwyneth keep you?”
"I'm fine, Ginny," he said, plastering a smile. "It's nothing. Another time."
. Harry gripped his wand.
"Yes, Professor," said Harry while Malfoy snorted.
"When's Boughbranch going to be back? You'd think she'd show up soon, seeing as she's forcing us to be here on a Saturday night," muttered Harry, all too willing to change the subject. "At least then you'd finally shut up."
"Hullo! We've just arrived," said Ron.
"Harry, what's
It wasn't like Harry had much else he felt like doing. He followed Crookshanks.
Malfoy scoffed. His eyes cleared and crinkled at the edges. It was like a reward.
“Really, Potter, I have to ask how you and Weasley made it in here,” continued Malfoy as if Harry had spoken. “Granger’s help, I suppose. I wonder, are all the Weasleys this useless?”
Leaning against the cold stones, Harry steadied himself. On his way over, he’d reminded himself of something: he had dirt on Malfoy.
"I know," he said quietly.
how was the 'Mid-Year Review' with Professor McGonagall?"
you I’d save you one,” said Luna. She frowned. “You’ve got more Wrackspurts than ever, Harry.”
Harry snorted. “The peacocks were a nice touch. And the stuff about Lucius Malfoy not really being dead…”
But in that corridor, hadn’t Roman been protecting Malfoy? What had he said exactly?
A moment. There was no sound except for their barely discernible breathing.
"Don't be ridiculous, Potter," said Malfoy, quieter. "We both know you won't hurt me."
"Order of Merlin, First Class..." said Malfoy quietly, grey eyes never leaving Harry's. "And all those other medals...you must be proud, Potter."
“Er—right,” said Harry.
Internally, Harry winced at how clumsy he sounded. But he believed every word he said.
“Nice one, Potter,” spat Malfoy.
To the eighth years in Gryffindor Tower, now more concerned with solving a murder mystery than passing their N.E.W.T.s, the list of culprits was endless.
“Sweet virgin Potter,” said Malfoy, laughing softly. It was a rich, musical sound.
“Gentle the flame, throw in the ice-steeped Tulsi with the seeds, then bring it to a rapid boil,” said Malfoy with a cursory glance.
And for Malfoy to look stunned, as if it wasn’t what he’d been hinting all along, from that first day in Potions to that Quidditch match, where he’d caught Harry’s wrist and
hissed Malfoy, eyes flashing, "and that's beside the point." He glanced over and added, "Use a pipette for the taro juice."
“What?”
"Well, what would you like to do?" he asked carefully.
” he said, pointing straight at Malfoy.
Anger drained away from Harry, leaving him with overwhelming, empty tiredness.
"I didn't save the card," he snapped. "Ron just handed it to me, alright?"
"I'm expecting at least two dueling sessions from this, Potter," he said instead.
aren’t you taking Potions this year?” groaned Harry after dinner, stretching across Ginny’s lap. “Then I’d have a decent partner.”
"But you aren't."
had he just
"What?"
,” finished Hermione, nodding with raised eyebrows. “Right.”
Malfoy continued to watch him. His expression was unreadable.
While Harry could very well conjure fire in real life, he had little idea how the process theoretically worked. He suspected Professor Splog wouldn’t accept the real answer: that he’d learned it from living in a tent with Hermione while on the run from Lord Voldemort.
Harry shrugged again. After the Battle, the Ministry had retrieved the snitch from the Forbidden Forest. Harry had accepted it with reluctance. At least the stone that had been inside it was forever hidden, unremarkable on the forest floor, just as he’d intended.
Boughbranch called from the front of the room, "I don't have a problem with your chatting, boys, but I need two flawless potions by the end of the hour."
He lay, breathing unsteadily. He was again in his own bed, in the eighth-year boys' dormitory—at Hogwarts, not Privet Drive.
“We were just talking about your Dad’s paper, Luna,” said Ron, grinning broadly.
Harry had left the envelope on the table. He turned it over in his hands; it felt expensive.
Hermione started; she seemed to realize that she'd been staring at Harry peculiarly. “Um, do you mind, Harry…?”
Then Malfoy drew his wand from his sleeve and raised it.
“You wondered?” asked Malloy.
"Well, it can be. Certain strains of it are toxic. That's why it's used in minor quantities in the Draught of Peace," she explained. "We worked with it in fifth year. Should be in chapter eight of your Potions book."
Of course, that would have been too easy.
Malfoy nodded.
Emboldened, Harry continued, “So…she just left you behind? Isn’t that a bit, I don’t know, selfish?”

The haze began to clear. Slowly, the figures took shape, and Harry saw a familiar woman in an unfamiliar room.

To clarify: the story until now has been the events preceding Hermione's discovery ("the past"). Next chapter will resume with the events after it ("the present”). Yay for nonlinear timelines!
know how to read, don’t you?”
Then Parvati said quietly, “Stop running.”
At first, it didn't seem very much like a dream, because Harry opened his eyes and found himself in his own bed. He tried to sit up, but an indomitable force pressed down on him, pinning him to his mattress. The most he could do was lift his neck, and even that was exhausting.
“It’s not about being happy…” muttered Harry. “I mean, what you want isn’t always the right choice. What if it’s the worst one?”
"Great," agreed Harry. He felt vaguely nauseated.
Hands clamped over his ears, he dodged a blue ray shot his way and rolled behind Roman's desk.
Malfoy sighed. With a tenderness that Harry didn't know he was capable of, Malfoy brushed Narcissa's greying hair out of her face.
Shock froze Harry. His heart leapt to his throat; he nearly choked on it.

Hermione stalked over and snatched the book from his face. “You

Harry peered into Malfoy’s grey eyes; they crinkled at the corners.
“Mm,” said Ginny slowly. “You know, when Hermione and Ron told me you’d been seeing someone in secret—”
It really did swallow him, then.
“Professor Roman?” said Hermione sceptically. “But he’s been at Hogwarts the whole time, how could he possibly—”
Harry stared, nonplussed. His head was beginning to ache (did heads ache in dreams?).
Pink patches appeared high on Malfoy's cheekbones. He ran a hand through his pale hair, looking equal parts embarrassed and irritated.
Ever so slightly, Malfoy smiled. Harry's gaze dropped to his mouth. Red bloomed on Malfoy's lower lip, dark and wet.
Harry guessed where Malfoy was going with this.
"Well, Goyle wants to kill me now that his father's got life in Azkaban, Pansy left me to marry her Swedish plank of a cousin, and Zabini's a conceited prick. Oh, and Crabbe got
She was, like Harry had seen in Malfoy's head, entirely conscious. She was just…gone, as if half-kissed by a dementor.
“Why can’t you?” repeated Luna.
hissed an uptight-looking Ravenclaw.
It was at that moment that Harry realized something.
“So, you pocketed it just in case you broke a rib…?”
“It’s getting late,” said Malfoy.
Hidden in his invisibility cloak, Harry crept around the corner. He’d just made a narrow escape: he’d thought that everyone was in the common room, but as he’d crept down the fourth-floor corridor he’d heard, from an empty classroom, Neville’s unmistakable squeal.
Without another thought, Harry hurtled down, down, down—then straight for the lake. He shot across it so quickly the blackness rippled; the flames had trouble following him. Though he could no longer see the snitch, he knew it was there.
Harry stared at Malfoy's tall back as he left the classroom. He wasn't certain what hellebore was, but he was sure of one thing: Malfoy had stolen it from Professor Boughbranch.
Madam Pomfrey glared sharply at Harry as the doors closed. She
He’d noticed that recently. He and Malfoy had always traded insults like chocolate frog cards, but now—it felt performative, as if they were skirting around something unspoken.
“Let me down, you
By the time Harry realized what was happening, it was too late. His vision clouded over, and he felt the dreaded sensation of someone scouring his head, as if rifling through the pages of a book.
, like in doing so he would somehow be exposed.
—insult him or taunt him to follow Transfigurations earlier that day—but it never came.
The second eyebrow joined the first. Then Malfoy’s brow smoothed. Cool amusement glinted his eyes. “Realize what?”
"I only regret harming the mistress," it croaked, though its mouth never moved. "Lesser men wend to far moe wondrous lengths to forbear what they fear than to obtain what they desire."
I hated you. I would have watched you squirm like a bloody slug.”
are dead. You're worse than scum, Malfoy. You're a coward."
Ron considered Harry with clouded blue eyes. Then he glanced after Ginny. "I hope you know what you're doing," he said at last.
At the top of Gryffindor Tower, the Fat Lady was giggling with her toothless old wizard friend. She batted her eyes at him, fanning herself with a ridiculous hat.
"Mother," came Malfoy’s voice.
She shot Harry a ca
, Potter," repeated Malfoy. "That's what I was trying to say, if you'd listened."
It was unlike Malfoy to waste the opportunity to torture Harry. But Malfoy only worked beside him, occasionally both disparaging and correcting Harry’s potion-making. Harry had long since stopped resisting the help. He wasn't an idiot. Why should he complain if Malfoy was getting him out of Remedial Potions faster?
They turned a corner.
, Potter," remarked Malfoy, leaning over the desk. "Are muggle schools really so substandard that you never learned to write properly?"
Harry wrenched his wrist away. He was suddenly very angry, though he could not explain why.
“Nothing,” said Malfoy quickly. Something flickered behind those grey eyes.
Malfoy's expression froze. He glared at Harry, unflinching.
Awkwardly, Harry stood there. The kneazle started grooming itself.
Malfoy sneered in disbelief. "What would a dolt like you need Occlumency for?"
Irritation swelled up in Harry once again. “How many times have you wished Ron or Hermione dead? How many times have you made fun of my parents for dying?”
Harry turned over the memo and read,
Harry wasn’t stupid. He knew what Malfoy was asking of him, and why: Malfoy had no friends, a castle full of people who would be glad to see him gone, and a probation to match. Ron and Hermione would call it Harry’s needing-to-save-people thing. They might have been right. But it didn't change the fact that Harry had the thing.
“It’s ridiculous,” she said in a tone that implied, quite clearly, that the subject deserved no further consideration. Hermione returned to her Arithmancy textbook (she wasn’t as susceptible to Christmas-fueled apathy as the rest of them).
He tried to
He removed an apple from his bag and rolled it across the floor. The kneazle’s oversized ears twitched. Lion’s tail flicking from side to side, it pawed forward. It sniffed the apple and, hesitantly, licked it. Then it attacked, batting the apple between its paws. The apple rolled—too far, and the kneazle pounced.
A million needles jabbed all over his skin. With horror, Harry realized that
Harry turned and nodded at Draco Malfoy at the back of the classroom.
Malfoy sighed. "Thanks a lot,
Shooting Luna a look, Parvati hurried away. Luna stood up.
"That's

Malfoy’s smile dimmed. He looked away. He ran a hand through his hair, then seemed annoyed how it fell around his face.
behind them. Harry and Hermione took their usual seats along the front of the classroom. Ron, just returning from McGonagall's office, joined them. He looked pleased about something.
Harry rolled his eyes, unimpressed.
,” said Malfoy, “are you talking about?”
"Don't smoke or do, I don't care," responded Malfoy indifferently. "Just don't be prat for once in your life, and keep it to yourself."
Harry pulled a face. Ron laughed, earning him another nasty look from Hermione.
Blinking away tears, Harry tried again. This time, he breathed in, quickly removed his mouth, and breathed out. Smoke fluttered from his lips like a sigh, leaving behind a faint burn of candied cinnamon.
Suddenly, Harry felt on edge, half-expecting Malfoy to call Hermione a Mudblood or something similarly offensive.
"That wasn't Remedial Potions," said Harry defensively. "That was—" He stopped.
"He says he fell," said Ron. His tone gave away exactly what he thought of that answer.
Then, abruptly, he stood and shoved his homework into his bag. He crept up to the eighth-year dormitory.
He walked past Harry to his mother's bed and sat at her side. Gently, he lifted Narcissa's head and propped her up on the headboard, adjusting her many pillows. When she smiled at him, Harry could see why he'd initially thought her dead.
Malfoy scoffed. He seemed irritated. “Of course you don’t.”
She hesitated. "It's just—you need someone, Harry. To help you through all of this. To help you...forget."
Hesitantly, Harry raised the fruit to his lips and took a bite—and gagged. It was like that time he’d chewed one of Aunt Petunia’s antacids before he learned how to swallow pills. Meanwhile, Luna smiled encouragingly.
Feeling like an idiot, Harry placed his hands on the table. Parvati clasped them between her own, wheatish and smooth.
He set his goblet down, shifting awkwardly.
Hunger rumbled through Harry's stomach. Rooting through his bag, he excavated an apple and bit into it, relishing its
“Did you nick that from Potions too?” he asked.
Harry’s hand twitched on his throat.
He grabbed a bottle of chestnut extract and left the closet, ignoring the sensation of a bird taking flight in his chest.
"You’re not worth it, Malfoy," he grunted. He grabbed his schoolbag, turned heel, and stalked out of the dungeons.
“Sure,” said Harry. A pit had formed in his stomach. “That makes sense.”
The corner of Malfoy's mouth twitched. Fire burst from the end of his wand.
*In this story, 7th years have classes alongside 8th years, since both years are taking the same N.E.W.T. coursework.
“Can you shut
“Potter—”
“But you told me—”
"Over here, Harry," called Ginny, laughing. Sunlight kissed her freckled face, pink from the early November chill. Her long hair rippled, fiery, as she tossed it over her shoulder.
"Does it matter?" said Ron. "He pissed off so many Death Eaters, one of them finally decided to off him. What difference does it make which one did it?"
Gryffindor had the pitch for practice. Ginny looked particularly fierce, shouting orders and whizzing around on her broom like an angry phoenix. The first match of the season against Slytherin was approaching.
"You asked. Anyway, Pince—she didn't catch us, but she seemed suspicious, and you know Hermione, couldn't act normal to save her life—anyway, she reckons we can't go back now. Not for a while, anyway."
“Oh, of course not,” continued Hermione. Her eyes glinted playfully. “Ginny’s with that Gryffindor Keeper now.”
The next morning, Harry’s face, windburned, glared back at him from the bathroom mirror. He touched his cheek tentatively and winced.
“I’m an eighth year, not a
," he said.
Harry watched Parvati disappear over the hill, her long black ponytail swinging behind her.
“Are you staying or not, Potter?”
No, Ron and Hermione definitely wouldn’t approve of this.
Harry snatched up the remote and turned up the volume.
Invisible, Harry sucked in his stomach as Malfoy stalked past. He felt as though someone had just kneed him in the ribs.
“We can’t,” said Harry, strangled.
"Say," he said, hesitating, "what would you do if—I don't know, Millicent Bulstrode, or someone—tried to chat you up? As a joke, of course."
"I want you to stop the endless abuse, Malfoy. You can't call Hermione a Mudblood. You can't aggravate Ron, or talk about his mum, or Fred."
“How’s your month been, Malfoy?” he said. “The Slytherins treating you alright?”
Malfoy’s breath quickened, hot on Harry’s neck. A curious shock, lighting-fast, shot down his spine.
From the armchair above them, there came a gasp.
Soon, the library emptied and grew quiet; it was dinnertime, after all. Ron and Hermione would be wondering where Harry had gone, but the thought of facing them now was unbearable.
“Suit yourself,” shrugged Malfoy.
a pretty scene. Tell me, do you get off on making girls cry?"
a surprise,” said Hermione, trying to not sound too impressed. She glanced again at the gash on Harry’s cheek and wheedled, “
Harry likewise collected his ingredients and left the closet. While powdering his beetles, the suspicion he'd had when seeing Malfoy in the pet shop began to grow.
The door swung open. Red-cheeked with pleasure, Hagrid beamed down at them.
It didn’t make sense. Harry hadn’t seen Malfoy the entire day: he hadn’t shown up for meals or classes. So, why would he show now? But Harry had a lurking feeling he might. After all, Thursday was a dueling night.
“Yeah.”
With a great clattering, the fire ants all over Harry exploded, transfiguring into showers of peppermint humbugs. The countless candies bounced, scattered, and rolled across the stone floor.
Harry looked down at the kneazle. It stared back unblinkingly. Then, with the utmost caution, it sat atop Harry's boots, much like Crookshanks had moments before.
Something about Malfoy’s words felt strangely personal. Harry wasn’t sure what to say. Malfoy examined his fingers.
But he hadn't. He'd hidden it, tucked it away like a dirty secret. Even now, it burned a hole in his bag.
“Wrackspurts, Harry!”
Aunt Petunia pushed her way into the screen.
And Malfoy had been purposefully unnerving Harry, with his studied silence and covert glances.
Malfoy was frowning. He looked like he did when he was puzzling over a particularly challenging essay. “You ask if the Man ever had a chance. A chance for what? Change? Redemption? We would assume that if he had choices, then perhaps he had a chance. But what were his options?”
After classes that day, Harry found himself, as usual, in the library. Without Quidditch, the near-constant barrage of schoolwork and impending N.E.W.T. doom had turned the eighth years (Harry, Ron, and Hermione included) somewhat into recluses. Not that he would ever admit it, but Harry welcomed the distraction. And except for Potions, his marks seemed grateful for it.
“Sorry mate, I’m beat,” said Harry. He climbed the stairs, and when he was out of sight, he bolted to the toilets, slamming the door.
Something glistened on his lashes. Harry looked away.
"Ooh, I'm not doing so well in Charms," said Parvati, looking sick.
why you wanted it back so badly.
Ginny, Dean, and Seamus all stared at him.
“I tell you a lot of things.”
"You a virgin or something, Potter?"
“Come on, you’re being naïve,” said Ron.
"You're acting like you never did anything wrong,” he said. “You were worse than a bully, Malfoy. And—however you felt afterward—you joined Voldemort. You knew what he was, what he could do. I'm not perfect, but I never did
“Guess you’d have to be better than me at
Harry avoided looking at him. “Not my problem,” he replied, sweeping the cloak over himself.
“Don’t pretend you don’t know Ginny’s name,” said Harry, “and Malfoy—I think Boughbranch is onto you.”
"Don’t tell me that you, of all people, are worried about something being illegal," Malfoy scoffed. "Dangerous beasts are a level below breaking into the Ministry. And Gringotts. And probably everything else you've done."
ridiculous, but it’s right about one thing. No one’s seen her. She’s…” Harry licked his lips again. “…in the country, right? ”
Obediently, Narcissa opened her mouth. Malfoy spooned in the porridge.
bathroom, Harry. Anyway, good luck."
He hurried up the staircase. Taking care to step quietly, he passed noblemen snoozing and knights night-capping until he reached the top of Gryffindor Tower. At the entrance to the common room, he stripped off his cloak and stowed it away.
it was that the boy who supposedly defeated the Dark Lord couldn’t brew a simple potion.

From his left heel spread an itching, burning, prickling sensation that began to worm rapidly through him. First his left leg, then his right, his torso, his arms, fingers,
Suddenly, the voice stopped. Quiet.
Malfoy scowled, resentful. "Of
, because I like them. And I can’t hex McLaggen with a potion.”
Malfoy’s eyes widened slightly. He averted his gaze.
Harry’s gut twisted. He mussed his hair, feeling the need to do something with his hands.
And the footsteps receded down the corridor.
“I mean, did they have so many kids that each one came out more dim-witted than the one before? Those twins were the start of it, I'm sure. Didn’t even graduate, did they?”
“We’ll see,” said Malfoy offhandedly. He placed his book aside, stood up, and brushed himself off.
Softly, Malfoy said, “If I’m the coward, Potter, then how can I…do this?”
He pressed his ribs, then let out a choked gasp.
"You heard us, didn't you? In the pet shop. Me and Ginny."
A loud sound tore from Harry’s mouth. He crumbled; his insides turned to silk, rippling with pleasure.
“Wait,” panted Harry.
Malfoy smirked. The peppermint bounced in his cheek. “Roman did say ‘no rules,’ didn’t he?”
person that he wanted to see it. Remembering, Harry’s face flushed, whether in anger or something else he couldn’t say.
“Because,” said Malfoy, “you should have left me in that fucking fire.”
“Yeah, here,” said Harry awkwardly. “At Hogwarts. Defense.”
Then, without worry that he would come across Filch, he brushed past Harry out of the classroom.
The portrait swung open. The crowd inside the common room had thinned, but the eighth years remained, surrounded by playing cards, carpet burns, and empty bottles of Firewhisky.
Harry had caught on. “Well…” he said slowly. “Is he still a sinner then?”
Malfoy appraised him. After a pause, he said, "Who knows. Something that won't make my dear father curse me from his grave. Or, seeing as he's already rotting…"
But Malfoy seemed undaunted. Even as they sat at the desks and pulled out their books, his smile lingered.
“Why's that?” asked Harry.
“Get off,” Harry said irritably, shoving him away. The cloak slid off the two, and Harry picked it up.
they were charged in the first place...and what must have changed."
Hermione’s face was pink, and her gaze combed him relentlessly.
, actually, when I’m trying to get into my own common room,” scowled Ginny.
Victorious, hot blood pumping through his veins, Harry soared downwards. His heart felt lighter than it had in weeks. Together, the two of them descended onto the hill overlooking the lake.
"Far left…" he muttered. With difficulty, because his fingers felt like dangling egg noodles, he turned the tap.
She smiled and turned away.
Ron sighed long-sufferingly. He pulled the assignment from his bag. The two got to work.
“Fine,” said Harry firmly. “I will. No one’s seen your mother since your dad’s funeral, Malfoy. That was what—nearly three months ago? Three months your mother’s been missing. Now, considering what I saw in your head,
Malfoy's smile waned. His tone turned serious. "Stay out of it, Potter. It's none of your business.”
Harry's hand shot up to his face: so he was. When he drew his fingers back, they were red and slippery.
Ash from the magazine Harry had burned out of Malfoy’s hand. Ash on Malfoy’s fingertips. Fingertips on his face, drawing him closer...
"Oh, by the way, Harry," said Hermione as if she had just realized something, “why isn’t Ginny with you?"
"I suppose it'll be like an exam," reasoned Hermione. "I mean, she'll want to make sure we're performing well in our courses so we're on track for N.E.W.T.s, won't she?"
know what the case could be—” he continued, undeterred by Malfoy’s sharp look, “—but it doesn’t explain why
"Yes, yes, all fine."
Harry’s stomach clenched again.
Harry wondered what would happen once his flimsy lies stopped working. The situation felt tenuous; at any moment, it could all come crashing down.
"Why don't you ask one of your Slytherin friends?” said Harry. “There's got to be one desperate enough to help you."
Malfoy.”
From the mirror, his reflection stared back like a stranger.
Harry searched her face. Luna sincerely seemed as if she hadn't a clue what Harry was talking about.
Hermione stared, warm eyes round and cheeks flushed. “I’m sorry, Harry, I didn’t mean to read it!” she gasped. “I just opened your book—to check the ingredients for Wolfsbane Potion, I haven’t got mine with me—and this fell out.”
Harry never got to finish his thought, because then Malfoy punched him squarely in the face.
“It’s just sex, Potter,” Malfoy breathed. He skimmed a hand down Harry’s side, leaving an electric trail in its wake. “It means nothing.”
Unsteady, Malfoy’s pulse beat against his own.
Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid squinted at the bottom of the page. Squeezed next to an advertisement for Sleekeazy's Hair Potion, there was a column merely a finger's length that read:
just some twisted joke, right? At my expense?”
"You could've told me about this," said Harry, scowling. "In Prunella's, at least."
each other. Meaning, you shutting up about Hermione and Ron and Ginny. Which," Harry conceded, "you've done alright with so far. We don't need to be friends. In fact, I don't want to."
Taken aback, Harry hesitated. Then he said, "But…they were cleared, weren't they? I mean, not for the other stuff, of course. But they didn't murder your father."
"Falling."
“No, I’m telling you—”
“You can shove your tongue down my throat, Potter, but you can’t use my real name?”
As if he’d read his mind, Malfoy soared upward towards Harry.
“Honestly,” continued Malfoy conversationally, “I’m surprised this was the first time I’ve had to heal myself—I expected you to be more vicious, Potter. It’s disappointing.”
“What’s to say?” she said, incredulous. “
“And by an accident too,” tsked Malfoy, “killed by Vincent Crabbe, the bloated idiot. Couldn’t even see his own prick.”
Suddenly, the bell rang. It signaled the end of lunch, but in that moment, it seemed like an ill omen.
"Not her then," said Harry, thinking, "maybe Parkinson. Or Daphne Greengrass."
Breathing unsteadily, Harry advanced. Malfoy stared; his face could have been carved from stone.
"My Dudders, on the other hand," he continued proudly. "Bound to wrestle one day. Built like an ox, he is."
"Harry,
Harry scowled. “And what do
Boughbranch sighed. “I’m afraid not, my boy. D again, and my office at nine tonight.”
“You’re on probation. And the only wand the Ministry’s tracking is your mother’s—not this one.
"You said it yourself, Ron, at the trial over the summer. Lucius Malfoy deserved to
“It means something to me,” managed Harry.
"Wrackspurts," replied Luna seriously. "We've got an infestation at Hogwarts. I’m afraid the situation is quite grave."
She swept away to Pince’s desk. Harry turned back to his homework. His answers were gibberish.
"I'm well of age," he protested, “and it’s past noon.”
Harry
“About this. What’s been bothering me.”
"But—Neville?" said Harry. "You two are always together...and in the common room, after Hogsmeade, we saw you tying berries around his ankles. What was that?"
Harry had liked Ginny. And when he’d kissed her, he’d felt that monster in his stomach purr, as though finally satisfied. But with Malfoy, the monster in Harry was never satisfied—it was insatiable. He tried not to think about what that meant.
“Bravery doesn’t come that easily to the rest of us,” said Malfoy. “As much as we’d like to believe that we’re brave, or good—that we’re like the characters in the books we read, or the type of wizards who win Orders of Merlin—it’s just not true. Most people don’t work that way. At the end of the day, only one thing matters.”
"Forget it," he said. “Ungrateful brute. I feed and water her, and some thanks I get."
Malfoy looked up. “I know what you think about me.
. There,” spat Malfoy. His cheeks had taken on a faint pink tinge.
“Interesting,” said Hermione, chewing and staring. “So, how’s your Potion’s grade, Harry?”
But Malfoy said nothing. His grin faded, and he turned back to his potion.
, he thought:
Hermione squinted at Harry. Then she shrugged and delved back into his Potions book. Ron contemplated Harry for a moment. Then he handed the note to him and resumed his listless gazing at his Potions essay.
Malfoy considered him for a long moment. "No," he said finally.
“Get—”
Although Harry himself could have benefitted from some last-minute review, he couldn't help his mind from drifting back to that tiny purple sachet. He had told himself to simply ignore it, and he
He peered over the top of the desk—and ducked to avoid yet another spell.
When he arrived, he was met with an unpleasant sight: Draco Malfoy sulked from his desk. Dismay filled Harry. But Malfoy didn’t look the least bit surprised.
Malfoy’s jaw tightened. Harry watched the muscle flex; a tongue reached out, wet pink lips.
"No," said Harry. "I
It had stopped bleeding, but it still stung when Harry scowled.
. I see far too many gingers in real life already."
"I wasn't torturing you or threatening to kill you. I was just...doing research."
Still contemplating the strangeness of that whole interaction, he climbed four flights of stairs to the library. But when he arrived, he saw that Ron and Hermione were, yet again, nowhere to be found.
Malfoy followed suit, eyes glinting.
"This goes on for...
Groaning, Harry dropped his head back onto his pillow and stared at the ceiling. Just moments before, he could've sworn it had been a ceiling like any other, but now he saw that it was a mirror.
But it seemed that the moment was over.
"That was…" he gestured vaguely at himself. "Dark magic, wasn't it? And earlier too, in Defense. When you blinded me, I could feel it. No way you could’ve beat me otherwise.”
You don't need to be here."
wand is your mother’s.”
He’d heard something.
When he reached it, he secured the parcel and the letter to a barn owl’s leg. The owl stared at Harry disdainfully, as if asking if it was really meant to deliver the parcel inside of the castle.
Hermione glanced up from
"Wait, how did you know the—"
There was a curious fragility to that moment; it hung in the air. Harry bit his lip. He couldn’t explain it, but he felt compelled to say something.
said Harry, growing annoyed.
But the Baron continued to stare at him, the sockets where its irises should have been terribly white and empty.
Fixedly, Harry stared at the damp stone floor.
"I, for one, think it's admirable that you two aren't constantly at each other's throats anymore," said Hermione.
“I’ve got a meeting with Professor McGonagall,” Harry told them.
Eleven o’clock struck, and Harry was in Classroom No. 10.
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed. Harry averted his gaze to his feet; Malfoy stared at the opposite wall.
“In the country?” Malfoy scoffed lightly. “If you want to ask me a question, ask me properly, Potter.”
“Aw, Potter, you worried for me? That’s endearing,” said Malfoy. “Anyway, one look at Roman and you’d know that man doesn’t owe anything to the Ministry. Besides, he’s...an acquaintance.”
Anxiety clawed Harry’s stomach. He felt unsteady on his feet.
," Ginny grasped him by the end of his sleeve. "Let's go."
“You should be thanking Fred,” spat Harry. “The Weasleys, too. If it weren’t for them, and everyone else who saved Hogwarts, you’d be rotting in the dirt with your dear father.”
Then Malfoy muttered, “Say something shitty, Potter, like you always do.”
The name felt foreign on his tongue, like a strange spell.
“Good,” she said, “glad to see Malfoy here is having a positive influence on you, Potter.”

Parvati gave him a look of ultimate condescension. “Why else? Whoever killed Lucius Malfoy...is coming for
Luna was planting large seeds into the holes they had made.
Oddly hot, Harry climbed the stairs. He turned the corner from the Entrance Hall—and met a familiar face.
“I mean,” Ginny continued, her voice softening, “It’s not like our future is set in stone. We’re young. We don’t know what’ll happen.”
Harry lifted his head and slid up over Ginny's flushed body, small and burning. Sweetly, he kissed her open lips.
"Oh...yes, we were paired for our Divination project," said Luna dreamily. "She said I'm the first girl she ever liked, and that she didn't really like all those other boys. I don't think that's quite true, though."
said Harry, bewildered.
“Thanks for the intel, Potter,” he said. “It’s touching, really—shows you care. But I’m not concerned.”
The old wizard whispered something in the Fat Lady's ear, sending her into peals of laughter.
“Don’t push your luck, Malfoy,” he said roughly.
Harry scoffed, not without humor. "And how do you figure that one, Malfoy?"
"It was Harry’s snakes, really, that got everyone's attention," said Hermione, smiling.
“Malfoy—you don’t have to sacrifice yourself, you know,” he said. “You don’t have to die for strangers. You can still be a good person without that. And you can be brave—just by doing what’s right. That’s enough.”
"Yeh haven' heard?"
Horror clenched Harry’s stomach in a vice-like grip. Contrary to his will, against every desire screaming in his body to deny, to just
"Really? I seem to recall an incident fifth year…"
, Maggie," another hissed, turning scarlet when Harry stared at her.
"We'll see what comes of it," said Hermione. There was a look of satisfaction on her face.
“We all say things we don’t mean,” retorted Malfoy. “Like when you said you never thought about me.”
"So, Polyjuice Potion," said Harry, tapping his quill thoughtfully. Malfoy eyed it in irritation. Harry stopped. "It uses lacewings and leeches, but Wolfsbane only uses leeches?"
Potions right now if it weren't for me."
Remedial Potions took place again on Wednesday night. Although Malfoy was in Harry's other N.E.W.T. classes, Harry rarely paid much attention to him. Malfoy was usually content to sit at the back of the classroom, sullen and superior.
Panic striking him, Harry skidded aside. It was just in time—the horn drove into the wall beside his head. The smile slid from Harry’s face.
"What's
"You’re sure? Because if you need—"
Harry had just finished stuffing his books back into his bag when he heard Malfoy say, from the front of the classroom, “Thanks, Professor. You know, I’m just

—no apple had ever crunched so crunchily, he thought, its sweet-tart juice dribbling down his chin.
“Well, it’s a kneazle, isn’t it? That’s what they do. Detect suspicious or—” Harry’s gaze dropped to Malfoy’s mouth, pressed into a tight line, and bent forward—“unsavoury characters.”
Face hot, Harry cleared his throat and said, “What’s to say?”
“Like you would. Let’s hear it, then.”
“Right,” said Harry, feeling stupid.
Shock jolted his system. He lifted a searing hand to stare at their angry red bodies.

Harry pulled the book out of his bag and took a minute to find the right page. It read:
“It’s just that,” said Harry firmly, “I’ve been thinking about, potentially—if it’s possible—teaching?”
Breathing hard, Harry put out the fire before it spread to the wooden desks and chairs. Then he popped Malfoy, who, for the third time that evening, collapsed heavily onto the floor.
Malfoy stood in the corridor. His tie was loose, his eyes were wild, his hair, his
“What do you care?” said Harry.
Opening the door quietly was a precise, but successful operation. Cautiously, Harry peered into the hallway. There was no sign of the Dursleys—only a faint electronic humming.
"Anyway, Harry," he said, dark eyes twinkling. "I'm sure yeh got enough on yer mind as is."
It took all of Harry’s will to simply say softly, “As did you.”
to add the dittany on high flame and
“Like he wants to eat him,” said Neville, grimacing.
Hermione shot Ron a significant look. Harry ignored them.
Slipping his hand into his pocket, Harry clutched his wand. Then he followed.
Yet you stand here with the nerve to laugh—at that
“Is that so?” said Malfoy.
"No," Malfoy said. His lips quirked slightly. "You don't think before you act."
, thought Harry quickly. The fibers closest to him began to glow orange. They spread across the web, catching like lighter fluid.
“Luna—thanks,” said Harry, forcing a smile. “You know—for the plum.”
Naturally, worry spread like spattergroit.
"That's not—you're
what you want, isn’t it?”
Harry slapped his hand over his throat. It glowed like lit coals. He didn’t know what he looked like, but judging by the shock on Ginny’s face, it couldn’t be good.
"It's a she?" asked Harry curiously.
"Mm...I don't think so," replied Ginny, distracted. "Here we are.
Mrs. Norris stared at them malevolently. Then she turned tail and vanished out of sight.
“Er—” said Harry. “Here.”
Experimentally, Harry placed his lips to the pipe and inhaled.
What was it that Malfoy had said?
And at once, Harry was thirsty. He drank deeply from his mug of pumpkin juice, warm and spiced like a caress.
“When exactly,” asked Harry quietly, “did you first realize it?”
When Harry dared a glance at Ron, he saw that he’d stopped scribbling. Slowly twirling his quill, Ron frowned at Harry’s essay.
decided to do—
in his ears.
It was too irritating to dwell on for long; it nauseated him.
Malfoy’s hand rested on Harry’s hip. His fingers toyed with the hem of Harry’s shirt, then slipped underneath it.
“Yes, well,” said Malfoy, shrugging. “Life’s disappointing.”
He refused to look up, to meet Malfoy’s  quicksilver gaze. There was a long pause.
“It’s okay. Harry, you have the right to privacy. It’s just that—if you’re keeping this person a secret, then there must be a big reason. And that’s not a good sign.”
Meanwhile, the common room was deep in conversation and conspiracy theories.
"We're planting Dirigible Plums in Hagrid’s garden," said Luna happily. "Hagrid said we could as long as they didn’t touch his giant pumpkins."
Ron grunted noncommittally: Neville, grinning, had just beheaded his queen.
he thought, and Malfoy crashed to the ground.
Harry shrugged. “I never found that very important.”
“What?”
in Azkaban. But by acting as an informant, he got away with just ten years. If his murderer isn’t a Death Eater—who else would want him dead?”
But despite Harry's trepidation, the morning really was rather pleasant. The sun embraced them through the chill; strangely, it had yet to snow. It was the first Hogsmeade trip of the year, after all, and nothing—Ginny's plot, memories of Death Eaters and Aberforth and Ariana—could quell the cheer in the air.
She peered at Harry. “You are still, I take it, interested in Aurorship?”
Harry ignored this. “Well, you’re not hopeless, Malfoy,” he said critically. “A little slow with your retaliations maybe, and you get flustered easily.”
“Fuck it,” he said, rubbing his tired eyes. “It’s pointless. I’ve got...I think a whole foot left.”
McGonagall set the parchments down and joined him. Placing on spectacles, she pulled the nearest parchment from the top. She scanned it briefly before setting it down.
Roman had been insistent. It was clear that he didn’t want Malfoy chucked into Azkaban for something that Harry, Hermione, and Ron had done themselves at least a few times.
“I don’t think you deserve worse,” said Harry bluntly. “You’re suffering enough right now.”
Ginny rolled her eyes. Wordlessly, she pulled Harry into a hug.
Ginny turned to him. Her face was impassive. "Then why aren't we together?"
“Spare me your guilt, Potter,” said Malfoy. His voice was carefully flat.
Inside, Malfoy was crouched low to the ground, as if he were looking for something there.
When Harry, Hermione, and Ron climbed through the portrait hole, they were met with a peculiar sight. The room was largely empty, as was to be expected on a Hogsmeade night, save for a huddle of first and second years and two familiar people: Neville and Luna. Luna was sitting at Neville's feet, and she appeared to be tying what looked like wreaths of fresh cranberries around his ankles.
Malfoy, to his credit, looked cowed.
“No. Well—Father must have suspected. But he’d never say.”
Harry stared at a particularly confusing question. The words were beginning to blur together.
In the dungeons where they’d gotten high, and Harry had rolled Malfoy’s sleeve back; in the dungeons when they’d dueled, when they’d
"Okay. It's a kneazle," said Harry.
Once again, Boughbranch had written instructions on the blackboard. She sat at her desk, glancing at Harry over her reading spectacles.
Shock flooded Harry. Grey eyes, liquid, were just inches from his own.
“You’re just proving my point,” said Malfoy. He didn’t smile, but Harry heard suppressed amusement in his voice.
Harry stared at her. Suddenly, a laugh leapt from him, short and unexpected. “Never mind, Luna,” he said, grinning, “...never mind.”
"What do you mean, Hagrid?" he managed.
a book, Ron. A thing people read?” Hermione’s eyes still hadn’t left Harry’s. “Granted, it’s a muggle book.”
Then Malfoy would open his mouth and ruin everything.
“That’s a bit of a risk, isn’t it?” said Harry, eyes narrowing. “You’re still on probation.”
“Doesn’t mean it didn’t hurt.”
As of late, Classroom No. 10 had come to serve as their informal study hall. It was a mutually beneficial arrangement. Harry got to avoid Ron’s questions, Hermione’s insinuations, and strangers’ incessant stares. And Malfoy had someone to insult a few hours a week. It probably should have struck Harry as strange, but it was no stranger than what they were doing already. In any case, he didn’t see the point of thinking about it too much. It seemed to work for now (as long as “Remedial Potions” served as an excuse, anyway).
It didn't matter, thought Harry, fingering the parchment. She wouldn’t be able to figure it out. Harry barely believed it himself.

“Well, yeah,” said Harry. “Now it is.”
, he wouldn’t allow himself to think, because then—
Harry was bemused—it felt as if Professor Boughbranch were blaming
“I think I’ll go to bed now, Harry,” said Hermione, yawning. She glanced across the room at Ron, who had earlier been studying Herbology with Neville and was now passed out on the desk, snoring intermittently. “Honestly,” she sighed, but there was only tenderness on her face as she went to wake him.
But Malfoy simply whispered, “It’s finally snowing.”
But then he tilted his head to the side and asked, “...Well?"
"...Draco, dear?"
He started tugging Malfoy into that classroom,
Then Malfoy asked, voice soft, "Why couldn’t you get it up with Weasley, Potter?”
The envelope was of uncommonly fine stationery, ebony and sealed with a dark blue wax peacock. It contained no name—only the words '
It had helped, but it hadn't solved everything.
Harry jumped in shock. A cracker had erupted from beneath his seat.
Malfoy was apparently a fast learner. He'd nearly bested Harry back in Roman's classroom earlier that day. In fact, if he'd struck when Harry was blinded, he might have won outright.
The fading bruise revealed ropy scars, long and thin, as if someone had taken a cruel knife to Malfoy’s abdomen.
Harry watched his retreating back. Annoyance crept up on him. He realized that Malfoy didn't believe Harry would ever tell McGonagall—and, Harry admitted, he was probably right. It wasn't really his business, after all.
“Er—sorry, Potter,” said the boy, whose shock morphed into snide amusement.
Then it clicked. Harry understood.
"Hey Harry,” she said, cocking her head to one side. “What're you doing here?"
"That's amazing, Ron!" gushed Hermione.
"Can't possibly see why," said Harry dryly.
"Come on, Ron, I'm not a tyrant," said Hermione peevishly.
to be in Azkaban?”
"Oops," said Harry. He pulled out a tuft of dry grass from the ground and shredded it between his fingers.
Harry processed this. “Right,
Malfoy cocked his head at Harry. “Yes, I did,” he said flatly. “You knew everything you were doing, and so did I. Now we live with that.”
Mournfully, Ron poked his sausages.

She studied him. "Firewhisky?"
Behind him, there came the sound of fast-approaching footsteps.
A familiar combination of mirth and scorn painted his pale face as Harry appeared in the doorway.
Ron laughed. "Come off it, Hermione. An Auror?"

“Oscar Wilde,” said Malfoy. He wore a most unusual expression on his face.
“Please begin, Potter,” said Boughbranch.
"So…" Harry said conversationally, tapping his quill again. This time, Malfoy took no notice. "You really don't know what you want to do?"
"Of course I do," Harry said at once.
"Yes, I know."
mouth.
“You heard Boughbranch. I’m not coming back here,” said Malfoy, “and your half-wit arse needs all the help it can get.”
"Lacewing flies bind the properties of two identities," replied Malfoy. Preoccupied, his face bent too close to the parchment again, reminding Harry of Hermione. "Naturally, it would be disastrous in a Wolfsbane Potion."
“My father says Lucius Malfoy was killed by Fudge’s clone, the one in Azkaban,” said Luna.
“In case you’ve forgotten, Potter, you’re invisible,” drawled Malfoy. “I’m talking to a wall.”
Stunned by his own words, Harry stopped. Yet there was nothing he had said that rang false.
So, he had to do something.
proclaimed, in flashing purple letters:
muggles, Potter," said Malfoy matter-of-factly. "As a species, sure. They're stupid and small-minded. But maybe the one percent of individuals are an exception. Rare ones, mind you."
As they packed up, Harry heard her mutter under her breath, "Where's my
“—Nimeria, please,” a man was saying. “Consider, for a moment, the consequences of such an action. You’d be sentencing him to a life in—”
His tone was light, but Harry got the impression Malfoy wasn't as nonchalant as he appeared.
Harry peered at Malfoy suspiciously. It was strange to see a lack of scorn on his furrowed face; there was only naked curiosity there.
Ginny wrapped her legs around his waist; she tangled her fingers through his hair.
The feeling that something was afoot accompanied Harry through the corridors to his classes. In Charms, Anthony Goldstein winked at Harry, then chortled with his friends; a seventh-year girl Harry had never spoken to before asked him, blushing like a tomato, what kind of chocolate he'd like best for Christmas; and a beaming Professor Sprout gave Gryffindor five points when Harry told her good morning.
"Not bad," said Ron airily. "She just talks about your future career plans, N.E.W.T.s, all that."
“I’m starving,” said Ron.
It had been years since Harry had read the book. Pulling it out, he skipped forward and read:
, for Merlin's sake. And you turned out fine. No—you're
Not that that ever stopped him before.
” said Malfoy, smirking. “It’s unfathomable that someone could be so incompetent, after all.”
“Well…only until I got my Hogwarts letter,” replied Harry self-consciously. “Then I got Dudley’s—my cousin’s—second bedroom.”
Confused, Harry said, "We've just had classes all day."
“Personally, I think Roman’s involved,” Seamus was saying. Next to him, the girl he had been flirting with nodded gravely. “Have you
But it wasn't any normal mirror. Although Harry was looking at his normal eighteen-year-old self, he appeared to be back in his cupboard at Privet Drive. And then he realized why he couldn't get up: eighteen-year-old Harry was much too big for this cupboard.
Panic rose in his throat like bile. He tore away, his heart hammering madly.
, Potter?"
Malfoy fixed Harry with his gaze. “That I’m a coward. According to you, anyway.”
Malfoy's eyes flared. Warily, he watched Harry.
, Harry, won’t you let me heal that for you?"
Hermione’s eyes had widened to dinner plates. Sure enough, under the purple headline, Harry read, “
That night, Harry had wanted nothing more than to cleanse himself of Malfoy, to sever any ties between them. Returning the wand was a symbol. He and Malfoy were done.
Realizing what he’d said, Harry flushed. He felt as though he had just given too much of himself away.
Hermione looked sceptical. "You're not suggesting…?"
“Yeah.”
Indeed, the kneazle was inching towards Harry, its black ears pressed flat against its head. Suddenly, a loud
. I can’t even—
Ron glanced over. At once, Harry crumpled up the parchment and stowed it away in his robes.
, Mrs. Headmistress, Peevsie's been a
Thoughts of blackmail made Harry feel sick. It was only fear making him think this way, fear that Malfoy would use last night against him—
Quietly, Malfoy said, "People…see what they want to see. But books don't notice you at all."
The classroom was tumultuous again as students brushed off, pulled each other to their feet, and returned to their desks. Harry settled into his chair and opened his bag.
Then he frowned at the kneazle, who had curled up in the corner, apple tucked under her chin.
Harry bade them good night. He watched them retreat up the dormitory stairs and out of sight.
2/26/21:
At last, he said lamely, “I don’t think really you’re a coward, Malfoy, not anymore.” Malfoy raised a sceptical eyebrow, and Harry amended, “Well. You could’ve made better choices. You could have cared about something beyond yourself.”
“Per se?”
So, Harry said, “And lying to Bellatrix Lestrange was just that? Self-preservation?”
“What are you, my mother?” muttered Malfoy. He cracked his neck.
Malfoy drawled, leisurely flicking through the pages. “‘Most Charming Smile Award.’ Impressive, Potter. That should go on your chocolate frog card.”
“I knew you needed it
Ginny bit her lip. She watched Harry, who pretended to find a freckle on her nose very fascinating.
"It's the

Wordlessly, Malfoy obeyed, and Harry realized that every other kiss in his life had been wrong.
“Er—okay,” said Harry.
“Perhaps?”
and read the headline emblazoned on the front page:
Harry glanced pointedly at the book cast to Malfoy’s side. It looked ancient; stains marred its cover, and moths had eaten away at its spine so thoroughly that cotton threads poked out at all angles.
Harry groaned into Malfoy’s shoulder. Exasperated, he straightened, then squinted: Malfoy’s brow was pinched in thought.
“Uh, what-what-what?” Ron swiveled to face her.
“Is it for Roman’s class today?” said Harry. “Wait, I’ve got mine with me…”
Taking a chance, he raised his wand and called, "
convincing in his excuse.
After a couple of minutes of internal wrestling, he finally said, "Out with it, then."
"What then?" Harry spat. "Just thought it'd be fun to pop in and go for a stroll?"
Harry heard the
"It’s not enough,” Harry said. “Realizing you're shit doesn't make you less shit. You have to
Finally, Malfoy said softly, “No.”
Malfoy smelled like smoke and peppermint.
The milk in Harry’s cereal shot up his nose. When he finally emerged, spluttering violently, he saw Hermione’s contemptuous look.
Harry pushed up his sleeve and stared at his skin, blank as clean slate except for a smattering of dark hair. The welts had disappeared. Maybe he'd only imagined them.
“You’re boring, Potter,” said Malfoy tonelessly.
Harry froze. He had nothing to fear; he was invisible—
Malfoy glared. "So? What are
Malfoy rested his head on his hand. His gaze held Harry’s, quiet, deliberate. Then he turned back to his textbook as if nothing had happened.
"Digestive secretions," said Ernie promptly. "You know, you'll want to pay more attention."
Harry wasn’t angry; he felt as if he might cry.
“Can’t be,” gasped Hermione.
Wary, Harry pretended to read his textbook. A beat. Then:
Because some part of you
“Know what?” asked Luna, tilting her blonde head.
With a start, Harry realized that was how he’d felt all those nights in Classroom No. 10, in silent study beside Draco Malfoy.
"He's—a—po-et," said Malfoy slowly, enunciating each syllable. "They're a kind of a writer, Potter, only they write little chopped-up sentences."
one, not even a milkman or a relative has heard
Not for the first time, Harry wondered if it was worth it.
Unsatisfied, Malfoy’s eyes narrowed. When Harry reached for the snitch, Malfoy grasped him by the wrist.
The charm on Malfoy could wear off any second. This morning in Defense had shown that. Harry would be at his mercy.
“It’s
Harry buried his face, shot with heat, deeper into his arms.
“Ten points to Ravenclaw,” Harry muttered, glowing red. He yanked the tapestry shut.
Hermione, who continued to stare at him, recited breathily, “
Malfoy glowered at her. "The old coffin-dodger won't leave me alone," he muttered.
He found them pushed against the back corner of an overstuffed Three Broomsticks.
Malfoy was staring back at him. It was too far to see his expression—but Harry swore he
She smiled serenely at him through the screen. Her hair was braided down one side and decorated with tiny plums.
Harry sank into Uncle Vernon's favorite armchair. It was a hideous thing, beige with orange paisley print, and it sunk deeply, presumably from years of torture under Uncle Vernon's considerable backside.
, Potter, Malfoy,” came Roman’s voice.
He returned to the dormitory, undressed, and crawled underneath his covers. His face was still sore, and all he wanted was sleep.
Harry didn't know which part exactly set him off, but the way Malfoy had been treating him, as if their relationship was
Finally, quietly, Malfoy said, “My mother…is not what you would call a brave woman. I suppose neither was my father. So, I guess it makes sense.”
Harry used the distraction to unfold his letter. It consisted of only one line. In elegant, swooping script, it read:
“Bloody Squib,” muttered Malfoy. “Suppose it’s safe to go back?”
He looked around the room, smiling. Nobody raised their hand. It seemed silly, Harry thought, that he’d never wondered where Vanished objects went.
“Oh,” was all Harry said.
jealous of the fact that I have actual prospects—"
Snores rumbled under canopied beds. Carefully, Harry opened his trunk. He pulled out his Firebolt and a golden snitch with a large crack splitting the middle. Then, donning his invisibility cloak, he hurried out the room, down the staircase, and through the portrait hole.
Sighing, Harry turned to Malfoy. He waited, raising his eyes to Malfoy's grey ones, which suddenly sparkled.
you, Potter," he scowled, wincing. His fingers were black and scalded. "You've got to stop burning things. It's not exactly creative."
This thought quelled much of Harry’s fear.
"Farewell, nude sirrah," it rasped at last.
Damp, hot breath ghosted along it. Boneless, Harry stared at Malfoy. His blond hair lay in damp strands across his brow, and he panted, mouth so swollen and red-rimmed and
Amazed, Harry scoffed. Malfoy was much keener on slicing Harry’s bag open and passing him notes than whatever Professor Flitwick had to say.
that Harry couldn’t resist his own curiosity.
Malfoy's eyes became steel slits.
And then it was heady, and strong.
“Well, no,” said Harry. “There’s a lot of bad, there, to outweigh the good. But…it’s hope, you know? People change. If I’d known that, maybe Dudley wouldn’t have surprised me. He thanked me for saving his life, you know. Well—his soul. I don’t know. It meant something to me.”
” The desk he had crouched behind hurled itself at Malfoy, who panicked.
At the foot of the large armchair by the fire sat Harry and Ron, staring blearily at their half-finished Potions essays. Classes had been unrelenting, but the warm fire and red wool were cozy, and the two were fast becoming lulled into a stupor.
"Bloody git," cursed Harry, checking his watch. He tore up the stairs to retrieve his bag, then hurried out of the portrait hole before anyone could say anything else to embarrass him.
"All this time," Hermione pressed, "we've been thinking it was an old Death Eater. Someone who resented Lucius Malfoy for informing on them. But what if it was someone at the Ministry? What if it was a guard—an Auror?"
“What does that mean?”
Malfoy shoved his parchment away. “It’s on page forty. You
Malfoy seemed like he knew how ridiculous that sounded. Frustrated, he sighed and smoothed his hair. It didn’t work—it fell like silk across his brow.
Turning back to their essays, they continued like this for some time (Harry wasn’t sure how long). Whether it was the plant itself or the spice-scented smoke drifting through the classroom was uncertain, but everything seemed to have slowed down.
Malfoy passed him his own. "I have two," he said coolly when Harry looked taken aback.
Harry said slowly, “Because, well, that’s not something people usually joke about. Regular people, I mean. Regular blokes.”
A Pepper-Up Potion would work well enough…why am I here with the likes of

That made Harry feel worse.
Ron snorted, itching his nose with his quill. “Give him a break, ‘Mione, you sound like Mum. He’ll tell us soon enough. Won’t you, Harry?”
A loud snore from Seamus startled Harry awake.
"Which boy?" asked Luna, concerned.
McGonagall’s face was inscrutable. “Well, Potter? Thoughts? Burning questions?
Harry couldn’t.
," she said reproachfully.
Malfoy looked disbelieving. He snorted. "Is that all?" he asked. "Merlin, Potter, you really don't know how to bargain."
The screen split, and Harry was startled to see Vernon Dursley's fat purple face appear.
Harry itched to escape. But it was too late now—his body had betrayed him. No way could he run from
“Shut up,” muttered Malfoy.
to make Hogwarts hell for me. And when anything bad happened, you tried to make everyone hate me."
“Save it,” said Malfoy. He glanced up at Harry, whose heart froze. Malfoy’s eyes were wet silver. “Get my bag.”
The class was in disarray. Hermione was breathing heavily, her bushy hair standing upright as if she'd been electrocuted, and Luna had been Stunned, a dreamy expression glazing her face. By the look of him, Seamus had received the brunt of Malfoy's blast of fire.
He couldn’t ever tell Ron and Hermione. He couldn’t tell
Malfoy raised a brow. “It is, actually. No one ever comes in here. The last thing we need is a couple of horny sixth years stumbling in on us.”
"Alrigh', save it," said Hagrid, grinning. "Come by for a cuppa sometime, s'all I ask.”
“I mean, you don’t have to worry about The Quibbler. Everyone knows that they’re complete rubbish. No one
"Right. Shall we do it together?"
, will you?" smirked Malfoy, tilting his head to the side. "Not even Granger or Weasley. Your

Awkward silence settled over them, as it always seemed to in moments like these.
?" whispered Hermione, hushed. "And why now?"
Harry knew he was treading perilous ground, but his humiliation at what Malfoy had seen made him angry and vindictive. Heat crept up behind his ears.
"It's true, Petunia!" declared Vernon, turning even ruddier. "I've always known, even when he was a little grub. That boy's grown up to be a pillow-biter if I've ever seen one.
But the pain faded more slowly. His skin still throbbed where the ants had bit him.
“And you managed to live there for sixteen years without hating them?” said Malfoy, brow arched. “You’re not a saint.”
Shrugging off his robes, he pulled off his shoes, socks, and trousers. He unbuttoned his shirt, took it off, and slid his pants off. Shivering, Harry climbed into the tub. Instantly, it filled with blissfully warm water.

Harry took a steadying breath. Then, leaning in as close as he dared, he hissed, “Malfoy, I’m going to
Hermione’s face was pink, and her gaze combed him relentlessly.
It took extraordinary force of will not glance up at Draco Malfoy, to only shove those words into his bag, to just pretend that he hadn’t seen them. But his pounding heart didn’t listen.
He drew a steadying breath. “So?”
The kneazle paused in front of the locked door. Over its shoulder, it shot Harry a look that was unmistakably plaintive.
Ginny looked at her shoes for a few uncomfortable moments; Harry examined an interesting stain on a bookshelf. Then Ginny broke into a bashful laugh.
“Bastet?” he said.
so convinced that he’s a vampire—”
. Malfoy’s wand clattered across the stones. He crumpled to the floor.
Malfoy quirked a brow. “No? Trouble in Potter’s perfect paradise?”
The owl hooted sagely and flew up to the rafters.
reader.”
“You know,” muttered Harry. Already, a telltale flush crept along the back of his neck.
Harry scoffed.
Harry was soft, boneless as wax. Malfoy watched him. His eyes never left Harry’s unattended, as if Harry would disappear any second.
Malfoy watched Harry. His eyes glittered.
For some reason then, although he was with his two best friends in the entire world, Harry felt curiously alone.
It was like a boulder dropped into his stomach.
“You’ve been gone a while,” called Ron. “Join us for a round.”
It was true that the Ministry had published a highly revised version of events. After much pressing from Kingsley after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry, Hermione, and Ron had finally divulged theirs and Dumbledore’s secret. Kingsley had kept the knowledge of Voldemort’s Horcruxes (and of the three’s countless crimes in destroying them) out of the papers. Inevitably, rumours both true and false abounded. But only those close to them knew the truth.
Harry began. Parchment was flipped, pewter was ground, and fifteen minutes passed.
Harry opened his eyes. The corridor was empty. He was alone.
"It does that from time to time," said Malfoy, unconcerned.
illiterate."
Malfoy’s jaw clenched. “Who said I liked you, Potter? Don’t be naïve. That’s not what this is.”
“Well,” said Harry, scratching his neck, “you would’ve died a shit dueler.”
Malfoy shrugged. Harry wanted to punch the stupid smile off his face.
"With what exactly?" he said mildly.
"Er—right,” said Harry.
"Oh, I'm not suggesting it," said Malfoy, smirking, “but it seems like
“You’re stirring the wrong way,” said Malfoy suddenly.
Like the tinkling of chimes, a high voice said, “I have something for you.”
"Don't I know it," murmured Malfoy.
He wore a small, strange smile. Torchlight danced, luminescent, in his eyes.
me, it’ll hurt less,” said Harry moodily. “You would've thought I was Filch's wig, the way you two hung me out to dry.”
Malfoy was quiet. Awkwardness settled over them.
"PEEVES, STOP IT THIS INSTANT!" thundered McGonagall, hurrying in after him.
Harry felt so much all at once he wanted to cry.
Harry shuddered; some things were best left unexplored.
Harry looked at him blankly.
His heart stopped the moment the envelope was dropped into his lap. At once, he glanced around: Hermione was giggling over
But even when Malfoy wasn’t on Harry, he was on his mind. Current castle gossip was no help. It was that time of year when, despite Professor Splog’s best efforts and Professor Roman’s best threats, Hogwarts became more interested in Christmas plans, mistletoe, and gossip than schoolwork. On the Monday before Christmas Break, copies of
Chairs
But whatever Priscilla Ball had said, Harry never found out. He drew his wand, and the magazine flared red, dissolving into ash.
Harry hesitated. Then he asked, “You didn’t really mean it, did you? When you said I should have left you in that fire?”
Harry rolled sideways and fell from the tiny cot, which screeched indignantly. Grunting, he pushed himself to his knees and crawled over to the closet door.
“Shit,” Harry cursed under his breath. In his endeavor to scrutinize Malfoy’s potion, he’d been inattentive to his own. He was meant to add the dried ancho seeds
"Er—sorry, I have to go now," he told it.
It was the first time he’d said it out loud. Harry winced.
“Harry! I don’t know if you remember me—I’ve been kind of
," he corrected, rather nastily.
"Hey—"
After a moment, he said, “I guess the answer to your question, Potter, is that I read because books are my escape. And my best friends.”
"Yeah," said Harry flatly. He pocketed the card.
Luna giggled. “Harry, you always ask such stupid questions.”
,” said Ginny, scowling. “I’m trying to be all gracious and shit.”
An hour soon passed under gentle torchlight.
Harry was hard. Hard, hot, and liquid. He was spiced pumpkin juice, pooling on the stone floor.
Hermione glanced at him sideways and said, "How about a round of Exploding Snap?"
Ron's blue eyes narrowed. "What
Maybe it was all a sick joke, and that was why Malfoy had looked so shocked.
Harry felt jittery, anxious, hot and full of steam. Yet there was nothing he could do but sit there, his head on the table, his breath humid against the smooth wood.
"What'd Malfoy want?" he asked, frowning down at a winking Dumbledore.
“Doesn’t explain…” Malfoy muttered.
"Get OUT, Potter!
"That's
Defense had been a double period, so the three were done with classes for the day. They'd decided to visit Hagrid. Wrapped in thick winter coats, they hurried across the hill, brown grass crunching under their boots. In the distance, smoke furled from Hagrid’s chimney.
“Your mother.
"Ho, what have we got here?" said Ron, grinning. "Hey, Luna. This is our common room, you know."
“Yes,” said Harry, “Although, perhaps—”
“If you recall,
, won’t it?"
After a moment, Malfoy said, “He—used Legilimency on you? Even back then, at Hogwarts?"
“It wasn’t just that,” Harry said slowly. “I faced him before then, you know…and yeah, I was lucky, and I had lots of help, and I still don’t exactly understand whatever prophecy was made about us—but I fought him, and won,” finished Harry plainly. “More than once.”
Harry frowned. It was nearly halfway through the year, and while he was occasionally still asked to sign a photograph or witch's hat, most students had become used to Harry at Hogwarts. But today, what seemed like an unusually large number of people stared at him across the Great Hall, whispering and giggling.

“...Exactly,” said Harry. “But for all the Ministry’s intents and purposes,
"Good riddance," muttered Harry.
Potter?”
Harry held his breath. This was the moment where Malfoy ratted him out, told Filch that he’d been with none other than Harry Potter.
Ginny ignored her. To Harry she said, “You can’t go in there looking like that—Hermione will go mental. Let me see it.”
Harry was still distracted by Malfoy’s revelation. “No, the last time was before I went into hiding.”
"No,” said Malfoy firmly. “What are you doing
“This whole thing—” Harry burst out, “I don’t want
a book, Ron. A thing people read?” Her eyes still hadn’t left Harry’s. “Granted, it’s a muggle book.”
Malfoy cast him a sideways glance. “Always the prude, Potter.”
At last, Malfoy pulled him close.
Harry watched Hermione leave, but his mind was elsewhere. Malfoy’s absence should have been a relief, but it just made Harry think, and remember…
Malfoy's lack of remorse just irritated Harry further.
Not knowing what else to say, he blurted, “Last I heard, y
"Well, that would excuse it," said Malfoy, "if it weren't for the fact that Neruda was a muggle."
He was too close.
Malfoy cursed, spitting a shocking string of expletives. His wand pointed at Harry threateningly, he tugged at his ankle with his other hand—and his sleeve fell to reveal a startling tattoo of a skull with a serpent tongue. It was the Dark Mark.
On the television, the local news was playing. Harry started—Luna was the newscaster.

“Harry, who—?” Hermione paused. “Emily Brontë,
it, in my head. Don’t have much to lose, do I?”
"What is it now?" asked Hermione.
"Nope," replied Harry. He'd slept in and missed breakfast that morning, only to be shaken awake by Ron minutes before they'd left for Hogsmeade.
Ginny raised an eyebrow. "Okay. Well, try that faucet—on the far left," she said, pointing.
"You didn't read it?" said Ron, frowning. "That explains how you missed this—"
“Fantastic game, Potter,” drawled Malfoy. “Really exhilarating. You know, I’ve been meaning to ask you something. Those Muggles you lived with…how awful were they, for you to prefer Weasley’s hovel?”
Malfoy closed the door.
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed. As if launched from a crossbow, the horn shot from his mouth.
"You're not going to learn anything by glaring at him," said Hermione in a low voice.
moment—in the middle of a full classroom—to do so.
Left a bit discomfited by the abrupt interaction, Harry walked out and checked his watch. He decided it was about time to meet up with Ron and Hermione.
," said Malfoy in a clipped voice. "I don't think I'll need to explain what's happened here."
boy," he giggled as Hufflepuffs scattered in every direction.
Wanting nothing more than to Vanish the note (and yet itching to read it), Harry unfolded the parchment. In handwriting he was getting to know far too well, it said:
"Who d'you reckon did it then?" asked Harry as Madam Rosmerta set their drinks in front of them.
?" demanded Harry.
Inside, the eighth years were in their usual state of disarray: Neville was in the middle of a heated argument with Dean, Seamus was chatting up a poor sixth year girl, and Parvati was, as usual, talking someone’s ear off. Harry found Hermione curled up on the windowsill, reading a newspaper. A look of concentration was etched onto her face. Below her, Ron shuffled a deck of cards.
Blue sparks spit into Malfoy’s hair. He shook them off. His sleek hair fell easily back into place. Then he dropped his scowl.
Pink and porky, Harry’s first impression of Splog at the start of term was of a much kinder, much older Dudley Dursley. Not for the first time, Harry wondered why a man so well-accomplished in Transfiguration did not spell away his corpulence. His only conclusion was that Splog liked being that way.
And yet, in other ways, nothing had changed—Malfoy was still as uncreative as ever. There was some comfort in that, mused Harry.
Flushed and dizzy, Harry rolled over and buried his face into a cool pillow. He grinned.
"What, I'm going to brew some sludge to score my goals for me?” said Ginny, wrinkling her nose.
Harry paused. He realized he was holding his breath.
It was nearing five o'clock. Hermione had left for her evening Arithmancy class. Ron snored softly atop his textbooks.
“I know you worship muggles and your broomstick. And shag your ginger girlfriend Gilly while picturing Granger and the Weasel every night.”
thought Harry, grinning. Immediately, as if by an invisible string, Malfoy was flipped upside down and hoisted in the air by his ankle.
A particularly cheerful bubbled settled on his chest.
But Harry wasn't so sure. Professor Roman, gaunt, pale, and still smiling widely, seemed too bloodthirsty to be wholly human.
He had always attributed his failures at Potions to Snape. Without him, Harry thought that his bad luck was over. But now, when Harry closed his eyes, he saw his future Aurorship soaring away on the back of a hook-nosed bat.
“Well, I do,” said Harry.
Harry watched Ginny’s ponytail whip around her, envy coiling in his stomach.
His face buried in Ginny's hair, Harry realized her flowery scent had always been just shampoo.
the man scoffed. His voice sounded very familiar. “Is
Harry missed Quidditch indescribably—the wind in his hair, the tedium of drills and never-ending practices, the thrill of closing his fingers around a cold hard snitch.
Harry waited ninety minutes until they had completed their potions. At half-past ten, with instructions to tidy up, Boughbranch finally retreated into her office.
Harry shrugged.
At once, fire filled his lungs—he tore his mouth away, coughing. His eyes watered.
Harry grinned. “Getting existential, are you?”
She swept away, and Malfoy shot Harry the foulest look he'd ever received in his entire life, including the time Malfoy had tried to
Perhaps that was why Harry answered truthfully, “Dunno—or I do, I guess. My aunt knew my mum was a witch and hated her for it. Not sure if she was jealous or what, but the Dursleys all hated that I was her son…that I was, you know...strange.”
think about them?” Ginny asked.
“Yeah,” said Harry.
Harry put down the quill and examined his work. Disgusted, he tore it in two and tossed it aside. Once more, he picked up his quill and scribbled:
, a broken rib means you're in tip-top shape.
Stomach swirling, he climbed the long, twisted staircase. He was so lost in his thoughts that he forgot to jump the trick step—his leg fell through—but he clutched the railing just in time. Two second-year girls skipped up the staircase. Shrieking with giggles, they pointed at Harry and hopped easily over the step. Panting, Harry hoisted himself up.
The gargoyle on the left stirred to life. “
Have you seen me do well at anything, besides Quidditch and Defense?"
Malfoy said nothing. He fingered the book’s brittle pages.
Almost imperceptibly, Malfoy's wrist flicked.
From behind Harry came a loud, girlish giggle. Alarmed, he spun around and was greeted by a gaggle of young girls.
“I don’t hate Muggles because I think they’re filthy," said Malfoy. "I hate them because they’d blow us all up in our beds if they had the chance. Their primitive minds couldn’t handle us living alongside them.”
Cackling victoriously, Peeves swooped away, hollering at the top of his lungs. Shrouded in his cloak, Harry saw Malfoy posed to run, but there was no place to go: Filch’s wheezing already sounded from the dungeon walls.
she suspects me. No one would ever suspect The Chosen One of anything."
“Yes, yes, come in, come in,” said Professor Splog genially. He winked at Ron and patted his gelatinous stomach.
Trepidation tightening his stomach, Harry unfolded the parchment. In Draco Malfoy’s fluid handwriting, it read:
And then there was the fact that Malfoy clearly wasn’t a girl. Harry’s body forgot about that too. No—it enjoyed it.
“Seeing your father’s murder all over the papers must be hard,” reasoned Neville. “So, hearing people talk about it all the time must be even worse.”
Finally, he asked, craning his neck to peer at Malfoy’s parchment, “What d’you write for number seven?”
Instead, Ginny looked confused.
He stared at his potion. Pink froth bubbled, sputtered in the long silence.
It was difficult to put a finger on his thoughts; they skipped and danced, tripped and collided, until they were impossible to distinguish from each other.
“That’s not it,” he said. “I just don’t buy it. You know, when it comes down to it, it’s easier than you’d think…to give your life.”
“You don’t seem too bothered,” noted Malfoy.
Harry jumped. In the darkness, he had thought he was quite alone. Now, as the flames rose and circled above their heads, he saw Malfoy’s face just a metre from his own.
”Right,” was all Harry said.
People are
Harry stepped away. “Thanks,” he muttered.
Harry sat in Gryffindor commons that night, twirling his quill and staring apathetically at his Transfiguration homework:
Harry made a face. “Thanks,” he muttered.
Finally, the dungeon door creaked open: Malfoy sauntered in. He spared Boughbranch a careless apology, then retrieved his ingredients from the storeroom and began chopping.
"Yes, let's go out in ten-degree weather," Ron said furiously, rubbing his arms and pulling the hood of his robes over his head. “It'll be
“I’m not perfect, Potter,” said Malfoy dangerously. “But at least I don’t lie to myself.”
It felt
"Can just copy off you."
“I wanted to guess,” came Ron’s muffled voice.
hell," gritted out Harry, clutching the right side of his face. It throbbed like he'd fallen twenty feet from his broom onto it.
Looking preoccupied, Malfoy glanced up.
Icy wind whipped through Harry’s hair. Joy filled him like Firewhisky; he had to resist the urge to whoop loudly. It had been months since he’d been on a broom; he’d had no reason to without Quidditch. But now everything felt right once again.
“And what’s that?”
“Mm,” said Hermione. She sliced a piece of chicken and chewed it slowly. Her gaze was piercing.
"...You...alright?" he managed. He checked her expression, expecting pain or perhaps, although less likely, to see her in the throes of ecstasy.
After dinner, they retreated to Gryffindor Tower. It was very hard to focus on homework (even as it piled up in front of them) when snow fell from the black sky, fire crackled, and the carefree laughter of younger students rippled across the common room.
Malfoy snorted, but his face told Harry there was nothing he found funny.
But Malfoy simply said, with mild disgust, "I'm much better looking."
Harry frowned.
Malfoy rolled his eyes to the ceiling. "And what, may I ask, does Lord Potter want now?"
Malfoy smirked, though it was much less effective in his current state. He leaned in. His wet, warm mouth engulfed Harry’s earlobe, and Harry hissed, sparks shooting through him. The heat low in his stomach flared.
“Er—what do you think you’re doing?” Harry hissed under his breath.
But as it had with the ceiling above his bed, the moment that Harry focused on her she transformed. Narcissa’s hair fell into greying straw; her eyes dulled; her face turned gaunt.
having to study outside. But
“Are you arriving at a point, or do you need me to help you get there?”
“Yeah,” chuckled Harry.
Malfoy pressed flush and warm against Harry’s side. Harry swallowed a grunt as a hard elbow jabbed his stomach.
“You don’t see people as they are,” said Malloy.
Carefully, Harry stood up. It seemed that Malfoy had pushed him, and he'd hit his head on the wall cabinet before falling.
Looking disappointed, the gargoyles split aside. Harry stepped into the empty space between them and was spun upwards in a golden spiral into the office.
A sudden lump lodged in Harry’s throat: Malfoy looked dangerous.
said Ginny with increasing alarm.
Potions, Harry, for the hundredth time."
Harry shrugged. "If you're busy…"
Relief swept over Harry. Malfoy looked at him with faint amusement.
“Oh right, I’ll just tug that out in half a second and throw that over us,” snapped Harry.
So, at half-past seven, Harry found himself in empty Classroom No. 10. It was a dusty old room, tucked away in the coldest corner of the dungeons. Not even Snape had held his class here; as damp and freezing as the rest of the dungeons were, this classroom also seemed to have invisible fractures running along its walls, letting in every ice-cold gale of wind that whipped across the Black Lake.
Exhaling, Malfoy ran his hand through his hair. Then he shouldered his bag and crossed the room to the door.
With the start of December came the castle’s Christmas cheer. Hagrid lugged gigantic trees, magically magnified, through the corridors; Professor Flitwick carried piles of wreaths and baubles so tall he was often mistaken for a small tree himself; and even Professor McGonagall was spotted humming carols while shooting wads of gum into Peeves's throat, silencing his cackling.
Ron squinted at her with vague suspicion before laying back down on the carpet with his Charms book over his face.
“Give me a break. I don’t pity you,” said Harry.
name. I suppose when you breed like rodents you run out of ideas. It’s a wonder one of the Weasleys wasn’t put down to save them a few knuts—”
Nearly all the bubbles in the bath had dissipated, and the water had gone cold. Briefly, he wondered what was the point of a magical tub if that could happen.
Parvati shook her head, waved goodbye at Harry, and strolled away towards the castle.
Straightening his tie, he left the bathroom for class. He had come back late last night and, resolving to complete his Transfiguration homework in the morning, had gone to bed. But as those things usually go, Harry had overslept—and class was in ten minutes.
"Well, didn't you get a letter? They must have sent you one."
Inside Harry, a dam broke: the words poured out like water.
“What?”
“Poor you and your dead mum and your dead dad,” mocked Malfoy. “Dead parents can’t die. Our parents made their choices.”
be having it with
“Professor Vector cancelled it. Something about Christmas coming soon.”
," said Harry quickly.
"Don't," he said shortly.
“It’s not rubbish just because you don’t know how to do it,” said Harry before he could stop himself.
“I did you a favour,” said Harry, frowning.
Malfoy decided to attend class the next day. He didn't spare Harry a glance, as if nothing unusual had happened. From Malfoy's perspective, Harry supposed, nothing had; he'd simply meant to mess with Harry's head and then had forgotten all about it.
? Not to mention I know your handwriting from being forced to brew potions next to you."
Harry squeezed himself out of the doorway and got to his feet. Carefully, aware of his every footstep, he crept to the living room. Familiar beige carpet scratched his bare feet.
?” Malfoy continued harshly. “You know the state of my family, Potter. You
“Is that—
As she flounced away, Ron sniggered to a tomato-faced Hermione, “Merlin, you don’t pull any punches. And what on Earth’s a Sickle Back, by the way…”
Malfoy peered at Harry. His gaze had softened, and he seemed...almost astonished. Then, after a moment, he looked away.
"Where do
Harry’s watch read five minutes to midnight. He didn’t have time to consider if this was wise. He hastened down Gryffindor tower, crept out of the castle, and climbed up the hill overlooking the Black Lake.
Harry skimmed down the article:
Malfoy scowled. He said nothing.
Harry didn’t eat at breakfast the next morning. He’d rehearsed it in his mind: what he’d do when Malfoy showed up, or if Malfoy tried to stop him in the hallway or speak to him in class. But Malfoy was nowhere to be seen.
He looked up at Malfoy, who tossed him his wand back. Harry caught it in midair.
"What did you do?" Harry whispered, grinning.
Ginny snapped her fingers in front of his eyes. The spinning stopped.
Malfoy gave a long-suffering sigh.
Harry couldn’t argue with that: his teeth had started chattering. Mumbling a spell, he conjured an orb of fire much like Hermione’s at the lake, but his flickered erratically, occasionally sputtering. Shadows played on the stone walls as the orb rose above their heads. The classroom was suffused with warmth.
“What’s happened?” yawned Ron. “And why are you looking at Harry like he’s told you he thinks McGonagall’s fit?”
“You saved a page from a book, didn’t you?” said Harry. “
“Likely story,” snarled Filch. “We’ll just see what the Headmistress has to say—”
The Fat Lady started awake. She clutched her ample chest. “Dear boy! It’s nearly midnight! I was rather expecting someone else...”
Malfoy’s face tightened, rigid with anger. In the dim light of the dungeons, it looked like it was carved from the shadows.
Malfoy sighed. Blond lashes drifted shut. But when he opened his eyes again, they had turned bright.
A delicate warmth was bubbling in Harry’s chest. Without meaning to, he smiled.
A small frown crossed Malfoy’s face. “I often wonder whether you’re as stupid as you seem, Potter. Somehow, I’m continually disappointed.”
he doing here, in a freezing dungeon classroom with Draco Malfoy, when he could be drinking smuggled Firewhisky and playing Wizard's Chess next to a crackling fire?
Luna stood in front of him. She drew her hand from her satchel and placed something on the table.
Harry let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. Next to him, Malfoy did the same.
said Malfoy lazily.
Comments are being moderated to filter out flaming or homophobic content. It may take a few days for your comments to appear, but I appreciate every single one. They make my day brighter, so thank you, really. :)
Harry shrugged and went to place his vial on Boughbranch's desk.
“It is,” said Ron. He grabbed the paper.
“I may be old, but I’m not stupid!” called the Fat Lady, though she could not see Harry. “Students frolicking about, canoodling at all hours—no decency, no
to be late."
“Right,” said Harry.
It disturbed Harry to see Malfoy so flippant about his father's death, even if his father had been a heinous Death Eater. Harry thought of Mrs. Weasley, of her warm brown eyes, and of her apron, which always smelled like cinnamon. He thought about Sirius's laugh, Ron's smirk, and Hermione's anxious brow.
—was a momentary blip. Out of all the things Malfoy had done, it was quite tame, Harry told himself. It was like that interspecies relationship he'd learned about in science class before he ever knew anything about magic, or wizardry, or Voldemort: maybe Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy were in a sort of symbiosis—temporarily, at least.
"Tha' Professor Roman…" he muttered. "Dunno what the Headmistress's thinkin', hirin' him. Must be gettin' desperate for someone to take the job…"
"Hi," she said. "This was—
Malfoy’s smile faded. He stared at Harry.
He realized he was still holding Malfoy’s wrist. Malfoy felt warm and solid in his grasp. His gaze, ever mercurial, burned into Harry’s own.
“Bully for you.”
Behind Harry, Ginny shot them a faintly amused look, then swept away.
“Fine,” said Harry, turning back to his parchment. “Forget it.”
“I didn’t mean—”
Soon their potions were completed and given Boughbranch's nod of approval (Harry's a rather reluctant one). Malfoy strode from the classroom, wasting no time in escaping Boughbranch's discerning looks. Harry finished cleaning and left a few minutes later.
“Shut
"How’s the eye, Potter?" said Malfoy, pale face in a slight smirk. The cauldron’s flames had tinted his cheeks pink. Silvery hair fell across one brow, clung to his damp, wet skin.
Harry shrugged. He picked at the laces on his boots.
Curiosity piqued, Harry picked up the paper and read:
Not to mention—it was silly and superstitious to rely on the reaction of some strange beast. There were certainly enough existing reasons to be distrustful of Malfoy, and a flighty kneazle wasn't one of them.
The golden snitch, which had just given him such gratification, now felt cold and dead in his hand.
His pulse skipped, unsteady. Heat flushed his cheeks.
Malfoy’s grey eyes widened. “What?”
“Not for long,” the toothless wizard said loftily, and the portrait swung open.
With a gold filigree spoon, Malfoy spooned porridge from her bedside tray.
"Whatever Malfoy, you’re a nympho,” said Harry tonelessly.
Harry’s head snapped up. “Boyfriend?”
Perhaps not then, but an hour later when Malfoy turned in his quiz, Harry noticed a typewritten parchment drift to the floor from his open bag. Malfoy strolled from the classroom. The parchment was left unnoticed.
"Er—Firewhisky for me," said Ron sheepishly.
"I never knew you were so concerned for my future," said Malfoy. "Well, Potter, the last thing I am is jealous of
But Narcissa continued to stare at Harry with her horrible dead eyes.
Harry willed his heart back to his chest. The initial alarm he’d felt had faded—there was no chance she knew who the note was from—but he felt uncomfortable, as if she were seeing him naked. He itched to grab the parchment from her hands.
As hard as he could, Harry threw the snitch into the air. He watched the sky open and swallow it.
Luna’s eyes narrowed. She said in a prickly voice, “I’m not stupid, you know. I can tell when you’re being sarcastic. Give it a read, Hermione, maybe you’ll learn something.”
Harry frowned. “I remember you saying something about not caring what people thought about you…”
The eerie quiet of the immense, sparkling white bath; the ghost's eyeless sockets fixed upon him—it was more than Harry could bear. He was dreaming, he told himself firmly. After all, the Bloody Baron never gave anyone the time of day, preferring to skulk in shadowy, far-flung corridors and occasionally threaten Peeves.
“Because I believe it,” said Harry simply.
doing
He kissed Draco Malfoy.
"Let's just...stop, alright?" he said wearily. "Forget it."
As time wore on, Harry sensed Malfoy growing restless. Harry’s mind, too, started to drift...but then he snapped it back into place. No way in
Harry was at a loss for words. That was happening quite a lot these days—this time, at least, he thought was justified.
Harry didn't know how long Malfoy stood there with that stupid look on his face, and he didn't care. Aggravation quickening his stride, he marched up to Gryffindor Tower.
Ron scowled. Hermione glared.
And then Harry could hold it in no longer. The sight of Malfoy just
of Pince’s bell, and wanting to run and hide and rip his hair out every time he remembered Malfoy’s scent, Malfoy’s warmth, Malfoy’s lips...
Then, ears burning, body tingling, Harry whispered “...yes.”
“Muggles,” scoffed Malfoy. He looked disbelieving.
“Honestly, Potter, can’t you read? Three stirs, alternating clockwise and counter.”
Swiftly, warm fingers pressed parchment into his hand. Sharply, Harry looked up.
The image of Narcissa Malfoy, staring at nothing, flashed in Harry’s mind. It rendered him silent.
Forget it.”
Malfoy shrugged. “She is, to a point. But at the end of the day, we all only care about ourselves, don’t we?”
would know if Lucius actually died or not.”
Harry conveyed his thoughts in a single look.
"Well, you won't even tell anyone about
Hermione quickly put a stop to it after that.
She conjured two flesh-colored strips that resembled bandages. Harry held his breath as Boughbranch poured a drop of Malfoy's lilac-hued potion over one strip, and Harry's slightly muddier potion over the other. A moment passed. Then, like grass, dark hairs sprouted from each of them.
Slowly, his anger turned to shame. Harry glared at the desk. A few painfully silent moments passed.
"It's not that," said Ron, grinning. "Look at Tiny Leo."
“Seriously?” he said. His voice was tight.
But Malfoy just cleaned in stony silence, and when class ended, he strode away with only a parting venomous glare.
His heart pounded. Slowly, he took out the envelope and slit it open. The parchment inside read:
The idea was so ridiculous that Harry laughed.
"Hello, Ron," beamed Luna. "Hello, Harry and Hermione."
“A question, Mr. Malfoy?”
“What makes you think I care what people say about me anymore?” he said bitterly.
But during Remedial Potions, there was no avoiding him. Luckily, this evening Boughbranch had decided to tutor Harry more closely. As a result, besides the occasional sneer, Malfoy kept to himself.
Then, suddenly:
"They're purebloods, Potter. Anyway, she's always been a silly cunt."
He couldn't for the life of him see the angle Malfoy was playing, and that unnerved Harry further—his stomach felt clenched in unease. It didn't help that Harry couldn't ask Ron and Hermione for advice like he always did. It was as if he was hiding a secret he never asked for, one that he wasn't keen to divulge, for a reason he wasn't yet sure of.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. "Apt observation, Potter."
Harry shook his head, sure he must have misheard her. But then a door opened: inside lay a dazzling, high-vaulted chamber of pristine white marble.
Malfoy’s past work at the Ministry, who the fuck cares… ‘
Exasperated, Harry left the library. As he turned the corridor, he saw a flash of orange dart around the corner—Crookshanks.
Harry laughed. Malfoy’s eyes widened; he looked pleased. The pain marring his brow had faded. Emboldened, Harry continued.
"I think you'd better stop.” Malfoy sounded amused. He reached over and plucked the pipe from Harry's hand.
. Pain flaring, he hissed sharply—but then Malfoy’s body was on his own and there was no room to speak, no room to breathe—there was only damp forest and sharp mint and warm lips.
, Potter,” hissed Malfoy. The dueling flush had left his face; he looked cold and pale.
"That's it? You're not planning on telling half of Hogwarts?"
Harry’s heart might have stopped then, but he barely noticed. Malfoy’s eyes were silver stars; his scent, like rich wood, washed over Harry.
“Quiet,” called Boughbranch as Hermione opened her mouth. “Bring up your vials.”
bird is the question—a kinky one, no doubt.”
He flushed deeply, understanding what Malfoy had seen; he could scarcely think from the embarrassment.
“Er,” said Harry, “would you stop staring at me?”
Malfoy entered the classroom. Carelessly, he dropped his schoolbag onto the floor and headed for the storeroom without a backward glance at Harry. Boughbranch followed him with her eyes the whole way.
“No? Ask your dear auntie and uncle. They lock you in a closet for ten years because they liked that you were a wizard?”
It was only a matter of time before Malfoy brought up what he’d seen. Harry prepared himself for the embarrassment. Defiant, he lifted his chin, glared into Malfoy’s grey eyes, and waited.
"Well, I'm doing alright, aren’t I? On track to Aurorship even with Potions, thanks to you, 'Mione. McGonagall reckons I just need to work on Transfiguration and Charms, pull more than Acceptables, and I'll be set."
"Can we get over this part?" she asked, smiling. "It's embarrassing."
A silvery figure drifted in from the opposite wall.
Heat prickled behind Harry’s eyes. Horrified, he blinked furiously, but it was too late: wetness gathered on his lashes. He turned away, scrubbing his face.
The three stamped snow from their boots and squeezed into the hut’s warmth. Inside, a welcome fire was sputtering merrily. Fang lay at the hearth, his deep snores rattling the wooden walls.
Harry looked up from the kneazle-cat hybrid he'd been teasing with a toy. Ginny remained fixed on the box of treats. The cat took the opportunity to swipe the toy from Harry's hand.
Hermione looks at him with kindly expressed doubt.
Harry helps him out, thankfully, and when the room is lit, Draco can see that his Dark Mark is as faint as always. He stares at it helplessly. He’s too scared to touch it.
“Yes. We’re listening,” Molly says encouragingly after a moment of silence.
“Don’t,” Harry says on maybe the seventh or eighth night. He gently releases the flask from Draco’s grip and sets it on the bedside table. “You’re going to get addicted.”
Bringing Draco dinner is something Harry does often. He started doing it after the first time he spent the night at Draco’s place. In the morning, he went to the fridge only to realise it was almost empty.
“All right,” Draco says. “I’ll stay, if you have nothing against it.”
Draco feels lonely. He feels so lonely in his empty flat, and in his empty office, and in the Library of the Dark Arts that is usually almost empty, too.
“What do you mean?” he asks with his eyes still closed. He can’t bring himself to open them and look at Harry.
“So, Draco.” Angelique clasps her hands and puts them on her knee. Draco can’t help but compare her hands to Harry’s hands. Hers are slimmer. She’s wearing two rings on her left hand. The brown skin of her palms doesn’t look scarred. “You requested an appointment.”
Harry soon leaves for dinner with the Weasleys. He looks almost apologetic as he kisses Draco goodbye.
“He took you to the hospital wing,” Harry states instead.
Draco’s head fumes at the thought of all the unspoken accusations. “Why am I acting how?”
He remembers the times when he could get anything he wanted just by showing his left arm to the not-so-innocent sellers. Now the mark on his skin provides him with no power.
“Draco, can I come closer?”
Draco has a complicated relationship with his job at the Ministry of Magic. It’s well-paid, sometimes not completely boring, and he’s well aware he’s incredibly lucky to have gotten it in the first place. On the other hand, it makes him feel claustrophobic, to work surrounded by all those people he’s known since school or even longer, all those people who know exactly what he was up to during the war.
Granger gives him a surprised look. “I never thought that you’d grow up to be pompous.”
Draco doesn’t answer at first, instead he looks back at Harry, and for a moment they eye each other in silence.
Harry probably decides to not argue with him. Instead, he pushes a loose strand of hair from Draco’s forehead. “Can I say that you’re pretty? Is it okay?”
When no one answers her, she adds, “Come on, it’s a historical moment. Plus, Harry never uses the camera we gave him for his birthday, so I think we should take the matter into our hands.”
“I just thought you’d stay your old annoying self.”
Harry leans forward a little more. “I don’t know how it used to look before, but there’s no sign of black ink. I see nothing abnormal, no skin irritation. It just looks like a scar.” He looks up. “Does it still hurt?”
“I’ll forgive you if you suck me off,” he proposes.
“I’ll ask you some questions, Draco, all right? I want you to know that I’m not doubting you–I just want you to think, to look closer at some aspects of your life.”
“Was it because I was your enemy? But you never really wanted anyone dead.”
“Oh, actually, there’s this song… I want you to listen to it.”
Draco rolls his eyes. “No one said anything to me. I apologised, and they accepted my apology. I’m afraid the conflict between you and me has nothing to do with them.”
“I’ll write to you,” he says, looking away from Harry.
Draco sighs. “Let me try one more time.”
“Nothing’s wrong. I’m just tired.”
Weasley isn’t even out of the room when Harry enters Draco’s office.
“No. Of course not.”
“Idiot. Absolute idiot. But I’m an idiot, too.”
He turns around, crosses the room and leaves.
“I know.”
“Do you both always talk like that, or is it only because I’m around?” Granger asks when Harry disappears into the kitchen.
“Don’t be dramatic. I was hiding it, you know. That was the point.”
“All right.”
Harry doesn’t move. He doesn’t turn over. He just says, “What do you want me to do?”, quietly and clearly, as if pronouncing a spell in an almost-empty library. As if thinking that it would solve anything.
“But why?”
“I can’t believe things have been so bad for so long, and I never saw anything,” he says.
“I’m all right,” Draco assures him.
“I do use it,” Harry responds.
Harry excuses himself and leaves. Draco’s now in the room with two people and the truth he needs to face.
“Your house.” Draco exhales deeply. “It doesn’t disgust me.”
“To me, it does.”
Harry gets up and comes up to Draco, slowly, as if not wanting to scare him. He puts his hand in Draco’s hair and strokes his scalp. “You don’t even see it,” he says as if he’s just realised it.
“No.”
“Just like my every session.” He shrugs.
Harry stops stroking his chest. He also raises his head and looks at Draco. “Will you go with me to Mrs Weasley?”
“In the meantime, I can be like one of those enchanted mirrors that tell people that they’re the most beautiful. What do you think?” Harry’s smile is mischievous. He wraps his arms around Draco’s middle and pulls him in tightly.
“You have a lot to learn about me, then.”
“With a spell? I’m a wizard, Harry.” Draco elbows him awkwardly. It’s hard to do from this angle.
Draco tries to mask his surprise. “All right, let’s bake a cake.”
“Because it’s always full of your friends.”
“I was… I was horrified. I didn’t know what to do.”
“When I look at myself, it reminds me that I’m his son, and that he’s in prison, and that I hate him, or maybe rather that I feel like I should hate him more than I do. And it reminds me that he’s a broken man, but still, when he leaves Azkaban, he’ll look at me with disgust because I will never have achieved as much as him, whether good or bad.”
“That if you insist on thinking that you’re evil, at least please know that I’m evil, too.”
Draco looks away, but he can see with the corner of his eye that Harry is still glaring at him. “And you don’t have to ask me stupid questions,” he mutters.
Draco follows him.
Draco shares a look with Granger—with Hermione—before they both start laughing.
“I shouldn’t have fallen asleep on the couch.”
“It matters!”
“Oh, what else have I done?” Draco snarls.
“I wasn’t going to tell you that.” Harry’s voice shifts to offence at the unjust accusation.
He closes his eyes. Nothing happens. Everything is quiet.
, but I also didn’t want to hurt them. It didn’t feel great.”
Harry shakes his head and begins to speak, but Draco stops him with a firm gesture of his hand.
He breathes through his nose, trying to calm himself. It will not help if he just starts to panic.
Draco touches the soft material. All right, he was wrong—this robe is definitely more expensive than the ones he owns.
“Draco, it’s not like that. That’s not what I meant. If you’re feeling pain, it’s not fair to say that you’re imagining it. That experience is real.”
Angelique smiles gently. “I’d still like you to put it in a different way.”
Still, Draco hides in bathrooms and uses Vapour Charms on mirrors. He showers with his eyes closed and never changes in front of Harry. His social life is as non-existent as always, despite Ron and Hermione inviting him for afternoon tea and Molly and Arthur inviting him for another dinner.
“I’m at work,” Draco says through clenched teeth.
“Mrs Weasley invited us for dinner,” Harry says.
“I never apologised to you at school. I should have apologised to you then.”
Draco doesn’t dare to look at Harry. Instead, he says, “Every time I look at myself, I think of what happened. Sometimes it leads me to thinking about different things. Like my mission that you so rudely interrupted. You know, as Snape was leading me to the hospital wing, my main concern was Madame Pomfrey discovering my Dark Mark. I think I must have been pretty out of my senses, as I kept insisting he take me to his quarters instead and let me stay there for a few days.”
“I couldn’t—”
Draco slowly manages to push the memory out of his mind. The last thing he sees is his father’s face, gazing at him as they are lying on the floor, twisted in a combination of pain and fear, lacking its usual aristocratic dignity, lacking even anger.
“But still, your father... Your father kept torturing and killing people for years—”
Well, he didn’t get sorted into Gryffindor for a good reason. He’s not brave. He doesn’t know what exactly induces his paranoia—he knows, however, that there’s only one way he can tame this feeling. He does the only thing he knows will feed the doubt and fear he still possesses and presses his fingers to the inside of his forearm, as hard as he can.
“Indeed.”
“Angry?” Harry suggests.
“I don’t want to be rude, but I need some quiet to focus.”
“I’m just here to... Well, my mother would like you to come for dinner on Sunday. Not this one, the next one.”
Draco grunts. He knew that this moment of peace wouldn’t last for long. “Well, if you expect me to go, then—”
They also get told that no one else will come today.
“Oh, you’re not going to tell her to go, Harry, are you? I can come later.”
It’s easier to converse with her than he thought it would be. It’s easy to hold up a conversation between the three of them, actually. Draco’s steaming cup of tea gets empty in no time, with no awkward silence between the sips.
“It has.”
Draco spends little time looking around, trying to not appear judgemental. The interior of the house is—expectedly—the opposite of sophisticated, with everything looking cramped, worn-out and mismatched, but Draco finds himself indifferent towards it. He knows his parents would absolutely hate spending any time in such surroundings. Would they disapprove of his choice to come here?
“We don’t have to talk about it now,” Harry suggests hesitantly. He looks like he’s scared Draco will break at the tiniest sign of anything troublesome.
There were, however, a few times when Draco doubted if the choice he’d made was right.
Draco can’t believe his own ears. “You’re so stupid,” he utters.
They’re sitting on the same couch where this picture was taken. That day, Harry looked unsure and lost. Today, he looks lost and a bit mad. At first, Draco has no idea why Harry could be mad at him, but he quickly gets to know the reason.
The building pressure under his skin is back, and Draco feels the need to talk with Harry.
His father used to be fascinated with the magical properties of dragons. When Draco was young, he used to buy him children books about different varieties of dragons and read them to him before bed. He would point at the fiercest looking one, at the biggest one, at the one exhaling the greatest amount of fire, and say:
“Malfoy,” the voice above him says, the voice that clearly belongs to Ronald Weasley, though Draco still tries not to think about it every time they have to interact.
Well, maybe it never really did.
“It wasn’t just me,” Harry says. His tone of voice is the opposite of defensive.
He also doesn’t object when Harry wants him to lay down on top of him. Positioning himself is a bit awkward, but when he finally rests on top of Harry’s body, he feels his muscles relax in a way they haven’t in a while.
“But I
“Badly.”
He tries to not think about it when he puts food onto his plate, when he picks up a fork and a knife and starts to eat. Harry’s presence next to him is almost burning, exposing, but he tries to distract himself with other things. The food is tasty, so he shares that observation with Molly.
“Yeah. And I saw what it looked like—Voldemort telling you that it was either you torturing Rowle or him torturing you. What a great choice.”
Draco grunts. “It wasn’t a big argument. We made up the next day.” He stops to think. “Actually, there’s this one thing. The day before I had that nightmare, I felt quite strange. I don’t know why. I really don’t know why. I couldn’t look at Harry’s scar, you know, the one…” He touches his forehead, directly above his right brow, and laughs stupidly. He feels his hand trembling as he brings it down. “I mean, I felt both like I couldn’t stop staring at it, and like I never wanted to see it again.”
“I thought we could bake a cake.”
Draco curls into himself slightly. “I was a horrible person, Harry, you know that.”
Harry leans back with a smile.
“Draco…”
“It’s about taking responsibility. You will not carry my burdens; that’s my job.”
Draco nods shortly.
When he falls asleep, his dreams are vivid like fire. He doesn’t remember them in the morning but has a vague sense they were violent.
“Yeah.”
He looks down, not sure if he’s already burning or not but knowing that the flames will engulf him soon enough. He wants to scream for help but no sound comes out—his mouth only releases black puffs of smoke. He’s doomed. Absolutely terrified, he’s trying to take a step forward, but something doesn’t let him move. Something is holding him back, and soon he realises that he’s clinging to a body...
When Draco’s sure that his legs are steady, he starts walking towards the bedroom but stops after a few steps. “Do you mind if I take the bed?”
Draco shakes his head so furiously he gets dizzy. Harry falls quiet. Draco thinks to himself that he’s being dramatic—that’s all. Pathetic. Shouting and almost crying because of a stupid picture.
Harry simply stares at him. Even though he doesn’t do anything—or maybe
Harry is asleep, naked, and Draco is lying next to him, his button-up shirt still on. He can’t stop thinking about how pathetic he looks. His tiny little cock resting between his too-sharp hips, legs losing muscle after years of only ever circling between his flat, the Ministry, and the food market, covered in hair barely visible—Draco is to himself the antithesis of strength and manhood. He is the opposite of everything his father has ever wanted him to be.
“I wasn’t—” he starts. “All right, do whatever you want.”
“Of course we don’t. Sit down. Would you want some tea?”
His train of thoughts breaks when he’s too horny to think, and then he’s too tired, too drowsy to think, and then he falls asleep, sure that in the morning he will no longer remember if he was onto something.
“I know. I know, Draco. You know what made it much, much harder? I wasn’t fully honest with people, not even with Ron and Hermione. I was so embarrassed about it. I was hiding what I was truly feeling whenever I could. It was so hard, and so unnecessary, and I don’t want you to be going through the same thing.”
“Can I tell you something that’s not exactly related?” Harry asks eventually.
“Oh, no. You’re just… You’re not like him. It’s obviously clear that you’re family, but—” Harry stops abruptly. “Why are you asking?”
“You’re closing yourself up. Talk with me, please.”
“I’m not trying to make you apologise to me a hundred times over. I accepted your apology.”
“Technically, you didn’t ask.”
Draco shakes his head, even though Harry can’t see it.
He makes another rip, and another, until his hands shake so much he loses his grip and the shreds fall onto his lap and then the ground.
They’re finishing their toasts when Draco says, “I haven’t looked at myself in a long time.”
Warmth spreads in Draco’s stomach, and he’s ashamed that he has a physical reaction to hearing those words. “It’s all right.”
He remembers hours and hours of answering questions. When did he become a Death Eater? How did he serve Voldemort? Did he use any Unforgivable Curses? How many people did he torture? Who did he keep under the Imperius Curse, when, and for how long?
He and Harry drink coffee in bed. Draco could get used to it. He can easily imagine them establishing some kind of routine here. Or anywhere. He can easily imagine them actually living together.
As Draco’s chest clutches painfully, he realises that maybe thinking about his parents still isn’t the best idea. Thinking about anything doesn’t seem like a good idea because his thoughts always go back to the same dark, disturbing places.
Harry is quiet for a few seconds, before he says, “Tell me that was a joke.”
“Uhm. Yes. Of course. Just... Hermione is here, but I can tell her to go.”
Under the covers, he rolls up the sleeve and touches the raised edges of the scar he knows will never disappear.
Draco feels how his lips purse instinctively before he makes an effort to stop it. “I’m trying to be responsible.”
“You didn’t kill anyone.”
Draco shakes his head. “Harry, it’s not comparable.”
He sees out of the corner of his eye that Harry nods. Then, Harry leaves.
Following that rule, he goes straight to the potions section, still thinking where he should start. Miranda Barkley, poisoned by an unknown substance. He has the files with him that include testimonies, the report from St Mungo’s, and results of the medical tests, so when he’s in the right section, he stops and looks over them again.
“Draco, no. Stop,” he begs, then shuts his eyes close and turns away. “Why are you doing this?”
“Yeah,” Draco mutters.
When he eventually looks up, already much calmer, Harry’s observing him.
“Probably.” Harry cleans up the mess with a wave of his wand. “Do you want me to do it?”
Maybe there’s a John who works in that cafe, and maybe if Draco became a regular there, they could have a friendly chat from time to time. Maybe he would meet a Dorothy—an elderly, ordinary looking lady—in that bookshop, who would passionately talk to him about some Muggle classics.
“I knew how to summon you!” He comes up to Draco and hugs him loosely. “Good morning.”
Harry opens his mouth, as if wanting to say something, but then decides against it.
Harry’s bed is bigger than Draco’s, with a firmer mattress and bed sheets that are fluffy and warm. His bedroom is painted in lighter colours and has a big window, so that even on a cloudy day plenty of light comes in.
After a moment of stilling himself, he’s ready to move on.
Harry laughs bitterly. “That’s your punishment? Almost dying at my hand? Or maybe Voldemort threatening to kill you if you didn’t—”
“My neighbours are old. They have bad hearing.”
He makes his way there from his office at a pace so fast his robes flap behind him furiously with every step. He passes a few people in the hall, mentally assigning them into categories. Unsurprisingly, most of them fit into the third. They don’t don’t pay attention to Draco. Only one person quickly turns around to gaze with fake interest at the door leading to an unused office when they see Draco coming out the corner—they clearly try to avoid him. Overall, it’s a lucky day.
Things seem to be going well.
“You wanted me to tell you what’s wrong. I thought it would be easier to show you.”
“I’m not feeling pain.”
Draco smiles into his plate. “Thanks. I’ll think about it.”
He goes back to bed, leaving the mirror foggy.
The Weasleys keep looking at him patiently.
Draco doesn’t ask Harry. He doesn’t want to know it that badly.
Weasley smiles at him. “Have fun with the testimonies,” he says and throws a pile of files onto Draco’s desk.
“We have a case of Miranda Barkley, 67, poisoned at the wedding of her daughter. She survived, but we have a problem with identifying the potion and the person behind it.”
“I’m working on a case where a person has been poisoned, and I’m having trouble identifying the potion. I have access to the Library of the Dark Arts—perhaps you know that—but I found absolutely no lead there which makes me think that maybe it isn’t a Dark potion, that maybe someone combined two common potions with the intention of causing harm this way.”
“Are you all right?” Harry asks.
“That’s not true—”
“A punishment?”
“Don’t be stupid,” Draco says, but Harry’s already on his way to the living room.
Harry wasn’t going to touch his wrists. Draco knows it, of course. Harry has never done it after that one time he tried to do it and Draco panicked. It was years ago, and years have passed, and Harry has never done it again, yet, right now, Draco feels scared for some reason.
“I just don’t. I don’t think I owe you an explanation.”
. Draco hangs his head even lower; he’s so tired of everything. So tired of pretending, so tired of collecting himself together after every time he fails, after every time he presents his weaknesses to the world and makes some embarrassing show of himself.
“We can Reparo it. Or not. It doesn’t matter.”
“You’re making me happy. You have a job that helps people. You’re trying to become a better person, and I see your fucking effort, every day. I see how much it costs you, when you don’t have any energy left after you come back home, or when you get back from Angelique and barely talk with me for the rest of the day—I see it. I see how much you’re trying.”
“I want to be alone,” he says after a short while.
“Why are you so… angry? Why don’t you want me to touch you all of the sudden?”
“A sponge cake. Uhm, I do the butter, and you do the eggs.” He pushes the egg box and a bowl towards Draco.
“Is it because of Ron and Hermione? You can’t stand seeing yourself right next to them?”
Draco looks at him sideways. “Like sitting in my living room, doing nothing?”
He knows how to use this spell wandlessly, but it doesn’t work because he’s in too much distress. He’s so panicked he’s barely able to pronounce a single word, let alone concentrate.
“I didn’t go there alone.”
When they’re having breakfast that day, Draco explains the concept of pain flashbacks to Harry.
“Does it also mean… you don’t look into mirrors?”
“No! Everything is exactly the same as always.”
“Do you want to stop for now?” Harry asks, his eyes full of worry.
Draco lives constantly anticipating something horrible. Right now, as he’s walking through the hall to his bedroom, he looks out for any signs of danger. Who knows what could happen? With the Dark Lord residing here, anything is possible. Maybe the Dark Lord is right around the corner, or maybe at this very moment he’s sitting on Draco’s bed, patiently waiting for his arrival.
“I love you.”
“I’ve been doing horrible, horrible things throughout my entire life. Don’t you think I deserve a punishment for that?”
He knows they have to talk.
She laughs.
“I've missed you,” Harry says, his arms around Draco’s stomach, his chin on Draco’s shoulder.
They start to chat, momentarily ignoring Harry. Draco gets so caught up in the conversation that he jumps when there’s a sudden noise behind him.
“I don’t know. I just… I just do. And I regret things, too. I regret what I did to you.”
“I want to trust you,” he says. “And I don’t want to hide things from you. I don’t want to hide
Harry furrows his brows. “Draco, of course not. I wouldn’t try to manipulate you like that.”
“It’s not my job to tell you what’s good and what’s bad.”
Harry nods. He appears thoughtful, so Draco gives him a moment, but even after a while Harry still stays silent.
