“And you know, back in my day mixed kids wouldn’t be very well seen, but the world’s changing quickly, they’re so cute now!”
“Sorry.” He says. “I had a nightmare and I-” He turns back to look at Ron, only it isn’t Ron and he’s staring straight into the gorgeously green eyes of one Harry fucking Potter.
“Did you destroy them?” Potter has a hand wrapped around her son’s ankle, and Narcissa sees – very curiously – how they fit together. It’s melancholic, to watch them like this. It reminds her that her baby’s all grown up, and that she wasn’t a part of it. Any of it.
“Still!” Draco says. Bill knows him better than anyone – he practically raised him, all of them, since Molly was busy often – and if Draco hadn’t told him that he wants to read it, he’d know something was up.
Harry still remembers it, the first time he saw Draco; everyone had known who he was. Anyone even remotely familiar with the Riddle case knew his face better than they knew their own. Harry had practically seen Draco grow up through pictures and magical security feed, in his parents’ pinboard at home, where they kept everything relevant to the Riddle case. Even now, that James and Lily are retired from the force, they keep their pinboard up.
His dads, hand in hand, standing beside him like they were always meant to, standing next to each other like a choice they made, over and over, even if it got them killed. Scorpius wonders if they’d do it differently, if they could.
Bill and Fleur have just stepped out to eat something, Charlie’s on his way back from Romania, and Percy stopped by earlier, but left quickly, presumably caught up with something from the ministry.
“Alright,” he agrees. “So we’ll just have to do it in private, won’t we Harry?” he hums and runs his fingers teasingly through Harry’s chest. Harry’d like to pretend it doesn’t get to him, but, frustratingly, it does. He’s not a virgin, damn it, the ‘
“Hey brat,” His brother smiles fondly, squeezing at his shoulder before sitting down on the chair next to Draco’s. “Mom and dad were called into the ministry by the Aurors. What happened?”
“We don’t work with half the information, not even with our actual friends.” Zabini says drily. “It’s how you get caught.”
Draco doesn’t know how long it’s been since the wedding – and that’s his only point of reference to time passing – but he’s very slowly wasting away. The only thing he ever feels is the vicious fear whenever the door is opened and someone comes to fetch either of them from the dungeons.
“I don’t know!” Parkinson yells back. “Draco came looking for Smith and as soon as he saw him he hexed him! And then Smith tried to hex him back, but-”
“Merlin, let me think.” Draco says. McGonagall shoots him a warning look, which he willfully ignores. “How can I say this in a way you’ll understand, since the previous sixteen clearly haven’t worked? I didn’t know whatever his name is existed until two weeks ago, when he escaped
Draco’s face is immediately burning, and he can only imagine how red he is. Ginny laughs, and he glares at her. “
“McGonagall’s going to be our moderator,” Draco informs him brightly; McGonagall is sitting on Dolohov’s bed, regal as ever, in black formal robes and a pointed hat.
It’s… everything. Draco doesn’t know how to describe it. It’s urgent and relaxed at the same time, it’s soft, and firm, and warm, and kind, and
Harry couldn’t believe it when he’d seen Draco in the Auror Academy. A face he knew so well, a face he’d memorized, suddenly standing right in front of him and Harry could do
“I told him to get rid of you.” Zabini’s looking at him like he’s never seen him before. “I told him to leave Potter. I didn’t - I wanted him to live. He was my best friend, he was everything.”
This takes place immediately after the last chapter, harry's just finished talking to McGonagall and Draco to the grey lady :D
“Yes,” Granger says, when Narcissa has taken too long to respond. She’s sitting near Ronald Weasley, and neither of them are looking at each other. Narcissa wants to snort. She remembers being young and embarrassed about things like kissing. Her life has changed since then. “We’re only missing Nagini. And well…”
Ron hums. He’d rather Harry were already in love with Draco, but he won’t say anything. Draco will kill him if he even thinks about meddling in another one of his relationships – the last time had
“Headmistress.” Remus knocks on the door quietly. “Parvati Patil let Mr. Weasley the youngest into the Gryffindor Common Room at two a.m. last night.”
“Do you want to…?” Harry trails off, pulling a bit of his blanket backwards, patting the mattress next to him.
“Good,” He admits. “Better than I have in a long time.” He chews on his lower lip. “I just – I don’t know. What if I completely mess it up? Should I get him flowers? I don’t want him to think I want to marry him or anything – not that I don’t want to marry him-”
“It’s got to be a lie, right?” Draco says, chewing on his thumbnail. When his friends don’t respond, he gives them a sharp look. “
Molly flushes in anger. “He’s just a boy. He shouldn’t have been a part of this, and you dragged him into it.”
He does not feel fine. He’s mortified beyond belief, and he wishes he were anywhere else in the world.
“It wouldn’t even be much work!” Draco pleads. Plus, Potter sneaks around the castle all the time, it’s not like it’d be
She gives them a light smile. “I do think he remembers you. He could answer all your names, and your parents’ names. There might be a few things missing, but he knows who you are.”
“I was in the Occlumency lessons, with Snape.” He says, taking a deep breath. “And I saw something.”
“Right.” Parkinson says, but the delighted look doesn’t leave her face entirely. “Theo and Draco aren’t dating anymore, but they still have the occasional meet ups.”
“Me, too,” Draco admits. “I - I'm sorry about the debate. It was a bad idea, and I should’ve just talked to you openly about why I was scared. I – I think I know how to fix this.”
“Why do they think it’s from Lucius Malfoy?” Blaise asks abruptly. He shoots an apologetic look at Pansy, and though she glares lightly, she doesn’t continue when she was saying.
The healer’s lips tighten. “Well, they’re signs we generally see in people who are being trained in Occlumency or Legilimency too quickly. It’s a process that should take its time. Do you know if he was learning that, or who could’ve been teaching it to him?”
“I – yesterday-” how can he even explain that? He wasn’t supposed to be here in the first place, and he couldn’t tell them about Hermione. “I had a nightmare, I was looking for you!”
She reaches through the table and cups his cheek, and Draco pulls away. Her face pinches, pained, but she drops her hand.
He slips inside the shut drapes, and it’s even darker then, but he manages to move Ron’s limbs to make space from himself. Ron makes a little grunt and Draco snuggles into the mattress, taking the blankets and wrapping them around himself, and, finally feeling safe, he falls asleep.
He can’t see anything because of the cloth tied around his eyes – they always blindfold him when they take him out of the dungeons – but he’s counted the steps, he has every turn and bump on the floor memorized, and he knows they’ve gone the wrong way.
And Blaise is his best friend, he has to have a good reason for this. He wouldn’t just do that to Draco, would he?
“Hello, Mr. Weasley.” She says gently. “You’re in St. Mungo’s. Can you tell me who’s the minister right now?”
“So,” Thomas grins from where he’s sitting on Adam’s bed with his arms wrapped around him. Draco shoots him a warning look. It’s the first time Harry’s been around his dorm mates – he’s sitting on the bed while Draco finishes packing – and he just
Draco gives a half-shrug, frowning. “Pansy always knows much more than she tells us. She’ll tell us when she makes sense of it.”
The scratching intensifies, and Harry takes his hand to stop him. Neither pulls away, and it’s sort of awkward, holding hands, but Draco’s almost swooning over the contact, however small it is.
Thank you so much for the wait babes <3 I hope yall enjoy this chapter it wa made with all my love <3
Sooo i've had an insane first few weeks of school but don't worry babes, i haven't abandoned this story <33
“Kids aren’t something you compromise about, they’re people!” Draco exclaims. “Either you want them, or you don’t, there’s no halfway.”
Draco wakes up cold and alone. The floor he’s lying on is damp and uneven. He thinks, for a moment, that the reason he can’t see is because he’s been blindfolded, but he’s not. His next conclusion is that he’s been blinded, and the panic rises in him like a tide wave. He forces himself to breathe, forces himself to
“Potter is going to be staying at Draco’s house.” He explains. “He doesn’t know what he’s going to do because he’s been hopelessly in love with the scar-headed prat for the better of six years.”
Hermione’s muttering charms Harry doesn’t recognize and waving her wand in complicated patterns, and she throws him a glare.
“Whatever it is – whatever they do, you must not let them win. I’ll teach you how to – I’ll teach you everything you need, but you must promise me, Draco.”
“Alright,” Ron says calmly. “So now you can tell me how you’re in love with Harry and why you didn’t tell me.”
Draco goes red again and buries his face in his hands. “Merlin, this is so embarrassing. Does he hate me? Did he say he hated me? He must think I’m ridiculous-”
“What?” Ginny asks, but he’s already running back towards Dolohov’s room. He doesn’t know what he expects to find when he opens the door to Dolohov’s room, but it’s certainly not Mrs. Thomas holding a glowing blue orb; Harry knows it’s a bomb, thankfully a steady one. Mrs. Thomas would have to break it to set it off; so as long as she doesn’t, they’re safe.
He comes back, wakes up in Hagrid’s arms, and he can see Draco, standing there, and they’re in the middle of the Hogwarts grounds, and of course Draco sees him, he always does, he always has, and he does the last thing he can.
“Well, would you look at the time!” She says, and Draco glares at her venomously. “Draco agreed to be my best man, so we’re off to do some bridal – wedding – planning – things.”
Draco’s wand?” Zabini asks, raising an eyebrow. He’s handsome in a way very few people are, and Harry understands why half the school has had or currently has a crush on him.
“Since we’re all sharing things we should’ve told each other sooner,” She says, grinning nervously. “I’ve been doing some research.”
what Draco needs like that, not when it should be Harry in his place, shagging Draco into the mattress when he needs it and curling around him and under a warm blanket when he’d rather do that.
The next morning, in the Hufflepuff dorm – Draco slept better than he has since he disappeared – Draco stresses over outfits and ways to do his hair, even if he knows it’s ridiculous. It’s not a
“You should talk to him. I’ve already told him about it, you’d just have to establish a time. Practice it as often as possible, if you will. It’s very important, especially this year.”
Harry tunes him out as he continues rambling, instead using his time to rub the tip of his nose against the line of Draco’s throat, teases his lips against his clothed shoulder. Draco hums again, and he sits between Harry’s legs when he straightens back up. Harry wraps his arms around his boyfriend’s waist, and Draco burrows himself deeper against his chest.
Everything is blurry, his ears are ringing. Distantly, he knows he needs to stand, needs to reach his wand. Without it, he’s as good as dead, and he needs – needs – needs –
It had turned into a less happy occasion when Draco continued to avoid them all – especially Harry – and they realized that even though he loved them, it didn’t change just how angry he was at them.
“And I’m just your boyfriend,” Draco says. They stop swaying, and Harry runs a hand through his dreadfully messy hair.
have sex, Weasel, but usually, when people are naked and with someone that’s making them feel good, they don’t have their wands with them.”
He’s on Draco in a second, kneeling beside him and pulling his head onto his lap. He’s blinking, trying to clear his head now, and there are tiny cuts all over his face and neck. Harry curses nastily in his head.
“Did you?” Ron asks, heart pounding. He desperately wants to grab Draco’s forearm, see if he has the mark, but he won’t; he wouldn’t.
“I - I don’t know what to say,” Harry says sincerely. “I - Draco, I've always wanted kids. A lot of them.”
Sometimes, Harry thinks he doesn’t know how to do anything any other way; without lying, without manipulating, without carefully thinking and planning it out cynically. That he doesn’t exactly understand how things work in situations where a mistake won’t get you killed.
“Draco, it’s not-” Zabini begins immediately, trying to push himself up, but Draco shakes his head quickly, interrupting.
“I put a tracking spell on his wand.” Hermione says, and Harry looks at her disbelievingly. He’d thought she of all people would want to keep this quiet. “When I thought Lucius Malfoy might want to kidnap him.”
? Draco thinks to himself in wonder. Really, of all the ways he could’ve imagined this moment, this was not even remotely it.
time. He feels too skinny in her arms, lighter than he used to be, and it’s all wrong. It feels all wrong.
“She payed for us to stay in a huge hotel room.” Fred says. “We spent most of the trip there, she mostly wanted to see Draco.”
want to blow up, which, I’m telling you Aida, is a pretty tough stance to take,” Harry says. “Okay, for my opening statement: I don’t want to blow up. I don’t want to die. I have a husband outside of this room, and he thinks I’m angry with him, and I can’t die while he thinks I’m angry with him!”
“He feels you’re hiding things from him.” Harry says. When the other three look at him, his face heats and he shrugs. “He mentioned. But yeah. I should’ve told you both sooner. I’m sorry.”
to sleep with. Charlie’s, Bill’s, and Percy’s rooms are not being used at the moment, but Draco’s not dumb enough to go into any of them. Charlie’s left enough Dragon related things there when he’s come back home, and some of them are very fragile, and Bill’s a fucking curse-breaker, and he’s not very neat. Draco doesn’t want to end up cursed.
He chews on his lower lip, and his voice comes out weak when he speaks. “Would you mind if I slept with you tonight?”
“We have him,” Hermione’s otter Patronus says. “White man, mid-thirties, unarmed and wandless but with a picture of Dolohov.”
“Empty your mind, Potter.” Snape drawls with a sneer. “Don’t be a Gryffindor. Feelings are useless, letting other people know about them is deadly.”
“Yeah. I’m going out with Gin.” He says. They do it every few weeks to catch up, even if they talk every day. “Why, did you have something in mind?”
department’s care. I have never spoken to him, I’ve never seen him, and if I had been in contact with him before today I wouldn’t have brought the letter to Headmistress McGonagall!”
Draco waves them both away impatiently, and Harry decides that they’ll definitely revisit this subject later.
Potter gets under the covers, and then, to Draco’s mortification, pats the space beside him. He complies, lying stiffly on top of the blanket, trying not to look at Potter too often.
Draco’s hand goes to his sleeve to get his wand, only for him to remember that he’d left the Slytherin dorm without it.
“Shit,” Zabini mutters, grabbing the wand from Hermione. Harry throws his invisibility cloak over Ron and Hermione, and moves to get under it.
“We could find out.” He suggests. His friends look at him with the wicked look they all get when they’re about to do something they shouldn’t.
It’s relatively quiet on Sunday, and then they all pack up and get on the Hogwarts express to the Weasley’s for Bill and Fleur’s wedding. They’re getting married Friday, and Draco can barely contain his excitement, even if he is a little nervous about seeing his mum for the first time since he found out he was adopted.
“We need to get to Hogwarts.” Narcissa points out. Harry knows she’s right, even if he’s tired of this. All of this. He feels oddly jumpy without Draco in his arms or in the room, and he’s trying not to let it get to him.
Harry swallows. He needs to tell them about the Horocruxes. He needs to tell them he is a Horocrux, but anytime he tries to, he sees them, and they’re happy, and he doesn’t want to ruin that.
But that’s not going to happen, and if Harry has a chance – even the smallest chance – to give Draco a few more minutes to live, hours, days,
They spend the whole train ride talking of various things – Blaise’s last piano recital, Pansy’s second time running away, how Draco’s doing in the muggle Ballet academy he goes to – and don’t even notice how much time goes by before they arrive at Hogwarts.
Draco hugs his mum back, and she smiles and pets his hair lightly before moving on to hug everyone else. When they get to the burrow there’s a similar flurry of hugs in which Bill smacks Draco and calls him ‘a bloody idiot’, with which Fred, George, and Charlie agree.
“Hypothetically, let’s say they do. Why is it bothering you?” He asks. “Everyone knows things we don’t. Just like we know things they don’t.”
They became friends because the three of them spend a lot of time in detention. When McGonagall had come back from leaving them cleaning trophies and had seen matching looks of mischief on their faces, she’d nearly fainted. The three of them had just grinned.
“What’s happening?” Ron grumbles as he opens his drapes. He raises his eyebrows at Draco lying on the floor. He looks up at the bed, where Potter’s still staring at Draco with wide eyes, and then back at Draco. His eyes narrow. “Were you just sleeping in Harry’s bed?” he glares at Potter. “Did you just have my baby brother in your bed?!”
This’ll have to do, for now. Whatever happens, with Voldemort, with the war, with Lucius bloody Malfoy; Draco’s Harry’s, just as much as Hermione and Ron are, and Harry’s not going to let anything happen to him.
“It could-” he begins, but before he can continue, there’s a hand at the back of his neck, gripping tightly, and a long-suffering sigh.
“How am I supposed to-” he begins, but she interrupts him by pulling him into a narrow alley. She kisses his forehead quickly.
When the day is over and everyone’s at lunch – Draco’s been skipping the meals lately to avoid seeing his so called friends – he goes to the Astronomy tower and sits with his legs dangling out the windows, looking at the students passing through.
think they were siblings after all, but he’s more furious than he’s ever been in his life, and there’s a tight, burning mess of emotions sitting on his sternum making him want to
“Then, you were born and you were tiny, and an hour old and already what I loved most in the world.” Her eyes are watery, and she blinks quickly. “I didn’t want to give you up. The plan was to leave you at St. Mungo’s, just leave. That was it. I wasn’t even supposed to look at you, but…” She wipes at her eyes quickly. “I couldn’t. I had to hold you. And I did, and you were perfect, you
They wake up later again, when Ron freaks out about Draco being in his bed, and Harry showers and goes with McGonagall so they can visit Dumbledore. She floos the two of them only, leaving a worried looking Remus, Hermione, Ron, and Draco behind, and as much as Harry wishes he could stay with them, he can’t.
, he thinks decisively. He’ll do whatever he has to, for Harry. He doesn’t care what he has to do, Harry will survive this. He’ll make sure of it.
It’s the only thing that came in the mail yesterday, but it came from Malfoy Manor, so Draco assumes whoever was sending him letters isn’t dead.
“McGonagall and Remus… they think I’m a Horocrux, too.” He says. “When he tried to kill me and it rebounded, he left a piece of his soul in me.”
Harry tries to look half as excited as he knows Draco would at the prospect of a structured debate about whether or not to set off a bomb, but he’s not quite sure he manages it.
He presses himself against the corner furthest from the cell bars, and sinks down onto the floor, shaking like a leaf. He desperately tries to think of something to do, anything to keep the panic that’s threatening to suffocate him at bay, but he can’t think.
Harry laughs, and allows him to change the subject. “Well, if this goes as well as I think it will, we could probably take a week off. Go to Brazil, sleep all day. How does that sound?”
“He likes you, too, you know?” She says conversationally, though she does lower her voice. “Ron would understand.”
“Nothing except for another wizard or witch.” The healer says, answering their mom’s question first. “A very experienced one, at that. They seem to have deleted most of his memories from the past three days except for a few ones they’ve selected. It’s complicated enough to delete determined amounts of time from people’s memories, it’s even more to delete determined memories.” She pauses. “And, frankly, I don’t know if there’s a way to get them back. With usual memory charms, sure, when they’re removed.”
And he knows Draco has, because no matter how he tries to hide it, Harry sees it in his eyes; he sees the bleakness, the panic, the desire to flee. The fear. No one deserves to live scared, and Draco’s terrified.
Remus watches fondly – and very, very amused – as Harry runs his hands through his hair and huffs nervously. Even without knowing it, he’s exactly as James used to be. He’s doing the exact same thing James did after Lily said yes to their first date; it’s like watching it all over again, and it makes Remus’s heart ache longingly.
“Well, they said the only reason they’d want anything here is because of Potter, right? So who cares about Potter?”
“You’re the youngest one of us.” Ginny says. She always enjoys reminding him of that, because that means she’s older than at least one person in the family. “And you’re a Hufflepuff. You need
Snape nods. There’s a loud meow that Draco recognizes as Mrs. Norris’s, and Snape looks back and purses his lips.
“You’ve been sleeping in the Gryffindor dorms for weeks, Draco, so something must be going well.” Thomas grins. “Potter, you have to be gentle with our Draco, because he’s still a blushing virgin-”
a pure soul?” Jae complains, pointing at Thomas. He’s singing to the tree in a low voice, not even paying attention to the rest of them. “He’s the dirtiest of us all!”
, and if – I can’t. If he finds me and you’re with me, he’ll kill you. I can’t risk that happening to you.”
, Harry!” Draco’s worked up now, on the verge of freaking out, and Harry honestly didn’t know how opposed Draco was to this. “I’d have to take time off work, and my body would change, and who would even-”
They’re sitting on the bleachers of the Quidditch Pitch, having just finished a Gryffindor-Hufflepuff match. Since he’s the only person who isn’t acting entirely weird around him, whenever Draco’s not alone, he’s with him.
“I’m glad,” he says, even if he knows it’s a lie. Part of being with Draco is, sometimes, letting him lie. Letting him keep his own space.
“They’ll figure it out.” she says. “They’ll know I stole them, and they’ll know you’re the only possible key. They’ll want you to join their side, and if you don’t, they’ll want to force you.”
Harry’s just finished speaking to McGonagall about the Horocruxes, and he’d been telling Ron about how they have to go speak to someone named Dumbledore and the Elder wand – which Ron had believed a fairytale – and how Sprout was going to ask Draco to find two Horocruxes; at the mention of the name, he’d gotten the sad, far away look he’s currently wearing.
Zabini and Parkinson share another silent conversation. Harry’s going to hex them if they do that one more time.
“You know it’s true, too.” Malfoy says. “It’s why they’ve all been acting so strange around you for weeks. Since they found out, they don’t love you. They don’t want to see you.”
“Merlin, the mood here has sure gone downhill.” Ginny mutters. She forces herself to smile brightly. “How’ve you been? What’s been going on with Harry?”
He concentrates harder on the memory he’s chosen – the time Blaise, Pansy, and him were fifteen and managed to charm all of the portraits to chant ‘Blow me’ ominously for
“McGonagall let me stay with you.” Draco says. Minerva McGonagall’s been Head Auror for over twenty five years now, longer than Harry’s been alive; appointing her was the single best decision the DMLE ever made. “Everyone else is going back to the precinct.”
Honestly, as much as he loves his family, it’d been a relief; he needs a break from having them look at him like they’re scared for him.
“Having kids won’t ruin anything, Draco,” Harry tells him. “You’re right, I do love you, and I know you love me, too, but kids have nothing to do with that! They won’t change our feelings for one another, they’ll just enrich our lives!”
of us dying,” Draco says, and his voice breaks. “I can find a way to destroy the Horcrux, I can, Harry, I know I can-”
He’s in the nursery the first time Dobby starts a conversation. Draco’s been doing it because he’s terribly lonely, but Dobby had limited himself to answering Draco’s questions with short sentences.
this, needs Harry to agree, to take him along, to be with him even if they both die before next year. “I’m not some Muggle wife you can just leave behind when there’s a war.” he tries to blink the tears away, but a few of them slip down his cheeks. “I can’t – I
we’re not doing that.” Ginny says, frowning. “It’d be creepy enough to sneak up on him in the shower, getting him to have sex with someone just to steal from him would be creepier still!”
Merlin, but this would be exactly the kind of thing he would go to Blaise to talk to about. He’s not stupid enough to go wondering around Hogsmeade in the dark, not with everything the Death Eaters have been doing, so he goes straight to the only place Draco thinks could make him feel better right now.
“He was a part of it before.” Narcissa says quietly. “And if I hadn’t informed him of certain things – like the Horcruxes, might I say – he would be worse off than he was.”
“Or it’ll end with us having to destroy the part of Voldemort that’s inside of me.” Harry tells him. “You know that. You must know that.”
“Okay, okay,” He says. “You know the only thing to do here?” Mrs. Thomas shakes her head. “Structured debate!”
Ever since he started spending more time with Draco his feelings for him shifted from friendship to something bigger, but he doesn’t know if it’s love. He doesn’t want Draco dating anyone who isn’t him, that’s for sure, and alright, whenever he looks at him there’s this sort of fluttering in his chest that sort of makes him feel like he might fly, right there without a broom, and when everything’s too much Draco just makes it somehow quiet down, be manageable, and he makes his nightmares go away, and he’s kind, and gorgeous, and funny, and an insufferable brat when he wants to be, and Harry’s three hundred percent sure that’s the man he wants to spend the rest of his life with, have babies, adopt six million stray dogs because Harry can’t ever say no to them, but that’s not
“You can’t lie like that to me again,” Draco says, snapping Ron out of his haze. “I won’t stand it. You’re supposed to be my brother.”
Harry – who’d stood the second he’d seen Draco walk into the room – opens his arms, and, a second later, Draco’s wrapped around him like he wants to disappear. He buries his face into his chest.
Scorpius has been told he looks exactly like his dad; with the white-blonde hair and the fair skin, all he really has from his father is the green eyes, which everyone in the wizarding world recognizes as soon as they see him.
He leaves the office, closing the door behind him, and Potter’s there, leaning against the wall and fiddling with his wand.
“Fine,” He says, desperately trying to ignore the way Potter’s arm – his shoulders broadened this summer, and he’s grown a foot and a half, and he looks so good Draco wants to hex something – brushes against him every time he moves. “Yours?”
“No, Draco, it’s not like that,” Harry tries, untangling himself from Zabini to get off the bed. He can’t let Draco think that he wants Zabini like that, not when Draco’s the only one Harry’s wanted for the longest time now, wrapped safely in his arms.
“I-” Draco desperately scrambles for a way to take back what he’s said – or at least somehow wave it away – but he can’t think of anything. “I-”
They’re quiet for a few minutes before there’s a groan from the bed, and they all look down at Draco, blinking at them blearily.
Draco snorts and shakes his head, half-shoving Harry’s shoulder before passing him the chocolate bar.
“What do you think yours’ll be?” Pansy asks. She bats her eyelashes at him. “A doe, to match Potter’s?”
“It’s alright,” Harry cups his face, and Draco’s sob is enough to break his heart, enough to make him want to stay. He’d be selfish for this; he’d stay, he’d run away, he’d doom the rest of the world if only he and Draco could have a different fate.
“We’re not having sex.” Draco explains. He can’t possibly ignore how much his face is burning, but he feels like he needs to clear this up. “We
The waitress arrives with their food – Narcissa ordered him something, apparently, because the waitress places a plate full of food in front of him – and Narcissa smiles and thanks her.
“Really?” he asks. “Because from where I was standing, it looked like ‘rescuing’ was exactly what you needed.”
“You know,” Hermione says attentively, and Harry knows already what she’s going to suggest. It’s the same thing she’s been suggesting for weeks now. “This would be easier if we asked him. And he could help a lot – he’s really smart-”
what Draco wanted to avoid, so he opens his mouth to protest. Before he can, however, they’re already walking out.
He’ll get the Baron kicked out of Hogwarts if it’s the last thing he dos. The Grey Lady doesn’t deserve to be spending eternity like this, forever hidden away and avoiding a man who harmed her.
“I’m not,” Draco says, crying out in pain when Bellatrix drags him up by the hair to look at his face. Harry’s fists tighten behind his back, and he struggles, but Lucius Malfoy tightens the spell around his wrists until the edge of his vision darkens from the pain of it. “I don’t – I haven’t seen him in so long – and – I can’t tell.”
Up until now, Narcissa has kept herself at a distance from Draco, uncertain of where she fits here. The Weasley’s… they’re a family. They’re her baby’s family, and even if she wanted to take him away from them – which she does want, so,
It’s been quite a while since he’s woken up screaming, but it used to happen very often when they were younger, though he usually sneaked into Bill’s bed.
“You should’ve made him.” It takes Scorpius a moment to realize it’s he who talked; if he knew something was going to lead to Rose’s death, if he couldn’t stop it – what would he do?
Draco shares a dorm with him, Thomas Franco, Adam Caron, and Jae Lee. They’ve become close friends over the years, and Draco’s thankful that he gets along with his roommates.
“No,” He says, quickly grabbing his shoes. “It’s fine. I – I have to leave, I’ll, err, see you both later – I’m glad you’re-” he waves a hand towards them. “Happy.”
“The best,” Draco says, smiling up at him through long, pale lashes, and it’s not fair the way it makes Harry’s heart try to escape his ribs.
Hiiiiii sorry it took so long :/ I re-wrote this chapter like fifteen times, no exaggeration :( hope you enjoy it! A little of the golden trio for a change..
“Don’t think about him.” Sirius waves it away. “And I was asking about the letter we got that you had been in an accident?”
“I just…” Draco sighs. “I don’t know. Have you ever felt like every single person you know knows something that you don’t?”
It’s alright, love,” Harry says, soothingly moving a hand up and down Draco’s back. Draco makes a small, choked noise, and Harry hushes him gently, pressing a kiss to the side of his neck. “Draco, love, wake up. It’s alright. It’s just a nightmare.”
He fires the killing curse knowingly, at everyone who tortured him those long months at the manor. He sees his classmates –
There’s suddenly a hand on his forearm, and Draco flinches violently, scrambling away from it immediately, pressing himself against the wall.
“We haven’t opened it.” McGonagall says. “Mr. Lupin and a few other professionals are checking it for curses or any sort of remaining magic trace.”
There’s a touch on his arm, and Draco rips around, anger like a wave at being interrupted, ready to kill whoever’s broken his concentration.
McGonagall shakes her head lightly. “He always was very creative with his charm work. What did he say about the others, then?”
Ginny knows there’s no changing his mind, knows what could happen. That they might not see each other again, if anything happens to either of them, so she does what she can. She sits next to him and hugs him.
“I swear, Draco, I don’t. I just meant that if everyone who loves you is hiding something from you, maybe it’s best that you don’t know.” He says.
It doesn’t really seem like he has a choice – he doesn’t know where he is, he doesn’t know how to get back, and he’s listening to everyone around him and doesn’t understand the language – so he merely begins walking when she does, though he refuses to take her arm.
” It’s Ginny who says it this time, kicking at a tipped over night table. The Police Department has been trailing Riddle’s criminal organization for almost three decades, and Antonin Dolohov was going to be their first major arrest; they’ve managed to catch some low ranking people who were mostly unimportant and couldn’t tell them anything even if they wanted to, since they had no clue as to what they’d really gotten themselves into, but Antonin Dolohov could’ve given them what they needed to take down Tom Riddle, the leader.
Though the spark of silver is stronger now, it’s still not a full Patronus. Draco wonders if he’s doing it on purpose, if he doesn’t want to do it right then because he is a bit worried it might be a lovesick puppy that’ll somehow announce to everyone his crush on Potter.
“Voldemort made Horocruxes.” He says. “They’re – you put pieces of your soul into things, and they keep it there. It’s made him immortal, at least until they’re all destroyed.”
He must’ve forgotten something, Draco thinks, because he’s not cowering and hurting in front of Greyback anymore. They’re not surrounded by a dozen death eaters whose entire attention is on Draco.
“Hi.” He says. He tries not to sound like a complete idiot as he continues. “Are you – is it – how are you?”
“Two more.” Ron says again, harder, and Draco half-arses the two attempts, leaving as soon as the second attempt fails, not bothering to listen to whatever it was someone was trying to tell him. Thankfully, no one follows.
And now they’re running, and Draco twists around to see that the Aurors are running after them, trying to get through the crowd. It slows them down, but it also slows Draco and Narcissa down, so it doesn’t help much.
“Basilisk venom.” Fletcher whispers, extending a small vial. It’s one of the last few things on the list Draco had given him. “It’s really, very quite rare. You need to be careful-”
“Wake up, princess.” It’s Greyback – he’s the only one who calls Draco that; it’s – funnily enough – not the worst name the death eaters call him, even if Greyback is – in Draco’s opinion – the worst of them. “You’ve a new roommate.”
Parkinson gives him an incredulous look. “Sex, Potter, as in, when Mommy and Daddy really, really love each other-”
“Merlin,” Hermione mutters anxiously. She’s more worried than he thought she’d be – Harry, too, he’s been worried and anxious since it happened – and though he knows it’s completely ridiculous, he feels a little bit jealous.
Potter snorts quietly, Granger’s lips quirk, and Ron looks momentarily disoriented at his perfect imitation of their mother. Draco’s friends snicker quietly.
“No you don’t!” Draco snaps accusingly. The anger is too suffocating, expanding, hot and burning, all over his throat and his lungs, and he feels like he just might crumple right there. When he speaks again, it’s barely above a whisper. “You don’t love me. If you did, you would’ve trusted me like I trusted you.”
His heart seems to be trying to beat out of his chest, and he looks around, trying to remember the way from wherever he’s being held to any sort of exit.
They’ll have to kill Nagini, they’ve already talked about it, but they haven’t talked about killing Harry.
Pansy’s is a Black Mamba, and though it was unexpected, it makes sense, in a way. It’s pretty but vicious, just like Pansy is.
There aren’t a lot of people in the street – no one wants to be outside with everything that’s been happening; there’ve been several death eater attacks since they escaped back in September, and people haven’t been feeling safe – and the ones that are outside are talking about the death eaters or Voldemort.
Draco takes a deep breath. “I wasn’t trying to hide it from you.” He pauses. In the privacy of Harry’s four-poster, he is unexpectedly soft. Nowhere near as sarcastic and witty as he is outside. “I mean, I wasn’t trying to hide it specifically from you. I promised the Grey Lady I’d destroy the diadem alone.”
Draco blushes brightly and grins. “He’s amazing, Gin. And because of the Patronus thing, we’ve been spending so much time together and he actually told me we’re friends, but I might’ve completely ruined it today—”
“You said you were in love with me.” He says, slowly, grip on Draco’s hand tightening slightly as if afraid he’ll run away.
“We don’t know that he’s back.” Harry says, even if it’s a lie. He does know, he just hasn’t told them yet.
“Get up, you arse.” Someone kicks at his bed, and Draco groans and covers his face in the pillow. It’s taken away a moment later. He groans again and throws an arm across his eyes to avoid the light. He hears a groan. “Merlin, but you’re lazy.”
His struggles, now renewed, become more insistent, but Greyback only laughs and digs his claws in tighter until Draco whimpers, eyes filling with tears. He blinks them away quickly and tries to balance himself so that he’s walking instead of just letting Greyback drag him.
“The only possible reason they’d want to come here is because of your brat, Lupin.” Snape drawls. “Wouldn’t it be safer for everyone else if he were to leave?”
“I hid three Horcruxes here in the manor.” Narcissa says. “The locket, the ring, and the diary. I’ll destroy them.”
“I don’t mean that you’re not – you deserve to have people in love with you, and I'm sure you do, I just - I don’t - I don’t feel anything like that, for anyone, and – you're like a sister, and-”
everything, he wants his family. He wants to not know any of this, he wants to know if Lucius Malfoy is telling the truth, wants Ginny to hug him and hold him and tell him Lucius Malfoy is full of shit, that none of it is true, that she didn’t know about this anymore than he did. He wants Harry to love him, he wants desperately to
“Not like you’d care if I was gone, is it?” Draco asks coldly, and a hurt look crosses Ron’s and Ginny’s faces. Merlin, but Draco hates them.
“So what the hell do you want me to do? Tell you the truth? You don’t let me speak for long enough to do that-”
“He was our friend!” She’s crying, tears and snot dripping down her face, but the wand she’s pointing at Nott is unflinching. “He was a
“Tell that to Miss Granger-Weasley,” she says coolly. “Tell that to Mr. Lupin and Mr. Black. To Edward.”
“Alright.” Ginny says uneasily; she closes the door and Harry can hear her walk away, and he sighs, relieved.
Draco loses track of things, during the battle. He sees the Dark Mark, he fires spells. He sees Hogwarts’ Crests, he doesn’t. He sees Lupin, at some point. Sirius Black, too, fighting back to back in a way that can only mean they’ve done this before, and Draco can’t imagine how they’ve managed. He doesn’t think he could ever do this again.
They’d threatened him with it; even gone as far as to use one of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes’ ‘realistic werewolf bite’ on Draco’s arm to convince him he’d bitten Draco. He’d eaten it up like candy.
“Mr. Weasley,” McGonagall takes her seat again. “I need you to be honest. I won’t tell the aurors, but I need to know. Have you been in contact with Lucius Malfoy before?”
“The seventh years are here to help you if you’re struggling!” Lupin announces. “Most of it is the memory though, so you have to find the right one. Start practicing.”
Remus and McGonagall look at each other, a silent conversation between them that Harry can’t understand.
It’s almost an hour and a half before the healer and the Mediwitch come out and tell them they can come in.
. They don’t talk too much about it, but Harry knows enough. Draco doesn’t feel like he belongs in either side, because many Aurors alienate him because of his past, and everything from his past was no longer an option the second he ran away, so he’s eternally stuck in a limbo he didn’t want and doesn’t belong in.
!” he manages to shout it just in time, and a flash of green fizzles out against the invisible shield. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
“We all believe things we know are a lie sometimes,” Draco shrugs. “This can be undone. We can destroy the diadem.”
“He killed my parents!” Scorpius yells, before he can stop himself. “Because of him, I have nothing.”
The Hat’s voice seems to be only inside his head, and he tries not to jump in surprise; despite how much he’s been looking forward to this moment, how much he wants it, he doesn’t think he could ever quite be ready.
Lessons with Potter also continue, and though Draco can regularly produce a patronus now, it’s not a corporeal one, so they see each other every day, at least until McGonagall announces that there’s been another death eater breakout out of Azkaban, Peter Pettigrew between them.
him. Scorpius almost fails Potions! And okay, he’s not as good as his dad – he doesn’t think anyone is, sincerely, since he was the youngest potions master until he died – but he loves to read, and he loves school, and he never,
Draco’s so confused he merely nods. Narcissa seems to need verbal confirmation, because she gives him a pressing glare until he answers.
Though he knows it only affects him, and it isn’t really a way to prove how angry he is at the professor, he feels oddly satisfied with himself.
“Just because I’ve given my blessing for this doesn’t mean I can’t take it back,” the red-head threatens.
“Umbridge is a bloody arsehole.” Rose drops herself next to him in the Great Hall, and Scorpius nearly flinches; he was immersed on his book about Dark Magic, because Voldemort is back – the mass murderer who killed his parents is
“I-” Draco’s about to say he doesn’t need help, but Lupin would see right through it. He sighs defeatedly. “When?”
She points him to Ron’s room, and he slips inside soundlessly. It’s very dark and he can’t see much, but he sees what he guesses is his brother’s bed, since it has several Weasley jumpers half in, half out of the trunk.
Everyone stares at it, because owls aren’t supposed to arrive at the Welcome feast. They only arrive at lunch, and even then, not one of them usually arrives to the Headmistress’s table, especially not a Ministry Owl.
to wake you up.” Ginny grins. She sticks her tongue out at him, and he scowls. “Don’t make that face, you’ll get wrinkles.”
“He’s my brother’s best friend!” Draco says. It’d be complicated enough if Potter didn’t spend every summer at his house, but he does, and so it’s even more.
-looking. “I don’t think I could ever forget. Mom has been writing about it in every single one of her letters. Even
“Hey,” Draco comes into the room right as Harry swings his legs over the side, and he breathes out relieved. “I got you coffee.”
“They’ve never cared about you, Draco.” Malfoy says, suddenly much closer, grip tight on Draco’s arm. “They’ve never cared about you and they never will. What do you think will happen after all this is over, even if your side wins the war? That they’ll welcome you with open arms and freshly made food? No.
She smiles lightly. “I know. It was repetitive, but it was the only think I knew about you. It was the only thing I knew you’d like.”
“How very… Slytherin of you.” She says finally. She bats her eyelashes. “Why ever would Malfoy want Draco?”
“The death eaters escaped.” The witch says. “They were always loyal. And that Potter kid was a baby, we don’t know what happened.”
“I love you, too.” He says. Harry can’t look away from his eyes, everything he’s ever wanted mirrored in them; to grow up, to be happy, to have a job, to get married, to be happy, to have children, to raise a family, to love his husband, to be happy, to grow old with someone, to be happy, to do something with his life that wasn’t defined by his birth and the murder of his parents, to be
“Yeah.” He nods, smile widening. “Honestly, it was hard to be in a bad mood when every step Snape took made the portraits chant ‘Blow me’ again and again.”
“Nothing’s wrong,” Draco looks hesitantly around. He looks like he doesn’t quite know how to fit in here anymore. It’s oddly sobering. “I-” his eyes still on Narcissa. “I know you.”
want to know is why you didn’t just bloody well tell me instead of making this whole – this whole shit show that ended up with me finding out from-”
He eats something and gets a few hours of sleep before he’s put to search again. Greyback doesn’t watch him anymore; they’ve instead told him that if he tries to escape, Luna will pay the price for it.
Because they protected him at all costs, with their lives, because they knew what they wanted, and Scorpius doesn’t have the smallest clue.
to – but Tonks saved him just in time, and they’re alive. Not in any shape to fight any longer, either of them, but
“It says here that the container it’s in has to be destroyed beyond Magical repair.” Draco says, rubbing at his eyes tiredly. “I don’t even know how to do that. There’re very few things beyond magical repair.”
the Death Eaters, bind them, and put a sleeping curse on them, assuring they won’t wake up until it’s lifted. The next thing they do is go to the nursery.
Ron tightens his lips slightly and sighs, finally asking the question they’ve both been avoiding for the past two weeks.
“Why do we have to do this?” Noah groans not ten minutes after they begin. They’re planting trees everywhere along the edge of the grounds. It’s partly for protection and partly because Sprout loves trees, and this is the useful thing she could come up with.
Deliriously, he thinks that it’s funny that his birth mother died to protect him and that now he’s here; stranded in a house full of people who want to kill him, stalling for time and attempting to survive the next second, minute, hour, day.
No one answers. And Draco can see the shock on all of their faces, the guilt piling strongly over it, and he knows Malfoy wasn’t lying; they all knew, and they’ve all been lying to him for Merlin knows how long.
“You don’t have to stay,” Mrs. Thomas tells him. “You can just walk out. Tell that husband of yours that you love him.”
“I’m not willing to raise a human being on ‘trying my best’, Harry,” Draco says. “‘Trying my best’ means
Sirius, Remus, and Teddy all show up to pick him up at King’s Cross, just like last year, and Remus kisses the top of his head when he sees him.
“Your so-called siblings know.” Malfoy says. “Your parents know. Parkinson and Zabini, they know, too. Your precious Harry Potter has been lying to you for
It still bothers him, that Draco didn’t tell him, but he doesn’t want to get mad without speaking to him first. Of course, with McGonagall fuming at him and Ginny and then Ron getting protective, they’d had little chance last night.
“Harry!” His mood lightens a bit when a flash of blond hair comes in sight, a second before Draco crashes into him, making Harry stumble backwards when he catches him.
Harry curses under his breath, and Hermione steps into the bathroom carefully, stepping over the broken mirror and Dolohov’s broken wand. She kneels over him, grabs his wrist, and places two fingers on his neck.
Harry’s not in a much better mood. Hermione seems to be tiptoeing around the two of them, uncertain of what will set them off, and they haven’t talked to each other since the wedding, two weeks ago.
“Draco Potter, ‘Mione,” Harry murmurs with a helpless grin; they’re not really supposed to be speaking – they're walking through the halls of Antonin Dolohov’s beach house, on their way to arrest him – but Harry can’t help marking the difference, even a year after they got married.
Draco throws his hands up, but he answers with much more respect than he did to the Auror. “Why does everyone keep asking me that? I’ve already
Draco’s in yellow badger pajama pants and a grey jumper that used to be Fred’s, so he’s rather easy to spot, as are the rest of his roommates (all with some sort of yellow clothing and various other bright colors), but that’s not really a problem when they know all the passageways through the castle.
mind sharing a bed with Potter because the last thing he needs right now is Potter finding out he has a crush on him because of Draco’s stupid sleep-talking.
, he thinks in a daze. It’s always been them, Scorpius-and-Rose, joined at the hip since she saw his little baby face, Scorpius-and-Rose, reading until dawn and quizzing each other because they’d be damned if there was anything they didn’t know, Scorpius-and-Rose, entering the Chamber of Secrets for Hugo because he’s Rose’s annoying little brother and she’d die before anything happened to him, and if Rose is dead then Scorpius is dead, too.
drew his parents crazy with the curse, and they didn’t deserve it. Draco’s shaking, unable to breathe, suddenly.
“Yeah,” Draco agrees warily, standing up and stretching. “We don’t have to set up cover, right? The Healers know we’re Aurors?”
them to their beds at night if she has to – and she’s not like Sprout, Draco doesn’t believe for a second she won’t follow through – and when he steps out into the Hall, Ron is standing there, with his arms crossed.
“So,” Draco says, avoiding Harry’s eyes because of how intensely he’s staring at him. Harry leans against the bedside table, very close to him, and Draco looks at his shoes, suddenly very interesting. “Err. Nice weather today, isn’t it?”
“I’ll go to the ball with you, Scorpius.” She laughs and then winks at him. “And don’t worry. You're like a brother, too. We could never date.”
“And I was already planning to leave the country, I thought I’d just take you with me, and on the way out – on the way out, I ran into Molly Weasley, she was there with her youngest for a checkup and I knew – I
to do it! I just asked about the sleeping arrangements because you’ve been sleeping with Harry at Hogwarts, and-”
McGonagall comes half an hour later to floo him and Ginny back to Hogwarts, and though he doesn’t want to, he goes with her as soon as she arrives. He needs to get away from the tense atmosphere, Fleur and Bill still pacing like crazy, Draco still in pain, no one sure what to say or what to do.
“Hi Draco,” Thankfully, Granger’s sitting in front of him – she’s spent the summer here – and unlike Potter or Ron, she seems to have a fair idea of Draco’s crush on Potter. As mortifying as that is, she’s never mentioned it, and she always pretends Draco’s not just made a fool of himself, so he likes her. “How was your summer?”
In Scorpius’s third year, Pansy Parkinson escapes Azkaban. Sirius writes him no less than half a dozen letters telling him not to interact with her if he ever sees her, and he doesn’t understand why he thinks he would.
“Brat,” Harry says, but there’s a teasing smile on his lips. “I’m serious. You’ve been very quiet lately.”
He wakes sometime later and blinks blearily. There’s a small sound of surprise beside him as he begins to stretch.
She seems to be even more nervous about this than Fleur is, and so she gives everyone something to do. Thankfully, everything she assigns to Draco is Fleur-related, since he is the best man, and so he doesn’t have to face Harry.
Draco nods and moves to sit on the chair beside Harry’s. As soon as he’s within reach, Harry reaches over and links their hands together, peppering kisses on Draco’s knuckles.
The meal in the kitchens is perhaps the most awkward thing Draco’s ever had to endure. They decided not to go to the Great Hall, because even though he’s cleaned up his face so there’s no blood on it, he still has bruises and cuts, and he doesn’t want Sprout to see it. She’ll give him detention for the rest of the year.
to tell someone you’re going out with if you have an ongoing relationship with someone else!” He says.
“I don’t really know what his logic was.” Harry says. “Okay, that’s a lie. He only turned in the first one because he thought it might be cursed, and then you said it wasn’t, but you didn’t let him read it-”
Remus shakes his head lightly. “Harry, forget about Ron for a second, okay? How do you feel about this ‘date’?”
“I’ve been helping mom around the kitchen for almost ten years.” Draco frowns. “Of course they were good!”
“I - hate kids, Harry.” Draco says, and he sounds uncomfortable, looking everywhere in the room but at Harry. “I hate messes, and that’s basically all kids are! Mess after mess after mess. And they’re sticky, and they cry a lot, and they’re always losing everything, and they’re
Draco’s face is dirty, bruises mottled all over it, both fresh and new. The most recent one is on the side of his face, a week old at most; it looks oddly round, like a stick, or a pipe, the darkness of it contrasting strongly against already previously pale skin, that now seems even paler.
for death, that it felt like the only option. That it still does somehow, even if he’s gotten out. He hates the fact that his body isn’t in that place, but his mind seems unable to leave it.
Soooooo i'm going back to school tomorrow, so if the updates get a little bt less regular don't worry babes.
Mrs. Thomas shakes her head. “I do. I do! My Sophie – did I tell you about my Sophie? - she’s pregnant! The father wants nothing to do with the kid, and the man told me he’d give her a million galleons if I did this!”
Harry nods. Now he just has to figure out how to be honest when Draco’s avoiding talking to him at all. He sighs.
kind of situation never ends well. It’s either in or out, especially with people. Anything in the middle lands him in a mess and leaves him with a bad taste of mouth.
They continue practicing the Patronus charm for the next couple weeks, but even as everyone else accomplishes it, Draco can barely manage a bit of silver mist.
“It changes often. The first time I conjured a Patronus, it was the first Christmas I spent at the Burrow. Remus and Sirius had to visit some cousin out of town, and I thought I’d be alone. And Ron invited me-”
“It’s not your fault,” Zabini repeats, louder. “I saw what was going to happen - I told Draco he was going to die because of you. He ignored me.”
He’s about to say something – probably something he shouldn’t – but someone swings an arm around his shoulders.
“We’ll see you at Hogwarts.” Blaise says. “Hopefully you’ll have gotten into Potter’s pants by then.”
Draco struggles while Ron drags him away from the students and the teachers beginning to arrive, and doesn’t stop until Ron shoves him down onto a chair in an empty potions classroom.
“You’ll need to tell us everything,” Sirius tells him. Scorpius knows he wasn’t meant to hear, but the Halloween he was six – the fifth anniversary of his parents’ death – Sirius and Remus were sitting in front of the fire drinking firewhiskey, and he heard them say no one was ever meant to raise their baby’s baby. That it was a special kind of sorrow.
damage, a night where they were the only ones left in the showers, and had suddenly, nauseatingly realized what it would really mean to grow up around someone like Riddle.
“We pretend we don’t know.” Pansy says. She upturns her nose defensively the way she does when she’s about to say something she’s ashamed of. “My parents… they used to have ties to you-know-who. I’ll ask about the Malfoys.”
He gets it later, when he and Rose overhear Headmistress McGonagall explaining that Parkinson ended up in Azkaban for betraying his parents, selling them out to Voldemort.
He flees to the safety of his bed, and only gets up when he has to shower to meet Ginny in Hogsmeade. He dresses in a warm jumper and muggle denims and meets her in front of Honeydukes.
“No.” he says firmly. “I wish – I wish I hadn’t said it that way, but I don’t regret how I feel about you.”
“Nothing.” Sirius is the first to recover. “Nothing, just – that name is not said so freely in the Wizarding World, Scorp. And – just – nothing.”
him and he doesn’t understand why, which makes him nervous, which makes his Potions less than stellar.
“Take me with you,” he repeats. Harry opens his mouth, and Draco doesn’t let him continue. “I – I know you say you need me to be safe, but who knows how Hogwarts will be after the Holidays? Or – or who knows what’ll happen with the death eaters, and Voldemort, and whoever the fuck else. Please, just –
Rose is Scorpius’s best friend, and there’s nothing romantic between them; that doesn’t matter. He can’t imagine his life without her, his wedding, his eventual children not knowing her, her existence, deleted from the world except for the people who’d remember her, him, always mourning.
“After curfew,” Hermione says, and Harry raises his eyebrows. “What? You just said it, I’m clever, and I like knowing things. When people,” she throws him an accusing look. “Don’t tell you things, you’ve to find out for yourself.”
“Oh, don’t act all high and mighty!” Ron snaps. “Don’t act like what you’ve been doing is any better! Lying to Draco’s face and then turning right around and getting angry at me for doing the exact same thing-”
“Hold still,” Narcissa Black is performing a healing charm on Luna’s face, a finger on her chin softly.
“Are you alright?” Lupin asks, and Draco looks at him, surprised. That’s not what he’d expected, if he’s honest.
“Coffee,” Harry repeats, brain still a bit foggy from the dream, stomach still tight in knots but less so than when he woke up, anxiety fading away gradually thanks to Draco’s hand running softly through his hair.
“I knew they had you in strict Hospital food diet,” Blaise says, grinning. “So I thought I’d surprise you.”
“We were planning to get the wand while he’s in the shower, after the Quidditch game.” Ginny explains. “But his teammates would be there, and-”
Malfoy’s stopped walking too, a few steps away from Draco. He can’t see a wand in sight or other Death Eaters, but he still feels in desperate disadvantage.
. The Weasleys love you with every bone in their body, and no matter what they say, no matter what it sounds like, the death eaters are not looking out for you. Don’t go down the path your father did, it’s not worth it.”
She presses a kiss to Draco’s hair when he finally slumps against Harry’s shoulder, passing out from exhaustion.
“You’re going to have to get out. All but one guardian.” The healer says, and the Mediwitch ushers them all out except Bill, and then slams the door closed in their faces despite their protests.
He catches sight of the blood running down Draco’s face, and he knows that’s it; he stomps across the crowd of students, and sends Smith flying back into a group of students while he grabs Draco’s collar tightly.
– they’ll try to turn it around, convince you they don’t love you, that you’re better off with them, and darling, you need to remember you’re
“I’m sorry, Gin.” Ron says finally. “I shouldn’t have made that choice for you. And I should’ve told you everything sooner.”
“I – it’s a-” He doesn’t know what to say. Should he tell her it’s a Horocrux? If Sprout told him to look for it, it means that Harry found the list of Horocruxes Draco left by his bed and he took it to McGonagall. He’s glad.
“You’ll have your memories when you need them, baby.” She whispers. “But I can’t let you know this. Not yet.”
“Okay,” Noah says as they all sit on their beds. From behind his closet, he pulls out a muggle pin up board. They use it whenever something happens, and this situation grants it. “So,” he takes one of the pins between his teeth and opens the drawer they have, full of information on a lot of things. He puts up Thomas’s drawing of Snape and pins it there. “Snape has a mystery godson.”
Their parents come back with chocolate bars after a few minutes, and their mom switches places with Bill, who begins pacing around with Fleur.
She turns around and floats back to the window, and Draco takes a deep breath and walks towards her.
“Well.” Granger begins, and Draco senses she’s going to answer his question, so he rests himself on his elbows and looks at her. “Voldemort made Horocruxes.”
The events of the wedding – however long ago that was – come back to him in what feels like a punch to the gut. He turns to the side and vomits.
want children as bad as I think I do, whatever it is we do one of us is going to end up being miserable in this relationship, and I love you too much to make you miserable for the rest of your life.” Harry opens his mouth, but Draco shakes his head again. “And I love
Ron looks up tiredly from where he’s sitting. Him, Ginny, Fred, and George are all sitting in the cramped hospital room they’ve put Draco in, while their parents are pacing around.
always there, and Harry can’t imagine a time when they’re not together, but he doesn’t have a choice.
Blaise rolls his eyes. “Yeah but with a little wax and a wand I can do Rita Skeeter’s family crest and it doesn’t mean I am her.”
“I can’t leave either,” Draco says. He feels somehow hollow and incredibly furious at the same time. The anger and the pain that are sitting in his chest like a rock is something he doesn’t know how to deal with, not like this.
And Draco realizes she’s right. It doesn’t matter why they kept him. It doesn’t matter if they’re his blood, he knows them; he
“There has to be sometime when he doesn’t have it with him!” Ginny says. “When do you not have your wands?”
“You’re not sending that Owl.” Harry says. It’s the first thing he’s said to either of them in weeks.
He does know. When he was younger and he realized his feelings for Potter, he’d taken to calling him by his last name because it seemed less personal to a ten year old Draco, as if that would somehow help him get over his crush. It didn't.
Pansy’s not helping matters; she’s acting even more weirdly than Ron and Harry are, and she’s avoiding him. Well, she’s not
“Let them be happy, Ronald.” Hermione says besides Ron, lying on the grass and reading a book on Horocruxes.
The letter lands Draco in the Headmistress’s office with a hurricane of teachers arguing over him and his parents being called to the school, along with a few aurors.
They all look up, and, surely enough, there’s an owl approaching, but instead of flying into Hogwarts, it lands next to them.
Scorpius sits in front of the mirror of Erised for what feels like an eternity or two. There are a lot of things he doesn’t remember about his parents; their voices, for one, or the way he’s been told his father used to sing when he cooked, but he’d know their faces with his eyes closed.
Remus and Sirius have been talking about it in whispers; Scorpius knows they think he doesn’t hear, but he does; he’s heard all of it.
“Alright,” he clears his throat again, leaning up on his elbows. “We don’t – we don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do. I’m not expecting anything. We can take it slow.”
“I never would’ve betrayed your parents,” Parkinson tells him, staring emptily down at Nott’s lifeless body. “I never would’ve done that to Draco.”
Draco’d rather Sprout not find out, but odds are she already did, and, if he’s quite honest, he doesn’t want to walk back alone either. The talk Snape was having with Malfoy freaked him out more than he cares to admit.
Theodore Nott, leaning against his bed, signs what Harry imagines must be an agreement, because Zabini flips him off.
The rest of them step in after him, and Ron whistles lowly. The bedroom is absolutely trashed; there are pieces of broken glass on the floor, furniture tipped over, the window shattered.
“Merlin, Hermione.” He hisses, looking around. Ron is engrossed in a conversation with Dean Thomas, and he doesn’t seem to be listening, but it’s still to risky.
Everyone tells him not to be scared – Teddy asks him if he wants to come home, half teasingly, but Scorpius knows he’d come get him in a heartbeat if he said yes – but his aunt Hermione doesn’t; she tells him to be careful, which, to him, sounds like she believes at least
“They all expect it.” Malfoy says. “They raised you and even then, they all expected you to turn into a death eater. It’s what they all think of you.”
Draco begins to shake his head as he sits up, straddling Harry’s lap. “No. I can’t – I can’t just sit around at Hogwarts while the three of you are out there almost
The healer pokes her head through the door and gestures their mom outside, but they all follow except for Ginny, who stays with Draco.
“They could be signing.” Zabini says. “Or they could just be napping. Draco gets too strung up sometimes, Theo always knows what he needs.”
Last year, someone had told everyone Draco’d blown Theodore Nott in the showers after Quidditch, effectively outing both Draco and Theodore. Everyone’d called Draco a slag for weeks afterwards, though they stopped saying it to his face after he’d hexed a Ravenclaw boy into spending a week in the infirmary.
Harry sighs. “I just – I know he’s angry at us, and he has every right to be honestly, but I wish I could talk to him about it.”
“You’re going to sit and you’re going to listen to me,” Smith says, grip tightening on Draco’s wrist to the point of painful.
“Here you are,” Harry sighs, when he goes into Dolohov’s room; he’d stepped out and looked for Draco all over the hospital, and he’d been honestly worried that he’d left entirely.
The relief in the room is palpable. After months of not seeing either of their youngest brothers, Harry, or Hermione, everyone’s attitude’s had been in a pitying state. Even Fred and George, usually always smiling, had been looking grimmer and grimmer each day.
“Shut up.” He says, cheeks warm. He grabs a Chocolate frog and pops it into his mouth, moaning at the taste.
“Then stop bloody acting like it!” Ron roars. “Sneaking into Knockturn at night, how fucking – bloody morons – don’t even tell a guy – gonna die at seventeen, this is it – have to put a bloody
And don’t get him wrong, he loves his mum, he loves Charlie, but when they’re worried about him they’re absolutely suffocating.
“I’m sorry mate.” Ron looks down at his feet. He misses his brother, but he knows that of all the ways they could’ve handled it all, they chose what was possibly the worst one, so he understands the anger. “I miss him, too.”
They all take seats in the waiting room, except for Fleur, who keeps pacing around worriedly, and normally Ron’d be annoyed that she’s making him even more nervous – because since when does she care about any of them anyway? – but he can’t think past the knot of anxiety and fear settled at the pit of his stomach.
He takes them outside, near the black lake, and tells them to spread around. Several seventh years are there, too, and Draco doesn’t understand why.
“It was a ministry Owl, wasn’t it?” Thomas says. “Do you think one of the professors has done something?”
still not enough, Draco’s going insane. He’s seen Lucius Malfoy on every single god damn trip to Hogsmeade he’s made since he got back, and he keeps on dreaming of some blonde woman teaching him Occlumency and he knows that’s insane – not to mention impossible, considering there’s
They go to Diagon Alley, and they’ve barely been there for a minute when Draco catches a flash of flawless dark skin.
“That’s none of your business!” He says. “You only found out because you were going to shag Blaise!”
. You want to know what will happen even if you find him Ron? You’ll be captured. You’ll be tortured.” Ron secretly thinks it’d be worth it, if it meant he got to see his brother again. “You will only make it worse for him. And there’s a chance… he’s not… he’s already…”
Every evening, he sits on his bed and toys with Malfoy’s Floo address, debating on what to do, trying to imagine what sort of life he might have if he calls him. He almost does, three times, before he stops lying to himself. It was a nice illusion, the one that Malfoy showed him, but that was all it was. He’ll never join him, no matter how angry he is at his family – and make no mistake, they
“Now, now, Draco, let’s not be hasty.” Smith practically purrs, taking a seat next to him. “There’s something we’ve to talk about.”
“Yes you are!” Ron’s never been this angry. “You’re skipping classes, you’re not eating, you’re picking bloody fights-”
“Oh, how silly of me, I forgot to introduce myself.” She says. “I’m Aida Thomas. I’m in the room next door.” She looks at Draco and then at Harry. “You know, you should have kids soon. You’re both very attractive, but neither of you are getting any younger!”
The locket, the diary, and the ring have been destroyed. The diadem, too. Hermione and Ron have gone to look for the Basilisk venom, and Harry wants to go with them. He
Draco nods. “I have to.” He stands, stumbles lightly since his legs are half-asleep. “I’ll see you at dinner, alright Harry?”
“Let go of me!” Draco snaps angrily, not even looking at Ron, and the red-head has to tighten his grip until Draco hisses painfully and looks at him. “Let go of me you pr-”
“He is,” Hermione says. At Harry’s raised eyebrow, she continues. “Do you know what the Order of the Phoenix is?”
“Before the first wizarding War, Lucius and I were happy. My sister Bellatrix married Rodolphus Lestrange, and he began to get mixed up with the Death Eaters. I thought… I thought it’d be fine, it’d be temporary, but it wasn’t.” Her lips purse unhappily. “Voldemort gained power, and your father only got more and more caught up in it. The first war broke out, and he became Voldemort’s right hand man.”
“Look, it’s fine.” Harry says, even if his voice indicates that it’s anything but. “We haven’t been going out for that long anyways, it’s not like you can’t-”
“You’re dismissed, Mr. Weasley,” McGonagall says curtly. Both Bill and Draco look at her, and she gestures to Draco. “The youngest. If you receive anything else, you come straight to me. Alright?”
“That’s a lie,” Draco says. “And you know it. As long as it’s here that – that boy – Voldemort, he can come back. He
Draco swallows. He doesn't respond, because he doesn't know what he'd say. He's terrified that it's true; that no matter what he's done or what he will do, he'll always be just a Death Eater's son. He's terrified that no matter what he does, that's where he'll end up.
“He’s a weak man, your father. I loved him with all my heart, but even then, I knew. He doesn’t lack magical power, no, but he does lack willpower, he lacks a spine.” She huffs angrily. “And then it was over, and he was sent to Azkaban. Even then, I loved him. After a few marital visits,” her cheeks darken slightly. “I got pregnant with you. And I still loved him, but darling, I love you more. I knew how you’d end up if I let him raise you. I knew the position he’d put you in. I couldn’t let that happen.”
I hope you all enjoyed taking this journey with me, and I love you all! Thank you for sticking with me through late updates, and writer's blocks, and unbeta'd chapters <3 I'm so happy we've made it to the end
him. Draco knows she’s conducting more research on the Malfoy’s, but every time he tries to talk to her about it she denies it and runs away. She’s included Blaise in her search, and Draco doesn’t know what they know but they’re both acting terribly odd.
Before he gets to the Great Hall, he catches sight of Draco, and they look at each other and make a detour; Harry can’t quite breathe, sitting in the middle of a half-destroyed staircase in what used to be his second childhood home and now is nothing more than war ground, but it’s better with Draco sitting with him, holding onto his hand.
“The Dark Lord is getting impatient.” Lucius Malfoy answers. The voices are getting closer, and soon Snape comes into view. He’s holding a small mirror, looking into it, and Draco can only guess Lucius Malfoy is in the other side. “He needs to kill Potter before he gets stronger.” Hermione makes a small noise, and Draco slaps a hand over her mouth. Snape’s head snaps towards them, and Draco holds his breath. “You’ve said he’s powerful, have you not?”
“Hey,” Harry nudges gently at Draco’s shoulder, slightly out of breath because he ran through the courtyard just to catch the blond on his way to class. He’s going to have to come up with a good excuse to tell Ron as to why he’s spending so much time with his little brother. As it is, Hermione’s already giving him constant knowing looks anytime he mentions or looks at Draco. “What’re you doing for Christmas?”
“You better have a good excuse for being out of bed.” Sprout says menacingly. She’s a sweetheart, but she’s scary when she’s angry.
The stag comes over and noses at Draco’s hand – Draco’s completely certain he’s redder than he’s ever been in his
Narcissa Black’s smile is terrifying. “When they do, I’ll be long gone. And they won’t be able to move.”
They turn their heads to the entrance of the dorm rooms. Ginny’s standing there, uniform still on, hands clenched at her sides.
And Draco can see Hermione, Blaise, Pansy, and Harry behind them and he hates them, too, every single one of them. Mostly, he hates himself for believing they were his friends, even for a second. Hates himself for believing anything could happen with Harry.
“Are you coming with us?” Ron asks awkwardly. He doesn’t seem to be entirely comfortable with Narcissa around; his hand is around Draco’s possessively.
“No,” Draco says. “Bill managed to drag them away to breakfast. He promised he’ll stretch it out as much as he can.”
Parkinson’s cheeks redden, and she looks away. Harry thinks she might look sad, but he can never tell with Slytherins.
Ron, Potter, and Granger are going into seventh year, but since he’s a year younger, he’s going into Sixth year, along with Ginny.
Harry’s breathing’s evened out, and when Draco looks at him, he realizes he’s already fallen asleep.
The owl pecks at Draco’s finger, so Draco takes the letter tied to its paw. It’s not his family’s owl, so he can’t imagine who it may be from.
“Yes, please.” He says anyway, heart aching, knowing it means more to him than it does to Harry. “The castle is suffocating me.”
Draco climbs one of the chairs – they’re considerably high off the ground – but he can’t reach it. He climbs the edge of the crib. It creaks and shudders.
“It was like a sort of… resistance. To Voldemort. Your parents were in it. Remus and Sirius, too.” She says. “So are Ron’s parents, McGonagall. Most all of the teachers. I heard them talking about it a few weeks ago, and it’s active again. It can only mean one thing.”
He passes Harry a steaming mug, and climbs onto bed beside him. Harry maneuvers his legs onto the bed again, and Draco closes the drapes with a charm.
Harry hums in agreement. He gets through potions without earning himself detention – though just barely, he almost throws his cauldron at Snape’s head – and then they go to lunch.
“Shut the bloody fuck up.” Ron snaps, as he begins to drag him away. He tries to calm himself, not the anger, but the vicious fear at seeing his brother’s face covered with blood and already littered with bruises that will likely just get worse in the next twelve hours.
The anger’s faded by now, mostly, but all that Draco’s left with is a sort of emptiness that’s expanded through his chest and the worst identity crisis he’s ever had. He’s not a Malfoy – he refuses to be – but he doesn’t feel much like a Weasley either, so he’s floating in a sort of limbo he
When Draco sees him again, he looks like shit – and that’s saying something, because Draco’d think he looks good covered in mud and with birds nesting on his head – and Draco tries to sound casual when he speaks.
They don’t talk about Draco, because as much as Ron loves Harry, it makes him a bit uncomfortable – and protective – to imagine him dating his baby brother. Though to be fair, it makes him a lot less uncomfortable than imagining anyone else with Draco. Really, he just doesn’t want to imagine anyone with neither Ginny nor Draco. They’re too young, still. They’re his younger siblings, and even though Ron realizes it’s not his place, he feels very protective of them.
Calling Malfoy is definitely the more dangerous – and possibly stupider – of the two options, but Draco’s never been great at not doing stupid things.
.” He snaps. He’s shaking. He hates her for saying that, more than he’s hated anything else in his life.
Harry isn’t stupid enough to think he can convince him otherwise. They sit together in the stairs, hands linked together, fingers intertwined.
“I was thinking about the whole Voldemort thing, and whatever, and do you think we could kill him like a muggle? He’s supposed to be powerful and everything, but if he doesn’t know about Muggle things we could just like – hit him in the head with one of those wooden things muggles use for balls? Or poison him? Imagine how embarrassing for him, the supposed ‘most powerful wizard’ of all Britain, dead because he slipped in the shower. Also, do you think his Death eaters have some sort of dress code or something? They’re always matching…” he trails off as he catches the way Harry’s looking at him. His whole demeanor has softened, relaxed, and he’s looking at Draco with something the blond can’t quite make out. “Are you sure you’re okay?”
“Don’t give him flowers.” He says. “Just – be calm, okay? Go on a date with him. Figure out if you like him. Figure out if he likes you. Talk about what you like, get to know him better. Try not to tell him you want to marry him and have babies with him.”
“I thought you meant organizing a historical figure birthday party!” Harry says. “I’ve always wanted kids!”
know, is that climate change is something very real that’s happening. The environment is collapsing, and the best thing we can do to help it is
The battle is quick, and it’s brutal. There are more bodies on the floor than Harry cares to count, and he has to step over them on his way to the Great Hall, where they’re gathering. Some of them are death eaters, yes, but others are Hogwarts students, or professors, or parents who came to fight with their children, and Harry can’t
Dobby apparates them into the Burrow. At the sharp crack, Ron’s entire family – even Bill and Fleur – emerges from the dining room – they’d been having supper – and, when they see them – and then a very familiar blond figure in Harry’s arms – they all begin talking at the same time. More than a few of them are sobbing.
“Harry, is everything-” Ginny begins, but Harry stops, refusing to tear his eyes away from Mrs. Thomas.
“Yeah, imagine. He spends every summer at your house anyway, you wouldn’t even have to go anywhere to shag-” Jae breaks off when he catches sight of something above them. “Is that an
“Fleur’s and Bill’s wedding, do you remember that?” Draco begins twisting his hands in his lap nervously, scratching at the skin until it goes red and raw. “Of course you do, it’s in a month and you’re invited and-”
“Is something wrong here, Smith?” Drawls a cool voice from the doorway, and both Draco and Zacharias turn to see Harry standing there.
Sprout’s frown deepens. “I assure you, Mr. Potter, I will think of something.” The look on her face softens. “Is there something you’d like me not to tell Mr. Weasley?”
He doesn’t know why they’re researching this, he’s half certain the professors are hiding something from him, and he knows Ron certainly is.
about it. Her mind seems to be rusty-geared, slow and screeching every time she comes close to thinking about what might’ve been happening to her brother while he was away from her.
“Even if you were.” Ron says, a sinking feeling to his stomach. “Even if – even if you’ve been a complete idiot and done something you can’t get out of right now – you’re
“I don’t really understand what they are,” he admits. “But I need to figure out how to use them against him.”
“Yes.” Pansy says. “Nothing they wanted to tell me, though, so I did my own research.” She takes out various books from the bag she’s carrying. They’re all about Pureblood Lineages and the Sacred Twenty-Eight. “We know about Lucius Malfoy, right?” She opens one of them to the Malfoy line, and then opens another one to the Black line. “His wife was named Narcissa.” She points at the name on the Black line. “She’s a Black, and her sisters are-”
Draco found the diadem nearly a week and a half ago, when he spoke with the grey lady – but after a week of endless experimenting, he still hasn’t gotten any closer to destroying it, so he’d called Ginny in.
“Is it?” Bellatrix’s hand twists in Draco’s hair painfully, and he flinches. Harry hears Ron struggle behind him, but he cannot look at anywhere but at Draco.
With a wave of her wand, she Accio’s over a thick wad of parchment pieces, and she gets on her knees on the floor and spreads it out. Ginny has to stop some from flying out the room. She hands them back to Hermione and closes the door.
“Like what you’re all doing is any better.” Zabini sneers. “At least we’re ashamed to lie to his face, you’ve all been doing it for weeks without a problem.”
The dungeons are entirely bare, and he Luna and Draco have been kept here, he thinks they must’ve been sleeping on the floor. The torches on the walls are dimly lit.
to, and his attempts are clumsy and half-arsed at best. Snape flickers through his memories easily, and Harry whips back when he finds one of Draco.
“You fucking better.” Draco says. “I’ll take it as a personal offence if you doubt my ability as a researcher.”
Greyback is standing by the windows – whether to pressure him or to watch him he doesn’t know – and there’s a house elf standing by the door nervously, ears twitching.
She looks around carefully, and Draco can see two wizards whispering quickly. She purses her lips and stands up, so Draco does, too. She throws several bills on the table and walks quickly out of the café. The two wizards follow them.
“You’d mind, Harry.” Fred says brightly. “The brat sleep-talks. And sleep-walks. And moves around. He can share with Georgie.”
Draco smiles lightly. “I know. I was going to say that if your parents are up to something and you need a place to go, you’re always welcome at the burrow, even if you have to sleep on the floor.”
“I’ll have Mr. Black test it.” McGonagall says. Thanks to Sirius’s long time living with dark objects, he’s good at identifying and testing them, so he occasionally does McGonagall – or other people he respects – these kinds of favors.
“I think you forget I shop-lift. And this hospital doesn’t have very good security, honestly, I expected more of a challenge.” Pansy says, and she sounds disappointed by it. Shoplifting’s not a very good habit of hers, even if she’s very good at it. Draco’s almost certain it’s entirely to piss off her parents. The Parkinson’s are swimming in money, they could buy her anything she wanted. For her to steal it is insulting. “Anyway, they show that she was admitted to the hospital on June Fifth 1982.” A weird look crosses her face, and she looks at Draco. “The day of your birthday, actually. They say she gave birth to a baby boy…”
“He woke up a few hours ago.” He says. “But his head hurt. The healers didn’t manage to take all of the pain away, but enough for him to fall asleep.”
“I don’t know.” Draco says. “She made me leave before she did, but she must’ve. Unless the Aurors took it.”
“It’s just – Harry doesn’t want anyone to know about this, and Ron doesn’t want to involve you, so.” She waves a hand, blushing.
“Listen to me, Draco, please.” Harry says. Draco looks away, and his cheeks redden in anger, and his forehead tightens in a frown, but he listens. “
Draco smiles at her. His siblings don’t like her much, but to be honest, he’s always been rather fond of her. She’s cultured and a rather very powerful witch. She spent the whole of the first summer they met each other teaching him various spells.
Harry nods, even though he doesn’t; he didn’t really research anything, either, and is now feeling a little intimidated, looking at Draco with a full binder as though he’d prepared for this all his life.
She doesn’t like the sound of that, but there are too many things to do, too many worries and too much relief to really worry about it.
The room’s lights immediately dim, and a bed appears a few feet to their right. It’s big and comfortable-looking, with big pillows and a warm-looking red blanket.
“Hard to say. They’re still good friends, so sometimes they stay there and just talk, even if they don’t do anything.” Zabini says. They all stay quiet, and he listens carefully.
While Harry goes to visit Dumbledore, Draco grabs the vial of Basilisk Venom from his robe pocket and goes back to the room of hidden things. He sits in an old desk with the diadem, the vial, and his wand, trying to figure out the best way to do it. He needs to figure it out that day, because tomorrow they’re leaving for the Burrow for the Winter Hols, and he doesn’t want to take a Horocrux with him.
“Don’t do that again.” He whispers. “Disappear again, not letting me know if you’re alright. I can’t take it.”
“If you come with me,” Malfoy says. “If you help us – we can give you everything. No more lies. You’re not a child, you’re not dumb. You can make your own decisions.”
Pansy eyes him warily and then looks back at the letter. She finishes reading it and passes it to Blaise, who reads it quickly.
“Bellatrix Lestrange. Fernir Greyback, Antonin Dolohov, Rodolphus Lestrange, Evan Rosier, Walden McNair.” He seems to hesitate. “Lucius Malfoy. These are all the escaped Death Eaters. I want you to look at them, and I want you to remember them. If you see
Potter scrambles for his glasses, and several noises come from the other beds, apparently awoken by Draco’s screaming.
“Yeah, sounds about right,” Harry says; he’d scared several hospital patients looking for Draco, and he really hopes they won’t throw them out for it.
“This is ridiculous!” Snape doesn’t raise his voice, but it’s evident he’s seething. “The Dark Lord cannot come to Hogwarts.”
They’ve already floo’d McGonagall at Hogwarts so she can tell Ginny that both Draco and Luna are here, because she’s been worried sick about the both of them for months.
Sirius and Remus are staring at him like they’ve seen a ghost, and Teddy is looking anywhere but at him.
Draco feels his cheeks heat, and his stomach flutters. He could honestly hit himself with how pathetic he’s being.
Draco’d figured as much, if he’s honest. She’d asked him instead of them, so it hadn’t taken a lot of thinking to figure out that was the reason.
“Look! Look at it! It’s nothing! It’s a diadem!” Draco shoves the diadem at them, and McGonagall takes it cautiously.
“Miss Lovegood, that’s amazing!” he hears Lupin say, and when he turns he sees a hare hopping around happily.
“Zacharias Smith.” The Hufflepuff introduces himself, even though Draco already knows exactly who he is.
Ginny glares, but it’s softer than it was before. “Yes, you should’ve.” She rounds on Harry. “And you! How could you not have told us?” then she looks hurt. “Why didn’t Draco tell me?”
“Why are we doing this, again?” he asks. It’s almost three in the morning, and he’s sprawled on his front with several books open in front of him.
Narcissa Malfoy touches one of the magpies on the wall, and it shudders to life. It flies around the room a few times, before dropping a painted silver ring right onto Narcissa’s hand. It becomes real when it touches her hand, glinting in the setting sunlight.
They get to the Green House – where they’ve been meeting Sprout for detention every day – and she gives Jae, Noah, and Adam a huge back of tree seeds and sends them on their way.
Mrs. Thomas shakes her head, “I don’t want to blow up either! But it’s one million galleons! Wouldn’t you do it, for your children?”
Draco pulls him close again, and, together, they walk towards the Gryffindor Dorm. Harry tightens his hold on Draco’s hip and kisses his hair, trying to calm the dread pooling in his chest.
A sharp pang of pain shoots through Draco’s head, just like it did those few first days at the hospital, whenever he tried to remember what happened while he was missing. It’s so intense he has to stop walking for a moment, needs to catch his breath. He hears the sound of the candy he bought clattering on the floor.
“Okay,” Pansy says, still in that very calm tone of voice that is honestly giving Draco the creeps. “But she’s read it then?”
“Wait, wait,” he says. “I forgot – I have an essay due tomorrow – it’s thirty inches – I haven’t even started-”
“I’m a Weasley. We eat.” He says, because it’s the only thing he can say. He stands up. “And you’re not real.”
Draco has half a mind to tell Ron where to shove it, but he merely clenches his jaw and grips his wand tighter.
“Why would they send an Owl though, and not arrest them?” Jae asks. “No, it must be some kind of warning.”
“What’s wrong?” he asks immediately, grabbing Draco’s face to make sure everything’s alright. He’s grinning wildly though, grey eyes shining, and Harry relaxes a bit.
“Loo?” Draco asks disbelievingly. “Don’t you think they’ll begin to wonder after you’ve been in the ‘loo’ for three hours?”
“A few of them – two or three, if you want – I want them to search for the Cup, the Diadem, and the Locket. If they were the founders’ they might still be here.” McGonagall says. “I’ll track down any remaining family members and talk to them.”
“There are a few things you need to know.” She says. “About who you are, and where you come from. More importantly, about why I left you.”
“Smith wouldn’t leave me alone.” He says. His jaw tightens and he upturns his nose, something he does when he’s daring Ron to tell him he’s done the wrong thing. “She told me to take care of myself. Breaking Smith’s nose is as close as I can get to that.”
“I know, love,” Harry tells him. He looks at Dolohov lying on the bed, and then back at Draco. “We caught him.”
“No!” Harry says quickly. Draco’s face lights up again, and it takes everything in him not to grab him and cuddle him against his chest and never let him go. He’s looking at Harry with his eyes all huge and Harry groans inwardly because
“Are you okay?” Potter asks, a small frown between his brows. Draco wants to soothe it away with his thumb.
Draco’s thrown on his knees in front of Harry, and Harry has half a mind to kill Bellatrix Lestrange for it and half to pull Draco into a hug because he’s
“Err, fine.” Harry says uncertainly. Then he addresses Draco. “I wanted to see how you were doing. We.
“If the aurors have reason to believe that they would try to come to Hogwarts the children have a right to know.” Professor Lupin says. Draco respects him a lot, and he’s the best defense against the dark arts teacher he’s had, so he’s glad he stayed even after Snape told everyone he was a werewolf.
His hands tangle in Harry’s hair to drag him closer, and instead, Harry pulls away, panting lightly.
him, you know? Like I’m seeing everything he is. I see the death eaters. Pettigrew, too, and I’ve never seen him.”
The room is big, with nice, big windows that have been obscured by a spell and shelf upon shelf full of books. It’s a library, Draco realizes with a thrill. The thought is strangely comforting.
spiders, but he doesn’t have the luxury to let that stop him – and, though regal and stiff, everything seems to… fit.
“Well, even if he’s the last Malfoy, it makes no sense that this is from him.” Blaise says. “He’s one of those prissy purebloods, he’s
calmly. “You are going to tell us why you have this when you supposedly turned it in to McGonagall.”
When the door closes, McGonagall speaks. “Professor Lupin, Professor Snape, Professor Flitwick, Madam Pomfrey, if you’d all ask around the Gryffindor students to see if anyone saw anything, please.”
“Harry Potter, yes.” Dumbledore says. Harry doesn’t like that he interrupted McGonagall, but he tries to keep an open mind. “Sit, my boy.”
“Alright,” Hermione says, dragging out the word. “Well, we’re here because word is whoever attacked Dolohov is coming here to finish the job on Riddle’s orders, so McGonagall wanted us to back you up.”
They’ve slipped into an easy sort of banter that Draco enjoys. He almost thinks it’s flirting sometimes, right before he shakes his head and chides himself for being dumb enough to think Harry would be interested in him.
he thinks. Certain that he’s not going to fall to his death soon, he stands, and walks around the small cell twice again, feet dragging on the stone floor.
When the announcement happens – Voldemort, telling Harry to give himself up – it's Draco who breaks the silence.
Harry wakes up with his heart hammering against his chest, and his hand immediately goes to the space beside him, frantically searching for Draco, unknowing of the reason why. He doesn’t remember anything from the dream, apart from small, vague images of it.
It doesn’t. Draco doesn’t care if Lucius Malfoy is his father. He didn’t raise him, he didn’t feed him when he was hungry. He didn’t do a damned thing for Draco, and Draco will gladly return the favor.
They’re dragged upstairs again – Draco’s half-unconscious on the floor, but he blinks blearily when he sees them.
He’s suddenly hit by just how long he’s liked Potter, and just how unlikely it is to happen. Potter’s known him since he was ten, probably still thinks of him as a child, as family. He’d never be interested in Draco.
- and the Ministry is doing nothing about it. “She’s teaching the most ridiculous, unbelievably tame and censored Defense Against the Dark Magic course I've taken in my
She sends over pages of research, and before Scorpius has had time to go through it all, Rose has done some of her own.
“Yes, I expected so.” He says. “Okay. I need you to give me all your attention for five minutes, alright?”
Harry admits that he’s probably been too caught up in Draco and not focusing enough on what’s been going on around him, but he can’t help himself. Draco’s irresistible, with his soft hair, softer lips, his terribly biteable neck and his exquisite arse…
“Ginny-” their father begins, but then he cuts himself off with a sigh. “Molly, we were going to have to tell them sooner or later. We knew that all along.”
Luna, Ron, and him are also pulled into hugs, and kisses, and a flurry of ‘how are you’, ‘are you hurt’, ‘is everything alright’.
“Rest, my darling,” she whispers. “You’ve done so much. It’s okay now. I’ll take care of it.” Ron’s hand tightens around Draco’s. “Dobby told me you figured it out. I knew you would. You’re so smart, darling. I love you so much.”
And now, with everything that’s been happening – since Draco disappeared from Hogsmeade and the rumor spread that it had been Death Eaters, people won’t come out of their house. Muggle attacks and wizard disappearances increased dramatically, and the Ministry’s not doing anything about it but denying it, and Harry’s nightmares, or visions, or whatever it is they are, have only been getting worse – he can’t seem to find the right moment to say anything like ‘
“I, uh.” He hears Ginny snickering beside him, and he elbows her in the ribs, making her yelp. “What are we eating?”
“Mr. Williams! Mr. Franco! Mr. Caron! Mr. Lee!” She stops then, so Draco looks back to where the three Gryffindors were standing, only to find the space empty. He looks around.
“Right,” Draco says, business-like, straightening and joining his hands behind his back. “We’ll start now. I’ll be taking the negative, you’ll be taking the positive. Do you have your opening statement?”
“What’s your name?” He asks. The house elf is the only constant. They leave him standing by the door of whatever room Draco’s searching, as if to watch him. Draco doesn’t know what good it is.
“Ginevra knew since the beginning of the year!” Malfoy snaps impatiently. “She said so in the hospital, while you were asleep.” Malfoy stretches his hands in a ‘look around you’ gesture as he waves his wand. Hogsmeade changes around him, and he finds himself in Malfoy Manor, a horribly familiar blonde woman that Draco can’t place petting his hair and kissing his forehead, Lucius Malfoy beside her with a smile on his face. “With us, Draco, you can have
“Alright,” Draco says softly. He turns on their bed, facing Harry, and presses a slow kiss to his lips. “Everything’s alright.”
“Have you heard?” The witch behind them in the line asks the wizard she’s with. “They say You-Know-Who might be back.”
He opens the door and lets Draco through first, and they walk to dinner together, Draco’s heart still beating in his throat. He wants to say something, has half a heart to tell Potter he’s in love with him, can’t hold it inside himself any longer, but abruptly he remembers the letter in his pocket.
Thank you for reading!! I changed my usual :) to :D bc I felt that :) seemed too sarcastic, soooo :DD
“When you two are done you can join us for breakfast.” Their mom calls out as she leaves the kitchen.
“I don’t know how you missed it!” Draco says. “Even Hermione noticed! Who, by the way, you’re never going to date unless you get your head out of your arse and ask her out.”
Ginny’s looking for him, too, and she catches his eye. She gives him what he supposes was supposed to be a relaxed smile, but it comes out more troubled and worried than she meant it to. He smiles back weakly.
“Okay,” Remus cuts off warily, because Harry’s like his son, and he’s seventeen! The thought of him being married scares the shit out of Remus. “It depends. Is he the kind to like public gestures?”
A beat of silence, and Draco gets the feeling Potter doesn’t want to talk about this any longer, so he changes the subject.
“I baked like seven treacle tarts over the summer.” Draco says. “I think he thinks I like baking now. It was embarrassing.”
Draco wants to ask more questions, but he knows better. Granger’s helped him no questions asked several times, and it’s only fair that he does the same.
He doesn’t respond. He doesn’t know when that is; he doesn’t think he’s ever seen her before in his life, though she does seem awfully familiar.
“Good,” She brushes a bit of her hair back. Her dark skin’s glowing with the light that streams in through the kitchen window, and she’s wearing a dark yellow sundress that suits her nicely. “Are you excited for your sixth year?”
“No.” Hermione says disgruntled. “The charm failed, and it didn’t notify me when he changed locations. However, I think it might still be active.”
“All we’re saying is you like him, and he likes you, so you could go for it!” Pansy says. Before Draco can argue, she continues. “Anyway that’s not the most pressing matter right now. I was waiting for them to leave to tell you guys this. I asked my parents about the Malfoys.”
friends!” Harry says, frustrated. “I just – I thought we could be something more. But it’s fine, okay? If you don’t want to-”
The wizards – Draco suspects they’re Spanish Aurors – yell something after them, but Narcissa merely quickens her pace.
Medically though, the headaches – blinding, with how much they hurt, rendering him incapable of doing anything, even speaking – are mostly gone; they’re only back whenever he tries to think about the past three days, of which he remembers nothing of.
Draco huffs and rolls his eyes. They step out to the dining room, and Draco’s momentarily frozen by the sight of Harry fucking Potter – Ron’s best friend, savior of the wizarding world as a one year old, and Draco’s crush for longer than he’ll ever admit to anyone – sitting at the table.
Even if Draco doesn’t answer, Ron can see it clear as day across his face; shame and fear both, more terrified of what Ron would think of him than what Smith could do.
!” And it’s an unforgivable, of course, what comes out of his mouth. He watches  Greyback  howl, writhe in pain, and, all of a sudden, he’s hit by the desperate
“Draco mentioned horcruxes.” Harry manages to get a tighter grip on Draco’s legs so that he won’t slip now that he’s practically dead weight. “What did he mean?”
“Maybe,” He says. “It feels like they don’t trust me, though. Or like they think I’m too – I don’t know. Young. Dumb, maybe. To know whatever it is that’s bothering them.”
“You know I can’t do that.” Harry shakes his head. “Come on. You’ll get to meet this cute grandkid of yours. You’ll see Sophie again. You’ll be there to love them, the both of them!”
That means that, like every other summer Potter’s spent here, he’ll be sleeping in Ron and Draco’s room, in Draco’s bed, which means Draco’s sharing with someone. Usually, he’d just sleep in Ginny’s room, but Hermione’s sleeping in her room, which means there’s no space for him there.
“Mum told us while we were in the hospital.” He says. “Apparently – his birth father is Lucius Malfoy.”
“Hermione, can’t you work any faster?” He asks desperately. They’ve been in ere only for a few minutes, but he's more than ready to leave.
“Mom,” Bill cuts her off gently. They all turn towards the door, where Fleur and him are standing. Ron hadn’t noticed they’d come back. “You and dad go eat something, okay? Draco probably won’t wake for another few hours. Fleur and I will stay here.”
He assumes Ron and Ginny told their parents, because Draco gets dozens of letters from them and all of his siblings. He puts them in a pile under his mattress to read when he’s feeling better.
Draco’s taken from his arms – Harry doesn’t let go of Draco’s ankle, because he’s not quite ready to – by Molly, who Harry didn’t expect to have the strength to carry Draco.
“You’re not.” Harry dries his tears with his thumb soothingly, and he pulls Draco close and presses his lips to his hair. “Merlin, Draco, of course you’re not. I love you, alright? Remember that. I’ll do everything I can to get back to you.”
“Aurors have been following their trail, and they expect to find them soon. However, they’ve reason to believe that they might be headed here.” A murmur runs through the great hall, and, instinctively, Draco looks over to the Gryffindor table.
“Err,” Harry says. His cheeks darken under his tanned skin. “If you’re up for it, we could continue working on your Patronus when you come back.”
“Your father thinks I’m dead.” She continues. “The Dark Lord – he has Horocruxes. I found three – a diary, a ring, and a locket. Regulus helped me, and he left a list of the rest of them. They’re in what was going to be your nursery.”
“Thank you,” Draco says politely as Ditzy the house-elf gives him a bowl of mint-chocolate ice cream. She bows lightly and beams at him before leaving, and they move to Draco’s dorm in the Hufflepuff dorms for more privacy.
“Well, I don’t,” Draco says. His face abruptly brightens, and he gasps. “You know what we should do?”
“Not properly.” Hermione waves it away. “We don’t really ask each other much after what happened in third year-”
“And he died.” Pansy finishes, closing all the books and the files with a flick of her wand. She puts them all in her bag again.
Scorpius doesn’t want to be like them because of that; he doesn’t care about the secrets, he doesn’t care about the power and the whirlwind of romance and greatness, he wants to be like them because they were honorable, because they were
He’d talked in his sleep all the time, half delirious; muttering about magpies and various words in what Ron thinks ought to be Spanish, even mentioned Harry’s name once or twice.
, that isn’t as far and untouchable as Harry is. Someone he doesn’t love as deeply and completely as he does him. Someone he could walk away from, if he needed to.
That catches Draco completely off guard. He’s getting more and more confused with every word Harry says.
She comes closer, and Draco can’t bring himself to move. She’s wearing black robes and a black hooded cloak, and when she pulls back the hood she’s blonde and looking at him with tear-filled, icy blue eyes.
in case this is a bit confusing, Draco's been avoiding Harry for about a week or two, so they haven't talked about the love confession.
“I know.” He says softly. “I’m fine. It’s all fine. There are more important things to do right now.”
Draco opens his mouth but doesn’t find anything to say to that. After a moment, anger, hot and bright, swells inside him at the memory of Harry and Blaise with their shirts half unbuttoned.
“I know,” her smile is sad. “I know they are. And don’t let anyone tell you they’re not; your father, the death eaters,
Harry kisses his knuckles one last time and then lets their joined hands drop between them, squeezing rhythmically.
“We’re proud of you,” Harry tells him, and then Scorpius is alive, again, and there’s Hogwarts and Headmistress McGonagall and Teddy throws him his wand and Voldemort is dead, once and for all.
Ron listens to Potterwatch every day to make sure his baby brother’s name is kept on the ‘missing’ list and not on the ‘dead’ one. He knows he was the one who said not to bring Draco, but this is… not the alternative he imagined.
Before he knows what’s happening, Draco has his wand in his hand and is looking around warily, just in time to see dozens of death eaters beginning to shout out spells in flashes of green.
“I’m working as fast as I can, Harry!” She snaps, but begins muttering faster. Suddenly, the moans stop.
Pansy’s eyes are teary, but Draco doesn’t mention it because he doesn’t fancy getting kicked in the balls.
Even the name makes his heart pound faster and his throat close up. He’s not going to be scared of Smith, no matter what he’s done to him; he refuses to be.
Hermione scoffs. “Yes, and when have we ever listened to people when they tell us to stay out of something?”
“Of course I know!” Draco says, embarrassed, even though he doesn’t. His parents never really talked to them about sex. Bill tried to, once, Draco pretty much plugged his ears and ran away.
And what about his siblings? Do they know? Bill and Charlie must know, they were old enough to remember that their mum was never pregnant after Ginny, but everyone else? Do they love him less for it, think him different?
“Alright,” Harry says, clearly relieved. He looks at Draco hesitantly. “But… we can keep doing this, right now? Snogging, I mean.”
“Is it? Zabini and Parkinson have been avoiding you? Your sister,” his lips curl around a sneer at the word. “Who you thought loved you found out and now she’s disgusted by you. And you want to know why they didn’t tell you?” Draco stops throwing hexes, only because the pounding in his head is getting too strong to think through. “Because they’re not your family. The only reason they adopted you was because they thought you were going to be a death eater. They didn’t want you, the ministry forced them to take you.”
Draco shakes his head. “Everything I’ve tried has been a pathetic attempt at destroying it. I’d – I found a dealer in Knockturn and Gin and I got some rare stuff from him for the diadem, but nothing’s worked yet.”
There’s a pause, and Draco looks around the candlelit room, Crups – he’s always wanted one, but his parents never had enough money – lying at his feet, everything he could ever want around him.
“They dismissed the feast so we could be safe and you thought it smart to sneak out because you were
Draco snorts. “It wouldn’t do any good. The Aurors already have a copy, and McGonagall would have my arse for keeping it. My parents before her.”
“If he makes you happy, let him know so.” Remus continues. “Stay around him. If you find out you like him as much as you think you do, then you ask him in another date. If you find that he makes you happier as a friend, well you know what you want.”
Zabini shakes his head. “No way. It hasn’t been anywhere near long enough. Either Theo or Draco must’ve changed their minds.”
Pansy and Draco turn to the door, horrified, to see Harry, Hermione, and Ron standing by the doorway. Hermione looks amused, Ron looks horrified, and Potter’s scratching at the back of his neck awkwardly, cheeks red.
“No one’s excited for school, ‘Mione.” Potter groans beside him, and Draco wishes to all gods his face wouldn’t get so red every single time Potter opens his mouth. By now, he wouldn’t be surprised if Potter thought pink was his actual skin tone.
Luna has a black eye, and her clothes are dirtied and bloody. She doesn’t look much better than Draco did, but she sounds mild. Serene, even. Ron wonders how the hell she’s keeping calm in this situation.
Dementors, mainly because of how they make him feel, and one of the reasons he wants so badly to succeed at casting the Patronus charm is so that he never has to be with one again.
He raises his wand, and a silvery stag trots out from it. Draco stares in awe. Not only is it beautiful, but it’s utterly
If he could guarantee his family’s safety – and Harry’s, and Hermione’s, and all of his friends’ - he’d leave in a heartbeat. He wonders if that makes him selfish, if it means something’s changed in him and he’s not a selfless Hufflepuff. That he’d leave England burning, if no one he cared about was in it.
“Because I’m fucking terrified!” Draco half-yells. Harry stays quiet, and Draco swallows looking away. “I don’t - I don’t remember my mother. And my father was terrible. You’ve seen – you
“It was you!” he says. “I’ve been getting Puffskeins for my birthday every year since I was a child!”
doesn’t like the idea of Draco with Nott. Or anyone else that isn’t Harry himself, for that matter. “What?”
Harry. Everything they are, their parent teaches them. Even – even if we just tried to do our best, even if we tried not to mess them up - I'm not sure we could. I don’t think
my husband sometimes, but we all have our rough patches.” Harry’s pretty sure one isn’t supposed to want to murder their spouse, but he’s not going to contradict her in the middle of her rant. “After that you sort of get used to hating them, so it gets better! Are you two-”
The be back in Hogwarts, is, in a certain sense, a relief. When he enters the common room, Hermione and Harry look up.
he’s looking for – or he tells them he’s searched everywhere and not found anything he thinks is out of place. They usually
Harry looks at him through heavy-lidded eyes and clears his throat, letting go of Draco’s waist for a moment to push his glasses up his nose, even though they’re fogged up.
He’s never kissed anyone like this before. He’s never really kissed anyone, other than Theo, and those were chaste kisses at best.
And Harry looks at them and he realizes that no matter what happens – if he’s a Horocrux, if he’s not,
He asked Ginny about it and she sort of waved it away nervously, which makes Draco almost certain that she knows what it is, and he doesn’t understand why they’re not telling him. Ginny’s never hidden anything from him before.
Either he tells McGonagall and turns in the Floo address, or he calls Malfoy and pretends to join him so he can find out what they’re up to. The letters haven’t come for a few weeks now, so Draco assumes that whoever it was either got caught or was suspected, and so they stopped.
“And I’ve wondered so many times if I made the right choice, and I know I did.” She says. “It hurts me so much, but I know I did. The Weasleys, they
“You are.” Harry says. Draco’d mentioned it in passing, waving it away before Harry could comment on it, but he could tell it made him sadder than he let on. “You both are. He told me.”
his brother, blood or not – and he knows he’d feel lied to. And he doesn’t want him to think, even for a moment, that this could change their opinion of him, or that they don't love him.
Turns out all sixth years are being taught the charm at the same time, so he sticks close to his sister, Luna, Pansy, and Blaise.
did you learn how to do it, again?” Harry asks, because he’s almost certain it was more than a little illegal.
He does, but again, he doesn’t respond. She gives him a curious look, like she can’t quite figure him out, and he looks away quickly.
“I need to go back to my dorm.” He says reluctantly. “Sprout will murder me if she realizes I’m not there.”
He locks himself in the seventh floor bathrooms – the most discreet place he could think of – and takes Lucius Malfoy’s letter out of his pocket.
Various days pass without anyone coming to visit him; the first few days the hunger sent pangs of pain along his whole body, but eventually the pain seemed to calm down. No one’s come to visit him, and Draco’s half-convinced that the death eaters have no intention of using him, only buried him alive, when a door opens.
“Quit moping.” Rose nudges him when she sees him in the hall; she’s a year older, and if Scorpius isn’t at home he can always be found at the Weasleys’, in Rose’s room, probably in some sort of contest of
They always take a vote, and if the majority says yes, the person who said no accompanies them anyway. It’s teamwork.
“In my Occlumency lessons with Snape,” Harry continues. “I saw him speaking to Malfoy, in his cell, in Azkaban, just before school started, I think. They were talking about you.”
“You need to remember.” She tells him. “One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy.”
He knows it’s necessary, by now. He’s accepted that it has to happen. The months he spent alone with Ron and Hermione in the woods, half convinced Draco was dead, he’d been resigned to dying. Yearned for it, even, felt as though it could finally give him peace. Here, sitting next to Draco, he never wants to have to go.
work.” Blaise nods approvingly. “I mean, Potter’s bi, right? He’s got eyes, and your arse is spectacular. Flaunt it. Maybe bend over.”
They place a mild disillusionment charm on each other, and then sneak out, making their way into Knockturn.
know.” She says. “It’s the reason for all of this, the letter from Malfoy, why he disappeared, we’ve been wondering why, and you’ve known all along!”
Everything hurts and Draco can feel blood run down his temple and from his chin. He groans and pushes himself up, stumbling out of the way as several people rush by. This isn’t like Hogsmeade, this is full of people rushing by, and as he looks around, he realizes he doesn’t recognize where he is.
Potter sighs. “I want to. I definitely should, and I know that. It’s just… if no one knows, it’s just a nightmare, yeah? But if I tell them and they’re something real, it means Voldemort’s back and I don’t-” he exhales harshly. “It was supposed to be over.”
Draco sighs quietly. Out of the corner of his eye he can see Pansy and Blaise looking at him, but Draco upturns his nose and ignores them, shoulders tense.
The light from the spell Nott casts is blinding, but Parkinson is the most impressive dueler Scorpius has seen in his life, because she counters it wordlessly; it’s quick, it’s bright, and it’s brutal, and when it’s over, a body hits the floor.
“Let go of me!” Draco snaps, heart hammering against his ribs. “Get the fuck off me you moronic fuck-”
Potter and Granger are with him, and they usher him and his friends out of the cramped portrait hole.
They’ve their own place since they opened Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, but they always come back home for the summer. It makes Draco happier than he’d care to admit; he likes his brothers, even if they make his life impossible for sport.
The man has white, long hair, and a matching beard. He has twinkling eyes, and he’s sitting in a small couch with a steaming mug.
It feels odd to talk about his birth mother like that, like someone who existed. Someone who, logically, would’ve been a huge part in Draco’s life, and now isn’t a part at all.
“You can find the ones in the manor. You need to.” She says over the nose. “You’re the only one who can figure it out, Draco.”
Her face is hard, and Draco somehow knows, this is not a woman that can be messed with. She reminds him of Ginny, and Pansy, and Hermione; fierce, decisive, deadly when they have to be.
knew about this but you. Every single person you trusted hid this from you because they think you’re a stupid child. They don’t think you can make your own decisions.”
“Hi, honey.” Molly kisses his cheek as she steps into the kitchen, stepping forward to kiss Ginny’s cheek too, completely unfazed by the scene in front of her. “No cursing each other before breakfast, you know that.”
Draco’s cheeks are burning, but he nods quickly, and really, it’s the best choice he’s made in his entire life.
“I haven’t.” He says. He wouldn’t forgive himself if his family died, and he wasn’t here. Wouldn’t forgive himself even if he
“Hey, brat!” Fred calls. Draco looks at him. He hadn’t noticed, but apparently his parents are done shopping and they’re heading to the next place. “We’re leaving! Come on!”
a lot of what happened during my childhood, and you don’t know all of it, you never could because I could never explain it. Kids are – they're
“No, you shouldn’t have.” Draco agrees. Everyone waits in silence, and he sighs. “I do forgive you. I’ll murder all of you, though, if you hide something like that from me again. I won’t stand it.”
“How?” Harry asks excitedly. “Because I thought we could just – wait a while, you know? Maybe you’ll feel differently, or – or maybe I will, and-”
“He’s our friend.” Zabini says, disgusted curl to his mouth. “We’d never lie to him like that. They always end up in Theo’s bed after a Quidditch match. We just have to wait for it to be over.”
Draco’s stomach sinks, and Luna’s hand squeezes his hard. Draco lets go of her, because they know – from experience – that if they come get one of them and they won’t let go of each other, they’ll just torture them both.
“They’re my family.” He says. His throat hurts, and his eyes prickle, but he won’t cry, not for this. The Weasleys; Ron, Ginny, Fred and George – they’re his
Professor Quirrell tries to kill Scorpius by the end of the year, and somehow, that’s not the biggest one of his professor problems. His biggest problem is that Professor Zabini, the Potions Master and the head of Slytherin, absolutely
“But you won’t get to meet Sophie’s baby!” Harry tells her. “They won’t remember you, you’ll just be that one grandma that blew herself up!”
His siblings and his mother stare at them suspiciously. Fleur and Ginny seem terribly amused, though at least Fleur is trying to hide her laughter behind her hand.
“Whoa!” Harry catches him by the waist, hugs him tightly. “It’s alright. It’s alright, I’m alright, I’m fine.”
“Chocolate?” Lupin offers. He’s given Draco some before – often while they were practicing the Patronus Charm, since the dementors made Draco feel like utter shit – and Draco’s mouth waters, but he shakes his head wordlessly.
“What’re we talking about?” Pansy asks, popping her gum as she appears out of nowhere. She’s wearing fishnets, heavily ripped muggle denim – she’s gotten into wearing and watching muggle things just to piss her parents off – and a crop top from a muggle band that Draco doesn’t recognize.
“Of course not, ‘Mione.” Ron soothes, and Ginny and Draco smirk at each other. His crush on Hermione is painfully obvious, and for all the brains Hermione has, Draco doesn’t think she knows. “He’s my baby brother though, I’m allowed to tease him.”
Scorpius has never really known how to do what’s best for his own good; he’s told he gets that from his father.
“I convinced the elves to sneak me some before breakfast.” Draco says, smiling and perching himself onto the space between Harry’s legs, placing his legs over Harry’s and wrapping them around his hips so they’re face to face. “I thought you’d like some. You’ve been sleeping less and less lately.” He looks at him sternly. “Even if you’ve been trying to lie to me.”
The three of them are squeezed into Blaise’s bed. His dormmates had been in the room, so Draco’d grabbed him and Pansy and shoved them in, closing the drapes tightly with several sticking charms and at least four
He looks like he hasn’t slept very well, and Draco mentally slaps himself for not thinking that death eaters escaping might be taking a toll on Potter.
Draco needs her to slow down a bit, to stop shoving information down his throat. He needs a bit of time to process, to think about this and figure out what he thinks about it.
He only manages to see a silhouette before he’s grabbed by the arm and dragged to his feet. He immediately begins to struggle, and the grip tightens, claws digging into the skin of his arm, drawing blood.
They continue to talk in quieter voices, and Thomas nudges him forward so they can get closer and hear better, so Draco takes a step. The stone under his feet is rough and uneven, and Draco gasps as he stumbles. He nearly crashes through the portrait they’re listening through, but a hand grabs at the back of shirt, managing to stop him when his nose is half an inch from the portrait.
“Going home.” Draco gives him an amused look. They keep walking, though a lot slower than Draco was originally going. “It’s Bill and Fleur’s wedding, remember?” his face falls. “Are you not coming anymore?”
He writes home to Teddy, Sirius, and Remus; he knows Teddy wanted him to be sorted into Hufflepuff, and though Sirius and Remus pretend not to care, they wanted him to be in Gryffindor; after all, his father was, too.
Potter continues going around to look and occasionally help certain students, and he turns to his right when he sees a familiar figure snickering.
He takes Harry’s hand, and Harry leads him to the dance floor. Once there, he grabs Draco’s waist and pulls him closer, and Draco wraps his arms around Harry’s neck, resting his cheek against his chest, Harry’s chin on the top of his head. They sway from side to side gently, not at all to the beat of the song, but Harry’s hands are on him and Draco can hear his heartbeat and nothing else matters for a moment.
“I think that was the first time I really realized how much I liked you.” Potter says abruptly, and Draco’s heart stutters.
Draco huffs, but topples off Harry’s lap, sitting next to him on the grass. Harry thoroughly enjoys the debouched look on him: the red cheeks, the messy, moussed hair, tie undone and a lovely bruise just in the underside of his jaw – though that was done in private – and Harry probably shouldn’t be as smug as he is that he’s the reason for the blonde’s untidy look.
“He said yes!” Harry says, turning to him excitedly. Remus is glad to see him acting like this. With everything that’s been going on, Harry’s been quieter and quieter, and Remus wants him to be happy. He deserves it. Even if it’s the Malfoy kid.
“Fuck you,” Draco says without heat. He’s petting one of the trees, talking and singing to it. It’s part of detention, and Sprout says it makes the trees happier, healthier, quicker to grow.
Draco’s head has been pounding since he stepped into the nursery, and the name doesn’t help. Still, he answers, “She’s dead.”
“You’re lying,” he chokes out through gritted teeth. The healer gave him potions in case the headaches were back, but Draco left them in his room back at Hogwarts.
It’s true, and Harry feels a pang of guilt go through him. They’ve been sleeping in the same bed for a while now, and Harry always stays in bed until Draco wakes so the blond will think he sleeps as much as he does, but truth is, he often doesn’t sleep at all.
“You don’t have to stay here,” She says cautiously. She’s trying not to make his breakdown worse; Draco doesn’t think there
There are magpies painted on the walls – thirteen of them, Draco has counted – and a sun, high on the wall, right above the nursery. He doesn’t know why, but he thinks that’s important.
If Draco knew Bill any less, he’d say the news caused no reaction, but catches the slight shift of his shoulders, the way his jaw tightens.
“Yeah. No record of him again. It’s useless. I shouldn’t have even told you about it.” She says quickly. “I’m starving, and the food here is atrocious. You guys stay here, I’ll go get us something to eat, yeah?”
“I know.” He rubs a hand over his face tiredly. After a beat of silence, he looks at Hermione. “You’re oddly quiet.”
Draco feels half-embarrassed by the intense wave of relief that floods his body. He shrugs a shoulder tensely.
“Mr. Weasley?” Lupin calls, just before Draco’s out the door. “Professor Snape asked me to speak with you about skipping class. He’s been reluctant to go to the Headmistress, but if this behavior continues he’ll be forced to inform her.”
“Well it’s not like we’re family or anything, is it?” Draco asks. He has his hands in his pockets and what he can imagine is an ugly sneer on his face. His muscles aren’t used to it, and it feels weird, but Draco can’t manage another expression at the moment.
It’s funny. He thinks. He’s not sure. This whole situation has given him a rather odd sense of humor.
“Not all kids!” Harry defends weakly. Draco gives him a look, and Harry sighs. “Alright, fine, most kids
“I’m not a nerd.” He hisses, reaching across Potter to pinch Ron’s arm. He yelps, flinching, and Draco gives him a self-satisfied smile. It’s Ron who glares this time.
Draco’s friends are also looking around, seeming equally confused, and Draco vaguely registers Professor Sprout asking a question.
the Horcruxes are – as if he could know – and, after the first few days were unsuccessful, Voldemort left, with most of his death eaters, and instructions for the ones who remained to
“Thank Merlin,” Pansy mutters with an eye-roll. She hates Skeeter. Then she seems to think about it. “Maybe they used it to get you to open it.”
“You need to stop what you’re doing,” Zabini tells him. “I told you about the Horcruxes to warn you, not to lead you to your death.”
Draco shakes his head. “He’s been in Azkaban for sixteen years, Blaise, if the family avoided Azkaban they must’ve fled the country.”
“It wasn’t supposed to be like this,” Mrs. Thomas laments, looking over Dolohov’s sleeping body. “You weren’t supposed to be here. It was only supposed to be me and him.”
Draco stares at him for a long time, and when he speaks, the knot in Ron’s stomach tightens further.
“An owl?” Hermione sounds alarmed. Ron feels bad – or he thinks he would, were he not in this – this
“Then why hadn’t they told you this, huh?” Malfoy sneers. “Have they ever discussed the war with you? They’ve been talking about it since the beginning of the year. They haven’t told you because they don’t think you can handle it. They think you’re a child that needs protecting. Isn’t that what they’ve always told you? That you need them big, strong, Gryffindors to protect you?”
Hermione goes red. “It doesn’t matter. The point is we have a no-questions-I-won’t-tell-if-you-don’t-mutual-destruction sort of agreement, so he doesn’t ask questions, and we’ve actually found a lot of things.”
“Ron, Hermione, and I are leaving.” It’s said too quickly and too lowly for Draco to understand immediately, but when he does, he stiffens against Harry. He pulls away slightly so he can look at his face. “We need to find the rest of the Horocruxes, now that you know how to destroy them. We have some – some suspicions as to where they are, and – say something, please.”
“Shit,” Zabini hisses. After he gave Theo Draco’s wand to give back to him, he didn’t imagine this was what he’d use it for.
“Yup.” This is always Adam’s favorite part, and he takes Noah’s place, pinning a white sheet with a question mark. “Someone wants something to do with him, but we don’t know who. Or why.”
“I can go out with whoever I please.” Draco says, clipped. “It’s not your decision. And I’m not going out with him again, anyway. He seems to be under the impression that I’m
The Aurors think he’s lying, he knows, even with the Healer’s diagnostic spells of a memory charm. He wishes he were. Then, at least, he’d remember where he was.
He really is. He can regularly produce a non-corporeal Patronus now, but Harry doesn’t know why he’s having so much trouble with producing a corporeal.
. “If the memory doesn’t work, maybe you should change it. Isn’t there another one where you’re very happy?”
“I’m fine.” Draco’s voice comes out higher-pitched than he’d like. He clears his throat. “Fine. I feel fine.”
Draco’s first class is Defense against the Dark Arts with the Slytherins, so he sits with Pansy and Blaise.
“You will sit down and eat Harry Potter.” Molly says sternly. “McGonagall’s already told Remus you’re here, and he told Sirius, and you’re not getting any worse under my care.” Her face softens, and she says. “And afterwards you can see Draco.”
Even Hermione seems to be hiding things from him – whenever he tries to ask her about why exactly they’re researching Horocruxes, she sort of clamps up and tries to change the subject. She’s an acceptable liar, but only as long as long as she has the lie planned – so he finds himself spending an increasing amount of time alone.
Draco’s head is spinning, and his ears are buzzing, and it’s too much, it’s all too much. He needs Malfoy to stop talking, he needs to think about this, he needs to go back to a few hours ago when he still thought everyone he loves loved him back.
Harry and him aren’t anything. Harry can very well sleep with anyone he wants to. That’s the whole point of not being anything with anyone, right?
?” Harry’s voice rises, and Ron feels thoroughly satisfied of getting a reaction out of him after two weeks of him saying
Thomas rolls his eyes and shakes his head. “We’re not talking about this, okay? This isn’t even a possibility. Nice ghost story, and all, but we should just go to sleep. The teachers will probably explain it to us in the morning, okay? It’s fine. We’re all fine.”
“You know he’s going to find out at some point, right?” Bill asks. “I agree right now is not the best moment, but… maybe it’d be better if it came from us.”
“The less people we sneak in the better.” Parkinson says. “Granger, you need to be there to take care of the spell, so Blaise’ll sneak you into the Boy’s dorm. Anyone else want to go?”
, but Harry’s sitting at one end of the table, looking supremely uncomfortable, and Bill, his mum, Charlie, Fred, and George at the other end, with crossed arms and frowns on their faces.
He’ll do it, drive Greyback insane with it; he’ll do it to the rest of the death eaters, too, all of them, death too merciful.
“He was missing, and you knew of someone that had reasons to take him and you didn’t think it was important to tell me?!” He asks. He’s furious, the anger coiling inside his chest like a snake, hot, and tight, and hurting.
know, and they’ve all been lying to your face. Do you think it’s because they love you? No, Draco, it’s because they’re selfish. They don’t want you to know because they’re afraid of what you might do. They don’t trust you to make your own decisions.”
“So, err-” Ron scrambles for something to change the subject, but he shuts up, because as they get closer to the courtyard, he begins to hear a chanting of ‘fight, fight, fight’.
Draco hums. “McGonagall will probably tell us tomorrow. She can’t just dismiss the Welcome feast and then not say anything about anything.”
“That Voldemort was back,” Harry says. Every person in the room flinches, even if it was something they already knew. “Mentioned something about an old wand-”
He got the notice of it a few weeks ago, and he’s happy for Bill. He’s been making sacrifices for the rest of them for all his life, he deserves someone that makes him as happy as Fleur does.
“Well, Mr. Potter,” Sprout says, frowning. “I was going to ask Mr. Weasley the youngest and Thomas Franco. They’ve always had a particular talent – not to say willingness – at sneaking around the castle.” She pauses and gives him a chance to complain. “Unless you know any reason why I shouldn’t?”
Draco’s tense, Harry knows, even without looking at him. Riddle’s criminal organization has always been personal for him, because he practically grew up in it. His father, Lucius Malfoy, has been Riddle’s right hand man since the start, and Draco was being groomed to become everything his father was.
“Did you know the Bloody Baron killed the Grey Lady?” he asks. “He wanted to date her, and when she said no he killed her.”
The hat also considered Slytherin, but Draco’s never told anyone that. Its final decision – Hufflepuff – is the only thing that matters, after all.
Ugghh sorry for taking so long... a bunch of things got deleted from my computer,, including everything i've ever written so i'm just a bit :))))))))))))))))))))
“When we were seven, mom took us to France to see some ‘aunt’.” George says. “You were five, Gin was four and Draco was three.”
gone well for Ron, and all he’d done was talk to Draco about it, not the person he was dating – so he merely keeps his mouth shut.
“That you might not know about.” McGonagall explains. “Any letters without names. Floo calls to the common room. Messages of any sort that were even remotely suspicious.”
Draco’s spine tightens, and he shrugs Ron’s hand off. He slides down to sit on the floor, and after a few seconds, Ron does the same.
He can’t just walk up to Draco and explain everything to him when the insufferable brat has been hiding things from him since he told him he loved him.
