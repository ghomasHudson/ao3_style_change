He expected to receive the
How had he never realised any of this before?
Draco was still and silent, so Harry pulled back just enough to meet his eyes. His face was completely blank, torturing Harry by telling him nothing.
"Yeah. Just … odd."
“I'll tell Hermione to join us,” Ron threw in.
Draco wrinkled his nose at the thought of using any surface Pansy and Longbottom might have used for their own groping. "
"You have a date!"
Harry smiled back and, in his relief, failed to block the Full Body-Bind Curse which sent him crashing to the ground. Draco rolled him over and smiled maliciously down at him. "Luckily for you, I’ve outgrown breaking noses." He looked over to where the boys had run off, and when he looked back at Harry, his eyes were serious. "I’m trying to be a better person. I’m trying to be someone Scorpius will be proud of. But my past keeps getting in the way. People keep thinking the worst of me." He flicked his wand and released Harry.
“Come to tuck me in, Draco?”

Soon there were more limbs and Draco fell forward to land on the grass. But not the grass. Harry had somehow come between him and the grass and looked completely shocked.
Harry woke to the sound of a body sliding against crisp sheets and the lift in the mattress as someone got up. He blearily opened an eye and found Draco watching him.
were incredible. You seem to think it was
Despite a house full of his friends, Potter had stayed at Draco's side for most of the evening. He would occasionally be pulled away, and yet he always reappeared at Draco's side with a small smile and his glass of wine. He spoke freely when Draco asked questions that were increasingly personal in nature as if he trusted Draco—which was ridiculous given that Draco hadn't even initiated Phase Three.
in all those years of Astronomy?”  Harry wondered if there was some prediction in the stars about pointy gits working well with over-sized lizards.  He remembered Firenze and the other centaurs going on and on about Mars being bright, and figured it was possible.  Ron didn’t seem to be thinking about it all, having returned to dunking a butter biscuit in his tea.
Harry glanced ahead to where Luna was walking with Pavel.  “It’s not too late to change that.”  He quickened his steps and couldn’t hide his smile when he felt Draco increase his own stride to stay by his side.  Harry positioned himself between Draco and Luna just as Pavel was mentioning the Opaleye they’d gotten from their sister reserve in New Zealand.
Now, however, the thought made his stomach turn.  He didn't
When a cake pan went into the oven, Harry thought there might be a pause, but chocolate flew into a pan again and Draco was still clearly focused on his task. Harry felt certain he had been forgotten completely and he was seeing Draco as he would be if alone. It felt rather intimate.
to focus on is that I want
Harry and Ron continued questioning Draco for another twenty minutes and Harry was repeatedly impressed with the knowledge behind each response.  When it neared nine o'clock, Draco handed over a neatly written report and said he'd be available for any follow-up questions they might have.  The whole procedure had been almost clinically professional, and Harry wasn't quite sure what to make of it.
Draco was harassed constantly: at work, on the street, at pubs.  Clearly everyone could smell the virginity on him.  Why else was he hunted the way he was?  Perhaps once he was deflowered, they would leave him alone.  Or he could get someone to make them leave him alone.  Yes!  He would choose a possessive lover who would keep the others away.  It would have to be someone powerful.
In addition to dividing chores well, they actually got along as well.  When Draco returned from the field in the evenings, they would join the team at the inn for dinner and then retreat back to their own flat for a quiet evening of reading, Gobstones, and occasionally conversation.
Mother pouted. Not in an exaggerated way. Nothing tasteless like pushing her lip out, just the tiniest trace of disappointment and sadness across her features that few but her own son would even notice. But Draco did notice, and it made him feel like absolute shit for disappointing her after all she had done for him.
“Hate to admit it, but at least you’re timely.  And I suspect illegal activity is something you understand.”  Weasley glared until Potter elbowed him.
A murmur came from outside and then there was a shout. Harry threw himself into the greenhouse just as two red lights whizzed by. There was a flash of green and a shattering sound before glass rained down on top of them. He felt the weight and heat of Draco’s body beside him and felt a rush of relief that he heard heavy but stable breathing.
"We'll need some ground rules, I think." He looked up at Draco. "First of all: names. Draco, I know that you and my son still go by surnames, but that won't work with seven Weasleys. Your father and I managed to use each other's given names … despite our differences. I expect you all to manage the same." His stern look left Draco and touched on each of his children in turn.
Draco had no idea if Potter could cook, but he Apparated home quite certain that he would eat sawdust if Potter served it. He was still thinking about Potter's smile as he climbed into his empty, cold bed and fell asleep.
"Like what?"
They returned to the kitchen, where Harry noticed his wand.  He'd simply left it on the sideboard as Draco had led him upstairs.  Clearly he trusted Draco more than he'd realised.  Draco poured more wine and offered Harry cheese and crackers with a comment about keeping up his strength.
All he could think about was Draco. Making sure he was safe. His…
“Yeah,” Potter pushed on. “When you were cooking in her mother’s kitchen with her, you were doing everything by hand. But when we were in your kitchen, you used magic for everything. And just now with the window. You opened this one by hand, but once she left you used your wand.”
feel!'
They both knew what they wanted, and Harry was sick of waiting.
That comment easily distracted Harry, as he still felt rather smug for having addicted Draco to Muggle crosswords. Television had been an easy sell as it demanded nothing more than sitting on (and later in) Harry's bed and staring at the screen. In contrast, the crosswords had all but mocked Draco's ignorance of Muggle culture, and Draco hated anything that made him feel inferior.
Harry didn’t taste his ice cream. He was pretty sure he was eating Butterbeer flavour, but his mouth and mind were both completely fixated on the man across the table who was licking bright green ice cream off his spoon. Oh, to be that spoon!
Draco clearly like the latter plan, as he shoved Harry back and pulled off the remains of his clothing as Harry just stared at the appearance of Draco’s hard, pink cock.
With no clothing to worry about, Harry felt unsure of how to proceed.  Draco clearly didn't have that problem.  He shoved Harry backwards onto the bed and then crawled up his body until their lips were almost touching and their hips were aligned.  Draco ground down on him, and Harry felt a thick, hot weight against his own cock.  Draco was hard.  Very hard.  He wanted Harry badly.  His eyes were dark and his hand was almost trembling as it ran down Harry's side.  Harry had always known he could wind Malfoy up with an insult, but driving Draco mad with arousal was far more fun.
"Thanks," Potter murmured sounding rather drowsy. "That was getting cold."
Vane laughed in his face. "You are so adorably clueless, aren't you?" She pinched his cheek before he could flinch away. "You tie
Harry smiled at Hermione. "Tesco?"
Malfoy huffed. “Yes, I always close my shop on my busiest day. That’s how I stay in business.”
Aunt Gwenna appeared in the doorway and beckoned for Merryn. A few minutes later, Bippy appeared and began to set up another table. Before Draco could ask what was happening, Merryn returned, followed by a woman Draco didn’t know. But Potter certainly did, given the way his eyes went wide. Draco asked him who it was and noticed Potter seemed to relax slightly.
And then they were still, pressed close together on the large, dark bed.  Harry stared at the white ceiling wishing for a light fixture or moulding to occupy his sight as Draco panted against his chest.  Their breathing slowed until the room was as quite as the ceiling was blank, and with nothing left to distract him, the paused thoughts flooded back into Harry's mind.
“Good iron,” he said stupidly.  If he didn’t know better, he’d have said the iron beamed.  He pulled his robes away and set his trousers in their place.  The iron happily went to work.  Several minutes later, he was dressed in warm, wrinkle-less clothes and the iron was resting on his night stand.  He made a mental note to send Hermione a thank you gift.
Harry kissed him. It was too brief and too chaste, but it was a promise of more to come. “Good.”
The man advanced on him, pressing further into Draco's space.  “There's no reason for—”  A wand on the man's nose caused him to freeze.  At the other end of the wand stood Potter, looking surprisingly menacing despite his sway.
Harry’s own boxers suddenly felt stifling, and he quickly pulled them down.
Harry had expected Draco to tear up the papers with some choice words about Muggles, but instead he had taken it as a challenge and done a surprising amount of research: mainly watching hours and hours of television.
"Bye, see you at Christmas!" They both yelled as the train pulled away from the station, waving vigorously as faces passed, Regulus holding in tears while James lifted one hand in a lazy goodbye. Harry couldn't wait until Christmas, knowing that Draco would be joining them for the festivities and he'd get to relax with his dads away from the crowds surrounding him at Hogwarts.
Merryn’s gait faltered. “I wanted to…”
Then they were gone. Draco wondered if the wine on his own breath had put Potter off, but one glance at Potter's face—the flushed cheeks and wide eyes—showed nothing but fear. Was Potter really worried that Draco wouldn't want him?
“Thinking what to buy me?”  Draco was smiling with the materialistic glee of a small child, and Harry fought not to laugh.  Draco could be so sophisticated and mature one moment, only to regress to childishness when promised a present or denied a treat.
It was not long before Harry found himself eating where Malfoy ate and reading every article with even a casual mention of any Malfoy.  And it was the results of that informal investigation—he was not stalking—that led to Malfoy becoming Draco.  At least in his mind.
Harry suspected he was right. People didn’t really care one way or another about Draco
Of course. If Ron used holidays as an excuse to binge eat, Hermione used them as a chance to ensure the ethical treatment of any living thing.
“Yes. Mine are charmed, too. All of my trousers are.”
of it all?
“Draco, you've been invited to Sunday lunch ever since we started dating.  I know you have a rough history with some of the Weasleys, but I'm part of their family and you're my boyfriend.”
He let his eyes fall to the thin, faint scar he'd been ignoring on Draco's chest.  The brief reminder of what a moment's stupidity could have cost them was all it took to sober him and pull him back from orgasm.  He could never undo that scar or the terror that must have accompanied it, but he could create new memories of pleasure and joy.
Draco, who had done little but chant and moan as Harry prepared him, pulled himself up onto his hands and knees, waving his glistening hole in Harry’s face. Harry grabbed his arse again, pulled the cheeks apart, and lined himself up.
The next practice was awkwardly quiet and polite, so Draco was surprised to see Potter arrive at their third practice with a cheeky grin on his face.
The Muggle telephone at the front desk rang. In the early days, Draco had enjoyed the thing. The little clanging noise had seemed cheerful, and the sight of it had always drawn happy comments from his Muggle-raised guests. Now the sound was jarring and invasive as it only meant one thing.
The smile spread farther across Draco’s lips. "How juvenile, Potter." He gave into a smile. "Some of us have grown up over the years."
Draco nodded. He was grateful to know Potter didn’t intend to ignore him or forget everything that had happened.
“Should I be worried?” Malfoy teased. “I can see your mind working.”
Having surrendered the bathroom to Potter and put on clean robes, Draco found himself momentarily at a loss for what to do next. It would have been nice to contact his own friends, but Draco couldn't cast a Patronus—not that he would admit that to Potter—and he didn't think the elves were likely to fetch his owl or deliver messages for him. For Potter, they would be delighted, but not for Draco.
Once Iris had flown from view, Harry set about cleaning his cottage.  Whilst Draco had been there the night before, Harry could hope he hadn't seen the overflowing laundry hamper in the closet or the pile of dirty dishes in the sink.  And maybe the darkness had hidden the layers of dust in his sitting room.  He figured he could get a good two hours in before he'd need to shower and dress for lunch.
He just wasn’t sharing them, and Harry found himself disappointed each time those pale pink lips twitched with an unsaid comment.
And Harry wasn’t at Luna’s garden party, and he wasn’t at Seamus and Dean’s Football versus Quidditch party. It was as if he had ceased to exist, and Draco was running out of time before Hermione’s return and birthday.
Draco.  Draco.  Draco.  Draco.  Draco.  Draco.
'He's . . . in
Draco pulled him forward into a wet and messy kiss. 'To answer your questions,' Draco said as they parted, 'yes, we seem to be doing very
He had missed it so much during his year in Paris. He had missed her warm wooden kitchens as he toiled for hours in an industrial kitchen made of metal. He had missed the gentle lilt of Rosamund’s West Country accent as he was lectured in stern French. He had missed his Great Aunt Gwenna sitting with him by the fire every night that he returned to find his tiny Parisian flat as barren and lifeless as he had left it that morning.
. It had taken some work getting Firenze to agree to talk about his treatment by wizards over the years, but the resulting interview was moving and should inspire sympathy for centaurs. He owed Pansy for making sure the interview was assigned to a young reporter who had been Firenze’s student for five years before graduating. He had known Pansy’s nose for gossip would make her a great reporter one day, and he was glad to have an ally with the major paper.
Draco wrinkled his nose at the thought of eating dinner before seven, but he couldn't deny his elation at the confirmation that Potter indeed remembered the night before and was still up for their dinner plans. Draco could always distract Potter for several hours until it was a civilised hour for dining.
When Potter asked Draco what station to set the wireless to, Draco nearly lost it.
“They didn’t want me to do anything at first, but when I told them who had ordered it...they were as afraid of him as anyone. So they let me help with the most basic things and I found I liked it. Not that I told anyone else that. I made sure to have a right fit about it so I’d be punished that way again. Eventually, I stopped waiting to be sent to the kitchens and started sneaking in on my own.”

"No! These are Scorpius’s favourite! He’s already so sad that Astoria can’t come for Christmas. I have to at least bake her biscuits!" He tried to pick up a measuring cup but sent it toppling to the floor where it shattered. He looked on the verge of tears as he stared blearily at the little shards of glass around his feet. "Why hasn’t someone invented a Portkey that pregnant witches can use?!"
Harry was rather disappointed to think that Malfoy was dressing his colleagues and not him. Malfoy
Then Charlie said a name that caught his attention completely.  Harry hadn’t been paying enough attention to understand the context, but it must have been interesting as Charlie was now laughing at Ron’s gaping mouth.  Hermione had her own lips pressed together in a little line the way she did when she was processing new information.
. Toby had been approached by several good-looking Muggles before disappearing with a bear of a man for so long, Harry had assumed he’d been abandoned.
He startled when he felt a presence behind him as soon as he’d crossed the street. His Auror training wanted to turn and Stun his follower, but he reminded himself where he was. Turning, he saw Malfoy running a hand over his own silky hair and looking stubbornly casual.
Three Aurors? Harry felt a bit giddy at the thought of working a major case, especially with Ron.
photograph of drinking champagne with Harry Potter to increase one's popularity. The public needn't know how awkward those few words of polite conversation had been.
Draco coughed as Harry flushed at his own words. He'd said what he thought Draco wanted to hear—surely after waiting so long for Harry to wake up to his own feelings, Draco wanted to claim him fully—but now Harry worried that Draco might think he knew anything about the shagging he'd flippantly mentioned.
Potter gave him another brilliant smile.  Draco could definitely get used to having that look directed at him.
Harry pulled Draco against him for a kiss to demonstrate his appreciation. He could taste himself on Draco's tongue and felt a rush of nerves as he realised it would be his turn next. Surely a blow job was repaid in kind?
“No, thanks, Draco.  I think they’re trying to close up.”  He looked over his shoulder at the elderly couple who ran the inn.  They were cleaning off tables and putting out lights.
Why was he having thoughts like that about Potter? What was with his mind’s new obsession with seeing Potter as a potential lover instead of the nuisance he was?
Of course, back then tea hadn't been spoiled by aggressive questions about his sex-life.
The End
Potter dragged him down onto the bed with him.  “I want you, Draco.  Merlin, you're so hot!”  He was slurping, nipping, and biting at Draco's neck and collarbone.  Potter's hands wrapped around him and grabbed his arse cheeks, pulling them apart and up through his trousers.  “Ugh!  Your arse is amazing.  Feels as good as it looks.  Want it.”  Potter was arching off the bed so their groins rubbed together.  Draco was at a loss.  Should he stay and let Potter—a ridiculously drunk Potter—fuck him as planned, or should he leave the man to sober up?  A few minutes later, the choice was made for him.
"I'd wondered if the attraction was mutual."
It was fifteen minutes before Hermione and Oliver were due over when Harry went in to wake Draco. He hated to interrupt the needed sleep—and Draco looked so stunning with his pale lashes against his flushed cheeks—but Draco would never forgive Harry if he didn’t have enough time to spell his teeth clean and his hair smooth before their guests arrived.
write you off as an odd foreigner.” He winked and Draco laughed. It was a light self-deprecating laugh that Harry felt in his gut. He liked having lunch with Draco, talking about their work and their training. He hoped this wouldn’t be the last time.
Malfoy moaned and began swearing. He went through the usual curses as Harry bobbed his head on Malfoy’s cock and then moved on to ones that Harry didn’t know. Was ‘son of a cum-sucking hag’ even a real expression? Harry wasn’t in a position to ask.
Draco took a deep breath to compose himself. He had made a mistake—hardly the first in his life—and he would move on as he had before. He wouldn’t worry Scorpius by being sullen. With his head held high and a stiff smile on his face, he walked up the path to the large house his great-grandfather had built in the countryside outside Paris. The oak door swung open as he approached, and he stepped into warm air scented with baked sugar. His stiff smile melted into something real. Astoria must have been baking again. She knew he didn’t approve of encouraging Scorpius’ sweet tooth, but she clearly didn’t care. At the moment, he didn’t either. He just wanted to be home with the people who cared about him, who saw him as more than his past mistakes.
"What?" Had she missed the whole point of this being about
"And I tasted the cake she made for your birthday." How could he forget a bite of cake that seemed determined not to dissolve in his mouth despite repeated chewing? He'd finally resorted to choking it down whole with a large gulp of wine. "The less time that witch spends in a kitchen, the better for the health of everyone she knows."
* * *
Apparently, September would be no different.  Harry sat up among the sheets looking around the tidy room for any sign of Draco.  Nothing.  Sighing, Harry pulled on his discarded pants and looked around for his jeans.  He found them in the hallway and his t-shirt on the edge of the sitting room.
Draco decided not to worry about it and to get some much-needed sleep in his own bed.
Draco froze.
Robards greeted them tersely and then flicked his hand to indicate they could sit. Harry conjured a chair and sat down, grateful he had finally mastered the spell to the point that his chair had a thin layer of padding and didn’t rock or creak. His first year had included many embarrassing briefings, including one where the legs of his chair gave out and he tumbled to the floor in front of several colleagues. Robards had given him desk duty for a month after that. And confiscated his chair.
There were those big green eyes that cast
"Exactly. Ginny's dad is so bad in the kitchen he nearly burned the whole house down. Trust me: this is win-win. You pack a bag, and I'll go Floo Ginny."
When Harry finally shut the door behind him, George let out a breath. "He can be a bit intense, can't he?"
He stretched out on his bed and listened to the faint sound of the shower in the other room. He was glad Potter was hogging the one room with a mirror so he couldn’t give in to the urge to see himself as a purple raccoon. Groaning, he buried his face in his pillow instead.
"Friends? What do you mean friends?"
He had never thought it would come down to this, he had always thought that Harry was completely untouchable, never likely to be hurt or harmed. He had always believed he would pass first, that he would leave his husband behind to continue on in life without him. He had prepared for the inevitability of such a situation, storing his favourite and most lovingly collected memories into vials, each carefully dated and ordered in a timeline of their epic love story.
"Potter! Stop watching as Malfoy does all the work, and for once in your life be useful!" The professor bellowed from the front of the classroom. Harry flinched, nodding his head rapidly as he hurried to try and make himself useful.
~Sunday~
"I will change. I will change everything. If you'll give us another shot then I'll do anything Draco, I want us to work out, I want us to be a forever kind of thing," he pushed his glasses further up the bridge of his nose as he made eye contact with the man whose heart he had broken. His eyes were pleading for Draco to believe him, to give him that second chance that he desperately needed, his hopes for the future were completely dependent on Draco's answer, and whether he felt that Harry was worthy of a second chance.
"Yes I'm bloody serious, just, please take the gift," he nudged the present closer towards Draco, who reached out to take the present with a wary look, struggling to trust Harry and his intentions.
"Yeah, well, you have to work to pay the bills and overwhelming textbook costs," he responded, a sarcastic grin on his face as he nuzzled his face into the thick collar of his hoodie.
Drabble Prompt - Day 8) Teeth
Smoke filled the platform as it billowed from the great crimson steam engine on the tracks. Witches and wizards of all ages hurried across the platform, darting through the crowds as they searched for the least full carriages. Harry slipped his tanned hand into his boyfriends, clutching onto Draco tightly as they made their way through the crowds and towards the seemingly calmer back portion of platform 9 and 3/4.
Draco stumbled out of the bar, phone in hand and a jacket draped over his head as he tried to protect the screen from the falling rain. He was supposed to be heading home, but had somehow been roped into taking over the closing down of the bar, including cleaning up the sticky mess left behind by that day's customers. Instead of bundling himself into the warmth of a taxi, he was calling to cancel the car he'd booked earlier that evening, praying that they would have a free slot to take him home later that evening. If they didn't he'd have to walk, and that was not something he was looking forward to as he gazed up at the cloudy sky.
"Alright, alright!" He chuckled softly, clearly amused at the whole situation, "I'll give it a go." Draco moved closer, pulling on the door handle with all of his weight. Somehow, the door was locked in place, refusing to move even an inch from its latched position.
"Harry Potter is here with us talking about his latest blockbuster, filmed in our very own London, you stole our hearts onscreen and off screen," the host was speaking, Harry, his name was Harry, chuckled softly before grinning wickedly, lips parted and bright white teeth twinkling in the light.
"Harry, we can't live off chicken alone. You need to experience other things, other foods. You'll end up sick from lack of vitamins and minerals, and we'll both be bored of bland chicken," Draco had taken on a pleading tone to his voice, practically begging that Harry compromise with him and just try something different. Harry supposed that he could give in just this once, he could suffer through one meal if it made Draco happy. He would at least try to do so.
"Well hello there mysterious stranger, it's nice to see you again," he spoke softly, knowing the man would be able to hear him as he threw on the hoodie that he'd stuffed inside his bag earlier that day. It came as no surprise to Draco that once again, his saviour was waiting for him, although this time Draco didn't have the time to loiter and chat, he had to hurry home to work on an essay due the next day.
Drabble Prompt - Day 1) Fish
"Um, I should go!" Draco hurried out, rushing up the stairs and unlocking the door as he waved goodbye to the mysterious stranger one final time before heading inside. Leaning against the front door, Draco sighed as he realised what had almost happened, he had almost kissed a complete stranger, although he supposed they weren't truly strangers anymore.
Draco had it worse though, when it wasn't one of his parents splashed across the pages, detailing the numerous crimes they had committed while working under Voldemort, it was Draco himself gracing the front pages. They would slate his character and actions since the war ended, constantly pointing out that at one point he had believed in Voldemort's cause, had fought for him even, and yet had somehow ended up with Harry. It wasn't enough for them that he permanently wore the mark of his actions, constantly faced with the error in his ways, the result of a decision that would forever haunt him.
"Throw my weight? This is me throwing my weight Draco!" Harry spoke sharply, peeved that his boyfriend thought he was lacking in the strength department when he was clearly trying his hardest.
"Harry, I hope you and Draco are packed and ready, because we need to go, now!" Regulus yelled up the stairs of the manor, hurrying through the foyer as he ran through the mental checklist he had created of everything his stepson would need for the incoming train journey.
"Of course I need to panic! I'm not sending you anything you've forgotten to Hogwarts, so you best hope you've remembered everything, and Narcissa entrusted me with Draco so I need to make sure he gets there safely," Regulus was on a roll, the words spewing out at a rapid pace. "And for the love of Merlin, I can't find your bloody father anywhere!"
"Harry, we've had chicken for dinner three times this week alone, please can we have something else. I beg of you!" It had been an experience moving in with one another, neither had ever lived with a romantic partner before and had clearly not anticipated the fights that even the littlest, most inconsequential things would cause. For example, what to eat for dinner. It had somehow managed to become a rather contentious argument between the pair. Harry stuck to classic English comfort food, being the only thing he had learnt to cook, and also all that was served at both Hogwarts and the Weasley's, it was what he felt comfortable with.
Ever since they first began to see one another, they knew of the risks involved. They knew that there was no way for them to be anything other than sworn enemies within the public eye. Eyes were watching their every move, the Pureblood son born into a family of muggle haters, a family that despised those with murky and diluted blood, and the Half-Blood saviour of the Wizarding World, born to a Pureblood who defied the old ways and loved a Muggleborn. From the very moment their eyes clashed inside Madam Malkins, they unknowingly never had a chance. LINK That they would never be able to stroll through the corridors of Hogwarts holding hands, that they could never kiss in the middle of Diagon Alley.
It was times like this that he truly hated what had happened to him when he was younger, when he despised the decision that had been made when deciding upon his guardianship. If he had been placed with a Wizarding family, or at least a guardian that did not detest magic, maybe Harry wouldn't feel so behind and as if he was lacking in magical ability. It would have definitely helped him to fit in better among his peers if he had known that magic existed for longer than a couple of months.
"Hey, thanks again for saving me last night, it would have sucked to fall on my arse in front of you," Draco spoke, seeming to think he should attempt to make some kind of conversation as the man didn't carry on walking. In fact, he shuffled closer to Draco, lifting the umbrella higher so they could both be shielded from the heavy rain. "Thanks, I wasn't expecting the rain to be so heavy tonight, the forecast didn't give much warning."
"Alright, calm down! I'll go and see if Madam Hooch has a spare key, alright?" Draco tried to reassure him, gazing up at the full moon as it made its way across the sky. Harry had been trapped for some time, neither of them able to make a dent in freeing him. Draco couldn't help but to think that maybe it was the full moon doing this, everyone said that the world went crazy during a full moon.
The decorations were extravagant, diamond chandeliers glistened and crystal baubles glittered as light refracted in all directions. The ballroom itself had been decorated with such care, and an art for refined beauty. Everything had its own place, decorations contrasting and complementing one another and nothing seemed to overshadow anything else. Everything was equally beautiful, not that Harry would have expected anything less from his detail oriented husband, he truly prioritized the finessing of details.
"You're what?" Draco yelled louder.
As much as Harry tried so hard to avoid the gossip and rumours swirling around the Wizarding World, it made it that much harder when both of their dirty secrets were sprawled across the front pages of every paper and magazine published. For Harry, it usually consisted of them bad mouthing him and his presence within the Wizarding World since the war, or he supposed, it was more his lack of presence. He had struggled to be around so many people after spending so long fighting, constantly looking over his shoulder for trouble. If he was being brutally honest, Harry hated the way they treated him like their saviour, knowing that just a few years previously they were all calling him crazy.
"Hey, are you Draco?" A voice called out, a voice that Draco definitely didn't recognise. Wary as to what could happen, he clenched his fist while approaching the man who had called out to him, a taxi driver parked outside of the bar he had just exited.
"You need to throw your weight at the door Harry!"
"Walking me home again are you?" Draco had expected the awaiting figure this time. Knowing that after five days of him being at his side, waiting outside of the bar, it was unlikely that he wouldn't show up.
"You can be a right fucking idiot sometimes Harry Potter," the anger was thick in his voice as he shot up from the mass of blankets he had taken comfort within, he was a bundle of barely contained anger and frustration, "you broke up with me because you're scared of what others would say about us? Do you not think I'm scared every day at what people must think, about me, my sexuality and about my relationship with you? I love you and you took everything we had and threw it down the drain."
Drabble Prompt - Day 6) rodent
Draco struggled across the slippery ice coating the pavements as he made his way home. It had been a long night at the bar, and he was too exhausted to be dealing with the slick and dangerous concrete. Fumbling in his bag, Draco took his eyes off the icy path before him, searching for his phone in an attempt to silence the continuous buzzing from within. As his hand finally clasped the device, his foot made contact with a patch of unnoticeable ice, and he felt his whole body begin to fall as his ankle jarred from the contact.
He hadn't been sure when to broach the giving of the gift, but he had dedicated a good amount of time to neatly wrapping the present, and he had even stretched to decorating it with a silk green ribbon. It may have seemed over the top, but he wanted it to look like he had made an effort.
"Surprisingly delicious, yet it still does not give you permission to shovel smoked salmon into my mouth without notice." Draco lightly scolded him, but Harry knew that he didn't mean it. He always loved that Harry tried to take care of him, while still allowing him the freedom he craved for and the independence he adored.
"Mate, I don't know, but it's cold so hurry it up please," the man shrugged, popping the locks on the door and allowing Draco to bundle himself into the taxi. He knew it wasn't smart of him to get into a strange car, but he was cold, and honestly could not be arsed with walking the rest of the way home.
"This is for you, take it, please."
"My heart hurts Harry, my heart is aching and it's because of you," he was a bundle of blankets, the top of his head sticking out and his voice muffled as he pressed his face into the fabric of his homemade cocoon. Harry's heart ached at the sight of the man he adored, falling to pieces, and breaking down, because of his actions. He sat on the floor, facing the sofa Draco was curled up on, the Room of Requirement was the place they had spent so much time solidifying their relationship. It only made sense that would be where Draco would go to mourn the failure of said relationship. Harry had sneaked up there during dinner with a twisted idea that it would ease both of their pain to talk about it all.
He looked into those deep green eyes and knew, knew , that he would find happiness if he gave in to hope.  He took a deep breath, smiled, and placed his hand over one of Harry's fidgeting ones.
"Maybe." Draco smiled to himself at getting to tease Potter, especially when he felt the warm huff against his neck.
"I'm tired," Draco murmured. "Take me home."
"I didn't know you were into Herbology." Draco hadn't meant to speak yet, but he was pleased he had managed a casual conversation starter.
'Does that mean,' Harry asked when his lips were his to use again, 'that you don't mind?'
A little cough made Harry start, and he wished the surprise had simply killed him.
Seeking to regain some comfort, he took control.  “Come upstairs.  My room is on the top floor.”  Draco headed to the stairs and relaxed as he heard footsteps following him.
“Yes, yes. Send them in!” Robards gestured for his Aurors to shove down and make room for more. It was a spacious office, but Harry hoped too many people weren’t coming in.
“Fine. What do you want?”
He approached the parchment with the trepidation of a man who still received the occasional Howler or Cursed letter, and he cast a few spells before deeming it safe to pick up. He unrolled it carefully and realised it was his assignment for the Ministry's upcoming Muggle Appreciation Fair.
He conjured a lovely chair with a blue velvet seat before sitting regally across from Harry. He was wearing Muggle clothes, and the light blue jumper exposed delicate collar bones below his pale neck. Harry followed the line of his crisp trousers down to the warm brown Oxfords on his feet. The leather looked like chocolate, and Harry had a sudden image of licking Draco’s shoes.
“Another?” She held up his empty wine glass.  Draco considered just going home, but the lamb really was exceptional.  He nodded and she filled his glass.  As he listened to the lively folk songs playing from some hidden source and ate the perfectly cooked pie, he could almost understand why Potter spent so much time there.
“The world must be ending if I'm teaching you Muggle Studies.”
What use is his mind in the endless tedium? Each day passes the same: three meals and a disinfecting charm to reduce the spread of disease but that never lets him
“Bottling is clearly uniform, but the production and distribution may not be. We don’t know whether this is one group from growing the herbs to selling the potions or if many different organizations are involved. As such, I want each of you to take a part of the process but remain in constant communication. It is—”
She gave him a devious little smile, but it was the closest to actual warmth he had ever seen in her features. “May we quote you, Mr Potter?”
A moment later, another elf arrived for Draco and Potter and squeaked at them to follow it. They were walking down the stairs when it occurred to Draco that the rooms were intended for faculty.
Draco opened his mouth to argue, but he couldn’t find any words in the face of her bright brown eyes. She was as stubborn as the rash lunatic upstairs with the scar on his forehead. He closed his mouth and gave her a small nod.
Blaise's voice in his ear was breathy and low.  “I'll be gentle.  I'll take care of you until you're begging for it.”  He began kissing his way along Draco's ear and down his throat.  He sucked on a sensitive spot under Draco's ear and it felt good, really good.  Draco was struggling to keep his mind focused on fighting.  A moment later, he let his head fall back and groaned.
Moments later, Draco entered the glow. "Scorpius!" He ran forward and dropped to his knees to embrace his son. Then he turned cautiously to look up at Harry. "Thank you for finding him." Draco seemed nervous, as if expecting Harry to shout or flee. Harry did have a recent history of fleeing, so that was fair. Draco turned back to his son. "Are you all right?"
"Cold," Draco murmured. He hadn't realised Potter would hear, but bright eyes locked on his.
"I've never done this before." Potter was a bright shade of red and his eyes were firmly locked on his own jeans. Draco stopped himself before he could admit to knowing. He wouldn't betray Pansy.
Draco pretended to be asleep, but allowed himself to admit silently that he had, too.
This was not a satisfying homecoming.
“Oh for fuck’s sake! Fine. Altitude. Have Muggles found a way to fake that, too?”
"You'll have to come visit again," she said. "I bought a new Muggle toy called a Fisbee."
It was surprisingly soothing watching Potter breathe. His thin lips parted slightly and his face looked so restful now that the fever was gone. Long black lashes rested against delicate cheekbones. He had rather nice features when he wasn’t scowling or looking gormless. The purple around his eyes had faded to a pale bruising, and the blotchy redness had receded until only the apples of his cheeks were flushed. He looked rather pretty.
He wiped his mouth and cheek with the back of his arm and then climbed up Draco's body until their foreheads touched.  “Like this?  Or do you want to ride me?”  Draco looked a bit panicked, so Harry answered his own question.  “Let's do it like this.”  He lifted Draco's hips and slid a thick pillow underneath.  Then he pressed Draco's knees up to his chest.  “Comfortable?”  Draco nodded.
But he
He crowded into Draco’s space and kissed him hard on the mouth. Something told him Draco wouldn’t appreciate cold hands on bare skin, so he happily grabbed Draco’s arse through his boxers and squeezed at the firm flesh of his cheeks. The boxers were cotton, but far softer than anything Harry owned, and Harry wanted to run his hands all over them.
Draco stiffened as Potter verbalised his fear. An image filled his mind of falling into mud as Granger called, "Who's the Mudblood, now?"
Potter nuzzled against his neck. "It did hurt a bit, but I think I was just too tense."
and his tongue followed.
"C’mon. You know you want to use the Bat-Bogey Hex on me."
complex and Pansy was far sharper than she let on. Draco was unsure why she was failing to comprehend. "I already told you about Phase Six."
Draco blinked at him a few times, leaving Harry with the odd thought that he would make a handsome owl, and then he was wondering what Draco’s patronus might be. The silence seemed to stretch out for ages with Harry listening to the clock on the wall ticking away.
“I have to go work,” Draco said reluctantly, like maybe he’d rather stay with Harry. “But I’ll see you at tea?”
“I spoke to Merryn, and she doesn’t mind that you know,” Draco began. “In fact...she thinks I’m being overprotective.”
Harry felt his cheeks flush as he walked forward to shake Aida’s hand. He tried to say he was really just there as a guest, but Aida waved him off.
Scorpius looked past Draco to Teddy and raised his chin in a way that was so much like his father as a boy. "
Potter was bouncing on the balls of his feet like a four-year-old at the door to Honeydukes. "Robards is happy. Ron's fucking thrilled! And I don't have to give up fieldwork for paperwork." He walked up to Draco all but shaking with excitement. "And it's all your doing!" He pulled Draco to his feet and
The light began to fade and the wind picked up. It grew quite cold, especially given the state of Draco's pants, and he finally sat up enough to pull out his wand and cast a Cleansing Charm on each of them.
Just when it was becoming too much, the heat and the pressure, Draco began shuddering and clenching around Harry’s cock. Free to chase his own orgasm, Harry dug his hands into Draco’s hips and thrust mindlessly until his body filled with a roaring bliss and his muscles all gave out. It was with his last strength that he uncoupled from Draco and aimed his collapse to one side.
He took his roll back to the sitting room and threw himself down on the couch. “
Malfoy looked terrified. “And a hundred Weasleys! No, thank you. Although I doubt your are keen to visit mine.” His eyebrows pinched into a little frown. “Perhaps we should start off on neutral ground.”
. So if Potter was amenable to snogging someone like Macmillan,
Draco shook his head. “No, why are you asking my opinion? It didn’t matter two days ago.”
Harry beamed when Draco called them a couple. 'Second year, if you ask my friends,' he teased.
"I take it your little lady isn't a domestic goddess."
Draco woke early on their last day to beat Potter to the shower. He worried if he showered second he might come back to the room only to find it empty. Very soon, Potter wouldn’t be his roommate anymore. He would just be another student with his own House and his own friends, separate from Draco.
have plans to spend Saturday night with Blaise and Pansy at Diagon Alley's first and only nightclub. Yes, it was rather Muggle, but even a pure-blood could appreciate good drinks and buttery leather booths.
to understand when everyone fucking worships the—"
"Yes, Potter. I know what a three-legged race is." Draco was reluctantly grateful to Vane that he wouldn't have to admit ignorance in front of Potter.
Draco wasn't sure if it was his bad luck or Potter's that landed their study group in quarantine. It wasn't Patil's; her life seemed quite dull.
Draco's brow scrunched together as if he were decoding something cryptic.  “You want to come to Vienna and go to balls that even I find tedious?  You don't even like Ministry balls where everyone speaks English and your friends are there.”
The barkeep—Tom, he suddenly remembered—started to pour his Firewhisky and then swore when the bottle ran out.  He muttered something and then disappeared to a back-room.   Of course.  Because even getting a drink in a pub has to be as hard as possible.
“You, too, Malfoy.  I’m glad that you’re well.”  She sounded genuine.  Her smile brightened her eyes as she shook Draco’s hand in greeting.  Harry stole a glance at Draco’s stunned expression and smiled.  Apparently he hadn’t expected that response.
Draco's laugh was clear and warm.  "Oh Harry, I secured that invitation the moment she mentioned you were coming to dinner."
Harry watched the little knobs that made up Draco’s spine rise and fall. His back was as expressive as his face, and Harry took in each twitch and arch, using each movement as a guide to increasing Draco’s pleasure. Draco shifted his weight forward onto one elbow and began stroking himself, and Harry knew he had to last long enough for Draco to come. He had to give Draco that pleasure.
"Papa!" A little figure rushed into the hallway from the kitchen door and stumbled toward him. Draco fought back a laugh at his son’s waddle of a run. He looked at the smile on Scorpius’ face, and the weight in his chest lifted completely. He could endure anything if he could come home to that smile.
Harry scowled.  “Bernard Sothman?”  Draco nodded.  “ He's your boss now?  I don't like him.”  They finished eating in silence, and Draco wondered at Harry's sudden brooding.
“You two didn’t make it far,” Merryn said from behind them where she stood holding two slices of Draco’s flourless chocolate cake.
Draco's first Christmas home from Hogwarts held new meaning. It was still about the glut of presents and sweets, but it was also about returning to his rightful place at the centre of attention. After four months of his peers and most of his professors fawning over stupid Potter, it was a relief to be fussed over by his mother and questioned by his father. Mother had the elves make all of his favourite meals, convinced as she was that the sub-par Hogwarts food would ruin his palate. His father, as Chairman of the Board of Governors of Hogwarts, now viewed him as a font of information about the ridiculous Headmaster and the goings on at the school. Draco felt a rush of pride at being a private spy, checking up on the quality of the institution in a way the Governors themselves could not.
The two of them had become friends when Toby was sent by Magical Games and Sports to consult on a case of illegal performance-enhancing potions that were popular among some Quidditch players. It had been Harry’s first big Auror case, and Toby’s insight and experience had been invaluable. They had stayed close in the years since, eating lunch together or grabbing a pint after work.
Draco nodded at that. For all that Arthur Weasley was obsessed with Muggles, his children were wizards through and through. Over the past year, Draco had decided that the Weasley feud his father had started was not an advantageous one. While he still had too much pride to even speak to the youngest two, he'd forced himself to be civil to the others he saw around the Ministry.
Perhaps finding her alone like this was a sign. He might not be the most observant Auror—yes, he could admit it—but he was their best interrogator. People either trusted him or were terrified of him, but he always got the information he needed. Time to use that talent on this case.
Draco’s eyes shot open. "Dinner! Do you think we’ll have heard by then? Is Hermione still—"
“Of course, Harry.” Of course. Draco would be happy to name his competition. How about Homewrecker? Love Thief?  Or just stick with Furbag? “How about Rufus? It means red-haired. Or in this case, red-furred.”
The circumstances of his arrival in Cornwall had not been pleasant. The moment his mother had woken in St Mungo’s, still covered in her husband’s blood, she had ordered her house-elf to find Draco and take him to his Great Aunt Gwenna. Draco hadn’t seen his mother until she was released from St Mungo’s weeks later, so it had fallen to Gwenna to tell him of his father’s murder and then hold him while he wept. Gwenna had never been close to her nephew—she and Lucius disagreed on almost everything—but she found words of comfort for the son who grieved him.
“Whatever.”
competition to the loo," Longbottom said.
Harry tried to hide his panic as he wondered how long he was expected to stay Malfoy's prisoner.  "Malfoy, it's—"  He stopped when he saw the hard look on Malfoy's face.
Just as Harry was getting into it, Draco pulled back with a shark-like grin. “Date’s over. Next date starts in five minutes. I’ll meet you at Fortescue’s.”
As they talked, Harry was treated to embarrassing stories about a young Draco on summer holidays.  If he hadn’t just gotten back into Draco’s good graces, he would have teased him mercilessly about the time Edward and Rolf had apparently Charmed his robes to smell like skunk spray during a formal ball.  Draco had apparently gotten revenge by Charming their faces green the year after, a story Rolf related good-naturedly.  Harry felt a rush of pride for Draco’s impressive spellwork at such a young age.
Didn’t have a … had she died? The boy didn’t look upset. Had it been some time? Was the newspaper article Harry had seen an obituary? Before he could begin to understand his feelings, Teddy cut in.
Of course, there was the little matter that, while Potter didn't seem to hate him anymore, they weren't exactly friendly.  He wasn't really sure what they were.  Draco hadn't seen Potter for three years after the war: Potter had been in Auror training with Weasley and Longbottom, whilst Draco had finished his N.E.W.T.'s and gone abroad to earn his masters in Potions.  Draco had even managed two weeks working on the same floor of the Ministry before their paths had crossed.
He was still ridiculously noble, but Draco resisted the urge to roll his eyes. “You do realise you are
"Did you have fun tonight?" Harry didn't need to ask, but he enjoyed the contented sigh Draco's released against his neck before confirming he had. "Me too."
“That I’m a friend.”
To bear witness.
The water darkened his hair from its ethereal glow to a mortal blond, making him more touchable for being human. The warm water pinked his cheeks and the top of his chest, where it made contact, until it matched the hue of the head of his cock. Each drop of water seemed determined to draw Harry’s eyes down over lean muscle and smooth skin to the evidence of Draco’s neglected arousal.
"It didn't work Draco."
"Are you kidding me? This is all I've had to look forward to this evening! I'd be personally offended if you didn't walk me home," he teased back, a shy grin tugging at his lips. The pair walked primarily in silence, sometimes broken with the odd question and accompanying answer, but it seemed that they were both thinking deeply. Occasionally their hands brushed against one another, tingles shooting up their arms as the connection they shared became ever so apparent. Draco had never felt like it before, he had never been in such a situation before and wasn't sure how to deal with such an attraction.
"No! Harry will stay right here, otherwise we'll be here for an age, waiting on you two to stop with your ridiculously amorous displays of affection." The words were teasing, yet the edge of stress was still clear, causing Draco to hurry towards the kitchen, intent on escaping the incoming hurricane that was a stressed out Regulus.
Draco couldn't believe that this was what Harry wanted to discuss, the future that they could have shared together, if not for Harry tearing those dreams apart when he broke Draco's heart. Draco too had dreamed of their future together. He had envisioned them both living in the refurbished Potter Manor, giving them the freedom to be who they wanted away from everyone else. Harry would go off to work every day, most likely as an Auror, and Draco would stay at home exploring both he creation of potions and rare manuscripts, something that had always interested him, but he'd been unable to dedicate any time to. He could see them both being the doting and loving parents that their adopted children would need, bringing them into their home and showing them they deserved to be loved, accepting them for who they were no matter their differences. It hurt even more to hear Harry talk about the possibilities with such longing in his voice, knowing it was no longer a feasible plan.
He returned to his desk to find Clearwater fiddling with his paperweight.  “Here are your parchments.  Is there anything else you need for your meeting?”  He handed over the paperwork and awaited the next chance to do a favour.
he added silently.
So Draco had saved Harry after all. And maybe, although Draco would never admit it to Granger, Harry had saved him, too.
Merryn’s eyes flashed at him referencing her less-than-subtle obsession, but she walked away without conveying her irritation to Gabby.
Draco was silent for a moment, looking Harry in the eye as if assessing his motives. Then he gave a nod so small it might not have been intentional before gazing out at the sea beyond them. He led them out of the rose garden and into a grassy field as he spoke. “It was really an excuse to cook. Well, bake really. Rosamund and Aida do most of the cooking.”
At least the French like me, he mused, as he read the flattering article under the photograph of Astoria, Scorpius, and him from the previous year’s event.
“Because I want to date you,” Harry said, “and since we are in the same place this weekend it seemed the wedding was a good place to start. Although maybe a wedding is a bit intense for a first date. If you’d rather, we can wait until next weekend and I can take you to the cinema or the theatre or whatever else interests you.”
"Ron, since you've been sharing with George, would you mind if Draco stays in your old room?"
Harry choked on his own saliva, and Draco waited patiently while he coughed awkwardly.
“English?” the witch asked in a heavy accent. Harry nodded. “Muggleborn?” Harry frowned, wondering if he was about to face pureblood politics. The witch must have guessed his concern because she explained her question. “The Floo is always harder for those who did not use it as children. Like swimming.” Harry gave her a weak smile and nodded. “You eaten?” Harry noted that she did not ask if he was hungry or if he
Malfoy pulled back to meet his eye. His features were sharp, but the little smile that curved his lips was warm. “It think we needed the time, Potter.” He cocked his head and smirked. “And why should the holidays be torture? If you are implying you will miss me, wizards have invented this wonderful thing called the Floo network.”
Draco didn’t know what Ribena was, but he was pretty sure it was not crème de cassis. It was probably English, Muggle, and cheap. Instead of arguing, he simply raised his own apéritif in toast and took pride in the sounds of delight Potter made as he drank. Clearly not “like Ribena”.
“Draco,” came the purred reply.
Draco arrived early to the Ministry Monday morning, as he did every workday and the occasional Saturday. He rode the lift down to the second level and walked the long empty corridor to the cluster of desks that was the Curse-Breaker division. Unlike the surrounding desks stacked high with overstuffed case files and the odd Cursed object, Draco's desk held only the two tidy files he'd set aside on Friday evening and a roll of bright yellow parchment he'd never seen before.
“I was thinking about Christmas.”
Well good. Draco didn't suffer fools, no matter how fit or influential.
“Stay away from the sheep!” Draco barked.
* * *
* * *
“I think the holidays will be torture,” he murmured into Malfoy’s hair. “Why didn’t we figure this out months ago?”
Potter grinned at him.  “It seems appropriate.  What with you being in my bed and all last night.”
Draco sighed dramatically. “Yes, I suppose I did. Fraternising with Harry Potter and a Weasley; what has become of me?”
'You can unwrap me after the party when we have time to do it properly,' Draco said breathlessly. 'For now I just want you to get me off.' Harry pouted at not getting to see all of Draco yet, but relented to the wishes of the birthday boy. This would definitely not be their last time together, so Harry could afford to be patient.
"Fine. But in return, you don't tell a
children, not just Muggle-born. My parents were magical, but I didn't even know magic was real until my eleventh birthday!"
Pushing thoughts of hospitals from his mind, Draco focused on the way Potter's body writhed against his in time with their tongues.  Their hands grabbed and pulled at cloth and skin as they gasped into each other's mouths.
'Fuck, Harry. Oh. Gonna . . .' Draco was falling apart, sounding mindless and euphoric, and it was entirely Harry's doing.
“Really? Who is it?” Gwenna asked. Draco could see the glimmer of hope in her eyes. She didn’t need the hotel to survive. She didn’t need the money, and it meant her family home was constantly full of strangers, but she cared for Draco, Aida, Rosamund and Merryn, and she knew they all desperately wanted the hotel to be a success. Draco suddenly found himself wanting to fight for the hotel, too. He hadn’t realised he had given up until that moment. Until he saw a way to save it. Because if anyone could undo all the bad press Rita Skeeter had foisted on Hotel Kalmynsi, it was Potter. And he’d already volunteered for the job.
No, Harry was happiest watching.
Draco strolled into the inn halfway through dinner.  Harry wasn’t sure where he spent his days, but he managed to disappear from dawn until dusk, and it was driving Harry spare.  Whenever he tried to ask about it over dinner, Draco would change the subject by engaging someone else in conversation, and by the time they made it back to their flat after dinner, Draco refused to use their mouths for talking.
Potter shook his head. "No. No. Just … um … move it a bit?"
Potter choked out a laugh that almost sounded like a sob. Then his face suddenly became very serious as he surged forward and pressed his lips to Draco's. Even with their lips closed, Draco could taste the bitter wine on Potter's breath. His lips weren't soft, but they were warm and insistent in that moment.
The elegantly furnished London house fit Draco perfectly.  It was beautiful, classic, and undoubtedly incredibly expensive, but it lacked the intimidation and excess of Malfoy Manor.  It also came free of memories of torture and imprisonment: all good things in Harry's book.
Draco couldn't hold Potter's gaze. "I've never done this before either."
Potter in the months since they'd left Hogwarts. They didn't work together and, despite Pansy being with Longbottom, there was still little overlap in their social lives.
As they ate, Ron ignored Auror regulations around secrecy and filled Harry in on the case in front of Hermione.
Harry shook his head, beaming with pride at his own ingenuity. 'No. That's the brilliance of doing it today. If he suspects a party, he'll think it's next weekend.' His grin was pulling at his cheeks almost painfully. 'He's going to love it! I have cases of his favourite champagne and that posh new French place is catering. It will all be delivered once Draco's gone.'
He dropped to his knees and grabbed Draco's hips. The wool twill of Draco's trousers was rough and scratched at his hands in contrast to the gentle slide of Draco's fingers along the side of his face. He pressed one hot cheek into the coarse fabric and rather liked the sting of it against his sensitive skin. He remembered the feeling of rope burn on his wrists from Auror training and imagined being tied down as Draco used gentle kisses and soothing hands to contrast the burn of the ropes. His cheeks grew hotter as his spent cock began to stir at the thought.
"Teddy asked him," Harry explained. Yes, he threw an eight-year-old under the bus to save his own neck. "Scorpius said he didn’t have a mother."
“Well I’m sure you’ll enjoy yourself,” Potter cut in. “But you’ll have to excuse us.” He nodded at Merryn walking in with their main courses. Gabby took the hint and returned to her own table where Merryn had her apéritif already waiting for her.
“All right, back to work everyone.”  She shooed them all away, touching no one but Draco.  As he walked out the door, he could feel Sothman's eyes crawling over him.  When he risked a glance back, he did not like the look on the other man's face: it was as if the man were violating him with his eyes.
Fortifying himself with a deep breath, he continued down the road.  A glimpse of blue to his left showed that he was right on the coast.  Good.  More water and fewer houses.  It was still warm despite the sun nearly setting, and he could feel the ocean breeze against his chest and legs.  It was actually rather nice.  He could almost see the appeal.  Almost.
"There you are!" Potter called out as soon as Draco Apparated into Diagon Alley. He sounded relieved, and Draco wondered if Potter thought he'd been stood up.
Harry's knife wavered over the jam jar. Draco hated when he used the butter knife in the jam, but Harry was the one who'd have to wash up yet another piece of cutlery if he used a second knife. Fuck it. He dipped the buttery knife into the jam jar and breathed in the rich smell of damson plums.
“Lost?  The floor isn't that big,” he teased.
* * *
He scooped up his son and kissed him on the nose. "Hello, son. Have you been good to Auntie Astoria?"
"Tea?" he almost shouted as Draco thanked him for the meal and began to rise.
Harry felt his thoughts rushing around. How had he missed all that? Maybe he'd been told but had ignored it on purpose. He didn't want Padma to marry Terry Boot's older brother; she was supposed to marry Draco! Eventually. Then Harry would marry Parvati and they could all live together. It would be perfect.
It was amazing how easily Draco and the Weasleys settled into a routine. Draco cooked, cleaned, and laundered, and the Weasleys treated him … really well. Charlie flirted and George played tricks, but all of them made him feel welcome and appreciated. It was a bit frightening, but … nice.
Harry placed a finger to his own wet cheek and saw the grey eyes follow the movement intently.  Then he brought the finger, now wet with cum, to his lips.  He couldn't claim that semen was the tastiest thing he'd ever put in his mouth, but the thought that he was taking in Draco's own fluid made it erotic.  He licked his finger clean, watching Draco as Draco watched his tongue.  When their eyes met, Harry grinned at the disbelief and lust he saw in the large grey eyes in front of him.
"If I pour my heart out, can you keep a promise," he knew it was a stupid thing to ask, that Draco owed him nothing, let alone the promise of secrecy.
"If that's okay with you," he murmured softly, shuffling his feet with nerves. "I'd really like to make sure you get home safely, but if not, I can get you a taxi instead?" Draco didn't know where his nerves had come from, but it was a far cry from the confident stranger he'd spent his time with for the past few evenings, it was pretty adorable he thought.
"You've got that right, it definitely would have sucked!" Draco finished tapping away on his phone, thankful for the short reprieve from the rain coating his screen. With a sigh of relief he finished up booking a new taxi, happy there had been some free slots left, and prepared himself to head back inside the building.
"I'm stuck," Harry muttered, clearly embarrassed about the situation he had found himself in.
"I'm right here darling," James strolled through the main doors without a care in the world, "I was just outside testing the boys' brooms before they head back to school. Can't have them playing up during a big game now, can we?" He had the same carefree grin as his son, completely at ease and uncaring of how late they were going to be in leaving for the train, it drove Regulus mad.
"Thanks dad, really, because I absolutely want to hear about you two snogging!" Harry fake vomited, grossed out by their discussion. "Ugh, you're both disgusting!"
"I know it is Harry, but you need to get a move on! Uncle Severus won't stand for you making a fuss," he mumbled softly, deftly stirring the potion inside the cauldron was simultaneously reading from the recipe before them. Harry had never been more thankful that Draco was so talented when it came to potions, because he definitely made up for Harry's ineptitude.
"You gave me a Christmas present Harry, and a lovely one too, that makes us friends now."
"Someone booked this taxi for you, prepaid it too."
* * *
“Thuban, this is Potter. Potter, Thuban.” Harry felt like he should laugh at the formal introductions, but he remembered the lesson Draco had apparently learned well in third-year with Buckbeak. Thinking of the hippogriff, Harry bowed deeply to the dragon. The dragon lifted his head from the ground and regarded him with rainbow-coloured eyes that unnerved Harry with their lack of pupil and thus obvious focus. Finally the dragon gave a tiny nod and then ignored Harry to look back at Draco.
'It's still weird. When I lived with you, I bought a bed and put it in the spare room.'
“This here,” Jens had stopped abruptly in front of a minty-green building at the far end of the row, “is where you’ll be staying. Research centre down here,” he said as he walked in the main door and gestured to another door to the side of the narrow stairs in front of them. “Two flats upstairs. Charlie’s on the first floor with Pavel, and you and Draco on top.” Harry felt his cheeks go warm as they passed Charlie’s door and climbed a second flight of stairs to the flat he would be sharing with Malfoy.
"Is he breathing?"
heat of Draco's mouth as Draco looked up at him with eyes that informed him that he was Draco's for life.
"Would you like to try it on?"
He was still tall; even with Harry’s late growth spurts, Malfoy had a few inches on him. He was still slender, although he had filled out across his chest and shoulders so that his torso created an enticing V-shape as it tapered down to his slim hips.  And he was still pale.
Yes, this would be all too easy.
Harry barely heard as he realised he could feel the sharp hardness of Draco’s hip against his biceps. He wanted to grab that hip and use it to turn Draco to face him. Draco’s crotch would be right there. He would just need to part Draco’s robes and then he could see the way Draco’s trousers hugged him. They were probably expensive trousers. Perfectly tailored to display everything. Or maybe Draco didn’t wear trou—
“I filled out some of this paperwork for you.  If you'd like to look them over and sign them, I can file them for you.”  He gave her a sycophantic smile, and she smiled back.   She really is thick.
* * *
Jarred from his thoughts, he realised that the voice wasn’t Draco’s. He turned and saw Neville smiling at him. They exchanged pleasantries, and then Neville asked if Harry was waiting for someone. Harry couldn’t fight back his smile, and Neville chuckled.
Draco rolled his eyes, but knew he wouldn't make it back to Wiltshire that night. Best to just take a room at the Leaky and Apparate in the morning.
Some of his earlier panic returned as he wondered how content Draco would really be to wait. 'Presents are after desert,' he teased, trying to buy some time.
Draco’s eyes widened, showing more of their shining grey. "Well that explains it. Old man Snipter says that when he tried growing Squib's Friend anywhere near those big poles it wouldn't grow."
"Can I get you a drink, Harry?"
“Unless it’s in Devon.”
Potter looked him in the eyes. “It was really decent of you, looking after me and all. You didn’t have to. You could have ignore me as I’d been ignoring you, but you didn’t. You helped.”
Harry blinked in his surprise.  He hadn't realised how close Draco was and felt embarrassed for having pulled off just before he came.  Would Draco think he was squeamish about swallowing?
“Mine is bigger.” Harry turned to see Malfoy’s arched brow and slightly lifted nose. He laughed before he could stop himself, and a slight scowl darkened Malfoy’s face.
"Does this mean there will be no more unannounced visits to my home?" She sounded far too smug. She was
"I don’t have a mum either. I mean, I did, but she died."
“Well look at this.” Ron pulled out a newspaper and passed it over to Harry. The front page showed a grainy photograph of Draco Malfoy of all people under the headline: Death Eater Lures Unsuspecting Innocents to Remote Location. Further down the page was a dark photograph of a manor house on a stormy night briefly lit up by lightning before falling back into shadow. It looked nothing like the cheerful building in Hermione’s brochure, but Ron confirmed it was the same place. “The article says Hotel Kalmynsi is an old Fawley property, and the Fawleys married into the Malfoys. Anyway, Malfoy—
“How much do I owe you?” He suddenly realised that he hadn’t thought about whether Romanian wizards had a different currency.
Malfoy stood as still as one of his precious squirrels, his eyes darting around Harry’s face as he assessed the possible threat. His breath came out in a puff of steam, but he did not pull away from Harry’s touch. Harry was charmed by the intensity in his eyes, both inviting Harry to continue and threatening the consequences of a wrong move. Did Harry dare take that risk?
Ron looked from the pie to his wife and back again. His soppy expression stayed the same. "I don't know how she does it. It's as good as my mum's and she barely spends a moment in the kitchen."
have to thank
Determined not to be idle, Harry decided to Apparate to Snipter's Farm, Europe’s biggest supplier of magical plants outside of Italy. If the restricted plants were being bought legally, they were almost certainly being grown at Snipter’s. Rodney Snipter was the curmudgeonly old wizard who had been running the family farm for the past eighty years, but luckily for Harry, his nephew Reggie was far more personable.
Harry pushed into the bushes and could make out a shape in front of him. He wordlessly cast a spell to silence his approach and sneaked towards Teddy. The form grew closer and closer. Teddy must be crouched because he wasn’t as tall as usual. And he’d changed his hair to match the white of the mist. A decent disguise, but not enough to hide from Harry. Just one more step and he could … pounce!
Potter laughed. "You would focus on the timing, wouldn't you?"
From a cat.
“Why? You could get anyone to go with you? I’m sure there will be lots of single people who—”
Harry pretended to misunderstand. “Well, they will need to you examine and catalogue the plants on the farm. But that can wait until I am back on Monday.” He gave Draco a daft smile and enjoyed the heat of Draco’s glare.
Harry started to skim the most recent
Harry met Charlie’s eyes with a piercing glare of his own. “I can do it.”
'No.' Ron's face looked around the room. 'Is Draco around?'
as he paid the bird, but the paper in his hand was all in French. Poor bird must have flown across the Channel to deliver Draco’s paper. Harry shook his head. Crazy magical birds. He carried the paper back to the large bed to distract him from waiting for Draco to return.
Draco returned his smile.  Then he slowly, carefully eased himself from Harry's body.  He offered his hand and helped Harry stand on shaky legs.
* * *
Prying Potter's warm hands from their current spot at his waist, Draco gave him a firm and final kiss goodbye.
She explained that Harry had been Levitating Draco's coffin to the edge of the Burrow's anti-Apparition wards when he stopped to say his goodbyes. When he kissed Draco, he stopped concentrating on the Levitation Charm and the coffin fell to the grass where the impact knocked the piece of apple from Draco's throat to the front of his mouth. The Healer relayed all of this as she measured out a cup of goopy green potion and then poured it down Draco's protesting throat.
He felt his skin flush and his hands felt a little shaky. He hoped he was half as talented as Draco clearly was.
After they had eaten, Draco led Harry to the alley behind the pub. Instead of opening the passageway to Diagon Alley, Draco shoved Harry against a wall for the second time that night and kissed him.
Draco made his way to the bar, dodging a group of drunk and rowdy wizards on his way.  It was busier at the Hufflepuff's end of the bar, so Draco headed to the end tended by the toothless old codger who owned the place.  He asked for water for Potter and then ordered a double Firewhisky for himself.  He suspected he'd need it to babysit the soused Saviour.
N.E.W.T. level Care of Magical Creatures!” Harry blushed slightly as he realised he’d admitted to knowing Draco’s N.E.W.T. schedule. It wasn’t his fault though; all Hermione talked about for a year was studying with Draco.
All mirth left Draco's face. 'Trust me, that's not . . .' He shook his head and put on a smile that Harry didn't believe. 'Hermione has plenty to give me grief about.' Not work, but possibly related to Hermione, Harry noted.
Clearwater was a pain, but she was content to look and occasionally fondle.  She'd never actually tried to bed him.  Perhaps she had some respect for her position as Department Head and didn't want to abuse her power to that extent.  Draco was confident that Sothman had no such qualms.  Draco would bet his family fortune that the man would be trying to do far more than grope within a week of becoming his supervisor.
“Git.”
Draco looked dubious.  “It would be an impressive feat to Apparate that distance and change of altitude
The cottage wasn't huge, so it didn't take long for Harry to find them; their tenses voices were coming from the small room crammed with bookshelves that Draco teasingly called their library. Having found them, however, Harry couldn't decide whether to interrupt or let Draco fend for himself. It was Draco's party, and he could leave if he wanted to. Undecided, Harry stopped behind the door to listened.
Draco leaned forward with dark eyes. 'But I'm impatient. I think I should get to open this one early.' He ran his fingertips along Harry's belt.
Harry tried to ignore the warm, fuzzy feeling that came from Draco praising Harry’s idea. “How do we do that when it’s illegal to grow it?”
They walked into the magically expanded sitting room and found George, Angelina, Ron and Hermione sitting on two facing couches next to a handsome Christmas tree.  It was not a large tree—despite Arthur’s promotions, the elder Weasleys were not extravagant with their gold—but it was a nicely shaped tree, rich green, and decorated with dozens of spinning and singing bulbs.  Red and white candles burned brightly on the branches, helping fill the room with soft, warm light.
“Bloodrot Poison is named after its primary ingredient. Bloodrot, as the name suggests, eats away at human blood and tissue. The effect of ingesting it—whether in a potion or not—is similar to placing the digestive tract into a vat of acid.”
“You don’t have to be fine with everything he did,” Charlie said, as if reading his mind.  “You just have to call it the past and leave it there.”
"Harry, get out of here." George's voice was gentle but firm. Harry glared at him, but George just rolled his eyes. "Sitting around isn't your forte. You want to be out
Harry looked into those fierce grey eyes and knew he was well and truly in for it. He wasn’t going to be able to go back to London in a few days and put Draco out of his mind.
Harry swallowed again to calm his throat as he moved in front of Draco's new position. He took Draco back into his mouth and heard, 'Oh, thank god,' muttered above him. He pressed his hands firmly into Draco's hips to keep them in place and then tried moving his head.
Harry smiled. He sometimes wished Draco had become an Auror, too. They could certainly use his subtlety and charm. But Draco love cracking Curses, and Harry loved Draco being happy.
The front door opened with the roar of loud rain beyond, and Draco was jolted back to the moment. There in front of him, in the entry to Draco’s hotel, was Harry Potter. Draco hadn’t seen him in years, other than a newspaper photo or two, but there was no mistaking him. He looked as awkward as he had as a child, seemingly unsure what to do with his wet cloak and bag as he closed the door against the rain outside. Not that he was unchanged by the passing years. He was possibly taller, and his jumper and jeans under his traveling cloak clung to a form more developed than the half-starved looking Potter who had defeated the Dark Lord. His face, too, looked matured in a way Draco had to admit was flattering.
Harry Apparated them to a restaurant Charlie had recommended.  It was small and cosy, and Charlie swore the food was amazing.  They walked in to find a room with several small tables and a sign on a stand.  “Seat Yourself,” it read.  Harry shrugged and led Draco to the corner table in the window.  There was a sheer drape over the window that let in the moonlight and shadows but hid them from the view of the street.
Oh fuck! How was Harry meant to think with Malfoy saying things like that with his perfect lips?
"Pansy would talk me up to you?" That conniving witch. She
Draco pulled Harry tight, pressing his lips to Harry’s neck and cheek before kissing him hard on the mouth. "We did it," he gasped against Harry’s lips. "We did it." He grinned almost manically. "Let’s celebrate!"
to claim he's not your type, because I've
Harry ignored Draco’s proximity, instead doing his job. “What about sunlamps?”
Draco huffed out a laugh and squeeze Potter’s hand. “You romantic, you. I’m sure you can save me from other things, like your friends.” Draco felt his stomach drop as he wondered if Potter’s friends would talk him out of trying a relationship with Draco.
“I want to know who is responsible for this, and I mean
They arrived home hungry and sweaty, so they each took a shower—Draco first as he needed the extra time to dress and do his hair—before they headed into the village. Harry spent most of his time in the shower wanking; flying with Draco always left him half-hard. It was probably his Slytherin side getting off on the exciting competition.
'Yes,' Harry nodded as his cheeks heated. 'But . . . um, would you mind saving the éclairs for after the party?'
Harry didn’t know if they were clear, but he did know they needed back-up.
He kissed Draco hard and let his hands roam over the wonderful naked body in bed beside him. They both had morning wood, and there was no point wasting it. Draco responded eagerly, grabbing Harry’s arse and pulling him close until their groins rubbed together.
“Leah! You have to!” The woman from the West Country, Kensa, sounded afraid. “The hotel is run by a Death Eater! I know you aren’t from here, but surely word of the Death Eaters made it to the States. I can’t believe Jowan hasn’t brought this up himself. I don’t know what my brother thinks of sometimes.”
Potter was silent for a long moment, and Draco wondered if—for the first time ever—Potter was choosing his words. “I don’t deserve her marks because I don’t put the work in.” He stared right into Draco’s eyes. “And I wouldn’t say I could find a
He climbed from bed and saw he'd been left to sleep in his now-wrinkled shirt and trousers. Wondering what had happened to him, Draco went to find answers.
* * *
In the next room, Draco found his great aunt and mother seated at the large Elizabethan dining table that had once dominated Malfoy Manor’s second dining room and was now placed so closely to the sideboard Draco wouldn’t be able to fit into his seat if he were to gain two stone. He greeted what remained of his family as Bippy appeared and began serving dinner.
"You're disgusting." He tossed the parchment on his desk and unfastened his travelling cloak.
“I can think whatever I want and never worry about my dick giving me away.” Malfoy took a step closer to Harry, never breaking eye contact. Harry should break eye contact. He should look away. He should—his eyes fell to Malfoy’s lips just as he murmured, “I could be hard right now and you couldn’t tell.”
This was all a bit too serious for naked aperitifs.  Especially when the aperitifs were still missing.  "So you're breaking down barriers?  Is that why the lack of clothing?"
Potter laughed. “Get ready for more sex and some mushy pasta.”
He slid his cock in and out of Harry's body.  Pulling out until the head caught on Harry's rim and then slamming back in.  The heat spread through his body, and the pain bloomed into pleasure.  The tightness changed, moving to his balls, his stomach, all the way down to his toes.
* * *
All of this meant that Potter was still a virgin with no hope of reprieve on the horizon. If Potter—who must receive dozens of offers a day—couldn't get any action, then clearly he was completely helpless on that front. His virginity was a foe he could not vanquish. He needed help. He needed a hero to save him from his empty little sex life. He needed Draco!
He wanted to argue. He wanted to make her choose better than he had, but maybe it wasn’t the same. At sixteen, Draco hadn’t really felt like he was choosing; the Dark Lord had given orders and Draco had followed out of fear. Maybe Merryn deserved to make her own mistakes. If she made a horrible mess of her life the way he had, at least it would be her own doing.
The Aurors saw fewer people trying to deal out their own justice after that, and they had even gotten two decent recruits out of the dozens of

He pulled his fingers out of his arse and grabbed the dildo.  He lined it up with his entrance and then roughly shoved it inside.  “Move,” he ordered.  The dildo began to move.  “Deeper.”  He squeezed his eyes shut as he played with his own nipples, pretending it was Draco’s long, strong fingers twisting and squeezing at his sensitive flesh.
He reached Hagrid’s hut and felt a brief pang for how little he had seen his friend this year. They were both so busy: Hagrid with rebuilding the war-torn grounds and Harry with studies he had never fully focused on before. Looking at the hut, he noted the places that had been rebuilt and the scorch marks from when it had been set aflame. There was still work to be done, but Hagrid had clearly put the rest of Hogwarts before his own home. The puffs of smoke billowing out of the chimney suggested that Hagrid was home. Harry was there and undistracted by classes, as it was Saturday, but Harry turned away.
It was obvious, really. Why hadn’t Draco thought of it himself?
Nine o'clock found him already settled at his desk writing a report for Vane on the Curse he'd removed the day before.
“You’ve been avoiding me,” Harry was growing impatient and couldn’t keep the accusation from his tone.
Harry’s delight in scaring Teddy quickly faded as he registered the small size of the child in his hands. He cast Lumos and nearly screamed himself at the sight of a small boy who was clearly not Teddy.
playing housewife! Many of the world's greatest chefs—"
It must be a big case to require two fully-trained Aurors from the onset. The department was still rebuilding its numbers after the war, and Robards rarely over-allocated personnel for anything but raids.
Harry looked up from the latest memorandum on raid procedure and started considering possibilities. In vain. As usual, Ron couldn’t wait long enough for Harry to hazard a guess.
an arse since he discovered Draco baking soufflés. "Cooking is
The second they crossed the threshold, Harry Apparated them to his bedroom. Draco could think him forward, but there was no way he was going to sit and drink a cup of tea. Propriety be damned.
Draco nodded instead of replying and grabbed a sandwich to occupy his mouth. Potter passed him a glass of water which he drank without comment.
Potter's arm around his waist loosened. "Are you just making me squirm? Because I can't imagine you're racking your brain for a gentle way to decline."
"He does look amazing out there, doesn't he?"
go out for drinks. What happened to hating him?" she mocked.  It was a good question. Hadn't he disliked Potter only weeks ago? And yet now he found himself enjoying the man's company.
Draco raised his eyebrows but remained silent. At least he seemed willing to hear Harry out.
On Wednesday, Potter showed up all but shaking with anger, and Draco's curiosity overcame his stubbornness. "Break your favourite quill?" he drawled with feigned indifference.
Draco met Potter’s eye. Potter was clearly trying to calm him, his hands raised in placation. Draco wondered how much he knew.
Just falling.
"You can cook?" It wasn't accusatory or disbelieving; it was hopeful and slightly desperate. He usually ignored Draco on the rare occasions when their paths crossed, but now he was staring right into Draco's eyes.
Potter emerged from his shower and made a lot of noise in the bedroom. Dressing was likely a challenge for him given the awful results he usually displayed. Sure enough, Potter emerged minutes later in clothing intended for someone at least twice Potter's width. Surely shops would provide Potter with a tailored wardrobe for free. Why was he still wearing the same rags he'd always worn?
He stuck out his tongue and lapped at the head of Draco's cock. Draco's bucked and moaned. A hot rush of power went through Harry as he thought,
Harry tried to pull his mind back to the moment. Illegal production was enough to warrant a raid. He could send Draco to safety and get back up to secure the place. He could bring Draco back to do the search in the morning, in the light, with Ron and Fernsworth to assist.
you're talking to me? What, do you and Ron take turns?"
“And now?” Harry prodded gently.
Harry grinned at him.  “And you love me.”
. They’re meant to be the size of my ‘ead, right Mum?”
Draco wasn't sure what to make of it all, but he was sure it wasn't good. He wished McGonagall and Pomfrey would stop their furtive whispering and tell them what the fuck was going on. They stood on the other side of the Hospital Wing with their heads as close together as their Bubblehead Charms would allow. The fact that they wouldn’t breathe the same air as Draco and his group was further cause for alarm.
“What happens to the food that isn’t good enough,” Harry asked as Aida sorted grapes, putting misshapen, squashed, or moldy ones into a bucket.
The door was shut.
Draco stood frozen, his hand still holding the napkin he was setting on the table.
They walked side by side down the street toward the Leaky Cauldron and their world. The silence between them felt heavy, and Harry nearly jumped every time Draco’s hand, encased in soft cashmere gloves, brushed his own bare ones. His hands were freezing and he really should put his gloves back on, but he couldn’t give up that occasional contact, even as it was driving him mental.
"Harry thinks...they’ve never even met...how would he…" Yes, they had been at Hogwarts together, but Astoria spoke about Harry as someone she only knew by reputation. Why would Harry bring her up at all, let alone to Hermione?
“When I say go, run through the tunnel we started in. Keep going no matter what.” Harry cast a Blasting Curse at the ground in the direction of the attackers and dirt filled the air around the greenhouse door. “GO!”
* * *
*  * *
“Yes, still here.”  He smiled with the fondness he felt for his feisty, beautiful bedmate.  And then he began to move.  He started slowly, still too afraid of causing pain, but soon built up speed.  One hand gripped at Draco's thigh whilst his other stroked his cock.  It wasn't easy to keep his hands and hips in time, but the concentration helped Harry delay his own orgasm.  He was determined that it be good for Draco and that he come first.
Draco was completely shocked.  Harry Potter had basically just confessed to falling in love with him and thinking about spending their future together.
your body through this mess. How am I meant to flatter your figure when I can’t tell what it is?”
Charlie rolled his eyes and winked at Draco.
Dave, the only Muggleborn on the team, had said more than once that Bârlog should simply install some Muggle technology. He'd pointed out that Muggle villages at similar altitudes had telephones and internet that allowed them contact with the rest of the world. Harry was inclined to agree, as a telephone would allow him to hear Hermione's worried tones or Ron's rough laughter.
Right. The race.
Aamu has never had a child, but she has felt the fear of a mother for her child before. She knows what the pale woman fears.
"Reckon they are the only ones who'll have him," came Ron's voice before he walked into the room. "They have Aurors to keep an eye on him." It was the usual talk, but there wasn't much feeling behind it and Hermione didn't even throw anything at him.
He stepped back into the hallway and saw Draco waiting for him.
“Oh look!  He's so very sorry,” she'd mocked.  “Honestly, Draco.  You're looking for a shag not a bridegroom.  Who cares if he runs off to work mid-dinner?  He still paid, right?  So get your shag and get over it.”
had led her to believe. If not for Rita Skeeter, she would likely not be in such a state. “How is he ruining it? It sounds like everything is set to have the wedding at his hotel.”
"Shall we practice?" Potter's voice was friendly, a tone Draco had heard often when Potter spoke to others. Draco nodded and stayed very still as Potter bound their legs.
“But you didn’t even ask!”  He rolled onto his side and mirrored Draco’s pose.
“And three dates in one day is perfect compliance?”
* * *
“Jameson was an idiot for not playing more aggressively,” Draco began again once Rosie was back behind the bar and out of earshot.  “Everyone knows the Spanish Seeker likes it rough.”  Draco purred the last three words in a way that caught the attention of Harry's whole body.  The conversation had turned to the national teams and the English Seeker's performance against Spain.  Harry was so engrossed in their debate over tactics that he had completely forgotten that he was skiving off a stake-out to be out on a date.  So it surprised him when the communication coin in his pocket began to burn.
It was the photograph dominating page 15 that made his breath draw short. It was of a group of wizards and witches gathered in a garden bursting with blooms. Front and centre stood Draco with his arm around a pretty, young woman. In the woman’s arms was a small boy with hair as pale as Draco’s. Despite the baby-fat softening the child's features, the resemblance to Draco was striking.
“Believe it or not, it was the Dark Lord.”
Draco smirked at him. 'It's
Draco was still thrusting inside him, but his cock was no longer an intrusion.  It was part of Harry's body, moving in rhythm with his heart beat until it stuttered and stopped.  Harry coaxed Draco through his orgasm, kissing his face, rubbing his back, and whispering sweet words about how gorgeous Draco was and how amazing he felt.
Draco had vanished from sight again. Harry scanned the room, but did not see Draco's distinct pale hair.
“You’ll respect my decision. Whatever it is?”
“I should have seen that coming. Have you been together long?”
"You've made a mistake," Draco said through the heavy door that all but hummed with defensive magic. "No one arranged a fitting."
“Oh, I’m sorry. Should I have sent my calling card first? Perhaps a letter of introduction?”
It was amazing. It was the best blow job of Harry's life. Okay, it was the only one, but Harry couldn't imagine that
A cloaked figure entered first with her large hood obscuring her face. An elderly woman judging by the small wrinkled hands clasped in front of her. Next was a stunning witch with dark almond eyes and shining black hair that fell down her back so perfectly Harry could hear Hermione’s voice in his head, muttering about Sleakeazy potions. The last person to enter was Draco Malfoy.
"Why am I in a coffin?" His voice was too high and he thrashed his limbs as he sprang to his feet.
"Not usually, no. Not since Ernie, and that was mainly just curiosity about … well about kissing a boy. This was—is—about … you. You aren't like the others: wanting to talk about Voldemort or when I'll be Minister."
He was taking Malfoy apart, making him moan, and curse, and tremble.
The sun was trying valiantly to fight through the clouds, but it was still grey and misty. Harry didn’t care. So long as there wasn’t lightning coming down from the sky, he was taking Teddy to the park. The night before had been maddening with Teddy climbing the furniture and refusing to go to bed. The boy needed a long run around and some fresh air to get him back to his usual sweet self. Harry hoped Andromeda was enjoying her weekend off because she had looked exhausted when she’d dropped Teddy off Friday night. And that was with Teddy at school much of the day.
"It is to me."  Malfoy's eyes burned and Harry wished they'd made it into whatever room held the drink Malfoy had offered.  "Growing up, I learned everyone's surname because their family was what made them important or not.  Or so I thought at the time.  It was a way of classifying people and maintaining a barrier between myself and others."
allowed himself to appreciate just how attractive Potter was.
Draco smirked.  “That seems more plausible.”
“It’s not big enough, I tell you,” she scolded, although she sounded more amused than angry. Her voice was too loud as if her joy wouldn’t be tamped down.
* * *
When Shacklebolt and his minions had finished waxing poetic, Potter dragged Draco toward a cluster of tables and tents. They threw rings over bottles and small balls at jugs. They drank a sweet juice made of apple and elderflower that tasted like summer and nibbled on baked goods that were surprisingly good for having been made without magic.
Draco faltered at the remorse in Potter's eyes. "What?"
Harry could feel his smile explode across his face. "Any day you want. Just owl me. Do you like Italian? I’m good at French, but you’ve lived there for years so that’s too intimidating." He was talking rather fast, but his words seemed to want to keep pace with his pounding heart.
"Well, then, we need to get you eating a bit more because this door isn't even quivering Harry," Draco sounded exasperated, yet nervous, clearly unsure as to what had happened and how they were going to free him.
He prayed that it was Theo cooking, he dreaded to see Harry's reaction to another night of Draco partying and 'drinking away his life and future'. He knew it was somewhat true though, he had allowed the success of his bands record deal to sweep him away. He had been rocketed to stardom, radios playing his songs, his voice on repeat, television shows constantly wanting interviews. The fans would scream his name, begging for a signature and an autograph, and Draco gave them it all, and yet it came at a price.
"Nah go ahead, it's a free country after all," there was a cheeky tone to his voice that did nothing to hide the deep curiosity regarding the mysterious stranger that seemed to continue popping up around his workplace. Draco didn't know whether he should feel nervous as to whether he was being stalked, or grateful that he seemed to save him in some way every time they met. "So, you frequent this part of the city often?"
"Understandable I suppose. I love you, more than anything. I honestly could see us getting married one day, living in a cottage in the countryside, or maybe a manor because I know that's more your style." Harry was gazing at the walls, as if he couldn't bear to look Draco in the eye as he told him of his dreams for a future together, as he admitted everything he had wished for them to have. He knew the pain it would cause, to hear about his dreams and know they would never come to reality, he tortured himself with them every day, constantly wishing things could have been different. "I could envisage us adopting children, going on holidays and living happily together for the rest of our lives."
"Pretty much every evening I've got shifts, and then uni for most of the day. It's exhausting, but necessary, so I make it work," Draco explained. He thought nothing of his work schedule, it was pretty tiring to keep on top of everything, but Draco knew that he had no other options, so he made it work and he always put his studies first.
"I know it isn't anything special but -"
"You deserve to have someone look after you every so often, you work too hard," he spoke firmly, resolute in his decision.

"Eat that and then breathe, you can't keep stressing so much Draco. You need to delicate out your tasks more, you can't be a one man mission anymore. Now, how does it taste?" Draco glared at him slightly before chewing and swallowing, he pulled a considering face before licking his lips to remove a stray splash of sauce.
Since his early days Draco had changed, truly taking on the rockstar persona, unable to separate his on stage persona with the man he once was, the Draco that was shy and caring, that would cuddle and kiss his boyfriend just to show him how much he loved him, no matter the time or palace. And yet now he pushed Harry away, pretended that he was single to lure in the fans, acted as if the one and only man that he could ever love wasn't waiting for him at home. Laying there waiting for his boyfriend to come home, alone inside the mansion of a home Draco had purchased on a whim. A show of his new found wealth.
"If you want me, then I'll never leave you alone again Harry."
The man nodded his head, and parted his lips, Draco waited for him to speak, but seeing that he wasn't, quickly flashed him a smile before hurrying back through the rain and inside the bar. The mysterious stranger was back for a second night in a row, and Draco couldn't help but to think how cute he looked tonight, bundled up in a scarf and thick waterproof coat.
"I'm willing to give it a second chance, but we both have to put the effort in, because I can't do this again Harry. I look an utter mess," reaffirming his words he wiped at his face with the sleeves of his robes, soaking them in his tears with a look of utter dismay and disgust. Draco hated to show emotion in general, but he especially hated it when he looked weak. He supposed that was something that stemmed from his childhood and the way he was raised, under the critical and ever watching eyes of the Pure-Blood Society.
"Alright, that's enough James, stop teasing the poor boy," Regulus admonished him, sneaking a glance out of the corner of his eye, he made contact with his husband, sharing a sneaky grin. "Although he definitely has a point, the things we would get up to on that train." He spoke so innocently, but the intention was clear as his eyes shone with mischief.
"You broke up with me Harry, I thought everything was going fine, I was in love with you, and you ripped my heart out and stomped all over it. You broke me, I'm actually broken," it was as if saying the words out loud finalised them in Draco's mind and he began to sob, muffling his tears in the blankets he had surrounded himself with. His arms wrapped around his chest as he tried to contain his pain, to hold everything in until he was alone. He couldn't allow himself to fully breakdown in front of Harry, he didn't want to show him how much pain he had caused.
Widened eyes looked up in utter bewilderment, making contact with another pair, except those were not filled with shock, but instead, calm and completely uninterested (yet Harry could not see the hidden intrigue as they watched his every reaction). This was clearly a normal aspect of a Wizarding Christmas celebration, something that Harry realised he was going to have to get used to. That didn't make him feel better when his clear lack of Wizarding knowledge was being broadcasted to the rest of his classmates.
As the rain continued to pour harder, soaking him through his thin shirt, and rendering his jacket useless in regards to protecting him, a figure seemed to appear out of nowhere. The man moved close enough that Draco could see it was the stranger who'd saved him the day before, the man with the emerald eyes, and in his hand was an open umbrella, shielding him from the downpour.
Drabble Prompt - Day 10) Hope
"Yeah I'm Draco, why?"
"Why are you telling me this, are you trying to hurt me even more?"
"Shut up Potter," he paused for a moment to rake in the gift, "it's truly exquisite. I still don't understand why you decided to give it to me though," there was confusion in his voice as he fingered the soft material with a contemplative look upon his face, questioning the intent behind such a gift.
"Are you trying?" Harry yelled, watching the door as it stayed completely stationary.
"Please, please can we try Draco, all I'm asking for is a chance. A chance to try and see if we can do it again, to see if we can be us again. Surely that's worth a chance at saving." If begging was what it took to be given that chance, Harry was willing to get on his knees and beg for the rest of his life, he needed Draco back in his life, as his only pillar of strength. He had never realised how much he had lent on Draco, how much support he provided him with and how important his presence was within Harry's life. He was the only person who truly knew and understood Harry.
As they parted, the air between them was thick with tension, neither knew what to do. With a gentle kiss to the hand, the stranger turned and left, a light in his eyes that Draco had never witnessed before. Draco hurried inside, ensuring total privacy before allowing the biggest grin to spread across his lips as he threw himself onto the threadbare sofa. It was everything he had wished for, and he couldn't wait until Monday to do it all over again.
Those dreams were forever banished to the backs of one anothers minds, to the deepest depths of lurking love and lusts. The deepest and darkest of their secrets never to be revealed in their lifetime. No one would allow for a relationship to blossom and flourish between the boy-who-lived and the prospective death eater. They had no choice but to hide their feelings. Forever contained in secret meetings, passion filled embraces where the lust would overtake them, where for just that one moment, that one second of time, they could pretend that there was nothing wrong with what they were doing. That they had the option to live a life together filled with romance and public displays of their affections.
"Please go and do that, and do it quickly!" Faint muttering was all that reached Harry's ears, as he assumed that Draco had trundled off to go and get help. Harry leaned against the door, letting out a deep and resigned sigh as he slid to the floor in a heap of exhaustion. Gazing at the clock on the wall, he watched as time continued to tick by without him being rescued. All he wanted was to be curled up in front of a fireplace with a mug of hot chocolate, not trapped in the smelly and cold changing rooms, alone and bored.
Sunday evening had finally arrived, and with it, came Draco's only day off from both university and work. He finally had the chance to curl up on his rickety old sofa, wrapped in a collection of blankets and catch up on his programs from the week that he'd missed because of work. A steaming mug of tea in one hand, and the remote controller in the other, he flicked his way through the channels.
"I'm stuck," Harry finally yelled, letting out a sigh of embarrassment, as he buried his face into his hands, "The door is jammed and I can't get it open, so I'm stuck in here!" There was silence, before Draco began to snicker softly, trying to escape Harry's attention.
The pair had attended intensive therapy before they even reached the point where they felt comfortable being in public together as a couple. There had always been a mutual attraction, but they needed to know that they now felt the same way regarding the world. Draco was willing and wanting to change his beliefs, if they could even be called his, having been taught from such a young age, he knew nothing else. Neither of them had expected such a backlash upon surrounding their decision to date, even with the obvious and noticeable changes in Draco's personality, thoughts and actions. Everyone thought that Harry had been forced into it, that he had somehow been strong-armed into dating his childhood enemy. The amount of rumours that circulated posing the question of whether he had Imperiused Harry was astounding.
"I'll be seeing you soon, don't worry about it," he nodded softly before turning to head off down the road, calling over his shoulder, "get home safely too!"
Harry found himself becoming antsy as he waited for the perfect moment to present itself. Consistently, he had looked up throughout the dinner only to catch the gaze of Malfoy before ducking his head and avoiding eye contact for a few moments. It was hard to try and remain inconspicuous when it seemed that most of the people at the table wished to speak to him, to know more about the boy-who-lived, and where he had been for the past ten years. Harry just desperately wanted the dinner to be over so that he could find some way to catch Malfoy on his own and resolve things between them for once and for all.
Draco froze. "Do you want me to stop?"
at the Ministry during the week,' he grumbled, 'we must spend our
Harry prevented Draco from sitting up with a hand on his shoulder. "The Wizengamot will take as long as they like. We may hear today. We may not. We may not hear until next week." He knelt down and stroked Draco’s hair back his brow so he could place a gentle kiss there. "You and Hermione presented a very strong case."
to be taken back?  Do you think she could . . . forgive . . .”
In the days leading up to that morning’s hearing on D.U.M.B., Draco and Hermione had fussed and fretted over every bit of expert testimony and legal precedent, at the cost of everything else. They only ate because they could do it while pouring over law books. They both fought sleep like an enemy, leaving Oliver and Harry with grumpy partners who wanted nothing to do with them if it wasn’t to help with D.U.M.B.
The man stepped back.  Whether he recognised Potter, a drunken idiot, or just uneven odds in a fight, he turned and walked away.
