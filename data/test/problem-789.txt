“From… I… I’m in love,” he rasped, his palms suddenly sweaty as he clamped tightly the piece of paper. “With you. I’m in love with you.”
Whenever Harry tried to open his eyes and talk he'd feel his strength give way and a heavy weight settling on his eyelids, urging him to close them again and go back to sleep.
Draco glanced sidelong at Potter, his frown, his sad half-smile. He felt his chest constricting and needed to make him happier, right now, right this minute. “You can have it.”
They would always meet directly at the restaurant so that Draco and Harry could have the time to get ready from Hogwarts. They were usually on time, but tonight they needed to be organised for what they had to tell their wives.
Draco scrunched up his nose at the way Julienne’s voice emphasised the word ‘affection’. There was no way he’d go home with such a slimy man.
Thanking all the powerful wizards in history that the mobile still had a few bars of battery power, Harry immediately swiped on Hermione’s notifications, aggressively plastered on the screen: ten missed calls.
You crook your fingers further in as you suck harder, angling your head so that your throat opens and you can take him deeper. He gasps, pulling at your hair, hips twitching, trying to push his cock harder into your mouth and to fuck himself on your fingers all at once.
A lame punch line like that one shouldn’t have worked, Harry knew it. The truth was, though, that Malfoy’s line wasn’t the only thing that drew Harry in.
“Not so fast, you idiot,” Harry said, rubbing his back in slow circles. “Thanks for the banner, by the way.” He smirked. “Very thoughtful.”
“What, more than once? Way to go, buddy!” Theo raises his fist in front of Draco, ready to be bumped.
Draco blinked once, realising he was clenching his wand in the holster secured to his thigh, probably an involuntary reflex. Relaxing through his breaths, he left it. It had been useless for a long time, now, anyway. Instead, he brought his hand to the pendant under his shirt, and smiled again. People were clapping: it was good. Good.
“Hey!” Potter protested, still sitting on the floor. “Don’t I even get a little fuck?” He raised an eyebrow, firmly grasping his hard-on. “I’m already prepared, you know.”
Harry’s eyes widened and his lips stretched into the most beautiful smile Draco had ever seen before he shot forward, grabbing Draco and tugging him into his chest. He slid his arms around Draco’s waist, resting a hand on the small of his back. The heat of it burnt through the thin layer of Draco’s t-shirt, and Draco felt more alive than ever.
Draco sighed, putting the pen down between the pages of his notebook. His head was pounding madly. He brought his fingers to his temples, massaging them.
Harry kept staring at her, waiting for the rest of the sentence. '...a bond of gigantic bacteria' maybe? '...a bond-ing on the bed virus'?
“Like what? Tell me and I’ll do them,” Harry blurted out. His hands reached out to grab Malfoy’s waist— it was almost as if he wasn’t the one in control of his own body. The more Malfoy talked, the more Harry needed him, needed him to tell Harry exactly what to do, what to say, what to think.
Or when Malfoy, the touchy bastard, would briefly hug Harry, or pat his head, or brush his lips against Harry’s cheeks. Harry would just combust, his blood scalding him from the inside.
They did this every time: dance around each other, exchange tooth-rotting compliments, hug, blush and exaggeratedly laugh at each others’ jokes. Draco had tried millions of times to make them see there was something between them, but they had always brushed him off, because “Draco, she’s just a friend!” and “I don’t know what you’re talking about!”
There was a moment of silence in which Malfoy’s eyelashes fluttered. “Fuck, I should hope not,” he said finally, shifting on the rug.
Harry’s blood rang in his ears, reality and memories fusing in a unique feeling, the one of Malfoy’s body pressed against his.
You freeze, drink in hand, as Potter’s lips part in a smirk. He gestures with a finger to call you closer.
“I honestly don’t remember, I don’t know what to say,” Harry starts. The room falls into a silence so deep Harry fears for a moment everyone’s disappeared. He opens his eyes: they’re all still there, expectant eyes and raised eyebrows.
Harry asked for a hot tea without anything to eat, receiving raised eyebrows from his best friends. He was usually famished when hungover but this time, Harry was restlessly shifting in his chair to try and ease the itching on his skin and his stomach was still churning and turning over and over again — he really didn't feel like eating.
With Teddy on his shoulders, he reached the room, heart thrumming with excitement. But as much as that ‘Dray surprise’ could have made Harry imagine, when he entered his jaw dropped and his breath caught. The walls were animated by magical drawings all over, fairies, dragons, stars, planets, everything a kid can dream of was there, magnificently painted in meticulous details and vibrant colours.
Pansy nodded, scrunching up the torn page and Vanishing it. “I agree. People keep sending me notes on who they think the chef might be, but there doesn’t seem to be a consensus or a link. And I still don’t understand why someone would hide their identity when they’re clearly well-liked and talented.”
“Okay… What about a story about two kids. They never got along when they were younger, on the contrary. You could define them as enemies, but they had a lot in common. Born in different families with different circumstances, they quickly learned that they had a clearly defined path in front of their selves and that they couldn’t escape it.”
"My father said it made me look too feminine and always straightened it. I simply never broke the habit."
“Do you think this is normal?” Potter held Lady Luck close to Draco’s eyes for inspection, but Draco couldn’t distinguish anything abnormal and his head was hurting too much to focus on something so close anyway.
Why he remained silent every time Harry would smile at him, or look at him, or just give him any attention, making him feel like he was the centre of his universe.
That’s why he was so nervous when he arrived at Dromeda’s. Draco still hadn’t arrived, so Andromeda left the instructions about where to find food, how to change diapers, the right temperature for baby food and such, to Harry and then went out with Narcissa. They were trying to rebuild their relationship.
. Right. They felt shorter in Draco’s head, trapped in his thoughts, his fears, his misery. The composition came to an end, fading away. Draco opened his eyes, covering Pansy’s hand on his shoulder with his own.
Draco braced himself against the wall, digging his fingers against unyielding plaster, listing all the names of his forefathers in alphabetical order to avoid coming on the spot.
Should he ask Potter out for a drink? Talk about their lives, chat about what they’re doing here in Bacalar — and by the way, how was it even possible they found each other here and never crossed roads back in London where they lived?!
Harry sucked in a breath, trying not to panic at the memory. That had been a moment during their living in Muggle London that he really wished he could erase from his memory.
Draco couldn’t hold back the inelegant snort that escaped. Potter really liked to take their games far, didn’t he? Draco cleared his throat in a desperate attempt to hide the discomfort in his voice. “Then I’ll sacrifice a life of sex for a life full of magnificent food. I’m sorry, but that’s the most important thing.”
Malfoy glared at Harry. But the effect was ruined when all through his little speech and angry gestures his face had turned blotchy red, which it only did when he was embarrassed.
Draco watched his movements, drawn to the wet sounds of Potter’s tongue against his own lips. Merlin, he was completely fucked. The erection he had painstakingly subsided came back with full strength, tenting his pyjama bottoms.
“Congratulations,” Potter says, a pitch too high. He laughs maniacally. “For your wedding. You must be happy.”
It had always been like this, for the last thirty-five years. Draco and Harry had found themselves co-workers at Hogwarts, teaching respectively Potions and Defense Against the Dark Arts. They were both newly married, and it had been hard at first to get along.
that I’m in, er, love with Potter.” Draco poured some more wine into his glass. If he was seeing Potter tonight, it really wasn’t advisable to keep drinking like this, but he didn’t dare broach the Potter topic while sober.
“I…” his voice too sounded like he had just drank half the water of the ocean. “Could you lower your wand? I don’t know what… It’s not. It doesn’t usually
The January air was particularly cold, and as soon as Harry's fingers started feeling numb and condensation formed on his glasses, he cast a weather charm, that wrapped around him, warming his body and unfogging his lenses. He turned to look smugly at Malfoy, who looked back at Harry with raised eyebrows and perfectly cool skin, unbothered by the cold air.
Once at the table, they said their greetings to Astoria and Ginevra — all the while Draco was trying to avoid emptying his stomach on the table, right there. He took a deep breath and sat down, his hands trembling visibly. Astoria gave him a perplexed look, that he tried to brush aside offering a weak smile and a wave of his hand. She didn’t seem convinced, and with good reason.
And when he finally did, it was to find Potter squirming in his seat, his eyes trained on the wand, his hands fidgeting in his lap, his bottom lip caught between his teeth. It almost looked like… he was interested in it? Potter turned to Granger, who lightly shook her head. It seemed to settle Potter, who nodded once and flicked his eyes to Draco.
Harry gulped a big breath, trying to steady himself. A couple of giggles escaped him again as he redirected his gaze to Malfoy’s eyes which were fixed on Harry’s cock, hard and wet against his own stomach.
Astoria hid her head in Scorpius’ neck, and he looked sadly at Draco, the anger seemed gone. “Of course, we will. But we’ll need time. Oh! Do James, Al and Lily know about this? I think today they have brunch together.”
An hour before the opening to the public, Blaise made his appearance at the Manor. He was wearing one of those white suits he owned in an alarmingly wide range. He knew white enhanced his physique and complemented his skin colour, so he would never miss the occasion of looking smug in one of those.
No. He didn’t spend nineteen years at Draco’s side to throw all to the bin for a stupid fight. They’d solve this one too — after all, their situation wasn’t the easiest, it was normal to have such arguments, right?
They had done activities before this, loosening Draco, who was now stuffed with a plug and ready for Harry. The idea of Draco sleeping with a fucking dildo shoved deep into his arse made Harry’s head spin and he finally undressed too, placing himself between Draco’s sprawled legs. He slowly pulled the plug out of him, staring as Draco’s hole fluttered around it. The movement made Draco whimper and Harry couldn’t resist but thrust his fingers in, wanting to make this last for as long as possible. He dragged his fingers in and out of Draco’s hole a couple of times, circling the rim when pulling them out completely, marvelling at the way Draco’s body kept shifting, trembling, the way his breath hitched or his mouth opened in faint moans.
They all gathered around the dinner table where sweets and appetisers of all sorts were splayed in front of Harry who laughed heartily and started eating and drinking with his friends.
A second later he’s pulling the second gift out the bag. It’s an anal vibrator, you recognise it even if it’s a Muggle one.
“Draco, your father is dead. Someone has to take over the Malfoy line, and that someone is you. You will marry the young Greengrass, you will come to live here, and you will have a male heir, as it has been planned since your birth.”
Malfoy glanced up at him, then down at the cauldron again. “We could play a game.  ‘I’ll tell you mine, you’ll tell me yours’.” Malfoy’s cheeks turned a bright red as his eyes widened. Briefly, his eyes found Harry’s again, and he muttered, “I don’t know why I said that. It was stupid.”
"I told you, Harry. Your grandfather made the best hair potion in the entire Wizarding World and there you are, a bird's nest on your head."
An involuntary grin stretched Draco’s lips and he leaned on the table of his lab, cocking his hips. “Potter, do I see a pattern here?”
Malfoy laid down on the bed next to Harry and pulled him to straddle his lap, never taking off his eyes from Harry’s face. He brought a hand behind his neck and drew Harry closer, whispering to his ear, “Tell me if it's too much.”
“Huh.” Hermione reached for the bread at the centre of their table. “Gosh, I love this restaurant.” She smiled, crooking her head. “Harry, darling, is there anything that happens before you feel like this that could be triggering it?”
“What!” Harry bellowed, making the orange juice he had just sipped go down the wrong pipe and causing him to break out into a stream of coughing.
“Hmm,” Potter mumbled, eyes glinting. “So, this is the moment where you ask me if I want something to drink, I refuse politely, and then we go to your bedroom and fuck each other senseless?”
Something veiled Potter’s eyes and his smirk dissipated, leaving space to a blank mask. “Right, well… I found this little champ at the beach and some locals told me… Wait, you’re a magi-zoologist?!”
“I don’t know how long the spell will last but if I understood correctly, it’s meant to kill the slave if they try to run away. It’s kind of like orders keep them… alive.” Malfoy paused, taking a deep breath. Harry could only imagine how the magnitude of the spell was weighing on him. Before he could tell anything to Malfoy, anyway, he spoke again. “I honestly have no idea how often I need you to give me orders, though, and I learned how to cook the muggle way after the war.”
Malfoy cocked his head, looking at Harry with an expectant expression. Harry licked his lip. “Pour us two glasses of firewhiskey.” Honestly, Harry hadn’t foreseen, couldn’t have possibly imagined how easily he’d get into this commanding dynamic.
Harry exhaled loudly from his nostrils and nodded, muttering something Draco didn’t quite catch, but that sounded a lot like ‘ugh, women’.
When the hell did Draco Malfoy become so good at reading him, anyway? Harry let out a deep sigh. He realised with horror that tears were prickling behind his eyelids. “Look, I… love being an auror, helping people, being
Opening the door and seeing the shower made Harry moan in anticipation of a restorative moment, immediately undressing again and stepping under the warm spray.
“Yes,” Malfoy ground out, narrowing his eyes. “Although, actually, I hadn’t finished the potion, so I’m not sure about the effects. Maybe it will wear off quicker, or maybe slower, or maybe… maybe we should go to St. Mungo’s,” he concluded, straightening his shoulders.
Turns out twenty years are quite a lot, but thankfully, the memories from the time they’d found Jacob and Louis were still intact. A few instructions and the Aurors were able to find them and bring them to St. Mungo’s where Harry and Draco were impatiently waiting for them, the adrenaline of the moment amplifying everything.
The wooden canary softly sang the half hour: 11:30 pm. Potter looked up at it and smiled. Turning to Draco again, he extended his elbow. “C’mon.”
“It’s not. I know, okay? I’m sorry, Potter.” Draco scuffed a hand on his face, closing his eyes, and when he opened them again, it was to find Potter looking at him with an astonished face.
He chuckled and, trying to avoid Draco’s glare, he turned to hug Pansy. “Gorgeous. You’re absolutely gorgeous, my lovely. That dress is perfect for you, your beautiful body will turn some man mad tonight!” He kissed her cheeks, making Pansy’s blush extend toward her collarbone.
Potter snorted, amused. “This is a Muggle song! I know it, Hermione is fixated with the movie… wait… ah, what’s it called…”
"Well, I guess the git has a bloody beautiful smile, mate." Ron snickered next to Hermione, glancing at Malfoy's picture.
.” Harry glared at Hermione and she shrugged, bringing a finger to her lips and miming as if she was zipping them up. “As I was saying, I’m worried I may have— I don’t know. Used my Allure to pull him in. Herm, you should see the way he looks at me sometimes, and—” Harry groaned, burying his face in his hands. “He keeps saying it’s the last time we’re going to see each other, because honestly, it’s me and him. We don’t make
They both gasped and Harry raised his knees, planting his feet on the bed, digging his fingers in the soft flesh on Draco’s hips, knowing he’d leave bruises and smiling because that wouldn’t be a real pain, but something welcomed.
Mr Serkin stopped, startled from the sound of Potter’s graceless fall. Weasley was helping him get up — laughing as he did — while Granger probably scolded him, judging by the look of disapproval that crossed her face.
Perfect time to set up everything: he arranged the rose petals on their bed, helped by Boo-boo who floated next to Harry, helping him decide which candles to light and where to place his gift for Draco — in the end, they put it exactly in the centre of the heart of petals he formed on the bed.
“I’ll go. If you don’t hear from me in the next six days it’s because I’ll be away for work. I’ve decided I need to find motivation elsewhere.” Potter sighed dramatically, his eyes closing as if already imagining the next few days.
Draco raised an eyebrow, scepticism creasing his forehead. “Obviously. And you know this because…?” Something clicked in Draco’s mind, his heart skipping a beat. What if…?
When Malfoy’s mouth opened to reply, Harry didn’t let him. “And,” he said, holding out a hand, “we need to test how long you can go without an order, and if that changes in case the order is of a different… nature.” Harry bit his bottom lip, snapped his fingers. “You don’t need them when you’re asleep, I guess.”
interesting.” Pansy winked at Ginny and turned to Malfoy, lightly shoving his shoulder. “You’re too silent, darling. Have a bit of fun with me, here.”
“You know he’s right. You are being courageous. And if our mighty saviour says so, you have to believe him. Draco… you should talk with him. It must mean something that he’s the only one that triggered some sort of magic out of you in all these years.”
He had known Malfoy could be witty and sarcastic, but he had no idea it was one of the traits he found most attractive about him.
Twenty years. Twenty years with Draco Malfoy, nineteen of which they spent in love, touching, craving each other, whispering endearments, learning each other’s bodies and souls by heart. Was it their limit? Nineteen years was the expiration date on their relationship? Harry closed his eyes as several other tears joined the first one and the rain started pouring furiously, drenching him.
“Draco! Don’t worry, you were busy. In the end, we did a really good job with the curse-breakers, don’t you think? Everything is beautiful, safe and in order again. In addition, I made sure that protective spells and wards were in place so that people wouldn’t go wandering outside the festivities area and messing up tonight’s event.”
Their time together flew by and soon it was evening. Andromeda tried to insist that Malfoy stay over for dinner, but he refused, saying he had to go back to his mother. Malfoy’s
“You’re asking me if I wanna come! Oh for Salazar’s sake, of course, I’ll come with you to an event with plenty of stellar food and renowned chefs.” He paused for a bit, thinking. “Wow, do you think Greta Catchlove will attend, too? I love her cheese casserole.”
“You’re begging. You’re actually begging. That’s hot,” Malfoy breathed. A second later, as fast as they’d come, all the thoughts about pleasing Malfoy and urging Harry to do anything he could to have him, disappeared.
With the last strands of sanity left in Draco, he inhaled deeply and looked around themselves, frowning slightly.
“Tori… what… I didn’t… let me finish!” Ginevra tried to go on but everyone in the room was now gasping or muttering things and the chattering was too loud.
He just stood there, staring down at Harry, arms crossed on his chest. Whatever he thought he was doing wasn’t working because—
On the contrary, Harry seemed in need of a friend more than ever, relishing in their chats about being a father, growing up, taking up responsibilities. And in the end, two years later, Astoria was pregnant too and Ginevra again with a second child.
Draco smiled a crooked smile from his position several steps above her. He wasn’t at all sure it would be fun, but she was right. The Manor did look different under the natural roselight of the sunset.
"No." He repeated, calmer. They've had this argument too many times, and it always ended in the same way. It wasn't worth getting angry all over again.
Trying to gather his control, Harry left the package on the floor, next to the marbles, and picked Teddy up, lifting him above his head and peppering his face with kisses.
For a moment there was a silence so dense in the room it could be cut with a knife, when Hermione continued her speech again.
The air finally cleared and Harry took in a big gulp of air, opening his eyes and only then realising he had closed them. Malfoy’s achingly beautiful face came into focus and Harry couldn’t possibly contain the grin that spread on his face.
And then Malfoy’s coming, coating all over his chest, kissing Harry and Harry feels the first signs of his cock swelling and swelling again, pushing against Malfoy’s walls.
Of the thousands of scenarios Draco had imagined for tonight, not one was even remotely as good as the reality. He snorted, incredulous.
Five years. Five years terrified of having contact with other people, spent imagining all the worst scenarios in case his old classmates discovered he didn’t have his magic anymore, spent fearing confrontation with the great Harry Potter, and now this. Maybe it was the adrenaline of the events of the night, of how differently he felt telling his ‘big secret’ to someone, to Harry, but now he couldn’t restrain himself anymore.
Harry’s heart was exploding at hearing Draco calling him ‘love’ endlessly and he felt a lump forming in his throat — he didn’t know what to say, what to do, he stared as Draco undressed himself and climbed onto the bed, straddling him, returning to kiss every single centimetre of Harry’s body.
He was gazing absent-mindedly into the void when Andromeda playfully shook him. “You get along well, after all, Harry.” Her voice seemed to have a hopeful tone, rather than the flat one she had assumed after the Final Battle.
ed the black rope, his favourite. “Then I’m going to tease you,” he continued and this time, a long dark green feather flew into his hands. Harry’s breath hitched in anticipation.
“I desire you, honey,” he whispered, each word causing a spark through Harry’s body, raising goosebumps on his skin.
“Dromeda… why is Teddy’s hair so…” Harry struggled to find a word until nothing better than, “Malfoy-ish?” came to his mind.
“You’re such a drama queen. I ask myself every day why I’m still friends with you.” Pansy shook her head and took one slice of garlic bread, taking a small bite. Draco smiled, remembering the first time they’d come here and Pansy’s disgusted face.
“Are you telling me you don’t read my magazine?” Her tone was light and amused, but Draco knew it was a way to contain her disappointment.
They spoke together as their gazes met and held. This wasn't possible, right? It was just too much alcohol. Yes, Draco was probably still tipsy from last night and hadn’t realised.
“Pansy’s the one who made such a big deal out of them, involving the entire Wizarding world in the research!”
The first time they’d done this, it was by accident, and Harry wondered just how many things in his life could happen like that, by accident.
had sounded unattainable, the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, the One Who Conquered and Killed the Dark Lord, the One Who Would Never Fall for the Former Death Eater— then Harry was an entirely different story.
“Confunded you, I know,” Draco interrupts and now he’s biting on his lips so hard Harry fears they’re gonna break.
Harry murmured the preparative spell and Draco’s cock thickened even more at the feeling of Harry’s magic pushing inside of him, tickling his nerves. With a second spell, the dildo was lubricated, and the tip brushed Draco’s entrance.
In the Auror Department people had different opinions. Most believed the Veela gene had skipped Draco, while others began blushing whenever he wandered by their offices, or happened to meet them in the lifts. A few even tried to shamelessly flirt with him.
He didn’t talk about it to Draco. It wasn’t like they were prudish — on the contrary, Draco had confessed to Harry he liked to be dominated almost immediately, to Harry’s delight. He loved being in charge, getting to decide exactly how and what to do, Draco pliant under his touch, pliant when Harry knotted thick ropes against his chest, pliant stuffed with a plug in his arse all day long.
?” Honestly, Harry was starting to lose his patience and the fact that he was hungover and famished didn’t help any.
“One you’d really like to ride.” Draco raised an eyebrow from behind his large glass of wine, feeling the alcohol add to his already inebriated senses.
. Only thinking about those insinuations, got Draco all warm and tickly and oh no, no, no, this wasn’t at all the right moment for that goddamn tickle to appear…
Veritaserum, why do you feel the need to use it? Can’t you fucking be honest for once in your life without any extras?”
cast an illegal ancient bond on me and so now I'm no longer in charge of my life again… this idiot isn't findable anywhere and, what does that mean anyway? And why are you still calling her Granger? And why did nobody think of waiting for me to wake up to… to…”
Harry looked at him, at his knitted eyebrows, his intense stare. “I do, I believe you. And… I never stopped loving you either.”
“Am not!” Harry had said, burying his face in Ginny’s shoulder. They were having dinner at Ron and Hermione’s, and Ron was telling everybody about Incident II, because obviously life was cruel and Ron had been at the field with Malfoy that day.
"Mmmh. We met someone. A ghost of a kid, he didn’t tell us his name, only to call him Boo-boo, and he said something about
“Fuck,” Harry whispered. He grasped Malfoy’s ankle, watching the action as if his hand had moved by its own volition. He watched as he stroked Malfoy’s skin, marvelling at the velvety feeling of it. The bottle of firewhiskey levitated in front of Harry and his glass was immediately full again; then Malfoy’s too.
Malfoy climbed on the bed too, parting Harry’s legs to sit in between. He trailed his fingers down Harry’s thighs, feather-light, stopping at Harry’s hip bones. He smirked, then curled his fingers and Harry’s muscles clenched as his teeth sank into his bottom lip.
For Christmas, you want all but to spend the holidays with your mother. Your father’s dead, kissed by the Dementors, and she’s trailing towards insanity day by day.
“Potter,” you say, nodding. Up closer, Potter’s even hotter: the first thing you notice is that he’s not wearing his glasses. If you thought you’d ever seen green, you were wrong. He’s also wearing black eyeliner, which highlights his eyes and makes you salivate, and a shiny red lipstick that looks completely ruined. Like maybe he’s drunk too much or someone has smudged it with a kiss.
To Malfoy. What a wild concept. Harry wasn’t sure he could handle saying something different from their typical conversation, which had consisted of things like,
“Look, Malfoy…” Harry trailed off, suddenly aware that he had no idea what to say. When Malfoy didn’t move an inch, Harry went to sit beside him. “I’m tired of pretending.”
“Fifty percent of the people think the chef could be African, forty-six percent think they might be Asian…” Draco quickly scanned the results of the poll. Pansy was right. He tossed it onto the table, scowling.
Draco’s mouth hung open, and his eyebrows raised up to his hairline. “You didn’t know you were a wizard until you were eleven years old? Are you fucking kidding me?”
The realisation left him gasping for breath. Pansy smiled, crooking her head, as if to say ‘I’m here, it’s okay’. Draco blinked, then blinked some more, before finally breathing again.
Harry’s breath faltered and goosebumps ran down his spine while Malfoy turned his head, nodding to Harry, still delicately singing…
“I’ve spent the entire match staring at your arse.” Someone should definitely put a stopper on your mouth sometimes. But Potter seems to like it.
Back in school his friends would talk about weddings with the perfect pureblood girls, kids, and a castle-like house with a big garden. Draco would listen to them, knowing he should say something along similar lines, but only able to think that he really wished he didn’t have to marry a girl. Girls were gross. If he had to choose between Blaise and Pansy, he would have chosen Blaise a thousand times.
“I mean, you have it all,” he went on, helping Harry rise and sink again on his cock, Harry’s strength abandoning him for the effort of not coming, “What more could I give you?”
“Me,” you pant. Why the hell are you even speaking at this point? “I’m the whore, eat me,” you mewl. Pathetic.
They’d been there for the last eight years. And those years were the best they’ve had in their time-travelling, so Draco tried to draw some conclusions. It appeared that the travelling was linked to them in some way — the more relaxed they were, the longer they stayed in a precise timeline and place. Usually the change happened when they had a fight, most likely about the real possibilities of getting back home one day.
Malfoy raised a brow but didn’t comment on it. “Right, so… Should I go back to my potion…?” He straightened and brushed his hands on his scrubs.
Draco snorted, closing the book in his lap. “I want you to know that I fully regret giving you free access to my flat.”
Turns out strong alcohol, sun and hot tanned men going around in their swimwear all the time can fix almost everything.
He was about to look away when Potter’s chair just… vanished. It vanished, making Potter hit arse-first the floor. Draco involuntarily snorted, watching while Potter’s face contorted into one of pain and then surprise.
He shrugs. “Both.” He sits next to you, takes out the liquid lipstick from the bag. “Here, let me…” he whispers as he grasps your face. “Part your lips.”
Just when he had decided to grasp Potter’s face and snog the fuck out of him, Potter retreated, face flushed, eyes heavy-lidded.
Draco sneaked a hand under their table to stroke Harry’s thigh. “Can you believe that we had a house together and we didn’t even know we loved each other? We are idiots.”
His voice was rough and he subconsciously shifted his hips, rubbing his cock against the pillow. Harry’s heart skipped a beat and he took a deep breath.
When Ron left, Harry became intensely aware of how empty his last two days had been —if one didn’t count scorching hot sex of course— and the air felt suddenly too dense to breathe regularly. If that was how Harry felt after two days, how could he go on like this for … who knew how long?
Harry reacted as he always had at that, shivering in Draco’s arms and moaning loudly, his hips bucking against Draco’s hard bulge. Draco’s hand flew to Harry’s arse, grabbing it, losing all semblance of composure.
“I don’t know,” Harry said, his voice petulant like a kid who’s been asked what he did at school that day. “I feel like a… like someone,
Damn. Did he wake him up? Did the potion wear off too soon? Harry stopped with his cock buried deep inside Draco, and held his breath. He glanced at Draco’s face to find him with his eyes shut, teeth sank into his lips. He didn’t look awake.
“We’re not going anywhere!” Harry said, a weirdly happy feeling settling in his chest. “You’re attracted to me? That’s what you’re saying?”
Draco needed to know and felt his curiosity starting to get the best of him. He opened his mouth when out of the corner of his eye, he saw Pansy dancing with Blaise. Right, he needed to talk with Potter.
Harry snorted, returning his eyes to Draco. “Fuck, Draco, if this is what happens when we kiss, I can’t imagine what it would be if we were to have sex.”
He needed to stay calm but he could feel panic starting to rise again and it usually didn't lead to anything good.
Harry snorted, feeling like a stupid teenager who laughs at stupid sexual innuendo, but also couldn’t help it. Malfoy’s cheeks tinged deliciously red, his eyes bulging out of his head.
“I—” Harry paused. This wasn’t how he had wanted to bring the topic up, but the Veritaserum ran hot under his skin and it was urging him to finally tell Malfoy. “I still have your wand. Still use it, sometimes.”
You turn him around, make him stumble until he’s face-first against a tree. He’s bucking his hips backwards, already panting. Everyone should see him like this, you think. So you say it.
“Err, nice to meet you, Florence. You’re not gonna sing love songs too, are you?” Potter snorted quietly, side-glancing Draco, who narrowed his eyes at him.
They would chat a bit, and Draco would ask Potter to take a coffee together, for old time’s sake. Potter would say yes — he always said yes to Draco, right? — and they’d end up flirting, teasing.
Because Harry hadn’t felt it. He had grown wings on his back and talons on his hands while something positively
“Kreacher is so happy! A Black in the house, again! Kreacher will cook breakfast for you, sir, just—“
“Oh, shush. Listen, Ron, you don’t need to do anything. Salazar help me, for reasons completely unfathomable to me, Pansy is already impressed by you. Just ask her out. And maybe help her with her polls.”
He unbuttoned his jeans and pushed them down just enough to make his cock jut out, already hard and slick with pre-come. He aligned it with Potter’s hole, moaning at the sight of the pink furled skin fluttering around his cockhead, invitingly so.
Harry nodded, trying to remember when he said so, but coming up with only the memories of Malfoy’s lips on his ear, neck, Malfoy’s hard cock pressed against his, his body sliding on his, his low moans the only sounds Harry could recall.
Harry had gotten drunk almost immediately, despite Hermione's reproachful glare, and had started to flirt with a couple of blokes who were friends of Rolf's. But as far as he could remember, he didn't sleep with any of them.
Harry fucking Potter is flirting with the barman in one of the thousand Muggle pubs in London and he looks like sex on legs.
Malfoy kept lapping at Harry’s nipple, circling it with his tongue, lightly grazing his teeth on it as the hand at Harry's hip started moving and a finger was suddenly brushing the hem of his pants, slowly tracing a line from one hip to the other.
“I’m home!” he said, and it was all it took for Harry to immediately feel relieved. Harry felt his shoulders relax a fraction while a suspicious warmth spread on his cheeks at hearing Malfoy calling Harry’s flat ‘home’.
And it was in that moment that Harry knew it, he knew something was growing inside himself towards Draco that he couldn’t stop anymore, like a snowball picking up more and more snow in its fall, getting inescapably bigger as it rolls down.
And so here they were. Draco looked like the most precious and beautiful thing to ever walk on Earth, sleeping so peacefully, murmuring and lightly shifting on the bedsheet.
“It seems that our time-travel, that this is kind of… predestined?” Draco said, looking at Harry warily.
Harry straightened from under the desk, smoothing his hands down his uniform. The cheerful feeling was still lodged in his chest.
Draco blinked a couple of times, still trying to reconnect with the world. He could feel the burning of the after-sex, mixed with a deep pleasure which made Draco feel content. He yawned, mumbling, “Was ‘sleep.”
Harry realised his mistake the moment Seamus opened his mouth to speak again, his eyes quickly glancing to Malfoy. “I dare you to suck Malfoy’s fingers.”
Some lime juice was stuck on the corner of Potter’s lips, and whatever spell had hit Draco that night was still in effect because the next thing he remembered he was leaning in and licking it off with his own tongue. Off Potter’s lips. It was unhygienic, dirty, filthy and damn, so fucking hot.
Harry was already lost in the pleasure that sparked from every thrust of Malfoy’s finger, already followed by a second one. He laid his forehead on the wall and murmured, “I only had you, only you, Draco. After the War, I-I was with Ginny, and then… One date, but… no one was you, no one
Astoria was silently crying, tears streaming down her cheeks. Her body was shaking with her sobs and Draco’s heart clenched at the sight. He’d never imagined he’d be the cause of her sadness. He reached for her hand on the mattress and stroked it. She let him while wiping off the tears with her other hand.
Draco snorted. “I know, I know, that’s why I did it. I like your dress, it’s… radical. Love it. I’ll see you later in the evening, then?”
“Because I didn’t! Florence! No… Just, before, we were talking close by my great-great-grandfather’s portrait and he started doing so…”
“Okay, so I told you I’m stuck at ten years old, guys, but I’ve been around for forever, I know swear words and
Suddenly tears flowed freely down his face without Harry realising it and he flicked his wand with a snap, extinguishing all the candles at once, vanishing the petals, leaving only the acrid scent of blown out candles and a few trails of smoke the only thing visible in the sudden darkness of the room.
thing to order Malfoy. Fuck, he wondered what that told about him. Most decent human being, Ron had said. Somehow, Harry doubted that.
“Besides, it was a waste. Why have a ballroom with no balls?” She tugged at Draco’s hand and pulled him towards the centre of the room. Draco let her guide him, following on unsteady feet. The glass windows reflected the light inside, faded rainbows showering the walls. One of the windows was open to the garden, a soft breeze coming in, once again the sweet fragrance of the lilies and jasmines invading Draco’s senses.
“What!” Harry said with a surprised laugh. “I’ve travelled by dragon, it can’t possibly get more dangerous than that!”
The breeze of the evening came in once again, bringing the scent of the flowers, soothing Draco’s soul. The wireless started playing: it was one of Beethoven’s waltzes. Draco smiled at Pansy, sliding a hand on her back and taking her left hand in his right.
He was munching on his chocolate bars, sat on the bed, a blanket pulled up to his neck. Harry was eating a strawberry muffin, sitting next to him.
’s there, sitting rigidly on an armchair, legs bouncing nervously. He sees you and his mouth curls into a grimace, full of hatred.
In a flash, Harry realised Malfoy hadn't come yet and made to grasp his cock, but he gently batted his hand away.
“I am sure you can articulate something even with your little Gryffindor brain,” Draco snarled, his hot breath tickling Harry’s collarbone.
Harry laughed, lifting his arse as if to fuck himself on Draco’s fingers. “Always so posh,” he muttered, almost breathless. “There.”
The room suddenly sunk into golden shadows. It was getting closer to sunset, and the orange-y colours made Malfoy’s skin glow.
Harry braced himself against the wall and pushed back, sighing in relief. After a second, Malfoy’s hand landed on his other cheek, smacking deliciously, making Harry shiver.
“It… I think something’s wrong with its legs or maybe… its sight, err,” Potter stuttered as his cheeks tinged light red. It looked incredibly cute on him and Draco cursed himself again.
Ginevra raised an eyebrow and looked at him. “Why, Malfoy, it seems you’re troubled tonight. You never drink alcohol before the food arrives.”
"This is not a hangover, Mr Potter, as you should have realised by now. When you arrived here three days ago—"
In a couple of steps, Draco reached him and took off his shoes too, advancing enough to be ankle-deep in the ocean.
Harry looked back at Malfoy, his legs trembling with the effort of holding back his impending orgasm, a plea in his eyes.
Harry laughed at that— a deep hearty laugh, with his head thrown back and watery eyes. “You’re such a git. Honestly, I’m surprised it took you that long to figure it out.”
Harry blinked three times and then finally dropped his gaze to his own coffee. "No. Why should I? I hate him."
Harry watched Draco’s back as he walked away, his shoulders tight in a nervous line. He and Boo-boo stayed together for the rest of the morning — Boo-boo kept telling Harry he needed to fix things with Draco, that he was probably only scared by the situation, that they could overcome it.
Potter’s tongue slid further down Draco’s shaft, pressing lightly against the swollen vein that ran the length of it. Fuck, Draco could already feel his legs trembling from Potter’s ministrations and breathy moans against Draco’s cock.
Harry stopped laughing and looked at him again. The lights of the fireworks crossed his face, dancing on it, playing with his breathtaking smile, reverberating on his eyes, his piercing.
That night Harry cried for the first time since the War. They were angry tears, tears full of rage, heavy, burning on his skin.
They moved on to different topics, but the thought of Malfoy remained stuck in Harry’s mind. He really wasn’t that obsessed with him, right?
Draco made a horrified noise, while Potter just cocked his head, thoughtful. “Why isn’t she in the portrait with you? Why… why are you ‘Mrs’?”
With a deep sigh, Harry sat on the bed. A voice inside his head was screaming that this was wrong, all damn
He closed his eyes, letting his other senses guide him. Laying his head on the shoulder of the second Malfoy, Harry begged. “Let me c-come, Malfoy… p-please…”
“I am not asking you to be supportive right now, I’m just telling you because I needed to come out of the closet and be honest with all of you. I hope we can face this. I’ll leave you with your mum, shall I? We can talk another time.”
Harry looked at Draco’s hair closely — the electric blue was almost completely worn off and his roots were completely blond.
That was not the worst of the problem, though. Once Ron and Hermione left to go home, promising to visit him the next day, Malfoy had turned serious, looking solemnly at Harry.
Their eyes met, Draco’s mind going blank as he registered Potter’s blissful expression. Sometimes, Draco wondered if he really ejaculated cream.
“Hey buddy, how are you feeling? I’m so sorry for what happened, Rolf is mortified, you know? He couldn’t come here before because he’s outside England for work, but he said he’s gonna do all he can to track Jacob down. He really didn’t seem the type and… wow, I’m sorry, I’m speaking way too much.”
In hindsight, Harry knew he should have told him about it; they always negotiated everything together, they had rules and safe words, and this felt like breaking their equilibrium. But thankfully Draco appreciated his initiative, confessing to Harry that the idea of giving him total control over his body turned him on so much he asked for more. He easily accepted Harry’s fantasy, asking only to avoid penetration.
“Err, I actually transform into a white wolf.” Harry took a deep breath, tilting his head to the moonlight and closing his eyes. It was reassuring, calling gently to him as it always did since he transformed the first time.
Harry buried his face in his mug and in no time, his glasses fogged up. Not being able to see Malfoy’s face gave him a boost of courage.
Trust Pansy to insert at least one dirty word. Without even realising it, Draco held his breath. This clue was really too close to his own thoughts after he heard Harry cooked all those dishes from Sweet Prophecies. But it couldn’t be, could it?
Geremia's sneer widened and he all but gloated. "Then we'll do one more, longer this time. Hermione suggested for you to go back further in time, to New Year’s Eve. If you can confirm your story, we'll dig deeper into it."
Making themselves decent for when the others would come back, they sat on the couch. Harry rested his head on Draco’s shoulder and placed a kiss there. “I remember that time, by the way. You said you wanted to suck my cock… and even after all these years…”
The memories were abruptly interrupted when the car came to a stop next to an isolated cottage in the middle of what one could only call a forest. By the overgrown look of it, it was probably long abandoned or in disuse.
He closed his eyes, arching his back off the bed, sinking his hand into Malfoy’s hair, trying to disentangle his other hand from Malfoy’s grip.
Malfoy started moving inside of him, teasing him with slow thrusts, taking out his cock until the tip rested against Harry’s hole and then waiting for it to spasm and for Harry to cry ‘fuck me, love’ before pushing in again.
He mutters under his breath a quick, “Whatever,” and finds himself in an empty corridor. Checking that no one is in sight, Harry fishes out the Marauder’s Map from his school bag and immediately spots Draco’s label on it.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows and took a quick glance inside the box too. He snorted incredulously, his eyebrows now flying above his hairline. Everyone started to talk at the same time.
Draco’s eyes snapped to him, a mix of anger and giddiness settling in his chest. “Potter!” He said indignantly, dropping his eyes to the turtle again. “We haven’t seen each other for what—”
Harry felt his face and ears warming up at Dean’s suggestive tone, especially at his emphasis on the words ‘under’ and ‘care’. Everyone was snickering and giggling and Harry rolled his eyes, trying to be subtle.
It wasn’t nearly enough. It almost killed Harry with want. But it was everything they had and Harry would be damned if he’d let a few sparks scare him.
He kissed and bit and licked, nudging Harry behind the ear, the lobes, trailing kisses on his cheekbones, his jawline, biting on his collarbone. Harry groaned, pushing up toward Draco, feeling their cocks bumping, and trembling at the new feeling. He dreamt of this for so long, he couldn’t believe this was true.
“Stop this chit-chat! Dad, would you care to tell us what’s happening?” Lily was still hugging Ginny and helped her to sit down, threading her fingers in her hair.
“Oh, c’mon, we can do it.” Harry grabbed Draco’s elbow and dragged him into the dining room of their beach house.
The hand that was gripping Harry’s hair left, sliding to his ear, lightly stroking it and then Harry’s chin, pulling his face in front of Malfoy’s. His fingers traced imaginary paths all over his face until they arrived at the corner of Harry’s lips.
“And we had to extract Draco. We were able to locate the base but of course they saw us, so that was useless— they’d run away already. Problem was, in escaping, one of the Scarlet Tribes tried to cast this bond on Draco. I don’t know, I guess to control him since he was the mole or… well. Couldn’t let it happen, of course.”
“You’re a git,” Harry murmured, astonished. Was it really that? Jealousy? “And now? Me and my Auror adventures?”
They had lived everything in a dreamlike way, discovering they were in Sweden. They stayed there for an entire year, from December 1997 to December 1998. Harry remembered exactly where he was in that period: hunting Horcruxes with Hermione, hopeless, cold, desperate. A few dialogues with Malfoy and Harry knew he didn't have good memories about that time either.
“I’m sorry,” Harry rushes to say, interrupting Draco’s flow. “I don’t like Zabini.” He takes a deep breath, two, three. He can’t hold it back anymore. “I love you, Draco. I really do. And yesterday, it meant the world to me.”
!” He grinned his breath-taking grin and fidgeted with his shirt, revealing a sleepy Lady Luck in his breast-pocket.
As he listened to the faint noises of Malfoy in the kitchen and distantly registered that he, what, could cook, Harry’s mind started to drift off. All the information was definitely too much but most of all, he still had no idea what the extent of the spell could be.
James was breathing calmer now, his attention fully drawn to Harry; Albus lightly patted his shoulder and Lily kissed Ginny’s temple. Harry had no idea what else to say to his children — it wasn’t like they should know everything like he owed Ginny.
It made Harry blush. It made him happy. But for fuck’s sake. Harry wanted to see him lose that fucking composure.
That was when Draco took Harry to visit his childhood home, a big Manor similar to the one in London; telling him how he had spent the first six years of his life there, and then always came back every summer. It was currently 1985, past-Draco was five years old and they snooped around the French household under the Invisibility Cloak.
As he said it, a mirror appeared on the wall they were fucking against and Harry let out a delighted squeal. “Oh, you beautiful, beautiful bastard.”
“Hey big fella, it’s always like this with dares. You didn’t say anything when Bulstrode dared Nott to kiss you…” Seamus raised an eyebrow to him, daring him to try and contradict him.
He was flooded with images of Potter lying on his face, drinking down Draco’s cock as one would drink a glass of water… Potter lying on his back, eyes half-shut in post-orgasmic bliss. Draco sighed, resigned to his already half-hard cock.
There was no way Potter took Draco in his arms, brought him to his bedroom, stayed the night without having sex, and cooked breakfast the morning after. It broke at least
Malfoy's scrutiny was too funny and he didn't mind explaining to him about beer, polyamorous relationships and jeans while watching Malfoy's face scrunch up in horror. "This is all so Muggle…" Malfoy whispered, having the good grace to blush and add, "Yeah, sorry, I'm sorry, okay?"
“Right. Er—” Malfoy tightened his grip on the flask, pouring ten drops into the cauldron. “When I was eight I had an imaginary friend named Harry Potter.” He blinked hard as Harry burst out laughing. Malfoy’s cheeks grew even redder. “Salazar, why the fuck did I say
“I don’t believe you,” Harry said out of desperation. “If that’s true, then show me your real powers.”
He kissed Malfoy again, his mind already spiralling with thousands of thoughts — it would be hard to build something together again, it has always been so complicated between them.
He sighed and turned his head, finding an empty bed — Malfoy went back home, as per usual. He scratched his eyes and extended an arm to grab his glasses on the nightstand, finding a note next to them.
On the third time he added his teeth; it was only a graze, quickly followed by his soothing tongue as he mercilessly lapped around Draco’s cock.
Harry turned to him, placed a kiss on his neck. "Me too," he said. "Shall we go, er, somewhere we don't risk other people seeing us?"
“No!” Draco almost shouted, then felt his cheeks aflame with embarrassment. He added, more quietly, “No, don’t say it. There’s no me
“Yes,” Harry said amused. “Your tale, the one about how you captured the heart of the most renowned chef of all London? That’s true.”
Oh. Whatever version of Veritaserum Malfoy was brewing, it was too much. It was switching from being a tool for Harry to being something else. A way out. A free exit.
And then, the day travelling by the hot air balloon Draco now knew how to conjure, the picnic at high altitude, with Harry’s favourite wine. Landing on the top of the
“I wanted to make sure.” Harry shrugged, secretly disappointed he didn’t get to see Malfoy spinning around like a ballerina.
“Oh, you’re here! Listen, we’re going to the pub. You need to have more fun in your life. We’re meeting in ten minutes. Bye!”
Draco set the flute on the table, and turned to head toward Potter, who had disappeared. Everywhere he looked was Potter-empty. Scowling, he decided to seek out Bill and Fleur anyways to say hi and he’d get the opportunity to talk with Hermione too, as she had joined them now.
Geremia clapped his hands. "Great! You're not supposed to know what it is, it’s our secret project; wouldn’t it just be
Across the Thames there was an entire wizarding neighbourhood that was completely new to Harry. He walked through the streets with wide eyes — it looked pretty much like a greener and healthier version of Diagon Alley, with parks everywhere, magical creatures walking the streets like it was nothing, restaurants for everyone's tastes at every corner.
But when a gut-wrenching pain spread throughout his entire body, threatening to make Harry faint, he clenched a hand on his stomach, doubling over.
A sudden noise of explosion startled Harry, who tore his eyes off Malfoy’s to look at thousands of little shards dispersing at his feet, around the floor of the room.
“You laugh and you look so carefree and you don’t have to do anything else but laugh,” Malfoy’s voice was soft against Harry’s cheeks, a soft contrast to the tingling that was running through Harry’s entire body.
“See, as soon as they understood you had a bond, they called me in. It wasn’t hard to discover who cast it and what kind of bond it is. In the past, it was used on betrothed people, to help them get along. Jacob probably thought that once awake again, you'd fall in love with him and forgive him for what he did. Instead, something went wrong and when the Aurors searched for his traces in your memory, he was… gone, disappeared. His name was scattered everywhere in your linked magical cores, but he Obliviated everything that happened between you two from your mind."
Pottery, specifically. Was it ironic? Did Ron and everyone else make jokes about it? Yes and yes. Was Harry happy about his choice? Also, yes.
Your eyes roam to his white shirt, so transparent you can see his tight, dark nipples, to his leather trousers: they look painted on him, there’s no room for the imagination.
Thoughts of long lost times, years ago. Draco had just turned eighteen and the repeated seventh year at Hogwarts was coming to an end.
Draco sighed loudly, cursing under his breath. How was it even possible that the more he looked at him, the more Potter’s skin seemed to glow, fucking
As soon as the words were out of his mouth, Draco realised they were the stupidest thing he could have possibly said. He sealed his lips and scrunched up his face, waiting for the scathing reply; but it didn’t arrive. Instead, Potter stopped walking, and turned to face Draco, an indecipherable look on his face.
Harry was scratching the back of his neck. “Honestly, I don’t know. But we can’t tell them off, now. Ugh, that’s
Draco spent the entire, exhausting morning staring at the door of his office, wishing he could implant one of those televisions Potter was so fond of to distract himself.
Harry looked as Malfoy's face drained of all colour — as if Malfoy's face could be any paler — and his jaw twitched in a visible effort to play along with Hermione's words. Malfoy’s lips stretched in an emotionless smile while Geremia's lips mouthed a silent 'wow'.
You grip his waist harder —you’re sure you’re going to leave some nasty bruises there— and push all the way in, holding your breath. He’s holding his too, stomach taught, hole clenched.
These fantasies always ended up with Draco under the cold spray of the shower, trying to resist the urge to imagine having sex with Potter again, slicking him open with his tongue, fucking roughly into his puckered hole as he’d squirmed and begged for more.
He turned, grabbed the handle of the door, opening it and entering the room. He wasn’t ready for the pang of nostalgia that hit his stomach, thousands of images filling his vision.
The glasses of wine were served first. Hermione sipped hers before sighing. “Well? What do you mean ‘squirmy’?”
“You’re welcome.” Harry heard himself speaking with an affectionate tone, feeling his fingers itch to touch and reassure Malfoy, help him feel better, stroke his hair, his cheeks.
Draco felt himself blush at the question, as if his leaking cock against Harry’s thigh wasn’t a good indication of how much he was okay with it. He sighed and rolled his fingers inside of Harry, brushing his sweet spot and marvelling at the way Harry’s eyelashes fluttered half-closed, the way his teeth sank into his bottom lip.
It’s not a question. Your cock is now fully, achingly hard. Sex with a stranger in a pub bathroom sounds dirty; sex with Potter in a pub bathroom only sounds dangerous.
Harry froze, his mind racing. They never had to reaffirm their rules, they were ordinary habit by now. What the fuck did the prat have in mind?
Scorpius got up from his seat and crossed his arms. “What the fuck, Dad? With Harry? He’s like another dad to me! I call him
“I hate you,” you add in his ear for good measure. Before you can drop your head to his neck or his chest again, he captures your lips with his.
“Or worse! The fireworks would set themselves off in my pocket while we were in the air and we’d be dead before the balloon could even hit the water! Two explosions! On your
The rest of Draco’s words were lost. Harry’s mind finally clears and his head stops pounding so that now every thought is connected to the previous one and memories start flowing back to Harry.
“Malfoy,” he says, broken. You can’t hold the tears in anymore, and start crying like a baby as he goes on, “I hate you. But,” he takes a deep breath, his fists tighten. “I need you. Malfoy, do you hear me? I need you.”
"Idiot," Harry retorted and brought a hand to their joined groins, grasping Draco's cock and pushing it in til the head slipped completely in and they both groaned.
A shiver ran down Draco’s spine and it had nothing to do with the fresh breeze of the evening. He swallowed thickly around his dry throat, willing his body to calm down and please, just please, let his magic stay still just a little longer.
Fuck. A mix of dread and happiness settled in the pit of Draco’s stomach. He looked into Harry’s face and found him gnawing his lower lips, torturing his nails.
Pansy raised an eyebrow, putting down her fork to get a pen and a paper out of her large leather bag. “He knows the chef of this restaurant.”
The room erupted into a heated chattering, all the guests’ faces glued to the Golden Trio. Potter and his friends started advancing into the room and Draco’s glance slipped to them again. Not realising it, his eyes started roaming quickly over Potter’s body — Draco could see that his suit was tailor-made, but,
The morning after repeated itself like every other morning in Draco’s life. He woke, didn’t think about Potter, showered, definitely didn’t wank while picturing Potter’s arse, had breakfast, absolutely didn’t picture the way Potter licked his bacon and eggs before eating them, and finally dressed without thinking about the way Potter’s arse fit perfectly into his tight, black jeans.
“This lunch has just become more interesting…” Scorpius elbowed Albus in the ribs and they giggled together. “Yeah, I mean, it’s our dads we’re talking about but… let’s see the thing, now?”
Harry definitely didn’t belong with the second group. He didn’t blush every time Malfoy did so much as say an icy “Potter,” in the lift, and he definitely didn’t start stuttering when replying “M-Malfoy.” It was a little pathetic, actually, but Harry couldn’t help it.
He felt nausea clawing at his stomach and curled a hand over it, trying to get a hold of himself. If he was feeling this bad, he could only imagine how Astoria was feeling right now. He needed to find her.
And now that everything is coming back to Harry, a sick feeling plummets to his stomach. Draco’s tears earlier, his anger…
Pansy smirked, leaning in toward Draco. “Ron may not have talked about Harry, but he did tell me something rather interesting.”
Draco beamed, happy they had that settled. As he took another forkful of cous-cous, Draco narrowed his eyes at Ron. He was definitely taking too long to swallow his wine and Draco didn’t really want Ron’s stuttering love words for Pansy to spoil his dessert. Draco cleared his throat, waving a hand towards him. “Spill the beans, Ron.”
Draco had watched Potter smile shyly, before getting up from the bed to get dressed. He’d turned towards Draco, blew a kiss in Draco’s direction, his playful, green eyes watching him intently.
“I want you to fuck me,” he had murmured, sending shivers down Harry’s spine. “While I’m asleep. Until completion.”
Something about Weather Charms, though, didn’t convince Draco and he always avoided using them. It looked unnatural to cast a Heating Charm or a Rain-repelling Charm; what if you got it wrong and accidentally set your clothes on fire or attracted rain instead of repelling it.
Draco flushed to the tip of his ears and nodded. He had ranted hours on end about the cashier who didn’t let him finish his
He had spent an entire night grazing Malfoy’s thighs under the table of the Ministry dinner for the war orphans. Resting his hand just where the thigh meets the groin.
Draco shook his head as the three of them made their way out of Hogwarts and back to Diagon Alley, where they were staying at the Leaky Cauldron.
Harry released his grip on the turtle sighing, defeated and pouting. They were in Draco’s lab and he was running the last tests on Lady Luck to check everything was still fine.
Draco snorted, gesturing to Harry to move and follow him. They started walking again, looking around the gardens.
In one swift move, Harry grabbed Draco’s arm, urging him up to face one another. Harry had something in his hand, but Draco couldn’t quite see it.
Just as he said the words, the sigh that was going to haunt Harry’s nights — he knew it— left Malfoy’s lips again and he bowed his head.
"Idiot. By the way, this tea is perfect again. It's incredible you remembered. And this thing, the order in bedroom? Was a cool idea."
“Damn, Draco, so good for me.” Harry smacked a kiss on the hole, lightly dragging his teeth over the puffy rim, then soothing it immediately with his tongue. To Draco, it felt like he was burning up from the inside out, and to his surprise, his cock was already half-hard.
"I'm afraid I wasn’t too clear with you, Harry, but this kind of bond requires constant touch. Constant touch
“Potter,” Malfoy had said the first time they’d met again at one of the thousands of ministry galas, in his impeccably refined tone. “Nice to see you here.”
Every day sucked if you asked Draco. Well, perhaps that wasn’t completely true. Draco loved his super-secret work, loved that he could deflect boring questions like “how’s work going?” with a simple “I can’t talk about it”, and he hated to admit it to himself, but he loved working with Unspeakable HG (yes, Hermione to the non-Unspeakable world). She was clever and brilliant and baked the
. I can’t… you can’t just… fuck!” Harry’s breathing was already quickening and his cock was now fully, achingly hard, and probably even leaking judging by the stickiness he felt as he shifted on the couch.
Harry’s smile widened and he took Malfoy’s face in both his hands, landing a soft dry kiss on his lips. “I told you I love you. It was the first time for that, too.”
He stared in horror as a bunch of lilies and jasmines blossomed out of nowhere and arranged themselves in the mess of Potter’s bun, their fragrance rapidly invading Draco’s senses. It was the gayest thing Draco had ever seen. And still, he couldn’t avoid thinking the git was bloody attractive.
And that was how they started noticing the years passing by. Harry was already obsessed with counting the passing of every day; trying to remember exactly what day it would be in their real timeline, trying to remember their birthdays and anniversaries. But he hadn’t realised how confusing it was starting to be.
When the meaning of Pansy’s words settled, though, he felt his face growing hot again, realising he still hadn’t moved his gaze from Potter. He blinked and took a sip of wine, savouring it a second before speaking up. “Silly woman, I just noticed he has a piercing and a new pair of glasses. He looks well; instead of looking like a poor lame kid, now he’s at least
“I’m fed up with this discussion, Harry. We have it every other day. Call me when you’ve made peace with yourself.”
"It was okay, we saw our past-selves in St. Mungo's, no one saw us and we thought of some ways to disguise for our longer trip. But there's something off." He squared his shoulders, looking directly into Hermione's eyes.
You’re both panting now, Potter’s cock hard and leaking against his stomach, bobbing with every thrust, untouched. Someone outside laughs, shouts, “That’s it, darlings!”
In an effort to regain control of the frozen room, Draco cleared his throat, startling Mr Serkin who promptly smiled back at the people seated in front of him. “If no one else has any offers…” he trailed off, searching the room for other bidders’ intentions. “Well, then… Going once, going twice, sold. Malfoy Manor goes to Hermione Granger for 16 million Galleons.”
Life at Hogwarts hadn’t let them many other chances, either. They lived there, going back home during the weekends and holidays and occasionally for other errands, but they shared a tremendous amount of time together. Not mentioning that their rooms were adjacent, and they had constant meetings, lunches, dinners… they did everything together. So, they’d had to at least make the effort to make things work.
“—this has to stop. It’s not even that great.” He was finally ready — handsome, tidy and as pompous as always, with his Auror robes perfectly fitted to his lithe body.
“I’m an Auror. I killed Voldemort. I can resist you.” Harry wasn’t absolutely sure about that, but he didn’t want to show it to Malfoy. Malfoy was lying.
“No time, come here,” he urged, grabbing Harry’s hand as soon as he was close enough. “Take Malfoy’s hand, there,” he went on, guiding Harry’s right hand to Malfoy’s left one. “Cross your pinky with Malfoy’s.”
Draco sighed. He didn’t have the answer to that question: if people liked him even half the amount they seemed to love the chef behind Sweet Prophecies, he’d never hide his identity. Plus, the wine was completely messing with his thinking abilities— that, or a giant pink elephant had just started flying around the room without anyone else noticing.
“It’s fine.” She answered pronto. “They know already, and they are here now, so let’s just be done with this.”
You spend all your time at Potter’s place. Your aunt’s place. Whatever. It’s almost like you live there.
They just never stopped, even when Malfoy kept saying it was the last time, blaming, ‘the Allure, Potter’. Harry still wasn’t convinced about the entire Allure business, but Malfoy was probably right.
Hermione Granger was real, real and solid against him, and he was back in the Unspeakables laboratories! This couldn’t be true. She disentangled the hug, murmuring that—
“I think I don’t want to know what you’re talking about.” Ron’s voice surprised Harry, who almost choked on his eggs. He cast a quick glance to Malfoy who, on the other hand, was smirking like a Cheshire cat.
Malfoy was sitting stiffly next to him. “Excuse me,” he said, and stood. Harry watched, guiltily, but when he stood to follow, Hermione stood too, putting a hand on Harry’s arm to stop him.
The walls of Teddy’s room had changed to show a pile of ashes at the bottom of the wall and a giant phoenix arising from it, in a blaze of colours and sparks.
Trying to stay calm, Harry gripped the blanket at the sides of Malfoy’s head, shutting his eyes, biting on his lips until they bled, sure it wouldn't have been possible to take two and that they’d break him. Malfoy kept whispering praises and encouragements at his ear, until he felt both of them inside himself, stilling to give him time to settle.
Harry gasped loudly, almost crying in pleasure — he wanted Malfoy to know just how perfect he felt, how perfect they were together.
That hadn’t been the last time they saw each other. In the year between the end of the eighth year at Hogwarts and Draco’s marriage, he and Potter would still meet occasionally, and every single time, Draco hadn’t been able to resist him; to resist his beautiful green eyes, his contagious smile.
Hermione looked at him with an eyebrow raised, murmuring, "Harry? Draco?", and Harry waved a dismissive hand at her, and they sat facing Malfoy who was currently looking down at the parchment on his desk.
Then, more recent memories. Malfoy in his Potions laboratory, goggles tight on his forehead; long, silky hair dishevelled where the band fit against the back of his head; red circles around his eyes. Icy, stormy, brilliant eyes. Rolled up sleeves, the golden hairs of his arms exposed, flasks all around him, pearly beads of perspiration above his lip, his neck, his collarbones.
Blaise made a choked sound and cleared his throat, mimicking under his breath, ‘he certainly filled out well’. Draco shook his head, asking himself once again why his friends were so oblivious to each other.
Sneaking a glance one last time towards Potter, he found him smiling, absent-mindedly scratching his stubble. Great Salazar, didn’t he have the time to shave like a normal human being?
Ginevra intervened. “Yeah, well… let’s just say that at a certain point I said something like, ‘we should give them something stupid and useless’ and — ”
Draco huffed; his anxiety was starting to nudge at him again. Inhaling through the fresh breeze of the evening, he spat, “And I am sure you shouldn’t be here, nor anywhere near me. Why, mh, why Potter are you here? Why can’t you leave me alone? Why did you testify at my trial? Why did you save me in the Room of Requirement?!”
“Will you shut up?” Harry shouted embarrassed. “I've had enough of this.” He grabbed the bottle and spun it, watching with relief and only a touch of disappointment as the bottle stopped on Zabini.
Draco smiled, feeling stupid the second after he did so. Post-orgasm Draco was dangerously soft and cuddly.
Without saying anything more, Harry Summoned the dildo their wives gifted them as a joke. He regarded it with a worried look for a moment, before saying to Draco, “Um, love, I don’t want to hurt you. I think it would be better to use a spell to, erm, get you ready?”
But she made no offer, nor gave any sign of interest. Shifting his head, Draco’s eyes rested on Potter again. Potter, who was staring back at him. They exchanged a brief startled look — Potter looked like a deer caught in headlights, doing something he wasn’t supposed to. And then a tickle made its way up again from Draco’s stomach to his cheeks.
use your brain. Amazing!” Malfoy brought the plates to the table, sitting next to Harry. He went on. “Do you think people would want to be busted using it and on muggles at that? But, yes, as you so eloquently said: it sucks.”
You shake your head. Clench your fists to prevent the tears from spilling. He stands up, reaches you with two big strides, and punches you in the guts.
Malfoy and him, laughing while doing silly dances around the room, trying to avoid the desks and inevitably bumping them.
Moreover, it helped distract Harry from the embarrassment of watching himself get drunk and flirt, with Malfoy at his side doing a commentary like the ones Lee used to do at Hogwarts.
"We will go back, we will, Draco. I know it. And then I'll be free and we'll finally be able to kiss and hug and touch!" His voice sounded too desperate even to his own ears but Harry couldn't bring himself to care.
“Bill, how nice to see you. I am sorry I didn’t have the chance to come and say hi earlier.” Draco held out a hand, only to receive a loud pat on the shoulder from Bill.
Draco’s breaths quickened in anticipation of a kiss that felt inevitable. He closed his eyes, leaned in…
Potter turned around, glancing at Draco through half-lidded eyes, the green almost gone, replaced by the deep black of his pupils. “So eager, Malfoy, and now stalling?”
Potter had nodded, his hands already unbuttoning Draco’s shirt, fingers ripping the buttons apart. “I agree, no feelings. Just sex.”
Potter took a couple of steps towards Draco, Lady Luck safe in his hands. “I know she’s fine! But guess what,” he snorted as if he couldn’t believe he was actually going to finish that sentence. “— she told me she wanted to see you.”
Draco shook his head, trying to hide his amusement. “This is stupid, Potter. Thanks for bringing her here. She must have lost track of her bale, because… well, she’s blind.”
He could do it, had dreamt about it for so long. With shaking hands, Harry reached for Draco’s trousers and slid them off him, taking down his pants too, slowly. He knew Draco wouldn’t wake up for another hour, but Harry still liked to pretend, to think he had to be careful not to wake him up. It was part of the game.
Draco waved his wand towards the door, trying to lock it, but a messy head popped from behind it, Potter’s eyes sparkling with amusement.
It was painfully obvious to Harry right at that moment, with a disheveled Malfoy in front of his eyes, shirt wrinkled where Nott’s hands had wandered, hair soft around his pointed face, that he ached for Malfoy. He ached to touch him, to take him, to make him moan harder than he had with Nott.
Again, Harry felt his gut wrench when he suddenly appeared in a dark alley with Malfoy. They looked around in confusion for a few minutes, walking up the alley, under the Invisibility Cloak, until they saw the outline of St. Mungo’s.
Draco crossed his arms at his chest. “You told me that you were writing a book,” he said in mock offense. “It was believable; all the papers talked about your imminent book!”
He turned his torso, looking around them. "It's just us and the moon. Come here! And take your shoes off."
Harry swallowed sharply, his Adam’s apple bobbing in a way that sparked fires in Draco’s veins. He shook his head to clear his mind; this wasn’t the right moment to get turned-on.
“What?!” Hermione’s eyes are bulging so much they look like ping-pong balls. The guys are all wearing either shocked or amused expressions.
Harry watched as Malfoy’s tongue peeked out to wet his lips, already imagining the thousands of ways this could end up. Badly— extremely badly.
Harry stayed there, Draco’s cock shoved down his throat, swallowing every single drop of Draco’s spunk. When he drained Draco dry, Harry released his cock with a wet pop, licking his lips. “Much better. Fuck, you taste so good.”
“Fuck!” Harry cried out, his eyes widening to the point of pain, trying to stay still, but he knew he’d never resist. Malfoy snickered against Harry’s skin, and blew some more air over the wet patches he left, and the feather was now brushing against Harry’s neck—
Draco got up from the bed too, grabbed some clothes from the wardrobe, clutching them to his damp chest.
just sounds cuter.” Potter lightly scratched his stubble, only to snap his fingers a second later, a wide grin on his lips.
Draco cleared his throat and straightened up, trying to assume a serious stare. He could still feel the tickle in his stomach, his chest, cheeks… “Erm, I’m afraid so.”
“Draco… what’s happening?” Harry’s voice was only a whisper and Draco mentally cursed himself. It was time to react.
“Close your eyes,” Harry whispered, a finger trailing feather-light down Draco’s chest. Draco couldn’t do anything else other than comply. He closed his eyes, holding his breath.
Potter turned, a dish with two slices of cake and a tremendous amount of cherries in his hand. His eyebrows were wrinkled in amusement, his eyes glittered in the hazy light of the sunset and whatever Draco was thinking, just abandoned him, replaced by images of green eyes and happiness and kisses.
Draco curled his hands on his thighs, trying to resist the sudden urge to grasp his cock and wank furiously. It made no sense; it was just food, right? Moaning, Draco took another bite, letting the perfect flavours of melted sugar and apple mix in his mouth.
"It sucks, mate, but then we remembered you ranting hours on end about Malfoy's fame as a Curse-Breaker and, well, here he is!"
Draco fidgeted with his hands, not knowing what to say. Astoria beat him to it once again and started talking. Her voice was small, trembling, and holding a sadness Draco couldn’t remember ever hearing from her before. “Draco, what have you done. I trusted you. We… thirty-five years, Draco. What have we been for you, all a big lie?”
Incredibly, he felt his cock giving a brave jolt before relaxing again between his thighs. His mind conjured images of Malfoy’s sweating body glued from shoulder to hip to Harry’s on the bed — they had reached the bedroom at one point— panting heavily.
“What? What happened?!” Harry asked, approaching him, seeing Boo-boo right at his side, murmuring that Draco really was a drama queen, everyone in the hotel could hear his cry.
“Let me,” you say as you reach for his belt ‘cause he’s too slow. You’re eager, now, can’t wait anymore. “Fuck, Potter, you’re drunk.” You feel like someone should say it, even while you’re grasping his leather trousers, pulling them down.
A minute later, Malfoy came back with a glass of water and a piece of dark chocolate. He handed them to Harry, rolling his eyes. “You fucker. I didn’t look at you like that because I needed an order. I don’t know if you noticed, but you’ve been constantly giving me small orders all day so the bond is at bay.”
“Well, I mean, I consider it a victory that our wives are standing up for us. And I am not stupid! Don’t kill the moment, Harry!” Draco crossed his arms, faking offence.
“Shut up! No questions, remember?” Malfoy’s cheeks refused to return to their normal pallor, and as much as a delicious sight he made, Harry decided to drop it.
The only furniture present was a little glass coffee table, a white leather couch, and three white orchids arranged in a vase exactly at the centre of the table, while the big windows let the light seep in, making the ambience warm and welcoming.
Soon most of the people joined them on the dance floor, smiling heartily when passing Draco and Pansy.
Harry sighed. Old memories of old times. He let his body slide down on the bed and turned off the lights. The next day would be a hard one.
With horror, you realise tears are streaming down your face, sobs keep slipping past your lips. Potter says nothing.
“Seriously, Granger? You want to use us as testers of something you have no idea it can or will work?!”
They stared at each other in silence for a few seconds, their thoughts reflected in their eyes, not daring to give them voice. Taking a step forward, Draco moved closer to Harry. “I’d like to help you, but I think I need to recover a bit more before.”
“I’ll tell you,” Draco said slowly, “what would happen if we were to do the imbecility that you just suggested. What would happen is we would
“Guess who’s fault that is… you didn’t give me a moment to catch my breath!” Draco’s hands slipped under Harry’s shirt, roaming over his chest, his stomach, and clenching his sides.
“Just let me see it, Potter.” Draco approached him and delicately took the turtle from Potter’s hands, accidentally brushing his fingers and mentally cursing himself for his rising heartbeat.
He launched into the pancakes, spreading what was probably too much marmalade on them, side-eyeing Potter.
When he first became an Unspeakable, the older ones had warned him. Pranks and fake riddles were daily occurrences, especially against newbies. They were fairly common,
"Who said anything about the Manor?" Malfoy smirked and closed his eyes, taking a deep breath, his chest expanding and stretching his black uniform, drawing Harry's eyes.
“Yes, I think she’ll be there. Draco, this means we would, you know, come out to the Wizarding world as a couple. Is that okay?”
Waves of cold and heat alternating on his skin, people with lime-green robes coming and going his way multiple times, Ron and Hermione's worried faces, the pungent smell of sterilising charms and the constant beeping of screens monitoring vitals.
Harry writhed under his touch, his lips involuntarily stretching into a grin, his hands closing into fists. Malfoy had just started and Harry was already dying to just open his mouth and cry out loud and laugh and laugh again.
The wine tasted like Draco imagined heaven to taste. He nodded shyly to the waitress who walked away, still smiling.
Harry looked at her retreating form, mixed feelings confusing him. He turned his face to Malfoy, exhaling, “Now what?”
sending Harry all the articles that talked wonders about Malfoy's successes, assuring him it would only be a matter of days, weeks tops.
Malfoy's lips were clenched in a tight line, his fingers tapping lightly on his desk, fidgeting with the cacti.
When Malfoy left his mouth to trail kisses along his jaw, Harry groaned, bucking his hips forward, searching for friction. Malfoy smiled against his cheek and brought a hand to his hip, pushing it into the mattress, with a strength Harry knew would have left bruises. This thought made Harry’s head spun, and he started to unleash incoherent begs, “P-pease, let me move, l-let me… I-I need…”
“It’s because of my charming personality. You can’t resist it.” Draco also brought a slice to his mouth, taking a moment to inhale the scent before taking a bite, closing his eyes. Pansy snorted, whispering, “See? Drama queen.”
Harry had cocked his head, giving it a thought. “Okay,” he had said as Draco’s head snapped up to him. “I trust you. I surely trust you more than anything out of Knocturn, damn, Draco.”
Draco’s heart plummeted into his stomach and just as Potter lowered his wand and opened his mouth, they were interrupted by a sound coming from the mirrors next to them.
Together with a touch of anxiety, lust sparked again in Harry at the thought of letting himself go to something new once again, with Malfoy. Curiosity took over and he nodded, trustful, contented.
Malfoy's eyebrows wrinkled at this, his lips stretching in a "huh" expression. "Idiot, we have an Invisibility Cloak."
“When you eat so passionately. You really like food; you practically moan when you eat. And you never stop smiling.”
“I want us to be very clear about what we want. You know when… ” Draco moaned, feeling Potter’s tongue drag along his neck, circling his Adam’s apple.
He glanced over the crowd once again, wondering who’d get the Manor, what would they do with it. The price was already ridiculously high — 10 million Galleons — when a wand raised from the first row. A feminine voice. “I offer 16 million Galleons.”
“It’s not our fault, though. We may have been a bit clueless, and we may have tried to make something dead work, but they cheated on us. I am so angry, so fucking angry. Why aren’t you, Tori?”
It was too much. Harry’s scratchy voice, the way he said Draco’s name, how filthy it all sounded. It tipped Draco over the edge. With a low groan, Draco came for so long he thought it’d never end.
Once back in the hotel, Draco with his cup of hot tea and Harry with a beer, they finally started talking.
Someone was singing… someone that definitely sounded like Malfoy and whose voice was so deep that Harry’s chest felt tight. Without thinking too much, he pushed the door slowly open to find Malfoy standing in the centre of the room. Teddy, with bright blond hair, tears in his eyes, but relaxed in Malfoy’s hug.
capable of loving. Draco would dye his hair a different colour each month and this time he had red hair. It was while looking at his dyed hair that Harry knew it, once and for all, he had fallen for this eccentric Draco Malfoy, who loved doing yoga every morning, dyeing his hair, and looked like an angel every time he smiled.
Draco rubbed his eyes and smoothed his hair nervously back on his head, behind his ears. Since he started wearing it with its natural waves he was constantly worrying over its state. Sighing, he said, “I! Don’t! Know! You’re confusing me. If the ball is about to start, shouldn’t we go?”
Draco gasped and put a hand on his chest, trying to sound outraged. “And here I was, thinking I was fucking with the Saviour of us all!”
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand, watching in front of them. “So…” He kneeled, laying Lady Luck on the sand. He waved a hand to her and muttered, “Bye, Lady Luck.”
Hermione went on. “Harry, we are all immune to your Allure. It works to signal attraction to you, not the other way around. And that goes for Draco too, and you
His fears forgotten, Harry lubed his cock and lined up with Draco’s rim, stilling to observe him. His eyes were still closed, his breathing only slightly altered. Holding his breath, Harry delicately pushed in, only as much as to push the head past the tight furled rim, totally incapacitated to restrain from groaning.
Fuck. If this had been literally any other situation, Harry would have thought Malfoy was actually flirting with him. He cleared his throat. “Let’s start with me giving you different orders to test the effects, okay?”
“‘m tired,” Harry mumbled, chin propped on his hand as he chewed on scrambled eggs. “Give me some orange juice.”
“You agree with me, though. The fucking best restaurant in all of London.” Draco took another bite, smirking. “Despite hating it the first time we came here.”
Draco smirked at Harry’s reflection in the mirror, slowing down at an almost painful rhythm. “Isn’t this why you’re marrying me?”
at Occlumency,” Malfoy snarled, slapping a hand on his desk. He closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. “But I’m not using it now. This was a mistake. Let’s just wait in silence from now on. I need to finish the potion.”
Astoria sniffled and Scorpius went to sit next to her, hugging her. He rubbed his hands on her back, trying to calm her down. “That’s the least, Dad. What are you planning to do now? Mum said you want to
Blaise chuckled. “Not what I asked, but—” Pansy was sitting on the other side of Draco and leaned in too, probably feeling cut off from the conversation. “What are you two whispering about?!”
They were taking out the chocolates when Draco stepped out of the bathroom, his hair still wet, towel wrapped loose around his waist. Some droplets of water fell from strands of his hair and rolled down Draco's chest, raising goosebumps on their way down, hardening Draco's nipples.
He grasps your left arm, rolls the sleeve up. Your mark is red, stained, but very much there, and he’s looking at it.
Potter cocked an eyebrow, a knowing smirk appearing on his plump lips. “Who’s the quick-tempered, easy-to-jump to conclusions one, now?”
Harry stopped, taking a deep breath. Malfoy was looking at him with a perplexed face, but a little smile was pulling at his mouth.
“I really don’t think so, Gin. They didn’t put us in the sales contract. Oh wow, do you think they used it for their… sordid affair?” Astoria was lightly laughing, a few tears stuck on her lashes.
Harry and Malfoy were walking a couple of steps behind Hermione, both busy gaping at the inside of the Unspeakable Centre.
Harry rolled his eyes but let the topic drop as they started eating the ratatouille Malfoy had cooked. It was bloody amazing and Harry couldn’t stop the gasp he made after tasting it.
Harry huffed loudly, looking worriedly at Boo-boo's face morphing into a sad mask again, and glaring at Malfoy. "Nonsense. Of course you can come, people can't see you, right? Maybe he can be helpful, what do you know!"
“What’s the matter, he asks!” Draco cried in a dramatic tone that made Boo-boo snort and Harry smile amused.
As he broke the kiss, the second Malfoy unbuttoned his shirt, making some of the buttons jump on the floor, and he put a hand on Harry’s chest, slowly sliding it lower and lower, until he grasped Harry’s cock.
Draco didn't know how or why but he would always find sand at his cottage, in the shower, in his hair, in his
Harry stopped, frozen, right when they were passing through the window doors of the kitchen, a house-elf cooking dinner.
A bunch of red-haired people, their former wives and their children were all waiting for them, chatting and munching some snacks before lunch. When Draco and Harry entered the room, all their heads snapped, and they all hugged and kissed their greetings.
With a slow pace, he reached the bedroom. The door was closed. He leaned his ear on it and heard the smallest of sobs coming from inside and it sent shivers through his body. He hurt Astoria,
Malfoy finally kissed him, chaste, a peck on the lips. Retreaded back, to look into Harry’s eyes. “The Dark Mark. I… you’re right. The situation, Voldemort, he… Harry, it was taking it or dying on the spot. I still thought I could help you, I wanted to tell you straight away, but…”
They walked towards the shore with a light breeze ruffling their hair, the sun almost rose, resting on the horizon line with the water.
Everything seemed to stop. The ticking of the big wooden clock hanging from the ceiling, the whispering of the diners, the frenetic waiters, everything. Draco’s own breathing stopped, stuck painfully between his ribs. He saw Pansy’s lips move but couldn’t hear anything coming out of them.
Opening the door of the restaurant, Draco stepped inside, a puddle of water already forming at his feet. The waitress, Sarah, laughed, shaking her head. Everyone here knew him by now.
Harry’s hands dropped lower, caressing Draco’s sides. His look was almost predatory now, a look Draco knew was the one that allowed Harry to be
He understood it in the following two hours, overhearing the pair discuss what happened — Jacob's magical core had been almost destroyed by the spell when it went wrong, but Louis helped him get better. Apparently, Louis and Jacob had been together for the last three years and they were both in love with the ‘great Harry Potter’ and had planned to use this bond to lure him into their relationship.
He stands up, taking a deep breath to steady himself. But just when he starts moving towards the Slytherin table, Draco springs up and marches towards the doors, Goyle in tow.
Draco was already turning to hug Fleur when he replied. “Yes, thank you Bill. It’s very nice here tonight. Fleur, you’re as delightful as ever.
Potter backed up, smacking his back against the wall. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, Draco!”
And really, Draco could be such a drama queen sometimes. So, Harry thought of breaking the tension with a little innocent joke.
From the door, he was finally able to take in where he was, and it was clear that this was a hotel room. Samples of body products and catalogues were everywhere on the nightstands and the little desk at the far end of the room, a telly hung on the wall opposite the bed, with a door just a few feet from Harry probably leading to the bathroom.
The idea of having twice of what he usually had started to implant itself in his mind. If his orgasms were already so strong with one Malfoy, how would it be with two?
"We haven't met in twenty-six years and we live in the same city, our kids go to the same school. Instead, we meet where, in Bacalar?"
Malfoy gasped too, hot and broken on his neck, inhaling deeply against Harry’s hair before speaking again. “And now, Harry, now how many times has someone done this to you?”
They went to pay their dinner bill, apologising for the distress they caused that night and exited the restaurant. Draco sighed, a lump forming in his throat. He half-wished Astoria would be there waiting for him, telling him she was ready to hear his story.
“Fuck, fuck, I love it, keep on, Harry, I want to—” he stole another kiss from Harry, breathing hard around it, trapping Harry’s face with his hands. “I want to feel your come filling me, love, come in me, make me yours.”
He was being sarcastic, Draco knew it, but his brain was addled by the feeling of Potter’s hand on his back, by the heat of his body so close, by the smile, not sad anymore, on his face. Draco opened his mouth to reply, trying to come up with something ironic, when a singing high-pitched voice reached them.
As soon as he stepped out of their fireplace, though, Draco stilled: Astoria and Ginevra were there too. But they didn’t seem angry with them. In fact…
" Draco said, looking at the turtles. "Another thrilling day is ahead of us. What do you have to tell me today?"
Harry sucked harder, his tongue darting around Draco’s shaft to lick away the cream. He licked the tip, eventually letting go to murmur, “This is good, but I have to say, I rather prefer your taste.”
He cleared his throat, luckily dropping the topic. "Here I am. In these three days we were able to create a potion that controls your symptoms."
They slowed down together with the music. A new composition was about to start, Beethoven again. Walking towards one of the stalls with beverages, Draco side-eyed Pansy, an amused smirk on his face.
At the same moment, Astoria broke down crying and Ginevra threw her dish of spaghetti at Harry, screaming, “Did you think that bringing us into a restaurant would prevent us from making a scene?!”
They looked at each other with their eyes wide open, not daring to move a single muscle. After seconds that felt like a lifetime, Potter slowly started to talk. “Did your mirror just compliment me?”
Potter had grinned wickedly, the sight sending sparks throughout Draco’s body. “Damn right, Malfoy. Who would have known you’d be so wise, after all?”
Harry cocked his head. This time he felt his own face heating up. “Dignity,” he scoffed. “Damn it. That would mean that I’m attracted to
Malfoy was completely crazy and exhausting, but he always knew how to please him. Again, all the memories of the care Malfoy had used to clean and make Harry comfortable after giving him his ‘gift’, invaded his mind, leaving back a warm feeling.
“This is bullshit! We didn’t kiss! Okay, we held hands. So what!” Harry’s cheeks were flushed red and he was looking around them all as if trying to read the situation.
Ron's voice called out, slightly muffled, from the Floo a second before vanishing. "And don't forget the potion!"
"This ghost is weird, Harry, I don't understand who he is, why is he here, why no one but us can see him. I don't trust him and we need to be able to concentrate."
It was late in the night when he was finally able to keep his eyes open for more than a few seconds, but he wasn't sure he was really awake when the first thing he saw was Draco Malfoy in a lime-green robe and golden halo around his head.
They were compiling their end-of-the-day reports when Hermione looked up from her papers, biting her bottom lip. Draco saw her out of the side of his eye and knew right away what had crossed her mind.
And Harry hadn’t been able to refrain from throwing some acid joke here and there, finding Malfoy’s voice absolutely irritating and —
They exited the room, approaching the veranda of the beach house. Harry and he had searched for the right place for months but they eventually agreed that their beach house was the right one, full of good memories and witness of their growing love.
It was still odd and difficult to walk together under the Cloak, trying to be careful and not touch each other or bump into other people or buildings, but some clumsy steps later they entered the hospital.
When he breaks the kiss, his lips find your cheeks— he licks away your tears, one by one. He kisses your cheekbones, your jaw, your eyebrows.
After discovering that Harry could bear very short and soft touches, they’d started to do it more often, almost kissing, brief grazing of lips on foreheads, hands light on hands.
Draco felt cold sweat gathering at the nape of his neck. He should have never looked at Julienne before going into a detailed reminiscence of his first fuck with Potter.
One hour, and an anxiety crisis later — "honestly, Draco, didn't you think Boo-boo could be impressed by the ritual?" "Just shut up, Harry, you didn't think of that either!" — Jacob exited the room limping, clutching at his stomach and casting worried glances around the corridor.
"Friends! I've been around here for forever, and you two are the first ones who can see me! Please, don't go! We'll have fun!"
“I was,” Potter admitted, raising an eyebrow. “You did leave me without a single word, or your cock for that matter, for an entire week.”
“You’re all marked up, aren’t you,” he says, and fuck, you hate him. So you push out a little —as much as you can with him clamping hard around you— and thrust in so hard he’s breathless. Both his hands tighten. He bares his teeth.
With the other hand, he rips the buttons of your shirt open, trails a finger on your chest. Your other marks are there, the ones
Draco startled at the question; he wasn’t really listening, lost in his mulling. He turned his head to Pansy, blinking several times. “Erm, w-what?”
Draco had huffed, not meeting Harry’s eyes. “Well, okay, I brewed it. But it’s safe, I know what I’m doing!”
Draco pursed his lips, feigning indifference. “Well, don’t do this again. I have to keep my body healthy, you know, and all I want to do now is eat everything on the table. This isn’t fair.”
Harry kept at it at a maddeningly slow pace, surrounded by Draco’s warmth, the scent of his skin layered with thin perspiration. Harry leaned in and licked between Draco’s shoulders where he knew he’d like it most.
When he opened them again, Potter was petting Lady Luck’s shell, regarding Draco with a worried expression. “Are you alright?”
“Yes.” The word was out of Harry’s mouth before he could even process it. Parkinson stopped her empty protest, turning her head to Malfoy so fast that her neck cracked audibly in the stunned silence of the room.
“I swear that’s not…” Draco trailed off, Potter’s eyes were wide as saucers, his mouth open, his lips — still red from the cherry sauce — forming a perfect ‘O’… They stared at each other in silence, when the portrait started again.
Malfoy didn’t so much as flinch. He just smirked, and unclasped his arms, brushing one hand down Harry’s chest. “Will you? Such a good boy, aren’t you, Potter?”
“The reveal will be the biggest scoop of my life. The chef has already agreed to an interview with me, you know? But I’m not going to tease you anymore. I can see the alcohol’s already fogging your brain.”
Harry laughed — there was at least something good in this mess. Something vibrated in his pocket and, before he could get his hopes up that it was his wand signalling they were going back, he palmed his mobile through the fabric of his trousers.
Draco’s heart again started pumping so fast he could feel it in his throat, and he hurried to go sit at the table with his notary. Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw a waiter picking up the portrait, fixing it. Cool, everything was cool.
Malfoy turns his head to look at Harry. He’s at a weird angle, his hair is all plastered to his forehead, and he’s panting. He’s never been this beautiful.
“Breathe? You know you like it.” Harry could hear the smirk in Malfoy’s tone, but a second after, he was stepping back, the lack of his body heat already painful.
A full page picture of Malfoy, standing proud in a black fitted uniform, at the middle section of the newspaper.
“I feel drunk,” he whispered as he looked right into Malfoy’s eyes. “Not because of the alcohol, but… the power that comes with this
“You’re mine,” Harry growls, pushing his cock to the point of almost pain into him, head spinning and balls aching.
Harry entered Harvey’s office, yawning profusely, to find his partner asleep at his desk. Harry snapped the door shut, waking Harvey up, shooting him a forced grin.
Draco looked around his studio at the fireworks stacked on the desk, the wild amount of flowers dispersed all over the room, the two tickets for a Portkey to Paris, the spellbook open on ‘
“Um, yeah, sorry. Okay, well. Yes, it’s true. I cheated on you for the last year and I know… er, I understand, what you’re saying. I was not cheating on you physically in the years before, but I wasn’t completely involved in our marriage as I should have been. I was a right shite.”
“We can’t stay in hotels all the time,” Malfoy had declared, high on the wine they ordered with the room service, head lulling on the pillow.
His manners were again kind ones like he had used the day before at the hospital, but this time he looked warmer, more comfortable. With a distracted eye, Harry saw that Malfoy was wearing his black uniform and Harry’s gaze involuntarily checked him out from head to toe, focussing on his lean but firm thighs, his slim waist and the muscles of his shoulders lightly stretching the fabric of his shirt…
Before leaving, Hermione wrote Malfoy's office address on the blackboard on Harry's fridge. She and Ron were the last to go home, standing in front of the fireplace, Floo powder in hands.
"We'll grab a taxi," Harry said, taking off the Invisibility Cloak and quickly folding it into his pockets.
“I thought you’d be mad at me,” Draco said carefully, levitating his coat and shoes toward his wardrobe. He padded towards the sofa, sitting next to Potter.
He spent the entire night drinking, getting steadily drunker until no one could understand a single word he said.
Harry gasped at the feeling, already lost for the man straddling him. Malfoy smirked and shifted lower, brushing his lips to Harry’s nipple, whispering, “I told you to stay still, sweetheart, didn’t I?”
He’s talking to the barman, laughing, elbows on the counter, chin resting on his hands. Lips pursed, back arched, arse propped up: he looks straight out of a porn movie.
The morning after Harry’s waking, Hermione arrived early at St. Mungo's with an incredible collection of books stacked in her bag.
After a few moments of silence, Draco sighed, his gaze dropped to his hands folded in his lap. "How you can still keep track of time passing, it's a mystery to me."
“I don’t want to see it!” Ron slapped a hand on the table to make his point clear, but Lily was already reaching behind Harry and Draco’s seats, with a red blush spreading on her cheeks. She sneaked the package from Harry’s hands and went back to her seat next to Hermione. “It can’t be that bad!” The girls looked inside and burst out laughing so hard that they almost fell off their chairs.
But when Draco decided to stand up and demand they lower the temperature —honestly, it was torture how hot it had gotten— he felt glued to the spot as Potter did the very thing Draco imagined: he brought the slice of lime to his lips, his tongue dragging across the flesh, excruciatingly slow, small shivers running down his back, visible goosebumps rising on his arms.
“Out! All of you!” Draco croaked, exasperated. “I need to get ready and you’re all distracting me. Harry’s almost home. Shoo!”
Malfoy's face scrunched up in disgust and Harry felt the sudden urge to kick his shins under the table when he remembered that that would have hurt him more than Malfoy.
Waiting for Harry to arrive, Draco started to replay the entire scene in his mind: Harry’s eyes, shining with emotion, Draco telling him he’d organised a surprise weekend for the two of them, together in Paris.
Pansy enlaced her fingers with Blaise, dragging him up the stairs she had descended earlier, their laughter softly floating in the air, warming Draco’s heart. He decided to take Blaise’s suggestion and go out for a walk before everyone started arriving; choosing to use the window door of the ballroom to get out, still not feeling completely comfortable with stepping through the front doors of the Manor.
The rest of their meal proceeded smoothly, with laughter and conversation, gossip about the latest pureblood marriages, their former classmates’ lives, all accompanied by the finest spaghetti Bolognese Draco ever had and sea bream fillets which made Draco’s toes curl in his Gucci shoes.
Malfoy snorted in the kiss, breaking it. “Oh Merlin, Harry, we’ll fight so much. We… I know things are not magically resolved now…”
“Wanna see what it is?” Malfoy breathed on Harry’s mouth but didn’t give him time to reply because he slowly licked Harry’s bottom lip, sucking it between his teeth. He released it, breathed again, “Mh, do you,
Harry hugs Malfoy to his chest— he’s already fallen asleep. It’s always like this when Harry knots him: Malfoy’s euphoric, ecstatic, electric with the need to feel Harry inside himself and just as they’ve finished, he immediately falls asleep in Harry’s embrace.
“I’ll admit the first time can be overwhelming. But once you taste the food…” Draco trailed off, kissing his fingers in a top quality gesture. Pansy laughed, serving herself some of the salmon nuggets.
“How do you want it to happen, then?” Harry asked, leaning in so that his lips brushed against Malfoy’s with every word.
Outside the bathroom stool someone shouted, “Harry? Draco? Where the hell are they, everyone’s waiting outside!”
Ron snorted into his cup and shook his head, looking amused at Harry. "You and Malfoy should talk sometimes, it's really about time you sort things out."
am going to be somewhere else when you do!” With that, she stalked off, probably to the kitchen to fix the last things for the brunch.
Harry had grown almost fond of using the Cloak — by now it was the moment he could feel the closest to Draco, when his scent spread in every air cell around Harry, making Harry wonder about the man he loved, fantasise of when they'd be back in the hotel and he could feel that scent on his body.
It could have been the tenth or eleventh time — time passed in a blur when they were together — when Harry understood he could not escape his feelings anymore.
“This house is terribly unkempt, so much dust, spiders. I wouldn’t be surprised to find boggarts in here—” Malfoy’s voice reached Harry as his steps down the stairs echoed through the house.
“That was fucking hot,” Harry said, bringing Malfoy’s other ankle up too, unable to keep his hands off Malfoy’s feet. “Do you think…”
Harry had shaken his head, unable to believe his lucky stars. He had grinned, asking only one last thing. “Where did you buy it, Draco? Can we trust it?”
Draco raised an eyebrow and put his fork down. “I’m sure you can articulate something even with your little Gryffindor brain.”
Half an hour later, Harry was free; Jacob and Louis were being transported to the Ministry jail, leaving Harry and Draco alone in the room. They looked at each other, twenty years of want and love leaping out of them.
Harry sucked Draco’s cock in earnest and Draco woke up with a start only at the very end, choking out a confused, “Wha’? I… oh fuck, I’m coming.”
Harry wanked to the thought repeatedly, feeling dirty and ashamed of it, but unable to stop. The thought that Draco could let him have full control, not only when awake, got to his head.
You feel like this shouldn’t be happening at all, but fuck, you’re not a good man: your attraction to Potter has been going on for as long as you can remember, and his lips, his eyes, his
“Thankfully, no one has ever decided to use my fear of Dementors against me, especially not during a Quidditch match.”
Harry smirked, grabbing a pillow and shoving it under Draco’s back. “We’ll see,” he breathed before ducking down and with the flat of his tongue licking a long stripe from Draco’s balls to his arsehole.
Looking at the note, he already felt calmer, Hermione's neat handwriting playing a great role in that. She called it 'the font for drunk folks'. She had somehow found a particular way of writing that was easy to catch up with even in a confused state.
“Someone’s eager,” he declared, slumping down against the sofa. “Although I’m afraid I’m too sore to go at it again.”
“Oh, don’t worry, I know you’re not a good man,” Malfoy replied. “And I believe you’re still too clothed.”
Someone from the crowd bought the wand for 175 thousand Galleons. Draco clenched a hand on his stomach and felt his cheeks burning, the air around him once again too hot. He didn’t have the time to panic at his reactions to Potter smiling: the auctioneer was already starting with the last and most important item of the night, the Manor itself.
They stayed through the afternoon and into the night, the others filling him in on what happened at the New Year’s Eve party. Harry was happy to know that he hadn't been the only one completely pissed. Apparently, Seamus and Dean had made an exhibition of themselves climbing onto the roof of the farmhouse and declaring they'd fuck there until dawn.
. His emotions showed on his face in a transparent way and Draco would frown or smile or say little silly things, murmur incoherent syllables in his sleep, making Harry's heart jolt in his chest.
“Ma wife here, says I need air. Oh, Malf-oy, happy birthday!” Ronald patted a hand on Draco’s shoulder, swinging forward and Draco had to catch him before he toppled on him.
Harry was twenty-four the first time he discovered about BDSM and submission, the first time he learned there was no shame in feeling pleasure from submitting to someone else and being on edge of pain.
Draco took a deep breath, deeply inhaling the ocean smell, closing his eyes and letting the gentle lap of the waves guide him to Potter.
Draco took a moment to look at the pink glittery banner saying, "Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy Wedding" hanging from the wedding arch behind Harry, and found himself laughing. Finally, they could scream at the entire world who they truly are. He flicked his eyes down again and met Harry's, those breathtaking green eyes. A warm smile spread on their faces and Draco’s heart swelled in his chest.
London then. Thank fuck. But definitely Muggle London. Looking into the streets, Harry didn't recognise the neighborhood, though.
Albus raised his eyebrows and pursed his lips. “Dad, please. I knew you felt something for Draco well before today.” Harry grinned, and Albus quickly concluded, “That said, it doesn’t mean I am fine with this. You hurt mum, and that’s never fine. You’ll have to work hard to regain our trust. But… I wanted you to know, I am here for you too.”
“Your treehouse!” Right on one of the oaks stood proud Draco’s treehouse. It was unlike anything Harry could have ever imagined: it was huge, with wooden stairs to reach it, big enough to actually fit grown ups too.
“What is it?” Scorpius tried to take the package from Harry, as the other shouted excitedly, “Guys? Show us!”
“It’ll be our cover. And! Less expensive. And! If we find a solution, we’re already together, and we can’t get lost… see, so many good reasonssss.”
Before Malfoy’s words could sink in, Harry’s eyes fell to the clock on the opposite wall of Malfoy’s lab. “Oh fuck, look at the time! Harvey will kill me!” Harry rushed to Malfoy’s desk, taking out the prescription for the potions they needed that week. “Look, I need—”
Malfoy sighed and brought himself into the centre of the circle, a scornful expression on his face. “Well, hurry up, Potter, I don’t have all night.”
mhmh.” Draco tried to wiggle his eyebrows suggestively, approaching Harry and sneaking an arm around his waist. He pulled him close, making their chests bump together.
Draco was silently crying, his tears dripping in his — now probably cold — tea. Boo-boo sniffed, muttered a low, “I’m sorry Harry” and settled right next to him, telling him he would sleep with them tonight.
They started chatting about this and that while ordering their dinner, and Draco was indeed happy to see that Astoria and Ginevra had already started to drink wine. He poured a generous amount for himself and Harry too, and took a great gulp almost immediately.
“I see. We should have seen it coming.” Pansy sighed, rolling her eyes and winking at Draco. “Is it his body? Because honey, honestly, I don’t blame you. He certainly filled out well.”
"Listen, Harry, I know this sucks. But you heard them, they decided to stay here until Jacob gets better. I'm sure they're still here, damage like this takes months to fix."
“Chianti. It’s Italian, pretty strong, but I love it. It ruins the sea bream’s taste slightly, but it’s worth it. You should have it with Potter; he’d enjoy seeing you this pissed.” She smirked, fishing out from her purse a piece of paper. It was a torn page from her magazine, Draco realised.
You finally release your breath. You want everything but to hurt Potter. You can’t tell them, though, so you just nod.
By the time he reached his home, snow had started falling again, covering the ground in a thick layer of sparkling white. The sun had just dipped below the horizon, casting dark orange streaks to colour the snow, making it look like a field of poppies. Draco shook his head, flicking the door open.
“Dear Lord, you haven’t changed either! I wonder what’s happening in your mind right now if you spaced out like that.” Potter smiled, a genuine smile, one that only people who’ve been intimate would share, one that made Draco’s heart swell in his chest.
Teddy turned his head to Harry too, and his hair became almost black as he stretched his hands towards him. “Up!”
Sex was always impossible for the most part. France had been strongly aphrodisiac for them and they spent a lot of time wanking together under the warm spray of the shower, Harry on his knees, opening his mouth to catch a taste of Draco.
Draco felt mad, only mad people could fall so fast, so intensely, over someone else’s scent, taste, laughter, eyes. But Harry didn’t seem to think he was mad, or if he did, he probably was mad himself too, because he leaned in again and pressed his forehead to Draco’s, purring, “Kiss me one more time.”
‘Tough’ didn’t even start to describe how it had been for Draco, but he couldn’t say it out loud. He found that he couldn’t say anything out loud if he wanted to avoid crying in front of Potter. Again. He clenched his jaw and closed his eyes in an effort to calm himself down, a hand absent-mindedly brushing the pendant…
“Articulate as always, are we? So, what’s your surprise? You Owled saying you’d bring the food…” Draco tried to be casual as he padded towards the kitchen.
"Salazar, Harry, you're thick!" Malfoy whispered back, try not to be heard by the Unspeakables passing by.
Why was this one of the worst hangovers Harry had ever experienced? Not only did his head feel like thousands of bees were stuck in it, his stomach was turning like a roller coaster, and he still had this weird feeling on his skin that was starting to make him nervous.
“Here he is, the traitor.” She had stopped, her hands full of flour and what seemed to be chocolate. “Do you have any idea how mortifying this is, Harry?”
Well, that wasn’t entirely true, either. Because the truth was that before he started this ‘whatever-this-is-for-the-last-time’ thing with Malfoy, they’d been friends.
“Yeah, and oh Merlin, we also went house hunting and damn, all the shopping we did for the furniture together. We chose everything, even the beds and the curtains! You were so fixated with silk stuff and I wanted so badly to have a chromatically arranged house. I’m asking myself how did I not realise before I am gay, really.” Harry’s voice was rough for laughing so much. “We also tried the bed together to see if it was comfortable! You said–I remember it–you said ‘
“Sure, let’s go. I know just the place.” Draco got up, taking his cloak from the coat stand next to his desk and walking past Ron. “You’re paying.”
And then the next item, the very first wand made by Shikoba Wolfe. They were famous in America for making highly complex wands, their reputation was well-known around the world. Their first wand wasn’t possible to master but had an incredible value, even more for that reason.
“Why the long face?” he asked, shoulder leaning against the doorframe, hair slightly disheveled from the Floo powder. He looked so damn beautiful it hurt a bit.
Somewhere during Draco’s panic, Pansy must have ordered because the waiter arrived with a slice of apple pie for him and profiteroles for Pansy.
In no time, Malfoy’s hands were on Harry’s body again. He brushed his fingers to Harry’s ribs, ever so slightly, roaming them up and down, his eyes intent on Harry’s.
Harry took a deep breath and nodded. “Please, Sir,” he hissed. Malfoy may not speak Parseltongue but they’d fucked a reasonable amount of times by now that he knew exactly what it meant when Harry slurred those words.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow and stepped into the kitchen, sitting at the table. “C’mon sweetheart, just tell me.”
She sighed, the curve of her lips dragging down in a sad frown. “That it must have been a nightmare for you all these years. You told us you cheated on us during this last year. What about the previous ones? Why, why in hell did you let yourself go through all this pain? I am wondering, Draco, when did I give you the idea you couldn’t confide in me and tell me your feelings. I would have understood. I would have, Draco!”
A moan escaped Draco’s lips; it sounded desperate — he had been aroused too long. “I, aaah, I don’t know what you’re talking about…”
Malfoy had gone back to his place, looking like an idiot. An absolutely smug, hot, flustered, deliciously rose-pinked cheeks idiot.
It wasn’t long before Harry and Malfoy found the pair in a dusty room on the second floor, Jacob explaining what happened to his friend — a certain Louis, who helped him with the plan. Harry wasn't sure as to why.
Every Gryffindor in the room burst out laughing, Ron loudly crying, “You’ve wasted a question, mate.” And Harry could understand them, really, he was almost happy that his friend Seamus had chosen such a safe question for him; he probably really thought it wouldn’t have caused Harry any problems.
Harry threw his head back against the pillow, trying to gather his thoughts. He’d never be able to stay still, but he could shut his mouth.
Pansy sniggered and approached Blaise, leaning in as to tell a secret but actually talking with a clear voice. “I busted him in the gardens with Potter. And Potter had flowers in his hair! And then Draco said he’s gay and that his magic is going wild.”
It was 1995, their fifth year. They’d just watched their fight on the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch, celebrated their anniversary, and went to bed.
Harry raised an eyebrow at him and smirked. “Sure, sure, I was just kidding. Also, how thoughtful girls, green and red, like Slytherin and Gryffindor! We are lucky men.”
When they calmed down enough for words to come out evenly, Harry started scraping the label of his butterbeer glass, a sign that Draco knew meant he was brooding. “Do you…. Do you remember when I taught you the
“You smoke?” Harry asked, bewildered. Malfoy whipped his head to him, eyes widening then hardening at the sight.
Offering a weak smile, Draco accepted Potter’s hand and squeezed it. It was a strong hand, warm and soft. Not at all how Draco had imagined it would be. Potter was smiling his ear-to-ear grin and Draco realised too late he was staring at Potter’s
After an entire night spent answering questions like, “What do you think you’ll do after Hogwarts, Draco?” and, “When do you plan to marry and have kids?”, all you want to do is drown in Firewhiskey and maybe fuck Potter.
At these words, Geremia’s eyes seemed to sparkle with interest and he started writing down everything they were saying, quickly scribbling on his parchments, seemingly tracing lines and arrows all over his thoughts. It had been a frantic tell, concluded by Draco shouting out, “Shit, Jacob! We know where he is, call the Aurors!”
not to know what it meant and invented the story that sometimes one assumes their teacher’s Patronus. I was… oh Draco, I was so happy. I thought of telling you everything that day, you know? Of telling you I loved you too, of running away together, building a life together... But, the second time you did it in front of me, it had changed, and I was scared I had maybe only imagined all of that…” He was rubbing the label so hard, Draco feared it would catch fire.
, until his breath came back regularly and the shouts ceased. He’d open his eyes, look inside the room. Make sure it was, indeed, empty.
“Err, I—” Draco got up from his chair, feeling all their friends’ eyes on him. He knew he was blushing like a first-year during the Sorting, but he couldn’t help it. He didn’t have any excuse to go this quickly right after Potter.
