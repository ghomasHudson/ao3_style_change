“Tell me about it,” Malfoy says wetly.
He headed for the bathroom, hoping that the warm water of the shower could offer some relief. But it burnt and hurt on his open wounds and bruises and Draco found himself crying like a baby, sobbing as he leaned into the tiles, wishing his mother was there with him, missing her like mad.
“I love you,” Harry murmurs, kissing Draco on the cheek, and leaving a sweet sticky patch on Draco’s skin. The blond rubs it off and pretends to be affronted, but then Harry snogs him for what feels like half an hour, and Draco melts against him, little needy sounds leaving his mouth every time their lips part for air. Draco tastes like pistachio ice-cream and strawberries. He tastes like home and love.
“I’ll be your partner for today, Potter,” Zabini announces, his eyes calculating and amused. Harry swallows loudly and sees Hermione shrug and sit next to Draco as Ron ends up unwillingly paired up with Parkinson.
What was he thinking, playing house with Potter?
Draco looks different.
“People will find out,” Draco says, averting his gaze. “The Minister wiped Page’s memory, but the rest of the eighth-years at school have found out. I trust my Slytherins, and you trust your Gryffindors, but what about people like Smith? It’s just a matter of time before the rest of the world realises Harry Potter’s boyfriend is a Death Eater.”
“You’re very welcome,” Draco says with a smile tugging the corner of his lips.
Harry inhales and feels Draco breaching him, and he gasps as he slides inside him in one slow, smooth push. Draco feels bloody huge.
Draco takes the wand Harry offers and starts casting spells to lengthen the trousers and the sleeves, trying on Harry’s clothes and adjusting the size as he slides into them. Harry watches him in awe, wondering why on earth there is a storm of butterflies in his stomach just because Draco is wearing his old t-shirt and jeans.
He knows that Draco is worth it, though.
He opened his eyes and found Potter’s on him, studying him in the dim light of the late afternoon.
Malfoy and his mother were there. It was the only funeral they attended. Andromeda said her sister had contacted her after the war, that they were trying to make peace, and asking for permission to attend their cousin’s funeral was part of the process. Harry remembers Malfoy’s stern face, his black robes and grey eyes purposely avoiding him.
They tuck in and it tastes absolutely divine, so much so that Harry can’t suppress a loud moan, and Malfoy stares at him, his cheeks colouring in a way that Harry can’t help but find attractive. He likes it when Malfoy’s pale skin flushes, and his mind starts wondering if it would turn red if Harry kissed it. If it would bruise easily, were Harry to suck on it hard.
On Friday Malfoy looks less grumpy, so Harry stays after the Aurors leave and they quietly go to Malfoy’s room as soon as they hear the sound of the front door shutting. Harry waits for Malfoy to tell him to undress, and then he quickly removes his clothes. He has to beg again for the Slytherin to get naked and remove his
“Would you…” the blond begins, his cheeks flushing. “Could you put this in your trunk? If I pack it in mine, they’re just going to confiscate it.”
“No worries,” Harry replies, fascinated by the way Malfoy’s eyes shine and his lips are so full and kissable. “I can wait.”
Harry tugs at his curls, twisting his fingers in his unruly hair, feeling at loss and wanting to find a solution. He just wants to get Draco out of the Manor and into Hogwarts.
Such a mess, he thought.
“I think it’s a boy.”
Harry thinks he’s probably imagining it, but it almost looks like Malfoy’s cheeks are turning the loveliest shade of pink.
McGonagall’s eyebrows go so far up her forehead that Harry thinks he’s never seen her that surprised in his whole life.
girls try to ask him out and burst into tears when he blurts out an awkward, “No, thanks.”
“What
Draco has only ever done this a couple of times, and never with someone he actually cared about, but he wants to make it good for Potter. For Harry.
Hermione insists on going to the library before dinner and he reluctantly accepts.
on himself, feeling the silky texture of the blindfold covering his eyes.
He smiles and gets the quill to write a reply.
“Me too,” Draco says, “and it’s bloody scary.”
He has no clue what she just asked, and she spoke way too fast. Why do they always have to sound like bloody trains when they speak?
“Harry, you can’t be serious!” he says, raising his voice and making Madam Pince glare in their direction. “Sorry…”
“I’ll think about it,” Draco eventually concedes. “But I want Marelli to cast a diagnostic spell on you first, just to make sure your magical core is indeed damaged. And I also want to use my wand to cast the spell, because I have more control with it.”
“Stop laughing like an idiot,” he murmurs. “You might need medical attention after I fuck you senseless.”
“You brought her home,” Harry argues, “so she’s yours too.”
Narcissa looks at him for what feels like ages, then she sighs and sits down again.
Harry faces Draco, wondering if this was a terrible idea, when the professor is suddenly next to Draco, holding his hand out.
“I just wanted to let you know that I have no ill intentions and that I take my job very seriously,” Malfoy finally says. “And I wanted to ask you if you could please not tell Teddy that I’m a wizard.”
He explains how hard life has been for Draco, with people bullying him at school and community service. He asks what the purpose of it all is, after Draco has been acquitted. If revenge is more important than fair justice. If the Aurors should be protecting people, instead of punishing them. If a young wizard should have his wand blocked, making him vulnerable and unable to heal his own wounds.
Harry doesn’t let Draco’s cynicism dampen his enthusiasm, and they spend the rest of the lesson planning their menu. Draco will be in charge of setting the table, since he claims that Harry has ‘the same abysmal sense of décor of a mountain troll’. Harry doesn’t mind, as long as he gets Draco to himself, finally a little more relaxed because he knows Harry won’t ask too many questions when it comes to what he can and cannot touch.
“Yes,” Potter says, moving so that Draco can see the smile on his face. “Yes, take your time. As long as you want.”
Harry elbows him and then he writes a reply, telling Draco that everything will be fine, that he’ll find a way to convince Narcissa. But before he can talk to Hermione to decide what kind of strategy he should use, he receives another owl, the day after.
Forgotten.
“You also seem to know a useful spell for when I have my panic attacks,” added Potter, taking his cloak off. Draco suddenly realised that Potter was going to undress in front of him and felt like he might start hyperventilating himself any minute.
“Harry…” Draco shakes his head and then he covers his face with his hand. “Listen, this is not something you should do just to help a friend. We are talking about a baby! You need to think about it. Besides, I know you’re bisexual; you could still have a family the traditional way.”
Harry moves a little and hears Draco curse under his breath, so he does it again, rocking his hips.
Yes, Harry was really fit and Draco had eyes. Extremely gay eyes. But there was more to it. Potter was no longer a twat. He had grown into a quiet and pleasant man, his sense of humour so attuned to Draco’s. They still had arguments and sometimes drove each other mental, but they had both changed and had surprisingly ended up getting along well with each other.
“Teach me what you like,” he said, kissing the tip of his cock, “I want to make you feel good.”
“I’ll be at the Burrow next Saturday, since it’s the beginning of the Christmas holidays,” Harry says, before parting. “Is it okay if I tell Ron about us?”
So he follows Malfoy down a dark corridor, up a flight of stairs and into a series of rooms that look eerie and decadent, all their lustre gone in their current state of abandonment. The Manor must have looked stunning, Harry thinks, but it’s just a shadow of its former splendour right now, ready to be packed up and sold for the best offer.
He also knows that he needs help too.
“What’s going on?” Harry asks, and they all stop in their tracks, noticing him. The Aurors let go of Draco’s elbows and step away from him. Harry notices the discomfort and embarrassment on the Slytherin’s face as he tries to avoid his eyes.
“Yeah,” Harry mumbles, thinking that he wants this. He wants to feel stable, not to injure anyone with his magic whenever he loses his temper. He remembers when he set Hermione’s hair on fire and thinks
“Good, because you would be crap at it,” Page says viciously, turning to grab Draco’s wrist. “We’re taking him to the Ministry, since it turns out that you both lied, and he can do wandless magic.”
A bruised, hollow face stares back at him from the front page of the paper.
“Potter,” he says, his voice lacking the usual stiffness, sounding almost soft.
“We need to report them to McGonagall,” Ron says, but the Slytherins roll their eyes. “What? You think she won’t punish them?”
Zabini stands there for a few seconds, looking at him like he’s scum.
in so long.
“How did you know?” Draco asks, and the professor points at Draco’s left arm, the sleeves rolled up, exposing part of his beautiful tattoo.
“Forget about that. He doesn’t matter anymore,” Harry says, thinking that he eventually needs to tell Draco the truth, that
Draco takes the box and nearly runs to the kitchen, using Harry’s wand to prepare the kettle as fast as he can. He lets the tea brew and taps his hand on the table as he waits for it to be ready. Harry feels as if his stomach is in knots as he watches Draco pour the hot liquid into a pale blue teacup, waiting for it to start doing what the lady at the shop advertised.
“My life,” Harry murmured, “it’s all just a mess.”
“I wish I could have been stronger. I wish I hadn’t given in to my family’s pressure to marry a witch. I wish I could be with you right now, where I belong. I miss you like air. Henry.”
between you been going on for?” Narcissa asks, looking confused. Harry wonders how Draco has managed to keep it all secret, because he’s frankly terrified of his mother.
“You bought meat,” he repeats. “I’m not a charity case, Potter.”
“Why?” Harry asks, “Theo’s nose is crooked and his teeth are all wonky. And besides, he’s a twat. I have a perfectly straight nose and good teeth. Okay, I’m a bit short, but I reckon it’s because I didn’t have enough to eat when I was a kid. And I never get sick, plus I don’t snore.”
“Hmm,” Draco murmurs, placing a tender kiss on Harry’s lips. “It’s just because we’re both a little fucked up.”
“Why are you so nice to me?”
“I thought it was a study room,” Harry mutters, confused, which makes Parkinson giggle.
“Who died?” Potter asked, then horrified “please tell me you’re not doing it for
“I…” Draco says, breaking the kiss, “it’s a good thing you can’t see me.”
The night stretches on endlessly between one nightmare and the next.
Draco felt the same, claiming Harry’s lips again and again, feeling him hardening against his own stiff cock. His brain was short-circuiting, unable to understand why Harry would want this, with him of all people.
“I tripped and fell over,” Draco replies, his jaw tense as he scribbles something on his parchment. Harry grabs his wrist to stop him, and Draco freezes.
“Let’s go see McGonagall before breakfast,” he tells a sleepy Draco as he emerges from the shower. The blond grumbles and puts his uniform on, casting a drying charm on his hair.
“No one would take me as an apprentice,” Malfoy replies with a shrug. “Not even Slughorn. I’ve sent so many owls, and no one is willing to let me train, so there’s no point.”
Monday is the last day at the Manor. Harry feels strangely sad, as if he’s going to miss the wretched house and its festering magic. The West Wing is still cordoned off, and the Aurors are worried that they’ll never get rid of the rotten spells Voldemort has placed to guard it.
“I have a lot of time on my hands,” Draco replies and then the tip of his wand glows blue and flashes for a second. A small flat stone appears just above the lock. “Ah, got it. That’s not too bad.”
“Maybe it’s Theo’s fault,” Harry says, feeling desperate and trying to come up with a plan to avoid the car crash that Draco seems to be headed towards. Where the fuck is Hermione when he needs a genius idea? “Maybe he’s the one who can’t have babies.”
“If that’s the only problem,” Marelli says with a smile, waving his hand, “I managed to pull some strings at the Ministry. I have friends there, and Shaklebolt owed me a favour. I spoke to him yesterday, and he said that as long as you get at least five Os in your N.E.W.T.s, you can go to Italy to study and spend the rest of your sentence there.”
“But, Har-“
“Ready?” Harry asks, arousal making him confused and then it finally hits him, just as Draco is lifting himself up and guiding Harry’s cock towards him, sinking slowly. “Shit, fuck, Draco…”
Maybe he should sneak downstairs, ask if Draco is okay. What if he needs something? He doesn’t even have his wand on him; that must be terrifying. Harry remembers how powerless he felt when he didn’t have his own.
The blond stands up, knocking the boxes away, sending photos and documents flying in his haste to leave. He doesn’t even say goodbye as he runs away, leaving Harry on the floor, feeling lost and like a complete and utter moron.
“Oh, please,” Hermione huffs. “It’s written all over your face.”
Draco goes to the en suite and Harry’s left there, pondering what to do. Shall he just apparate home and pretend that the night they’ve spent together was just a dream? Shall he kiss Draco good morning?
Harry makes a strangled noise, and Draco drops the wand and cups his cheeks.
“They’re hand-me-downs,” Harry mutters, his cheeks colouring, “Ron’s mum gave them to me. They used to belong to Charlie. We are more or less the same size.”
“Hermione…”
They get on with their lives instead. Draco looks for a job, sending a million owls that always come back without a reply. Potter continues going to work, even though his job is slowly breaking him to pieces.
“That you’re leaving me,” Harry whispers. “Because I’m all wrong.”
“Draco,” Harry says desperately, looking at his boyfriend for support. “What did she ask me?”
,” Harry replies. “What about you, Ron?”
“Okay,” Harry says smiling, relieved but still a bit confused, moving closer and running his fingers along Draco’s jaw.
“Come with me to Grimmauld Place for Christmas,” he whispers against Draco’s lips, then kisses him again, this time with more heat, making Draco moan softly. “Kingsley gave us permission to spend the holidays together, if you want to.”
He starts running, away from Draco, away from the classrooms, up a flight of stairs, down a corridor, then turning around a corner.
He didn’t know if it was because of Potter’s magic or if it was the room itself, adjusting to their feelings and needs as McGonagall had said it would, but the sofa became smaller and smaller, day by day.
“Are you saving yourself for marriage or something?” Ron asks, and Neville starts spluttering and coughing, as Zabini shakes his head and rubs his back.
“It’s a surprise,” the Slytherin replies.
He woke up half naked, wearing only his underwear and Harry’s arm around him. He could feel the Gryffindor stirring, his bare chest pressed against Draco’s back, trailing soft kisses on his neck and rocking his hips against Draco’s arse.
Harry looks at Malfoy’s cup and at the words forming there, as the letters swoop and dance across the white porcelain.
“It’s more overwhelming when I can see you,” Harry says with a shrug.
“Nice?” Draco repeats, arching an eyebrow. “That was fucking amazing.”
were at school last year. We were camping around the country.”
It’s dirty and neglected, but Draco has spent nearly a year under house arrest on his own, looking after a huge Manor in the best possible way. He starts casting repairing spells on the broken furniture, then he cleans the house, getting rid of a Boggart and several other creatures that decided to make their nests here and there.
Maybe his letter where he said he wanted Harry was just a ruse to get him to open up and tomorrow all their correspondence will be published in the Prophet. Harry’s stomach churns painfully and he touches his belly, his fingers clutching the soft fabric of his faded t-shirt.
Harry thinks Draco is going to tell him to fuck off, that he’s not a bloody toddler. But Draco’s lips are slightly parted as his hand reaches for the soft toy, gently stroking the worn-out fur and bringing it to his chest.
“Come, I’ll show you,” Malfoy says, leaving the library and taking Harry to his secret room. Harry is always surprised by the amount of things Malfoy has managed to hide in the tiny room over the years. It looks like an ordered kind of mess, because Malfoy seems to know where everything is, in spite of it looking like a labyrinth of boxes and trunks to Harry.
“Hermione will be a nuisance though,” Draco points out. “She’ll tell you that you need to be a responsible adult now that you’re in your mid-twenties and settle for one job instead of trying a different thing every month.”
“You’re the most unlikely bouncer I’ve ever met,” Harry teases, and she pulls her tongue at him. “How have you been?”
“Draco…” Harry’s index finger brushes against Draco’s thumb. It’s a soft and simple gesture, but he feels sparks where their skin touches and Draco’s eyes lock with his.
“What kind of poisonous concoction are you brewing?” Page asks Draco, and Harry clenches his jaw, wanting to barge in and hex the Auror.
By lunchtime Harry is starving, since they skipped the usual tea and biscuits session in the morning, though Malfoy would not tell him why. But then Miffy appears with a tray and Harry’s mouth starts watering as he looks at the roast chicken and vegetables in front of him.
“I love you,” he whispers, and Draco starts crying. Harry takes his hand and guides him to bed, holding him under the blankets until Draco stops shivering and sobbing.
But then Harry thinks back at Malfoy’s pale face and long dirty hair as he stood in front of the Wizengamot, his cheeks hollow, dark shades under his grey eyes after two months spent in Azkaban. He wonders if he was beaten up or hexed by the guards, now that the Dementors are gone.
“But why?” Harry asks, still not sure why on earth Gregory Goyle is teaching a first-year how to knit and Zabini is whispering something that is making the seventh-year Gryffindor splutter and gasp.
“You’re not a killer,” Harry says, moving Draco’s arm to stare at his eyes. He remembers Dumbledore’s words. Draco’s silver eyes lock with his. They look vulnerable and hurt. “I have killed someone. I know what it’s like. You are not a killer”
“That’s different,” he says.
Harry holds his hips and slams his cock into Draco’s tight heat, feeling like he’s going to come any minute, and then Draco moans loudly and Harry feels his warm come hitting his belly and the blonde is suddenly so tight, clenching around him. Harry hears a
He shrugs.
The mark gleams green, and Draco winces in pain, but then the light is gone, and nothing seems to change. Draco groans in frustration.
“What was that about?” Harry asks Hermione on their way to McGonagall’s lesson.
Rome is chaotic and breath-taking. There are so many things to see at every corner, layers of history overlapping and co-existing in the most mind-blowing way. Harry feels overwhelmed once again, but this time they take it little by little. They spend time walking around, visiting the churches with the paintings that nearly make him cry, because they are so stunning and powerful that what he has seen in Petunia’s books cannot even compare to the reality in front of him.
They end up being late for DADA, and Marelli gives them a funny look when they walk in together, but he doesn’t say anything to them.
“About time,” Draco mutters darkly, putting his cloak on and levitating his trunk out of the portrait hole. “Have a nice Christmas, Blaise and Longbottom!”
“She’s not my girlfriend!” Harry says, but Malfoy still ignores his eyes, looking unconvinced. Harry doesn’t know why it even bothers him. It’s not like Malfoy is his boyfriend.
Ron opens his box and
Draco lets out a little laugh, pulling him down for another kiss.
After an hour of peaceful reading, Draco looked at his pocket watch and decided that it was time to head for the Great Hall for breakfast. He was starving, his stomach empty and churning painfully, but as soon as he got there, he felt the dread from the night before. The memories of that night, of all the corpses laid to rest. His soulmate amongst them.
“It’s okay,” Draco whispers, pulling him closer. “Whenever you’re ready, my love.”
“It’s fine,” Harry lies, feeling cold sweat running down his back, his palms damp as he rubs them on his jeans.
“Thanks,” Harry whispers and Draco chuckles.
“So you’re staying,” Harry says awkwardly, and Neville smiles timidly.
“Death Eater scum!” someone shouts from behind them, and Harry quickly casts a
“You should get checked at St Mungo’s,” Smith mutters, standing up.
All he could see were the bodies.
“I don’t want to talk about it,” Draco replies, his shoe gently rubbing against Harry’s, who suddenly wishes they were barefoot. Why does he become stupid as soon as Draco touches him?
Harry wishes he could retort that he
So he makes his third mistake.
“That was nice,” Harry says, the cold air making him feel awake again. “They’re a lovely family.”
“Hiya, Harry,” he waves timidly.
He unfolds the parchment and his eyes open wide when he realises who it’s from.
Malfoy nods, handing him the box labelled ‘Potter’ and standing up.
“Just wondering if she’s alright,” Harry shrugs. “I haven’t seen her since the Trials.”
They spend the rest of the trip talking and then sharing some food, trying to keep the rest of the students outside their compartment.
Charm on himself as he arrives with the other Aurors.
“Harry, please…” Draco begs desperately, and Harry finally positions himself behind him and sinks inside his wet heat, groaning at how unbelievably intense it always feels, even though they’ve done this so many times.
“I would be surprised if you weren’t just a little bit, after all you’ve been through. Besides, have you seen me?” Draco asks with a fond smile on his face. “I can’t even sleep unless I check under the bed first, and I wash my hands until they’re raw. But your heart is in the right place, Harry. You’re so full of love, and you’re the most wonderful person I’ve ever met in my pitiful life. You make my life a million times better.”
Harry stands his ground, clutching his wand so tightly that he fears it might snap. Kingsley studies him, his eyes landing on Harry’s neck, and he frowns. Harry blushes, remembering spotting a massive bruise there in the morning, after Draco spent the previous evening desperately sucking on his neck like a starving vampire.
“Draco, the cloak…” Harry murmurs and Draco’s grey eyes finally lock with his and he smiles. It’s the most beautiful smile Harry’s ever seen in his life and it fills his heart with so much happiness. Harry’s frozen to the spot, staring at Draco’s perfect porcelain skin, at his white-blond hair, longer than he remembers. There’s a gentle
Harry chuckles and kisses the tip of his nose, making Draco blush.
publishes new harrowing photos of Draco getting attacked by faceless witches and wizards, the Headmistress looks like she’s ready to set fire to all the papers in the Great Hall. She takes Draco aside, and they have breakfast in her office, sparing him the worst of the other students’ reactions. Harry’s grateful for it, but he still wishes he could do more.
“It’s November and we haven’t had a single date,” Ron complains when she disappears behind a shelf to look for more books. “Are we ever going to have sex?”
“Tastes a bit weird,” Potter says, trying the pasta, and Draco feels like hexing him and then throwing away all the food, but then Potter adds. “I’m not used to home-cooked food anymore. But it’s not bad.”
“My body’s not as lovely as yours,” Draco eventually replies, avoiding his eyes.
“I thought I’d take it here, do you mind?” he asks. Harry puts his hand on Draco’s arms and strokes it gently. “It’s just that it’s bloody horrible when you do it on your own and it always turns out negative. I just feel like I’m lacking something vital. Like there’s something wrong with me.”
The witch in charge of the Archives reminds him of Madam Pince, with her stern manners and grumpy face, but as soon as he takes the cloak off, she jumps in surprise and then becomes incredibly nice and polite. She answers all of his questions and escorts him to a deserted section of the Archives that might contain some useful information for him. It’s a small and stuffy room, with long rows of high shelves and a dark blue carpet. Harry runs his fingers over dusty folders containing thousands of letters and documents, wishing he had Hermione there to help him.
"I love you, Draco."
“Things like clothes don’t matter to me. I grew up wearing my cousin’s hand-me-down clothes, oversized and faded t-shirts and jeans that had seen better days. Any house, new or old, would still never feel like home, unless
“I’m seven years old,” Teddy replies proudly. “If my mates see me, they’re going to take the mickey until Christmas.”
“Are you planning on formally courting my son, Mr Potter?” Narcissa asks, studying him.
“I…” Harry says, eyes locking with his. “I spoke to Andromeda. She says she wants to ask you to move in with her and Teddy.”
Draco’s hands still and he looks at Harry, his face turning pale.
“I need to find a quiet place to concentrate, otherwise I’ll never get this fucking essay done,” he declares.
“Waiting for Draco to finish taking his shower, so that I can have a chat with him,” Harry replies, deciding to opt for honesty and realising that Zabini will never believe him. “He knows I’m here.”
“Hmm,” Harry whimpers, and then he lets out a loud gasp as Draco’s slicked up finger gently presses against him, slowly sliding inside as Draco suckles on the tip of his cock.
“This is the end. It’s not going to happen ever again,” Draco replies, as if he were talking to an idiot or a little child. “We were alone here, so it was safe. What if someone finds out at Hogwarts?”
“Shhh…shut up and enjoy my Slytherin lovemaking,” he whispered, making Harry laugh again. He teased him for what felt like ages before he finally started pounding into him, making Harry see the stars under his eyelids as he came with Draco’s name on his lips.
Harry gapes as he takes it all in. The photo of him taking Ginny’s arm, a smile on their faces. The way Ginny kisses his cheek on a loop. Draco’s horrified expression.
“Do you want to smash my tea set against the wall?” the Slytherin suddenly asks.
“You were just sixteen,” Potter said, his tone serious, as his fingers trembled over Draco’s skin, going lower, tracing his ribs and moving down, so slowly. “We were kids.”
“Err…” Harry comments, but Draco nods and says Harry will think about it, a serious expression on his face.
“You did,” Malfoy says, his eyes finally meeting Harry’s, sharp and lucid. “But it’s fine. I was about to hurt you, too. I deserved it.”
“I don’t think we’re making it back to the club today.”
Draco couldn’t put his hands on when it happened, but he was sure he wasn’t going crazy.
are passed around. Harry sits down, and Hermione scowls as she receives her own newspaper from an exhausted looking owl that nearly crashes into Ron’s bowl of cereal.
“How?” Draco asked, his pupils blown wide.
Harry scowls and takes a step into the kitchen, heading for the larder and grabbing a few ingredients, then settling at the table with a chopping board and a pan.
“We could swap rooms, you know?” Zabini says, crossing his arms in front of his chest. “It would give me a chance to spend more time with Longbottom too. Two pigeons with one stone.”
He takes a deep breath and opens the front gate. It’s a warm sunny afternoon and the gardens are beautiful. Pink and red dahlias flutter in the wind and he spots colourful bushes of red daisies (he vaguely remembers Aunt Petunia calling them Mexican sunflowers). His eyes roam across the grass and that’s when he spots him.
“Everybody out, now!” he bellows. “Leave the room!”
“About me?”
“Okay, then. You can have me,” Draco concedes.
“Harry!” a familiar voice calls from the office. “I was on my way home, and I thought I saw your face peeping from the waiting room!”
“Makes me feel safe,” Harry mumbles, before he finally lets sleep claim him.
The words won’t come out of Harry’s mouth as he’s trying to catch his breath, but Draco shushes him, stroking his hair until Harry feels like he’s not going to faint anymore, and his trembling fingers rest on Draco’s wrists, needing to touch him, to feel him there.
“Potter, shut up and sit down,” Draco hisses with a glare and the Medi-witch finally stops casting spells and takes a step back.
“I don’t know,” the midwife replies. “You’ve already sent him your Patronus twice and I wouldn’t advise wasting any more of your magic. Now, focus on breathing.”
“Merlin, you’re such a moron, Potter.”
“We’re going to be so late,” Draco says, out of breath, brushing a strand of hair from his face, and then Harry has an idea. He feels filthy just for thinking about it, but then he simply can’t help it.
So he moves back into Sirius’s old and dusty house (he doesn’t feel like he can call it home, not yet at least), leaving his trunk at the entrance and slouching on the sofa in the drawing room on the first floor, Kreacher fussing over him.
then?” Draco inquires, looking serious as he takes notes. Harry can’t help but notice that the drawings the blond has done of different kitchen appliances are impressive.
He should Apparate back home, he knows.
“How very noble of you to always stay behind and help Draco pack up,” Zabini teases Harry, a knowing look on his face, eyes like a tiger.
“I’ve been in love with you for ages,” Draco replies, sheepishly, “I was just terrified of telling you. I’ve never told anyone before.”
“I can ask Ron,” he says, pressing his lips on the corner of Draco’s mouth. “I’ll convince him.”
Draco’s grey eyes peek from under his fingers, his cheeks flushed in embarrassment.
By dinnertime Harry is knackered and just wants to go to sleep. The atmosphere in the common room is still odd. It feels awkward to be in mixed Houses, to share living quarters with the Slytherins. Ernie and Terry are friendly and seem to be happy to play a game of Exploding Snap with Neville and Ron, but Zacharias Smith disappears inside their dorm as soon as he comes in through the portrait hole. Zabini, Parkinson and Malfoy sit in a corner, huddled on a small green sofa, whispering conspiratorially between them.
“Shall we have tea?” Harry asks. Malfoy ignores him for a couple of moments and then nods. “Why are you being odd?”
“Of course,” Marelli says, his eyes shining with curiosity. “If you don’t mind opening your robes, Harry. I just need to cast the spell where your heart is.”
“It’s…” Draco mumbles, turning his head to face him, his cheeks scarlet and eyes so bright. “It’s dirty…”
“Oh,” Harry whispers. He has received a million job offers. From the Aurors, to Quidditch Teams, charities and organisations that deal with post-war negotiations. He has stuffed all the letters in a drawer and has been purposely trying to ignore them.
Draco’s eyes open again, and they meet Harry’s. He touches Draco’s face with delicate fingertips, running a pad on the scar across his nose and lips, following all the way down his chest. Harry takes his pale hand and places it on his own heart.
“I’m kicking you out in the morning,” he replies, his fingers digging into Harry’s hips as he pressed even closer against his chest, “I don’t want you to end up in even more trouble than you’re already in.”
Venice, Florence, Rome, Naples.
“What the fuck, Harry!” Draco says, leaning closer to examine the map. His hair brushes against Harry’s face, making him tilt his chin up, their noses bumping together. “Is that how you spy on people? An enchanted map of the castle?”
“Did you tell your Gryffindor friends that you and Draco are an item?” Pansy asks, offering him a bowl of blueberries. “Eat those, they’re good for your hair. Maybe one day we’ll manage to brush it without needing to cast a hundred spells first.”
“Yes,” Draco replies, a smile on his lips, finally feeling home. “I’ll stay.”
Harry keeps on peeking around, looking for a white-blond head, but Draco is not there. He sees Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini, both nervous and weary and keeping to themselves at the other end of the table. There’s Ernie McMillan, Zacharias Smith and Terry Boot, all looking anxious as their eyes wander around the room.
Draco pushes him onto the bed and stares at him, his eyes shining in the dim light filtering from under the thin curtains.
The night is long and feels so lonely, each passing hour an added weight on his already heavy heart. He wonders when it will eventually get crushed. What will be left of him.
In the afternoon Potter sometimes would go to the library with Longbottom or Lovegood, other times he studied with Draco in their room, asking for his help when he was struggling. He wasn’t actually that bad, now that his main focus in life was not avoiding getting murdered by a maniac. They always had dinner together, Draco helping with the preparation of the ingredients, Potter cooking in silence while Draco studied some more.
When he found the courage to ask, Harry just stared at him first.
“What?” Draco asks, his mouth full of food, cheeks stuffed as if he were a hamster. Harry starts laughing, and the Slytherin frowns at him. “Bloody Gryffindors.”
“Well, yeah,” Harry shrugs. “We’re all blokes anyway.”
“Hmm,” Harry hums, wishing he could kiss him. He loves feeling Draco so relaxed against him, sluggish and soft after his orgasm.
They go to work, have lunch at the Cafeteria, which smells revolting all of a sudden, and Draco makes Harry tea just the way he likes it. They still don’t date. But Draco often spends the night and holds Harry while he sleeps. And repeat.
“Oh,” Malfoy says, his cheeks definitely looking pink now. “I…in that case,
Malfoy cups his own balls, letting out a moan and then he casts several cleaning charms on himself. Harry is wondering why on earth he’s doing that when Malfoy’s slick finger gently prods his entrance and then slowly slides inside, making Harry moan out loud at the sight. He leans closer to see better, making Malfoy smirk as his finger slides in and out.
them, and they fly out of his trunk. He signs the document, and Chloe grins at him.
“Okay,” it’s a mere whisper, a puff of air out of Draco’s mouth that changes everything and sets Harry’s blood alight. He gets up and drags Draco to the nearest floo apparition point, ignoring his spluttering and outraged gasps at being manhandled.
“Can I heal your wounds first?” Harry asks, a little too hopeful.
“You might still need a good knowledge of potions to help George, though,” Hermione argues as Ron winces. “Consider all the Wheezes that went terribly wrong and the side effects
Harry feels Draco stiffen next to him, but then the lesson is over and the Slytherin slips away. He joins Pansy and Blaise for Charms, without casting a glance in Harry’s direction for the entire duration of their lesson.
’s front page had a giant photo of Harry holding Hermione for dear life, titling that the Boy Who Lived Twice had eventually cracked. He was finally crying.
“I didn’t mind having it, you know?” he whispers in Draco’s ear, making Chloe blush and Kingsley roll his eyes again.
“You don’t get it!” he shouted.
“I’m going to have to get a Portkey and go to England pretty soon,” Draco announces one evening as Harry is making the sauce for lasagne, using the recipe their neighbour gave them. He freezes as he’s preparing the lasagne sheets and stares at the blond.
Harry beams and relaxes, thinking he will still have a chance to spend some time in class with Draco, maybe get the blond to help him. He crosses out the messages and writes a new one.
Harry gives him his wand, and Draco casts the spell, his finch appearing and fluttering around Harry.
“It turns out I missed you too much to stay at the Burrow without you,” was Harry’s sheepish reply.
He feels torn. He feels like his heart is bleeding from several different wounds, like a million papercuts on his ventricles and valves. He fears it will never be the same.
,” Harry says, and Malfoy stops in his tracks, grey eyes locking with his. “You saved my life too, so we’re even.”
The blond looks around the dark and dusty room, taking it all in.
Argo arrives the following morning.
“Please,” Harry finds himself whispering. And then Draco’s soft lips are pressed against his, making him close his eyes in the darkness, reaching for Draco’s robes, his fingers holding the Slytherin’s hips and dragging him closer. Draco sighs and opens his mouth a fraction and that’s all Harry needs to deepen the kiss, to slide his tongue inside and taste him, making them both moan and whimper. Draco’s fingers card through his messy curls as he sucks on Harry’s bottom lip, making him groan.
“Harry?” Draco’s suddenly beside him, his hand on Harry’s back.
Draco nods, and Harry wishes they could Apparate straight away, but the streets are packed with tourists, and Harry feels all the eyes on them.
And then the following Sunday, Molly says something that Harry doesn’t catch because he’s busy discussing Quidditch with George, but then the room falls silent and Harry looks at Draco, pale and still.
“Harry, calm down,” Draco says, standing up and putting a hand on Harry’s arm. And he’s always so warm and his skin is so soft that Harry feels like he’s about to break into a million pieces. “I know you’re a good friend and you’re trying to help by being a Gryffindor, but you can’t be serious about this.”
“Oh, sod them!” Hermione says, making him laugh. “Have you told him?”
“Not now,” Harry replies, his green eyes still glued to Draco, to the look of absolute horror on his face.
“Are you ashamed?” Harry asked, wondering if Draco’s old beliefs about blood purity are still making him obtuse.
“Nothing, why?” was Harry’s reply.
He wishes to disappear.
“Fuck,” a whisper behind Harry.
You can come and say hello on
“Of course, I do,” he replies, because he thought that was evident.
The afternoon goes by in a blur, and then the sky turns dark again and the rain falls incessantly, like a never-ending deluge.
Harry pushes, but it doesn’t go in at first, so he starts getting anxious.
“No worries,” Malfoy answers, “I knew it was getting late, but I wanted to help you.”
“Salazar, you really are sappy,” Draco murmurs, but Harry can see his cheeks flushing pink and his wings closing around them. Draco’s eyes shine in the dim afternoon light, under the shadow cast by his wings. “Alright. As you wish, Harry.”
“Like a friend,” he mutters.
“Not far off,” Harry responds absent-mindedly, and then he hears a groan.
Harry finishes changing in silence, wondering if he just imagined the fact that Malfoy – no, Draco – was about to kiss him. He leaves his tie undone and ruffles his curls as he steps back into the room. Draco is staring at him, a curious expression on his face.
The following morning, they get on a boat and leave for Sardinia. Draco looks green for most of the trip, and Harry gently rubs his back until they finally reach land.
“Thanks, Laura,” Malfoy says and then nods at Harry, his cheeks still pink as he stares at him. “It was a pleasure to meet you, Mr Potter.”
On the second Saturday of October, Draco comes back after community service, and Harry freezes when he sees him. He’s wearing Muggle clothes, an oversized grey faded t-shirt and loose jeans. They’re covered in dirt, and Draco’s face is streaked with tears as he crosses the common room, heading for his room.
“Marelli thinks your magical core has been compromised,” Draco ventures, staring at him, checking that Harry is fine at the mention of the professor. “We talked about it, but now that I know what happened to you during the war, his theory kind of makes sense. It could be that your core was damaged when you died and parted with the fragment of the Dark Lord’s soul.”
“A little bit,” Harry replies, his heart so full that it’s about to burst.
Harry’s cheeks colour again and he finishes munching on his sandwich in silence, not knowing how to reply to Malfoy’s compliments.
So he waits.
“I have a house,” Potter declares tentatively after a few seconds.
“I can check where he is,” Harry replies, “I have a map.”
“Pleasure,” Ron mutters, and Harry can see that even his ears have turned beet red in his embarrassment.
“Do any of you know anything about who beat up Malfoy yesterday?” Harry asks, his tone authoritative and voice still charged with barely suppressed anger. Terry shrugs, but Zacharias Smith smirks. “Smith?”
And Draco really wanted to be taken.
,” he whispers, and Harry gasps as the scars appear. There’s a gash across his face, under his eyes and over his nose, and one on his right cheek, like a ramification of the scars on his neck.
“You’ll be amazing,” Harry says and he’s sure of it, but she still grimaces and crosses her fingers.
“Mhh,” Malfoy hums, shuddering through the aftershocks of his orgasm, eyes still focused on Harry, trying to catch his breath. “I wish I could take my Pensieve to Hogwarts to see this over and over again.”
“If you think it’s acceptable to have a fight the first minute you’re back here,” she started saying, but then she noticed Harry shaking his head and Draco’s panicked expression and stopped.
“Stop smiling like a lunatic,” Draco says, elbowing him. His cheeks are flushed prettily, and Harry leans forward to place a kiss on them. “Merlin, you’re such a sap. What did I get myself into?”
Harry shakes his head and smiles, then he gets parchment and quill and writes his reply, Argo hooting merrily at his side.
He barely slept that night, the pain from his wounds and the thought that he had kissed Harry keeping him awake for hours. He wondered whether the Gryffindor had done it out of pity. Curiosity, perhaps. Maybe loneliness.
“Salazar, why do you have to look like that?” Malfoy mutters, and Harry tilts his head.
Harry’s mouth hangs open and he stares at Draco, who is blushing like a tomato and looking at his nails as if they were the most interesting thing on the planet.
“Why do you even bother?” Draco replies. “I'll just have new ones tomorrow.”
“What did you mean when you said that you died?”
Malfoy sighs and rolls his eyes.
“Harry, I’m so fucked up,” the blond whimpers. Harry shushes him and pours some shampoo onto his hand, washing Draco’s long hair methodically, getting completely soaked in the process. He lets Draco cry, shuddering while Harry washes him. Harry keeps on telling him that everything will be fine, even though he has begun to doubt it himself.
Draco’s gaze softens and he moves closer, abandoning the bread and ham on the counter. He kneels in front of Harry and puts his hands on Harry’s arms.
“Shh,” Draco chides, “we’re just at the beginning. Relax, Harry. You’re so sensitive.”
“Come closer,” Malfoy says, his voice low and inviting. “Sit on the bed, next to me.”
He shows him memories of the punishments. Of Vernon shouting at him until his voice grew hoarse. Of Petunia making him clean the whole house without gloves, leaving his little hands raw and painful. Of Dudley hitting him. Of getting burnt whilst cooking with pans and pots when he was still in primary school.
"What is this?" Harry asks, holding the odd golden ball.
“Potter, it’s Saturday,” he says, looking at him like he’s lost the plot. Harry thinks he probably has, to be fair.
Harry wonders how to explain, whether to actually tell him or not. He thinks of all the photos in Malfoy’s room, of the happiness on his face as his mother held him and tickled his tummy. Of the few photos he’s seen of himself, a blurry inconvenience in the background, clothes unkept and face forlorn.
Malfoy’s gay.
“So, you’re not together?” Molly asks, frowning, “but a baby needs a family.”
The Auror’s lips part, her smile disappearing as she stares at Harry and then at Draco, but then she quickly schools her expression back into her pleasant cheerfulness.
Potter’s fingers gently brushed against his cheek, warm and comforting beyond words.
“I want you to fuck me,” he says, when Harry starts bobbing his head up and down his length again, faster. Draco doesn’t want to come so soon, but he’s already feeling overwhelmed. “Harry, I want you inside me.”
“Do you want to spend the night? Or do you have another date tomorrow?” Draco asks, looking at him with those silvery eyes that make Harry weak in the knees.
“Night, Draco,” Potter whispered.
He just needs to find a way inside.
“I’ve never done this before,” Draco murmurs, a smirk on his beautiful face as he starts moving, his lips parting to let out a little moan. “
“It’s weird; they seem to be either quite young or older than thirty,” Harry observes. “Why is there a gap?”
“No,” Harry sobs, “I’m just in love with him and I miss him so much.”
And Draco had a million questions swimming in his head. Such as, why me? Why Draco, after all the hatred they had shared? After their horrible past and Draco’s endless list of mistakes.
“Hm?”
Draco Malfoy. He’s not a stranger. They’ve both spent their entire time at Hogwarts spying on each other, learning to read each other’s expressions and body language. Harry can still remember the feeling of searching for Malfoy’s name on the Marauder’s Map and the excitement of finding it.
“Maybe they will make an exception for some personal items,” Harry says, his voice tainted with mild panic. “They won’t need your photos or your teddy. If you ask them nicely, they might let you take them.”
“Mhh,” Harry agrees, still out of words. He lets Draco cast a gentle cleaning spell on both of them, and then pale fingers interlace with his as Draco takes him to the bathroom and starts the hot water.
Harry doesn’t want to think about all the birthdays he’s had without cake. He doesn’t want Malfoy to know or to read it on his face. He empties his plate in silence, and then the cake appears. And it’s not just a cake.
“Harry,” one ventures, “we were wondering if you would go out on a date with one of us on Saturday.”
“Has it ever crossed your mind that maybe you couldn’t get it up with Ginevra because she’s a woman?” Draco asks as his fingers keep on moving over his length, but then they still. Harry is feeling a bit shivery and shaken from his nightmares, and the question confuses him at first. He closes his eyes, resting his cheek against Draco’s chest. His heart is beating steadily in his chest, grounding Harry.
obsessed. But it's a different kind of obsession this time. Because all that's on his mind these days is Draco’s forlorn face, the red patches on his knuckles, his hollowing cheeks and sad eyes. The smell of his hair, the taste of his skin. Harry wonders what kind of noises Draco would make under his hands. He spends hours awake in bed, imagining the feeling of his lips against Draco’s. He wants to see Draco slowly falling apart under him, because of him. He wants to make him smile. To hear the sound of his laughter again. That's all he can think about, really.
“Hey, I didn’t think you’d come today, birthday boy,” Draco says and he looks so soft, sitting on the sofa in his pyjamas, curled up like a cat with a book in his lap and his hair down. He notices straight away that something’s up with Harry and he rushes to him. “What’s wrong; why are you crying, Harry?”
“I’m an emotional mess today,” Draco says, rubbing his eyes. His braid has come undone and Harry wants to sink his fingers into Draco’s hair, loosen it up and then massage his scalp. He wonders if Draco will ever let him do it. “Maybe we should start tomorrow…if you’re free…”
And Harry feels better, his heart lighter knowing that Draco still wants to see him.
?” Pansy says, her smile reaching Cheshire Cat proportions.
Draco starts moving around the cottage, opening cupboards and boxes, uncovering old clothes, teacups and plates, more books and a stash of letters.
Please leave a comment to let me know what you thought of this fic. 💙
They kiss, and Harry starts crying too, feeling like his heart is bare and beating at a different rhythm than usual. His trousers are all wet, and he’s starting to get cold, but Draco’s lips are so warm on his own, and they hold each other under the sun, rocking to an imaginary music.
“Wow,” he breathes out.
A mere whisper comes out of Draco’s mouth, “Why?”
“Before you start lecturing me,” Harry says to her, “I’m helping them because I made them lose a lot of points and I was feeling responsible for the damage I caused.”
“Y-yes,” Draco replies, wondering how on earth Potter hasn’t realised that Draco was cooking it for
“I shall talk to Draco and make a decision,” she eventually says, “you may leave now.”
“I didn’t know I had to wear formal robes for a wank,” he replies, feeling brave, and Malfoy scoffs. “I’m sorry, next time I will try to wear appropriate clothing.”
“What?” he asks, confused.
“You’re so tight, love,” Harry mumbles, shallow pushes turning into deep thrusts as Draco pants and moans under him. Harry runs his hand over the small of his back and enjoys the feeling of Draco shuddering and whimpering under him. He fucks him deep and hard until Draco is begging to come, and Harry is on the brink of a mind-blowing orgasm himself. He strokes Draco once, twice, and then the blond comes with a shuddered gasp, painting the bedsheets with his release. Harry fucks him fast, letting go as he comes deep inside him, Draco’s name on his lips like a never-ending prayer.
?” Draco hisses. “Imagine how
“Malfoy stayed behind to help me with homework,” Harry repeats, leaving out the fact that they actually spent a good part of the evening just chatting. And that they were about to kiss in the corridor. Probably. Hopefully. “It was my fault if he lost seventy points. Malfoy hid me to take the blame with Filch.”
“You’re going to be brilliant,” Draco whispers, lips brushing against Harry’s in an almost kiss that leaves him a little desperate. He leans forward and lets his mouth press against Draco’s, his tongue sliding inside, until they’re both breathless and flushed.
“We didn’t get to see a single lake during our trip to the Lake District,” he explains. “I think they’re well due. We can also stop by some of the vineyards in Franciacorta and buy some wine. It’s really nice; you’ll see.”
“I want to look at myself in the mirror and not feel like a complete and utter failure,” Draco continues, a sob escaping his lips as he starts shuddering. “I want to go back in time and undo all my terrible mistakes.”
Harry wakes up on Saturday with a headache and cotton wool in his brain. He takes a shower that wakes him up and then he has a cup of tea in the back garden, squeezed on the ground among briars and brambles.
“I like doing things the Muggle way,” Harry says with a smile, thinking that he’s not going to pass on the chance of touching Draco, since this might be his only occasion.
Harry simply nods, feeling Zabini and Parkinson’s eyes on him. Goyle doesn’t seem to care about Harry and his silly costume, as long as he gets to take his own off.
“You did a good job with that,” Marelli comments with an appreciative whistle. “You’ll have no trouble drawing a repairing tattoo on Harry. Just remember that it needs to be over his heart.”
“I’d rather not,” he had said, forcing him to take a walk in the gardens, their steps on the gravel loud and surreal, until Potter had come to a stop and had taken the wand out, handing it to him without a word.
“I saw him heading towards the lake with a group of seventh years,” a Ravenclaw girl says, sitting on Parkinson’s sofa. Harry notices the way Zabini turns and stares at Goyle, his back stiffening.
And now Harry feels like someone’s just pulled the rug out from under his feet.
“Come on,” Parkinson says with a sly smile on her face. “Let’s go to your room so that I can tell you about all the amazing sex I had with Theo. We can share advice.”
Harry still doesn’t get it, but then the other Aurors come to get him and it’s time to leave. He doesn’t say goodbye to Malfoy; he simply nods at him and leaves.
“If you’re done with your exploration of Muggle appliances,” Potter said, “I can start cooking dinner.”
“Don’t make that face,” Draco murmurs, brushing his thumb against Harry’s cheekbone, smoothing out the lines next to his eye. “It’s going to be fine.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m going to fucking kill her,” he hisses, while Harry laughs and sinks back into his arms, his hand circling Draco's waist as he casts a cleaning charm on them.
obsessed.
“Well, I turned twenty-five last week,” Draco says and then stops.
“It’s my home,” Harry argues, but Kingsley looks at him firmly, and Harry feels powerless and angry.
“What on earth is this place?” Harry asks, frowning.
“Something bad would happen,” Draco whispers in the dark, a worried glint in his eyes.
“Which one is yours?” he asks Draco, who hums inquisitively in reply. “Your constellation. Where is it?”
for her help with this fic.
“Yes,” Draco replies, stopping his ministrations to grab Harry’s hand and place it on his own hardening cock. “Maybe you were simply not sexually compatible. Or maybe you only fancy men, and you never realised. Let’s face it...you had more important things on your mind.”
Harry groans and they all start laughing again.
“I miss you, too,” Draco murmurs against his lips, tugging gently at Harry’s hair to tilt his head so that he can deepen the kiss, moaning into his mouth. “I want to touch you. Want your hands all over me.”
Draco listens, keeping the water warm for him, washing his body slowly, his fingers never leaving Harry’s skin.
Harry brings him closer and they end up collapsing on the bed, Harry tickling Draco’s side and making him giggle.
“Sorry, I was getting dressed,” he explains, cool and collected. Zabini raises an eyebrow and looks around the room, clearly expecting to see someone.
, please?”
Hozier, “Almost”
“This?” Draco asks.
“Mine,” Draco blurts out, “but I’ll need to fire-call Theo first.”
Draco moves again, shaking his head as he resumes his scribbling. Harry feels so exhausted, lost and dead inside.
Draco nods without a word, squeezing Harry’s hand before he goes up the stairs.
“Now, you are upsetting my patient,” the midwife says, looking annoyed and stern. “Can I please ask you to step aside or leave for a few minutes, whilst I perform some calming charms?”
All the other students wince at the mention of Voldemort’s name, but Harry stands up, worried sick about Draco’s nightmares coming true and his home being destroyed.
He leaves the Manor with a heavy heart. He realises that after spending so many months in this house he despises, or what remains of it, festering in the wake of the Dark Lord's putrid magic, he will actually miss it.
He wonders if he’s capable of loving someone, since no one has ever loved him before. He knows Ron and Hermione do, but not in that kind of way.
“I found her near the Great Hall surrounded by a group of sixth year students,” Draco says. “I tried to get them away from her, but they just kept on throwing hexes at me. Mrs Norris came by, and they finally left because they thought Filch was on his way.”
The man goes back inside and Draco’s hand appears from under the cloak, his wand clutched between pale fingers.
He just wants Draco.
Harry laughs and crosses out his message, then Malfoy’s sentence disappears. He writes again.
They stare at each other for a few never-ending moments.
“I’m just popping to the loo,” Draco says, then Harry’s hand finds his. A squeeze, warm fingers sliding along his wrist. Draco goes to the bathroom, but then comes back to Harry’s bed.
“Master Harry needs to calm down or his stomach will start hurting again.”
“Her house arrest finishes in the new year,” Harry reminds him. “I’ll convince McGonagall to let her visit you. You’ll be able to see her soon, I promise.”
“It’s just…” Hermione says, then she clears her voice, “I’m at Hogwarts and he’s at home and we never get to spend time alone together. And we don’t have a chance to…you know…but I’d like to.”
Dead.
It takes a couple of days for the interview to be published, and Harry doesn’t let anyone read it before it comes out. He only asks Draco if he wants to check it, but his boyfriend shakes his head and says that he will read it in
Harry wonders if Draco is his boyfriend or not.
“I can’t,” he said, “I…Last year…”
Harry feels peckish in spite of the anxiety, so he accepts the plate of sandwiches and starts munching on one.
“Oh, that’s great.”
“Spoilsport,” Parkinson mutters, winking at Draco.
When they get back to the common room, everyone seems to be asleep. They tiptoe to Draco’s dorm under the cloak, trying to make as little noise as they can, only to find out that Zabini isn’t there.
“What the fuck, Potter?! Are you going to murder me in your sleep?”
Draco looks uncertain, an unreadable expression painted on his face. Harry takes him upstairs, leaving him outside of the room the elf picked.
Harry scoffs, casting a warming charm on the towel and lowering the blanket so that he can clean Draco’s skin.
Draco’s eyes widen, and his hand stills. He looks at Harry with a bewildered expression on his face.
And then it’s Christmas Eve and Harry’s book tells him that his baby is the size of a guinea pig. He tries to remember how big that is while he busies himself preparing a roast. Narcissa is coming for dinner and Harry wants to impress her.
“What?” Granger asks, then she sends her
“We should go on holiday more often,” Harry mutters when they’re lying in a tangle of limbs, trying to catch their breath. Draco chuckles and pulls him closer, laying a kiss on Harry’s forehead.
“Fuck, Harry…” Draco replies, his fingers trembling in Harry’s hair, tugging at his curls for the briefest moment. Harry lets out a little moan and opens his eyes. “Are you sure?”
Harry gives up, handing her the parchment and quill with a heavy heart, but he goes to the Great Hall for lunch instead of heading for the Hospital Wing. He has no intention of spending the day sleeping, not when he has to find a way to speak to Draco.
“Enough time for me to fuck you raw against the kitchen counter. Come on, darling,” Draco says, and Harry gets rid of his clothes with a flick of his wand.
Harry considers just wolfing down his lunch and leaving when Hermione grabs his wrist.
“Why not?” Harry wonders out loud.
“Who’s Kr—” Draco starts, but Potter has already apparated with a loud crack.
“What?” Harry asks when they are just a few inches apart. Malfoy’s taller than him and Harry has to tilt his head up to look him in the eyes. Malfoy smells amazing from this close, like citrus and something flowery, but still masculine. Harry’s mouth starts watering, and he wants, he craves, so much.
Heat crawled up Harry’s cheeks and licked dangerously at his nose, while chunks of the ice cliff kept collapsing from above, threatening them with an impromptu burial. Prickly bits of ice kept shooting everywhere, disturbing their visions. At some point, Harry swore he could smell the carbonised scent of animal hair—he sincerely wished it wasn’t
“Of course I had to cast an
The Graphorn-taming instigator turned out to be a young female Troll, harrumphing and limping about the clearing. On her flanks were a nasty collection of deep gashes that were clearly caused by the horns of an annoyed Graphorn. Draco made his way towards her, but had to stop when she snarled and waved her bat at him menacingly.
Whichever creature his visitor happens to be, they will be one existing under total isolation. Draco doesn't need a spectrogram to understand loneliness, and already, he observes how those frequencies land outside the hearing range of most marine animals—the sentient ones, at least.
whose health condition didn’t allow it to begin with, and that—
Draco was lowering his guard as he slinked through the forested labyrinth, having not spotted even a Grindylow five minutes or so in. He could not help but feel at ease. The muteness down here calmed Draco greatly, muffling his anxiety with the blanketing coolness, which was mellow, like air but more soothing.
For a frantic moment, Draco’s heart became too bloated to even continue thumping—it remained foolishly where it had been, stuck and gormless, just as his entire body was. Draco couldn’t move an inch as the water became hard ice, encasing his body. Draco couldn't breathe … remembered, again, that he had used up all his oxygen. Blinking, he saw that the hand was close to wrapping around his neck now … the pearly grey figure came near … a ghost … a ghost of his own.
—He breathed in deep, feeling adrenaline numbing his face gradually. It left a tingling film upon the surface of his skin—
"What—oh," Draco takes off the Visiblear, hands it over, "my Visiblear. It helps me find my way, especially underwater. I’ve been experimenting a bit, and your voice has by far the highest affinity with my core.”
“What?” Harry blurts out; he really should Apparate away before he—
“Oh, no!” Draco waved his hands at them dramatically. Intoned, “Don’t let us disturb your lovely tête-à-tête, ladies.”
"Your magic core,” Harry repeats, “resonating at my frequencies."
But Draco’s tail twitched. Harry felt the vertebrae twisting slightly; a sweet little roll against the base of Harry’s spine. Bone to bone.
“So you’re trained to be productive as well, I take it?”
Malfoy was saying with an insouciant drawl, “Why not give him some time to recollect.” He flipped through his note pad with a flourish. “Harry can be quite thick, really.”
"That’s great? I’m positive I'll be needing more of that."
At last, Draco was done yelling, finding it rather futile, and he packed the pots of honey into his case. Draco was incredibly ready to leave, but Harry, who had been awfully quiet during the whole thing, was sporting a funny look on his face.
“You heard the Centaur.” Harry insisted, panting, right at Draco’s heels. “I don’t think it’s a good idea at all. Someone just delivered an ominous prophecy to us, and now you’re suddenly feeling the pull of some unseen forces—Draco, doesn’t that bother you at all? We should at least slow down. Make a plan or something. I don’t think there could be anything positive about fogs. Or a fog metaphor. We really should just head back. I'm not—”
It was two days after Malfoy’s ward failure incident, and they suspected Malfoy to have ties with the attacker. “If he really is a Shapeshifter,” they said solemnly, “you’re better off getting rid of him as early as possible.”
“Yes, okay. Newsflash: woe is you, and we wizards are the children of sin. But what are you—what are you doing, Harry? Surely you aren’t barreling along the mountains just to make a show of being angry. What, were you running a campaign to advocate for dragon rights while you were gone? You could’ve said so earlier if that were the case. I might laugh at you relentlessly, as I do, but you never know; I might decide to be supportive, too.”
“And you?” There was a sad hint of knowing in the Shaman’s eyes.
Harry flattened himself against Draco’s pale ridge—a bit too narrow to withstand the violent shove of the gale—and felt the sheer, hard force of Draco’s back humping up with every single beat. Felt the fury in those sweeping, scintillating wings that tamed the turbulence beneath.
like that? Like you did to your fucking Firebolt in the tournament?”
He extended a hand towards Harry, who hesitated to take it. The happenings before him painfully reminded him of Riddle’s diary; but this wasn’t a Horcrux, Harry told himself. This was simply a harmless sliver of Draco’s past, like a ghost pursuing its futile rounds, or a portrait, emulating the living.
Harry didn’t know if he could detect at least a barb or two in there. He didn’t care. Draco …
As they went deeper, Harry began to doubt if this garden was the same place as it had been this morning. It took a while before he realised that the usual cicada calls and bird songs were absent, but the course of the stepping stones obviously ran in a way Harry did not recognise; the thicket of rose bushes he used as a landmark seemed to have multiplied, while the low-growing herbs were nowhere in sight.
“I won’t, I promise,” said Harry, finally catching on. “I’ll take you home.”
“But the deal was that
Maybe they could break the cycle. Maybe they were walking into yet another recurring nightmare, at the cruel whims of the Gods, unawares. Draco didn’t know, but Harry was right here and nothing else seemed to matter as much.
Draco started to pace, unlocking himself from the stiffness in his joints. Harry followed his movement with the corner of his vision.
“I hear you too,” at some point, Harry tells him, easy as though riding the current, so effortless, as they’ve found each other again and again—with bodies that are not perfect, over the years, across an ocean. An ocean that is merciful, Draco concludes, Harry being a case in point.
“You won’t. You’re a fucking saint.”
“Dragons are very stubborn creatures, aren’t they?” The Shaman gave a humourless laugh, and started to wrap the cloth around the heart again. One corner over the right atrium, then another over the left ventricle; the jagged scar shone, lone and white in the middle. “Death is only a door to a new body, a new life, if you believe in reincarnation, and as we’ve discussed and agreed on during our first session, Draco, it is true that our beliefs shape our reality.”
He looks rather lively for someone who should be taken over by jet lag, and Harry knows he must’ve just gotten off the International Portkey because he’s wearing one of Harry’s Quidditch jerseys, which he reserves only for long distance travel and, occasionally, when he runs out of clean pajamas.
that.”
“But selfish? I don’t think that’s even in your moral lexicon.”
But the quadrennial dragon race was just round the corner, and from what Harry had gathered, the race registration was already filled with quite a few big names in dragon riding—as it should, because the deadline was near. Charlie was the only Solomonar in their Sanctuary who hadn’t put down his name, and was therefore getting at least ten owls a day from the board members, from his mentor, from the race director herself, all of them writing with an earnest determination not unlike Mrs Weasley when she tried to set him up with Harry.
“Two of which are named after us, mind you.”
physical business,” Draco says, but becomes too impatient to keep his word. He nurses their closeness into a kiss,
They flew back to the campsite after that—as Solomonar and his dragon. Mostly, Harry missed Charlie and Yulia, a sentiment Draco secretly shared. And there were more things to be done: Harry had to swagger up to the board members and inform them of his decision to attend the final leg of the race as Charlie’s substitute. Harry had to tell them that—
Then Draco sprinted.
doing something brave and good for once. It was a sweet dream so glorious that its lights flooded his reality, his fear, which seemed ridiculously trivial in comparison.
He makes it to the tidy little porch, only to trip over a darting, silver ball of fur, before crash-landing face-first into a platter of canned tuna.
The wild scent of Sugar Shrub, damp roots and horses were brought over in gusts. With his five senses heightened, Harry’s memories documented even the slightest details. They were far above the ground, but Harry’s peripheral vision somehow registered a shiny teal-coloured beetle, scuttling noisily on its many feet after falling off from a round cluster of tiny white flowers. And over there on an apple tree, the Ripening Charms smelled like nettles.
“It'll be weird, but try not to panic,” he tells Buckbeak, fishing for the Time-Turner behind his collar. “I’ll cut you loose—the other you, I mean, so he can distract Macnair, and as soon as the sky is clear, grab Malfoy and go. Lie low at Shell Cottage afterwards. We'll be right there with you.”
“Didn’t know you smoked.” Malfoy eyed Harry as he stepped around the tree, then up into an alcove in the fuselage of their Station.
It felt like coming home; Harry knew it wasn’t, but he no longer knew why. Last night, Draco had insisted that he’d encountered what was once part of him—that he
“You’re being awfully suspicious.” Draco narrowed his eyes, but he continued to chop them up into fine, even snips. “No one can identify all the ingredients of their own Auxiliary Potion without extensive arithmetic calculations—let alone another person’s.”
A sinking feeling took over Draco’s stomach. He could already picture the rest in his mind, clear as day.
Ignoring Draco’s jibe at his tactless digressions, Harry then went on a massive long rant on the Statue of Secrecy, on how it was the poisonous kernel hidden within all this rotten flesh of speciesism, on how wizards went on taking it further to exploit magical creatures in the name of the Statute. It was a very Harry speech, Draco supposed, with a suspicious touch of Granger, and he found it fascinating even though he was rather sick of Harry beating about the bush. He sighed. Might as well go along with whatever Harry was insisting on telling him.
“Bill had nothing to do with it, obviously, but the people in the bank used her to guard several of their vaults, cuffed her in a cramped, dark space for years and tortured her since she was small. Charlie knew she was severely mistreated before he found her but didn’t know the rest until that moment. He was livid, called Bill a cold-blooded slime, a sympathiser—well that was quite harsh, really, Bill’s a decent bloke—and fought with everyone else in the family because most of them either tried to back Bill up, or tried to calm Charlie down.”
“Knock it off,” said the Shaman, smiling. She then turned towards Harry with a pointed, questioning look; Harry shook his head.
Draco remembered the jealousy scattering as quickly as it gathered, and chasing it away was a simple, ardent fondness, which he realised was close to innate. A scary reflex that had been built in his body, curling dormant all this time.
Three years, he thinks, three years doesn’t seem that long, even though the mystery surrounding their identity lurks, constantly, at the back of his mind.
“What?”
Harry hadn’t been able to give an answer, but Draco had let him stay anyway.
“Oh, finally coming full circle now, are we?” Draco splayed his hands out. A few feet away, water ran in a thin white sheet that was still choppy. Draco stopped at the damp lumpy edge of it and turned to face Harry. “Well if it’s a myth, why do the other dragons hate us? Or was it just me.”
“Where’s the eye?” Draco says, oddly enthusiastic. He leaps gracefully off from Harry’s embrace; makes to wrench the glass sliding door open. Harry leans over, swats his hand away. “Don’t. My landlord’s gonna have a fit.”
Harry shrugged sheepishly. “I know I should’ve at least sent a Patronus,” he admitted.
and his diving suit comes flapping down from a shelf.
But all this time Harry was making sure the Centaur could hold himself steady, the Centaur had been staring straight at Harry’s face. The intensity of it made Draco uneasy. He trudged over to where the Centaur slouched, and tried to tug Harry away from the bull’s eye of the Centaur’s gaze.
Harry told her the story as they ushered Draco indoors to get a Sober-Up Tincture. The Shaman had remained pensive after Harry’s recounting, and they sat down by the table in silence until Draco sauntered back. He said, still in that conspiratorial tone, “There was a most intriguing phenomenon while I was retrieving the heart.”
Harry feels a little glimmer of hope budding in his chest and he looks at Draco with a sheepish grin.
“Did anyone hurt you?” he asks, his voice sounding odd to his own ears.
"Nothing," he murmurs, because words cannot describe the way his heart is expanding and clenching in his chest at the same time, beating like a mad tambourine. "Can I kiss you?"
“You’re such a fool,” Draco whispers, but Harry can hear the affection in his voice, can feel the way Draco’s fingers tremble against his temple and then the press of his soft lips on his forehead.
“Because of her fur,” Draco explains, stroking the colourful back of the kitten as she laps at the milk. “If it’s more than two colours, then the cat is female. And she’s black, white and brown. Such a lovely little lady, you are, hm?”
Draco’s lips seal tight, a straight line that reminds Harry of all the conversations they’ve had in the past about Draco’s desires. About what he wants and what he thinks he deserves.
“Friends…” Draco murmurs, his face unreadable as he takes a step back and looks at himself in the wardrobe mirror. “Friends.”
Harry feels his cock react to that mysteriously lascivious statement.
, he would tell himself, feeling small and lonely in his tiny cupboard under the stairs.
“Let’s hear it,” Draco says, raising an eyebrow at him. “It’d better not be something like befriending Ron Weasley.”
“Deal,” he said.
"About the wedding. About us," Draco says, his voice growing stronger, steadier. "I called it off, and I told everyone that I'm in love with you."
“A heart-shaped coin you say? Interesting,” Hermione mutters, taking a very slow sip of her wine as she eyes him curiously. “What about Draco?”
“I want to go now,” Harry replies, moving an inch closer, until their knees are touching.
Draco takes him to The Hague, and Harry misses the countryside instantly, but then they visit the city and Draco takes him to a small restaurant that serves the most delicious fish. They’re tired and full by the time they stumble back to their rented flat, but Harry takes his time undressing Draco, removing his Muggle clothes with care, relishing the way Draco’s cheeks flush pink when Harry drops to his knees and takes him into his mouth, suckling on the tip of his cock before swallowing him whole. He teases him with kitty licks and gentle kisses on the shaft, making Draco groan in frustration, but then Harry lets Draco’s cock slide deep inside his mouth, hitting the back of his throat.
“It will happen,” Harry says slowly, thinking about how good it feels to be intimate with Draco, to feel him close and let go of everything together.
Malfoy Manor.
Are they even together?
“I can’t believe you’re letting me hold it,” Draco murmurs.
“I’ve been on suppressants since I was a toddler,” Draco explains and Harry hears him moving, the rustling of fabric a few feet away from him, “I can’t even remember ever looking any different from my usual self. It’s just terrifying and I have no idea how to control the allure. The other day a wizard came to deliver some food and Mother had to hex him and then obliviate him, because he tried to get his hands on me.”
And surprisingly, it does.
He has sucked Draco’s cock.
There’s silence, punctuated only by the sound of their breathing, and then Draco moves away, handing Harry his clothes and getting dressed.
And bloody hell, it was glorious. Draco was starving and stuffed his face, piling up his plate with seconds. Potter was barely hiding his surprise and looked at him with a smug expression on his face.
Draco’s grey eyes open wide in disbelief.
The cupboard is so dark. Darker than the one from his childhood.
“Shall I st—”
“Hey,” Harry says, wondering what to do or what to say to console the blond. They’re not friends. They’re not even lovers. What the fuck are they?
“Oh,” is Draco’s only comment, but there’s a smile tugging the corner of his lips and his fingers squeeze Harry’s as they walk back to the castle. “If we’re trying to be honest, I have to confess that you don’t actually need any practice. The way you kiss should be illegal.”
“I’ll tell you what’s going to happen tomorrow morning,” Draco says, his voice like a pulled cord, ready to snap. “Auror Hopkins will get here with his colleagues. They will check if my trunk contains the Ministry approved things, which, by the way, are my school equipment, four sets of robes and my pyjamas. Nothing else. And if I try to sneak in anything else, they will find an adequate punishment for my boldness.”
“Shit, Draco,” Harry groans, casting an
Harry helps Draco undress, slowly, feeling the expanse of his wings, the long feathers at the extremities and the soft little ones in the spot where they connect to his back. Draco shudders as Harry’s fingers come in contact with warm skin, tracing lazy patterns on it.
“Cats. Besides, are cults even legal?”
“What?” Draco snapped. “What are you doing here, anyway? Following me around like a lost Crup. Aren’t there enough mice to catch in the dragon stables?”
“That wasn’t planned. None of what happened was. This afternoon I checked in at the hostel two stories below your flat, and the plan was to waylay you as soon as you make your way back from the Apparition point, but I got bored waiting, so I thought I could kill some time impersonating an utter tourist.”
Slowly, fog descended: through the troops of juniper trees along the mountain slopes, down into the low area in the basin. Harry waited as the chilly tendrils crept and climbed, leaving mists of condensation along his skin, making his hair stand. It was a reptilian sensation, and Harry could not suppress the panic that rose within him, as dense as the thick white air around. It drove him to take action.
Draco ignores him; speaks into the empty air, “And now’s the time I answer, ‘Who’s there?’ Before you debate between admitting, ‘An idiot stalker,’ or lying, in which case,” he jiggles his Walkman emphatically, “I don’t know … a smooth criminal?”
“And now you can kiss me.”
“Harry fucking Potter,” Draco accuses. “It’s! Oh, it’s … it
“Guess you’re not like other saviours, then,” Draco says, smirking. “And don’t forget, in Britain, bureaucracy
They can watch the telly, Harry knows, and huddle over the glitch-troubled screen. Draco will trace the strangely fascinating aperture from the sea, to the shore, then across the tiny strip of land to where they are, in one another’s arms. But Harry doesn’t reach out for the remote, keeping to themselves the grumpy winds, the moon-bleached rain, the typhoon night, and the billowy curtains of light misting in from the streets. He wants to keep Draco to himself, too, if only for a minute longer.
for the prompt: pumpkin
From the soft shuffling, Draco has no idea whether Harry’s moving away from him, or just propping himself up on his elbows. Oh god, oh
“Very well then. The larger magical organisms were unable to all go into hiding at once, because after the Statue took place, wizards had taken up most of the Muggle-free lands. Trolls, Giants and dragons were the ones who rebelled against it, and that was roughly when the governments started encouraging trophy hunting with them as the game.”
Betty came strolling, and she nudged Harry out of his ruminations. Woodenly, Harry lowered the heart into the stone well with a bucket and its pulley. It plonked into the dark smooth water, then submerged completely so that the thin rope was the only part visible above-water.
He told Harry so. Harry would understand, he thought, being one to nose around a lot at Hogwarts himself.
Before Harry could munch on the fruit, or further index and file away Draco's loveliness, Charlie’s Patronus—a burly buffalo—galumphed its way through the apple grove. Harry’s heart sped up.
Harry shouted,
Her flying was measured, controlled, like she knew exactly the pace it would take for her to win. There was a bored expression on Reni’s delicate face as she sped forward on her Ridgeback. “Who the hell are you?” she snapped at Harry.
Harry's fingers fumbled down to check his pulse, and felt nothing. Not at the side of his neck. Not at his wrists. But then from those pulse points, Malfoy’s magic was bursting forth like a high pressure hose nozzle, smiting Harry’s fingers with the force of it. It was painful; Harry wanted to check if his own hands were bruised, if Malfoy’s magic had carved itself through the whorls under his fingers and the lines on his palms. But he couldn’t move them an inch away. He thought of Malfoy’s wording: undiluted.
The ripple multiplied, spacing out, then, breaching the water was Draco, coughing water. The Protection Charms he’d slathered himself with were all dead, liquid and runny, and they slid down from his body, mingling with lake water. Still dragging him along the surface of the lake was Harry’s spell. Draco tripped on water multiple times, and dripping wet he fell into Harry’s arms. Draco’s magic was still curling snugly around Harry, but there was no time for him to appreciate that. Someone with a familiar voice was shouting in the distance.
“They … turn into ghosts, and watch over their loved ones for the rest of their lives,” Harry answered; he found speaking rather painful with a drought closing in on his throat.
Draco ignored him anyway, pawing the grassy earth underfoot. Focused, instead, on the ghost of a yellow flower over there, dancing. Listened to the anarchic reticence of the mountains nearby.
Sometimes, beforehand, Harry would make fancy plans for dinner, for shopping at Ginza afterwards, even when he knew none of them would turn out as useful as the 100 yen coins in his pocket, because Draco’s hotel suite was where they’d end up till tomorrow morning, doing round after round of you-know-what, with only hot cups of instant ramen, vending machine cigarettes and cold beer marking the in-betweens.
Evidently, Harry wasn’t there to protect Draco’s heart from being stolen, and he wondered why. Slowly, he unravelled the knot that held up the wrapping. The pearly scar snarled at Harry like a crooked mouth—had it taken the death blow, right there? Or was it where the poachers had cut through with their daggers to pluck out some of the heartstrings?
“Fuck it,” Harry swears under his breath, weirdly flustered. “Guess I should go find Robards. See you at Pride.”
“My soul is a grave where I wander and dwell eternally.” Harry turned the syllables on the tip of his tongue. Curious. He then tried it again mentally, in Malfoy’s accent. “Why’s that your mantra when you meditate?”
“I need to collect honey tithes from the Mountain Trolls, obviously. I’m the tithingman of this mountain now.” Draco did a dramatic twirl to Disapparate; he wanted to get rid of Harry, whose reflexes were unfortunately too quick for that. He caught onto Draco’s elbows, and together they landed wobbly onto a grassy slope.
“Wormwood.”
“Of course I’m coming,” Malfoy snapped when Harry asked him why he was following him all the way out of their Station. “It could be a defining moment in my Animagus training. Shamans are gifted Seers, and I really need to make sure I’m on the right track—”
Delayed and weakened by his Warming Charm, the perpetual coldness of the lake merely registered as a mild caress. “Draco,” Harry yelled at him. His voice, despite the strain of the volume, came out uncharacteristically shaky. “I can’t stop you now, but I’m here. I want you to know—I’ll be here waiting.”
Under Malfoy’s arm, he was carrying his meditation cushion, which he’d Shrunken into a pillow-size block. As he drew closer, Harry noticed that his chest was heaving. Harry checked his watch. It was seven in the morning.
“Better?” Harry was saying, because Draco had been spitting fire at him for the past five minutes. Draco supposed he had been throwing a tantrum because he didn’t want Harry to speak to him as though he were a fucking horse. That placating, condescending tone. Draco had made sure that his displeasure was not lost in translation, and had told Harry to fuck off through their bond.
“No.” Madam Cholpon cut his rambling off with a wry smile. “It’s not because of financial problems.”
“I know,” Harry said, picking at a splinter of wood on the side of the table. “Thanks.”
A Merman’s song—mutated, divine.
The Shaman’s eyes were a colder shade of brown than he last saw them. “Young Solomonar,” she said, her English carrying a tough, flinty quality to it. “You seemed to have found your dragon just fine, haven’t you?”
strong enough to withhold a tsunami, and a heartbreak, probably; he releases it into the wind, lets his magic find Draco, touch Draco where he can’t: Draco’s skin, Draco’s hair, the sharp peaks and valleys marking the back of Draco’s hand.
Having geared up, he drops his weight into the moon pool. The water used to be a heavy blanket that muffles his worries, but today, the ambient noise has risen up to a cacophony. It's one thing to monitor noise pollution through statistics, and a whole different thing to witness it first-hand. Though slightly compromised, Draco’s Visiblear does its work fine, showing him a way through the low light, to the song.
If Ron were here, he'd probably be able to draw analogies between dragons and witches. He'd probably whisk out a copy of
Malfoy whimpered, dropping his head to Harry’s shoulder. The soft hair at the nape of his neck was coalescing, too, like pale streams into a shiny river. Dragon spikes. Harry stroked them, and felt Malfoy shiver.
“This is not me diverting my ennui towards you on the spur of the moment,” Draco said quietly. Drawing her brows together, Madam Cholpon said nothing. Contrary to what Draco had imagined, she wasn’t at least a little bit moved when Draco proposed becoming her apprentice. “This is something I’ve been thinking about for a while. You told me I’m good at what you do, and that you can’t find an apprentice. I thought this was perhaps what you were trying to tell me …. I thought we were on the same page.”
Draco’s eyes widened even more. He crawled over the thin strip of grass between them, hovering beside Harry. Then, even though there was absolutely no reason to, he whispered into Harry’s ear, “Yes, you did that, didn’t you?”
“Neither do I.” Avoiding Draco’s searching gaze, Harry stepped away from the workbench. Draco could hear him biting his nails. Pacing. Then biting his nails again.
They still haven’t switched on the light. Outdoors, the lamp posts are artificial moons that smear the slanting rain into blurs of silver. The alleys have trapped the gusts of wind within the twists and turns, where they knock about like beasts—growl they sometimes do, when their muzzles fail to bang open the rattling windows. Then they’ll howl in turn, trying to terrorise the sleepy shops by threatening to tear their signboards down.
“Thanks very much,
“Not with a Pensieve,” Harry said hoarsely. He thought of the way Draco’s magic turned the leaves yellow, the way Draco was afraid to let autumn drowse into winter, because he didn’t believe that spring would come again. But Harry knew they would pay a visit to Madam Cholpon and Betty the Bicorn after they took their Portkey back to Lake Issyk-Kul. Harry would hug Draco through winter, walk him through spring, and kiss him through summer—then through the four seasons again. “I can show you. In other ways.”
There was no clear border between night, land and lake in sight. Tiny flecks of white glowed distantly about. Draco was shivering under the feeble illumination slanting down from the cold moon. After Harry double-checked that they weren’t followed, he dropped their tightly clasped hands; Draco Spelled himself dry.
