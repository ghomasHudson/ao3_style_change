Harry had pushed the boy’s legs even farther apart, biting back a groan when he saw his hole for the first time.
He made a beeline to his father’s guest room and went in, sitting on the bed as he tried to get a handle on his emotions.
He would make it through this for his jellybean. If his mother had fought to keep him alive in the womb without his father and survived, Draco would fight for his pup and escape Harry.
Harry released Draco’s leg and dropped down, placing the hand that had been holding up his leg next to the boy’s head, his other hand still clutching the back of the sofa. One of his knees was still beside Draco’s hip on the sofa, his other foot on the floor, his leg bent slightly and supporting his weight.
Draco abruptly turned, not wanting to be under that intense emerald gaze anymore. He scooped his daughter out of her high chair and settled her on his hip.
Harry slid his hands under Draco’s armpits, lifting him. He turned and sat on the bed, placing Draco face forward on his lap.
Harry’s rabbit was a wreck beneath his tongue, pressing his hips down as Harry tongue-fucked his hole. His long saliva-damp ears were listless on the bed above his head, the fur of his scut tickling Harry’s jaw as he licked.
Harry stood and walked over to their side of the table, holding his arms out. “Please, Draco. I don’t mind at all.”
Draco sighed and hefted his bag onto his shoulder. “It’s better this way, Mr. Potter. Last night shouldn’t have happened and I don’t want to be responsible for getting in between your relationship.”
Sometimes, he wished he’d never been born into the world of magic. Maybe it would have saved him from some of the pain he held close to his heart.
Harry walked over to him, stopping just in front of him. “And if I hadn’t come to you, that day in the garden, you would have gone on with your life without telling me about my son. You would have gone on without
Without another word, Harry pivoted on heel and disappeared into the Floo. Draco watched as the emerald flames enveloped him, sealing his mother’s fate with an extinguishing snap that seemed to reverberate throughout his
“Just looking at the embryo’s vitals. Nothing to be overly concerned about, but the fetal heart rate is a bit slow.”
Harry slowly knelt, putting himself at eye-level with Draco on the sofa. He smiled and brushed his knuckles against Draco’s cheek in a fleeting caress.
Arlen glanced up at Harry, giving him an indulgent smile. “I know it sounds concerning, Mr. Potter, but I assure you we’ll continue to monitor it closely.” Arlen pulled his wand away and murmured a cleaning charm, the gel and image of Draco’s jellybean disappearing.
It was the first hug he’d received since parting from his mother. She smelled like sunshine and citrus. It felt wonderful.
Draco raised both of his trembling hands in front of him and barely quelled a yelp when the man grabbed them and turned them both over with his own large hands. His skin was a startling white against the man’s tanned hands, a contrast that made Draco unable to look away.
Draco stared dazedly up at the ceiling as Harry mouthed at his neck. The plea was on the tip of his tongue, but he was able to tamp it down.
In a fucked-up way, it helped. Harry was his mate, and the sudden projection of his familiar pheromones calmed his anxiety, the tension slowly disappearing from his shoulders.
Along with the moors’ dreary atmosphere, the manor itself seemed to be barren of anything that held any semblance of joy. There were no family portraits, only haunting tapestries that depicted scenes of brutal hunts or the grey moors itself.
“That’s not true!” Draco cried out, flinching when Scorpius began showing sounds of rousing due to his outburst.
Arlen stepped out, turning around to hold open the doors. “Whatever you’re going to say to him, Draco, he doesn’t deserve it. They say he’s lost his mind. Your words are wasted on the likes of him. He’s just some washed up wizard with a broken mind now. He’s a monster and he doesn’t deserve any kindness, especially from you.”
Harry arched a brow, a tendril of unease curling in his stomach. “Narcissa? What are you doing at the Ministry? Did something happen?”
He picked Draco up under his armpits and laid him back on the bed. Then, he hooked his fingers into the waistband of Draco’s bottoms and ripped them off, tossing them to the side.
Hermione let a dry bark of laughter. “You’d pick another adjective if you had to live with her.” She smiled warmly. “But she does a good job of cheering us up when we’re in foul moods.”
Harry smiled, but it was all teeth. “Are you questioning my loyalty to the Ministry, Kingsley? You and I both know that when I retired, I took an oath to protect any and all private information that I’d learned in my career as an Auror. I would never go back on my oath, of course.”
Draco smiled and carried Scorpius to the kitchen table, sitting down and placing Scorpius on his lap.
Harry’s own eyes skated back down to Draco’s stomach. “How soon do you need an alpha? For the...pup.”
When Draco just stared blankly at it with hot tears silently streaming down his cheeks, Harry kicked it forward and it slid closer to Draco.
“That’s good, Draco. Now,” Harry shifted, pulling his leaking cock from the front his trousers, “suck me off.”
Harry stood, holding his hand out across the desk for Kinglsey to shake. “Perfect. I’ll take the boy home with me tonight, then.”
Harry’s eyes widened slightly before they softened. “I love you, too, Draco. I’d hold you if I could, but I don’t think Scorp will be happy if I move him right now.”
Draco Malfoy sighed, cleaning up his daughter’s mess from breakfast. He had made her eggs and most of the meal had inevitably ended up on the floor.
Unable to help himself, he inhaled the alpha’s scent. Leather, earth, and the faint smell of whiskey. A scent he would always associate with the man before him.
Draco lowered his head, tentatively daubing his tongue against Harry’s erection. The salty tang of his pre-cum had him lapping at the bulbous head, moaning softly.
He had always been innocent, he had never hurt anyone, he didn’t feel hatred like Harry did and he felt—
A normal predator’s reaction to such submission from their prey, would be breaking the rabbit’s neck and devouring it.
He slammed Draco down against the table, his vision briefly blackening around the edges when his skull made harsh impact with the hard surface.
Like some sort of spell had been broken, Harry’s features hardened, making the scarred skin over the right side of his face grow taut.
Ron was silent for several moments. “A flare of underage magic was made known to the French Ministry of Magic. They traced it to the source and found Narcissa. Someone there recognized her and alerted us. They allowed us to bring her back to London to be persecuted for her crimes.”
Harry lowered his hand, pressing two fingers against Draco’s seeping hole. He let out a low whine, clenching and unclenching against Harry’s calloused fingertips. The tips of his fingers breached him, his slickened hole seeming to suck the digits in.
Harry remained silent, still not meeting his seeking gaze. His hands were now clenched into fists at his own sides, a muscle ticcing in his jaw.
“Say it. Say it and I’ll make you come, pet,” Harry ordered, sweat-dampened strands of his dark hair sticking to the sides of his handsome face.
“Tell me the truth, or I won’t come to help you through your nightmares anymore. I’ll leave you to scream and beg for me at night. I’ll let you sleep alone at night after I fuck you. It doesn’t bother me in the slightest, Draco.”
The papers Harry held had been in a folder on the kitchen counter. The papers were the profiles for potential alphas who could assist him during his pregnancy. If chosen, the alpha would essentially be loaning his pheromones and magic to Draco to help his pregnancy progress normally.
,” he barreled on, ignoring Draco gaping at him. “I have a job to do, and I intend to see it through. That means you’re under
Alpha dominance. With raven hair, olive skin, and a muscular form, he was what every Omega would yearn for in a mate.
“Oh? Perhaps you want another part of me instead. I remember that you were quite fond of a certain appendage of mine, for days actually.”
Draco grasped his erection and began slowly sliding his hand up and down, smearing his pre-cum along his shaft. He closed his eyes and tried to focus on alleviating his tension.
He took out his wand and aimed it at himself, letting the tip hover over his throat and then down to his feet, casting a scent erasing spell. Hopefully the keen witch wouldn’t be able to smell any traces of Draco’s distress upon him.
Harry’s body was always ready for Draco, spurred on by his scent and needy, pleading whimpers that seemed to resound throughout the entire house and Harry’s chaotic mind.
Draco reached up with shaky hands and placed them on Harry’s solid chest, meaning to push him away. “It’s not a date, you idiot. It’s an interview. I need his pheromones; he’ll take me home—”
It was a program that had been created in London to help pregnant omegas that were without their alpha, no matter the circumstance.
with us and I couldn’t bring myself to tell you the truth. I admit that I was wrong, and I should have been honest with you from the beginning, but—”
Like a festering wound that continued to pulsate within him, the resentment and anger made the edges of the wound throb, begging to fed.
Potter raised his free gloved hand and placed a straightened finger to his lips in a universal sign for silence.
He sat in Harry’s kitchen, at his table. He held Scorpius in his arms, alternating between trying to keep his pup entertained and trying not to stare at Harry as he prepared dinner for them both.
Draco had never seen his mother so frazzled. She was usually kempt and refined, but her white-blonde hair was in disarray, tendrils of it hanging loose from her chignon and dangling limply around her wan face.
After much trepidation, he had first tested his metaphorical leash by exploring the floor his bedroom was on.
Draco gave Hermione an apologetic smile. “I’m sorry about the way I’m acting, Hermione. It really is just hormones. I cry about everything these days.”
Harry returned his smile, the Alpha in him purring with pleasure. “I don’t mind at all and Scorpius is free to make as much of a mess as he wants. It won’t bother me in the slightest, Draco.”
break down and beg for Harry to touch him. If he did that…he considered it to be losing the final piece of himself that he was trying so desperately to hold onto.
Harry was trying to force him to be his mate, force him to carry his child. It was all so fucked, and Draco let out strangled sob, his eyes filling with unshed tears.
He closed the rabbit’s cage door and left, wondering what he had exactly gotten himself into by obtaining ownership of the rabbit.
“Why?!” Draco shouted, uncaring if he appeared hysterical. “Why are you shutting me out like this? I know you can
Harry smiled fondly down at Scorpius, reaching up to sift through his pup's downy hair with his fingers.
“Listen, there’s a festival going on at Hogsmeade next week for Christmas before Hogwarts goes on winter break. Ron and I are bringing Hugo to visit Rose and enjoy the festival. Ginny wants to go, and I think you should tag along.” She playfully nudged him with her elbow. “It could be fun. You could go outside and actually, you know, breathe
Harry had loved knowing that Lucius had rotted away in Azkaban and had found it dreadfully unfair that his bitch of a wife hadn’t suffered the same fate.
He felt sorry for the Alphas who were to be assigned an Omega so young. It would be like taking care of a child, but you had to get said child
Harry released his nipple and lowered his head, sticking out his tongue to softly lap at the swollen nub. Draco whimpered, the sensations of Harry’s tongue and his dark hair brushing against the sensitive skin of his chest overwhelming him.
Once they stepped into the drawing room from the Floo, Harry pulled Draco forward by his arm, making him stumble slightly as he righted his feet.
Potter paused at his moan and his breath hitched when he felt the older man spread his cleft with his long fingers, exposing his hole.
Draco looked up Harry, flushing under his intense gaze. He knew that Harry was upset, his anger being stoked by Draco’s alleged flirtations with Arlen.
The oils were to be taken orally at least once a week. It helped in suppressing his scent as an omega and made his heats less intense when they came each month. His heats were especially unbearable, so his mother had made the oils to lessen his misery during his estrus.
Harry was wearing a dark coat, a burgundy scarf loosely wrapped around his neck. His thick black hair was dotted with fresh snowflakes, his lambent eyes rife with...
In her living room, stood the Minister of Magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt. Her husband, Ron Weasley, stood next to him. There were two other officials from the Ministry in her living room, their gazes guarded and their expressions somber.
”I don’t belong to anyone,” Draco said softly, his lids lowering as Potter’s pheromones overtook him again in those thickening waves.
One evening, he had been licking the rabbit to calm him before bedtime and found himself spending longer than necessary licking his nipples. The rabbit only purred and chuffed happily, pressing upwards against Harry’s tongue.
Before Harry could react, the boy shoved out from underneath of him and tried to crawl away. His escape was hindered by his refusal to drop his stuffed animal and Harry was quicker, his predator instincts kicking in.
Draco laid on a medical bed at St Mungo’s in an examination room in the fertility ward. He was approaching his seventh month of pregnancy, and his jellybean was developing perfectly.
He hated that his jellybean was between them, like a witness to Harry’s abusive behavior. He wanted Harry to fuck him like they always did, facing away from each other. This position was too...
Draco swallowed thickly, his inner Omega wailing with want at the sight of his Alpha’s cock, hard and ready for him.
“When I went to the manor, I found you inside and you were in the throes of your heat. I stayed with you until morning.”
The fingers of his free hand clenched into a fist, the creak of his leather riding gloves audible over the backdrop of rain.
Harry threw the boy onto the bed and gathered both of his wrists one hand, stretching them over his head. He conjured rope and twined it through the metal bars of the headboard, tightening the knots until the rope dug into the skin of the boy’s delicate wrists.
With that, Harry waved a hand and snuffed out all light from the room. He turned and strode from the bedroom, slamming the door behind him and leaving Draco quietly sobbing in the pitch black.
Harry reached around his rabbit’s chest with both hands, pinching his pink, pebbled nipples between his clawed fingers. He slowly began rolling the small nubs between his knuckles, his cock throbbing harder with each whimper and moan the boy released.
“I spoke with Ginny the other day. She’s also worried about you, Harry. She’s tried to write you, but you haven’t written back.”
Draco laid down, spreading his trembling thighs. Slick was still leaking from his hole, the sheets beneath it covered in it. He looked up at Harry for guidance, unsure what exactly he was trying to prove by making him do this.
If they weren’t being hunted by carnivores for pure sport, they usually served the purpose of being servants for a magical carnivore household.
Draco felt a pang in his heart, all of the sudden feeling very inadequate. He hadn’t even finished school yet. He had sacrificed his final year to rest at home while pregnant. His pregnancy hadn’t been the easiest and the Healers at St Mungo’s had recommended taking the year off.
”Dada, no,” the boy said weakly, his body belying his words as slick poured from the boy’s hole. It dribbled down the back of Draco’s thighs and the front of Harry’s, making their connecting skin tacky.
He supposed he could have thrown them in the bin on the way here, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it.
Seeming like he was unable to stop himself, Harry leaned down further and pressed his nose into Draco’s hair, softly inhaling. “What’s there not to like?” he whispered, his warm breath gusting over the top of Draco’s ear and making him shiver.
was what he wanted. He wanted Harry to hold him. He wanted his Alpha to make love to him and ease the burning hurt in chest. He wanted—
Just before he had shot his load, he’d sunk his teeth into the wrist of his hand holding the thin fabric, imagining it was the pale column of Draco’s throat. When his own blood had welled, he’d eagerly lapped it up as if he were fucking starving for the taste of the boy.
”I-I’m sorry, Master Potter. I’ll be sure to keep a close eye on him from now on. It won’t happen again.”
Harry opened his eyes, letting Draco’s fingers slide out of his heated mouth, his fingers now coated in Harry’s saliva.
Draco nodded, not lifting his head from the arm of the sofa. “I’ll bring some next time,” he slurred, turning his head slightly, but keeping his eyes closed. “Thank you for putting him to bed.”
Harry didn’t really have any urgency to reproduce or find a mate. He was perfectly content with the way things were and preferred for life to be calm rather than chaotic.
He had never witnessed someone standing up to his father like that or ever had anyone defend him so fiercely.
The heavy black drapes on the tall windows were slightly parted, letting him see that it was now dark out.
Harry released his nipple, a string of saliva still connecting his mouth to the leaking tip. He leaned forward and lapped at Draco’s nipple, collecting his saliva and the excess milk on his tongue.
It was a total shock to him, and he had never been more turned on in his life by such a simple word coming from the lips of the person he wanted most.
Draco nodded, his ears flattening coyly against the back of his head. Harry pressed his mouth to his rabbit’s, reaching down to press his cock back to Draco’s opening, sinking in.
Harry stepped closer and leaned down, his chest brushing against Draco’s sensitive nipples, making him shiver.
He had assigned the Malfoy case to a capable Auror on his team, wanting to rid himself of reminders of the charming boy and his son.
Draco Malfoy’s mother, Narcissa Malfoy, forcibly shoved his arms into the sleeves of his jacket, her movements fast and jerky.
Draco sat up, rubbing at his eyes with the back of his hand. “I’m not curious about you. Not in the slightest,” he said indignantly.
He stubbed out his cigarette and stood. He was about to make coffee when Kreacher ambled into the kitchen.
Draco walked into the room and gingerly lowered himself into the armchair across from Harry, shooting him a dark look.
The smell of Draco’s cum, slick, and breast milk permeated the air around him, an intoxicating scent that had Harry tenting his trousers.
His mum’s pale brows went up. “Well, don’t keep me in suspense, darling. Tell me what’s going on.” She cast a worried glance at their pup. “Is it Scorpius?”
Hermione reached down, grabbing a small, gift-wrapped box from her bag and setting it on the table in front of him. “I hope you don’t mind. I asked Harry when it was so that I could surprise you.”
Draco warily looked up at him, his lashes wet. Tears trekked down his cheeks, a slight tremble to his parted lips.
A small nudge against his stomach from his pup reminded him of why he had wanted to sit down with Hermione. Harry had gone to the Ministry that day for some unknown reason and Hermione had stopped by to keep him company.
A furrow appeared between Draco’s pale brows. “I can make us something to eat, Harry. I’m not a child, you know.”
Draco reached up and pulled Harry’s head down with both hands, crushing his mouth to his with a low whine.
Harry stood up straight, his brows drawing together. “You’re staying with Lucius? Is Draco doing all right?”
When they came upon the shop they had agreed to meet Ron and Hermione at, Harry came to a halt. Ginny cast him a questioning glance, her hand already on the door handle.
Harry pressed a finger against Draco’s twitching hole, pressing in. It made an obscene squelching noise that had Draco’s cheeks heating even more.
”Poor thing,” Harry tsked, letting one his claws brush against one the rabbit’s long ears. “Dada will take care of you, sweetheart.”
“If you want me to beg, Draco, I will. I’ve wanted you since the first moment I laid eyes on you in your parents’ garden. If you really don’t want this, I’ll leave, and I won’t contact you again.” He lifted his hand to let his fingertips brush over his scent gland on his neck, making Draco whimper. “But if you want this, I want
“Master Potter requires all new staff to meet him before starting. He doesn’t trust people, really.”
. It’s not my fault you remained in the past, unable to see past anything except your own memories.”
One night, after they were lying in the bed in silence after having sex, Draco had scooted closer to him. He didn’t know what had possessed him in that moment, but he had just felt the overwhelming need to
When Harry was inside of him, the twinging pain would momentarily abate. Harry had fucked him on his hands and knees, his burgeoning belly making it more and more difficult for Harry to take him from the front.
She looked older. Her hair was almost fully white now and multiple age lines marked the pale skin of her face. Her eyes were still narrowed in that infuriatingly imperious way that Harry remembered from his youth.
Harry leaned over and nuzzled against the shell of Draco’s ear, making him shiver. “Say it again,” he murmured softly.
He knew he had to have an Alpha around the farther along he became in pregnancy, but it felt like a betrayal to Theo.
Even though he was still healing from his time spent in captivity, his daughter had healed the parts of him that he thought would never mend. He had thought wrong all those years ago.
A mate meant emotions and emotions were terribly messy. Watching Ron act barbaric over Hermione during her pregnancy had put him off to the whole idea entirely.
The sight of Draco’s small, pink hole had made Harry’s cock swiftly fill with blood, naturally reacting and readying to plunge into the Omega’s tight heat.
Draco shook his head, his tears falling endlessly now. “It’s not that, Harry. You don’t understand. Your life is so…
Harry lowered his hand from his cheek and grabbed Draco’s hand, pulling it up to press it against his own stubbled cheek. “It doesn’t have to be hard, sweetheart. You can touch
His room was small and bare, containing nothing more than a bed, dresser, and small porcelain wash basin. There was a lone window above his twin bed that overlooked the moors at the back of the manor, but beyond that, nothing but grey.
Draco’s lips parted in surprise, his cheeks suffusing with heat. “Where did you get that? That was supposed to be private, Potter!”
Harry hooked one of his finger’s into the boy’s cleft, his claw meeting what could only be the boy’s leaked slick.
Draco cupped his belly with his free hand and gave a curt nod. “I-I’m going to let him take me home, Roland. Thank you for a lovely evening, but I’m tired.”
That blasted Witch Weekly had just recently printed an entire article dedicated to Harry’s seemingly perpetual bachelor status since breaking it off with Ginny. He had become so infuriated, so excruciatingly
and Draco felt rejection, the Omega inside of him wanting to prostrate himself at Harry’s feet and beg for affection.
for Harry. Harry had left his brand upon him, an indelible mark on his neck that he couldn’t seem to ignore. Harry was now his
“So that leaves only two viable possibilities: you’re lying to me about who you really are, or you’re lying about what profession you held before this one.”
Apparently when their house had been swarmed by the French Ministry, Draco had fought tooth and nail to protect his mother.
Even though the smell of rain and the stables surrounded them, Draco could scent that Theo was an alpha.
Harry surprised him by cupping his cheek with his free hand, leaning down until they were eye-level.
Harry chuckled. “I’m afraid we made a mess making the pancakes. I lost my shirt and Scorpius lost his clothes to flyaway batter.”
Harry stood on his side of the bed, glaring down at him, his chest rising and falling with harsh breaths. “You can’t hide from me, pet. I can
Harry relinquished Draco’s prick from his mouth and stood, placing one knee on the sofa beside Draco’s hip.
But Harry’s eyes became suddenly devoid of all emotion, that indifferent mask slipping back into place.
Harry examined it closely with mock concern. “Hmm. It looks pretty severe, dove. Perhaps we should operate?”
He couldn’t mess things up even further for Harry and he wouldn’t embarrass himself by acting like some needy Omega.
“Please, Hermione,” Draco begged. “She is my mother. I want her to know that I love her and that I’m doing okay. That’s all, nothing more.”
He never revealed anything private about himself and Draco was still unsure of what exactly he wanted from him.
”What is it, pet? Would you prefer it were me? You need only ask and I’ll give it it you.” Harry fisted his cock at the root, slowly sliding his hand up and then back down.
Harry swiped his tongue against the rabbit’s wet nose, grinning when he weakly squeaked in response.
“Nonsense, Draco. It’s no trouble at all.” Harry walked over and set a smaller plate next to Draco, the food on it neatly cut up and separated.
Their mating bond was strong in the air between them, heightening their pleasure as their shared emotions flooded them both, letting Harry
Then, slowly, further awareness would trickle in. The crushing feeling of his hopeless situation and the anguish he carried in his heart for his mother and her own bleak situation.
him. He felt so desperately bereft without his Alpha’s warmth and scent. He wanted Harry to hold him, to kiss him, to
Harry sighed, running a hand through his hair. “I’m not doubting your ability as a parent, Draco. It’s okay to need a little help sometimes.”
Draco ran his knuckle over his son’s cheek, marveling at how he could have created such a perfect being.
He smiled, showcasing yellowed teeth. He wore a rather beaten looking top hat, dark, greasy tufts of hair sticking out of the sides. His slitted yellow eyes denoted his species—lizard.
—” Draco fumbled for words, stumbling backward when Harry advanced on him into the stall. His back hit the dividing wall between the stalls, the small area leaving only scant inches between them.
Theo chuckled, keeping his hands around Draco’s waist to hold him in place. “Because of her sweet demeanor.”
“Why didn’t you tell me your nipples were aching? I could have assisted,” Harry purred wickedly, snaking his hand up the hem of Draco’s jumper, rubbing his fingertips against one of his sore nipples.
He realized that they had been at each other’s throats since meeting again and he didn’t know why. They were adults now.
Draco nodded, one of his small breasts pressing against Harry’s chest, wetting his shirt. Harry felt the wet spot against his skin, seeming to burn him.
His daughter sulkily meandered over to him, wrapping her arms around his waist and burrowing her nose into his chest. Draco placed his hand on top of her head, smoothing down some of the flyaways from her dark hair.
Harry grabbed Draco’s pale hips with both hands and began pistoning his cock in and out of Draco, watching as his angry, reddened cock slid in and out of that tiny, pink hole.
Draco loathed that look. He was tired of those inscrutable expressions. He would never give his pup that face, he would always be open and honest. Even if he didn’t want to be.
Draco tried to swinging his legs over the side of the bed, but his body was still heavy with the effects of the sleeping potion. He just ended up kicking one leg off the side, exposing himself to Harry.
Draco was in desperate need of a shower, his long, sweat-dampened hair consistently falling into his eyes. He wondered if the bastard would be kind enough to give him a hair tie, but Harry would probably think he’d use it asphyxiate him somehow.
Ginny set the glass half-full of amber liquid in front of Draco on the table. He eyed the glass, already unsure about his hastily made decision to drink. Without giving it anymore thought, he picked it up and knocked it back.
He trusted her and had never been the jealous type in a relationship. Since Ginny was a Beta, they’d never be able to have children and that also didn’t bother Harry.
When Harry had seen the boy naked for the first time, his gaze had been immediately riveted between the boy’s soft, pale thighs.
Harry smirked, his eyes darkening. “I expect you to wait for me like a good little Omega.” He leaned down, pressing his lips against Draco’s ear. “And I expect you to keep those pretty pale thighs spread wide, awaiting my knot to fill that slutty little hole with my seed.”
Draco rested both of his hands palm-down on Harry’s strong thighs, trying to take him as deep as he was able to. Harry’s impressive length hit the back of his throat, making him splutter for a split second before moaning when he realized Harry was subtly rocking his hips as Draco sucked.
“Oh, you don’t have to do that, Harry. I can hold him, really. I’ve grown rather adept at multitasking since Scorpius was born,” Draco said sheepishly.
Harry gently pulled the pup’s fingers away and smiled. “It’s quite all right, Draco. I must look like a werewolf to him.”
Draco was silent for a beat before answering. “Um, his father and I…our lives wouldn’t have meshed, per say. His father is…”
Harry smiled against his jaw, his tongue flicking out to lick up the tear that had slid down Draco’s cheek. “Good.”
Draco felt shame wash over him, mixing with a heavy dose of guilt. He had just let his abusive captor fuck him and had
Just before his captor had been sentenced, he had signed over all of his assets and savings to Draco to do with as he pleased.
After his captor’s treatment of him had been publicized, the Ministry had tried to save face. Well, Kingsley, specifically. He was the one who had signed the breeding law into effect and most of the blame had been put on him.
The kiss was clumsy and wet, Draco barely opening his mouth as Harry stroked his tongue against the boy’s. Before long they stopped, Draco’s little moans and tiny wails filling the room as Harry took him.
The past month, Harry had become a constant presence in their lives. Draco would bring Scorpius to Harry’s home and let them spend time together. Harry would always make them dinner and play with Scorpius until it was time for them to leave. They still hadn’t told Draco’s parents the truth, but he knew Harry was waiting for Draco to do that himself.
The next hit was harder, his skin stinging afterward. He was mortified to realize that his prick—trapped between him and Potter’s lap—was growing hard again.
—I can’t handle you pushing me away again. I can’t handle not seeing Scorpius or being with you both. It drove me mad not being able to be with you both these past few months and I need it to be
When they parted, Harry grasped one of Draco’s small breasts. Kneading the firm swell, he lowered his head and sucked Draco’s wet, pink nipple into his mouth. He groaned from the delicious taste of his Omega’s breast milk splashing across his tongue, sending a bolt of desire straight to his cock.
Harry was silent for a moment before replying, “It doesn’t matter. Your body is all I need, not your acceptance.”
Draco gritted his teeth and turned his head, sinking his teeth into the fleshy part of his outstretched bicep. The needed pain made the heat momentarily abate and Draco whimpered with temporary relief, digging his heels into the bed.
Navigating through memories was extremely difficult. He had to get out of Narcissa’s memories and the only way to do it was—
Harry cupped the boy under his armpits and lifted him till he was resting on just his knees. His long ears perked up, twitching under Harry’s gaze.
Harry’s eyes slid shut in bliss, lapping at the boy’s skin and spreading his saliva over the gland to mark him.
from you. I want to go with Hermione. I want an Alpha who cares for me and my pup,” Draco whispered, unable to stop his tears from falling now.
“I’m sorry I don’t have anything to keep Scorpius entertained here. I don’t have many visitors his age that often,” Harry said, casting Draco an apologetic smile.
Harry hurriedly stooped, returning his lips to Draco’s with a low groan, continuing to help him remove his jacket with impatient hands. When he pulled Draco’s jumper overtop his head and threw it to the side, Draco could feel himself redden.
Harry thought they had been making progress. After telling Harry his real name, Draco had seemed to be warming up to him enough to talk more. He only said a few words, but at least he was
Harry straightened and picked up his fork. “You should eat. I can drop you both off at home before I go into work.”
Harry sighed deeply, running a hand through his hair. “Yes, I can give you something to wear. Do you really have to leave right now? There’s something I wanted to talk to you about. It’s important.”
As he watched Harry cuddle their sleeping son, he knew that Lucius could never compare to how Harry was as a father.
Some features were similar and some different. His father’s short white-blond hair was the same as his, but Lucius had an aquiline nose rather than a pert one like Draco had inherited from his mother. His eyes were the same shape and color as his father’s, but that was where the similarities ended.
It was becoming difficult to focus when he was at work, only excited for when his pup and Omega would appear at his Floo every night.
, releasing Draco’s leg and dropping down to both hands as he continued hammering into him with his cock.
Harry took Draco’s hand closest to him and raised it to his lips, pressing a quick kiss to the back of his pale skin. “I’ll eat anything you make, sweetheart. Who is watching Scorpius?”
“Mione,” Ron said softly. “There’s some things about Harry that we’ve been…unaware of over the past couple of months.”
Harry only smiled, his gaze patient. “I’m head of the Auror Department at the Ministry. When we were made aware of Malfoy Manor being broken into, I volunteered to come out and have a look myself. Your father is a bit of a celebrity himself, Draco.”
After the War, the Ministry of Magic tried to save face by trying to assure all magical-born herbivores that they were perfectly equal to their meat-eating counterparts.
to tell you. Things just happened so fast and I didn’t want to get in the way of your life. I decided when he was born that I could do it on my own, but then you came to us in the garden that day and…”
Draco pressed the back of his hand against his mouth, screwing his eyes shut as Harry rubbed his saliva against his nipple, coating the hardened bud and his areola. Harry accidentally pressed too hard, a dribble of milk spurting from Draco’s nipple and wetting his fingers with the warm fluid.
“Why haven’t you contacted me in the past few months? I know you miss me, Draco. I could smell your scent change when you were in my arms. You were
“I changed my shirt just last...” He clenched his jaw, the past few days a blur. “Was it Thursday?” he mumbled.
Potter leaned back, his eyes widening fractionally as his nostrils flared, presumedly scenting Draco’s mortifying arousal.
Draco felt a twinge of jealousy. Why couldn’t he have been given to an Alpha like Arlen? He wasn’t as handsome as Harry, but he was so
He closed his eyes and burrowed his face into the sheets, letting himself be lulled to sleep as Harry caressed his stomach, feeling his Alpha transfer some of his magic through his touch. It warmed him, seeming to reach to his very
The cobbled street was bustling with young witches and wizards and their families, creating a cacophony of excited chatter and sporadic peals of laughter as they passed storefronts and game booths.
Harry cut off his rambling by brushing past him. He walked over to them and stopped just in front of where they sat. “Hello again, Narcissa. It’s nice to see you.” His gaze slid to Lucius and gave him a curt nod. “Hello, Lucius,” he greeted, lacking any warmth at all.
Potter brought the riding crop up to his gloved hand, letting the flat leather tip slide through his fingers with an indolent air that had Draco swallowing nervously.
He lowered his head and shoved his tongue into Draco’s wet hole, licking and sucking at his stretched opening. The Alpha in him bayed with discontent, trying to heal any hurt that the dildo had caused to his Omega’s delicate, furled opening.
that much more intense. Eventually, Harry had begun sleeping in bed with him at night after they would fuck.
Draco could see it now: Harry’s respected reputation dragged through the dirt and his father looking at him with nothing but familiar disappointment…
Draco kept his eyes lowered, the large swell of his stomach preventing him from seeing his own feet. He was eight months pregnant now and only getting bigger with each passing day.
His family’s name was the gossip of London presently. Lucius Malfoy, businessman extraordinaire, reduced to a gambling heathen and his sole omega son to inherit nothing.
Draco shook his head, his prick caught between his distended belly and Harry’s hard stomach. His body was on fire, his nipples still dripping and erect. If his Alpha didn’t fuck him, he’d be miserable for the rest of the night.
Hermione let out an unsteady chuckle, a soft, insistent ringing noise within her ears. “Y-you’re wrong, Ron. You’re talking about
Harry nodded, his eyes softening. “I know. I haven’t forgotten. We can go by Floo when we get home.”
again.” Harry pinched the boy’s chin between his fingers, angling his head up to look him in the eyes. “Do you hear me, sweetheart?”
in his heart, Hermione almost couldn’t stand it. She couldn’t stand to think of her best friend letting something like that eat away at him until there was nothing left of the boy from their childhood.
He carried Draco over to a bale of hay and sat down on it. He roughly turned Draco over in his arms so that his stomach was pressed against Potter’s solid thighs.
Lucius bristled, crossing his arms over his chest. “I’ll hear it from my son, then, Potter. Draco, what is your relationship with this man?”
“It was lovely to see you, Narcissa,” Harry said curtly before reaching over and ruffling Scorpius’ hair. “I’ll see you later, kiddo.”
Harry roughly rubbed the heel of his hand against his erection, trying to get himself under control.
Scorpius had been born with hair like his, so blond it was almost white. That was where the similarities ended, however. His skin was an olive tone and his eyes a bright green color, like freshly dewed moss in the early morning.
His mother smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “We’ll see each other again, darling. You just have to be good and wait for me to retrieve you. When the time is right, I will.”
His fear of solitude and loneliness pressed in on him from all sides, his heart feeling crushed from the weight of his own hopelessness.
All Draco saw of the man was his broad-shouldered back and a gray, wiry tail hanging from the back his dark slacks before he disappeared from view.
Draco shook his head, pressing the back of his hand to his mouth. A single tear slid from the corner of his eye and fell to photo, the droplet landing on Harry’s face. It warped his image, making his features indistinguishable.
Draco hugged himself and cast a worried look at the closed door. “I didn’t think I’d have to meet him so soon.”
“Want it that badly, do you? I’ll give you what you crave, little one.” Harry used one hand to line up his cock with Draco’s hole, roughly yanking his hips lower with the other.
“Oh, I intend to, little one.” Harry paused for a moment, the silence hanging heavy in the air between them. “Kreacher tells me that you’re refusing to eat. How do you expect to carry my child if you do not nourish your own body?”
He walked to his large, ornate desk in the middle of the office and sat in the black leather chair behind it, staring at Draco from across the room.
Harry turned to face him, his eyes devoid of any kindness. “How many of his birthdays were you going to let me miss before you told me the truth?”
After a moment’s hesitation, Draco had continued tracing his features: his mouth, his lips, and his hairline. Draco had suddenly noticed a scar on his forehead, hidden beneath his raven hair. It had struck him as odd because the scar was in the exact shape of a lightning bolt.
Harry’s mouth watered, remembering the feel of the rabbit’s taut nipples beneath his tongue each night. The predator within him came surging forth, ravenous for the taste of the rabbit’s flesh against his tongue, his cock swiftly hardening beneath his trousers.
,” Draco said weakly. “He still nurses at night. I know I should stop it soon, but it makes me feel close to him and we’re not ready yet.”
His fingers bumped clumsily against the side of the glass, knocking it over. The water spilled out and onto his lap and belly.
Even though Draco continued to spread his legs for his Alpha that night, in the back of his mind, there was a niggling feeling of
Harry was still for several beats and then began to undress until he was only wearing his dark briefs.
Harry cupped the tot under his arms with both of his hands and sat the pup on his thigh. Scorpius immediately reached up and pawed at Harry’s five o’clock shadow, making him grin.
Harry stooped and pressed his lips to his forehead. He pulled back, his eyes darkening. “Stop looking at me like that while we’re in your father’s home, or I’m taking you over the nearest horizontal surface.”
this. Please just let me go, Harry. Please just let me go. I promise I won’t tell anyone,” he sucked in a shuddering breath, “I don’t want this, please.”
on the pillowcase and watched with perverse satisfaction as the fire burned away all remanants of Draco’s scent and evidence of Harry’s shame.
“Well,” Draco said, beginning to pull away from him, “you can tell Minister Shacklebolt that while I appreciate the gesture, I won’t be needing your services.”
Draco sighed and went to scoop Scorpius out of his highchair, giving up on trying to feed him for the time being.
Harry sighed. “Dada has to run some errands, sweet one. I’ll be back shortly. Try to get some sleep. I’ll bring back treats.”
Harry growled around his nipple, sucking even harder. He reached up with one hand and cupped Draco’s other small breast, gently kneading it. The pressure from Harry’s hand made him leak even more milk, the warm fluid sluicing down Harry’s fingers and the top of his palm.“H-Harry,
“Well,” Kingsley cleared his throat before continuing, “I’d like to think of it as providing a more…
“I don’t know what wiles you’re referring to,” Draco said, but it came out breathier than he intended.
Draco let out a high-pitched whine, delighting in the feel of Harry’s thick cock impaling him and filling him. Harry began pumping into him with shallow strokes, watching him with hungry eyes.
, he was also the father of his pup. Without his Alpha’s magic and scent, he knew his delivery would be difficult. He hoped he could be as strong as his mother had been when she had him, but—
The boy crawled between his legs, bumping his nose against Harry’s inner thigh, sending a bolt of pleasure straight to his cock.
Cross-breeding had happened in the past and to this day, but it was now considered explicitly taboo.
He glanced up in surprise, pulled from his morose thoughts. Roland was looking at him with detached concern, his perfect brow furrowed.
Scorpius was wearing nothing but a nappy, with what looked like pancake batter clinging to his blond hair.
handle by himself. Even though he had attempted to wank off multiple times, he could never do it to completion. He felt on edge, frustrated and angry.
Harry brushed his fingers against the rabbit’s soft fur on his head, chuckling when the rabbit let him scratch behind one of his ears with one of his short claws.
It was late, but he couldn’t sleep. His thoughts kept drifting to Draco and Scorpius, sleeping in his guest room upstairs.
Draco began clumsily pumping the dildo in and out of his hole, matching the pace of Harry’s hand pumping his own cock.
“All right, then. I suppose I should stop in and check on your father. I’ll be back later tonight. If you need me, Draco, just come by Floo.”
He barely noticed when his knitted cap slipped off of his head when Harry burrowed his fingers into his hair, tugging gently as they kissed.
“Well, I guess, as long as you don’t mind...Scorpius can make quite the mess sometimes, I’m warning you,” Draco said softly, offering him a hesitant smile.
At night, he would take a Dreamless Sleep potion, trying to escape the incessant thoughts and urgent need that all centered around his captive Omega.
Draco reluctantly tucked in, choosing to eat the oatmeal first. The warm food against his tongue reminded him of how hungry he actually was. He began eating in earnest, ignoring Harry’s unnerving eyes on him.
Harry ripped himself from Draco’s spilled memory, stumbling backwards, his breath sawing from his lungs.
Draco didn’t want to push her into speaking again, so he didn’t try to coax words out of her. He knew she would speak when she was ready.
Harry took his throbbing cock in his hand and aimed it, pressing the crown against the boy’s warm, seeping hole. A barely formed knot was already showing at the base of his thickly veined shaft, his body ready to mate.
”Why do you smell so...” Draco swallowed thickly and grabbed Harry’s hand, lifting it to his lips. He pressed his nose against the back of Harry’s hand, nuzzling it.
Shoving some of his dark hair away from his face, Potter’s eyes cut to Draco. He flinched, sidling closer to Pansy.
Instincts and arousal controlling him, Draco tugged Harry’s head back up to take his mouth in a slow, languid kiss. Harry didn’t reciprocate, leaving Draco to clumsily lick and suck at his mouth, his inexperience painfully apparent.
He had a feeling she was tired of him moping around the manor. The past few months, all he’d done was take care of Scorpius and try
Draco was reluctant to admit that his jellybean moved the most at night, when he was in Harry’s arms. His baby reacted to his Alpha’s magic, kicking incessantly when Harry would transfer his magic to his pup.
No one needed to know. Maybe one day Scorpius would ask, but he would cross that bridge when he came to it.
They were wet, the pale swells sheening with breast milk. His pink nipples looked painfully engorged, steadily dripping milk. The droplets slid down Draco’s flat stomach before being absorbed by the waistband of his pyjama pants.
Harry nodded solemnly. “The one and only. Someone had broken into their home but hadn’t taken anything.”
Harry snapped his fingers and pointed to the dildo. “Stop staring. This is what you wanted, remember? Show me how you used to use one when you were in heat. I’m curious now, Draco.”
His raven hair was in fetching disarray, framing his roguishly handsome features. His green eyes were narrowed, a smirk curling his full lips.
Even if it hurt him more than anything else in the world, he would stay away from Harry Potter this time.
“I love him, Mum,” he said with surety. “He’s my mate and our alpha, and I don’t want to be with anyone else.”
Apparently, the low number of magical pregnancies in the past five years was beginning to become a growing concern for the Ministry.
A moving photograph of Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt shaking the hand of the Head Healer at St Mungo’s was depicted.
“And the way Scorpius has warmed up to Harry…” She smiled and gave a pointed look to Scorpius, still sleeping on Harry’s chest, his legs and arms lazily spread out. “I think it speaks for itself.”
Roland smiled at him, a charming divot appearing in his chin. “Finances, yes. I’m one of the financial advisors that work for the Ministry. I make sure budgets are set, to put it simply. If one too many Galleons are being spent on, let’s say, the Auror Department’s fieldwork potions, I come in and scale things back.”
He’d been trying to wean him for the past two weeks and he’d been able to get Scorpius down to only feeding for comfort rather than hunger.
Since he wasn’t allowed to take any sleeping potions due to his pregnancy, he would involuntarily call out for his Alpha each night. The Omega within him craved the company of his mate and his pregnancy only made the visceral
Arlen took a deep breath and sat up straighter. “Well, we could be here for hours if I went into all of that, but I can tell you a bit. Harry Potter was the reason the war was won in the first place. He killed Voldemort and stopped most of his Death Eaters. The ones that survived are all rotting in Azkaban now. Good riddance, if you ask me. The Prophet continued to write about Harry well after the war. He’s been in the limelight most of his life.”
Harry knew the euphoric effects of the potion would dull the boy’s sensitivity and give him a temporary feeling of faux calmness when he awoke. This bode well for Harry. It would be easier to lay out the rules and the slow torment he had planned for Narcissa’s son if Draco felt a false sense of security and wouldn’t go into hysterics right away.
! You never tell me anything! What has my family done to you that was so horrible?” his voice dropped to a whisper, “what have
His cruel taunt was a bit much, but Harry had hurt him, too. His words stung because there was a thread of truth to them. Draco had been born and married into money and his marriage to Theodore had been arranged by their parents to ensure their bloodline remained pure.
His daughter, Juniper, was still in her high chair at the table, playing in her mashed potatoes with her fingers.
Even though the thought of Harry fucking him made him recoil with disgust, his body anticipated it. He was an Omega, and his body naturally yearned for an Alpha’s attention.
That was exactly what Draco hadn’t wanted. He didn’t want to start getting in the way of Harry’s life, getting in the way of his career.
her?” Harry said in a mocking tone, his eyes narrowed. “And what of me, Draco? Would you admit to your mother that you allow me between your thighs each night, begging for more while you whisper that you
Their bond pulsed, sensing each other’s presence and reaching out to connect. It took everything in him not to run to Harry and kiss him. They hadn’t kissed in what seemed like forever and Draco was
Harry shuffled the notes on his desk to the side, running a hand through his hair. “Of course, bring them in, Jack.”
Hermione lowered her gaze back to the floor. “He’s been asking for him. Draco, I mean. He’s been asking for Harry. He hasn’t been that coherent in the last several hours, but all he’s asked for is Harry. It could be the drugs in his system, but…”
Draco couldn’t be sure from the distance and sunlight impeding his view, but he could’ve sworn that Harry’s pupils dilated.
“We’re doing perfectly fine by ourselves, Potter. I don’t need the Ministry to swoop in and play white knight and I certainly don’t need
“Is the pup okay?” Harry boldly slid his hand up to Draco’s covered stomach. “I’m taking you home to rest—”
“Have you weaned Scorpius yet, Draco?” he rasped, his eyes flicking down to Draco’s covered chest, his intent clear. “I dream about your taste, sweetheart. It’s been driving me fucking
The past week, he had convinced himself that his strong emotions for Draco would fade. Their bond could be broken. It was just going to take time.
Harry gave a derisive snort, flicking his cigarette ash into the crystal ashtray on the table in front of him.
His mother scoffed. “Well, forgive me for being so blunt, Harry, but I’m not going to just leave you alone with my son until I know what’s going on.”
He shifted Draco in his arms, retrieving the stoppered phial from his pocket. He used his teeth to remove the cork, spitting it to the side. He pressed the glass phial against Draco’s lips.
Harry shrugged and began plating the dinner he made for them. “She gets some time off. We don’t really take many holidays. We prefer to keep busy with our careers.”
Harry grinned and waved at the adorable pup. “Goodbye, Scorpius. I hope to see you again, little one.”
Harry released his hold on the boy’s wrist and slid two of his own fingers into Draco’s stretched hole, curling them alongside Draco’s own fingers inside of his wet heat.
His heart felt tight inside of his chest, like a tether connected it to the two people in front of him. He knew that the farther away they were, the tighter the tether would constrict. He knew it was silly to feel such strong emotions for them due to the fact that they had only just met, but he found that he couldn’t help himself.
Draco averted the tall Alpha’s seeking eyes. “You don’t have to promise anything to me, Harry. You don’t owe anything to me. You can date whomever you want. I don’t care.”
It wasn’t the impending rape that Draco was most upset about. While it did make him feel disgusting and ashamed, it wasn’t what he was most worried about.
He missed it so much. The smell of the ocean, the serene view of their quiet town from their open windows, the blessed
Harry was standing in the doorway, one outstretched arm resting on the frame. His black button-down was open at the throat, revealing his tanned skin and hint of chest hair. His sleeves were rolled up, showcasing his corded forearms.
“I was thinking,” he said softly, “about how angry I was when I found out the truth about that night at Hogwarts.”
Harry stared down at the both of them of them for several moments in silence before releasing a heavy sigh in return. “Let me help you, Draco. It’s not safe for you both to be on your own right now. The Ministry is only trying to err on the side of caution.”
Alphas naturally produced powerful healing enzymes that were released through their saliva. The enzymes served the purpose of healing their Omega before and after childbirth. Any difficulties that would arise from pregnancy, birth, or postpartum care was the sole responsibility of the Alpha who had gotten the Omega pregnant.
He unbuttoned the front of his shirt with one hand, revealing the pale swell of his engorged breast. A small bead of breast milk slid down from the boy’s pink nipple; Harry unable to stop himself from following the droplet with his eyes.
It was dark out now, silvery moonlight spilling across the manor’s triangular rooftops and pristinely manicured lawn.
Gringotts had repeatedly sent him letters about his captor’s vault and his instructions on how he wanted his wealth dispersed to his
Harry felt rage like he’d never felt before. The mere thought of some faceless Alpha touching Draco, let alone
Hermione’s smile faltered. “No, Draco, for your birthday. It’s your birthday today, don’t you know?”
When the red haze cleared, he looked at his innocent rabbit. He was spread out on his bed, trembling but still obediently holding his shirt up to expose himself to Harry.
After his dada had dressed him in new clothes, he had informed him that they were going out. He hadn’t been expecting a house
When he finally pulled his fingers away, he awkwardly cleared his throat. “There, do they feel any better now?”
“Here, love, open up.” Scorpius opened his small mouth, allowing Draco to pop a bite of food in. “Good job, darling,” Draco praised.
After leaving Pansy, he rushed into the living area of his flat just in time to see the emerald flames flare to life within it, signaling the arrival of someone.
Draco’s soft sighs and tiny moans seemed to plague him during his ruts, craving the sweet tang of the boy’s breast milk when he would wank himself.
Hermione nodded thoughtfully. “That’s an acute observation. Speaking of children, that’s why I popped by. Ron told me about Narcissa and her son. Do you want to tell me why you volunteered to take him in?”
Harry’s fingers slowed, imagining bending the boy over on his kitchen table and fucking him from behind. He would fuck him that way just to feel that tuft of fur brushing against his lower stomach each time he would viciously pump into his rabbit.
Maybe if he could bring this thing to fruition to face the light of day, he would feel better, but somehow, he doubted that.
He knew it was wrong to be having these kinds of thoughts about a teenager, but he couldn’t seem to stop himself from having them. When the boy was just inches away from him, trembling and needing reassurance…
The sound of his father’s study door locking by magic made a tendril of joy unfurl low in his belly, loving that Harry didn’t want anyone to walk in on them.
Small and pink, his prick hung flaccid between his legs. He had almost no pubic hair, save for some sparse blond curls. There was slight tremble to his pale thighs, his slender fingers wrapping around Harry’s forearms as he held him up.
Draco tucked Scorpius’ head under his chin, holding him close. He knew that he probably looked awful.
"Right. That's the thing, Harry. She had been pregnant when she fled. Draco Malfoy," he canted his head towards the boy, "is sixteen years old."
The lift halted, the doors opening. They were both silent, Draco refusing to look up from the flowers he held.
He lurched from the chair and was on top of the boy, yanking the offensive dildo from Draco’s limp fingers. He threw it to the side with a disgusted snarl, returning his hands to the boy’s pale thighs, shoving them open.
Draco looked up from his cup of tea, snapping out of the trance he seemed to be under since arriving back in London.
Harry glared down at him, looking as if were on the brink of losing it. “Fuck,” he grated, turning away from Draco. “Even now, my instincts are clamoring at me. They recognize my Omega is in
Harry let out a low groan and shoved his nose against Draco’s marked gland, licking and sucking at it. “Beg me for it, Omega, beg me,” he murmured hoarsely against his skin.
Harry assured himself that it was just a normal biological reaction. He was an Alpha and Draco was an Omega. They were biologically compatible, and he was inherently predisposed to react to Omega pheromones in such a way. It was as natural as his circadian rhythms or his ruts each month. Purely chemical, nothing more.
The man scoffed. “It says here you have ten years’ experience in household work, but you’re only seventeen?”
Ignoring all of his instincts, he pressed the dildo further, letting the bulbous head stretch past the tight ring of muscles.
Ginny didn’t live with him. They had been dating for about a year now and Harry was still hesitant about committing. They often stayed at each other’s places, taking turns traveling back and forth.
He rearranged them on the bed so that they were both laying on their sides, Draco’s back to Harry’s chest.
Shaking off his now drenched hair once he entered the threshold to the stables, he uttered a weak, “Hello?”
Draco whined, his prick hard and his hole leaking a copious amount of slick. “I want you, Harry, please,
Draco hands shook, hot tears finally escaping his eyes and sliding down his cheeks. “You’re a monster,” he whispered, protectively hugging his own stomach.
“W-what’s going on? I came as soon as I could, but Draco’s condition still isn’t stable, and St Mungo’s told me—”
The kisses left a trail of fire in their wake, the burning sensation traveling straight to Draco’s prick. When Harry sealed his lips over Draco’s scent gland on his neck and
Harry let out a dry bark of laughter, giving him a quizzical look. “What a direct question. This isn’t like you. What game are you playing at?”
The hope he still held for Harry was nothing more than dregs now, like the remnants of the tea leaves at the bottom of his cup.
Harry was the first to pull away, his emotions quickly erased from his face and that damnable wall sliding into place between their bond.
Scorpius tugged on a strand of his father’s silver hair, giggling when his father let out an indignant huff.
If he was pregnant, he wouldn’t want Harry anywhere near him again. His baby would be solely reliant on him and he couldn’t let that monster anywhere near his precious pup,
Had he already weaned Scorpius? Were they okay without him to help with the painful transition? He wanted to go to them, they
He let out a frustrated groan, attempting to ward off the intrusive thoughts by biting his tongue to stay focused. He kept reading the notes, narrowing his eyes.
Their combined pheromones were drenching the air around them, muddling his brain and adding to his already dizzying state of arousal.
If he had been an Alpha, maybe he could have protected his mother better. Maybe they both wouldn’t be in the situation they were now.
“Draco,” Harry said tiredly. “She’s Ron’s little sister and she is a dear friend. If I hadn’t invited her, it would have been impolite. We’re not together anymore, but it’s important to me that everyone in my life know that Scorpius is my son and now a permanent part of my life. Isn’t that right, love?”
“No,” Draco said hoarsely. “I’m not. I got upset because Hermione brought up an old friend of mine in the letter and it made me...sad.”
Without a goodbye, Potter turned and strode away back towards the manor, his broad shoulders stiff and his gait rigid.
Without thinking anymore about it, he sliced open the envelope with his finger and held it out over his open palm, shaking the unknown object loose.
Harry rested his head back against his pillow, unsure of how to proceed or how to react to such a sight.
A copious amount of slick was gushing from his hole now, covering Harry’s mouth and chin with sugary sweetness that only made his cock pulse with need.
Pansy, one of the servants, was standing over him with her hands on her hips, her lips twisted into a disapproving frown. Her long hair was pulled back under her mobcap, her dark eyes narrowed suspiciously.
When he pressed one of his leather-clad fingertips into a blister, Draco yelped and jerked his hand back.
Arlen shook his head, his eyes softening. “He doesn’t deserve to see you again. Let him rot, Draco. Let him die in the prison he’s created for himself.”
“I-I want you, too, Harry,” Draco whispered, lowering one his hands to sift his fingers through Harry’s thick black hair.
“Do you like it, Draco? I made it myself. The metal of this collar was made using fire crab shells. Quite an illegal material to obtain, but necessary for my intended use. It will absorb and repress your magic and ensure that you remain docile while under my care, pet.”
Draco glanced up, feeling himself blush under Harry’s intense gaze. Even though they had been intimate before, this was different. Harry was holding himself back, not showing Draco his usual kindness and praise.
Draco nodded, absentmindedly rocking Scorpius in his arms. “He put them in place years ago. I don’t know why anyone would go through all that time and effort to get in and not take anything. It doesn’t make sense.”
Draco cleared his throat, giving his mother a forced smile. “It’s okay, Mum. I need to talk to Harry about something and it shouldn’t take long.”
Hermione smiled and reached over, clasping his hand within her own. “You don’t need to apologize, Harry. Everyone goes through rough patches. Just don’t shut us out, okay?”
He got to his feet, steadying himself with a hand on the table before walking around it. Hermione quickly stood, pulling him into her warm embrace.
The blond tufts of hair sticking out from under the boy’s dark green knitted cap caught his attention. Though his back was to him, Harry could recognize him anywhere.
Harry found things attractive about Draco that he had never noticed on another person before: the curve of his full lower lip, his pale, slender wrists, and the column of his elegant throat...
“Really, Rose, you never grow tired of him doing that, do you?” Hermione asked, stepping from the flaring flames of the Floo behind them.
“Yes!” Scorpius chirped, throwing both of his hands into the air and sending bits of egg and pancake flying.
Draco stood at the entrance to the drawing room, hugging himself. “S-sorry! I didn’t mean to interrupt…”
His mother’s regal brows furrowed. “I thought you had already weaned him, Draco. You should put a stop to breastfeeding since he’s now eating solids regularly.”
Pansy sighed and took the bottle of wine from him, setting it on the island along with her knife. “It’s okay, kid. Do you want to help me make the desert?” When Draco remained silent, she said, “I’ll let you hold the mixing bowl.”
Draco shrugged, looking up at Harry from under his lashes. “It looks like no one ever goes in that room. Something must have happened to make you never want to look upon his portrait. Was he someone important to you?”
At the base of the boy’s spine, Harry could see the round outline of the boy’s scut vibrating under his shirt as he scratched.
have sex. Your breasts were so swollen, and you refused to take any potions or suppressants. I couldn’t stand to see you in such pain.”
of it. Once you take it all, I’ll spit right in that defiant mouth to accompany my seed on the way down.”
The fingers around Draco’s wrist were warm and calloused, pleasantly rough against the smooth underside of his wrist. He idly wondered how they would feel against other sensitive parts of his skin.
into money.” He cast a disdainful look around Draco’s living area. “Honestly, it doesn’t surprise me. You’ve always only cared about yourself. Secured your place in lush household and mated with a pure-blood Alpha.”
Surrounded by his Alpha’s scent, he would sit on the black leather chesterfield sofa and read through one of Harry’s novels. The antique grandfather clock in the corner of the office was charmed, the face changing from a bright morning sky to starlit night depending on the time of day. The steady tick of the pendulum within marked the passage of time while he lounged in the office, lulling him to sleep one evening as he read.
The boy's slender arms were stretched taut overtop his head, his wrists bound and tied to an eyelet hook that was bolted to the exam table above his head.
Draco looked up from under his lashes at him. “It’s no problem. It’s nice to get outside for a while.”
There was something broken inside of Draco, something he didn’t like to face when he was alone with himself.
Draco’s mouth with his own. Their combined pheromones saturated the air around them, making Draco begin to dazedly rock his hips against Harry’s erection, seeking friction.
“I-I don’t think that’s a good idea.” His breath hitched when Harry’s flat stomach brushed against his rounded one, inciting a traitorous spark of arousal.
Eat out his hole, lick up all of that sugary slick and then sink his aching cock into that delectable fluttering hole.
Before he could even react, Potter had stormed across the dirt floor of the stables and had Draco’s upper arm in his punishing gloved grasp.
He had thought that their night together had changed things. When Draco had told his parents that they were only
Ron’s ears flattened, his amber eyes casting Harry a look of disbelief. He could become so surly at times, but Harry knew it was because he was a fox breed. They often lost their temper for the most trivial things.
“I’m forever grateful for the Ministry’s hard work, especially when someone took down the wards.” His mother picked up one cup of tea, waving her other hand with nonchalance. “Pity they couldn’t catch the perpetrators.”
Sex between an Alpha and Omega during an Omega’s heat was revered and considered sacred by most societal norms. It was looked upon as something only mates partook in, mainly because it was the only time an Omega was fertile.
Harry began pumping into him with shallow thrusts, sliding the hand on his hip up his thigh and hooking his fingers under his knee.
Arlen was seated next to him, writing notes. “I never took Harry as an Alpha that liked surprises. He doesn’t say much during your checkups. Silent, brooding type, I think they call them.”
He could imagine Draco, alone and writhing in pain. He would need an Alpha to alleviate his heat pains, he would need—
Harry smiled back at his best friend, uncomfortable with being untruthful with her. In this, Hermione wouldn’t understand.
“Mhm, it smells so good,” Draco murmured, lightly running his lips over Harry’s knuckles. “Like chocolate...or...” Draco flicked out his pink tongue and ran it between Harry’s knuckles, the small muscle leaving a sheening trail of saliva behind.
The boy’s breath hitched. He rested one of his feet against Harry’s thigh, dangerously close to his covered erection. It throbbed beneath his trousers, hot and aching.
They both reluctantly separated, desire evident in Harry’s smoldering gaze. “He wants your milk,” Harry rasped, slowly licking his lower lip with his tongue as if to chase the taste of him.
Draco grimaced and left the kitchen, making his way back to the living room, towards the sliding double doors that acted as a partition between the dining area and the sitting area. They were closed now, and the sound of his dada’s muffled voice made him pause in his tracks.
Draco was still dressed in his work uniform that had several blotchy stains on the front of it from treating a patient that day who had been jinxed to repeatedly sneeze ink.
There was an iguana, a deer, and a chinchilla. At the end of the row was an animal that Harry couldn’t make out, it’s cage pushed to a darkened corner.
He couldn’t keep the derision from his voice, jealousy stinging him at the thought of his Alpha being around his
The boy furiously blushed, but did as he was told. He began wanking himself and Harry smirked before returning his tongue to his rabbit’s fluttering hole.
His thoughts were interrupted when the boy shifted again, putting two fingers into his mouth and beginning to suck on them.
A dribble of milk fell from Scorpius’ parted lips before he began mouthing unconsciously at Draco’s nipple again, seeking comfort.
And when he would look up Harry from under his lashes with those startingly silver eyes, putting all of his vulnerability into those pale gray depths…
There was an awkward beat of silence and Harry suddenly realized that he was just standing there staring and not speaking.
Draco snapped the loose thread from his shirt and set his teacup on the side table next to the sofa. He slid his hand into her lifeless one, entwining their fingers.
Draco continued pressing soft kisses down Harry’s throat, stopping to briefly nuzzle his scent gland.
“He did,” he gritted out. “But there’s no orders from the Ministry that I shouldn’t be around him.” He looked at Draco then, his mask of civility slipping back into place. “Draco, come now. I’ll escort you home.”
The stables were to the east of the manor, and even though the weather was poor, he enjoyed getting out for a bit.
Draco sighed, smoothing back some of Scorpius’ wayward hair. “Can I please put him down for a nap and then we can talk?”
“Well, I already love him,” Hermione cooed, smoothing back some of Scorpius’ blond hair as he finally shut his eyes and succumbed to sleep against her chest.
Draco came with a shuddering cry, ropes of semen shooting up, splattering against his swollen chest and Harry’s shirt.
The boy’s eyes moved restlessly beneath his closed lids, long, blond eyelashes casting shadows on his cheekbones. His clothing was tattered and smudged with dirt, the front of his button-down gaping open at the throat. One of the boy's small, pink nipples was exposed, seeming to taunt Harry.
,” he hissed, derision dripping from his words. “You cannot blink those pretty eyes at me and expect me to fall to me knees like some brainless beast being led around by his cock. Your wiles are
Harry nodded. “I’ll be back in the morning to see you to work. You can’t get rid of me that easily.”
Scorpius’ hair looked adorably mussed from Floo travel. He was dressed in a tiny green jumper that matched his eyes. As soon as he saw Harry, he gave a yip of excitement, his chubby cheeks ruddy.
An exam table had been set up in the middle of the room next to a table filled with magical medical instruments. Diagnostic spells in spindly, luminescent script floated in the air above the exam table.
Draco flushed hotly, Harry’s words inciting a flare of arousal deep in his belly. He knew his parents’ home wasn’t the most appropriate place to become aroused, but his mate always seemed to make him desperate for it no matter the location.
Harry chose to ignore it, resuming his cleaning licks, laving the rabbit’s privates no longer than necessary.
Draco stared vacantly at the wall behind them,  tears continuing to fall from his eyes. He didn’t meet Harry’s eyes before he whispered, “
While Roland was classically handsome with perfectly acceptable manners and an impeccable magical background, he was…
Draco groaned, slouching over on Harry’s sofa in the drawing room. One drink had turned into three. His head felt fuzzy and skin felt too warm. He had stubbornly insisted on continuing to drink even though Harry had warned him against it.
”Bashful, are we?” Harry chuckled. “Would it be better if I closed my eyes while I did it, sweetheart?”
He cupped Harry’s face in both of his hands and yanked him forward, crushing their lips together. Harry groaned, the sound fueling Draco’s desire. He pressed his chest flush to Harry’s and wrapped his arms around his neck.
When Draco had been spread out beneath him, his lids lowered to half-mast over his sultry gray eyes, begging for Harry to bite him while his cock had been sheathed inside of his beautiful Omega…
Before he could think better of it, Draco pushed to his tiptoes, a soft whimper escaping his parted lips. Harry closed the distance between them, pressing his mouth to his with a low groan. Heat unfurled low in his belly, ratcheting up several degrees when Harry’s tongue met his.
The Ministry still didn’t have any solid leads and the days had turned into months with still no word.
Draco looked up at him, eking out a small smile. “I know that, Harry. I’m just…worried. I don’t want anything to go wrong.”
Even though he was able to resist calling out for Harry, his body was emitting pheromones against his will in heavy, hot waves. His body was calling out to his Alpha— soundlessly
Draco’s lids felt heavy, slick starting to flow thicker between his legs because of Harry’s possessive words. He grabbed onto both of Harry’s forearms for balance, his wet belly pressing firmly against Harry, dampening his shirt. “I-I didn’t, Harry. He was just checking the baby,
“I—,” Draco said, swallowing when his mouth suddenly felt dry, “I won’t stop you from being in Scorpius’ life, Harry.”
Harry was silent for several moments, the steady tick of the grandfather clock and Draco’s dry sniffling the only sound to be heard in the otherwise quiet room.
After about an hour, Draco rose from the bed and went into the adjoining bathroom in his room. He decided to take a shower to calm his nerves, his jellybean suspiciously inert since he had returned home.
With pale skin, light blond hair, and large gray eyes, the young Omega had made Harry’s heart stutter.
A compendium of small black birds dispersed from the spindly balustrade next to the carriage and flew up, circling the highest turret of the manor, adding a foreboding effect to the image that would unsettle even the most taciturn man.
“Told her I was going to a friend’s place. She won’t worry,” Draco mumbled, purring contentedly against his Alpha’s neck.
The cacophony of various animal squawks, chirps, and growls assaulted Harry’s sensitive ears. The entire left wall of the shop was filled with floor-to-ceiling cages. They were filled with an eclectic mix of magical creatures, some Harry couldn’t even put a name to.
With Draco’s abuse publicized along with his mother’s escape from Azkaban, he’d been hounded by reporters day and night. It had all been too much for him at the time. He’d been a new mother with a newborn, but that hadn’t deterred people from trying to snap a photo of him whenever he was outside.
Hermione nodded solemnly, pain mirroring Draco’s own within the depths of her umber eyes. It was a different kind of pain, but pain, nonetheless. Hermione had never gotten over what her old friend had done to him.
He walked over and climbed beside him on the bed, pulling his back against his chest. He whispered a cleaning charm, the boy’s sweet-smelling slick and cum disappearing.
Draco whole, a muscle ticking in his jaw as he seemed to try to process what he had just admitted to him.
When they’d made love in Harry’s office at the Ministry, he’d been unable to look up at anyone as Harry had walked him out afterwards.
Things were simple with the charming Beta woman. She was easy to talk to and they both lived for their careers. She had demanding job as sports editor for the Daily Prophet and often traveled for work.
Draco smiled and laid back on the bed, pulling Harry overtop him. He had a blissed out expression on his face.
Draco hugged himself, his heart feeling as it were caving in on itself. “Loved? Past tense?” he asked hoarsely.
Draco Malfoy would be fine without him. All of his Aurors were more than proficient at their jobs and would figure out who had broken into Draco’s home. He didn’t need to supervise the investigation and he
The surrounding sounds of the city and the people seemed to disappear, a dull roaring noise edging towards a crescendo in Draco’s ears.
Draco Malfoy’s mother, Narcissa, continued pacing the floor in front of where he was seated on the chaise.
Potter didn’t seem to care. He hefted Draco up bodily into his arms and paid no mind to his desperate flailing.
over.” Harry clenched his jaw, flicking his gaze behind Draco, where Blaise was. “Have you had him around
They hadn’t yet made love and Harry was fine with taking things slow. He didn’t want to rush into sex and Draco was more important to him than physical satisfaction.
The ghastly headlines they’d printed in the Daily Prophet had turned his stomach so much that Ron and Hermione had stopped their owl from delivering them.
A female, the same species as him, was standing in front of the large kitchen island, chopping up slices of raw meat on a cutting board. Her ears and tail were pitch black, her pale skin a sharp contrast to her long sable hair. Her left ear bore a scarred over tear. It looked as if someone had bitten into it with serrated teeth.
Draco wasn’t even able to finish his sentence, cum suddenly spurting from his slit and splattering against his stomach and chest. Some of it hit Harry’s chin, making him smile against Draco’s nipple.
Draco pushed back some of Scorpius’ blond hair, a slight tremble to his hand. “My mother went to visit my father last night. She won’t be back for a couple of days and I thought I would be all right on my own. I assured her we would be fine if she wanted to go visit my father for a few days. I just can’t seem to get past this niggling feeling that someone is watching us at the manor. I must sound ridiculous…”
Kingsley hadn’t done himself any favors by introducing the new breeding law and his reformation decisions were beginning to tally up against him.
Draco jerked his chin from his grasp. “I’d never beg for you! I’d rather be raped by a room full of faceless Alphas than willingly give my body or my child to
Harry felt odd, almost as if he couldn’t bear to be away from Draco. Ever since he’d left him to talk with Kingsley, a voice in his head rebelled at being so far away from him, an animalistic roaring in his skull that reverberated with frightening intensity. His entire body felt strung too tightly, remnants of Draco’s sweet scent seeming to stick to his skin and seep into his pores until it felt as if the boy was living
He felt Harry spear him with his tongue, lapping up their combined juices and pulling back to press sweet kisses to his inner thighs.
Remembering last night, how Harry had curled an arm around his stomach, supporting him as he pounded into him from behind. Needy whimpers had escaped him with each thrust, his head turned to welcome Harry’s lips against his own—
Strong fingers gripped his jaw, pressing him back. His eyes snapped open, meeting Harry’s burning gaze.
Harry tugged Draco’s trousers and underwear off of him, tossing them to the side. Draco flushed when he felt slick ooze from his hole, his inner thighs tacky with it.
It wasn’t even the word that did it for him. It was what the word encompassed. He was Draco’s mate, his lover, the
Watching them both from the kitchen doorway, he felt unbelievably guilty. Scorpius needed his father and Harry...needed his
Harry pressed his tongue flat against the boy’s sweet tasting hole. He slid his hands up, using his thumbs to spread the boy wider. He stiffened his tongue and stuck it in the boy’s hole, curling it upwards as much as he was able.
Water sluiced down his chest, catching on his pebbled nipples. His body was reacting to his Alpha’s pheromones, slick beginning to seep from his hole and slip down his cleft, mixing with the water from his shower. His inner Omega knew when his Alpha was upset, his body becoming instinctually pliant and ready to soothe him.
With Harry’s earlier dejected expression and Narcissa’s seeking gaze burning a hole through his heart, he cleared his throat.
“You know, you can make this simple or difficult, Draco. If you do as I want without putting up a fight, I’ll reward you. If you continue to defy me at every turn, I can make you suffer.”
He knew that Lucius would be less than pleased when he learned the truth about Scorpius’ father, but he wasn’t planning on going anywhere and Lucius would have to accept that.
Harry spilled the memory into the basin, Draco’s silvery siphoned memory mixing with the smoky clouds within the basin. Gritting his teeth, he plunged his head into the basin.
…” Harry raised one hand and smoothed it down the boy’s ears, stopping to gently scratch behind them with his claw.
Draco’s pleading was cut off with a sharp gasp when Harry released his grip on one of his legs and shoved two of his fingers into his hole.
Draco met Harry’s gaze, his tongue flicking out to lick his lower lip. “They don’t hurt anymore, but…”
He felt cornered. Their expectant gazes made Draco want to flee from the terrace and lock himself in his room with Scorpius.
Hours later, Harry and Draco laid tangled together on the bed, exhausted. It was dawn, the first rays of the morning sunlight filtering in through the parted drapes on the tall windows.
The boy flinched and sidled up behind him, grabbing at his shirt and letting out a whimper. Harry turned and wrapped his arms around his quivering rabbit, giving him a patient smile.
”I’m aware you’re not a horse, boy. One of my thoroughbreds would be much more behaved than you. And of a much better pedigree.”
Harry’s familiar term of endearment for him made him whimper, sucking more of Harry’s length into his awaiting mouth. Before long, he was bobbing his mouth on Harry prick, his own saliva sluicing from the sides of his lips.
Harry reached up with one hand and pinched Draco’s chin between his fingers, turning his head to face him. “Kiss me.
Harry shifted under his gaze, his impossibly large cock bobbing between his legs. Draco licked his lips, eyeing the impressive length. It was thickly veined, the head reddened and sheening with pre-cum.
Harry made his way to his bedroom, stopping at the closed bedroom door. He paused, perking up his ears in attempt to listen. The sound of Draco’s panting breaths met his ears, making him throw open the door.
“Sorry, Gin. I actually have to go back to the Ministry shortly. I just came home to change my clothes.”
Harry smiled, but it was brittle. “When will you realize that there is no escape, Draco? Wherever you will go, I will find you. You are
rule. I told McGonagall to now allow you anywhere outside of the manor, so by disobeying her, you disobey
Another wave of searing heat washed over him, his thighs clamping shut, sticking together due to all of the slick seeping from his hole. He sucked in a sharp inhale through his gritted teeth, screwing his eyes shut even further.
All of the exits of the house were magically warded, their invisible barriers impenetrable to Draco, especially with his collar preventing him from using his magic.
Harry promptly bent and picked him up, carrying the boy to the tub. He carefully stepped into the water, lowering them both down. Harry moved his tail to the side and sat, pulling the boy between his legs so that his back was pressed to his front.
”These fucking intrusive thoughts,” Harry murmured, realizing that his cigarette had been burned down to the filter.
They were both busy with their respective careers and weren’t in a rush to make things permanent yet, though.
When Draco had read about how sexual contact was encouraged with their Alpha during an Omega’s pregnancy, his ears had burned with embarrassment.
Harry took pity on his rabbit, running one of his claws against the velvet edge of one of the boy’s ears. “Dada isn’t cross with you with, sweetheart. It’s just bath time.”
Something had been irreparably damaged within him. Something he didn’t know he if he could ever be able to fix.
The ride to Potter Manor had been long and tiring. He had fallen asleep somewhere along the way and by the time he had awoken, they had arrived.
Arlen let go of Draco and stepped back. “It’s no trouble at all, Draco. Take care of yourself and I’ll see you at your next appointment. It won’t be long now until you’re holding your pup in your arms.”
Harry’s confession felt like a battering ram had hit Draco, his heart hammering against his ribcage. His tears spilled over, wetting his cheeks and making him tremble with regret.
Harry smiled, his heart aching for the vulnerable Omega before him. “Yes, please. I don’t mind, really. It’s only natural.”
“You could never hold your alcohol well,” Ron sniggered. “I can’t count how many pubs I’ve had to basically carry you out of in our early twenties.”
Harry reluctantly nodded, rearranging his facial features into one of indifference. “If that’s what you want.”
His cheeks heated, warmth radiating outward from where Harry’s palm laid on his rounded stomach. His pup gave an excited kick from within his belly. “I said
Arlen chuckled. “Yes, that’s one way of doing it.” Arlen shifted, turning his attention to Harry. “Mr. Potter, you should maintain physical contact with your Omega, especially this early in the pregnancy. Draco needs your support, and your pup needs your magic. It’s absolutely vital to a healthy magical pregnancy.”
Draco padded further into the kitchen, stopping in front of the long wooden table right across from Harry. He placed his hands on his hips, feeling ridiculous because the sleeves of Harry’s shirt hung past his hands. Although he probably didn’t appear very intimidating to the tall Alpha, he didn’t
Unlike the man who had abused him, he would face his fears head on. He didn’t want petty revenge. He wanted closure.
Harry swallowed it all, his green eyes never leaving Draco’s as he came down, his chest rising and falling in quick, shallow pants.
Harry felt the head of Draco’s hard prick brush against his stomach, smearing pre-cum against it as he undulated under him.
It had been his intention, as a carnivore himself, to reign over all species: carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores. His goal was to climb to the top of the food chain by sheer force and he didn’t care about the fallout or ramifications that resulted.
In the beginning, part of him had wanted to travel to Gringotts and set fire to the vault, but what would that help in the grand scheme of things?
“Not much better, but looking a tad more perky,” Draco murmured, gently rubbing one of the fern’s leaves between his thumb and forefinger.
Draco had found himself unable to tear his gaze away from the pallid young man, even sitting on the covered bed and just staring at the portrait some nights.
Maybe he would always feel owned by him. Maybe something inside of him had been irrevocably bound to Harry, indelibly branded on his very soul.
With a pained shout, he hurled it at the wall next to the Pensieve. It shattered upon impact, sending small shards of glinting glass flying in every direction.
Harry sat across from him at the table, eyeing Draco with detached interest. “I’m afraid it’s gone cold since Kreacher prepared it this morning. You were throwing one of your stubborn fits, refusing to eat.”
Harry pulled back, casting him a patient look. “Cease your crying, pet. I won’t have it, not tonight.”
Harry was currently on a hiatus from traveling. He was working on his next novel and needed absolute concentration for the next six months if he wanted to churn out another bestseller.
Harry let out an amused huff of air. “So responsive. I haven’t even touched you yet and your body already knows who the one in control is.”
Draco smiled up at him and nodded shyly. “Okay, then. Here, Scorpius, Harry wants to hold you for a bit, love.”
”If you need me during the night, I left the signature for my wand on your wand. Just say my name and it will alert me. Also...”
Draco timidly lifted his jumper, exposing his stomach for the Healer. He had never before had to share so much of himself with other people—
Harry swiped his thumb against Draco’s nipple, collecting a bead of breast milk. He raised his hand and licked the droplet from his thumb, giving Draco a devilish smile that he could still see even in the darkness of the room.
Yes, work was something he could lose himself in. It always provided a distraction for him whenever he needed to get his mind off of more personal things he didn’t care to dwell on.
He trembled under his Alpha’s unnerving gaze, feeling utterly powerless and small beneath him. His lust-induced haze cleared just enough to allow him to form words.
The thinly veiled threat hung in the air between them. Ron’s eyes darted nervously between Kinglsey and Harry.
Draco felt sick, the jabbing pain in his back coming back with a vengeance. His knees gave out, falling to them before Harry. He reached up, grabbing two fistfuls of his shirt.
Draco lowered the letter, his heartbeat quickening. A cold sweat broke out over his skin, his fingers trembling around the letter.
Draco pursed his lips, feeling a flare of anger at Harry’s condescending words. “I suppose they won’t have any plaques made for you. Not with looking the way you do.”
Harry nodded and stepped up to him, making the younger man shrink slightly back, his back hitting the stone column behind him.
Harry watched in avid fascination as Narcissa’s expression changed, morphing into horrified realization before hardening into infuriated acceptance. Her blue eyes became drained of all emotion, narrowing to slits.
He’d escorted a few prisoners to Azkaban during his Auror days, and the interior of the prison remained unchanged.
He reached out through their bond, seeking his Alpha’s emotional embrace. Harry’s emotions bled through the cracks of his shield, tendrils of
“Maybe she would have been better off if she never had me. Perhaps her life would have been…happier. I also can’t help but wonder, if I were
Harry stiffened his tongue and slid it into Draco’s hole, loving how it made his Omega keen and cry out as he lazily explored with his tongue.
His rabbit’s shoulders stiffened and he turned away, yanking down the hem of the overly large shirt over the top of his pale thighs.
He knew that Theodore’s sudden disappearance from their lives was probably confusing for her, but there wasn’t much he could do to reassure her that everything was going to be all right by acting as if everything were normal.
He didn’t know if it had happened during the War or under the callous care of the Dursley’s during his youth. Perhaps it happened even farther back than that.
own his pup. If he could get his jellybean away from their Alpha, maybe his jellybean could have a chance at an actual life. A life of
Anger was emanating from his Alpha in suffocating waves, making his inner Omega want to whine and present his throat in apology.
The small village was decorated for Christmas. Red, green, and blue Christmas lights were strung up across the front of the quaint shops. Enchanted candles floated within the snow-dusted trees and different holiday game and merchandise booths were set up for the students and parents that were visiting for the festival.
It held detained suspects that were awaiting trial and also kept convicted witches and wizards who were awaiting transportation to Azkaban. It was heavily guarded. Two Watchwizards standing guard at the entrance gates hastily stepped aside when they saw Harry and Ron striding towards them.
One early morning, after the rabbit being in his animal form for nearly two weeks, Harry awoke to a surprise.
“So, what was the plan, pet? I’d really love to hear it. Would you seduce me into fucking you tonight and when I was finally asleep, bash me over the head with an object, like you tried to do when we first met?”
It was dried peppermint, sage, and lemon balm pressed into an oil that his mother had deposited in several phials.
He lost himself in the fantasy of choking the large Alpha to death for a moment, a small smile curling his lips at the mental image.
Harry stepped closer to him, sending reassurance through their bond in strong waves. “I don’t need anyone
”You’ll let me know when he’s ready to converse? I know if he gets pregnant, he’ll be whisked away to St Mungo’s for numerous appointments.” She gave a mock shudder. “I don’t miss that. Especially under the Ministry’s scrutiny with the new breeding law.”
“You’re not in trouble, little one. I just don’t have any food here that would suit your palate. In the morning, I’ll go to the store and get some food just for you, okay?”
Draco cradled his stomach with one arm, using his other arm to hold himself up from the floor. His entire body
Draco looked away, to the the grandfather clock whose face held a moving picture of him and Theo on their wedding day.
Drowning in the maelstrom of his own self-hatred and bitter revenge while Narcissa’s memories showed him just how
When Harry had seen the young man breastfeeding his pup, surrounded by those pale pink roses, something had shifted within him.
The small flutter in his stomach when Harry had touched him had made his heart breathe a sigh of relief. With everything chaotic going on his life, this was
Draco stood with Scorpius in his arms, his face feeling as if it were on fire. “S-Sorry! I thought I was alone.”
It was undeniably mad to keep having these thoughts over the boy. He decided that he would push the boy from his mind and focus on work.
It was the first thing Draco could think of in the moment, latching on to any familial relation that Harry might have had with the man.
Draco’s throat suddenly felt closed up, his finger now numb from how tightly the thread constricted it.
The cold rain seemed penetrate through his clothes, down to his skin beneath. He shivered, that feeling of despair in stomach mixing with the coldness that seeped through his skin.
He quietly observed his surroundings from under his lashes, mapping out any escape routes if the chance was provided to him.
He let out a startled yelp, involuntary taking a step back. His foot caught on his plush rug, causing him to stumble.
“Now you know how I have felt for the past few months, Draco. I’ve wanted you so much, wanted to form a bond with you and Scorpius. But now, you get to feel how it feels to be
Draco’s begging made the Alpha within him snarl with desire, tearing and clawing at his mind in an attempt to rend his self-control apart.

Harry scoffed. “As if I’d willingly follow someone like you. How I got landed with babysitting a pure-blooded brat like you—“
Wanting nothing more than to see the boy’s pale, flat stomach swell with his seed until the boy was filled with nothing but
When he’d gotten pregnant, he’d had to leave school before his last year. He wanted to go back this year to sit for his NEWTs and get a high-paying job so that he could support Scorpius on his own.
Harry snarled against the boy’s wet hole, finally releasing his hold on his self-control. He jerked himself harshly, coming with his face still buried between the rabbit’s slick-coated thighs. His cum splattered against his expensive rug beneath his bare feet, a barely formed knot surrounding the base of his prick.
Draco whimpered and instinctually bared the side of his throat submissively, his Omega instincts on high alert around the clearly angry Alpha.
Harry couldn’t help but feel unease as the man’s yellow eyes skittered over him, fleeting but unnerving.
Harry saw that the rabbit had left his food untouched, but the fur around his pink nose had been damp. At least he knew he had drank some water.
of it all. He wanted to go back, back home where no one forced him to do anything. Back home where he could be himself and there were no collars or ropes.
. “Fine. Let our pup suffer due to your own carelessness. I won’t touch you. Let’s see how long you can hold out. By not following the Healer’s advice, you will lose our pup and the only one to blame will be
Potter was eerily still, sitting on the bale of hay with his legs lazily spread. The riding crop had fallen to the ground beside the bale of hay, forgotten.
Harry licked down the boy’s sternum, heading for his genitals. He daubed his tongue into the boy’s bellybutton, smiling against his skin when his sweetheart let out a soft sigh.
“Good news? Ever since your existence was made known to me, it has been nothing but bad news for me and my family, Potter.”
He couldn’t become sentimental at a time like this. He was pregnant and his husband was still missing.
Even if it meant sealing Draco’s hate for him. In the end, he had to remind himself what he had started this all for.
To his left, a chestnut-colored mare was poking her head over the edge of her stall. He set the wrapped lunch on a nearby bale of hay and cautiously approached the mare, giving her a small smile.
Draco hugged himself. “Sorry, I’m just nervous. I’ve never…brought home a man before. Especially someone so…renowned.”
The girl knocked on the door, actually waiting for approval to enter, unlike how she had barged into
Harry leaned forward, his lips pressing against Draco’s ear before he whispered, “Do you think I’m a
!” Harry roared, reaching down with one clawed hand to hike up the hem of the boy’s shirt. He pressed his claws to the curve of his rabbit’s arse, digging his claws into his delicate skin.
Harry felt twisted satisfaction at Draco’s admission, delighted that the boy wasn’t currently with an Alpha.
Harry hungrily raked his gaze over him, his pupils dilating until his eyes appeared almost fully black.
Draco stared at the applicant in front of him. He’d picked the man from the folder he’d gotten from the AIP the week before.
Draco calling him by that after finally telling him he loved him was like being finally recognized for what he truly desired to be for his family.
Draco immediately felt guilty for his childish thoughts. He knew this night was important to Harry. He knew he didn’t have the right to feel jealousy when Harry and he weren’t even technically together anymore.
Draco glared back up at him, trying to ignore his body’s reaction to the alpha pheromones Potter was pumping into the stale air of the small stall. The light grip Potter had around his throat was almost like a warning, his gloved fingers flexing against the sensitive skin directly beneath his ears.
Harry needed no further direction. He hooked his fingers into the waistband of Draco’s trousers and briefs and yanked them down, throwing them to the side. Once his trousers were off, it left Draco entirely nude besides his small slip-on shoes.
Unable to help himself, he snapped his hips upwards. Draco choked and whined weakly, but then eagerly sucked Harry’s cock deeper into his throat in response.
Draco doubled over, pressing his clammy forehead to the floor. The tightening pain in his stomach intensified to an almost unbearable degree.
His words were cut off when Harry put the tips of his fingers in his warm mouth, licking around his fingertips. His warm, wet tongue against Draco’s cold skin sent a bolt of desire straight to his prick, emitting a tiny whimper as Harry languidly sucked.
Harry closed the distance between them, gently capturing his wrist and raising it to press a kiss to the back of it. “I do, Draco. I want this. I want you,
The ground floor held the waiting room. It was bustling with Healers and witches and wizards who were being admitted.
Everytime Harry had come, he had pulled Draco in for a heart-wrenching kiss that seemed to shake Draco to his core no matter how many times they did it.
It was hard to do when the evidence of their reason for their hatred of each other was permanently carved on Harry’s skin.
Octavius coughed, his chest rattling like dry bones rubbing against each other. “Self-preservation. When they’re taken, the stress of it causes them to shift to their animal form. They feel safer that way.”
His friends always reminded him that he was growing older. They wanted Harry to have pups of his own and some sweet Omega at home, waiting to suck his cock and take his knot.
The man gave a noncommittal hum, his eyes traveling over each of Draco’s slim fingers. The firelight reflected on the man’s dark hair, giving the illusion of a flickering burgundy glow within his raven locks.
Draco held onto her longer than necessary, inhaling her unique scent. He didn’t know if he would ever see her again, so he basked in the now.
“No one had been home, but his wife, Narcissa, decided to report it to us. I think she’s being cautious because their son has a baby living there with him.”
Most of his life had been spent with his aunt Bellatrix in the country and they had been barely able to afford furniture, let alone throw
A Healer sat off to the side, a quill in one hand and a notepad in the other. She was furiously scribbling notes onto the pad of paper.
“I had to do a bit of digging, but I was able to find it. I even got the help of the headmistress of Hogwarts. She used to be my professor, so it was fairly easy. I hope you don’t mind, I just thought…you’d want something to remember them.”
“Every time I fuck you, you beg and plead for me to stop, but raise your hips in the air for more after each thrust. Is that how you’re able to live with yourself, Draco? By acting like you hate it?”
Even though his mother and father had constantly pressed, he’d never revealed who the father was. It was a secret Draco intended to take to his grave.
The whispered plea penetrated Harry’s lust-induced haze, snapping him out of his own instinctual driving need to
Uh, warning. Some squick? Listen, there’s gonna be some ✨stuff ✨ going on between these two in their animal/half-animal forms.
Harry gave him another experimental scratch with his short claw, lifting his thigh to press harder between the boy’s thighs.
“They were sorted into the same house, you see. This photo was taken when they were in a club together. For Herbology, I believe. It seems Narcissa had a fondness for plants. Well, I’m sure you already knew that.”
Draco’s earlier harsh words made him inwardly cringe. He hadn’t meant to be so cruel, but Harry’s own insult had angered him in turn.
Draco’s ears burned with embarrassment, but he looked up, meeting Harry’s eyes. “I-I’ve been using your clothes, the ones I borrowed. They…smell like you, so I keep them with me during my heats.”
Harry plunged his cock back into his hole, groaning low in his throat as Draco’s channel hungrily enveloped him.
His captor’s crimes had garnered a lot of attention, his celebrity status in the magical community shifting when he had confessed. They had deemed him a monster, his actions so deplorable that his books had been pulled and no longer sold.
He held the photo out in front of him, dangling it between his fingertips. The photo ignited at one corner, flames beginning to devour it whole. Draco’s angelic face disappeared from view as the fire consumed.
With shaky fingers, he buttoned up the collar of his shirt underneath his jumper, effectively hiding his collar from view.
They both began to eat their breakfast, the food now cold but he didn’t care. Nothing could spoil his mood.
Harry released her arms and cupped her face between his hands, focusing on the dilated pupils of her blue eyes.
Harry lifted his spit-covered fingers in front of Draco’s widening eyes and stuck them in his mouth, licking at Draco’s saliva and dried slick.
Harry smirked, watching as a group of young witches and wizards stood in front of the booth, their youthful faces focused as one boy held his wand above the water, poised to shoot.
Magical pregnancy was only possible for an Omega witch or wizard. Even then, it was extremely high risk. The precautions that had to be taken after an Omega witch or wizard was impregnated were endless. They had to be carefully observed and rarely left alone.
Harry searched his eyes with his own, leaning down until their breath intermingled. The scent of Firewhisky was evident on his breath and Draco wanted to
Pansy was single and a Beta, so she had no pups of her own to take up her time, so she spent most of it fretting over Draco.
Harry didn’t know why he couldn’t fully commit to Ginny. She was beautiful, smart, and kind, but Harry still felt...reluctant.
Draco nodded mutely, holding Scorpius tight. “I-I know what I did was wrong, Harry, but you have to understand
“He’s inside, Auror Potter. He’s been inside since yesterday. He hasn’t left, I’m sure of it. His mother took the baby and left two days ago. There hasn’t been anyone in or out.”
Draco set the lunch container he had brought on the floor by his feet and turned to face him, giving him a shy smile.
They both sat on the sofa, a surge of arousal and possessive happiness coursing through him when Draco immediately scooted closer to him.
Scorpius slapped one pudgy hand against Draco’s chest, nuzzling into his scent gland on his throat. “Mummy, milk?”
The head of Draco’s prick glistened with pre-cum, the sparse blond curls that encircled the base of his shaft, damp.
he felt without Harry around. He remembered seeing that column in Witch Weekly about Harry being single and how jealousy had seized him, gripping his heart painfully tight and unrelenting.
”Dada!” Draco cried sharply, a thin trail of blood sluicing down the white fur of his ear, staining it crimson.
Harry was dressed in all black, looking stark against the pristine white backdrop of the large bathroom.
The manor was a stone fortress of gloom. The tall, thin windows that covered the front of the manor were all darkened, the glass reflecting the grey skies above and nothing else.
boy. He’s never hurt anyone. If you must kill me, so be it, but don’t take out your anger on Draco. He’s done nothing to deserve it. Please don’t hurt…my grandchild.”
Draco hunched his shoulders defensively. “They say at my appointments that the baby is measuring okay…”
After Harry had saved him from the magical fire, Draco had been pulled back home by his mother. He hadn’t had a chance to see the damages done to his savior and part of him wished he still hadn’t.
Whatever the repercussions were for keeping Scorpius from Harry all this time, he would accept them.
Draco swallowed thickly. “T-that’s ridiculous, Harry. I told you, I was in heat. I probably wasn’t making much sense at all last night, let alone enough sense to string together a sentence like that. There was nothing behind it.”
Ever since Kingsley had abolished Dementors from guarding Azkaban, the Aurors he’d assigned for watch duty at prison were specially chosen based upon their experience and skills. The decision had been voted on in the Wizengamot, but several people
?” Draco pushed up to his tip toes, pressing a soft kiss the underside of Harry’s jaw. A soft purr emanated from the back of his throat, his body recognizing it’s Alpha and feeling calmed in his presence.
“Are you Potter’s new pet?” she asked in a cynical tone. “It’s all my owners have been blabbering about the past few weeks.”

Draco reluctantly stood and walked over to Harry, stopping just in front of his legs. “What?” he asked sullenly.
Harry took him outside of his cage for an hour or two each day, allowing him to hop around his bedroom as he worked. The rabbit would tire easily, curling up next to Harry’s feet and falling asleep.
“But yes, there was a time when we were both young and mischievous. I think all we did was get into trouble at Hogwarts, but we always had fun together. Ron included.”
He knew that his parents were only worried about his wellbeing, but he wasn’t one to lie down and admit defeat.
The simple black collar around his neck had been designed by Octavius. He had informed Harry that it was designed to negate his magic use. He had also told him it was charmed to adjust to his size. That meant that when the rabbit decided to change back, the collar would adjust accordingly.
“Oh, I almost forgot. I thought it would be fun to look at some old photos of us when we were younger. I’ll show you that Harry wasn’t always so serious-looking,” Hermione said, laughing softly.
His poor Omega was probably dripping slick, waiting for his Alpha to come and fill him up, his breasts needing suckled—
Draco looked back to Potter’s retreating form. When the grey moors swallowed his figure from view, Draco realized he still held Potter’s glove in his trembling hand.
Draco smiled and looked at the sliding glass door leading outside, at the clear blue sky and his potted fern still sitting on the balcony.
Harry smiled and lifted his hand. “That’s right, sweetheart. Come out and I’ll get you some clothes.”
Even now, with Harry’s pheromones so prevalent in the air around him, his hole hadn’t stopped secreting slick. The sticky, warm substance oozed from his hole, coating his arse and inner thighs.
He craned his neck to the side, unwittingly sniffing the air to follow the intoxicating scent with his nostrils.
Or would he forever live with the regret of ruining a relationship with a man who actually cared for him?
Draco nodded sullenly and gave her a small smile. “Say that in four months when I’m huge and asking you to take on more of my patients due to only being able to waddle down corridors instead of sprint like I usually do.”
Harry was quiet for a long moment before he reached down and let one of his fingers softly brush against Scorpius’ cheek, against where Draco’s tears had fallen.
Draco’s smile broadened and he pushed to his tiptoes to attempt to scratch higher behind the mare’s ears. “What’s her name?”
Harry raised his free hand and reached around the boy’s thigh, grabbing his prick. He wanked them both at the same time while he kept spearing the rabbit’s hole with his tongue.
“It also won’t rectify any problems left behind. To stay and face your fears, that is true bravery. For a person to
Draco was used to the finer things in life. His father’s amassed fortune had earned them a comfortable life in Wiltshire, and he was quickly beginning to realize that his posh lifestyle would be a thing of the past while under employment at Potter Manor.
Draco’s sore breasts were rubbing against the edge of seat cushion between Harry’s legs, colostrum leaking from the tips due to Harry’s rough stimulation of them in the bathroom.
I know you’re all clamoring to see what happened between Harry and Draco in the past and I promise you, IT’S COMIN’.
“Among other things,” Draco admitted, flushing again. “What, you never had pups of your own? No omega waiting for you at home, Potter?”
Memories bombarded him from all sides, Narcissa mercilessly inundating his eroding mind with images of Draco growing up.
Harry reached forward with his free hand and took Draco’s face between his fingers, pinching. “Then get to it, pet.”
Rose giggled and shook her head, her long red hair swaying with the movement. “You don’t operate on small cuts, Harry! You kiss them better!”
He no longer attempted to use his magic. The collar proved to be a strong magical deterrent, too advanced for him to try to figure out on his own.
Harry nuzzled his lips against the dripping bud, tasting Draco’s sweet breast milk on his tongue and lips. “So
”I’m your new owner, little one. Your master, your captor, and eventually...the father of your children.”
When Potter struck him again, Draco couldn’t suppress the high-pitched moan that escaped him. His bottom felt raw and hot and he was unable to stop himself from spreading his thighs to try to lessen the ache building between in his groin and radiating towards his hole.
Harry stared down at the envelope, his thoughts in turmoil. The envelope wasn’t entirely flat. There was an oblong object within making it bulge slightly from both sides.
Harry shoved a third finger into Draco’s hole, quickening the pace. His hole squelched noisily around his fingers, brushing against
”I’m going to go out to the garden to feed him. I suppose it would be safer if you made the Ministry aware of what happened, Mum. If you need me, I’ll be outside.”
Harry tightened his hold on the boy’s wrist and rammed his fingers upwards, Draco’s wet hole eagerly sucking in more of his fingers.
”So brave, my sweet one,” Harry praised, beginning to clean the rabbit’s soft tummy with his tongue.
If Draco thought he could win him over with some trite apology after the other night, he had it wrong. He was tired of all of Draco’s prevarication when it came to the subject of Scorpius’ Alpha and his
“You smell like that dolt out there,” he said gruffly. “Why didn’t you tell me you were experiencing discomfort?”
“Fuck you!” Draco pursed his lips to spit, but Harry grabbed his cheeks between his strong fingers, squeezing.
Arlen nodded and stood. “Since your condition is currently delicate, Draco, I’ll make visits to your home instead of making you travel to the hospital. I’ll return next week to check up on your pup.”
Draco blinked, warmth blanketing his chest and smothering the nervousness he had been carrying since he had decided to tell his parents the truth.
Harry promptly leaned forward, pressing his opened mouth to the boy’s hole. He licked at the reddened rim, slick and the faint tang of the boy’s blood evident on his tongue as he lapped.
It wasn’t fair to his jellybean to be caught in the middle of this. They were just an innocent pup, reacting to their parents’ combined magic. They didn’t deserve to be used by Harry like a
If Draco had trusted him enough to risk sharing this guarded secret, then Harry could be strong enough to view it.
His blond hair was spread around his head on the sheets, like a halo. His full lips were chapped, a faint flush visible across his small nose and cheeks.
”I returned this morning,” Potter replied coldly. “And I’d love to hear why the boy was allowed outside of the manor without my approval.”
Harry was only wearing a pair of boxer briefs, his tail unconsciously flicking happily next to him on the bed due to the sight of the boy slumbering on top of him.
His breasts were smaller now, not as swollen with milk as they had been. Scorpius rarely nursed anymore, and Draco was embarrassed of his post-nursing breasts.
Pansy groaned and grabbed Draco’s hand, tugging him back towards the kitchen. Once they were back inside, she whirled on him.
The man stiffened behind him and Draco glanced to the side, seeing Pansy standing completely still next to them. Shadows hid her expression from view, but Draco could see the knife still clutched in her right hand at her side.
He knew that he had to stop having these obsessive thoughts about the boy, but he seemed unable to fight his baser instincts. Draco was an Omega, a
Draco shook his head, crossing his arms over his chest. “My father will be hard to convince of our relationship, Harry.”
Draco sighed tiredly and smoothed back some of his daughter’s curls as he held her. ”You can let yourself out now, Potter. I have things I need to do.”
His breasts were engorged again, filled with milk for his pup. His nipples were continuously leaking his sweet milk, deepened to a rosy color because of the swelling.
There was a beat of silence on his mother’s end. She re-crossed her legs and smoothed down her already perfectly groomed white-blonde hair with her free hand, as if to compose herself before answering.
“Yes, you may, but don’t eat any sweets. I’m making dinner soon and I don’t want you to ruin your appetite.”
The morning sickness had finally abated somewhat, and he found that he had more energy more now. When he would get out of the shower, he would examine himself in the mirror. He wasn’t showing that much, but he had always been naturally thin, so the small swell of his stomach made it apparent that he was with child.
He pushed his trousers and briefs down his thighs further and placed one hand on the back of the sofa for leverage. With his other hand, he cupped Draco behind his knee again and pressed his folded leg up until his bent knee was almost touching his ear.
Harry grabbed his chin with his fingers and tilted his head up. “You’ll beg for it, Draco. You will beg for me to fuck you and when you do, I’ll make sure to make you
Draco held Scorpius close, rocking him. “I just don’t think I should, Harry. I think the best decision is for me to go back home.”
He shifted and pulled a photograph from his trouser pocket. He had intended to show it to Narcissa, a last ‘
He pulled back and smiled, seeing that Draco was smirking up at him. His mate looked sated, and it made possessive pride swell within Harry’s chest, knowing
Without any preamble, Potter’s thick finger prodded his slick entrance, tracing the rim of his hole with unbearable softness compared to his punishing slaps.
Draco felt an unwanted stab of jealousy in his heart, his ears burning with mortification at the realization.
Potter Manor was located in the Yorkshire Moors in England, away from virtually everything else, it seemed.
It was that night all over again, when he was forced to make a decision due to the betrayal of his own body.
Harry’s cock rubbed against that euphoric spot inside of him at the same time Harry’s mouth pulled his milk from his breast, the suction and intense pleasure making him come with a shocked whimper.
family for work. Perhaps a family with children. He loved children and one day wanted pups of his own.
“The reason I asked if you had gone to school is because these hands,” he paused to squeeze one of Draco’s hands in his own, “are not the hands of someone who has been working most of their life. You have no calluses on your palms and your skin looks completely untouched by the sun.”
He knew that as an Omega in heat, nothing would be able to satisfy him except his Alpha’s cock sliding against his inner channel, those veins and ridges catching against every euphoric spot inside of him that incessantly burned with hot
He knew that this was what had been missing from his life. Raising Scorpius on his own had been met with its own challenges, but he never complained. He had been stubborn and steadfast about doing it on his own and had thought that Scorpius would only ever need
Harry sighed, pulling his hand out from under Draco’s. “I suppose one won’t hurt, but no more than that.”
Draco flushed, watching as Harry pressed another open-mouthed kiss to his wrist, feeling the fleeting brush of his tongue against his skin.
Draco nodded dazedly, his leaked slick coating his inner thighs and creating obscene wet, squelching noises as Harry pounded into him.
He’d stayed with Hermione after giving birth for a couple of months while he adjusted to motherhood and she’d been fiercely protective of him during that time.
Harry narrowed his eyes. “Tell me the truth, Draco. Are you nervous about tonight? I promise it’s just my closest friends.” He sighed, hugging Scorpius to his chest. “If you don’t want to go through with it, we can just tell them—”
Draco flushed, the tips of his ears burning. His father always had a way of getting under his skin like no one else could. “I know, Dad, but please listen. We were just—”
Draco flushed and covered his chest with his arm, still embarrassed by how swollen his breasts had become in the past few months.
Fear skittered up Draco’s spine, his body stiffening under Harry’s rough hands. “I-I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
Harry picked up his pace, delivering brutal slams of his cock into Draco’s hole, his slicked channel gripping Harry with unrelenting pleasure.
