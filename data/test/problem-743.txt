Severus raised an eyebrow. "You mean we're not?" He sounded put out.
. Rose walked briskly to her room and promptly jumped onto her bed when she entered her quarters. She tidied her vanity and summoned a binder full of her notes; she separated her papers into piles, working until she was burning the midnight oil, so to speak. She'd return the cloak tomorrow.
He opened his eyes to that warm, inviting, dark space that he had inhabited so often recently, so he wasn’t surprised to see Potter sat waiting for him.
Draco’s world fell away for the moment. It felt like someone had hit him with the Levicorpus Spell, like the world had been yanked out from underneath him and he was hanging, suspended by a thread, over the horror that loomed below him. The Dark Lord continued to speak, “He was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself while you lay down your lives for him. We bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone.”
The aches felt deeper than the ones he had gotten after long Quidditch practices, but then Harry to remind himself that he was older and more likely to feel these things far deeper. He found Hermione in the atrium once again, and was about to suggest heading back to Grimmauld Place when she went up on her tip-toes and waved across the crowd. Harry shrank back when he saw Malfoy approaching.
“It’s not the same, Uncle Draco!” she exclaimed and he crouched a little, to meet her eye-to-eye.
“I believe both,” Harry said, shrugging one shoulder and there was a flicker of shock that crossed Voldemort’s face, though he quickly masked it by laughing, his high, cold laugh wrenching the air in two.
Once they were all seated, the Fellows shut the hall doors and wound their way through the desks to the front of the hall. There was a large blackboard at the front of the hall, raised on a dias, that proclaimed in large but neat writing ‘SPECIALISED 1’.
“Potter – he helps. I don’t – I don’t know. It doesn’t hurt as much when he’s touching me,” he said in a quiet voice and there was a stunned sort of silence before Granger sighed.
The applicants all milled around the atrium, some gathered around the tea making facilities like the hot water urn held all the answers, some sat in the scattered chairs, elbows braced on their knees while they stared into space. Harry and Draco shucked their coats and hung them up on the provided coat hooks, looking around the room at their fellow nervous candidates.
“-It is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it. I must ask you, therefore, to move quickly and calmly and do as your prefects–” she was cut off by a different voice that filled the Hall, high and clear and so very, very cold. Draco staggered and Blaise caught him around the middle as the students started to scream.
He woke up hours later to find Potter gone.
“The building has been touched by Dark Magic. You’d need to cleanse it and tear down the old building entirely, including the foundations, before you’d ever be able to rebuild again,” he explained and Granger nodded, contemplating his answer. Potter slipped a hand out from under the cloak and Draco was about to tell him to bring it back in, in case some unsuspecting Muggle happened to walk by and see a disembodied hand floating in mid air, but all Potter did was reach out and hold on to the rusted gate, his knuckles turning white from the intensity at which he held it.
“You need to think of something happy,” Potter reminded him as the Patronus faded into stardust before their very eyes. Draco turned and glared at him.
Draco kept his expression neutral, bored even, even though internally he was screaming. His blood had suddenly run cold.
“Like ‘ell you are,” Scabior said and the other Snatchers laughed. “We know Stan Shunpike. ‘E’s put a bit of work our way,” and Greyback smacked Weasley around the face. Weasley coughed and spat blood to the floor.
“Check the list, Scabior,” and the Snatcher to Draco’s left pulled a scroll of parchment out of his robes. Greyback rounded on Weasley, taking a rough grip on his chin and forcing his head up. Draco saw his nostrils flare when the scent of blood hit them. “And what about you, Ginger?” he asked.
,” he said and like the first time he had ever used this spell, the spell fizzled and died before it could even escape his wand. Amycus had grabbed him by the robe before he could even try again and pulled it harshly, causing Draco to gasp.
the following morning, that there had been a breach in security at the Ministry of Magic. Draco listened to the students around him mutter about it, and he felt hollow. He wanted so desperately to dream and see if Potter was okay, but he couldn’t. That moment of weakness in the Slytherin common room, falling asleep and shouting out Potter’s name, had been too close. If anyone suspected Draco knew something – he dared not think about it.
“Come on,” Mrs Weasley whispered to Draco, pulling him back as Harry passed him, his focus solely on Voldemort.
“Would I like the wife and children and Lord Malfoy nonsense? No, thank you,” he replied shortly and he took another bite of his sandwich. Potter studied him for a moment longer and then turned back to the book in front of him. They ate in silence that was only interrupted by the scrape of a spoon or the occasional grunt off Weasley from where he still slept in the armchair. After a few minutes Potter straightened again, frowning.
"How could it
Surprisingly, he had even found companionship with Ron. Bill had a very old and chipped chess set and Ron had taken to playing matches in the evening, mostly with himself but after two nights of watching this, Draco had taken a seat by the black pieces and had begun to play. They didn’t talk, except maybe to curse each other, but their nightly matches drew watchers from the other inhabitants of Shell Cottage.
“The Dark Lord forgives those who have served him most faithfully in the past,” she said contemptuously and Travers inclined his head, conceding the point. “Perhaps your credit is not as good with him as mine is, Travers,” she said and Draco could’ve smacked his forehead. She shouldn’t push it. Travers brushed the comment aside, looking down at the people sitting in the doorways.
“What would we even call them?” Draco asked and Harry grinned, turning to look over his shoulder, his green eyes bright and vivid in the September sunlight.
He had managed to find conversation partners with Dean Thomas and Luna Lovegood. He and Dean had a common appreciation for the fine arts and spent their dinners discussing classical works of Art at length, Draco expressing jealousy that Dean had been able to visit the National Gallery and, specifically, Turner’s
"“Repayment'… a dark wizard must've taken the boys!" Hermione said, mind fitting the dots together. She had one hand tangled in Harry's robes, steadying him where he leaned heavily against her, and her eyes were flicking over the image again and again, a frown on her face. "A Death Eater, probably. Probably lost a son in the War," she continued, and the Aurors were all nodding along with her, a few looking at their relatively newly-elected Minister for Magic with newfound respect.
for her to buy him things for his birthday, just like how there were now Yule presents.
They spent most of the day in the lab, and Harry brewed several potions that Rose was very impressed with. One was almost market-worthy, his version of a Forgetfulness Potion that was more of a nuisance than it usually was. Brewing was calming in a way that Snape's classes usually were, and that one class that Rose had ended up covering. Rose herself was laid back and while she did keep up a lecturer's tone, she also made it fun and enjoyable--just like her classes were. For dinner, Rose taught Harry how to make meatballs--specifically her favorite Classic Italian Meatballs that she usually gets down at the Donata's pizzeria. It was so wonderfully domestic that Harry felt his chest tighten at a glimpse of what he'd been missing. Rose rubbed his shoulder at one point and sprinkled cheese in his hair, and they both laughed.
was what Harry had been yearning for his whole life. A
Harry already knew what his first live moment would be.
She fell into a state of depression. This had happened before, of course, when he used that insult. But, now, after her years at Hogwarts, she felt like she was just … floating. She bought her own flat, furnished it nicely with the money she earned at her job tending to rescued endangered dragons from Bulgaria. Just yesterday she had taken a few thorns out of the wing of a beautiful gray and silver one. He was one of her favorites, mainly because the colors of his scales matched her mood.
After class, there were a few girls and even a couple boys who needed a way to tie their hair back, and Rose taught each of them the spell she used daily. She was unaware of any wizard store that had hair ties but informed them that they could find some at literally any Muggle supermarket or drugstore, and cheaply.
When he opened his eyes, it was to the sight of his aunt crouched over Snape, who had collapsed. "You arsehole, you
"One that eats far too much," Rose joked, and the other students laughed, having seen the cat practically fall into Rose's soup at lunch. "Now, I know you all finished your summer reading, so I want to see just how good your wards are before we get into all the fun jinxes I have for you." Her smirk was mirrored by her Slytherin students. "Two rows, all facing each other, and cast the wards you feel most comfortable with." She watched as the students took stance across from each other and cast their wards, colors ranging from red to purple. "Very good, very good. Now I am going to verbally and nonverbally cast a
“Hey there, fella. You’re getting bigger every day!” Draco said as he picked up the little boy. Ted smiled and bobbed up and down in his arms.
“Go on now. I’m gonna shower.”
Harry had arrived early, so he decided to pay Hermione a visit. She had been working on S.P.E.W lately and it was going surprisingly well. He arrived at her office, where she was leaning against her desk eating an apple and reading some papers, her hair twisted into a bun and held in place with her wand. She looked up from her reading and grinned at Harry.
“I’m serious, Malfoy. We need to have a chat about something that’s been going on in your pub.” Harry answered, playing the honesty card.
Harry looked up from his hood. “You know there’s a difference, Malfoy. You said you’d changed, but you’re working here, in this place that hosts these hatred meetings, and you don’t even care?”
“I don’t know if you recall, but my aunt is travelling and she left me to take care of him until Thursday,” Draco answered. “And then he’s all yours, dumbass.”
The room was full of his aunt’s paintings, his favourite one hanging behind the couch. It was a painting of the sunset at the beach near Dromeda’s house, which she went to almost every single day. She had captured the light perfectly, and there was a tiny silhouette walking on the sand, accompanied by a bigger one holding the tiny one’s hand. It was him and Ted. Every time he looked at that painting, he remembered that specific summer day a few months back. It was a warm day, and they were all celebrating Draco’s 6 month sober mark. It was one of the best days of his life.
“I need a drink,” Draco huffed, standing up. He shrugged off his coat and threw it over the arm of the couch, then walked over to the drink cart. He unscorched a scotch, poured it into a cup, and shot it back.
“There isn’t, Pansy. I’m just tired of all this bullshit. I just want some peace of mind. Which is something you’re making very hard to obtain right now,” Draco said. He peeked back into his room, where Pansy was picking at her nails. The shirt she was wearing had ridden up, showing most of her legs.
Xavier and Amber held hands and disapparated together. Harry always thought they had a thing.
Draco stared at his door for a few moments. So Blaise is fucking Pansy, huh? He thought. I knew it. Blaise had been sneaking off a lot lately and acting weird whenever they mentioned their old school friends. There was one time when they talked about their old Slytherin gang, and Blaise had known quite a lot about what Pansy was up to, yet neither of them knew where Theodore Nott had gone off to. He could be dead for all they knew.
“Potter,” he sneered, and lowered his wand. “What are you doing here?”
As they passed through the desk, Pansy glared at the kid.
“All right, what do you want, little ferret?”
His blonde hair was combed back and shone against the dim light above the door. He was smoking a cigarette and seemed pretty immersed in thought. Harry decided he couldn’t wait any longer, so he stood up.
“Yeah, what about them?”
“Ginny,” he said. The girl looked up from her book. “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but thank you for being a friend these past months. You surprised me, I never expected you to be so full of depth and feelings. I guess I never expect that of anyone. But still. Thank you.”
He finished his usual morning tea with Blaise in silence. Their early mornings usually went like that, sitting in silence and sipping tea. Draco washed his cup, grabbed his dark green trench coat, said goodbye to his roommate and disapparated.
“Yeah, and the Ministry didn’t give them enough support after the war. So many kids have been orphaned, their parents killed off, and are now forced to live under terrible conditions,” Weasley said.
“Please cover yourself. I can’t do this right now,” he said.
“Great. Head down to the Ministry on Monday,” Harry answered. Malfoy hesitated, as if he were going to object, but didn’t say anything. He nodded at Harry, who turned around and left through the small red door.
“Fine. Enlighten me.”
“That’s great, Xavier, thanks,” said Harry. “Anyone else want to report anything?”
The meeting extended for more than two hours, in which Pansy did most of the talking. According to Pansy, that bloke at the Dragonfire Pub was one of the Spectre’s emissaries, and he was indeed just having a few drinks with his ‘friends’. In the end, they had a good picture of the group, and what they knew was:
“Ugh. You’ll trust that tosser with a kid? Sorry Drom, but that idiot Potter would most likely forget there’s a baby in the house to take care of.”
“Oh. I’m sorry,” Draco said, and he really meant it. During their talks in the greenhouse, he had noticed how much Ginny liked Luna compared to other people she had hooked up with.
Together, they walked up to the desk for inspection. As they crossed the enormous hearth-filled hallway, heads turned and people whispered about their small group.
Over the years, Draco had forced himself to do as many things as possible as to not let his mind slip into the place he dreaded. So days like this, lazy Sundays with nothing much to do, were the worst for him. Those days were when he noticed how utterly alone he was. He had always been alone. As a child, his father would be off sucking up to some high ranking officer in the Ministry, and his mother would always be busy with running the Manor. So that left him no one to play, since his parents never let him play with the muggle neighbours, always forcing into him the idea that it was better to be alone than in the company of muggles.
He banged his head softly against the threshold, trying to distract his thoughts from where he knew was easy falling into. The guilt ate him up from the inside, his chest aching at the memories of everything he had done. Voldemort had been strong and backed by his supporters, but if Draco had never gotten into that, would it have made a difference?
They appeared in Harry’s backyard. Since Godric’s Hollow was a neighbourhood with both wizards and muggles, they had to be careful when apparating. The garden was filled with weeds, and the rose bushes Andromeda had planted in the summer were dying. Honestly, between his job, exercising and avoiding important tasks, Harry had no energy to take care of his garden.
“And? What did you say?”
"It's a type of Mind magic, I think. My mum's real good at it, which means she's a
Harry laughed. "I haven't got a clue who it is." Then a thought struck him. "It must've been Rose who asked Madam Pomfrey to check me out. She gave me nutrition potions to include in my meals and some ointment for scars."
So Harry smiled thinly and lowered the Cloak, folding it and putting it to the side for the moment. He could bring it up to Hermione and Blaise and Draco later. For now, he would enjoy his first real Christmas and first-ever Yule with his aunt.
You are my
"The Marauders?" Harry asked.
"Your aunt and Snape have been friends for a very long time, Haythim," the man said quietly, watching the other two just as intensely as Harry was. "And it slowly turned into love, though neither one of them will admit it. I thought they'd kill each other Fifth year, but they didn't. Came pretty close, though."
Rose's eyes hardened to steel. "Yes, Poppy. When I gathered him from his
"Yeah, I don't know. Second and Third years get three days a week, and the Second years kind of overlap the First. I've talked to the Headmaster about it, but nothing's changed." She waved her hand in a way that showed her confusion and frustration. "You can always read through the whole book if you feel like it's not enough, and don't hesitate to see me after class."
"He said to get my uniform …?" Harry trailed, scratching his head. Rose hummed.
magic, though it was very clever to use its own club, Mr. Malfoy."
Hagrid took them to the Leaky Cauldron, which was empty. Harry was quiet the rest of the way, and Rose worried about him. She knew it was a lot to take in if one had not been raised in the Wizarding World, she experienced it herself; in fact, her sister had been the one who was furiously excited, running and jumping around when they got their school supplies, and Rose had been quiet, just as Harry was now. As they sat down to eat, as there was time before the train left, Hagrid voiced Rose's thoughts.
Remus' gift was one Harry recognized immediately. The smell was potent enough that Harry likened it to the potion Rose had made earlier that day. The color was a burnt orange and there was a set of twelve in the box. Remus smiled very tiredly at his aunt and insisted in a small voice, "You didn't have to do this."
"What's your name?" Harry asked in a neutral tone, though he really didn't like how the ginger was talking to his friend.
"It's really interesting. I was hoping you could help me learn some of them, if you have time?"
"My best were obviously O+ Defense and Potions, and Lils' was Charms. James had dual
Harry shrugged off his cloak and set it on another stool the room conjured for them, watching in amazement, and kneeled easily. Severus had a little more trouble, and sat gingerly down with most of his weight on his right leg. Rose watched him intently.
for me without my knowledge or consent. I don't need one, nor have I ever mentioned needing one." At this Rose picked her head up from her temporarily-tamed nest of wild curls. "Did I?"
Sighing again, Rose popped a few bones as tension left her shoulders. If she could get Remus to visit over the Winter break, then the three of them could spend a wonderful Yule together. She stroked the pink stones around her neck and thought briefly of her sister before shaking her head and turning to her vanity and closet. Waving her wand, a few robes and dresses flew out and awaited Rose's judgement. After thinking a moment, Rose picked a sleek black dress that ended at her calves. She floated it over next to her vanity and stuck it there before sending the others back into the closet. The dress she chose was slightly sheer and had three roses embroidered at the bottom, had a purple belt around the middle, long sheer sleeves, and a halter top with a few Jet crystals sewn into the front. Rose picked out a pair of thigh-length purple boots that fit like stockings and had thin heels to go along.
“I thought about it, and I think it’s best for Ted to stay here with you. Blaise can help you around,” she said, putting the kid down and letting him wander around. He was about to slam his head on the coffee table when Draco picked him up.
“Yeah…” Harry said.
“Why?”
“You don’t know the lengths people will go for money,” Ron said, scowling. He had never liked Peter.
Once she was done saying all the facts, Granger turned to the three Slytherins.
“Well, my friend has had past experiences with boys, but buried it deep since he knew it wouldn’t please his prejudiced parents. So he got together with a girl, and he liked it, a lot. Then he met this boy, and apparently he’s incredibly irresistible, but since he had already decided he liked girls, he doesn’t understand what’s going on. So he’s been trying to make himself forget the boy by having sex with the girl like a fucking bunny, but he still can’t get him off his mind.” Draco said, then took a drag on his cigarette.
Josh nodded, gulping down. He turned around to call a messenger when Potter appeared at the desk.
“I was studying at the university library one day when Pansy suddenly appeared. She told me she had been looking for me and that she needed my help. Her aunt, in her anger for losing the war, had been meeting up with some weird folks who wanted to restore the pureblood supremacy, Voldemort or not. At the time, I didn’t think much of it. Pansy had infiltrated herself into the group to find out what they were on about, and since she didn’t know anyone else to report to, she went looking for me. She didn’t know what side you would be playing on since you hadn’t talked in years. So we started working together, and we found out some juicy things. That’s why Pansy’s here. I told her about Potter approaching you and how you’re going to the Auror Department tomorrow.”
He remembered the day he approached her as if it were yesterday.
Draco apparated into the back room of the pub, where employees kept their things and took their breaks. He shrugged off his mossy green trench coat, then took off his jumper, and carefully put it in his locker so they wouldn’t get wrinkled. He fixed his white collar, smoothed out his hair and headed inside. It was a Saturday, so the place was quite crowded. The walls of the pub were painted dark green, and for seating they had burgundy lounge armchairs in groups of three or four with low tables made of mahogany in the middle of them. The bar consisted of the same wood, with stools made of the same material from the armchairs standing in front of the bar, for the loners or those weirdos who liked to talk to the bartender all night.
Draco waited a few minutes then walked to the greenhouse, where Ginny was sitting on one of the long worktables, her legs crossed and her hair up in a ponytail. He sat on the table opposite of hers so they were facing each other.
“Oh, okay. Hold on, let me just grab my things,” Hermione said, and disappeared behind the door. The boys waited outside, chatting. She came back in less than a minute.
“Bye, Crookshanks! I’ll be back soon!” she yelled, and closed the door behind her. She had grabbed a trench coat and pulled on a pair of fuzzy, soft boots. The three held hands and disapparated.
Malfoy watched as Harry took a sip. It was strong, but the smoked taste was marvelous. Harry nodded at Draco in approval.
i loved writing this chapter and i hope you guys love reading it too :)
Potter appeared a few minutes later, Weasley and the Granger girl in tow. The three took a seat across from them, and Xavier stayed standing up beside the now closed door.
Draco nodded. He eyed his friend and the little snake beside him. He thought that if they were going to work together, he’d probably have to trust her.
Draco headed over to their table, his nose held high and his back straight.
“Nothing. Just doing the right thing.”
“Why do we have to wait? Couldn’t we just barge in?” Another Auror called Peter asked.
“Hey, I didn’t call you any names now,” Draco said.
“Oh. You’re right,” Draco said, running a hand through his hair.
“You’re so fucking hammered you won’t even remember this. Come on, let’s go,” Tom dragged Draco to the staff room to grab his things, then apparated them to Draco’s apartment.
“Fucking hell, Malfoy. I can’t leave you like this,” Tom said. “Come on, I’ll apparate you home.”
“Hey, aren’t you Lucius’ kid? What on earth are you doing at this dead end job?” One of them said, his accent showing that he wasn’t british. He had long black hair tied into a low ponytail, a long nose and thin lips etched into a scowl. The man’s hands were full of different family rings, yet Draco couldn’t recognise which one he was from.
It took Draco a few moments to process the information. On one side, he found it hard to believe that Pansy would infiltrate herself into the group for the sake of the greater good, but at the same time, Draco had changed too. And Pansy had never lowered herself to Draco’s level. She was just lost at the time and found her comfort in people who thought outside the good-bad division of the world.
“Stop fucking whining, you sad sob,” Blaise said as he grabbed a cup of water and handed it to Draco. “First of all, I have no idea what you’re talking about. You know why? Because you never tell me shit. We sit in silence all the fucking time, and you think it’s because of me, but you’re the one who never opens his mouth about shit.”
“Actually, I did. While you were in the pub, I walked around and heard a couple of people talking about how Aurors have been keeping an eye on the place. I pretended I was annoyed with that and started making conversation with them,” Xavier paused, taking a sip of water. “They said they don’t really know anything about those purebloods, and that all they know is that they never see them coming in or out, so they probably use the fireplace or apparate. Also, they told me the owner lives right above the place.”
“Yeah, yeah. I know,” Draco slurred.
“Because we’re gonna be late for the meeting,” Hermione said. “Come on.”
“No, you daddy’s money helps you pay the bills,” Andromeda answered, turning around to face him. Her brows were furrowed, and her chocolate eyes were staring right into his. “We both know you stay there to keep yourself distracted. Drinking won’t solve your problems, Draco.”
“Fine. I believe you. What now?”
“I just know they’re up to something, and I don’t like it. Keep an eye on ‘em for me, will you?” Tom said.
“Assholes,” Blaise said, grinding his teeth.
Harry took a long, hot shower to get himself ready for the day. He had a shift later at night, guarding a pub that seemed to be hosting some anti-muggleborn group. You see, after the war ended, despite not having sat his N.E.W.T. exams, Harry got a job as an Auror, together with Ron. It had been two years, and things had been great. They both were high-ranking officers given their experience with dark wizards, and were very well respected within the Ministry. Hermione was working in two different departments (of course she was), in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures and the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. So, in the end, the trio had stayed together and things were looking up.
They both chuckled as Ron grabbed Harry’s shoulder and apparated them onto Hermione’s front door. She lived in a cozy studio downtown that smelled of green tea and was filled with plants. They knocked on her door and waited. Hermione appeared a few seconds later, wearing a Gryffindor jumper and leggings. Her hair was tied in a messy ponytail. She smiled at them and invited them in.
“This place isn’t baby proofed,” he said as he fixed Ted’s jumper.
“Go ahead then. Oh, one second,” she turned to the quill. “Pansy Parkinson’s statement.”
Ted and Draco played for a little while, which consisted of Draco making little sparks shoot from his wand, which the kid found absolutely hilarious. Then, Andromeda asked for help with some redecorating, and he set out upstairs to help.
“I’ll go on Monday, since you have until Thursday off. I think I’ll stay there until next Monday, so Harry can come stay when you can’t,” she answered.
“Right,” Draco said, and stood up. “I’m gonna make myself my hangover cure, and would like to be left alone. Excuse me.”
“She says I have way too many whatever creatures hanging around my head, and that it was messing with her, and she couldn’t stand it anymore. I don’t even know what that means, but yeah.”
Draco removed his wand from Frederick’s neck and wiped it against his trousers to clean off the sweat. Draco fixed his hair and shirt and looked at the sad fat man.
“Malfoy said he’d cooperate,” Harry said, shrugging off his cloak. That firewhiskey was strong and was already going up to his head. “Xavier, did you hear anything?”
After drinking his second cup, Draco headed back into his room. The door to Blaise’s was shut so he could only guess what those two were doing inside. Draco decided he had some cleaning up to do, so he went into frenzy mode as he arranged his room.
“Since you seem to know my father so well, you’re aware of the power the Malfoy name holds,” Draco said, picking at his nails. “So I’d be more careful with my words, even more now that my Auror friends have been patrolling the alley, and one word from me and this little playdate of yours is over.”
Theo had always been around them, since he was a Slytherin and Slytherins usually stuck together, but the trio shifted to a quartet after Theo walked in on the three in the middle of a prank on first year Hufflepuffs and decided to join. From there, they became the hottest group of Hogwarts. Blaise, who lit up a room with his charm and smiles, Pansy with her sharp features and unfiltered mouth (which Draco loved at the time), Theo with his dark hair, scruffy look and the sexiest pair of hands Draco had ever seen, and then there was Draco himself, with his cold smile, stormy eyes and amazing taste in fashion.
“We don’t look like ourselves, and there’s no one around, Hermione. Come on, we’ll be fine,” Potter said soothingly and Granger looked a bit fraught but nodded, casting an eye over where she suspected Draco would be standing. He came up behind them and whispered.
“I’d kill him all over again,” Harry said into Draco’s neck and they swayed on the spot for a second.
“It’s the right thing to do,” he said into the quiet expectation that filled the room and Harry’s smile was full of relief.
printed that detraction of her article over the summer. ‘
"I know. Do you think you can help?" she asked and Malfoy looked over to the image of pillar, and nodded.
“Where did you find this sword?” she repeated. The sword rocked to and fro in her grip. “Snape sent it to my vault in Gringotts!” she shrieked and Draco winced.
“These Wandless haven’t disturbed you, have they?” he asked with a sneer, and Hermione waved a hand.
He was still tall, taller than Harry had remembered, but the boyishness of his face was gone, leaving his face with a defined jaw and high sweeping cheekbones. His hair was shorter than Harry had remembered, cut for practicality rather than style. His clothes were an odd mix between muggle and wizard - dragonhide boots with a Barbour waxed jacket. Harry felt a bit faint at the sight of him.
“Look at this, it's an Abbott, could be some long lost relation of Hannah’s!” he said aloud and Granger hissed at him.
The night Granger had found him. Entering the clearing through the wards and seeing Potter sat there, alive and well, and the hope that rose within Draco in that moment. He lifted his wand, his eyes still closed, and tried again.
It wasn’t comfortable, by any means, Draco would reflect after. The bunched t-shirt under his head did little to cushion it as he pressed it to the floor when his back arched, he had a bruise on his hip after rolling over, and his knees had lines from the tiles underneath them as Harry leaned over him, breathing heavily between his shoulder blades.
“We put up wards. No one can find us with them, or at least that’s what Hermione says,” Potter explained and Draco made a noise of acknowledgement in the back of his throat. They fell into silence again.
Draco held himself still. This was what he had wanted after all, for years. For Harry Potter to be dead and the Dark Lord to lead the wizarding world into a golden age of blood purity.
Potter reappeared a few minutes later, Hermione following him and she gave Draco a small smile.
"Why are they my sons when they're causing you problems?" he asked and Harry shrugged, a small smile creeping on to his forced poker face. Draco's face turned a bit worried, and he nibble on a corner of the toast he held in his hand. He didn't look to have much appetite, but then, neither did Harry. "You don't think they're anxious about today, do you?" he asked, and Harry nodded slowly.
He remembered how he tightened his hold on his wand to stop himself from falling to his knees and begging for it. His arm still shook. “No, you can’t. Nobody can. He told me to do it or he’ll kill me. I’ve got to do it,” he repeated it like a mantra –
“Yes, I dare! I know things you don’t know, Tom Riddle. I know lots of important things that you don’t. Want to hear some, before you make another big mistake?” Harry asked and they still moved. Draco’s heart was in his throat still, pounding away, as Harry passed him again. Draco was desperate to touch him, to know that he was truly alive and wasn’t some sort of ghost brought back one final time to save them.
"Don't follow me in," he told them, his voice croaking oddly, "If you try to step through that glass, it will cut you to ribbons. If the frame turns silver, it means someone has died inside… You might have to wait for me to come out. It depends how far in they are. If I don't come back out within the hour, well - I won't be coming back," he told them and Hermione gave a little hiccup of a sob behind Harry. Draco turned to face him once again, looked as though he were about to say something but thought better of it, and then turned to face the mirror.
“I was about to call him!” he said, sounding almost petulant. Draco dared a glance back to see he was holding onto Bellatrix’s arm tightly, preventing her from touching her Mark which stood out starkly on the pale skin of her forearm. “I shall summon him, Bella, Potter has been brought to my house and it is therefore upon my authority–”
They pulled him through the hallway and Draco’s mind raced. Where were they taking him? What did the Dark Lord need from him? Draco couldn’t even guess at this point. They guided him roughly down the Stone Stairs and into the dining room, where they dropped him to the floor in an undignified heap.
"I must admit, I haven't seen them. Truthfully, I have no idea where they might be. My reach is not as far as it used to be," he said, looking over at them both. Harry visibly deflated. "Tell me what you know, Harry, and I will listen," Dumbledore offered, and Harry took his hand away from his mouth to explain what had happened.
The Patronus was more substantial this time, and it hovered for a moment before melting away again. Draco cursed and resisted the urge to throw his wand. He stomped over to the rear wall and leaned into the alcove carved there, trying not to pout.
“Sounds like The Wailing Banshees,” he said and Potter gave him a blank look. Draco shrugged. “They’re a band. This is a good one actually,” he said and he hummed along to the lyrics. He swayed a little in time and Granger stood from the armchair and offered her hand. With a smile, Draco took it and pulled her closer to him, taking her other hand in his and rocking them in time to the song. Potter leaned against the wireless and watched them with a smile on his face as they turned in the space. Granger slipped out of Draco’s grasp and draped her arms across Potter’s shoulders, pulling him into the space as Draco backed away. He gave her another affectionate look and Draco watched, smile a little tight at the edges for reasons he didn’t want to think about, as they danced together, Potter turning her in a spin under his arm and then letting her go.
“I think so,” he whispered to her and she gave him a genuine smile.
“-stone maze, Mummy?” the little girl said, barely above her father’s knee in height. Her father adjusted the baby straddling his shoulders as her Mother took her hand.
“Are you sure? Quite sure?” Bellatrix asked, her voice tremulous.
Creevey, McGonagall had called him. He had tried to hide behind a group of seventh-years, what seemed like years ago. He was dead now too, so small compared to the others.
Malfoy Manor, his childhood home, began to disappear from around him, turning to darkness as Greyback roared in fury and Bellatrix flung her knife forward, a blur of silver heading towards the spot where they had been standing, his parents bursting into the room with identical looks of horror and betrayal as the light faded and then they were gone.
"And who's fault is that?" he retorted and Harry clenched his fists.
“How did he die?” he asked and she frowned. Her hair was beginning to escape the chignon it had been in all day and tendrils fell around her face, framing it. He could see then, beyond the exhaustion and the fear, the young woman she had once been.
They watched in absolute silence as the figure came nearer. Draco realised after it passed a brightly lit window that it was a woman, though her face was obscured by the darkness around them. He half-expected her to turn into any one of the cottages she walked past but she didn’t, and with a sense of dread, he realised she was coming straight for them. Granger reached around Draco and poked Potter in the side, but he didn’t yelp. They exchanged significant looks and Draco didn’t need to be included in the conversation to know what they were saying.
Draco had been embraced by the wider Weasley family as well. They spent their Christmases with them, were included as ‘Uncle Harry’ and ‘Uncle Draco’ and had vowed to Molly Weasley that they would keep her various grandchildren out of trouble (or as much as was possible to do so). He was even gifted with a new Weasley jumper every year, which Ron had declared as good as an adoption.
“Welcome, students, to another year at Hogwarts,” Snape intoned over the hall, his voice lacking the warmth that Dumbledore’s always held. Draco shivered next to Pansy. “There have been a few,
“Please – please, My Lord,” Rowle gasped and the Dark Lord stepped forward.
“Dobby,” Harry said quietly, surprised at the painful lump that suddenly welled in his throat. Draco nodded, looking downcast.
“I thought–” he tried to say around heaving sobs. Potter had slipped from his chair and was crouched in front of him now, hands braced on Draco’s knees, trying to comfort him. Draco wiped his nose on the back of his jumper and coughed, trying to speak again. “I thought that maybe, deep down, they were good people actually. That they were just scared and were following along because they didn’t know what to do. But my mum–” Another wave of sobs came over him and he had to close his eyes, ducking his head down. “My mum said Hermione was ‘
“Ron! Ron!” she screamed and there was an answering yell. She sagged a little as Draco dragged her to her feet. She was no sooner upright than she was barging down the hall, wand in front of her, eyes ablaze. Draco followed, and Harry caught his eye.
“You have been very brave, Draco,” Dumbledore said and Draco shook his head.
“-COMPLETE-”
“Yes. Where are you? Will you let me help?” he asked but Potter was turning his attention back to the Dark Mark on Draco’s arm. He took Draco’s arm by the wrist and lifted it, bending over to look more closely at the Dark Mark.
“I didn’t want it to be like this,” he murmured and Draco marked his place in the book with a finger. Potter picked at some blades of grass, avoiding his gaze. “I wanted today to mean something. To tell us where to go next. But we’re just –” and he tore one of the blades in two. “- going in circles, aren’t we?” he asked, turning his gaze to Draco, who sighed.
a celebration,” Draco pointed out and Potter smiled at him, leaning closer to peck at his lips. Around them, the table suddenly went silent. Potter, looking like a deer caught in wandlight, sat back in his chair and opened and closed his mouth a few times before Draco rolled his eyes.
’ indeed,” a fifth-year scoffed. His father had been sitting at Draco’s dining table when Burbage had been killed. He clearly hadn’t been told.
“What? Oh, oh yeah!” he said and McGonagall rolled her eyes and waved her hands in a shooing motion.
“Well, they don’t show the Dark Lord proper respect, so the name’s been Tabooed. A few Order members have been tracked that way. We’ll see. Bind them up with the other two prisoners –” and then Greyback turned to Draco with a smirk. “The Malfoy brat too,” he added and Draco felt his arms being grabbed and twisted behind his back before he could protest. He was dragged a little way aways and forced into a sitting position before being bound back-to-back with some of the others. Eventually the movement stopped and Draco heard whoever had bound them up walk away.
“It’s a cat – or a bird. If it was a Death Eater, we’d be dead by now,” he said and Draco had to agree with him. “But let’s get out of here, and we can get back under the cloak,” he said and Granger nodded. They set off again towards the gate, Draco following in Potter’s tracks until they slipped out of the kissing gate and back onto the icy pavement. Draco reached out and took Granger’s sleeve in one hand and slipped the cloak over her before doing the same to Potter on his other side.
’. Draco swallowed the bile that had risen in his throat.
The dream was warm again, and soothing on his arm. He felt something brushing it softly and opened his eyes to Potter knelt over him, lightly touching his forearm where the Dark Mark was livid against his skin.
“Unfortunately it’s a precaution. Especially… well, straight after the battle, my Mother was worried that someone would try and hurt us. She put up the wards just in case and hasn’t taken them down since,” he said and Harry felt a pang of sympathy. Draco hung back a little and gestured to the other armchair that was opposite the one he had been sitting in. “Take a seat. Would you like some tea?” he asked, and Harry nodded, shucking his coat and scarf and draping them across the back of the armchair, slumping down into the warm cushions. Draco pulled a chord next to the fireplace and there was a
Yes, he was scared of the Dark Lord. Draco’s failure at the end of the last school year had failed to please him, and he made sure Draco knew it. Draco was made to know it – until his throat was raw from screaming, and his eyes were bloodshot from burst vessels, and his muscles quivered and ached.
“He does think you’re capable of change,” Hermione called out to him and Draco looked over his shoulder at her. She gave him a sheepish smile. “Harry, that is. He does think you’ve changed,” and he nodded and left the tent, stepping into the cold air.
“Oh, he dreamed of it, but he knew more than you, knew enough not to do what you’ve done.”
After, Dumbledore leaned back in Madam Hilda's chair and looked like he was lost deep in thought. Malfoy made him and Harry cups of tea from the still-warm teapot that Belinda had brought in while Dumbledore thought, and they both waited with baited breath.
. It was the light they shone on those about to go in front of the Wizengamot, to ensure they were truthful.
“You saw the what?” she asked sharply and Harry piped up then.
Harry was gone.
“Her name is on a list of ‘Muggle-borns of Interest’ in the
“I can’t see anything,” he whispered and Potter spoke at the same time.
“It’s true. I Disarmed Dumbledore that night on the Astronomy tower. And in turn, Potter Disarmed me, when I joined him and Granger in November,” he explained. His mother pressed one trembling hand to her mouth as Draco perched on the edge of the table in front of them. The elves had gone back to the kitchens after waging war and there were platters of sandwiches and flagons of pumpkin juice and mead lining the tables now. He couldn’t bring himself to eat, not just yet.
“Are you alright?” he asked and the goblin moaned but didn’t say anything. He could hear around him the soft roll of waves and the air smelt strongly of salt. He blinked into the darkness, unable to see anyone nearby. “HELLO!” he called and there was an answering cry a little way away. And then he heard Potter yell “DOBBY!” and Draco whipped his head around to see Potter running towards where the elf stood, swaying in the sea breeze. The moon overhead caught the light of something silver in the elf’s chest and it stole Draco’s breath.
“Good girl!” Aberforth shouted as he ran past, a small group of students on his heels. “They look like they might be breaching the Northern Battlements, they’ve brought giants of their own!”
“No, I mean we should tell them to get out. We don’t want any more Dobbys, do we? We can’t order them to die for us-”
“Hi,” came one voice and then “Evening, River,” came another. Weasley turned around again.
“Do you think that Peverell bloke had anything to do with this? The one who’s buried in Godric’s Hollow?” Potter asked, swiftling changing the subject, and Hermione sighed.
“We’d heard,” he said and Draco sighed. “I thought you’d be pleased. He’s your favourite teacher, isn’t he?” he asked and Draco quirked an eyebrow at him.
When they arrived at the DMLE, the Auror department was subdued enough that it made Harry nervous. Mulligan had looked up from her cubicle and given him a half-smile, but had turned back to her paperwork before Harry could approach her. Behind him, Malfoy shifted uneasily, and Harry remembered that he had spent a lot of time around Aurors after the Battle of Hogwarts, and not always for good reasons. They skirted around the cubicles and headed towards the bullpen and Harry's office, encountering Thompson along the way, a mug of coffee in his hand and a roll of parchment in the other. Harry wanted to knock the mug straight out of his hand but restrained himself.
“It is!” Greyback rasped and Draco felt all the fight leave him at once. “We’ve caught Potter!” Greyback crowed and around them the Snatchers cheered and whooped. Draco ducked his head down and tried not to cry. Next to him, Dean Thomas shuffled and knocked their shoulders together. He looked up and Dean gave him a wide-eyed look, as if to say ‘Do something!’. Draco cleared his throat.
“He loved you,” Hermione whispered across the void between them and Potter slumped as though winded. “I
“Is it?” he asked and Draco had to think as well. All this time away from others had made him lose all sense of the day. Granger’s eyes were still on the church and the little churchyard next to it.
“A goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is believed that Muggle-born Dean Thomas and a second goblin, both believed to have been travelling with Tonks, Cresswell and Gornuk, may have escaped. If Dean is listening, or if anyone has any knowledge of his whereabouts, his parents and sisters are desperate for news,” and Draco thought of Dean. While he had always felt the same indifference towards the Gryffindor that all Slytherins felt, he had admired Thomas’ art skills, albeit quietly. His hand drawn Lion banners were often the first thing that Draco saw on the Quidditch pitch, and he could only imagine how it bolstered the team. In the Great Hall, Thomas had often been smiling and laughing with Seamus Finnigan, his laughter loud enough to carry across the vaulted space. It had previously annoyed Draco and now he wondered if he would ever hear it again.
,” Travers explained delicately. Hermione snorted derisively, as if dismissing this gossip entirely.
“He chose his own manner of dying, chose it months before he died, arrange the whole thing with the man you thought was your servant,”
Wychwood. Oxfordshire.
“No one,” Harry said confidently, and Dumbledore nodded once, satisfied. “I’m going to keep Ignotus’ present, though,” Harry added and Dumbledore smiled. Draco huffed a laugh and Harry glanced back over his shoulder at him, his eyes catching the light and sparkling.
“You still have a place here,” she told him quietly and Draco swallowed around the lump that had suddenly formed in his throat. “You’ve been very helpful these last few weeks. Harry and I are both grateful,” she added and Draco ducked his head, clearing his throat. Hermione studied him for a little while as he scratched patterns into the canvas flooring. “You’re in love with Harry, aren’t you?” she asked and he jerked his head up, nearly headbutting her in the process. He gave the bunk bed another glance, but could not find it in himself to deny it.
He lay in the dark as dawn began to creep over the estate, but he didn’t go back to sleep. He listened to the noise outside and pushed himself up onto his elbows when two Death Eaters stopped to talk just outside his room.
“Everything. Your Aunt, your home, your parents–” he said and Draco felt his throat constrict.
Harry let himself be led away, feeling the fight leave his body. He suddenly felt like crying.
“I think Harry’s right,” Hermione said, the first time she had spoken in the office. She was looking at the portraits surrounding them with interest, though there were dark smudges under her eyes. All eyes then turned to Draco and he hesitated for just a second, and then caught Harry’s gaze.
“Ready?” she whispered and he squeezed her hand and they turned, stepping into that sucking blackness before landing in a new clearing.
“The Death Eaters are at your house?” he asked and Draco nodded. He edged closer until he was standing by the foot of the bed, leaning against one of the bedposts.
Draco ducked and weaved and timed his curses with Neville so that Fenrir never got a moment to stop, never got to reply. Some time during the fight, Ron had joined in as a herd of house-elves stormed past, their little voices raised in a battle cry. Fenrir snarled and snapped and swiped at them with his claw-like nails until Draco remembered a spell that he had seen in one of his father’s books before.
“Have you ever performed the Cruciatus Curse, Draco?” the Dark Lord asked, his voice high and taking on an edge that Draco always hoped to never hear again. He swallowed and kept his eyes trained on the slate tiles beneath him. He studied their topography while his mind screamed at him.
The War Memorial had transformed as they had approached it, transforming from an obelisk covered in names to a new statue. A man with untidy hair and glasses, a woman with long hair and a kind, pretty face and a baby boy sitting on his mother’s knee. Snow was dusted over their heads and Potter drew closer, his mouth open. Draco dropped his hand and edged closer for a look himself.
Draco found his eyes sting with tears at that, and Harry reached out and took his hand, lacing their fingers together. He did not stop talking though, not until they reached where Harry had been leading them.
“You dare–?” Voldemort shrieked again, sounding deeply offended.
“Mother was going to take me shopping in Paris,” Blaise said mournfully, glancing over his shoulder – behind them, Crabbe and Goyle Senior kept watch, walking a few steps behind. Draco had been sent out into the world with minders, and he was fully cognisant of this. One toe out of line and he would be shut up in the Manor again for the last few weeks of summer. The trip was a reward for his… compliance when it came to the Rowle
“Harry Potter,” she called, and Harry placed Draco’s mug on the floor next to his own and stood. Hermione reached up to squeeze his hand and gave him an encouraging smile, and Harry gave her a shaky one in return, his heart thundering in his chest.
“I suppose we’ll find out next week,” he said and Harry smiled. He felt drained, both emotionally and mentally, but he was pleased to see Draco, despite the awkwardness he had felt earlier.
“Not until tomorrow morning,” he said and Hermione nodded, reaching out and looping her arm through his.
“How dare you, you dirty little elf! How dare you defy your Masters!”
They both watched him for a few silent minutes. Granger took a step closer to Draco and leaned heavily against his side – Draco wrapped an arm around her and brought her in close and then she just pressed her face into his shoulder and cried. After a minute she stepped back, sniffling and rubbing at her face.
“It isn’t! It isn’t me!” she protested, but the seed of doubt was already planted and her protests had sealed the deal. Greyback stood, towering over the group and Draco turned his face away.
“Severus,” Mother said and her voice, quiet though it was, cut through the noise of their fellow diners. Snape wound his way to her and she offered him a hand, which he lightly took in his own. “Good of you to come. Can I get you a glass of anything?” she offered and Snape demurred.
“The stag! It’s Potters’!!” one of them crowed while another said, “Who does that ruddy bird belong to?” and there were murmurs of confusion as the search parties returned to the Three Broomsticks. The owl soared past them, straight at the Dementors which fell back and the air turned warm again as the owl and stag turned into silver mist and then disappeared.
“Mother,” he started and she hummed and looked up at him, her face serene. This evening of peace was so like it had been before the invasion that it soothed them both, and he smiled at her. “Do you know anything about your cousin Regulus?” he asked and she frowned.
! Someone grab him!”
He studied it, wondering whether it was built with any purpose. He had little experience with mazes – there was a small pleasure maze built on the edge of the Italian garden at the Manor, which was made with many convenient alcoves along the way to the centre, and in the middle a small statue of Eros, the Greek God of Love, hung as though in mid-flight, his bow aloft and his wings outstretched. The maze had been commissioned by Draco’s Great-Great-Grandfather Linus, and his portrait loved to tell stories of his escapades in the maze.
“We’ll get rewarded if we bring you in. You’re a traitor, Draco,” he said and Draco nodded.
Fleur called for everyone to come sit and they all took their places, sat elbow-to-elbow. There was a low murmur of conversation but everyone was looking at Fleur, who was merely playing with her food, glancing up at the window every few minutes. Her face broke into a relieved smile as Bill reappeared at the front door, looking windswept from the storm rolling in outside.
“I never thought you would be,” he said quietly. Draco sniffed and lowered his arm, the train turning a corner and King’s Cross out of sight now. “If you want children, let’s do it. I think a child could do worse than us for parents,” Harry said with a shrug, pulling up the window and turning to walk to the teacher’s carriage at the front of the train. Draco followed, smiling at students as they went, listening to the rumble of excited chatter as another year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry began.
"Let me know, please… If you hear a-anything," he said and Hermione nodded, moving to go and take his spot on the sofa next to Luna. Harry felt untethered all of a sudden, like a ship come away from its mooring, until he turned to Malfoy, who looked as lost as he felt.
“Maybe you can be the Regulus of our generation. Maybe you can keep secrets,” he said, almost wistfully, and then Draco woke up.
Once they were all sat down, the Fellow on the dias cleared his throat.
“Start with Rowle, Draco,” the Dark Lord commanded and Draco screwed his eyes shut, holding his wand tightly as if it were a lifeline. “NOW, Draco,” the Dark Lord shrieked and Draco pointed his wand at Rowle.
"Malfoy. Nice of you to help," he replied, and they stared at each other coolly for a few seconds. Belinda eyed the three of them, a little confused, for a minute and then cleared her throat.
“He’s digging a grave. For Dobby,” he added and Draco’s eyes stung with tears again. Bill gave him a once-over. “You’re Lucius Malfoy’s son, aren’t you?” he asked and Draco let out a wet-sounding laugh.
the day Hermione had walked him through the wards around their camp. His wand had left his hand and been taken by Harry. Harry
be a kidnapping?!" Harry said incredulously. Thompson looked suitably worried for his own safety. "Find. My. Sons," Harry ground out, aware of the sound of chairs scraping back from desks and other Aurors in the room standing, reaching for their wands. Thompson's eyes were panicked.
The room was filled with nooks and crannies for secreting things away. He would have to search them all individually. As a particularly precocious twelve-year-old, he’d spent the Christmas holidays in his second year cataloging them, and he ran through the list mentally, darting to and fro around the room.
Draco lay back down and tried to calm his breathing. They knew where Potter was, but they couldn’t get to him. That was enough.
“D’you mind if I stay here a moment?” Potter asked and Dean sidled past Draco to pat him on the back and they all slipped away, leaving Draco with Potter. Potter gave him a glance and then looked back down at the freshly covered grave. “You too, Draco,” he said quietly and though he was hurt, Draco nodded and turned away, heading back for the cottage. He gave a quick glance back to see Potter knelt over the grave, working on something that Draco could not see.
“Who did this?” Harry asked darkly and Draco turned to look at him. He looked murderous. His eyes were blazing, his jaw clenched so hard that a vein had popped in his temple. He looked like he was about to self-combust.
Potter was a good few paces ahead of him but paused and turned around to wait for Draco while he caught up. They walked together down to the lake and Draco used his wand to cast obscuring charms around them as they settled down on the bank, the grass and earth abruptly dropping off into water .
He blinked and there Potter was, standing alone in a sea of darkness. He looked up as Draco appeared, and looked a little relieved. The dream was like before, heavy and warm around him, like stepping into a welcoming embrace. Draco longed to sink into it, but Potter kept him anchored there.
“You need to let him in, Harry,” Hermione said softly into the semi-darkness. She wiped her eyes on the cuff of her torn and singed sleeve as she spoke. “We need to find out where You-Know-” – she stopped and shook herself – “-Where Voldemort is, because he’ll be with the snake. Do it, Harry – let him in!” she told him and Draco’s hands tightened where they were holding onto Harry’s arms.
, per se. There’s a group of them that run as a company, it’s House Elf owned and operated. Mipsy comes in on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings and makes breakfast, does a light clean and some laundry, and gets paid 3 galleons an hour,” she said firmly and Harry raised his hands in surrender.
He sank to the floor, his aching face cradled in his hands, and cried.
? Granger charged on with her story. “His father abandoned his mother while she was pregnant, and then she died shortly after childbirth. He was raised in a Muggle orphanage in London – yes,” she cut him off before he could ask, “We did try to visit it, but it’s since been razed to the ground and replaced with an office building. He was taken from the orphanage at 11 and went to Hogwarts and has basically spent the time since trying to erase any mention of his Muggle heritage. He even killed his father and grandparents, did you know that?” she asked and Draco shook his head, stunned.
“No,” Hermione said, cutting across him. “It makes much more sense if I take the cloak and–”
“Because, I think, I want to
“I think we should move too, but let’s go when it’s dark. We can Disapparate under the cloak as well,” she said, and he and Potter nodded. Hermione gave them a reassuring smile.
“We’re off to bed,” Bill eventually told the boys, and Fleur sidled past him, waving goodnight. “Don’t stay up too late,” he told them and they chorused goodnight as he followed his wife upstairs.
“Thank you Dobby, for looking after me. Thank you for remembering I like honey in my tea when I’m upset. Thank you for playing games with me in that horrible stuffy nursery. Thank you for preparing me for what was to come, and thank you for coming when I called. You were far kinder than I ever deserved,” he said quietly and Hermione sniffled behind him. Potter swallowed.
“Well enough, I hope. I had best be going though, I’m joining Mother for dinner,” he said and Harry tried not to frown. Malfoy gave them both a small smile and wave, then disappeared into the ground flooding out of the atrium into the autumn sunset.
After five minutes or so, a flare of silver sparks flew up from in front of the Manor, and Begbie called at them all to "Move!", so Harry took off at a run along with the Aurors. They skirted around the hedge, coming to the large wrought iron gates, which were now twisted and charred, and in a few select places, still smouldering. Harry ducked through them, Draco just behind him, and they ran up the gravel driveway with the Aurors, Hermione and Ron following suit.
The gargoyle that guarded the entrance to the Headmaster’s office cleared it’s throat.
“Dobby!” Draco exclaimed in relief and Dobby raised a finger to his lips to silence him.
He had always been pale and pointy, all high cheekbones and a sharp chin, but this summer had chiselled away at his face. His cheeks looked hollow and his pale grey eyes sunken, his skin bruised purple under his eyes from exhaustion. His fine white-blond hair, always so carefully styled before, hung around his face in a lank curtain, as if it too was tired. He had grown in the summer, taller now than he had been but still slim (maybe too much so, as his ribs were now visible when he showered, and his collarbones stood out sharply under his shirts). He looked like a ghost.
There was a clanking noise on the other side of the door that Draco hadn’t heard before, and he craned his head to look, shouting as a gravy boat seared his rips.
“He’s in the Shrieking Shack. The snake’s with him, it’s got some sort of magical protection around it. He’s just sent Lucius Malfoy to find Snape,” he said, still in Draco’s arms. “Your dad thinks you’re dead,” he said simply and Draco shook his head.
Hermione was waiting for him just inside the atrium. Her hair had fallen mostly loose of her bun and she was trying to tie it back again, three bobby pins gripped between her teeth. Harry smiled at her and she rolled her eyes.
Draco moved further into the hall, eyes searching. Ron and Hermione were still with the Weasleys, though Mr Weasley had moved to sit where Draco had been before, between the bodies of Lupin and Nymphadora, his head hanging low. Hermione looked up as she saw Draco approach, but with one small shake of his head, he told her everything she needed to know.
“Lupin,” Bill muttered, sheathing his wand again and running for the front door. He wrenched it open against the howling winds and a man practically fell over the threshold. He was wrapped in a well-worn travelling cloak and when he lowered the hood, Draco could see he was pale beneath his greying hair. He looked shell-shocked and Draco took a second to reconcile this with the man who had once stood confidently at the front of a line of students and summoned them forward to face their worst fears.
And once that was done and his face stung in the winter air, he sat back on the cold damp ground and cried.
“‘old him,” Crabbe told Goyle, who left Draco’s legs and went to pin one of his arms down. Roughly Crabbe yanked his sleeve back, exposing the forearm with the Dark Mark, which stood out starkly in the light of the common room. Draco didn’t realise what was going to happen until he saw a flash of silver in Crabbe’s hand and then he was screaming.
“A rather remote one in Scotland,” he said and Longshaw’s eyebrows raised.
“We have Harry Potter,” he explained in his raspy voice and Father perked up, his eyes suddenly more confused than they had been. He stepped closer to the group but his shadow obscured Potter’s face.
The snake had bitten him and was trying to slither up his side, trying to get at Potter but another spell from Granger sent it spitting back. Potter managed to get to his feet, and he helped Draco up with one rough hand around his waist and Draco staggered, trying not to put too much weight on his leg. The pain from the Mark lessened slightly as Potter’s touch and Draco used that to fuel himself, scrambling over the bed to get to the door. Granger came after them, Potter reaching out a hand to drag her over the dusty mottled duvet, but she was yanked back, screaming. Draco lurched forward to grab her and together they hauled her over, kicking at the snake who reared at them all. She righted herself and they ran for it, Granger screaming “
What followed was a series of letters that Harry couldn’t have predicted, even with one of Trelawney’s most polished crystal balls. Whichever poor Owl was having to transport their letters was hopefully getting fed well, given that as soon as Harry received a reply from Malfoy (thanking him for sending over the papers and also insisting that the book was not a loan, but a gift), he was writing back the next day. On and on it went, letter after letter, Harry’s indifference for Malfoy thawing into something more.
“They want Granger,” he said as soon as his mind settled, and Potter looked up and around at him. His hair was once more a riot but his eyes were keen. He looked Draco over once, and then nodded and turned back to the window.
“Oi, pretty boy,” came a call from the Stairs in front of him. Draco’s eyes flew open to see Fenrir Greyback stood there, a group of lackeys surrounding him. The hairs on the back of his neck stood on end, like they always did when Fenrir was near. His sharp teeth and strange amber eyes did little to endear him to Draco, and the nicknames didn’t help either. Fenrir bared his teeth at Draco in something that might have once been a smile, before the Wolf inside took over. “Better keep that bed warm for me, eh?” Fenrir practically purred and the lackeys laughed uproariously as Draco held himself very very still.
The arms around Draco tightened and he hiccupped once, coming back to himself. He looked over Harry’s shoulder to see the body of Snape still lying there, and he looked away.
??” he snarled and Draco flinched back. Granger put a soothing hand on Potter’s arm and held him in place, as it looked like he was tempted to throw himself at Draco and start punching. Draco pinched the bridge of his nose to stave off the oncoming headache and took another sip of tea.
“‘The Tale of the Three Brothers is a story – a story about how humans are frightened of death. If surviving was as simple as hiding under the invisibility cloak, we’d have everything we need already!” she snapped and Weasley gave her a petulant look.
“He spent all of second year trying to “
They sat in silence for what seemed like another hour. Eventually Potter stood and left the fireside again, returning a few minutes later with two mugs of tea, one of which he handed to Draco who took it gratefully, cradling it in his hands as he turned another page of ‘
The air turned cold around him and Draco felt like his breath had been stolen away. He gasped, clutching a hand to his chest and he risked another look around the wall. A group of dementors, ten or so, were gliding down the road, coming from the direction of the Shrieking Shack. He had to act fast. Though his hand shook, Draco fished his wand out of his jumper and raised it. He thought of Harry, Ron and Hermione and the laughter they had shared at the lakes edge.
“Is that a Muggle tent?” she asked, nodding her head at the scattered tent poles.
She did the same to Weasley, though he only frowned, not experiencing the same revelation that the others did.
“Morning!” Hermione called from the door to her bedroom and Draco could’ve cursed her as they both looked away. “Did you make porridge, Draco?” she asked, twisting her hair around itself on the back of her head and spearing her wand through it, holding it in place.
“Didn’t you hear?” Blaise drawled, looking at the Hufflepuffs out of the corner of his eyes. “One of their lot has gone missing. Caroline Purvis, Mudblood girl,” he sneered and one of the Hufflepuffs caught Draco’s eye. He looked away before Draco could react, shrinking back into the group.
“Don’t you dare speak to Draco like–,” his mother began furiously but her sister rounded on her.
“Weird dream, sorry,” he murmured into the quiet. Harry made a small, soothing sound and reached out for him, and Draco let himself be gathered up to Harry’s chest, pressing his ear to over Harry’s heart, soothed by the
It was like someone had hit the room with a deafening charm. The occupants all fell silent, and the celebratory mood that had encompassed the room only seconds before was gone.
“You’re with Potter, in’t ya?” Crabbe said in a dull voice, lifting his short, stout wand and jabbing it. A spark shot out and shattered the mirror behind Draco. “You’re gonna take us to ‘im, and then we’ll kill ‘im,”
“Cloak?” he asked and Potter looked away sheepishly.
“You too, Granger, Potter,” Malfoy said, before walking away, losing himself in the crowd. Harry watched him go until he couldn’t see that white blond hair anymore.
“No,” she said firmly, getting to her feet. Goyle still lay in the middle of the corridor, his chest rising and falling but his eyes open and unseeing. “Let’s stick together. I say we go – Harry, what’s that on your arm?” she asked, pointing, and Harry jerked and looked down.
“I’ll take the watch tonight,” he offered as he sat back down and Potter looked at him from over the top of his glasses but didn’t say anything further. A long stretch of silence passed between them before the question bubbled up from Draco’s mouth before he could stop it. “Do you not remember the dreams?” he asked and Potter stiffened but didn’t look over at him. “I just thought – well, I thought they were real. I mean, I thought I was going mad when it first happened but since then it’s been
“Harry, look!” Granger said suddenly, having pulled him forward slightly. Draco looked too and gasped.
“Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?” Harry asked, his voice carrying over the hush of the room. Voldemort passed Draco, he and Harry moving slowly in a perfect circle. It seemed like the world had fallen away except for the two of them, and when Harry spoke, it was only to Voldemort. “Accident, when I decided to fight in that graveyard? Accident, that I didn’t defend myself tonight, and still survived, and returned to fight again?”
There was a smart rap on the glass door of the Orangery and Draco looked up to see who was disturbing him. He had come to hide amongst the portraits and statues in the Malfoy collection, tucking himself between
“Where’d you get that?” Granger said, covering her mouth with one hand as she spoke, having just taken a bite of her sandwich.
“Tryouts will be in the third week of September, so keep practising,” Harry said with a grin, now Gryffindor Head of House.
He didn’t want Harry to do this. What if he didn’t come back this time? But before he could protest, Harry had closed his eyes and then he was a dead weight in Draco’s arms. Draco lowered them both to the floor quickly, Harry cradled in his arms as Ron and Hermione watched.
He hoped, stupidly, that Potter might try and board the train but when the pistons started chugging and the train began to slip out of the station, it became obvious that he would not be. There was no murmur of his name through the train, like there usually was, and Draco felt himself deflate in his seat. Pansy’s grip on his arm tightened.
“About the spells, not your appearance!” he justified and Draco sniffed. He and Weasley pulled on black robes that Hermione had found in a storage cupboard at Shell Cottage and Harry swung the invisibility cloak over himself and Griphook, who had climbed onto Harry’s back.
The Bulstrodes were from Gaddley. Draco felt sick, imagining Milicent laughing as she cursed and killed a family of five. She wouldn’t, would she? Milicent could be harsh and brutish, but surely she wasn’t capable of murder? Draco pressed his knuckles into his eyes and tried to breathe through the nausea.
“I’ve seen him in there hundreds of times Greyback, Vernon’s a Slytherin,” he added confidently and next to him Dean Thomas held his breath. The line of questioning switched immediately, the Snatchers knocked back by Potter’s quick (and correct) response.
" and he had frozen where his hand had been holding a Moly, about to drop it into a bubbling cauldron. He had taken a while to compose himself, to snuff out the fires under the potions that were already brewing, and gather his things (and his thoughts). And then he had Apparated to London, and helped to find his boys, and regain his family.
As the meal drew to a close, many of the Death Eaters were pleasantly buzzed on the wine and were languidly draped over their chairs, talking amongst themselves, largely ignoring his family which had given them food and shelter throughout the summer. But there was an energy in the room, a feeling of anticipation clogging the air, and Draco felt a thrill of adrenaline every time the dining room door opened. Inevitably it had been a late-comer or an elf bringing more food, but he couldn’t resist looking up every time the large oak door creaked. As the wine bottles began to run dry, the door opened once more, and Severus Snape slipped in.
“Good to see you, Draco,” he said kindly and Draco dropped Potter’s hand, took Lupin’s offered hand and shook it.
Maybe some things had changed.
"Harry," Dumbledore greeted him with a smile, and he then turned his gaze to Malfoy, who looked away. "Mr. Malfoy. I am sorry to hear about your sons," he said and Harry choked a little, his throat constricting. Malfoy knocked their shoulders together.
Potter brought up the rear, ducking into the tent, the Shield Charm gone. He looked soaked through and he shivered violently as he looked around, spotting Draco sitting on the bed. He obviously thought for a second, but then decided to head for Draco, sitting next to him on the bunk, plucking one of the blankets from the foot of his bed up and wrapping it around himself. Still shivering, he handed over Draco’s wand and said, with chattering teeth, “If it looks like Hermione’s about to jinx him, cast P
“Your father must be pleased,” he said coolly and Draco felt a jolt of rage go through him.
“How is it my fault?” Harry asked, feeling his temper rise. He had forgiven Malfoy as much as he could, given all he had been through at his hand. Hermione held up a quelling hand.
“Doh,”
“I have it here, if you want?” he asked, offering it up and Potter took it, opening it up in front of him on the bench, bending over to look at it. Draco looked away, feeling heat rise in his cheeks.
that I was dead,”
The walk up to the large wood and iron doors had been peaceful, as it seemed that the albino peacocks that had inhabited the Manor grounds had all gone. The gardens were well kept if not nearly as elaborate as they had been years ago, and the Manor itself looked a little faded at the edges, as though something had been taken from it long ago.
“It’s okay, I understand. Very Slytherin trait though, to save yourselves,” he added and Harry laughed again.
“I got it! The password was ‘Albus’! This is it, this is Potterwatch,” Weasley exclaimed and Draco had to stop himself from rolling his eyes at the name. The trio sat around the wireless while Draco remained on the bench, listening intently to the voice that he vaguely recognised now issuing from it.
Hermione, running past, gave him an impressed look, but she turned back to the group of Goblins and fired off another ‘
’ Draco read by the light from the fire and he wrinkled his nose.
“Everything’s fine,” he told the table, which let out a collective breath. He updated them on how the other members of the Weasley family were doing before slipping into the seat left for him at the head of the table. Draco hadn’t really been listening but Bill must’ve said the wrong thing because his soup bowl was zipped out from under his spoon by a snapped spell from Fleur, who marched off into the kitchen with the bowls stacked in her hands. Bill gave them all an apologetic smile.
“Thank you so much Dobby, for rescuing me, from that cellar. It’s so unfair that you had to die, when you were so good and brave. I’ll always remember what you did for us. I hope you’re happy now,” she said in a quiet, respectful voice and then she looked up, expectantly. Ron cleared his throat.
“I–” he began but Potter sniffed and turned his face away before he could say anything more.
“Why?” Granger asked, her voice sharp in the room as the fire crackled behind her. Bathilda shook her head a little, as though the sound hurt her.
"They shall find them, dear. I have the utmost faith in them, and you should as well," she told him and Harry gave her a nod, before covering his face once again.
“You’ll get there,” Potter said and Draco huffed. He gave him an encouraging smile. “You will. It took Hermione ages, longer than you would think it would. You haven’t failed yet, you’re still trying,” Potter scuffed his shoe against Draco’s again and Draco gave him another scowl. “Do you know what Patronus your family has? Sometimes it can help to picture one you’ve seen before,” Potter suggested and Draco rolled his eyes.
“Fiendfyre,
“And why now? Why have you come to us now?” Granger asked and Draco huffed a laugh.
Rain was falling harder now and the sky was darkening with the night. He found his way out of Wistman’s Wood, following the small track back out into the open fields and found a flat patch of grass nearby, sheltered from the wind. He set down his backpack and with another look around to see if any Muggles were watching, he took his wand out and began casting wards.
As Scorpius hurried down the stairs, Albus' door clicked open, and he stepped out, giving Draco an approving look.
“Is it love, again?” Voldemort finally said after a long pause, his tone mocking. “Dumbledore’s favourite solution, love, which he claimed conquered death, though love did not stop him falling from the Tower and breaking like an old waxwork?” Draco flinched at the memory, glancing away. Hermione’s eyes were trained on Harry, as were Ron’s, and both of them looked as though they were trying with all of their might not to run to his side. Voldemort continued. “Love, which did not prevent me stamping out your Mudblood mother like a cockroach. Potter – and nobody seems to love you enough to run forwards this time, and take my curse. So what will stop you dying now when I strike?” he asked and Draco desperately wanted to shout out.
!” he said and the wand sparked and then, like a dying match, went out. Potter eyed it and then tried pointing it at Draco, who leaned back a little in his seat. “
Poppy, as well as several other professors, gave a small gasp. "And you are sure he will need them?"
Lily had a sister, a twin sister by the name of Rose. Her hair was a more fiery red, and her eyes more blue than green. She was hated by Petunia even more than Lily was. And after the twins got their Hogwarts letters, Petunia detested the two even more. She knew they weren’t normal, what with Lily making flowers float down to her and Rose making a fluorescent purple light with her fingers.
The man held a face of obvious joy and delight. He tried to stand still but he was still bouncing up and down in place. "Harry Potter has returned! I overheard your name and thought I would let you know, so I've been looking all over Diagon Alley to tell you!"
"It snapped earlier and I'm still learning such everyday spells."
The interior was surprisingly not as gloomy as the alley itself despite the dark paint and dark-stained wood that was set up all throughout the store. "Let me talk to the owner, okay?" Harry nodded up at his aunt and they walked up to the counter, behind which stood a very tall dark-skinned woman with pale eyes and a scar across her nose. Her dark hair was braided thickly into a mohawk of sorts and she was wearing a sleeveless black dress patterned with grey skulls.
Harry glanced down. "That's true," he said softly before shaking his head. "Want to help me open these?" Draco smirked again and nodded, and the two got to work.
headmaster thought I would be and hired someone to take my place rather offends me," she stated firmly. "I simply don't want to seem like I'm favoring Harry more than the other students."
to levitate the troll's club and knock it out with it, and all was silent. Rose pointed her own wand at the troll and magical ropes shot out, wrapping around the lumbering creature and ensuring that if it got up, it would not attack anyone.
Rose smirked. "Very good, Harry. You see the pillars?" Harry counted three between Platforms 9 and 10.
. She then decided to walk outside the pub, leaving money at the bar, and tucked her book into her robe. She saw a familiar lumbering giant walking with a young boy nearly a third of his height, who was also the spitting image of her late sister and brother-in-law. Rose huffed to herself. She caught their eyes and waved gracefully, happy Harry had made it safely. Hagrid smiled at her, then ducked down to whisper something to her nephew. He nodded, and started to walk towards Rose, Hagrid going a different way. She watched him with swirling thoughts.
"Oh? So, where to first? What did Hagrid tell you?"
Rose was laughing maniacally to herself in Madam Malkin's as she was getting Harry several sets of different robes; casual, formal, dress, school uniforms, and after taking them back to her flat she planned on going to Muggle London for some Muggle clothes. When the madam was done, Rose left the shop with no less than ten bags full of robes. She Apparated to her flat and set the bags in the guest room, which she was going to set up as Harry's room, and changed from her teaching robes into a pair of black jeans and her alumni shirt. Grabbing her leather jacket, the Apparated to the safe point in the shopping district of Muggle London and counted out her pounds. She donned a smirk when she thought of just what she was going to buy her nephew.
"Yes," Harry spoke, cutting Rose off. "I want to live here, with you. I want to stay in the Wizarding world." His eyes were teetering on misty and he took a breath to calm himself. "If you would have me, that is."
"Do you not want me to?" Harry countered with a raised eyebrow. The girl flushed and shook her head mutely. Harry shrugged at her. "Then I am sitting here because I need a table to work at, and I like the quiet better than the noise of my common room."
Rose helped Harry fit his things into the side car and settled him in, casting a nonverbal charm to keep Harry's things from falling out with a quick point of her finger. Before handing him a helmet, she gave him a long stare. "Harry?" she started, unsure. The boy looked up at his aunt. "You know you're not a freak, right?" Harry looked down for a moment before looking back up and nodding.
She patted Severus’s shoulder in thanks and Apparated to wherever Hagrid was. He was standing on a shore in the middle of a storm. Across the water was a small shack, presumably where Harry was. “Oh, that horrible sister of mine is going to get it,” she muttered in disgust. Hagrid turned towards her and shook his head. Soon, they had enchanted a boat and were sailing over to the small island.
"Not all snakes are slimy," Draco said, subtly sitting straighter and speaking more posh. Harry realized they were talking about Slytherins- which included his aunt and Draco's parents.
"Wait, Rose-"
"Thank you, Mr. Lupin," Harry said with a reverence previously unknown to him. Lupin smiled and clapped his shoulder again, though the smile was a tad bit wry as the man corrected him with a soft
Harry nodded, speechless. Rose had gone out and bought him clothes? To put in his new (
Rose tilted her head up and stared down her at the boy, channeling Severus. "Ten points from Gryffindor, and
as he reached with both hands to pick the cloth up. It was soft and almost silk-like, slipping through his hands easily if he didn't have enough grip on it. Harry found two corners of the cloth, stood up, held it in front of him, and disappeared.
"Those Muggles who raised you?" Draco asked, writing notes on what he was reading with one of the Muggle pens Harry gave him; the aspect of not having to dip a quill both shocked and excited him.
gave him an idea, but he didn't know if she had a Mastery in it.
"Oh, I've been meaning to pick this up. I should get it now while I can, because who knows if it'll still be here." Harry leaned over and looked at the cover of the book she held.
"We've also noticed that you and Professor Snape spend a lot of time together in each other's rooms-"
Rose nodded and plucked the tie from the girl's hand. She cast a
Rose blinked and reached behind her, where she indeed had a stowaway hiding in her hood. She removed whatever it was, and the class melted at the sight of her kitten. "Mewt, I thought I told you to stay on my desk." The black kitten mewed at her, causing squeals and words of affection to echo throughout the room. Rose sighed as if feeling very put out. "I suppose I have no choice but to allow you to stay." She let him crawl onto her shoulder and he disappeared back into her hood, where he quickly fell back asleep.
"Indeed not," she said, sipping from her own cup. Harry eyed her a little before taking another gander, and the warmth blossomed in his chest. It almost tasted like baked apples sprinkled with cinnamon.
"Wow," Harry breathed, slightly overwhelmed. However, Draco was nearly vibrating from excitement. He recognized all of the crystals from his father's work, and was excited for Harry to have all of them. Harry noticed that the Fluorite looked similar to the stone attached to his journal, which told him it could also help with studying.
In his annual welcoming speech, the wizard mentioned, "And joining the faculty this year will be Professor Quirrell, who is going to be assisting Professor Rose in Defense."
"Er, well, I'm right-handed," Harry said shyly. He held it out, like Olivander asked him. Harry then tried many wands, but finally found one that agreed with him.
"Welcome class," she spoke with a thin smile. She looked a little worn compared to the glow she seemed to have last night, but Harry suspected only he really noticed. She wore a floor-length emerald dress that was dashed with white, black and red designs and her hair was tied back in a low ponytail. "Obviously I am not Professor Snape, but he is currently unwell, so I am taking over his classes for the day. Professor Quirrell will be teaching Defense." A few of his classmates snickered at this, behind their hands of course, and Harry noted the writing on the board. It was his aunt's, not Snape's, so he had not even been to his classroom. "As Professor Snape has been preparing you, we will be brewing a Cure for Boils potion today. I urge you to be very careful in your brewing and to not hesitate if you require any assistance."
Those were the last words they had exchanged. It pained Draco to know that their friendship could have flourished, that maybe she really could have helped him. Sometimes he wondered what would have happened if he had never approached the strange and feisty redhead. He probably would have ended up fucking Theo without talking to Pansy first, and would have broken apart their group.
“Sorry, don’t have any treats,” he said, his speech muffled from holding the cigarette in between his lips. The owl clicked its beak and flew off.
“Josh, sir.”
Andromeda pulled out her wand, and with a flick of her wrist, the corners of the tables were protected, the drawers locked, and the couch covered in colourful sheets.
“He’s staying with us. And you’re gonna help me take care of him,” Draco explained. He picked up the kid once more, gesturing to Blaise to get the baby bag. His friend did so without complaining of having to take care of a toddler.
“She asked me to go visit her.”
There was a huge fireplace on the right wall that warmed up the whole place, and on the opposite wall stood the small red door. On the back wall stood the bar, with its sturdy mahogany top, the glasses hanging from the racks, which were suspended from the ceiling, and the back with hundreds of bottles of different drinks from all over the world, the mirror behind the shelves making it seem as if there was actually a lot more bottles sitting on them.
“There’s this friend of mine who needs help, but I’m not an expert on the subject so I promised him I’d ask someone who knew more about it,” Draco started. “He has… conflicting feelings about boys and girls. And since I’ve seen you kiss half the school at parties, not caring about their gender, I wanted to ask. Is it possible to like both?”
“Don’t listen to them, Blaise. I know
Harry walked towards his old nemesis, his face pale and contrasting against the dark. “Long time no see, Malfoy.”
“I like this place,” Draco answered, his face serious. He rarely smiled, and he definitely wouldn’t waste his emotions on supremacist scum.
“What may I get you?” Malfoy asked, resting his hands on the counter. The dim lighting made his eyes look black.
“Well, let’s go home then. We all need some rest,” he said.
“At 8,” Hermione answered, and took a look at her watch. “Merlin’s beard! It’s almost 8. Let’s go!” She exclaimed, shoving her papers onto her desk and pulling her wand out of her hair. She threw her half eaten apple in the bin, grabbed a different stack of papers and ran outside, pulling Harry with her.
“Don’t do that to yourself, Ginevra. You can do better,” he said jokingly.
“But why? What’s going on, Malfoy?”
“Sorry,” he mumbled, stumbling and grabbing onto Tom’s arm.
“Maybe because there still is a lot of prejudice against them. And the law system in the Ministry of Magic is deeply flawed, so they actually get worse punishments for the same crime a pureblood committed, for example,” Potter answered.
“No they won’t. You know I don’t give a fuck. I’m only doing this because it’s the right thing to do,” Draco took another sip of his water. “Will you help me?”
He headed into the kitchen and grabbed an apple, bananas, and some water. He mixed it up in the blender and winced when the loud noise pierced his head. Then he poured it all into a cup and drank it. He didn’t know if it actually had any effect, but his aunt had made him this juice after one of the worst nights of his life and it seemed to cure him from his hangover. So now he made it every time he felt like shit because of booze.
Ginny sat there watching him for a couple of moments while Draco stared back. He couldn’t figure out what she was thinking.
The boy’s eyes widened to the size of saucers.
Hermione turned to Pansy, her eyebrows raised.
“So you finally understand what it’s like to feel like you don’t belong, what it’s like when others make you feel like you don’t deserve a chance?” Harry answered, standing up. He looked at Malfoy, a face so familiar yet so distant in his mind. The blonde boy had changed a lot in the last two years, not only physically but mentally. They had crossed each other’s paths sometimes when visiting Ted and Andromeda, but they never exchanged more than a greeting or farewell.
“I know. But it’ll be good for you both, now that we’re all doing fine,” Draco said, a lump rising in his throat because of the lie. His mother wasn’t fine, not at all, and he felt terrible for leaving her all alone locked in a country home in the cold northern England, but at the same time, he still had a life to live. “Come on, auntie, don’t be a chicken. I’ll take care of Ted, stay here a few days.”
He chose his usual outfit, a black button up shirt and black trousers. He threw a sweater over it, knowing it would be cold outside, and put on a pair of black boots. Draco was combing his hair back when he heard a knock on the front door. He waited for Blaise to answer it, but apparently he was caught up in something in his room. Draco trudged to the foyer, and in front of him stood Andromeda, Teddy bundled up in warm clothes on her arms.
He looked at himself in the mirror, running a hand through his hair, which was already messy even if he had just gotten out of the shower. Harry halfheartedly flexed his muscles, which had gotten bigger after all his Auror training. He didn’t care if he was muscly now. Actually, he had never cared about his appearance. All he wanted nowadays was to keep everyone safe, especially those he loved.
Harry went into the kitchen, got his breakfast ready and as he sat there waiting for his water to boil, he thought about Ginny. She had gone off to play Quidditch after the war, and it had been hard. Harry missed her, and he knew she missed him too, but they both knew they had to follow their own paths. Harry wanted to find himself, give himself a purpose that didn’t rely on any prophecy, destiny or universe bullshit.
“I’m such a fucking mess,” Draco said. He walked into the living room and threw himself down on the couch. He realised then that he hadn’t even taken his trench coat off. “I’m so tired of this bullshit, Blaise. Why can’t people just leave the fucking muggleborns alone? It’s always the same story. They always think they’re gonna win.”
“What are you doing here? I thought I was picking him up,” he said. He glanced at the pair of suitcases at her side. “For God’s sake, Dromeda, you’re staying there for only a week.”
She stared at him, dumbfounded. “You called me Ginny.”
Draco heard the door open and looked up. Blaise was wearing his pyjama shorts and a white shirt, his eyes heavy from just being woken up.
“So you have to go to the Ministry on Monday? They’ll eat you alive,” Blaise said.
“I think that’s a great idea, mate,” Ron answered. “I’ll apparate us, I don’t wanna get splinched. Again.”
Mr Johnson was still quite strong, yet you could see he was tired and done with the Auror life. He walked over to the head of the table, and sat down painfully, judging by the look on his face.
“Got a package for you, Zabini,” Tom said, and grabbed Draco by the cuff of his shirt and pushed him softly through the door. “Good night,” with that, he vanished.
“I say we wait close to the employees’ door and talk to one of them,” Harry said.
“Potter, we all know that being the Boy Who Lived and all, you were going to climb faster than anyone. And it’s not just because you’re famous. You’re a good kid, and have a lot of talent,” Mr Johnson said, uncrossing his arms. “There’s also the fact that I’m an old man, and I want to retire soon.”
The girl pulled out a couple of blank papers and a quill which she enchanted to write down as they spoke. It reminded Draco of that bitch Skeeter, which had done quite a good job of slandering his name after the war.
The group entered the elevator and stood in awkward silence until they reached the Department of Law Enforcement. It was one of the biggest sections of the Ministry, yet Draco could still recall some of it from the time he came here for trial. It was a crazy time, with his father trying to get into his head, Draco having to solve money issues, and his mother being hysterical.
“Fuck,” he whispered to himself. Draco looked around his room, taking in what he had done the night before. His clothes laid strewn all over his floor, and apparently he had simply thrown himself onto his bed, not even covering himself with the duvet. He had left that room in worse situations than this.
The building they lived in was near a park, so that was where Draco was headed. There were muggle children playing on the swings, their cheeks red because of the cold autumn chill. Draco sat on a bench and lit a cigarette.
“No. But he told me to come in today.”
Harry followed Malfoy up to the bar and watched as he crouched under the top and reappeared on the other side, to which Harry realized was his queue to sit at the bar. He took a seat in one of the comfortable burgundy stools, fixing his cloak so he wouldn’t sit on it and pull the hood back.
Harry sighed and threw his head back against the beanbag, raising the Firewhiskey bottle to his lips and chugging. He was so tired of being tired, of having nightmares, and feeling like he was getting behind on the paths of life. But at the same time, he was only 20. He still had some time. So he drank, alone, watching TV on a Saturday night.
15:28
Pansy nodded. “Only saw him in a meeting. He goes by the Spectre, never learned his real name. The group is called Council of The Spectre.”
“I can see you, you know?” Draco said, holding up his wand.
“Of course not, Peter. We don’t even know who these guys are, a bunch of Aurors would cause panic and we could lose track of them,” Ron answered.
He turned to look and saw a brown owl sitting on the ledge, waiting. Draco stood up, opened the window and took the letter from the owl’s leg.
“It’s the most I can do,” he said. Ginny then sighed and sat up.
“I know I don’t have to, but I want to do this. Come on.”
The building they lived in was for wizards only, hidden amongst two other muggle buildings. Thank Merlin their landlord, as long as he was getting paid, didn’t care who lived in his building, since Draco and Blaise had gotten rejected by at least 5 apartments because of their past and had been running out of time to find a place.
“I’m gonna be Head Auror,” he answered, turning around to face them.
“I know,” Harry answered. “Please don’t do anything rash, I’m here to talk.”
“What about these meetings? People can’t have opinions now?” Malfoy said, pouring himself a drink.
The group sat in silence, thinking.
Over the next weeks, Draco would appear in the courtyard where Ginny always hung out during breaks. He’d nod towards her, and she would stand up and head to the greenhouse. There, he would smoke cigarettes while he listened to her talk about her own experiences, how she had come to explore her sexuality, and how she was very possibly in love with Luna Lovegood. Well, she never explicitly said that, but the girl would just ramble on and on about the Loony kid, so Draco could just guess Ginny had feelings for her.
When Harry entered the common room that Saturday, he was surprised to see a note on the teachers' board saying Rose was out for the day. When they had talked last night after dinner, Rose assured him that they could meet at some point to discuss a piece of reading Harry had had trouble with. So he hummed to himself and went back to the dorm room he shared with Draco, Blaise and Theodore Nott to relax a bit before going to breakfast.
"Walk by three times and think very clearly what it is you want," Rose explained as she walked up to it and started pacing. After the third walk-by, just as she said, a marvelous ornate door appeared and the three entered. Inside was dark and the only light came from various candles lit around the room, and on the floor lay a circle and triangle full of runes. They were scrawled very elegantly in white against the dark wood floor, and inside sat two candles, each carved with runes as well.
Rose set the bags down, which then flew to her closet, and turned to take the list. "Thank you, Pin. What did he go for the most?"
Harry didn't stumble as much as he did last time he took the Floo, and he counted it as a victory. Flooing was much better than Apparition, in his opinion. Rose steadied him as he got out, nibbling on a leftover cinnamon roll from breakfast.
It was Harry's turn to smile. He wanted to get that second wand and perfect the shield spells as soon as possible. He nodded and set the letter down to get a quill and parchment, but then he remembered that Rose had the Muggle equivalent. "Do you have a pen and some paper?"
The Third-year flushed and lowered his head. "S-Sorry, Granger. Thanks for getting us points," he mumbled.
"Pumpernickel," Rose answered. "It's kinda sweet, kinda sour. Wanna try?" He nodded so she offered the other piece. Harry took a tentative bite and made a face, getting a laugh out of his aunt. "It's an acquired taste, I know. Even Severus doesn't like it, and he loves the darker tastes." Rose shrugged and they ate their breakfast in peace.
Harry shook his head slightly. What had happened in their Fifth year? It obviously wasn't too drastic ( more so than trying to kill each other ) if they could sit nearly
He was excited for this exchange of gifts, which surprised him. Earlier at the Malfoys' he'd been anxious because of the stiffness and formality of the affair, but this was more relaxed. Rose took up the couch and Snape perched gracefully beside her with two glasses of wine. His aunt served him a breathtaking smile that wanted to melt Snape's cold mask.
on herself and sitting down at the vanity. The witch applied black eyeliner, mascara, and rose colored lipstick before standing and waving her wand. The dress swapped places with her Muggle ensemble and the material felt smooth against her skin. Looking into the body mirror opposite her vanity, Rose waved again and her hair managed to fit itself into a somewhat smooth high ponytail, with her fringe in the front too short to stay in the black hair tie framing her face. Another wave of her wand tied a sheer green scarf that shimmered with silver glitter around her ponytail. She gestured at a black hair pin that Severus had given her a few years ago and it fit snugly at the base of her ponytail. It was made from pure Jet, and she made sure to wear it to big (stressful) events, such as the welcoming feast. The Garnet and Labradorite earrings she wore hummed a bit as the crystals harmonized with each other, and Rose gazed into the body mirror once more.
"You two keep pestering me, I'll give you detention.
“I could say the same for you, Rose,” Petunia said back. Rose looked away from her sister and back to her nephew.
"This year I will be introducing the concept of using spells and crystals to defend yourself." She made to say more, but a student raised their hand. "Yes, Miss Glendower?"
"Slytherin dorms are
"Those were a gift from the couple I saw at the Muggle store. They're actually Muggleborn wixen, so after you wear them once, they will form to your feet and then grow with you."
Well, but Rose had put an emphasis of some kind onto the words, the name of the item. What that meant exactly, Harry didn't know. At the moment, at least. As soon as he got back to Hogwarts, he was going to theorize with his roommates. There was a possibility that he'd uncover something here.
"That doesn't seem very nice," Harry mumbled.
"Aunt Rose, this is … " Harry couldn't stop his eyes from watering. "This is great. Thank you."
It was summer now, and she was taking a stroll through Diagon Alley. She thought she’d get a pet, maybe a cat or something.
In his double classes with the Gryffindors, he noticed a girl who was being left out of practically everything. No one talked to her at meals and she was actively avoided during class, even though she proved to be quite smart. It was after a week that Harry realized it was the girl from the train that had come in with Ronald - and while the boy had made more comments about snakes he seemed to try even harder to exclude her - and he recalled her name was Hermione Granger. Harry didn't like how the lions were excluding one of their own for being different, something that hit a little too close to home for him. So he took to the library - where Granger was rumored to spend most of her free time - and sat himself down at her table. The girl had looked up sharply at him, but Harry ignored her as he took out his Charms notes. Granger stared at him for several moments before turning back to her own work. This became a pattern over the next week, until Granger got fed up with him.
Hedwig was off with a letter in the morning though Harry had written it the night before. While he waited for his aunt to wake, he got himself a cup of water from the sink and heated up some leftovers in the microwave ( Harry still astounded by the blend of Muggle and Magic in the flat ). He struggled his way onto a stool at the island and enjoyed his aunt's cooking once more. Halfway through, Hedwig soared back through the window and landed on the edge of the white countertop with a letter in her beak. Harry wiped his mouth and took it with a smile.
on it in gold lettering, and black biker boots. Her black leather jacket had a rose patch on the back. Her normally wild fiery hair wisped about her when released from the helmet and fell down her back in curly waves. She hummed to herself, tempted to buy a bike for herself.
After a few minutes he stammered, "What does it mean, they await my owl?"
"Of course," Rose answered, "Marcy's like a niece to me and I've always liked Vivek, so of course they'd invite their aunt and cousin to their wedding."
Rose tilted the strange package this way and that, the grip on her wand turning her knuckles white. The package spun in midair without anyone touching it and Harry sipped his cider as he watched. His aunt had risen not half an hour after he left the tea, and now she held a steaming mug of coffee in her right hand that she sipped from every few seconds while staring at the parcel.
"No, I want to see how the next month with them goes. I think they'll treat me a little better."
"-this?" George flaunted the parchment, and Rose recognized it immediately. It was the map that James, Sirius and Remus worked on with some tips from Pettigrew.
he whispered intently to Remus as Rose leaned closer to rub her nose against Snape's ( to which he
Not that any of it mattered to the twins. The Evans Twins, as they were known as throughout their years at Hogwarts. Lily was a genius in all of her classes, and though Rose showed talent in every class, she had a knack for Defense Against the Dark Arts.
Rose and Severus exchanged a look, and the witch only looked slightly funny wearing a stern face with her getup. They assisted in ushering the Slytherins safely through the halls towards the Dungeons, watching carefully for the troll. It didn't seem to be anywhere near the House, thankfully, and Rose mentally tallied up the students she saw. She blanched when she realized she had not seen Harry or Draco, and Severus turned towards her sharply when he realized it as well.
“ALL WHAT?” both Rose and Hagrid yelled. Rose figured Petunia wouldn’t tell him about magic, but to not even tell him about his parents? “Now wait jus’ one second!” Hagrid continued. He boomed with anger, nearly shaking the hut. Rose stayed back with Harry, knowing that if anyone insulted magic in any way connected to Dumbledore, Hagrid would have a fit. And have a fit he did. Rose’s nephew muttered about his good marks in math. Rose snorted.
Harry averted his eyes. "Clumsy bumps that didn't heal right," he said, then brought a hand up to his necklace as it radiated warmth.
Just as Draco was about to say more, their compartment door opened. In it stood a redheaded boy, though his hair was more orange than Rose's red, and a girl with bushy, untamable brown hair that reminded him of his own. The ginger sneered at them none too subtly.
Rose jerked a nod and walked to her desk. "Yeah, you probably don't want to use the quill and parchment for anything but school. The price on those have gone up for whatever reason, I can't fathom it." She opened the top drawer and revealed a stack of plain white paper; she took one sheet and plucked a pen from the cup on the desktop. "Here you go, Harry. I hope you like the bread when it comes out, it's a white loaf with some rosemary sprinkled in."
On this side, there was so much more traffic. People dashing to and fro, yelling about clothes and pets and whatnot. The train itself was a brilliant red, looking shiny and new even though it had to be running for such a long time. There were several families and students Rose recognized, as she had been teaching for 10 years, and even former students bringing their own children. She spotted Lucius and Narcissa just leaving and kneeled beside Harry.
"Thank you," he said again, and Rose wrapped her arm around his shoulders.

Harry sat at the table with his face cast downwards. "I actually have the same owl I had twenty years ago," Rose spoke softly.
“You never told him?” At first he was quiet, but then his anger built up, “Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left for him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! And you kept it from him all these years?”

Harry was going to have an
It was nearing dinner time when Harry's things were all unpacked and his closet ready. The spell was fairly simple and Harry managed to cast it once to switch from Muggle to Wizard before deciding quietly that he should get another wand. His room felt more like
"This is amazing," Harry breathed, and Rose smiled.
Seeing Harry walk in with Draco set her mind at ease just a bit, enough so that her shoulders relaxed. The crowd of First years creeped closer in anticipation as Minerva stepped up to the stool with the Sorting Hat. He sang his song as he did every year, and the children clapped. One by one, the eleven-year-olds were sorted.
. "A what?" he asked, more confused.
"And you're sure you don't want me to come and pick you up from your Aunt's?"
Rose laughed. "Yes, I suppose that's true. I'm closer with my magic than most people. Twins are a very magical thing, did you know? And Magic is very patient, working in strange ways. I've noticed myself getting stronger every year since Lily was murdered, and I long for the day to avenge her. But, for now," she glanced at Harry and gave him a smile, "I will do good by her through you, Haythim James Potter. My nephew."
"Ready?" Rose asked. Harry gave a smile similar to her smirk, and they ran into the pillar and through the barrier.
Rose flopped herself onto her large black leather sofa and sighed. Really, what was she doing with her life? Sure, the dragons were pretty, but she felt like she didn’t belong there. In the back of her house was where she belonged, with her potions table and room for practicing spells. She tossed her black bag off to the side and stood up, leaving her coat on the leather. She was heading towards the kitchen to fix up some soup when there was a crashing sound in her living room.
To which his aunt replied, "It's Yule, Remus. Do shut up and accept the gift."
The morning was spent in the practice room, Rose teaching Harry the theory of some of the spells he wanted to learn until they picked up his second wand. After lunch, Harry went back to his room to work on his Charms homework. After nearly an hour of working, he smelled something lovely. It was a warm, comforting smell he hadn't experienced before. He stood from his desk and ruffled Hedwig's feathers before venturing out into the kitchen. Rose was humming as she glided around the kitchen, and bowls and towels covered the counter. Something was in the oven making that wonderful smell.

on it and enlarged it slightly before gathering Hermione's kinky curls and tying it back in a half bun. "It's imperative that those with long hair keep it tied back when they brew. There are too many potions and poisons that can be created with a single strand of hair. If anyone has need of hair ties or does not know the spells to keep hair back, please see me after class." She turned back to the Gryffindor. "You're potion is looking great, Hermione, best of the First-years. Five points to Gryffindor."
After Rose had done what she needed, she let out a sigh. She feared her letter to Amelia Bones was a bit too emotional. Taking another calming breath, she Apparated to Hogsmeade and started her trek to the castle to settle a few more things before the feast. Her hair bounced about her wildly with her conflicting emotions, so she sighed and fiddled with the Garnet stud in her left ear. When she reached her quarters, she felt more at peace. On her bed sat Mewt, playing with a loose thread hanging from her comforter.
The silver tree would have been buried with presents were it sitting on the floor; even so, the stack nearly touched the floating trunk. Rose was still sleeping in bed ( probably, and probably from too much wine--Uncle Vernon was the same way ) so Harry wasn't going to touch any of them yet, but he did look at the senders. There were his dormmates and other Slytherin friends, and the Gryffindors Hermione and the Weasley twins. And in front of all of them, in a small purple box tied with a black ribbon, was one from Aunt Rose. It made Harry smile stupidly for a few minutes as he relished in the fact that he had family who
"Our favorite Defense teacher!"
Dumbledore dismissed her words. “Nonsense! You’d fit in just fine.” His smile was reassuring, but Rose still had her doubts. She thought it over, and knew that her life right now was not very exciting. Hogwarts was full of magic and talent and … happiness. Something else was bothering him, though, and she knew it.
“Er-no,” Harry said, shocking Hagrid. Rose, however, already speculated this. “Sorry,” he added after seeing Hagrid’s face.
Poppy gaped for a moment before nodding. "Should I also be looking for signs of, erm,
And a good Slytherin never ignored a possibility.
with Rose? That was … it was …
The scene he was greeted with when he returned from the loo was seared behind his eyes for years to come.
Rose nodded with a healthy amount of hesitation. Yeah, sure. She could help Harry brew some potions. Severus told her that he was a very attentive student and took meticulous notes during lectures. The latter she knew, having seen him in her own class ( and knowing without a doubt that Draco looked over his notes, as it showed in his own work ). If Harry had a passion for it she'd let him experiment. She could make a list of the potions she normally supplied Victor's and supervise him. "Okay. I'll let you in tomorrow and we can brew all day." The grin that overcame her nephew's face was worth any accident probable to happen.
But Rose shook her head and placed a curled hand on her hip. "No, I have
She watched him like Snape watched Longbottom in Potions, though with less disgust and more anxiety, as he picked up the small purple box; the anxiety had appeared when he'd unboxed the Dreamless Sleep and persisted like Ripper with a bone. The black ribbon unraveled with a gentle touch and the box unfolded. Harry smiled at it and vowed he would never tire of magic, especially minor occurrences such as this. Inside the box laid what looked like a camera. Harry lifted the maybe-camera and sought Rose's eyes again.
They began a routine of nodding to each other when either would sit at the table, and slowly began enjoying the other's presence, even acknowledging each other during class. They started to talk about things other than homework and classes, and Granger became Hermione. She was a delight to talk to about nearly anything, even if she had a headstrong and brash approach to dealing with problems. Harry countered by suggesting she hex Ronald for his snide comments. Their friendship became something dear to both of them.
Ronald's excited smile turned into a frown and he left, stomping down the corridor. The girl looked after him before glancing back to Harry and Draco, but then she left as well. Harry let out a breath he didn't realize he was holding.
"Are you alright, Severus?"
"Mornin', Muffin. Sleep well?" she asked, voice still laced with sleep. Harry nodded. His room here held a sense of peace that the Slytherin dorm didn't, and he wasn't borderline afraid to sleep like back at Number Four. Rose smiled warmly at him as she sipped her coffee. "Good. You hungry yet?" Harry shook his head this time, but his stomach betrayed him. He didn't feel hungry, but he supposed his stomach had a different opinion. Thankfully, Rose just laughed softly. "Toast, then? Maybe some fruit?" She had noticed him going for that the most at breakfast, mostly at Draco and Blaise's subtle urging. Harry nodded again and pulled out one of the chairs at the island, but donned a contemplative look and ran back to his room.
Draco winced minutely when Rose addressed him properly. All of the professors did, but Rose was the only one who made a point of being friendly with all the students. Harry managed to lift Granger up and they all stood in front of the Defense witch.
Harry bit his lip, suddenly more nervous. He knew it was because he'd worked himself up, so he took a deep breath. Rose said it was safe to open. One hand reached out for the twine, trembling. A short pull had it coming loose, and the paper fell apart. Out of the package spilled a soft, silvery cloth that he could see through.

The Potions master grunted. "Must have sprained my ankle or similar. I am fine."
And as he slipped from the smoke that thinned with each passing hour, he heard them speak in unison.
she realized it was nearly lunch time, so she left her other robes on her bed and walked to the Great Hall.
"And of course, this is my Assistant Professor Quirrell that our headmaster has graced me with. If you have any questions after class or while doing homework, do not hesitate to ask either of us." Rose sent a sarcastic smile at the man before turning back to the class, where half of whom could mostly see her irritation as their parents were also Slytherins who acted much the same.
, and decided to have a coffee with caramel. It was still pretty early, so she decided to enjoy the morning before getting Harry. She figured she would take her nephew to the bank to get his muggle money converted to knuts, sickles, and galleons, plus whatever Lily and James had left him.
"Indeed. I'll take the pudding and get Snape back to Hogwarts. I'm sure your aunt will be fine, though." Remus drained his glass and took it back to the kitchen manually, then managed to tap Snape's shoulder without being glared at. The Potions Master stood with one last sigh in Rose's face and left his glass on the coffee table, and took his gift. Remus had in his hands the Shrunken box of leftover bread pudding and his potions and gently led Snape to the door, where he would Apparate said man to Hogwarts.
Harry remembered that Rose wore earrings and nodded to himself.
fyi: all seven books will compile into this one story
Rose hummed, pointer finger stroking her chin. "It's December, so something warm and filling …" She wandered back into the kitchen and started rummaging, so Harry hung his cloak over the back of the desk chair, looking around the (
His grin faltered for a moment as he shook his head. Rose nodded, then walked inside, allowing Harry to shut the front door for her.
"Put it on, put it on!" Harry smiled at his friend - he hoped he could call Draco his friend - and opened the box. Despite having all those pendants, the necklace itself was small. The crystals were contained in tiny silver cages and the rosewood twine was thin. It was so very beautiful that Harry hesitated putting it on. He'd never had anything like it to call his own, and it seemed like it had cost a lot of money. Then Harry shook his head. This was a new life, one filled with magic and hopefully devoid of any Dursleys. Harry removed the necklace from the box with with hands that only trembled slightly and frowned at the tiny clasp.
"Is that when my dad and his friends became Animagi?"
Snape's robes were pulled back and Harry saw a nasty bite that spanned most of his lower leg. Harry was confused. Where would Snape have gotten a bite like that?
Miss Granger for earning your house points." She stalked towards the boy. "Apologize, and thank her.
"Yes, it is. Severus and I have been coming here every year since we started teaching and performing the ritual on Halloween night. It corresponds with a certain Magical holiday and tradition, something a lot of old Pureblood families do, but it's not practiced as much anymore." She pulled off her hat and toed off her boots, and set them on a stool that appeared just so before sitting down at one of the points of the inner triangle, legs bent beneath her. She patted the floor. "Sit, please."
"Why are you sitting with me?" she asked him as September ended.
Hagrid took Harry shopping for more supplies, and Rose trailed behind them carrying bags. She particularly laughed when Harry was looking through books; he said he wanted to curse Dudley. In the current circumstances, she was sure Harry would be a Slytherin, like her, but she briefly wondered if he would follow in his parents' footsteps. He seemed quiet and reserved. Now they were in the wand shop, and Olivander was acting more cryptic than usual.
Startled, she made her way back, only to see her old professor, Albus Dumbledore. She was surprised, mainly because in the few years after she graduated, she hadn’t gotten a visit from anyone from her class or her old professors. “Rose, I just dropped in to say hello,” the old man said with a twinkle in his eye.
before they gave him to Rose with no hesitation. Rose inhaled deeply before letting the breath out slowly, calming herself. There would be words,
Rose watched with kind eyes as Hagrid reached into his pocket to produce a cake for Harry. Harry was beside himself. “Who are you?” he asked. Rose frowned as Hagrid laughed beside her. He introduced himself as Keeper of Keys and Grounds of Hogwarts. When Harry’s eyes turned to her, she raised her brows. “And you?”
Dumbledore grew quiet. Yes, he had something to tell her, something dire indeed. “It seems that Voldemort is gone.” Rose was astonished. Really? After all this time? “But, this came at a great cost.”
Harry glanced away but Rose did not look convinced. "Are you sure? Will you permit me to take a look?"
"Erm, Professor?" Angélica Fuentes, the youngest in her NEWT class as a Sixth-year Hufflepuff, called. "You seem to have something in your hood."
Harry and Draco shared a look. Retirement?
Harry did so, hovering his right hand over the rack as Rose handed his wand back to him. Nothing really reacted to his magic until the very last piece, which was colored a light yellow-grey. "Oak." Mordre nodded and plucked it from the case, then waved her hand again to produce three different bowls of jewels. "Put your hand in and choose the one that reacts to you." Harry dipped his hand into the first bowl, in which several of the gems stung and burned him and he suppressed the urge to hiss. He managed to close his fingers around one and pulled it out, procuring a clear green gem. Mordre gingerly removed it from his hand with a mutter of, "Prasiolite." The second bowl had no painful burning sensations, but it was hard to get a grip on a gem. Eventually he clasped his hand around one and brought it back out, revealing a teal piece of crystal tinged with brown. "Zircon," the owner nodded and took it from him. The last bowl was the easiest to sift through, and he pulled out a piece of tourmaline that had clear stripes of blue, green, and pink. "Elbaite Tourmaline."
"Absolutely! Get the
"What were your best scores?" Harry asked before he could stop himself, grimacing a little afterwards. Rose waved off his worries.
“DURSLEY!” Hagrid exploded. He glared angrily at Vernon before looking back to Harry, looking how Rose felt. “But, you must know about your mum and dad. I mean, they’re
Harry found out crying was entirely possible in the visions.
Severus snorted. "No, not to my knowledge. Though it does seem rather peculiar that he would hire someone for the position you had contemplated retiring from, though you never explicitly said you would be. Even more so is that Quirrell was previously in charge of Muggle Studies."
hated magic, as she was the only one of you that couldn't perform or sense any." The soothing motion of sweeping through her hair set to tire Rose. "Besides, the young Draco Malfoy is my godson and the headmaster has not said anything to me." He didn't say anything about the fact that it was Dumbledore who placed Harry with the Dursleys in the first place, nor that Rose had all but begged the old man to keep him in the magical world.
