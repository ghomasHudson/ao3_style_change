Harry had foolishly thought that stopping everything with Malfoy was going to be beneficial on his side because he could focus on himself and his relationship with Ginny.
“Unfortunately, without supporting evidence, we can only assume this possibility but aside from the fact that the potion is extremely complicated to make, it is indeed likely that a student managed to get one and get it into the castle.”
Harry opened his mouth and took out his tongue to pass through Malfoy’s lips and embrace his. Malfoy let him do it with a fleeting appetite and tightened his hand on his neck to bring him closer.
Harry felt his stomach contract at the sight of Malfoy spitting out his smoke. He stopped eating when Malfoy stared at him and a strange smile stretched his lips. A particular smile that Harry couldn’t decipher. His eyes, however, seemed to probe his soul and he felt like he was completely naked, suddenly.
He was about to drink another sip of his beverage when a small group passed by his side accidentally rushing him.
“I’m not very hungry.” he groaned, aware that this was not a sufficient explanation for her to drop so easily. However, he had no other answer to give her, not really having the desire to justify himself.
“It’s true, I don’t know much about it, but this mark proves that he owned you... And that’s enough for me to recognize an enemy.” Harry replied.
“I have vaguely been able to see it, yeah…” he mumbled, as he crossed his arms on his chest, the discomfort again present in his voice.
The last two times he had Side-Along with Malfoy had been a torment for all his senses, his body reacting totally disproportionately to his contact.
Ginny hadn’t noticed, though. His attitude must have seemed natural enough to her that she didn’t notice how much he had forced himself to keep in mind that he was with her and not with Malfoy while he caressed and kissed her woman’s body.
Harry lifted up one of his arms and grabbed the fine fingers between his own. His heart missed a beat when he felt the texture of his skin burning his own at that touch.
Harry had his breath cut off, his bowels torn to shreds and tried not to let glimpse the evil that gnawed at him from the inside. His breathing had been irreparably accelerated, and he suddenly became aware of the world around him.
When he reached the last step of the stands, he passed in front of Noah, bashing himself aloud with his own bullshit.
He blinked his eyes before placing them on the glass in front of him and encircling it with his hand. He observed the honey-coloured liquid inside and drowned in the contemplation of the different hue curves that turned tirelessly like the course of his thoughts.
Ron and Ginny had gone to visit their brother George at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes shop and Hermione had insisted heavily that they take advantage of reviewing their respective last courses.
So he maximized his chances to keep Harry from coming back. If the fact that he did not remember anything for ten years made him feel like to have a dagger in the heart, to imagine him killing himself by destroying the rest was all the more painful.
Draco was still lost in his thoughts when he saw Blaise passing by their table, a glass in his hand.
He felt himself pale and it must be seen because Hermione rose suddenly by calling Mrs Pomfrey with a loud voice.
Manipulating elementary spells required high concentration. If the mind accidentally ventured too far from its goal, it was easy to lose control and pay the consequences. Harry had just discovered it to his dismay.
“I’m sorry to get to this, and believe me when I tell you it hurts me, but I have no choice…You really need to calm down, Har… Potter” he blew.
Draco’s heart pounded too hard in his chest, his erratic breath, passing through the barriers of his lips as he gathered the last information of their sudden altercation.
He repressed a suffocated sob which made his body flinch and raised his hand to wipe away the trace of his weakness by sniffing. He then raised his eyes to the sky to restrain the last tears that obscured his sight. He brought back the few strands of blond hair that had fallen off behind his ear and breathed long to give himself the courage to stand up and face the rest of the day.
“As you said, we can’t go any further as long as we have obligations.” he explained, “And uh… Well, I’ll explain to her that I can’t marry her. Not after what just happened.” he added, feeling his heart tighten.
Harry saw him think very strongly, but his wand remained firmly in his hand. His friend sighed with despair and glanced at Harry who smiled at him.
Maybe he was about to set some traps that Harry and his classmates would find the next morning when he came out of the portrait?
From the corner of his eye, he saw Malfoy having a slight startle and turned his eyes towards him. He was frowning at the book.
Yes, but that was the point. His family was currently unavailable, settling formalities in different countries to ensure that their names are not removed from the list of guests for the upcoming holidays.
“Can you avoid talking with your mouth full Ronald, it’s particularly annoying!” Hermione winced, staring at him with deep disgust.
He quickly slipped under his cover and closed his eyes. He opened them immediately when Malfoy’s smile passed under his closed eyelids and he turned over on his back, sighing.
Harry felt pale at the possibility that one of the Gryffindor’s was angry enough to want to push him away.
“I wish I could, but I already have an evening planned with my Quidditch team…” Ginny replied, embarrassed, looking at Harry.
Harry turned his head to the enchanted coffee pot and noticed that his coffee was already ready. He went straight ahead to get his cup and fell back on the table, one hand holding the handle during the other landed on his forehead.
“Wait, I don’t understand what we’re doing here exactly? You wanted me to stop so that’s what I did and now you’re asking me why I didn’t continue?” he replied, puzzled.
When he woke up the next day, the nausea had finally passed had resumed. He’d been dreaming about Malfoy all night and never getting rid of him. As if his subconscious wanted to kill him with a peroxidised blond.
“I think that’s true, Ron, other than the fact that he’s immersed himself in a passion for illicit substances, he hasn’t made any disparaging remarks to me since I’ve been here. He even greeted me this morning when I ran into him on my way out of class,” replied Hermione, with a hearing look.
His best friends on the wizarding portrait, the trophies of the team of Quidditch on the library of the welcoming lounge next to the fireplace with moulded edges.
“What, it’s not clear enough? You got what you wanted, it’s my turn now” Harry incited, opening his zipper.
When Ron opened the door, Harry passed in front of him, sketching a friendly smile, taking the way to the showers in order to relax and calm the fury that slowly seized him.
Harry’s mind started wavering again. Being close to Malfoy was really not a good idea. Especially when he started to look at him like that. And that asshole kept going. Malfoy passed his tongue on his lips before biting the one at the bottom, giving him a hot glance.
“No thanks, Ron and I are going to our room, have a good night” Harry hissed without turning around.
He explored the dark walls where a few torches scattered a bluish light that hardly reflected on the cold stone surrounding the room. The offices were of a wood as black as the rest of the furniture, as if the colour was banned in this section.
He was particularly relieved not to see their face surely worried about his condition which he imagined quite pitiful at that moment.
Malfoy lowered one of his hands down and proceeded to unbutton Harry’s pants, unwrapping his belt first. Harry tensed up, understanding Malfoy’s intention. He quickly placed one of his hands on Malfoy’s wrist to stop him. Malfoy released his wrist and grabbed Harry’s hand to interlace his fingers with his own before placing it on one of his own hips. He then released it and undertook to definitely unbutton Harry’s belt before removing the buttons from his pants. Harry tried again to prevent him from going further but Malfoy was faster and plunged his hand in the pants to go and touch his sex.
He felt that he could at any time break down the barriers he was supposed to erect around him to master his magic.
He smiled, relieved to have recovered so quickly a bit of his voice which seemed to no longer work yesterday.
He repressed a reflex, stopping his hand when he raised it to put the label of his t-shirt back inside.
"Yes! You have to go out for a bit and then you’re not going to let me go alone, are you?" Ron added without waiting for Harry’s answer.
He then sat down in a classy manner, before opening one of the folders placed on the table, turning a page that he browsed, no longer seeming to pay attention to him.
The whistling of the kettle becoming more strident, Draco closed his eyes, remembering the sensation of Harry’s wet mouth running through his body, his tongue tracing his muscles, going down dangerously to his belly, biting his belly button.
All three recognized Ginny who waved to them with a wink and gave her a standing ovation by shouting her name. The students positioned themselves in the air, grabbing their brooms and once everyone was ready, the referee hissed the start of the game.
Draco had known, from the moment he had passed the threshold of this door, that the young wizard therapist would not reveal anything to him about the consultation of Potter. However, that did not prevent him from hoping that he would break the rules for an old acquaintance like him.
Harry had tried to swallow every trace of this vile and primitive feeling which his head had then made germinate into him in recent days, without ever being able to achieve it…
“Merlin, I can’t believe I’m going to say this, but Granger is absolutely right. It took me almost a week to get it to change shape and almost three to make it automatic.” he explained, in a particularly serious way.
“Let’s just say I do have a vague idea of what brings me the honor of your being in this office. But you know me, I would never dare say anything without being quite sure” he had noticed.
Harry glanced at Malfoy, who nodded, confirming that he could go. Harry stood up, stalking the young woman, before stopping and turning to see that Malfoy wasn’t following them.
But the Aurors district had specifically asked that one of their recruits be dedicated to them to diagnose the victims of advanced spells and more precisely of black magic.
Harry turned to one of the cabinets to detail it, going through the different vials where labels indicated a keyword of the memory they contained.
All that tingling reminded him that he was alive. And it was Malfoy who made him feel all this, it was Malfoy who instilled this feeling in him and he loved it.
He could only glimpse the young woman moving away, from the corner of his eye, while Potter's round glasses crashed into his cheekbones painfully.
He blocked Malfoy’s arms on both sides of his face, without stopping the kiss and devoured his mouth with passion. Malfoy moved under him, rubbing their erections against each other and making them moan.
They went down to Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures where his best friend and Ron’s fiancée worked.
“It’s not your fault if he likes to meddle in other people’s business…” he mumbled, mixing his food with his fork.
He nevertheless took the trouble to remove his glasses this time, delicately placing them on the night table before dropping his head against his pillow. He turned his eyes to the door, just in case the silhouette with Malfoy’s perfume had the idea of coming back to see him and fell asleep in just a few seconds at that last thought.
Draco sniffed before taking a look at Harry, who stared at Blaise, squinting his eyes, visibly suspicious.
The crockery parts became totally motionless and silent, as Harry turned his palms toward the sky and stared at them in a panicked look. He remained frozen for a few moments to contemplate them. His lips and fingertips were covered with slight tremors, before he finally turned his hands over and slowly laid them flat on the table.
His old friend materialized immediately, his large woods and his vaporous silhouette got closer to him majestically, staring at him with his small piercing eyes.
Malfoy did not reply at once, leaving doubt to the end. Harry’s heart exploded against the walls of his chest, his fingernails sticking into the palms of his hands as all of his muscles painfully contracted.
“I fully understand that you want to know, but this is far too sensitive a subject for me to dare to address. I’m afraid it will cause an adverse reaction to your memory and make things worse.” He explained.
“And I say it’s past all that, you’d better focus on your studies rather than belabour the fact that Draco Malfoy has changed or not. Besides, I’m going to go, I’m exhausted and I still have a chapter of law to read for tomorrow”, Hermione blew up on his way out.
Harry turned to the left and went in front of the list of students hanging on the front door of the building. This time, Malfoy’s name was on it. He then entered the hall, went up the stairs to the indicated floor and arrived at the landing where Malfoy was staying.
“Thank you Blaise, it’s obvious that I needed someone to remind me how much I was a fan of this kind of occupation” Draco jeered, with his dragging voice while grinning of his former comrade.
Harry, who felt exhaustion catching up with him, could only blink to try to keep himself awake, unable to make the slightest movement to prevent him from leaving. He dropped himself heavily on the bed, dropping the sheets he had barely held on, and fixed the white ceiling with an absent air.
It was not for her that he shouted, but for Malfoy… He had a hard time concentrating again, but he had finally managed to do it… His thoughts for Malfoy disgusted him, but Harry realized that deep down, he wanted him.
A heavy silence settled between them, while Draco had not detached his eyes from photography, a bitter smile drawing on his lips. He glanced at Harry, noticing that he had also laid his eyes on the frame.
He was convinced that thanks to him, Harry would manage to relax his mind enough so that he could recover his memories without any problems. Because it was complicated to get everything all at once. Especially when the number of years was so high. And ten years of Potter’s life was way more than anyone else on this bloody planet.
Harry couldn’t help but look at him, with a tender smile stretching his lips in front of Malfoy’s frown.
The wizard therapist blinked for a moment, observing the effects of his flow on the various elements, strangely excited.
Ron gave him a smile before backing down and leaning over the table to pick up one of the cookies on a pretty plate with aristocratic patterns.
Seeing that it would not leave, he sighed and imbued himself with his feeling, his heart beating louder in his chest and cast the spell again, opening his eyes.
When he climbed into the elevator shaft, his heart was horribly heavy, and his throat was tightly squeezed. He had not yet pressed the button on his floor and was contemplating the dark and bright corridor of the Department of Mysteries. The torches diffused their bluish light which reflected on the whole of the walls with a hypnotizing side.
He thoroughly flushed out the hemoglobin that was rapidly escaping from his wound before continuing to wash to erase the last traces of his thoughts.
Draco blinked, feeling Potter’s hands all over him, catching, and pinching every inch of his skin. Harry seemed on fire against him, his sudden gestures uncertain, exploring his body to get to know him, redrawing his muscles irregularly, like a simple novice. And that’s when he realized he was.
“Fuck, Malfoy! Do you realize that I lost ten years of memories?! Ten fucking years of my life! I land here, my best friends get married, I did not become Auror as I had promised myself and I am taught that I live with my second worst enemy?! Can’t you see how laughable this situation is?!” He shouted, making great movements of his arms.
Harry took the opportunity to quickly put his clothes back on and rose from bed, his heart beating with his own revelation.
Harry sighed with spite and finally nodded from the chin before following them into the living room.
It had not been easy to temper him, but he had finally succeeded and Malfoy almost threw himself on Harry to kiss him wildly while removing his clothes.
Draco could feel Harry’s jerky breath rippling off his cheek. He had difficulty swallowing while his muscles tightened under his touch. Potter’s eyes were always tightly closed, as if he did not accept his gesture enough to confront it.
“For fuck’s sake, Malfoy doesn’t make me drag you here!” Harry exploded, his patience disappeared immediately after his last remark.
“Mr. Malfoy quickly told me about your long-term memory problem, do you confirm what he said?” She asked in a serious tone.
Harry jolted, acknowledging the tone of that voice between a thousand and turned his head sharply in his direction.
He remembered accurately the nights when he thought he would throw them at Potter's face the next day when he would meet him at the corner of a hallway or during the classes they would have in common. He used to recite insults with his dragging tone, excelling particularly in the art of handling sarcasm with brilliance.
“This is the beauty of this potion, Harry. It uses your deepest desires hidden deep inside you to make them real and live them to the fullest.”
Harry turned his head towards Malfoy, who was staring at him, with a slight smile on the corner of his lips. He felt blush by this more than explicit glance. Harry knew very well why Malfoy looked at him in this way.
“No Harry. I don’t think Voldemort was behind this idea. Also, all Death Eaters are actively sought after and none can get close enough to Hogsmeade without being immediately intercepted.” Dumbledore replied, in a tone that was intended to be reassuring but that only accentuated the fear that seized his body as well as his mind.
Harry frowned, anger mingled with tiredness as he gradually realized that he was going to have to wait an indefinite time before getting his fucking answers.
“Never again do I want to relive such a thing, even the war seemed sweeter next to what Mom put me through…” He then turned to Harry and looked him in the eye.
“Astoria Greengrass, she was with us at Hogwarts, but not from our class. “Her sister is Daphne Greengrass, one of the stuck-up that hung around with Parkinson’s all the time.” Dean added, nodding his head at her.
Without a word more, Blaise went into the fireplace and left where he came from, leaving him alone in the living room still a little stunned by their last exchange.
He unbuttoned the bottle and swallowed a sip of a bitter orange liquid that engulfed the entire trachea, like a protective shield sticking against its walls.
“I understand, but it’s up to you to be smarter and let him make a fool of himself, we’re adults now...” Hermione nodded.
“But how can I calm down?! Fuck, no, I can’t take this crap anymore, I need some fresh air, I’m going to see Ron, whatever Hermione says, I can probably help them." Harry answered as he rose, heading for the exit.
“Yeah… Speaking of which, as I explained to Draco, I have some important news to tell you.” He exclaimed, in a deep voice.
Draco swallowed with difficulty, thinking back to the hateful and disgusting glances that Harry had constantly put on him, hurting him a little more every time he met his eyes.
He had always thought that Blaise was trying to looks like him in order to take his place among their fellow men, wanting at all costs to crush him in order to form an image of a powerful prince that no one could dethrone.
“I think we have to leave the past behind, if you want my opinion, let him move on its own, you can’t blame him because he’s trying to make up for his mistakes.” Hermione sighted.
Then after what seemed like an eternity, he sat on the sofa, his elbows on his thighs, his hands rising up along his face. He looked exhausted, overwhelmed by all the information.
Maybe Malfoy really liked him? He himself found his company rather pleasant when they did not spend their time insulting each other.
Malfoy then raised his eyes very slowly and plunged them into his own. They seemed veiled by desire as his chest rose and lowered in a sustained rhythm and his warm breath crushed on the bottom of his face until caressing his lips.
They kept moving and passed the shop of Florean Fortescue where Malfoy promised to stop there after having recovered his various ingredients.
Raising a sceptical eyebrow, Draco followed the path of his thought and scrutinized his own hand before realizing that a stain of blood was spreading between his fingers and slowly widening. A slight tingling inside his palm confirmed that he had undoubtedly cut himself when he struck his hand on the table to stop Potter’s drift. He turned his hand to expose it to the sky and noticed some pieces of glass inlaid in his flesh, in the middle of a small bloody circle.
Harry opened his mouth to ask what kind of work he was doing before raising his eyebrows when the answer came, evident in his mind.
Those spells were derivatives of the magic they knew. But the most complicated, remained to invoke it. If the basic spells they had learned during their years at Hogwarts seemed easy to them, elemental magic was even more powerful and required much more training and practice.
“Don’t forget your gloves, it would be a shame to realize that you didn’t have them when you got home, it will be difficult to explain” Malfoy said to him, making a gesture from the chin to them.
Harry opened the door wide and got ready to go out, his head firmly lowered on his feet when his eyes met a pair of painted shoes.
. He wanted to feel what effect he was producing at Malfoy, who pushed him to seduce him in this way. Harry had thought of nothing else since the last time, he had not stopped remembering Malfoy’s cock, which trembled in his hands and Malfoy, which gasped under his wrist strokes.
As he swallowed the last spoon of whipped cream, Harry felt Ginny’s hand move on his thigh, moving slowly inward and he hurried to tighten his legs to prevent it from going any further. Harry turned his head towards her, and she glared at him. She wanted him, and obviously she wanted him now.
“He’s an asshole, but he’s not inherently bad.... If he really was, he would have delivered me without hesitation when we showed up at his manor last year... Remember”
Malfoy’s hand accelerated a little more, forcing on Harry’s wrist while biting his lower lip in a roar. Harry let it happen, taking pleasure in feeling Malfoy so hard between his fingers.
As far back as he could remember, Harry had never felt anything for a boy and had never kissed any of them. He opened his eyes to this last thought which seemed to float before him.
After having devastated part of the living room, he felt a little better, adrenaline slowly leaving his body having again lost his means.
She uttered a little cry but Harry was already beginning to come and go in her. He needed it, he had to wash his mind of his impure thoughts that had not left him in the last two days. Then he hit Ginny’s pelvis again and again, whimpering louder and faster, moaning too. And when he no longer had the strength to restrain himself, he came and fell heavily upon her.
“Look mate, I’m telling you this because I noticed that you two were less together, I’m just worried.”
The Room of Requirement had been the landmark of Dumbledore’s army where Harry and his friends had secretly studied the Defense Against the Dark Arts, much like the most useless Umbridge’s courses, allowing them to perfect themselves in different spells.
“Far be it from me to put an end to this particularly touching painting, but I think Hermione is waiting for you to clean up the rest of the decoration” he intervened with his dragging voice.
“Well, I think it’s time to start this session, we have about thirty minutes before the end of this one, our lovely reunion having taken up the rest of the time. If you’ll settle in, please” Nott announced, glancing at the clock on his wall before pointing his hand at the small corner near the fireplace.
“Although I wouldn’t have used such a strong vocabulary, it’s very close to what I have in mind.” he replied, before licking his lips and looking down on the table to contain his sneer.
Draco blinked once leaving a single tear rolling along his pale cheek until reaching one of the corners of his lips. He swallowed painfully before opening his mouth slightly and the salty liquid seeped into his mouth and touched his tongue.
“A simple precaution, in the event that your trauma is far too great to contain,” he explained, ironically.
Some students who were not far away turned their heads toward them with a suspicious air. The music did not completely cover their boiling.
“Far be it from me to make you wait longer, it’s not every day that I have the visit of two of my former comrades, the most famous of all Hogwarts! In our time, at least” he had hissed, interleaving his fingers.
He looked at Ginny and smiled. He never thought they would get back together. It was done naturally, the day after the macabre day, especially for the Weasley family with Fred’s death.
However, he did not understand what he was still doing here. He didn’t remember sleeping in his bed.
“I don’t know, Harry, I also think he’s changed, he’s not as dumb as he used to be, he seems more detached” Ginny said, thinking.
Everything happened very quickly, Harry made a quick move but Draco had seen it coming. His impulsivity is no longer a secret to him, after so many years spent around him.
His eyelids pounded frantically as Malfoy’s expert mouth rose and descended on his sex. He rolled up his foreskin, which pounded against the roof of Malfoy’s mouth, and put shivers on him that wound up in his whole body.
“I’m about to contact your friends through the floo, maybe you’ll listen to them,” he explained without bothering to turn around.
Harry had developed a dangerous addiction for Malfoy, or else Malfoy exercised a power far too present for his mental balance and feelings.
He waited until his heart beat slowed before going to wash. His whole body was so sensitive, that the water almost hurt him when he felt it flowing. Harry closed his eyes and let the hot liquid wash his body, which he had soiled, with all these impure thoughts.
Harry hurried so he wouldn’t have to face the people who made them. But to his great dismay, his ill-placed curiosity failed to stop him from leaving a glance at the noises that were becoming more and more explicit as he advanced.
"Where’s your redhead, Potter? Did you lose her while you were dancing?" Malfoy asked in a mocking manner.
Malfoy’s fingers ran higher on his belly and he held a moan in his throat, because his fingers were soft and he felt his skin shiver under their touch.
Harry and Ron were therefore in front of the shop when George opened the doors of his small personal palace.
Malfoy wore only a simple black shirt, the first buttons of which were open, revealing his neck and the top of his pale bust. Black pants, perfectly fitting his legs in a straight cut. A few strands of hair fell before his steel-grey eyes, which expressed nothing particular. His lips were pinched in a bitter line as he observed it, seeking to understand why Harry was standing there.
He stowed it in his trouser pocket and tried to Side-Along in turn for “the Barrow” where he was sure to find someone to help him.
Harry had almost forgotten how much he hated him after he had a better version of him. This one had nothing to do with the Malfoy he was looking at. Features drawn from his face with the hard and icy gaze.
Harry was trembling with anticipation. He was afraid... afraid of what his body would be able to do. He was terrified of the way he would react to him. Until now, he had never felt anything but anger towards Malfoy. Until then he had only trembled with rage in his presence. He didn’t understand when this rage had turned into desire...
Draco was convinced that Harry had no intention of revealing his meeting with Theo and was determined to know the outcome. So he had went to his old classmate’s strange office and had knocked on the door. Theo’s voice had been heard behind the door, inviting him to enter and he had not been begged to do so.
“It’s my business, I don’t have to explain myself to you,” Harry jeered, turning completely to face him.
before this time” he promised, pulling on his pelvis to bring his legs back and block them against him.
One of the corners of Ron’s lips stretched out very slightly before it spread out to reveal his teeth.
Still shocked, he did not react immediately, but Harry retreated sharply, seeming totally disturbed by his growing desire. His face was pale and he gasped, while his whole body was filled with tremors.
He blinked and opened them abruptly when he fell on a silhouette lying beside him. The young man had the face of Malfoy, his soft and fine features, as well as the smell of his perfume.
Harry swallowed with difficulty, feeling uncomfortable that he has once again obstructed his loved ones' plans. It was always necessary for anything that affected him from near or far to affect his friends, who had paid the price many times.
Draco wasn’t quite sure, but he would have sworn that Harry had been shivering when he heard him talking. He was sure of this when he felt the goosebumps show up under his fingers, where his hand was always on Potter’s shoulder.
Harry was swallowing by tightening his fingers on the handle of his drink, determined not to look down. Malfoy nodded his chin, to which Harry replied, before heading for a table at an angle to the bar.
Before he definitively left his laboratory, he had looked up at the witch clock that had displayed 5:00 p.m., then had turned off the lights of the room to go to the Treatment of Spell Damage department to meet Theodore Nott.
Harry’s spirit was extinguished at that moment, letting a deep hatred take hold of him, seeing Malfoy respond to the kiss, moving his lips against those of the young man, holding him tighter against him.
Harry had never experienced anything like it, Malfoy was so exciting, his desire for him was beyond all comprehension and felt him there, everywhere on him, breaked down the barriers of his mind. He was no longer able to think anything, he seemed to have put his brain on standby, only his body was functioning, sinking into Malfoy’s body. Striking at the very bottom to touch a sensitive point that ripped away raucous screams at each breath between kisses.
He already saw the headlines spread on the cover of the newspapers in bold with a picture of him claiming “Harry Potter, saviour of the wizard world, leaves his fiancée just a month from their wedding”. He could imagine the sheer number of letters he would receive to get to the whole story…
Ginny was sitting next to him, tighter than necessary, one of her hands, lying chastely on his thigh.
Harry followed his long hands to straighten the sides of his cape so that they fully adhered to his robe and smooth the few folds that had formed there.
“No wait!” he blew hard, looking at the ground, “We can’t do that.” he added, raising his eyes, now very dark, to his own.
Malfoy swallowed as he stared with fright. The muscles of his jaw were contracting at times when he seemed to be looking for a plausible answer to give him.
Harry moaned against his lips, his breath suffocated inside Draco’s mouth, while his free hand found its way back to Draco’s belly and palpated his abs, the muscles contracting under his touch.
He tried to answer her, but the words died in the back of his throat, only to pull out a small sound strangled and he carried his hand to his neck by reflex.
Everyone started at him, seeming to want to get as far away from him as possible, even if it meant crossing the walls on which they leaned.
Draco slipped his own along the table, observing Potter’s emerging anxiety, and brought it back to his plate to grab the edges and continued his meal.
about Malfoy… Only Cho and Ginny brought that feeling to him a few years ago when he saw them on other guys' arms.
Frightened, he tried to rise up to get as far away from Malfoy as possible, looking for his wand which he had dropped while he was throwing up and pointed it back at him, trembling.
The beats of his heart beat in his chest, imagining Ron’s disgusted look if he heard that he was banging Malfoy while he was dating his sister…
“Yet I assure you that this is indeed the case…” Malfoy insisted, frowning, always looking at the book which he was trying in vain to get back to his hand.
“How is the sleeping beauty?” she sneered, before settling down on the chair where her brother had been an hour before.
A renewed hope filled Draco’s heart with these words and he could not prevent a slight grin, which he quickly swept before nodding.
“But honestly, it’s Malfoy... One of the most rotten guys we’ve ever met, I can’t imagine him having a conversation, don’t you think?” Ron added.
"Is this the report about the victim from the other night?" he asked, as if to change the subject when that was precisely why he had brought him here.
Harry let himself be done without flinching, groping his lips with small kisses, moving to the corner before tracing the line of his jaw down to his neck. Draco felt Harry’s tongue burn him there, then his teeth bite the fine skin, tearing away a new moan.
His throat was aching, his stomach was contracting dangerously. He had run too fast, without having eaten for a while.
Draco frowned, getting ready to retaliate but Harry was faster than him and turned his head to Page to thank her.
Harry squeezed his fists tighter, weighing the pros and cons, but ended up overtaking him, clenching his teeth, thus avoiding confrontation.
“We were never going to say anything. This is the fair return of things, Malfoy, I have done to you what you wanted, in my turn to enjoy it” he replied, sitting on Malfoy’s bed.
“Astoria likes to get my take on the dishes and cutlery we’ll be serving at the reception.” he explained, following the coffee slowly flowing into his cup with his eyes. He then stretched a slight smile and turned his eyes again to Harry. “And while I come from a family that cares, I can easily tell you that I don’t give a shit about how the guests will feed during the evening.”
He was reviewing the various notes his teammates had noted on a missing person’s case when a slight noise caused him to raise his head toward the door. A memo passed the threshold in a small whistle and flew to him before landing smoothly on his desk.
"No… Malfoy, come on, you can't be the only one who doesn't know about this! Not you!" he shouted, pointing him with his hand.
Back in the living room of their home, he let go of Harry who pushed him vehemently before heading for the fireplace, grabbing a handful of floo powder in the process.
“For what it’s worth, if you need to talk or just drown your grief in a good, pure fire whiskey, you know where to find me” he said, anchoring his black eyes in his owns
A splash made him turn his head towards his preparation to find that it had taken a carmine red color.
“Don’t be silly, why would I stoop to that while your friends are in the next room?” Malfoy retorted, exasperated.
“Your cheeky side is even more accentuated with screw loose, you had been a little calmer with the time. I feel like I’m back with the Potter of my childhood!” he noticed.
“Well, what’s the problem? You’re going to keep pissing me off or are you going to take care of my cock?” Harry shouted.
Slowly lowering his hand on his chin, revealing his half-open lips, he painfully closed his eyes to force himself not to panic.
He was dressed in a heavy plum robe that brought out his light grey eyes and almost white hair. He looked even bleaker with that hue, but it looked strangely good on him.
A bitter smile stretched Potter’s lips, as he lowered his eyes to his hands, the fingers of which he groped, still holding his glass.
He could not decently thank Malfoy for choosing these clothes, much less be grateful to him since they were pure enemies in his mind.
“My hidden desires…” He breathed for himself. “Wait, what I saw would be a reflection of what I really want to have? Kind of like the Mirror of Erised?” he asked.
His pleasure grew and his groans became more pressing. He saw Malfoy’s lips sketching his peculiar fucking smile that had taken possession of his mouth. He saw Malfoy’s wet fucking tongue turn and dance. His perfume, which he had sniffed, tickled his nostrils as he stroked.
Harry looked down at Malfoy’s body, noticing that one of his hands was firmly clenching the railing until the knuckles of his fingers were whitened. He frowned and slowly lifted his eyes up to his face to see that two light grey eyes were staring at him.
The laughter continued at the right table, and even though some of the gaps in history reached him to his ears, Harry was no longer quite sure he was still capable of smiling.
Harry saw Malfoy swallowing with difficulty, his Adam’s apple, rising up and descending in a slow rhythm while a glimmer of desire took place in his metallic eyes.
Harry was relieved without really knowing why. He felt Ginny’s hand pass through his hair and sighed of well-being on contact with the warmth of her fingers when she put them on his forehead.
“She confirmed everything you thought. The Obliviate, the Tempus, so that he only acts at one time of the day…” he started. He closed his eyes for a moment while sighing. “She also told me that I lived well
Harry had desperately tried to forget him and focus on Ginny, but even she, had failed to disgust him with Malfoy. Even she, had not succeeded in making him lose the desire that Harry felt for Malfoy.
Draco frowned again, squeezing his hand a little tighter on Harry’s shoulder, before he shuddered under the pressure of his fingers.
Neville nodded silently and then took another sip of his Butterbeer while Seamus frowned at Malfoy and his friends.
The trinket placed on his classroom table seemed to taunt him more than usual, almost exhausting his nerves already fried with too strong a sensitivity.
The next day, Harry woke up with difficulty. Visions of Malfoy in his head... He could still feel his lips on his own and Malfoy’s hand in his pants wanking him with application.
"You panicked?! Did YOU panic? Nobody kisses people when just panic, Potter!" he hissed, rubbing his lips again with his fingertips.
He therefore stood carefully, taking the time to dress with his dress in the colours of the Gryffindors which had deeply missed him the few days he had spent in his other life. He collected his personal belongings which his friends had brought to him in the last 24 hours and slowly walked towards the door not without an inflating apprehension ball in his throat.
His heart missed a beat when he saw Malfoy’s face just a few inches from his. Harry was holding his breath, plunging his eyes into the silver hues he had already seen once a few months ago in the break room.  He was not prepared to see them so closely, and the shock was even more brutal when he saw Malfoy’s pupils dilate enough to cover much of them with black.
“The connection is that in addition to being pretty good at it, you also know some spells that, I remind you, you are supposed to be fighting against. Isn’t that totally ironic?” he grinned, the bitterness of his voice echoing directly into the chest of Harry who felt his breath block.
Malfoy then moved in his direction by making the sides of his robe fly at each of his steps, followed by the rustling of the fabric that broke the silence of the open space.
They dressed in haste and kissed one last time wishing each other a good day before going to class each on their own.
He reached out his hand to the small beige notebook, the cover of which was dotted with golden arabesques, he took a deep breath and exhaled his magic, giving a glimpse of a light blue light in the hollow of his palm.
Harry remained for a few moments, lying on the sheets, still stained by their lovemaking, before rising up in his turn and getting closer to him.
Harry was fast thinking, looking for a plausible way to achieve what Dumbledore was explaining to him.
A small silence settled between them, each one concentrated to contemplate the icy landscape around them.
“You won’t make me believe that you didn’t like it, Malfoy, so tell me instead why you decided to piss me off tonight?” Harry hissed, getting close to him.
“You wouldn’t be the only one, but you as well as the others are on the wrong track” Malfoy added, sighing.
He raised his eyebrows when he saw the few golden reflections that sprinkled the darker wood in places. Given the quality of the mouldings, it must have been particularly expensive.
“No need, I can go alone, you stay here to help others.” had then blown Harry, holding back a moan of pain.
A prize, however, attracted his attention, placed just above the large library in the lounge. It looked strangely like the cups he saw in the bedroom when he woke up. According to the golden arabesques, it was almost obvious that it was a Quidditch prize.
Harry nodded, looking down on his hands still holding his sorbet which was beginning to melt despite the freezing cold from outside.
That's why he ended up sipping a ButterBeer at one of the many buffet tables that the establishment had set up during this Christmas Eve with his own company.
He had almost reached his building when he swore in the void and banged his forehead when he remembered a book he had inadvertently forgotten at Malfoy’s.
Harry raised his eyebrows. He was clearly not fooled and intended to make him spit out what he absolutely wanted to hear.
Harry grew a long moan as he felt Malfoy’s tongue touch his lips before going to embrace his, causing him to lose his balance and stick even more on Malfoy’s body beneath him. A hoarse cry escaped from his mouth when their erections met, making him bite Malfoy’s lower lip.
He relaxed slightly when a corner smile stretched over the nurse’s lips before she made disappear the symbols, in smoke.
His eyesight was blurred, a sign that his glasses weren’t on his nose. He blinked several times to focus on something close enough to distinguish it and met the rounded edge of a cabinet right next to the white bars of his bed.
Harry clenched his teeth to prevent himself from retaliating badly because obviously this was the effect that Malfoy was looking for and he did not want to let him win.
Twist of fate when we knew how much they were supposed to hate each other. That even Ginny, his girlfriend, didn’t help him to get better, even though, on the other hand, he loved her…
Glued together, they resumed their breath, Harry’s face in the hollow of Malfoy’s neck, his forehead resting on his pillow.
Harry closed his eyes on his clasped hands and breathed a long sigh before reopening them to look at Ron.
Harry was sat in a comfortable bottle-green armchair and drew lines on the large armrest while waiting for his wizard therapist to come.
Turning his eyes away from the clock hanging on the wall, Draco sighed and cast a spell on the dishes still present on the table so that they could return to their usual place. Her plate went into the sink on its own and shook Potter a little bit, and Potter jumped slightly, dropping his own, which fell back into a dull sound when it hit the bottom.
He knew it was wrong, but his desire had been too strong for him to control. To be frank, he had very quickly stopped trying to get the upper hand, to the detriment of his relationship with Ginny. Now that all was over with Malfoy, he was cruelly aware of all the harm he had done to her by neglecting her for Malfoy.
Draco measured his hand for a moment before placing his gaze in that of the survivor and answering him.
But Harry didn’t fucking care, he had to see Malfoy, he had to know if he was alone or if he had replaced him.
As if he had heard it, the young man accentuated his grin and moved to his office, his stature further degrading the atmosphere of the room, removing the feeling of having been perfectly at ease a few minutes earlier.
“We’re going to be a little late, I’m afraid, Har... Potter doesn’t look very well...” The Slytherin explained with his draggering voice, also a little anxious, Harry noticed.
Harry blocked his breath when Malfoy pushed a little on his flesh until gradually sinking into him, making him wince with discomfort.
Dumbledore anchored his piercing blue eyes in the depths of his own, which had the effect of blocking his breathing completely.
Harry turned his head, looking for Ron among the students of the class. He had only created tiny flames all over the canvas stretched out in front of him, but seemed quite satisfied with his efforts for today as he smiled at him.
Harry swallowed and quickly groped his pockets to look for his, but a new bolt of lightning brushed against his cheek and he froze as his fingers pressed the edges of his trousers.
He watched them walk away to the door of the infirmary and give him one last wave of the hand before definitively closing the door behind them.
Dumbledore caught his wand carelessly placed on his desk and directed it to a locked cabinet with a bronze padlock. He made a wrist movement and the cabinet opened in a small “click” before spreading one of the doors. A small pack came out, flying through the room to finally land in front of them.
Harry nodded back and closed the file in front of his eyes. He rose in his turn to take his coat and followed his friend to the elevator.
“To be so patient… I never imagined you to be so” he said, hiding the trouble in his voice with difficulty.
Harry diligently followed the players' actions, gradually forgetting Malfoy and his jealousy towards anyone who snog him.
"I really don’t know what the fuck you’re thinking, asshole! It wasn’t premeditated, I never wanted to kiss you," Harry replied with a grudge.
“You’ll thank me when I prove to you that Malfoy is indeed a death eater and you’ll bite your fingers for not believing me,” he replied.
“Obviously... because I don’t intend to stop pissing you off, Potter. It distracts me far too much to stop it” Malfoy smiled.
Draco could see the foggy gaze of his lover staring at him with envy, guessing that his own had to experience the same feelings.
Malfoy glanced at him in an angle, looking pensive, before a slight grin appeared on the corner of his mouth.
On his nightstand, his alarm clock was at 12:30 a.m., and he decided to take a shower before going to bed. Harry grabbed his pajamas and towel before heading to the bathrooms across the hallway from the different rooms.
He felt that he had withdrawn into his bubble, ignoring his friends and the world around him. Nothing seemed captivating enough for him to deign to be interested enough. It was like drowning in deep melancholy without really caring what others thought.
“Sit down if you don’t mind, this may be a long discussion and I would be remiss if I kept you up when you must be exhausted.” Dumbledore said, pointing to a chair in front of his desk.
Harry walked to the building where Malfoy was studying, refusing to enter. Malfoy couldn’t have been far, he was still early and Harry didn’t think he was already in bed.
“Well, then I’m leaving, Malfoy, since obviously the mere fact that I don’t spread my thighs, bothers you so much.” Harry spit out, buttoning his pants with rage and putting on his coat to face the cold.
Potter’s fingers found his belt and began to loosen it, but Draco stopped him by grabbing his hand and at the same time slowed down the kiss that was becoming urgent.
He smashed his fist across the wall, ripping out a cry of pain. It was stupid, but he needed it. He had to feel something other than the pleasure that had overwhelmed him by letting himself be touched by this asshole.
"Andrea will see you, we’ll wait for her wisely here," Malfoy said to him, with his dragging voice before showing two chairs on the side and settling in.
Still others where Malfoy was with them, some of the Slytherin whom he vaguely remembered of the name were sitting, lifting a pint of ButterBeer and smiling at him nicely.
Obviously, his popularity hadn’t waned, and he suspected that sharing the life of someone like Malfoy surely didn’t make it any better.
He had been working there for a short time, having missed his NEWTs one time but had succeeded them brilliantly the second time.
“Stop pouting, Seam, you know very well you've made this weakness a force, now!” Dean added, to make his friend stop sulking like a kid in front of him.
Once again, he wanted to stop him but Malfoy had already caught his sex and brought up his tongue all along, snatching a groan from Harry. Malfoy licked the head of his cock, licking the few drops that beaded there and Harry moaned louder, his head tipping back, his back bowing under pleasure.
It certainly grieved many of them. Imagining that he had also recounted the story of blackmail on the death of his parents and his own if he did not come to the end of it…
He stared at one of them, preparing to face the terrible pain he would feel of hurting Ginny. For nothing in the world, he didn’t want to make her suffer but he also had no choice. He couldn’t keep lying to himself, let alone hiding the truth.
It was unthinkable to be so confident in front of Malfoy, who laughed all his teeth out, and whose warm laughter contracted Harry’s belly by taking his breath away. Since that night, Harry had trouble not thinking about Malfoy. He never really could, but it was confusing to have
Nevertheless, Draco was convinced that Scarhead was the cause of the peace that reigned between the Slytherins and the other students of their class. Saint Potter had worked on his behalf, recounting the facts as he had been told, that Draco had been used by the Dark Lord to carry out a mission against his will.
It was as if his body woke up with him, learning to function again after taking a vacation for a certain amount of time. Harry felt like he never recovered, every move every word he uttered was an effort he had to endure.
It hurt like hell to throw her in the face that he couldn’t stay with her anymore. He could have died if he was still in love with her. But that was the problem. He wasn’t, and he hasn’t been for as long as he thought.
“No, it’s true, Harry, since we got here, I see him everywhere we are, thinking he’s doing it on purpose to piss us off!” Ron hissed.
He suddenly plunged his hand into a pocket of his trousers to pull out a long silver chain where his pocket watch was attached.
The snow had fallen all night, covering the alleys with its white carpet, the cold wind blowing between the dead trees. He enjoyed these moments.
He pulled on one of the skins of his thumb once again and winced under the pain before he carried his hand to his mouth to lick the wound.
Harry could not stop a grin from stretching his lips before rising. He went once more to the door, and then turned to Malfoy, a glance full of promise.
“What did you not understand in the words “go home Potter”? Should I have gone into more detail? I would have thought the message was pretty clear.” He asked, in his dragging tone.
But the years had passed and the beautiful face with fine lines and grey eyes had become more blurred as his life progressed. He pinched his nose and closed his eyes with a sigh.
Harry had then told him to fuck off, telling him that he was perfectly explaining how he should do it and that the problem was certainly not with him. So Malfoy had retorted a salacious remark and cleverly diverted the conversation to his advantage, going as far as touching Harry to make him lose all desire to keep practicing those bloody spells to focus on his fucking dick.
“Potter, you … you really don’t know where you are?” he asked, seeming to finally understand what Harry was saying to him.
Harry walked faster, determined to speak to Malfoy, no longer able to bear the grip that Malfoy had on him.
He extinguished his bedside lamp, immediately turning his back to his friend, wrapping his sheets around him.
Draco already had a second drink in his hand, watching the room with his inexpressive gaze and the different students shake on the music.
“Well, you should! Just because you’re sharing my life now doesn’t mean I can’t face you!” Draco threatened.
He didn’t know why, but he had the irresistible urge to kiss them, as if something inside him was pushing him forward and sticking his mouth to his own. It was perfectly stupid; he had never felt anything like it for Malfoy since they knew each other. He never wanted to kiss another man in his whole fucking life.
She gave him an amused gaze while she pressed a little more on his broomstick, overtake him a little.
"You’re completely out of your mind, Malfoy" Harry replied, with his throat dry as he stared at the wall to his right, “I’ve never done anything like this”.
Harry closed his eyes and clenched his teeth before taking a deep breath, and then came out of the classroom, closing behind him.
Harry gasped while trying to catch his breath and winced when the pain became more present as he came to his senses. He put a hand on his chin and moved his painful jaw from left to right before raising his eyes to determine the origin of the blow.
Harry had no idea what time it was. He had totally lost track of time from the fourth glass and could not determine how long they were talking. Was it maybe two or three hours? Maybe more, or was it an eternity?
Harry opened wide his eyes by the familiar tone of his friend when he spoke of Malfoy, his smile always on his lips despite his interlocutor.
Harry barely got up while Malfoy tried as hard as he could to restrain him and once again walked to the door before opening it.
Draco followed him, opening the large wardrobe in a corner of the room to take some clothes while Harry sat on the bed, following his movements.
“Because you honestly think I’m going to confide in a fucking Slytherin like you? That’s ridiculous!” Harry hissed, shaking his head with contempt.
Harry moaned but no pleasure, because fear had taken over his desire. He wanted to stop her, but how to make her understand without hurting her? He moved his hand to place it on his wrist, preparing to lift it to remove it from his erection when a thud made them both jump.
So it was quite naturally, with this feeling of deep love that he brought out in him that he let slip these few words.
His running had weakened him somewhat but his determination was stronger than his tired muscles. Then in a final effort, he crossed the gate and ran to the door of the hall which he opened on the fly before meeting a wall and being thrown back.
Harry took a few seconds to catch his breath and continued to advance towards the elevator that would lead him to the many fireplaces based in the basement. He took a few extra steps when he heard the succinct rustling of a cloth floating in the air.
Malfoy overtook him, heading to the dummies whose wide open plastic eyes looked more than repulsive.
If seeing Ginny again had been pleasant and comforted him in what he felt, with Malfoy it was terrifying. It was so powerful that it took his breath away, grabbed all the air he had in his lungs.
But Harry loved her, desired and appreciated, most of all, Ginny’s company. And it was his girlfriend, he was madly in love with her but his desire for Malfoy was even stronger. Harry was as if electrified and all his senses were multiplied every time he saw him.
The truth was, he never really thought about it. Harry had Ginny and he slept with her. He never even considered doing it with Malfoy. For him, his relationship with Malfoy was simply to satisfy his desire and the way he did it, perfectly suited him.
Malfoy, still focused on Zabini, seemed to tense for a moment before slowly turning his head and scowled at him. Harry almost took his breath away. The pale, almost bland grey of his eyes seemed to have darkened as he stared at him and a dangerous glimmer of light was floating in his irises.
Malfoy remained silent, still looking at him with this glance so involved, so much pain and sorrow contained in the eyes.
“I will not tolerate you insulting me in my office, Potter. I’m here to help you remember, not to pick on me because my family has made choices you don’t like.” Nott retorted, firmly.
Another, where they were standing upright, both looking at the lens, arms along their body, their hands dangerously close as their fingers brushed gently.
He sneered. Obviously, being pushed back by Harry didn’t intimidate him anymore than that. On the contrary, it seemed to double his fucking smile that had continued to increase during their exchange.
He opened wide his eyes, feeling the heartbeat accelerate to the last memory he had of Malfoy and especially of what they had done…
A few murmurs followed, prompting him to want to open his eyelids firmly glued. This proved more complicated than it appeared. They seemed to be tied to the bottom ones, as if his eyes had been closed for too long.
Draco let his anger take over. Never mind, if after that, Harry hated him, it was too serious. Especially since he had already warned him!
But holy shit, nothing made sense in his fucking head for days. He wasn’t even sure he’d actually made it back to the world he knew.
A memory of the day before suddenly came to his mind. Malfoy walking towards him without seeing him, before a young man grabs his arm to turn him in front of him and make him disappear from Harry’s field of vision. Harry, who had not seen the scene, left his mind spinning, imagining the sequel with frightening sharpness.
He sat next to Harry, keeping a proper distance so as not to make him more uncomfortable, taking upon him not to stick himself against him and began to pour the tea.
“But you said you found their hideout?” Harry replied, louder, the hope he felt at the announcement of the probable arrest of those responsible for his amnesia went up in smoke.
“Do you remember that time when you tried to scare me in that horrible Dementor costume?” Harry asked, who had already started his fifth drink.
But he only passed by him, simply brushing his shoulder against his own, without detaching his gaze from Harry.
«See you next time, Draco... » he blew anyway, as he walked away, his hands in the pockets of his trousers.
“Just like you said” he agreed to answer between his teeth, rushing into the elevator shaft, always without looking at him.
Harry grabbed the shirt and began to remove it, revealing one shoulder, then another. He could see Malfoy’s torso perfectly now, but it still wasn’t enough. He wanted to remove the garment completely, pulling the sleeves, to discover his arms, but Malfoy stopped him, blocking his movement with his free hand.
They crossed the road together, observing the storefronts of the various shops that bordered it. Harry’s eyes shone with excitement when they fell on the last broom on display in Quidditch’s shop.
Four years he had not seen Potter again and he didn’t know what attitude to adopt when he would meet face to face with the Magic World’s savior.
Harry, who had closed his eyes and rested his head on his hand, opened them softly. He beat eyelids to get used to the sunlight that warmed his face and looked for eyes that Ron could speak of. It didn’t take him long to figure out who Ron thought was ruining their quiet, restful moment. Malfoy and his friends had just appeared and settled down on a nearby table, not far from theirs and seemed to be beginning their revisions too, thick tinted books, open before them.
Harry frowned and dropped the scroll he had in his hands to grasp the note. He unfolded the small paper plane to find a fine and leaning writing of a very pretty calligraphy which he recognized immediately.
Swallowing the little saliva that moistened his mouth, he took one last deep breath before exhaling long enough to calm the frantic heartbeat.
Harry stood there, stunned, the music resonating in his ears as Malfoy had just left him, just after he had wanked him. He still had his pants wide open, his belt buckle hanging on the side, when the nausea came up in his throat.
Harry was leaning forward, leaning against the bar and his head resting on his fist. He stared bitterly at the amber liquid that smelled like honey and mixed alcohol. He had just destroyed the life that his fiancée had set for himself and his own through.
He waited a few minutes for Tom to serve the last customers before he turned to him to take his order.
“What is my place in Draco Malfoy’s dream world? Huh? Are you going to make me your whore that you will come and jump while Madame sleeps?”
He felt it as he tried to revise the spells of elemental magic that they would have to reproduce tomorrow morning for their first class of the day.
Harry looked down at Ron’s still body at his feet and nodded once more before turning his heels to retrieve his bag. He put away all his belongings, which he had taken out at the beginning of the course, and proceeded with a nervous step toward the door. He opened it and prepared to cross it when his teacher’s voice resounded one last time behind his back.
That’s the phrase that’s been running around in his head ever since he thought about her more often than he ever did before.
When he arrived at the bar, he settled down on one of the many high stools which ran alongside it and after a quick glance around him, he slowly dropped his hood on his shoulders. He then ruffled his black hair and brought some back to his forehead to hide his scar. Although much less apparent since the end of the war, it was still visible and identifiable enough for us to recognize it easily once we saw it.
Potter shuddered under the touch of his lips, while Draco’s tongue licked the salty taste of his sweat and revelled in its subtly spicy flavour.
He hadn’t swallowed anything since he landed here. Noise behind his back had indicated that he was not alone, Malfoy must have been in the kitchen. Hardly had he thought of this idea that Malfoy had burst into the room, appearing behind him with a tray containing two small pots which he had delicately deposited with the rest of the pastries.
Losing patience, Harry rose from the bed and moved closer to Malfoy, sticking his pelvis against his chair. He grabbed the base of the quill to stop his movement before lowering his hand to surround Malfoy’s hand firmly, exerting gentle pressure on it to prevent it from breaking free.
Harry did so, gradually pulling his hands away from his pockets and clenching his fists along his body. The beating of his heart had accelerated and was strongly beating against his chest as he looking at the wand stretched out before him.
Harry sat in turn, indisputably hampered by the proximity of Malfoy’s body too closer for his taste.
Harry broke away from Ginny and hurtled towards the ground, and pulled out of the dive just before hitting it and then went straight, like the Wronski Feint.
“Do you realize that if you go into your memories, you risk damaging your brain cells?” Draco added, without letting him finish.
He waited a few seconds and then saw that he was not reacting, he shook more vigorously to get him out of his sleep, despite the terrible desire to leave him there.
He hardly swallowed before carefully turning his head to meet the blurry faces of his best friends who stood at his bedside, framing him on either side of the bed.
“Fuck you, Zabini! My neurons and I work perfectly, and if I were you, I’d get my ass out of here before I use my practice class against you,” Harry threatened, his wand in his hand.
They did not speak while the elevator was descending, simply watching the numbers scroll on the dial before the last tremor told them they had arrived. They headed together to the chimneys and Harry hesitated for a moment before one of them.
“Don’t overdo it, Mione, I just overdid it this time, that’s all” Harry added, shrugging his shoulders.
“Who is his shrink? I think he has one since his neurons are gone to take the air” he asked, turning at Draco.
Dumbledore pinched his lips before passing a hand over the Cauldron Cakes which began to glow softly.
“Precisely, everything. They would be the sons of Death Eaters who weren’t suspected when they were dead or captured” Ron added, in a deep voice.
“Well, for me it is not, I have no memory of having moved in with you, with anyone else for that matter! I never even considered the idea of being able to do it … I was too busy surviving to think about it” he said, scornfully.
Harry rolled his eyes at Malfoy’s lack of subtlety. He was fully aware of his scheme, but it didn’t work. As soon as Malfoy was in trouble, he persisted in masking his discomfort and his disappointment at not being able to master this nonverbal spell by doing everything he was capable of to try to destabilize Harry.
Harry accelerated his hand on Malfoy’s cock, hypnotized, always banging against his pelvis, while he moaned louder and louder.
“As long as you’re doing well, that’s the most important thing” he said, in a slightly hoarse voice.
Once he had received the rag, he wiped his hand before vaguely wiping out the small drops that sprinkled the coffee table. But fate was against him and he stumbled on the bottle of whiskey that staggered dangerously before falling completely. The liquid escaped in great waves and rolled to the carpet under the coffee table.
Harry blinked before frowning when he recognized Draco Malfoy standing on the threshold of the Aurors' office.
Harry stood up and Malfoy leaned over him to grab his lips in a dizzying kiss that made his head spin.
Harry watched him cross the threshold and start disappearing into the central corridor that led to his department before straightening out on his seat, bust forward and hands flat on his desk.
Ron Side-Along, not without a last gaze, tenderized for his best friend, leaving them again alone in a heavy silence.
Malfoy had partially straightened himself on one of his elbows, gauging him with a smirk, his eyes still veiled.
Draco saw clearly the burning desire illuminating Potter’s gaze as he stared at his mouth. Harry’s lips opened as he slowly leaned his head to the side and brought his face close to his. Draco tensed up instantly, while Potter’s eyelids were lowered, showing a last green glow before closing completely by reducing the gap between their lips.
Potter seemed split between running away from the room to find himself as far away from Draco as possible or, on the contrary, running straight for him to kiss him passionately.
“This student might as well have taken the password from one of you, but let’s not discount the possibility that one of your roommates is equally guilty.”
A powerful cough prevented him from getting any closer, while Potter still had his face hidden in the silver liquid of the Pensieve.
He stopped just in time, looking at the wand he always held in his hands. He stowed it in a pocket of his pants and pulled out his own to cast a protective spell on the front door and toward the fireplace, in case Harry was again tempted to fail him.
Feeling too much discomfort, Draco backed away, delicately releasing Harry’s shoulder without preventing himself from touching his arm with his fingertips. He rose up completely, thus putting some distance between them, as vital to him as to Harry.
“Oh Draco, we wondered where you were both at” Ron’s face asked, amid the soft crackling of burning logs around him.
And it just came out. He had asked her to marry him on the lawn of the Quidditch pitch while the last spectators came out of the bleachers and Ron and Hermione waited just behind him in the background.
“So you’re denying it all?” Malfoy asked, who had still not removed his bloody smile, which is growing in proportion to Harry’s answer.
He couldn’t breathe, the air seemed to have left his lungs to irrigate only his brain and put him in hyperventilation.
The movements were slow and meticulous, as if Malfoy was extremely careful not to hurt him. When the pain eased a little, Harry began to feel again what surrounded him. The texture of the sheets between his fingers, the pillow becoming moist against the bottom of his back and the slight caress rubbing his hip.
Ron and Hermione had found a lovely little house in the small village of Kent, in the south-east of England where they lived happy days.
No, it was a large bedroom with a large double bed, with clear walls and no different posters of Seamus' favorite Quidditch team or Chudley Cannons.
He stood up and sat on the mattress, leaning with his arms to support himself and tried to calm down.
He looked at the beginning of his note and frowned at the ridiculous situation. He was about to respond with a letter rather than travelling in person when only 7 floors separated him.
He struggled on the couch and groaned while trying to loosen his painfully contracted muscles from the night he had spent away from his own bed.
“Be polite. Thank you for easing the obvious tension you’re causing to hover at our table.” Malfoy retorted, in his most dragging voice, raising his chin to look down at him.
Ginny and the other Seeker stood high above the players looking for the Snitch, the first to catch it, thus allowing their team to win the game.
Potter doubled his laugh by holding his ribs, tipping his head back, tears shining at the corners of his eyes.
It was only when Malfoy opened his lips to lick his own and put his tongue in his mouth that he had a recoil movement. But he did not manage to tear himself from the arms of the young man who held him firmly, plunging them into a whirlwind of tongues and saliva.
Friday night, his body was still sore from the soreness of the day before... He had spent the whole day brooding over last night....
“The question is when... Last night, he remembered everything, so unless hex him an Obliviate in his sleep, I don’t see how he could forget everything.” He replied, frowning.
!” he immediately added, glaring anxiously at Harry, who, fortunately for him, was far too busy staring at Blaise to feel troubled.
"Good night, Harry," he said before snapping at him for saying Potter’s first name, preparing to immediately correct his stupidity of his bloody brain.
“What were the words again?” Malfoy asked, who acted as if he had not heard. “Oh, yes! A story of fresh morning toad and hair as black as a painting.” He added, smirking.
Malfoy was leaning against a wall, his eyes on a book as Harry and Ron came face to him. He raised his head and began to smile.
Harry closed the bottle in a hurry before resting it on the shelf and turned to see Malfoy pick up a bag full of ingredients, a happy smile on his lips. His smile stretched more when he looked Harry.
The excitement was in Ron’s eyes and Harry knew that the same glow was also reflected in his own. Fear also ran through their veins but made live this love of the danger they had always had.
, used extensively in the medical field. After spreading the whole set on the table, he rekindled the fire under the cauldron and began to make the cure potion.
He loved when it was so passionate, in pain and anxiety. Because it had always been like that between them and that’s what defined them best. And tonight would not be an exception, even if this time it was he who would be under Malfoy.
Because it was true, Malfoy had always spent most of his time ruining his life and now he was going on… Even after ten fucking years, if it was true…
It wasn’t much, but Harry knew it was his way of reminding him of what he’d done. Malfoy’s way of making him understand that he
“You’re telling me… That is precisely why I came to disturb you, even though I’m sure you already know it…” he had grinned, with his dragging voice.
Although less clever, Blaise was still an intelligent person and Draco was not surprised that his former roommate guessed the presence of a shrink in Potter’s healing protocol.
Permanent highs of heart made his whole body vibrate and prevented him from walking at his convenience.
It was almost terrifying this need to see him, to want him that way. Admitting it, was even more disturbing. It had been very complicated to feel desire for his lifelong enemy and if now Harry had gotten used to the idea, he just couldn’t believe it even though they had just had sex.
Harry’s breath was stuck for a moment in his lungs as he struggled to swallow the incrimination he was accused of. He turned his eyes on Malfoy, who slowly raised his left eyebrow before a thin, petty grin adorned his lips.
“Don’t get me wrong, I know exactly what the 16-year-old-Potter thinks of me, because I thought exactly the same about you then.” He jeered, sticking his eyes in Harry’s green.
He felt like he was rediscovering his body, which every nerve ending woke up with him and made him realize that he was alive. His limbs seemed to free themselves from the bonds of which they had been tightly attached, thus letting his muscles breathe, which he felt contract painfully at intervals.
Harry could not prevent a thin smile from adorning his lips when he looked at Malfoy. The boredom could easily be read on the features of his face as he pretended to be focused on Kingsley’s speech. He blinked once and then, probably feeling watched, turned his head in his direction and raising his eyebrows.
He was lying naked on the bed and Malfoy on top of him was practically naked too. He detailed his thin bust his pearly skin so sexy. He lowered his eyes to his belly button and then to his hard-on cock that was pointing at him. His own was just below and he felt blush by this sudden closeness.
Harry ignored him and continued to move slowly, looking him straight in the eye. Malfoy seemed to lose his means and no longer even thought of keeping his mask impassive while he was still retreating, with his hand always stretched between them like a barrier.
When the elevator stopped, they get out to the indicated floor, moving closer to the small reception post that stood in the middle of the central aisle.
Harry stared at him for a few more seconds before nodding and backing back enough to leave a suitable gap between them.
“You think I’d joke if I did that?” he asked, sliding his pant and boxers over his legs, throwing them bluntly into the room, ending up taking off his socks.
Harry felt the blood leave his face when he realized that he knew exactly where he had seen the box before and was angry that he had not understood it earlier.
Malfoy drew furrows with his tongue on Harry’s thin skin, pressing his hand on his dick, making him moan with pleasure. Harry felt himself leaving, his desire grew under Malfoy’s wrist movements. He felt his legs fail but Malfoy grabbed him by the waist with his free hand to support him.
He was at the conclusion when someone knocked softly at the door and made him raise his head hastily.
"Don't confuse a genetic defect with sexual preferences, Potter, it has absolutely nothing to do with it!" Draco replied vehemently.
Harry gauged him for a moment, before slowly lowering his wand and putting on the bathrobe on his back, closing it with the belt.
She took two steps towards Harry and stole a kiss from him. Harry gave it back to her and put his arm over her shoulder.
Malfoy beckoned him to enter first and Harry nodded his chin as a thank you before rushing into the shaft. Malfoy followed him on loan and pressed the number corresponding to the fireplace floor before clinging to the railing to hold on.
Draco then moved Potter’s hand to place it against his own neck. Potter’s fingers clung to him as if he were about to fall, as he slowly opened his eyes veiled by desire to look at him. Harry looked at him for a moment before pressing firmly on his neck to force him to come closer, also moving forward to once again delight his lips with a trembling kiss.
Harry watched one of the drops fall, crashing in a round circle on the back of his hand before figure it out where they came from. He raised his hand intact and passed it under his nose, collecting the dark liquid from which he seemed to soak, thus awakening his mellow spirit.
But the failure had been gruelling on his last night traded with her. Since New Year’s Eve, he had not renewed the experience, lest his desire for Ginny be marred by the one he felt for Malfoy.
!” Harry added, by clenching his fists strongly along his sides, restricting himself not to hit him.
At Hogwarts, he always had this bad grin that was reserved for him personally but now to look at it, Harry no longer detected any evil.
“Mione, it’s complicated magic, I had a terrible headache after me too, you know, it’s not easy to handle” Ron explained, trying to calm down his girlfriend.
In a startle, Draco opened his eyes, holding his breath in his lungs, recognizing Ron’s voice through the sound of the kettle on the fire.
Harry loved the excitement in the stands during a game, the adrenaline ignited his body, rising up to his spine, making him shudder with pleasure.
Harry felt that his unfulfilled desire would keep him from sleeping, but he refused to touch himself after what he had seen. He closed his eyes and thought of Ginny. Her long, shiny, silky red hair, her scent of flower that filled his nostrils, her charming little smile and her pretty freckles.
Harry had followed him with his eyes, turning over completely to see him clothe himself with a jacket over his shirt, as well as a long black coat denoting on his extremely pale skin and his blond hair almost white.
Draco looked at him tenderly, suppressing the irresistible urge to take him against him. Instead, he took a deep breath and told him where the cutlery was stored, and told him to help him set them up on the table in the center of the room.
No, he actually preferred to stay in his room rather than be locked in here... Harry shook his head against his indecisive mind... He just wanted to stop thinking about Malfoy and he was looking for an occupation so that Malfoy would leave his thoughts and let him live his fucking life.
Harry remembered the time when he heard Malfoy bragging about his status with Snape and he had a violent urge to hit Malfoy’s fucking head against a wall after watching the scene. In fact, he had done much worse later...
Malfoy had distanced himself since they had agreed that Harry would not spread his thighs for his asshole face and Harry did not think that this situation would hurt his composure.
Draco took care to clean his work surface. He cast a quick cleaning spell on the traces that some ingredients had left when he cut them or pressed them and then made disappear the last drops of the potion whose green still glowed.
«Fuck, Malfoy answers! And since when do you call me by my first name?! » Harry shouted, walking a little more, his wand in front of him.
Closing the door behind him, Harry ran down the stairs before leaving the building to reach his room with a quick step.
Harry was afraid, he felt the heartbeats of his heart failing. He had never been in this situation and felt paralyzed. Malfoy smiled as if to relax him before wrapping his hand on his erection and beginning progressive back and forth, staring at him.
Harry raised his eyebrows before sighing again and coming straight at him, stopping at his height. He then leaned his head to the side to give him a feverish kiss, tipping him back, until the back of his head touched the pillow.
He finally felt like he was breathing, away from that sordid office and the strange character that Nott was.
Harry blinked for a moment before regaining his wits and deigning to pass his jacket by joining him in the hallway.
Harry gauged him for a few moments before shaking his head and complying. He didn’t have a choice anyway,
Harry looked at him without blinking, the anger gradually settling in the flow of his blood, beating inexorably within his veins.
Harry listened, his eyes fixed on his best friend, his hands on his temples, his wand sinking into the skin of his forehead.
"Fuck, Potter, you know it’s dangerous, I already told you! Why did you go back?” he hissed, between his teeth.
“Maybe so, but I can’t bear to see you so caring, it’s not you, it’s not me, it’s never been like that between us, so respect it!”
“Maybe if I explain to you the effects of this potion, it will brighten up the identity of the guilty potential, what do you say?” Dumbledore’s voice made, bringing him back to the middle of his office.
He soon arrived by making their glasses soar to him with his wand. Harry grabbed his and put it in front of him, squeezing the handle between his fingers. Malfoy settled in and raised his hands to undo the twinkling hook of his neck. He then removed the heavy cape he was wearing and let it rest on the back of his chair. He then took the handle of his glass between his fingers and raised it high enough for Harry to understand the message.
“Sleep now. Because if you think you don’t need it, I can guarantee that your body won’t last long if you don’t rest.” Dumbledore concluded, with a small enigmatic smile.
He opened the window delicately to catch one of the bottles at random, to read the word that was written there.
However, the pain that was compressing his heart remained present, pressing more than necessary on the organ to remind him that, whenever it had something to do with Malfoy, he was in that state…
Harry’s breath became more and more jerky, his heart beat redoubled against his chest when he felt his finger touch the rough skin there, Malfoy’s hand forcing it on until he felt it sink to the bottom of him.
"What?! But I don’t fucking care what you want or not, Malfoy! It’s what I don’t want anymore to happen with
Malfoy stood up in front of him and licked his lips, before erasing the last drops of semen with the back of his hand. Harry finally seemed to realize that he could now move and rose on his elbows, completely disoriented.
Oh yeah, he got to the point where envy outweighed his feelings for Ginny. Not seeing Malfoy, hurt his belly, a lack that had to be filled as soon as possible. It gave him the effect of an acid, gnawing at his stomach, waiting for his tranquilizer to regain serenity.
There, he laid the whole thing, opened the bottle with his wand and enchanted the wine so that it poured itself into the two glasses.
Harry took great inspiration and walked towards them. They turned and Malfoy stopped laughing when he saw him. He seemed surprised at first because he raised his eyebrows. But very quickly, a smile appeared at the corner of his lips and enlarged.
He contemplated them for a few moments, as if hypnotized by their way of moving in the hearth before remembering that he was not alone.
Harry closed his eyes as strong as he could to stop facing the truth. He placed his hands on his ears so as not to hear what Nott kept telling him.
He felt Malfoy tense himself against him, contracting all his muscles, while Harry’s tongue rushed into his mouth to delight his taste which he loved so much.
But, Malfoy had responded to his angry kiss, which had as its primary purpose to make him shut his fucking mouth and had even accentuated by touching him where he never thought that one day his hand would settle, other than on his face to hit him.
"Er... Well, to be perfectly honest, I was hoping that someone like you who hates me enough, would never have the idea to snog me, all traditions combined." He informed, unsure of himself after all.
"I plead guilty," he sneered, opening his hands, his forearms again resting on the armrests of his chair.
He then jumped into one of the campus showers, to thoroughly rinse the torture that his subconscious had inflicted on him.
He stared at the trees for a few more moments, seeming lost in his thoughts again before turning completely and extending his arm in its direction.
with them when only a few hours ago, he had quietly fallen asleep in his bed in Hogwarts? A few hours ago, he was only 16 years old and in the middle of his sixth year…
Exactly! And then with Malfoy you never know which foot to dance on, that fucking ferret must have found another way to get noticed,” Ron replied, pointing his fork at Harry.
He did it without thinking. Because it was no longer about control. His whole being no longer belonged to him every time he saw Malfoy’s gaze or he used his dialect to get Harry out of his mind.
Malfoy stared at him for a moment, his impassive mask firmly in place on his pale face with fine features, emerging all the more under the frozen air from outside.
Harry’s fingers tightened the sheets around him until the knuckles were whitened. He suffered. The pleasure that Malfoy gave him defied all those to whom he had succumbed until now.
“Strangely, he’s no longer as exasperating as he was in Hogwarts, but he’s still very odd, even... quite uninhibited, right Harry?” Ron explained, turning his eyes to him.
Harry stared at them for a moment, frowning, thinking he could see some pain shining in their depths.
He was leaning slightly to the side with his arm holding his head, his hand hiding the upper part of his face, which he slowly lifted when he heard him enter.
Harry then turned his heels to return to the road he had just completed and tried to ignore the heartbeat that redoubled in intensity at the thought of returning to see him. He arrived much faster than he had left and climbed four or four steps up the stairs before breathing again once he reached the landing.
“Slowly…” he whispered against Harry’s lips, taking his hand away and resting it wisely on one of his hips.
“I do make it a point to reserve this aspect of my personality only in your presence.” he affirmed, with his dragging voice.
Harry threw his head back, pinching his lips, before finally closing his eyes to the overwhelming pain that forced the barriers of his mind.
Yet, it was stronger than him, to look at his former enemy had become a habit. It was already like that in the days of Hogwarts, and if it didn’t seem suspicious before, it was clearly because only hatred came out. Now, there was a very different glow in their eyes and he was convinced that Ron had seen it.
He walked down the hallways that brought him closer to Potter, hoping to find him in a more relaxed state than when they arrived.
“I don’t remember asking you to put your tongue in my esophagus, Potter...” Malfoy whispered, amused.
Harry slowly looked up to look at him and Draco felt once again lost in mind by the intensity of his green eyes. Then, still with a marked slowness, Potter lowered his gaze on his plate and resumed his meal where he had left it.
“You really have a special way of saying that you care about each other… All in sarcasm, rather than being honest about how you feel” Harry noticed, frowning.
He was however delighted to see Dumbledore appear in the tangle of the door and head in his direction. He had a small smile at the corner of his lips as he moved forward with a slow and confident step, the rustling of his red dress breaking the heavy silence that surrounded them.
It was also one of the reasons that had given rise in Draco to a deep and acrimonious hatred for his former enemy. Hatred that had faded little by little to eventually turn into an unconditional love for that bloody
Flying had always been a pleasure since he was eleven. Harry had always been good at this sport, a gift directly inherited from his father and he was particularly proud of it. He would never again forbid himself to climb up on a broom, the need was too present in his guts to ignore it, because it was in his genes, in his blood.
Harry felt his breathing become more and more jerky as his blood boiled in his veins and adrenaline rose inside his body.
Harry shivered. Malfoy stepped a little further until he grazed their shoulders, his mouth a few inches from Harry’s ear.
But he did not have time to intervene, Harry’s heart had already exploded in his chest, his green eyes were already drowning in Malfoy’s grey ones.
“It’s not ironic, I didn’t know the effects of that spell. It was an unfortunate accident.” He breathed in a harsh voice, planting his green eyes in Malfoy’s diabolically grey eyes.
“Harry, I’m going to warn Molly that the wedding has to be postponed while Draco takes you to St Mungo's to validate the theory that we are advancing…” she explained it, slowly.
“Aren’t you working today?” Harry asked, raising eyebrows, realizing only now that he was still there.
Everything seemed more harmonious now that he had matured and without knowing why, Harry found that it was much better for him like that. He even went so far as to think that Malfoy was a rather attractive man if we looked closer.
How, from his cozy bed to Hogwarts he had landed in this unknown reality of which he had no memories, only the few photos and portraits he had vaguely glimpsed in the room, his room visibly shared with…
There was a pleasant little silence where none of them spoke. Ginny played with a lock of her beautiful hair while Harry let himself be hypnotized by this move. He already felt the tiredness regaining him and his eyes struggled to stay open.
The practice classes were becoming more and more complicated, their magic was being put to the test and they were completely exhausted coming out of class. After each elementary magic class, he and Ron threw themselves at the food, seeking to fill the abyss that was taking hold of them.
Harry leaned a little further forward, gripping his belly with his arms, feeling it contracting painfully, moving his chin forward.
Harry raised his eyebrows, caught unawares, and then rolled his eyes before smiling deviously. He turned his gaze to the clock on the night table and proceeded with a calculating step towards Malfoy.
He squeezed Ginny tighter and Malfoy’s smile widened, revealing his white teeth, before finally giggling. Then he detached his eyes from Harry and started a conversation with Blaise Zabini who had turned to talk to him.
It was even worse as the hours went by. Harry felt him grow and stretch out to take on a more important place inside him. It was like an intense rage that electrified every pore of his skin and regularly sent him small discharges so that he never forgot. That he suffers permanently from this evil that had decided to gnaw at his organs.
Harry frowned at Malfoy’s capitulation. It was not the kind of Malfoy to give up during battle, especially when he excelled in the art of belittling others, intimidating you by forcing you to blink until breaking eye contact and demonstrating all his superiority. One of the many assets that Harry had long experienced over the years with him, and which, if not intimidate him, made him all the more determined to fight for the last word. To have the last black glow in his eyes that would tip the scales in his favour, as was obviously what had happened just now, but which Harry did not believe for a second.
“Uh… yes, yes it seems, I don’t remember very well.” he replied with difficulty swallowing, a muscle of his jaw contracting painfully.
He waved to Fawkes with a nod of the head before taking a brief look at the Pensieve behind the door, and then walked to the wide desk with the feet shaped like a bird’s claws where Dumbledore was standing.
He was taller than Draco was, and it made him very annoyed, because he was generally quite proud of his height and felt almost inferior when he was close to the young man.
He felt Malfoy’s hands pass between them and push him back, until he bumped into something that turned out to be a bed and felt tipped over, his back hitting the mattress.
He went around the hall, recognizing a few people, including Hermione, a quill in his hand that seemed to transcribe the whole of what was going on. Harry looked at the row of chairs closest to the stage and his heart missed a beat when his eyes landed on a blonde head recognizable among all.
He too had a hard time controlling himself when it came to his feelings for Harry. He too had to settle for his half-lover, suppressing his emotions so as not to break and kiss him whenever he wanted. Because he did. He needed to touch him to remind himself that even if he didn’t remember, Potter was his.
He closed his eyes, strongly wrinkling his eyelids to prevent himself from letting go, his eyelashes already wet from tears that were trying to escape.
He had still not regained his senses when Malfoy undertook to lower his trousers. He blinked when he felt Malfoy’s hand grazing his groin when he took off his boxers.
“I’m glad I’m done with this crap. Marrying Hermione has not been without pain, believe me…” Ron sighted.
Blaise was impeccably dressed, as usual, standing upright and princely, gauging them with his cold, arrogant look, although a light, amused grin was painted on the corner of his lips.
“This is one of my main qualities, indeed” he sneered arrogantly, raising his chin to look down on him.
Sometimes he would think that Malfoy tolerated him enough to want to see him other than to have a shag with him. Other times, he thought about what it would be like if Malfoy fucked him and how he’d feel. Would he be hurt? Would he like it? But he quickly discarded these possibilities, once he found himself in his sheets to ride him wildly, with his grey eyes darkened him staring with undisguised desire.
The only plausible explanation was that he had simply lost his mind… A neuron must have jumped the day before and, as usual, Malfoy took advantage of it to make him spin. And since he was already fragile, after the scene the other day, where once again this asshole was the main culprit, Harry had let an impulse invade him and his hatred towards the ex-Slytherin had made everything mess.
A slight moan escaped from his lips, as he bit one. His crotch was beginning to contract, his dick getting bigger, making him squirm with embarrassment.
He saw the faces of his friends turning sharply towards him and completely released his neck to point to his eyes with his hand, the other firmly clenching the sheets between his fingers. It had become unbearable not to see them and he felt that he would need to be in complete possession of his means to face what would follow.
Despite everything, Harry stuck to his guns, determined to prove that Draco Malfoy had become a death eater and that he clearly had a mission for Voldemort.
Harry felt left amidst the hospital linens and the pleasant silence that surrounded him. It did not take more than a few minutes for him to abandon himself to sleep and definitively close his eyes.
Potter stared at him a moment before the corners of his lips began to tremble dangerously and set out in an uncontrollable madness.
Draco Malfoy stood straight and proud alongside a charming young woman with brown, wavy hair, her hand delicately placed on her fiancé’s arm. If Astoria stretched a vague smile that we could hardly glimpse, Malfoy kept his mask impassive without letting any emotion filter.
Harry took a deep breath, coughing a little while more tears filled his eyes under the pain that burned his throat. He was squeezing the sheets tightly to prevent himself from losing control and smashing everything he had in his hand, although he was not convinced that he could coordinate all his members to do so.
Draco watched the scene, arms folded against his bust, staring at Harry with his face closed, unable to stop the frenzied beating of his heart against his chest. Striving to keep an impassive face to the disgust he had taken to complete his sentence.
He seemed more relaxed, calmer and it was very destabilizing to see so much change in Malfoy’s behavior.
He had a brief startle, as if caught at fault and in an unnecessary reflex, backed back a step before wincing under the stiffness of his bloody leg.
Closing his eyelids tightly, he put his hand under his underwear and wrapped it around his sex. He had a jolt, his dick was so sensitive. He began a very gentle movement for fear of suffering and uttered an acute groan. He continued on in slow moves so as not to hurt himself.
“Salazar, Potter, you don’t break off an engagement so easily and especially not for some fucking sexual drive.”
"It doesn't prove anything, it's probably one of your ways to play me! But it doesn't work, I'm not stupid enough to believe in such a ridiculous thing! How could you, Saint Potter, have this kind of incongruous feelings for…Me?! Admit that it is totally laughable!"
"Fine, leave us alone. I’ll join you after my interview with Potter," he replied, firing his friends with a wave of his hand.
“Not too bad, I can go back to the dorm tonight, according to Pomfrey.” He announced, straightening himself to be totally seated on his bed.
It was already 7:05 p.m. and Harry was still in the office finalizing his report on an investigation. A story of wizards who called themselves "the heirs of the Dark Lord" and terrorized the Muggles.
And it hurt a lot. It hurt terribly and he fucking wanted to raise this wizard asshole to hit him with violent blows so much pain was unbearable to him.
It turned out that the spell he had received, was one of the most common of the dark magic and that the cure was already known by the Healers. He had swallowed an appalling potion that had given him horrible chills for several minutes before the effect finally faded.
“Is it reversible?” he asked, a faint hope contained in his voice, as he stared at the cage doors still closed, as the elevator going down.
Whatever had happened, he had now overcome his fear and felt alive before so many sensations. Harry took advantage of the well-being effect of a simple broom, forgetting the latest events, forgetting the discomfort since his last night with Ginny.
Harry answered, almost mechanically, his desire was present, but not pressing enough for his taste. He had been much more excited every time Malfoy had grabbed his lips during their chance encounters. Maybe he just ate too much tonight, which would explain why he had trouble following her.
Harry placed his glass on the table to make him raise his eyes. He then leaned his bust forward to make sure he looked at him.
He had not for a moment doubted that she made sure he got all his classes back when he woke up. The opposite would have surprised him all the more.
Harry had a slight startle then looked at him from the corner of his eye before completely turning his head to face him again.
Harry closed his eyes and remembered the last time he saw him. There hadn’t been another since that awkward moment when they both wanted to kiss.
“Good for him, if it helps him improve his family’s image.” he mumbled, fixing the foam sticking to the edges of his pint.
Malfoy’s hands grabbed his waist, scratching his skin over his t-shirt and grabbed it by the edges and rolled it up until he completely unveiled his back. Harry broke the kiss to put the garment over his head and eagerly resumed his lips by caressing his neck, his shoulder blades before going up in his hair to grab some of the strands.
After mumbling a spell, the utensils started to move, cutting, grating the vegetables and meat straight out of the fridge and rushing into the pot to cook slowly.
He passed the broken glass exploded at his feet, keeping in mind his objective to flee this place and all those around him.
Harry watched him put on his heavy black cape over his dark blue robe. He lowered his eyes on Malfoy’s hands, observing the long, thin fingers that closed the clasp at the centre of his neck and felt his heart leap into his chest.
“You’re absolutely right. Theodore Nott, wizard therapist, specializing in memory loss cases” he claimed, extending a hand to Harry, leaning forward.
“Thanks” he replied, taking off the elastic and unfolding the bindings to take out the scroll of parchment which it contained.
He heard Malfoy discuss plants and benefits with the store manager, who gave him some information about the products he sold.
A small strangled noise then came out of his throat when he recognized one of the two protagonists who were kissing each other without restraint against one of the campus streetlights.
Harry was lost in his grey eyes, darkened by pleasure and the strands of blond hair that fell before them. Harry found himself wanting to put one back behind his ear and remembered the man who had done the same and Malfoy had rejected him. So, Harry lowered his arm that he had lifted and caught Malfoy’s sex pointing at him.
“I don’t know, you’re kind of... absent... It was Hermione who pointed it out to me and now that she’s told me, I also find you look weird." Ron noticed, looking at him.
Great sense of guilt fell on his shoulders as he reflected on how he had behaved toward Ron, Hermione, and especially Ginny, that very morning. He had been a fucking asshole and now that he was stepping back enough to look at the situation, he was bitterly regretting his actions.
Draco had always known that Theo was smarter than him, perhaps more than Hermione, if he dared think about it. This man had always been one step ahead of events. It was surely for this reason that he had not become more involved during the war, certain of the outcome of it.
All his senses were screaming with desire while his mind was screaming that this asshole was doing this for the sole purpose of destabilizing him. And it was working... He was unable to look away from Malfoy, who voluntarily showed him his profile, so that he could see his tongue playing with the other guy’s.
"I mean that I respect human feelings and that being attracted to men rather than women makes absolutely no difference to the functioning of our society," he concludes, with his arms crossed.
He turned his head sharply to the side in the hope of coming face to face with the unknown person he had heard, but he was already leaving the room.
“Now you’re going to listen to me, Potter, it’s not about coming across on a bad memory that concerns me, but about the fact that you’re going to end up messing with your brain! Do I have to remind you that you had Obliviate and that dug a deep hole in your fucking brain for many years! If you ever want to get back to your memories, try not to mess it up until you do!” he shouted, frustrated.
Everything had been calculated from birth, he knew it… Draco had been brought up to rule and bribe his neighbor as his father had striven to do before him, making him proud of him.
So, Draco grabbed his arms to gently push them away, stopping the awkward kiss at the same time. A plaintive moan escaped from Harry’s lips as Draco pulled his hands out from under his shirt, squeezing Potter’s wrists between his fingers.
He just didn’t want to see him leave without him. He felt like an irresistible urge to hold Malfoy back to keep him close to him.
He had rarely seen anyone so sure of himself and so calm. It was evident that Nott had belonged to the house of the Slytherins, his malicious and aristocratic side was exhaling with all his being. But he had a very erudite side that might have suggested that he was part of the Ravenclaws, because he looked so witty.
Draco raised an eyebrow before lightly giggling, which caused Harry’s eyes to suddenly open before he looked at him without understanding.
Harry supported his gaze, the erratic breathing of having wanked Malfoy and of having seen him come against him.
Ron turned his head in his direction and stared at him for a long time before sighing and closing the newspaper. He turned on his bed until he found himself in the same position as Harry and planted his blue eyes in his own.
Malfoy held one of his hands out to Harry to catch his erection, gently pressing it over his clothes and began to knead it between his fingers.
He frantically blinked his eyelids to do the correct focusing behind the damp which was slowly beginning to dissipate in his eyes. Draco then raised his wand in front of the cupboards to take out the plates and cutlery that he had carefully arranged on the table.
Malfoy was no longer paying attention to him and holding in his hand a book that he read quietly, looking perfectly relaxed.
He stared at the room, looking at everything in it, in case he missed something that would put him on the runway. His grey eyes landed on the small bottle next to a witch photograph, noticing that it had been uncorked.
But that was not counting the hard work of Noah a few meters under him, who leaned his head to the side, ravishing Malfoy’s lips in a most burning kiss.
Harry blinked to come to his senses and turned his head stealthily to see that all the students had already risen and headed to the back of the room to practice.
So much rage was boiling in him these days... He tried in vain to contain his desire for Malfoy and it frustrated him so much that he wanted to beat him to the point of destroying his silly, aristocratic face!
It was his fucking fault they were there! It was this asshole who had ruined the moment by adopting an attitude he had never had, tender gestures that none of them had ever expressed while they were fucking.
Inside, the pub was still dark. The many wizards sitting in front of their drinks, where sitting directly at the bar were thrown into great discussions. Some threw interested eyes at them, others pointed fingers at their neighbours as they headed to the back of the building to the famous brick wall.
He was, nevertheless happy that Malfoy allowed him to do so, too anxious that he would use it to his advantage to deceive him about where they were supposed to go.
Nott seemed perfectly aware of his intellectual abilities, he had this way of showing you that this was the case without exposing it to you in person.
He sighed when he arrived in the alley before turning around to find that Potter had still not raised his head and seemed lost in his own thoughts. Saddened, Draco raised a trembling hand to put it on his shoulder. When his hand touched the leather jacket, Harry froze instantly and kept his eyes on the floor, seeming unable to lift them up.
Harry was still searching for his words when Malfoy rose from his bed, the blanket slipping on his skin and discovered his completely naked body. He stood in front of him and walked one step forward to surround his hand firmly on his sex.
“That sounds strangely like what I could tell you while you’re fucking me.” he scoffed, while the book still did not move an inch.
But Potter was standing next to the shelf, holding something in his hand that he identified as the cork of a bottle. Draco frowned before opening wide his eyes, realizing that Harry was closing the vial that allowed access to the room where the Pensine was.
"Fuck off, Malfoy! It was an accident and I've no intention of repeating the experience," Potter exclaimed, losing his patience.
Malfoy then turned to his office to pick up some documents that he put away in his briefcase and went around to move in his direction. Harry was struggling to calm his heartbeat without realizing that he had been perfectly still for too long.
Several times, he opened his mouth in a silent moan that ripped small noises from Harry, finding him even hotter.
"Harry, are you sure you’re okay?" Hermione asked to his right, sweating from his usual sickly anxiety that he knew so well.
He smiled at his best friend’s lack of tact and drew his attention to the scene where Kingsley seemed totally immersed in the facts reported by one of the members of the Wizengamot.
Draco raised a sceptical eyebrow when he thought he heard a whimpering moan from Potter’s lips as he closed his eyes in a wince.
“I’m afraid not, Harry. Everything you went through in your dream is just part of what your heart deeply wants to happen.” Dumbledore replied.
Draco Malfoy stood on the threshold, draped in a black velvet robe surmounted by an anthracite-grey cape with a clasp that reflected the ceiling lights. He carelessly wiped his feet on the mat before removing his hood which rested on his shoulders.
“Don’t say anything, you know I love you,” Harry sighed, reaching out to her with his hand and stroking his cheek.
for him? Whereas the only memories he had of him were those where he insulted, belittled and humiliated him…
At the end of the hall, she erased herself to let him enter his office, before going through the door in turn and closing it behind his back.
“He’s not here tonight. Now shut up Malfoy and enjoy the moment, because I guarantee you’ll love it!” Harry sneered, bending over to kiss him, forcing him to shut up at the same time.
"Me too…" Harry replied, thinking of his Fire Lightning crumbled last year, when he was fleeing the Death Eaters on the night of his birthday...
It was true, he had never intended to run into Malfoy, but Ron was right, he was obviously never far. Part of him started to hope that he was the reason for it while the other one was panicking to understand that maybe that was the case.
The dissatisfaction that he felt for a few hours now, not to touch him as he would like, not to kiss him as he was dying to, to take undeniably upon himself not to rush him, not to scare him away…
“Hi Hermione, as you will no doubt have noticed, there is a little problem with Har... Potter and I doubt we’re on time for the reception,” Malfoy added of his dragging voice.
“Can you please make an effort and focus?” Harry hissed, planting his green eyes in those of Malfoy who slowly began to piss him off.
Harry held his breath in his lungs. Apprehending the Side-Along from which he still could not get used to the effects as well as the emotions that this gesture made him feel.
Draco frowned desperately seeking in his memories the question that burned his lips a few seconds earlier.
Without wasting any more time and because his curiosity was in excitement, he opened the bottle and leaned it over the Pensieve.
Once through the nightclub door, he took several puffs of air before Side-Along appeared directly in front of the campus.
Malfoy stood still. He swallowed hard, brought his Adam’s apple up and down, and looked at him with fright.
“Fuck, yes!” Harry exclaimed, making large gestures of his arms and then came towards him to find himself a few inches from his face.
He felt he wanted it, but he couldn’t tell if it came from Malfoy or Ginny... So he did not prefer to tempt the devil and relive the last night of love he had spent with her...
“That also sounds vaguely familiar…” Malfoy taunted, a malicious glow shining in the background of his grey eyes.
After living on campus for a year, specializing in his future profession, he bought with the money his father had invested in him since he was born, an apartment in a small sorcerer’s district not far from the Malfoy’s Manor to visit his mother regularly.
Malfoy tightened himself around his cock and he could not help moaning, resisting the urge to sink completely. Malfoy groaned with pain when he pushed again, making him stop in the middle.
One of the glasses filled with juice was dangerously vacillating and the liquid spilled in large drops on the table when it started to crack on the top. A larger and deeper line formed on the glass before it exploded and scattered into several pieces of glass that landed on Draco’s plate.
He tensed up abruptly, straightening up on his elbow, looking for the exact time, before realizing that he no longer had his glasses, not remembering having removed them.
He had all the trouble in the world not to hug him strongly and stick his nose in his black hair to breathe his smell, content himself to bring him slightly closer to Side-Along without any problems.
Harry held his breath under the depth of Malfoy’s gaze. The metallic grey of his eyes caught him as if he wanted to imprison him, never let him go again.
As if he had heard it, Potter swallowed hard before coughing, his cheeks slightly dyed as he diverted his hypnotic eyes to place them on his plate.
The warm breath had finally left his face now and the fabric noises were back, seeming much closer now that he was regaining consciousness.
“I couldn’t explain it. It… happened… and I just didn’t control anything…I’m sorry, this… It’ll never happen again,” he said, with his eyes on the ground.
Draco went slowly towards the dresser to get out of it what to dress quickly before going into the bathroom. Opening the drawers delicately, he pulled a black sweater and grey trousers before closing it just as gently.
Draco had clenched his teeth, intimating himself to remain calm in front of this fucking prick who had taken a clever pleasure, it seemed, to show him that he had the full power over the situation.
His leg being still too stiff, he failed to stand and fell forward without any means of avoiding it.
He felt Malfoy approach him and place his stomach against his back, his breath always against his skin.
Still standing, Harry released the pressure on his shoulders, staring at where Ron was a few seconds ago, before feeling a slight touch on his hand.
Harry realized he wouldn’t win this time. He was far too disheartened to fight the frigid words that Malfoy had formulated with the obvious aim of lowering him to the ground.
His wand still pointed at him, Harry, headed for the closet. He took out a bathrobe which he unfolded before beginning to put it on with difficulty.
And on the other side, Harry couldn’t stop his eyes from staring at him. His hair reached the back of his neck and a few strands fell just above his dark grey eyes.
These bands of sounds were whistling and resounding inside his head, echoing against the walls of his skull forcing him to bite his lips so as not to scream. He became totally incapable of it when simple groans struggled to extricate themselves from his mouth, burning the inside of his trachea.
He had to get out of his grip, because having Malfoy so close made him lose his mind. After the dream he had just had, his thoughts were not as clear and led him to do things he was not sure he really wanted to do. He was absolutely unable to put that strange feeling on the blow of fatigue or if he really wanted to keep him close to him.
Draco stared at him for a moment before shrugging his shoulders as if his words were not important, but his heart pounded in his chest as they sounded in echo in his ears.
"Yes, I'm gay, Malfoy, and I'm very surprised that you don't know when all Hogwarts already aware about this" he replied, defying him with his eyes.
"Oh Really? And how do you intend to do it, please? Because other than hitting me, I don’t really s-" Malfoy mocked, before being abruptly interrupted.
Harry’s heart was pounding in his chest and threatened to explode as he continued in his stride and forgot the fear that was eating his guts.
But Harry suddenly opened his eyes and step back slightly, enough for Draco’s fingers to leave his shoulder.
He only looked at it once, though. As he put his tray on the table, he stuck his silver eyes in Harry’s green, a grin on his lips, before he sat down and turned his head for the rest of his meal.
“Of course! He may be crazy, but he’s a genius and he’s always been able to explain the unlikely events that happened at this bloody school.”
She came to see him in his room and he thought she was just looking for comfort. But her eyes, though wet with sadness for her brother, betrayed her desire for Harry.
“Let me guess, you tripped when you got up and twisted your ankle when you fell?” he scoffed, biting his lower lip while the corners of his mouth quivered dangerously.
“I don’t know how that person got it and how she got it through the school, but it’s a particularly rare process.”
"Officially, I haven't done any, let's say the witch press has kindly offered to reveal one of my adventures in one of their rags…" he explained.
Potter must have noticed his expression because he hurried to move the photo so that it was no longer in his field of vision.
He announced himself to the secretary who preceded the Aurors' open space and even before he had passed the latter’s office, Draco saw him raise his head in his direction.
Harry had never seen such a glimmer in Malfoy’s eyes, and he was more worried than anything else, contrary to what the sod said.
. In his dream -if it were a dream- he was convinced that Malfoy would have also been at his bedside, that he would even have stayed so as not to leave him alone while his friends left.
As if Theo had figured it out, he had lowered his eyes to fix the pockets of his trousers, in the very place where Draco’s hands formed fists, stretching his smile again, revealing all his white and perfectly aligned teeth.
He had always known that he was particularly resistant to these kinds of spells, since his fourth year to be quite accurate. He had demonstrated this during the lessons of the false Alastor Moody, who had insisted so much on teaching them by subjecting them to the
Malfoy was already in front of one of them and plunged his hand into the terracotta pot placed right next to it. He threw a quantity of floo powder by stating the place of his residence and took a last look at him before crossing the flames and disappearing completely.
Harry clearly saw Malfoy pinching his lips before slowly turning his head to face him and sticking his shiny eyes into his own. Harry swallowed before the intensity of the grey gaze where resignation was reflected throughout his body in his manner of standing.
“Come on, Potter... You’re not going to make me believe that you didn’t appreciate… you were hard as a rock under my fingers...” he sneered.
“Clothes… I had chosen them for you in the new shop on Diagon Alley» he added, a slight smile in the corner, a little sad.
Malfoy straightened slightly on his elbows, observing his gestures while a mute question shone in his grey eyes. Harry held out his hands to grab Malfoy’s arms, pulling him to him while he lay delicately against the mattress and Malfoy leaned over him.
"It’s beautiful, Dean!" Harry said, impressed to the rightness of the features that represented them.
The face of Hermione disappeared in the hearth of the fireplace without either of them being able to hold it.
He pinched his lips as a pain passed through his heart imagining himself continuing to hate the Malfoy from the present. This Malfoy, so patient, so… nice…
He seemed to hear someone pronounce his first name but, like his vision, his hearing was partially impaired and the sounds that came to him did not resemble words he knew.
Something sweet touched his forehead, certainly a hand, whose heat irradiated him and he almost wanted to go back to sleep. But it withdrew as quickly as it had come and the sudden loss of this comfort kept him awake.
“I don’t even see how you want to find something in such a mess!” Harry replied pointing to his best friend’s desk.
Harry stopped at the door and turned to face him, with his determined gaze and the tone of his particularly harsh voice.
Harry could feel his hand shaking around his wand, his knuckles whitening under the rage that animated him.
Malfoy tossed his floo power stating the desired location, went into the hearth and suddenly disappeared before Harry could make the slightest move.
Harry accelerated again while staring at Malfoy, his erection pulsating against him, so strong was his desire for him.
He went through the various tables in front of him before falling on Harry and his friends' tables and blocking them. Malfoy stared at Harry for a few seconds when Harry could feel his stomach contract every time, he met those piercing grey eyes.
Harry laughed in front of the particularly bruised look of Malfoy, not expecting to see him one day worrying about his fate.
He came in a raucous and deep moan, attenuated in Potter’s mouth. His hands released the pressure they were exerting and fell down along his arms. He opened his eyes to see only the darkness, vaguely distinguishing the reflection of Potter’s glasses. He blinked while Harry still kissed him so eagerly.
Harry relaxed a little, still keeping his wand in his hand, lowering it a little and began to detail the strange secret passage.
“Yeah…she has a serious problem with family events… She’s already planning on marrying me and Angelina when we’re not even engaged.” George nodded, pointing his drink at Harry.
Malfoy then applied lubricant along his cock, breathing small sighs as he caressed himself to soak it in the gel and spread his legs a bit to position himself between them.
Passing a hand in his hair, he brought them back, a few strands escaping from his fine fingers, falling on his temples. He squinted his eyes, realizing that he would soon have to cut them, finding them a little too long for his liking.
He tried once again to beat his eyelids, letting a dreadfully white light filter out and burn his retina when he managed to open his eyes completely.
Harry blinked and closed his hand before putting it on his thigh, with a clenched fist and jerky breathing.
Harry stretched a small smile, detailing the object in his hands, impressed to have succeeded so easily, given the last courses where using this magic regularly weakened him. He remembered the time when his jealousy had overcome his reason, exhausting his ability to cast the spell, so that he finally gave up so much power had drained him of his strength.
The pain had almost vanished and only a slight tingling remained present and itched from time to time. Harry then wanted to go back to the office to find out the purpose of the attack and had started to get up to the exit. The Healers warned him that his leg movements would be limited and that he would still have trouble walking for a few days.
The ticking of the clock hung on one of the walls of the room, sounded calmly, breaking the heavy silence that was installed there.
Too many unanswered questions collided and threatened his head to explode every time he thought about it. In fact, he thought about it far too often, even if there was something to think about...
He tightened the collar of his cape around his neck and brought the sides of his hood closer along his cheeks. The sound of his footsteps echoed against the walls of the little alley, the flat of his shoes cracking on the puddles that sprinkled the floor.
He began to unbutton his shirt, wrestling against those bloody buttons that did not open properly before casting a non-verbal spell on them to blow them up mercilessly.
His head wasn’t spinning, it was his mind that was spinning. His stomach, too tight, was causing him a high heart when he descended one by one the steps of the stands between one of the rows of seats.
He absolutely wanted to wake up before the person at his bedside left the room without him being able to see who it was.
He froze when he heard Malfoy sigh on his back and subconsciously squeezed his grip on his hand. Harry swallowed with difficulty, hoping that he would not wake up when his fingers quivered gently between his own.
After exiting the Leaky Cauldron, they headed for St Anne’s Churchyard Garden, to enjoy some of the air outside.
He should never have been here, he knew it, but seeing Malfoy right above him, listening to his noises of pleasure, feeling him against him, he wouldn’t want to miss it for the world.
He closed his eyes when he felt his heart rise up in his chest thinking of that man for whom he had gave up everything.
Pushing his head back, Draco hung firmly on Harry’s shoulders, following his back-and-forth movements. He pressed his body a little more against him until he felt Harry’s erection touch his own making them moan together.
Harry knelt on the bed, raising Malfoy’s pelvis to position it in front of him, clasping between his legs. Malfoy looked at him, his empty gaze, seeming not to believe for a moment what he was about to do.
"Potter, apparently there's something you think I need to be aware of that obviously isn't, so if you could give me a little pointer that we can move on, that would be very grateful from you." Draco sighed, losing patience.
Harry frowned, assembling the elements in his mind to try to determine if what he was saying was true. After a brief reflection, he shook his head and prepared to deny.
She made a move of her wand and conjured a small green bottle with a crystal-like transparent cap on top.
“No Har… Potter, the only one to blame is the one who put you in this state,” Malfoy said, in a strangely low voice.
“Oh fuck, that’s right! When I think we used it to praise him!” Malfoy snapped his tongue on the roof of his mouth, looking annoyed.
So, he passed in silence the beats of his heart that beat too hard against his chest, closed his eyes on his hands too moist to want to touch him again, and blocked his breathing when it became too hard to bear.
The students crossed the gigantic campus with greenish alleys at the end of summer to get to their first classes of the year.
For any answer, Harry looked down on him, really didn’t like the idea that someone like him was so informed about himself.
Harry followed him with his eyes and saw him settle next to a group of people he immediately recognized. He was surprised not to have seen them earlier when Malfoy bent over to kiss Parkinson’s cheek and shake Goyle’s hand to end with a light embrace with Zabini.
Nott stretched a slight grin, seeming to hide a nascent laugh behind the corners of his quivering mouth.
Harry passed his hand over his cheek, down his neck and his collarbone and pressed on his shoulder to force him to lie down. Malfoy tensed himself but let himself be, without letting go of his eyes, his impassive look no longer leaving his features.
He had delicate but also very masculine facial features. Harry had always envied Malfoy’s class and charisma. Not that he was jealous of it, but he knew that his own outfit, on the other hand, seemed almost neglected. And that fucking aristocrat, in spite of the war, still as classy, had the ability to put him off!
Harry approached Malfoy’s face, sticking his nose to his, sticking his eyes to the bottom of the grey orbs.
Harry had hoped so much to fall asleep and return to the dormitory that he had left, at the same time rediscovering his age and his previous life. But as he suspected, that was not the case, of course. Nothing was ever as he hoped… It was always like that with him, everything had to be irreparably complicated…
Harry did not understand what was happening to him, but the hatred he felt at that moment exceeded anything he had ever felt for Malfoy from as far back as he remembered.
He remembered his heart beating too fast when he threw himself at him to kiss him. Malfoy then pushed him away, telling him it was too easy to come back after all.
Harry lost ground. He was trapped, he knew it. An immeasurable desire devoured his bowels and came down to his crotch. He had to hold on to the wall, so as not to fall from the violence of the emotions that were going through him at that moment.
Harry found him handsome, incredibly attractive and his heart missed a beat as he looked at him, his mind blurred, his desire for Malfoy growing.
“Don’t tell me, I’ve been trying for two days and I can’t…Do you want us to train together? Maybe two of us can do it!” Neville exclaimed, his eyes glowing with excitement, now.
He lifted up his t-shirt, which he passed over his head and let it fall to the ground, again anchoring his green eyes in the silver ones of Malfoy.
“It is their job to find everything they can exploit. And as soon as it’s about the hero of the wizard world, they throw themselves, body and soul to be the first to collect the information.”
Harry sighed as he leaned forward to rest his arms on his thighs and join his hands together. He bent his head forward to fix the floor and touched the cuticles of his thumbs until he pulled out small pieces of skin.
He wanted it to be, because he was dying to do it again, but to do that, he had to deal with something very important that would prevent him from going further. He could not decently betray his principles simply because he longed to touch Malfoy and taste every inch of his soft skin that he had been able to caress.
“Fuck you, Potter... You don’t know anything about my life so don’t talk to get nothing out of it.” He retorted, in a dragging voice.
Malfoy opened the lid with his thumb and looked at the dial before making a sudden wrist movement to close it.
Harry squinted his eyes, because he had a harder time concentrating when Malfoy was this close and because his eyes were getting blurrier.
Harry fastened the buttons on his trousers, fastening his belt, before putting on his shoes and quickly tightening his laces.
Draco relaxed instantly, pleasantly surprised to find that Harry was finally willing to believe him.
He sighed, already imagining the victorious smile that Malfoy would wear when he confessed that he remembered his totally inappropriate act.
Potter jumped slightly and the muscles of his jaw contracted when he nodded firmly, as a response. Not insisting any more, Draco concentrated on his plate and began his breakfast, well aware that Harry was not inclined to discuss this morning.
He took another sip of whiskey, staring at the orange flames dancing in the hearth, vainly trying to warm up the bitter cold that he felt in the depths of his heart. A sad smile stretched his lips as he recalled the happy moments he spent with Harry in the living room. Both of them reading a book about their field of choice, before one of them gets a little closer, begging his attention.
He had no idea that Malfoy had made such a connection in recent months. He was well aware of the late hour at which he was leaving and realized himself that he was pushing back the time when he had to go home to be with Ginny. He did not think, however, that Malfoy had guessed it too.
He had never seen these festivities in the premises of this institution because he used to celebrate this joyous feast in his Manor, with his family.
“Ok… You won’t mind if I leave you, I have other things to do than to see you kill each other” Nott said, slipping between them and rushed down the stairs.
If Harry’s bad faith wasn’t so blinding, he’d think he was smiling more now that they were seeing each other.
He was going to be able to focus on Ginny now. He would have her with him for five days, and he would try to re-establish their relationship the way it was before Malfoy got into it.
The door of the bar opened in a small jingle and everyone had the reflex to turn their head at that time.
Powell then took out his wand and cast the spell on the trinket placed on his table. The different pieces turned on themselves, changing place to stick to others and form a whole new object.
Harry opened his mouth and closed it immediately. Well, from this angle, one might think that it bothered him more than anything else... However, that was completely false!
Harry shook his head, chasing this stupid idea out of his mind, already too disturbed by the last few days.
Harry took a few seconds to calm the frantic heartbeat and regain normal breathing before putting his glasses back on his nose. They had moved during the fiery kiss they had exchanged and Malfoy’s prominent cheekbones had left some traces.
He closed his eyes and squeezed the sheets between his fingers when Ginny accentuated his movements on his dick.
He couldn’t believe Malfoy was worried about him. Nevertheless, everything in his words and actions suggested that this was indeed the case.
Harry did not have time to answer him that most of the students had already gathered around the table to admire his work and made him uncomfortable to attract so much attention again.
But his best friends had decreed that the little information he had was unfounded and particularly flawed to take it into consideration.
He was so disturbed by what he felt that he did not hear the teacher give them advice to improve their energy and thus stabilize their magic flow for a better precision on the object they had to transmute.
Too many feelings were intertwined in him and he could not detect his own, of those, so powerful, of his own today.
He then raised one of his arms and handed him a brown accordion-shaped backrest. Harry stared at the file for a moment before looking up at Malfoy and raising his eyebrows as a question.
“Let it go, Hermione. I understand his reaction, if I were in his place I would react the same way” he replied, in a deep tone.
His legs pounded the ground, the pebbles screeching under his shoes. The building of wellness and health witch appeared before his eyes, in a last effort he ran faster.
Harry raised his eyebrows, surprised to be released so quickly and could not prevent a smile stretching his lips at the prospect of finally finding his bed and his comrades again tonight.
Draco rubbed his mouth vigorously before raising his head looking for any branch of mistletoe, probably responsible for this new fucking kiss.
He no longer saw Ginny as a result of her repeated flight training, making her even more tiring and thus preventing late-night meetings between her and Harry. So Harry was entitled to only a few kisses here and there, as soon as Ginny had time to give him, and even if it was little, he was content.
Harry had expected to see green everywhere and a bunch of expensive objects laid out in the room, but nothing of that taste was apparent.
No words seemed to explain how he felt while Malfoy was taking care of him, but he knew he liked it...
"You’re not serious? You honestly think I cared if I was going to hurt your face or if you were going to faint when I hit you? "Don’t you think I was trying to force you to stop your bullshit so you don’t kill us all?"
The other students around him were all focused on doing the same, depending on the specialty they had chosen.
This snatched a discreet smile from Harry who immediately relaxed. The corners of his lips fell quickly when he saw the young man put his hand on the hand of Malfoy who was holding his book, making him raise his grey eyes. Harry held his breath in front of the cold gaze that Malfoy gave to Noah, whose shoulders were slowly sagging, as if nothing else needed to be said.
He couldn’t decently let his misplaced cravings take over… He had Ginny and he loved her, he was sure of it.
“I’m really sorry, but I’m not going to tell you anything more. It’s too much…traumatic” he replied, in a calm voice.
Malfoy finally let go of his lip and he too had an uncontrolled laugh, discovering all his white teeth that shone under the light of the candles.
It was Malfoy who guided him and he felt his own hand move in rhythm with his. He wanted Malfoy to have pleasure, because he also took it.
"I’d like to know the moment when I made you think you were something else?" Malfoy replied, in a grin.
Harry contracted discomfort in the arms of Ginny, who took this reaction for extra desire and lowered one of his hands to put it on Harry’s crotch. He gave a little cry of surprise before moaning when she began to caress him.
He felt pulled back but tried to resist. Malfoy stopped and pulled him harder to force Harry to turn around. Harry had kept his eyes closed, and when he opened them again, he plunged into a grey ocean where bright lights that it reflected.
Harry blinked as he resumed his breath. Malfoy had finally let go of his hand and moved back enough to have no contact with him.
Heading automatically to the same cabinet as last time, Harry froze for a moment before slightly turning his heels toward the second on the other side of the Pensieve.
Everything had been too good that night, his desire for Malfoy, already particularly pronounced, had increased sharply when he had get inside him, feeling Malfoy everywhere around him.
