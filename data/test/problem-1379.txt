" It's rather more complicated than that Minie."
" That's no problem at all. We'll bring you some more this afternoon." He smiled that blindingly happy smile and hugged her again thanking her profusely. She stroked his hair. When started walking back Harry paused then headed for the Hufflepuff table and sat down next to the Hufflepuff fifth years. All of them looked like they had won the lottery. They spoke softly to him and though he didn't say much he was glowing faintly sunset orange.
She crouched down so she could see Harry beneith the bed.
" Well it seams you've figured out how to get him to warm up to you Granger. What are these?"
" so, I take it you decided to be the new defense against the dark arts teacher?" I waved my hand dismissively and excitedly kissed his cheek.
" No! That's not a good enough reason!"
It had been 6 months since my wife had died. 6 months since Ginerva Potter told me with her last breath, to "take care of them". Taking to heart her last wish, we've spent nearly as much time with the Potters as in our own home. Scorpios was adjusting, and his friendship with Albus burned bright. James cheered us all up with his pranks and Lilly was so intuitively thoughtful, I wondered if she was like her namesake. though she had her mother's temper. The whole Weasley clan have become a fixture in our lives, which I never would have imagined in my school days. we had returned the day before from a massive sleepover for the winter holidays at the newly refurbished Burrow. George had proposed to his boyfriend at yule to thunderous applause, I smiled remembering. So, it came as a surprise when Albus came tumbling  by himself from the floo, that evening in a panic.
" On the steps? Why would the letter leave them there? What does this have to do with Harry Potter?"
" Why?" Draco asked.
" I don't think you know what you're getting into, Weasley. " Harry unfortunately sneezed resulting in a loud pop and a small snow cloud over the whole group.
" You're sparkly" Harry said quietly as he wiped some glitter off draco's face. He didn't seam to have noticed he even said it.
Hermione burst in with a very reluctant Ron dragging behind her. She briefly paused at the sight of a once again pacing Malfoy before dismissing him.
(See the end of the chapter for
" Didn't I see you get hexed by a first year Slytherin this morning?" Ron flushed.
" Well?" asked Rogers. Harry blushed.
" Grown ups are mean. They hurt. You have to hide. " Luna smiled at him gently.
" I shall need to speak with you all in private at a later date. Until then I suggest we leave him here and keep a close watch on him. " The others agreed that more action would have to wait. " We should take him to the great Hall for some food."
" I wouldn't call it defeating, more like barely avoiding being eaten or set on fire." Draco rolled his eyes.
' Mr Harry Potter,
We are sending this letter to inform you that you have had an early creature inheritance. Your full inheritance is now available to you. Please come to the bank when you are ready to look over your vaults. The letter is a porkey, activate by saying bolts
------------------------
" luna, I know you know something, tell us where Harry is. "
" Shut up Malfoy. " He crossed his arms.
" Luna now is not a good time," Snape snapped at her. Luna simple walked past him and held out the bread and cheese to Draco.
" Harry, needs an inheritance test. To find a good familiar for him we need to know what he is, some creatures can't have other creatures around them. Like I'd be dumb to keep a fish and a cat I'm the same room. " She completely ignored Draco who was glaring at her and spitefully thought of all the curses he could get away with casting, which was a rather small number he found. He would look up some new hexes later.
Hermione smiled, " Thank you sir." Harry woke up and Madame Pomfrey rushed in and checked him over, before assuring us he was fine. Harry, while still very shy and nervous around people, (especially adults) managed to sit through the examination and took the nutrient potion she gave him. Apparently his magic had protected him from both the door and the floor when it had opened but he had fainted from fright, and malnutrition.
Draco made his way to griffendor tower nervously after leaving little Harry with Hermione. Hermione and Harry were talking about the difference between ancient runes and hieroglyphics which was some kind of Egyptian writing. Neville and Ron flanked him on either side.
" Who is Potter? Do I have to meet them now?"
" Lilly, Lilly Evens. They were as thick as thieves the three of them, until our sixth year."
" How is that even possible?" Neville stared in wonder at the flower.
" It also says that Wednesday was too cold for him and Harry needs a familiar."
Draco thought as they walked the seamingly endless staircases to the griffendor tower, and he wasn't sure if he'd ever truly hated Harry. Been jelous, yes. Been angry, yes. The reason he had decided to make potter- Harry his rival had been because he's rejected Draco's friendship, hadn't even had the decency to shake his hand as he did it. But, Draco supposed that maybe if he hadn't insulted weasl then he might have accepted.
"Do you see him as your mate now? "
"What about the Tri-wizard champions?" asked Alex, a slytherin.
Draco cast then frowned. " There's only us"
" You.should thank my mother Harry. She's the one who brought them for you." Harry looked up nervously and then nodded. He climbed back on the bed.
" With the dark lord after him and that old fool letting him just waltz into trouble. "
"I'll have your hide if you do that again, you nearly got killed last time. Don't even think about it, and your wife will have your soul." He shuddered and bumped my shoulder, " Mrs. potter is one scary lady. But, about me being a potion consultant, I was getting board in the office, and their after my family too." I winced in guilt.
" Huh, I thought the rumor mile was more accurate. You probably don't know what really happened on the third floor then either."
" But, it's yours. You said your aunt gave it to you. "
Starla ;)
BANG! glitter erupted around the room and Lucius was quite surprised to find himself, along with everyone else covered in pink and yellow glitter. Draco looked up hopefully at his father. " I don't suppose you know a spell that gets rid of this do you?" Lucius paled.
" Are any of you hurt?" Draco asked my kids, I turned detached to see them shake their heads. Maybe I over did it, I wonder. I hold on to my kids as we are moved to the ministry Albus and Lilly in my arms while I hold James to my side and keep them from seeing their mother in the main room. We end up at the Malfoy cottage where Draco and Pansy moved after the war trials.
" Will you hold it for me?" He asked holding out his book. I nodded again.
Healers rushed forward from the bank and surrounding area. And Draco was thankful that the witches and wizards had the decency to help the injured boy.
"No, well yes but not in the same way. I still want to protect him and look after him, but it's like how I would feel about a little brother, not a mate. not like my mate is supposed to be. I'm not attracted to him like this, or really in love with him. but I think I cared about him for awhile before this. Last year when.... Diggory was killed. ... .. I wanted to comfort him. It was really hard for him. His friends were there but he just. It was like he lost something and nobody could give it back to him, it hurt seeing him like that. I guess the thing I'm most afraid of is that I've already lost him, that even if he comes back he won't want me. " Narcissa hugged him tightly and kissed the top of his head.
"Everything will work out as it is meant to. you are mates for a reason. A mate bond is not so fragile it will be broken over some petty rivalry trust me and put away those fears for now. there is no use worrying over something you can do nothing about right now. He will find his way back to himself, and when he does you will be there to welcome him. use your head to think through his problems not his fears. this may be a great opportunity for you to learn about your mate. You will learn the best ways to remind him that he is wanted and loved and both Harrys will need that i expect."
" We are taking him to st. Mungo's, if you're his mate it will be helpful for you to be there. "
" They call me a lot of names but never Harry or Potter. "
"Come on, golden boy let's get to the hospital wing. Try to keep the gossip to a minimum or I will be taking points from all of you!." Draco grabbed his arm and they left the classroom.
" At the moment, Harry is four years old. It puts a lot of doubt in those relatives of his, and Dumbledore for placing him there. Harry should return to his former self when his magic deams that his is in a safe environment. It could take hours or months, there's no way to tell. But as of now Harry is showing all the signs of neglect and several signs of recent abuse. Tread carefully if you are going to interact with him. He will have a lot of accidental magic. " When we turned back to the bed Harry was gone. I dropped to the floor and saw him curled up under the bed. His wings were wrapped around him and he hid his face in his knees.
" Everything we've always told you about muggles and muggleborns and creatures and dark magic it's all lies, Draco. You need to keep up the act but don't believe a word of it. Lilly Potter was the best witch in our school every year and she was a muggleborn. Your godfather Severus is a half blood. Some of the best witches and wizards of every age have muggle blood. That doesn't mean you are less than them or better. You have talents too, but talent can never substitute hard work. Draco do you understand anything that I'm saying? It's all a lie people are no better than other people they just have driffrent strengths. But you have to pretend to think otherwise because if the leftover followers from the dark lord ever find out that any Malfoy believes different they'll kill all of us and everyone you care about. "
"Oh come off it, like you would know! Do you have a mate, Ron!?"
"Where's Lilly?" I asked casting diagnostic spell on Harry. The girl in question came running into the Library.
I could hear Draco whispering broken apologizes to her. It felt as though my world had crashed in, they protected them. The kids!
" You were." Draco supplied
" When he port keyed to the bank he had his glasses on, well not on they were next to him.but I don't think It's the inheritance. "
"Try me" he replied gently.
"Listen, Thanks for coming with me Draco. I Ginny would have my hide if I went out without back up again. I know the Potion consultants don't usually come on missions but-"
" Harry, Harry let me see it." Hermione said trying to pry his hands from his head. "Please, Harry"
The door to his bedroom burst open.
"BOY!' his uncle barely squeezed though the door. Harry anxiously looked at the clock 8:55 oh no. Harry thought. He hadn't left in time, her slept too late. Harry looked up at his uncle who was staring at Harry in furry.
" Why are you worried about that stupid prick? He said he'd be fine didn't he? " Several of the other griffendors glared at him, while Ginny elbowed him and the twins kicked him.
" Fine," came his muffled reply as he was hiding his face in draco's chest embarrassed.
chapter ten whoop whoop! I know I've been updating slowly, but on the plus side I now have a computer I can use. which should mean fewer mistakes. I wrote this chapter a month ago but it didn't feel right so I've been playing with it. I hope you like it.
Hermione evidently put a few things together by dessert and came over with Ron to Luna.
Draco Malfoy  had been worried for weeks. He knew his mate was out there somewhere. His father had told him weeks ago that the flashes of a dark room and sudden pain was a result of his mate coming into an early creatureinheritance. They were to leave the next morning for gringotts and try to find them. There were few reasons why a wizard or witch would go I to a creature Inheritance early. None of them were good. Draco woke up screaming in pain. His parents appeared with a house elf and hurried to his side.
The door opened again and there stood Petunia and Dudley, Petunia was holding a frying pan they both glared at him and joined the.asult in Harry. Dudley's shoe slammed into his head and Harry briefly blacked out.
It was decided that Harry was going to sit with Luna, she was the one he trusted most aside from Draco, but draco's parents were going to be with him. As they got closer to the noisy great Hall Harry tucked himself behind Luna out of veiw. When they reached the doors Harry let Luna pick him up, and he hid his face in her sholdiar with his wings tight against him.
" You are very welcome dear, if there is anything you need or want just let me know and I'll take care of it. " Harry blushed and looked at his feet. He seamed like he wanted to say something. And when he glanced at the book I was holding I recognized the longing in him.
"I'm here, shhh. it's okay darling. Drink this, I'll be right here. It's okay, come on, sweetheart. " Harry peered up at him while still hyperventilating and crying he was no longer screaming. Harry, let Draco approach with the potion and drank a small portion. The potion slowly kicked in and Hermione brought him to a hospital bed. Draco gently carted his fingers through Harry's hair, mindful of the tangles, and he slowly relaxed into the bed, folding himself with his knees to his chest and closing his eyes as he leaned towards Draco's hand. Hermione fell into a chair next to him and put her head into her hands.
It had been a long painful day for Harry Potter. The nightmares he kept having of Cedric didn't help either. They made him tired which of course led to mistakes he couldn't really afford to make. He gingerly prodded his swollen cheek and busted lip. It wasn't too bad this time round and his magic will probably heal it by morning. While he could usually ignore the filth that spewed out of the durslys one word had hit him pritty hard.
as they walked away Draco turned to his mother," a Nifler mom? really"
Ron glared at the youngest Malfoy, who glared back. Both of there moods were soured by the worsening cold. Draco cast a warming spell on himself and Harry.
" Draco, I really appreciate everything you've done for us, for me. but I won't make you stay with me out of obligation."
stay safe.
Draco Malfoy was pacing the infirmary. Neville was bitting his nails. Luna was talking to the corner in the ceiling left of Harry's bed.
" it's not like that " Hermione protested , "really."
"Do you know how to read, Raven?" My eyes widened at the nickname is given him, and his head snapped up. He looked like he was going to cry.
On his way out of the great hall, his father walked up to him and hit the back of his head sharply.
-----------------------------------
"What is it Harry? " It took him a few tries to get the words out because people had started staring at us.
At this time Mr. And Mrs. Malfoy entered the room. Mrs. Malfoy gave him a small hug while his father becomed him to the other end of the room.
As I was practicing Harry stopped my wand hand and put a book in front of me. It was my charms book open to the warming charm. I had been using the wrong wand movement.
Harry was startled out of his thoughts when Hermione spoke and realized he had finished all the problems.
Albus led me to the library and held Scorpios's hand. Harry was sitting in a chair staring at a blank space on the wall, completely unresponsive.
" Harry," Draco squeezed the bridge of his nose, and looked up.
" It's okay it was an accident, " Draco took the flower out of his hair. " Like this, remember?"
" Did I really jump on a er. troll?" blurted Harry. his face was red but he met Hermione's eyes.
Unfortunately Draco had come to realize that he had been brat up until about third year to both him and his friends. It wasn't until he realized that the things his father had taught him about bloodlines was complete garbage and that his father didn't even believe it, that Draco realized he had been a prat and worse than that a bigoted prat.
also if you've got background character names for random people i nee some good ones.  for the random people who want to look after Harry now, Even if they think the 15 year one is lying.
Harry felt his ribs cave as blow after blow rained down on him. It was getting harder and harder to stay awake and even harder to breathe. Harry felt himself be picked up and thrown across the room. He hit the bed frame with his broken wings and another cry of agony escaped him. Hedwig in her cage was thrown at Harry and clasp cut him just under the eye
" Ron, he's Harry's bloody mate he's not going to spread that around and you should see the way he looks after Harry. "
They were just climbing the steps when out of nowhere two people appeared on the ground in front of them.
Lots of love and thanks for reading
" Draco? what are you---. oh!" Harry lept to his feet and walked towards the wall. "I- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to- Are they okay!"
" You smell nice" Harry told him, and it was draco's turm to blush.
go back and read the last few sentences of chapter 6 before reading this, it goes right from that to this. thanks! stay safe
" Of course, we just have to find her. Do you know where she is?" Harry looked around, finally he spotted my parents and pointed to them at the teachers table. My mother was talking with professor Snape while my father was writing a letter. We walked over to them and nearly every eye in the room was on us. Professor Snape looked up as we approached. He smiled softly at Harry before turning to me.
"Uncle Draco! Dad froze!" He shouted as he grabbed my hand.
"I love your wings,"  she mused casually. Harry watched her as he ate. " Are your feathers soft? " She asked. He paused and then nodded pushing back a feather in his hair. Harry had eaten it all and was now licking his fingers. Luna smiled at him. " They must be. I wonder what they feel like." Her eyes light up " do you think they sparkle in the light?!" She wispered excitedly. Harry looked at his wings and back at Luna. " If you come out and let the grown ups see you then we can see if they sparkle!" He glanced at Narcissa before looking at Luna, who held her hand out for him. He shook his head and backed away, before wispering.
" Where's yours!" Neville surprisingly shouted back.
"Mr. Potter reverted to the last time he felt safe. If you are in pain or hungry or anything else that doesn't make the cut. you have to feel completely secure for your magic to mark the age. There have not been many times when you felt that dear, I'm sorry to say" Madame Pomfrey left after extracting a promise from each of them that they would have him take the nutrient potions. Even after she left harry refused to move or to say anything, all of the accidental magic had ceased, except that harry looked like a normal regular child if on the small side. both his wings and tail had disappeared the feathers vanished from his hair, even the small points of his ears were gone.
Harry opened and closed his mouth a few times before he finally got out, " What's the difference?" A slytherin 6th year who had given him an extra blanket when he went to the dorm with Draco answered.
"Found him. He's under the bed." Draco sighed releaved.
" No! But it doesn't matter, until Harry says that he wants this guy," Ron was pointing at Draco and snearing. " Who has been bullying us since before we even got off the train first year, to be his soulmate I will not allow you to just throw that around." The fight seamed to leave him. " He deserves choices, especially after last year. I made a promise that I will have his back and make sure he knows he doesn't have to just......... " Ron stared at Draco again assessing him. " I don't trust you Malfoy or your family, I trust Harry and if after all this rubbish he says you're good, then fine. But until then you better hope that I don't come after you myself if you hurt him. The rest of my family will be right behind me and you'll see what us 'blood traitors' are really like. " He stormed out of the room looking ready to hex someone. Neville sighed.
He looked from his mate to the bird." What is it Draco?" His mother asked.
------------------
" Whatever happened we can work it out later, Hermione's coming and she has some ideas on how to find Harry's familiars. "
........
" I did it to myself, Raven. I'll just go see madame pomfrey for a bit and it'll be all fixed. "
" Ron and I thought he might have gotten hurt when it grabbed him and when the troll dropped him, but Harry said he was fine. It may not seam so, but he's a rather private person. most of the time when we got into trouble it was because Harry tends to do things by himself. He's also a bit reckless sometimes, though that may be the griffendor chivalry. you can claim he's like a ravenclaw or Hufflepuff or Slytherin all you want, but I have no doubt he's mostly Griffendor." Everyone turned to the boy in question and he averted his gaze.
The whole room was thrown into chaos by the swirl of Harry's magic. A small glow enveloped him.
"We will, I just .... thought you'd have questions and I know the chocolate would help. I also wanted you to know that if you need to talk about anything, really anything at all that... Well I'm not sure the you right now would but, I'm here for you. I love you, Harry. All of you, and I'll find a way to help you get your memory back, but I think we better deal with the present first. " Draco looked up to see Harry staring at him with large eyes, his half empty mug resting on his lap.
" We need to get you a familiar little guy."
" A dung bomb I suggested using it on your brother when he irritated you." Lilly and James lowered their wands and I ran to James while Lilly and albus ran to us. I gathered up my kids in my arms, checking and rechecking if they were okay before I held them as tightly as I could. I Looked over at how my partner was doing. He was clutching Scorpios to him, shaking.
" He's nervous around new people, I don't think that's a good idea. "
Harry had finished the book my mother gave him by my second class so I pulled some of my potions books from my trunk and set them in front of him in charms.
Harry hid behind Luna, Luna was nice and gave him food. Luna sat facing Harry and blocking his veiw of the rest of the room.
" Story books, both wizard and muggle. I figured he hadn't read them and I thought he might like them. " Harry pulled away and happily started reading something called Robin hood. I'd never heard of it so it must be muggle. Charms started so she left and we listened to flitwick tall about the warming charm.
" Alright?" she asked him quietly. He hummed a bit in response and got back in his chair assuring those next to him he was perfectly fine. " Harry jumped on it's back just as it was about to hit me with its club. Harry lost his wand and mine was on the other side of the room with my bag. The troll grabbed Harry around the middle and held him upside down over the smashed sinks, which sprayed water everywhere. Ron and I tried distracting it, but all we did was make it more angry. It was swinging its club at Harry and he only just managed to dodge each time.
" Draco where's? ahhh!" Harry let out a continuous stream of whimpers trying to quiet his cries. Hermione finally got his hands away and pushed back his hair. the lightning scar was an angry bright red.
Harry was as Draco observed a very strange child. He was quiet and shy, he also had never played or heard of any games even the muggle ones like hide and seek.
"This is bloody delicious, what did you make, Malfoy?" Harry tried to put the bite into that but it lost it's usual flair and ended up sounding rather stupid from his mouth, which may have been the strangest part of the last 10 minutes. Well, maybe not, malfoy had made it in the first place and there was the whole you've lost your memory and Voldemort is dead, part to wrap his head around.
"Lilly Evens as in harry's mom? who was the third? " Neville asked. Lucius gave the classic Malfoy smirk.
" Oh is Draco scared of some griffendor first-years!" Ron taunted.
" Who is his magical gaurdian? " Narcissa asked McGonagall.
" Still.."
Malfoy. " He glared at the gossiping students. " Come along Potter," Harry woke with arms reaching towards him, and panicked, despite Luna, neville, Draco, and Snape's best efforts to call him. He ran for the door to the great Hall.
" Do you like reading Harry?" Ravenclaw girl asked. He smiled at her and nodded quickly. " What have you read before this?" Harry looked down and hugged the book tightly to him. He looked guilty almost.
Draco was anxiously walking between the tables of his fourth year class, trying to make sure they knew what they were doing, While attempting not to make some of his more shy students nervous. He was on the whole mostly confident that they all knew what they were doing. He had spent the previous week teaching them about the various reactions of the ingredients and had them memorize and recite the recipe. he passed a hufflepuff student who had written a tune for the recipe to help her remember and smiled. All of his students seamed to be fairing rather well. He was just helping Mr. Zambini with the fire under his cauldron when Harry burst through the door. Startling one of the ravenclaw students, miss Robinson to drop a vial into her cauldron which quickly turned her decent blue potion into a violent red. Draco quickly rushed over at her panicked. " Professor!"
The leaves would have distracted Neville if he could think past everything that had happened that day.
" Its rather hard to explain" she sighed.
"well, I couldn't let you go by yourself could I? Who knows what trouble you would have gotten into? It is still Hogwarts after all"
" Of course angel, just think of the books you want, what it's about or who gave it to you and they'll come right to your fingertips. " He closed his eyes and held his breath. He relaxed all at once and carefully pulled out a book, swallowed returned it to the bag and let it a shaky breath.
" I told them I went after the troll and Harry and Ron saved me. which was close enough to the truth I don't think Professor Snape caught it. But Professor macgonagll looked suspicions. She was furious with the three of us for disobeying the Headmaster and grilled Harry and Ron about going to a prefect or teacher if one of their 'friends' was getting into trouble again. she took point from me and gave Ron and Harry 5 each for " dumb luck". She was right about that anyway, and sent us to bed. "
" Harry? " McGonagall's eyes darkened with fury. " I told the headmaster what I thought of those wretched people from the beginning, but he refused to .... " She visibly calmed herself. " What are his injuries.?"
The first one continued his intent and broke the second's let with a jerk of the foot between his hands. The other didn't even make a sound. It was clear that the larger and older male was a muggle and the younger was a wizard so the malfoys wasted no time apprehending the man and calling the Aurors. Draco knew the small wizard on the ground was his mate and he fell to his knees in front of him. In spite of his injuries he was beautiful. Glittering blue and green and gold feathers adorned his hair and one wing  while the other looked like a dragons it was midnight black and the scales along the top shines in the sunlight.
Hermione was wonder, just how many things Harry had hidden from them. He was incredibly smart and obviously powerful, why did he always pretend otherwise. He was also quick to reassure both her and Ron that his relatives were treating him just fine and that there was nothing to worry about.
" Say I believe you, what's something only Malfoy would know." Draco tried to think back.
" Who are you anyway." Draco grumbled.
" I need to find them now! They're in danger. " Draco watched his parents hopefully and after spelling on a change of clothes on Draco who could care less at the moment, they apperated to Diagon Ally.
"Does this mean you want to be friends," he whispered, " with me?" he put his arm around his side and his wings and tail curled against him. Hermione almost melted right there.
" Professor Malfoy! Madame pomfrey wasn'-" Harry quickly drew his wand.
Snape and madame pomfrey looked at each other and nodded to McGonagall. Who stood and spoke.
Harry who was now only slightly transparent, put the flower behind the Slytherin's ear again.
" Lets go."
" That's not even all of it, but it's all we could find out before he reverted."
" lost in his--?
Hey guys I'm sorry this is short the next will be longer I promise I've just got stuff going on today. :/
Unfortunately, for Harry, filtch barged in the moment Harry got to the doors and Harry was knocked out by swinging door.
One of the healers currently looking through a diagnostic spell overheard the Malfoy. She turned to them.
"1995" Draco nodded, and Harry assessed him. " Who are you?"
" Harry." He didn't move. " Harry." He looked up at me.
"Well, that was wicked." the 3rd year grinned. she frowned.
" Harry and I switched beds first year because of his nightmares, so you might want him to sleep by a window, keep an eye on him will you." Neville said while weaslbee glared at both of them.
alright! I - he's back! Voldemort's" Harry's eyes darted around. " Where's Cedric? he asked me to bring him back! The cup!" Harry started searching the floor for something.
No one would or could ever hurt their mate under any circumstances. As Draco was Harry's it fell to him to look after him, and honestly, Draco was happy about the situation after remembering what his mum told him.
The healers made Draco stand back as they worked to see if he could be moved. Draco felt his mother grab his hand. He looked at his mate, the broken wings and he noticed for the first time an owl cage several feet away. The brid was frantic. Draco went over to the poor thing and opened the cage carefully helping it out while avoiding the snapping beak. Draco finally got a good look at the bird and realized whose it was.
He knew, not because of what his letters said, but because of what they didn't. Harry never really said much. But his letters had been filled with questions about Ron's family and Hermione, and written very sloppy. Not that Harry normally had good handwriting, but there were ink blotches all over the page and a few times the words had run into each other. Like he was writing in the dark. It also had no mention of the weather, and while that was sometimes the only thing he enjoyed at the durselys it was strangely absent.
" Alright there Harry?" Neville asked.
After the students had left the classroom, Draco led Harry to his office and made him a quick cup of hot white chocolate.
" It might be good to tell Harry that." they walked back over to Harry and Neville. Harry nervously looked everywhere expect them. Luna pushed Draco forward, he glared at her. since when was lovegood so  familiar with him.
Draco was sad about this he missed Harry's wings and just thinking about how sexy that tail would look on his potter, 15 year old potter, made have to hide the blush on his face, his heart frantic. Neville hated that his friend, even if his friend was currently a child, felt he had to hide himself. Luna, however, was thoughtful. she dragged Draco away while Neville was trying to get harry to move.
" Ron told everyone in the griffendor common room last week. " Draco rolled his eyes.
" Draco, why don't you take him to the Slytherin table for a moment. " Luna said while Ron and Hermione approached, but before Draco could get a hold of Harry they had arrived.
" Hermionie Granger punched me in the face our third year because I was being a brat. She broke my nose. I never told anyone about that, so only you, Ron and Hermionie know." Harry glared suspiciously.
" Look I, " she sighed, " I'm not a big fan of Potter, but I have a little sister. " She groaned," look what I'm trying to say is, I'll help you look after him." Draco scrutinized her. Luna was watching Harry, whose face was filled with confusion.
"Miss Robinson! what ingredient were you adding?" Harry put a hand to his head and groaned, as Draco cast some diagnostic spells.
He was tiny, and though his clothes shrank to fit him they still looked big on the small boy. Harry opened his eyes and stared at the celling puzzled.  Madam pompfrey cast a diagnostic  spell. Harry sat up and touched his wings in amazement, they had healed as he had reverted. He was petting the feathers of his right wing when he noticed the people in the room.
I spent 4 hours writing this starting at 12 am. I am beat.
" But surely he felt safe here at Hogwarts. "
I love comments! so tell me what you think. were there less mistakes or more?
Draco remembered the summer before his fourth year his father had pulled him aside. And after an hour of watching his father fill the room in protective spells, Lucius turned to him.
"What is that supposed to mean?"
" Gee- I'm so sorry da-" James started nearly dropping his wand.
" What's happening!" Draco yelled.
" A Malfoy!"
either take it from you or get into it will get cursed." Draco reached out and grabbed the bag holding it for a few seconds before dropping it. Then held out his shaking hand to show Harry. " See?" The palm of Draco's hand had a nasty burn where the strap had touched him. He looked at the bag again. " And that's just the outside anyone who tries to open it..." Draco pulled an the flap of the bag and sharp cracks ran through the air and Draco let out a repressed cry of pain and gingerly held his arm above the burns and broken fingers. " They harder you try the worse it gets. And if someone somehow managed to get through all of that, the books can only be called up by you. " Draco grimiced and cradled his arm. " Harry, no one can ever take your books away from you again. Draco winked at him. " It'll even work on you cousin." Harry picked up the bag with a whole new light before concerningly rushing over to Draco.
" Hi," she said quietly, and unlike with Narcissa he turned slightly towards her. " I snuck some food up here. " He eyes the food hungerly. " Do you want it?" Harry hesitated then crawled towards her inch by inch. As soon as he had the food he started back to the corner.
" Look Harry, both your wings sparkle!" Luna wispered. Harry looked at his wings and smiled brightly. He guided Luna's hand to his right and then left wings so she could feel them. Luna pouted playfully.
" Do I , do I get them back?" Harry whispered tears in his eyes. 'He was expecting me to say no.' Draco realized and rushed to comfort him.
" Of course he did." Draco sighed. " Alright, just look at the back of your right hand. There's a scar you probably don't remember right now. " Harry glanced at it while not taking his eyes off of the professor. " You told me you got that in fifth year. Your arm was cut during the third task, right? " Harry lowered his wand slightly.
The whale of a man glared down at the boy who'd ruined his life. He spit on the disgusting thing and started kicking it. He would kill it this time, it had gone too far.
" Why'd you give it to me?" Draco asked. She tilted her head and took it back. She slowly crawled to the bed without letting to food touch the ground.
" Of course, darling" she pulled a book from her robes " I forgot about this, it is a book on familiars for harry, he may have trouble reading it right now, so you'll have to help him, but he will probably want some information on his new companions. i imagine they will stay with him even after he reverts back. " Draco took the book and thanked his mother feeling more relaxed than he had since the morning of their trip to gringotts.
" And Potter?" Jessica frowned.
"so what happened? " Draco asked.
Draco who was getting quite frustrated at this point turned to snap at him. " Yes, you bloody hit and if you don't back off I will hex you into a hospital bed for the whole week!"
Yeah so I'm still lazy and I know it isn't a proper chapter length but I'll try to write more soon. It's like three in the morning.
hi i have the inspiration for the next chapter finally, but unfourtunatlly i can't write it. ii'm typing this with one hand. ive injured my other wrist, i dont know how long it will take to heal. so it will be awhile yet but i am still working on this.
"The way I heard it the three little firsties, stuck their noses where they didn't belong and almost got killed for it." Jessica laughed a little.
Draco-
" They are just resetting his bones. "  He told him. Draco tried to calm down.
" You're Potter, Harry Potter. Have you never heard your last name?" Draco asked. Harry shook his head.
" His gaurdians, dumny." The ravenclaw said.
" It's a magic bag Harry, they went into a magical storage place until called."
There is more to come  but I would love to hear what you think!
" Is it your mate?" Draco wordlessly nodded still recovering.
(See the end of the chapter for
The door to the infirmary burst open and Luna lovegood entered with bread and cheese min her arms, Neville longbottom trailed behind her.
" They, don't have the location. " I tried to reason even as my head spun with worry. Then we both felt the wards around the safe house where everything we hold dear was hidden. we raced out of the anti apparition boundaries and I grabbed his arm taking us to grimmauld place. We lunged through the floo right on each other's heels to the cottage by the sea. Donnabell and Rowle stood over the non-moving forms of Ginny Potter nee Weasley and Pansy Malfoy nee Parkinson. In a unison, I've only ever managed with former DA members Draco and I attacked them from behind. They defended themselves with every dirty trick and dark twisted spells in the book, but we met them tooth and nail it wasn't long until they were immobilized on the floor.
" You telling the enemy, your telling Malfoy things that are Harry's business alone you have no right to start spouting his secrets like that you know he doesn't want people least or all Malfoy knowing. Your giving him fuel for no reason. "
" Draco we need to talk. Your mother and I know this will be difficult for you to understand but everything we did was for your safety. We believe you're old enough to know now. In the first war your aunt Bella went crazy and to try to help her your mother and I joined the dark lord. All of our friends were swept up in his ideas and promises they were willing to do anything he said. We didn't agree your mother, Severus and I but we thought we could make them see reason before it got to dangerous.
" It's not as you think Minerva," she turned to Severus. " The boy is a four year old."
" Sorry." He snorted.
" Did you need something?" I shook my head and ruffles Harry's hair. He pulled on my sleeve so I knelt down again.
Jessica?" she asked, " could you look through this for the laws pertaining to sorcerers familiars, familiar magics, and cross-reference for mixed creature blood rights? oh, and purblood family privacy rights and privileges on the same subject. Purblood privileges apply to Harry right? He is from a noble family." Jessica scoffed.
" Your mothers -"
" I'll be on my best behavior, no adventures or duels to the death, I promise."
" I know that there are rumors going around, and nothing stays secret here for long so I will clear this up now. Harry Potter was injured after a creature inheritance before the term started and has reverted. For the present time I expect you all to treat him with respect until he either comes back or other arrangements are made. The Malfoy family and the ministry will be providing extra protection for the school. " She nodded to them. " If I hear of any harassment or threats to either Harry Potter or the malfoys you will be punished severely." She took a moment to glare at the room threateningly before returning to her seat.
" Well what does it matter he can see fine, or he seams too. "
" Secure Rowle and Donnabell. " There was a shout from the other room as more auors came from the floo and front door.
" It's different seeing it. When aun... They told me how it worked it didn't really believe them until I saw it, so I figured I'd hit two birds with one stone. " The elder Malfoy just shook his head and lead him out of the great hall, but before they left he could be heard telling his son, " just like your mother. "
Learning and reading and calling the worst part of him magic like it was okay, good even, had the same feeling he got when he stole food. He knew it was wrong, and that he shouldn't do it. He knew they would probably catch him or notice what was missing and he'd get the locked up again, or worse. But at the same time the fear was tinted by excitement. The thrill that kept him going when he was working for long hours and made him think the yelling and screaming was worth it. This was wrong and he was being very bad if it was real and ungrateful if it was a dream, but he liked it. He liked having a name and getting to eat everyday and the books. The books made him want to cry Because they weren't just books. People gave them to him, and looked at him like he was worth more than he knew he was. They gave him the books and he was allowed to read them! And even after he read them he could keep them, Draco even gave him a bag to protect them. Mrs. Malfoy gave him two whole toys! for him! and even though he had no idea what they were or how he was supposed to play with them he didn't want them to go back.
" To see how long it would take for our dad's to get together?" Scorpios smirked and turned a page in his book.
Draco got mad at him, see what he did and why. then he would know if he could trust him.
Useless.....
" For Harry,." She said.
-------------------------
hi i have the inspiration for the next chapter finally, but unfourtunatlly i can't write it. ii'm typing this with one hand. ive injured my other wrist, i dont know how long it will take to heal. so it will be awhile yet but i am still working on this.
"He's waking! Seditave!!" One of the nurses cried before everyone in the room was blown away from the bed.
" well, maybe i should learn owl it seams to be a quite interesting language." Draco paused, " They've tried his uncle he's in Askaban. imagine that, a muggle in Askaban. the others are being held until further notice at the ministry. There is no concrete evidence like witnesses or well, Harry's testimony to condemn them. but there is a lot of circumstantial evidence."
Draco didn't believe his father, nothing he was saying made sense after all but then that fourth year he watched Harry Potter and his friends with a different light.
He panicked and clammed up when she found a fairly recent bruise. She ran several diagnostic spells but found no other injuries. which she of course said made sense.
With a small flash of light a letter appeared in front of Harry, Hedwig chirped indignantly behind him.
"Married?!" He squeaked, " to you!? Have I gone crazy?" Harry deciding he could trust Draco Malfoy enough to lower his wand took a look at his hands. " Blimey, when did I get so huge?" He stood up and looked at the fourth years. " I'm gigantic!" Harry grinned.
" Ah!" He shouted before retracting his hand, it was red and blistered as if burned. I rolled my eyes.
" But Lady Malfoy and Mrs. Potter never did?" asked Neville. Lucius shook his head.
" Dad! dad! Where's? mum?" James asks. "  I don't remember sitting but Draco and I have been placed on the couch with James, Lilly and Albus on me, and Draco leaning on our pile of Potters, with Scorp in his lap. I hug my children tighter. " Uncle Draco where's aunt Pansy? " Lilly asks reaching out a hand and placing it his. I can't speak. I can't tell them. Ginny is so much better at this than I am. Draco meets my eyes, and seams to say ' I know but they should here it from us' .

Malfoy sprinted into the infirmary grabbed the calming drought, and rushed to Harry.
Harry reached a hand behind him and touched something that shouldn't have been there. Swallowing Harry eased himself up into a sitting position and the pain began to fade. Harry ran a shaky hand through his hair only to find more strange changes. His ears had become pointed and feathers mixed in with his hair. He reached both hands behind him and was even more confused.
" Thanks Harry." He went back to Robin hood. Harry is really smart, I wonder why he acts like an idiot when he got older.
" Where did they go?"
PS. in the next ch. there will be the Gringotts trip and we will get a list of all of Harry's inheritances.
Draco and hazel bickered. Harry was falling asleep on his lap.
" Harry, deep breaths, everything is fine. Voldemort is dead." Draco rushed to comfort him.
Ron remembered his wand and pointed it at the troll, but couldn't think of anything that would be useful. Harry couldn't keep up with the troll much longer and we were desperate. I remembered and helped Ron cast the spell from charms class that day and the spell hit the club. The troll didn't realize it wasn't in his hand anymore and swung at Harry with nothing a few times before it noticed. Ron got the club over the Troll just as the spell broke and it hit the Troll in the head knocking it out. It dropped Harry and we all scrambled away when it started to fall. the ground shook. I remember grabbing my wand and us frantically looking for Harry's. when we finally found it under some rubble from the cubicles we just kinda collapsed in exhaustion. Ron seamed to be in shock and I wasn't much better. Harry, who was still catching his breathe seamed like the only one who could do anything if it woke up.
" Luna, that familiar you talked about, I think sooner is better than later. Do you know what it is or where we can find it?" Neville asked having narrowlly avoided the glitter cloud. Malfoy looked like a fairy had cursed, then thrown up on him.
He didn't have reason to regret that until the night before he was supposed to get out, reluctantly dispatched by Madam Pomfrey just in time for the beginning of exams. Draco had expected some form of festivities from his few but stalwart remaining friends upon his release, but nothing the night before, which made him excited to hear multiple feet for once tromping in towards the hospital wing's only denizen.
"Don't worry, Longbottom, I'll sort you out when it's your turn!" Tonks yelled across the tent, and Neville flushed and hid behind one of the folding screens.
the Heir, not that anyone believes it-"
to cheer him on, for the biggest club game of his career. Really, it would be wrong
Draco squinted at him. "You mean you don't think I'm using a happy enough memory? Harry said he had trouble with that at first, at finding a strong enough memory to use..."
"Shut up, Sirius, shut up, I know you're lying, I know you were their Secret Keeper-"
Draco tilted his head grimly. "Yeah," he said, "You're right. Not
Potter laughed. He actually laughed, and Draco's gut clenched more painfully than it had when Ollivander told him whose wand had chosen him.
Theo blinked rapidly, swaying slightly, he was still so drunk. He did not look heartbroken, just still perplexed at the turn the world had taken for him, in this Slytherin-colored light over bleak unpolished stone. "You don't... you're saying you don't like me back?" he said again. "Draco, I... I know it took me a while to figure out. But I know what I want now. I..." He licked his lips, eyes going darker. He leaned closer to Draco, something more devilish in his eyes. "You don't know the things I
"Don't you listen, boy," Vernon snarled. "We don't need you getting any more freak ideas in your head. Get back in your cupboard!"
that, though," Harry breathed.
Wormtail went into a mania of fear, breath starting up as panting at almost the same time Draco's had, although he had no reason to try and contain his panic when he was very much begging for his life, almost praying to them. "Sirius- it's me... it's Peter... your friend... you wouldn't..."

"Draco!" Gilderoy exclaimed, so excitedly that Draco had to put a finger to his lips. Then he looked at Hermione and frowned. "My! You can't be Miss Granger! My best and brightest student! My, how you've grown!"
"Absolutely not," Hermione said, stepping between them, and Draco shook off Severus and advanced on them with the school growing quiet around them.
"Shut up, shut up!" Pansy yelled, cheeks red with a look that Draco knew from experience meant she was fighting back tears. "Of course Draco doesn't like her!"
He had succeeded only to discover that through poor planning, it let up in the middle of a glacier lake. So he had planned to work at it until he got the underground tunnel all the way to the other side of the lake. Then twenty-five children had arrived, and plans had changed.
"What can I say, Potter?" Draco said dryly, "Hogsmeade has attractions that cannot be properly enjoyed in the presence of Gryffindors." He had no intention of ever letting Potter find out about his visits to Grimmauld. With it being the last day of term before he had to go home to Malfoy Manor, he would definitely be stopping there while he still could.
Lupin's door was open, but Draco knocked on the door and waited to be invited in before entering. It seemed a small enough bit of respect to give for a year of such deficit in that quantity. "Come in!" Lupin called, with his things already all but packed, including his battered old suitcase, with the Grindylow tank empty, and thankfully the large case where the Boggart had lived empty as well. He looked surprised to see Draco, but not displeased. "Mr. Malfoy. I had hoped for the chance to say goodbye, and to thank you for everything you did this year..." Draco closed the door. "Everything you did this year for Sirius."
"See," Draco said brightly to a long-suffering Severus the next day. "All better in time for the first trip to Hogsmeade."
Millie flushed, looking down. "The reporter was a real pillock. I pissed him off, I think. I don't think I gave him what he wanted. He kept trying to get me to- to talk shit about what it was like playing for the Kingsnakes. About how you were a bad captain, and we hated each other, and it was all a farce. And I- maybe I should have gone along with whatever he wanted, to act like I really hate you- which I

"Scabbers!" Ron shouted, pursuing him, and Draco watched them go rooting for Scabbers to elude them. Hermione, though, was quickly off too, in pursuit of the more impressive Crookshanks, who proved to be a cat of a very large kind, with a smushed face not unlike the house elves on the walls of Grimmauld Place.
"I don't know," Draco said softly, after too long standing there trying to decide. Maybe this was why the Sorting Hat had taken so long on him. It would have been better to declare himself firmly one way or another, but his weak answer put a calculating intelligence in Granger's eyes regardless, and she pulled him back to his table by the wrist that had once worn the Dark Mark.
"Just promise you'll take me to the citadel. Tomorrow."
"You're going to tell me it's impossible, that it's stupid even to think it..."
"I'm alive too, if anyone's asking," Ron said crankily from their side, where his face was being licked by Fang.

"Draco," Hermione said, who had somehow been brave enough to march right up to Slytherin with an unworried face. "Draco, I'm sorry about on the train. There was this book I wanted to show you, could you come?"

entirely terrible attempts to play Beater, while the sunlight beat down on them in the open field, and it felt a very, very good thing to be alive.
"An interesting riddle, Mr. Malfoy. Let us say the blue thread is the original, until the point that time traveler's mind departs that timeline, and the red timeline is the new timeline that begins in the moment the traveler's mind reenters its body at an earlier age." McGonagall tapped her wand and an eraser reformed into a small, cute pink figure of a person. "Do you understand?"
"Draco," Flitwick began warmly. "I'm thrilled to have you join us in Ravenclaw. I can't imagine a more perfect place for so gifted a student."
"Wait," Draco said, a new horror filling his mind. "Millie- when I saw Nissy- Nissy, you were spying on her practicing, you said just because you missed the Kingsnakes- but that was for-"

Barcelona has been rocked in recent months by the disappearance of many of its magical citizens without explanation. The mystery was solved with the discovery of Castell de L'Infern, long thought destroyed, an ancient medieval castle that was the stronghold of the infamous Vampir Senyor Seguinis Sade de L'Inframon. Seguinus preached the superiority of vampires over wizards, and advocated for the enslavement of all humankind. Seguinus had been thought dead three centuries ago, but he was slain in combat by the famed Bruixots de Sang of Barcelona, the feared BDS, not three days ago. The sole human companion to Seguinus's band of bloodthirsty monsters? None other than the missing Gilderoy Lockhart, unmasked as an imposter by the wounded wizarding world, while he absconded into the Spanish Pyrenees with murderous monsters.
"What about Remus Lupin?" Draco heard himself say. "You don't think he'd believe you?" Black looked gobsmacked. "You know he's the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, right? And he told Harry he was friends with his father..."
"I wouldn't think," Theo said coldly, in contrast to Harry's fading composure, "That you know much of anything, Potter. Nor would I think you much use, save as a blood donor, so unless you're planning to offer some, I suggest you leave your betters alone-"
"Now what?" said Weasley.
Peter Pettigrew and his shiny new silver hand were thrown into the air. Green light went the brightest, fire-white at its center, as that rodent face had its beady eyes blown out wide in surprise and forever frozen that way. He crumpled to the ground like a rag doll, a marionette with all its strings cut by the green mist that engulfed him and swallowed him whole like the deepest of dragonfire, and then his body lay dead beside Harry Potter.
"The First Task is-"
He talked about the wands that had melted when Mother took him to Ollivander's, the force field a block around it the next time, the brands that had been left on the hands of not just his parents, Sirius, and Karkaroff, but Umbridge, and Umbridge's by means of the Flagrante curse. He told her about that and the Blood Quill and the threats he'd made against Umbridge to protect Harry and Severus and the Slytherin team, about using Cauterizo on Umbridge, talking and talking until his tired throat was beyond sore.
Draco walked over and sat in the chair facing her desk, with the distinct feeling that if she could, she would bring those awful Technicolor kittens on the plates behind them to life, and feed his precious hair to them. "Professor Umbridge," he said, with the precisely calculated respect he had failed to show her thus far in the red line. "I read your Educational Decree this morning along with the rest of the school. I saw that it applies to team activities as well. As the captain of the Slytherin House Quidditch team, it falls on me to request your permission to formally reinstate it."
"It's a snowdrop," Remus told them, in an elated voice that left no doubt Draco had done a good job. Then again, from how Remus was looking over at Sirius, he might have said yes even if Sirius had proposed with a ring in the shape of the bloody Dark Mark. "It is, isn't it, Sirius? He always used to always give me snowdrops he gathered on Valentine's Day..."
going to be alright. We can all go and see him later. Bill's sitting with him now. He's going to take the morning off work."
Harry did not seem so horrified at the idea of Draco's Astaroth costume once he actually saw it. His face tended more towards slack-jawed awe, the far more appropriate reaction.
"Oh," Harry sighed, then leaned forward, seeming to steel himself. "Okay. My mind's a dagger now. Ask me any question."
"I'd wear it at Hogwarts," Draco said confidently. "Every
It was in his own best interest, though, however selfless any action might seem in the short term. He had a future he had to save, to keep things from being even worse for him and his mother. A future that needed Potter to kill the Dark Lord for them. And in that future, a lot of Gryffindor things had to happen.
"You took his

"We have something to say to you, alright?"
And Dobby was officially smarter than the Minister of Magic. Not really surprising, when it came to Cornelius Fudge. "So will a lot of magical creatures, probably. We'll need you to keep the elves on our side..."
"Please, Dante, I'll do anything! What do you want? Money? Or- House Black- I'll acknowledge you, I'll name you my heir-"
"So you really do think now that they're-" Blaise began, with the sound of a discussion being picked back up from more than a few times before.

He thought of trying to invite Harry out for a night flight that Friday night, a midnight interlude between just the two of them like in years past in the opposite roles. But he lost his nerve at dinner that night, and spent midnight alone, tossing his wand in the air half-hoping and half-fearing it would somehow fall and break.
After two games each, Gryffindor had an aggregate of 210, and Slytherin had one of 170, with Ravenclaw at -130. The advantage was Gryffindor's from playing their match later, and knowing the score they'd need to win by to get the Cup. That had arguably been what gave them the victory in third year. But the only solution for Slytherin, then, was just to run up the score against Hufflepuff so much, Gryffindor could know the deficit but find it too steep a hill to climb.
to show up?"
Otherwise, Draco thought he had escaped scot-free, as none of his friends nor even Severus said anything about it after. But there was one noble champion racing to come to Harry's aid, and it was, well, a champion.
No one but Luna would have thought this hat wasn't embarrassing regardless, especially as they were naturally joined by her ex-boyfriend Neville- what a strange for a Neville Longbottom to be,
very long after. This was uncharted territory for him as well. He tried resolutely not to think of how Severus had died, and whether it had been ever-bleeding wounds from venom to do him in, rather than something direct and instantaneous like...
"Draco," Hermione said, touching his arm, and he didn't know what she wanted.
Draco's breathing was somewhat unsteady, and he felt so empty and chilled inside it was like a cleaver had been driven underneath his skin and tried to hollow him out from beneath starting with his lungs. But Potter was the one unconscious, who Lupin was crouching besides calling his name, so Draco followed suit.
The first test of that resolution, whose inclusion on the second list attested to its failure on the first, came on August 19, the prearranged date set with Hermione for their trip to Diagon Alley. Her owl told him the date still worked, and that Potter was spending the end of his summer break at the Weasleys', who'd agreed to meet them. Though Draco told himself he had no one to impress there, he spent entirely too long dressing himself, for someone whose mirror still showed him as an undergrown albino runt. At least he had more sense this time around than to affect the awful slicked-back style he'd thought made him look so stylish, and had just made him look more like his father. Instead, he just pushed it behind his ears where it was getting long, and resolved to cut it at his chin once it grew that long.
He cares about you, and worries about you, and he wants to know you, so badly. He wants to adopt you, to take you from those purple-faced Muggles and give you a life, a family. A real family. He says you seem just like your father."
"You will also find a Muggle photograph, and a spelled miniature replica of the tapestry that replicates its current status. As you will see, Bellatrix Lestrange has been disinherited from House Black. Due to her lifetime prison sentence, she has no means to contest this disinheritance. As you may observe, while Sirius Black is currently at large again from Azkaban, he was disinherited many years ago. My mother, the only living member of the Black line, is not only female, but has formally ceded any claim to the Black funds and titles. Is not the account in the name of House Black, rather than House Lestrange? And can there be any doubt to the legitimacy of this tapestry? I have brought a witness of unimpeachable stature to the disinheritance of Bellatrix Lestrange, Harry James Potter. Will

"Two graves!" Draco exclaimed, staggering backwards with a ghoulish laugh escaping him. He stumbled and fell laughing to sit in front of Periander's grave. "Read it! There's only one name, but there's two graves, Theo, is that what you wanted to know? There will be more graves!
?" He forced himself not to immediately ask
"Draco Malfoy will not be left to hurting like this!"
"Harry, I'm not going back with all of you on the train, I don't know if you know..." He didn't want to mention that he was the one who got to go home with Sirius and Remus, not now.
"The banishing charm," she ordered, and he duly cast Depulso and sent the beret flying away. "Vermillious," she said, and he sent up red sparks, unable to hide the boredom on his face, while Flitwick beamed in naive pride. On it went, through the third and fourth-year charms, until Umbridge seemed to realize she was getting nowhere, and went on to things he shouldn't have to know at the start of fifth year.
Hey all! To address some questions, if there's still some uncertainty about the music box present, that's understandable- I doubt Draco fully understands what he meant by it, let alone Harry at receiving it. After Harry asked for letters/summer contact so long, it has a note of 'Be careful what you wish for'. Draco gives him a present, but it's not exactly one most people would want. Kind of like giving someone a lump of coal for Christmas. It's a counterbalance to having given Harry a present as beautiful as the Quidditch snow globe. And it's an object that Draco found very funny.
"Scabbers is whom?"
"You'll regret this," Draco growled. "Sooner or later, you will look back at this, and you will regret that answer. I will
As he descended, he could hear Harry complaining to Hermione that she was such a buzzkill, and Hermione telling Harry that she didn't think Draco would want to date anyone without at
Past the Hufflepuffs, Harry was looking over, transparently jealous- not a surprise- while the others were watching the Sorting. Draco gave a sheepish smile, then jerked his head in the direction of Hermione. Harry looked miffed but got her attention. She
Also, although Draco knows about the official history of Sirius, and the circumstances of his death and Harry's grief, he doesn't know much else. Things Draco does not know- whether Sirius was actually a Death Eater or spy, anything about the incident with Pettigrew and the Muggles other than the official story, anything about Animagi, that Peter Pettigrew is alive or that he is Wormtail/Scabbers, Sirius's history with Severus or Remus, etc.
"Like I said, I don't need details." Remus gave him a comforting pat on the back. "Nor am I here to criticize or condemn."
Severus had to do everything alone

It wouldn't be a particularly sophisticated code, but maybe it wasn't meant to be.
"Luna," Draco whispered, pulling her aside after dinner. She beamed, squeezing his arm. She seemed ready for merriment, while he suddenly felt a hundred years old, and a hundred kilometers away from anyone's touch. "Listen, the necklace your father's wearing..."
friends, they're just her hangers-on. Study partners."
"Fine. Dracosanguis," Draco cast experimentally, and nothing at all seemed to happen. Everyone just elected to ignore his failed spell and carry on.
"With hexes, Hermione Granger," Dobby said, "And with the walking stick on his back. But Draco Malfoy would not say, so Dobby thought he should do what Draco Malfoy wanted and stay silent. But then Draco Malfoy was getting very sick from the beating, so Dobby could not watch, and Dobby told Lucius Malfoy the truth."
"Not without my magic!"

or something," Draco hastily corrected. "I'm not saying it didn't mean anything...
"Oh, right, sorry," Harry breathed, and seemed to have forgotten why they were there. When Draco pointed at the golden egg, he looked at it like he had never seen it before, then looked back at Draco. Hopefully, he wasn't contemplating splashing Draco again. "It's just- God, Draco, I can't
"Opaleye!" Dantanian hissed, eyes and voice brimming with longing. "Maman, Maman, please, can I have it, I'll hatch it, I'll take care of it, please, you say I'm the heir to-" She touched his shoulder at that, giving him a far sterner look than she had yet delivered him. He hastily shut his mouth, as if aware he had nearly publicly said a secret he could not tell. "It's an Opaleye egg," he said more quietly.
"How dare you!" both Potter and Black growled at once, before turning to look at the other after the jinx, a fondness crossing Black's face that you would have to be dead not to see.
"Okay, fine," Harry scowled, and went over to stand in the forming circle, wand out. It sent another pinprick of self-doubt through Draco. He was already regretting sticking his neck out, nasty looks towards Luna or not. But he couldn't back down now without looking like a coward. "This isn't going to work, Draco, even for you. Twenty-eight stunners-"
At least after the graveyard, he didn't think Harry would be quite as inclined towards that particular bit of foolishness.
"I do not need to be told," Shacklebolt said warmly, "How talented a wizard Draco is. As are you, Harry. You both take after your godfathers. And if I needed a reminder, Draco, Filius and Minerva have both been eloquent about your extraordinary capabilities in practical magic. Did you know that Minerva McGonagall is of the opinion that you both would make fine Aurors?"
. You are a wizard- if not of great age, and perhaps not of any great wisdom- that remains to be seen- but at least, I am sure, a wizard of power. But power is not enough. You need clarity, if you are to be the one I can trust. You have to understand the nature of the beast."
?" he gasped, grabbing at his stomach as it began to hurt from laughing too hard. He got severe looks from the trio. "Millie thinks I'm trying to
And then Potter stuck out what Draco had waited for on the train to Hogwarts that had never come. Harry Potter's outstretched hand, offered for him to shake.
Fred and George made an official ranking sheet and dueling bracket, at which they placed themselves, then Draco, then Harry at the top, though they had to move themselves down after being bested by Draco, Hermione, and then, much to Draco's overwhelming excitement, Ron. When Ron beat George at their practice duel in mid-March, it was all Hermione could do to stop Draco from charging the dueling bubble to hug him. Once Ron was out, Draco cast Vermillious to celebrate, shooting red sparks up into the air, and then did the unthinkable: formally declared him to have ascended to the heights of the number one Weasley on Draco's personal ranking.
"It was all a lie, wasn't it," Draco said with a start. "Needing to help more with the citadel's reconstruction, that was just an excuse to get Severus here, to research, once he found out the place could be
The Aurors wasted precious seconds trying to figure out if Black had cursed them before they got him, then searching Black for something on him that was making them drowsy. Nymphadora was yelling, mouth movingly silent to Draco's ears, looking around without seeming to see the music box- and somehow, Draco's charm to push the box forward had also surrounded it in a knot of inky shadow.
So Draco's ears hadn't deceived him. Harry Potter was asking him to take a bath together.
"Okay, okay, I get it," Remus gasped, taking a shuddering breath. Then he stared down with Sirius with such a despairing look on his face, Draco felt the gut-punch of the conviction Remus was about to say no. But instead, Remus breathed out, "Sirius, I can't lose you. Not you. Not you too. I can't... if we do this, promise me, promise me you won't leave me too.
Dantanian thought hard, but when he remembered, he said the answer with pride. "Because I am more powerful." She gave him a pat on the head for his correct answer. "I proved it the day I was born, when my magic set the Muggle hospital on fire and killed all those people by accident." He looked sadder. "And Grandmother."
"Indeed," Severus intoned. "Karkaroff is gone."
Once Draco had started to get to know Ron as more than an annoyingly ginger presence at their table, it had been a bewildering realization that Ron
"Fluffy," Weasley offered helpfully.
"And in our first year," Neville hastened to add, "He saved that Philological Stone-"

"Why," Severus said, with his voice showing a struggle not to hex each and every person in the room, perhaps even Draco, "Is the
"Brave indeed, Mr. Black," Dumbledore said with that glimmer of irony. "And not over-keen on self-preservation. Not so much the Ravenclaw as the Gryffindor." It was hard not to think back then to the Hat telling Draco he would never belong in Gryffindor.
Draco knew he'd miscalculated from how huge Potter's eyes went. "You mean like a date?"

Severus's nod had Draco getting excited, lashing out at the remaining dummies to show off. He had been going back to old lessons from the blue loop this summer, and practicing on his own. He had some things to show off.

Any hopes formed by breathless reporting on Sirius's looks were dashed the next day, when Remus's testimony proved a controversial highlight. Remus had been unhappy to be called by the prosecution, to say the least, but he and Dumbledore had prepared. They'd assumed it would be establishing his belief that Sirius had been Secret Keeper, and his continued conviction of Sirius's guilt until recently, and they'd assumed correctly.
"It's not bad," Luna breathed, and he crawled over to hug her. "It's happy tears. I just... I never thought I could do something like this. The potion worked. Whatever happens now, the potion worked. And it wasn't by myself, I just helped you, but... we did it. We did it

It had to be worth a try.

"My mother, she- she showed me memories in her own Pensieve of my Aunt Bella after I got her wand, so I could understand- Merlin, Severus, he was mad like her..."
"I'm not," Draco said grimly. "I already promised Severus, alright? And yes, I haven't made it a secret, I don't intend to wait around like a sitting duck for my aunt to get me, I want to take the fight
"They can play without Seekers for a while. And here I didn't think we'd be alone till August. Are you really going to just bust in on me when I'm changing and leave-"

The booze kept pouring, the music blaring, and the chants kept on coming, even the Draco Malfoy chant, which Luna had been trying to make catch on for years in Slytherin House. It only just seemed to catch on in time to blast into Severus's ears, when he showed up at 4 am threatening Unforgivables should they not all go to bed at once:
"My last visit to your common room didn't end so well, if you recall," Draco drawled, grateful for the subject to have been changed.
"'Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record already, back in his own country, and he didn't want Ariana set to his account too. And Albus was free, wasn't he? Free of the burden of his sister, free to become- whatever it is the world
Remus had said he would move another bed to Draco's spacious room to share it if he wanted, though there would be enough rooms anyway. Draco lost interest in the idea, though, when he found out they wouldn't let him have Hermione up there. No matter how many times he tried to argue that he was gay, Remus remained adamant that she shouldn't have to share a room with a boy for her sake. So both she and Ron would be getting their own rooms downstairs.
Harry's face broke into a huge, helplessly fond grin, and he grabbed Draco by the arm. The touch felt like a permanent clamp on his limb, with the knowledge trying to force its way into Draco's head, inadmissible until he was alone. Or at least not in front of hundreds. "Come on, then, you great Horklump," said Harry, and Draco had to be the one to grab the little girl's hand.
Once he won by default, watching her get taken down by her own Cruciatus, he had the displeasure of hearing himself interrogate her, threatening with a pathetic, broken voice. When she cackled to kill her, she looked more terrifying than ever, more in control. It was hard to believe Sectumsempra would have worked on her, even if he hadn't been distracted by Remus's scream.
"It's alright," Draco said with his bravest smile. "Happy Christmas, Severus."
"It's the name of the founder of Citadelle Xaphan," Draco said quickly, "Dantanian Black," and led Aberforth in before he could think on it overlong. "So anyway, I know Gilderoy comes off as-"

"Mr. Malfoy?"
In his haste to throw everything aside and get clean of it, he'd emptied the pockets of his robe entirely. That left the empty draught of peace on the floor, along with his wand and the Mirror of Espilce. And his dagger. It sat there silent and still, yet it was like another living thing in the room with them, with the sinister glint of its moonstone hilt, an object that she knew lost and now somehow recovered. It had been the most beautiful thing he owned, and perhaps it still was, but it was also the ugliest now.
"You asked for my help, though," Theo persisted. "You did want to try and fix this before-"
"How?" said Granger nervously, and impulsively, Draco reached out and squeezed her hand. He told himself it was for her, even though he knew it was him who needed the reassurance.

He had invited Dobby to come celebrate Sirius's victory, given the not-small part he'd had in making it happen, but Dobby had insisted he would feel ill at ease, and just looked forward to seeing Draco at Hogwarts. Draco hoped that when they reunited, he found Dobby had gotten at least one or two of the other elves around to not thinking him a dangerous freak.
"I miss Harry a lot. I miss certain parts of him an
Hermione stepped between Draco and their captive again. Karkaroff was already trying to answer Draco's string of questions. "He said Grindelwald had made the wand. That he had followed a trail to New Zealand, and then to Ollivander's. He said if anyone knew the truth, it would be Grindelwald. And he said going after Grindelwald did give him the answers he wanted."
"And you- you're the
manipulation or touching to influence him. The letter itself, with sufficient explanation and context, would do the work for him. If not, there was Aberforth's story about Ariana. No one would hate that story as much as Harry. If Harry needed to hear it from Aberforth's own lips- well, the passage from the Room of Requirement to the Hog's Head was just a sentence away.
"No fur hat this time, Draco?" Draco used his wand to wave the entrance shut behind him, and Potter's eyes followed the motion of his hands. "Oh, uh, your gloves are, like, cool. Your whole, um, outfit is- cool, yeah..." Potter's eyes went to himself next, sweeping ruefully over his very different Muggle clothes- a green H Weasley jumper, heavy black puffer coat, and baggy blue jeans, with large chunky black boots, hair as disheveled as ever. "I'm sorry- I didn't know if I should dress up, or..."
"We can't let a drop of it splash on
... really, does that befit... mmm... the savior of the wizarding world... really, the great Chosen One Saint Potter shouldn't be so-"
Severus could recognize one of Draco's panic attacks easily by now, and administered a draught of peace at once, with Valerian root tea not long in following. He sat with Draco in that classroom for an hour, far from the scent of Amortentia, and said little, his face unmistakably guilty. But he had done nothing wrong.
"I have an idea," he said.
"Listen," Harry said intently, and by the time he was done explaining his plan, Luna had given up any pretense of not listening.
him there, but there was so many people, why him, why was
"Grindelwald, right?" Draco slurred, and Dumbledore looked so stricken at the casual show of knowledge, he had to show his allegiance. For some reason, his mind decided the best way to do so would be singing. "Stille Nacht," he warbled agreeably. "Heilige Nacht..." But he trailed off at the sight of Dumbledore going forward, examining the mirror. He stood there for some time. Draco let his head loll forward, the weight such that he nearly fell asleep, before Dumbledore was shaking his shoulders.
Severus waited for him, then seemed to see Draco would not deduce it so quickly. Absurdly, Draco felt a pang of shame for not being clever enough in front of his godfather. "What did he do?"
She looked to be barely resisting the urge to crush him in yet another hug.
When the door to McGonagall's office opened, the first thing Draco saw was the symbol around Xenophilius Lovegood's neck: a triangle with a circle inside, and a line through that circle.
Please. As if Potter cared enough- had ever cared enough, to waste his time with anything this elaborate against
, Draco. Hagrid told Madam Pomfrey what happened, and she reported the injury to the higher-ups. I couldn't have
He had a lesson plan made up, at least, by the next Monday at 8, though it was without a sheet like the dueling lessons, nor did he show any of it to Harry. "Trust me," Draco said, "This is harder than any spell I taught you in dueling. Maybe all of them together." He didn't know if Harry's natural ability with magic could extend to magical mental discipline. He performed well in classes, but that was more raw talent than academic focus. Draco would have to hope Harry would be better at this than he feared. If not, they could be spending a lot of Monday nights together.
"You shouldn't!" Draco yelled, which meant he could not breathe for a good long while. Hands shaking, he ran them through Harry's dark hair, trying to reassure himself Harry was there and unhurt and still real, still not lost to him. "Did it occur to- to you... Harry, you- that- that I could have gotten the spell wrong, and that... that burns, burns the same- real fire, Harry-"
"No," said Draco. "
McGonagall's lips tightened, though more understanding seemed to come on her face. "One would be remiss to expect you to simply forget the events of that night. Even if they have been successfully hidden from public knowledge. But do you believe that what you did means you no longer deserve success and happiness in your future?"
" Madame pomfrey said something about accidental magic."
" Harry did this?" Hermione poked the cloud.
" What's this I've heard about Mr. Potter injured." Minerva was impatient, why the didn't contact her imedeantly was beyond her. She was his head of house and hated the thought of one of her lions hurt. " Well?" Madame pomfrey ran a hand across her face.
" Ms. Evens?" Hermione asked, Lucius turned away, and composed himself.
" Now, don't be dramatic, you haven't killed him, it was an accident anyway." Harry turned over and curled up holding his head.
The ravenclaws stared at Luna curiously, as Luna seamed to lift something they couldn't see onto her lap. But Luna was know for doing and saying odd things.
" Wait!" Lilly shouted her own wand raised, as she blocked Albus and Scorp from coming forward. " What story did you tell me when I had the dream about James getting hurt?" James catching on re raised his wand pointing at Draco while Lilly's was trained on me. I scrambled my brain trying to remember, but coming up empty.
" You just had to become more freakish.you ungeatful brat" Harry rushed to his wand on the bedside table.
" I never- no one's-- thank you so much." This time he did start crying and he got up and hugged me tightly. " Thank you, thank you, thank you!" He wispered and you could hear the joy and pure graditude in his quiet voice. He hugged Ms. Welling too, just as fiercely and thanked her.
" Okay, Okay. Its okay Harry" she picked him up and cradled him in her arms rushing to the hospital wing. " will one of you find Draco Malfoy? shh shh shh, its okay Harry, it'll go away soon. everything's gonna be fine."
Harry's magic was becoming uncontrollable in everyway. Every two minutes a loud bang would echo through the room and some variety of glitter, feathers, ashes, leaves, or moths would cover the room. Draco vanished the feathers when they appeared, but no spell worked on getting rid of glitter, unfortunately. The ashes while disturbing usually distracted Luna enough to say something to the rest of them but as none of them could understand the strange mixture of owl hoots and English she was currently speaking, it did little good to let the others know what she were thinking.
" Now I wish I had wings like you handsome. Wana meet my friend neville?" Harry looked up nervously before nodding. Luna turned and introduced everyone in the room he avoided the gaze of the adults but shyly smiled at Draco and Neville.
" But it doesn't exist anymore! We only have records of it or artificial versions and this one is real you can tell by the blue on the tips of the leaves. "
"But are you ready for the snake pit?" Neville shuddered dramatically. After they had finished taking Harry's things into the Slytherin dorms, they headed to the great hall for lunch and to meet with Hermione and Harry. Weaslbee was trying to glare and stuff his face at the same time, and Hermione just carried a small mountain of books for Harry. Who also held several.
" Perhaps he has more than one." A ravenclaw said. Luna smiled at her. Draco eyes her suspiciously.
" I said, maybe harry is worried about his relatives. I imagine they said somethings that may be causing this, they wouldn't want people to find out about what they were doing to harry. It may be why he never told anyone. Do you know what's happening with them? has your father told you? they've already had their trial right? "
" I'm pretty sure I know your answer but, what year is it?" Harry ran some fingers through his hair and winced putting a hand to his side.
"Easy Harry, it's alright."
" You can see her at breakfast in a little while. We have some time before we need to go down. " He nodded. He picked up the dragon and niffler and set them in his lap hugging them briefly before picking up the book and the started reading. He had a small smile on his face and when I looked over at welling she seamed to be holding in an awww.
"What did she say happened?" I asked gently while I snapped my fingers on either side of his head with no response.
"No! Harry don't do that. please. It's no good, it just makes things worse. don't lock away your emotions. Please, love." Harry startled when he felt hands on his face, but strangely even though he knew whose hands these were, they felt familiar with a warm affection that made him feel as though it didn't matter if he fell apart because these hands would protect and hold him until he could pick himself back up. It was terrifying, and liberating and ached with a kind of hope he didn't understand, but all he knew was that he was so exhausted.
Harry was fascinated by the screaming plants and eating plants and all the different flowers. His Draco would tell him about potions you could put some in. There was a pritty flower now that Luna made, Harry could tell it wasn't real because it floated around and flowers don't do that, so he reached out and touched it. There was a flash of light and the pritty flower fell real to the ground. Harry picked it up and put it in a very shocked draco's hair.
Harry was overjoyed, all of his fifth year students had been able to produce the starting wisps of the patrons, and a handful of students had been able to create shields. It was only the second day! when he had started teaching here Harry had a hard time figuring out what to teach each year respectively. He found it hard to stop himself from trying to prepare them fro a war that was already over. Harder still to realize what subjects and spells were appropriate for the younger years, and give them an appropriate hands on experience. As well as give the older students a Challenge with out pushing them to hard too fast and prepare them properly for their Owls and N.E.W.Ts. He couldn't wait to tell his favorite potions professor.
here's another chapter it's longer this time, sorry about the other one. Please tell me what you think of it. Do you want to hear more stories about Harry's parents in this version. I can go into the Malfoy's relationship with Voldemort why they did things, what they knew about. also I hope that clears up the mate thing, yes they are mates but they will not have the intense mating feelings until harry is back to himself and I have a lot more planned with little harry first so before we get to the drarry stuff there will be a lot more of little harry. if its still unclear about harry and Draco being mates and how that works right now here's a little more about it. harry has his creature inheritance so he can smell  that Draco, his mate , is someone safe and trustworthy. Draco's scent also can be a soothing smell to Harry. Draco who has not had his inheritance yet, as he is still just fifteen, feels protective but not possessive of harry. He is also concerned for Harry's well being a little more personally and he would still be able to tell is harry was in distress. If harry was 15 year old harry instead of 4 year old harry than Draco would be possessive and affectionate as well as attracted to harry. and when Draco comes into his inheritance there would be very little that could stop him from jumping the harry ,that is his age, 's bones. the mate bond changes due to the circumstances of both. somethings cause a strain in a mate bond or block most of it from being felt. and Draco and harry's mate bond didn't really have a chance to develop much before all the craziness started happening. and it won't develop until they are both of sound mind and body. Which harry is not.
" Draco felt his mate in danger this morning, so we left for gringotts to try to find his mate with the blood test. " Narcissa took hold of her husband's hand before continuing. " Soon after we arrived his mate with a portkey letter appeared on the steps."
Sincerely, griphook'
" If there's anything you don't understand, you can ask any of us. Okay Raven?" I jolted a little when I said the nickname again it just slipped out. He looked up and nodded beaming the most adorable smile I have ever seen. As he read he grew more relaxed is ever seen him and stared moving more. Fidgeting in the way you'd expect a little kid to do.
'BANG' ashes covered the room, Draco flicked his wand to the trash bin absently and the ashes followed.
"Harry, please this is not what you think. I care about you, outside of whatever obligation is still there. As for what I've done? Who was it that held me the night Scorpios and albus got their Hogwarts letters. Who was it that stayed by me when the reporters trashed my name through the papers and I couldn't go out without being attacked. and when I couldn't sleep from nightmares. Was all of that obligation for you?" I sighed," Harry, can't I want you Because you make me happier than I've been in a long time? Please, give this a chance. If we find out we're terrible for each other than I'll still be there for you and the kids, as I know you will for me. we have to try. we owe it, if not for ourselves than for each other to take a chance for happiness."
"It was the day of the Halloween feast, when we had the levitation charm lesson. Ron threw a rather nasty comment about me after class and I was upset and hid in the girls bathroom. they told me after, when quirrell ran in about the troll he dropped in a faint right after and everyone screamed until Dumbledore sent them to the dorms. they started to go to griffendor but remembered about me and snuck off to warn me about it and get back to the tower. The troll came in just as I started to leave. Thirty feet of muscled irritated mountain troll blocking the only exit. Harry and Ron ran in yelling to distract it so I could get away. The boys were throwing things and insulting it, but it was so huge and angry I couldn't get past. I was trapped in the corner. It went after Ron so i screamed to get it's attention and Harry jumped on it's back." at this point little Harry fell out of his chair with a thud. He stared at me with round wide eyes. Questions swirled in his expression but he didn't voice them.
" Harry?" she asked softly. He pressed the heal of his hand into his forehead. He started breathing faster.
" Shut up, Malfoy!" Draco smiled wider.
While Hermione dug up information on familiar laws, the ravenclaws had taken to teaching Harry how to turn percents, into fractions and reduce them, (basic skills needed before one started Arithmacy, and also very helpful in Potions). Hermione paced between a row in the forbidden section and the creatures and magical beings section. To the delight of the Ravens Harry started making his way through simple equations, having learned multiplication, and division from Draco that morning.
The four teenagers exchanged a glance.
"It was more terrifying really, for all three of us. We were eleven. we spent the rest of the night curled up wrapped in blankets on the big armchair in the common room. Harry was tiny first year so we just fit. The next morning we were friends. I don't think we even said anything, it was recognized between us, something like surviving a troll made us friends. The only other people that would apply to is maybe professor Lupin. "
