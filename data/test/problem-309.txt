The question, so plain and simple, caused a disproportionately heavy feeling in Draco's stomach. Finally steeling himself, he nodded. "Yes, I'll be there shortly."
"Two children, Harry. We have two beautiful children, and it's so unexpected and beyond our scope, and I'm scared and terrified because we're fucking
"Any news?" he asked hopefully. Given that he didn't really have spousal privileges (he thought of this with a lot of bitterness), he had to depend on either Arthur or Molly for Ginny's medical updates.
"Goodbye, Harry."
"But you already are," he said softly, wrapping her in a hug. "You don't need to prove yourself to anyone. Do those blokes in the Council -"
didn't even merit a proper Patronus call." He gave an exaggerated harrumph and dramatically turned his nose up for added effect.
Harry already knew that. Ginny had been in the training pool since last year, and got called quite often during the rotations, which meant that her professional future was promising.
Which of course, he knew wasn't exactly the truth, but if he were honest with himself, he could even admit that he had rather enjoyed the last hour being Potter's emotional crutch.
Draco lifted her hand to his lips and brushed the back with a gentle kiss. "I would die before any harm befell you or our son, no matter where we are," he whispered reverently.
"Harry, what are you talking about?"
Throughout the process, Draco still couldn't wrap his head around what was actually happening. Especially when he knew that some parts of the chant included very heavily laden connotations, roughly translated to terms such as 'dear', 'beloved' and 'heart of hearts'. The irony of it all did not escape him.
In fact, Harry believed, they had both done each other a favor tonight, and given each other some much-needed peace of mind. How and why, precisely, were beyond him.
After them, there was a whirlwind of witnesses presented to the court. Most of them were witnesses to the "crimes" of the Malfoy family, but a majority were obviously full of contempt at the mere mention of the name. A few were from pureblood families who had remained neutral in the war, and they spoke for the defense of the Malfoys. Of course, they were not taken as seriously.
"If you could name your son, then," Potter suddenly had a serious look in his eyes. "If you could get rid of those old traditions, what would you name your son?"
Malfoy's expression changed into that of surprise.
Astoria merely nodded absentmindedly, and Draco knew that her attention had already transferred to elsewhere.
Astoria shook her head. "I know nothing, darling. Any enemies I might have gained would have ended only in petty quarrels of little intellect. No one I know would have reason to resort to such an open threat..." Her usually sunny complexion had turned pale as milk upon hearing about the mysterious letter, and she had been quiet for most of the time since Draco had called the family to meet. There was still a hint of a tremor in her delicate fingers, as if they were no longer under her control.
"You sound so sure."
At first, he and Ron had been apprehensive, both of them fearing the additional workload and extended hours. However, Kingsley pointed out that his intetion was that they could now delegate more tasks to their new subordinates, as well as spread out and rotate the Aurors around the clock. This ultimately meant that Harry and Ron, as Head and Deputy Head respectively, now had much more time on their hands, and much less stress to deal with, and Merlin knew that they both needed the break.
Ginny's eyes filled with tears, but Harry knew they were for joy. Ginny never cried when she was sad, but oddly enough, she did when she was extremely happy and couldn't believe her own luck. His sudden proposition warranted such tears, and Harry brushed his lips on her forehead.
: Is it true that the Minister created a separate department for you?
: Yes, the Office of Malicious Magical Intent.
Harry could swear that there was something tangible in the air between him and Malfoy, and he knew that he could trust the man. That every private thing they had exchanged over the last twelve hours would be kept in the strictest confidence.
When she had gone, the tension in the room became even more palpable, and Harry felt trapped. He knew Malfoy couldn't sense James, but he had no idea to explain Andromeda's emergency visit, or why he had to ask him to leave now so he could tend to his son in private.
Ron shrugged. "My sister only just sent us an owl yesterday and told us she's been away for a week already. We figured it had something to do with that..."
"She's spent her life wanting to be able to take care of herself," Harry said. "I was fine with that. I needed to do that for myself, too. But yeah, I guess she was working hard to not be the next Molly Weasley."
Draco smirked. "Which means I don't have much of a choice," he repeated.
"Yes!" the boy exclaimed, pumping his fist up in victory before grabbing his dumbfounded cousin and leading him on.
Harry laughed at his own thoughts. He had spent most of his teenage years believing he would die -- and he did! -- and the things that normal people planned for, like graduating and getting a job, were just an abstract concept of "the future" that he had in his head. Now that he was actually halfway to getting a career, it seemed even more surreal than the idea of hunting Horcruxes all around Britain.
"Er, alright. I'll be back with the others. Set up the conference room."
Draco thought back to Pansy's childbirth. He had been waiting outside then, but he had assumed that Oliver Wood had been in with her. Now that he thought about it, however, he remembered seeing him pacing to and fro in the same hallway but further from him. He also recalled Potter and Weasley's "horrible waiting" experiences, and a small knot of worry in his stomach eased a little.
Draco was taken aback. "What do you mean, this early?" he asked. Twenty-six for wizards was a typical age to have two or even three children.
: (chuckles again) Well, obviously it's a bit hard, but we get by.
Draco was getting more incensed. "What potion might that be?"
"It is a big deal," Draco insisted, though weakly, given that he had no real argument other than his insecurities. "I am very well versed in the concept of
"Only symbolically," Draco said exasperatedly. "The ritual called for blood, so Mother used hers. We followed the steps but the magic didn't attach to Scorpius. We tried again, this time with my blood, butâ€¦ it still failed."
Hermione raised an eyebrow. "You're still a patriarchal arse, Ronald," she said teasingly. "I agree with Harry, having elves care for your children are a bit too much."
She smiled seductively and pulled him to his feet along with her. They made sure to levitate James behind them as they moved to the bedroom, sharing more kisses on the way. When the bassinet was finally secured, the two of them fell hard onto the bed, where they proceeded to shed each other's remaining clothing.
The elf had said the call was business related, so he adopted a casual yet polite manner once he settled in front of the flames.
"I don't think I've really thought much about... that night..." Malfoy stammered uncharacteristically. Then he seemed to collect himself. "You're right, I can see you and me having a good laugh at my father after he murders us both in the name of family honor. It'll be like Hogwarts Express all over, except we'd be friends. How promising!"
"You aren't alone," Draco had reminded him, perhaps with a little more force than he had intended, but he needed to put the point across. He himself was feeling the familiar buzz after too much drink, and his guest had looked just about to collapse in front of him. "Let it all out tonight, Potter, and you'll be better tomorrow," Draco had said. "You won't be alone."
' was bound to happen sooner or later.
"It would!" she exclaimed, her expression brightening. "Why have I not thought of that?"
Draco let out the breath that he had been withholding. "I thought... never mind."
"Maybe we should stay by the fire," he suggested, hauling his own arse up and leading the way. His two friends eyed him with concern, but followed nonetheless. They'd always had their productive talks by the Gryffindor common room fire, so this was like going back to a time when they huddled by the hearth to concoct their secret plans.
Harry guffawed and shook his head, before spinning out and landing in his own hearth, feeling much better than he had in a long time.
Malfoy had related his personal journey from his probation all the way through to his Mastery exams in France, which left Harry awed at the blonde. He had accomplished so much in the face of prejudice, and he was now a celebrity in his own right. Harry, on the other hand, told him about his special acceptance into the Corps, and his demands for
"Using familial blood to call on a ward invokes very powerful magic. If it could protect Harry Potter from the Dark Lord, then it could very well be our only means to keep Scorpius safe no matter what happens."
It also provided a good filler for when they didn't have much to say.
Malfoy, ever the gracious socialite, gave her a brilliant smile in return. "Hello, Ginevra. It's good to see you again."
Astoria, who was already somewhat pale in complexion, was as white as a ghost. Draco even had the theory that she refused to hold Scorpius often so as not giveaway how badly she was shaking nowadays. He had never seen her lose composure before, and it worried him that this entire situation was affecting her in such a way.
"I understand, Andy, don't worry," Harry said. "I'll take care of Teddy, too." He was still glancing furtively at Malfoy. He took his son from her arms and secured him against his hip as unobtrusively as possible. Andromeda was obviously perceptive.
Sending the day away from home also gave Harry the chance to actually catch up more with his mates during his lunch hour. He hadn't realized how much he had missed spending time with Ron, Ernie, and all the other Aurors in the MMI department. In between work-related lunches and pub crawls, Harry found time to meet up with Malfoy as well.
From the kitchen, he could hear the sound of clinking, so he reckoned either Ron or Hermione had begun cleaning up. Making a mental note to thank them for helping out, Harry cradled his son carefully, moving around the sitting room and hovering over Teddy's new sculpture. He could feel James settling down and falling back into a blissful sleep, but he waited a few more minutes before he gently lowered the baby back into the bassinet.
"It's only for Jamie, and only because you were away so often in his first year. Of course he'll be more familiar with me."
"With your binding, no one would notice."
Draco's brow furrowed at her concern. "Our means of raising the next Malfoy heir is hardly the business of anyone without that name," he pointed out. "Yes, I do understand that Astoria and I must always be sensitive to the image that we project, and impressions mean a lot in our circles. However, she and I have already discussed this before, and while I understand that her responsibilities might take her far and away, mine happen to leave me with much freedom to spend my hours however I desire. And I do prefer to spend them with Scorpius. None of this is dictated explicitly in our contract anyway."
Harry felt his panic escalate. Had something happened on their way home? Were they attacked?
Draco laughed in disgust at himself. He had admittedly done all that extra research just because he couldn't stand Potter knowing something he didn't. Now he knew unnecessary trivia about the invocation. Like the old legends about
Harry easily took care of the pancakes and bacon, while Malfoy chatted with an overexcited Teddy. James had yet to wake, but Harry didn't mind being able to entertain Malfoy and Teddy just a little longer without all the baby drama. Merlin knows last night had been enough.
Malfoy's sharp tone took back Harry's attention a few seconds too late. He realized what he'd unthinkingly blurted out, and he mentally punched himself. He looked at Malfoy, gave a little half-shrug (he was doing a lot of shrugging today) as if he could discard the unwanted topic like an old jumper, and busied himself with cleaning up, sending pots and pans to the sink with his wand.
It was then that Draco had an idea, and a spark of hope. "Mother," he said slowly, "if you are amenable, I do know someone who can help us with this."
"And you wanted to do all of that?" Draco guessed. She nodded. "So... what happened?"
"Sorry, it's just... you came at the precise moment that I pretty much fell apart," Harry apologized, slumping back into his seat with a bit of embarrassment. He didn't want Malfoy to think he couldn't handle things. When he looked back at him though, there was nothing but a thoughtful expression on the man's face.
His heart felt like it would burst at any moment, it was filled with such a lightness that he had never known before. He had held other children before, of course. But knowing that Potter had allowed him this peek into his private life, this great responsibility of keeping such a huge secret - it filled him with wonder.
o be a hundred percent fool proof."
And that was pretty much what a typical Sunday was now, for Draco and company.
"Let's not forget the other angles here," Ron said in a placating tone that helped little to assuage Harry's darkening mood. "Could be that someone wanted Draco for themselves, which would mean Astoria was the victim-to-get-rid-of and must have been dosed as well. Or it's also possible that someone wanted
"Of what?"
"Because it wasn't important."
She didn't.
She merely laughed lightly. "It's true, my love, people could never shut me up whenever I started to talk about you," she said. "Now, where would you like me to begin?"
Seeing that same image right at this very moment was enough to shake his very foundations. Potter was out to catch his prey, and it was for Draco. It was all for Draco.
The fond tone in Harry's voice made Ginny smile even more. She kissed his cheek and pulled him into a tight hug. "I want to be with you Harry. But the thing is, will you be able to stand having Ron as your brother?"
, so you better wise up and let me go, or else."
"Nothing's wrong with following your heart, Mione," he said much softer when she still hadn't responded. "Nothing is wrong with prioritizing your work. But your career is eating you up, and there's hardly anything left of you. And if this keeps up..." he looked towards her still-flat stomach, and she felt even more vulnerable under his gaze. "You stand to lose a lot."
"So how goes your new and improved department, Potter?" he asked. "I admit, I was mildly surprised when the Prophet reported those statistics."
"Are you serious?!" Hermione exclaimed, laughing at the expense of her husband. She, Ron and Malfoy had decided to have breakfast together, during which Malfoy and Harry had silently agreed to act as if that morning's conversation had never occurred. Harry could hand it to the blonde, though - he could be counted on to play his part rather well. Maybe all Slytherins were raised to have so many masks ready to be put into place as needed. Malfoy was certainly being the epitome of the ideal houseguest, and was warming up to Ron and even Hermione. Neither Harry nor Malfoy mentioned anything from the previous night, even though they hadn't discussed that prior. Anyway, it didn't seem an issue to either Ron or Hermione that Harry had been holding James in his arms right in front of Malfoy while welcoming Hermione through the Floo.
isn't just warding... it's a magical binding ritual."
The blond shrugged. "I'm milking it."
"I respect your privacy, Potter," Malfoy went on, "I just have to admit that I don't particularly appreciate being kept in the dark. It's just who I am. So I'd like you to know that yes, I've had an idea that you've kept your godson a big secret from the rest of the wizarding world. Despite your wards, I was able to figure that out on my own."
's should be fine."
He had done his counting the morning Ginny had gone, and it worked for just a bit, until he went down to the kitchen in a daze. She had left him a hasty note, saying that the team were going to China the next day, and that she would do her best to reach them. For the first few days, it had been quite odd, with her long-distance Floo-calling, asking about Harry's day and how James was doing, and sharing her experience so far in such a foreign country. Their conversations were a little stilted and too civil, but that was only to be expected after such an awkward parting. Nevertheless, it was obvious that they had both wanted to clear the air, but neither had the desire to bring it up and ruin their tentative ceasefire. Anyway, James was just as happy babbling senselessly to his mother through the fire as in person, and Harry was glad that his son at least seemed to be alright with the current arrangement. Ginny's face had fallen slightly when he mentioned that they were staying for a while at Grimmauld. She seemed toÂ wonder whyÂ their flat wasn't a very good place for Harry to be at the moment, but she told him she understood and left it at that.
"Thank you, darling," Draco said with pride before turning back to the fire. "Now, Mother, waste no time in raising any wards you may already have lying in wait. You are also in danger so long as this threat... just please, be safe," he added in a small voice, hating that he sounded like a scared little boy.
"I don't mean just the physical, Harry. Try to explain to me why my daughter had a much easier time giving birth despite being away and highly active" (she growled this out) "during hewr rigorous training?"
"So I guess they weren't all over exaggerating, pulling me from my work and trapping me here," she said with a slight grimace. "There was a time when I began to resent it, because staying here made me feel weak, useless, and powerless. It took me a quite a lot of pondering, but I finally did realize that I do like being a mother as much as I love my career. I'm good at my job, you see, but I know now that I was going about it the wrong way. Ron and I have talked at length about it, and I think I'm willing to make adjustments so I don't end up creating my own demons again."
"To use it against me?" Harry asked, slightly defensive. James was beginning to stir in his arms, probably bothered by all the noise their voices were making.
"Yeah," Harry assured him. "I've just got a lot of things running through my mind at the moment, you know? But I'm better now, thanks."
Draco snickered as he stretched out his back and stood up. "I should go."
So, this is the last chapter of the "Flashbacks". I hope you've liked it so far. The story from here on in (2005+) will start to focus on the dynamic and relationship between Draco and Harry. Again, I indicated in the warnings above that this is a Really Really Really Slow Build Fic :)
Hermione let out a very long sigh. "Harry... after everything you've told us in the last few months... well, it's a bit hard to ignore all the issues that have apparently crept up on you and piled up over the years. It just seems... I don't know, such a waste," she hazarded, but Harry seemed to be open enough to at least her own opinions on the matter. How very mature they had all become. "But if you think it's better this way, well, only you and she can be a judge of that."
"Sir," he tried. "I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but... why? I don't understand why the Ministry has been so... involved and... lenient, with my Mother and I. Why is that, sir?"
Anyway, he already felt enamoured of Astoria's soft beauty and sharp intellect. He found in her a sparring mate and an ally, and knew that she could take as much as he could give, and give as good as she got. She had a fire in her that burned Draco to his soul.. and had just enough grace to make him feel that he had a soul at all. She would definitely make a great mother, and Draco felt the anticipation of having an heir of his own. She was definitely the one for him, and he made sure the public knew it.
"I'll just go and check in with Molly," his pseudo-dad said, clapping Harry on the back again. "You two go ahead and take a break. Go for a walk. Have some coffee. It'll help," he added to Harry insistently when he was about to protest.
"Ha! You plan everything out!" Pansy cut off his defense. "I know you too well, Draco, you've probably got this scene in your head playing out what you think should have happened and what should happen. Well, guess what," she looked at her perfectly manicured hands, "pregnancy is a bitch, and it's your first real look into married life. You'll love it, but you'll hate it. Stop focusing too much on your wife's faults and focus on making it easier for the both of you."
"Well, make sure to feed me, too, I'm starving!" she said, pulling him back towards the door. "I came to you the instant I read your letter, and I haven't had my lunch yet!"
"I was just... lots of thinking going on under this rat's nest." Harry indicated his own head with a wry smile that was immediately returned by Malfoy.
The plan seemed to satisfy Hermione, except for one thing. "How are you going to keep this up though? You can't be seen getting too chummy with Malfoy since you aren't that close as friends. People who know you," and she looked pointedly at Harry, reminding him that they had friends who were within the wards, "those whom you allow to see you won't react well after seeing you together so often. It would be too weird, maybe even cause suspicion among those who know you."
is what you get for fraternizing with a Malfoy and ending up in his house pissed beyond measure in your moment of weakness."
He'd been played a fool.
It was true. Until now, no one was really aware of how close Harry and Draco had actually become. In the few short years since they had reconciled, not even Ron nor Hermione understood the extent of their interaction apart from the occasional call or pub crawl. In light of Draco's recent security measures, everyone expected them to stay more in touch via Floo, but it was still somewhat of a secret that they tended to cross over into each other's sitting rooms at odd hours, just to talk.
, of all people. For Merlin's sake, just the mere act of having tea and biscuits with a Muggleborn, how preposterous!" He scrunched his nose uncharacteristically in pretend disgust. At this point in their friendship, he and Hermione had grown some sort of understanding - part of it was how Draco tempered his sarcasm, and Hermione had been witty enough to roll with his dark humor sometimes.
Ginny nodded. "You're too good to be true, Harry Potter," she said, wrinkling her nose. "I beg to differ. I think we both somehow contributed, but I agree, any kind of blaming will only make things worse. I myself admit that I've a lot to make up for, but I'm willing to see how we can make this work, together, since I think we are agreeing that we might be better... not together."
At his expression, Potter chuckled good naturedly. "Apart from Ginny, Ron and Hermione, I've also included Neville, Luna and the Weasleys."
"Good day, Helen," Harry greeted, while Ginny smiled meekly. "Er, thanks for seeing us on short notice. It's a bit of an emergency."
"Oh shut up. You know what I meant. Anyway, it feels kindaâ€¦
Potter made a sound halfway between a laugh and a scoff. "Would you have wanted to be rescued by the Chosen One?" Draco's silent glare made Potter laugh for real. "Didn't think so."
After several moments of silence (and much refilling of whiskey), Draco finally decided to take matters into his own hands.
"We could, then she'd hunt us down. Probably kill you."
"It seems, er, a lot less scary in here," Draco managed to say out loud before he could stop himself. The alcohol had really gotten to his head, he thought.
Hi guys! I'd like to apologize for making you all wait so long for an update! It was pretty hard writing out the last two and a half chapters that I had to break them up into smaller batches for a better story flow. After that, My schedule became a bit too busy so it completely slipped my mind. Then after that, my detachable (slightly expensive) keyboard decided to slowly kill itself. But anyway, I hope I haven't lost too many readers out there. Much love, X
"Don't lie about having any sympathy, Potter," Draco said somewhat impatiently.
"No, mother," he said immediately. "I had worried when she began speaking nonsense, but as you have said, it's no problem at all. Though the next three or four weeks..."
The words washed over him, stilling the last remnants of insecurity that dwelt in his heart. As he sat there with Hermione, sipping their tea in companionable silence, he felt himself relax for the first time in months.
Harry laughed. Trust Ron's nose to zone in on the smell of
: -in a year or two, maybe. Then we'll probably adjust. That's all.
"-probably going to end up killing us-"
"Fine," Hermione said firmly, which made Draco release the breath he was holding. "I can come through. But let me call Harry and Ron first-they'll want to know where I'm going to be today, you seeâ€¦"
"Don't, Hermione," he pleaded. "Please, I want both of you to just... leave this to me and Ginny for now, and to understand that the two of us do agree that while we do love each other deeply, it is not the same kind of relationship we once dreamed of together."
Teddy beamed. "Of course I did, I'm responsible!"
Harry's eyes twinkled. "I know," he parroted with a grin.
Upon his arrival, he coincidentally witnessed a disheveled Potter racing after Weasley and Flooing out in a hurry. He watched with amusement until they vanished, then proceeded on his way to the Minister's office.
"It's not that bad. Kingsley was pretty lenient, I mean, not everyone gets to work from home. I get to spend all day with James, so it's not like I'm wasting away my time at work."
he lamented to himself.
"Alright," Draco said, already looking forward to cracking the stupid case and waving his success in Potter's face.
Harry smirked. "So confident, Gin. You're on."
Ginny laughed brightly, and threw her arms around Harry. In a move that was so cheesy yet also superbly satisfying, Harry put his arms around her waist and twirled her in a circle, both of them giggling at the silliness of the gesture.
"I saw the paper this morning," was all he said.
"What are you on about, Malfoy?" Potter finally asked, perhaps a bit scathingly. Draco could give him that - after all, the man was having a pretty shitty day.
Which happened just a few weeks after, in the midst of a particularly chilly March.
Potter seemed to follow his train of thought. "Narcissa and Astoria can be safely hidden within the Manor, especially since you said that they don't mind having to stay within the Manor's wards and under the Fidelius. Neither of them are expected to appear around in the British public, so their extended absence will likely be overlooked. Astoria can say that she has decided to take the time to care for Scorpius, in case anyone who matters asks. But you, you have to be able to leave the Manor's protection to work, and my
"This is highly irregular, you should know," Helen Rosewood was saying gently. "Usually we have to keep the father outside but this kind of decision must be made by both parents. It's not something to just take for granted."
to me!" he said furiously.
"You have perfectly fine assets, Harry," Ginny replied, winking at him. "With or without them, you're already family anyway, we're just doing this to give Mum her chance to cry at my wedding."
He turned to Hermione automatically. It had long since been an involuntary tic for both Ron and Harry to expect the right answers from her. She sighed.
"I can't see myself with anyone else just yet," Harry admitted with a grimace. Ginny just shook her head and smiled. "I mean, you're right. What we haveâ€¦ is real and strong, but it isn'tâ€¦ well, I don't know. I don't exactly have a good track record for dating. It's always just been you, that I haven't even thought about finding someone else I might actually be in love with after all of this."
That, he thought, was most likely the crux of their problem. He leaned back into the couch, little James cooing in his lap, and waited for Ginny's scheduled Floo-call.
"He's pretty worried, it's reminding him too much of last year."
"That sounds like a plan," Harry agreed, grinning. "I'm really proud of your commitment to Quidditch!"
Draco sat back in shock. Having nightmares of echoes was one thing. But having a nightmare and then finding out it was all real... he didn't think he could handle that. When Potter sent a full glass towards him, he gladly took it and had a generous gulp before staring at the Auror once again.
"One time, our head elf popped in front of me in a panic because they couldn't settle Scorpius down to sleep. It turns out one of them had completely forgotten to give him a pre-prepared bottle that he'd gotten used to sleeping with. Started bawling when he couldn't find it and the elves had no idea at all until I retrieved it myself."
"You know," he said, his tone more playful now. "I think I'll stay. It seems we've got a lot to talk about."
Draco felt sheepish, but said it anyway. "Since we didn't finish last nightâ€¦ can we continue with the rest of those films?"
"Dating a high profile celebrity is such a chore sometimes," she lamented dramatically. "All that practice answering the age old question of 'what's it like being a nobody dating somebody famous?'"
The ritual itself was quite simple enough to plan for, and the delay was more a matter of conflicting schedules than actual need for preparation. For Draco, those few days before the act had burned him inside with a sort of mixture between shame, guilt, and elation. It was pretty straightforward, at least for such an ancient and theoretically complicated bit of magic.
"Would you mind asking him if he could come speak to me now? Ron and I have some things we wanted to ask. They're prettyâ€¦er, he just needs to hear it from me," he amended.
"Well then, I do believe that if you sign here, and here, and tap your wand on this seal...."
The little blond child's laughter and nonsense gibberish echoed around the room with renewed vigor as Draco bounced him playfully in his arms.
The man before him sneered, looking quite satisfied with himself. "Been wanting to say that to your face meself. How's it feel to know that you've been keeping a brat who isn't even yours?"
"Perhaps there is an essential step that we have missed?" Astoria suggested. "A missing incantation, or ingredient? This ritual is centuries old, we can't even make sure if the sources we've used have recorded it properly. Maybe something significant was omitted somehowâ€¦"
"What is it, Mother?" he asked.
"It feels brilliant! Absolutely brilliant! I can't wait till I can actually try walking down Diagon Alley and not have any nosy reporters trying to catch me off guard. I mean, I'm eighteen and all but this'll be the first time I'll get to feel like I'm normal, y'know?"
"Right now?" Astoria took the sleeping Scorpius from her husband, intending to take him to bed. Near the door, she turned back to him. "Making an emergency call to your mother is one thing. But isn't it too early for a business call?"
"And the actual threat-?"
There was undertone to Potter's joke, and Draco picked up on it:
Hermione's exuberant cry for attention from across the room immediately took away Draco's presence, which left Harry a few moments to himself.
"No, actually." Hermione checked on Hugo and found that he was already fast asleep. She didn't let him go, though. "We both worked reasonable hours. I never left too early nor came home too late. But..."
"May I know where she is, Tibby?" Draco asked.
Not a sound was heard the whole time Potter had the floor.
"Well, you should," Harry said, silently agreeing with Molly for once. "I mean, it's a pretty hazardous job you've got, and they won't let you fly anyway after next month." Their Healer (under the strictest limitations of the Solum Sanctuarii, of course) had told them that the rest of the pregnancy after the first trimester called for less physically demanding activities, and there went Quidditch, out the window.
"The fact that both she and I are perfectly fine. It's kind of a red flag, you know, when you realize you're just fine and dandy whether your fiancÃ©e is with you or not. I barely even notice when she's away - it doesn't make much of a difference. And I'm pretty sure it's the same with James. He hardly misses his own mum, because he hasn't an idea what he's even supposed to miss."
Narcissa seemed to appreciate his fears though. "Of course, dear," she said gently. "Worry not for me. I am safe at the Manor. Get here as soon as you can." With that, the call ended and Draco allowed himself to melt into the seat's backrest.
"I will discuss this with Astoria," he promised his mother. "It is something that we can easily deal with. She is intelligent and understands much more than she lets on, including her wisdom when it comes to our marriage and how we play it out. After all, it was one of the reasons I wanted to marry her in the first place."
Draco had learned from his mother about his father's short temper when it came to spending time with Draco. Narcissa lamented that Lucius was completely against coddling their son, though she had always longed to have him in her arms (and got away with a bit of hugging behind his father's back).
"Amazing how much things have changed in such a short time," he mused, taking a sip of his tea. "Here I am, defending Potter and Weasley's honor from
"You cook?" Draco cocked up an eyebrow. "Don't you have elves to do that? I remember my Great Aunt had several here."
He walked slowly, as quietly as he could, ignoring the other Healers and Mediwitches who were moving around him. His breath hitched as the Healer pulled him closer to the bed where Ginny lay, holding a bundle of cloth in her arms with a weak smile on her pale face.
Draco scowled. "
But the humor was lost on Harry, because all he could think about was Draco's fear stricken face in his Floo.
"You fucking bastard!" he cried out, wrestling with the magical bonds on his arms and legs but failing. "If I've proven you've dosed me with that fucking potion, I will wring your neck myself!"
The question was so unexpected that Harry didn't exactly know what to say. "Malfoy," he said slowly, making sure that their gaze remained unbroken, "Hermione, Ron and I wanted to visit and congratulate you and Astoria."
And she had hugged her daughter and Harry very tightly, spilling over her happy tears onto their shoulders. They didn't mind in the slightest.
"In that case, how about a stronger drink then?" Draco suggested. "The boys are all asleep, it's not even midnight yet and neither of us have anywhere to be, soâ€¦ What say you?"
Once he started speaking into the podium charmed with Sonorus, Harry automatically launched into his Boy-Who-Lived motivational speech. He had cringed when Kingsley gave him the list of inspirational sayings that the Ministry expected him to adhere to. The entire DA obliged, of course, because there hadn't really been other choices. After a full hall's worth of applause, one of the wizards seated near them made to start a Sonorus announcement, clearly believing the boy to be done. To everyone's surprise, however, Harry stopped him with a wave of his hand. Here we go, he thought to himself, taking a deep breath.
Silence.
"You test our patience," Astoria said easily, with a hint of a threat. "Who are they?"
"What do you - of course it's you!" Draco accused angrily. "The Aurors have their eyes on you, you bastard! They've been watching your every move since we found out who you were!"
"Draco, Darling!" he heard an exasperated cry from inside the room, and before he knew it, he was engulfed in an uncharacteristic embrace from Narcissa.
Draco shook his head. "She's attending a ministry function in France this week, and my mother has taken Scorpius for the day."
Finally, after a good few minutes, Hermione tentatively broke the quiet. "So... that's it?" she asked apprehensively. "The two of you just... agreed to break the engagement. Just like that."
"Oh, sorry, I'll handle it," he said, excusing himself and tending to his son. James wasn't a fussy baby, but he had probably been woken by the loud conversations they were having. It wasn't often that Grimmauld Place had guests, of course. It was usually only father and son.
"Dracoooooooooo!"
"Fuck you, Ferret," he exclaimed, but without the expected vitriol. "Hah. Nothing like a good insult from you to start the day right, eh?"
"I did," Ginny answered. "I had a bit of trouble trying to feed him when he woke, but I managed."
"Was I?" Harry asked innocently, pouting his lips in a ridiculous fashion.
"Albus..." he said, staring in wonder. He looked Ginny again, as if making sure that it was all real. Ginny nodded and Harry saw tears of joy in her eyes. She never cried when she was sad. Just always, always when she was happy.
The sound of the door made him turn abruptly, pulling him from his thoughts.
It took a while for the man to settle down from his bout of mocking laughter, but eventually he stopped, a great grin back on his face as he leered at Draco
That particular day, they had gone to have a Saturday brunch at one of their favorite restaurants. They were quite familiar with the owners, who had been given the privilege of being invited into the Solum Sanctuarii ward when Harry deemed that they could be trusted. Of course, Mr. Prishna and his wife Anazka couldn't have shared the information anyway, but they stayed true to their word, honoring the trust and keeping mum despite knowing of Harry and Ginny's private life. Today was bound to be different, however.
"That'sâ€¦ preposterousâ€¦" Draco whispered, deep in thought. "Why would anyone take such extreme measures to intimidate me? I can't think of anyone who has a deep enough grudge against me."
Harry snorted in amusement. "Yeah. Sneaking out and breaking into the broom shed just to learn Quidditch on her own. Even when she was going out with her old boyfriends at Hogwarts, she was always the opposite of the girly girl, and I don't think they could handle that," he laughed when he remembered her fiery attitude when it came to dating at such an early age.
"I don't come here as often as I'd like, though I really should. It's one of mine, you see."
"Yeah, yeah, I made you guys some. I have a lot of free time at home, anyway," he said, shrugging his shoulders. "How're you feeling lately, Hermione?"
"I was very doubtful of you and your mother, you see," Kingsley began matter-of-factly. "You of all the Death Eaters were the most in contact with Voldemort. You provided your home as his headquarters. You evaded the opportunities of freedom presented to you. You refused to side with the Light during the War."
? Is that what Muggles do to young children? Treat them like house elves?"
"Draco!" his mother shouted this time, which made caught his attention. She never raised her voice that way, especially not to him. "Draco! Come out, please! It's Astoria!"
He and Astoria, had once again become the beacon of the modernized Purebloods, seeking to compromise and revolutionize what it meant to follow old traditions as well as accept new ones. Though admittedly, his wife was much more of a believer in the truly traditional customs while he found himself defending his more... liberal... tendencies when it came to the child-rearing. So far though, the couple had had no real problems when it came to Scorpius.
"DNA, unlike magical signatures or auras, cannot be easily tampered with. Scorpius' DNA is a mix of Draco's and Astoria's. Draco's is a mix of yours, Narcissa, and Lucius'. There is a certain analogy in familial relationships which is why I also want to examine Teddy Lupin's DNA, which is related to Andromeda's in much the same degree as Scorpius is to you."
Rogers shook his head. "I've done some research on old pureblood wards. Malfoy Manor has had its magic woven in since the early 1000's and that's a pretty substantial time period for the protective wards to build up over itself. I doubt any other wards could afford more security than that."
"Auror, remember?" Potter said, pointing at himself with a smug smile that went up to his sparkling eyes. "It's how you always had your tea at Hogwarts, so I threw caution to the winds and just tried to replicate it."
: Yes, alright, that might need discussing with our editor, but I'll run it by her. Anyway, Mr. Weasley, another question. How are the rest of your family? We notice that this home, this burrow-
"Not when she's at another country, like this," Harry said. "When she was in China, all we had were Floo calls and packages. The worst thing about it is that Jamie didn't even realize that his mum was away," he added bitterly. "Didn't even cry when she left. It as kind of sad, actually."
Harry's voice brought him back to the present, though he still had the ghost of a smirk on his lips.
When he stumbled back into his own fire, he couldn't help but wince at the odd ending to such a pleasant night. And Draco knew there wasn't any reason, but he felt as if he and Potter had been caught doing something illegal. Which they weren't. So his feeling of guilt was unfounded, and it confused him until he finally fell asleep.
Potter laughed, surprising Draco. He seemed to struggle a bit with his arms, though it might have been because they must be tired from being held up for so long without support.
It was a blessing that Potter didn't seem to mind. Perhaps he really was a good friend to have in one's circle.
"The papers," Weasley coughed quietly, holding out his hand for them. Draco silently complied, still looking at the brunet through the fire.
Their grandiose wedding was attended by almost everyone important and well-to-do in Wizarding Britain, as well as several international delegates from the Continent. Several guests of high profile were also invited, including, to the shock of many, the group once touted as "Dumbledore's Army", and even Auror Harry Potter himself. Minister Kingsley Shacklebolt and his wife were present as guests of honor, seated with the lovely Lady Narcissa Black.
In the end, he chose six of those books and stood in line to pay for them. As he struggled to balance the books in one arm to reach into his pocket for his money bag, a careless elbow nudged into him, causing the top two of his books to fall in a heap in the floor.
"There is much left for me to do in order to rehabilitate our family from the mess that Father has carelessly dug us in. But I will not fail. As for the name, I fully intend to keep it and continue the lineage. No offense, Mother, but 'Black' would be such a bland name for me, don't you agree? And anyway, what would this world be without the one and only Draco Malfoy?"
"Hey," Harry said, dropping the forms he had been working on and putting his hands on Ginny's. He enjoyed these small moments between them. They had never been the kind of couple to be rabidly passionate or romantic. They were always much more comfortable with the steady stability of a sincere companionship, without the bells, whistles and drama that most other couples seemed to have. Their relationship, long and solid as it was, felt very much like a favorite jumper - warm and familiar, and highly dependable despite the inevitable unravelling over the years. He and Ginny had overcome quite a lot of issues, and he was glad that they had come through all those times still together.
"I bet Salazar Slytherin and Godric Gryffindor are positively rolling in their graves."
Narcissa beamed at her only son, tears in her eyes. "Oh, my dragon, after everything you have been through... I want you to be able to go where you want, and do what you choose. Without the taint of the Malfoy name, I will regain honor and respect as a Black once more, and you..." She looked him in the eye before asking him, "what do you want?"
"The memo," Weasley replied, snatching a couple of the new bottles and handing one over to Draco.
Ginny bore the brunt of her mother's force with ease, since she had grown up learning how to counter Molly's scolding. Harry, however, had taken to avoiding his future mother-in-law, and keeping their conversations short and straight to the point before finding a reason to excuse himself. After two months, Molly had finally relented, but nevertheless snuck in her advice whenever she got Ginny alone. Like at tonight's New Year's party.
After he had filed for his formal request (which was the first of its kind in over two hundred years), he'd been asked to present his case to the assembled officials. Having just finished, Harry now nervously waited for his words to sink in, realizing he had no idea what kind of reactions to expect. Finally, when it seemed that every person had forgotten how to breathe, Kingsley Shacklebolt stood up and approached the brunet.
Narcissa made a face. "You did. And yes, I saw that you were happy. And still are. But I see now that it is a different kind of happiness. For it is when you are with Scorpius, or with your new friends, that I see such a fierce joy and contentment reflected in your eyes that it overshadows what happiness you might share with Astoria."
: I see. And what exactly does your department specialize in?
"You were the one who thought to Fire-call me close to eleven. I'm just trying to be a good host." Potter was levitating a tray of tea and biscuits behind him before laying it down onto the table between him and Draco.
Malfoy stared him down (or so it seemed to Harry), but then seemed to make a silent decision. In less than a minute, his haughty proud face melted into an expression of sadness and worry. "I needed-" he took a deep breath -"I thought I could use a - I thought I'd talk with you - for a bit -"
Astoria looked him straight in the eye. "It will not come to that."
"You seem to be more observant," Potter continued. "Or at least you've been sharper than most. You notice things that even I take for granted. You should look into a career in interrogation. You've only been over one night, and already you've gotten me to open up to you embarrassingly about things I don't even tell my best mates."
Potter snorted. "You can't possibly pretend to be a Hufflepuff, it just goes against the very fibre of your being," he said, his voice somewhat more playful now. "And you're right, I shouldn't mope around like that. I don't even know what I'm doing here."
No matter how much Harry wanted to deny it, he really did miss Ginny. Despite the fact that she had only spent nights at their flat for the last few years, they really had built a steady and dependable routine that they both worked well with. Of course, the one thing that had changed their lives was James, since before his birth they had been quite comfortable to give each other the space they needed. It had been the same way since the war, Harry thought, looking back at how they had developed as a couple.
Draco smiled, shaking his head. Of course his mother would be aware of everything going on in the Manor. "He's already gone, has to look after his... responsibilities," he said, the
"What do you think?" Potter asked suddenly, settling in one of the armchairs. Draco took the one opposite him.
"Europe!" Draco exclaimed, a smile on his face. "Why, darling, you seem to have absorbed my penchant for high standards."
Draco ignored him. "Why, sir?"
"I gave birth to him, yes. I have done what a mother must do for a child, have I not? And you, of course, helped. There was definitely no room for a child in our original plan, but it still worked out somehow."
It was impossible for Draco to tell which part hurt to hear the most: the truth, or the matter-of-fact manner that Potter had said it. He ground his teeth in frustration. His first ten years were filled with toys and parties and the best of whatever it was he wanted on a whim. For Merlin's sake, he was a fully grown man and still couldn't find his way around the kitchen. And here he suddenly had an image of a little Potter, being treated like a servant by his own flesh and blood. Sure, he had learned over the years that Potter wasn't the spoiled brat that he had once made himself believe. But this was painful to hear, even for him. And he couldn't think of anyone who could have hated Potter more than he did.
"Well?"
Harry saw Hermione move towards Narcissa and lead her to the comfier chairs in the corner of the room. Surprisingly, the woman followed. The high traffic of Aurors and Unspeakables going in and out in the last hour was probably fraying the edges of her self-control.
, and he observed the wonder and surprise in Malfoy's eyes as the little baby suddenly materialized out of thin air.
She winked slyly at him. "I have no idea what you mean, Harry. I won it fair and square and you know it."
"I'm just worried, okay?" he admitted to the girl, hoping that she would not ridicule him. "I just thought she'd be more, well, cheerful, about it. You know, like you were when you and Wood found out!"
Malfoy laughed.
Apologies for the long delay with this chapter! I had already finished it weeks ago, but when I was about to upload it, I realized that 80 percent of it was gone and I had to start over again. I cannot tell you enough how difficult it is to write something out again when it was already done before. While I have an outline that I follow for plot, I write freely as I go. So it was very very difficult to get the same kind of writing through. So this chapter turned out slightly different from the "original" but nothing much has been affected plot-wise. Sorry again for the long wait, and I hope you all stick by this story anyway.
"There was never a chance, that's why." He paced up and down the study before planting his palms on the desk. "We tried, Mother. I tried. But we spent the entire time half picking on each other's faults and the other half in contemptuous silence. She's too...cold. I'm pretty sure I want a marriage that's at least as warm as yours and Father's had been."
"Er..." Okay, he honestly had no idea how to do this. "So, er, are you alright then?"
"You have a club?" Astoria asked with amusement. "Oh darling," she jokingly admonished Draco, "you should have told me you were expecting your friends to be here! They weren't even on our list!"
"I didn't know you two were so close," Ginny said.
He gave a start when his fireplace roared, changed color and indicated that he had a Floo call. Waving his hand to allow it, he clambered closer to the hearth, and seeing his best mate's distraught face.
"It's all about necessity. You support yourself and your friends by forming connections, perhaps even close relationships. But mostly, being Slytherin is all about the stakes, Potter. How to stack them, and how to use them wisely to your advantage." There was a sharp gleam in Malfoy's eye, which made Harry wonder exactly how different the Slytherin formative years were if they all needed to watch their own backs at every second in the Snake Pit.
"Just because you're physically apart doesn't mean you're emotionally distant," Hermione insisted.
Ginny was pale and clammy, having spent the entire morning in bursts of pain. She still looked beautiful though, in Harry's opinion. Her blue eyes sought his, and held his gaze with an intensity that he knew he could only find in her.
After checking in with Ron via Floo, Harry hastily scribbled out a reply and sent off the letter. Then he sent off his own owl with another letter for Andromeda, asking if she could take James for the night. He would have asked Molly, but he was sure that she already had her hands full with Hugo and a pregnant Hermione.
"Harry and Ron have changed much with their fledgling department."
All in all, Harry thought that the day had gone pretty well, considering that he and his friends had an abysmal history when it came to their plans actually coming to fruition. While Hermione and Ron had talked for almost an hour to Astoria about their anecdotes and warnings on child rearing, Harry found himself being pulled towards a corner by an irritable blond.
Ginny choked on her pumpkin juice. She blinked out tears of laughter while she thought it over in her head. "Harry Potter, BAMF. I like that."
Draco couldn't believe it, but he admitted to himself that Potter and Weasley were actually brilliant drinking companions. They had spent three hours exchanging stories, jokes and witticisms. Their topics cycled through whatever came up in their minds, which included politics, mysterious cases, girlfriend problems and Muggle inventions. Draco realized then that Potter had much to tell about the world he grew up in, seeing as both Malfoy and Weasley had had limited exposure. He had laughed when Potter mentioned Muggles going to the moon. What a laugh! Potter promised to show them footage (whatever that meant), but he and Weasley had shared a look that clearly meant they both doubted the non-magical means of achieving such a feat.
Ron took down Harry's orders, shaking his head. "Seriously, Harry," he said, shaking his head, "I can't wait to get these stupid arseholes. Especially since they sound all self-righteous and spoiled." Harry silently agreed. Too many innocents were already murdered, though thankfully the masterminds had not caused any disturbance in the last month.
Harry nodded distractedly. Of course Hermione would have a clearcut career plan. He noticed, however, that she never did say 'no'. He pointed it out to Ron.
Harry ran his hand through his hair, which was pretty much a rat's nest this early in the morning. "Any obscure relations who might have enough Malfoy blood to get through the wards?"
"I told you so," he said softly with a grin.
The brunet seemed to blush, but the green flames made it hard to be sure. "Er, you can say this is more of a personal call," he replied. "I just... thought..."
"Then of course, he insisted that he be given the chance to testify for both of you. He seemed to think that the witness list was going to be biased against you. More importantly," he looked Draco in the eye, "he seemed so sure that you and your mother would be too proud to plead for your freedom, that your pride would keep you from even saving yourselves with your own testimonies."
to take an interest in maintaining one's outward appearance, particularly if it is of utmost importance to one's reputation," he said, turning his nose up. "And I happen to have very high standards."
"Relax, darling," she said, "I know how you feel about these things. I just wanted to ensure that you would be fine without me."
"They care for you!" Harry said, his voice rising in volume to match hers. "We all do! I don't know about those barmy codgers you work with, but I'm sure as hell that Molly, Ginny, Ron and I are fucking worried about you, but we have no idea how to go about it because you always end up chewing someone's head off before we even get a word in!" He took a deep breath - he hadn't blow up this way in so long. "There's something wrong here, Hermione, and you need a reality check because whatever it, it's affecting everything and everyone around you. I came here to tell it to your face, because I'd rather be the difficult friend instead of the one that doesn't do anything to show he cares." He stopped speaking, having run out of breath. She of all people should know what he was trying to do for her - she had done it quite often during their schooldays. She was his voice of reason then, and now Harry could be hers, even if she didn't want to hear it.
Harry abruptly shut his mouth, effectively ending his rant before he could finish.
"A frame of reference?" Draco repeated, looking skeptical.
"Oh?" the man sneered in his face. "I'd probably be able to afford it, seeing as you've been paying
"Draco."
Even during their somewhat reluctant cooperation for the Eilert case, Potter had been careful to avoid any mention of his personal relationship except in strictly factual or objective comments. For this reason, Draco had begun to mentally ignore the presence (or existence) of the youngest Weasel, which, now that he thought about it, was odd, considering that she was the mother of the child whose father he spent much time with for several months.
"Okay, then," Potter stood up and brushed off his trousers. "Thanks for all the information." The tone was that of finality and for a second, Draco felt as if he were being abandoned somehow. However, he turned his gaze to Potter's emerald green eyes and
Harry snorted mid-sip, choking on his tea.
"You're asking me to stay here?' Draco repeated, looking surprised. Harry hoped he hadn't ruined anything by blurting out overnight invitations without thinking about them.
"None of us are you, Hermione."
"Thank you so much, dear," the woman said, looking like she was on the brink of tears. "Have you had news? About Hermione?" When Harry shook his head, she pursed her lips before speakng again. "You know I'd always reminded Hermione how terribly demanding and highly involved having a child can be.
Potter (
"Like I said," Potter continued through gritted teeth. "I wasn't thinking when I said it out loud."
me grow taller!"
"The fact that I couldn't care less about who you are has
"And now we're back to the light."
"Mother, why ever are you doing
Harry closed his eyes, mentally unravelling the knots he had built around his James. The magic around both of them was intricate, and answered only to his magical signature. Slowly, he tore apart the layers of the
Draco sought out his mother and found her once again watering her own plants. "Good morning," he greeted her.
"We've more in common than anyone thinks," Harry answered, thinking back to that one long night he'd had with the blonde git.
"Oh, it's been done over the years," the man gloated. "You were so caught up by the potion that you never even thought your wife as anything but an angel! Ah, the ironyâ€¦" He laughed heartily. "She'd got you wrapped around her pretty little finger that you didn't even realize what was going on around you. Didn't see all that money being pilfered from out of your vaults, eh? Never thought to check why your wife was always away? Such a pretty little social butterfly, you thought. It was all so perfect! We were draining your coffers and you didn't even mind at all. In fact, I daresay you would have done it all willingly anyway. Damn, I hope we didn't waste that potionâ€¦" he tutted amusedly.
"And that's a bad thing?" Draco demanded. Wasn't it only recently that his mother had been nagging him about Astoria? And now that he had realized his shortcomings, she was saying the opposite?
Narcissa was furious. She had immediately taken Draco's international Floo call from France despite the early hour, and was now trying to make sense of what she had just learned. "Who could have the gall to threaten such an old and esteemed family as ours?" she demanded, before turning to her son. "Have you really no idea?"
Draco hung his head in shame. He hadn't meant to grab her in such a childlike way, but his nerves had gotten the better of him. After all, it wasn't every day that he made this sort of decision. He steeled his resolve and stood his ground. "I was wondering..."
The headline, however, shocked the confusion out of him, replacing it with an empty hollow feeling the pit of his stomach.
The question had been pulled from nowhere, which surprised Draco. "Of course we are doing well, you would know that seeing as you live beneath the same roof as us."
Six weeks.
"I'll take care of it, sir," she assured Harry, "I've still got that friend in Legal, I'm sure she can expedite the process. It's an emergency, after all."
Kingsley gave a sigh. He waved his hand at the Auror by the door, who gave him an odd look, then stepped out and closed the door behind him.
"What about stronger wards?" Perkins asked.
Harry knew he meant it as a joke, but he had seriously associated the blonde's calls with a fierce wave of protectiveness.
"So are you planning on a large family, then?" he blurted out before being able to stop himself. The look was so tender on Malfoy's face that it was obvious to him.
There were 27 items listed, in no particular order. As Potter had said, there seemed to be no logic to the list except for the quantities indicated to the left. It was very detailed, considering that it had been taken from a memory. Draco thought it meant that Pince had seen it more than once to have it retained with this much information.
He didn't voice out to his mother his own insecure assumptions. He had always been proud of his having her as a wife, and always aimed to please her as much as he could, even when it sometimes meant he had to swallow his Malfoy pride. He wouldn't go as far as to say that they were very romantic - after all, such a relationship was not truly expected in pureblood alliances. But he had seen the way Lucius and Narcissa had looked at each other, and even without words Draco understood that there was something hiding in those furtive glances and secret smiles. He had wanted that. And he found it in Astoria.
"And me?" she raised her eyebrow in a joking manner.
"Reading time now?" Harry asked with a smile. The boy in front of him, now pretty much recovered from their tickle war, nodded eagerly.
Harry just sighed.
"You're nothing alike," Ginny complained.
"Perhaps what?" Harry asked, eyes closed.
: It's no problem at all.
"Bloody hell," he cursed under his breath. "Hey Teddy, would you mind staying with Jamie by his play area in the sitting room?" he asked as he and his godson jogged down the stairs. "I've got a call, and it may be important, so it's best if you take care of James for a bit. Think you're up to the challenge?"
A smile lit Harry's face against his will. "It's true," he said, turning more to face Draco. "When you have that capacity to love, and you use it to the fullest by carrying as many as possible, that's when you feel even stronger. And the fact that you're scared for your family doesn't discount that, but itâ€¦ it shows that you have that empathy. Merlin, I'm rambling now."
"I like cooking," he said defensively, pouting just a bit.
"Then you know how much goes into these bindings..."
"No, no, it's okay, Malfoy," Potter said quickly. "I just wasn't expecting- anyway, never mind, I-" he took a deep breath. "Is it about the investigation?"
"You can tell us, Lady Black," Ron encouraged.
"Is it doable, then?" Weasley asked, sounding desperate.
: (nods)
know it."
"Er, that probably wasn't a joke, Harry," Ron replied nonchalantly. "It's a bit crude to put it that way, but yeah, in essence, that's how traditional Purebloods marry."
As he forced himself to do the zombie walk towards the en suite bathroom, he sighed in resignation and did his best to groom himself for a meal with the vain, pretentious blonde prat who had so willingly welcomed him in his time of need.
Harry nodded. "I agree. But sending that short message seems like someone throwing a line, like bait."
For the first time since the tense arrival of Andromeda, Potter gave out a brilliant smile. "Great. I'd be glad to regale you with everything you should be scared of in the next eight months. But-"
"Our highly extended engagement, yes," Harry huffed.
Draco frowned. "She doesn't really have as much information as she wants. As a rule, I don't tell my friends too much, unless absolutely necessary."
Potter - Harry, that is - was now looking at him with an unreadable expression on his face. Draco felt as if he were under scrutiny, and he resisted the strong urge to preen himself. Instead, he went on to drink his tea, feeling slightly more relaxed as he felt the potion unravel the building pressure behind in his head. It took a couple more minutes, but when he felt the last vestiges of pain disappear, he gave out a sigh of relief and allowed his body to lean back into his armchair.
It was the tone that sowed doubt into his very being.
Ron laughed at the mental image of him and Harry turning over tables in the Ministry. "It was a long time in coming, if you ask me. Harry was the one who realized what was so lacking in the system, and it took a while to convince the Minister. But now everyone can see that the MMI is just what the Aurors needed all these years."
I know that the waiting game for a WIP is difficult, but I promise you that I will not let you down! It's just taking much longer to find time to consistently write.
Still, it had been tiresome, catering to the random whims of a woman running purely on hormones. He laughed to himself as he took the chocolates up to their bedroom. If Pansy had heard him say that, she would have hit him upside the head with her diaper bag. All in good fun, of course. He laughed when Astoria basically grabbed the box from his grasp the moment he had stepped into the bedroom.
Draco saw his mother's lips turn into a thin line. "The current wards, and any other traditional protective wards we might already have protect us only to the extent that we are in proximity to the Manor, or any of our private estates. Blood wards, however, are more specific to the family members, and it would calm my ailing heart if you could all be guaranteed an additional layer of protection even when you are called away from home."
"Sorry, muggle term," Ella apologized. "Anyway, most of us have at least one minor infraction before the Trace is gone, mostly for accidental magic that's easily excusable by magical parents-"
any sort of mundane parchment work, usually having others on hand to do so for him. "Is this standard procedure?" he inquired while flipping through the pages and making mental notes on where he needed to sign.
"It should be. This was once the ancestral home of the Black Family, so I'm guessing you were probably here as a child."
"There must be other ways," Draco insisted. Potter shook his head.
"Malfoy? Draco?" Potter inquired, slightly worried when the blond hadn't responded the first time. The use of his given name brought Draco back to reality, and, for reasons he could not fathom, it helped to steel his resolve.
"Merlin, Hermione, sometimes you're way too smart for your own good."
"-you've been fine for a pretty long time-"
It seemed she echoed the sentiment, because she leaned down and gave him a surprisingly long and lingering kiss, as if she were putting all of her unspoken feelings into the act. Harry opened himself to her, accepting this rare show of passion and bringing into their kiss his own emotions until both of them were lost in the sensation of being with each other once again.
"Mother?" he called out uncertainly. He hadn't exactly given her a clue as to when he would be back, as he had wanted to surprise her. Now, he wasn't sure about his original plan. Perhaps she had gone out for the day? Maybe visited a friend of hers?
It was too early for daybreak, but Harry felt Ginny stirring beside him. He turned over to face her, draping his right arm over her slim form. She kissed him, soft sweet pecks that made him want to cuddle all day and never leave the bed.
With a drawn out sigh that was lost to the breeze, Draco trudged up the path in Narcissa's wake, making his way to the West wing where his mother's private suite was.
It had been quite a sight, Malfoy with eyes so bright and wide and full of curiosity and wonder, and all because of a baby. He had told Harry how he had been looking forward to becoming a father, and how he and Astoria had celebrated the fact as soon as they found out. He even shared funny stories of Narcissa's absolute joy, which Harry admittedly thought was unimaginable. They talked at length about being only children, and Malfoy lamented that he had nothing close to Ron's large family ("he probably had every child-rearing manual drilled into him by his mother!") and Harry was quick to point out that neither he nor Ron had had a clue, and only learned from experience. He then gleefully listed every good and bad experience he had had so far.
Finally, Draco realized they were almost done. He was already weighing the testimonies in his head, trying to calculate in whose favor the judge would fall. As the time for judgment finally came, however, there was a sudden hush, immediately followed by a flurry of violent whispers. Draco tried to twist from where he was seated to see the source of the commotion, but the high back of his chained chair blocked his view from behind.
As if on signal, more voices were added to the room with the sudden arrival of Ron, Hermione, Hugo and Rose. Almost instantly, the energy in Grimmauld Place became supercharged and energized that Harry felt even more excited than he had been that morning.
"Becauseâ€¦" he started slowly, somewhat begrudgingly. But he knew he had to be honest. "Because none of that matters when you're the cleverest witch currently in existence. And I trust you to be able to figure it out where none of us have."
"Ah." The man leisurely got up to his feet and bent down to look at Draco eye to eye. "You'd be meaning
"Look at you, Potter," he said, but not unkindly. "You're actually wallowing on my couch. I'd expected you to handle matters much better than this."
Harry couldn't help it; his godson looked so adorable trying to sound patiently mature while also having an expression that was full of excitement. He gave him a brilliant grin.
"Hey, Draco!" Hermione's gentle voice called out from the emerald light in the hearth.
"PTSD?"
family when you were ten?!"
"Thank you," Malfoy said suddenly and very quietly. "Between you and me, Pureblood friendships are less shocking and more of a steadfast alliance. Neither Astoria nor I are quite accustomed to being attacked by a gang of Gryffindors like this, most notably within our private wards. Though we truly appreciate this... grand gesture."
At this, Kingsley closed his eyes and placed his chin on his steepled hands. "That is inconsequential information, Mr. Malfoy. Are you not pleased about your early release?"
The all-woman team, notorious for its past failures to gain enough head speed to make it to the finals, has baffled witches and wizards alike with their spectacular record of saves and a marvelously long run of goals, both of which has brought them to the very top of the 2001 Best Of Quidditch statistics.
Potter bristled. "Please don't."
He figured, after those last few days just hanging out with Draco with no problems whatsoever, '
He shook his head and opened his book, forcing himself to tune out the discussion between Narcissa and Astoria, and instead turned the pages to the first piece about neurally debilitating poisons.
The Healer nodded crisply. "The Healing team has unanimously agreed that Ginny's magical core is being detached from that of your baby's too fast and too soon. If she is to continue to full term, the magical bond with the baby could be severed completely and that would risk both of their lives.
It wasn't until he had begun to pace in front of his desk that he noticed a foreign piece of parchment resting atop his other files. Crisp and stark white against his mahogany desk, the folded card mocked him with its mere presence. With shaking fingers, Draco grasped at the note, fully intending to show it to Harry as soon as he read whatever new threat his stalker had left this time.
He turned to face Ron, who was just about to leave the room to call the others. "Hmm?"
"You mean like the suspect is waiting for a reaction?" Perkins asked. "Like it's a question, and they're waiting for an answer?"
This got the reaction Draco wanted, as the man let out a growl. The smirk disappeared. "Don't make the mistake of thinking you mean
"I gave them the memories to make sure my statement was airtight," Potter continued. "Then I specifically told Kingsley not to tell you."
Several moments passed by in silence, during which Draco did his best to hold his tongue, so that he would not be the first to break the peace. If she wanted him to admit to her face that she had been right about his failings in marriage, then -
Harry repeated to her what he had thought, about Ginny being much better when she was at training. Molly nodded meaningfully.
Draco nudged him. "It wasn't that bad. You actually made me feel better."
"Drink. I've put a Hangover Cure in our tea." The amusement was clear in his voice, "Kreacher thought we'd all need it, especially the git over there."
Sure, it had taken time, but Harry had finally realized that he, too, wanted the world to know how happy he was with Ginny. Like now, with the fantastic news about her being invited officially into the Harpies; it filled him with so much pride for her accomplishments, and he wanted to make sure everyone knew it. He wanted it known that he loved her and was proud of her.
"Then -"
"So she's back at Canada now?" Ron asked.
"I've been thinking," he said carefully. It seemed Ginny recognized his serious tone, and sat down with him, all ears. "You know, all this time, with the warding and all..." Merlin, why did he think he could even do this? "What I mean is, we've enjoyed this amazing privacy for almost two years now, and-and.."
"Yes, but-"
This year's subcontinental Quidditch tournament has gotten all fans up in a tizzy with the unexpected results. This writer is willing to bet all her entire month's Galleons that at least two thirds of the entire magical community in Britain have lost a fortune betting against the Holyhead Harpies, who have surprisingly finished the tournament with an impressive list of overall records above any other team.
Draco wanted to point out that he hadn't had any noise-related troubles at all since he'd stayed over, but he didn't think it was worth mentioning. Neither did he mull over the fact that he was actually quite enjoying the extended visit. It was a far cry from the occasional drunken Floo cross overs, not to mention the hurried exits before breakfast-
"Yes," he affirmed, voice gaining traction as his train of thought gave him a measure of relief. "If anyone can sort this out before it even happens, Potter and Weasley can. It's what they
in the entire existence of the Malfoy Manor, had there ever been a
"Harry-"
Ron nodded sagely and used his wand to magically throw some Floo powder into the fire. "Ernie Macmillan!" he called out.
Draco started at his mother's retreating figure in disbelief. He was no longer a child, and yet he still felt the need to impress her, to show that he was worth the title of Lord Malfoy.
Harry hadn't expected to hear so much after asking how Draco was after losing Lucius, but he didn't regret it. He boldly reached out to place his hand above Draco's on the table.
To be honest, though, Draco's main concern was how much time he would be able to steal away with his son while they were on the trip.
A sudden pop in front of him announced the presence of one of his house elves, who immediately bowed low. "Master Draco is back home," it said reverently. "Would Master be wanting to join Lady Black and her guests?"
His sigh of relief was apparently audible.
"No, why?" she asked, confused.
He turned pink with embarrassment. "Erm, just a nickname..."
"Oh don't you try that on me, Draco," she said with a little smirk, her voice full of humor. "I've spent too many years with the two worst liars on earth, and I think they're rubbing off on you. I'd've expected more from a Slytherin."
: It's the "Burrow" actually. Proper noun.
Suddenly remembering his reason for coming, Draco cleared his throat. "You mentioned earlier, something about other blood wards?"
"Thought you were Slytherin," the man huffed. "That sounded like an empty Gryffindor threat to me. Maybe that potion's already addled you too much."
: Yes, exactly.
Draco and Astoria had demanded for a private ward, and were instantly granted the request. This guaranteed that their family was safe from the prying eyes of passersby. Of course, Astoria was sure that the birth would be published and highly talked about in the next few weeks, which was why Draco was insistent that they spend the first few days only with their immediate friends and family.
Potter just shrugged and gave him an odd smile. Neither confirmation nor denial. "You know, Ron and I were talking about how we could all go to Viridian again for a couple pints. After your 'personal matters' settle down, of course." Potter laughed at Draco's dumbfounded expression. "Don't think too much about it, we just thought it would help us through the tension of the case, as well as your upcoming months of hell-"
"We're Gryffindors, mate!" Harry exclaimed with pride. "Nothing half-arsed, all brute force," he added with a wink. "You won't get rid of us that easily."
"Malfoy told me that nurse elves take care of children while the parents go back to their careers. Is that normal? I thought it was a bit much."
Surely, he thought to himself as he wandered the expansive garden behind the east wing, his mother would be unbearably smug for the next few days. She always was when she was right. Perhaps it was time that Draco admitted that.
"It's alright, mate!" Harry yelled back, "I was just about to leave, anyway, it's almost my turn to watch James, he's back at Andromeda's." He grabbed his cloak and was about to leave the foyer when he turned back to Hermione, eyes pleading. "Have a think about it, Hermione, alright? Please," he said, before finally leaving.
Well, he'd found all of that in Draco, and found that it was a package that he could come to appreciate in person, not just through the Floo.
Harry couldn't help but laugh. "Like I said, Mione, it makes sense. I know I haven't been completely... honest... with you two, but given your precarious position with your family..."
, dating a super-awesome-mega-foxy-hot Quidditch star is quite the experience, what with all that fame and glory." He poked the tip of her nose playfully. "But I'll tell them that none of that unwanted attention matters at the end of the day because this boring old Auror gets to take her home every night for the rest of his life."
He drained the last of the Firewhiskey and sent the glass to the sink. He felt much better now after the Ogden's, and despite the odd experience with Malfoy, he could now be properly elated at the news that the potions master had brought him. The case would finally move forward, which meant getting closer to the culprit. Putting his faith on Malfoy's skills had proven to be a good call, and he was glad that it wasn't in vain.
"Coffee. Now." Draco stood imperiously and began walking away. He paused to look over his shoulder to see the brunet looking at him incredulously. "What are you waiting for? Quickly now, chop chop!"
didn't have to spend such a long time primping in front of the dresser as much as Draco did.
"I'd planned a whole different welcome for when you came back," Harry decided to say. "Hermione had this idea, and Ron and I were so eager to go with her plan, and -"
With that ominous reminder, it seems we should all keep tabs on Ms. Weasley, as she might well prove to be what the Harpies need to stay at the top.
"Oh, Harry!" she said, voice sounding frantic. "I'm so glad you're home, I was afraid you'd still be out, but-"
"It's true. It's fact. It's got to be odd that we're absolutely fine just living our own lives apart. I'm starting to think that..."
Harry couldn't help barking out a laugh at that. "Ha! I wish! It's not like I can leave my own New Year's party though, can I?" Otherwise he would have already nicked his Firebolt and gone off the roof hours ago.
"Scorp?" she asked, bewildered.
"Just Harry." Potter leaned back and closed his own eyes. "If I'm not mistaken, we'd agreed to at least call each other by our first names now."
"Draco," Potter said suddenly, as if disregarding his best friends' words. Draco glanced at him, surprised at the sudden and casual use of his given name. "Are you sure about this?"
"I'm happy to do it, Andromeda," he replied, smiling. "In fact, I needed company anyway, and Teddy is just the perfect roommate for me."
And that he, Draco, couldn't wait to be there for him.
"She'll be alright, mate," Harry assured him (and maybe himself as well). "It was only when she was carrying Hugo that she even got a bit sick. She's as healthy as a horse most of the time."
Narcissa made a movement with her hand, as if waving off his answer. "I mean, truly happy. You were alive, ecstatic, bursting with giddiness every time you laid eyes on Scorpius. I thought Astoria deserved to share that same happiness of parenthood, which was why I thought to convince you to go to France. But..."
"I don't want my family to know. As head of the Malfoys, I do hold the privilege of authorizing such things discreetly." He turned pleadingly to Ron. "Please? Will you do it?"
Ron was scowling. "How could you let her leave her responsibilities like that? You're too lenient about it, mate," he said. "She's already done this to you once, I can't believe you'd let her walk all over you like this-"
"Of course," Malfoy answered smoothly. "Whatever else could there be?"
Draco raised an eyebrow, but there was a hint of a smug smile on his face. "Are you saying you were doubting my skills?"
But that didn't mean Draco's heavy heart had stopped aching.
Ron laughed, but grimly. "On the contrary, this stupid list just encouraged me to be more curious, so I guess whoever wrote it failed at that." He looked at Harry again. "So when are we meeting Malfoy? I mean, how is that even going to work?"
Harry bit his lip. "You don't think... he might..."
Harry shrugged. "Ginny has really bad mood swings. Though it's not like I would know, since I barely get to see her anyway..."
"I should probably go," Draco finally said. "Wouldn't want to take advantage of your hospitality, would I, Potter?"
As for Draco's friends, they had been unable to make it. Pansy and Oliver were still in Africa for the next three days, while Blaise was brokering a major business merger in America and wouldn't be back for a month. Draco didn't take it against them, and he sat back in a stuffy armchair next to Astoria's bed with full intention of melting into it. The elder Greengrasses, as well as Narcissa, had gone an hour and a half ago, which left Draco and his wife the rest of the evening to themselves.
Hermione's inquiry snapped him away from his thoughts, and his suspicious gaze fell automatically on the seemingly innocent piece of paper the brunette was offering to him.
Eyebrow raised in surprise, Draco retraced his steps back into the house. The only individuals who could send in mail to this address were blood relations and any others keyed in specifically into the wards. If it was a 'special' delivery, it could be any form of emergency from back home, which made Draco anxious.
"I know who it is! I can't keep silent any longer!"
Draco looked at Potter as if he were an obscure Potions manual. "Names?" he asked curiously.
Several weeks passed after the bindings were invoked for Malfoy when the next threat came. Harry rubbed frustratingly at his eyes in a valiant effort to wake himself up enough as he leaned a bit closer to the fire where Malfoy's face hovered, full of concern.
That morning found the Malfoy heir pacing back and forth in his mother's private sitting room. Narcissa had long given up on distracting him from his thoughts. Draco knew that his restlessness was cause for her concern, but he also knew that she remained passive in order to allow him to address her first.
"No," Malfoy said sharply. "I know what you're thinking. My father is securely guarded in Azkaban and any remaining Death eaters were already rounded up by
, if you ask me," Harry mused before he could stop himself from speaking. He immediately turned into a deep shade of red. He didn't want to sound all sappy in front of Malfoy.
," he insisted, gesturing towards one of the rooms upstairs. "There are so many extra rooms and floors that we can probably have our own floor if need be."
The brunet suddenly frowned. "Hang on. Won't Narcissa or Astoria look for him though? I don't want to be tortured and killed for kidnapping you two," he joked, aware of how protective the women could be when it came to the youngest Malfoy.
Draco looked at the image of Potter in his mind's eye. He'd always had a very good memory, and it'd come useful many times before. That was when he actually noticed the unique positioning of the arms. It was similar to what Pansy had taught him, when she insisted that he hold her-
"They're afraid of us," Potter replied stonily. "They probably want to make sure that none of us has any inclination to take over or stage a coup. It's like we're being identified, tagged and filed."
Draco scowled. "So what now? It doesn't seem to have provided any useful knowledge at all!"
"Mr. Potter, Ms. Weasley, if you would," said the courteous Mediwitch, pointing to one of the doors behind her. To be honest, it annoyed Harry even more for the reminder that they weren't yet a married couple, but apparently on their second child already.
"Hello, Hermione," he greeted back with a genuine smile. "Potter, Weasley," he added, nodding to the other two men as well.
"Don't you dare laugh at me, Draco Malfoy," she warned jokingly. "I've been told to eat for two, you know, and I don't intend to skimp on the quality."
Tears were now streaming down Ginny's face, and she turned towards Harry and hid her face in his chest. He knew she was still biting her lip so thoroughly.
Potter sniffed at it, then looked quizzically at Draco. "This is Muggle whiskey," he said, slightly dubiously.
When Narcissa was struck dumb by his outburst, he moved towards her and took her hands in his. "Thank you, for everything," he said softly, gently. "I know you mean well. I will... take your words into consideration."
It was ultimately George who had brought Molly back to them when, three months into the pregnancy, he came home to the Burrow for their usual family lunch and presented Harry with the tiniest pair of socks and a matching baby bonnet, both in a festive purple and orange design with the ostentatious WWW logo.
Draco bit his lip. He hadn't thought he'd ever see his wife, let alone his own mother, lose their head when they were always so good at controlling their reactions. Perhaps he had been experiencing the whole thing differently, being under Harry's personal safety net and not a mere Fidelius.
"Shut up, Ron, I'm trying to think here."
He glanced in surprise at her earnest look. He followed her gaze to the topmost book, 'Chambert Screte's Advanced Botany for Potioneers'. He raised his eyebrow in curiosity, which made her blush but answer defensively.
"I know I can trust your team," Malfoy suddenly said. "I trust
"Neither of you even stopped for a second to ask yourselves if maybe it was still... salvageable?" Ron offered, perhaps still holding out for the best possible outcome. He deflated though when Harry shook his head.
He expected some sort of smug reply or a sarcastic jibe, but there was none of that. Instead-
He realized he harbored a little anger at Potter if it turned our that he did in fact choose such a fate for his own family. Draco would have been overjoyed at having an heir, be it a son or daughter. He would be proudly flaunting his child in everyone's face, he would always take them out with him so that the world could see what it meant to be perfect, and people everywhere would marvel at the miracle of such a beautiful baby. He and Astoria would open their hearts to the wizarding world and allow every witch and wizard to bask in the glory of the new generation of Malfoys.
"My nightmares went away gradually when I left for my Mastery," he said, his tone clarifying that the subject was being changed on purpose. "Astoria didn't have to deal with them ever, not like my mother had to."
"Miss me already?" Draco knew that the MMI had grown to rely on him for the last few weeks, so his being away for a week must have made quite a difference in their output.
Draco doubled his efforts and sped up the staircase leading to their suite. In a heartbeat, he was in the bedroom where Astoria had been settled by the house elf who had found her. He sat himself on the bed next to her and roused his wife as gently as he could.
Harry woke up and groggily sat up in bed. Something had woken him suddenly, though he couldn't remember what. From downstairs, he heard the muffled sound of James crying, and he was immediately on his feet and pounding down the stairs.
"Thanks, Malfoy," the Auror said.
"Mother, Astoria and I have long since agreed that I've grown tired of such parties." He scowled. "I was willing to do it for the last few years to help our family regain its social presence. Now that we are in an even better position, I don't see why my wife can't keep doing exercising her commendable diplomatic skills without my cool indifference to hinder her."
"You're-" The old woman seemed at a loss for words, and Harry couldn't blame her. "You're Draco, aren't you?" she asked, voice shaking. She gave Harry a look which clearly meant what-the-hell-is-he-doing-here.
Malfoy remained silent for a while before looking at Harry. "I've never really looked back at my childhood with any purpose. Now, I have this urge to..."
Harry raised his eyebrow at her. "Oh, you know what I mean!" she said defensively. "I'm not saying he's a bad guy, I just think that the world isn't too ready to accept anything more than a friendly civility between Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy. It's just, well, there's too much history between you two, you know?"
"Draco, you've probably studied about the elements and their role in chemistry," Hermione began. He nodded. "DNA is similar, but more of a biological science. Specifically what we call Genetics. In a nutshell, imagine that every living thing is made up of tiny little cells. In each cell, there is an embedded code that is unique to every living being, and it is this set of genes that dictates what or who it is and how it grows and develops. They act as a blueprint, and contains highly unique information about the individual it pertains to. It is even possible to trace biological lineages for several generations. It is such for muggle humans, and I'm guessing it's the same with witches and wizards, too."
Which Harry had expected to be in another two months. Just his luck.
"Because the first day of the new year should be spent with the ones you love," Ginny said, making a good impression of Professor McGonagall.
"We know it was successfully invoked by Dumbledore for Harry when he was brought to his Muggle family, but anything more than that is hearsay," he explained as calmly as he could. "The Black ward that Mother found is very similar in nature, calling for a blood kin's sacrifice -"
"Harry, you've known that I was coming home tonight."
"Well, when you're ready, I'll have a full list of pre-approved single witches," Draco joked with an edge of good cheer that only reared its head when he was beyond tipsy. "All with impressive credentials, no-hero worship and attractive enough to balance out your unfortunate lack of good looks."
"Odair has finalized the tournament schedule in preparation for 2006," she said, somewhat matter-of-factly. "So I have to leave the Harpies in order to stay with the rest of the English National Team training pool."
"We really need to talk about this," he said heavily.
"Sorry, Auror Weasley, Auror Potter. These just got archived. Higher ups say they prefer you keep the originals."
: That's horrible. This wasn't on the news, was it?
Draco let out an amused chuckle. "Does my appearance always mean bad tidings to you?"
"I want us to fix this, Harry. I want to show you that I'm willing to make changes in my life, too. I had hoped the compromises I used to make were enough, but they weren't. Only seeing James through the Floo every other day hurt so much more than I could bear..." she looked towards the wall that separated them from their sleeping son. "I was so jealous that you could spend every waking hour with him. And seeing all of you so happy today, so whole and complete, without me, made me even more sure that I want to be part of this family again, for real..."
"So you-" Harry asked, looking at Malfoy. "That's the kind of contract you mean?"
"Harry I-" Ginny's wand made a shrilling sound, and she waved it to stop it. "I have to go, Harry, I'm sorry, I have to- I- I'll-"
"William Howeâ€¦William Howeâ€¦ " Apollo muttered as he cast a spell that went through an index that Harry was very familiar with, having put a lot of names there, himself.
"What?" Harry asked, huffing. "You didn't think we were being sincere about our reasons? I don't know if I should be offended, or..."
"Which is why some memory charms helped me out," the man sneered. "Didn't take long to charm the potion down your throat at such a close proximity, you know. A quick
Potter had trusted him with his biggest secret.
"Who would have thought we'd all become parents, eh?" he whispered, not really aware that Hermione had heard him.
"What are we talking about?" Potter had rejoined them at last, bringing with him a fresh batch of butterbeers.
"Nah," Ron said. "Just another useless process where you and Malfoy just sign off to verify, yet again, that you both were voluntary witnesses. It's stupid, but some dingy office probably needs these for no real reason but to make our lives more complicated."
Draco laughed. "Yeah, well, I'm just relieved I had an easy time of it. Mind you, Astoria did put up a fight."
"Old habits die hard," Malfoy winked at her. "I was just telling Potter this morning that it will be a long while before I make the switch to 'Harry', so perhaps we can add 'Hermione' to that list. Anyway, calling you 'Weasley' just blurs you with all the other Weasleys I already have to keep tabs on in my head. That's way too many, without you having to add to the lot."
"So? How has your first month of future fatherhood been?"
"Oi," Ron called out to his sister. "I hope all the Chasing in China hasn't made you blind to the fact that my wife might want to sit down, yeah?"
Narcissa interrupted him smoothly. "There are old wards from the ancient Malfoy line that offer stronger protections. In fact, we might also be able to look into activating some of the blood wards."
Astoria nodded. "I felt faint earlier, though nothing too bad. The Healers have told me that it might be because of my light meals. They've told me to try and eat more. It might also be due to the weather, since I'm more used to the warmer climes of France."
it, not really ready
"Yeah," the man said, nodding enthusiastically. "Surely you've thought out a couple in preparation for the birth, right?"
"And that's just alright with you?!" he suddenly exploded, making Ginny wince at his tone. "Are you fucking serious, Ginny? What the fuck do you expect me to do, wait around for you and stop my entire life because you can't even come home to take care of your son?!"
Draco pretended to be offended once more, but his face had the trademark smug expression. "You forget my charm, my wit, my sharp intellect, my highly aristocratic beauty. And my gorgeous body, of course."
It had been just past eleven, and they had already lost count of how many rounds they had had when their night took an unexpected turn. Draco could see that Weasley wasn't quite able to hold his liquor, though Potter still seemed alright. He himself was feeling slightly buzzed, but not yet on the brink of being pissed.
Ron seemed to react to this intimate admission, and he grimaced. "Mate," he began, though he appeared to be having trouble getting his words out. "I'm... I'm really sorry it all came down to this..."
"Potter."
Being a Malfoy, he immediately went for aloof and detached. "Thank you, miss," he said curtly, "seeing that other people hadn't been well-read enough to understand basic etiquette.." His eyes turned to the door through which the man had disappeared, then back at the woman. "You have my gratitude," he said with a slight bow, expecting a curt acknowledgment to the end of the conversation.
the brunet had said, again and again. Draco couldn't make sense of it.
what he meant! Oh no no no-" and she ran back out to the where the rest of the family were beginning to count down to midnight, with Harry close behind her.
"How eloquent," Draco said with a smile.
Harry felt like he was stuck in a surreal dream, though he couldn't decide yet if it was a good one, or a nightmare. So far though, he couldn't believe that he had just spent most of the midnight hours opening up to his childhood nemesis. And now he was nonchalantly bumping elbows with Malfoy in the kitchen while they made breakfast.
"This is through the Floo."
"At the Burrow this weekend. Ron and I had to go to that overseas trip, so we had them settled for the rest of the week with their grandparents. Anyway, I can be there in a couple of hours, if that's okay."
"It's a pretty desperate move," Hermione said. "And I believe Kingsley was telling us the truth. We know how he works, this can't have come from just him. It had to have been proposed for approval and it was probably treated as one of the many memos that goes through his desk each day. And I'm willing to bet that it was worded so it wouldn't attract unwanted attention until it was approved."
It made sense, Draco realized, from Potter's perspective. But definitely not Draco's. He had recently come to accept the fact that he wanted to finally have a family with Astoria, to hold his son or daughter in his arms and to whisper sweet nothings in the baby's ear as he rocked it to sleep. If his conjectures were true, then Potter was a lucky bastard, and no one even knew it. It made Draco seethe a bit, knowing that it was highly likely that Potter had one thing he didn't. He couldn't hold it against him, of course, but the old rivalry was surfacing in the worst situation possible, and it took all of his willpower to counter such envious thoughts. He was better than that, and he would show Potter. He was also mature now, and would not stoop down to snooping around just to find out more about Potter's dirty little secret. If the Chosen One chose to keep things under wraps, well then let him.
Malfoy looked him in the eye, holding his gaze while he appeared to be thinking of his answer. "Yes," he finally responded. "It goes against the Malfoy family tradition, but I would love to have a large family. Though not as expansively as the Weasleys, of course," he added with a friendly smirk. "The contract between myself and my wife include children, but the decision also rests largely on Astoria. Most Purebood families have only one, sometimes two heirs at the most, but..." he trailed off, a darker expression seemed to flicker onto his face, but the shadow disappeared at once. "...Having Vince and Greg with me at Hogwarts really made me wish I'd had siblings."
Harry went through his schedule mentally, a bit excited when he realized that he had some time off that very week. Perfect for some bonding time with his godson. "I can do it," he said enthusiastically. "I've got some time this week, I'm sure you and Arthur need to take more care of Hugo at the moment..." he trailed off, his worry for Hermione coming back.
Now that the path to his future was cleared of Voldemort and the Ministry, Harry fell into thinking of what to do.
"We're your friends now, Malfoy," he said softly, and he was sure that both his best friends echoed the sentiment wholeheartedly that he could speak for them. "Friends tend to be supportive of each other especially in times of great emotional upheaval or life changing events. Having your first kid sort of qualified for that."
Draco gaped, then remembered himself and shut his mouth immediately, silently seething.
"What?!" Harry felt like he wanted to explode with all the questions now pounding in his head. "Don't you want to spend quality time with him? Don't you want to just hold him and nurse him and bundle him in your arms and have him with you all day and night?!"
"You can come and help, though," Harry offered, thinking it would me much easier to take care of two boys in the same room than if he had let the kid run around downstairs while his attention was on his son.
He could call him Draco when the git decided to call him Harry. It was only fair.
"Yes, but you've just given me a short list of your closest friends. They're practically family. That makes sense. But me..." He faltered, not knowing where he was going with his argument. Why was he against this idea? He would gain extra protection. He could have Astoria, Narcissa and Scorpius all under Harry Potter's protection.
Harry narrowed his eyes, determined to really look at the blond seated across the other end of his couch. He was unusually pale, unkempt and slouched into the cushions. It was so unlike Draco, and yet still so very Draco, that Harry couldn't help but lift a corner of his mouth into a secret half smile for himself.
This particular flat, located in a Muggle neighborhood but near enough to the Leaky Cauldron, was a perfect choice. The building itself was inconspicuous enough for his tastes, simple yet equipped with more modern Muggle conveniences.
Draco knew that she was asking out of curiosity. From what Potter had told him, she had had a very dangerous and difficult first pregnancy, and her second, only a month ago, had been successful only because she had been given strict orders to stay home and remain stress-free. At least his wife was able to be as active a social butterfly as she always was, perhaps even more. It reminded him that he had chosen her well.
Harry looked around on the two coffee tables in the sitting room. "No," he said. "Must've missed the delivery, the owl usually delivers to my home office, but I have been to since this morning. I've had my hands full of Teddy, after all."
"Yeah, alright," Harry grinned.
Ron let out a nervous laugh. "Sometimes you scare me, mate."
From experience, Harry knew that the
She smiled warmly and Draco couldn't help but return her warm expression.
When he was but a second away from entering, Draco suddenly turned around and grabbed his mother by the silky sleeve of her robe. She looked at him curiously, wondering at the uncharacteristic gesture. Noting that the Greengrasses were still out of earshot, Draco leaned closer to her, but she broke the silence first.
: Well, my congratulations to you both. We hope to bear witness to your bonding ceremony. Surely the readers would love to read about the affair straight from the source.
. As I was saying, I hate that I feel like I owe you for so much
"We'll talk about it later," Harry whispered to Ginny discreetly when he felt her grumbling. "We have a lot to talk about but not here and not now."
"Very well, Draco," she smiled. "I shall find someone more... appealing to you." Oh, her Dragon deserved no less, but she sighed resignedly, knowing she had her work cut out for her.
"Thanks again... Potter."
Draco didn't think he'd have to stay beyond dinner this time, but when Harry suggested he remain for another night under the wards of Grimmauld Place, how could he say no?
: Some?!
Harry thought back to the past year of spending time with Draco, of sharing silent jokes and meaningful glances, of exchanging secrets and staying over at each other's places. The blonde's unerring understanding of what Harry thought and felt, and the closeness and comfort he can so easily provide without trying too hard. The fleeting looks and the sense of longing for Draco's presenceâ€¦
Harry couldn't help it, he let out a little laugh. "Yes, I did. Not sure for how long, but when I came back, your mum was checking to see if I was alive, and she lied to Voldemort to get to you."
"I don't want Daphne," he suddenly said loudly.
Ginny's unexpected pregnancy happened next.
He knew that he was beginning to sound enraged, and he was. But Potter still remained calm, though slightly more reserved, maybe even uncertain.
"Someone's pretty damn dedicated," Macmillan interrupted. "If they've been tailing you since before you left for France, then followed you there, it's gotta be serious business."
Ginny took another bite, chewing slowly and looking at Harry with a thoughtful look on her face.
He took a deep breath. "...if you would allow me a chance to at least suggest a possible name... for my son."
"Ah, Hermione, I'm not so sure he -"
"Is something the matter?" Draco felt that he sometimes worried too much, something that Pansy accused him of at every opportunity, but he felt justified when it concerned his child. Astoria seemed to be staring at the wall, as if refusing to meet his eyes.
Harry Potter. Harry Bloody Freaking Potter had sat himself in the stands, his face unreadable and his posture quite relaxed. Calmly, he stated his name and introduction for the record. It was such an odd picture, and it contrasted greatly with the grim tension that now enveloped the chamber. Draco found himself clutching at his stone chair, his knuckles turning white. For the first time, he was trembling. His mother, on the other hand, had an even cooler expression on her face, as if she had been carved out of stone, and then turned to ice. Surely with Potter testifying against them, neither would see the light of day for the rest of their lives. He had all the information necessary to incriminate them both, after all. Draco flinched at the thought of his future being in the hands of his archenemy. He and his mother were at his mercy, and Draco hated it.
And Potter. How could he even begin to describe that memory! Potter in his oxblood Auror robes, his stance relaxed, but wide and intimidating. His very presence exuded power, and though Weasley was the one with his wand trained steadily on one brother, Potter was clearly the bigger threat, wand or no. The pressure from Potter's magical aura was almost tangible, even in the Disillusioned observation room where Draco and the rest of the MMI team were watching.
Another frown marred Draco's face. It wasn't often that his mother would admit to being mistaken, and she had already done so repeatedly in the last few minutes.
inside and out. I know the requirements to successfully shield someone else, and I know exactly how much it demands. And I think we can easily fulfill that. Stop being so stubborn and just accept my offer!"
Harry was worried that Hermione might have been offended, but she clearly thought that Malfoy's sense of humor was worth laughing over. She gently rested her arms across her very pregnant belly. Ron placed a palm on her stomach as well, and Harry caught what seemed to be longing on Malfoy's face as he watched the couple.
Narcissa's expression seemed to relax. "Yes. My family did have their fair share of ancient magic. We Blacks weren't an Ancient and Noble House for nothing."
"What the f- Malfoy, it's a surprise to see you here," she said, sidling up to Harry's side. The Auror didn't move.
"Of course! I'm grown up!" Teddy exclaimed, puffing out his chest proudly and hair turning a shade of red. Harry was immediately reminded of a tiny Percy Weasley.
Harry could swear that the silence around him suddenly became deafening, if that were even possible. How was it that he had been able to feel braver in front of an audience filled with faceless strangers? Yet now that he was in an official meeting with Ministry representatives, he almost felt like a little child who was asking for more than he could have. In fact, the entire affair looked exactly like his hearing back when he was 15.
"We had that last time."
"Even now, most of the families in the Sacred Twenty Eight cannot manage to sire more than one or two children," he said morosely, looking her in the eye. "And one always covets what they cannot have. A child is essentially a gift of magic."
"Oh, it's different with Muggles, you see," she explained. Malfoy sat himself in one of the chairs, his attention on what he knew was an upcoming lecture. "Muggles continue their education formally in university, though it certainly isn't a must. But it is a common choice. One's career usually takes off in later twenties or even thirties. And further education is also an option, quite like your Potions Mastery, in fact, but it does take longer."
"I do work there, and I love my job. But it doesn't mean I have to agree with everything they decide to do. I may have done before," he said pointedly for the benefit of Ron, who had an accusing look at his pompous brother, "but when I came to my senses I realized that no one but you has the right to dictate what to do with your life."
"So, she's been waxing poetic about matters that make sense only to herself."
Potter's wistful smile was somewhat of a shock. "It's going to sound weird, to be honest, but... you've always been one of the constants in my life. Regardless of all the shit we've both been through, and all the hero worship on my end, and the stupid prejudice from your side, I find it comforting that we can always depend on our old rivalry to fall back on. It's like, we can't help but be at each other's throats all the time, but it feels almost right."
And Dream-Harry and Dream-Malfoy found themselves in an unlikely embrace that was full of forgiveness and acceptance, and Harry suddenly had an epiphany.
"Yes and yes," Draco replied immediately. "I admit that it will be very difficult to begin, because as you know, we will be working from so much theory and assumption with regards to the ingredients and how they could be used. But yes, it is 'doable', as you so elegantly put it, Weasley. Not to brag, but only those who have studied the art and science of Potions Making beyond what is expected can understand the very nature of magical ingredients and the subtle way they interact, even in theory. And yes, Potter," he looked pointedly at the brunet across from him, "this could narrow down your investigation and hopefully lead to the capture of the real mastermind. Should we fail, then at the very least, you will still have a better idea of where to investigate next."
Ron choked on his drink. "Gotta say, Ferret, I never thought I'd ever hear you talk about working for money." He had meant it as a joke, of course, and Malfoy took it in stride.
Ron evidently didn't know this fact, and his sudden understanding of the entire picture cleared up the pained expression that had been on his face the whole time. He took a shaky breath. "Wow, Harry, I just never thought of it that way."
"Since all of your research has been completely from the magical side of things, I decided to take the Muggle route. I hoped you would all keep your minds open, because I think we might be able to solve the problem this way."
"She's usually here," the shop assistant said conversationally. "Comes by often enough to be remembered by the assistants here."
"But, Ron," Harry argued, "it's not like Ginny will have the Chaser position held for her. She's worked really hard over the last few years to get the top spot, and being away for too long might jeopardize all of that."
"I love you, Harry," Ginny said, voice barely a whisper now. "I really do. And I've been too blinded by my own ambition to show you. I love you, and I love James, and if this is what it takes, then it's not too high a price to pay."
So far, he had survived for another three weeks of just him and James, plus the occasional visit from Teddy. Ron and Hermione only came over twice since their last talk, because Harry had insisted that he needed some more time to himself. Neither of his best mates had told him what to do or how exactly to handle his current situation, but they had been supportive just by being with him and listening. It was all he could have asked for and he was very grateful.
"Well, that's all I've found for now, so don't get your hopes up too much," Draco drawled, but clearly pleased at the sincere praise in Potter's voice.
Narcissa looked curiously at her son. "Of course, dear, but whatever would you wish to discuss with your old mother?"
"Our Healer says she'll be fine for as long as she avoids travelling abroad. She's been out and about, mostly mingling with her friends here, possibly trying to make up for all the European society balls she's missing by staying here."
"Seriously?" Harry suddenly said, surprise evident on his face. "You guys aren't... angry or mad or something at me?"
Malfoy - no, Draco - couldn't stop himself from snorting in laughter. "It's going to be so weird thinking of you as just Harry when all my life it's been Perfect Potter, the Golden Boy."
being invoked by someone who believed he had the Elder Wand (Draco shivered) and how the invocation didn't bind with his magic and he got killed anyway. There was also that story of a man whose wives kept being targeted by his enemies, so he called upon
"Apart from your darling husband making a fool of himself, Granger, the night was pretty much uneventful."
Malfoy looked at him as well, which made Harry slightly uncomfortable with all the attention. "Er, what else is there to understand about a marriage contract?" the brunet asked.
"It's affecting a whole lot of people though," Ginevra volunteered. "I mean, I bet it's causing loads of hard feelings in all departments that have come in contact with the Aurors. It's like the Ministry itself sees you all as possible criminals in need of surveillance. That doesn't say much for the officials if they don't even have trust in their own law enforcement body."
, he silently mused. It added perspective to the situation of securely housing a co-worker and his child while they were under threat of bodily damage from an unknown criminal.
Teddy gave him a beaming smile. "Granma says it's all real, and not just me
"She said noooooo!"
"It's not a bad thing, but it might be since you've been pulling away from all of us." The sad tone in her voice pulled Draco abruptly from his indignation. "I thought at first that you were placing too much attention on Scorpius, but now I see that you were content, and happy."
"Indian?"
Malfoy snorted. "Shut it," he said, tossing a biscuit at him. "I happen to think it's a fine tradition within the Black family."
Hermione had understood his plight, since she herself wanted a career in legislation that she could attribute to her own intellect and perseverance, not her popularity from involvement in the war. In fact, she had flat out refused and entered the Department of Magical Law Enforcement on her own.
"Go on," Harry said, "I'll Levitate Scorp to the nursery with the others."
Draco could do nothing but stare at the serious brunet in front of him. "For what?" he asked confusedly.
He sat up and blinked, memories of last night coming back to him. "Oh, Merlin," he swore aloud. He wasn't exactly sure what he'd divulged to Malfoy. Malfoy of all people in the magical universe!
He wheeled around in surprise. The note of stress from his mother's voice tugged at his heartstrings as if on instinct. "Mother," he said by way of greeting. It was very early in the morning, which was why he had chosen the eastern gardens - the sunrise provided such a peaceful vista that it helped to soothe his worries. It also served as an escape when he didn't want to be found, because Narcissa eventually caught on that he didn't want to be disturbed whenever he visited this particular haven. She never did.
"Draco..." Astoria's voice was soft but firm, and to Draco it sounded like skates on ice. Her eyes found his, and he saw pleading. "I had gone to St. Mungo's yesterday with a friend of mine, and I had just gone to accompany her. But I ran into Healer Lows, and we decided to have lunch together."
Harpies' Keeper Goberta Fier, 28, has been a consistent player on the team, and has been the only one to compensate for their weak Chasing. As we may recall from the particularly humiliating loss of 40-170 to the Tornadoes last year, her Keeping skills had been the only reason the Tornadoes scored only twice, before they managed to catch the Snitch in desperation. Manager Odair O'Finnicks was right in his once-contested decision to maintain her as Keeper on the team for the last 8 years. Her new record of 22 successful saves in a row has marked her down as one half of the driving force behind the Harpies' successful run
"Albus Severus," she whispered, and Harry's eyes both lit up and became very wet with tears at the same time. He remembered all the talks they had had over naming their second son, and this was one of the best gifts that he could ever think of.
"You made this for me?!" Hermione exclaimed. In her hands, she held a ceramic dish, inside of which was Harry's trademark Shepherd's Pie.
The image of Gryffindor's Golden Boy cramped into a richly upholstered yet unforgiving loveseat was pathetic enough for Draco to call out for an elf to Apparate Potter into one of the guest rooms on his side of the Manor. When the man blinked out from vision, surely to reappear in a much more comfortable bed, Draco allowed himself to collapse onto one of the lounges.
Draco heard the slightly begrudging way that Potter had said this, but he understood praise when he heard it. "This requires first distinguishing what the ingredients are, and then exploring every avenue of the magical characteristics of said ingredients, and then determining how they can all be used in conjunction with each other, and thus figuring out the possible nature of the hypothetical potion."
"I'm not complaining," Weasley said, mouth already full of cake.
"Did she, er, give you a hard time again?"
"Don't be silly," Narcissa huffed. "Now, I'll leave you to your packing. Merlin knows how complicated your wardrobe gets in the face of thee types of fancy balls..."
"How's everything going so far?" Harry inquired. "Sorry for disappearing, I just needed some air."
"I made it! I made it! I made it!" Harry shook his head, laughing at Ginny's childlike exuberance. She had just ended a Floo call with one of the team managers of the Harpies, and was now brandishing her good news with a joyous display of shouting and jumping all around the sitting room.
To the Auror's satisfaction, the blonde had nothing more coherent to say, and Malloy's unconscious imitation of a gaping fish pretty much told Harry that he had won this round. Now, all that was left to do was figure out was how to actually apprehend the mystery suspect.
"Perhaps I wasn't expecting you all to... you know... really consider..."
he thought) looked a bit crestfallen, but then a corner of his mouth went up a few notches. "Is it really that difficult?"
Of course, even he knew that there was a very narrow, possibly non-existent margin of error when it came to Hermione and researchâ€¦ Which then prompted him to start worrying about Scorpius even more. It didn't help that he had essentially isolated himself in his barricaded study, but he couldn't really face the facts just yet. Not when his son was concerned.
Hermione had just gone to the bar to get them a few drinks, so Harry took that moment to interrogate Ron about his proposal, which he had been planning. The redhead, of course, turned red.
Draco thought about that, reflected the slight heaviness in the tone of voice. Potter was obviously speaking from experience. It made him wonder if he was referring to Voldemort's time, or his run as an Auror, or perhaps something else that he just had no idea about. "I never would have thought it was a common occurrence," he said lightly.
"I don't want this to be even bigger than it already is," Harry whined. "Bringing in the team, even for just research, will be putting too many people involved. I'd prefer to keep this between ourselves for now. If possible, just between Ginny and me," he added.
As the woman strode out of the room, Draco remained and helped to calm down Astoria's sobbing.
As Ron had predicted, it had been quite difficult to juxtapose the good news of a new baby and the terrible news of breaking an engagement, but it had to happen, and it did. Confronting Molly and Arthur was perhaps the greatest challenge Harry had ever had to face that year, but he and Ginny had reminded each other that this was their family, and that they would eventually come to their senses no matter how long it might take. Weasleys, apparently, held no grudges.
"Is that a Muggle sentiment?" There was no venom in his question, only mild curiosity.
"But now that you're back, and once again playing the part of the perfect husband, you have seemed more restless... your actions betray your doubtfulness. You appear...less sure of yourself. I cannot stand seeing this abrupt change. You were so full of joy, and now you are acting as a shell of your former self. All you do is shadow Astoria and drown her in attention that she already has enough of. You are acting like a lost pet, unsure of where you stand and hoping desperately to gain favor. It is far from who you are. I do not understand."
he wondered.
Harry clenched his fist, feeling his nails bite into his palm. "For Merlin's sake, what else could go wrong?"
Draco had allowed several weeks to pass after he had had that reminiscent sit-down with his mother. Narcissa had gladly recounted all the little milestones that he had made as a toddler, but throughout her tale, he couldn't help but notice the fleeting sparks of sadness that curtained her expression whenever she spoke of the strict Malfoy upbringing that Lucius had so insisted. The Black family had always leaned towards Pureblood ideals, but Narcissa admitted to having been part of the generation that had been exposed to more liberal ideals. Her sister Andromeda, had welcomed her estrangement and lived out her life in relative happiness away from the strict upbringing, while her cousin, Sirius, had gone completely against the grain and done everything within his ability to upset his elders, choosing Gryffindor as the greatest insult to his own family. Narcissa, however, had married into the proud Malfoy family, which was perhaps as traditional and old-blood as Pureblood could ever get. She knew what to expect from such an arrangement, and while she and Lucius had had a strong alliance and a rather warm closeness, she did not always agree with the strict and sometimes painful treatment of children in the Malfoy line.
"Oh no," he muttered, looking back reluctantly at Malfoy. "Er, I'll just- I'll-"
"What time is it?" he asked.
Hermione shook her head in disbelief. "I'm sure she and Harry have talked about it thoroughly and adjusted to each other's needs, haven't you, Harry?"
"I was being all serious..." Potter said defensively, finally finishing his last gulp of mediocre coffee. He looked intently at Draco, which made the latter feel vulnerable, his hands clenched (he had finished his coffee a few minutes earlier, which left him little else to do with his hands). "I appreciate you being here. I meant what I said."
, he thought bitterly to himself. Hermione's presence in the Manor, coupled with an extended exposure to Narcissa and Astoria, might have been too much for him to ask. One couldn't simply sweep everything under the rug - especially not under the rug that Hermione had possibly been tortured on.
"It's funny how you're putting yourself at a disadvantage now, you know," Draco pushed somewhat recklessly -- anything to get a rise out of this crazy wizard. "You seem to know all about me, though I might reiterate the fact that I neither know nor care about who you are."
Finally, it seemed like Malfoy had run out of patience. "Nevermind. It doesn't matter, Potter, you don't have to tell me," he sighed, moving to gather his coat.
"I said, I've yet to ask her, alright?" Ron clearly looked like he had swallowed a slug, so Harry did his best to change the subject. Hermione was on her way back anyway.
When the two of them settled back into their chairs, they fell into small talk, and Harry had to admit that it was getting much easier to talk to the blond. Sure, they had differing opinions about a lot of things they discussed, but again, they fell into the old habit of competing with each other somehow, and they both took comfort in that.
A big chunk in the middle is text-dense, because well... Harry's got a lot to think about. :)
"Harry!" she sobbed. "I don't know what happened! I hadn't realized until I got your owl! News from Britain doesn't get here fast enough, but I did my best to arrange this call-"
"My apologies, son," Narcissa said, tipping her head gracefully. "But with such an expression on your face as you Flooed in, anyone would have come to the wrong conclusion as well."
"I cannot explain, but ever since those first few times when I was suspicious of your behavior... your bonds with Potter, and Granger and Weasley are what add to your vitality, your sense of contentment. You may not see it, but from an outsider's perspective, it is quite obvious that your exposure to them always has you in good spirits at the end of the day. And that is something that I wish you to have as much as possible."
Molly, however, became cool and silent towards the both of them for at least a month after the big announcement. It was painful for Harry, who had never had the experience of having a mother who would react such a way, but Ginny had assured him that she had survived at least twenty instances of Molly giving her the cold shoulder for something she had done as a child. Harry did not feel better.
"Wow..." Potter was almost whispering to himself. "Malfoy, that's- that was amazing, thank you for calling immediately!"
Harry laughed as he imagined the woman who had willingly married Oliver Wood. That
"So what's up, anyway?" Harry said, now testing the waters. He was worried about his friends, but he wasn't sure how to bring it up without prodding too much. When Ron looked at him, Harry rolled his eyes, unable to control himself. "Oh give it up, Ron. I've known you for so long that I'm pretty sure I know when something's wrong. You're fighting again, are you?"
"A Fidelius would grant your family extreme secrecy, but by itself would hamper your daily life if
The expression on Draco's face mellowed somewhat, which got Harry feeling more relaxed.
"Or perhaps celebrating?" Harry offered. "Maybe they've realized their long-standing feud was stupid. I mean, here we are becoming proper mates and everything."
"Yes, well," she chuckled. "We had been trying for a while, so imagine our joy when we found out. You and Astoria have been pretty busy recently, so you probably just need to get used to the idea. When it sink in, then you both can have the proper celebration you've probably been fantasizing about."
it, if that makes sense," Harry said. "How do I put it? I mean, we never even really thought about how we would really treat parenthood, you know? It sounds kind of sick, but I guess it was like we felt ready for a family, but we were only really thinking like we were preparing to get a
?" he asked for the sixth time. He was sure that his face was now a fool's mask, but he couldn't care less, because Harry-bloody-Potter had just casually proposed a possible solution to his temporary safety, as if the repercussions were a mere toss of a coin.
Ginny let out a sigh. "We'll have to go back out now, won't we?"
"That's a wonderful idea, mother," Draco said gratefully. "Please, prepare anything we might need and Astoria and I shall be back as soon as we can secure an international portkey to Wiltshire."
"It's just..."
What he didn't count on was that they would go even more beyond that expectation.
Harry had no idea what to say. Malfoy had been extremely perceptive despite the
Draco nodded. "I believe she is the younger Greengrass. We never met at Hogwarts, but she was a couple of years below."
"Look at where we are now, Malfoy," he said with amusement. "Entertaining each other and crossing over one another's hearths at odd hours on odd nights..."
"And Hermione?" Ginny's voice was very quiet.
It was probably the result of being holed up in his own home, without all the banter provided by the Aurors at the office. He was most definitely going stir crazy. He reminded himself to owl Ron to see if another boy's night could be arranged as soon as possible.
This case frustrated him, mostly because he knew he couldn't be out there, actually doing something, until he was able to glean enough information from the stacks of parchment littering his table. The severity of the situation was like a bell tolling in his head, reminding him that time was running out and that the consequences would be dire. His eyes flicked towards a photograph on one of the piles. He quickly averted his gaze, but the image had already been burned into his mind anyway. How could he forget that frail body, slumped on a carpeted floor, light hair strewn awkwardly on the floor around the girl's face? She was only one of many victims, and it was up to Harry to track down the murderer.
"Hold on, Weasley," said Malfoy, "are you telling me that you and Granger didn't have the traditional contract?"
"I know, Herm," Harry said, looking back up so he could meet her eyes. "I just hope they... don't take it too badly."
. He was hoping to gather as much of current information as he could before meeting the two Aurors. He didn't want to appear to Potter that he was lacking in even one small area ofÂ the subject. They had reached out to him for help, andÂ Draco would make sure to deliver much more than they had asked for. It was part of his pride, of course, to be able to show Potter that yes, he,Â Draco,Â was actually a top-ranking and highly respectable wizard. Â One look from his mother, however, and it seemed that he and Astoria were once again about to be given 'the talk' regardless of their obvious disinterest in actually talking that afternoon.
"You asked for it."
Draco laughed at that. He hadn't expected Potter to be so direct and honest. It was refreshing, to say the least. "Well, is there any particular reason for calling, then?" he asked. "I'm sure I sent you that letter requesting for leave-"
Draco looked at him curiously. He had now spent enough time to know that Potter was the complete opposite of arrogance and attention-seeking. At the moment, he could observe how it made the Auror completely uncomfortable. He decided to go back to the topic they had eclipsed.
Ron began reading out from the report in his hand. This case seemed so long ago. "Hereâ€¦ Hal Pince just
As Harry and Ginny dug into their food, one of the patrons looked in their direction and gasped with recognition. As expected, the rest of the room followed suit, with men, women and children laying eyes on the Chosen One and his companion. Harry and Ginny remained oblivious to the attention, focusing instead on the funny story that Ginny was sharing as Harry took another bite of his meal. One man stood up and left abruptly.
Draco had no idea what to say. Despite having prepared his smug speech about his cleverness and intellect, he had been distracted by Potter himself. Now that the smoke from the flames cleared, he saw that Potter was incredibly tense. Curious to see what had him suddenly guarded, Draco looked at Potter's arms, which looked like they were trying to wrap around thin air. That was odd. He shook his head and came back to his senses.
"I honestly never thoughtâ€¦ well, it never crossed my mind."
"You have two," Harry pointed out. "You managed just fine."
"Fuck, Ginny," he whispered. "You're getting me so hard just talking like that."
"Yeah, I discovered this place when I visited the flat for the first time." He had grabbed a bite to eat here that day, and found that their deli was to die for. He figured even someone as snobby as Malfoy would fall in love with the chefs here.
Draco could find no will for a scathing remark or a sarcastic snarl. Without a word, he shook off Hermione's comforting touch and stormed off towards his private study.
As the redhead continued listing, Draco was quite scandalized that the trio could openly discuss such matters lightly. He stole a glance at Potter, whose eyes were filled with mirth and amusement. Clearly he didn't seem to mind one bit. There was nothing passive aggressive or tense in the atmosphere - they were all, to put it bluntly, survivors of the same traumatic childhood, and thus possibly found that amusement in their shared history was a much better way of moving on. Or so Draco thought.
Deep in his gut, Harry felt the stirrings that told him that this was another chance for them, another start, another beginning. And that was exactly what they needed.
to protect both him and his newest wife. But he had to visit another kingdom, and he was gone so far and for so long that her wards weakened and made her vulnerable to attack once more. Yes, definitely way too much information, but at least he could still one-up Potter from a distance.
"You know," he heard himself say out of nowhere, "Kreacher keeps burning his beans, so I have to stock my kitchen with the canned sort. This is really good."
"What about Hugo and Rose?"
The thought brought back his nerves, and he kept pacing, probably running the floor thin with each step, but he couldn't care less.
Draco's tone of voice was still a bit matter-of-fact, which made Harry wonder just how close the Malfoys had remained after the war. Of course, he had already known about Narcissa's willing separation from Lucius , as well as the subsequent rise to fame that everyone attributed to Draco and Astoria's efforts. It was only now that Harry realized he had no idea about Lucius Malfoy's fate beyond his admittance into Azkaban. To hear of his passing now was quite unexpected and shocking.
"What's wrong?" Hermione asked concernedly.
The Leaky Cauldron was always the go-to place for wizards in London, but Harry decided that he and Ron needed a much quieter environment. For this reason, it was at one of the more exclusive and hidden pubs that they found themselves in, settled in a booth and nursing their pints. Of course, no one bothered them, not having recognized who they were as Harry had wished.
Harry paused to think about it. "I guess it could be true," he said slowly. "Ginny was always tired, physically, but she always had this great mood. She had a lot of stress as well but now that you mention it, she was always happier than sad." He mentally compared Ginny's exhausted but contented smiles, against Hermione's fragility and pessimism. Where he and Ginny had decided to see the pregnancy as a slight speed bump but a gift nevertheless, he knew that Ron and Hermione had had debates on the practicality of child rearing, and tended to focus on their personal differences. He couldn't really see Ron adding to the negativity, because they worked together and he was a witness to Ron's amazing work ethic, his efficiency at keeping his professional and personal lives clearly defined. He never took work home with him (as if Harry would let him!) and he always looked forward to coming home to his wife.
That left Draco in place, deflated but determined. He took a deep breath to gather momentum for his upcoming talk with Astoria.'
"I thought you didn't believe any of the Malfoy aphorisms that Father spouted."
"Before-" Malfoy's eyes widened in disbelief. "Potter, you realize, 'before Hogwarts' means 'before eleven."
"I had always wanted to do that with you," Narcissa suddenly mused. "Back when you were still a tiny bundle of blondeness. I always wanted to steal you away from the nurse elves. Your father, of course, made it more difficult since the elves were more likely to listen to his orders instead of mine. I did manage it though, and I have never regretted those moments when I could hold you as if we were the only two beings left in the world and all we had was each other."
He nodded.
Now it was Malfoy's turn to laugh. "Seeking comfort from a sworn enemy," he pointed out. "Tsk tsk, you know it's basic personal security," he teased, a grin on his face.
"What about that place I keep hearing about? Viridian?"
It was perfect, he thought.
"You need
Narcissa was lounging in the smaller breakfast alcove in a secluded corner of the Manor when Draco joined her for breakfast. The tension in her face, which her son had grown accustomed to in the last few months, had almost completely melted away, and her face was slowly returning to its graceful beauty. Draco himself, had flourished quite well after the strange events that occurred at their trial.
Draco picked up on the hint. "You don't think he's in charge of anything." he concluded matter-of-factly.
Ron banged on the table. "Son of a bitch!"
Potter's voice cut into his trance, and Draco had to shake his head to clear the fog from his mind. "Can we speak privately?" he asked, looking the brunet in the eye, waiting until he finally nodded his agreement.
Harry gave a shaky laugh. "I've been telling myself that for a while, Hermione... but I've come to realize that something's... it's just not right anymore."
The surprise call from Malfoy had certainly shaken him up, there was no doubt about it. It had been unnerving to see the blond's face through the emerald fire, staring straight at James. At first, Harry had feared that his privacy bindings had failed, and he spent a good five seconds internally checking all the wards he had put on his son. Thankfully, however, Malfoy showed no indication of having sensed James' presence, though he did repeatedly worry Harry by pointing out his arms.
Potter laughed heartily at this. "No, I don't suppose it does," he choked out. "It seems I can adjust better than you. Though I think the only reason I can easily switch between your first and last names is because they're both equally weird to me. So it makes no difference, really."
Harry only smirked, trapping her in his arms and moving closer so there was barely a hair's breadth between their lips. "Tell me that after I'm done with you."
Draco considered for a moment. "Why don't you get nurse elves?"
Draco merely nodded, even though Potter didn't ask a question. As he had suspected, the Auror seemed to understand his intentions immediately. Something between the two of them changed that night, and he knew in his heart that he welcomed this new dynamic between them, whatever it was. And he knew without a doubt that Potter felt the same way.
gave them, but she had joked many times throughout their relationship about going public and showing the world what they had together. Sure, they enjoyed going out more often than either thought possible, and were able to avoid any unwanted attention. But Harry learned that part of being happy in a relationship was the acknowledgement. Knowing that others knew of your love. He didn't want Ginny to feel taken for granted, kept like a dirty secret when she obviously wanted and deserved more than that.
He didn't.
Harry placed a hand on her knee and squeezed gently. "I'm glad you're here, and I'm sure our son is, too."
"Don't be silly," she admonished, while also rolling her eyes at him. "You're our friend, and I'm absolutely sure that having your apathetic, egotistical self by Harry's side will help to distract him."
"That's all the evidence we're starting with?" Macmillan asked again. "Not saying it's nothing to go on, but that'll be inconclusive at best."
The Auror growled under his breath in apparent frustration, which Draco secretly relished, considering he had once again aimed for it on purpose. He loved getting under his former nemesis' skin, no matter how trivial it may have sounded.
Ron nodded. "Pureblood tradition. If you've got two nurse elves, the kid hardly lacks for anything. But that's not how most people do it nowadays. Even some Pureblood families now are starting to take time off to at least keep an eye on the elves. What?" he added at Hermione's incredulous look. "It's an old custom, it's not that common now, but don't look so shocked."
Harry and Ron received individual owls from Malfoy that week, explaining quite formally why he couldn't work on the formula for a few days. He had been quite blunt about the reason, of course, publicity-whore that he was.
Draco frowned. "Tagged?"
"However..." she gave him a sparkling smile and squeezed his arm. "It does not mean that you should cease from your instinctual need to dote on your own son. Perhaps a compromise will work best in this circumstance. It might be a little unusual for the more conservative purebloods when they find out that you wish to be involved in your sons early childhood development, but you can always keep that more private. Meanwhile you can easily cater to Astoria's needs and deal with them in the spotlight. Look at Pansy and her husband."
It wasn't that he was sad, or mad, or angry. He wasn't even properly frustrated. He just felt like he was an over-inflated dirigible, just waiting for the moment of explosion with no prior warning.
There was a popping sound, and Kreacher appeared, bowing low. "Good morning Master Harry," he wheezed. "You have missed the breakfast today, is there anything you want Kreacher to prepare for lunch?"
Harry did love cooking though, but he understood what Ginny meant. She hates cleaning up messes, and always wrinkled her nose whenever she watched Harry prepare a meal. Sure, she loved the romantic candlelit spreads he would make in occasion for the two of them, but she didn't think cooking everyday meals was worth the mess.
He went as far as to talk about the beginning of his engagement to Ginny, but he felt like it was too private to share any more about that, so he focused on the one thing that Malfoy most wanted to hear about: James.
"Draco, love," she called out behind her as she walked away, "would you be a dear and send up the Belgian truffles? One of the elves Apparated it once and it just tasted awful after, they're much better untouched by their magic."
"Yes? You were talking with whom?"
It wasn't even something he could properly process at the moment, but his thoughts and actions confirmed the facts: he undoubtedly cared about Draco Malfoy. A fucking lot, if his tightly clenched fists and escalating frustration were anything to go by. Harry hadn't exactly left himself much room for denial.
He went through the letter line by line. "The new recipe they're talking about made no sense to me at first. But then he mentions Severus, which of course seemed even more mental. But when he says the thing about Severus wanting to feed him himself, it all just fell together. There was nothing Severus would have loved to do than to force-feed Potter poison. And Weasley had almost died when he had the bottle that I-er-that I had meant for Dumbledore. And he tacked on that awkward expression at the end, but I think he's quite literally saying that he wants me to get on their case, to help themÂ figure outÂ a recipe for something that might be a deadly potion."
"A friend of mine can have the samples analyzed as soon as possible," Hermione continued. "She's a muggle, of course, but this is her area of expertise, and there will be little room for error."
Ginny shook her head. "Actually, I was thinking of just Ginny Potter..."
"I went down on one knee and everything, and I-I think I did okay when I told her-I mean-I'd been practicing, you see..."
"I'm glad you got home earlier tonight," he whispered. He hadn't realized how much he missed having her around.
"Oh, he was, of course," Hermione held Hugo closer, moving his head so he could rest it on her shoulder more comfortably. "The thing is, Ron and I were sort of... dancing around some problems at the time." A faint blush washed over her cheeks, and she looked away from Draco. "Harry was the one who shook me up and made me rethink a lot of things then."
"Hello, Potter!" he greeted brightly, dusting himself off with his free wand hand.
Draco felt lost. He had grown up in the shadow of countless Malfoys who claimed prestige and honor. He had been raised and bred from the finest and purest of magical blood, but here he was, drowning himself in thoughts that merited at least a hanging in the Malfoy rule books. The very idea was very much treason, but Draco couldn't give a damn.
After the expected pop of Disapparition, Draco finally moved closer to the pristine parchment, feeling scrutinized as if it were a sentient being staring innocently at him and not just a piece of paper.
To the surprise of both men, Harry stopped him. "Stay, please."
"Sorry, mind repeating that?" Ginny asked, unable to decipher Ron's mumblings even till now.
"And you should sleep, you look like shit."
"Well, thank you then for the warm and fuzzy version of your friendship," he quipped lightly, and was promptly surprised at the slight frown on Malfoy's face at his words. "What?"
"Of course," said Hermione. "But would you mind getting to it now? I think it's best you read it before hearing it from someone else..."
"You're welcome," he said. He was startled when he felt Draco grasp his hand gently. There was something behind the shiny grey eyes, but he couldn't tell what.
