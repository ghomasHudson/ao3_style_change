Watching Harry all the while, Draco curled up and with his head tucked on his own shoulder, making this low rumbling sound. That might sound like a cat’s purr if it weren’t too many decibels lower. But the invitation—or demand—in the noise was clear.
The last time, he even had to wear a bloody uniform out of it. The dragon required Harry to be adorned as well—mainly in his official Auror robes because Draco said they were
When Draco had naively ventured into the human world in search of food and the vainer hope of friendship amongst land dwellers who couldn’t understand him, he’d never expected to be caught while in human appearance, or end up anywhere like the
From what little of their conversations he could hear through the thick glass, Draco was frustratingly only able to piece together a few snippets—something about assigning him a keeper, whatever that was.
He let the seemingly sharp object—magicked to be smooth, flexible and softer than the metal —invade his body, to the shocked and scandalized gasps of the crowd. Their reaction mattered little. Because once again, for all their misgivings and appreciation for the supposed social niceties and decorum of magical wizarding society,
Unable to keep looking at something he learned to identify with his body without feeling more foreign to himself, Draco stared at Harry instead.
His presence remained a welcome distraction as Draco openly stared at his pert behind from underwater, consideringly. A human being the one to inadvertently give him a show for once entertained him for quite a while. And it allowed his mind to take a break from processing the stark change of his location.
He began his tried and true performance, that wizards and witches of high wealth paid gallons of galleons to attend. Starting slow, he merely gyrated his hips and swam in lazy perfect circles while splashes of color were summoned to the left and right of him, to accentuate his dance’s sensuality all the more.
It wasn’t a ‘rut’ or whatever strange human notion Harry had given it, unless that meant: perfectly natural reaction to the presence of your mate and their courtship. The ‘heatwave’ was a consequence of sirens discovering their mate. Draco just hadn’t expected to present with it so soon. Perhaps without realizing it, he’d mistakenly thought there’d be a lesser reaction within himself to a human mate. Evidenced by Harry’s huge effect on Draco, he couldn’t have been more wrong.
Mid-description of a hill both made of crystal and topped with flowers that would combust with too enthusiastic a breeze, the hands she’d been using to animate her words lowered, gaze suddenly empty as she stopped her rambling to tilt her head at him. “It’s going to be different today.”
He didn’t know how long he sat there for, with the dangerous feeling that nothing mattered anymore. He’d lost Luna, but then he’d had Harry. But apparently, Luna had been wrong… because Harry was leaving him too. He was being abandoned and
The melody slipped gently out his lips as he pressed Harry’s hand to his chest. ‘Me’ he mouthed after. Then he said it again, and Harry repeated after him, eyes wide in wonder.
When he woke up next, it was to the hushed voices speaking around him. They came in and out of focus like the tide. His eyes weren’t able to see anything though he was sure they were open.
Rather than the open ocean, Draco awoke to new human faces that, unlike the gazes of strangers he was used to, did not regard him with open admiration or want. No—by the way in which they studied him, it felt less like they appreciated his looks and were more interested in what he was
Having lived through a war, there were few moments like this where both he and Draco could feel this completely safe.
Draco was too, that his mate could not want him, could not love him as much as Draco did him, and would not keep Draco. The loss felt like when Luna left him, only
Draco looked over curiously from his platter of fish past Luna’s shoulder, and recognized the new person immediately.
“We don’t know how long Draco will stay out of rut. Rut is meant to be a natural experience for sirens.” Hermione said slowly. “We’ll just have to keep that in mind about our plans to release him,
After pocketing the miniaturized crate and having gotten what they came for, they genially bid Mrs. Kubyn and her shop a wonderful day.
Initially, ever since the first meal, the human didn’t talk much at all, just watched Draco eat, which suited Draco fine. Silent company was still company, simply better than nothing. So Draco would relax with the familiar sensation of having someone to eat with. Harry’s eyes being fixed on Draco the whole while also heartened him.
Draco slowly lowered himself to align it, obscuring his actions with his hands till the last second. And then he pressed the hole beneath his slit to it and began impaling himself for all to see.
But the wall closed up as usual. With both of them still outside it, staring at a rough rockface of uninterrupted stone. Nothing happened as they waited.
Instead of being bothered by his own reaction, he was swept up by the ensuing elation that coursed through him at the soft recognition of the beginnings of an idea he’d overlooked until now…
Eventually he could eat no more. With a full stomach, he reluctantly pulled back from the physical closeness he still hungered after. As soon as he had, Harry stood up, stretching his back and arms. Draco wanted to poke them.
These humans who watched him but did not interact, mostly came in and out of doors within a hallway outside his water filled container. They observed him from a window that made up an entire wall of his tank on one of its longer sides—the three remaining walls were as white as the uniforms they wore. They wrote on boards stacked thick with paper, and conversed with each other as they moved back and forth through the long hall. A hall which, as far as Draco could see, held no visible creatures further down it besides himself.
He never thought Draco would answer no because of what he was, and Draco had proved him right by accepting to become such an exhibit. Suddenly all the shows before—every instance he turned himself into an instrument for human’s sexual enjoyment and re-imagined it as a success of his magical abilities—tasted rotten in his mouth. The self-delusion and misplaced pride that despite his imprisonment, taking up this activity wasn’t so humiliating since he’d had a choice meant nothing if no one had believed he could refuse such an offer.
“You have to eat or you’ll starve.” He gestured to the bucket of fish he placed between his crossed legs. Draco eyed the fish dubiously, wary of a trap. There’d been the one girl who tried to get him to snarl in order to stuff his face with fish. He’d been particularly ardent in terrifying that one away.
He had short red hair and blue eyes, and his relaxed face seemed friendly enough. And when Draco swam up to the edge to look closer at him, he was the first to actually wave and greet Draco. The generous muscles on his arms stood out as he worked on some pipes leading into the tank. He wasn’t bad on the eyes and he left Draco well-enough alone, rather than taking notes on him and every minor action of his.
He wondered how Luna managed it—appearing merely human as far as most could tell. As one of the few creatures deemed without an entertainable skill or qualifying “charisma” as Slughorn liked to call it, she was stuck with odd jobs tending to the other creatures around the establishment, which she rather enjoyed. At least, she seemed to be fond of caring for Draco. But Luna never struck him as the kind of person to complain much about anything, between her mysterious silver linings and being more invested in the unusual thoughts in her own head than life’s happenings outside it. It made it that much harder to stay negative around her.
Instead, Draco bit into another mouthful of fish as Harry mentioned his friends Ron and Hermione again, complaining—good naturedly—about their unnecessarily fervent public displays of affection when he was around.
A fish smacking against the man’s back got his attention. Startled, the redhead turned around only to face a volley of dead fish Draco hurled violently at him, flashing his teeth and scales aggressively all the while. Once he’d emptied his arms, Draco sneered at the dumbfounded man. Sliding out the water the rest of the way, Draco began to hiss and drag himself toward him, ready to toss the same fish scattered on the ground all over again, causing the red-head to scurry away and shut the door behind him.
The gifts inside the packages eclipsed all manner of shape and size and kind of object. There had to be at least twenty gifts from people Draco immediately knew, not including the few he’d gotten for himself. But Harry wouldn’t put it past the Malfoy family’s more distant connections making it well up to fifty.
Slughorn’s and any other humans’ opinions about him shouldn’t matter to him. And yet they did. To the point he felt
year, Harry.” Draco shook his head at him. Turning away, he resituated the bejeweled chandelier (a gift from his parents) for the tenth time in one minute. “The dragon has moved on from that arrangement.”
Like every other year before, Draco’s comfortable warmth in his dragon hide lulled Harry to sleep swiftly. He almost didn’t want to yet, filled with the same sort of deep calm he associated with a cloudy King’s Cross Station and a familiar old face with twinkling blue eyes offering him a choice. Harry couldn’t be happier with his decision.
And when Draco would turn that expression fully on him, it was this moment that Draco always seemed the most foreign. Someone else altogether. It was an expression Harry had seen before elsewhere, and never wanted to see again. More reptile than human, too much like... a man that once went by ‘Riddle’.
Draco’s confusion mounted as his mind reeled. Harry’s being human had never mattered to Draco’s consideration of him as a mate, except figuring out how to navigate human mating differences. And so Draco never thought about if it would be an issue for Harry. And now he was learning it
It was those moments where one could both hate and love something at once… that glorious heart-stealing stage, a window to freedom, to what could be if he really had all those wizards at his mercy. To him, those lights and attention were a curse as much as a temptation. Draco had to believe some of the other creatures there experienced a similar compulsion to be seen
Further into the morning, as he lay on the floor outside his tank, still singing—wanting to never stop, the door opened with a bang.
At the time, Draco’s, or rather, the dragon’s restlessness had been as contagious as Dragon Pox. And Harry hadn’t seen the point in staying put if it wasn’t his final placement anyway.
The roaring excitement of being in the water with Harry for the first time, smelling him so intensely, and
In a place only the two of them knew... protected by a beast that one of them was... surrounded by a sea of wealth and fire-breathing scales... the security of possessions and physical shelter let the dragon and Draco relax. And Harry felt more protected than he ever had before with a dragon snoozing in his lap.
Before he could analyze it much further, Harry lightly but more insistently pushed at his shoulders.
He still remembered the first days when he used to come on stage singing his heart out, hopeful and desperately wishing someone would be moved enough by his voice to rescue him. But of course, even if they could have understood his song’s pleas, the kinds of humans that attend these sorts of things had no such interests except to enslave him for themselves. He was better off where he was.
"Yeah, well your little friends and you gave me this!" Barton snarled, pointing to a small scar just underneath his eye. "It was a prank and it was meant to be for my dear brother, if you weren't so stuck up, showing off your prefects badge and trying to take away house points, then that wouldn't have happened!" Sirius huffed as if they had had this arguments many times before.
"He did," Harry smiled. "He convinced me that he was telling the truth. Draco really was under the imperius curse."
Harry went back into his dorm room and got changed. He headed into the common room and saw students leaving for breakfast. Ron and Hermione came out of their room and Hermione threw a apologetic look at Harry. "Ron, will you please apologise to him?" she whispered. Ron just rolled his eyes and stepped out of the portrait.
Harry quickly shut the door and walked into the next stall. He stripped and turned the water on. He watched as his glamour faded away. He deserved every punch, kick and slap that he got. He deserved every scar that he got. Yet, he just couldn't stay dead. He got out of the shower, wrapped his towel around his waist and stood in front of the mirror. It appeared that he other boy hadn't got out of the shower yet.
"Next Saturday? That's two hours before Sirius's trial!" Harry groaned. "If they discover the truth and I'm put in Azkaban, I won't be able to speak for him!"
"I've been checking the Daily Prophet every day as well as Witch Weekly and even the Quibbler, but there haven't even been any sightings. To be honest with you Harry, I thought that you had forgot and I would have preferred it that way. I don't want my worries to be yours too!"
Remus Lupin drifted through the wall quite suddenly with Tonks following behind him. "You have to come back now. You know your time on earth is limited." He sighed with a frown. "Hello, cousin!" Tonks grinned mischievously at Draco.
Carved into the wall were the words 'Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs- together until humanity ends.' Harry looked to see Sirius wiping away a tear. Without thinking, Harry wrapped him in a hug and knew that his Dad was thanking him, wherever he was, for giving his best friend the comfort he needed.
"Sorry, he's really drunk!" Hermione exclaimed, jumping up. "Whaaaaatt? No I'm not, stop being a silly potato you bushy haired... Thing!" Harry laughed, almost toppling over before Ginny got up and caught him. "Ginnyyyy!" Harry gasped. "You were my girlfriend!"
They all settled down and promised not to tell anyone what happened. There was no point. Harry was released from the hospital wing a week later and as soon as he got into the eighth year tower, he locked himself in his dorm room to avoid questions. But instead of seeing the rest of his year, Harry was now face to face with the Weasley's.
"This is Potter leaning against a tree, Skeeter. Unless you would like to inform us that this boy is having romantic relations with a tree then I am going to have to ask you to sit back down!" Pulse groaned, clearly frustrated with Skeeter's patheticness. Rita sat back down, glaring daggers at Harry who just shrugged and smiled innocently.
Draco got out his wand and pointed it at Harry, who didn't even as much as bat an eyelid. 'Do it!' Pansy's voice screeched. "I need to kill you, Potter." Draco growled. Harry opened up his arms as if to welcome the spell like an old friend. But then another voice came inside his head.
"Top or bottom? But we don't have a bunk bed?" Harry asked confused, and saw eyes widen all around him. "Do we tell him?" Ron asked. "Tell me what?" Harry said, baffled. "Don't worry Golden boy, I'll explain when we get a bunk bed." Draco smirked and Harry just shrugged it off.
"I think I'd prefer it if you were closer." Harry mumbled and Draco's body pressed up against his. Just when they were about to share their kiss, Harry switched their places so now Draco was up against the wall. "Aren't you forgetting?" Harry said, smirking. "I'm the guy in this relationship!"
Harry was walking around the school corridors by himself, after saying bye to Draco who was going to the Slytherin common room to collect some old things. Harry turned the corner and stopped in his tracks.
"Speaking of mum and dad, have you seen them?" Harry asked as they made their way back to the crowd. "Actually, yeah. James popped up for a mere few seconds and told me that they had used most of their time and that they would not be able to visit for quite a long while. They're still watching over us though, Harry." Sirius smiled sadly.
Harry started to tear up, the shouting starting to freak him out a bit. Draco didn't seem to notice and carried on screaming in Harry's face. He only stopped when tears were freely pouring from Harry's face into the sink. Harry ran out into the dorm and quickly pulled on his pyjamas. He crawled into bed and squeezed his eyes shut tight.
Sirius eventually brought Harry back into the office and they sat down, wiping away leftover tears. Sirius then got something out of a small bag and handed it to Harry. It was a small picture frame and a necklace of gold ribbon.
Harry stood on the spot, shocked, wand still in hand. He slowly started to walk back up to number 4, reliving the events that just occurred. He climbed back up to his room and lay on the bed. Tomorrow, Harry would be going back to Hogwarts, away from the Dursley's once again. He was dreading it but excited at the same time.
"I- what? Hermione, who are they?" Ron said seriously. "Very funny, Ron. You can stop with the joke now, Jacob and Alex have been our friends since God knows when?" Hermione giggled, catching on.
It was clear he was unconscious, making it harder for Draco to bring him back over into their room. "Oh my gosh, Potter!" McGonagoll shouted, running into the room with Madame Pomfrey, Luna and a stretcher behind her. McGonagall got out her wand  and helped Draco carefully put Harry's fragile body on the stretcher. He was bleeding from his head where he must've hit it on something when he jumped.
"Said yes." Harry smiled and watched as Hermione's face turned from utter confusion to pure glee. Harry almost fell off his chair when Hermione practically threw herself into him, engulfing him in hugs and squeals. Harry looked out the corner of his eye and saw Draco sitting at the next table, a smirk resting on his face.
Draco spun the bottle which landed on Dean who picked truth. He admitted that he actually does love Quidditch more than football. Dean spun the bottle which landed on Hermione, who also picked truth. "I don't like doing dares!" She complained. Hermione spun the bottle which landed on Draco again, who picked dare and he spun it and it, thankfully for him, landed on Harry.
McGonagall was confused by Harry's physical state. "I just don't understand, he's looked perfectly fine since he arrived at Hogwarts last month! Now he looks beaten, and thin as a stick. Oh, my poor boy!" She sniffed, fiddling with the necklace around her neck.
"Well, let's try now," Harry smiled. Draco picked up his wand and he and Harry stood up. "Think of your happiest memory then say the incantation 'Expecto Patronum'. It's alright if you don't get it first try, that's completely normal." Draco closed his eyes and concentrated. "Expecto Patronum!" He stated and a small silver whisp came out the end of his wand like some deformed fog.
"Harry! You do realise you are talking to a mass murderer?" Draco chocked. "Wait, you don't know? There was a reason Wormtail, Peter Pettigrew, was alive and serving Voldemort in Malfoy Manor you know," Harry started. Draco spun to face Harry but never lowered his arm from Sirius. "He framed Sirius for all those murders, ratted my parents out and had them killed! Then he faked his own death once he heard of his master's downfall like the fucking coward he was! He left Sirius to take the blame and I grew up without my Godfather, without my family and it's all his FAULT!" Harry spat, now shouting in fury.
"Hufflepuff." Harry chuckled, nudging into the side of Draco as they made their way through the portrait and into the eighth year common room. They headed towards where Ron and Hermione were sat, cuddled up and playing a game of wizards chess. It was obvious that Hermione was losing and Ron was trying hard not to rub it in her face.
"Trouble is my middle name. And Sirius is my first!" Harry rolled his eyes at his Godfathers childishness, but had the urge to tell him the truth. "So... you know how I said Ginny and I are a thing? Well, we're not. And that's because, um... I feel how you felt with Remus, except all the time. Obviously, not with Remus, not that I don't think he's nice, but I would never... Like a Dad, you know and uh, get what I mean?" Harry said quickly, holding his breath.
"Ronald! I cannot believe you would say something like that! Gay or not, they are humans!" Hermione shrieked. "Mione, we do things different in the wizarding world. I know most of you muggles and that think it's ok in your world, but here it's not. You just have to live with it." Hermione cast Harry a curious glance, then got up and stormed out. "What's got her knickers in a twist?" Ron asked, completely oblivious to what he had just done.
"Who are the first two?" Harry asked. "Your Mum and Dad." Sirius replied. Harry thought for a moment then sighed. "I'd love to Padfoot, but I don't know whether or not they would believe me. Like you said, a couple of days before my trial- with their suspicions of me, I don't know whether they would take into account anything I say."
He burst out into fits of giggles, clutching his stomach and soon wiping his eyes of stray tears. "W-what? What is it?" Harry asked nervously. "You seriously have to ask after everything? I'm practically already your boyfriend you dungbomb!" Draco chuckled and grinned. "Yeah but I want to hear you say it," Harry whispered cheekily. "I, Draco Malfoy, am Harry Potter's one and only until we may part ways, most likely in death." Draco smiled and Harry blushed.
"I'm so proud of the man you have become today, Harry. I know you've had a lot of stumbles on the way, but you know what? Having those dips in the road are what makes us human, you just had to go through a bit more than your ordinary Tom, Dick or Stanley. But, I am so proud of you." James said with an honest smile. "It's hard sometimes, you know? I've had to grow up my whole life without parents and now suddenly you're here, but you're not. You only have limited amount of times as ghosts and you won't be able to come every time I call. I only wish I could hug you for the first time and that isn't possible. I crave that attention and affection I never got as a child but I know I can never get it." Harry sniffled and turned away, wiping his watering eyes.
"It's all great and all, but she's always with Neville, pretending to date him. She spends more time in the eighth year common room than she does in here, where she actually lives! The Ravenclaw tower hasn't been fully repaired yet, so they are staying here for our last year," She sighed, exasperated. "Well, how about you come into the common room with me so you can spend time with her?" Harry asked. Harry had only just realised how much time Luna had spent in the eighth year tower.
The Weasley's left the room, apart from George who stayed sitting on Harry's bed. This would be it. The moment that George lashed out at Harry and blamed him of murdering his twin, just like he did in Harry's dreams.
"Harry, Harry! Hermione said that-" Ron stopped mid sentence, frozen at the sight of James and Lily Potter. "You!" Lily gasped and in and instant was cornering Ron making a face that would scare dementors. "You little unaccepting brat, you absolutely foul... ugh! How dare you-"
One sleepless night was followed by another, then another, until Harry couldn't physically do anything. It's not like the Dursley's helped. They just made him work and would only let him drink, no eating as Vernon had promised. On Harry's 5th night at Privet Drive he finally managed to sleep, but woke up soon, sweat running down his forehead after the first nightmare he would have out of hundreds.
If Harry had just died as a baby, none of them would be dead. Lily and James may as well have just given Harry to Voldemort when he came that night, and carried on with their lives.
Harry was now 'Jacob Evans'. The two boys had come up with some names for themselves in case anyone asked who they were. Draco was 'Alex Black'. At least,  Alex was a unisex name, so he would pass as a girl if he had to introduce himself to anyone.
"Watch it Potter! That'll be five points from Gryffindor for talking back! Ten points from Gryffindor and Slytherin for the disgusting cuddling!" Barton snapped. Draco pulled Harry closer to him which practically made Barton gag.
"Now, this counter curse..." Barton carried on talking but Ron and Hermione were whispering hurriedly. "Do you think anybody suspected them?" Ron whispered. "I don't think so. Anybody would have stopped Barton but Malfoy got there first." Hermione replied but the worried expression etched on her face spoke otherwise.
"Well, it's more like I have something to show you." He grinned and then with a pop, he wasn't there anymore. Where Draco had just sat, stood a pure white wolf, blue-grey eyes twinkling in the moonlighting.
"Why? Is Hermione really driving you that mad?" Harry smiled weakly, opening his eyes further, only to see blurry dots. But, he could tell as Draco's eyes widened and his face split into a grin that seemed to reach from ear to ear.
Harry cupped Draco's face, attempting to become more dominant in the kiss, but failed when Draco climbed onto Harry's lap, straddling him and then taking control. "You cheeky bastard," Harry grinned. "Who told you you could stop kissing me?" Draco smirked. "I did," a voice came from the doorway. Ron.
"Too soon for jokes? Okay." He smiled. Hermione and Ginny sighed, relieved that Harry was up and talking. Harry looked up and saw Draco looking at him in a kind of awe. "What, what is it?" He asked. "You made a joke! Sure, it wasn't appropriate for the time, but it's still progress!" Draco grinned childishly. "Oh!" Harry said, blushing.
Harry's head snapped up. "What, what do you mean?" Sirius sighed and his eyes twinkled with sadness. "Your father went through something similar to you, Harry. In our fifth year I think it was, he got diagnosed with an illness and kept it all hidden. He only said anything when we found some medical potions and stuff in his trunk but then, he just said that he had an interest in those things and back then we believed him."
Draco jumped off Harry and grabbed the chair, holding it up whilst Harry just sat there, not quite fully taking in what was happening. "Merlin, it's just you two. You gave me a heart attack!" Malfoy sighed, but Hermione had already rushed up to Harry.
He took Harry's hand and placed it under the running tap, washing the cut. He grabbed the first aid kit from under the sink and wrapped some dressing and bandages around both of Harry's wounds. Harry was silently questioning why Draco wasn't just using magic, but the look of concentration on his face was cute, or so Harry thought.
They walked along side the Black Lake and sat under a small cave Harry had no idea was there. "How long has this been here?" Harry asked, lying down on his back, his head poking out of the cave entrance so he could still see the stars. Draco copied his actions and lay down just like Harry had.
"So, Potter. New evidence of your homosexuality eh? I wonder where that came from. Shame your face wasn't in it too Malfoy else you could have kept your father's empty cell company! I'm sure Potter here would have a cell exactly like it, just way on the other side of Azkaban!" He chuckled cruelly. "You really think that they would lock Harry up in a cell after he defeated your master?" Draco scoffed.
"Harry! If your Mum and Dad just 'handed you over' then they would just be living in a world of fear for the rest of their lives and would have sooner been dead anyway because nobody would be there to take down Voldemort. Also, we wouldn't have this brilliant wizard standing here today." Sirius said, sternly but softly.
"YOU ARE SPEAKING OUT OF BOUNDS POTTER!" Fudge roared and the room went dead silent. "You are going to Azkaban and you are going to rot in there-"
"Come with me," Harry whispered suddenly. "What?" Petunia spat again. "Come with me, just for a minute. I have something to show you." Harry stepped forward and held out his arm. "Petunia, don't, I'm warning you!" Vernon snarled, but she still grabbed Harry's outstretched arm. Draco quickly slipped his arm around Harry's waist and they were whisked away. They re-appeared on the doorstep of a large, dark house and Harry flung open the door and pulled the other two inside.
"Oh, emerald," Draco smiled and squeezed his dark haired boyfriend into a hug. "I'm so happy to be with you. You're all I need in this life and the next." The two boys said no more but understood perfectly what the other was trying to say.
Harry lay down in his bed, hoping for sleep to come but it never did. Harry spent all night, painfully tossing and turning, but couldn't get the images of death and destruction out of his mind. He so badly wanted to talk to Ron or Hermione, but they probably hated him by now. All the Weasley's probably hated him. You killed Fred. He thought to himself.
"Is that your Halloween costume Harry? For the party?" He asked. "What, what party?" Harry asked. "You know, the big halloween party everyone has been talking about on Halloween," Harry must've not been listening to whatever teacher told them. "Right, that party. Uh, yeah I'm trying this out. What do you think?" He asked.
WARNING: Bad language, Abuse, Eating Disorders, Depression, Suicide Attempt, Homophobia (Things get better).
"It's okay. I would do it again and again. He means the world to me!" Draco smiled, regaining his good Malfoy posture. "We know." Mr Potter smiled. The two boys sat opposite the ghosts on Draco's bed, whilst they were sat on Harry's.
Harry, Hermione and Ron had first period off together, but Harry dragged Hermione off to the library when Ron started speaking to Neville, to discuss his plan with her. "Hermione, I've had an idea of how I can take Draco to the party," he whispered, making sure no one was listening in.
"Harry, why are you with her, why have you brought me here?" Lily said coldly, turning to her son. "Do you remember?" Harry asked calmly. "I know you know what I'm talking about." Lily stared at him intently until she gave up and heaved a big sigh. "Yes, I heard. She was a witch. I don't care, doesn't change anything she did." She sniffed. "I know that everything that happened to Harry was wrong, but I believed that you had ruined my whole life. You were Lily, the perfect daughter, the pretty one, the popular one. I was petty Petunia. I didn't have friends, I wanted to go back to Hogwarts but Dumbledore wouldn't return my letters. So, I grew to hate it all."
But this was the law! "It doesn't matter if it's the law," George groaned at him, head in his hands. "It doesn't matter because he is your best friend and one small thing like this shouldn't be enough for you to completely throw your friendship with him away!"
"Why did you save me Draco?" Harry whispered."Huh?" Draco gasped, taken aback by the sudden question. "Why did you save me?" Harry repeated, louder this time.
Just as he thought this, Madame Pomfrey came in and headed straight for him. "Glad to see you're eating Mr Potter," she smiled and gave Harry all his daily potions. He swallowed the disgusting ones first, just like he always did and gulped the decent ones last.
MOST CHARACTERS AND SETTINGS AND THINGS BELONG TO J.K. ROWLING (However if you support her views and shit please go away <3)
Luna spun the bottle and it landed on Dean. "Truth or dare," she asked innocently. "Dare!" He grinned. "I dare you to tell the truth!" Luna said, her stare suddenly become harsh and stern. "You are, completely, 100% over Ginny? No running after her telling her your life is incomplete without her?"
Draco spun the bottle and it landed on Ginny. "Truth or dare," He smiled, casually taking a shot of vodka. "Dare!" Ginny smiled. "I dare you to go and get Luna and make her join in the game," Draco smiled. He knew that Ginny felt lonely, being the only one not drinking, so now she could have Luna.
"Hello Duddeykins! Smelling of alcohol and tobacco per usual," Harry said calmly and the boy punched him in the ribs. Draco whipped out his wand and pointed it at the family. "Hi, my name is Draco Malfoy and I'm your nephews boyfriend. We met at school and now we share a dorm room! You know, he's told me all about you and quite frankly, I am not impressed." The large man- Harry's uncle most likely, stared at Draco's outstretched wand arm in fear as if he had just seen a horrible and gruesome murder occur.
"Hermione, what's going on?" Ron whispered in a panicky tone. "It's Harry and Draco. They're playing as Jacob Evans and Alex Black. It's how they can be together in public." Hermione whispered back as the boys pulled apart.
She turned to a marked page in the book and her eyes started to scan the page, silently reading. "Is this normal?" Draco whispered to Harry. "Pretty much. Though, she's never tried to punch me and Ron!" Harry laughed and Draco flicked his ear. Hermione gasped and then giggled excitedly. "What?" Harry asked impatiently. "Let me see your wrists, both of you!" She said, but before either of them could even choose to comply, she grabbed Harry's arm and pointed her wand to it, ignoring the scars and muttering some words in latin.
"Since before we came to school. Severus used to come and hide here from the bullies, showed me the spot when I complained about not having anywhere remotely private to do my study and thinking," Draco explained. "He never told me the names of the bullies but I said that if I ever found out who they were then I would beat them to the ground!" Draco chuckled, but Harry gulped.
"Harry, you can talk to me you know, what's going on?" She asked, placing a comforting hand on his. Well, if Malfoy didn't run away, why would Hermione? "I've had some... issues, after the war. I couldn't help but blame myself for everything that happened, I couldn't even bring myself to look at the Weasley's," he sighed. "I sort of became a bit... depressed, I suppose. And when I went back to Privet Drive, it didn't help." Hermione looked at Harry, comfortingly. So far so good.
Harry felt his heart drop. He was planning on doing something special for Draco on Tuesday night, just to say thank you for everything. Now, he would have to change it to Wednesday night after Quidditch practise.
"That's because we aren't together, Pansy. We never were. And I'm already a lot happier with these friends than I ever was with you, you ugly bitch!" Draco sneered, and she slapped him clean across the face.
"Your an animagus?" Harry gasped and Draco the wolf barked. Hesitantly, Harry brought his hand up and started to tickle the wolf behind his ears. Draco looked shocked at first, but then melted into it, his tail starting to wag like a dog's showing Harry that he was enjoying it. He licked Harry's cheek and nipped his ear.
"I- I don't really know how to explain... So I'm just going to say it in Mauraders language if you will. I... Like my girls like I like my coffee," Harry said, sharing a small smile.
"You're right, Hermione. This is nice. We don't have to be afraid anymore he's gone." Ron smiled. But Harry was. Afraid that he would lose someone else, afraid that no one would forgiven, afraid that he could never look Mrs Weasley in the eye again. "I, um, have to go now. I'm a bit tired," Harry lied, forcing a smile. "Alright, have a good nights sleep mate," Ron said. "Doubt it," Harry mumbled as he reached the door. "What was that Harry?" Hermione asked. "Nothing. I just said 'you too'." He replied, then walked away.
"A bit late, Potter," Draco whispered as Barton turned around to write notes on the chalkboard. Harry looked at Draco and studied his face, his smile. He had a cute dimple where his smirk went up and perfect plush lips. "You done staring, Potter?" He asked, his smirk growing larger. Harry looked down at his desk as he blushed. "Shove off, Malfoy. We all know you're a little faggot." Ron snapped. Harry drew his head up quickly and looked at Ron confused. "Wait, what?"
"Two were already destroyed by the time we started in sixth year and then at the end, Dumbledore and I found the locket. But it was a fake. Your brother Regulus had found the real one and ordered Kreacher to destroy it. He died good Sirius. He did it to protect you." Harry smiled sadly.
"But Professor, you aren't allowed to do that! It's illegal!" Hermione gasped. "I'm aware of that Miss Granger, I am the Professor here. Which also means I know a way of doing it without causing too much pain. It's all for the greater good." He smirked then turned his glare towards Harry. "Mr Potter, would you be so kind as to join me up here?"
Without thinking, Harry leaned in and kissed the boy, a warm feeling filling him, the same as when he had taken his first sip of butterbeer. They kissed for a while, nothing but pure innocence, when Draco took it to the next stage.
Harry, Ron and Hermione walked down to breakfast together the next morning, to find that an extra, shorter table had been added to the hall. "It's for the 8th years," Hermione said, walking forwards. "And how do you know that?" Ron asked. "There was a sign on the door, Ronald. If you had taken your eyes off of the food, then maybe you would've noticed."
"We lost Fred too. Fred's gone." Harry whispered. Sirius's eyes welled with tears as he whispered "I'm so sorry I wasn't here Harry. I tried to get out, I really did but I couldn't. I could've helped!"
Once again, Harry slowly opened his eyes, just a little bit. Was he dead yet? Is this what heaven felt like? Because it sure hurt. Then he heard voices, or, one voice. "I think you can hear me Harry. Please wake up. I need you here! I need you to be able to stand by my side, and I'm not breaking my promise now I'm going to do everything in my power to help you back onto your feet again. Please Harry, I can't face this all alone. I need you."
They joined Seamus and Dean at the very end of the eighth year table, closest to the door and furthest away from the rest of the students. For once, Draco felt lucky that nobody wanted to sit next to him so they all had space.
"Oh, Potter. Mind if I sit? Everywhere else is full." Malfoy asked. Harry slowly nodded his head. He knew that the blonde boy in front of him was forced into getting the dark mark. Harry saw the look on his face the night he was on the astronomy tower. He didn't belong with the others. His thoughts were finalised when Malfoy didn't out him when they were in Malfoy Manor after being caught by the snatchers.
Draco shook his head, slowly. "You can't. Father will find out all your secrets and use them against you. He did it to me. He said I either get the dark mark or he tells the minister all about 'the horrid curse my son has been put under'. It's not like it made a difference I would have got it either way." He sighed, rubbing at his left arm.
"But then Cho Chang kissed you, didn't she Harry! Under the mistletoe!" Seamus chuckled. "Uh, right... Cho Chang. I'm not doing a whole song by the way, I'm not that good." Harry shared eye contact with Draco for a couple of seconds before diverting his attention to his guitar.

"I'll go and look for him elsewhere then, leave you to do... Whatever it is you're doing." Ron scoffed at the scene before him, Draco Malfoy cuddling a wolf! How pathetic. He walked away up to the castle and out of sight.
Ginny threw the door open, ran in and hugged Neville. Harry watched from the doorway, amused. "Thank you for being so understanding, Neville. If you ever need anything, then don't hesitate to ask," Ginny smiled. "Well, I think I'm going to be needing a date to the party," he chuckled as the two girls shared a small kiss.
Sirius was looking at him worriedly as he opened his eyes. "Thank you." Harry muttered, embarrassed that his Godfather had to witness one of his panic attacks. "What happened?" Sirius asked soothingly. "I- I was just thinking about the parents I never had. Another life, where I wasn't famous and I grew up with my parents just as a normal boy should have. Maybe another Potter could've had what I didn't if Mum and Dad just handed me over."
Draco pulled away and whispered "Enough for you yet Potter?" Harry grinned innocently and placed his hands on the sides of Draco's face and pushed him back into the kiss that he longed for.
"I've told you before now I'm going to tell you again. I am going to help you get better. Even if it takes months, weeks, years, I'll always be here to help you," Draco smiled. "I promise."
"Draco!" Harry giggled. "Truth or dare?" Draco thought for a moment then smirked. "Truth." He replied. "BORING!" Seamus shouted.
A man came running out of a room and when he saw his godson, breathed a sigh of relief. But then Sirius stiffened up again as he saw the woman looking around the dark and dirty house with a look of illness and distaste upon her face. "Why have you brought her into my home?" Sirius spat as they all went into the living room. "I needed a private place." Harry said so firmly that Sirius did not even bother question it right then. "Uh, come Draco, I need to have some words with you." He said hastily and the other two men left, leaving Harry and Petunia in the large room, alone.
"What're you going to do Harry?" Luna asked, worry etched into her voice. "What I do best." Harry replied, shrugging.
'No, get off me you bitch!' He wanted to scream but alas, he was still stuck under the spell, so he had no choice but to follow. Pansy had turned Draco into her bitch, so when Harry Potter approached them at breakfast, she got extremely pissed off.
"Yeah, yeah it did." Harry replied sadly, staring dumbly down at his hands. "I have an idea!" Draco grinned, grabbing Harry's hands and smirking. He then grabbed his wand and changed himself into Alex Black and Harry into Jacob Evans. "Let's go and have some fun." He grinned at Harry's confusion, and just lead him out of their room and sat down with Ron and Hermione.
"Dear Mr Potter, we have just received more evidence that you may be under the curse of the homosexuals and have decided to move your trial to the next Saturday at nine a.m. Looking forward to it, Leonara Pulse."
Harry turned around to see Draco still with no top on, but with his trousers on at least. Harry blushed again at his bare chested boyfriend and Hermione rolled her eyes at the pair. They moved into the bedroom and sat down on one of the beds.
It suddenly flew up again. It was a ministry letter. The wax seal opened like a mouth and words started tumbling out, directed towards Harry. 'Dear Mr Potter. We, at the ministry, have been given an anonymous tip that you may be under the curse of the homosexuals. We would like to invite you into the Department of Mysteries on the 21st of December for a trial. We look forward to seeing you, Leonara Pulse, department of control of the cursed and disgraced."
Then, Harry burst out laughing and Mr Potter did too. Draco was the one looking shocked now. "You- you seriously thought that? Oh!" Harry laughed, clutching his stomach. "Come on now, I would never treat my son like that, or you! We've seen all you've done for Harry and we wanted to thank you. That little outburst just proved our point." Mr Potter grinned and Mrs Potter nodded along, smiling.
"What do you mean? Should I know you?" Ron asked. "C'mon, Ron, you have to be kidding. We've been best friends for years! How else would I know you can only sleep with your teddy bear and you wet the bed until you were seven?" Harry said with a smirk and Draco had to stifle a he burst of laughter with a coughing fit.
"Says the one who asked to join in!" The two boys laughed together as if nothing had ever changed and Harry blushed. "Quite majestic if I do say so myself," Harry grinned as they finished.
Harry rolled his eyes and stormed out after Hermione. "Why did you want to know, Harry?" She asked as they headed to the library. "Don't tell anyone, but I saw Dean and Seamus kiss last night. I think they were drunk, but it was still there."
Morning dawned, and Harry was still in the common room. He had been sitting on the sofa in the far corner for three hours now, and didn't expect anyone to be up any time soon. None the less, Harry tip toed back into his dorm room and hopped in the shower. He hastily got out, not liking the feeling of the water hitting his ruined skin. He wrapped the towel round his waist and walked over to the sink and mirror. He frowned at himself as he ran his fingers over his ribs. "You can do something about that you know," Draco said, walking in. Harry quickly put his glamour on, showing how he was before the war.
Draco pulled Harry back down and Hermione and Ginny went back to where they were sitting. "What in the name of Mer*hic*lin was tha*hic*t all about?" Seamus asked. "I have a secret!" Harry whispered excitedly. "I have a boyfriend and his name is Draco Malfoy!" Harry giggled and Draco blushed. They had never called each other boyfriends before.
"I love you, Draco. I always have." Harry smiled sadly and turned back around. He wasn't looking. Wasn't thinking. All he knew was that he could jump. And so he did.
But, as he walked towards room number 7, he couldn't help but wonder what it would be like for two boys to kiss. Would it just be like kissing a girl? Or would it be more gentle, more rough? Harry walked straight into the bathroom, thoughts still roaming around his head. He opened the shower door and heard a shout that knocked him out of his thoughts.
"But it was Malfoy!" Ron spat. "He's changed, Ron. I could tell in the couple of hours I spent with them, he is head over heels for Harry. If he ever did anything to Harry, then mark my words we would pummel him right into hell and then further down, but you haven't seen them when they're together, Ron. They're pretty much in love."
"It's just a bit ironic, really!" Harry grinned and when Draco tilted his head to the side, Harry turned with a pop into a black wolf with sparkling green eyes, a lightning scar barely visible on its forehead, only to be seen if you moved fur out the way. Draco started barking madly and Harry grinned, baring sharp teeth. Draco changed back and it turned out he was laughing.
Draco finally put the sponge down and wrapped his arms around Harry from the back and put a quick kiss on his head. "What just happened?" George breathed, handing Harry his shirt and robes. Harry quickly slipped them on then looked up at George. His red hair had grown past his ears- or rather just ear and his eyes looked distant.
"You'll be fine Harry. I see the way he looks at you. He's bound to say yes." She beamed and finally managed to push Harry towards the other boy. Harry took one last look back at Hermione then pretended to be interested in some random book next to where Draco was standing.

Ron had been raised to accept everybody, no matter what, but there was a slight twist in his childhood. A boy named Anthony Moore used to come around to the burrow to play with Ron, even though he was Percy's age. He got to Ron at a young age, and Ron grew up listening to two sides of a story, Anthony's and his mother's.
"Ron, what did you mean in defence when you said Malfoy was a fa- uh, you know?" Harry asked, wondering if Ron knew something or was just throwing it as an insult. "I heard my Dad talking about it to my mum. Apparently, Lucius Malfoy was trying to clear Draco from the Malfoy name after he found out he was gay, but he wanted to keep it quiet. I'm not surprised either. If it was me, I'd just take my child straight to Azkaban." He laughed.
"Thank you Harry. Maybe now we actually stand a chance!" Ginny laughed. Harry pressed his ear up to the door to try and listen in on the conversation. "Well, that's the situation," came Luna's voice. There was a silence for a little bit then he heard Neville laugh.
"How will I know? I'm so confused Draco, I don't know what to think," Harry sighed, furrowing his brows. "I know something that might help." Draco smirked and before Harry could say anything, he felt a soft pair of lips on his. It was strange at first, he wasn't used to it, but then he slowly melted into it, their lips moving in sync.

Draco Malfoy stood there, looking at a tear stricken Harry across from... mass murderer Sirius Black. "Get back, get away from him!" Draco shouted, instantly shielding Harry from his Godfather with his wand out.
The news of Harry's trial and his confession had spread around like wildfire and witches and wizards all swarmed around him once a short, stumpy wizard in deep crimson robes called out "It's Harry Potter!"
Malfoy had run away. Harry knew it, after all who would want to share a room with a horrible creature like him. Malfoy was going to tell McGonagoll and he would be kicked out of Hogwarts, for sure. For killing all of them. Harry heard the door open and looked up. Malfoy had come in, a worried look on his face.
As Draco finally reached Harry and snatched the paper out of his hands, reading it like a mad man, Cornelius Fudge the current Minister for Magic came running out of the castle with ministry officials after him. "Harry James Potter, you are under arrest for being one of those under the curse of the homosexuals!" He cried.
Yet nowhere felt safer than by the side of a lethal creature that could kill him with one flaming exhale.
“I’m going to need help.” Her wand pointed suddenly and a silvery creature Draco had never seen before came out the end. “Madame Pomphrey, the patient is relapsing into fever.” The animal disappeared and then she turned her attention back on them.
All faces turned their attention toward him, Hermione with disbelief, and Harry, with something like hope that matched Draco’s own.
“Name’s Charlie.” He stuck out his hand toward Draco, who shook it back after taking a moment to remember seeing Slughorn shake people’s hands like that before. Otherwise, he’d have just stared stupidly at it.
Discreetly, Draco grabbed a fish himself, and then presented it to Harry to eat it in the same manner he did for Draco.
“I’m sorry, but it’s time for me to go.” His hands were firm but gentle as he guided Draco off him. Draco was too stunned with his own body’s responses to the touch. As he the final piece came together why his reactions to Harry’s touches had always been more intense and robbing him of sense than Luna’s had been.
“So you’re saying it’s permanently just coming and going? So hot that his brain melts?” Harry asked, sounding frustrated. “How’s any of that natural?”
Draco noticed the doors opening behind her again where Slughorn and Harry had disappeared—only for two men in red robes the same as Harry’s to enter the room instead. Draco began to panic as they came up to them and stood by on either side of Luna, who still hadn’t turned away from him.
When he looked back up to her, the panicking, protective part of him ready to drag her into the water with him, she gave him one last marvel: her expression being minutely sad. And it floored him completely into inaction for that moment.
Harry’s absolute bafflement where the man was typically more stoic only added to Draco’s enjoyment of his relentless physical engagement with Harry.
Draco spun in a circle to find the best position, somehow avoiding harming or dislodging Harry in the process. A good thing, since Harry considered his own place to stand rather precarious.
Draco reached for him, almost beseechingly, as the heat worsened. Harry noticed, and stood next to him again as Draco clung to his front, breathing more and more laboured by each second.
Straining his ears he was able to pick up the noises of people walking by his door, but the footsteps passed it. There was no sign of Harry and anyone else, except the remainder of Harry’s scent in a chair pulled out next to him. Proof that Harry had been there some time ago.
“She was right,” Harry said thoughtfully, letting his head fall back and stare up at the sky. Draco glanced at him curiously.
For a moment Draco had the desire to attack him just because he could defend himself. He finally had the option with his newly freed voice, and he wanted to use it. But just as easily as he thought it, it passed.
“Why not?” Harry asked. They were closer to the exit now. Draco considered keeping silent, but the cocktail of anxiety and residual humiliation loosened his tongue.
“I think you’d like something that’s got a lot of different stuff every day. I don’t know if you’d be satisfied knowing a lot about one area,” Theo said. “Is there something like that?”
The last log collapsed into the pyre with a spray of sparks. Draco wiped the few tears that had slipped out.
“We’ve cycled through two standard Potter topics in five minutes. What were you thinking next? Perhaps,
“If you ever say another sentence to me with the words “dead sexy” and “Draco Malfoy” in it I’ll have you committed,” Ron said, after listening to Harry’s directionless ramble.
Eighteen, traumatised, tired. He slept with Draco for the first time shortly after the trials, and to this day couldn’t tell you who started it, just that it ended in a filthy nightclub bathroom stall with Draco’s hand down his jeans. It was the first time he had felt good for months, even with Draco smirking at him like he had learned a secret. Harry slept with him again, because he had wondered if their sex was as good as he remembered. It was. Then they were at it regularly, and Draco ticked off all of his firsts, even though Harry never told him. He had never asked.
“Are you going to fuck me or not?” Harry says. He wanted it to come out playful but it comes out desperate. They press their lips against each other's necks, breathing heavily.
His father summoned and handed him three vials of a headache potion. “Extra strength, just in case. One drop or three.”
It starts to pour rain in thick sheets, and there’s good-natured laughing as people dash indoors from the terrace. Now the party actually is too crowded, and people make their way home.
At least, Harry thought Draco was frowning at him, but he could be frowning at the potion that was pouring plumes of marshmallow scented black smoke onto the floor before Draco contained it with a wave of his wand.
She looked tired, Harry finally noticed. Her eyes were unfocused even as she looked at him. She had put two espresso shots in her latte and she had the cinnamon and peppermint breath of someone who had been regularly dosing themselves with Pepper-Up.
“There aren’t any balancing runes, why the fuck would someone do that? Feed it a thimbleful of magic and you’re liable to blow your own face off.”
When the subject turned to Draco, she just said, “It’s for the best, Harry. His experience was different from yours.”
What he liked best about Hermione was that she knew so much, but she never hesitated to share. She never made him feel foolish for not knowing something these days.
. Harry had even signed it the proper way with his family’s ancestral home. The traditions were all mostly rubbish anyway, but someone must have told him the custom. He moved the peace lily to his bedroom. To make sure he watered it, he told himself.
“What horrible evidence have you brought for me this time? A hellhound’s head? Three Dark magic infused slippers? The cursed knickers of my late Aunt Bellatrix?” Draco said as they finished dinner.
“And I owe you a Life Debt. If you’re going to waste my time talking rubbish, get out of my shop,” Draco said. Draco made a pushing motion and Harry found himself on the other side of the glass shop door with Draco waving with a serene expression on the other side.
“Yeah. Thanks.” said Draco. They both heaved a sigh of relief, but Draco was the first to stand, giving Harry a hand up. Sand and grime were smudged all over his shirt and face. Draco remained closer than he had previously, even when he dropped Harry’s hand, and his expression was unreadable.
It was near midnight in the late summer when the time came. A Ministry bell clanged in their living room loudly enough to wake them both in bed. Harry wasn’t in the habit of questioning Draco about his work at all, but as he watched Draco pick up various things around their shared house, he could feel sharp twinges of anxiety in his chest.
Even though the endearment was half-mocking, something warm and steady sparked in his chest. Harry watched him once again.
“I remember what you thought,” Harry says, with a small smile. “Do you...do you miss London?” Harry wonders. He wants to ask,
“Yes, and yes,” Harry said. Then suddenly, Draco was directly in his space, peering at him, tilting Harry's chin down to his chest. Harry glimpsed his Firebird; still, cool and glowing an assertive pink. If this were his Draco, it would be red. But Draco was close nonetheless. This Draco was pressing his hands gently on both sides on the hinge of his jaw and neck. His hands were cool.
Draco was in one of his contemplative, thoughtful moods so he took his time with undressing them both. Harry’s body was broad, solid, golden and had more scars than Draco would have imagined. They were beautiful on him though.
“You are not Maria Carvaggio,” Draco said, dryly. Had Draco’s eyes always been that alluring shade of grey? Since when did he wear glasses?
"Gilead's Theorem?" Draco confirms. The term is meaningless to Harry, but Draco has always been the researcher of their partnership. Healer Ahmed nods.
It seemed hard for him to speak and Draco had white bandages wound around his chest. He gestured for Harry to come closer again until he was pressed against the railing. Harry went to kiss him on the forehead and Draco tilted his head last minute so he caught his lips. Harry tried to keep it gentle but there was a tinge of desperation in making sure Draco was alive and knew how he felt and was here. Draco tasted like awful potions and Harry did not care.
Draco hums tunelessly as they merge onto a bridge. Harry looks at the parallel bridge a little further away, at the shadows the steel girders cast into the car with the setting sun, at the stream of red taillights, at the reflective expanse of water that makes him think he hasn’t yet grasped how far he has come from home.
Harry hadn't yet learned to let someone in. Harry hadn’t learned to say, ‘I want you to stay.' Harry had thought he could tell him without making himself vulnerable or opening the floor to another argument. Instead, he’d tried to make it obvious that last night.
Harry knew he hadn't missed Ginny the way he should. He felt her absence in being alone at home more than he thought about her.
“Did you go looking for me?” Harry asked, softly. It seemed like breaking the stillness of this moment should be more reverent. It felt like he should have more to say than a foolish hope.
“The Firebird he took is an earlier prototype. It isn’t stable. He could seriously hurt himself or get killed by accident. And even unintentional damage could have severe consequences,” Hermione said.
"Don't take this the wrong way, but I can't believe we just did that," Harry says. Draco laughs breathlessly. Harry turns on his side to face Draco. Draco also turns to face him.
Veritaserum only revealed what was top of mind. Draco had used his occlumency to block whatever he could when he arrived, knowing it would eventually come to this. He was left with particular memories. Harry caressing Draco’s temple when he thought he was asleep. The way he’d looked that day in the bookshop.
“Many in the court feel that this is exceptionally lenient considering your crimes. However, we have agreed that reconciliation must mean an effort to re-integrate those lesser criminals involved in the Death Eaters.” Whispers broke out. Lesser meant next to nothing under the circumstances and Draco got the distinct feeling not everyone agreed.
The burial was simple enough. According to his wishes, Lucius was placed in an unlined pine box in the family crypt on the edge of their estate. The symbolic pyre was lit with their wands touching. His mother leaned on him the whole time, clasping his arm for strength.
“Damn you, Harry.” Draco looked away. A stray rock bounced somewhere upstairs with a loud clatter. This Harry’s nerves were so shot, Harry couldn’t flinch.
“Really?” Harry said, so loudly that someone from another table looked over. Harry lowered his voice. “What do you mean?”
. You-Know-Who sounded foolish. He never wanted to call him the Dark Lord again, but he wasn’t about to call him Voldemort either.
Kingsley had encouraged him to take the posting and they had spoken about it at length, but Kingsley had made it known at every turn he was very sorry to have lost Harry.
Draco cut a bite for Harry and turned to him. Harry obediently opened his mouth. After chewing and taking a sip of wine, he turned to Draco.
“No. We were never much good at talking,” Draco says. They had been good at fucking. Good at hurting each other. Good at leaving things unsaid that should have been made clear from the start.
“Thank you, Draco.” Hermione said, she handed Rosie to Ron and unwrapped them. There were a pile of beautifully illustrated muggle children’s books. Hermione couldn’t resist opening them to peek.
“The Statute of Secrecy still applies. If you have any trouble, you may call me. Instructions on using your home phone are in the package. You will check in with me once a week. Make sure you respond to our wellness checks.”
“He’s a patient, Auror Potter,” Mediwitch Routh said. They had an audience too, and he watched Draco turn that lovely shade of pink.
Draco told them both about his plans for his NEWTs and to become a Healer. Neither seemed very surprised. He planned to sit for seven exams since he needed five to give himself a safety net.
There were flowers everywhere. They had coaxed the garden to bloom and multiplied them. All the arrangements had been placed under a stasis spell and arranged in accordance of closeness to the family. Only he and his mother would attend the burial.
Harry went to touch him, to reassure him but Draco sank onto his knees and bowed his head. Draco was shaking. Harry didn’t know what to do. He just didn’t want him to run. Harry knelt next to him. He threaded his fingers in Draco’s hair.
“Malfoy. General Potter,” That was definitely Neville Longbottom. While he wasn’t sure about his mutton chops, there was a more pressing issue. How did Harry address him?
“Were you in the Healer interviews?” Harry asked, turning back. On top of it all, Harry seemed so uncomplicatedly kind. It made Draco want to hide. What was his fucking angle?
“Patient has a chronic magical-immune disease called Servius, ma’am. The ambient magic would be making them ill. The more foreign magic like potions and spells they were exposed to, the more they would deteriorate.”
“Don’t lose your head, Harry,” Kingsley said. He patted him on the back. 46 minutes to go. He went to go find Zacharias and Penny to get briefed and encountered Athena instead.
“If she actually takes after Dorcas, it’ll be a cold day in hell first,” Kingsley said. He laughed a little but it was tinged with sadness.
Draco was exhausted. Between Healer training, writing quick preliminary reports for the Task Force and seeing Harry, he barely caught his breath.
Harry could guess at what happened here. He started all his relationships with a friendship. But then he would have introduced them again at a party or something. Hermione would have only agreed if Harry vouched for him, he thought. Harry was not good with feelings, even his own. He wouldn’t have recognized what it meant when his chest tightened when he saw them together. By the time he would have noticed them circling each other, it would have been too late.
“I’ll apparate you home,” Penny said. She was kind and firm in steering him to their apparition point behind the building and even more so as they landed on the doorstep of 12 Grimmauld Place. Penny cast a Patronus—a dove—that rushed down the street.
“How would that differ from being an informant?” Draco asked. Harry fixed him with a sharp look. Draco had forgotten for a moment that Harry was a trained and highly dangerous professional. Draco guessed being questioned by Harry would be seriously unpleasant.
They end up spending three long days in the Auror’s Ward before they can reverse-engineer all the illegal potions and dissolve the magical bond via a counter-potion that tastes like peppery syrup. They passed the time amicably, like it was a stakeout, with wizarding chess and replays of Quidditch games on the wireless.
“Hermione is your friend, and I can’t hide in your home forever,” Draco said. It seemed a token protest. Harry loved Hermione, but he made his own decisions.
"I thought she would marry me, you know," Harry said after they had stumbled home. It was three in the morning and he was on the melancholy side of drunk, having gradually gotten more sober at the chippy.
Indeed, he appeared to have been lounging around in his pants and acquired a faded Gryffindor t-shirt. Harry stared at it. Maybe he had been sorted into Gryffindor here. Anything was possible.
Harry returned to Hogwarts and forgot about the test in a few short days. Midterms were upcoming and some of his students in the seventh year seminar were already worried about their NEWTs in the spring. In his fifth year of teaching, he finally felt he grasped the rhythms of the school year.
Harry took a page out of his book and  ignored that since Draco didn’t say he wasn’t hungry. Less than fifteen minutes later he had a passable nicoise salad for the both of them.
There was one key fact Harry had forgotten about Draco. He was incredibly enjoyable to rile up. And it was so easy. Harry wasn’t even doing it on purpose.
Neutrality gets that much harder when he climbs the spiralling front staircase to their rooms. The memories flood in unbidden. Here’s a light and a stark reminder that he had been a boy in these halls. The nursery where house-elves had changed his nappies and his parents had sung him lullabies was untouched, as if they had shut it something like twenty years prior and set it in amber. The wainscotting is bright, the wallpaper a tasteful patterned baby blue. His crib is still there, as is the bassinet.
"I'll show you," Draco promises. "But we will go on a date," Draco is letting him go reluctantly, Harry thinks.
“I see. I don’t recall asking you. Any other thoughts?” Kingsley asked. “Would you like to question my judgement some more?”
“I have some questions about the irrigation systems you’ve employed in the southern fields if you’ve got a moment.”
Harry wanted to laugh at Draco’s self-satisfied little smile. Draco stirred a vial with a glass stick and it made a pleasant tinkling sound and turned bright green.
There are two codas I've written in the series. I've reordered them, so the first is an epilogue and the third is Pansy/Theo.
“What do you want me to say to that?” he asked Draco. Hermione was at another table greeting someone.
Even Harry had only had temporary Top Secret clearance for certain missions. He frowned. The rest was about what Harry had expected. He flicked through to see if he could note anything else. This project had begun three years ago, Hermione managed it overall and the other Principal Investigator had been Theodore Nott. Otherwise, there was nothing else interesting. His primary address was a London flat in a posh Mixed Muggle-Wizard neighbourhood. Next of kin listed Pansy Parkinson, address in Naxos, Greece.
There was something about the tilt of his neck that beckoned Harry’s hand, and Harry rested his hand on his cheek. He was taking liberties. But Draco leaned into the touch. He looked at once content and desperate to not have it snatched away.
Draco paused for a long moment. He knew she would let the silence stretch until he ran out the entire hour. In the beginning, he had tried that twice. Almost as a trick, expecting her to chastise him for not taking part and wasting her time. But she sat there quietly with him. She knitted, she told him stories about hikes she’d been on and vacations she hoped to take and sometimes read a book. So he described one. Then another.
Harry started running every other day around Islington. At least he couldn’t get lost there since it was local, and it burned more energy than ambling aimlessly. He fought the temptation to go back to Edmonton Green. Running gave him something to measure. Harry was slow but he had to keep up his conditioning somehow.
“We’re Greengrasses now. No, I mean the sweet tooth. At that age, I ate sugar cubes out of the box.”
Harry doesn’t say a word. He lets Draco pull them out of a tiny enclave of homes, through main streets with large, brightly lit plazas. Draco is comfortable, resting one hand lightly on the steering wheel, drumming his fingertips lightly on the gearshift, like he does this all the time. Harry almost can’t recognise this Draco as the one he knew. Just a bit softer in the face, a few fine lines around the eyes.
He continued to see Blaise a couple times a year when he came to London, but it was nothing serious.
“You look like you’ve seen a ghost,” a voice said. Harry saw the hand on his shoulder and for a second he froze.
“Something like that, yes. I’m trying to find someone,” Harry said. It felt easier to stick close to the truth. Draco made a listening noise, tapping his cigarette on an ashtray balanced on the bannister. It was like Draco was waiting for Harry to ask something in particular, but Harry wasn’t sure what it could be.
They met once a week, sometimes bringing a friend or two as a buffer. It brought out different sides of their personalities. Draco became very quiet around Luna and Neville while Harry became more relaxed. During Blaise and Pansy's visit to England, Harry was the quiet one, and Draco’s sense of humour turned vicious. He wasn’t convinced they were friends, but they knew him in a way Harry never would. Around Ron and Hermione Draco seemed more like himself, but even that was tempered with a strange tension—after all, Hermione was his boss.
“After this, you should meet Andromeda and Teddy. And we’ll have dinner with your mum. We should meet each other’s friends. And you should move into Grimmauld with me,” Harry blurted all at once.
“Fine, then. Let me get to know you. Come to bed, we’ll talk in the morning,” Harry said. Draco looked so tired all of the sudden. He was still dressed up in Harry’s Quidditch joggers that were too short and a plain t-shirt Harry had lying around.
“Your storytelling skills could use some work,” Harry said. He could see how someone like Malfoy talked himself into and out of trouble.
“They can’t work with us here,” Narcissa said quietly. She took his hand and led him into their kitchens. She sat him on the chair and started casting. She cleaned his robes, glasses and then took a wet cloth to begin cleaning little cuts he hadn’t noticed and healing them one by one. It was comforting in a strange way.
“I’m fine,” Harry said. He took a deep breath. His body felt a bit panicked, but he knew some of his memories were trapdoors. Sometimes he would catch a whiff of a sickening sweet perfume that reminded him of Umbridge and he would have to pause. Remind himself that she was long dead. Try not to choke on the memory. What was he remembering?
“Harry, broom ride?” Teddy asked for the fiftieth time this visit. Teddy’s hands were sticky with juice and one hand was patting Harry’s face in what Harry was sure was meant to be an affectionate gesture. Disgusting but cute.
“You know it was that or in-house counsel for Gringotts if I wanted reasonable hours so my son isn’t raised by a rotating cast of expensive, unionized house-elves. My wife hates...I mean, Astoria would have hated the idea.”
“Edward...” Harry warned. He didn’t mean to use the Auror voice, but Teddy did look a little shamefaced.
“For God’s sake, Harry, I’m not going to take him in for waterboarding,” Hermione said, putting her wand away as she rolled her eyes. She turned to Draco.
Over time with their consultations, Draco saw Harry in all kinds of situations. Many where Harry should be objectively unattractive to him.
It would be easy to make a story out of what happened five years ago. Something with neat lines, cause and effect, a beginning, middle, and end. It would certainly have felt better if Harry could confront a particular case or confine it to that day and that day alone.
“Yes, I’ll be at your mandatory event in the clothes you picked out. You need to Floo to work,” Harry said. Then he noticed a little piece of fluff, in his hair and leaned in to pick it out.
Ron had never joined after finishing Auror training. It would be another six years before his trainee license would expire. But once Ron had started working at Weasleys’ Wizarding Wheezes and expanded their franchises, Harry got the feeling Ron would probably never return. Ron seemed to enjoy retail real estate, stock logistics and wizarding freight shipping  more than he had ever liked catching Dark wizards on the run.
“Oh. That’s the boring part. Blaise and I eavesdropped, figured out the merchant was selling information to the brother, set a trap and caught them red-handed with poison. Suitably dramatic. I’m told there’s a hideous gold statue of Zabini and myself in Chita. The British ambassador Dumbledore was in residence and was impressed. We met and then I became entirely your creature, General.”
Harry had opted for jeans and a nice green cardigan over a white-collared shirt. Draco had dressed similarly, but all of his clothes seemed nicer somehow. This Draco looked like Harry expected. He was too pointy to be traditionally handsome, but he was striking with the late afternoon light shifting over his face.
“Yes and no. He used a Time Turner too. But it’s not dangerous,” Draco reassured him. Harry shot him a disbelieving look.
Harry could feel the grit in his teeth, but spitting out sand to allow more sand in his mouth had seemed futile. Harry found his way to his own tent. Helpfully, the personnel tents were in alphabetical order, with last names over the tent flaps in white block letters. His tent and Malfoy’s were side by side.
“Go to bed,” Draco grumbled. Harry turned on his side. Draco slipped an arm around his waist and kissed the back of his neck so lightly Harry felt as though he might have imagined it.
In his world, every time they went to functions they rated the food like they were on one of Hermione’s favourite cooking shows. Nothing had cracked a five out of ten in years. It made Harry happy they still had that even if they wouldn’t go looking for food afterward. As if she had caught herself, her smile slipped off her face and she turned to Draco.
Harry was not a teenager. He could share a bed. He could avert his eyes. He shucked off his clothing and let Draco rearrange the covers. He stared at the ceiling for a bit after he extinguished his lamp with his retrieved wand. He was lying in bed with Draco Malfoy.
"Draco? Can one boy kiss another boy?" Harry asked. "Yeah, it's called being gay, duh!" Draco laughed, but stopped when he saw the confusion on Harry's face. "Don't tell me that Golden Boy Potter has never heard of someone being gay? Well, it's when one boy falls in love, dates, kisses or anything like that, another boy. Why do you ask?" He asked, looking at the raven haired boy curiously.
"I need to go and see him, Draco. He wouldn't of come back if it wasn't really important!" Harry stood up and looked down at Draco who was looking at him in worry, biting his lip. "I'll be fine, love. Don't worry." Draco watched as his boyfriend ran away, not going after him for a reason that he did not know.
Ron looked at her in pure shock, before spinning and starting to run out when he felt Harry's hand on his shoulder. "Please, Ron. I'm willing to forgive if you can learn to accept me. I don't want to lose you now, after everything we've been through together. You're my best friend Ron. You've helped me through dark times and I've helped you through yours. Please don't throw away these past eight years over some small thing. I need you Ron and you need me too."
The only room he doesn’t check is his parents, mostly because he hadn’t been allowed in their wing of the Manor unless it was an emergency when he was a child, and he had never got to be an adult here.
Harry barely heard anything Sirius said. He just looked at him. Fuck, that twisted up everything in his chest. He understood for the first time why Draco had gone to such lengths. It was like the Mirror of the Erised but worse. He could feel this. He could hold this.
“You’re brilliant. I—I can’t say anything but you’re brilliant,” Harry kissed him once excitedly and ran downstairs without him. Draco started after him when he bumped into his mother.
“Is that still the case?” Harry asked. He wished that Draco had just said that instead of claiming they knew nothing about each other. Without a question, Harry would stay away if it was important for Draco’s wellbeing.
“Are you feeling well? The Browns always pack too many people in,” Draco said, his brows knit together with worry. Draco placed a hand on his arm.
“Indirect spells only. Aim at the ground. We don’t know how many of them might have the absorption magic,” Athena said.
Ron took him out for a drink to let Hermione take a nap in their empty flat after work. It turned into four or seven drinks. First, they circled around the usual topics: work, Quidditch, where each Weasley was.
Harry landed while descending the steps and tripped. He knocked down a photo that was hanging on the wall and caught it. The picture was of him aged approximately ten, standing with his parents. They were all smiling and waving. A day in Brighton, it looked like. A magical universe since the photo moved. Something about the photo wasn't quite right, but Harry couldn't pinpoint it.
“Nothing that might have happened there counts here. The other universes aren’t real,” Draco said, pulling away.
Draco emerged from the room, still on his cellphone. Without looking, Draco closed the cover on Harry’s fingers and waved his hand towards the entryway.
“I am sorry for your loss,” Andromeda said once she made her way to the front of the receiving line. Her face betrayed no emotion. She offered them a bow as everyone else had.
“We don’t know. It’s pretty clear that they are all answering to a central purpose,” Zacharias said.
“I don’t like admitting it but it’s very possible. It makes more sense if these attacks were ways of testing capabilities. They aren’t hurting people because they don’t need to. They can make anyone a squib using powerful objects and if the things we’ve found are discarded...” Athena trailed off.
“Auror Potter, Auror Malfoy?” Healer Tadenik runs into the unit with 3 mediwizards behind her. “Glad you’re awake.”
“Oh sweetie, you’re soaked. I think we have a towel and a shirt in the back, at least. We’ve a spare umbrella under the cash, no?”
Harry had one real problem as far as he was concerned. But every week he had to excavate truth after truth that he had stopped thinking about. It felt strange to face someone who was not much older than him and tell him trivial things about his upbringing. After all, the most important thing that would ever happen to him had happened already. Everyone knew about it.
“If I’d known it was that tricky, I might have sent one of the Senior Cursebreakers with you. Good job. That’ll be the toughest part and we can get some Alexandrian government officials in sooner for recovery,” Bill said finally.
“Pragmatic. And it’s served me well,” Draco says. There’s the hint of Slytherin Harry’s been looking for this entire time.
There is a long moment before the sconces light all along the cavernous entryway. For a few seconds there’s nothing but the click of his boot heels, muffled somewhat by the thick dust. All the white and grey marble flooring is cracked in the entire first floor, lines radiating from under his feet in the entry. It smells of damp more than rot, as he expected. Draco wonders if perhaps he’s buried the feelings so deep that he can no longer access them.
“I’ll be back. Of course, I’ll be back,” Draco said, leaning down to give him a peck. His eyes searched Harry’s face. “I...I wouldn’t stay out there, you know. I don’t think I could.”
“A few of us in the Sacred Twenty-Eight have formed a small social club. Wine Wednesdays, some trading, if you’re interested,” Greg said.
“If you can’t take a train there, it’s not worth it. I’d rather travel by barge than International Portkey. We’ll be getting married here,” Pansy said.
When their lips touched at long last, there was none of the restraint that characterized any of their earlier kisses. The kiss was deep, rough and so good Harry almost forgot his own name. Draco made it known that he wanted Harry. He trapped Harry against a wall of the room, making sure there was no space between their bodies.
“Harry, you can find someone if that’s what you want.” Draco was so sincere when he leaned over to put a hand on the back of Harry’s chair. Draco smelled spicy and warm, like a cup of mulled cider after a winter hike. Harry wanted to bolt. Forget about the rest of it, it was this casual closeness that would have torn him apart, little by little.
“Hope you don’t mind but I needed the sleep,” Andromeda said, coming downstairs from her nap. “Teddy’s missed you.”
But what Draco doesn't have this time is the element of surprise. Harry is the one that apparates them to his flat. Maybe he was competitive or incensed Draco had one over on him.
Harry snorts. "There's a new one. A blowjob for Ministry and country. You really do think I'm a saint."
“You can do it again,” Harry said. Harry’s head was not clear enough for flirting. He wanted to continue. “I want you to.” In case there were lingering questions about Harry’s intentions.
“She hasn’t said anything? She broke up with me,” Harry murmured while they set the table. Molly dropped the kettle she had been floating over to the table. Harry flicked a freezing charm before the boiling water splashed on someone. Molly abruptly exited the room on the verge of tears.
“Good birthday?” Harry asked. Draco nodded. He was still hanging on to Harry and Harry hadn’t pulled away. The kitchen was quieter now that it was just the two of them somehow.
Two of them advanced, wands raised. Harry switched his wand to his left hand. He was slightly weaker as it wasn’t his preferred casting hand, but he could push Draco through the gates with his right wandlessly, if need be. The Manor’s wards would protect Draco from further harm once he was through the gates.
“Decided that I needed a bit of help since the grandkids came along but I’m the only one who knows where everything is!” Eustace laughed loudly.
“Precisely,” Hermione said. She smiled the way he did when faced with first years who needed encouragement to grasp basic wandwork. Harry rolled his eyes.
“I would love to see you when I’m back,” Blaise had written from Milan a year ago. They had not been close at Hogwarts, but Blaise Zabini was familiar.
“Go home. We’ll call you once we have a better idea,” Zacharias said calmly. And it was the fact that someone who didn’t care much for him was showing concern that made him pause.
In his world, Ron and Hermione were inevitable. They were a fact of nature, like autumn leaves and gravity. At their wedding, Ron’s speech was about how it scared him the way he had felt when he first looked at Hermione because he knew there was no going back.
“Alright,” Draco agreed. Harry watched the line of his throat as he took the shot easily and then shuddered.
“I know that. It’s just—” Draco said. Then he paused for a long moment. “The house is dated. But it’s nice. Good location.”
Draco bites his lip hard and then clears his throat. “If I had come from that, I would have fucking killed you. And it was a close thing, let me tell you.” Draco’s voice is low and amused even as he’s affecting a complaint. Harry chooses not to answer, to put Draco on his back and slowly push one finger in his slow tight heat. Draco’s hips roll slowly.
“Ow! Keep your claws to yourself, witch,” Draco said. Draco flicked a finger with a small non-verbal spell and Pansy nearly careened off the furniture. His control was shot.
“This is supposed to be a close universe?” Harry asked, watching one patron snort a white line off the bar. Neither the bartender nor the other patrons paid them any mind. He wasn’t a Hitwizard or anything, but he thought people should at least be discreet about their drug use.
He certainly looked better than he had those first weeks back. More colour in his cheeks. A little more filled out. His appeal hadn’t dimmed in the slightest, though. Only the thought Draco might bolt that stopped Harry from interrogating him the way he wanted to. So he answered Draco’s careful questions about Hogwarts.
“Are you feeling okay?” Draco asked him. His hand was resting on Harry’s thigh. Too high up to be friendly, too casual to be new.
Draco side-alonged him directly into his living room with no warning. As a former Ministry official, Harry should have said something about the fact Draco had Apparated from a fully lit set of stairs in a mixed Wizard/Muggle neighbourhood. But he was more intent on the fact that Draco loomed closer in his field of vision.
His eyes filled with tears and he blinked them away hard. Sirius had silver threaded through his hair, but he was unmistakable. Without thinking, Harry went in for a hug. He held Sirius even past when it got strange and uncomfortable.
“Were you happy to see your parents?” Harry asked. He was curious if it had been the same mix of relief and deep sadness Harry had felt when their passing was more recent.
“But what’s this?” Harry asked, tapping a blank spot in the middle. Everything converged on a box that had a large question mark inked in the centre.
Harry looked down and he was dressed in shiny black boots and a deep crimson waistcoat with shiny gold military buttons. His clothes seemed well made but Draco dressed much more simply in an array of greys.
“Fuck, that hurts,” Draco complained.The swelling went down immediately, but the feeling of his nose cartilage moving around was horrifying. This was not a good time, but he should probably apologize to Harry for doing this to him someday.
This time when he jumped back in, Harry found himself waiting out front of an old Wizarding castle in Kent that was often used for events. Cameras flashed and Harry tried to blink away the splotches of colour in his vision.
"You're reading our minds, aren't you?" Harry says. Draco doesn't have time to quibble that this oily-feeling probe is not like any Legilimency he's ever known. Harry's kept his wand at his side but even he is not quick enough to block when she casts something wordlessly. The old woman gives them a rueful smile, snaps her fingers and disappears into thin air.
“At the rate MACUSA is going, several crime cartels are going to have a better seat than the Americans next summit.”
“I'll be asking you questions more like how much magic could you cram in a calumet crescent ward before it explodes,” Harry said.
“I know but I do have to go back home to study,” Draco admitted. He looked as put out as Harry felt.
Instead, they spend a long half hour in the stacks kissing. Harry lets the feeling of the shelf digging into his back ground him as he relaxes into Draco. This doesn't burn hot enough to require more. In fact, the bond is a steady calmness that soothes as Draco demands long, hot kisses from Harry and he gives them up too eagerly to have anything to do with a curse. He wants this more than he's ever wanted anything.
And while it was awkward the first few times they all did seem to like Draco fine. Maybe it helped that they’d gone to Draco’s old pub, where he knew the muggle bartenders and they teased him about tipping too much like always.
“Nonsense. You’re doing fine and I’ve got to watch the stove,” Molly said. She smiled and waved at Rosie, bundled in Draco’s arms. She had made her mind up to try for Harry’s sake and Harry loved her for it.
There was her own bitterness there for his paternal grandfather that his mother had shut up tight when he was a child. He was fascinated that apparently all this had gone on and he’d never noticed a tension between them. But her story wasn’t done.
Harry agreed. He laid down in a bed similar to his own and turned back to his own world. He didn’t sleep. He laid awake and stared at the ceiling and thought about Draco Malfoy’s fingertips underneath his jaw. If he dreamt of deep dark caverns, he stopped fighting it. He would wake up soon.
“First, I wanted to see who else I could have become,” Draco said. “Then it was...I don’t think you’d understand. It was only Theo left. Everyone else I knew has left or died. I was tired of being alone.”
"Thank you," Harry says. Draco isn't really interested in running through more of Cardiff pursuing this creature. He doesn't work for the Department of Mysteries and backup is at least five minutes away.
“That operation was a complete disaster. You all could have been killed with nothing to show for it. If I say wait, I mean wait. If I say hang on, you better fucking well hang on,” Kingsley said. “Are we clear?”
“Whatever test you’ve set for me,” Draco said. He was holding his arms tight to his body and walking fast. Harry took longer strides, trying to catch up. Draco must be part gazelle or something.
“Are you alright ducky?” An older woman said at the landing. She didn’t wait for his answer before putting her hands on her hips and shouting up the stairs.
One of them pulled the hood off. From the dark sliver under the gap of the door it was nighttime. Draco caught his breath.
“They say it’s new, but it’s always old,” a voice said. Harry turned around to face Luna Lovegood in a field of yellow tulips. Here she was about eleven, barefoot with bumblebee earrings and a set of overalls so large on her thin frame she had belted them with a frayed length of rope and rolled the legs several times. Her blond hair was waist length and her eyes were bright. She reached out and held one of his hands in hers.
The problem is they definitely need to stop going back and forth between Grimmauld Place and Draco’s tiny bedsit with Blaise, Millie, Luna, and whatever poor travelling soul couldn’t scare up better accommodations than Luna’s ‘vegan, queer, gillyweed friendly, price: give from your heart’ listing on WixSurf.
The name finally clicked for Harry. Dorcas Meadowes was an Auror who had died in the first Wizarding War. She had been an Order member. There was a photo somewhere of her smiling and waving in Harry’s albums. Athena must be related to her somehow.
“Sorry! Sorry. I’ll do it tomorrow!” He had never heard his father’s voice so casually, but it sounded like his. Harry froze on the landing, rubbing his ankle. He felt a comforting hand placed on his shoulder.
“Simply put: Theo managed to slip out of every reality, and that’s very bad. And he needs to come back here and he’s stuck right now,” Hermione had tried explaining. “We have to go get him soon when the time is right.”
It was cool for May, but the heat generated by the crowd made the air steamy. Harry stuck a finger under his cravat.
“What do they even want with him? They’ve been experimenting on muggleborns. He’s a pureblood!” Harry said. Harry was aware this shouldn’t be happening to anyone, but Draco was his...was his...
“Fleur, can you fetch a cold washcloth?” Draco called into the kitchen. He was peering into Harry’s eyes so intently.
Harry wasn’t looking forward to it, as Ursula Tabachnick seemed to resent him for some perceived slight he’d never figured out. She had kept trying to shunt Harry from general duty to International Security Cooperation or Public Affairs.
“You think that they were trying to find a way to take and receive wizard magic with Dark objects,” Athena said. Penny and Zacharias were pale as death. Kingsley looked very, very unhappy.
"You are always so sentimental." Draco paused. Perhaps he wasn't sure that remark would be received well. Harry didn't mind. They sat.
Pansy came exactly once, meeting him for tea years ago at the Victoria and Albert museum dressed exactly like a High Street mannequin in fancy Muggle clothing. She wrote to him twice a week but never visited again. Draco got the feeling that Pansy found the entire experience very disconcerting because, like him, she found it was not nearly as different as she had thought.
Draco had heard rumours that the Muggles Harry was related to weren’t great, but he’d assumed that had been a combination of exaggerations to make Harry Potter seem even more heroic and simple anti-Muggle prejudice.
“Trainee Forrester, please apologize to Trainee Malfoy.” That took the wind out of his sails. He couldn’t help but shoot a puzzled glance at Healer Cummins. Trainee Forrester looked furious.
It’s a cool, crisp autumn day in October, the kind with an underlying bite in the air that reminds him winter is almost here. He walked these same grounds in Wiltshire all his life. Now he sees long grass, yellow from neglect, stalks bending in the wind as far as the eye can see. All the places they used to grow potion ingredients have been left fallow. There were once neat rows. Now the only ordering principle seems to be the hawthorn roots choking out the rest. The garden is a disgrace, with blighted blood-red roses and more thorny bramble than greenery. He feels nothing surveying what time has done.
“I didn’t say I'm an innocent, Harry,” Draco said in between bites to the column of his neck. The biting and his voice were making Harry feel shivery, out of control and good. “It’s a lot right now. I’ve been out of this body for months. Doesn’t feel right.”
Zacharias gave him a quiet nod from his workstation. It figured Harry would have to be literally attacked on the job before Smith would give him an ounce of respect. Harry nodded back.
Harry picked Draco up in a fireman’s carry and ran. He was running practically blind for the edge of the property that wasn’t covered under the giant hexed security bubble they had generated with their magic. It was a kilometre or so away.
“Everything there costs an arm and leg. D’you know that’s how Alastor lost his leg? London real estate,” his father continued, winking outrageously.
“You want to be cleared to go back, Harry.  That’s understandable. But you told me you were very disappointed and unhappy there. So why?”
Gabriel placed it on his wrist and the bracelet shrunk and disappeared. It didn’t feel like anything. Not like the potions to stuff down magic and make it undetectable that tasted like copper and regret. Gabe smiled and Draco felt like he should crawl into a hole.
So, of all the inconvenient parts of being bonded several times, one of them is that apparently Harry's brain has begun to associate Draco’s close, sustained physical contact as interest. Nothing has changed. But now if Draco puts his arm across the back of Harry's chair, Harry pays attention.
As much as Harry was glad this had amounted to something potentially helpful, they were skirting around what Harry wanted to speak about.
“Tracey Davis, as I live and breathe,” Draco said sarcastically. He knew he could identify her if she spoke for long enough. Seemingly remembering this was a hostage situation, she vanished the rest of his meal and hexed his mouth shut before forcing the hood back over his head.
"Why do you still have all your scars?" A deeply personal question, but it had been bothering him. Harry had the money to take them away.
“Why didn’t you Owl? Have you slept?” Draco asked. If Harry was being very honest with himself, there was something about the combination of glasses and the stern Healer voice that was doing something for him.
Draco sat down next to Harry on the sidewalk patio of a coffee shop, though it was too warm out. Somehow what Harry said next caught him unawares.
Harry sits up. Draco has donned his boxers but hasn't dressed. He can see Draco changing his mind as he crawls halfway up the bed to kiss Harry against the headboard. Harry is not nearly awake enough for this.
“I’m not fucking sleeping here anymore,” Draco says, after the newest poltergeist rips the sink out of a wall at Grimmauld at three am in a rush of water. Harry is forced to admit he might have a fair point between the phantom rats, a recurring Boggart problem, rotting floorboards and a rattling sound in the attic that Harry isn’t quite brave enough to investigate.
Theo got it faster than Draco had. Theo struggled not to smile as Pansy taught him. Draco watched them look at each other and stashed that knowledge away for later. If his friends were happy, he would be as well.
“Yeah sure mum. Will do.” He kissed her on the cheek and gave her a big hug. Over her shoulder he glanced at a mirror over the fireplace at his face. There was no scar at all. Huh.
"I feel like I'm at a disadvantage here, because I don't know what you were thinking," Harry murmurs.
“Yes. Sorry.” He passed one extra champagne flute back to the waiter and held one out to Hermione. He could see her deciding whether it was rude to refuse before gripping it tightly.
Harry returned to himself slumped over the kitchen table. His back ached a little. He was mentally exhausted, although on the whole his body felt fine. He stood up and drank three glasses of water and finally stopped himself from shaking. It was over. He felt both wrung out and renewed.
“I don’t want to find someone else. I’m perfectly happy,” Harry said. Fuck, all this pining worked up a thirst. He didn’t know how this Harry could stand it. He took champagne flute numbers two and three. He tossed them both back, sending a silent apology to himself.
"You feel so good, Draco," Harry says. There's no hiding face to face. He picks up the tempo, gratified to see Draco arch his back more, push back harder.
Harry, from the beginning, seemed to trust him right away. Draco wasn’t sure how Harry marked him as changed before he even believed it. Trust made it easier to know that even if this wasn’t love yet, it came honestly. Draco wasn’t certain what this really was for him.
“I won’t take you in, okay? Return with me, once. I’ll give you one of the Firebirds now. I just want to talk as ourselves,” Harry said.
“Where are my clinical shoes?” There was a bang from his bedroom, and Harry resisted the urge to tell him that he was a wizard.
“I didn’t realize it at the time, but the fact I never saw Theo on my travels means a lot of things.”
On the kitchen table, Hermione had left a note wishing him luck. He activated the security protocol she set up with his wand as instructed. He stowed his wand in a locking drawer and checked his Floo was still closed.
And he would, but the menu was in Italian. All he had learned of the language from holidays besides please and thank you was ‘sorry I am not interested in sex.’ Draco didn’t bother even pretending to consult with Harry before ordering smoothly for both of them.
“Happy birthday, Draco,” Harry said. Then Harry reached up and he was kissing Draco carefully, sweetly. Maybe he was reading too much into a single kiss and maybe Harry would regret this tomorrow morning, but it was still Harry nipping at his bottom lip and licking hotly into his mouth.
“The reason we are using a safehouse is because this is far more dangerous. Don’t any of you forget this. Someone is playing games with us deliberately. Prima knows we are tracking them and has the resources to feed us false information,” Kingsley continued. Zacharias snorted.
Harry wondered if a wizarding house that was old enough could talk because Narcissa cocked her head to one side and said, “Pansy and Theo are here.”
"You said," Harry says. "I know." He slept with Draco knowing it was 99.9% likely nothing would come of it. He would still do it again.
Turnabout is fair play, Draco supposed. Harry must have noted the lack of marks on his chest. He must be curious about it, given their history.
For the first time, Harry worried that he was going to get himself killed. He knew nothing about this world. And apparently, he wasn’t carrying a wand either from a brief search of his clothes.
“We can have two cats so they keep each other company,” Harry says. Draco turns into him as an answer, rests his nose in the crook of Harry’s neck. It’s obvious he’s pleased with the proposal.
He apparated a few minutes walking from Grimmauld. He expected it to have changed. Aside from a thick layer of dust that made him sneeze, it was much the same. He had cleaned it out after the War so at least there were no troll leg umbrella stands and delicate serpent fixtures, no mounted elf heads or screeching portraits of his godfather’s mother (while the Elder Wand probably should not have been used for her removal, it was remarkably effective where several Cursebreakers had not been).
“What’s going on with you and Gin?” Ron asked next Saturday at the Burrow before breakfast had started. Ginny had written Molly to say she was unwell and wouldn’t be coming down from training camp this weekend.
Athena, Zacharias, Penny and Harry were crouched on the banks of the Thames, fully Disillusioned about 30 metres from a bright yellow shipping container.
Harry was going to go out of his mind. How could there be no trace of Draco? How could he have been kidnapped out of St Mungo's? Was it his fault? It was, wasn’t it.
“Yes,” Draco answered. He didn’t want to say much, but he didn’t want Harry to strand him in this maze, especially when he felt like the walls were closing in.
“You’ll be taking time away because I like you, Harry. You’re a fine Auror. I don’t have issues with your job performance. But I have seen what is happening with you happen to other people as clever and good. This job can break you if you let it,” Kingsley said.
Pansy raised one perfect eyebrow at Draco and mouthed ‘Durmstrang fourth year’. It had been the first time he drank grain alcohol and he had been kissed by some boy named Ivan, immediately thrown up over the side of Durmstrang’s boat and cried inconsolably for an hour in the field while Pansy rubbed his back. Pansy had been sworn to secrecy.
Somehow, he didn’t mind someone in his clothes as much when it was Draco. It made him look less remote, less inaccessible. Draco looked like something he could have, Harry thought. And he looked away. So this was one of those universes. Or maybe he could admit it was also him now.
Back at Grimmauld, it was quiet. Too quiet. Despite the disquieting silence, Harry almost didn’t want to leave again. One universe was enough for one day. He could contact Hermione and tell her he couldn’t handle this after all. He could spend the rest of his summer hiking, and out of London.
Draco ate very, very neatly as if it were important to cut a perfect square out of each leaf of lettuce and compose the perfect bite. It was almost endearing. If he caught Harry looking this time, Draco said nothing.
“I’ve always kept a diary. Since I was a child. I could read back and figure out who I was supposed to be,” Draco said. He folded in on himself as if he thought Harry was going to grab him.
“I hope you talk to someone,” Ginny had touched his shoulder lightly then took the last of her things from his place.
“Is that all?” Harry pushed. He wanted to know why. Why was it that every universe had drawn them together in one way or another? This was the second universe where Draco had been on the right side. He had all the makings of a spy, so maybe it was wish fulfillment.
“No,” Draco said carefully. Greg smiled. It seemed sinister somehow. The Goyles had hidden their assets better than the Malfoys; only his father went to Azkaban for ten years. Greg had paid some token amount of reparation money and never been on probation. He was uncomfortably aware that they had switched social positions.
“You want a cat?” Harry had never thought Draco would want a cat, but after picturing a discussion with Luna about keeping a pet, he understands why it’s never come up before.
“When we found out we were having a baby, he said that he wanted to be a better father than Abraxas. He wanted to make sure that he loved you unconditionally. He loved you more than anything in the world, but he didn’t always succeed in telling you. He also didn’t understand that parents should apologize to children. That was his father’s influence.”
“Gran also said that your boyfriend is my cousin.” Harry nodded, anticipating some further difficult questions about his sexuality, the War, the family rift that was only just mending or vaguely invasive ones about their relationship. Teddy had recently been fond of asking shocking questions and then laughing at their expressions.
If Draco was a better person, he would have put seeing Harry Potter to the back of his mind. He definitely would not have dedicated an entire therapy session to tell Melinda their entire sordid history from Madam Malkin’s through the War.
The team all groaned even the Captain who liked being on the team to burn off excess energy. But they did the floor-work with the determination to do it right and get out of there. Out of a sense of fairness, Harry got down in the mud and crawled along with them. He could use the exercise.
“There’s no need for all of that if you cooperate. I don’t want to arrest you and the Minister doesn’t want this public. The information is more important anyway,” Hermione said.
That kiss was supposed to be for a laugh but a lot of his confusion coalesced into something bright, sharp and painfully clear. Harry wanted him. Even though, at the time, he was dating Ginny. Even though they were friends despite a Quidditch rivalry and a perfectly normal amount of sucker punches off the pitch between years one and three. Even though neither of their parents would like it and their friends barely tolerated each other. Even though, later they were roommates.
There were more and more people to chat with, shake hands with and eventually Harry whispered, "let me get you something to drink."
“You said only kissing. I’ll wait until you’re comfortable with more,” Harry said firmly. Even he felt slight disorientation in his body, and he had been returning here to eat and sleep. He can’t imagine how much worse Draco must feel. Draco wasn’t sleeping well and sometimes Harry awoke in the middle of the night to feel Draco awake and staring at the ceiling.
Harry shuffled after Draco reluctantly. He looked with satisfaction at the stubble burn on Draco’s throat, some blooming marks there and his bee-stung lips. Draco watched the stove and Harry watched Draco and they ate some unlabelled tin of soup before heading upstairs. The house produced a loaf of bread and butter to match.
"Harry?" A voice whispered. But, as much as he tried, Harry couldn't move an inch and fell helplessly into slumber again. "I thought you woke up. It's just my imagination. You probably can't hear me Harry, but I have no idea what I'm feeling right now." the voice said again. Harry listened in silence to more voices arriving, although he couldn't picture anyone's face but one.
"Lily, dear! What was it you literally just said to Draco here? That the past didn't matter?..." Mr Potter smirked. "It's- it's different!" Mrs Potter spluttered. "I don't think so!" Harry smiled in a sing-song voice. Lily looked speechless, then just came and sat back down, though still glaring deeply at Ron as though she was trying to rip him to pieces with her mind.
"Hermione, don't do that, don't blame yourself," Harry muttered, wiping the tears off her face. "Why not? That's what you've been doing to yourself! What hurts you hurts me, Harry. We're best friends. Do you ever think about hurting yourself?" She asked. "Sometimes, but I've never acted on it." He lied, for she didn't didn't know he hadn't got rid of the whole glamour.
But, neither of them could even get into bed. "Let's go for a walk. Neither of us are going to be going to sleep very soon anyway." Draco nodded and lead Harry out of their dorm room and through the winding corridors of the castle. It was of course, empty, seeing as it was quite late at night so Harry took his chances and grabbed Draco's hand. Draco looked to his side and smiled, leading Harry out of the entrance hall and into the castle grounds.
There were many confused and outraged faces directed towards Umbridge, but she just stayed sat there, smiling. "And what proof do you have of this Mr Potter? None. And let us not forget that you broke into the Ministry a while back, pretending to be a different person by use of the polyjuice potion and assaulted me in this very courtroom!"
"I know that you were under the curse," Harry smiled. "But I've been watching you and it didn't even look like you were trying to fight it. In some ways, I get it. The imperius curse makes you feel relaxed and free in your own mind. But it doesn't make the pain lessen for me, Draco. You haven't even the faintest idea of the thoughts that ran through my head during that time, with you gone, there was nobody there to keep me sane."
Harry sat down and flipped to the page in the book he had taken from the library. "You shouldn't have to get used to it. People will get some sense into them soon enough. But, look what I found in the library!" He threw the book under Sirius's nose who took it confusedly and scanned the page. "Oh, Harry. You know we can't use this potion." He stated.
"I should be heading back. Kreacher was giving me some weird lip about 'Master Harry and his courageous friends' and how he 'misses them so!' You've broken my house elf!" He laughed. "Tell Kreacher I'll visit as soon as possible." Harry grinned and waved as his Godfather walked away.
His father and his friends had been those bullies, but Harry didn't want to talk about that right now. "It's so beautiful," Harry said, complimenting the night sky. "I know something that's even more beautiful!" Draco smiled, and Harry who was caught up in the stars just replied. "What?"
"I'm sorry, Potter but as he is your legal guardian then I'm going to have to explain everything to him. On that note, Madame Pomfrey has informed me you haven't been to see her once since you were discharged!" Harry huffed and started to make his way down to potions. Sirius had already had to take in so much information, could he deal with even a little bit more?
"Is this what Prongs and Prongslette meant by 'or who you fall in love with'?" Sirius asked. Harry thought for a moment going over things in his mind. "It can't be. Ginny and I are dating." Sirius's face lit up, but then faltered to a small but kind of happy frown. "What is it?"
The pair sat in a far corner booth at Draco's insistence as he claimed that "anybody could be watching, there are wizards everywhere!" However, nobody seemed to care when Harry leaned over and kissed Draco on the cheek before sliding into his seat.
Ginny noticed Harry and Draco still holding hands and whispered something to Hermione, who just giggled. "What? What is it?" Draco asked as the girls giggled further. "How's that straddle and snog action working out for you?" Ginny snorted.
"Alright, that's enough Weasley. Nothing like that happened for goodness sakes and correct me if I'm wrong, but you can't have a baby without a womb," Malfoy laughed, Harry flushing a deep red.
"Well, duh. I'd been forced to live with them my whole life by Dumbledore. They are, unfortunately, my family of sorts." Harry said, then quickly throwing his hand over his mouth, realizing what he had said. "It was those muggles? They did that to you?" Draco asked, anger boiling up inside, making his face go red. "I swear to MERLIN, I am going to MURDER that big piece of-" Harry quickly intervened, not wanting things to get out of hand.
Harry got the sudden urge of just wanting to kiss Malfoy, to be able to just touch him for a bit, and so he did. He pulled Draco into his lap as he was the bigger one now and kissed him full on the lips. It was a little bit sloppy, but neither one of them cared, reminiscing in the feeling of being able to show affection in public, even if they weren't their true selves.
"Draco, calm down. It was nothing, really!" But what Harry said, just appeared to make Malfoy even more angry. "Nothing? Nothing! I should have known before. I thought that I saw you wipe blood off your face when I came to see you. Thought I was going mental when it disappeared, but that was just the glamour, wasn't it?" So he did notice.
"I just saw two boys kiss earlier. They ran away as soon as I saw them. I was confused, that's all. Is it allowed? Being gay, that is?" He asked, curious to find out more. "In the wizarding world, not really. Nobody really knows why as such, the rule has just always been there. I think it's because the ministry think its an act of rejecting to make more witches and wizards, because you can't exactly, you know." Malfoy answered.
Harry and Sirius were left standing alone in the corridor. "I'd like to show you something Harry." Sirius said as he passed into McGonogall's empty office. He lead Harry to the pensive and extracted some memories from his head. "Watch these." He smiled sadly, and Harry gently pushed his head through the breaking waters of the pensive.
Luna hexed and cursed whilst Hermione screamed and turned the whole room into a frenzy, pillows flying everywhere, feathers creating mini tornados and even a couple of sofa's zoomed across the room. But, Harry sat there, motionless, not even showing the slightest hint of emotion anymore. He just sat, not even flinching when a pillow almost smacked him right in the face. The room calmed down and Hermione joined Harry on the sofa.
"What, why not?" Draco whined. "I was under the imperius curse! Gosh imperius and crucio, this week hasn't been good for me."
Ron looked up, eyes widening in surprise. In love? His best friend, in love? And he wasn't there to support him? "For fucks sake!" Ron groaned, banging his head lightly on the table. "And what about Ginny, huh? They were meant to be together and Harry just screwed her over! She's meant to be your sister too, you know!"
Once he had calmed down he sighed happily and fell into Draco for a hug. "Harry, we're in public!" Draco gasped, jumping back and looking around frantically. "We're in Muggle civilization, Draco. The laws are different here. Come on, I know where we are, there's a nice café around the corner and I need a drink." Harry said softly and took Draco's hand before dragging him away.
"I don't understand," Harry smiled. "Who'd want to love me?" Tears filled Harry's eyes as he looked away from the boy that he wanted to give his whole heart to. "I want to. And I always will. I saw them Harry. What you've done to yourself, on your arm. And I don't understand! I never realised it was that bad and I should've, I am so sorry that I was too dumb to see how much you were actually hurting. I love you, Harry. And I'm not afraid to say it anymore because now I think that you love me too."
Suddenly, there was a click and a flash and the two boys jumped apart, again. Rita Skeeter stood a few miles away from them with a big camera in her hands. "Got you now Potter!" She cackled and ran off. Harry began to sprint after her but it was no use, his body was too weak.
"Anyway," Sirius coughed. "I actually came here to tell you about this. It's a letter from the ministry. I have a trial a few days before yours to prove my innocence. I'm allowed three witnesses and I was wondering if you would be the third?" He asked hopefully.
"I was imperiused!" Barton yelled, sending chills down Harry's spine. "Yeah, 'imperiused'." Harry replied, rolling his eyes. "A further ten points for your arrogance Potter! Look, I may not be the best person in the world but I would never have joined leagues with you-know-who willingly," Barton sighed. "Sure." Draco muttered under his breath, but Harry felt some sort of sympathy for his professor.
"Well if it isn't the happy couple that never returned," Dean smirked. "Sorry, we fell asleep," Draco muttered. Harry picked up a bit of baguette and stared at it intently. "I wonder who came up with the idea of bread. Do wizarding folks believe in God or do we have our own version on evolution?" He asked, putting the bread back.
"We should've gone back, just to make sure he didn't do that to anybody else," Harry said quietly. "Harry, you don't need to be there to save the day every time. There are loads of people in there who are capable of fighting back!" Draco argued.
Draco lead him to a fireplace where they were transported to Muggle London. "Harry, look at me," Draco whispered. "I need you to calm down, gem. Focus on your breathing, match it up with mine." He said as Harry slowly nodded and focused his everything on the boy in front of him.
Up Harry's arms, were thousands of cuts, long, short, deep, shallow. Draco had to hold in a scream as he kicked himself over and over. How could he not notice this? How could he not notice that this poor, innocent boy was in a lot more pain than he showed?
"Obviously, I wasn't dead and I begged to leave, to protect my Godson but they wouldn't let me go. I know it all sounds make believe Harry, but I'm telling the truth. It felt like I was there for a month or two, tops, but here it's been almost three years."
As Petunia continued her tale, there was no sign of forgiveness in her sister's eyes. "I'll see you later for Sirius's trial, Harry." Lily said solemnly and then disappeared. Petunia sat down on the dusty sofa and sighed, putting her face in her hands. "I'm sorry," Harry frowned. "What for?" Petunia replied, looking up at her nephew. "For being such a nuisance, for being just another annoyingly buzzing around your home, unwanted."
They burst out laughing, which made the eighth years who were lounging in the common room turn in their direction. Their eyes lingered for a moment on the unknown couple who were still holding hands, but then turned back. "Merlin, guys! I was freaking out, I thought I'd lost my memory or something!" Ron groaned, but a small smile was playing on his lips.
"Well, why not?" Harry asked. "People would just think we are two friends out for a drink," he shrugged. "Because then I wouldn't be able to do this," Draco whispered and kissed Harry very lightly on the lips. "Or this," he muttered again, climbing onto Harry's lap and facing him. "Or this." He said once more and started to nibble on Harry's ear, then down to his neck.
Harry fell on the ground, his head in her lap and sobbed, shaking as she stroked his hair. "Harry, what's going on?" Ginny said softly. Stuttering, Harry recounted the story of what had happened with Draco and Pansy, breaking down all over again. "And to think I ever trusted that dick with you!" Ginny spat, shaking now too but in anger. Her face went red and it looked like steam was about to come screaming out of her ears, nose and mouth.
"What made you realise you were gay, Harry? It can't have just been seeing those two boys kiss," Malfoy asked. "I don't really know if I'm being honest. I always had this nagging feeling, but I couldn't quite pinpoint what it was. I just ignored it up until fifth year when I had my first kiss with Cho Chang. I thought it would be really exciting and love filled, but when asked I just described it as 'wet'. Wet!" Harry laughed.
"What, what is this Hermione? Why do Draco and I have matching tattoos? I know I was drunk the other night, but I don't think I'd be stupid enough to do this!" Harry groaned. "You two have the encanta bond!" She grinned excitedly. "We do?" Draco gasped happily whilst Harry just looked downright confused.
Harry's voice became as clear as Pansy's inside Draco's head, and he almost dropped his wand in shock. It was Harry, it was Harry all along. 'DO IT!' Pansy screeched. "No." Draco chocked as he felt the spell loosen.
"Y- you're not allowed to do that! Out of your stupid school and here in the normal world," he gulped and Draco chuckled. "No, you see, we are of age now, we can use whatever kind of magic we want outside of Hogwarts," Draco paused to smirk and roll his eyes at the cringing Dursley men. "And nobody else is watching!"
"Hermione. You come from the Muggle world, you had a good upbringing, nice parents so when did your forget how to FUCKING KNOCK!" Harry groaned, annoyed that his almost-kiss with Draco was interrupted because that was so what he needed right now. He turned around too as Draco pulled on his clothes. "Sorry! But I think I've found out something really important! Are we okay to look?" She asked. "Yeah, alright."
Draco gasped at her and Mr Potter rolled his eyes. "We're dead, Malfoy, we see all!" He groaned, his voice simply dripping with sarcasm. Draco had the feeling Mr Potter didn't like him all that much. "Dad!" Harry snapped, but hid a small smile edging at the corner of his mouth.
"Na ah! Everyone needs to know you belong to me. Or, at least, that you aren't available to anybody else!" He smirked. "You know you can't tell anybody about who actually gave you those. You'd out us all and you know the laws." Seamus said seriously.
"Well, hopefully he was under the imperius curse, because I really don't think that I could handle another year of someone trying to kill me," Harry lightly chuckled. "I love this," Hermione smiled, her eyes watering slightly. "Love what?" Ron asked. "This," Hermione laughed. "Us three, just us three, having a nice conversation again without having to worry about horcruxes and almost dying. I mean, we were talking about Harry's love life! How often have we done that?"
"Mum, Dad, Bill, please can you give Harry and I some privacy. I'd like to speak with him." George said quietly. "Are you sure Georgie, we can stay by the door if you want," Mrs Weasley said. "I've told you not to call me Georgie!" George snapped. "Please just wait outside," he sighed, giving them a small smile. It was clear he was still in a lot of pain. They all were.
"Why didn't you tell me? That you were gay?" Harry asked immediately. "I didn't think it seemed necessary. Thought you probably already knew anyway, seems as Weasel found out," Draco sighed. Harry would normally have a go at him for calling Ron 'Weasel' but today, he didn't care.
“No, and I don’t have time to take you. Come.” Draco took off even faster this time. He led Harry to a mid-century block of flats, through a courtyard and up to a flat on the third floor. It smelt of people’s cooking mixed with petrol. The lights flickered overheard as they walked down the hall.
They locked eyes only briefly. Harry opened the door to Forwellsteads at the same time as Draco moved towards the door, a wary expression on his face.
“What do I do then?” Harry asked. Draco had spotted them and was coming over. Harry was uncertain he had ever seen that expression. It was a warm, engaging smile, notably absent of any mocking or glee over his misfortune.
“No thank you,” Harry says. “I’ve just missed you." Harry’s reminded he hasn’t had a chance to kiss Draco properly in the last few weeks. The
Harry had to treat this as an actual investigation or he would never solve this and catch up to him. He flitted through the house like a ghost, spending an entire day trying to figure out how to structure this.
“Perhaps if you had agreed to become Head Auror as I asked, government would be less confusing to you,” Kingsley shot back.
But Draco didn’t. His face softened, looking sweet and vulnerable in a way Harry hadn’t seen in any universe. And he kissed him. It was more passion than finesse, Draco’s mouth hot beneath his. Harry wanted to remind him he was kissing him in his own body.
“You’ve been busy. But you’re welcome any time,” Andromeda said. She knew he was on leave, but she made her excuses for him.
Harry asked the first question that came to mind since he was hungry and a little desperate for more of this normalcy. “What are you making for dinner?”
“Mint chocolate,” Draco said, his accent so crisp it sounded like he was recording elocution lessons. Harry made a face. “I know. Five-year-olds. He is very much my son though.”
Harry couldn’t think of what to say to them about the situation so he opened his mouth and said, “I think the crib will be done by next week. Sorry.”
“It’s mostly troop movements. I wasn’t able to get the extra rations across the border to the camps, but I’ll try to get them from Nott’s regiment.” Draco promised.
Harry likes the second house in Sussex right away. They meet later that week after one of Draco's shifts at St Mungo's. It’s absurdly priced but pristine and bright. There’s clean white and black lines everywhere. She leaves them to walk around by themselves once she’s pointed out the monochromatic art deco inspired mural and statues around the gardens from the former owner’s mistress. There’s a missing key to a pool house that Pansy’s looking for.
The shops were getting less busy and the cobblestones more uneven. Still, it was nothing out of the ordinary. There were the same signs of the War if you knew where to look, but nothing, nothing like that last world. A small stencilled lily was still visible on the lower-left corner of some dingier looking homes. It looked almost accidental, like a child’s drawing, and it was easy to miss if you didn’t look.
“A vanilla cone,” Harry said. He wasn’t looking at the board in the shop. He was looking at Florean Fortescue.
Heart in his throat, Draco moves on to his own room. Similarly preserved. His bedroom is larger than the one in his current flat, so he takes a moment to turn in a small circle. The room is too dark. His father shouldn’t have given in to Draco’s fifth year impulse to paint the entire room black, with tiny moving pinpricks of yellow and white like stars. But that year his father was distracted and indulgent. In retrospect, it is a sign of what was to come.
“Thank Merlin.” He thought she muttered something like ‘smarter than your father’ but he was not sure.
Their townhouse was in a small enclave of wizarding homes in Brixton. The exterior was plain and unassuming, but the inside was eclectic. There were little handmade charms in every window and doorway. It was a cultural thing, he thought, but didn’t want to ask. All their furniture was the same beautiful dark cherry wood which seemed more adult than the museum of mismatched dated antiques he lived in. They even had framed Muggle postcards from travelling.
“How was it?” Harry asks. He stands at the stove stirring a stew. Something tomatoey from the smell of it. Usually as soon as he was through the door of their Linden Garden flat, Harry would be all over him.
She handed him a package thick with documents and hurried out into another room. With no supervisor in sight, he carefully opened the package. There was a thick sheaf of official-looking identification papers and cards for a Drake Malloy: birth certificate, national identification number and bank card. On the bright side, they were all labelled with a brief explanation because he had no fucking clue what any of those things were or what they were used for.
It might have been unusual generally because of pureblood gender roles, but for someone like Pansy it was unheard of that she would propose to Theo. She was no suffragette. Draco loved her dearly, but she spent half her time pretending to be some sort of expensive and rare decorative tropical flower.
When he walked out, Draco was sitting in his kitchen reading a book. The wards must have let him in. It was nearly 8 pm now according to his kitchen clock. Harry waited a second, enjoying the curve of his neck and savoring the idea of Draco being in his space. Merlin, he was a good looking man.
Harry wasn't sure whether he had pulled Draco down or not. Either way, Draco was straddling him, wearing most of his work attire and offering little nips along Harry's collarbone. Harry had been sleeping in nothing more than shorts so the imbalance threw him off a little.
There was only one thing to answer that. Harry moved slowly to allow Draco to complain, to turn his face away, to bolt and say something faintly ridiculous like ‘you’ve mistaken this entirely’ in that curt way he had.
“What if it doesn’t work out in this one? What if we’re too different?” Draco said, sometime after the first month they lived together in Hogsmeade.
“And your work?” Harry asked politely. He knew from Hermione there wasn’t much he could say, so he wasn’t surprised at Draco’s shrug.
Harry was staying up just in case. Athena had let him know the operation was a success with only a few escapees. They’d managed to round up all the dangerous items for later study. Minister Dale Steel had done a triumphant press conference with particular emphasis that he had arrested his own senior staff in the pursuit of justice.
“She’s upstairs,” George answered. Harry was most worried about his reaction to Draco in this setting. George looked guarded but not hostile.
The Gryffindor let out a long, exasperated breath. “Because he hates me, alright? I don’t talk about them because they hate me.”
The atmosphere was quite relaxed for such opulence; high society members mingled about in fine dress robes or slacks, drinking lightly whilst jazz music played low in the background. Wait staff escorted other guests to tables with dim lighting, from which comfortable laughter could be heard. It was easy to see the appeal from the perspective of a celebrity who didn’t get much in the way of peace.
Harry looked sheepish at that. "Oh. Well in that case: no. I really, truly didn't and I don't know who did."
, you would not choose that monster. You would choose us,” she said as she walked away from Lucius Malfoy.
“It just stands to reason that if all of you grabbed it at the same time, then you could wash your hands of it,” Draco explained. “It would be like the third task never happened, and it’d be up to the judges to decide who won.”
“Bartemius Crouch Jr. is alive,” said Dumbledore. “He has been acting the part of Professor Moody throughout this year. It was he who put your name in the Goblet. He created a Portkey using the Triwizard cup, and attempted to use the Imperius Curse on Auror Jenks during the task. You, Harry, have never met the real Alastor Moody.”
a father! You get to remember how he taught you to fly, and took you on trips. You get to remember him cheering for you on the stands and laughing with you in the grocery aisle and telling you to hide when you’d done something ridiculous and your mum was likely to be upset. Your mum that you also had and
Draco blinked at her, then sneered. "Just humiliate myself in front of him then. Yes I'd imagine Potter would quite enjoy that, seeing as he
“Of course I do,” Joshua said immediately. “You’re looking at the reason Thunderbird holds the Quodpot championship four years running, and you bet your ass I’ll make it a fifth.”
at Harry. The Slytherin seemed to stare at Harry so often that some part of Hermione began to wonder how he had good marks in Potions at all. And Malfoy did not look at Harry at all the way one would assume. No, he
He was facing them again, his eyes disappointed at their bickering. They both lapsed into silence again, sullen.
“Part of me knows that you’re being this way because you’re scared I’m going to get myself hurt,” Harry whispered. “I mean, you told me that. But this other part of me doesn’t feel like that.” He stopped, trying to get a grip on himself so he wouldn’t cause a scene in the middle of Potions. He wouldn’t put it past Snape to take points from him for daring to show emotion, seconds left in class or no.
Draco had woken up to discover himself on the floor of the potions classroom, one Harry Potter asleep with his head on Draco's stomach.
The darkness didn’t begin or end with Draco, but he was a part of it. And that would always be true. It was high time Harry began acknowledging it.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, please, please.” Draco heard someone plead faintly and then realized it was him.
"Can think of something better," Draco says. Harry conjures extra lube, slicks it down his length. The long, hot slide of pressing into Draco nearly undoes him right there. He muffles a groan, digs his nails in his own thigh to stop himself from being too loud. Draco brushes his hands over Harry's soothingly and interlaces their fingers. Harry starts slow and deep, pleading with himself to last.
As he shivered under the awning of yet another shop on his way to the local apparition point, he peered into a window to see someone familiar. He could swear it was Draco Malfoy. He watched for a moment to be certain. Malfoy remained tall and willowy, white blond hair pulled back in a bun. If it hadn’t been for the hair, he might have decided it was some other man in chinos and a black t-shirt, chatting with two coworkers. The older man clapped Draco on the shoulder and they both laughed at something.
There was so much to celebrate when you were allowed to. So many occasions to be marked with lopsided cakes with burnt sugar icing and terrible dancing and sleepy conversations lingering by the Floo for just a few more minutes.
"From here?" Harry tilted his head back. The sky was just starting to lighten around the edges of the halo of trees.
“Hogwarts doesn’t change much, but it’s good to be here,” McGonagall said. She clapped her hands. “Shall we?”
“We’ll have time for blood traitors when we’re done with the mudbloods,” the second one said. Draco tried to catch his eye, but he looked away.
Draco didn’t miss her use of his first name. If Harry wasn’t careful, she would start giving him investment tips. Draco kissed the side of Harry’s mouth. He was happy.
“The entire day it was you,” Harry said. He didn’t see the point of pretending. He held up his Firebird to eye level. Draco would recognize it. He was smart enough to recognize the glow of a proximity spell.
“You could study here,” Harry responded. Draco laughed at his attempt to make him stay, but not unkindly.
Harry wasn’t sure he’d ever seen Draco drunk, but he expected Draco to be in quite a state. Draco stood up steadily from his lawn chair. If Draco’s hair wasn’t slightly messy, Harry was not sure he would have known.
“Are you well? Any symptoms?” Draco said. His wand was already out, although he paused as if waiting for permission.
“Personally, I don’t think that’s the case at all. Reports say that he had been struggling in his personal life, but he kept to himself at work. This seems like it had more to do with him than the work,” Kingsley admitted.
“Darling, I’m glad they didn’t starve you there, but I don’t know how I feel about all of this,” Pansy said, pinching Draco’s bicep with powder pink manicured nails.
“And a bad friend,” Draco added, petulantly. So they were friends here. Harry didn’t know how to process that. Their kids were friends, and he supposed it must be hard to come by other parent friends when most people his age didn’t have any.
Narcissa Malfoy was wearing brand new velvet robes, perfume under-laced with the subtle scent of Pepper-Up Potion, a decent makeup glamour and hair in elaborate braids forming a crown. Her face was unreadable until she saw him. Every lesson she had ever taught him echoed in Draco’s head: never leave the house without looking presentable, back straight and chin high, and guard your feelings closely.
“You still want me?” Draco asks. He sounds unsure. Harry imagines he means right now and not forever. Sometimes, Harry thinks, you have to distinguish the fantasy from the real thing.
“Do you think about what happened?” She asked at the end of the fourth session. It was too early for probing spells and Pensieves, she had said. Melinda was in an emerald green cardigan with a tiny pin that said ‘persist’ in bright red cursive script.
They proceeded to the check-in queue, and they handed Harry a table card at the back, while they handed Draco and Hermione one by the stage.
They finish their work in silence after the curse dissipates, no doubt weakened by time. Harry wants to say something to Draco but he's not sure what he wants to happen. Should they pretend this never happened? This is so out of bounds for a work friendship that it's on Mars. On his last glance, Draco seems perfectly composed, so Harry ducks his head and keeps working.
“A few times. It was...it was one of the arguments that I had when I was married to Hermione. It made her feel left out. It was because you were the one that taught me,” Draco said.
He dreamt of flash floods, forest fires and narrowly escaping a volcano. He dreamt of Draco’s hand, warm and sure in his grasp as he leaned over the edge of the top of a Pyramid. The dreams were going to finally drive him up the wall.
Harry stroked some of the sweaty white-blond strands that had plastered itself to his face. Draco sat up and took off his shirt and stared at his torso. In the dim light, there were very faint silvery scars criss crossing his chest as Harry had imagined. Harry knew what he had done. Still, it was a punch to the gut. Draco also held out his forearms to look at and then sighed.
No. If the Malfoy family and all the other purebloods had been more invested in fairness than pride, perhaps it would have remained his home. As it was, it could stand as a monument to them all. This is a place where evil was done. There is no glory in it, just rot and ruin.
“Trainee Forrester, Trainee Malfoy, come round.” Healer Cummins called. Well, fuck. Now he was really in trouble. She never called anyone to give them a lollipop and a job well done. Maybe he’d forgotten something yesterday?
“Whiskey birthday!” Pansy said, handing him a shot. Draco wanted to argue that this was meaningless but imagined her summoning Theo and Blaise as backup so he took it instead, to a chorus of cheers. He was lightly buzzed. Someone turned up the Wireless, and he hoped that the silencing charms held.
“You shouldn’t eat so fast. You’ll give yourself digestive problems. ” The Healer in him jumped out before Draco could stop himself, as Harry polished off the last of his goulash.
Instead, he went to his cupboards and found a ready-made meal. Tibs, veg and potato. Hermione had taken care of that. Of course she had. The house must not have let her tidy up if it was still this dusty, though.
“I’m not worried about telling you because you can’t stop ‘em,” a suspect said. “The reckoning is coming.” She laughed and laughed and all the hairs on the back of Harry’s neck stood up.
“No. Not anymore. I’m okay now,” Draco said. His hand was flat on the tabletop and Harry was seized with the urge to put his hand over his, like they had at breakfasts before. In some ways, all that time Grimmauld had been a liminal space, its own universe.
Seeing the pattern across the universes, he had prepared for this possibility. But he hadn’t yet realized how kissing Draco would
He hit all three in rapid succession with a Bodybind which they shook off. He followed up with a nasty fire hex which hit. Whatever shielding they had wasn’t perfect. He cast thick ropes to bind them. For good measure, he melted the asphalt slightly until they all sank at least three inches.
The sounds of the party had grown faint when Draco said, “you have to cross the river on foot,” while pulling off his socks.
Draco nodded as if everything she said was perfectly reasonable. He had given up on this point trying to calculate whether people were reacting to his history specifically, the general idea of him or something else. It would have driven him up a wall otherwise. The laws were clear enough. Had he not chosen a diversion program he wouldn’t even be eligible to apply. He had once employed that superior tone himself.
Harry looked up to watch Penny fireman carry Zacharias’ prone body on the shore. She gave the hand signal and Disapparated. Before he could think about it, Athena had held onto his waist and side-along apparated with him too.
Harry stunned him without a second thought and kept running. A yellow jet of light shot towards his face and he dropped into the mud rolling unconscious Draco onto his back. Harry fired off two more stunners, dark red with intent, blindly. He knew they hit but added two more lightning spells to the ground where he thought they had stood, just in case. He stood up, slung Draco over his shoulders again and began to sprint. His breath was coming fast and wild but he had to reach the edge and get him out.
“I told Tinzel the substitution wouldn’t work,” Draco muttered to himself, vanishing the contents of the cauldron and writing some notes in a journal.
And Harry let himself be convinced, even though he knows Michael will probably end up staying with one of his various friends as he often does. Their shared hotel room will be left empty most of the weekend. Harry goes anyway.
At Luna’s solstice party last year, Harry sat next to Draco by the harvest table among the pines and rowan trees when they were both too exhausted to keep up with the other revellers. Their friends with obligations had gone home, so it was just them, soberly observing the party while an eclectic mix of strangers continued to dance around. How strange that Draco was a stranger, in some ways too.
It hadn’t been so long that Harry didn’t know where this would go. It never just happened. A series of choices had led here. Small ones that added up. Harry shouldn’t go along with this. He wouldn’t be able to live with himself if he decided for someone else.
"Both," Draco said. His white trainee Healer robes should have looked ghastly with Draco's colouring, but he was handsome as ever.
“We are disappointed,” Molly sniffed. “But we know it’s for the best. You will come on Saturdays, won’t you, Harry?”
A tall broad Healer said gently, “We'll need you to let go, won’t we?” Something about the way she spoke was soothing so he did let them float Draco, though he kept walking alongside. A Mediwitch joined. He told them as much information as he could remember, conscious he was babbling.
It was Draco who released him when the music stopped while Harry held on a few seconds too long. Harry looked around. No wands. No technology. Nothing but an upbeat string quartet, happy couples doing some kind of country jig and beautiful gowns as far as the eye could see. Was that Hermione in the far corner?
She looked every inch Lucius Malfoy’s wife and he suspected that was the armour she was using to get through today.
The way he said it made him look around again. The house wasn’t so terrible once he had returned every night. It had itself shuffled to accommodate his likes and dislikes now. There were more windows, more light. He knew magical houses could be like that, but it was another thing to experience it.
“They should but they won’t. And I won’t have a single one of these bastards off the hook because they said the investigation wasn’t thorough,” Harry said.
Harry didn’t think he had ever seen Draco eat before and he tried to focus on his own food but it was like dining with the Queen. Harry was trying to follow his advice about eating slower.
“It’s fine,” Harry said. The key to the garden turned up in the kitchen on a hook that Harry didn’t think he’d seen before. But it worried him and he kept an eye on Draco. Draco was avoiding using his wand, Harry was certain.
Draco pulls his hand out of Harry’s only to be hit with a wave of pain so severe it feels like someone is trying to scoop out most of his internal organs with a blunt pickaxe. He gasps and Harry jolts awake too, holding his head.
"Why is it always me?" Draco wondered aloud after Harry passed his licensing exam. "Why do you always come to share
“Once. I’m beginning to think that was the highlight of your life by how often you bring it up,” Draco said.
Harry must have said something. Something because Draco went to the bathroom, and he left Harry standing alone, heart racing and palms sweaty. But next he was aware, he stood on the balcony. He reached under his shirt and pulled the left wing of his Firebird.
He eventually was caught by Blaise, who corralled him and Harry in the kitchen. Harry bumped Draco with his shoulder, and Draco did it back. It was a friendly thing they did all the time living with each other, but it felt different, electric. He was definitely a bit drunk now.
Worse still was being awake and remembering. One late night, Harry had pinned Draco against the kitchen counter and kissed him until Draco had been the one to tap out for once. Harry rolled the wooden beads on his bracelet. But this wasn’t that kind of memory.
Harry brought out a worn black velvet case onto Draco’s counter. He’d seen other customers give Draco something to look at before. Draco always lit up for something new to him despite his hesitancy.
“I need one more character reference. Headmistress McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey both have already. The rest refused. I have exactly two friends and I’m not allowed to use criminals or war collaborators. That’s
“A spare in case you break yours or he’s broken his. Remember, none of those other worlds are yours,” Hermione said.
At best, in the Healer program Draco had a few people who tolerated sitting next to him during breaks at St Mungo’s and occasionally borrowed his notes. So he had resorted to consulting Pansy and Theo over Chinese takeaway at Theo’s flat.
“The new object we found means they could make new Dark objects with those accumulated magics,” Zacharias said.
Harry seizes the chance to really kiss him. To re-learn the curve of his bottom lip, to run a possessive hand down his back, to lace their hands together and hook one ankle around his.
The French Revolution was about when the titled Malfoys fled to England, so Theo was probably right.
“I could have done that for you! I have first aid training,” Harry said. Draco felt the urge to derail into a conversation about the healing he had to undo when someone had botched the job at home or work.
“You would.” Draco rolls his eyes but still sounds fond. But he doesn’t walk away like the other houses. Draco reaches for Harry’s hand.
Harry got three glasses of champagne to the table, as the serving wizard winked at him. Harry thought he was handsome, then tried to figure out whether it was just because the man was blond and in this universe, Harry had a thing for Draco. How did this work anyway? How could Harry know whether it was him or his current self?
Draco almost opened his mouth to tell him there was no need to try to impress. Theo and Pansy accepted him right away because they didn’t have a choice in the matter. But Harry had booked a dinner at an expensive Wizarding restaurant in Soho, and had worn dress robes in Slytherin green to celebrate so maybe it was enjoyable to watch him try.
He hadn’t been released from the Imperius, so Draco sat immobile while excruciating pain radiated through him. He gritted his teeth against the pain, feeling his face turn red. Tears flooded his face.
“As far we can tell,” Kingsley said. “I’m only bringing you on for extraction, you hear? You’re coming along to take Draco safely to his home where we’ve got a Healer on standby. Purely defensive.”
The last world, although interesting, hadn’t given him any obvious clues. Every world Draco had picked so far was something Harry wouldn’t have expected. But it was just a matter of somewhere interesting, Draco would still be there.
“Thanks,” Draco says. The sound of the raindrops only partially drowned out the gentle chug of the windshield wipers working furiously to keep up with the downpour.
“Get a room,” Harry said. It wasn’t original, but he was still grinning when they whirled out of the Weasley fireplace to their flat.
The balcony overlooked a small pond. There was a wry smile playing around Draco’s lips as they faced each other, leaning on opposite bannisters.
“I rather thought you’d fuck me,” Draco says breathily. Harry has to stop so that he doesn't forget what this is, how this goes. Harry needs to stop cataloguing what has changed and what hasn't. This is probably going to wreck him for good this time. There’s something to be said for going into this with his eyes open.
He blew his nose after eating and phlegm streaked the tissues with grey. He didn’t know whether that was from commuting into London after he’d been away or his home, so he cast a few hurried cleaning spells to take care of the worst of the filth.
Draco made gentle shushing noises, led her to her rooms and gave her a sleeping draft for her nerves. He collapsed outside of her room, expecting it was his turn to cry. But nothing came. He supposed he should have told his mother she was not alone, but Draco didn’t count in the way she meant.
The interior of the Manor has fared little better. The house-elves had fled. Draco couldn’t blame them. He would have done the same if he could have. His parents had, after the trials. They send him long letters complaining about the heat and other expats in Marbella and the Galleon exchange rate. Sometimes he replies. Sometimes he leaves the letters unopened for weeks in the front hall.
“Your man’s alright,” George told him when they finally returned Draco to him, an hour or so later. Charlie and Bill agreed.
“I didn’t bring you that kind of evidence.” Harry fished the shrunken redacted reports out of his pockets and laid them out on the kitchen table before tapping them with his wand
Draco cut him off with a kiss which was okay because Harry didn't know where his sentence was going. He wanted anything Draco had to offer even if Draco was only here to kiss him until he couldn't see straight. He just wanted.
"That's so—" Harry moans so loudly he is embarrassed. Harry tries to focus on the smaller details: the weight of Draco’s arm pinning his hips, the warmth of his other hand rubbing soothing circles on his upper thigh. Draco continues to suck him off efficiently until Harry grips his shoulder too hard.
He knew two things. First, it made the most sense to try in every universe to find Draco and speak to him in case it gave him more clues. Second, there was something very deliberate in the choosing. Draco was searching for something or someone.
"If you'll excuse me," Yannick said. And they were left side by side, sipping champagne in silence until the next potential donor came by.
They travelled  in a private floo to a flat. His flat, presumably. Plain, lots of dingy linoleum and beige curtains, very muggle. His living room had a couch and some electronic box. No art. No carpet. His kitchen had one pot, one pan, and a gas stove that probably did not have a self-lighting spell. Not that he could cook.
Draco pretended the kissing never happened the next morning so Harry did too. Draco still brought people home, so Harry did too, and let Draco tease him about it.
Harry has a routine. Tourist traps mean straightforward menus and an understanding he is going to order in English and no one will mind. Not that anyone had seemed to mind so far.
Draco still looked at her warily. Hermione employed a soothing tone that suggested she could have been sorted into Slytherin.
"You're right," Harry crawled down his body without ceremony, pulled down his boxers and went to work figuring out exactly how to take him apart with his mouth. Harry gave one tentative lick from base to tip. Draco didn't react until he got near the tip then he groaned. Okay, so Draco liked that. Harry returned, applying a bit more suction in earnest.
“I will next time. I should have. Sorry. I need you to look at some evidence when you have a chance,” Harry said.
Draco pulls away. “You’re not allowed to use lines on me, I’m already here,” he says and dives back into their kiss. He moans when Harry gives his hair a gentle tug so that Harry can kiss the side of his neck. Draco shivers but forces their mouths back together. Harry runs hands over his solid shoulders. It’s surreal to be doing this again.
“I have to be back at Hogwarts by August 15. Properly back. I don’t care what kind of wobbly time bullshit goes on,” Harry conceded.
“Why did you kiss me?” Harry asked. What he wanted to ask was: will this happen again? Would you like it to happen again? Are we seeing each other?
“You didn’t know I would say yes,” Harry said. Hermione, politely, did not say that they both knew he would do it regardless of the test run.
good in emerald dress robes and black patent leather dress shoes that Draco picked out, that was just a bonus. Draco could look, respectfully. Look and don't touch had always been his rule for Harry in terms of his overall feelings and it had worked so far.
“You know, I was crazy about you. Absolutely crazy about you. I wanted you. If I had been a romantic, I would have stayed.” Something in Harry has been waiting years to hear that. Believing the whole affair had been one-sided hurt much worse than hearing it hadn't, even if Draco still hadn't stayed.
When Harry had known him, Draco had been a kid. That was the problem in the end, wasn't it? They'd all been children, they had made mistakes and then it had shaped their whole lives indiscriminately. They followed paths someone had set from them and ended here. Draco wasn’t a spoiled rich boy or a criminal mastermind. He just seemed like a very tired man who had backed himself into a corner.
Draco had always thought Harry was emotional but now he can feel it. The desire, the embarrassment, the longing. Something warmer.
The Healers fixed him up fine. No permanent damage to his vision or hearing somehow. Harry looked for Draco but a small mousy Healer Trainee reluctantly told him he wasn't working. After making sure he was stable enough he Apparated home and slept.
It is, Harry wanted to say. Simple’s got nothing to do with it. It’s worth it. I want you to choose. Was it the same for you or was it just me?
"Athena has always thought I’m looking for a substitute for Dorcas. No one in the world could be Dorcas. Athena’s brilliant in her own right. I don’t know why I keep trying.” Kingsley sighed heavily.
“Can’t the prosecutors do this part?” Draco asked after explaining another spell proof so Harry could do it in the kitchen of Grimmauld. Harry wasn’t good at them, but he would redo it until it was correct even if each one took him an hour. Draco might have given up if it was that difficult, but Harry refused to let him do them in case it compromised the investigation.
"Burns differently in your forties," Remus said, sticking his tongue out in disgust. Tonks laughed, her face flushed red.
“Owing to the circumstances of these trials, Mr. Malfoy, and mitigated by the fact you were young and under undue influence and a statement submitted by Ms. Granger and Mr. Potter about heroic acts to save lives with significant risk to yourself while under the influence of Voldemort, you are eligible for the pilot diversion program for five years.”
He had hoped to sell some pieces to see if someone could do something about the Mark. It had faded and left a pink outline in scar tissue of what had once been there. He could glamour it, but he would need something expensive and more permanent if it was never to be visible again.
“It was really, really difficult for me to get pregnant. I took all kinds of illegal potions because I wanted a child. He stopped me and said that it didn’t matter to him either way and he didn’t want me to put my own life in danger.”
"I have to go to the clinic in the morning and I came from a shift." And then he kissed Harry so thoroughly he was certain that he was not dreaming and Draco was in fact, standing before him. Harry broke his gaze by taking a quick sip of water from his night stand.
But otherwise, it was still musty, with outdated dark panelled wood, peeling navy blue Rococo wallpaper and elaborate wrought iron sconces. At least the ceilings were high, otherwise, all that darkness would feel like he was drowning. It was late enough in the evening that Harry decided he would start after breakfast. He slept fitfully, but when he awoke, couldn’t recall a single dream.
A sudden anger boiled up inside Harry. He felt like screaming at her, letting it all out. But what good would that do? "I'm okay." He simply said. "Gosh Harry, your voice sounds awful." She said, getting a glass of water for Harry. He sipped it and heard Malfoy come out of the bathroom. "What do you expect he hadn't spoken a word for 4 months." He scoffed. Hermione looked round at Harry surprised. "You haven't spoken since the battle? Why, Harry?" Harry glared at Draco. "Oh, sorry, I thought she knew," he admitted sheepishly.
"That's exactly what we've been asking ourselves!" A voice growled and Draco looked up to see four of his old friends scowling at him in disgust. "I can't believe you Draco Malfoy. G.. gay! With him!" Pansy shrieked. Blaise, Nott and Goyle all gagged and shook their heads at the thought.
"It's all my fault, it's all my fault, IT'S ALL MY FAULT!" He screamed. George stared at Harry in shock, unsure what to do. Harry started hyperventilating, breaths coming short, and he sat down on his knees, knowing his legs wouldn't support him.
MOST CHARACTERS AND SETTINGS AND THINGS BELONG TO J.K. ROWLING (However if you support her views and shit please go away <3)
Ron blinked and shook his head. "I'm an idiot." He muttered. "We know," Draco said, rolling his eyes. "Shut it Malfoy, nobody asked for your opinion!" Ron growled, and Harry felt his wrist throb as he pinned Ron to the ground, growling like an animal. "You don't get to talk to him like that, understood?" He snapped, and only got up when Ron nodded frantically.
Harry lay there as he received slaps, punches and kicks from his uncle, and only did Vernon stop when Dudley called up saying he was hungry. "Go and make dinner you little shit." He spat and stomped out. Harry lay on his floor, aching. At least, this time nothing felt broken, just bruised. He limped down the steps and into the kitchen. Harry turned the grill on and put pork chops in there whilst chopping up potatoes. He went into deep thought about what he was going to do next. He didn't have any muggle money, so couldn't buy an apartment anywhere, after the war, he didn't particularly want to be an auror anymore.
For a while, Harry had forgotten that Draco was still a part of Slytherin house. For starters, the eighth year tower brought all houses together as they'd have to live with one another for a year. Secondly, Draco wasn't the young school bully he used to be. He was kind and gentle with Harry, and although sometimes he fell back into bad habits, Harry was there to help.
"Short pale blonde hair, grey-blue eyes, a muscular build. Pointed jaw and firm hands, preferably in Slytherin, you know, more mischievous." Hermione started to giggle a lot, holding her stomach. "What?" Harry asked, confused. "What are you giggling at?" Hermione continued giggling and finally whispered "You just described a certain Draco Malfoy." Then she ran off as the bell went.
'HARRY POTTER, THE BOY WHO LIVED AND CONQUERED THE DARK LORD IS AMONGST THOSE CURSED OF HOMOSEXUALITY!'
"I'm glad we were put in the same dorm, Potter," Draco said, twiddling with Harry's hair when they collapsed side by side on the bed. They had changed back to their normal selves, remembering their looks for Saturday night. "I will do everything I can to help you get better and nothing, not even Azkaban can make me rest until you're okay."
It's all your fault, Harry. It's all on you. "No." Harry said, clutching his head. Yes. "No, it's not my fault!" Harry shouted, tears rolling down his face and sweat dripping onto his bed. Harry felt someone grab his wrists and pull them away from his head. He looked up and saw a pair of grey eyes. "It's not your fault." They said.
Theirs was one of the few that had turned out correct. "Very good, very good. What do you smell Miss Granger?" Slughorn asked. "But, sir! Hermione got to smell it last time!" Pansy Parkinson interrupted. "Yes, but things you love can change as time grows. And five points from Slytherin for the interruption. Another five points taken for your pointless snickering, Mr Zabini." Slughorn smiled.
To say Sirius looked shocked was an understatement. "The- the Malfoy boy is your friend?" Harry gulped and stared past Draco. "Yes. But, Sirius, he-"
"I changed my mind!" Harry quickly said getting up. He didn't want anybody else getting hurt because of him. Harry made his way up to Barton who had an evil smirk plastered on his face. "Now Potter, this may tickle a little bit- CRUCIO!" Harry fell to the ground writhing in pain his whole body seizing up as he violently shook.
Sirius frowned at Harry. "Please, Harry. I need it to be you." Harry smiled sadly at Sirius, then nodded. "Okay then, if it means that much to you. Out of interest, how did you ask Mum and Dad?"
"Well, they were in boy-girl form." Ginny said abruptly, walked over with her arms crossed and a stern look on her face that made her look slightly like Molly Weasley. "Ginny! George said he misses you loads, he told me to tell you-" but Ron was interrupted with a smack across his face.
Harry stared at the letter in complete silence as into dropped into the bowl of waffles. "This has to stay between us all, okay?" Harry whispered. His friends all nodded and Hermione went to talk, but Harry cut her off. "We'll talk about it later." He muttered quickly, seeing McGonagoll walking quickly towards them. He shoved the letter in his bag then picked up his fork and started prodding at his bacon.
"We should go after them, they aren't exactly buddies, are they?" Ron said. "You will stay right where you are Weasley! Nobody else will leave this classroom until I say so, or you may just become a part of my demonstration like Potter was." Barton snarled and everybody stayed stiff in their seats.
Harry walked back out into the bedroom, but froze when he saw someone sitting on the other bed. "Who is that?" They asked and turned around. "Potter?"
It was a Halloween party, people would be wearing costumes! Nobody would know that it was them two together! He and Draco could go in disguise. But, he would still have to deal with Ginny first. He would go to the Gryffindor common room at lunch and speak to her.
"I did ask. Now hurry up, my lips are lonely!" Harry whined and with another eye roll, Draco connected his lips with Harry's. Dean and Seamus cooed and Hermione smiled, almost crying with happiness. Her best friend was with someone he truly loved and she didn't see them ever breaking up. But then again, she didn't think her and Ron would break up so soon either. As much as what he did was absolutely foul and evil and UGH! She couldn't help but still feel the smallest sliver of love him.
"Get him a cup of water," Draco ordered, taking Harry's robes off, then his top and taking mumbling calm things to him, mopping his body with the sponge. He held Harry close to him as he started to calm down and took the glass of water from the Weasley.
The boys headed back to the common room after having a small, early dinner together in the fort. "Honestly, I didn't know anybody could slurp spaghetti so loud," Draco teased, smirking at his blushing boyfriend. "Yeah, well at least I AM eating," muttered Harry. "And I'm proud of you." Draco grinned.
"Draco, are you okay?" Harry asked nervously. "Yes, why wouldn't I be?" He chuckled. "I just thought... The whole reason we were in our room that night... on Halloween, was because we had heard your father escaped from Azkaban. Have you heard anymore about it?" Harry questioned, looking into those bedazzling grey eyes.
Harry and Sirius looked around at the crowd of terrified students. A burst of anger and happiness flared up and Harry's voiced boomed over the whole hall. "Sirius Black is innocent!" He shouted over the crowd. "He was framed for those murders by Peter Pettigrew and then served for those crimes he did not commit. You have no need to fear him, I love him like I love my own father." The students blinked at Harry, silently stunned. "Well, wands away!" He cooed and wands went back in pockets, although gossiping students still looked scared.
Harry wrapped his arms around his chest, conscious of the other boy, staring at him, jaw open wide. "Potter, tell me who did this to you? Was it someone at school? Tell me now Potter!" He growled. Harry grabbed his clothes and ran for the bathroom. He shakily got changed and then slid down the wall, cowering in the corner. Tears slid down his face, recollecting the events of what happened at number 4 privet drive and the incident with his now apparent roommate.
Harry shivered slightly and Draco pulled him closer to him, warming him up a little bit. They were both being cautious but as far as they could see, nobody was around. Harry placed his head on Draco's shoulder and Draco kissed the top of Harry's head. "I wish we could be like this all the time," Harry whispered, his emerald green eyes meeting Draco's sparkling grey. Draco noticed that Harry's eyes weren't as bright as they used to be, they weren't full of hope anymore and it broke his heart. "It will be one day." Draco replied, though they both new that the future for them and any others like them, was uncertain.
WARNING: Bad language, Abuse, Eating Disorders, Depression, Suicide Attempt, Homophobia (Things get better).
"My name is Professor Barton and I will be your new defense against the dark arts teacher for this year. I do not tolerate silliness or bad work in my classroom and expect the best out of all of you." He said, writing his name on the chalk board. Harry was about to turn to Ron and make some silly retort, then remembered they weren't exactly on speaking terms.
Harry wanted to lash out at Ron, yell at him that there was nothing wrong about Malfoy liking boys. But instead, he chose the friendlier approach. "I don't see what you've got against gays?" He asked. "They're just people who love the same gender, it's not like it's a choice. You didn't choose to be straight, you just are. They didn't choose to be gay, it's just their lifestyle. Plus, wouldn't they be good to adopt the squibs and werewolves that have been abandoned by their parents?" Ron just shrugged, as if not giving two about what Harry has to say.
"Harry," Ron whispered softly. "Can I talk to you somewhere more private please?" Hermione was about to retort, but Harry interrupted her. "Sure." He said quickly, hoping to get out of there before Draco came in to eat. They left and just started walking in an unknown direction. "I'm really sorry, Harry. I had time to think after I left and I realised how stupid I was, especially after George came home from visiting you."
"Uh, hi Harry. Draco?" She said, watching the two of them. "Can I talk to you please Harry?" She asked. Harry nodded his head and dried his hands. With a quick glance back at Malfoy, Harry walked out with Hermione. "Are you okay Harry? I mean, really. You've seemed really off. We haven't done anything, have we?" She asked.
Harry kept his eyes closed and huddled into himself. It had been a long day and yet it wasn't even noon. Draco came up behind Harry and wrapped his arms protectively around him and muttered "none of them will hurt you anymore." Harry just nodded and leaned back into the blonde boy's embrace.
He opened them when he felt someone sit at the end of his bed. "I'm sorry, I must look pathetic," Harry mumbled. "No, I'm the one that's sorry. I got too carried away. I just get angry." Harry nodded and they sat in silence for a minute.
Harry found Ginny at lunch and made plans to meet up with her in the Gryffindor common room later that evening. That girl really did not know what she had coming.
"None of us have a choice when it comes to our scars you know." Harry pointed out, lifting his hair up and out the way, revealing the lightning bolt on his forehead. Draco nodded fervently. He lay down and put his head on Harry's lap. Harry closed his eyes and began running his hands through Draco's hair again.
"Someone has to be sensible here and make sure you all get to bed okay. Plus it wouldn't be very nice to not be able to find my way back to Gryffindor tower because I'm so drunk!" She insisted.
