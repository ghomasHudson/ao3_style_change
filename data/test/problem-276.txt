“No.” Malfoy was actively willing himself to calm down. Harry could see, could practically hear him counting down from ten in his mind over and over.
he says, ripping himself out of Harry’s lap, his wings flapping hard to propel him backwards and away until he hits the railing.
“He’s late,” Harry says, pacing back and forth across the parlour floor, hands clenching and unclenching at his sides. He’s been itchy all morning, a feeling of unease had settled somewhere along the back of his neck at dawn and taken root throughout the early hours. He can’t shake the sensation that something is wrong.
Luna nods, beaming at Hermione. “Exactly! No one knows what could have happened to make them leave.”
,” he says, desperate, quick and heated against Harry’s overheated skin. “I used to hate you. I wanted you gone. Erased from my memory. Then I realised that I was so affected by you because I
Harry felt a strange well of emotion bloom inside his chest and he let his head fall forward onto Malfoy’s shoulder, overwhelmed. He wasn’t sure if it was gratitude, relief, or perhaps a mixture of the two, but Harry knew definitively that he’d much rather be tethered to this whirling dervish of an aristocratic git than a splash of dried oil paint any day. Malfoy pulled once more on Harry’s hair, reminding him of their entwined positioning and Harry groaned, giving in. He turned his mouth to Malfoy’s neck, biting him in response.
“Mr Lovegood found her,” he tells Hermione, nodding his head in the direction of the kitchen, where Xenophilius has made himself at home brewing a pot of tea for everyone. Harry’s eyes are hard as flint as he looks at him. “He did it,” he says, voice low yet full of unrestrained emotion.
“We can!” he says, earnest and desperate, and endlessly stubborn. Leave it to Harry Potter to weather the storm in the most difficult and perilous way possible. He never did learn to ask for help when he needed it most, damn him.
“I haven’t shunned anything!” Harry says, stepping towards the man. How dare he make assumptions. Draco shoved him, not the other way around.
Maybe it’s the chill of the thin night air this high above the ground, or the sensation of Draco somehow being inside him and Harry not minding, but the thrill of flying quickly encompasses any semblance of Harry’s self-preservation. He manages to swallow his initial unease and directs Draco to where they’re staying on the island. Harry finds himself very thankful that the inhabited areas of Crete peppered between its many mountains are easily seen from above.
Xenophilius pulls her into his arms, tucking her head against his shoulder. “Shhh,” he soothes. “Shhhh, my love.”
“I miss her too, every day. Every minute.” Scorpius soothes, reading his pain like an open letter left carelessly on a desk.
There’s a hiss and a spiking of feathers when Harry makes contact with the man’s skin. Harry sits back, hands up in placation, ready to tell him that they mean him no harm. But then, the man raises his head up to look at Harry with an instantly recognizable quicksilver gaze, and for the second time that night, Harry is rendered speechless. His shock dies in his throat, unable to be voiced. He lands hard on the stone floor as he falls from his balanced crouch, the torch he carried clanking onto the marble and rolling away, out of sight.
Xenophilius tucks his chin and holds her face in his hands, staring down at her. “He didn’t mean to, of course, you realise. He wasn’t in his right mind. He’s a good son, I know he is. I do.”
The next hour is a blur as Scorpius drags him to the bathroom to wash, ordering Pip to draw him a bath, shouting down the hall over his shoulder as he goes that he’s making a batch of crepes and only “pleasant-smelling and well-dressed Malfoys are allowed chocolate-hazelnut spread on theirs!” Draco scowls into the murky haze of lavender-scented bathwater. His son is too much like him for his own good, but the taunt works. Draco is sitting before a neat trio of triangle folded crepes not a half-hour later, apricot compote and chocolate-hazelnut spread placed in neat ramekins at his elbow.
“After you, good sir,” Cameron says with a bow and a flourish, his dreads flopping into his face as he holds the door open for Harry, and Harry can’t help but grin at the man’s theatrics.
Draco’s mouth opens in surprise, the tip of his tongue teasing at his bottom lip. Harry remembers being a hair's breadth away from getting to feel the heat of that pink tongue against his own lips back on the beach that day, pressed tight against the rocks with nothing but sweat and a mountain of bitter history between them. He shakes himself, swallowing down the negative thought and focusing on the present.
Harry nods in silent agreement as Draco is rendered speechless, possibly for the first time in his life.
Hermione frowns at him, pouring milk into her tea. She’d just arrived at The Sanctuary that morning with Rose and Hugo for a weekend getaway while Ron visits Charlie in Romania. Draco has introduced the foal to Rose and Hugo, whom he’s named Cymopoleia after the ancient Greek goddess of violent seas, but calls Pol for short. They’re now off zooming about the back garden on brooms with the beast, Teddy standing guard and laughing at their antics just outside the door.
She pouts, abandoning the pastries. Patting him on the cheek, she soothes him, cooing softly in Italian. Draco’s shoulders visibly shift under his robe, posture slipping as he sighs at her lyrical speech. Cecilia steps closer still, plucking a pin from Draco’s hair and running her hands through it, working out the tangles. Harry watches as Draco wilts into her touch like a drop of melted cream descending from the rim of a gelato cone, cascading languid and sticky over Harry’s fingertips. Draco is so pliant, so accepting of affection that Harry balls his hands into fists, at once both envious and confused that he isn’t the one standing in Cecilia’s place. He’d come here to deliver pastries and hopefully make amends for his poor behaviour on the beach, and now here he is in Draco's bedroom, feeling jealous over Cecilia's abilities to render Draco speechless with a single touch.
Draco answers. His tongue is flat against the underside of Harry’s cock, his nose buried in his black curls, and when he drags his nails down along Harry’s thigh, Harry growls at the delicious sting.
“You may stay for assistance but I no longer trust your counsel, Madame. Do not touch my child again.”
“Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do,” Ron had said with a grin. Harry, neighing in return, knew what Ron had meant and loved him for it even more.
“Me too?” Harry calls after him. He sees Ron flip him a two-fingered salute through the warped glass of the leaded front window and laughs, revelling in the swelling of joy within him. He and Hermione break their embrace, wiping snotty noses on dusty sleeves before turning from each other, no words needed, and beginning the process of cleaning the old cottage of decades worth of neglect.
Hermione has no idea whether she’s being reprimanded or praised, but then, exactly what Mr Lovegood just said hits her, and everything Luna hinted at the other day at breakfast comes crashing down on Hermione’s shoulders like a ceiling made of stained glass.
Luna points, eyes still closed, and murmurs a spell. A beam of golden light erupts from her wand, pointing far across the forum, towards a looming structure in the distance. The sun has fallen behind the mountains now, leaving slashes of ominous red streaks against a hazy purple sky. Swallowing her nerves, Hermione pulls out her headlamp, straps it across her forehead, and allows Luna to guide the way into uncertainty.
Draco nods. “Quite.” He’s digging into his bag for the two-way mirror Scorpius gave him earlier that morning, already rehearsing the scolding he’s looking forward to giving the boy for his pranks when the door to the pub opens, bringing with it a gust of salt air.
Coughing into her fist as debris settles around them, Hermione scoffs at Luna’s assessment of their current situation. Considering the havoc they’ve managed to wreak within an hour of stepping foot in this ancient place, not pleasant is a bit too meek of a phrase.
Draco shifts his eyes over Harry’s shoulder, then steps back, gesturing to the room at large. “Let us continue the celebrations of this delightful new venture of yours back at mine, hm?”
“Understatement,” Hermione says, stepping up to Luna, scanning her body for any sort of injury, but they’re all remarkably sound, another indication that the wards are still (mostly) in place. She squeezes her hand, a quick gesture of affection, before turning back to Harry and Draco, who remain on the ground, though Harry seems to not have a say in the matter.
“Well, I’ve not much entertainment available to me just now. Your animalistic stalking of the perimeter is it, I’m afraid. So, the choices are either you stop your incessant pacing or you bear my continued glowering. Take your pick.”
“Draco?” he asks, his pulse quickening at the flush darkening Draco’s pale skin and the softness of Draco’s expression, how it melts the sharpness of his features into a beauty Harry cannot name. Draco smiles at Harry, his answer clear in his grey eyes, and leans forward to thread his hand into Harry’s hair, pulling him closer.
The shocked gasps of both Hermione and Luna sound behind them as Draco bends at the knee and leaps from the ground in one smooth motion up into the sky, his impressive wings pressing down on the humid air of the night with surprising force. The power Harry feels emanating from Draco as he holds him tight and close to his body is staggering. He’d barely been able to stand in the temple.
Cecilia lets his face go with a gentle slap to each cheek and Harry flushes at the contact, liking this woman more by the second. “I have to go upstairs and make sure Draco hasn’t wallowed himself into a stupor. Go make yourself scarce for an hour. Have a gelato or a drink. There’s a bar down there,” she points and Harry follows the line of her finger.
Draco’s company and wants to spend as much time with him as possible. He was the one to stay when he should have left that first night. He’d sought Draco out on that balcony, shared his cigarettes and laughed at his perverse antics. The confusion of their time on the beach and the uplifting visit from two days prior when Harry had dropped off pastries left him feeling hopeful yet uncertain of how to proceed.
Nico coos at Harry softly in her deep-voiced ennui as the vinyl spins, pulling him unwittingly back in time to when he was a broken little boy wanting nothing else than to be hugged by a man he barely knew, and thanks to the trappings of Fate, would never get a chance to fully know.
“I have no idea what you mean,” she calls as she pirouettes out of the room, proving Draco’s point. He sighs; the pair of them are impossible.
There’s a blush high on Draco’s cheeks. Harry finds he likes the look on him. He leans forward, grabs Draco’s hand in his own, strokes the back of his knuckles with his thumb. “It takes more than death to get rid of me, Draco. You know that.”
“Oh.” Harry turns back to the girl and shrugs, giving her another smile. She giggles, pointing to his left hand. “I like your dragon.”
“Fuck, this is what I wanted. This is what I was thinking that first night on the balcony,” Harry says, turning them on the bed and hitching his leg higher over Draco’s hip. Draco arches into him and drags his nails down Harry’s back.
This question is met with a noncommittal shrug. Draco waits for more but Hermione remains stubbornly quiet, sipping her tea. Draco feels untethered in that moment, loose amongst the tide and not comfortable without having a solid grounding under his feet.
Draco’s lips quirk into a grin and he snorts out what can only be a laugh. It startles both Hermione and Harry, but it strangely warms something inside Hermione to see Draco smile. It proves to her that he’s still human.
Harry smacks him hard, hearing the crack of his hand slapping against Draco’s arse ripple across the night sky. Draco drops his head with a groan and shifts, thrusting against the leather. “Such a bastard you are,” Harry says, rubbing his hand over where he’d struck.
Draco straightens his robes and looks warily at the Wizarding section of the tiny fishing village he’s landed in, knowing full well his aristocratic features and finely-tailored clothes mark him as incongruous in such a setting. Not wanting to draw attention to himself, he steps quickly into a public house at the end of the lane to ask the bartender for directions to the nearest Portkey office.
The corner of Harry’s eyes prickle with a telltale sting and he scrubs at his face, dislodging his glasses. He takes a moment to wipe them clean on his shirt, pretending that his bowed head is concentration, not sorrow.
“What good is clever magic if it can’t heal him?” She tugs on her sleeve, itchy in her own skin. “I  feel useless,” Narcissa admits, bringing her arms up tight across her middle as if she could keep herself together by sheer force of will. She bows at the waist, overcome. She’s so tired.
Hermione and Harry lock eyes over Luna’s shoulder, eyebrows raised in mirrored looks of bewilderment.
Harry feels a nip against his neck and arches off the bed. Draco shifts to sit astride him, long pale limbs weighing Harry into the warm sheets, the space between their bodies slowly disappearing as Draco lowers himself down, down . . . down.
Draco’s pouring milk into his tea on his first morning at The Sanctuary when the door to the kitchen bangs open. It takes every remaining vestige of his pureblood upbringing to remain standing and not crumple in shock, shattering the stoneware urn in his hands and landing on the floor in an undignified heap. It’s a near thing but he just manages.
Hermione looks at Ron, her expression pointed before turning back to Harry. “When you asked for the books, Harry, I became curious. Naturally I had to read them first in order to ensure their quality. That research got me thinking—”
Hermione knows he’s attempting to remove himself from the situation to keep from accidentally hexing Xenophilius into the next century, but she still wishes he’d learn to keep better control of his temper. Beside her, the candlesticks burst into flame, their wicks spluttering and burning down entirely too quickly towards the base.
“Hey!” Ron yelps through his beak and Harry snorts, downing his firewhiskey and relinquishing his glass to the kitchen bench.
Teddy shakes his head. “She’s struggling, don’t know why,” he calls back before dipping below the foal and shooting a levitation charm at her. It works for a few minutes, her wings righting themselves enough to catch the breeze but then she dips again, closer to the waves once more. Draco, too nervous and too new to this experience to know better, dives to follow, attempting the same charm but it doesn’t take. Teddy flies to his side, shouting something to him but he can’t hear over the wind and the waves and he’s too concerned for the foal to care.
With blunt fingertips, he rips off the sodden bandage and tosses it into the sink. It lands with a sickening thwack against the white porcelain, vibrant with fresh blood. Harry blinks at it bleary-eyed, wondering why he’s still bleeding. Hermione healed it, didn’t she? He can’t remember now.
He finds the railing and leans heavily onto it with his forearms, allowing the relief of fresh air to soothe his feverish skin. He looks out over the water, letting the swirling clouds and the electrical storm hypnotise him into a lulled sense of normalcy. None of today had been normal. And what Harry feels right now, the prickling sweat on his skin, the shivers running up and down his spine, is definitely not normal. He should be more alarmed at what’s happening to him, but he’s too exhausted to bother.
He turns, walking away quickly. Draco’s collarbones can burn in the sun for all his cares. Harry can’t be around that cream-coated tongue and candy-floss hair a moment longer. He needs solace from Draco Malfoy and his omnipresence on this sweltering island in the middle of the blasted sea. He ignores the shouts of
Behind them, Cecilia crows with joy and runs down the hall, shouting loudly and expressively in Italian for Cameron to come see the happy couple. Harry has no time to bother listening to their excitement, he’s too busy pulling Draco in for a kiss.
Harry scoffs and transfigures two nearby sticks into a pair of trainers and slips them on. Luna is already jogging down the hill, assuming he’ll follow, no doubt.
Hermione could kill Harry, she really could. He’s always been a bit of an idiot, but it’s truly shocking to realise just how much of a daft prick he can actually be, considering the man brought down Voldemort at seventeen. Why on earth would he ever let Draco get that close to him? Turning that line of questioning on herself, she wonders why she and Luna ever thought leaving them alone together was advisable? The answer seems obvious enough, considering Harry can usually handle things, and Draco’s little flight of fancy earlier hadn’t ended in bloodshed. She curses her own idiocy at letting this happen as she runs towards Harry’s fallen form on the rocks, wet hair slapping against her shoulders and bare feet stinging from the harsh pavement. Draco’s a cowering mass of feathers and limbs just beside him and she ignores him in favour of assessing Harry’s wound.
Harry blinks, stunned at such a Muggle word escaping Draco’s perfectly pureblood mouth. Draco flushes red at Harry’s reaction and narrows his eyes.
“My point is,” Harry continues, “that I could never tell if they were male or female or both or neither, they’re simply beautiful as they are, no matter what that is, no name needed. And I’ve always liked that.”
“Quite.” Draco smooths his palms over his trousers and looks to Teddy for guidance. “Should I change or will my current attire do for mucking about with beasts?”
“Brilliant!” Cameron exclaims and then divests Draco of his robe so quickly he feels spellstruck. “To the rocks!”
There’s a breeze coming from a pair of French doors left open, the curtains billowing out along the floorboards like ghostly tendrils of magic after a duel. Harry steps forward, unbidden, feeling drawn to the embrace of those curtains and the glass doors beyond. He smells the char of something sweet, like a campfire, and sees the glowing bud of a single source of light in the darkness.
Harry quickly pulled completely into the embrace and almost stood on his toes to get closer. Draco captured him even harder and spread his large hands across Harry’s back, bringing their chests in so tightly. Feeling troubling breathing Harry took a deep gasp away before latching on to him again.
Opening the dorm room, Draco wandlessly spelt a warm fire to appear in the stone fire pit, before lighting the candles.
“He is a really good friend,” Harry smiled sadly. “But he shouldn’t have to keep away from Zabini because of me.”
Harry looked deep into the silver blue eyes of the animal as he gently placed his hand on the muzzle. The movement beneath his hand seemed so captivating as he stroked the soft mare. From afar all the unicorns seemed the same color of silver and white but now as he studied the creature closer, he could see the slight hint of blue in her mane. Smiling, he turned to see Jason standing a few feet behind him. The boy seemed… at unease. Still gently stroking the animal’s face, he asked if Jason was all right. The Slytherin just nodded with an impish smile.
“Ah yes. I remember you.” Luna turned to the oliveskinned boy. “You almost choked on a cookie last year.”
There’s a hand on his cheek, cool and black, cupping his jaw. His thumb rubs over Harry’s swollen lower lip, dipping into his mouth. Harry pulls it in with his tongue, tasting the salt of his skin. Draco smiles at him, sweet and small, an unexpected expression of tenderness that burns in Harry’s heart.
Sighing, Luna stands, deciding that a bracing cup of peppermint tea will keep her hands occupied elsewhere.
“Mmmm,” Harry hums, his smile broadening as his hand moves to stroke Draco’s hair. It’s grown long and sleek in the four years since the war. Harry likes the way it looks fanned across his bedsheets or, on occasion, wrapped around his fist.
Potter. How bloody typical. Of course you’d let Cameron drool all over you, it’s just like you to bask in such attention. No wonder you’ve covered yourself in all that disgusting Muggle ink.” He flips a limp wrist in Harry’s direction, just as Cecilia and Cameron come to Harry’s defence with "It’s not disgusting!" and, "Don’t be rude, Dee!"
Draco crows, his head flying back as his hips stutter with his orgasm. Harry feels the rhythmic pulse of it as Draco releases into Harry’s mouth, the sea-salt tang of his come coating his tongue.
Harry presses his forehead to the cool pane of the front door, glasses clinking against the surface. “Draco,” he whispers, breath fogging the glass. There’s a light in his mind’s eye, faded and small. He squeezes his eyes shut, straining to see it more clearly, but it fizzles even as he reaches for it, stuttering and weak.
“On it,” she says, and is off to their bedroom in a swirl of blonde hair. Hermione laments the loss of her heat beside her but then, Harry is there, arms crossed, face stern, staring down at the elf with a mixture of concern and suspicion.
He trails off without finishing his thought. Minutes pass with nothing but the two of them huddled close, breathing each other in and smiling. The silence blooms between them, familiar and comfortable, like a warm blanket for two, before Draco snorts, inelegant and oh-so-human. He pulls back and prompts, “Tell you what, exactly?”
Draco scowls at her over the rim of his glass. “I blame the Weasleys. And yes, I’m including you for contributing to the horde. Scorpius would be a testament to Slytherin’s name if not for the influence of Victoire and Rose.”
Harry lifts his head ever so slightly, wondering why Draco is not in his room, why the wards they’d placed on his door and the house didn’t work. Harry had checked them himself before he’d turned in for the night, and they were strong, secure.
Sighing, Hermione pushes her glasses to the top of her head. “No.” She looks at the mess she’s made spread out before her on the desktop and then returns her gaze to Luna, suddenly fierce. “This has nothing to do with not trusting your father.”
Harry lifts his head, Draco can feel the warm loss of Harry’s lips against his skin and whimpers at their retreat. He’s asking Xenophilius what Draco means, why he’s saying he ‘won’t take it,’ and Draco can hear Xenophilius spouting his reasons, knows them by heart: he must take the potion or end up just like his father.
They come to a hard stop on the soft ground near a gurgling stream. Narcissa tosses the long plait of her blonde hair over her shoulder, taking in their surroundings and wondering how this vacant valley will ever help her son. Beside her, Xenophilius is standing very still, singing a soft lullaby into the hazy, humid air. Narcissa grabs his arm in shock as soon as she sees the fabric of the valley rip open before her, revealing the ruins of a once magnificent ancient city.
A bewildered-looking Scorpius pokes his head out from behind the parlour room door, brows furrowed. “Papa?”
Draco tucks Harry’s hair behind his ear. Then combs the tangles back off his forehead for him. Harry tries his best not to sigh and lean into the touch, but his eyes fall closed without his say so.
“Liar,” Harry says, pressing Draco’s arm further against his back. Draco arches in response, seeking relief.
“Thank you for the tea,” Luna says to her father, in an attempt to restore a sense of normalcy to the room. She places Hermione’s Healer bag down on the table and steps forward to hug Xenophilius. Hermione doesn’t waste a moment, pulling the bag close and digging around in its extendable depths for what Luna suspects to be a reviving potion for the elf. Luna also sees Hermione pull out a soothing draught and takes a hasty sip of her own before tossing it to Harry. He snatches it out of the air but doesn’t partake. Instead, he hands it back over his shoulder to Draco, who also refuses. Luna shakes her head at both of them.
Neville tries admirably to help Harry to a standing position, but there's a rather lot of flailing and giggling involved in the process. Harry shoves his hair off his forehead for the twentieth-eighth time that night, lamenting its length, just as the bell chimes above the front door.
Luna leads Hermione wherever she fancies, and Hermione follows along without complaint. She takes pleasure in viewing the untouched landscape of the island through the lens of her Muggle camera and happily captures countless images of Luna’s beautiful white-gold ringlets peppered with wildflowers blowing in the wind on film.
Cameron, oblivious to this discussion, continues snapping away with his camera trained on them. He’s directing over the sound of the crashing waves, calling out to:
She stands from her stool, stepping between his legs to rub at his shoulders, to get his blood flowing once more. She ducks her head, seeks out his gaze, and smiles at him, encouraging and earnest.
His eyes are closed but he can sense the shadow that looms above him, knowing that Draco has moved from his seated position beside him. He blinks, his eyelids heavy from the heat. Draco stands over him, naked and shamelessly holding his cock—the shining head flushed red and surrounded by Draco’s long, inky fingers, glowing blue in the moonlight. Harry stares boldly, his mouth open and hungry. Draco twists his wrist and a strangled groan passes his lips, the sound causing Harry’s erection to twitch against his fist. Harry reaches out his free hand, wanting to touch, and Draco lets him.
“He never hurt me,” Narcissa says, voice fierce. Xenophilius wipes away the tears on her cheeks with the pads of his thumbs.
Hermione drops her hand from her mouth, a look of awe on her face. Then confusion. “But, how does Draco—“
Draco breathes out a gasp, laying his hand flat over the scar, and touches his forehead to the horse’s bowed head.
“I still have questions for you, Mr Lovegood,” she calls back down the stairs. Their conversation is most certainly not over.
“Brute force.” With a final heaving shove and an ominous scrape against the flagstones the door springs free of its long-lodged position, opening up into a dusty main room of the thatched cottage the Black family has apparently owned for generations.
Draco’s stomach muscles tense on a gasp as he finally comes to rest against Harry’s hips. Elegant hands move to Harry’s chest, fingernails scratching over the hair he finds there, teasing. It tickles. Harry can see the strain in Draco’s face, the beads of sweat on his brow, he’s holding back from what he wants, and Harry can’t have that. He tugs on Draco’s arms, pulling him forward so Harry can brace his legs against the duvet and take control.
“Oh no,” Luna breathes, seeing the broken little figure of an elf in her father’s arms. He’s cradling the creature to him as if she were a baby, and Luna’s heart breaks at the sight of her father’s gentle reverence. He always loved magical creatures.
Fireworks go off, lighting up the white facade of the Doge’s Palace and the red brick of Campanile with sparks of blue and gold, much to the enjoyment of the crowd. The
Once again, Hermione tries to console Harry but he steps back, shrugging off her attempts at comfort. How can he allow himself comfort when Draco’s wrapped in a sheet on the floor, barely existing? It does not escape Harry’s notice that he’s yet to speak a single word to any of them. And if he was trapped here to prevent him from doing harm to himself, Harry doesn’t even want to imagine what’s behind that horrible mask. A pang cuts through the mania of his thoughts at the idea of Draco’s achingly beautiful features, so perfectly his own, somehow marred. The crystal clear memory of the last time Harry saw that face, eyes twinkling with promise as he dashed out the door, flashes through Harry’s mind without warning, and it’s as if the wind has been knocked clean out of him.
“Not like what?” Harry asks, lost in a haze of booze and anonymity, enjoying the ease with which he can flirt with this surprising stranger. People press in on all sides around them, their body heat, painted masks, corsets and crinoline and cries of enjoyment, an almost suffocating mix of decadent debauchery. Harry’s heart rate soars in the chaos.
He thrusts back once, twice, and a third time, pounding the mattress with his fist as his entire body is wracked with his orgasm.
“Fucking hell,” Harry curses to the sky. The heat of Draco’s mouth is dizzying. The two of them are a powder keg, ready to combust. Something must be wrong. They shouldn’t both be this overheated, but all Harry can focus on is the pulsating rhythm and suction of Draco’s mouth on him.
Harry’s smiling. That’s the only part of his body he’s aware of; his idiotic, sluggish smile as soft wings wrap around him, and a warming charm passes over him, drying his damp skin.
Draco scowls harder, glaring behind his shades at Cameron from two spots over, where he’d been placed ten minutes prior, Cameron chattering endlessly about the creamy complexion of his skin glowing in the afternoon sun, and how it’d be a beautiful juxtaposition against Harry’s naturally darker skin tone. Draco’s draped in another one of his silk kimonos; he has quite the collection, thanks to his mother. This particular piece boasts the hyper-saturated hues of tangerine, jade, and ochre that fit right in with the sandy, subversive aesthetic Cameron is attempting to achieve. Draco does lament leaving his Muggle timepiece back in the flat. The leather strap and circular face would have been an unexpected casual twist to his sartorial elegance.
“Harry,” Draco whines, eyes shut tight and hips move backwards against Harry’s face. He feels the rasp of Harry’s stubble and warmth of his breath blowing against him as he pulls back to tease Draco’s rim with the barely-there touch of a single finger.
Luna crouches close to them and coos at Draco, a soft gentle trill of a sound that Hermione has never heard her make before.
“No, fuck you. Do you know how close I was to losing you just now? How sharp the rocks are; how strong the current is? There’s a reason we don’t fly down that low and your chattering teeth and bloodied body are proving my point for me,” Harry spits, looking Draco up and down with a mixture of rage and terror.
Thank you so much to M0stlyvoid for beta'ing this piece, being the zen master of commas, and talking me through my insecurities over writing PWP without the annoying addition of feels. I appreciate you so much, beb!! Thanks again!
Charlie’s calling out after him, but Harry can’t hear him over the roar of the engine and the racing of his own heart—the bitter taste of adrenaline thick on his tongue. He shoots into the sky, closing his eyes against the crisp sting of the morning mist, allowing it to cleanse him of his anger.
Harry doesn’t get an answer to this question, either. He hears footsteps running towards them as soon as they’ve entered the main hall and turns in time to see Hermione flinging herself down a grand staircase, face shining in the dim light.
Harry pets Draco’s hair and listens to his gentle sighs as Draco breathes deep and warm against Harry’s chest. The tickle of Draco’s long fingers snake low across his stomach, tracing patterns onto Harry’s skin. He’s murmuring words Harry can’t hear but they’re soothing when paired with the tease of his fingertips.
“He’s alive!” is all she says before she’s pulling Harry into Side-Along Apparation with a twist of her wrist, and Harry’s world turns black.
he curses out onto the biting wind as the waves crash along the rocky shore bleow, sending up sea spray to meet him on the breeze. He hopes Harry can hear him back on the balcony, left all alone with his erection flagging in his jeans, and his pouting lips mumbling over what he suspects he did wrong.
There was one moment of apprehension when they had arrived, as there always is when Harry dares to strip down to his trunks in public—people tend to stare. Harry’s gotten really good at wandless Notice-Me-Not charms over the years, but for some reason they never work quite as well abroad. After his first three cocktails, however, he’s relaxed considerably. General whispered comments about his neck-to-toe ‘tattoos’ simply wash off his shoulders like a wave retreating on the sand.
Potter pushes past the curtains, lunch tray floating beside him, and silently directs the tray to Draco’s bedside table with a flick of his wrist.
, and an Auror appears almost directly at Potter’s side, an unconscious, redheaded child in his arms.
“Oh! Healer Soto, before I forget: I wrote a letter to my mother,” he says, grasping the folded paper from his bedside table and holding it out. “Could you owl it to her?”
He glances from the right to the left, trying to decide which direction to go. He has no idea where the potions storeroom is, though he imagines that it’s close by, considering that each ward has its own storeroom.
“Huh,” he mutters. Someone should probably be fired for putting up the new wards wrong, because they clearly forgot to close some sort of loophole that allows patients in.
his glasses, considering that he can see floors and walls alright, and what else does he really need to be able to walk?
. Perhaps Bryn’s comforting words helped get him there, and Potter was the last push. Because he says it like it’s a secret only the two of them are in on. And, Merlin if that’s not dramatic, but Draco can’t help it. Something about Potter seems to bring out that side of himself.
Cuthbert, who falls asleep mid-conversation in an armchair by the fire, and Harry has the dreadful suspicion that it might even be the armchair he died in. The thought makes him so uncomfortable that he’s relieved when Binns falls asleep, slipping over to the refreshments table for a snack.
He stares for a moment at the off-white curtains around his bed, trying to recall anything about what happened and why he’s here. He’s only able to conjure up hazy memories of hurriedly scrawling his name at the end of a short note, sending it off with an owl during a storm, and a grim-looking man in red.
After all, he’s said it a million other ways, through little rose gold tins and blankets thrown over lean shoulders when fires start dying.
“You should come with us, Ferret-face,” Fred says, draping an arm over Draco’s shoulder, who grumbles at the touch.
It’s different from Pepperup Potions, but not so different that Harry can’t grasp it after watching Draco do it. It requires some concentration and an incantation, and the lab quickly grows hot from the fires and slight magical exertion — and a fair amount of it might also be from being so close to Draco.
“I’m glad to hear that, Draco. I’m sorry to say I have to be going now, but we’ll meet again, alright?” they say sincerely.
Harry lands in the alley beside The Three Broomsticks, arms still around Draco. He curses at the unexpected snow, the world spinning a little. Draco’s eyes
Draco thinks that he probably won’t leave the memories for anything, even if they are completely horrible, but keeps the thought to himself.
“No. Not to the brain specialist,” Narcissa replies vaguely. “Do you remember the letter you sent me a few hours before you were attacked?”
He can easily make out his few dreamless sleep vials and the Marauder’s Map, the colours stark against the dark wood. The map, especially, has been quite handy as a professor, particularly when Teddy was still a student and in his trouble-making phase. Harry pushes aside the bittersweet reminder that he’s no longer Teddy’s professor, and continues to search for his glasses in the other drawers, and around the floor.
“Enjoying the party so far?” George asks, side-stepping his twin to clap Draco on the back. Draco quirks on eyebrow and shrugs off the touch, and George just grins.
The mandrakes are dealt with by ten. They drink tea over conversation and soft laughter. Then, they cast warming charms and step out of the humid greenhouse.
“Taking over. Right,” he says bitterly. Potter takes a slow breath and exhales steadily, gaze turned towards the ceiling.
He opens his mouth to ask if Draco wants another cup, but the words die in his mouth when he sees that Draco is asleep, chin resting on his hand. Warmth floods through Harry at the sight, and the simple fact that Draco could even fall asleep like that in front of
. He went through a time-travel related accident, and now his leg below his knee spontaneously phases in-between times, which is extremely painful for him and causes rapid blood loss.
In his haste to pass Wagner’s office by, he didn’t notice that Rue is already awake and staring at him. He freezes when he sees her, heart plummeting. He doubts that she’d say anything to any of the healers about him leaving—seeing as he’s never seen her speak at all—but she could very well just be shy.
“No need to extend me such pleasantries, my dear girl, no need. I am here to help.” He flicks his wand over his shoulder and the front door slams shut, taking the roar of the wind with it and leaving a chasm of silence in its stead.
“You say that as if I’m some chatty gossip just wasting my time snickering away over a garden fence with the neighborhood cat lady.” The colour had returned to Malfoy’s cheeks. He shoved the fringe that had fallen into his face back off his smooth forehead. “I simply enjoy expressing myself and sharing the hard-earned knowledge that I have gleaned over my many years of stu—”
“We’re fine!” he barks, then quiets his voice. “See?” Harry steps back and runs a hand through his hair, allowing the women to witness Draco, fully nude and erect behind him.
Harry barely registers her warning before the large sleeping form of a feral Veela tenses and springs at Harry as soon as he’s within arms reach.
“Fuck.” Harry turns back around. He’d leant on that bridge earlier in the day, had enjoyed the view, the solitude, felt a little zing of pleasure at the prospect of getting a leg over. Apparently, so does everyone else who sets foot on the damn thing. Funny, that.
Feeling his fingers prickle at the memory, Harry comes back to himself at the sound of Draco’s voice. To Harry’s astonishment, he’s attempting to apologise for disturbing him.
Draco nods and easily straddles the bike with his long legs, making a picture of himself on the leather of the seat. Harry takes a moment to openly stare, shocked at his beauty. Draco raises an arched brow.
Staring down at the water, he tells Draco no, voice raw from smoke. If the sounds coming from Draco are any indication, he's enjoying the pastries enough for both of them. Harry rubs at the bridge of his nose with his forefinger and thumb, wondering what had possessed him to put himself in this position of utter torture. He casts about, desperately seeking a change of topic, anything that doesn’t include Harry having to think about Draco’s mouth.
, something frivolous Harry chose to decorate himself with. As if he’s ever cared that much about his own appearance.
“Fuck me, please,” he keeps repeating, lost in his need. Harry leans down, spits, and watches it land on the furl of Draco’s arse as it twitches. He rubs his thumb over it, presses in and hears Draco’s cry in response. “More!”
Draco inclines his head in thanks and makes an awkward little choking sound after taking a sip. He turns to Harry, looking terribly offended, and terribly guilty for being offended, simultaneously.
More neat piles line up beside the first, along with a small collection of mosaic tile that Xenophilius explains would be lovely in the guest bath at the Manor. Luna turns to Harry with raised eyebrows, only to see a mirrored look of surprise on his own face.
He knows at that moment that such a fate is no longer acceptable for him; that his life is worth more than the grief that’s plagued him; that Gabrielle would have wanted more for him, that Harry and Scorpius and Hermione and Fleur still want more for him.
“You talk about him as if he’s some rabid creature.” Harry’s hand comes up to grip Draco’s forearm that lays tight across Harry’s chest. “You’re wrong. He’s not a fucking mutation. He’s Draco.”
Harry blinks at how crass that act seems coming from Draco’s posh mouth, then bends at the hip with a grimace, a cramp forming in his side. Luna places a hand on his shoulder and hands him a ginger mint.
“I can’t.” Malfoy’s hands moved to clasp against his throat and chest as he heaved in large gulps of air. “It’s too much.” The colour was high on his cheeks, his neck flushed with blotches of pinked skin.
“Whatever you wish,” Xenophilius consoles, petting her hair and holding her close. “We’ll get through this together, my love. We will.”
“Hey, it’s okay,” he consoles, shifting closer. “I don’t mind.” Harry moves to pull Draco’s left arm towards him, the large yellowed face of the wristwatch Harry took from Dudley’s old bedroom when he was only twelve winking up at him from its place on Draco’s slim wrist. It’d stopped working when Harry had to dive into the lake during the Tri-Wiz tournament in fourth year, but he remembers leaving it at the breakfast table one morning in fifth, never to be seen again. He’d assumed the house-elves had Vanished it along with his leftover toast.
Harry looks at the other professors as Draco starts to tear open the paper, spotting Firenze immediately. He seems delighted in receiving a bad tie, putting it on over the one he’s already wearing, and Harry laughs. Minerva is wearing a new hat, Filius is cracking open a watercolour pan, Sinistra and Hooch have disappeared — Harry can guess where to — and Cuthbert is still asleep with a wrapped package beside him.
The corners of her lips pull down slightly, but the frown dissipates quickly, replaced by a sympathetic smile. “It’s okay, love. You’re in St. Mungo’s. Can you tell me the last thing you remember?”
Again, much love to J, lastontheboat, for the beta. You're the best! I don't know what I'd do without you.
Harry grins, leaving Draco to greet his mother as he hugs Ron, taking care not to touch his dough-covered hands.
According to the notice, the potions thief is still working inside St. Mungo’s, and keys people into the wards on the storerooms. Draco frowns when he thinks about it. The only reason they would do that would be if they weren’t working alone.
“Hello,” Draco greets cordially. The new patient turns his gaze away, not responding, and Gilderoy, who is sitting beside him, pipes up.
a little harsh, ‘Mione,” Ron agrees, and Hermione raises her eyebrows incredulously. Ron immediately goes back to kneading the dough, clearing his throat. “Sorry mate, you’re on your own.”
Bryn’s eyes soften, and he wonders if his nervousness is evident in his voice. “Are you comfortable with me using this spell on you today?”
“Is that making sense?” Bryn asks gently, and Draco only nods in response. “This spell may take a while to gather all of that data. Probably ten or so minutes. You may feel a warm sensation in your head and neck, and that is completely normal, but please let me know if you feel any pain, alright?”
“Oh, fine. I came to ask if you’re busy tomorrow,” Draco answers. “Longbottom and I are heading to Hogsmeade.”
Draco shoots up in bed, drenched in sweat and heart racing. He immediately tears at his sleeve, his entire body trembling, but there’s only the normal faded Dark Mark. Nothing moving, no burning sensations. He falls back onto his pillows with a relieved sigh, closing his eyes and taking deep, calming breaths.
He eyes them, wondering what to do with them, before he glances at the clock. It’s a quarter to four, and—seeing an opportunity—he decides to head to Soto’s office.
And across from them, standing in the center of a long line of darkly dressed wixes, is a tall, pale wizard, eyes glowing red and thin lips stretched into a terrifying smile.
“Sorry?” he asks. Agnus waves a dismissive hand and barks a few times, waving him off. A warm, fuzzy feeling in his chest, he obediently returns to his bed when Agnes barks at him to leave.
Few students remain for Christmas, the Great Hall nearly empty. Harry sits beside Neville, admires the decorations, and tries not to stare at Draco.
“I’m pretty sure he’s already left with Blaise,” he responds, and he can feel Draco’s laughter, more so than hear it.
He retreats back to bed with a frown, picking up his sign language book once again, but it’s pointless. He can’t focus, and after a few minutes, he can hear a set of heavy footsteps nearing his cubicle. He doesn’t recognize them, so it’s either the new patient, or Merlin forbid,
There’s a knock on the door just as his stomach starts to settle, and he flushes the sick away, taking quick, uneven breaths.
The next two days bring rain and listlessness as Draco waits for Narcissa’s response to arrive, spending his time going over sign language and the case. His mood is worsened by the fact that he hasn’t really interacted with anyone since Potter became his healer, and he’s starting to miss the friendly banter with Agnes and Gilderoy.
He knows what she looks like from photographs, and corresponded with her through letters, but it’s different in person. She seems more real. More human.
He remembers how badly Soto’s hands were shaking earlier when she came out of the office, and this must be the reason. He’d probably be shaken too if he was a healer in her position, but he decides not to dwell on it while still in her office.
Draco blanches, but Potter doesn’t even notice. He’s already turned away, ambling back down the corridor towards the staircase. He doesn’t even spare a glance over his shoulder.
“Oh no, you wait until she nicks your pants,” Draco replies. There’s a faint note of embarrassment in his voice. “And
Soto shoots him a disapproving glance as she places fresh robes next to the tray, and Draco remembers too late that she doesn’t take kindly to complaints or insults against other patients. Something about having sympathy for those who share your misfortunes. Distinctly uncomfortable, he turns his gaze to his lap.
He startles when Agnes suddenly starts barking, much louder than she usually does. He winces—the noise is grating, even through the door.
Their fingers brush, and Harry’s skin burns from it. The touch is gentle but undeniably there, and it almost makes Harry shiver before he gets control of himself. He puts his glasses on and blinks as Draco comes into focus. He’s surprised to see that Draco’s cheeks and ears are flushed.
Narcissa hums in thought, studying him intently. Draco feels like squirming under her gaze, flattening the wrinkles in his robes that are bunched on his legs. He feels her eyes following his movements and resists the urge to freeze.
And so Harry thinks of Draco, and yearns, and wishes, and remembers a million gentle smiles and a thousand glances that have spoken so loud without saying anything Harry can understand.
Bryn hums and turns to the counter, tapping their wand on the small stack of papers, which separate themselves into two different stacks. They tuck their wand away and jot something down on their clipboard.
It’s light and thin, a leather cord wrapped around it. The corners of the cover are curled in slightly, and the pages are faintly yellowing. He hesitates when he reaches to untie the cord, nervous for what he might find in the pages of the journal. He fears seeing too much or not being able to understand it, or even worse: finding empty pages, his hopes dashed to bits.
Draco’s lips twitch, but he doesn’t smile. He tugs on his sleeve for a moment as he tries to decide whether to confide in her about yesterday or not.
Harry wakes, shivering, to the early morning light and a dying fire. He rolls over in bed with a groan, cursing the cold stone of the castle, and his bed, too, for being so large and empty as it is.
The rest of the place makes it even worse, though. While his bedroom seems strange without Isabelle, the rest of his quarters are even worse without
Draco self-consciously flattens his hair and smooths out his robes before he goes to Agnes’s bed. He doesn’t bother putting on slippers, though. Socks are quieter.
“I can assure you, it was,” Potter replies, tone oddly restrained. Draco eyes him suspiciously—and now
give me a wrong potion that could’ve poisoned me if I’d been any less lucky,” Draco points out, and Agnes lets out an angry huff, starting to write her response before Draco is finished speaking.
from the flaming hat—and everything happens so quickly and at the same time that Draco almost doesn’t see Potter roll from the giant man’s arms.
His hands are sweaty, but so are Potter’s, and it’s not as nice as he expected. But at the same time, it’s
“Draco looks nice, don’t you think?” Neville asks with a smirk. Harry wants to scowl at him, and just barely refrains.
It’s stopped snowing by the time lunch rolls around, but it’s no less cold in the castle. Harry leaves the heat of the fire in his office with a mournful look and walks down to the Great Hall for lunch. He shivers, casting warming charms as he goes.
He finds himself unable to reply as they walk to the second floor, eyes trained on Draco’s neck and wandering places they shouldn’t be, mentally scolding himself every time they do. Neville, thankfully, picks up a conversation with Draco himself.
Merlin, Draco. Harry can barely even get a proper sentence out around him. His cheeks are flushed, eyes practically burning beneath long eyelashes, voice low, standing close to Harry.
. But it doesn’t, and Draco crumbles the parchment and throws it in the trash bin. He places his head in his hands, trying to slow his racing mind.
They begin to slowly walk into the hall together as Harry smiles. “I’m surprised she didn’t do it again, honestly.”
Agnes scribbles. He reads the note and laughs far too loudly to be appropriate in a ward full of sick patients.
“Harry, since you’re not busy, I’d be glad for some help with bottling the Skele-Gro,” Draco says, and Harry’s pulse jumps. Neville tries, and fails, to not smirk, and Harry has half a mind to elbow him the same way
He gives her a significant look that he’s sure she’ll figure out the meaning of, and after a long second, Agnes lets out a breath. It’s disappointed and amused all at once.
He cracks an eyelid open, squinting up at a dark-haired witch in lime green robes through bleary eyes. She’s muttering spells under her breath, a clipboard and quill floating beside her, her wand moving in steady motions.
“Help!” someone in the ward screams, the sound horrible and agonized and pleading, jolting Draco from sleep with a gasp.
Draco rolls up his sleeves, pulling a hair tie from his wrist and holding it with his teeth as he twists his hair into a bun. Harry watches. Once, it would have been hard to look away from Draco’s forearm, but now, it’s hard to look away from his hands deftly twirling his hair.
true, and the words stick with him the rest of the day. He watches Draco and Narcissa most of the night, fitting right in with the Weasleys. The younger ones, especially, love Narcissa — probably because Draco is their professor, so that makes him less cool to talk to, and it’s likely that Rose is digging for embarrassing stories about Draco.
He blinks at them. Thinks of how Potter likely lied about what spell he used on Draco the other day. Remembers how Soto never explained any of the charms she used. He wonders how he could have been comfortable with that, at all.
“-BUT if it had and Aodhan had been too late? Who could possibly imagine what could have happened? What if the spider had killed you and Aodhan had hit you trying to protect ye? The entire wizarding world would have been after the head of whoever they thought had hurt ye. Aodhan could have gotten into a lot of trouble, he could, and I would never forgive me’self if I thought I was the cause of you getting hurt.”
After the next two men in front of him had finally left, Severus was the only person left in the shop. The cashier was obviously a young man with brown curly hair and a very firm ass, but as he was about to turn around a small alarm sounded from the other room.
He stumbles from his bedroom, hand pressed against the bite on his neck, gasping. It’s too hot in his room, but the living room isn’t much better. The air is stagnant and thick, entirely too humid to breathe properly. He’s practically panting as he makes his way to the kitchen. Leaning over the sink, he pours himself a glass of water and gulps it down, spilling most of it over his throat and chest. The rivulets run into the dressing of the bite and he hisses at the sting, pressing his hand once again to the bloodied bandage. The feel of the gauze is like sandpaper dragging over his hypersensitive skin.
His frustration mounting, Draco stares to take his fill the same way a desperate man would scratch an itch that was already bleeding, wanting to conquer that which has made him so unsettled. The markings spread out across Potter’s skin like an illuminated manuscript Muggle monks would pore over with endless discipline in their monasteries; or no, rather those mad Victorians. The markings are archaic in their execution, yet exceedingly and whimsically detailed like only the Victorians and their "scientific" texts could ever achieve. Orion, standing proud and aloof, taking up space on Potter’s bicep, draped in yards of fabric like a Roman nobleman. Canis Major, howling at an absent moon, one paw lifted, placed directly over Potter’s heart. Draco swallows hard at the sight of it—Sirius, the godfather, reflected in front of him from his place in the heavens, the closest thing Potter ever had resembling a loving parent, forever immortalised on his skin.
“Good.” He looks down at Draco, eyes fierce, as if he could magic him better by sheer force of will. Hermione’s half convinced he might try. Draco’s bite stands out stark and pale against Harry’s damp brown skin. Hermione momentarily focuses her worry on the mark, convinced it connects them in some way. She’s quickly pulled away from that train of thought because all of a sudden, Draco’s thrashing ceases, and everything falls quiet in the room.
Draco catches him, holding him steady by the upper arms. “Careful there, you’ll break that pretty nose of yours again.”
Harry laughs and grabs his shades off the counter, heading for the door, the dwindling days on the calendar still fresh in his mind.
Remembering his manners seconds too late, he steps back and invites her in, holding his arm out in greeting. She nods again and steps through, eyeing the staircase as if it were a bomb ready to explode.
“You oiling up the old beast for a joyride?” Charlie says from the doorway of the barn. He’s backlit from the weak morning sun, his smile just barely visible when Harry looks up.
mean for all of them: Charlie, Teddy, Andy, everyone. But jealousy had never been a part of the discussion. At least, not from Harry’s perspective.
“Except by me, and now you.” Draco smiles behind a lock of fallen pink hair. Harry pushes it back behind his ear and Draco leans into his palm, melting into the touch.
Draco chuckles to himself as his hands run up and down Harry’s jean-clad thighs. “So eager for it,” he says, resting his cheek over the rigid length of Harry’s cock. Draco rubs, like a kneazle nuzzling at the leg of a beloved owner, and Harry’s head falls back. He closes his eyes to the blinding noon-day sun, seeing red hot flares of light burst behind his eyelids as he gives into whatever Draco has to offer.
“Sirius owned this record.” He’d scratched those same words into the wall above his bedroom door in Grimmauld Place. Harry remembers the day he spotted Sirius’ slanted teenage scrawl marring the dingy brocade of the wallpaper. It had made him smile through his tears.
Behind them, the hearth fire flares to life in a blaze of green and Bill stands to answer the call. Draco quickly wipes at his eyes and casts a wandless calming charm over himself in hopes that it would leave him feeling less flushed and unsettled. He’d been expecting Harry to step through the crackling embers but when he turns back, who he sees instead is a mirror of the woman sitting beside him. The only difference he can spy is her hair colour, a shade darker than her sister’s.
“My dear Luna,” Xenophilius says, pulling back and holding her by the arms a little too tight. He always was a bit overzealous. “Sweet, wondrous Luna, you’ve found it!”
Harry moans, letting his head fall back. The man catches him, pulls his hair taut in the loop of his fist and presses their foreheads together, the bite of his mask rasping against Harry’s. “You want me?” he asks, in Italian, this time—
“I should head out,” Harry says, not wanting to dwell on the bittersweet memory so close behind him he can still feel Draco’s lips mapping his skin.
Hermione shakes off her attentions, though not unkindly. “I did try!” she exclaims, then gathers herself. Inhales. “I didn’t—I just didn’t want Harry to be left alone with him. You see how they are with us in the room. With your father in the room! Imagine if we weren’t even there?”
Looking over her shoulder to the pendulum wall clock softly swinging back and forth in its gilded box, Hermione laments what little night they have left. By the time they’d all gathered in the kitchen, seen to Harry’s awful bite wound, admonished Draco for administering said bite wound, scrambled a few eggs for supper, and figured out a place to keep Draco, it’d just turn 2.
They walk on, their boots crunching the grass, sticks, and rocks underfoot. They’re almost at the valley stream, and Luna feels time is running out for certain conversations. She knows the answer to her question, but she wants to hear Harry confirm her assumption. Perhaps it’ll help him realise how stagnant he’s become and how badly he needs to break free of the shell he’s built around himself.
Polpettino - adding ‘ino’ or ‘ina’ at the end of words endears them, so polpettino means ‘tiny’ meatball. heheheehe
Draco takes a moment to calm himself. Seeing Scorpius’ reaction brings a sense of levity to the conversation and he suddenly feels awful for the way he’s spoken to his son.
“Then why would I want to alter mine with Harry?” Draco asks, feeling emboldened at getting a rise out of Fleur, and then immediately crumples with the realisation that he’s simply lashing out because he’s hurting. He always did project his pain onto others, too frightened of his own overwhelming feelings. “I’m sorry,” he says, before Fleur can answer and he looks away from her sad expression, eyes staring into the low-burning embers of the hearth.
“Potter!” Draco shrieks as he’s tipped backwards. Potter laughs but doesn’t follow through, dropping Draco back onto the bench seat with an amused grunt. Draco smacks him on the arm. “Heathen!”
Harry bites his deliciously full lower lip and closes his eyes, allowing the attention. Wrapping his body as tightly as he can around Harry’s, Draco drops his head to Harry’s neck once more, mouthing at the scar with his tongue and his teeth, hungry for it, needy to the point of wanting to beg. He’s achy and unsettled, itchy in his own skin. He needs this so much more than he can explain, he’s terrified of his own wanting.
“Hmm?” Harry licks his lips and raises an eyebrow, turning away from taste-testing the pan sauce he’s simmering.
Despite the turmoil and violence of the day, Hermione finds herself grinning at that thought as they head inside.
Harry’s gaze immediately whirled around the room, trying to spot movement from one of the paintings, certain that he’d checked them for any indication earlier, only to have Malfoy’s hands fist in his hair and pull Harry back to where he wanted him. He stared at Malfoy, a thought prickling at the corners of his mind. “You told me not to touch them.”
“Scorpius, we were impulsive and had just survived a war. No one was in their right minds back then. It’s not like—”
“Please,” she repeats, the strength in her waning like the sinking moon outside the window. “Please, Draco.”
Cecilia side-along Apparated with him back to their flat the day before to introduce herself to his friends. She insisted on delivering her invitation to join their festival party in person. She and Hermione immediately struck up an excitable conversation about costumes and masks as Cecilia made herself at home in their kitchen and put together an impromptu platter of cheeses, bread, salumi, and prosciutto that she’d plucked from her canvas market tote. To top it off, she pulled a bottle from the bag and popped the cork with a sly grin and a shout of
Chuckling, Harry runs his hands through his wind-blown hair. He looks comfortable, perfectly balanced on a
Draco’s mouth falls open in undignified astonishment. He’d been a baby, a toddler at best, there was no way Teddy should remember such a fleeting moment in his life.
Harry has dreamed of those eyes, their memory has haunted his thoughts for the past four years. He would know that face anywhere. Even half-covered in a grotesque mask made of bone and carved with ironically delicate details that contradict the brutal reality of its horrifying existence on Draco Malfoy’s face.
“Sorry,” Harry stammers, sitting up and pushing his hair back behind his ears. The pew creaks as he shifts in his seat, the sound echoing loudly all around them. He winces and apologizes again in Italian.
His vulnerability is shocking, endearing even as he speaks of the things he’s nurtured, and the pride he has in his efforts. The intimacy of the moment feels compounded by the sudden appearance of Draco’s candour.
“No kidding.” The man has picked the woman up by her hips and pushed her onto the railing of the bridge, her legs wrapping tightly around his waist. “I feel wrong watching this,” Harry whispers.
He looks over again and Potter is biting his lip. Circe help him, he’s developing a tension headache from simply being near the bastard.
“Children!” Xenophilius exclaims, voice boisterous and jarring in comparison to the pleasant gurgle of the stream. Luna shakes her head of her silly thoughts and steps forward to hug him. Xenophilius gestures for Harry to join. Luna can feel the flapping of her father’s arm as he encourages Harry, and then there’s another body behind her as Harry huddles close for the embrace.
“Fuck my mind quiet,” Hermione demands against her mouth, needy. Luna kisses away her desperation and snakes a hand down past Hermione’s quivering stomach.
“But Draco was always so vain.” Hermione’s voice is strained as she speaks and Luna knows she doesn’t mean to sound cruel. “Why would he scar his own face?”
Harry opens his mouth to speak, closes it, all the words stuck in the back of his throat. In a daze he hands over his gelato to the pink-haired Draco Malfoy, as if the offering would suffice in place of speech.
Except Draco rears on the bed, his wings extending and knocking hard into Luna, whose head snaps back and hits the plaster wall. She slumps, dazed. Hermione and Harry call out her name in the chaos, but Draco has pulled himself free of the sheets and engulfed Luna in the cocoon of his wings.
Eyebrow arched, Draco lifts the lid of the cardboard box, eyes assessing its contents. Harry can see the moment Draco’s agitation leaves him in place of gastronomic anticipation as his pupils dilate with obvious hunger.
Those confessions, uttered in the hair’s breadth that hung between their lips as they struggled to find balance amongst all their catastrophic emotions, were always Harry’s. He was the one who warred with his own inner demons over Draco’s ideals and aspirations, now so altered compared to when he was seventeen. Yet, Harry has never been able to let that version of Draco go, the selfish, cowardly prick who’d happily break Harry’s nose under his boot heel than admit he needed love.
Luna hears the scraping of a chair right before she’s engulfed in an armful of warmth and silk and curls.
They’re panting, draped over the bike in a tangle of sweaty limbs. Draco reaches back, curling a hand around Harry’s denim-clad thigh, squeezing tight. Harry nods into the dip between Draco’s shoulder blades and presses a kiss against the line of his spine. He hears Draco sigh at the attention and licks a stripe of sweat off his chilled skin, watching the muscles in his back ripple in response. Harry smiles as Dravo shivers beneath him, sex-drunk and hazy as he sits up, pulling Draco with him, wrapping him up in the leather of his jacket.
“We need to go back,” Hermione says, and Luna sighs. She knows Hermione’s principles would never allow for them to leave the elf behind, even if the poor thing had already succumbed to its fate. So she listens as Hermione plans, and nods her head at the appropriate moments, all the while warring with the knowledge that her own father had birthed the idea of leaving Draco in that forgotten place. She wonders how far gone with grief Narcissa must have been to agree, and how much of a danger Draco posed to even fathom abandoning him to such an existence.
“We can’t just lie here all day,” Draco sighs, sounding for all the world like that's exactly what he wants to do. Harry doesn’t blame him. He shakes his head, a slow movement back and forth across his pillow.
Before he knows what’s happening, Cecilia has rearranged the hotel’s chaise lounges to flank underneath one of their peach-striped umbrellas, the footrests of each chaise touching. She places her floppy hat on the back of the second chaise and plops Draco down onto it, arranging his robe in such a way that sets off both his long legs and the pattern of the fabric.
He bursts out of the church into the night, gasping for breath, leaving the smells of incense and candle wax behind him. He leans down, hands on his knees, panting; his magic thrumming just under the surface like a shiver he can’t shake.
Draco’s wings curl around him as shame paints his features. Narcissa stamps down the raw, gnawing need to run to him, knowing her words have caused him pain. She feels the betrayal in Draco's expression reflected back at her as if it were her own, as if she were peering through a looking glass, watching her own suffering. She wants to take the anguish from him, wants to rip it free from his soul and bundle it away where it can no longer touch him, but the time for such precious coddling has passed. Narcissa knows that it is far too late to ease Draco’s pain.
“No change is a good thing, though, right?” Draco asks, swinging his feet over the side of the bed to face her properly. The clipboard disappears from Soto’s hand with a small
Harry is still hacking a lung, not recovered from almost dying a minute ago, so Neville takes it upon himself to answer for him. The bastard.
Bryn smiles and tilts their head. “Of course. I’m not going to do anything that you’re uncomfortable with. If you asked me not to, then we would skip to the next step of today’s meeting.”
tired than before, but nevertheless gets out of bed and showers. He hates the thought of losing daylight, especially after sleeping so much the day before.
He looks at them side-by-side, skimming over the words, looking for anything that could possibly be related. His heart leaps when he sees that “herbaria” appears on both lists. If nothing else, at least he knows now that the list Narcissa gave him is definitely related to potions, and he would reason that they’re ingredients.
He sets aside a newspaper about the fifth anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, which he provided a statement for—it’s clear that it was
He pours himself a glass of water, sipping absently as his mind goes back to the dream. Now that he tries to recall the details, he can’t remember much of it at all, or even what made him wake up. Something about a storm, and Potter?
Draco smirks and walks into the room, hand coming to rest on Harry’s shoulder for just a moment as he passes, and Harry sucks in a breath and shuts his eyes. He smells like bergamot and gin.
“Harry, where are your glasses?” Neville asks as they approach the table. Harry feels the eyes of a few of the students turn to him. Their stares usually don’t bother him, but today, he feels bashful under their gazes.
Draco raises his eyebrows as he reads through the notice. This is from today, and it’s as good of a starting point as he’s going to get—especially because the potions are mostly disappearing from the very ward he’s living in.
Draco gapes, stomach twisting at the sight. The pieces sink to the ground, puddles of black ooze on the floor, before they disappear completely.
The last time they saw each other was at Teddy’s graduation, and only briefly. But Molly already has a soft spot for Draco, after everything her grandchildren have said about him as a teacher — and if Narcissa is anything like Draco, then Harry’s sure that Molly will love her by the end of the night.
Draco flips through the few pages, noting that the dates are all from the past week. The very last page is mostly empty, apart from a short list. He raises his eyebrows and takes a sharp breath—this is exactly what he’s looking for.
“I don’t know what I did to make you think this, or what ‘escapades’ you’re referring to, but thank you for letting me know how you feel. I hope Gilderoy and Basil are good company. I’ll leave you to it, then,” he says, words clipped, and immediately exits Agnes’s cubicle.
“The memory hasn’t formed yet,” Bryn says from beside him. Their voice sounds strange. “It will soon.”
“Malfoy?” The voice comes from behind him, and a tight coldness immediately forms in the pit of his stomach. That voice is impossibly familiar, and the person it belongs to
to see Potter when he’s already on edge. On the other, Draco craves the stimulation of their arguments—mostly about the spell Potter used on him—and the way Potter has begun to speak to him like an equal, rather than a child like Soto did.
When they finally finish cooling, stabilizing, and bottling the Skele-Gro, they drop the bottles off in the Hospital Wing together, and Harry finds himself inviting Draco for a cup of tea before lunch.
The doors seem to lead to offices, general check up rooms, and a staircase going down that must lead to the other wards in St. Mungo’s. Faint voices and footsteps float up to him, getting softer as they move away from the staircase, and his curiosity almost leads him to follow the sound.
“Of course she would. Well. Thank you for going after her. If you see Ron, please let him know she’s going to be okay. And—don’t wind up in here tonight, Malfoy. You don’t want to be stuck with me to treat your injuries.”
“Draco,” he finally says, like he’s trying it out, and Draco looks up sharply. “I can do that. Draco.”
He rolls his eyes, but ducks back into his curtains anyway. Wagner can get strict about patient confidentiality, so he probably wouldn’t take kindly to someone spying on them.
He turns to Agnes, managing a smile. It’s a bit belated, but he finally signs hello, the movement of his hands coming naturally after practicing it so much.
He makes his way back to his bed, intent on getting ready to venture outside of the ward. The inevitable nervousness is starting to set in, but he tries to shake it off as he shuts his curtains behind him.
“Draco?” a woman calls softly. Draco is on his feet in a moment, flinging the curtains back, holding his breath and staring at the witch with wide eyes. Narcissa looks back, unrecognizable emotions flickering across her face. She’s strikingly beautiful, with her high cheekbones and thin lips, and any sign of aging seems elegant on her.
But it occurs to him that what’s happening in St. Mungo’s is probably the reason he lost his memories in the first place—he must’ve known too much or was coming close to catching them when he was an Auror, and
Harry rolls his eyes and flips George off as he climbs the steps, the redhead’s laughter following him up. When he’s out of George’s sight, though, he casts a few freshening charms on himself in embarrassment. It’s entirely possible George was pulling his leg — but it’s equally likely that he wasn’t. He’d rather not take that risk.
Their goodnight is soft and awkward, but it leaves a warmth in Draco’s chest that he carries with him to sleep. His dreams that night are of walking to room 4B, of the potions storeroom and everything within, of herbaria and bubbling green poison antidotes.
He eyes his small notepad and self-inking quill on the bedside table, deciding he should probably take them with him. They slip easily into his pocket, along with the anti-nausea potion Soto gave him yesterday—just in case.
Harry bends and picks the “gift” up, knees cracking as he does, and he groans. The bag is soft and lumpy in his hands, and he can guess by the feeling that it’s full of vials. He pulls open the string and looks inside, and sure enough, it’s just a few empty glass vials.
Minutes later, he finds himself standing in front of a shallow basin, filled with a strange, water-like substance. Bryn uncorks the glass vial of Potter's memories and empties it in the water. He expects it to diffuse, but it remains separate from the liquid in the basin.
They reach for the small pile of papers behind them and flip through them, clicking their tongue absent-mindedly.
“I would at least be seen to assess the damage. Any trauma to your core could cause problems down the line, if and when you use magic again. I know how crushing it can be if you learn that it’s unlikely you’ll regain your memories, but you don’t have to seek treatment even if you know there is a chance. It’s your choice, love. Not mine,” Soto says, voice calm, soothing Draco’s inner turmoil.
Harry had turned in Draco’s arms and kissed him, pulling back only to tell him, “That would be impossible,
“Do not fret, mon cher. It is simple to control once you understand it. With a bond so new, things are easier to . . . ,” Fleur pauses and tilts her head in thought, “what’s the word, shift?”
Eyes flashing, Harry grins, placing both hands on either side of Draco’s head and pulling him up. “Come here.”
“Yes, and you wear it beautifully, my dear. Unlike myself. I am nothing but a decaying slip of a man with—“
Hermione scoffs. “Oh, don’t look at me like that. She has her father, and her grandparents. My not talking for a month will be a reprieve to them, if anything.”
Harry doesn’t let a single drop spill, even as he chokes from the force of it all. He pulls back only for a moment to catch his breath and wipe at his face before swallowing Draco’s still-hard cock back down. He’s greedy for it, hungry with a need he can’t extinguish. He sucks and licks and massages Draco’s cock with gentle strokes of his tongue until it goes soft and slips free from his lips. All the while, Draco rocks above him, head still thrown back, throat exposed and eyes closed, lost to sensation.
“Right, well. Perhaps a broom shop? How far away is the—“ he trails off as the man shakes his head halfway through his question, eyes crinkling with mirth at the corners.
Scorpius squeezes his eyes shut and shoots back his drink in one. He drops his glass down to the table with a satisfying thud against the wood, shakes his head fiercely and says, “No, I didn’t mean just now, but thank you for that visual, dear father. Merlin’s tits,” he looks to the ceiling before gathering himself once more. “I meant before.”
The priest's eyes widen, shock clear on his aged, ashen face. Harry’s heart pounds in his chest. He’d wanted to startle him, offend him. He wanted to tip the old man off the very axis of his existence like he’d done to Harry by alluding to the markings on his skin.
Luna’s hand twines its way through hers, and Hermione feels her squeeze reassurance into her palm. Hermione holds tightly back, witnessing something far more intimate than she’d ever expected between two men she’s only ever thought of as hard-won friends.
The scrape of Malfoy’s chair on the terracotta tiles fills the kitchen as he stands. “I was being sarcastic.”
Draco looks up, seeing Potter’s green eyes burn just from looking at him. Circe, if that emotion were truly real, truly meant for Draco… He swallows, trying to remember what his vocal cords are and how one goes about using them for speech. Finally, he simply shakes his head in answer, not having the strength to deny Potter the truth. How the fuck could this be an act; he’s so turned on he can’t even speak.
There are fireflies circling the sitting room in lazy, glowing spirals, adding an ethereal bit of whimsy to the scene. Hermione unintentionally conjures one each time she Transfigures another stray bottle cap or wine cork into gold buttons in an attempt to fancy up Ron’s waistcoat. Harry’s been watching from a safe distance for twenty minutes now, glass in hand.
He refills his water glass two more times, chasing a thirst he can’t satisfy. He’s only in his pants, yet he’s sweltering from the heat radiating off his own skin. He can feel the wetness on the back of his neck, soaking into his hair.
“Draco,” Hermione starts, voice hesitant. “We didn’t necessarily think this . . . particular bit of information would factor that strongly into your deciding to come stay here, but—”
“That’s it, Draco,” she soothes, cooing once again. Draco’s shoulders slowly unfurl from their taut state at her bird-call. “Harry, do the spell again.”
Absentmindedly, Luna hums an agreement, then freezes, and turns to face Hermione, eyes coloured with concern. “But we have to get to the ruins.”
Draco nods, dragging his nose repeatedly over the scar he caused. The sensation is entirely too much and not nearly enough. When Draco presses his lips to the sensitive skin, Harry bites down hard on his own cheek. Draco does it a second time, lingering and possessive, and Harry can’t take it. He slams his head back against the door with a grunt for lack of a better thing to do.
Heart racing and feeling slightly unhinged, Harry looks down at the glowing screen, entirely distracted. “What is it?”
The pastries, Draco means. Harry closes his eyes and pictures the custard bursting out the side as Draco bites into its soft dough with sharp white teeth, the sugar crystals coating his lips and the cream making a mess of his chin.
The only sound Draco can make out over the storm is the roaring of the motorbike engine, currently circling below them all along the cliff’s edge, Harry’s expression stern, as though he were nothing but a marble statue come to life, blood-warm yet forever rigid.
“No!” Harry practically shouts, then gathers himself. The wizard behind the glass waits for him nonplussed, eyebrow arched.
“It’s easy.” Harry shrugs, but neglects to show Malfoy how; the tenuous truce they’ve managed to broker leaves Harry feeling uneasy in his own skin—like an itch pestering him that he can’t quite reach.
Without another second of hesitation, Harry does, fisting his erection through his pants, biting his lip at the instant relief and simultaneous pain of his harsh grip. “Fuck,” he curses.
Another circuit, another passing glance at Draco. He still wears his hard-won confidence like an amour, Harry notes. No amount of time sequestered in an ancient prison could take that away from him, and Harry’s glad of it. The mask, on the other hand, is disturbing.
“I feel you,” Draco answers, eyes closing on a sigh. He shifts himself against the bulge in Harry’s jeans. Harry bites his lip and thrusts once, watching the flash of excitement cross Draco’s face.
Harry can’t bring himself to move. He knows he should; knows he should sit back and give Draco some space, allow him time to acclimate to the sudden invasion of his horrid prison where he’s been left to rot, but he can’t move.
Potter has fallen back onto the bench across from Draco, his hand pressed against his red cheek, laughing to himself. Draco watches in awe as Potter wandlessly summons his sunglasses from the back of the boat, pockets them, and runs a hand over his mouth, healing his split lip. He’s smiling at Draco, green eyes bright. There’s a smear of blood at the corner of his mouth. The effect makes him look feral; a predator fresh from a kill. The sight shouldn't cause Draco’s breath to catch in his throat, yet suddenly, he can barely breathe.
Looking up, Harry sees the drastic vibrations have increased. The frescos and columns all shifting violently in place and there are cracks forming along the marble. He’s not sure of the source of such unstable, volatile magic, but he’s certain it isn’t him alone.
Draco nods. “Only other things.” His tone sounding hurt and tentative in a way Harry isn’t used to hearing. He knows they’re getting to the crux of it now.
The past few days have been a special breed of torture with the seizures and the pain, but his head has cleared, and his mind has settled. He knows each and every scent in this house. He knows when Luna and Hermione are coming together in their bedroom, when Harry is pissing in the loo, when he’s thinking of Draco in his sleep, when his arousal clouds his own better judgement—Draco scents it all. His senses feel released and renewed, so much so that he knows exactly what those blue splatters on Xenophilus’ robes mean for him: his potion. Draco can smell it on him, knows he’s brought a vial with him, and once more, knows he doesn’t want it.
He smiles as Draco wraps his robe tightly around himself, face severe with his trademark facade of haughty indifference.
“Draco,” Harry whispers, questioning his choice to join him out here with the summer heat pressing in on them from all sides. He needs to rise, needs to sit forward and put his elbows on his knees like Draco, but he can’t move. He’s been rendered utterly inert by those penetrating, predatory eyes. Another second passes with Draco watching him and suddenly, Harry isn’t sure he wants to let this limbo of indecision end—the anticipation is too sweet not to savour.
“Ready?” he calls back over the din. Draco squeezes Harry tight around the middle and nips at his neck.
“He isn’t!” She shouted, feeling slightly unhinged at the thought. Everyone always used to say how much like his father Draco was, but Narcissa had seen the break between the two men when Draco turned fifteen. She saw the chasm that bloomed between them that summer and only grew larger as the war loomed and Lucius fell further into the prejudiced ideologies of a demagogue. The darkness that Lucius coveted in his own soul was never reflected in Draco’s eyes, only the darkness that had been inflicted upon him. Draco’s resemblance to his father ended at the length and colour of his hair. This didn’t stop people from flinging you look just like your father at Draco like an Unforgivable every chance they could. If Narcissa could have protected Draco from such a fate she would have, she would protect him against anything—even himself.
The first thing Harry noticed after regaining consciousness was the scritch-scratching of rats running through the plaster wall behind him. The sound prickled at his senses and he shifted away from it, groaning as he went. Everything hurt. His back ached, his head throbbed, and his hands stung with the radiating remnants of the curse that had burned his wand right out of his fingertips. The ashen shards of wood remained in a heap to his right, tendrils of smoke still drifting towards the coffered ceiling. He didn’t chance another look down at the odd grey tinge of his skin, nor the blue glow emanating from his right hand, an ominous aura of unknown magic that mocked everything he’d ever studied about wand lore.
Swallowing hard, Harry stares back at Draco’s unnaturally darkened eyes, taking in the truth of that statement and the unquestioning vulnerability Draco has just laid out before him. Harry reaches for the first thought that comes to him and says, “You’ve already atoned for your sins, Draco. Many times over.”
Harry huffs out a laugh, but it’s a bitter thing. Yes, Sirius had excellent taste in music. Harry, wanting nothing else of the world than to hide from it when he was seventeen and newly freed from the oppressive yoke of his youth, had buried himself in the bits of life Sirius had left behind. His clothes, his books, his music—there were piles upon piles of records overflowing from an expanded trunk Harry found inside Sirius’ room. Listening to every album, every song until he’d memorized them all by heart had given Harry something to focus on other than his own grief. Those days spent lying dazed on Sirius’ old bed were ones Harry can look back on now with thoughts of fondness, having put enough time and space between him and Sirius’ death, though the idea of experiencing the world without him still burns to this day.
Max’s eyes close as he obediently swallows a dribbled sip and Harry feels the sting of Draco’s ghost retreating to its place within the frame on his kitchen wall. Harry places the bottle on the table and undoes his flies, relief flooding him along with a spike of much-welcomed lust as he pulls out his half-hard cock.
Neville snorts. “Too right.” He raises his champagne flute, missing Harry’s glass completely as he tries to cheers him. “Salute!” he calls, nevertheless.
Harry’s final days in Venice are spent almost entirely at Draco’s flat. More specifically in his bed, surrounded by greenery and Japanese silk, the sounds of a Muggle vinyl record softly spinning away on the gramophone in the corner. After one too many interruptions from Cecilia innocently offering them trays of espresso and bread and cheeses, Harry had thrown the strongest warding charm he knew at the secret door in the wall, and threw another two at the bedroom door leading to the hall for good measure.
Hidden behind the concealment of his sunglasses, Draco continues to observe Potter as his chest rises and falls with his breath, following the movement down to the flat of his abdomen, where a trail of dark, coarse hair disappears behind the waistband of his trunks. There’s a swell of a bulge there, something promising and thick hidden away from Draco’s view. He licks his lips and looks up, taking in the fall of Potter’s chaotic mane draped inelegantly over the back of his chair, his fingers itching to comb through the curls.  Draco shifts in his seat, feeling uneasy in his own skin. He pulls a flap of his robe across his pelvis, covering it from view.
its long tail now curling around to the palm of Harry’s hand—normally rested out of sight along the back of Harry’s left knee, and had done since the age of sixteen, when Harry’s goal of following Malfoy everywhere around their school ended in a pool of blood on the bathroom floor. He was certain that his obsessive, reckless behaviour was the reason for Draco’s constellation becoming a feature on his body, even though he'd never quite figured out the logic behind the markings. For a while, Hermione was convinced they were some kind of celestial map complete with clues to help defeat Voldemort, but Harry instinctively knew that theory to be a false one. The constellations came and went just as the people that they represented came into and out of Harry’s life.
Draco looks back down, eyes fierce with want and holds Harry’s head in his hands. “Move,” he commands, “now.”
Draco’s gaze is unrelenting, his body a live wire, ready to spark. His wings are pushed out high and arched behind him, backlit by the moonlight looming heavy and low over the water. Nothing outwardly changes about his appearance, yet Harry witnesses the exact moment Draco makes the decision, though he’s not sure what decision it is that he’s made. Harry can practically feel the sense of impending victory staring out at him through those wild, mercurial eyes. A bead of sweat slips from Harry’s hairline to his brown and he shivers.
