He quickly found a table and motion for one of the toddler seats to float over to their table. once Draco and his son were settled down a waiter came over and Draco ordered each of them a nice warm drink and a nice bowl of soup. Draco remember to cast a non sticking charm on his son's clothes since he didn't know to bring a bib.
Draco shook his head as he realized they we're already at a smaller childhood home made out of that he remembered. his mama Narcissa was standing outside the gate almost like she was waiting for them. he let go of Scorpius hand and let the little boy run the last little way to his nana as he walked slowly towards the two.
Draco smiled and scooped Harry up into his arms and cheered as he said;
when he got to the guest room door he saw that there was a sign on the outside of it, it read.
"look daddy look it's Nana!"
"What's this my little Bumblebee?" Draco asked while also taking what his son was holding. it was a piece of paper, he opened it and read it.
Draco a look down at his son, took a deep breath and open the door.
"you okay now Scorp?" Draco rubbed his son's back.
Draco smiled and slipped the paper into his robe pocket before scooping up Scorpius and making their way upstairs.
"What is your papa planning little guy? hmm?" he tickled his sons tummy making the little blond giggle.
"Another baby, another baby, I'm going to be a dad again."
Draco was taken aback for when he open the door he was hit buy different colored confetti in the sight of his husband standing in a light blue and pink robe and a sign on the wall proclaiming.
“Well to start with this,” Harry says handing over the letters he received the day before. “Yesterday as I unlocked Potter Manor, my guards and I were set upon by Dementors, I don’t understand how they even found me, it's not as if they can be sent after a specific person, or they would have been sent after Sirius when he escaped instead of haunting Hogwarts for a year.”

Ron from what he had been told had spoken to Hermione of doing the same and she had refused. Stating that Dumbledore had given it to her and that she had a right to the money. After that and her subsequent outburst, Bill had had both her and Ron tested for any and all Potions and spells in their systems and on their personages. They had both come back positive. Ron had quickly at Bill’s prompting undertaken the ritual that would remove all said spells and potions. Hermione had refused on the basis of all Rituals being dark according to Dumbledore and that they should be outlawed.
Loyal Hufflepuff took all the rest as her alone.
"If he/she does marry someone of the common class, not of a house, then a generational count begins. After three generations of following this guideline, family magic begins to form, in simple ways. This formation forms in some form of magic becoming easier for those of that house. From there the generational count restarts at 0. But all children of the house are considered to be pureblood."
"That is not the Potter house's prerogative." Snaps a member of the Wizengamot that had escorted the prince.
"Done, though I now understand why asking Abraxas grandson would not also give you this information. I'm surprised you have not had miss Parkinson or Greengrass spying on the boy with all honesty. It was after all the group study session you assigned them to that my info comes from. It seems that the Gryffindor know-it-all, Miss. Granger was pushing for them to complete the extra credit question."
"Draco reread the entirety of the new educational decree." Harry paused for him to read it out loud. They now had the attention of most of the hall, though the teachers seemed to have put up a new privacy bubble to stop their meals from getting interrupted again. "You, Pansy and Blaise are heading to class when you enter a hallway that has three students in it already. The Hallway now contains six students, I should hope none of you get caught because you all just formed an Organization, Society, Team, Group, or a club and if caught as you will not have had permission from the High Inquisitor, will be expelled. I'm not even touching on the fact that all our classes have more than three students in them, its why I asked for the notes I very well can't attend classes when there's already three people in the classroom. But I figured if a single student from each of the three houses went to class, they could share the notes between the other students in the classes, so none of us miss anything until this gets repealed. I know myself if it's not repealed by the Wizengamot session that starts the first of November, I will be challenging the bill there as it infringes on my heir rights to have me and mine be tutored by an outside tutor."

"Ahh, I had wondered if I would be seeing you young Lord Le-Fay, such a pity it is really." Grindelwald taunted before showering the two men in spells. "Leave the battle now, I have no need to face you yet, all I want here is Dumbledore, Dumbledore and his little prodigy. Though even I've heard that he's not yours so much anymore Albus."

"What was he talking about?" Marvolo snarled into Neville's face.
"As a family grows and develops certain family rules are developed. These are individual for the family and are written in the grimoire. It is the responsibility of the eldest in the family to ensure that those rules are not broken and that in time the heir can govern the family according to those rules when the time comes for them to take the mantle. However, as in any society, a family member can be influenced by outsiders and either disregard the family rules and values, or merely not pass said rules and values onto the child. Recard Selwyn, was one such well known person who disregarded his family's rules and guidelines, he chose to ignore the family rules and was eventually cast out of the family and disinherited. This disinheriting did not extend to his four children already born to him. With the death of his brother Recard's son Arman was named heir. He and his siblings however were raised with a certain disregard for the family's rules, and guidelines. Eventually Recard's son Arman became head of house and removed the family rules and values from the Selwyn house, instating new ones, an act that shocked and caused many families to remove themselves from the family's acquaintance. To help ensure it never happened again, that a child was turned from it's house, the King of the time forged a law, ruling that the final guardianship of the children of a family belonged to that family's head of house, and that at any point in time that families head of house could reclaim guardianship of said children with just cause and raise the child as their own. Heirs especially where guarded by this law to defend them as well from enemies they may have from inside the house. The law even crosses between allies and such, it's very convoluted and slightly confusing at times. But one of the things that came from the law was the establishing of a magical guardian for all children without a magical parent, or without a proper head of house as established by the bloodline tests."
Weed the Garden
Harry had every intention of being an older brother to the two boys. Furthermore, he could feel his own house magic be pleased at the idea of protecting Marcus. Marcus who now sat as his heir, would be announced as the Cardemon heir tonight. Harry's magic recoiled at that saying that it should be Potter, but Harry settled it, and clamed himself before settling in for a day of classes and work.
that as always you aid the house of Potter, it’s heir needs aid, and you can aid him. For where a Potter goes.”
"The Pendragon army was stopped at the fields about 30 miles away from what is now Potter manor by the Potter army." Harry said a far-away look in his eyes "The two were dead locked before Arthur Pendragon called his armies into a full retreat. Cardoc Potter the Lord Potter of the time held his men strong and had almost given the order to pursue when Arthur used the family gift against Cardoc and his armies, before it could be fully summoned Cardoc surrendered. Instead of executing Cardoc and his commanders, he offered Cardoc his protection to the lands he held. Years later after Arthur had fully conquered the Isles and half of France. Cardoc swore his line to the Pendragon's, he was the first to do so but not the last."
"And you are a perfect this year, you need to be there early. Do not argue with me, Draco."
"Then why has he not gone through the proper Rites and claimed the seat." Questioned Neville.
With that the sorting commenced with many an heir glaring quietly at the headmaster quite angry with him many were going to contact their parents to pull out the families copy of the Hogwarts Charter. There was nothing to discuss Harry thought they either obeyed, the school laws or Harry brought the headmaster and the school governors before the Wizengamot court for High treason. Harry watched the remaining sorting and the speech given by both the headmaster and the toady witch from his trial, Delores Umbridge, impassively, not commenting on it when Hermione did. In his opinion the ministry was a day late and a dollar short on interfering with the running of Hogwarts, now the old houses were stepping in to do so. Evidenced as well by the other teachers that would be joining the staff this year. With over 700 hundred students being added to the almost 300 previous students bringing the total of 200 students in both first and second year, around 150 for third through fifth, and around 75 for sixth and seventh years. This meant that the previous method of only one teacher for all main subjects was no longer enough as such the main teachers would only be teaching 5th through 7th years. They would have two teaching assistants that would aid in both teaching the younger years and in grading assignments. Dumbledore introduced the new teacher and the new teaching assistants for all the classes, the students were dismissed to their common rooms, as Harry was asked to remain and wait for the headmaster. Many an heir to the older lines remained as did Harry's cadet's.
"Heir Potter will be charged, tried, and sent to Azkaban; it is very disappointing that one of your status has been hoodwinked by him." The Auror answered.
"My answer is final." Harry answered coldly.
Frowning she answered him "I had asked what was on your mind, but I think you answered that. Did you remember that we have class today?"
Chapter 9 – The Sorting Feast
“Yes, the house of Potter had forged the iron Legion and had equipped the Gold Centurion with not just regular Roman Battle Magic but some of the family magics of our line. We had created this monster, we had to destroy it, but we couldn’t, our skills did not lie in defense near as much as in offense. We were a family forged for war, though we had defense waging war was our strength and our gift. Calladius Potter the heir at the time, fled Rome. He went west and ended up in Babylon in the house of the Ishtar family. There he learned of the Caverns of Seals, so he sought out the caverns. Returning to Rome he captured an Iron Centurion, and locating the caverns entered and performed the ritual of Sealing. Previously, it had been believed that the ritual could only be done by an ancestral house, because the amount of house magics required to perform and complete the ritual was immense. House Potter of the time didn’t have house magics; we had only reached the rank of Elder. It was why the house of Ishtar, refused to aid the house of Potter, in finding the caverns or dealing with the problem, they didn’t see it as a threat after all this was merely a creation of a still at the time young house.”

"Because that's what the envelope for Harry's letter is made of." She answered.

Harry and Neville stood back to back as they stood in defense of each other, preparing for to attack. Focusing on their opponent Harry and Neville broke into action at the same time attacking a lieutenant each. Harry focused on the spell string he was casting ignoring the rising house magic levels that surrounding the two. Bone breaker, banisher, ice towards the right leg, fire towards the left, cutting curse aimed at the torso. The fight was interrupted by several of Marvolo's inner circle stepping forward to take the attention of the lieutenants, pushing Neville, and Harry from the fight, with sneers to join the other students. Harry and Neville allowed it seeing the students in trouble, they were both startled from their treck back to the student ranks, by the two giants that had marked the arrival of Grindelwald's forces moving from the edge of the forest where they had stood sentry, towards the school. Sparing a glance at each other Harry and Neville both sprang into action pulling their swords out and heading straight for the behemoth giants.
“He does not carry the title of house Pendragon and as such it is not necessary. Half of Britannia carries the blood what matters to us is the title.”
“Well, Corsairs great grandfather was born with an unlocked gift of necromancy. It’s the gift of the dead, now you say and most automatically assume inferi and such, but not Gregory he became a world-class Hit wizard and Auror because he used the spirits of those who had recently been murdered to solve how they got murdered. There was even some speculation that he discovered some old necromancy rituals that are light, that were used to like protect people but who knows. What I’m saying is when others wanted him to pay for his ability the Potters intervened and helped protect him. They saw past the gift to the man who just wanted to help inside.” At this point, they were all downstairs waiting on Alrick to finish in the kitchen with the Dursleys.
Draco blinked as he responded. "Ya, so?"
"Surprise!" Harry said approaching Draco and giving him a smile as he reached up to rub Scorpius head.
Draco shrunk down are shopping bags from Madam malkin's and slipped it into his pocket. next he took Scorpius his hand and made his way to the nearest fluke Network.
"Hey Scorp you want to go visit Nana?"
Scorpius nodded and looked up at his daddy.
Harry nodded and stretch up to give Draco a kiss.
About an hour later Harry figured he would go to bed also making sure the living room was straightened and all the presents were laid out under the tree and making sure that the milk and cookies for Santa had been eaten and drunk Harry made his way to the bedroom.
"Where I asked him to be mine? and where he said yes?"
so this game was leading him back to where it all began, home. a little cottage he shared with his husband and son.
His Doms smiled. They were going to have a fun night.
a sigh escape from his lips.
Draco smiled at his husband. they had had a fun weekend with Scorpius and managed to get all of their stuff like rapping and baking done early and now it seems his husband didn't know what to do with himself.
"daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy."
Draco looked up from the letter and looked back down at his son.
when Draco and Scorpius arrived back at their house the older blond made their way to the living room, when he entered the room sitting on the table next to Harry's chair was another piece of white paper. he walked over and picked it up reading it it said;
"I'm going to bed, see you in a few."
Draco nodded.
"Madam Malkin will be with you in about 15 minutes, if you wouldn't mind taking a seat over there, we will be with you in jest a few minutes."
After the two had finish their soups an ordered a nice delicious piece of cake they got their bill and was also handed another slip of paper which Draco read before unbuckling his son from his seat. the paper read.
"We're going to, we're having another baby?" Draco asked.
"Hmm, the place we first met huh?" he knew exactly where that was so he look on the list to see if there were any errands that needed done in that area.
new robes for Scorpius
Draco looked up from where he was sitting on the other couch reading his potions magazine.
After he handed the cashier the proper amount of money and he took Scorpius hand and they left the shop and he opened the next piece of paper, and it read.
about 30 minutes later Scorpius had new robes and Draco was standing in line to pay for said robes. when he was handed his receipt he was also handed another folded up paper that he still had his husband's Messi scroll on it.
Harry huffed as he said; " I'm bored! there's nothing to do, I'm normally wrapping presents, baking muffins or cookies not sitting here twiddling my thumbs."
"Talk to you?" Harry asked. For a singular second, he was confused. But seeing how nervous Malfoy looked, he realized almost instantly what the man was getting at. "Oh. You want me to
The plane jerked from turbulence, and Malfoy, already knocked out from the potion, slumped forward. Harry instinctively reached an arm out to grab him before his face could slam into the seat in front of him.
"I thought about how smooth and soft that skin there would be, about how sweet your cum would taste." Potter's voice had suddenly grown more confident as he talked.
Draco was highly aware that he was naked in Potter's arms, but he didn't pull away. Instead, he leaned on him and simply sobbed, unable to speak through the tears now as his emotions seemed to unravel from their tightly bound cord and spring from him. He was grateful to find that Potter didn't speak again and only held him, rubbing his back and waiting until Draco was ready to speak once he had calmed a bit.
Harry was a bit taken aback by this offer, but he nodded and smiled a bit, his chest feeling a little lighter. "Sure."
Harry nodded. That made sense, but it wouldn't leave them but a few seconds to charm the banshee and hope it did the trick. He felt better having a solid plan this time before entering the chamber, but something about it felt too easy, too straightforward. Or, was that the point? Often, the simple solutions could be overlooked in search of a more complicated one to match the complexity of the problem. But, the question was which way Slytherin would choose as the most cunning to pass this puzzle.
"Same message?" came Potter's voice, though greatly muffled.
But four more essays later, when the clock on the wall chimed midnight, there was a knock on his office door.
Harry pushed himself forward and snatched both of his wrists, now holding them apart. "Stop," he said firmly, and it was this that made Malfoy meet his gaze, looking startled. "Stop touching those scars. If this conversation is making you so upset that you feel you need to cut or even harm yourself in the slightest, let's stop. I won't bring up the topic of us or those challenges or anything romantic again."
Susan was still smiling, but as she looked between them, the grin faded from her face. "You two hate each other. There's only one reason you'd both be here together." Her gaze shot to Potter's arm, and she snatched it, pulling it close to examine the prophecy's mark on his inner forearm. She sighed and dropped his arm. Turning to her companion who was watching with his eyebrows raised, she said, "We should get them to headquarters."
Rating has been increased to E for things getting, ah, spicy. XD
After a few seconds, Malfoy's grip loosened, and to Harry's amazement, instead of pulling away, the man slid his hand down to Harry's wrist. He slipped his fingers inside Harry's loosely closed hand, gently teasing the fist open as if asking permission.
Draco pursed his lips and ignored him, instead looking up at the silver cobra and waiting for the instructions.
"Most likely," Harry said. He looked up the dim staircase. "Might as well face it. It probably won't hurt us." He started up the stairs with Malfoy just a few steps behind him and distinctly heard the man mutter something about how he 'didn't like conducting his life based on probably's.'
Harry then looked back at Malfoy. The man had seated himself on the dais, which was basically a circular slab of obsidian a foot thick and six feet wide. He had buried his face in his hands, his fingers threaded into his hair.
As Potter murmured a spell to switch his pajamas to suitable pyramid-raiding clothes as well, Draco began down the gentle slope toward the pyramid's entrance. Luckily, and unlike the pyramids of Giza, this one had a very noticeable door set into the side of it.
Malfoy stopped moving from where he had been trying to shake Harry's firm but not hurtful hold from his arm. He stared at him as if unsure he had really just heard words of encouragement come from the other man. "You don't know-"
"Focus on breathing slowly," Harry said. He tried to focus on speaking slow and reassuring words for the man beside him. It took all his willpower to keep his eyes on Malfoy's face and not let his gaze flit to their touching hands.
He laid his head back against the headrest of his seat as the plane picked up speed. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Malfoy take a gulp of the potion, push the cork back into place, and slide it into the pocket of his jeans.
? As in those stupid contraptions Muggles use to fly from place to place?"
"Ah, I am interested in what the third test was for you," Akil said. "No pair has ever made it that far, and it is the only test that changes based on the Slytherin prodigy."
"I think we should talk about that," Harry said. Last night, they hadn't discussed Slytherin's message and had just eaten dinner in silence and went to bed.
Susan shook her head. "All the pairs come to look for Slytherin first. We don't know why other than it might be because Slytherin was the first of the two to die. I personally think it's because Gryffindor's tomb might involve tests of bravery and only a very closely bonded prodigy pair can pass the tests. But," and she gave a big sigh, "that's speculation and definitely not to say Slytherin's tasks would be easy. Slytherin told Hufflepuff his tomb was enchanted to discourage, injure, and even kill intruders. Though...he seemed to suspect there would be a prophecy because he told Hufflepuff only his prodigy could open the mouth of the tomb. Maybe he knew his business with Gryffindor didn't end with his death, but unless he was secretly skilled in Divination, I'm not sure how he would have known that exactly."
have built a pyramid."
"Are you going to come eat?" Potter called from inside the room.
Madam Rosmerta brought him a butterbeer refill a few minutes later as he shuffled through his papers and checked his watch. He thanked her. Potter was very nearly late.
Draco swallowed again, this time trying to work some saliva back into his mouth so he could talk at a normal tone again. Now that he was coming down from his high, he realized it was time to move. But part of him wasn't ready to leave the intimate moment just yet. "Maybe..." he said and had to swallow again. "We can-"
Draco sat at a booth near the back of The Three Broomsticks, his fingers absently tipping a vial of his blood one way and then the other for something to occupy his nerves while he poured over the papers in front of him. The vial was only filled halfway as he had left room for Potter to add his blood. He didn't like the idea of combining his and Potter's blood, but it was necessary to find the tombs. At the very least, they would have to use their blood twice in this manner, and he didn't fancy having to cut his hand open multiple times to do so. And the vial also provided a mess-free way to combine their blood.
"Well, yeah," Potter said. "But it'll probably fight back."
The bikes turned a corner, and Harry was worried they might lose them. Hell, where was Malfoy too? He had apparently lost him among the crowd.
And hadn't Harry expressly told himself that he would not act on these stirring feelings? Of course, that was rapidly changing. Every moment that he spent with Malfoy just further proved that the man had changed for the better since their school days. And then Susan had revealed that information about Malfoy's generous anonymous donations to people that Harry thought Malfoy would have sooner agreed to hug a manticore than even shake their hands. He was stunned by these actions, and this revelation of them had only made Malfoy more attractive in his eyes.
Instead of following this simple request to be left alone, Potter stepped forward and batted his hands away from the zipper. "Look, it's not that hard." He easily fitted the two halves of the zipper together and slid the pull up to the top fluidly. "There." He smiled, staring straight into his eyes while his hand lingered a second too long on the zipper.
"Seems like it. That's the past the prophecy is referring to. Best I can figure is the future refers to getting the current houses here to work together. But the past portion would come first seeing as if its not done now that the prophecy is activated or whatever you want to call it, Gryffindor's and Slytherin's ghosts would seek some sort of revenge."
Draco gave a hollow laugh, which made the raven-haired man raise an eyebrow.
Draco frowned, confused, as he turned to him. "Why?"
Harry frowned as Malfoy dropped his sleeve back into place. "So, this is your fault."
"Susan said she'll meet us downstairs and come shopping with us," Potter said.
about the blond, an emotion he had discovered to be capable of for Malfoy when he was sixteen. That day he had cast Sectumsempra on him and thought he had killed him. Now, seeing those scars of self-inflicted pain had brought that emotion right back. When had he made them? They seemed old. Maybe it had been during sixth year when Malfoy had been living in fear of Voldemort as he was forced to attempt a task not even the most feared wizard of all time would dare do. Did he still cut himself and was just better at hiding it now? Were there more marks elsewhere on his body?
"Possibly both. And since everything else in the prophecy seems to be literal, I'm taking the line about 'rain fire and venom' literally."
Potter downed the rest of his butterbeer and slid from the booth. He tossed a few sickles onto the table to pay Rosmerta for the drink. "One hour," he agreed.
"Then why the aggressive name?" Potter asked. "And what do you mean that this group has been around that long?"
Harry nodded. He had thought of that. If no witch or wizard had ever been able to locate the tombs before, they had to be enchanted to be hidden and likely also protected. In his mind, he had pictured something akin to a blast-ended skrewt guarding the entrance to Gryffindor's tomb. It would not surprise him in the slightest if both founders had devised tests of bravery and cunning that only people from their own houses could pass successfully to enter.
"Most everything I did between the ages of eleven and eighteen seemed impossible," Potter said, which Draco thought was completely unhelpful because he knew outside forces had intervened many times to save the Chosen One from expulsion or death.
"That doesn't make it easy, Potter! It only appears that way to you because you aren't the one having to do it. This is demeaning and pointless. It proves nothing about being cunning at all. Slytherin is just making this a task because it's amusing to him!" Malfoy scrubbed a hand over his face and huffed.
"Maybe they were all in on the secret and kept it all hushed up," Harry said. "Just because you all refuse to believe the affair could have happened doesn't change the fact that there is a prophecy saying it happened and the rift has to be mended."
"Get out!" he snapped and shoved the man's shoulders. "Merlin's beard, I could have been naked."
Draco didn't look at him. He just laid down and got himself comfortable so his arm position allowed them more slack on the chain. "Just stay on your side."
"So what is this all about?" Harry asked. "You seem to know a lot about it."
It appeared that sometime during the night, the pillows between them had gotten shoved aside. Malfoy was now lying flush against Harry's side, his head resting on Harry's shoulder and one of his hands splayed gently on Harry's chest.
Draco's sobs burst from him again, and this time, he didn't even try to quell them. "N-no, I..."
Malfoy turned scarlet. He was speechless for a moment and then chucked the handful of bones at the skeleton with a growl. "Just tell us how to free Slytherin and get out of here. I'm guessing you want to move on anyhow and that the only way to do that is to complete this challenge."
His heart beating wildly like it wanted to jump ship, Draco pushed his pants and boxer briefs down past his knees. Carefully, he knelt on the obsidian dais and began to coax his cock to life with his fingertips. "Ok..." His mouth was extremely dry from the nerves, and he swallowed painfully. "Go ahead."
"He was Muggleborn," Potter said softly, and some of the anger left Draco as he refocused on Potter and saw the gratitude written clearly on his face. "You donated to Muggles. And...the Weasleys...and your aunt Andromeda even though you hate both families."
"When Slytherin cut ties with Hogwarts and the other founders, he came to Egypt to study the more pure magic of the Egyptians. The pharaohs were often a line of pureblood wizards who also valued pureblood as blood of the gods or whatever, so Slytherin came here to work with them. Hufflepuff never agreed with Slytherin on blood status, but she was the most forgiving out of the four, just wanting peace between her friends again and hoping Gryffindor and Slytherin could mend their relationship, so she sought out Slytherin to try to bring him back to the school. It didn't work, but Slytherin and Hufflepuff became friends again. They kept in contact over the years until Slytherin requested she return to Egypt when he was on his deathbed. He told her of a great black pyramid he had built and hidden in the desert. Only a certain priest knew how to access it, and had made an Unbreakable Vow with him to kill himself inside the pyramid after he had performed Slytherin's burial rights so he could never speak of it. So, even Huffepluff didn't know where this pyramid was or how to access it. But, she did swear to Slytherin that she and her own prodigies would protect it for generations from those seeking to find his great tomb and rob it." She leaned back a bit and shrugged. "That's how the story goes at least, passed down through the generations of our group."
Minutes later, Harry gently lets go of Draco’s hands before pressing his palms against Draco’s hips, caressing them as he pulls out.
He inhales deeply. The pillow he has in his arms still smells of Harry — cigarettes and that rosewood perfume Draco gifts him every Christmas. Next to him is an empty space, where Harry should be, where Harry
The summer night in Barcelona radiates everything warm and beautiful. The world is under the canopy of a diamond sky; the stars scatter like freckles amongst the glow of the fireflies outside.
“So beautiful,” Harry says as though to himself, caressing the dip of Draco’s back like it’s the most precious thing he’s ever held. He leans down and kisses the dimples right above Draco’s arse, fitting his lips perfectly in the hollow of Draco’s spine.
“I was young and stupid and I wish I had loved you back then,” Harry kisses the scar right below Draco’s jaw, and Draco melts into him right away. “But I love you now, every piece of you,
There’s just one thing missing from his hands for now, and that’s tucked away in the little ring box in my desk at work. The one perk of the Researcher’s Guild is that Harry rarely snoops, too afraid of being accosted by the Soul Studies proteges. It’s an heirloom ring from my mother’s family, simple and gold with a little black diamond at the crest. The special part of the ring is hidden inside, but that inscription is only for his eyes.
The sight before him almost makes him break down all over again.
When Draco’s on the brink of tears from the pleasure, Harry retracts his fingers. Draco’s too busy catching his breath to watch Harry undress himself, but he figures he’ll have a lot more chances to see that in the future.
“I love your shoulders,” Harry says, almost too quietly that Draco strains to hear him even with the silence of the night. “How they’ve carried so much weight in the past…” he continues tracing every mark on Draco’s skin with his lips as though he’s building constellations out of everything Draco is.
Ahead of them, a thousand sunrises await.
“I’m sorry too,” Draco says, crossing the space between them and settling on the side of the bed opposite of Harry’s. He leans his weight on his left arm, causing Harry to look down at his left hand, where the black diamond of his engagement ring catches light from the lamp on their bedside.
s and worse spilled from their mouths like venom and poison. Neither of them had meant anything they said, but that doesn’t mean the words hurt less.

“You all ready? He asks stepping from the kitchen doorway. They all nodded. “Ok to the alley’s over got it. Corsair your good to apparate. Edward grabs his trunk please I’ve got Lord Potter. Ready go. Harry suddenly feels as if he is being sucked through a too-small straw.

“Mimsy be rights back.” Mimsy assured him as she popped away to return a minute later with Shepherd’s Pie and chips. “Anything’s else Masters be needing?”
"Not under Binns, it's why he's been sacked." Answered Neville.
"Good, then as we are all here I can move onto my next item of business. Amelia Bones, Minister Fudge, Headmaster Dumbledore, due to the complaints we have had over the past month since school has started I have no choice, and by order of the ICW Education committee have authorized the head of said committee Joseph Arkwright to do a full investigation into the running of Hogwarts. As the house of Potter has recently given protectorate status to two of the four Heirs of Hogwarts by writ of the Potter Inheritance testing fund, and been given the guardianship of a third house by right of the child's former head of house being a known fugitive, the House has asked that a full audit of the schools finances be done as well. As such you Delores Umbridge in your capacity of High Inquisitor are dismissed, you will for the moment retain your position of Defense against the Dark Arts Professor. Following in said vein effective immediately for blatant violation of the rights of heirs, Educational Decree 24 is hereby revoked."
Harry looks uncertainly at the figure standing before him "Are you a ghost or something?"
“Come Abraxas, he is but one boy.” Replied Narcissa interjecting.

“Hogwarts, I assume,” at Harry’s slight nod he continued. “Then I suggest all the ones you mentioned, an anti-wrinkle, an instant fold, and of course several warming charms. House?”
Students sat around their house tables asking questions of other students about the new fund. Though the High Inquisitor had cut off discussion that morning about it stating that it would be annulled, all the students had seen the entrance of the goblins right before dinner and the sour face of the Minister and some of his entourage. Dumbledore also looked as if his lemon drops were especially sour today.
"Thank you hat your help has been appreciated." With that Harry and all remaining students left the great hall.

"The fund affects no one Ministry madame, it affects the whole of the Empire, as such the House of Potter was in full rights to do as it has done. Furthermore the minister cannot simply silence it, or annul it. It will be proudly showcase in every Gringotts and the Ministry does not have enough foreign support to block it. Ten points to Gryffindor for cunning, and a further 10 points for thinking things through." Said Abraxas Malfoy, Harry smiled and went back to his breakfast. His eyes alight with pride.

In London, Sirius and the others, not having been informed that he had awakened, where scouring over documents and other such things to try to free Artemis, Arsenio, Silver, and Jean Marc, from the Ministers hands. Not having been privy to Harry’s earlier plans they had no knowledge of how to protect them.
“Yes, the fact of what he said to me was proof enough of that. The Goblins need to remember that they one against the ministry of magic not Albion, and the Potter house kneel only to the Crown of Albion.” Harry states, taking a few deep breathes to reign in his fury.
“Come Lord Le-Fay you know that this is not legal according to Albion laws, even attempting to do this…” Sirius was saying.
Harry had been even more impressed to have the goblins inform him that the at the end of October, construction on the casino would be finished at the Great Square in London. Harry had been pleased to hear the news and had already seen the advertisements in the Daily Prophet for the new business venture.
Harry walked out of the room unscathed to the surprise of all the goblins in the bank, Neville, and Alomar, who had all expected him to be carried out dead. Upon Neville asking what had happened Harry answered “We merely discussed how my Blood rites would work. I am sorry Crown Prince Alomar, I had every intention of celebrating the solstice with you but as circumstances stand, I will be undergoing blood Rites on the Solstice and will be returning to my homeland immediately afterwards. I’m sorry that our time together could not be longer.”
“What stays his hand?” Abraxas asks wearily, he is familiar with the story behind Michalis’s words and he had approved of the plan to silence Sirius.
“What are you talking about, Tonks? Neither Harry’s nor I’s mirrors have rang since before we left Hogwarts.
Lord Le-Fay was surprised as the Potter and Longbottom boys left the hall. From the comments around him he was learning that all was not as he had been told in Albion. It seemed he would have to be creative to truly remind the Potter brat his place, he was soon to be king no matter what those two said.

"That's not possible at the moment, somethings come up and the British ministry is fighting having troops in Britain at all, they're referencing all the sanctions against house Potter after the first Grindelwald war. I'm working my way through it, but these things take time, I will try my best to send you reinforcements, but I offer you no promises. I'm sorry. If this continues, I will not be going through the ICW, to take care of the ministry, I'll pull out the rights of my house and disband the ministry myself, for obstruction of the will, and power of the house of Potter, in reference to our royal duties."
Ted interrupted her before she could continue. "Most of them were not Family heads currently trying to keep a tight hold of their houses magics. You give him that and his houses magics will see it as a threat and all of us will be dead before we could even cast protego." Taking a chance, he looked at Harry who was beginning to sweat.
“Well now that does change things, what seems to be the issue, besides the Daily Prophet, as their smear campaign is sanctioned by the minister I cannot do anything about it.” She asked.
“Hem, Hem, this courtroom is no place for your lies Mr. Potter.” Said a pink toad lady sitting next to the Minister.
Harry turned hearing the further cracks of apparition from behind him and saw approximately four dozen Potter Hit-Wizards arrive to aid in the rescue, a cheer went up from the ICW volunteers and investigators that had already been there. Harry smiled, turning towards the building before asking investigator Smith, "Have you already gotten the readings you need magically for your investigation?"

"I agree, Regulus and I both had the tests done for fun, and both had different houses on them." Sirius said.
"Silencio, well that was rather anti-climactic, Harry". Draco said helping Harry to his feet being very careful to not touch the journal but merely raise his eyebrows at it.
Malfoy and Neville seemed to simultaneously choke on something as they looked at Harry with respect in their eyes.
It didn’t matter to Susan that the Alliance had held since before the fall of the Kings. Potter was nothing but a lying showboating Gryffindor to intent on keeping his fame to see those that got hurt along the way. Like Justin in the second year, and the entire school in third, now Cedric was gone, killed, no doubt by Potter in his mad desire for power. It would be nice to finally see justice done.
Mathew's turned back to the students after silencing Dumbledore. "The date was July 16th, 1942. The day was the annual Potter family picnic, it was a reunion of sorts, all ten cadet branches of house Potter, along with many of the house vassals living inside Britain were in attendance. They had chosen a field abreast of the Britain great square for it that year. Over a thousand people had gathered for the picnic. Charlus and his wife, his son Fleamont and his wife, along with a few cousins and their wives, had gone to the manor for a family rite. The field had nothing for the kids to do, so the adults had transfigured a humongous playground with things for kids of all ages to do, from the youngest to the oldest. Those transfigured items still stand today, in that field."
"Speaking of moving forward, Marcus, and Tyler, you've become awfully protective, of them the past few weeks, since they entered your care." Neville commented.
Watch the skies, read the signs
With his words, the room dropped an uncomfortable 10 degrees. “By your address, words and attire, I assume that you are my dear Cousin Vladimir. Allow me to introduce myself so that in the future, you do not stain your honor in assuming that you are better than another. I am Haldris James Potter, Lord of the Most Ancient and Most Noble House of Potter, Heir to the Most Ancient and Most Noble House of Black. I call this meeting of the House of Potter to Order, Mopsy, please bring in extra seats and enlarge the room as necessary and make sure that we are all assembled here.” The room was quiet as the house elves worked, and the rest of the family gathered. Alexandria tried to speak but was cut off by a sharp glare from Harry, he quickly softened it accepting a hug from young Gabrielle in the next instant. Once everyone had gathered, he spoke. “Some of you I very much look forward to getting to know, others of you are on shaky ground with me. At the end of this meeting, I will give you all time to speak, to bring up any issues you may have or any new developments I need to handle. I will warn you now that though I have just turned 15, I will not allow you to run roughshod over me however nor will I ignore advise you may give to me as you are my elders. Some of you I will ask to temporarily relocate here to Britain until I am of age, others I may appoint to tasks you find yourself untrained for, it will be a learning experience for all of us. If you give your respect to me, and I will give you my respect as well. Honor our house and its current needs, and in the future, you may have a boon that you may ask of me.”
“But my Lord that is not all, the boy also asked for Abilities and a Legacy test not given by the British branch since the Wizengamot passed the law over such things. The boy is an heir of both Ancestral lines and the line of Pendragon. Yes, the Titles are Blood Locked but he could someday…”

"But first how do you feel?" He asked finally giving Haldris a chance to speak.
"Did you really think Haldris Potter, that I was idle while imprisoned in Nurmengard. I didn't walk away from Henry Potters corpse without a few key details as to the past of the house of Potter. My forces have been silently active since the end of the war, searching in the shadows for the last few things I need, both to complete my goals and to overpower your house. Did you believe that after the secrets I learned that I would leave your house alone? The house that of the mere status of Noble, was strong enough to not only garner the attention of two high ancestral houses, but to forge alliances with them, to then turn around and forge an alliance with the house of Evanstar that stood till the line entered dormancy. If house Potter hadn't bound its true Power away generations ago, how long would I truly have lasted against Charlus, how would Marvolo had truly faired against your father?
“I was not aware your father had passed or that your family had grown weary of using the Michalis’s Office, Heir Calmir.” Said a woman from the open doorway behind the secretary’s desk.

"What all do you have?" Neville asked.
“Enough!” Said Harry as the magic in the room grew oppressive and cold, he paused allowing a chance for others to speak. “Lord Abbot, Madame Bones all alliance’s between our houses are at this moment broken, all contracts are null and void. Your heirs have attacked the heir of another and you have spoken nothing of censure, I will not align myself with houses with no honor. As for your allegations, I suggest for once you take a good long look at the Hogwarts rumor mill Ladies. Your lives weren’t in danger third year as Sirius was after a rat not you, and I did not enter the tournament last year. Bartimaeus Crouch Jr. did as he confessed to doing so before he was kissed by order of the minister. Odd considering I thought that order could only be given with the permission of the Wizengamot.”
"Generations span between James and Michalis, I fall between them, for my time, Rome was not yet a distant memory, however Arthur had passed, and Albion was expanding its borders. We were not yet the heads of Arthurs cumulative armies, but we did head the armies that hailed from our lands. The time had come and Arthurs grandson still yet newly crowned the second Pendragon King, made a call to arms, and due to a situation in the family at the time, I as his heir led the men to battle."

“Not know but you may be able to in time.” Alomar answered. Harry sat as the air went out of him. Neville just stared at Alomar. Who continued, “I understand that it may not be as well known overseas, but I at least thought it was understood that Dementors are not natural creatures, they are servants of death.”
After the train left the station Harry's compartment filled up quick many students liking the different style of train car. Harry spotted Draco with his perfects badge, slip into the back but didn't comment. If he didn't bother Harry, he wasn't going to antagonize him. Harry, Arsenio, Artemis, Silver, Jean-Marc, Neville, and Ron once he joined them talked of many things, before the subject of Gringotts came up, more importantly, account managers.
"Now see here Mathews you have no right…" Dumbledore interrupted him.
"As will house Black" said Sirius.
“Well then there right there is your proof Minister. I left Number 4 Privet Drive, and all of Surrey entirely the morning of the 2nd at 9 A.M. as my two bodyguards standing outside can attest to if the Wizengamot so desires to question them. I left Privet Drive and was inside Gringotts going over financial and family matters as I am now fifteen and an heir of my house, I was there until 2 p.m. At which point my guards escorted me to Potter Manor where I opened the manor from lockdown, and I have not left without my guards since then. When the dementors attacked us soon after I had unlocked the grounds and set the wards to accept our entrance my guards cast Patronus charms one apiece to drive off the two dementors that suddenly attacked.”
“Okay?” Harry asks softly. Draco can feel Harry’s thighs tremble from holding his own weight up.
I know him like no one else does. The
Draco hasn’t even realised he’s started crying again until Harry leans his forehead against his, allowing Draco to look deeper in the infinite green of Harry’s eyes. They’re even more beautiful this close, if that’s even possible. Evergreen flecked with gold and silver, like a forest adorned with a million fireflies, like his favourite Matcha sprinkled with glimmering gold flakes.
Hot breath fans over his cleft, and then, slowly, Harry leans closer and
Fighting was the very last thing Draco thought they would be doing the night before their wedding. Alas, here they are. Or here Draco is, rather, laying in bed
After a failed attempt to stop the tears from falling from his eyes, Draco leaves the bathroom with a heavy heart, casting a couple of moisturising charms to at least rehydrate his skin.
Draco’s breathy laugh turns into a breathless moan when Harry turns him over on his stomach, kissing down his back and grasping his hips.
. “Come for me,” it sounds like a request — he doesn’t really know what it is — he’s never said this to Harry before. But he figures he’s doing the right thing because when turns his head, he’s met by the best view he’s ever laid his eyes on.
,” Draco pants, grasping Harry’s broad shoulders as Harry’s lips trail down his jaw.
Draco expects Harry to retort, to be angry that Draco doesn’t seem to take him seriously. But Harry only laughs, the sound melodic along with the faint rustle of the tree branches dancing along with the summer wind.
Even now, with the many years they’ve already spent loving each other, Draco remains uneasy about the idea of baring himself before Harry.
When he’s sleeping like this and I'm running my fingers over the surface of his palm, lighter than a feather, I can’t help but imagine his touch on my cheeks, on my skin. In sleep, Harry is perfectly dormant, but awake, he is the opposite, alive, vibrant, moving and touching and
“I’m perfectly fine, my sweet. You know I’m very fond of the gardens,” Narcissa’s warm smile is like the sun, replacing the coldness that has formed within Draco’s heart.
Draco bites his bottom lip as another moan threatens to spill from his mouth when Harry fills him with his warmth.
“And I, you,” Harry says, before going back to worshipping every inch of Draco, his stubble tickling at Draco’s skin.
I think my favorite scar is the one on the outside of his pinky. It’s small, a few centimetres, if that. Harry likes to make up ridiculous stories about how he got it, ranging from a remnant of his Horntail battle to a rogue gnome attack to a potions accident gone wrong.
He was nervous too, and more obvious about it than I, and sometime between our eyes meeting and my reaching for him, he managed to wound himself. We didn’t notice until we stepped apart and he remembered the pain. It was too late to heal it properly, not without dittany on hand easily, so I whispered one of my old field charms to clean him up. He’s still got the scar from it, curved along the heel of his hand, a reminder of the start of our ‘us.’
that Draco never wants to let go.
“Are you still sad?” Harry asks out of nowhere, still looking at the calm waves under what’s left of the daylight.
“Did you know you get this look on your face when you’re annoyed with something?” Harry kisses Draco’s forehead, right between his eyebrows. “You scrunch your face right here. Sometimes I’m afraid you’ll get wrinkles.”
It’s all choices, every minute of every day. I choose to lie here, staring at the single scarred knuckle on Harry’s right hand, and the little white mark by his wrist from an ages-ago flyaway spark. I choose to let him touch me, to allow those hands to press deep affection into my skin. He treats me like his charmwork, like I’m tangible and beautiful, like he can see magic in me. The intensity he carries in his gaze scares me; it turns any gentle touch of his fingertips over my knuckles into an unspoken kiss.
My real secret is hidden in the palm of his hands. See, the greatest joy of the flung-out way he sleeps is that I can curl up beside him and look at them. I’ll never tell him, but his hands are my favorite part of him. I’ve always thought that hands are supposed to say everything you need to know about a person, but I didn’t believe it till the first morning I spent staring at Harry’s.
It’s minutes or hours later, Draco can’t tell, when Harry’s finally in all the way. His hips dig deliciously into Draco’s flesh with every little thrust, with Harry aiming to find the right angle. When he does, they both moan in unison. Harry shifts the slightest bit and punches another moan right out of Draco when his cock sinks deeper into him.
Harry mouths the words back, or so Draco thinks he does, before pulling away and laying beside Draco, right where he belongs.
Later that night, Draco stands at the balcony of his and Harry’s home. Wrapped in Harry’s arms, Draco’s back to Harry’s chest, as they watch the pale moon dip in the shadows at the height of the night.
to, because Draco will
okay.”
Draco, feeling a little more brave this time, repeats, “I love you, Harry,” before crossing the space between them and kissing Harry, mouthing his love into his mouth because his words simply aren’t enough.
“I love you tonight, when I’ve had a lot of wine,” Harry says, almost sheepishly. “And I love you tomorrow, when I’m stone cold sober.”
“You’re beautiful,” Harry says, which only causes Draco’s embarrassment to flare.
And then, Harry rolls his hips as he’s pressed flush against Draco, and Draco lets out a sound he would’ve been embarrassed about if he wasn’t so lost in a sea of heavenly pleasure.
“I know,” Harry mumbles against Draco’s heated skin. “Just let me take care of you, yeah?”
Draco falls in love first.
There’s a little callous along the inside of his right wand finger, where his wand rests day in and day out as he’s hard at work on his charms. I’ve offered him things to clear it away but I think he likes it, like it’s a sign that he’s a wizard, validation in case he ever forgets. He’s a bit odd like that sometimes, but I suppose it’s only to be expected with his shit Muggle family.
Draco can only moan Harry’s name in response, “Harry, right
He lifts his face from the crook of his arm to watch Harry coat his fingers with oil. Once Harry grasps Draco’s cheeks again, he returns to burying his face into the sheets.
Layers of sweat cover both of them like blankets; Draco moves against Harry’s cock, taking him deeper and deeper with each thrust.
Harry looks golden, basking under the peach-coloured sunset. Today is the last day of Eighth Year.
two hours ago, right before an argument brewed from the depths of Draco’s insecurities and Harry’s obstinacy.
It’s a sight to die for — Harry coming with his head thrown back, the soft light from the window forming a circle around his raven curls like a halo, his brows furrowed, and lips hanging open as he moans Draco’s name repeatedly.
Draco shifts in an attempt to snake his arm down his torso so he can grasp his cock, but Harry stops him by holding both of his hands against the sheets.
The first time I saw him, after we were both ready to set aside the past, he was working on a protection charm, and I watched for longer than I’d like to admit. There was no sign of the famed War injury in his devilish focus, his elbows stabilized in braces on the workbench as he toiled over a tiny metal pendant, enameling charms onto the surface like glass on copper. I knew it was protection magic from the smell, like peppermint and hospitals, sterile, stabile, and something else too.
Harry sits on their bed, his back towards Draco and facing the window with the view of the trees and fireflies outside.
But Harry’s words remain hanging in the air like a cloud of grief looming over Draco.
Of course, Harry takes this as an opportunity to slip his tongue between Draco’s lips. Draco moans into the kiss, more times than he can count, and Harry swallows the sounds like he’s desperate for it.
“What?” Draco asks. He heard Harry perfectly well the first time, but his confession still feels like something out of Draco’s wildest dreams.
. Merlin knows where Harry’s at this ungodly hour.
. He always initiates kisses with one gentle hand against my cheek, drawing me into him, asking my permission, though I always give it. I am less graceful, as I’m far more likely to grab him by the collar and kiss him senseless.
I think he would say yes, if I asked.
— for anything,” his throat burns at the words that leave his mouth.
The sunrise unfolds before him — a series of pastel-coloured swirls in the sky. He thinks of the next sunrise he gets to watch with Harry, and the sunset too. And the next ones after those…
“Harry,” Draco says—
Harry seems to have been frozen in his position on the bed, with his body turned halfway towards Draco and his fingers fiddling with the hem of his shirt as a nervous habit.
“I love you,” Draco mumbles into the heated kiss.
Before they Floo home, Narcissa stops Draco by the fireplace, kisses his cheek, and whispers, “You’ve chosen the right man, my darling Draco. I’m very happy for you.”
Draco kisses Harry, softly, like how he would’ve kissed him back when they were fourteen at the Yule Ball, like how Harry kissed him under their last sunset at Hogwarts at eighteen.
be fine, except it
Harry, though, he’s got the most unusual fingerprints I’ve ever seen. Old lore says that wandless magic works by pooling through the lines and wrinkles of our hands. It collects in the winding ravines of our fingertips, like dust particles on the air, clinging to the perfect whorls of our fingertips. The delta on my fingers is supposed to be especially amplifying, but I think his pattern must be even more special.
He said my name, my full name and title too, without looking up. I approached the bench and watched as though disinterested, though I was anything but. That was the start to it, and more or less, the sum of it, though lately I’m allowed to watch him at work — for research purposes, I tell him, though I think he knows I love to see his mind at work — so long as I’m quiet, and I’m always quiet.
I choose to try my hardest at making things right, though I know I will never fully atone. The day I stopped trying to reach that impossibility, I realised that the small kindnesses are worth more. On hard days, I’ll bring two steaming cups of coffee, though I don’t drink the swill, when I visit Harry as at least one half of his cabal is usually about. I read, and I listen, and I try to learn and unlearn all I can, and by some great stroke of luck I have yet to fully understand, Harry’s here with me in it all.
And so he kisses Harry for as long as he can, until he runs out of air to breathe and all he ever knows of is the taste of
“I love your scars,” Harry says, and a pang of uneasiness suddenly blooms within Draco. “I know you hate them, and I will never forgive myself for—“
For a moment, they both freeze, looking at each other as though time has paused and the world has stopped spinning.
“I’m sure you’ll age gracefully,” Harry hums, kissing the tip of Draco’s nose. “At age forty-five you’ll be in the cover of Witch-Weekly, and all the teenagers will pant over you.”
Draco peers over Harry to tell him to
It’s just that we used to sit side by side on the couch reading, but more and more we end up with my feet in his lap or his head in mine and I’ll read to him. He closes his eyes and it’s the most peaceful he is when awake, none of that scowl he usually carries staring down at the page. So if I’ve set aside my academic texts in order to read the novel he was last struggling over, well, he doesn’t need to know that either.
“Draco, hey,” Harry repeats, now holding Draco’s face with both of his calloused hands. “You’re okay,
Harry starts by ridding Draco of his nightshirt. It slips off his shoulders, and before gooseflesh can even form on his skin, Harry’s fingertips replace the silk, casting a warming charm that wraps around Draco like a comforting blanket.
His wandless magic is like no other. I’ve been training with a wand since I could hold it, honing my fine motor skills around the hilt, perfecting each flick of the wrist and spellwork’s motion. My wand is like an extension of my fingertips, but Harry, he moves like the magic is his breath. His pure, unbridled power pools into the palm of his hand like an afterthought. It’s like the way that smoke curls out of the corner of his lips when I catch him sneaking a cig in the garden; it’s that gentle twist of grey slipping from his lips like he can’t hold it all inside. I’ve never witnessed magic like it, and it’s only more powerful with his wand in hand.
“My love what has happened?” Silas asked from the behind her.
"All those with the mark have been acquitted by that single action, all the death eaters, even those with previous sentences in Azkaban have all been acquitted, even the Lestranges. Furthermore, you can't even declare blood-line feud for their previous actions without also declaring against the house of Le-Fay and that would include all the vassals of said houses which is almost half of the wizarding families that existed at the time of the last King."
“Gryffindor,” Harry answered.
“Now that presentations are finished when will you be handing over the lordship to my dearest mother. We have made many plans on what to do to make the house great once more and pull it out of the squalor it has fallen into.” Said, Vladimir.
“I attempted to call the two of you as did many others, but no calls went through, I called Griphook and asked him to message you knowing that they have a secondary message system set up with Harry.” Tonks continued.
Draco spoke again "I suggest you and your friends leave heir Macmillan. You are no longer welcome here." With that, the group left seeing that they were very outnumbered.
“Heir Calmir, Heir Alrick Calmir, my apologies I simply could not help myself,” Alrick said.
"You have to understand that over ninety percent of the elder nobility are sworn to one of those houses and stand as part of that houses court. Without sitting heads those ties can't be broken. Even if someone stepped forward tomorrow and took up one of those title's those house that wish to break ties couldn't until they passed whatever stipulation the head at the time wanted from that house." Blaise Zabini continued.
"I am Donavan Krum you all my call Professor Krum. You are all my fifth through seventh year students. Because of scheduling conflicts all of you were forced to give a usually scheduled free period for this class as such we will be having the 5th through 7th year tutoring session Tuesday through Thursday during the last period of the day. I will not be altering or changing my curriculum between your grades, I will be training you all the same, as such all of you will be able to sit your NEWT not by time May comes but by Yule break hits, for one simple reason. Can any of you guess."

“Of course, human, follow me.” The Goblin responded as he turned to leave. Harry followed him back to Sharptooth’s office. Once they arrived, he sat in the familiar chair opposite of Sharptooth. “Greetings, Sharptooth, may your gold grow and your blade be ever sharp.”
“It seems the magic of the land agrees.” An elder voice frim the back agrees and all Harry can see is a well-dressed fashionable man sitting among the higher ranking seats. “Let the transcripts for the trail of the current Lord Black be summoned.” A scribe was sent to fetch them, and the assembled carefully waited until he returned.

In Potions they had finished mastering the basics and were covering some theory before their first expected fifth year brewing class at the end of October. It was slightly boring, but he was finally understanding why so many of his potions had exploded before.
“It was a violent death, front what I’ve heard child, it may be a decade or two before they awaken. Especially with the manor on lockdown until now.” Harry jumped as one of the portraits further down in the room spoke. Turning to look at the portrait Harry was rather stunned by the people he saw. Glancing towards the bottom of the two groups of portraits his eyes widened.
"Ok, so why was it necessary for you to add specific guardian clauses to the fund?" asked a first-generation fourth year from down the table.
"You, filthy half-blood" snapped Hannah pulling her wand on Harry. Only to be met with half a dozen wands pointing straight back at her.
"Well, house Longbottom will also give one million to the fund," answered Neville.

"I have every right to declare blood feud just for what she did in her capacity of heiress while our houses were still aligned. Mercy stayed my hand, I suggest you reign your houses heiress in before my mercy runs short." Harry interrupted.
“Would you be willing to certify that?” asked Harry politely.
"James spoke of you, he said you saved the family in a time when we had few allies, much like now." Harry responded.
"Serpentis Levine your new History of Magics Professor appointed by the board, the man to his right is the professor to the new class of Wizarding Culture and Traditions, and to my left a few seats down is Delores Umbridge your new Defense Against the dark arts Professor. Now let us allow the sorting to resume, shall we." Questioned the Headmaster.
"I agree with Harry, but let's listen to the other prophecy and then we can return to the house and talk about it."
“No, it was then however that he took his bolder stance of starting to actually attack some of the family manors and squares. After the attack at Godric’s Hollow, we tried tracking you down, and succeeded. You were in the care of Alrick’s parents for two whole weeks while they tried to get Sirius Black a trial. Then Dumbledore came with Auror’s and took you back to your aunt’s and uncles. We were forbidden from contracting you as all vassals and cadets were by Albus Dumbledore and the Wizengamot, Dumbledore said the reason you had all been in hiding was a threat from within the family, so the Wizengamot unanimously voted for it with no proof. As such we couldn’t even offer our aid last year during the tournament. But you have made contact now and it changed things. On that depressing note let us continue with our shopping, where to first Harry?” asked Edward.
