He tossed it back onto the table and turned toward the fire, thinking about collapsing into one of the armchairs—only to jump sky-high to find Sirius' head in the fire.
They stood there staring at each for several moments. The fairy lights danced around Malfoy, his expression not exactly open, but not closed off either. As they stared at each other, it began to snow, and in that moment, Malfoy was beautiful.
Generally, lately, Harry had been avoiding the Great Hall whenever he could, which included sulking in his rooms until he couldn't put off leaving them any longer. Hermione had been waiting for him in the common room, and she had with her Rita Skeeter's article.
funny," Hermione said sarcastically to Pansy Parkinson and her gang of Slytherin girls, who were laughing harder than anyone, "really
He could tell she just barely kept from rolling her eyes. "Mr Malfoy, I have checked you over twice now, and I have found nothing—"
He didn't know why it was a big deal. He didn't know why he was making it a big deal to himself. Harry thought of Professor McGonagall's and Hermione's encouraging words, but at the same time, he thought of the other things they said. Professor McGonagall's confidence that there would be backlash enough to need the staff's support. Hermione admitting she never confessed about her uncles because of what happened in primary over it. He thought of Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon's words.
They arrived in the dungeons right when Snape was opening the doors, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione took their spot with Neville in the back, partnering up respectively.
Please remember I said this started as purely self-indulgent because this chapter is absolutely self-indulgent. It's almost Monday, so I decided to go ahead and post this with hopes of posting the next chapter in the morning which actually introduces more actual plot and things.
meeting like that—" Malfoy's eyebrows shot up even further. "No! I meant!" He sighed, frustrated with himself and rubbed his face. "I meant… I… Something's come up, and I can't meet tonight."
He thought about writing Sirius, to see if there was any way he could talk to him sooner than scheduled. He decided against it, though, knowing Sirius was taking too big a risk as it was.
He rolled over and peeked through his bed curtains to find the miniature Horntail still asleep on his bedside table. He looked up at the window and saw it was just barely dawn.
As he turned to follow Professor McGonagall out, he caught sight of the Slytherin table. Karkaroff was leading Victor Krum out, the headmaster looking excited but Krum looking serious and solemn. Unable to help himself, Harry searched the rest of the table, seeking out blond hair. When he found him, Malfoy was already looking at him, expression bored. When they locked eyes, however, Malfoy's face briefly flickered through several emotions Harry couldn't name, then he gave Harry a slow, albeit small, nod.
Malfoy slammed the Charms book shut, turning sharply toward the basilisk, jabbed his wand toward it and barked, "
My mother was over the moon to receive so many cards! I did indeed buy one for each well-wish comment and wrote down what you said. She's pretty weak, so she didn't have the energy to elaborate anything, but the nurse told me that they are lining her window, and she keeps showing them to the staff!
"I'm not delusional! And I'm not a liar! I don't know how to prove to you what happened last year and first year, but I can prove that the basilisk thing did happen."
— would be rooting for Harry to succeed. Or just stay alive, which Malfoy clearly had to hope if he wanted to come back down—
of all people, this whole time, thought Harry was a liar. Making up grand stories to be heroic and famous instead of actually barely surviving one trauma after another. Harry thought he knew the truth, was just spreading that Harry was lying just to, oh, he didn't know, bully Harry and isolate him. But he really thought that? For real? It was unacceptable. It was simply unacceptable.
They hadn't been able to get rid of the rotting smell completely, but Malfoy did a good job vanishing the worst of it. He also had loads of ingredients and herbs, part of the complicated burden of the harvest, that covered the smell pretty well. Malfoy still needed a stool to be able to reach whatever part he was working on, which meant he inevitably would be having Harry go back and forth between him and the chest-work-station. Harry had found a mat of sorts during one of the times he got away with poking around it, and that mat he stomped to and sat on now, in a good position to be Malfoy's runner. Malfoy never protested nor moved it.
"Want one, Ron?" he snapped. Ron looked startled at having been addressed. "You could probably enlarge it, stick it to your Canon's poster. I can even autograph it for you, how's that?"
"... and now Hagrid's just shown me what's coming in the first task, and it's dragons, Sirius, and I'm a goner."
"You don't actually believe a word of that article, do you?" Harry asked, sounding flat to his own ears. He was curious, though. He found he truly wanted to know what Malfoy thought.
"Yes. Harry Potter needed a platonic partner for the ball, so we became friends." She smiled brightly, and Harry was reminded that Ginny warned Luna was bullied. It saddened him to think she was only doing this because she wanted a friend, any friend.
Also, please note that the Vanishing Charm is actually technically a Transfiguration spell. I didn't know that when writing this, I thought it was Charms, because you know, Vanishing "Charm". But according to the HP wiki, it's Transfig. Please suspend some disbelief for me there; in this little fic, it's Charms.
This apparently had Malfoy assuming he and his work were boring. Which, the work was a little not to mention gross, but Harry moreover felt himself relaxing to Malfoy's voice when it wasn't so sharp and ruthless. Regardless, the assumption led to a snoopy lecture about the, oh so important, research and delicate task that was harvesting a basilisk. That really
Malfoy, one hand in his pocket and looking as casual as ever, merely looked down at the nails of his other hand. "Haven't seen Potter around, hm?"
As such, even this isn't edited and as checked as it usually is, which is already poor. My quality is already low— so seriously, if any native English speakers want to volunteer to be a beta, please let me know. To be honest, the only perk would be to get to know what's going to happen before anyone else. :/ But I promise to be as entertaining as possible, and your thoughts, critiques, and suggestions will take priority! Think about it… This story can literally be half yours… *waggles eyebrows*
Draco eyed him, eyed the dark Chamber, seemed to want to ask something, but then he just nodded sharply.
They spent that Sunday in the library researching everything they could. They piled their table with every book they could about dragons and any subject that might sound useful against them. They skipped lunch, and Harry was set to skip dinner too—he really did not have an appetite. Hermione didn't argue but ducked out to grab a quick supper herself, most likely going to grab a sandwich or something for Harry later.
The Slytherins didn't seem comfortable enough to go without robes anywhere but around the lake. Harry wasn't quite sure why so many Slytherins could be seen throughout the day going in and out of the boathouses, but most of the time, they were a lot more casually dressed. It was hard to see them in detail when not directly on the grounds, but Harry could make out the boys from the stone terraces or steps directed that way. They were usually always joking with each other, and joking Slytherins apparently entailed a lot of playful shoving. Harry could see how easy it would be, for a playful shoving back and forth could turn into—
wizards and more than little sadness as Dobby immediately attempted to punish himself for saying anything.
"Right…" Malfoy considered Harry for a long moment, and Harry tried not to fidget. "I would say great minds think alike, but considering one mind is yours…" he trailed off, pulling out a hand from a pocket to inspect his fingernails in what Harry knew was postering.
It was the tournament's fault as well. If he wasn't in the bloody thing, he might have been able to put off even thinking about it. Firmly placing it in the avoidance bin in his mind and cozied up to denial like the old friend it was. Instead, he cracked under the pressure of everything, making him focus on the easier question of,
She smirked. "Lovely… I don't suppose you'd like to give an interview, would you? Share some of your experience of magical creatures? The
Malfoy looked like that was debatable but did finally seem to drop some more of his guard and came closer.
to him, as if Malfoy was going to forget. Then he followed Hermione into the library where he pretended to study but was instead anxiously waiting for when it was time to meet him.
Strangely enough, Malfoy nudged her with the elbow she had attached herself to. The movement made Harry look at Malfoy again, and his chest constricted. Harry had seen Malfoy's pale cheeks pink several times, but usually, it was in anger. Or humiliation, such as the ferret incident. Right now, Harry didn't know what was causing the light pinking, but his brain short-circuited and
In a way, Malfoy always somehow felt a little safe for Harry because when his face was pinched up in hateful judgment, it wasn't attractive. When his lips were curled around mean words, they were the furthest thing from tempting. When his hands were balled up in fists, Harry couldn't see just how long his fingers were. When his head was thrown back in cruel laughter, his Adam's apple that began to make itself known sometime before third year wouldn't actually bob up and down.
"You…" Malfoy gave a quiet laugh—a real one, at that, his lips giving way to the smile. "You used to
"Look at that!" Bagman was yelling. "Will you look at that! Our youngest champion is the quickest to get his egg! Well, this is going to shorten the odds on Mr Potter!"
Pansy was getting harder to get rid of. He had predicted this when she kissed him at the Yule Ball, but it didn't make it any easier. He had been happy to go along with it. She was tolerable, after all, and very entertaining. He knew she cared for him too. His parents didn't much care what he got up to during school, as long as he knew that after schooling was finished, he was to marry a respectable pureblood witch.
"Oh, right." Harry blinked again. His feet automatically carried him out of the room and to his next lesson, but Harry could honestly say it wasn't consciously done.
giving Malfoy extra favouritism. Harry thought back to how strongly Malfoy reacted to Harry's comments on Snape and frowned down at his book.
Schooling his features, Harry carefully stepped behind a suit of armour to hide his Cloak and map (he definitely didn't want Malfoy knowing about those) and then stepped out.
His dress robes were black and had many complicated parts to it. The seamstress at Madam Malkins walked him through which part went where, and Harry was pleased he mostly remembered the instructions. When he was finished, he returned to the mirror and inspected himself.
and mocked Harry for bringing something he could so easily lose in the Chamber. Which proved embarrassing when Harry did indeed lose it. To as not highlight that embarrassment, Harry forewent looking for it, hoping that maybe he could come back some other time without Malfoy and search for it and that in the meantime, the thing wouldn't trying eating off the basilisk.
to have a partner, and if he wanted to bring… Mortification surged through him, making him hot everywhere.
Harry focused on Malfoy in the corner of his eye, who was standing on his tip-toes on the stool—it now looked more like a small ladder although Harry couldn't see it properly with limited lighting—to hunch further over the large creature. Both his elbows were fanned out and moving up and down almost like a slow the chicken dance.
Malfoy snorted. "This, I know." Then he deflated some, looking away to study a bush. "So, is that part of the criteria to be Precious Potter's friend now? Oddity and questionable mental stability."
"The problem there is one, we don't know how the rot of lower intestines have affected the organs around it, and two, we don't know what else is in the water to have affected the tail. After all, we are for all intense and purposes, in a
He couldn't help keeping the miniature Horntail with him and felt proud when the doofer learned how to crawl out of his pocket and began scurrying around Harry's person. Ron likewise thought it was brilliant, but Hermione shied away from it and eyed it judgmentally.
"That is both admittedly impressive yet equally disappointing," Malfoy said, looking interested despite himself.
Harry thought he could return the sentiment at the moment. But Malfoy abruptly turned back to his work and continued, so Harry didn't question him. Just shook his head and added the death to the list.
He stopped around the corner from the corridor where he knew Malfoy was already waiting, stowed away his Cloak and map in his large robe pockets, and took deep breaths to calm himself.
"Not directly," Malfoy interrupted. He had lifted his head more, but he had let his hair fall around his eyes, keeping his face mostly dark. Harry couldn't figure out his tone. "Only a strong deflection or dissuasion would work. There are only, at most, three vulnerable parts to a dragon that kills it."
Snape let the seconds tick by, the room becoming quieter and quieter. Then he responded lowly, his voice carrying regardless, "A real apology from a Gryffindor and perhaps a genuine lesson learned for someone whose head is as thick as yours. Hell must have frozen over. Ten points from Gryffindor for your carelessness… and, one point to Gryffindor for your fairness."
"I know, Harry, but I've been reading between the lines of that Skeeter woman's article last month about Moody. Moody was attacked the night before he started at Hogwarts. Yes, I know she says it was another false alarm—"
"Yeah," Harry said, holding out his hand. She didn't seem to notice. "Er, and you're Luna Lovegood."
Harry was laughing at Luna's running commentary on Professor Flitwick's dancing when Hermione joined them, looking near to tears.
"He's probably doing it on purpose," Ron grumbled to Harry as Harry tapped out the number of stirs they needed. "He won't think it's a successful lesson unless someone
"Right. Thank you, Professor," he said. He straightened, wanting to walk in there with his head held high.
Sirius gave him a small smile. "I don't think it was a false alarm. I think someone tried to stop him from getting to Hogwarts. I think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult with him around. And no one's going to look into it too closely; Mad-Eye's heard intruders a bit too often, but that doesn't mean he can't still spot the real thing. Moody was the best Auror the Ministry ever had."
Stupid Potter. Stupid Potter, with his stupid face, and stupid glasses, and stupid scar, and stupid hair, and stupid eyes, and stupid skin, and stupid arse, and stupid fitted robes, with his stupid morals, stupid voice, stupid stubbornness, stupid talent, stupid...
The hour made that almost impossible. No one was around, and Harry had no idea where any of the professors' quarters were. In the end, he decided to wait in the staff room, purposely trying not to remember the time he and Ron were secreted there and overheard about Ginny being taken to the Chamber of Secrets. Instead, he focused on the miniature Horntail squirming unhappily in his pocket, thinking about what to do or say.
Next, Harry attempted to show off his miniature dragon, still a rather impressive doofer, if he thought so himself, but Malfoy was altogether
"To keep him from doing anything else. And honestly? A bit of revenge. He was also useful to test out the stone-slide first, and I figured it could help to have a shield."
"No one else ever talked about it, so I just didn't bring it up, I guess. Some kids made fun of me in primary, but here, the chance of anyone knowing I had gay Muggle uncles were so low, I just sort of... "
What was probably the most unhelpful and ridiculous thing about it, however, was that currently, Harry felt like he had an opportunity to gain an ally. Which if that didn't speak to how lonely and desperate he had been feeling lately, he didn't know what would.
"Sorry, I, er… I…" He shook his head. "I have a plan, I just." He took a deep breath. "I guess, where I need to start is to ask… w-what are your thoughts… on… things…"
"Oh, absolutely," Luna nodded. She then began to ponder on how long water kept its memory and if any of the water could have come from another country and rained where it was then collected. Harry listened, trying his damnest to follow along, and waited until they were up the staircase to send Ron and Hermione a baffled look. They were trailing behind, looking equally baffled.
Ravenclaw students would wear their uniforms without robes most often in the library. Harry knew their tower was second highest in the whole castle, and the more he observed, the more he began to realise that taking that many stairs so many times a day gave way to really fit legs and… very firm arses, to be frank. While other students utilised lower shelves to reach for high-up books, Ravenclaws, particularly the boys who were taller, merely had to stretch a little. Some of their untucked shirts lifted up to reveal how form-fitted their trousers were.
"Yeah," Harry nodded. He was steadfast staring at the wood of the bridge as they walked slowly, refusing to meet her eyes. "Y'know, things like… romance and stuff."
Malfoy didn't say a word as they made the trek into the Chamber of Secrets. He stopped Harry before he opened the second entrance to perform that invisible bubble charm again, and Malfoy took his sweet time unloading his bag, organising the things, and picking out a few books he wanted to take with him. Harry knew he was probably doing it on purpose, and it wasn't until Harry snapped that he
Malfoy twirled around on his stool to face Harry, and Harry, who was grinning, froze. His gut clenched and his toes curled at the picture Malfoy made. He had pushed up his goggles, so his hair was a mess, flopping down around the straps and lens. The slightly glowing mixture he had made was properly glowing now, a light purple, and its residue was glowing as well, on both his apron and gloves. There were some darker stains there, Harry knew, but they were hidden by the glow.
The valet waited a respectable amount of time after Nicholas swore loudly, threw the scroll in the fire, and began cursing furniture. "Sir?"
He bounced a little on the balls of his feet, pulling down his sleeves over his hands. He could see his breath, and he squinted up, hoping for more snow.
Eventually, Harry went back up and got some sleep. He woke up with a start and a shout to Dobby just inches from his face. As hardly anyone had gone home for the holiday, his shout woke everyone else in the dorm. Luckily, the Christmas presents at the foot of their beds quickly made them forgive him.
Soon, they were led into the Great Hall and to the champion's table that also held the judges. Finding Percy Weasley substituting for Barty Crouch was a surprise, one that turned slightly unpleasant as Percy ensured Harry sat next to him. Percy greeted him with a swift and pompous, "I've been promoted," and Harry privately resigned himself to a boring meal conversation.
That night, Harry didn't even have to pretend to be exhausted to excuse himself early. Fred and George were already providing a good distraction for him to slip out of the tower unnoticed. He made sure to wear robes again to be able to stash the Cloak and map in the pockets, making a mental note to buy a couple extra if doing this with Malfoy was going to become a regular thing.
Harry was in the shower later, feeling uplifted by flight and victorious having won against an encounter with Malfoy. He always felt victorious when that happened, a warm, bright bubble of
Harry sighed, laying a gentle hand on her shoulder to lead her up the stairs. "No," he said quietly to her. "It's just… It's just, that's isn't something… It could cause problems, is all, if other people heard you saying something like that. About two blokes—about me and Malfoy."
in his chest. And Malfoy just had to give Harry that unguarded look when they surprised him, the look he always gave Harry before he realised he was
No one else was out except for a few stragglers late leaving Herbology. Their path to the bridge was clear, and Harry was quiet as they entered, chewing his lip.
Unexpectedly and seeming out of nowhere, Snape's eyebrows flew up, a look of shocked astonishment on his face. Harry half expected that expression at his words but not a full ten seconds afterwards. Snape looked down quickly, however, and when he looked back, his usual sneer was firmly in place. Although his eyes were just as sharp, if not also calculating.
Harry caught on that they were most likely talking about the ball, and he privately thought Malfoy's assurances were debatable. Then Malfoy smirked over his shoulder at Harry, and Harry knew he heard him come in.
"Oh, we're just going platonically." She stopped and smiled at Harry before continuing to Malfoy. "We're friends now. Harry didn't want the pressure of a partner being anything else, and I'm quite looking forward to the decorations." She turned her dreamy expression back to Harry.  "I do hope they've taken proper precautions against nargles."
It was both a familiar comfort to Harry, to have a consistency somewhere in his life, and also disappointing. He wasn't sure what it was for Malfoy, however. Harry quickly learned that a simple, "I didn't mean it like that; I was complimenting you," shut Malfoy up more effectively than any silencing spell. Only for him to become a little nastier in return.
The lifted dialogue here is from the chapter The Unexpected Task where McGo discusses the ball and Harry's line about girls travelling in packs. That last one is just because I've always thought it was so funny.
His heart was beating wildly as he made his way to this first lesson. A large part of himself was just internally staring blankly at the other parts himself, asking what in the world he thought he was doing. Another part of him was thrilled. His skin felt like it was thrumming, and his stomach was doing flips. And yet another part of him tried to complain about having emotional whip-lash, but honestly, the prospect of secretly meeting Malfoy that night made everything else seem… less miserable.
"Something's dead in there, alright," Malfoy wheezed, using the back of his hand to still cover his nose and mouth—and most likely trying to keep from getting sick himself.
"See-see, the last time, er... " He looked at Malfoy and winced seeing his thoroughly suspicious glare. "The last time, we sort of… flew… out…"
Hermione hummed. "He hasn't really been provoking you, Harry, not lately. Why are you provoking him?"
"Sure, but… are you thinking he was the one who put my name in? Because if he did, he's a really good actor. He seemed furious about it, and he wanted to stop me from competing."
Regardless of what he was or what he liked, there was still someone out there who wanted him dead and was going through great lengths to ensure it.
Harry felt a lump in his throat at the memories, and he curled in on himself, swallowing it down. Knowing them, they wouldn't think him as some victim of corruption but rather proof there was a disease, and that thought hurt more than he thought it should.
For one, Neville had been slowly losing his baby-fat and weight and was rapidly becoming taller to even the rest out. At the rate he was going, Harry could see him being quite fit. For another, Cedric Diggory was really…
That backfired spectacularly as his thoughts when observing Malfoy, while admittedly analytical, weren't entirely logical.
"Therefore, you have no right to decide my comings and goings. Arguably, as the Slytherin between us, I have more of a right to return here than you do. If you don't want to be involved, then don't. Just teach me how to open and close the entrances, and I'll take it from there."
I don't know if it was ever canonically confirmed, but ever since we learned about Legilimency, I always assumed that every time Harry stares down Snape (or at Dumbly) and the other's stare was describe as piercing, x-rayish, or probing, that they were using that on Harry. So, just in case I didn't make that obvious, this is exactly what I meant Snape to have done in Potions.
Professor Moody looked happy and proud of Harry, too, despite his magical eye dancing every which way in its socket. "Nice and easy does the trick, Potter."
He really shouldn't, not so close to the task. Malfoy was indeed correct that he would need at least a few days to prepare, and he couldn't say he had been preparing all that well. Not to mention, tonight was the night he was supposed to meet Sirius somehow.
"It's only a matter of public record. I began this course last year and had an incident in the first lesson. I was injured, you see."
Malfoy looked like he didn't know rather Harry was insane and he should laugh at him, or Harry was insane and he should run for the hills.
Looking very much like the cat who got the canary, he left. Harry heard a soft, "Granger," in passing and after a few second, Hermione was rushing in.
So, I apologise to any anti-Dracos (if you are, Idk why you're reading this, but you are welcomed regardless!), but I personally have always enjoyed the headcanon of a very intelligent Draco Malfoy. In fact, I have my own headcanon that the reason why Draco wasn't a more direct competition to Hermione was that he spent so much time and effort helping his two best friends Crabbe and Goyle. Is that something canon-Malfoy would do? Probably not, I'll admit. But if Crabbe and Goyle are so hopelessly stupid, I never understood how they were able to pass each year and even get OWLs. I just like the idea of a good friend!draco, pulling his friends off to the corner of the common room to explain something for the millionth time and shoving them into classrooms to practise spells. Only to turn around and get dragged by his father for letting a muggleborn do better than him because he was clearly smart enough to match or beat her, thus fueling more hatred toward her. It's not something I know everyone likes or agrees with, hence this note; I felt a need to explain it. I am absolutely not implying it's at all true nor that anyone has to agree with it. I just like it, 'tis all. There's always some element of Draco helping his friends in school in most of my fics. (Especially since I can totally see him being like, "For the love of god, if it will get you to shut up, I'll write your damn essay myself," lol)
However, the more he thought about it, the more he really did believe that Malfoy wouldn't know of any outright plan against Harry. If he did, he would have known Harry didn't put his name in, and Harry would never have brought him down into the Chamber to prove himself.
Harry could have killed himself on the spot. Comparatively, his abnormality was the least of his problems at the moment, but perhaps it had daunted his mind for so long, it apparently took precedence. It was like in the face of having
Harry sighed and scrubbed his sweaty hair from his forehead. His breathing had long since recovered as he laid there brooding, but he was still cooling off from his activity. He hadn't even pulled his pants back up, he realised, which he quickly remedied.
(If I mentioned you by name and you don't want me to, just tell me. And if you want to comment but not be mentioned in the future, just let me know!)
"Why?" Malfoy asked, raising his wand slightly like he was ready to attack. Harry felt like reaching for his own, but he had a small suspicion that if he did that, they would just fall into old habits and really would hex each other. "Why would you, Potter, show
It pulled a real chuckle from Harry, which seemed to surprise Malfoy. Some more of his guard was dropping, and encouraged by it, reminding Harry of his daydreams and the dream the night before, Harry gave him a real smile. "I know. There's another entrance down below you might find more acceptable."
As he climbed into bed, he thought about the night before and how he thought a bit of wanking would do him some good.
Sighing, he went back to his reading, hating himself that he already marked the month his supposed symptoms started, which was over the summer, meaning Potter probably wasn't the one to curse him. He idly wondered if he could still somehow make all of it Potter's fault.
Hermione bit her lip, eyes searching for him but then focusing on the ground. "O-okay, okay. I'm sorry. I was just saying, that's all. I didn't mean—"
Harry let go, feeling lighter and freer than he had in weeks. He grabbed his Firebolt and the golden egg and followed his friends out of the tent.
The skrewts not only did not hibernate but were apparently insulted by the notion. Most of the class almost immediately fled to Hagrid's hut, leaving only a handful to help restrain the angry doofers, Harry, Ron, and Hermione included. Before they captured the last one, a familiar but wholly unwelcomed voice interrupted.
"Five points to Slytherin. Now, anyone who has done the reading will be able to tell me the poison's main characteristic… Brown?"
Ginny introduced them after their last lessons of the term, and she had whispered warnings to him as they walked to their meeting place. Apparently, Luna was bullied quite a lot for being unusual, most often called Loony Lovegood, which immediately made Harry want to come to her defence. Ginny then warned him that the bullying didn't really seem to faze her. She explained what the
Draco snorted disbelieving at her but uncorked the vial. The smell of the potion hit him hard, and his head jerked back. "Blah, gah, no!" he protested, corking it again. "That smells vile, I can't possibly—"
The next day, Harry and Hermione ate breakfast while walking around the lake, and Harry filled her in with everything Sirius told him. Hermione was as concerned as he was about Karkaroff, but she agreed with him that their main focus should be the dragons Tuesday.
He just grinned back at her and shrugged. The crumpled pieces of that particular avoidance bin of his mind felt like the best kind of rebellion.
to please instead of expecting it handed to him. Likewise, Snape always gave Malfoy more of a break—than
This is admittedly a shorter chapter. I tried to make it that the reason for Harry's reactions to things are different from canon (ie, Ron's apology that never actually came in the book) is because of the disaster-gay thing. Which I will be the first to joke about, but in my own coming out, I unintentionally catalogued the people I had, who I thought I would still have if they knew, and randomly telling the people I thought I would lose how much I cared about them. I can testify that people will honestly surprise you, and I wanted our disaster-gay Harry to have that experience.
Lavender giggled, Parvati elbowing her in the ribs although it was clear she wanted to giggle as well. Harry suppressed a groan as they both looked around to him. He tried not to glare as Professor McGonagall ignored them.
If Hagrid was raising illegal blast-ending skrewts, that could potentially spell out big problems. Specifically, since the school of governors already had put Hagrid on trial for the previous year—his
Malfoy had stepped even closer, now only about a foot from Harry. His expression was watchful, observant, but also soft and somehow encouraging. The tone sounded like it was supposed to be teasing, but it didn't actually have any teasing in it.
The following few hours were some of the most surreal, bizarre, and most fun Harry thought he had ever experienced.
Also, a large part of him wanted to wait. See where this went before mucking it up with questions and suspicions.
He smirked wickedly, a warning if there ever was one, but there was something different about it than Harry was used to. The mirth was still there, not cruel but just… happy. Contented and teasing. Harry's stretched-thin imagination had conjured something similar for Harry, but apparently his imagination truly was limited because… it was
She froze and narrowed her eyes. Harry looked around and was surprised but hopeful when he saw Malfoy was quite alone.
Dobby looked a million times better than he did when under the Malfoys. It gave Harry a twisted, cool pleasure to know that he was responsible for freeing Dobby from Mr Malfoy, as well as being responsible for luring Mr Malfoy's son into the depth of the Chamber Mr Malfoy had tried to use to sack Dumbledore and kill Ginny. Arguably, his real goal was sacking Dumbledore and ruining the Weasleys good name and reputation, but with something as dark as Riddle's diary, he had to have known death was likely and thought it an acceptable risk.
His hair even seemed to relax when he was like this. Harry watched as some of it fell over an eye, and Malfoy simply flicked it away instead of mindfully brushing it back in its place. Harry couldn't say his shoulders were less tensed, but they were tense with perhaps excitement more than anything else. His hip cocked out as he pointed at something, and Harry wondered if he was wearing a belt. What that movement would do if he wasn't wearing a belt and his trousers were just a little big for him.
Except he really couldn't. He could acknowledge the fact of it, but he couldn't even say the two words in his head.
"What?" Malfoy said again, snapping his head to Harry. Although it was hard to see his facial expression in such little lighting, his tone was clearly incredulous.
They had worked later than they usually did, and even their parting words whispered quietly in the wee hours were said with much lighter intent than they ever exchanged. Malfoy promised to let Harry know if he thought of any others and even offered to review his work for Divinations for now on. Harry, wanting to hold onto that night, agreed.
He paused again, examining where they could go one of three ways. He tried to think back, going over his memories again.
"Not Hogwarts," Harry corrected, "just the staff." He thought of Snape. "And maybe not even all of them."
Malfoy seemed to not have expected that, looking surprised, then his expression soured. "Defending your girlfriend, already? You must have it bad."
Harry cut him off by leaping into his arms. He still wasn't tall enough to reach Hagrid's neck when he did this, but Hagrid scooped him up nonetheless.
"He—" Harry stopped himself. Did that mean Malfoy didn't know about Pettigrew? Would it mean anything to tell him? Did his father know about Pettigrew? Malfoy would most definitely tell him if he didn't. And if Lucius
"It means that if you don't know who exactly was behind opening the Chamber and who exactly it was that helped him do it, I honestly don't think I should—nor would you want me to be—the one to tell you."
"Right, this way." Malfoy's footsteps echoed very quietly as he steadily followed, not interrupting. "Anyway, Lockhart had apparently been bragging all year that he always knew where the entrance was, what the monster was, all that tosh. We didn't realise it until later, but when the other professors told him now was his time to shine and go take care of the monster, they were actually just getting rid of him. We didn't realise that though. So, we ran to Lockhart to tell him what we knew, and we found him packing. He was going to run."
don't want to think of what kind of… residue was on the thing. Especially since I fell in that water."
"Oh good," Ginny greeted them. "Um. I was just showing Luna the waltz everyone else will be doing tonight."
"They'll figure it out," Luna assured, and Harry and she made their way out of the Great Hall, through the quiet entrance hall, and outside to a winter wonderland.
Sirius kept urging him to be watchful. To be good, out of the way, but watchful, and to report back anything unusual.
When Dobby declared that the store must have made a mistake as the socks were the same, Ron gifted him with a pair of his own that he had just unwrapped so Dobby could mix them. Harry didn't know why Ron had taken such a liking to Dobby, but he approved.
"Sh!" Harry looked around, but no one seemed to have heard. "Yeah, okay," he whispered now. "Just.. please be careful. I really,
It was odd having the whole school (and then some) present for the holiday feast, but Harry had fun nonetheless. He enjoyed himself watching the others who never attended before.
Fine. Alright." He huffed and turned to survey the basilisk again. "I suppose this isn't a total loss. Basilisks are known to decompose more slowly than most animals, and the bones will be fine. I'll have to do some research, but most of her should be salvageable."
He put on the Cloak in the dorms, and they began the trek to the grounds. They were on the first floor close to the marble staircase when a soft, "Granger!" was called out, and Malfoy took a spot beside her.
Nicholas never confirmed exactly what that informant had told him, and mostly, those who worked for the family assumed the child's mother was a half-blood. When Nicholas died and Aarav came back to take over the family, they all politely looked the other way, and it was never spoken of again. Before he died, though, Nicholas Malfoy penned a missive to whoever would be the Master of the Manor seven to nine generations from then to warn that a creature would present in the family. Years later, the Manor would be set on fire during a riot in one of the goblin wars, and the hidden missive would burn.
, not with his confession and quite literally living in a dorm with other boys. She was strict— fair, but strict—and oh god, what if she made him move? He doubted she would move him in with the girls, but what if he had to dorm by himself—everyone would figure out why, and—
He looked back around to Malfoy, who was leaning back in his chair, reading a large tome and brushing the feather of his quill across his lips in thought. Harry swallowed, hunching back over his own book.
The Malfoy-Potions face wasn't something he let himself look at often because when his face was like that— eyebrows furrowed but not pinched, eyes narrowed critically but alit with accepting focus, lips pursed thoughtfully around his words that were smooth rather than sharp, hands relaxed with fingers twitching with his thoughts…
Like being small and desperately wanting Aunt Petunia's affection, so when he heard her shriek of a vile, disgusting thing such as homosexuality displayed in one of Dudley's programmes, he vowed to hold such an issue to her estimate. Or Uncle Vernon raging about new discrimination laws and how no one should have to be subjected to such filth as pillow biters in the workplace. Or Dudley casually mentioning a schoolmate had two moms, and Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon's uproar of how sinful and unnatural it was, how those kinds of foul excuses for people shouldn't be allowed children. That they infected young, innocent children's minds and corrupted them.
Malfoy took another step toward Harry, still looking around so easily, Harry assumed he didn't realise he was doing it.
The majority of the school signed up to stay over the hols, and as they got steadily closer, the Yule Ball was all anybody talked about. A few brave girls approached Harry to ask him to it, and he was so taken off guard each time that he said no and bolted before he could catch up with his own thoughts. It was stupid, he could say yes to any of them and have the matter be solved. It was just... they smiled at him, blushing with hopeful batting eyes, and Harry just couldn't do it.
"Tonight," Harry decided. "After curfew. Meet me where the heir let his messages in our second year."
"Anyway, when Ginny was taken, we had figured out where the entrance was, what the monster was, all of that. Ron and I actually went to tell the professors what we knew when the alert was sounded, so we hid in the staff room, wanting to find out what had happened. That's how we learned about Ginny. Lockhart was here, I'm sure you remember him…"
Harry received several other gifts, from sweets to Mrs Weasley's annual sweater. His favourite was from Sirius which was a pocket knife that could unlock any lock. As he played with it and practised, he realised that with this, the Cloak, and his map, he had the starting package to become a master thief.
The tone and words squashed some of the exciting, and nervous, feeling in Harry. Harry sighed, feeling tired now. "No, Malfoy. Luna is a genuinely nice person— and a Ravenclaw, I might add."
Malfoy's jaw dropped fully then, eyes widened, and satisfied, Harry spun on heels and marched back to the castle. He didn't look back, but it was a close thing.
"Malfoy," he nodded to the spot he knew Malfoy was secreted and pushed his way into the loo. Malfoy followed right as Harry was opening the sink.
The actual letter was the one from Sirius. He hadn't heard from him since the congratulations on the Horntail (the miniature of which Harry still couldn't find). The elation of the victory, the praise, and the accidental coming-out had been whittling away. The ball and his coming-out to Hermione distracted him, but with that settled, the dangers of this year were making themselves known again.
How in the world could he even consider taking a bloke to the ball when he couldn't even entertain the thought of telling his friends that he was...
"Here," Harry said, pushing the whatever he was slicing toward Ron and pretending to lean over his book.
Harry felt triumphant. Here, right in front of Malfoy, was irrefutable proof that Harry hadn't been lying. Here was the prove that Harry, at only twelve, had gone against Voldemort's memory and a basilisk and
"Excellent," Malfoy practically purred. "Get your notes ready, Potter, I'm about to supply you with everything you'll need for the rest of your Divinations educational needs."
"Professor Hagrid brought me immediately to the school's medical wing, and my father ensured that a thorough investigation happened."
Harry snorted, but it really did sound more or less like Malfoy was implying Malfoy was lucky to have his godfather. "Well, mine figured out how to break out of Azkaban."
Eventually, Malfoy moved to his dorm room then reemerged a moment later. He strolled purposely out of the common room, seemingly unstopped by everyone else in there, and Harry couldn't stop a grin as he watched Malfoy expertly yet cautiously make his way to where Harry was.
Harry felt eyes on him, and he looked over to see Malfoy had turned back as well but was peeking over his shoulder at him, watching. Harry tried to give him a slow nod. After all, Harry just did that for the bastard—and he bloody better well know it.
It seemed to be. Malfoy sat straighter at having gotten the question correct, but Snape didn't add that last question to the board like he did all the others. Harry chewed his lip, squinting at Malfoy and wishing he could read his mind so that there wouldn't be anything Malfoy-related that he was ignorant about.
They stayed like that for a while, in silence and just embracing. Then they slowly continued their way across the bridge as Harry told her about accidentally blurting it to Professor McGonagall, to which Hermione gasped, and all about what she said when he tried to backpedal the next day, to which Hermione laughed merrily at him, and even the conversation about the Yule Ball. By the time he had finished, they had reached the end of the bridge and found a comfortable spot on a small boulder to look out on the castle.
Harry's jaw dropped then, and whispers swept through the room, Parvati almost unseating herself to reach Lavender. Snape lingered just a moment, and Harry got the impression that the point awarded to him had nothing to do with Potions.
"Need a tissue, Potter," Malfoy drawled. He was close enough now for Harry to see properly, and as he got closer still, the sun was blocked completely, giving Harry a perfect view. "Weeping over mummy and daddy already today? Bit early, isn't it?"
"I'm not sure whether they hibernate or not. Thought we'd jus' try an' see if they fancied a kip… We'll jus' settle 'em down in these boxes…"
He trailed off as they got to a large pile of rubble and what was left of the basilisk skin. Harry knew what it was immediately, but it took Malfoy a moment to suck in a huge breath.
Merlin, that was satisfying. Just satisfying enough to get his wits about him; he straightened, turned off the faucet, and casually picked up a cloth to dry his hands. He peeked over his shoulder, but the only person who seemed to have seen was bloody Potter, and like Potter wasn't philistine enough to drink from a sink anyway.
Malfoy appeared to be thinking something similar because he cleared his throat loudly and said tightly. "I suppose I shouldn't... It's not…"
Whoever they were snorted hatefully at him, but Draco continued on his way, depositing the vials to be graded. He scooted down to the corner, turned his back to the room, and snuck out his travel goblet from his robe's pocket. He felt dismayed when he looked down at it—it was empty. That was right, he drained it when he went to one of the ingredient cupboards—
Harry snorted. "I doubt you want to know the state I was in when we left. I have a feeling it would horrify you." He looked Malfoy up and down again. He honestly wouldn't have thought Malfoy would have had so many outfits appropriate for a place like this.
What Malfoy would do with that information, Harry couldn't guess, but Harry's brain was apparently on a campaign to cause Harry great anguish because it unhelpfully supplied an image of what Malfoy could do to apologise for not believing Harry. After all, in the Chamber of Secrets, they would be alone without any chance of being interrupted. And why did his brain
Harry began tuning out the lesson, simply writing down the answers as students gave them and they appeared on the board. He only really gave his attention when Malfoy was called on to answer.
Ron slunk back, clearly miserable, then attempted to wrangle Ginny who announced she was going with Neville. She went to leave to grab some supper, but Harry followed her, stopping her outside the portrait hole.
He pulled Vinny's essay over when he saw him copying from a wrong page, spelling the paragraph away and pointing him to the right passage. Draco began shaking his leg, watching and nodding in approval as Vinny dutifully began copying.
transfigures a target, which could be anything, instead of a transfiguration of one specific thing into another specific thing." He flipped a few pages back, making sure Greg was listening too. "Read through this again where it explains how this is possible by a basic understanding of your objective and recalling the facts of the rabbit you'll change it into."
Harry, equal parts confused as curious, met eyes with Malfoy. Malfoy did a face as he followed his Slytherins, but Harry couldn't decipher it.
"Mr Potter?" Professor McGonagall charged through the door, fully dressed and face serious. She looked around the empty room before focusing on Harry.
"I really don't care that much about this bloody creature," Harry whined. "It already tried to kill me once, please stop trying to finish its job by going on about its digestive system…"
They were approaching the last week of term, and therefore, several exams. Between the ball and studying, Harry was relieved to find another cleverly hidden note in his Astronomy text requesting a night of basilisk harvesting.
Harry meant it when he said he thought Malfoy might have been the only person to really know him, but he had to admit, he assumed Malfoy knew him so well because Malfoy was just so good at pushing his buttons. Malfoy always knew exactly what to say or do to push Harry over the edge.
Luna followed but was silent now. As they entered the entrance hall, that still had several students and watchful professors, Luna asked, "Did I upset you?"
"Including a bloody arm…" Malfoy said quietly but tightly. "You do realise, Potter, that if her fang went through your arm, you would be dead."
"You expect me to believe that not only did you slay Slytherin's monster with a Gryffindor sword, but you did so inside the Chamber of Secrets whose entrance is in a girls' toilet."
this. That it was merely a concentrated effort of evil to corner Harry into humiliation and outcast him from everyone he loved. If not for the bloke thing then the whole Malfoy of it all.
Harry laughed. "Yeah, not literally, don't worry, Krum." He offered Luna his arm again, settling in to wait. He forced his face to turn serious as he added, "But I'm watching you."
The Saturday before the first task was a Hogsmeade weekend. Hermione convinced him to go, but it honestly didn't take much. She tried to arrange it so they would meet up with Ron at the Three Broomsticks, but he likewise was able to easily convince her that if they went, they wouldn't meet Ron and he got to wear his Invisibility Cloak.
He was a fool, probably, but he went to sleep deciding maybe he was ready to talk to someone. Not about Malfoy, but he could talk about himself.
The Drumstang ran drills in the afternoon. Harry assumed that they wore much thicker clothing wherever their school was, but here, even at the start of December, it was warm enough for them to dress down in sleeveless shirts and sometimes shorts. Some of the drills were obvious duelling styles and positions, contorting their bodies this way and that.
He felt awkward next. He wrung his hands a little, looking anywhere but Malfoy. He felt like some neutral ground has been building between them, however tentative, and now he had just dropped a bomb on it. It was odd—he used to always associate Snape and Malfoy with the same degree of animosity, but with Malfoy creeping into his thoughts and dreams, the scales outweighed each other. Harry, against his better judgment, was giving Malfoy a chance, he supposed. It was mostly selfish, wanting to prove himself to Malfoy and wanting to figure out why it was him to have caught Harry's attention.
—why he couldn't be normal, why Malfoy was getting his attention and popping into his mind, why he didn't seem able to stop. And this was somewhat safe, wasn't it? He knew Malfoy well enough to know he would guard the Chamber of Secrets as his own secret, as something special only he knew about. Sure, there might be rumours now, but they wouldn't be the rumours Harry was already suffering, and if Malfoy was going around hinting and bragging about his special Slytherin secret, it would take some heat off Harry. Meanwhile, while they were down there, Harry could, possibly, have an opportunity to figure out what the bloody hell was wrong with him.
"'Sometimes at night I still cry about them, I'm not ashamed to admit…'" Harry read dumbly. Then abruptly, "I NEVER SAID ANYTHING LIKE THIS!"
It wasn't until later that they learned what veela did, and he could have kicked himself. He had nodded along, agreeing with the other boys as they described the feeling while inescapable hopelessness settling into him.
Most of the time, he would get distracted by the image. Where would he put his hands? Was he allowed to touch
Hermione laughed though it sounded slightly tearful. "Oh, Harry! I'm so glad you're okay." She pushed away from him and grabbed his arm, inspecting his shoulder.
When the first song was over, Harry was tempted to go sit down. He looked around to spot Ron, who was sitting alone with Padma, neither of whom looked happy. Another sweep around the room, and Harry spotted a sulky-looking Seamus sitting alone in a corner.
He resolutely decided he was the idiot Malfoy always claimed him to be, and he thought maybe, perhaps, he needed to take a break from wanking altogether.
Malfoy gave him a sharp look. "That's a bad idea on so many levels, Potter, the least of which is by doing so we would be alerting
Ron was talking fast as he led the way to the enclosure, telling Harry about the other champions. Cedric had attempted to distract the dragon by Transfiguring a rock into a dog. Fleur tried to dissuade her dragon by attempting a trance. Krum shot some spell directly into his dragon's eyes, which would have worked best if the dragon didn't stumble in agony and smash half her eggs. Harry hadn't exactly thought Malfoy was lying or being deceptive in his advice, but having such clear confirmation of Malfoy's honesty—honesty to
Malfoy led the way to the sink, obviously more comfortable than before. Harry couldn't help but wonder if he tried imitating Parselmouth to open it. He wouldn't put it past the git. He also noticed that Malfoy was in much more casual robes. In fact, knowing Malfoy's usual outfits as he did, Harry was pretty sure those were the most worn he probably own, making them the perfect ones to go sliding downpipes in.
Not for the first time since his and Malfoy's last trip to the Chamber, Harry wondered about the relationship between him and the professor. Harry watched as Malfoy was asked a follow-up question, something he often did for Slytherins when they had forgotten or left out part of the answer. Harry never had Potions with any of the other houses, but he assumed it was a favoured chance he didn't grant anyone else.
Finally, after an hour of getting distracted and physically shaking his head to dislodge the thoughts, Malfoy began to notice. He mocked Harry for having fleas, to which Harry defended that he was just trying not to fall asleep.
"Shovel talk, really, Harry?" Hermione giggled. She then said to Krum, "It's a Muggle saying. It's something protective family members do, like 'if you hurt my sister, I'll hurt you' kind of thing."
"Wish I knew!" Harry yelled. "Wouldn't be the first time someone tried to kill me, though, but it is the most creative, I'll give them that.
Harry shrugged, unable to stop his grin. He could tell Malfoy about almost being sorted Slytherin, but he figured he would save that for a time he actually could see his face. That was if he would ever tell him. "Anyway, here's where we stopped. The skin was still formed, see? Lockhart took the distraction to grab Ron's wand. He thought he had it all planned out too. He was going to curse us, go back up and maybe try to lead the professors this far or something, claim that he was too late to save us. Thing was, you remember how broken Ron's wand was all that year?"
Harry looked behind him, and Luna was sitting on the edge of the fountain, apparently describing something to the swan, using her hands to mimic whatever it was.
Snape trusted his class enough to begin their potions to sit at his desk and go through what Harry guessed were essays, but unlike usual, he kept getting up to do circuits around the room. This, of course, made them all more nervous, but from what Harry could tell from Neville's whispers to Hermione, the more he did this, the more frightened Neville was getting about the dangerous potion in general.
magic. Or, feel it differently, and so much more intensely. Whatever her spell told her, her eyebrows shot up. "You are very dehydrated indeed, Mr Malfoy. The fever is a bit high, but not worrisome currently."
Harry had to return to the champion's tent for details of the second task. He was beyond grateful that he had months to prepare. The end of February felt like a lifetime away.
"Very good," Professor Snape praised, and Draco jumped, not realising he had come to stand in front of them. It would seem while Draco was trying to focus on
Somewhere in there, while Harry, all those weeks ago, thought of this and showered, he realised he had started stroking himself. Realising that switched the images up almost immediately, where Harry was still pushing up against Malfoy, but he wasn't using his mouth to yell at the git.
Harry felt affection for her roll through him. She knew. He knew she knew. Hell, she probably had known, but here she was, carefully pretending to not know. He shook his head, feeling oddly comforted by this. And by the information. She bluntly said it wouldn't change how she felt about him, and he was so incredibly grateful.
"Months might not be enough," Harry parroted Hermione's usual warning right as she opened her mouth. "And no, not the egg. I've just been…" he shrugged, turning to continue up the stairs and resolutely not looking toward the lake, "you know."
Harry now patted Ron's arm as they tried to comfort him, but he caught Hermione's eye over his head and mouthed, "
When before Harry couldn't take a step without noticing the boys, suddenly the castle seemed to be filled with nothing but girls. Giggling, whispering, blushing girls who, unfortunately, were noticing Harry right back.
Draco leaned over to look at the section to which Vinny had pointed. He read the section, understanding it clearly, then re-read it through a Vinny-and-Greg lens.
Harry had no idea what to think of that or where to put it in his mind. Panic flared in him, and he held out a hand to stop Luna. "We're not… Luna, we're not…
"Worse. The Memory Charm backfired awfully. He went flying back, causing the cave-in," he gestured around the rubble. "It left him and Ron on one side, me on the other. Ron stayed with Lockhart and began working to make that hole there. I went on."
Malfoy was still sputtering, rubbing at his cheeks and mouth, and Harry patiently waited for him to finish. When he did, he gave Harry an impatient look and gestured at him as though
It twisted something ugly in his stomach thinking about being in her shoes. He had been questioned by Ron a few times why he insisted on taking Luna Lovegood under the strict rule of
They both nodded to him and began writing more on their essay. Draco watched them fondly a moment. Transfiguration was their absolute worst subject.
Later that night as he climbed into bed, he pulled out the miniature Horntail to lay on his bedside table. It yawned hugely and curled up, closing its eyes.
Harry tried very hard not to laugh at him. His robes were terrible and clashed badly with his hair. Ron was able to use a severing charm to at least get off all the lace, but it left the seams uneven and a little matted. Still, no lace at least.
he was feeling this way. And he always did feel a little bit safer, a bit braver underneath his father's Cloak, after all.
"Not even Gryffindors can be brave enough to face certain truths about themselves. Facing yourself is far more difficult than anything you will face today. I want you to know that self-discovery and identity is a
The worst of it, or so it felt when it happened, was that Malfoy had apparently ruined wanking for Harry. Because no matter what Harry tried, if Harry actually got in the groove of it and started enjoying himself,
They had reached the middle of the bridge, and Hermione leaned against the side, biting her lip. "Well… to be perfectly honest, Harry, I wasn't sure how people would take it."
Skeeter looked incredibly pleased, her green Quick-Quote Quill and parchment zooming out of her handbag.
A horrible smell hit them, causing both of them to gag and stumble back, using their own arms to fully cover their mouths and noses. The stench was so strong, Harry's eyes watered. He was helpless but to cough, trying very hard not to get sick, and suddenly, Malfoy was yelling something muffled by his arm, and the smell was gone.
He picked up one of the buttons, sighing. He had gotten used to seeing them around the school, and so wasn't as bothered by them like he originally was. He hated that he wished they simply just said
Harry found himself pleased when Malfoy was already waiting for him. He snuck behind the same suit of armour to hide his things then slipped out, causing Malfoy to once again jump.
"That was fun, I guess," Harry said when the song was over. He applauded with everyone else as the Weird Sisters started their third song. "I like the faster beats."
many more things he had to think of. He could be lying there brooding over the Triwizard Tournament, over the fact that Ron was still not talking to him, about how the whole school hated him again—except for Gryffindor House who rather thought he did a bloody good showing getting himself into the tournament—lamenting over unfinished homework, fretting over where Sirius was and if he was safe, or even that apparently, once again, someone wanted him dead.
he spewed it—sunk in, and he let his head fall, humiliated and exhausted, and now terrified of how this was going to be used against him. He immediately tried to think of damage control, maybe threaten hexes or something, but he didn't think he entirely had it in him.
"Fine. Good." Malfoy grabbed one of the books, pulling it to him. Harry shot a hand out and snatched it back. "You have always been a terrible procrastinator, you know, Potter."
I would like to thank everyone who complimented my Luna! It did give me the courage to include her the way I wanted. For the record, I'm not just having her to be weird just to be weird. I have a tentative plan with her and will explain the ice sculpture thing. (Which, I thought was a thing, but in looking at the book again, it was just stone statues. Oh well. Here be ice sculptures. Also, I forgot there was a point in which Malfoy and Parkinson were described with their outfits, so yeah, those are different as well. Mine are better. It's because we're queer.)
Malfoy narrowed his eyes, and Harry fought hard to keep his expression. He knew what Malfoy was talking about, of course, but he always did enjoy having one up on Malfoy.
Harry grinned to himself, jumping instead of answering. His landing still wasn't very smooth, and he was annoyed the Malfoy's landing was looking to already become practised.
It was a tremendous relief to have told Hermione, even more so because she so readily accepted him. He also felt much better about the ball with Hermione's idea.
"But clearly that won't happen," Malfoy said, sounding very annoyed. "Because I promised eternal damnation to you if you die before I can finish my work here."
Malfoy's head dropped again, shoulder shaking once more. Harry bit down a smile as he watched Malfoy re-compose himself. "Right." He cleared his throat, smoothing down the front of his robes."Right, well," he turned back to Harry, and Harry's heart beat a little faster seeing the ghost of a genuine smile on Malfoy's face, humour twinkling at the edges of his eyes. "Well, we obviously aren't going to do that."
He glowered upward, firmly telling himself that he was an absolute idiot and tosser because there were
One thing Harry knew for sure, however, was that there was no way he could take a bloke to the ball.
Back at Gryffindor tower, Harry pulled off the Cloak and stood frozen in the middle of the common room. The non-dragon fire in the fireplace was the only source of light, other than the
year of teaching—for bringing dangerous animals to lessons. Mind, Harry wouldn't think it a bad thing if the Ministry executed the skrewts, but he doubted Hagrid's career would last another trial so quickly.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione tried to stay to prevent Skeeter from locking Hagrid down to an interview, but Hagrid waved them along. They went dejectedly.
He scratched at his itchy arm, watching as small flecks of skin danced off him and floated to the floor.
at least would know it was real, even if he didn't know about his father's part in it. If Harry was spreading attention-seeking rumours, he wouldn't have gone with
Nicholas had been assuming it was a half-blood, most likely having fooled his son Aarav into thinking she was pure. At worst—at the very worst that he could barely conceive the idea—a Mudblood. He had shivered and quickly dismissed the thought that the mother of his grandson could be a
Goosegrass was probably one of Harry's favourite smells—if it was normal to have favourite smells, of course—because it was like a mixture of something earthy and sweet.
relationships, do you ever think… I don't know. I mean, it isn't normal, right? To think about… Or it's wrong, to
Malfoy sighed, but he did sound a little pleased. "Of course not. I'm sorry to cut this short, but we are on limited time, I'm afraid."
Then there was the third, which was Malfoy would show up, humour Harry until Harry showed him the dead basilisk, and then Malfoy would believe him. He would believe Harry hadn't been an attention-seeking lying-liar all these years. He would believe that Harry did
Hermione sighed, too, adjusting her head to lay it on Harry's shoulder and look out across the deep valley there. "I know."
He gulped, casting his conscious mind to the right path as best he remembered it, firmly telling himself that the danger was
As Snape swept back up to the front, calling for an immediate return to their work, Ron's hand latched onto his arm.
Ron grinned back, looking dumbfounded, and turned back to their cauldron only to let out a groan. "Zero marks again…"
Luna hummed. "He does take being pureblood as a responsibility. I imagine even if he didn't want to react, his parents would ask him to."
They set their drinks down, giving their goodbyes to Bagman. Harry tried to see if he could find Hermione to let them know they didn't have their drinks anymore, but Hermione was looking properly cheered now and was smiling brightly with eyes only for Krum.
Harry peeked up, and he found he couldn't regret his words. Not when they were causing Malfoy to look down as well, shifteing where he stood. His face was flushed, and a strand of his soft-looking hair really was falling in his eyes.
He had the sinking feeling that everything was coming to a head. That morning he could delude himself that he still had time, but now the pressure was making it hard for his lungs. He was worried what Sirius was going to say, let alone what he thought about everything, and he was worried exactly what Hagrid would deem so important. And he was still terrified of the first task, he seemed to have a mental block in all his subjects, Ron was still being a right git…
"No," Malfoy agreed, and Harry could just make out his smirk. "But—as I do all my own work, thank you very much—I'm actually quite ahead in that class. I've been practising the Vanishing Charm all week."
They were well into the bridge at this point, and Harry hung his head, picking at the boards with the toe of his shoe. He shoved his hands in his pockets self-consciously, feeling his shoulder tense. Steeling himself, he repeated more clearly, "People who don't like the gender they're supposed to like."
to go that Malfoy relented. True to his promise the time before, Harry made sure he was in front on their up the narrow spiral staircase.
Hermione nodded sadly, tucking her arm around his. "I understand. I can only imagine what that Skeeter devil would say."
Harry opened the entrance without further ado and threw his bag in before jumping after it. He brought with him some of his easier homework and revisions, loathed to give Malfoy an opportunity to see him struggle with his studies.
She grinned and nodded, saying an enthusiastic goodbye to the sculpture and wishing it a happy melting. Harry cast a warming charm on her when she reached him, it only now occurring to Harry how cold it was and that Luna didn't have a coat.
Why did they have to throw books down—surely Madam Pince would put a stop to that—and whatever happened to the art of walking quietly, or not dripping ink on parchment so that it sounded like it was pouring rain, and—
"I like grapefruit," Malfoy interrupted. The more Harry babbled, the softer Malfoy's expression had become, thus enabling the babbling. Malfoy's lips seemed to be fighting a smile, too, and Harry tried very hard not to look at them fully, jerking his eyes back up when he noticed them falling.
This made Hermione chuckle a bit more normally then the giggle she did earlier. "You both look great as well. You ready to dance in front of everyone?"
"My…?" Harry threw out his hands, the dragon book he had begun to clutch flying out of his pocket. "I don't have one! For anything! Damn you, Malfoy, you can't accuse me of being a hopeless moron only to turn around and accuse me of some kind of scheme here!"
Malfoy gave him a small, shy-looking smile. "On some things. I'm afraid I'm grossly behind on technology."
"We don't know, that's why we're asking," Hermione said, stepping up beside him as they entered the castle.
was getting to Professor McGonagall, figuring out exactly what she remembered, knew, and what she planned to do.
Guessing this had something to do with the sword fighting, he shot Ron a half-hearted glare and shuffled up to her desk. The professor waited until everyone had gone and the door was shut before facing him. She peered at him sharply, assessing.
He stared her down. His heart thundered in fear of what the ever-living-hell she would print if she knew half the thoughts in his head—which were
Blaise raised an eyebrow and turned a big spoon over in his hand to show Draco a distorted reflection. Draco was indeed very pale.
Harry wiped the map blank, chucked it, and shoved his head under his pillow. He made himself review his current History of Magic essay, the most boring thing he could think of until he eventually fell into an uneasy sleep.
Malfoy blinked, obviously surprised, but Harry slipped in, tearing off his Cloak and hiding it in a corner, and stood with his arms crossed and a scowl on his face.
"I'm in a hurry," Harry answered honestly. "Listen, I, I agreed to meet with someone at midnight, and I already had plans at one, and—" Malfoy's eyebrows shot up, and Harry realised what that might could have sounded like. "Wait! Wait, no, not—not like
As they prepared for their Care of Magical Creatures class, however, his liking to the woman brought with it single-malt whiskey fumes from where Hagrid kept her magical horses. Which was not ideal as they were still tending to the, probably highly illegal, blast-ended skrewts.
Some of the Slytherins hissed, but Harry only had eyes for Malfoy. He watched as an actual, genuine grin spread on Malfoy's face, and he himself just grinned wider as Malfoy visibly pulled back his own and forced his face into a scowl. "Breathe the fresh air while you're still alive, Potter. We'll see what comes in the second task."
people at first. Mostly just him closing his eyes and pretending his hands were someone else's. He wasn't entirely sure when it was that the shapeless no ones formed boy-shapes, but it wasn't something he thought about until after it was over.
, really handsome. His jaw and cheekbones could probably cut glass, and his eyes were so bright—and unguarded, unlike some people he could name.
Another breath and Harry turned the corner. Malfoy was there, leaning against the wall but only a few paces from shadows that could easily hide him. Harry wondered why he was out in the open.
It was a weird dance, but Harry didn't expect anything else. Harry was slightly embarrassed, but when they passed Fred and Angelina, who were dancing so aggressively and wildly people were giving them a wide berth, he decided it could be worse.
Malfoy considered him for a long time. "Fine, but I reserve the right to leave at any point, and if you do
Because that was what Malfoy did to Harry—always somehow burrowing into him, making him react before thought had time to catch up.
He slowly blinked up to meet Malfoy's gaze. As he did so, an image from the night before—an unguarded Malfoy underneath a messy mop of white-blond hair—flashed across his vision, and it stung. It really did.
"Erm," he cleared his throat, gently taking his hand back. "Thanks, but no thanks. I have my own. Well, boys?" Draco addressed Vinny and Greg who were still frowning at their textbooks. "That should be good enough for tonight, yeah?"
Luna was absolutely an oddity, Harry could tell. She had an aura about her that was almost ethereal, not to mention the tiny broccolis that were serving as earrings and her piercing stare at Harry that was almost unblinking. Harry, however, knew he couldn't be choosy, and he was confident there wouldn't be any misreadings between them. Well, not in any romantic sense. He figured he was going to be misreading her often, but it was good enough for him.
Malfoy was still in the Slytherin commons when Harry arrived outside Moaning Myrtle's toilet. Harry supposed if Malfoy was not going to show up, Harry could eventually tell via the map. He would just go back to his commons and forget the whole thing.
It emptied out on the ground floor near the entrance hall, which surprised Harry. Malfoy, however, looked like he expected nothing less.
"Right then, this way." Harry began to lead them again. He also began noticing a bad stench getting stronger.
They were quiet the rest of the way to what Harry considered the second entrance. Malfoy finally lit his own wand to examine the snake and ruby eyes. Harry stood back and let him study it until Malfoy was satisfied then hissed to open it.
And yes, on top of getting a reading for Harry's developing feelings and their sincerity, I totally picture him also getting uh… more than an eye-full, lol. No, nothing pervy or explicit. But hey, accidentally stumbling on what people get up to in private is the hefty price you pay for reading their mind without consent.
"The first task," Malfoy said slowly, looking back up at him with his eyebrows high on his forehead. "Merlin, Potter… I'm assuming you'll at
Luna began engaging the swan, allowing pauses wherein the swan presumably provided replies. Harry slowly backed away, deciding to give her and the sculpture a little more privacy.
Harry gulped. "Okay," he said, standing and letting his fork slip out of his hand. It landed on his plate of uneaten food with a loud
So, if Malfoy did know anything, he wouldn't know its significance. Harry was fairly confident about that. But getting Malfoy to tell him anything he might know?
Even Professor Trelawney's usual prediction of his death didn't faze him, and he couldn't really find it in himself to care when Hagrid reported that Skeeter only wanted to talk about Harry during their interview. It was obvious she was currently looking for a new angle on Harry, as playing up the tragic hero would soon become boring.
Harry was mildly curious but shrugged. If she could give Harry the chance to not say anything about himself, he could do the same. "Fine. Who for me then?"
Malfoy didn't entirely sound like he believed him, and that stung in and of itself that Malfoy could actually believe Harry had said anything like that. Just like it stung that Ron would actually believe Harry put his name in the Goblet.
This dance Luna led him through involved a lot of slow-motion twirls done on the tips of their toes. Harry tripped many times, but Luna insisted it improved the dance and began 'tripping' as well. The next dance didn't involve any touching or rotation, just more or less them facing each other and hopping from foot to foot. Luna suggested the best way to perform it was to pretend his feet were on fire. Harry had to admit, imagining that did help him hop more quickly.
Harry didn't know about partners, but if they were making a pack to just grit their teeth and do it, Harry would.
mean that we will be relaxing the standards of behaviour we expect from Hogwarts students. I will be most seriously displeased if a Gryffindor student embarrasses the school in any way."
It probably wasn't the brightest idea. It would probably backfire on him in ways he couldn't begin to fathom. Malfoy would probably find a way to use this to make Harry's life more miserable.
Anyway, long-winded here, but in this fic, I picture Draco being so upset with Harry's comment not because he isn't a cheat (we all know what he's like in Quidditch) but because academia is a particular sore spot for him. I'm going off canon that the only classes they have together is Potions, that flying class first year, and COMC third year and up. I don't think they were in more classes together, but if they were, please point them out! Otherwise, Harry doesn't really know how Malfoy is in class because his only real two experiences are Potions, where Snape is biased, and COMC, where Malfoy just mocks the whole time.
This time, Malfoy led the way. Harry could see his face now, and his lips were parted and eyes huge—and unguarded—as he sent his
Malfoy's hard eyes examined Harry's face for several long moments, and Harry wanted to punch him. He felt more determined now more than ever to
Harry had taken qualities of himself that scared him, worried him, concerned him, and he used them not just for the greater good but to save his best friend's sister.
Harry had no idea what nargles were much like he didn't know about Gristling Waterbats, but like before, he went with it. If nothing else than to rub his newfound friend in Malfoy's face.
So, that was sorted. However, Harry's spirits fell when Malfoy openly mocked him in the entrance hall after the meal.
"As you can see, Professor Hagrid still has his job as he did nothing wrong. But I'm afraid the entire incident and my family's subsequent actions have made new magical creatures added the curriculum to be under
But then there's were the utterly ridiculous: death by over-confidence; death by caviar; death by politeness and rudeness; death by trying to grow a beard; death by knife-wielding birds; death by Muggle packaging tape; even death by being trapped in a closet, which had Harry unexpectedly throwing his head back and bursting in loud laughter that startled Malfoy. He gaped at Harry while Harry tried to calm down, for once highly amused by the irony, and when he composed himself he grinned up at Malfoy.
Harry didn't know what his expression was, but it was enough to soften her features and sound less formidable.
He circled that one and noted they went away around the time he began what he privately called his "drinking problem", mildly thinking of his mother with elf-wine and his father with Firewhsikey.
It wasn't until after he was spent that he even registered that his traitorous body found that idea better than any fantasy Harry had had to date. He was
Immediately, the stone and tile started moving and slowly sunk into the ground, and in their place was the hole.
He stopped himself from finishing that thought. Oh yes, the avoidance bin in his mind was quite full.
Harry sighed. He didn't have the energy right then to bicker with Malfoy. All the information he learned since seeing the boy last flickered through his mind, and he searched Malfoy's face a moment. Malfoy's father used to be a Death Eater too… He could know something. In fact, if what Harry thought (and desperately hoped) was true that Malfoy didn't know about his father's involvement with the Chamber of Secrets, then it could be possible that Malfoy wouldn't know just how valuable whatever information he had was and wouldn't think twice about sharing it.
"—and that you can't control who you're attracted to. I don't see anything wrong with it, and my uncles certainly don't."
"But I wasn't saying!" Harry yelped, feeling embarrassed and totally defensive. He knew she was the cleverest witch their age, but there was no way she could have already… unless he had done or said something in the past… but he was always so careful... "I wasn't! I didn't mean—I'm not—I'm not like that! I'm
Hermione did not look happy about this at all, but she roamed calculating eyes over both of them and slowly left the room. Harry knew she would be right outside, probably with her wand ready, so he stepped closer and spoke quietly.
said to that horrible woman was, 'er', and 'no.' Is she even allowed to do this? How can she do this?"
to see. His voice when he spoke just sounded, well, snooty like always, but also confused. "He betrayed your parents, Potter."
"Dumbledore's bird, though. He's a phoenix, so they can carry loads…" he trailed off seeing Malfoy blinking at him. "Well, see, I showed loyalty, or something, to Dumbledore, so his bird, Fawkes, appeared, and had the Sorting Hat, which was what gave me the sword of Gryffindor, and Fawkes was the one to peck out the basilisk's eyes so I could fight it, and…"
"More like God save us from cheaters!" Harry whispered-called after him. He watched Malfoy leave the library and frowned back down to his books. "'Save us from cheaters'? That's the best I had?"
Malfoy cleared his throat.  "It will take the rest of our time here tonight, maybe another night, for me to Vanish the decomposition." He sounded oddly formal, and even though Harry still wasn't looking, he could tell by the sounds that he had gone back to his little chest-work-station. "Basilisks decompose slower than I remembered, but it's tricky. Some parts decompose at regular speeds, and those are mostly internal. It's lower intestines, for example, will be absolutely worthless now. Whereas, its tail, that has been in the water this whole time, I'm assuming—please correct me if I'm wrong—would have been in the third phase of decomposition if it wasn't for the water.
Hermione made a slightly annoyed sound. "I'm not saying this right." She resumed walking, and Harry followed, a step behind her. "What I mean to say is that I don't think there's anything wrong with being gay—"
He knocked on her office door, wondering if this was worth it, but his self-preservation was making him stand his ground anyway.
"I found it best, when unsure of what another's reaction will be, that introducing the theory unbiasedly usually offers plenty of opportunities to observe initial reactions."
She was unhappy Harry made them stop by the dorms to put away their things, but Harry didn't want to give himself a chance to get distracted. He also brought his map, hoping to keep an eye out to make sure they weren't overheard. He spotted Rita Skeeter along the lake and was very grateful they were going to the bridge.
She looked thoughtful and considerate a moment. He watched her swallow, blinking rapidly with her own thoughts. " I think," she started carefully, "that it's normal to think about…" she paused, her cheeks going pink, "to think about
Malfoy huffed. "You're an idiot, Potter. Have you really thought I've been cheating all these years?"
Harry clenched his jaw, scowling as he watched Malfoy put on his apron and gear. He had removed his outer robes, and he was wearing different gloves tonight, ones that were tight and stretched up to his shoulders. Harry stared as he rolled one over his bicep.
Really, he guessed, they started over the summer. That was when the cramps started anyway. He assumed they were growing pains, as he had a lot of them in third year. They kept increasing over time, however, and it became clear they were muscle cramps, not growing pains. They had eased off the past couple of months, and he hadn't one since before the Yule Ball.
"Yeah," Harry sighed. He finally dropped his hands and looked around. It didn't seem the other champions and their partners had heard anything.
I know it's a big canon Harry thing that he hates dancing, but I wanted there to be more Luna-dancing in honour of the actress who played Luna and made up the wedding dance during filming. God, I love her.
Harry swallowed down some of his own hateful words. He thought about calling off the whole thing, maybe have Madam Pomfrey examine his head for why he clearly
He watched them go, dragging his feet behind them. They were one of the last to leave, so he simply slowed his pace more and more until most everyone was already in the Great Hall, then he made his way up the marble staircase.
The desire to know Malfoy— to really, truly know him that he had been battling with for weeks, turned into a burning need. He needed to know what Malfoy looked like in other situations, in other settings— in
Lastly: I'm also still unsure with the scene with Hermione walking to Hogsmeade. I've kept changing it back and forth. Any insights, thoughts or opinions anyone wants to offer, please do! I'm happy to change it!
Harry was whipping his wand out in no time, ready to hex Malfoy into next week, even though he himself just snapped at Ron.
He straightened, grabbing her and pulling her into a fierce, tight hug. She made a surprised noise then chuckled, hugging back. Harry had to blow some of her hair from his face then stretched his neck to lay his chin on top of her head.
On the other hand, everything was just as miserable as it had been lately, and the idea of secretly meeting up with Malfoy sent flutters in his stomach. He was extremely curious if more meetings
It was Malfoy. He was looking around, checking that they were alone before looking at Harry. He raised an eyebrow at all the books and glared at him.
Malfoy seemed surprised but nonetheless pleased. "Excellent, Potter." He smirked. "And see, now you have more reason to survive the task because if you die before I can finish this beast, make no mistake… I will make your afterlife hell."
The conversation with Professor McGonagall seemed to have shaken Harry to his core, and it apparently showed. His friends tittered around him all afternoon and evening, asking if he was okay if he went too long lost in thought. Or when he abruptly became silent, having somehow forgotten about everything for a moment only to have it crash around him again.
. Ron was apologising, asking for forgiveness. Harry was only hesitating because he was worried about losing Ron again, losing him because of something else that wasn't in Harry's control, try as he might.
he felt until he smelled the water—a fact which he firmly told himself not to shove away altogether, to think on it later.
Malfoy snorted once then actually barked a quick, albeit quiet, laugh. It reminded Harry a little of Sirius, if not much softer and more dignified. "Did he get sick with slugs?"
"Do you need material, is that why you're asking?" Malfoy smile went wide. "Imagination stretching thin after a couple of years? I've heard about Trelawney, but this, Potter, this is just too good. I must thank you. You have truly given the best yule present I could have asked for. Well, almost."
It was just after the start of term, and Harry and Ron had decided that just because there was no Quidditch that year, it didn't mean they had to go all year without flying. So, Harry grabbed his broom, Ron borrowed one of his own, and they made the trek to the pitch. Malfoy, apparently, had had the same idea, only Malfoy's friends, Crabbe and Goyle, weren't exactly the flying types, and being outnumbered by himself, Malfoy retreated after only a few colourful comments.
Harry quickly lost the thread of the conversation, however, because coming up from the dungeons was Draco sodding Malfoy.
When he barked at Harry and Luna, asking what they were doing there, Harry answered truthfully, "We're here to talk to the ice sculptures."
Ps, I hope everyone has picked up on Malfoy's jealousy in both chapters? I find trying to express how Malfoy feels in only a Harry limited narrative a really fun challenge, but do let me know if I'm doing it wrong. I'm always happy to take another swing.
"Thought Dumbledore said you weren' allowed inside the school anymore." Hagrid frowned, tying the lead securely.
Malfoy, on the other hand, was solely focused on his task, and it depressed Harry that Malfoy was clearly uninterested in whether or not Harry was even there. He tried to tell himself that it was a good thing, that maybe it would give him time to really observe Malfoy and figure himself out.
Professor McGonagall nodded sharply. "Just be sure to find a partner, Mr Potter, and if it is one that would be considered unexpected, inform me immediately."
He had done it. The first task was over. Not only did he do it, but he was also the best out of all the champions. Malfoy's words,
With a furious roar, Harry balled up the paper and threw it across the room. A few first years that had been in there scrambled as soon as Harry started yelling, and now it was just them. Harry rubbed his face roughly. He felt a slight stinging in his eyes, and he took care to rub them extra hard. The absolute
However impulsive and daring his confession to Professor McGonagall was, it had made him feel lighter than even completing the first task did. In a way, her no-nonsense acceptance of him was like her acceptance of regular magical theory, and it felt like he had been given permission to be this way. That he was
When he was in the peak of being uncomfortable, being terribly thirsty, and hot, and itchy, and sore, and obsessed with water, and all things, it felt like he had less access to his magical core. He got tired a lot more easily—
"So, Potter, pray tell, which of your gagging, giggling fans will be on your arm at the ball? That Hufflepuff that towers over you? One of the little firsties that shriek in delight at your mere presence? I do hope it's not one of them—how would we ever hear the music over your precious date's siren song… Ah, but wait, it's not one of them since they're already terrorising the school with their weeping that Perfect Potter rejected them."
. This isn't like last year—and yes, yes, I will admit I was faking most of it if that will get you to listen to me now. Please. Something is wrong with me—this isn't normal. You have to fix me!"
When he failed to speak, Professor McGonagall stopped him, putting both hands on his shoulders. He could see, plain as day, the concern and care in her eyes being viciously stomped down as bravery and stoicism took their place. It caused warmth to spread through him and words to crawl unbidden from his throat.
, and sturdy. How can he look sturdy and graceful at the same time? He walked like he could glide—as if he glided right out of a fashion magazine, Harry's brain unhelpfully provided— as if just walking into the hall was its own elegant dance.
Well, there was hardly a cause that could get Harry to pay attention to Potions, but now that Harry was allowing himself a more wandering eye, he was able to channel his impulse to watch Malfoy into observing his potion-making skills.
. It was just because of the last time, that was all, that was what he told himself. It was a good wank the first time, and that was entirely Malfoy's doing and Malfoy's fault, the blame of that rested with the blond
Reminder, this is a double chapter update, and I am working on a really old, slow computer currently. If you do not see the next chapter button, refresh, and please be patient if you have to do it several times… This thing freezes like black ice.
"Oh, nothing." Malfoy shrugged. "Just… working a project." He smirked at her. "Thought he'd like to know the progress."
Harry didn't look away though. For one, he wasn't going to actually show cowedness despite his carefully appeasing words, and for another, he wanted Snape to see that he was
He scowled at Malfoy, who he decided was solely to blame for this. "Why are you even enrolled in Care of Magical Creatures?"
Draco blinked up from his thoughts. Remembering where he was, he answered clearly, "This is more advanced—the next step. Before, we had an equal understanding of what the object is and will be. In order to transfigure multiple things into one thing each, if you have a more in-depth understanding of what it will be—the rabbit—so, you won't need as much understanding of the first object."
fault. If it wasn't for the fact that Malfoy very obviously had no clue what went on in his mind, Harry would have taken satisfaction in investigating what sort of drug or potion Malfoy slipped him to thoroughly fuck up his life.
Harry shrugged, smiling at Malfoy. "It's talking back to her. I mean, I can't hear anything, but she seems to."
Finally, for my mother's well-wishers, she is doing a lot better. Still at the facility and needing 24/7 oxygen and care, but better. She is determined she will be going /home/, not another facility or residential care. My sister and I are working very hard to get her home up to snuff, but it will be a while. If anyone wants to send wishes, I will continue to send or make cards to send her. The others really did brighten her so, so much.
"—since the tail has been in the water this whole time, obviously. The colouring looks the same as I've read it described, so that's a good sign, I suppose. I'll have to check exactly where these creatures start rotting—"
Malfoy pressed his badge into his chest, and the message upon it vanished, to be replaced by another one, which glowered green:
in on whatever Death Eater plans were brewing, he could easily put it together that Pettigrew was now with Voldemort and flock over to him to help.
Eventually, they found a cornerstone way in the back of the Chamber hidden in condensed shadows with what looked to used to be a carving of a snake. Harry wasn't too sure about it, but he demanded it open all the same. Sure enough, it opened to a very narrow,
"I DIDN'T EXPECT TO LIVE! I KNEW I WAS DEAD! BUT I DID IT! I DIDN'T ASK ANYONE FOR IT, AND I DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS! I WANTED
"No, it's—it's normal. Whatever it is…" she then looked stern though her eyes were wide, "as long as it's healthy, Harry! You know, it's very easy to let emotions get the better of you. You don't want to get stuck in—in something where you're constantly being undermined and insulted and—"
Yesterday—it was a stressful day and sometimes people, that is stress can sometimes, or I heard that, you know, stress can—"
Harry froze. They had made it all the way to the other side of the large Chamber to the second entrance, but it was only then occurring to Harry that though Harry knew how to get
The first was Malfoy not showing up at all. Harry wouldn't be surprised if he didn't. If Harry was in his shoes, he would consider not going on the off-chance it was a prank of some kind, designed as a concentrated affront to humiliate and cause as much emotional damage as possible. Or like the prank Malfoy pulled in their first year, trying to get him caught out after curfew. Harry would still have gone, though, because his curiosity was always getting the better of him, even if it would get him in trouble.
"You mean you are actually taking a course in coming up with ways to die?" Malfoy asked, sounding thrilled.
His voice was muffled and tight as he spoke through his hands, "You… you…" he seemed to give up, turning fully to put his back to Harry. "You… you found Salazar Slytherin's legendary Chamber of Secrets… in a girls toilet, where you fought Salazar Slytherin's monster… with the Sorting Hat that somehow gave you a sword… and you left the beast dead, by having a bird fly you out…"
And really, he couldn't believe that this whole time, Malfoy really did think Harry was an attention-grabbing liar. Those weren't even good lies. God, how embarrassing, that Malfoy for years thought Harry actually and purposely spread a rumour that he pulled Gryffindor's sword from the Sorting Hat and slain a basilisk. Harry knew very well how ridiculous it sounded, which was why Harry assumed
Harry caught her before she could get to the library, their afternoon lessons completed for the day.
Harry nodded sheepishly, fighting the urge to blurt out that Luna was not a real date. He also wanted to take a giant step away from Luna to emphasize the point, but he didn't want to be rude. Luckily, Luna apparently felt the need to clarify as well.
He and Ron had perfected procrastination at this point, after all, so he tried to keep his head down, distracting himself when he wasn't quietly panicking and trying not to brood.
Pain sparked through Harry's knee as he skidded down a few steps, having missed one. A few students walking down them giggled at him as they walked around to pass him. He ignored them, tenderly wiping his knee while re-shouldering his bag.
Please no one be upset about Malfoy's pure joy at imagining ways Harry could die. In this, I'm creating Malfoy with a really morbid sense of humour, and Harry has it too. It's very similar to my own, which not everyone gets, I know. I think Malfoy likes to think his joy is purely from the torment of the enemy, but in reality, he just finds it utterly hilarious that there would be a class where the only way to get good marks is to predict the worst. It's def something that's funny in the books and that canon Harry and Ron can find enjoyment in.
Afternoon lessons were cancelled so everyone could witness the first task, and Harry's last few dragon-less hours seem to blink away. Somehow his first lesson, History of Magic, suddenly blurred into lunch, and before he knew it, Professor McGonagall was hurrying down the table in the Great Hall to collect him.
Ron was admittedly getting on Harry's nerves as well as Hermione's. Ron had become fixated on the fact that Hermione had a date and by consequence, seemed to be noticing more and more things about Hermione, like her now straight teeth or that she carried too many books that her bag should be able to hold. The former, Harry already knew because it was kind of obvious, and the latter Harry never bothered to think about.
He looked back up, and Snape had moved on to continuously wander around the room, watching his students. Malfoy had sat down and was writing inside a small diary of some kind, every now and then looking up at his notes or his potion before writing again. Crabbe beside him was also sitting, chin rested in his hand, and was using Malfoy's stirring rod to flick at the flames. Harry stretched a little to look at the potion itself and saw it was a dark brown colour.
Apologies for these being later than expected. Since Corona took my job, and therefore my only reliable access to my personal drive, I've had a hell of a time trying to get my old computers to work (this one's over a decade old). But I did it!
“I don't know how people do this. How Blue did this. Two words. Two freaking words, and I'm not the same Simon anymore.”
"A broomstick," interrupted a voice. Harry twirled around to see Malfoy, his gang of Slytherins not far behind. They were already cackling even though Malfoy was too far away for them to hear.
In this chapter, there is some text straight from the book, chapter nineteen. The reason for this is because of Harry's conversation with Sirius, so the lifted text is mostly from that dialogue. The reason for /that/ is to remind readers (and also myself so I don't have to go digging through the book all the time) about where we are with canon plot and things.
Harry's stomach rolled as he noticed red spreading in Hagrid's cheeks. He knew the man well enough that it wasn't from the exertion of finishing off the skrewt's knot.
Luna also proved as a good distraction as well. She easily began telling him about the Weird Sisters, a band that appeared were comprised of men although Luna called two of them non-binary before explaining they were individuals that didn't identify as either strictly male or female. Harry didn't know enough about the subject to have an opinion, but he could admit that none of the band members were exactly presenting as strictly either anyway.
would erupt in his mind. He was helpless to stop it, helpless to get rid of it, and the climaxes were so good thinking of Malfoy pressed against him, Malfoy's hands replacing Harry's, that Harry didn't
At one point, they did get into an argument because Harry was mostly convinced that Malfoy wasn't even trying anymore and was just bossing Harry around and making him speak Parseltongue for the hell of it. At another point, they got into an argument because Harry had dozed off while Malfoy was examining individual pillars for any differences among them, which Harry thought was pointless.
. I would like to imagine Salazar Slytherin had planned for that and done the appropriate spellwork, but there's also the matter that you said the creature travelled via the pipes, so there's no telling how much of what residue was on the creature and had affected the water inside here—"
Harry shrugged. "I suppose. But Hermione… You and McGonagall are the only ones who know. I can barely accept it myself, I just… There's no way I can bring a bloke, Hermione."
setting. He needed to see Malfoy grinning in the summer sun, see him laughing across a table from Harry over a shared meal, see him proud in victory having won a Quidditch game, see him alight in excitement over something he was passionate for, see him—
Malfoy's Slytherin friends—Crabbe, Goyle, Parkinson, and Zabini—had reached them now and were laughing at Malfoy's words. For all intense and purposes, Malfoy was mocking Harry. Degrading him and pissing on his win.
He squeezed his fists, feeling himself blush again. This time, he had to look away. "It's called a television. Or telly for short. Computers are similar, but on them, you can play games, communicate instantly over long distances, and… well, other things, but I've never used one, actually."
"I know. But," he shrugged again, "she's not hurting anyone and enjoying herself. I won't stand in the way."
Despite Draco deciding to resolutely avoid thinking about what he did and why he missed class, he could admit to himself that he felt a million times better. His back and legs were still itchy, but it was tolerable. Vinny and Greg attributed his better health and mood to his hospital wing visit, and he didn't correct them.
Harry could tell by her forced cheerfulness that Krum wasn't the one to upset her. He knew her well enough to know she wouldn't hide it if he was. So, when Krum sent him a questioning look over her head, Harry shrugged slightly to signal he didn't know.
Malfoy scoffed but didn't reply. As they made their way to the Chamber, Malfoy detailed the research he had been doing, very obviously pleased with himself.
"Very good, Miss Lovegood," Professor McGonagall praised. "I'm happy to see you both on the same page," she added pointedly, giving Harry an approving and knowing look. Then she shooed them off to the side where the other champions and their partners were waiting.
Across the library, Potter seemed to be in the same frame of mind, looking around, and their eyes locked. Draco raised a cool eyebrow at him, and Potter scowled and looked back down at the book in front of him. Potter, Weasley, and Granger seemed to be studying, and he knew it bugged Potter when they were in the library at the same time. It was never more than the exchange they just had—in truth, Potter probably didn't give them much notice, but when he did, it was satisfying.
He tried to think of girls. He always tried to think of girls. When he first started regularly masturbating—which for him was mostly giving himself permission to, because the Dursleys would always make even the implication of masturbation sound like sin and something wrong and dirty—he would just enjoy the experience of it. Explore the feelings, what felt good, what didn't, that sort of thing. He supposed that was normal. He eventually had to give himself permission to think of other people when he did it, too, because he learned from his dormmates' blatant discussions that doing so was also supposed to be normal.
Harry jumped, jerking his head to Snape who was directly in front of him. Beside him, Ron was viciously trying to stir their potion, presumably to stop it from getting to the bright yellow it was attempting to become.
Harry sighed. "Guys, can we just go back to the castle? I think I'd really like a snack and maybe a nap."
if maybe unusual, even to the strictest woman Harry knew. He hated that he felt anxiety at the sight of Skeeter.
