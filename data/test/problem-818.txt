Soldiers weren’t afforded the luxury of house elves to do their cooking, so a roaster was made to determine who had the honour of cooking and serving that day for a hoard of hungry soldiers.
‘Why did you make us think you were dead?’
Harry rolled his eyes at the stupid question. "That's. What I’ve been trying to tell you! After the battle..."
"WHERE IS SHE!" He demanded, sounding slightly unhinged, as he wrapped his hands around Pansy throat. "WHERE IS SHE!"
The two rudely showed him what to do. Harry moving where he was told, and turning when asked. Before the plank was snatched off him and they were on the move again.
The weight of Pansy pressing his body onto his new form made him stop cold. The warm breath on his ear making him shiver in fear. He’d faced Voldemort, Bellatrix, Fenir. Dragons! But Harry had never felt so helpless or terrified then when the sound of his own voice breathed in his ear. “No one can hear you scream Potter!”
‘Because. The enemy don’t know that. Why do you think I led you over here.’ Gesturing to the secluded grove in which they stood.
Pansy looked at him calculating. Harry felt his skin prickle. His instincts telling him to to run. Even more so when she smiled. A sense of foreboding filling his chest.
Ginny pulled away slightly, staring at him like she couldn’t hardly believe, what she could see, feel and smell.
With a flourish of the crones wand, that looked more like a twig, then an actual wand. Papers were filled out and a prick of blood was taken from Harry. Before being dropped on the box Pansy wand now resided in, for the next fifteen years. Glowing then seamlessly ceiling shut.
"Pansy Parkinson. her name." The auror replied, as Harry countered with, "Harry Potter."
Harry wanted to cry. So he did.
His heart thumping a mile a minute.
Probably sensing he wouldn’t get a rise out of Harry that way, he moved on to who he knew would get under Harry’s skin.
"What?"
‘Than I die. After all...’ he pointed at his doppelgänger that lay prone and lifeless on the grass. ‘I’m already dead.’
"What was that for?" he winced, inspecting the rune.
Again, Harry opened and closed his mouth. Before shaking his head "Nothing."
Harry slammed his hands on the bars, with a resounding clang! Stopping Malfoy. "You, don't understand!" Harry whimpered again grasping the bars white knuckled.
Harry was about to call out to her when another beat him to it. His own. He stilled at the sight of Hermione smiling at the impostor weakly. Don’t be fooled Hermione his mind screamed but she continued conversing with Pansy, none the wiser to the snake she was.
‘Yes, I do.’ He insisted.
Malfoy was frazzled, and a tad panicked.
Upon entry, Harry almost slipped on the black rocks that surrounded the building, as the surly auror lead them straight through the stones and into cramped entryway. Harry was loath to discover that the inside was no warmer then the winds that whipped outside. A skeletal woman with patches of missing hair sneered at them as they approached the lone desk that sat in the far right corner of the small room.
Insurance.
He doubted she knew he was there. Having told her he would be out this afternoon to visit Kingsley about getting his old job back. Half way to the visitors entrance he found himself apperating home. He didn’t want to fight anymore. He’d done enough of that already.
‘Yes. Actually that’s why I’ve come. Hermione is ready to take over as minister once Bone’s is down. She’s I still cant believe the girl we went to school with is behind it all. Are you positive its her.’
“You’ll need to go to medi. I’m afraid my healing charms don’t hold well.” He grinned devilishly. “Like any spell, you have to mean it. I doubt you have a single healing bone in your body. Like most who work here. Your all a step away form being inmates yourselves. And joining us in our cells.” He drawled not breaking eye contact.
"Oh! Potter! Enough! Already!" Malfoy boomed. Taking his hands of his ears. After a half an hour of Potter loosing it. He had gone a bit spare himself.
Draco realised what Harry would later recount as a war cry, before firing the A.K. Farmon body falling into the crashing waves below.
"It's going to be alright Potter." He tried to sooth him.
"Argh" he winced as the rune that had graced his arm since his arrival on Azkaban, vanished.
Leaving Harry and and Ron, Alone.
It was like it was happening again. The memory just kept running through his head. Over. And over. Like it was on repeat. He rocked back and forth on his bed, as if that would make them fade.
"Drop it Potter." he snapped.
Once he was clean Harry, turned around to return the favour. He gently undid Draco’s braid, trying not to get his fingers caught in the dried blood and he brushed his hands though the stained strands and pouring the jug over him.
‘I don’t know Ron. I keep fucking up. Everything I’ve done since coming back, has just been one big fuck up.’ He lamented, head in his hands.
Till now.
"You know what it's like to be raped?" Harry asked. His back to the blond, staring at the slime on the wall, it had grown in the days he'd stopped, caring if he lived or died.
With a pop! A plate appeared at the end of Harry’s map.
Harry felt the bile return.
Harry rubbed at his head. His ears ringing. “No! No! Your not! I’m Harry Potter!” His voice nasily and high pitched. He clasped a hand to his throat in confusion.
Draco looked like he was ready to hex him, if he could. "For Salazars sake. Potter! Just spit it out. Merlin knows I Have the time to wait."
It was always like this after a visit from Parkinson. Harry would learn what he could, from the puzzle that was Pansy's chats. Then he was granted one question. That was always the truth. Harry knew if she was lying. It always came with a price though. Draco knew this.
"What luck? I could wax poetic about the life I've had If I could. But my Imposter stole my ability to do that. Wasn't that lucky!"
"You said to distract you."
While leaving him to dress she went an spoke to the guards, as Harry sat back on the bed noticing the guards eyeing him with disdain.
‘What?’ He wondered at the queer look on Ron’s face.
The rain could be heard as it pelted down upon the weather repelling charms the surrounded the camp. As Harry stared down at his maps, that sprawled over his should be dinning table.
For once he actually listened to him and kept his mouth shut, Harry doubted that there wouldn't be repercussions for his outburst though.
That was till Draco pulled back. ‘We shouldn’t.’ Both taking a step back.
Harry was beginning to wonder the same thing. He’d actually been throwing up for the last month. It was like a nice little cherry on the shit show his life had become.
"Look at those tits." Rick jeered. Tristyn huffing at his comment. As Harry took off his shoes, standing on his discarded cloths, so as not to catch whatever deaeses where living on the revolting floor.
Harry let out a pitiful laugh. "That's funny Malfoy. I'm amazed you can still make the....ugh" he gripped his stomach again.
‘WHAT!’ Harry bellowed. Greenwitch sooshing him not so subtle way. ‘What do you mean he was discharged. I’m second in command and I wasn’t notified.’
On the groggy trip to the spare he passed James open room, noting it was empty. His son spending most evenings at the flat above WWW or at Teddy’s.
"I like em pretty and willing. unless they ask me for it. I don't touch em." Tristyn said, turning on the shower. The cold water splashing down on Harry's head. Harry tried to escape it to no avail. The two laughed at his struggles under it. "Enjoy it. Its the last one your gonna get in a while." Rick yelled over the thundering water.
‘I don’t know.’ Was Harrys lame reply.
"My insurance." She grind maliciously. Staring down at his stomach.
"Fine Potter." Draco sighed. "But if you die. That means your daughter will never know you. Pansy wins. And all you went through would be for nothing."
No. Forget it. It never happened. Just forget.
‘It’s usually meant to be moving.’ Harry snickered. Waving his hand, and casting a slight confunduss on the muggles below, as he tuned it on.
So like often happens when he doesn’t know how to react. His mouth ran away from him, speaking before his heart could catch up.
‘Maybe its not what you see, but what you don’t.’ Luna supplied cryptically.
Harry gave them another look, "They defiantly got bigger."
"There is no need for the snark." came his reply.
"It's just. Well she's not your daughter. She's Pansy."
There was also the fact that Albus was now best friends with Scorpius Malfoy.
On his way to the soldiers mess he couldn’t help but sense that feeling in his gut that told him trouble was coming, something terrible.
Harry rolled his eyes, as he lifted his forearms out through the bars. "Notice anything?"
The guards led Harry this way and that, Till Harry was shoved into the room where harry first meet Parkinson. And that was who greeted him upon entry.
"Catch." Harry threw the piece of fruit.
It was as Draco had predicted. The war ended not with a battle, but with diplomacy. Bones was gone. Sent to Azkaban for treason to the ministry and orchestration of war. The evidence against her inestimable. She was to receive the kiss by end of week. The last of Azkaban prisoners to receive it till Hermione had the dementors disbanded, and sent to a sanctuary specially designed for them.
"Whatever it is keep it, I don't want it." ready to bang on the doors, and demand the guards take him back to his cell. Shocking as it might be, it was preferable over spending anymore time in Parkinson's company.
"But I really am Harry Potter." he protested. The crone awful voice cut through. "war. essed 'er ub 'ood. Azkaban. 'ill vive 'er 'ad." she grind. "wha' 'er 'ame oods."
Harry rushed forward banging his palms on the rusty surface of the table that Parkinson sat behind.
‘I’m doing this, because of what we just went through. We now have a chance to turn the table of this war. There wont be diplomacy till the corrupt are gone we have the means to collect information under the radar. Trust me Draco. It’s the only way.’ Harry pleaded.
Tears fell from Harrys eyes as he waited for the next wave of pain to hit, so he could push.
A relived sigh fell from Harry lips, as he bent down beside him. ‘Don’t you dare scare me like that. Your not going to die.’ He implored, getting to work cleaning the wound.
Draco’s screamed, scrunching up his face in pain, tears spilling out the sides of his eyes.
‘I usually start by asking about a couples previous relationships, but I needn’t bother with this, as most... well.’ She gestured to the two of them. Her annoyingly soothing voice cutting off abruptly.
Since his arrest, that constant sate of nausea had been relentless. Waiting in his holding cell, never knowing when they would whisk him off to Azkaban, or even give him a fair trial. Well.. A trial in any case. Harry highly doubted it would be fair.
Who he had brung to the Burrows Sunday dinner.
Their coupling was rough and frenzied, with absolutely no finesse. Draco having to find Harry’s entrance once or twice in his impatience. But fuck it if it wasn’t the best sex they’d had.
And it was at that moment that the tell tale sound of the guards approaching rang through their cell block, that Harry's so called luck ran out.
Malfoy flushed in what Harry knew to be embarrassment. "Oh, Shut your trap, Potter." He whined. "Its not those womanly issues again is it?"
The two let out a chuckle leaning in as if to kiss.
"Pansy? Are you okay?" Malfoy called out from the cell across from him.
Rick's face looked thunderous. "Why you little bitch! I'll teach you to make fool of me." he raised his bat, ready to slam it down on Harry's face. Harry flinch getting ready for impact, but mid swing the bat was caught by Tristyn.
Malfoy seemed to be contemplating his next words carefully, as he threw his hair up into a messy bun, wisps of silver blond framing his handsome features. Harry liked when he put his hair up like that.
"Potter!" he barked. Glaring at him.
When the sun rose into the sky, tell the world it was time for a new day, the two went about there morning routine as usual. Packing the tent away for the last time.
“IM HARRY POTTER!!!” He screamed, as they disaperatted from Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and wizardry.
"Okay. Potter just, breath and you will get through this.."
"NO! NO! NO! NO!"
Harry gulped. The memory of his first day in this hell returning, and the threat that came with being thrown in his cell.
"Why does she do this?" Draco exploded. "I knew the girl. We were best friends. I don't understand it."
“What? Nothing to say. He continued, through the cold damp hallways. Walls oozing an unknown substance. Harry clenching his fists, nails creating crescent moons on the soft flesh of his palms.
"Listen Harry. This is no joke Pansy must have.." He didn't get to finish, as Harry started to shake his head in incredulity. Shouting out:
Greenwitch opened his with relish, the sender written on the envelope caught Harry’s attention. Looking around the mess wondering why Donaldson would send a letter when he was in their platoon.
‘JUST DO IT!!!’ Was Harry screamed back scrambling for purchase.
‘Donaldson’s up the duff.’ Malfoy supplied. Squeezing himself in between Harry and a witch called Gunderson. ‘Scooch over would you Potter.’
Let me know if you spot any errors, and I'll be sure to fix them.
And neglected to inform his father of this little fact.
"When did captain oblivious start using his head." Malfoy tried to deflect with snark.
‘Well.’ Ginny turned to face him, never one to back down from anything, no mater how humiliating or painful. ‘The tent Harry.’
With a grunt Draco came just after Harry pulling out only once Harry ha milked every last drop. Before placing the man back on his feet.
Potter just didn't deserve to be here.
Harry waking at the sound turning to wake Draco from his night terrors. With a gasp, Draco jolted into a sitting position.
He let out another scream of anguish. "That was an open and shut case. Three years ago! I've been a model inmate since then. Zero infractions on my prison record. And she testified in my defense. I don't believe that you have nothing to do with this."
Harry now understood, why people used to cower before him. When he could look like that it was no wonder.
BANG! The two of them turned at the sound. The footfalls of Dragonhide boots echoing off the walls.
"Yeah. So the time your department let Grindelwald escape. I guess that wasn't M.A.C.U.S.A fault." Malfoy taunted.
"ARRGGHH!" He screamed in anger and frustration. Causing a ripple effect, when the other sorry souls, that laid in the other cells cursed and groan, the hole that was Azkaban prison.
‘I’ll talk to Dawlish before we head out. I’ll hand myself over to the Norwegians, before I doubt Harry Potters Magical instincts.’ Draco smirked, patting Harrys knee as he rose from the lounge. ‘Now get to sleep Potter or I’ll steal all your maps.’
Harry felt as if he’d been struck. Because, well he had a point. That didn’t mean it didn’t sting.
Ding! Ding! Ding!
‘End. It. Harry.’ Ron insisted.
‘I’m not dead yet Potter’ came the weak reply.
"Now. check what color the fluid was when your water broke."  Harry was hesitant but he did as instructed.
Harry found himself picking up the pace, until they both came together. Harry panting hard as he slipped out of Malfoy tight hole. Getting up and resting against the grandfather clock that stood nearby.
‘Are you insane Potter! After what we just went through. You want us to become hit wizards.’ Draco scowled, his ire evident in is stoney expression.
‘Your breath smells,’ she laughed.
"It's just-" Harry shook his head again. "No. it's nothing."
‘Yeah.’ He panted distractedly.
"No! You fool! You can have fun after its been to medi." Rude. Harry though. "For now. remove it's dam cuffs. It wont be going anywhere." he grinned meaninglessly, pulling out his wand.
She laughed. "That quickly, Tell me when you figure it out Potter, I'd like to see how long it takes you."
‘Ladies, gents.’ Harry greeted, sliding into the seat.
Draco climbed atop him arse placed over his face.
"I was wrong. Your tits are bigger."
He just wanted it all to stop. See his family again. Remus, Tonks, Sirius, Mum, Dad. He blinked slowly as his thoughts raced through his head. They didn’t give up their lives so he could lay there in the dirt after avenging them. And saving the wizarding world.
‘I’m so sorry. I am such a tit some times.’ He tried to apologise.
"What. The. Fuck!" he splutters. His mind racing back to, that night. "GET OFF ME! GET OFF ME! DON'T TOUCH ME! NOT AGAIN! NOT AGAIN!" His screamed, struggling to push her off.
So he did.
"what?" Harry chastised sensing Malfoy wasn't finished.
"Now. Look at that twat! Gotta love Purebloods. They are always spelled so hair doesn't grow where they don't want it ." Tristyn leered. Making Harry turn around to have at least some modicum of privacy.
"Well, I wouldn't call what they gave me a proper trial. I suppose there was at least some form of legality. My mother was given amnesty for her crimes. Granger told Shacklebolt about her saving Potter-"
"Why Is it that your my only visitor."
‘So what do you propose we do.’
"NO! NO! NO! NO!"
His body went still.
Harry tried to bite back his laughter, least he get a beating from Ricks bloody baton.
It hit. And Harry screamed. Two exhausting hours later a cry of a different kind, filled Harrys cell.
He couldn’t see him though. Not if he wanted to keep his marriage. His family.
"That's a good girl." She taunted.
“You know when you do that while he’s on duty, you don’t help quell his obsession with you,”
The sound of James gagging could be heard filling the room.
Drip! Drip! Drip!
After patiently listing, he asked. "Why you?"
"For the thousandth time Malfoy! I'm not Pansy! How many times do I need to tell you, before you get it through that thick pureblooded head of yours." Harry groans in frustration, flushing the loo as he does so.
Malfoy chose that moment in time, to look up from his stationary apple, at the naked Harry. "Fucking hell! Potter!" He screeched, trying to avoid eye contact.
Muffled screams filled the tent, as Harry apperated them straight onto their bed.
Harry scowled out of spite.
"NEVER! Call me that again. You lost the right to ever even speak to me again, when you watched them take my daughter. AND DID NOTHING!"
"I don't know?" Harry panted. "Distract me. Tell me what to do!" He grunted moving over to his bed, resting his outstretched arms against it edge, doubling over as the pain came, then subsided, before returning after a minute or two.
“Whatever freaky Friday shit you’ve pulled undo it now!” He demanded. Crowding her space it was an odd sight seeing yourself look down at you in such a menacing way. It sent a shiver down his spine.
"Just do it Potter." He barked. Getting off his shity bed, and over to the bars. Surprisingly, he did as he was told without question.
With another sigh, Draco got up from his bed, to do his daily exercises, Harry remaining stoic on his mattress. Despite Potters words. When the dinner popped into appearance.
‘You mean to tell me you have known for three months, and didn’t think to tell me each time I’ve asked what’s new?’
Taking a deep breath Harry knocked.
Unwarranted images flashed through his mind at the thought of draco. Sweat soaked skin, long blond locks, that left unattended looked like waves as they fell down aristocratic shoulders.....Shaking his head he tried to clear it off those images.
So he began to wonder the halls, the once cheerful castle a ruin. Littered with the bodies of the fallen children, who once learnt and roamed in its halls.
The sound of climax. And a heat pouring into his new appendage. Continuing to rock long after it had finished.
‘My point. Is in the grand scheme of things, you aren’t the chosen one in this war. The only way this ends is in a political end. Until then we do what our platoon is told, we listen to our commanding officer.’ Draco explains, giving Harry a pointed shove.
Hence Harrys hasty retreat, to the bathroom.
Ginny rose on her knees behind him. Pressing her naked body against his back, wrapping her arms around his neck.
Malfoy actually laughed. A rare sound in the cells of Azkaban. It made Harry smile. "No potter. I do not think they have gotten bigger. They will unfortunately be seared into my brain for all eternity. But they have not gotten bigger." He chuckled.
James rubbed a hand behind his neck, making Harry raise a brow. That was one of his own tells, when he was about to say something he knew another wouldn’t like. Draco actually pointed it out to him when he was first drafted.
Malfoy was not expecting a reaction like this from Potter. He was usually all fire never ice.
"Stop being a twat Potter. Now. Turn to the side."
Harry felt his blood boil. ‘I’m, sorry. What!’
The woman had even waxed his eyebrows.
‘Do I really look that different? I can shave the beard if that helps. I didn’t have one the last time you saw me.’
The two dried and dressed themselves in silence, Draco having collected his belongings before....
‘I wasn’t joking. That horrid tattoo would be gone and everyone would quite staring at it.’ He stated, eyes following Harry.
They took each others robes of slowly, a leaving a trail to the bed.
“Pansy Parkinson. You are under arrest for the adding and accomplicing of death eaters. You are found to be charged with the aid of you know who by way of turning over Harry Potter to his forces.” The woman stated.
"Did you know, in ancient Greece. Throwing an apple to a woman, was a symbolic deceleration of love? And if they caught it, it meant they returned that love." Malfoy said.
‘Right!’ Harry tried to sound nonplussed. But the truth was, he was shitting himself.
‘Fuck yes!’ Draco groaned. Pulling down his pants as Harry did the same, jumping into Draco’s arms one he had rid himself of the offending garment. Draco spinning him onto the the tree.
Harry turned to face the grandfather clock which had just chimed 11pm, he used to stay up longer than this, but by now he and Draco would be pitching the tent.
"I've never seen you before." He stated, placing his hands onto the grimy wall. Catching a glimpse of black gelled back hair, and a well defined chin. "Are you with M.A.C.U.S.A?"
Now standing in the wooded area they had called home for who knew how many weeks, the two lifted the protection charm that surrounded their little eden.
Harry didn't talk to Malfoy for a year after his daughter was taken from him.
Harry cut him off with a scathing glare. "In case it has escaped your notice im not exactly in my body. Now am I!"
Everyday Malfoy would watch him slowly waste away. He had respected Harry's wish to never speak to him again, but he just couldn't anymore. When the pop! of the thirteenth day of food went away, Malfoy cracked.
The two of them only killed when necessity dictated it.
He stared at his double bed, that was illuminated by the blue Flame that sat in jars beside his bed, resting on a pile of suitcases that served as a nightstand. He had no idea how long he stood there for but it wasn’t long until he felt draco come up beside him.
‘I know. Maybe I should have us see someone. A mind healer perhaps. If not for us, than at least for him. I love him Luna. I cant bare to see him like this. And I know I haven’t been the most attentive of him since he came back. Godric, I barley have time for myself of late. But that seems to be my underlying problem, its not about me. He fought in a war. He needs more time than I’m giving him to assimilate back to....’
They soon stopped in a tiled, rather moldy, room. Harry presumed it was what was meant to pass as a bathroom. The floor was slippery where he stepped. The greenish brown slime that covered the floor almost made him land on his ass.
Dr dollie, as Harry had decided to call her. Not bothering to learn her name. He doubted they would be returning after this. Looked down at her notepad, as the quill stared them both down, after jotting down what Ginny had said.
‘An old friend. From the war. He wants to meet up in two weeks.’ He supplied. Writing the time and date onto the fridge calendar, and sending off his reply.
‘No, its quite alright Mrs Potter. Your right.’ She stared him down. ‘I should treat you like any of my other clients, I only thought to shorten the process for you as, your wife informed me that you are quite opposed to Mind healing.’
Looking down Harry realised he to was naked as the day he was born. Summing his robe, he followed Ron into the dining area.
‘Thanks.’ He replied distractedly, lighting up more areas of the map.
First came his shirt, flinging it to the floor as he sat on the edge of the bed, hands between his knees breathing heavily.
Entering the kitchen he found Ginny. Her back to him as she searched through the fridge. Pulling out a bottle of elf wine.
"Up it is then. 10-A" He said. And the cage began to zoom up, and up, and up. Till it stopped, at a set of rusty bars, that made a awful sound when opened.
He tried to push her off, but she was stronger, He could feel his heart start to race, and a wave of terror overcome his body as he began to shake.
With a grunt. It seamed like the witch was done. She pressed the head of dead bird, and with a pop! Two Azkaban guards showed up. One giving the witch a toothy grin "Rosie." he said then kissed her on cheek.
‘What was it.’ He whispered, running his fingers gently through his hair.
Malfoy gave him the dirtiest look, at Harry's statement. As if he thought he was the stupidest wizard to ever live.
The sound of Moody words rang in his head “constant vigilance” it said.
For the wait this chapter is quite short but you need calm before the storm. Enjoy lovely’s
Harry was indeed very much alone. Planning to wallow in his hotel room with his racing thoughts. But Harry was never one to stay still for long, so he took himself for a stroll around muggle London.
No. Not long now at all.
Not wanting to spend anymore time there he left. Making his way to the great hall. The night had fallen again, he’d spent nearly the whole day.....
Sensing his mood Malfoy changed the subject. "What did you find?"
"Yes." he whisperd. "Well, who better to share your secrets with, than your naked cell mate."
‘The scavengers/vultures will be here soon, we best pack up camp before they show.’ Draco prompted.
What disease had Pansy given him when she switched them? He was about to ask, when he was rudely yanked up, and dragged bare foot to another room.
"My sentiments exactly." Harry replied.
‘I’m here kiddo. I’m here. I’m not going anywhere.’ Harry cried.
‘Well. Um. It only happened last night, well... early this morning I should say. See. Um. See......’
‘About what?’ Harry mumbled into his shoulder eyes closed and drowsy with exhaustion.
‘Sound’s favourable.’
The guards jeered and heckled. As layer by layer fell to the floor. Soon he was only standing in a pair of lacy underwear.
Harry almost feel over, eyes growing wide.
‘Yes. Sir.’ Harry sneered, a smug sort of satisfaction spread across Dawlish features.
"I..I dont know, whats..wha... Hap-happening. These, pains. they just..." He winced, as a gush of liquid started to rush down his legs. He looked down at the puddle in mortification. "And now I've pissed myself." he whimpered uncharacteristically.
Harry stilled at the sound. Before turning in horror.
‘It’s a standard mission that five can complete, we have done several missions exactly like this, and we do not need the whole platoon. It just boggles my mind, its a retrieval mission, you want to go under the radar not, swarm in wands blazing with the whole bloody platoon! It’s reckless and unnecessary.’ He lamented, slugging off his dragon hide boots, and throwing them Merlin knew where.
‘What is your point Draco.’ He sighed, rubbing his beard.
The grass looked better then half the places they had set up camp in their time as AK’s. what could it hurt to pitch it.
The medi-witch however, was the nicest of the sorry bunch he had been so privileged to meet. Examining him with the guards watchful eyes upon them, before dressing him in the familiar Azkaban garb. It was a fresh one at least, he thanked Merlin. Harry feared that he would have been given a used one, caked in blood.
When asked later neither man could tell who made the first move, but it was fast and oh so heated, the rest of their cloths soon found their way to the floor.
Harry’s mind flashed. “Run away with me, Harry.”
Harry twitched in the snow, reapplying his warming charms, feeling a tad sick.
"That"s good. Now You need to count how fair apart the pains are, when they next hit." He ordered.
‘I think it may be best to hold off on explanations till after your mum and siblings are all here.’ Taking a sip of his English tea, a sigh of contempt escaping his lips. It had been to long since he’d had a proper English tea.
‘I MIGHT HIT YOU.’ Draco screamed.
"Oh. listen to the mouth on it." Tristyn smiled. "Take em off girl. Or. like I said. I'll do it."
"It's me, or rather, you. That I've done done something to. A simple variation of notice me not charm. My father invented." She said with a bragging air. "You see he was quite apt at inventing new spells, and modifying old ones. A skill he passed on to me, but enough of that. The spell is what you want to know about. And this one makes those under its thrall, see what the recipient wants them to see. causing them to miss whats right under there noses. And that dear Potter. Is why your tedious little friends have not come to save you." She said with a triumphant grin.
The Auror elbowed him, while placing Pansy wand on the counter. The part Hag, Harry guessed. snatched up the wand quickly. Inspecting it, before sniffing it. Drawing the full length of the wand under her nose.
He hasn’t seen his wife in 3 years, and they hadn’t spoken for one. What did one do when reconnecting with ones wife? Probably stoped referring to themselves as one. He thought.
Draco whispered something wandless, Harry gasped and things became more, well more as the two joined, wrapping their arms around each other needing to be closer.
She had made him look like those old pure-blooded wizards that just reeked of money. Not unlike Malfoy Snr. Long curly hair tied at the nape of his neck. Clean shaven, with horrid glasses, That again spoke of money. Harry loathed to think what his Gringots vault would look like, once she'd had her way with it.
Harry looked over his shoulder at him, in mild surprise, he mind momentarily taken of the pain.
‘Oh, she’s at work. She’s the head of the prophet these days.’ James beamed, looking proud of his mother’s accomplishments. This in turn made harry smile to see his son so proud of Ginny. ‘Well, co-head. She shares the title with auntie Luna.’
Harry stared at himself in disgust. He had started to resent his own face. Another little plot of hers, he supposed. So that, if he ever got his face back he wouldn't want it.
Harry moved over eyes bulging, as Draco took of his hair net, spelling it over to the bin.
Before he knew what was happening a wand was at his throat. Mr balls haven't dropped yet holding on to him tight. "Say your Potter again. And I'll remove your voice box." he threatened.
‘So. Does this mean my husband’s back?’ She asked, leaning against the back door. A tentative grin, making its way across her face.
When he was taken back to his cell, one word played over and over in his mind, As Draco attempted to get him to speak. Not until the morning after, when their breakfast slop popped! into being did Harry speak.
Harry got of the lounge, taking the objects off him, and placing them on the table behind him. ‘He’s off to resurrect us. We have till morning.’
Harry sooshing him with a soothing voice, coaxing him into his arms, lying him back down across his chest, and snugging his head under his chin.
"Don't try something you'll regret, Potter. One wrong move and something tragic might befall you precious daughter." She threatened, a menacing gaze flashing across what were once his features.
‘You really don’t Harry. We were in a war. Apart for three years. I thought you were dead I know what your going to say. Ive heard the stories. It’s fine Harry I’m not thrilled about it. But I understand. As long as it didn’t mean anything...’
‘What about my sister! Your kids! Our family! What about them Harry. You cant just put them through this!’ Ron barked.
Draco and him used to do their best work on nights like this. Under cover of the blacking abyss of uncertain night. Harry knowing the way though, with the help of his maps. Draco... well being Draco.
‘I don’t care.’ She grinned back. Grabbing his dick and guiding it to her entrance. ‘It’s been so long Harry.’
Harry let out a small scream of frustration, turning to the wall and giving it a swift kick. As pansy boasted behind him.
It was four months, in the prison that was a woman's body. That Harry made a discovery.
Harry's stomach dropped. Two years. Two years.
Well. She wasn’t wrong. Harry thought as he rested his head against the cool stone.
Harry’s eyes roved over the lit Ferris wheel, as the sun began to set.
‘Since the chosen one needed me to.’
‘Hey kiddo.’ Harry beamed.
Drip! Drip! Drip!
"What?" Draco, questioned.
Harry ran back in with warm towels, healing potions, skeligrow and musclemaker and skincralwer.
"What?" he spat.
Draco remains silent for all of two minutes, placing both hands in the middle of the mountain range, that rested to the left of the battle grounds.
‘Hey...hey, what’s the matter.’ Harry consoled him, making his way around the table.
‘Here I was thinking they enlisted you for your potions mastery and previous experience working on the wrong side of war.” Harry retorted.
‘To Teddy’s. I think you and mum need to be alone for this.’ Popping on his gloves and beanie. Opening the door, he hesitated in the entrance way. ‘You’ll still be here when i get back wont you?’ He worried.
‘Draco is not me lac...’
‘You already know everything about our relationship because of unauthorised biographies and what witch weekly has said about it..’ Harry snapped.
she seemed to be getting bored now, done with her little mind games. "Tell me darling. Why do you think, He has figured it out. And your best friends." she said mockingly, in a disgusting baby voice. "Haven't come to your recuse."
Now was one of those times.
‘And it’s not just the tent. I feel like you....’
‘We are.....ugh..that much....closer to ending this...Agghhhhh!’ Harry filling himself with Draco that much more.
How could he.
‘Gonna make you come to hard Dr....Darling.’ He panted, slowing on his stumble. Before picking up the pace.
‘Harry. What are you doing?’ Ginny wondered taking up mantel beside him.
‘I thought I just said not to speak!’ He reprimanded. The sound of Draco filling the bath, white noise in the background.
"Aren't you going to turn around?" Harry said wrapping his arms around himself.
"Walk around." The scratchy voice called out, from Malfoys right.
‘What?’
Hugging him back fiercely, Harry thanked Merlin his best mate was here.
When the medi-witch came back, she abruptly took Harry's wrist. Branding a protective rune on to it, with the tip of her wand. Harry felt tears leak as he ripped his arm from her grasp, cradling it to his chest. Pansy really had zero tolerance for pain.
Silence filled the field, it seemed to stretch on into forever until..
"Did you honestly believe I"d bring her here." She panted.
"She's as good as the pureblood whores on knockturn. I had one last night. Her mouth on my cock, and another one eating out her pussy." He rubbed at his hard on. "Best night of my life. Then went home and the miss's rode me. Her tits bouncing milk oozing down her pregnant belly." he garbed at himself again. From what Harry could see.
Harry was reeling. "I can't believe you just told me that."
‘It was a hex potter. I don’t recall your brother in-laws ear ever growing back.’
"Malfoy!" Harry shot back. Urging him to shut his mouth. Before Rick actually did join his cell.
And he’d never even thought to take the kids to one.
Malfoy smirked. "I'm Rubbing off on you, Admit it."
“Potter!” He spat mockingly. Harry glared in reply. “You’ve got a visitor.” Harry’s heart stopped. He only ever had one visitor. “Get your skinny ass up, before I make you.” He bellowed. Opening the cell with his thumb on the lock. The guards weren’t allowed wands in the cells, though that didn’t stop them sometimes.
He sounded defeated. Harry wanted to ask. Oh how he wanted to. But he held his tongue for some time before he couldn't anymore.
So many things had changed. Members of his family, who had been together before he left for the war, now had not talked to each other in months. There was a new Diagon Alley, And family activities they once did religiously had now fell by the way side.
Draco sighed, he couldn’t deny that there was a grain of truth to Potters words.
"She's gone Potter." Malfoy said from his place upon his bed.
She smirked in reply. "I couldn't very well have the only person, who could see through my ruse walking around free. Now could I? Well, second The other ran off to Norway With the grandson of Newt Scamander. So that solved that Problem."
Harry hands were back on her throat. Unfortunately though, this time she saw it coming, and flipped their positions. Knocking the breath out of him.
He felt her grin against her cheek.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry found himself beneath Draco’s blood stained body, the two frotting feverishly against one another. It wasn’t enough though.
‘Eloquent as ever Potter.’ Draco smiled.
Both Harry and Draco were stunned and relieved at the. A 3 year war had ended somewhat anticlimactically.
‘HARRY!’
‘We become Ak’s’ Harry breathed.
Harry let out another scream. The shaking of the bars, could be heard down ether end of the cell block, to the annoyance of the other inmates. Who make their displeasure known, using words Harry didn't even know existed.
"However." The minister continued.
Then they would go back to their tent, and fuck. That was their world the two of them and that musty, smelly, Merlin awful tent.
‘Harry. What’s wrong.’ He whispered, resting against the tub with Harry, flicking of the shower with a quick spell.
They were a great team, night or day.
"Do these look bigger to you?" he asked, absentmindedly. As he continued to stare down at them.
"And why might that be." Why harry asked he didn't know. For he knew the answer.
Both guards guffawed at the joke. Though none of them knew. It wasn't a joke.
‘Oh.’ Harry said. As his mind supplied “Run away with me.”
The Bitch grinned at him, in that awful way. He Hated seeing his face do that. "Believe what you will. I have another reason for coming."
Wools laughed. "Oh. Haven't you heard Rick. This one here ain't no death eater. It's Harry Potter. " He laughed, in that feminine way of his.
"We'll take it from here Wools." Huh? So that's his name. "I'm sure she wont be the last death eater scum, you'll be bringing us today." the guard with a bat, and.. was that blood? on his boots. Joked.
‘Yes. But that is only due to the fact a certain scar head has been M.I.A since our debriefing, and has missed dinner.’ He drawled. ‘Here.’
"How does it feel, living the rest of your life in a lie." He retorted.
Harry joined in with her.
It was nearing Christmas.
All to soon there coupling had climaxed with the both of them coming with a silent cream, falling onto to the coach in a blissful haze.
Harry smirked up at him in the middle of a push up, pansy’s breast brushing the floor at each press down.
His double laughed again mockingly. “No. Darling I think you’ll find that your not.” And with a flourish of Harry’s wand his double transfigured a piece of rubble into an intricate mirror. Letting it float in front of his face.
‘Really.’ Harry grinned. ‘I’m proud of you James.’
‘Prat!’ Harry smiled, before it slowly slipped of his face. Draco’s falling with it. ‘I have a bad feeling about tomorrow Malfoy. I cant explain it, my instincts tell me that something is wrong, and they have never let me down before.’
Turning his attention back to Draco, his expression did not bode well for him.
‘It’s just I...I... never thought I’d get to hear you say that to me again. Fuck, dad. I missed you.’ He sobbed into Harrys shirt.
Steam rising off of it and Harry, as he once again found himself staring off blankly. He felt like he should be doing something, but he just couldn’t grasp what that was.
With a pop! They were back in what Harry had dubbed their tent.
"Yes! Why? is the question."
‘Run away with me Harry!’
‘I..’ Draco stammered. Cursing himself for such an unmalfoyish trait.
‘How long?’
The guards stopped in front of what appeared to be an empty cell. Opining the door, and nudging him in. He was having trouble figuring how to walk again. Not wanting to let go of the last vestiges of freedom.
‘Yeah, but let’s catch up. I’ll send you an owl.’ Turning to leave, before doubling back. ‘Take care of yourself Potter.’ He smiles, leaving Harry to his thoughts on the muggle streets of London.
Harry Riley topped but on one rare occasion. It was on this rare occurrence that Ron found them. The two of them lost in the throws of passion, surrounded by a mound of pillows.
Thrusting, kissing, coming.
It was as he walk passed a Harrods that he pumped into someone, almost sending them flying, if not for his seeker reflexes, they would have.
‘One last time.’ Harry moaned, into Draco’s ear. His bread dragging across Malfoy’s porcelain skin.
"Whats the matter with you?" He queered, slowly making his way to the bars.
‘So. Ive been thinking it might be favourable, if we went to see a mind healer.’ Ginny declared, over another James free dinner.
"How I've missed that face." Pansy smirked.
Harry knew that as soon as the guards came, that stony exterior would be back in place, like the finest marble.
‘She’s usually here about quarter to. But big news days are unpredictable.’
What with Balthazar long dead, He found his mind starting to slip back to that dark place, The place Draco had dreaded he would return to as soon as he left.
"So, you admit you took her. You just Stole her from me." He seethed, staring down at himself.
Being unbound and falling to the ground.
"Potter, take off your cloths." He ordered.
"Morning Potter." He greeted, as he scooped another hand full. Harry coked his head in confusion. Malfoy was acting like.. well like nothing happened.
‘Of course I’m a slytherin. As I was saying, he was told to leave immediately. Oh and Dawlish wasn’t that inclined to listen to me after that. So.....we apperate at midday.’ Said Draco taking a sip of tea out of his paper cup, pinky out like the aristocrat he was, making another face at the taste and charming it out of existence.
Until.
"FUCK!!!"
‘That’s what I thought solider. And though I have no reason to tell you such information. And despite what you may think. I have no say on where we are stationed or sent. Though I have a small amount of sway, my orders come from the gamot. And they have ordered this platoon use its full force for this operation. I hope that puts your mind, or as Malfoy puts it, your gut. At ease. Now take your leave mister Potter.’ With a nod that said we’re done here, Dawlish turned his attention back to his papers.
"I KNOW! I know.. its just. What if they grant me bail. What then?" His Worry evident. He needn't have.
Harry knew of course. The scavengers or ‘vultures’ as they have come to be called by the soldiers, were in charge of collecting the dead. They were a neutral party in the war, one of the safest regiments in the Godric forsaken, buggering piss stain of a war.
‘You grew a beard.’ She moaned, grasping at his furry face.
"There your cuffs are off. Now. Strip." Rick sneered at her, as he garbed the cuffs from the floor.
"You boys know, as well as I. If you didn't lift a charm yourself, and you haven't had the wizard who cast it, come to you and reverse it. Than there is only one other way a rune can be lifted." His dry croaky voice supplied, from his usual spot against his bars. "The medi witch is dead."
"Are you gonna explain to me why I'm starkers?"  Harry harrumphed.
"Have one of my days?" Harry supplied. Draco gave a subtle nod.
They undid their belt. And there pants fell to the floor.
His mind felt like it was short circuiting his head bowed so as to release the strain on his neck. He felt robes being pushed to the side and he kicked out at her, as she roamed her hands over a body that was once hers.
On their last hit, they had been given intel that a strike on Hogwarts had been called. After all that’s where Scorpius was. The ultimate way to lure out Draco.
Harry got up and kicked his bed. Wondering if it was worth it, to fling his dingy mattress around the cell. One of the perks to sitting in a cell all day, you have plenty of time for cardio. He opted for punching the wall instead, until his knuckles bled. Before falling to a heap on the floor.
‘They. They said you were dead. We buried you. I cried we all cried. But your here. Your alive.’ James sobbed. Pulling Harry back into a fierce hug. ‘Dad.’ He sobbed again. ‘Your alive. Your alive!’
He wasn’t thinking as he raced through the tent to Draco’s potion cabinet, instead of just summing them to his side, he wasn’t think because Draco was laying on their bed with Half his right arm hexed off.
"What are you talking about." He grumbled, as another Wave of pain hit him.
"Your in prison, love. You got no rights here. So, I suggest that you hurry this along, before I come over and rip those lovely little school girl robes off you." Tristyn threatened. "I Aint got all day." he warned raising his wand.
“Just answer me this Potter, is it not odd that your the only one he talks to?”
‘Naturally.’ Harry scoffed.
‘Frankly I don’t care one iota, what the death eater is to yo......’
They had planned for this, but planning and reality are two entirely different things. He should know after the year he, Ron and Hermione were on the run.
The Kiss.
"Never!" Harry shot pack with conviction. Staring Malfoy down. He swore he saw the exact moment it clicked.
It was only two weeks ago. Two weeks ago! That he was living in here, with Draco. Fucking on any available surface they could get to the fastest.
The billowing scream, waking Malfoy from his fitful sleep. Not having realized, that Potter had left he knew he was back though.
A quick quotes quill, floating impatiently beside the plump witch. As she watched them from her couch, overstuffed with pillows and adorned with random doilies. Seemingly waiting for them to speak first.
Screams pierced the peaceful night, as Draco screamed out in his sleep.
Draco smiled back, sitting on the floor as he rested against the bars. Holding his hand close to him. It was bruised now. Purple and blue, against the pale ghost white of his skin.
Harrys green eyes, gleamed back at him in triumph and amusement.
‘No. Draco. I know what you are going to say, but diplomacy wont work if the body is corrupt. I know you are still apart of the gamot. But face it Malfoy, this war keeps pointing back to the gamot.’ Harry interrupted.
‘I..ugh....know...I....fucking....love...it....when..you...make them talk.’ Draco gasped. Grasping Harry’s hands to make them go faster.
His double laughed in amusement. Throwing its head back as they did so. “Why. I’m Harry Potter of course!” They chuckled in reply.
Malfoy didn't answer. So Harry took that as a sign to continue.
“They would if I told them.” He mumbled in reply. “Darling the ministry is corrupt and governed by a bunch of imbecilic old men. Who will see to it that all those linked to the dark lord are ak’d where they stand. Or chuck us Azkaban with the key to our cells tied to a rock and dropped to the middle of the sea. I for one do not intend to live my life behind bars!” She explained.
Bothe men looked at him in horror, at the flawless spellwork.
‘You never lost him.’ He lied. Making his way up the steps, embracing her. And planting a kiss on her cheek.
"Aurors. Please take Miss Parkinson to the holding cells, where she will await passage to Azkaban. Court dismissed." He commanded banging on his gabble, in closing.
She rolled her eyes, resting her knee on her leg. "Spare me the Gryffindor act Potter. It doesn't suit me. Sit there and tell me though, that Draco hasn't figured It out."
‘This morning Potter, pay attention. I was at Dawlish tent when I heard a row coming from inside, so naturally I listened’
‘That was a different hex. George was hit with a dark curse. I recognised this one. It will grow back Draco. It will!’ He tried to reassure him.
"Your daughters. How, where did you go yesterday. who did you see?"
‘I know.’ He replied with a wet kiss and well placed thrust into her warm heat. ‘Uhhh.’ She moaned in pleasure.
Draco stared at him, whisps of hair blowing in the controlled wind, nodding in silent agreement.
‘DRACO!!’ He screamed almost dropping the potions and towels.
‘Listen to her Mr Potter. You need to hear what she has to say.’ Dr dollie, chastised.
‘Do shut your mouth potter. We are not a toad.’ He chided, reaching across Harry for the salt.
Harry was simmering with rage. The effects of the draft wearing off. As if she hadn't done enough. This. This. He cant even say it was a new low. Because for her It wasn't.
That isn’t me he wanted to scream. why wasn’t he? He was t going to let her just get away with it. He was about to march over. when his hands were suddenly bound behind his back.
"How many times do I have to tell you. I'm. Not. Pansy!"
”Why must you train in the nude. Or at all, for that matter?” He questioned.
"She's a crazy pint. And war changes people. often times not for the better. If you tried to look for your friend in her now. I doubt you would find her."
“Last I checked Montey! Your orders were to take prisoner ¥€381 to see their visitor. And he is not a man to be kept waiting.” He growled. “Now off with you. Go torture some other sorry soul. While I clean this up. You know how he likes it. Clean.” With a growl, Rick stormed off, to go do whatever unspeakable thing struck his fancy.
Fuck! He hasn’t pitched the tent. He got up and sprinted outside to the backyard. Begging to cast protective charms around the perimeter of the yard.
"How. How do you know all this?" Harry asked, as he paced his cell.
And Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter, were officially dead.
She lifted Harry up against the wall, scratching up his back. where the holes in his prison garb lay. Harry struggled against her, as she whispers in his neck. "Insurance."
Draco deserved to be here he thought, not Harry, not the man he...
Though, it seemed time to break the news to him, on his tumor as he, oft called the rounded swell of Pansy's child.
Making her way over to him, she caressed his cheek, with unwavering confidence. "Oh I seriously doubt that."
The auror nodded somehow able to understand her.
It all began to play over in his head. everything Pansy had said. one word kept being repeated.
"What?" Harry shrugged back, discarding the garb completely. There was a cool air, which gave him goosebumps, making his brown nipples perk. It was down right sunny compared to most days on the rock of misery though.
"What would I have you do? Oh I don't know. TRY AND WAKE ME SO I COULD STILL HAVE MY DAUGHTER!"
She wouldn’t get away with this. She. Thought she could break him. Keep him quiet. He would show everyone the truth.
Harry now knew why he never spoke. his voice was higher then a five year old girls.
Again if there are any errors let me know and enjoy.
Ron nodded summoning a bottle of fire whiskey to the table, pouring them both a glass.
And oh the sounds Harry made when he came undone.
‘I’m a slytherin Potter. Of course I would.’ With a flick of Malfoy’s wand the lumos was gone and the tent was once again shrouded in darkness.
So they simply didn’t.
"When I was a kid. I wanted to be a dragon tamer. I begged and begged for Mother to take me to the dragon reserve. Father put a stop to that." Malfoy bowed his seemingly lost in the memory. Harry was reluctantly intrigued looking at him, as he lays down arms crossed over the matey blanket. "Nothing I did was ever good enough for Father."
Harry ears perked up at the name. How did she know he was with Draco.
‘Okay.’ Draco replied. His soft fingers continuing to trace patterns on Harry’s legs.
But what he discovered that day he would do it a thousand times over.
"But, I was not bowing down to your filthy mudblood, and blood traitor friends, no!"
The grey eyes piercing Harry’s. “Potter?” He said up at his bars now. “Where are you going?” He asked while his eyes screamed with knowing. “Visitor.” Harry replied. “Do you think..?” He trailed off.
"THEN DON'T PUSH!" He said sternly.
Staring down at the beautiful mess he’d made of Draco.
Harry shot Malfoy a hesitant look, doing what the man said. Harry was unsure if he should trust the man, but if he helped him through this then what would be the harm.
Prison without Draco, was lonelier than Harry thought it would be.
Harry glanced up to see Malfoy enter his tent, flicking a quick lumos over his work bench as he did so. With a nod he once again found his attention drawn back to his work.
"What Do you care?" He said monotonously. "Your the reason I'm even in this perdition."
"If Ronda hadn't placed the protection charm on you. I would beat you black and blue. As it is, I cant touch you. But don't think for a second. I wont be here the second that it does. The both of us."
“What did you do to me?” He whispered, at the mirror. Before looking up at her with unadulterated rage. Rising to his feet. Not his feet though were they. “WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO!” He screamed. Throwing the mirror just a center meter from his impostors face.
"Yes. well it seems, that the mother of the guard Is on the comity, and pertaining to bail you cant have a hung vote of release. And well...looks like you'll be serving another two years sentence."
I run the Daily Prophet for merlins sake. I can tell when someone is hiding something from me. And Harry..... he’s hiding something.’
Grabbing his hand he led him to their room.
James fiddled with his sandwich for a second, before jumping up and grabbing his jacket from the hallway hooks, near the front door.
He did know. But there was one thing she did have a right to know. Something he couldn’t hide from her.
“Then where would we be.” Harry quipped. “Come.” He repeated. And again he was on his way to the private unguarded room that only he was privy to.
"Have you ever loved something so much, that if they were taken from you. Your life just wouldn't be worth living?"
‘I know that. But to everyone else its a symbol that I could turn on them at any second. I loved our platoon, I was friends with most everyone int it. But they would star, I saw in there eyes, “can I trust him”.’
She pulled a heavy looking envelope from the expensive silver lined robes,looking bored. Placing it on the rusty, yet sturdy table top.
‘I’m sorry. If I don’t clean it, it will grow back infected.’
They lined the hall from left to right. each one they passed, filled with a pathetic looking witch or wizard. Caked in blood and dirt. Some talking to themselves others sleeping, but all looking half mad and one step away from death.
The most prominent. The snow covered tent that sat before him. Well the biggest problem, besides that fact that the two had been apart for three years, presumed died for one.
‘About this.’ He answered, rubbing his good arm across Harry’s legs, where they wrapped around him.
‘That’s. well its a long story, and i would really rather tell everyone together, than have to repeat myself.’ He explained.
"Yes. Potter! That's exactly what happened. One night in fifth year, Pansy made me swear off woman. because she was such a dismal lover." Each word dripping with Sarcasm. "Seriously, Potter! I realized i was  a flaming shirt-lifter, when I had my first wet dream! How you manged to stay alive long enough to defeat a dark lord. Is beyond me." He rolled his eyes in exasperation. Before again, realizing what he had unwittingly let slip.
Draco had eyes closed when Harry came back.
"Ame n wan." The Scary old witch ordered. Harry looked at her in confusion. "What?" he asked, dumbfounded as to what she'd said.
"FUCK!" He gasped, breathless. Tears prickled his eyes as he stared at the brave man.
He looked at the little squishy red baby. A tiny human. She was covered in goo and blood, black curls on top of her head, and a powerful set of lungs, that didn't stop till he laid her on his naked chest, halfway through pushing he'd had enough of the shift and threw it off.  The little girl rooted around as clasped onto his tit.
Donaldson was nowhere to be seen.
"I know you will." He smiled sadly.
He then proceeded to tell his school nemesis all that transpired after the battle. Excluding some parts. Not even he wanted to remember that.
"Your joking! The floor is fucking filthy!" he exclaimed. Nose scrunching in disgust.
Malfoy scowled. "I'm just trying to help."
With determination and that Gryffindor fire that still burned. No matter how low the flames got. He stared her down. "I will one day. And it will make killing voldemort look like child's play."
"You're fucking naked! For Salazars sake. Now put those pathetic excuse for cloths, back on before you catch hypothermia. At least delay it for a couple months anyway." Malfoy exclaimed, hands covering his eyes now.
As Harry cast protection charms around the tent he was glad he had placed in his pouch. Malfoy trailing behind Harry, placing a ring of potions around the protection charms for added measure, before the two retreated inside.
‘I just. Diagon, she’s to blame for it. The platoon, the war. Everything. What was the motive, why all this death. Destruction. Why even bring the Norwegians into it all.’ He pondered.
He shook his head and headed back onto his lumpy ‘mattress’, laying down and staring at the ceiling, tracing the crack that split through it, with his eyes.
Though just because, Harry wasn't speaking to Malfoy didn't mean that the ponce wasn't trying to speak to him.
‘What?’ He repeated.
‘Is he prone to fit’s, I had a cousin once, she couldn’t touch a pillywig without convulsing.’ Luna’s, sweet airy voice travelled through the open stained glass.
"But you've made a mistake. Don't trust Harry Potter. He's not who you think he is. It's the real Parkinson. Why-Why wont you believe me." He continued to plead, despite the threats to his person. Tristyn had stopped listening though and took off his shackles.
"Do as I asked." The man replied sternly.
‘Frankly, I am amazed you went this long. Ive heard stories about what happens in the field. I get it. I’m not happy about it. In fact I’m furious, but I do get it. Just as long as your ember you are still married to my sister. You may be legally dead but you are still magically bound to her, through marriage.’
Harry thrust with abandon, eyes closed and head bent into Ginny’s neck.
‘It’s rather dull, isn’t it.’ Draco commented. The wind whipping his hair all over the place.
It was the woman’s turn to laugh now. “Like we would be foolish enough all death eaters were given An antidote to the serums power by Severus Snape. It was one of the ways they infiltrated the ministry. So if you want to prove yourself tell us something only Weasley and Granger would know about.” She ordered.
A ringing permeated the awkward silence, Donaldson phone, going off. He gave a quick apology to Harry before answering it.
Ginny would make one for him every morning and afternoon, before and after work.
‘Well then. I better go get that ogdens I’ve been saving for this exact moment.’ Draco beamed heading off to wherever he had hidden the expensive bottle of alcohol.
Ron laughed, hitting his head lightly. ‘No, you great tit. No come on mum will have my head if I don’t help with the dishes.’
Another laugh left his/her throat. He didn’t know how to differentiate between them. It would be easier to just say her even though she was in his body. It was still Pansy in there.
Malfoy caught it with long since used, seeker reflexes. "Why?"
That time was different. They were different. Neither of them wanting it to end.
The moonless night turning the stained glass windows dark. Ginny had insisted on them when the two of them had begun the gargantuan mission of  turning Grimuald into something even close to liveable.
He didn’t know how long he stayed there like that. Numb to the world around him. Till he was pulled from his stupor when the sound of footsteps echoing down the corridor, looking up he found the familiar figure of Pansy Parkinson.
"Are you telling me that Pansy made you gay? That bad was she." Harry tried to joke. But bile began to rise in his throat, at the thought of Parkinson sleeping with anyone after. Well after what...
"You need to go to medi." He pointed at his hand. Draco looked down at it and shrugged. A filthy habit, he called it. one he had picked up from Harry. "I've had worse." He replied.
The moon, the yard it seemed quite inviting, in the peaceful quite of the night.
“No! You’ve made a mistake. I’m not Pansy. I’m Harry Potter. She switched our bodies.” He pleaded.
Harry took a deep breath. closed his eyes, and began to remove his robes.
Ginny gave Harry a wicked grin, before planting on on him, making him squeak in surprise.
‘Your still up.’ Harry pointed out, tapping his wand on the map in front of him, lighting up all the hidden areas the battlefield held.
TRIGGER WARNING! I REPEAT TRIGGER WARNING!
His throat hurt, and tears clung to the sides of his eyes, his mouth also tasted awful, once it had stoped spewing up his lunch.
Another round of silence passed.
‘End it now. Harry.’ He ordered making to leave.
"Then. I will deal with it when it comes. I wont always have you around to save me Malfoy. I have been alone most of my life."
‘You rely on politics to much, oh Member of the wizard gamot.’ Harry smirked, returning his shove.
What little he had done, all seemed for nothing now with the passing of Pansy sentence.
“You do the same thing!” He argued. Pushing himself of the ground, and heading to the toilet/sink, where he began to wash himself with the less than desirable drinking water.
She was the first on they had lost.
The sound of the forest filtering in as the charm fell on the clearing. Neither knowing what to say. What does one say in a moment like this.
I have no excuses. Though I suggest reading the previous chapter again so you can catch yourself up.
owners. A large pile appears in front of Harry, and those he sat with. Harry looked over at Draco just in time to see him place a neat pile of envelopes inside his neatly pressed uniform, close to his heart.
‘Uh, she’s doing well as can be expected. What with Xenophilius passing in Diagon that um... yeah we actually see quite a bit of her, none that her and mum are work partners and... Lily’sdatingthetwins.’ He rushed.
Harry dared not hope. As he looked upon the gamonts dower faces. "Due to the disbanding and eradication, of the dementors. The accused will not. Be receiving the kiss."
Anyway hope you enjoy
Harry lent back on auto pilot resting his head against Draco’s chest, as Draco began to pour the water over Harrys hair and body, washing and rinsing and ridding him of the sweat and blood that still clung to him, the dirt that stained his beard.
He turned to find two Aurors, red robes fanning out behind them. One had a scar across his face and the other had her wand pointed at him.
"Forget I said anything." He tried to back paddle.
Why did they need to but into his private life. You didn’t see him asking George why he and Angelina where no longer married. Or when Percy sorry Pula had transitioned. Harry let them be because it was their lives he needn’t interfere. They didn’t seem to get the message though where he and Gin were concerned.
and someone on the inside working for the Norwegians. Someone on the gamot, it all goes back to them Ron.’ Harry revealed.
short chapter but you need fillers.
As the rest of the platoon made their way in for the debriefing, Harry made his way out to find Draco.
Harry hated to think what he'd be like after a year. Let alone fifteen. But the plus side was at least there weren't any dementors.
‘Git!’ Draco sneered.
"However." Kingsley began again. "We can not allow the accused crimes to go unpunished." A round of 'hear, hear' was heard. "Pansy Parkinson. You, are sentenced. To life! In Azkaban. Pending a retrial for early release, if warranted. In Fifteen years."
‘So..’ Ginny broke the silence. ‘How does this work?’ She wondered, leaning forward on the couch they shared.
He was a horrid man. Who despite his looks was just as bad as Rick, and the other horrid workers in this hell hole. But. He was helpful when you need something. If one was willing to pay the price.
The world going black for the second time.
"Well. Imagine, it was your first time. And it was your own body, violating you."
Draco was actually stumped at Potters wit. More and more he had these moments of unfounded brains. These moments though seemed to be over shadowed by his equal lack of brains
Draco felt his throat close up and his head shake, trying to physically remove the image from his mind.
Pansy never came without purpose, it was one of the many things he had learned about her in his fifteen years at Azkaban.
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy startled at his words. He didn't like where this was going, nor did he like to put into words what happened to him, nearly every month.
‘I’m sorry. You stay. I’ll go the spare.’ Placing a kiss on Ginny’s forehead as he grabbed his pillows.
They fell asleep like that Draco still deep inside Harry.
leaning on the table in mock concern, she coked her head in confusion. "I thought you'd want to know darling. Aren't you proud?”
Pulling his arms back in to inspect them. "Can you break a charm, without actually having to be there?"
"I. Said. Strip! Or I'll do it for you." He sneard pulling Harry hair back roughly by the nape. causing him to let out a whimper. It seemed pansy body was not used to pain. How shocking He thought.
"Thank you Harry. I. I know its not, easy on you when you want to know about -"
‘Don’t move Malfoy. Just. Just stay there I’ll go get some potions.’ Harry struggled to get out, adrenaline and panic coursing through him.
He didn't slip again after that. But Malfoy no longer went in one ear and out the other. Day after day the new cycle continued. Breakfast a history fact, lunch a random fact that only Malfoy would know. And Dinner. Well, dinner was Harry's favorite.
The memory gain came unbidden to his mind. “Run away with me.” He took Ginnys arms and warped them more firmly around him.
‘Mmmm’
Harry played with Draco’s hair for what felt like hours, the water grown dirty with the filth of the day before, the two of them both pruney, but harry still didn’t want to get out, it was to much because once he got out of the tub that meant dealing and Harry would really rather not.
Harry glared at them. steeling himself for what he was about to do. Then attempted to take off the idiotic contraption woman call a bra. stumbling with the hooks on the infernal thing, he finally manged to get it off, and with a fortifying breath, let it fall to the floor.
‘Luna!’ His wife’s exasperated voice to came travelling out the window. As he sat bellow it.
The Grifyndor side of him felt the need to go towards the ever growing sounds of what was most definitely a couple, in the throws of, he didn’t want to know what. The other rational side of him told him to stop trying to ruin whoever was having a wonderful snog, and to go inside and fix things with his wife so he might have that with her again.
James grin grew. ‘Thanks dad. Mum and gran weren’t receptive to the idea. Said I was wasting my potential.’ He scoffed.
Harry became pliant then, he didn't know why he still fought her. He knew how these meetings always ended.
‘Why draw me into this then. What does that accomplish.’ Ron questioned, brows furrowed, ears red.
"I couldn't sleep last night." Harry said.
Across the way, the blond in his cell, shed a silent tear.
"Oh please, as if the saviour of the wizarding world would hurt his precious daughter. No. Not to worry, your little half blood is safe."
Soren rose an eyebrow. “Is that a threat.” He pondered. “A warning.” He stated. Soren smirked. “Come. Best not keep him waiting. I could lose my job.”
‘As was I.’ Draco retorted. ‘As was my mother.’
“I’m always carful” Harry joked.
Harry rolled his eyes, to the sound of "the boy has such a soft heart." and "wants to see the best in every one." meanwhile the real Harry felt like throwing up again.
"Up." Rick spat. "Ronda will have our guts for a trophy if we took her down." he whined.
Turning over to get a glimpse of that freckled face. He used to know everything about that face. But like most everything since he left, it was subject to change.
With a howl of exhaustion, Draco pulled him up. His hair coming lose from the harsh winds as Harry made his way back up on solid ground. The two hugging each other close and breathing heavily in each other’s grasp.
Whispering a croaky “why.”
So a hobby it remained.
The bottle fell from Ginny’s grip. Harry catching it with a prompt flick of his wrist, the bottle floating back into the fridge.
Harry avoided looking, his attention captured by a falling fleck of paint, drifting softly to the floor. The hand on his stomach, and the sound of his voice talking to it, a mumbled sound that was just out of reach. There went another fleck.
With that sound, Harry made a howling scream, the noise of it vibrating through the block.
He looks on with a smile. He and Draco once went to a fair like this. They couldn’t enjoy it though, as they were on the hunt. But he remembers Draco commenting on the fact, he’d never been on a Ferris wheel. Harry hadn’t either, growing up with the Dursley’s only Dudley was taken to fairs.
"Potter. Potter. Harry!" Malfoy bellowed. Harry stopped, but didn't turn, his voice was like daggers when he spoke.
"Well, I suspect... What have you done to them!"
The screams rang in both men’s ears, throughout the silence of the battle ground.
To the uproar of the crowed, Harry sagged in relief.
"Where are we going? I..I thought, you said I had a visitor?" Harry, braved asking.
Rick sneered from his post at the bars.
‘Ugh.’ S..sorry.’ He moaned wiping at his mouth.
"What if you.."
"Strip." Rick ordered. Letting go of him with a push. Harry stared at the guards in horror. "W-what?" he spluttered.
Harry had complete faith in Draco no matter the outcome of today, Harry just knew Draco could get them out of this, beside's Herm.... Well he was the smartest person he knew. He was also the only person Harry trusted. But He also knew that Draco knew all this. It wasn't the plan Draco had doubts over.
But it seemed he could not avoid the verbal fights he was getting into with Gin, of late.
It was worse than the first time, somehow. Like he had given up, actually consented to what she was putting him through. He planned to just lay there and let her do what she wanted, that was until she pulled at his hair and snarled in his ear.
Draco, had woken up. Harry could hear him as he tried to push the guard off.
Pansy simply gave him a scathing look, in answer. As if he were an impossible child that needed the sense knocked into him.
"Twats aren't for me. But that Ass. If only she had a cock." Rick stated. A hand flew to Harry mouth, the need to spew returning.
He was just about to enter his old office when the sound of the floo flaring to life, filled his ears. Heals sounded on them hardwood floors, and the clinking of glasses being moved about drew Harry down the stairs.
‘The moment we apperate do not leave my side. Not once. I know the land I’ve studied every knook and crevice, I know where trip foundations may be set, so your potions can be placed. They will have the advantage hav.....’ Harry stoped abruptly.
The sound unlocked something in Harry. It was if he was being transported back, to two months ago. He covered his ears and closed his eyes. As if that would stop the pictures running through his head.
A glint lit up Draco’s eyes as he took the proffered hand. ‘I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself thanks.’ He smirked.
‘I hope you both know that you are idiotic and foolish and I wont be at either of your funerals.’ Draco scowled.
Harry held him closer. Because he knew if his father had come back from the dead. He knew he’d never let him go.
"I'm scared of peacocks." Malfoy stated, from his place laid out on the cool floor.
‘So. Um. I. I. Guess, guess this is goodbye.’ Harry stuttered.
It was peaceful here.
"Hold this. You whore!" Rick sneered. Shoving a plank with numbers and rune on it, under which had the name Pansy Parkinson.
‘S’not your fault. The target was trained in the specialist dark arts squadron. You had no choice.’ He said, snuggling closer into Harrys warm skin.
Rising from his knees he guided a pliant potter over to the arm of the lounge, turning him around so his naked arse was on show and limp member between his legs, Draco’s member twitched in anticipation at the sight, as he freed it from the confines of his pants.
“Would it no be more prudent to exercise your magic instead of my ex-best friends body.”
"Calm your Threastels Potter. I Haven't done anything....To them at least." She smirked. Harry cocked his head in concern and confusion. "Potter, that look relay does nothing for my face. You'll give me wrinkles." she motioned at his forehead.
‘You said we wouldn’t talk about it.’
He was one of those silent types. That Harry had neglected to catch the name of. Who gives a shit about an aurors name, he thought. When your being sent to Azkaban.
Time skips and smut I what your in for this chap, also I feel like my reason for the war is lame I honestly couldn’t think of any other reason for it.
‘Donaldson!’ Harry beamed, embracing him. Pulling back to get a look at him, he couldn’t keep the grin off his face. He was alive, he was... a widower.
"Clear-ish?"
Harry scoffed.
Harry looked at his child then back at Malfoy. "No..... She's mine."
From deep within Bayard cell, he called out. "Your luck will run out Potter."
Her eyes zeroed in on him with a malicious glint. Her voice hard and venomous. “Oh I think you’ll find you will. I really, really do.” With that she ripped of his newly acquired skirt. Roughly shoving and turning him around so he was bending over on the wall to his will. “What? What are you doing? He checked out in fear finding his hands bound to the wall. At an odd angle, his legs being kicked out wide.
Tonight though....
"How..How long, have you been here Malfoy?" Harry asked, turning onto his side.
Those brown eyes of his son looked over him more closely. Before grabbing his father into a hug. ‘DAD!’
Malfoy gave him a strained smile, looking upon the scrunched face red little witch.
‘I’m alive.’ Harry, had a feeling he would be saying that for a good while.
Harry joined him, mimicking his stance.
Rang through the silent court room.
An evil glint filled the wardens eyes. “Then you’d best hope, I don’t join yours.” He smirked. Nose to nose with him. So close harry could feel his breath on his skin. “I believe, it is you who should hope you don’t join mine. Need I remind you about the last man who tried that.”
"Then stop trying to attract doxies." He snapped.
She glared at him. As she clutched the strange object harder. Seeming to grow impatient with him. Harry took a steely breath. “I just wanted to say.... I forgive you for what you did. I know what it’s like to have Voldemort.” She flinched. “In your head, so I don’t blame you for wanting to protect yourself.” He finally managed to get out, if a bit awkwardly.
Harry could still feel the presence of the dementours in every fiber of his being, and they weren't even in the cells yet. A shiver ran through him at the thought, of spending the next fifteen years here. In a Cramped cell. the remnants of dementours staining the foundations. He wondered how he would last. Having spent the better parts of his childhood in a cupboard under the stairs. It was any wonder he had developed a rather intense case of claustrophobia.
Harry shot him a glare, as Draco gave the universal sign for surrender, plowing on anyway.
Harry shrugged. "I don't know? I think, I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time."
‘What gave you that impression.’ Ron asked taking a swig from his glass.
‘Sorry about that.’
‘Like I don’t know that Ron.’ Harry chided.
His kids were ecstatic to have him home, and they seemed to be one of the few things that gave him any joy of late, but they were grown now. They didn’t need their dad much anymore. They had learned to live without him.
‘Come here Potter’ Draco commanded gently.
As he neared the park he could hear the sound of laughter and music emanating from within.
The old crone looked down at him for a minute. Smudged glasses slipping down her pointy nose. Then let out a maniacal cackle. The auror joining in, shocking Harry when he spoke.
"They ent an'ther un en." She groans. Her speech coming out slurred and undefinable, through the witches missing teeth. "an other 'ure blud en?"
‘Two more targets and you will have your answer. The Norwegians were jut pawns in her game, but from what I’ve gathered..’ Harry paused, looking over his shoulder the sound of the water running having stoped.
So Harry did as Malfoy asked. Playing with his apple for about half an hour, throwing it up in the air, and catching it, as he lay on his bed. Staring up at the cracked ceiling as he did so. It had started to rain again. So as it often did, the ceiling began to leak.
Draco suddenly less blissed out than he was a moment ago, his face flashing with alarm for a millisecond. Before a cool act of composure replaced it. With no shame at all he rose from the pillows, starkers as the day he was born and headed to the bath.
‘Really?’
And before he knew what had happened. She’d yanked his hand towards her and cast a cutting hex on his hand, then her own. Clasping there bloody hands together and placing them on the strange object. Beginning to chant an unknown spell he had never heard before. A flash of bright white light escaping from it.
Harry stoped listening. He knew all this, and contrary to what Ginny thought, he had been to a healer. He left not two minutes after the session started.
‘GO GET FARMON.’ He yelled back up, over the howling wind.
‘So, what time does your mother get home?’ Harry scratched the back of his head staring down at the sandwich James made them.
Rick smirked, lowering his bat. "You know we aren't allowed to have our wands outside the staff room. New ministry orders." placing his thumb on the lock of Harry cuffs. The metal falling to the floor with a clang!
Still It came as a surprise. Parkinson had mentioned something about a new Minister, Harry doubted they weren’t under her thumb.
‘I said I would.’ Harry said sounding miffed.
Harry had Draco by the French braid, as he fucked draco at a tortures pace.
The fucking.
So after learning it back to front, Harry moved on to muggle and Wizarding maps of the British isles, it only grew from there. Hermione often told him he should study geography at uni but he found when forced to do anything he quite lost interest in it.
She captured her lips in his. Before pulling back for air, whispering breathlessly in his ear.
Greeny, looked around them suspiciously, before squeaking out. ‘He got dispatched.’
‘Harry!’ He heard his name being called, concern lacing every syllable.
Enjoy lovely's :)
"Why come at all? It's been..." How long had it been? He just assumed the days but in actuality he had no clue. "Why, now?"
Draco's expression didn't look promising, and nor was what Bayard had to say next.
Harry shrugged, wondering back to his bed. "Think of it, as a peace offering."
“So..I...err..I just wanted.” He babbled as he rubbed the back of his neck uncomfortably, lost for words, why the hell did he try and talk to her again? “I just.”
‘I thought you were dead! When I heard where we were going and the platoon that...’ he pulled back getting a good look at Harry, before hugging him again. ‘Thank Merlin your alive.’
"I was wondering when you'd crack." He supplied unhelpfully from his perch, laying across his bed. "I Have to say, I'm impressed. I only lasted two weeks before I cracked. But four months." He whistled. "I think that you broke the record."
He was shoved again when he denied, giving an answer, to the intelligible question. The two of them stared him down before the witch, reiterated in disdain "Name!"
As predicted. Malfoy spent the night tossing and turning, sweating and moaning. Harry was with him through it all, cleaning the sheets when needed. Administering pain relieving potions, and holding him tight when he cried.
Draco found himself at the toilet expelling his recently eaten slop, as a humorless chuckle reached his ears, as he continued to hurl.
‘Malfoy. I want you to do something for me on this mission. And I need you not to ask me why.’ He requested leaving no room for argument.
Malfoy was beside himself. ‘Potter. Don’t be stupid you will never survive a vow like that. There are to many uncertainties. You’ll die!’ Draco pleaded.
‘We never talk about it.’ He croaked.
And with a cock of her eyebrow and the scrap of Harry’s fork across his plate, that was that.
"Im..." Draco tried to apologize.
Two measly weeks. That’s all.
"What?" Harry asked, eyes, on the strange man.
Once she had finished, she wrapped the child in her arms.  Heading out the cell, guards following close behind. and for once closing the cell doors quietly.
‘Well I think that’s brilliant James.’ He reached over grasping his hand. ‘truly.’
There, she sat. Or rather, he sat.
"I don't know why you spend money on those whores. when you've got your pick of the prisoners." Rick, took hold of Harry arm leading him over to the shower, and chaining him to the wall. with the rusty shackles that lay there. Harry felt as if he was going to hyperventilate. chained to a wall naked, with a  man who just admitted to raping the prisoners. He was amazed he was still standing.
"Oh, for Salazars sake." Harry heard Pansy groan in annoyance, harry's voice coming out of her. It was disconcerting and did nothing to help his current state. Leaning on the wall for support now.
"I know you don't want to. But it will make it easier." Was the scratchy reply.
"Whats the point? YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE. THE GOLDEN BOY. YOU ARE HARRY FUCKING POTTER!!! THE POINT. THE POINT IS TO LIVE. TO FIGHT. YOU DON'T JUST GIVE UP. THAT IS NOT HOW HARRY POTTER LEAVES THIS WORLD. HARRY POTTER, LEAVES THIS WORLD OLD AND BEARDED SAVING A BABY FROM A..."
The smell of vomit, along with the taste.
Unwittingly his scared hands wrapped themselves around the pouch that still hung around his neck. The one that housed that Merlin awful, musty, smelly, wonderful tent.
‘I’m sorry Ginny. I know I promised. But I cant.’ He shot up, dashing out the door. Ginny’s cries of ‘Harry!’ Following him.
Harry meanwhile, felt his heart stop. And the violent need to throw up.
With a huff he turned over, and over and over. Until admitting defeat and heading for the kitchen.
‘Well I’m glad they didn’t.’ Harry shot back looking into his beautiful grey eyes. Without hesitation he reached over to Draco’s left arm, intwining their fingers. ‘To me it shows you made a mistake. You had a past, but your future isn’t that mark Draco. You are not that mark.’
‘That’s quit al..... Harry!’
‘He’s not a death eater!’ Harry whispered angrily, so as not to alert those arriving in the mess for their secondary debriefing.
It was a mundane and relentless cycle. Get up, eat his morning slop. His lunch slop would appear and his would listen to the groans and moans in the other cells, then he would eat his dinner slop and go to bed.
Draco however had no such qualms, releasing himself from his grasp, stepping out on the tub dick hard and summing a towel, which soon found itself around his waist. Another towel flew into his hands, standing in front of harry he spread out the towel for him to climb into.
The day started like any other. Breakfast slop arrived, today it was served with a slice of stale bread. This promoted Malfoy to say. "Did you know. In medieval times, because some peasant crops weren't ready, they used old rye to make bread, often times it was infected with a fungus called ergot. And caused Hallucinations and death."
“Teaching.” Was Ricks reply. Still pressing Harry’s face into the wall. Soren, pulled out his wand, placing it at Ricks neck. Making the fat fuck, who never stopped reminding him of Dudley, to step back. Arms up in surrender. Finally allowing Harry to breath properly, coughing up the blood, that had been filling his mouth.
Draco looked on in sadness, Harry didn't deserve this. He was supposed to be free. Marry the weslette, become an auror and spend the rest of his years with a horde of ginger children, not wasting away in prison, longing for a child he didn't even get to name, in a woman's body slowly turning mad from PTSD.
"I wouldn't go around taunting ministry workers, Malfoy. We aren't the ones stuck behind bars, for the forceable future." Rick snarled, as Thatch dragged Harry out the cell.
"How, do you know?" Harry shot back. As he tried to get comfortable on his rickety bed. With a piss poor excuse for a mattress and blanket.
Harry didn’t know what to do.
Greenwitch let out a breath seeming to struggle to find the right words.
Since his mothers ban. Harry always used it for him. Unless he needed to know...
"No! No! I don't belong in here! You have the wrong person!." He protested.
‘Look dad, I don’t mean to be rude or anything. But. You haven’t really got any business coming back after three years, and have any say on how we are living. Because up until an hour ago we though you were dead!’ James scolded.
The rain continued to slide down the charms as Draco shrunk and uncharmed tents, while Harry trailed beside him.
They were the ones Harry waited for. It took a month in this fashion before Harry couldn't stay mad at Malfoy anymore. And if he was truly honest he never was. Malfoy was there so he could direct his anger at him. It's what he'd done at school, when the real person he was angry with was himself.
"Your the reason he's in here. Aren't you?" He stated accusingly.
"Then how? How! Could you not tell me, that they were taking her. How?" Harry Cracked. Emotion finally showing on his face.
"Malfoy!"
Harry's anger was foreshadowed somewhat, by the pure relief of hearing about his friends. He hadn't seen or heard from them in three years, another of Pansy's brilliant plans, A spell that fooled he friends into believing that pansy was him, personality and all.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘HARRY!’ A weight plowed into Harry, as he was assaulted with a sea of red hair.
"Yeah. I did that to, after it happened. That was the first time, I wished that Voldemort had actually killed me. But. I thought the same way you are now. I'm Harry Potter. Voldemort was died, I wasn't, though I thought I would be. My Parents sacrificed their lives for me, so many countless others, had lost their lives. For me. I couldn't just, give up. But then I got thrown into Azkaban, and a month ago discovered that the Bitch who raped me, made sure I would never forget it. Made sure that she had leverage over me." He paused another of those humorless laughs escaping him.
As he walked past Malfoy cell, who was paying him no mind, staring at the ceiling. (He had been visited again, last night.) Harry began to wonder, who had come to visit him? Who had come to this hell hole to see him. Had one of his friends finally seen through Pansy's lie? Was it Hermione or Ron. Maybe even ... Ginny. Or he could just be getting his hopes up, and it was just one of Parkinson's friends or family.
"Well. Can you distract me with actual, helpful facts." He groaned. Gripping the tattered linen, "instead of anecdotes from ancient Greece."
She came with a high pitched squeal. An odd sound to the low groans he had become accustomed to.
‘What did Dawlish say, when you told him this.’
"Better?" His face smirked back at him. Harry scowled, before hesitantly making his way to one of the rickety upholstered chairs in the room, he found himself having difficulty standing to long these days.
While reprimanded in their custody, he had made it his mission to tell all those, he came across, who he was. unfortunately it had the undesired affect of making everyone believe him to be mad. Or rather Pansy was mad. It also didn't help that the Pugs nasty little spell, had rendered him mute, when trying to prove who he was to the odd soul who would listen.
I couldn’t have planned it better myself. You could almost call it dramatic irony. Though you are to..what was it Draco used to say? Filled with fire. I believe I have to take measures to assure your compliance.” She smirked.
The fight left Harry.
‘Oh please. Don’t stop on my account.’
"Oh. Potter. you know that's not how these meetings of ours go." she laughed. "It amuses me, you think you can get out of this so easily."
Harry grinned. ‘Luna! Wow, now there’s a name I haven’t heard since before the war. How’s she doing?’
‘I’ve got to pitch the tent.’ Was his simple reply.
Malfoy however wasn't listening. He was more interested in Harry's, or Pansy's stomach. It looked, well it looked like...
Just before morning the two woke frotting against each other hands intwined.
Silence fell between them.
"Stand there." he pointed. to a blank looking wall. "Adam!" Tristyn called, and a skinny bloke entered to room.
With a crack! Harry was gone.
Suddenly a potion was unsanctimoniously shoved down his throat. Harry spluttered, looking up at his own face in anger, furry and though he loathed to admit it, frightened. Until the calming drought took effect.
Harry watching him depart, turning back to Ron once he was out of sight.
He stood rather awkwardly as he tried, and failed not to listen in on the conversation. So he looked at the busy, muggles catching cabs and dodging lorries, as they crossed roads, and entered shops.
"Are you having a contraction?" The scratchy voice asked.
James inventions, Albus art, hanging on most walls. And Lily’s numerous hobbies could be found in near on every room.
"You wouldn't." He spat, the look she gave him, said otherwise. "Of course you would. What have you done to her."
‘Yes, James. I will be here when you get back.’ James turned back and gave him one last hug, before closing the door behind him.
Harry couldn’t watch. So he’d left the great hall, and Ginny and Ron, to mourn their loss. He to was grieving. But both he and Hermione thought it best to leave the family. Hermione went to tend the wounded. While Harry found him self at a loss.
On to the slimy floor. Splashing on the wall, slowly helping the growing moss and mold, that resided there. He could count the days with it he stared at it’s slowly growing form that much. Sometimes he swore he saw it move. Though perhaps he had finally gone round the bend.
"Get in." Tristyn bellowed. Before forcefully pushing his stubborn body in there.
His eyes looked up in an instant. Harry knew that voice. he could be in a crowded room and still know that voice. Because there, across the small expanse of hall. In all his pureblooded pratiness. A former shell of himself was:
A condescending laughed boomed through the room. Harry hated that his voice could sound that way. "Perdition! You've been spending to much time with Draco."
"What's the point." Harry croaked, to Malfoy surprise.
With a heavy heart Malfoy told him of the events that unfolded.
Thirty minutes later, harry found himself outside under the glow of the stars. Running away from his wife, and Hermione. And basically anyone who thought it was a brilliant idea to talk about his and Ginny’s failing marriage.
Finally. Harry thought.
without the constant conversation with Malfoy. Prison was well boring. Despite this rather depressing drawback one of many in Azkaban. Harry still had to get up least he waste away and let pansy win. It seemed the only thing keeping him going was pure spite, he tried to find hope at seeing his daughter as motivation, and it was slightly. But in a prison built to crush that out of you, spite was the only thing actually keeping him going.
‘And then I took over the prophet and merged it with the quibbler. Luna well lets just say she copes with the loss in a different way.’
‘Nonsense James! Fred and George got told that by Molly, more then once and look what they made for themselves. The Weasley name will be remembered for years to come because of them. This is in your blood. On both sides actually. And not to brag or anything but I was actually their first investor.’ Harry beamed.
“I don’t know.” He whispered back, eyes downcast. Not allowing himself to hope. Though wishing he could take Draco’s hand in his own. Draco had the same idea. Pushing his luck and trailing his thumb, down Harry’s cheek. Harry relished in the quick touch. Before Rick, smashed down his bat on Draco hand. Harry thought he heard a crunch, before Draco pulled his hand back, cradling it to his chest.
Oh did he know how these meetings ended.
‘It’s this assignment. They want the whole platoon!’ Harry voiced, Draco running his fingers through his hair to loosen the remaining tied strands, as he listened to Harry intently.
"One day you will be here to." Draco snarled.
"Yes." He replied, after a rather long pause.
Malfoys face grew hard. "I don't believe I know what your talking about Potter." He stood abruptly. his tray clanging to the floor then disappearing with a pop!
"I'd like to leave now." he asked with as much calm as he could muster.
Then the guards would come.
Harry fumed at what she had done. She hand turned him into a woman. She had turned him. Into her.
Harry who had just had another visit from Parkinson was in no mood for Draco’s whining at present.
It was only after the noises stopped. And the bars clanked shut did sleep take him.
Screaming as a dry new area felt like it was getting ripped in two.
Harry deflated at the mention, of the disfigurement of Narcissa. The day the Norwegians attacked.
The fact still stood though. Draco was free. That meant Harry had to get things moving on the inside, while Draco tackled the outside.
“Potter you are practically ask.....”
‘What’s the problem Potter.’ Draco said, unbraiding his silver white hair, with long nimble fingers.
Ron and Draco gasped.
"explain it to me again." Draco ordered. One can never forget just how he was raised when he spoke like that. Harry hitting the back of his head against the wall in annoyance.
Harry stumbled and turned to face the door in annoyance.
"Parkinson." A surly guard called through the door,before swinging it open.
Ron frowned. ‘Need I remind you, that was your idea.’
‘Just when did you find out about Donaldson being up the duff?’ Harry ordered.
Harry looked up from his bowl. "I know her name."
‘I just don’t know what to do Luna!’ Harry heard Ginny attempt to whisper. ‘He sleeps out there most night’s. What am I saying, it’s every night. And he wont even let me anywhere near that tent of his. The last time I tried, he had a fit.’
‘Potter.’ Came the annoyed reply. ‘You’ve not come to talk me out of my orders again.’ Harry attempted to reply. But a hand full of scars halted him. ‘I’ve already had words with your lackey...’
He rested his head against the bars. Tears slipping from his eyes, as he whispered. "I'm Harry Potter." until it lost all meaning. Breaking down in heaving sobs.
The young boy couldn’t have been more than twelve his face screwed up in pain, as she tended to the stump that was his left leg. Harry had no doubt that skelegrow wouldn’t heal it.
Harry huffed, prompting Ginny to continue.
Malfoy turned to look at his dark mark. ‘They could have at least got the other arm.’
What was he hearing, Draco thought. This was Harry Potter he didn't just role over and die. He fought, he held on till the end he didn't just give up.
A voice in his head, tried to tell him, who he was. But that panic. It wouldn't let him go.
"Yes, well Potter that is generally what happens when one cant sleep." He scoffed, at Harry as if he was an idiot.
Assimilating back to ordinary life had not been an easy task, Harry had found.
That did wipe the smile from him face, and he soon found it in a nearby bin.
They lapsed into comfortable silence, until Draco spoke up again.
Searching the crowd for his friends he came up short, he was about to give up hope when he spotted Hermiones bushy hair kneeling next to a student.
Harry got up.
‘You wouldn’t.’ Harry chastised, watching as Draco made his way out the tent, the sound of the pouring rain filling the tent as Draco opened it.
In a flash Harry had summoned his fathers cloak, knocking himself and Malfoy to the ground and pulling the cloak over them. Just in time, as the protection charms fell. The rain came crashing down around them. And the enemy attacked.
‘Yeah.’ He replied. ‘It didn’t mean anything.’
‘I know what we would be putting them through. But what’s the alternative. Have them grow up believing they need to enlist in this war. I put an end to the first war so they would be free of this. I’m doing this for them.’ Harry sated passionately.
The two holding each other close. They had a lot to catch up on.
With a nod of agreement he left.
Why. Why was he always so difficult. A traitorous little voice, inside his head. Told him, he had done the same thing about Pansy. So why was it so odd for Malfoy to want to forget.
Condition?
The war is over.
Receiving a cold hearted, “insurance.”
Harry sent him a glare, before using the wall he rested on, to pull himself up. Blood trickling down his leg.
‘You almost missed mail.’ Greenwitch announced enthusiastically. He was a young boy of 20 who despite being in a war, hadn’t lost his appreciation for life. Harry quite liked him, he hoped once the war was over they wouldn’t loose touch.
They stood outside the door as Soren placed his hand on the lock, like a magical version of a thumb scanner. With a push he opened the door gesturing him to enter. When he hesitated Soren lost his patience and pushed him in.
He couldn't help but love her. As fucked up as that was,
Almost instantaneously Draco gasped. "Your rune is gone."
‘Please be there when I turn around.’ She pleaded. Spinning swiftly to face him. ‘Your alive!’ She gasped. Sprinting into his arms.
“Just. Be carful Potter.” He sighed.
"Pansy?" a voice seemed to call out, through the fog of despair.
The fight left him then. Pansy prattled on about silencing spells. And thinking things through unlike Gryffindors. But Harry didn’t hear it or at least wasn’t listening. Some words slipped through like another spell he hadn’t heard, and wondering what fucking with a cock would be like.
"Very." he smiled sadly.
His hands clutched his agonizing stomach. It had grown progressively worse, since his time with Pansy, he'd kept it quite while in her presence, but now in his solitary cell, he could no longer keep his anguish contained.
A groan sounded from Ginny.
Harry, watched as the water dropped from the cracked ceiling. One after the other, each little drop.
Draco pulled Harry towards him, their breath mingling. ‘We’ll do this together’ he assured him.
He was silent.
Harrys hands digging into the mess of Draco’s hair as he guided him back and forth. Not that Draco needed much guidance, in the half a year since they became A.K, Draco knew how to make Harry come undone with only his pure blooded tongue.
Harry couldn’t help but feel like, if only he’d defeated Voldemort sooner, there would be fewer loses. Would Fred still be alive? Remus? Tonks?
Harry sighed.
A fair.
‘How did you survive?’ James asked. Some time later. They two sitting across from each other in the kitchen, two cups of tea making themselves as they spoke.
"Don't try and avoid this Draco." he sighed, brown eyes crashing into grey. Draco stopped passing, heading to the bars resting his head on there rusty surface.
It was after one particularly gut wrenching fit, as Harry held him, the man high on pain relievers that Draco asked the forbidden question they had been avoiding for near on a year.
With a shaky breath he pushed himself up his or should he say her body felt strange. It was strange to walk and move. He felt his or again her boobs when he moved his arms, this strange weight Just pooped on his front.
on and on the cycle went.
‘Neither do I.’ Harry whispered softly.
Looking down at his... Well, Parkinson's boob's. They were always itchy, and aching. Usually he didn't pay them any mind. Which in hind site was kind of odd. But today, he thought they looked, well. Bigger.
"But, I thought.." Malfoy began voice wavering.
Life! Life!
”So.” He said rather bored. “What have you got for me today?”
Harry waved his hand, with a soundless spell, letting Ron in. As he sat on the edge of the tub, Ron opening the door and shutting it with a slam behind him, that made Harry’s head ache all the more.
‘Who’s it from?’ Gin asked, as some potato’s boiled themselves.
"Why. would you give me this?" He hissed. Through clenched teeth. Clutching the parchment so hard, he'd feard it ripped.
“Because”
“That’s all well and good Potter! But I wanted you dead.” She admitted. Chilling Harry to the bone. “I seriously doubt that the Aurors or the ministry will see it your way. Darling!” She said closing the space between them.
‘You gotta get going?’ Harry asked, Donaldson nodding.
Harry startled. before turning his back on him. walking back to his bed.
With that, Harry got into bed, drawing the dirty sheets over his naked form. Back to Malfoy and body aching for the child that was taken from him, not twelve hours after her birth.
Harry tried not to laugh, at the threat. what with that squeaky voice. He doubted the man would go through with it. But just to be on the safe side. Harry didn't push his luck. So he stayed quite, for the remainder of his check in, into the Hotel Del La Azkaban.
Draco glared at the guard, before letting his gaze drift to Harry. Harry mouthed a quick ‘I love you’, before Rick pushed him forward. Almost making him lose his balance. It was then Rick spotted the blood.
The daily Azkaban routine got a little more bearable, it didn't fix the ache in him entirely. But hey he wasn't getting up out of spite anymore. conversing with each other, at dinner sharing facts about each other, the one Harry could share, what with the curse. It helped him bit by bit each day.
‘Well, when you do let me know would you mate.’ Ron said resigned to the fact that he knew Harry wouldn’t tell him, as he made to get off the floor. ‘I’m here for you Harry. Always.’
"It's not Parkinson." Harry, grunted back. Swinging his feet onto the grubby floor.
Draco wanted to scream. But being a Malfoy he settled for a well placed scowl.
"We, the wizard gamont. Find you guilty, of the following war crime. Attempting to hand over the hero of the wizarding world, Harry Potter. And have sentenced you, to the kiss." Acting minister for magic kingsley Shacklebolt Announced to the chorus of enthusiastic cheers.
‘Potter.’ They chorused out of time.
After that all he remembered were flash’s of looking down on himself like it wasn’t happening to him but someone else.
Harry crossed his arms over his chest, leaning on the grimy wall, waiting for Parkinson to get on with her yearly tortures.
"Then you will be free. And out of this hollow. You are more use to me on the outside. And you know that." Harry Prompted, looking away from the paper in his hand, to one of the few people he would actually kill for.
Draco, was passing his cell in anticipation, his nerves frayed, and on edge. If it was possible for the two, to coincide. Harry watching on from across the way. To most Draco always seemed a man of stone. Harry knew different. One doesn't spend twenty two years with another person, without picking up on their entire being.
‘That’s not funny.’ Harry barked. Wrapping the stump just below Draco’s elbow, in a pain relieving paste. Harry noted his features relax almost immediately.
"Hey, Tristyn. You reckon we should get the newbies to take the mugshot's. Teach 'em the ropes." Rick, piped up a couple minutes into there walk down the whistling halls.
“Potter?” Parkinson replied. Looking wary. Her pug nose still looking down on him as if she was better. How she pulled of entitled, scared and oddly excited, baffled Harry.
‘You have no idea how infuriating that answer is to a reporter.’ She smirked.
"Are.. Are you telling me. Are you telling me tha-"
"I lied. Tell me why I would have told you. My school yard rival, that the night the finale battle ended, I went to go clear my head, and your who I assumed at the time, girlfriend stole my body, bound me. Then defiled me." Harry cut him off, emotionless. "Do you have any idea. What it was like to hear your own voice, whisper depraved words in your ear, as your body fucked you." he continued, all the while never turning to face Malfoy.
"Remember.." Harry tried to say, before the spell rendered him mute. He knew that Draco would know what he was about to say. He always knew.
‘Fuck it.’ Harry stated, turning back to Draco, and pushing him into the nearest tree, with a kiss.
‘Yes, sir.’ Harry spits, turning his back on the unlikable man.
enjoy loveys :)
‘She is still grieving so you better. And the kids. Actually Albus and......’
Dinner however was different. It was still a fact, but one about Malfoy.
The battle had ended and the Aurors, had descended, rounding up those who hadn’t fled. The ones that knew, the fight was over.
Ron didn’t need him to continue to know where he was going with this. ‘Why?’
hope you liked it loveys. let me know if you spot any mistakes. :)
Both turned to apparat to their respective families.
Harry shied away from the touch, feeling guilty and embarrassed. Is he okay? No not really. How do you tell someone that you saw their husband die in front of you.
‘I also don’t think, she believes that he his dead.’
Wasn't that the million Gallon question.
"I know but. Last night. I was awake." he prodded. giving Malfoy a look as if to say 'I was awake when the guard..'
The guards where soon at Draco cell. And took him away.
