“That’s what you want me to think, Dray. But I actually like the quiet here. And yes, I like the animals. But that’s not all.” He shrugged and they walked out of the cemetery, Draco once again seeing the squirrel.
A nosy squirrel climbed down half a tree and stopped, watching the intruders intently. The two men were just as quiet as the rest of the forest, so the animal decided to investigate further and as they walked around a corner, the squirrel followed them curiously.
“Eat, darling!”
“I can touch him! It’s like he’s real!” Harry said with excitement in his eyes.
Not even when they both had been at Hogwarts had he looked that relaxed, well… Every year, there had been something in the way of his happiness. Now was his third year and Draco knew they were already at the end of it. That was the only reason why they had gone to the Infirmary. Madam Pomfrey knew that at the end… the Dementors had messed with him.
Draco snorted. “I think I’ll join you with the ice cream.”
“I’ve actually never had something like that happening, that is certainly interesting.” Mirjam said and opened a folder she had just taken out of her briefcase.
Harry sighed. “I cannot see any more dead people. I’m empty inside, Ron. I need to... to travel! Meet new people, enjoy strange cultures, see the world!”
Ginny snorted. “You, Harry Potter, have always been under stress. Whenever we were at Hogwarts, there was always something coming after you and then, when this idiot is finally dead, you decide ‘you know what, I should do that as a living’. I have never ever seen you not stressed. Even now, it’s like you’re never relaxed, since you need to find the cure and everything.”
“Thank you, Auror Abram” Kingsley stopped him and he turned back to the group. “This is a very old spell, which is why you have been gathered here. Looking through the history of all you students gave us the student pool who has the interest and knowledge of performing such a spell.”
“Eric” Alamar had a hard time hiding his smirk, yet he still decided to repeat his question. “Love, what are you doing?”
“I highly doubt that! Draco’s not going to let that happen, right Dray?”
Harry wakes up in Russia after being freed by Eric and Alamar and explores his new life.
“Don’t worry, Harry, we’ll fix you right up.”
“Are you seriously dragging around Amortentia?” Harry asked, but couldn’t hide a smirk. “I thought you were desperate, but not
Smirking, Blaise pulled him into a hug and kissed his forehead. “I thought you said ‘no wedding vows’.”
There was a tense silence in the air. What could possibly have brought Pansy to this kind of chaotic idea? A Slytherin usually didn’t have the need to do something that was so much out of the normal area of what people usually did... Well, Draco finally figured it out. “Pansy, who told you about Potter’s injury parchment?” he quietly asked.
Harry was holding his stomach and seemed to be in a little pain. In fact, he was also sweating slightly and only after a few seconds, his body stopped being so tense. “I don’t know” Harry answered. “I just suddenly have such stomach pains. It’s weird. I didn’t even do anything.”
“Wait, really?” Hannah placed the knitting down and frowned. “I thought marriage contracts couldn’t be cancelled. Or you know, only under very special circumstances.”
Minerva seemed to be genuinely too agitated, as she apparently didn’t hear him. “We need to tell the people! Together we could go and look for him. A child all alone! He could be dead right now... And maybe with The Prophet we could...”
That moment, the door was opened again and Draco Malfoy walked in with his friend Pansy Parkinson in tow. They seemed to be talking about a former Slytherin Prefect who had been sent to Azkaban and was now free again, since the Ministry had admitted to just imprisoning him due to lack of any actual investigation.
“Alright” Harry smirked and nodded. “Go get your handsome man to join this spiel of fake relationships and divorces. I’m sure nothing can go wrong” he added sarcastically.
He couldn’t finish his sentence, as Draco’s parent instincts suddenly went through the roof. He didn’t even know he had any of them, until now. “You gave Potter crayons?! Why would you do that?! He could actually get hurt!”
“Potter, come on” Nott turned to him and held out his hands as if he wanted to say ‘what are you doing?!’. “Just kiss Draco and if it doesn’t work, we’ll try and find a new thing.”
Charlie nodded and sighed then. “Frankly, I have never worked with someone who’s in need of getting over seven years of memories back. Does anyone here know what he went through in his seventh year? And what happened to him during the Battle of Hogwarts?”
Rubbing his head, Draco sighed and got up to change his clothes and get ready for the day. He needed to at least find him and see whether or not he was doing fine. However, he was with his Gryffindor friends, so he was probably doing very well. Maybe he was even laughing and joking just like they had done the last few months.
“Moving in so quickly?” Draco grinned and placed an arm around him, pressing a kiss on his forehead. “Wouldn’t that be against everything that dating and getting to know each other stand for?”
Harry was quiet, though clearly lost in thoughts. “Ron’s brothers run the joke shop, Weasley’s Wizards Wheezes, right? What if I give them the vault? They could look through it and take everything they want – the whole vault or just a few items. Everything else, I’d throw away.”
Malfoy smirked. “I have one more condition to make. One more deal.”
“Just make sure to give the baby Draco's main DNA” Severus chimed up from the sofa. When Harry looked at him questioning, he shrugged his shoulders. “If you have a smart mother, you should help the genes, not disable them.”
“Harry! How wonderful of you to come by so early! I haven’t seen you in such a long time!” she hurried towards him and quickly greeted him with a hug.
Instead of answering right away, he raised his eyebrows and shook his head. “Not you too, Gregory! Why does everyone want me to be the Boy Who Lived? I thought you Slytherins were better at seeing the people behind the names?”
Lost for words, Harry could only stare at the other wizard. Not a second later, the door was opened again and Draco Malfoy walked in with his friend Pansy Parkinson in tow. They seemed to be talking about something, when Zabini leaned closer. “And since we’re talking about asking people out... You’ve already done the first part to my advice. Now you only have to ask him out.”
They sadly didn’t have any more time, as Draco’s phone suddenly vibrated and his alarm clock started ringing. Draco turned around and tried to get up and turn off the ringing, when Harry just kept him in his arms and stopped the phone with wandless magic.
He knew that the Headmistress probably just wanted to show them what they had changed and that things like that belonged on that list as well, however, it was slightly too  much for Harry. There were even a few memories playing on repeat.
“Hé, petit!” Draco grinned and hugged her, before both started off a rant in French which Harry was helplessly lost in and he quickly made his way to the family home where Fleur just appeared in the doorway.
His godfather looked at him with his neutral mask perfectly stable, when he nodded and they both made their way into the Potion Master’s office. Everything looked the same: neutral, clean, neat… Except for one thing. Draco was caught off guard by a playpen standing in the corner of the room.
“I mean…” Draco shrugged his shoulders. “He told me he was benched from Auror work when we first met. I’m not sure if that does anything but…”
Smiling at Fleur, Harry nodded. “Sometimes I forget that you’re an amazing mediwitch.” He drank the potion, his body relaxing and he breathed out finally, as if he had been holding his breath for the past three or four hours.
“No” Draco shook his head. “Well, yes, of course. But it’s not that.”
After he had greeted them and presented Draco as his boyfriend, he made his way to the kitchen. Knocking on the door to get his self-proclaimed mother’s attention, Molly turned around and smiled broadly.
The coffee mug landed on the table loudly and Draco got up, making as much noise as he could, while grinning broadly at Harry. When he was standing closer to him, he narrowed his eyes, playing his part.
Smiling, Fleur walked over to a cabinet on the wall and opened it. Harry was astonished by the amount of small potion’s vials in there. As she grabbed one and turned around, she must have seen his expression, as she smirked at him.
The dark blond man grabbed his cup of coffee and shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly. “I’m an Auror. But I’m currently on the bench, so not that bad for Christmas.”
Millicent opened the door softly and when they passed through it, they walked through a small hallway and then suddenly stood in front of another door. Opening this one again, they found themselves in a very familiar room. They stood at the far end of the Slytherin Common Room, right behind the piano.
“I promise not to be the thing that’s standing in the corner of the room” Draco retorted and shook his head. Looking back at Harry, he realized that he looked rather tired. Maybe this little adventure and the visitors today had taken a toll on him. “Why don’t you lie down, Harry. I’ll take a look at where the doors are leading in the upper floors. Maybe there’s even a full on apartment up there that you had no idea existed.”
The young ginger man told his wife to back to bed. When Granger turned around, Draco could see that she actually was really pregnant. That made a lot of sense since she wouldn’t just like that abandon her post at the Ministry.
“Of course not!” Kingsley shook his head and there was hint of a smile. The war was not that far away to joke about it. Draco felt so himself. “It’s an old spell, Seamus. Maybe it has changed somehow and now it works differently. That’s why it’s a dangerous spell.”
Malfoy sighed. “You do that, I’ll continue to try and get inside.”
child is being starved! I’m merely pointing out that...”
“What do you want?”
“Well” Harry smiled. “We have a small change in plan: The Minister just arrived and…” he interrupted himself when Henry scoffed and shook his head. Harry nodded; the Minister of Magic was only here for the publicity, everyone knew it. However, maybe after the cake cutting and the last few pictures, he would leave again. With such a high profile wedding, it was to be expected. “I have decided to move the cake cutting up to after the waltz right now. Everyone’s already informed and the photographer will stay longer to get some pictures without the Minister. No additional charge.”
Shaking his head, Draco smirked. “Thank you, I’m doing fine.”
There was something like fright in his voice and Harry decided not to turn around and confirm it – they all seemed to have their own nightmares. Maybe for Malfoy it was cellars? He walked closer, carefully and hoping that nothing would jump out at him.
Before he could say anything, he felt Alamar’s magic surround him and he was lifted up from the ground and placed on the sofa next to him. “Watch out for the broken pieces, Harry. They can be very small.”
Anyway, come outside to the lake and spend a few hours with me there. Wait, I had another reason: Do it for you, because you’ve been studying none-stop. And I believe you could use a little time off and just enjoying life.
Pansy blushed immediately and she smiled at the Gryffindor. Draco frowned: There was definitely something going on... However, since Draco wasn’t sure whether or not Millicent, Theodore and Blaise knew about whatever was going on between Longbottom and Pansy, he didn’t say anything about how they were acting.
“I couldn’t decide what you would like more” Harry laughed and shrugged his shoulders.
Harry knew well enough that his lovely husband tended to go a little crazy with his hair if he didn’t have time to comb it through inch by inch and check for something. So, he did feel rather guilty – especially after he had seen him running his hand through his hair so many times over the course of the day. Now, at least he could make up for it.
“I fully agree.”
Shaking his head, Draco put the letter back into the envelope and shoved it somewhere between the pages. He had always thought that the Golden Trio would be a little bit more… friendly to each other. Helpful, even.
“Because you want to prove you’ve changed?” Harry offered and smirked. He placed a soft kiss on Draco’s cheek and walked around the table. Looking back at his boyfriend, who still stood there, staring angrily at the object, he chuckled. Draco was sometimes like a child – yes. But then again, Harry also wasn’t far off. He was sure that both their upbringings had something to do with that – neither had been allowed to be a child while they were technically in this age. Harry, because his aunt and uncle basically used him as an unpaid servant and Draco, because his parents wanted him to be the perfect child – in their eyes a little adult.
“Absolutely not, Potter.”
Rolling his eyes, Draco grabbed his legs and pulled him closer into a real kiss. Harry gasped and felt his lips on his. He shivered and threw his arms around Draco’s neck, climbing on his lap. He tried to lead the kiss, though the Slytherin had him firmly under his control.
“Me trying to kill Dumbledore, yeah. I think with this method he’ll surely stay away for good, forever.”
Grinning, Harry winked at him. “She won’t remember, because I’ve taken her memory of who the person was taking her name. In her mind it was just a shadowy figure that looks probably like Lucius Malfoy. Just for shits and giggles.”
Ron shook his head. “Mate, you really need to talk to him, like normal people. We think with a little guidance and a good and heartfelt talk, you might be able to communicate. A good relationship is all just communication.”
“You guess? You won a war, Harry. I would say that’s a good outcome, now right?”
Daphne shook her head and shoved the other Slytherin slightly. “Draco!” Her eyes were so innocent, even though Harry could see how amused she was by their discussions.
Nora raced inside as well and started sniffing all the different ingredients on the rack, which Draco thought was hilarious. She almost looked like one of these Muggle drug dogs.
Draco grinned, placing his arms around his back and kissing his temple.
And with that the memory ended and Harry opened his eyes in the small azure room again. Before he could get his thoughts straight, Malfoy chuckled. “Well, whatever happened, William was a badass! Throwing the quill like that! And the magical spell which still works today… I wish I had that kind of magic.”
He laughed and slid from the bar. “Nothing you can do about it.”
Harry stood there dumbfounded. It sounded so easy! There was just one problem… “But the original caster is dead! Shouldn’t the curse have been broken itself by then?”
“That’s what you think!” Harry rolled his eyes, though he was clearly enjoying this little banter between them.
“That phone call didn’t sound all too good” the Gryffindor said and kissed Draco’s temple.
Draco hummed. “It’s really not” he retorted, pulling him into a passionate kiss right then and there.
“Why didn’t Madam Pomfrey patch it?” he wondered out loud.
“Should we look at the bedrooms as well? Maybe then we can go and tell Neville to stop freaking out and give him a place to sleep?” Harry offered and Pansy smiled broadly, hugging him as well.
I kept it! Does that really mean something? Or am I getting worse again?
Harry smirked. “Did you practice that speech?”
Draco frowned, about to intervene, when Harry was already answering. “You have? What have you heard?” He was already not hiding behind Draco anymore. Well, only a little. This woman certainly had her way with children.
Blaise grinned. “So he’s awesome!”
Harry kept holding him tightly and whispered softly into his ears which made him calm down after a few minutes and he nuzzled into the crook of Harry’s neck, realizing that he had just had a very terrible nightmare. It seemed as if everything that had happened in the last few months had finally broken down on him.
“Wow, hey” Neville spoke up and chuckled. “Who do you think I am, guys? I would never interfere with an ongoing joke.” He grinned maliciously. “I’m just glad I’m aware of what’s going on.”
“I don’t know. I have literally never heard of a… what was that test? Magical Inheritance Test? Magical Guardian Test?” she shook her head. “Anyway, I read magic is rather easily influenced, so he
I’m waiting. Outside. And just because I know you, I haven’t packed a blanket so unless you want to visit me in the Hospital Wing for the next few days, you have to come and find me.
Theodore frowned slightly. “You do realize that there’s a practical as well, right? The experts would be freaking out if you’d know nothing.”
“I’m going to look for Granger and Weasley. I need to know as much as possible… well actually just what they know about his childhood.”
Dudley saw you breaking one!” Aunt Petunia glared at poor Boy and if he could, he would have made himself even smaller. It wasn’t true! Dudley broke one. He was trying to push Boy’s head under water in the sink with all the soap end even some forks and knives still in there and while Boy ran away and hid in his cupboard, Dudley broke two plates.
Severus smiled smugly and leaned back in his chair, taking another sip of his quite clearly
I'm glad you all liked the last chapter ;)
I'm sorry you had to wait for a little bit. A lot of things have happened last week: I had to prepare for a huge test which I have passed today :) And I had to do so much, I'm incredibly tired. Then, my laptop broke and it's still broken but I recovered that story, so luckily I don't have to give it up! :D I've been writing half of that chapter on my new laptop which is weird (read: unfamiliar), I hope everything turned out fine :)
As they sat down, a house elf brought some tea and quickly disappeared again. Harry briefly wondered whether or not Kreature was still working here or if he had died. He suddenly felt a little guilty for not bringing him home once he had left Hogwarts, he had somehow completely forgotten him. Maybe he had to visit the kitchens and see for himself.
They apparently fell asleep like that, since Draco felt as if time had stopped or simply ignored them. When heopened his eyes again, everything was quiet and dark. It seemed to be somewhat late – or early depending on how you looked at it.
McGonagall held up her hands and smiled. “Madam Pomfrey has offered to take care of him until this little discussion is finished.”
Dean giggled and it echoed from the walls so that his husband hushed him quickly. “I’m being the adult in this relationship, apparently. What if we drown?!”
“Don’t look so terrified, Draco! I couldn’t sleep anyway. I’m very sure nobody woke up from your music. And if you’d rather have me leave you, since you know” he shrugged his shoulders, “you told me your music was supposed to be played alone in the dark; I will do that without any problem.”
“Yes bear?” Looking up, Draco saw his ward biting his lower lip, as if he wasn’t sure what he was doing or wanting to ask. Draco frowned and placed his quill down, as a sign that his full attention was on him.
Blushing slightly, Harry rolled his eyes. They bid goodbye, grinning, and Harry went over to his team mates to celebrate that they had completely out of nowhere reached the National Finals. Which sadly meant more training, less personal time and less time for friends.
Millicent looked at Potter and smiled then suddenly. “To be honest, I have never seen a baby calmer than him.”
Draco smirked. “You’re a little love struck, aren’t you Potter?”
The quiet that ensued was both oppressive and soothing. Draco rubbed his ward’s back and he had started rocking side to side, realizing that this movement calmed Harry down even further. If he had believed in his musical ability more, he probably had tried singing as well; however... he was better at the piano. And what he did already somehow worked.
Laughing, Harry pulled Draco closer and shook his head. “That’s just what I’m like, Dray. And I think you did a phenomenal job in raising me, which does sound slightly weird.”
Since there were almost no people inside the room, Harry quickly found Blaise Zabini sitting at a table, reading a book.
“How about this” Harry offered, grinning, “you’ll inspect the vault with us and give me an estimate of how much you’d be willing to pay for the vault. However, I will only accept the payment in vouchers for Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes.”
“You can’t blame me for being enchanted by this handsome snake in front of me” Harry said, feeling the need to justify himself. “But of course… If I have overstepped some boundaries, do tell me and I won’t ever do that again.”
Draco nodded relieved. “Thank you, Madam Pomfrey!”
Ron smirked. “She doesn’t know all the secret passages we know, right Harry?”
“Hey!” Pansy called out, though Harry caught a small grin, before it was replaced by an enraged expression.
to do is check his actual stats. You have given him all the nutrition potions I ordered. This surely had changed his history. Maybe they’re no longer needed, maybe we need to adjust them… This would all be written in the other parchment.” She looked at the Injury Parchment, which was getting longer and longer, before she turned back to Draco and smiled apologetically. “And don’t worry, this spell would only tell us what’s going on with him right now.”
Before Draco had the time to tell Oliver that he really was going to pay for his owl, Harry pulled him with away and they joined their friends again for a lazy study session.
“He did?” Draco looked over to Severus, trying to hide a smile.
If you still feel weird about it… talking with Harry would help quite a bit, I assume. Anyway, if you have some concerns or questions, I will answer them all.
Draco chuckled and once he reached his friends, he ruffled through Harry’s hair, which made him shake his head and the end result was a head of crazy hair. Did Harry just actually say that? That was amazing! How far had they come for the former Gryffindor to say something like that!
Hermione rolled her eyes, quite visibly. “Yes” she answered simply and placed a smile on her face. “And what does that have to do with the fact that someone hurt Harry’s relatives?”
“Thursday is Olaf? Fleur’s ferret, right?” Draco asked, smirking. Harry nodded again.
Molly turned back to Draco and smiled apologetically. “Don’t think about that, Draco. I have been a firm believer in everything going as it should go. Hardships happen, it’s called life. We go through a lot that we don’t want to. It makes us stronger. In my opinion” she looked at the door, where one of the twins had gotten the other one and they were just talking about making a deal to hunt down the others. Which consisted of Harry and Lovegood.
Severus nodded. “Yes.”
However, Draco just shrugged his shoulders. He pulled a small piece of paper out of his pocket, enlarged it and gave it to Harry. Curiously, Harry opened the bow that seemed to keep everything together and found his own flyer. Remade.
Finally, Harry turned to his Magical Guardian. “Do you also have nightmares?”
Graeme read through the statements and performed a few spells on them, probably to see that they had been written without being forced to. Whatever he had tested, he seemed to be content with what he found (or didn’t find).
“Ah” Harry nodded and got up to sit down next to his husband. “Come here, then.”
“You’re a god-awful human being.” Harry glared at him. “Did you not learn that if you’re stabbing people in the back, the tables could turn as well?”
“Show-off” he muttered.
“How am I supposed to know who I’m looking for, Harry?!” he had asked and rolled his eyes, when he caught Jason walking through the room towards Pansy. He grabbed his camera and pointed it at his best friend, taking a picture of when Jason placed a soft kiss on her head. These two were just too precious.
Eric chuckled. “No!” He looked at the door, where Alamar had left through, before he turned back to Harry. “We fairies need other people or species around us. We hate our own species. Or at least, Haltija do. Other fairies even travel in groups.” He shuddered as if it was the last thing he had ever wanted to do.
” Harry whispered into Draco’s ear and kissed the corner of his lips again.
A sudden noise made both turn to their right. “Good evening, gentlemen.”
Smirking, Draco decided to explain: “We went to Oliver, Pans. He has a huge book of potential names and their meanings. Harry just looked at them and… decided on taking one right there, didn’t you?” he turned to his ward.
Just like that, Draco had also felt his confusion return. And his jealousy. His own godfather had wanted to spend with little Harry, but when he was a child, it had always looked like Severus could have never run away the fastest. Well, it was probably his parents and had nothing to do with him. Draco knew that whenever they spent time together (alone), they were pretty close.
When he opened the door, he found his kitchen empty, though the journal was in a different spot. Harry checked the book mark and found Draco hadn’t even made it half way through yet.
Hermione crossed her arms over her chest and looked disapprovingly. Harry shrugged his shoulders. “I’m serious! I don’t just do things without first being pushed.”
“That’s very detailed...” Draco mentioned and shook his head.
However, Potter seemed clearly confused. “Um… okay. I just wanted to let you know that I haven’t offered you all our services. Usually, I follow a person around for two or three days just to get a feeling for their personality. I do realize that I haven’t offered you this and I apologize.”
See you soon (hopefully)
“You clearly like to be around them, then” Eric commented and smirked.
He really needed to find something to say… Finally, he found just the topic. “I need to think about something and I can’t really do that when I’m with you all.” Before Ron could even ask, Harry sighed. “McGonagall asked me to take over Hogwarts.”
His friend seemed impressed. “So you have a lot of free time then, don’t you? What are you going to do with it?”
Good evening Remus
“I asked for it” Harry smirked and pulled out his phone, pressing Draco’s number. He didn’t have to wait long when Draco picked up and even heard a few voices in the background. So he wasn’t alone. Good.
“Don’t worry about me, Hermione. I think I’ve found my place.”
Pansy chuckled. “As if. I take my coffee as black as my soul!”
I’m not sure why I’m begging. That’s so not me. But I just want him to be happy and he loves his plants. That’s all. Well, and I love the roses you guys bought us for the wedding. I hadn’t gotten any time to place them in the garden. Please, Draco! Please, Harry!
“No.” Draco crossed his arms in front of his chest and raised his eyebrows. “If he wants to talk to me, he has to get over his ego and come in here. There’s nothing harmful inside.”
He had just left the library, when he heard familiar sounding steps and turned around to see his boyfriend walking closer.
That made Draco grin and he leaned forward, seductively. “My pleasure, love.” He pulled Harry into his arms and marched to a huge bed, where he placed him down carefully.
“So, now what?” Ron asked and frowned. “We could try and get out through the hole in the wall, right?”
Alamar chuckled and sighed. “Sorry Aurora, Nigel was here and he clearly took something from you.” Aurora meowed to protest and then walked over to her bowl and started eating nonetheless.
Harry’s smirk grew wider until he was laughing loudly. It was a relieved laughing, but he also grabbed Draco closer to him. “I told you I loved you and you tell me you quit your job? Well done, Mr. Brown.”
“Sure.”
“Pansy, help me!” Harry called out and laughed as Draco tickled him again.
“Try me” Draco repeated. “If I were on a love potion, I couldn’t say anything bad about you. I’d be too much in love with you to see your flaws. So… try me.”
Draco sighed and threw the book onto the table, rolling his eyes. “It’s like I have a dog.”
“More divorce proceedings?” she asked quietly.
As if his friend had read his mind, he smirked. “Yeah, yeah. Liquid courage is also a good idea, mate.”
“Malfoy, we’re getting…”
Draco grinned and hugged the dog. “I know, Paddy, I know! I’m here now!” he said and ruffled his fur. He then walked to the table at the back, Padfoot behind him.
“Where?” Harry looked around, biting back a grin, though it didn’t work entirely.
“Sirius Black. It was nothing special, a summer romance and him telling me that nobody could ever know.” Snape smiled sadly. “After that summer, he went back to bullying me with his friends. But it hurt so much more.”
Draco nodded and smiled tenderly. “You’re all the comfort I need.”
The only thing Harry could do was nod weakly, before Madam Pomfrey stood next to them again. She performed some spells which cleared the wound and only left some smaller scars. Harry frowned at them and even Draco looked up at the mediwitch.
Pansy brought him back to his sad reality and placed a hand on his knee. “Well, it’s a little late for that, don’t you think, Draco? We both are on the dark side, me having wanted to give him to the Dark Lord and you, actually having the Dark Mark on your arm…”
“Merlin, this is creepy!” Millicent finally said, turning back to the others.
Stopping in the middle of his action, Harry turned to his ex and placed the kettle down again. “What are you saying?”
He jumped from the couch and landed on his feet (and hands), almost making the left over Treacle Tart fall down, though Draco caught it. Well, Potter ran through to Lovegood, asking her to join and while she nodded enthusiastically, Weaslette joined as well. Draco frowned slightly, asking himself why Potter wouldn’t ask him to join, but he decided not to pressure his ward and also his own mind.
Draco’s mother chuckled, as if Draco had asked the funniest question. “Oh, he comes by approximately three times in two months. And we’ve had these lovely meetings for the past five years, I believe.”
“You never know. Slughorn might revolutionize the marking system.” Hermione grinned at Harry’s and Ron’s widened eyes.
Draco’s best friend rolled her eyes, but she grinned now as well. “I guess. But I’m still mad at Neville for not being here.”
Frowning, Ron looked after her as she left the room again. “How does she even know the password?”
“Hey” Malfoy said and climbed into the room as well. He frowned and looked up with wide eyes. “That is amazing!”
Apparently, Mrs Williams had left an obvious mark on him. He only nodded and cleared his throat. “So, Mrs Williams talked to me.”
He pushed a few hair strains to the side and showed the Headmistress his bluish strain of hair. McGonagall frowned for a few seconds, before she smiled. “Well in that case, I do believe that maybe Charms would interest Potter?” she looked at him questioningly and Draco’s ward nodded with wide eyes.
“Oh no.” The owl flew away without even wanting a treat and left Draco with an uneasy feeling in the stomach.
Harry hummed, confirming it, and in a matter of seconds, he placed the food onto the table. “If you’d rather have something else, I can also order some pizza.” He sat down and grabbed a piece of pancake, though his eyes were curious.
A few moments, both enjoyed the silence of the waves crashing in the distance, the earth rotating and the stars wandering through the night sky. Draco nestled closer to Harry again, feeling the heat from his body all around him and a soft happy sigh escaped him, when he closed his eyes.
While Malfoy turned to look at him, Harry walked into the creepy room, picked it up and held it into the light of his wand. The Slytherin walked over to look at it.
He still brought over a few glasses, pouring whatever red wine he had chosen inside and handed out the glasses to Neville, Hannah, Blaise, Pansy, Daphne and finally Harry. He looked slightly questioning and Harry rolled his eyes, his eyes briefly stopping on the cup of tea Hermione was trying to clean up right now.
Millicent wasn’t going to say no and after ten seconds, Blaise and Theodore followed, clearly up to something (most likely a snowball fight). Draco sighed and fell onto the couch furthest away from the entrance and the best hidden from everyone else.
Kingsley also came by and gave me my official note. Apparently, since I have been gone too long, they decided to retire me. Thank you, Aurors, for taking away my only goal in life. So now I can actually die, because I have nothing else left. Fucking idiots!
Love, your Teapot
Harry looked at his feet. “Ze showed me the emergency entrance. When you don’t know the password...”
Old people had a certain style and even though Draco couldn’t really pin down what kind of a style they had, Mrs. Williams’ house matched all the other houses perfectly. She told him to sit down at the small kitchen table and presented him with a cake.
“It’s a Muggle decease, mostly that is. It affects the lungs, so the patients have difficulty breathing, they’re coughing, have a fever and chest pain. Usually, people will realize that and they bring their children to the doctor, but…” She wordlessly pointed at the Injury Parchment, where Draco saw the new bullet point.
“Mister Longbottom, if your health is of your most important concern, you should stay out of the cold. If your love life is your most important concern...” Madam Pomfrey shrugged and went back to her desk.
“That wizard was...” Hermione had just been about to start a full on rant about history, while Ron held his ears closed with his hands. It looked like he had gone back to his childhood years. Harry was actually waiting for him to call out ‘I can’t hear you, lalalalala’. Luckily, he didn’t do it.
Draco frowned slightly. “No specific time?” he dumbly asked.
“Not to worry.” The headmistress looked over the room. Harry followed her gaze and found Padfoot looking for something in a corner. He sneezed and shook his head, wandering back to Harry. Chuckling, Minerva turned back to him. “So, have you gotten any further with the idea of living quarters?”
He looked over to the table where Draco was and saw him fuming and glaring at him, though now it seemed to be his turn to only barely keep it together as he turned back to Pansy and said something, which made her look at him now. Shrugging his shoulders, Harry looked at the box, Hannah was opening. He wasn’t really in the mood to play a game – well, any other than the one Draco and he were currently playing – but he still stayed.
“It’s a name of a huge lake.”
“Draco, come with me, I want to show you something” she said and beckoned him to follow her into her office. Inside this rather big room was in the middle a beautiful old desk, clearly organized. However, on top were a lot of pictured in two neat piles.
“Nope” Eric tried to hide a lopsided grin and received a shove from his sister.
Kira bowed mockingly. “Then I believe I need to tell you my full name as well, huh? I’m Kyreena Harmony Radella Rogers. Not married, so no other last name. I think my three first names are quite enough.”
“You are a terrible sister!” Padma called out, while Draco snorted.
“What? No” Harry shook his head and turned to look at Ron. “Why would you think that?”
There was a warm scent of cake in the air and Molly’s special Christmas Tea. Luna sat at the table with a few friends from Dubledore’s Army. He greeted them and after a little small talk, Ginny grabbed two slices of cake and they walked into Luna’s office.
“For now” Draco said and smiled sadly. “He’s getting all the memories of the age he’s in. Once he’s eleven, he might hate me.”
“Hello Mr. Malfoy” Madam Pomfrey greeted him and smiled at him encouragingly. “Did you get a little sleep last night?”
Longbottom had this sudden shocked expression on his face. “What? But I have a date in Hogsmeade this evening!”
“You Gryffindors have no idea how to protect yourself in this snow” Malfoy commented and made Harry laugh slightly. The Slytherin held out his hand for Hermione and helped her get up again. It was still a miracle to Harry how quickly Malfoy had gotten rid of his ‘evil persona’ after Azkaban. And now, even Hermione didn’t seem bothered by him being around them. Though Harry did realize she didn’t seem to care at all. Not like him, who was still somewhat looking on how to bump into Malfoy and pretend that he hadn’t stalked him on the Marauder’s Map all evening long.
Draco frowned. “You’re scaring me slightly, what does it mean?”
“Why on earth would I ever forget you, Draco? You’re everything to me!”
“What the fuck is going on?! He’s just three years old!” Draco was fuming. That little shit of cousin should burn in hell forever – as the Muggles said. Well, no. All of his relatives should burn in hell. “No food for a fortnight?! How did he even survive that?!”
Shaking his head, Draco walked closer. The closer he got, the more he could see it actually was Harry. His head lay in his arms which he had pushed under it. One knee was bent and he swayed it from side to side.
“Ten years?!” Pansy practically screamed.
I’ve taught myself the Patronus in fifth year and I always found solace in it – a swallow. But today, when I taught Harry, I think something happened to my Patronus. It changed. I now have a stag… Is that normal?
Harry chuckled. “Especially since we already know how to get the color out of your hair by tonight?”
“Well, yes. Milos means ‘beloved’ and I thought that worked.”
Mirjam looked at Draco and smiled. “You don’t see children, I assume?”
This made Draco return his smirk, before he sighed and shook his head. “Potter, you are hopeless when it comes to wine.”
, Draco thought and almost rolled his eyes. “I do prefer beer, though.”
He really hoped, he could help Harry
Unsurprisingly, Harry wasn’t very surprised by their actions, as he simply shrugged his shoulders. He grinned slightly devilish and called out “Follow me!” as he jumped into the black hole.
“That just because I have the perfect person to say it to.”
Apparently, Harry wasn’t going to argue with her and waved at them, before he left the Common Room, heading to his own room and quite possibly falling asleep while he was standing in the middle of it.
Theodore shrugged his shoulders. “It did look as if there was something going to happen in her office.”
At exactly 2pm, McGonagall appeared in the Great Hall, where they were meeting. Harry was feeling just slightly grumpy, since Draco had not been fast enough and instead of spending a few quiet moments with him, he was surrounded by Ron, Hermione, Neville and Hannah. Not that he had anything against them… he just preferred his husband. If they weren’t hiding their relationship, nobody would have even questioned by Draco would follow Harry to the lake. Actually, why were they even hiding their relationship?! It wasn’t as if people were angry at them… Maybe it was just because they were so used to pretend to be just friends – not even.
Sirius decided to follow me.” Harry stopped talking, inhaling deeply. “And
“Hey mate, where were you? We had a meeting with Kingsley first thing today.” Ron tilted his head and shook a strain of hair out of his face that seemed to bother him.
Harry placed a kiss on Draco’s temple and smiled softly. He looked at the therapist, realizing it was his turn to say something. “Draco makes me lose all my doubts that I’m not good enough. Whenever I’m with him, I know that I don’t have to hide parts of myself. He knows me better than I know myself and he’s the one who got me out of a bad mindset after the war. Sometimes I think that without his love and his patience, I wouldn’t have been able to go back into Wizarding society. Draco makes me feel like I’m unstoppable whenever I’m with him. Nothing can happen when we’re together.”
“These aren’t really the questions I’ve got here.” The therapist looked at her parchment, seemingly deciding to just ask the question and let them have their fun. “How do you see the future?”
He then stopped behind an arm chair and was ‘hiding’ again. Draco smirked and walked around, seeing Potter pushing his face into the back of the chair. “Hmm, where is my special little laughing bear, now?” he asked, touching Potter’s shoulder.
Pansy gasped loudly and jumped up, which made Draco push Harry quickly into the direction of the secret door.
He followed his … boyfriend up the ladder while Harry shook his head. Nott must have magical kisses if Ron was just doing whatever he wanted and actually left Harry – his best friend – in the dark alone with Malfoy.
“Hermione Jean Weasley!” he called through the room. When Hermione looked at him, clearly trying to be innocent, he raised his eyebrows. “I know what your magic feels like! Why would you do that?”
“That’s a discussion we’re going to have another time. I’m supposed to meet the headmistress now. It’s been a pleasure making your acquaintance, Mr. Potter.”
The room seemed to brighten und calmed Harry down rather fast. He turned back to the Slytherin and looked at him questioningly. “What do you mean by ‘what’s going on’ though?”
“Oh, I’m sorry” she seemed flustered and sat down quickly, placing her papers onto the table. “I’m Mirjam Octasi, one of the leading wizarding marriage counselors in the UK.”
Just then, Harry appeared right next to them. “Hi guys.”
“We wanted to talk it through, see where we were at and yeah, figure out how to tell the Wizarding World that their favorite it-couple would no longer exist” Ginny rolled her eyes and grinned. “And I especially wanted to tell him to finally stop dancing around you as if that was the only way to get your attention. It looks like he found another way of getting under your skin.”
I'm going to be out of town for a few days and I looked through my Drarry ideas and decided to work on this story again, before I'm leaving. So another chapter was born.
Draco frowned. If Granger hadn’t known something like that, how would she know about all the other stuff?! Maybe Potter kept most of these things secret, not wanting to make his friends concerned for his well-being…
Before he could say something, Harry looked up and whispered a spell, which made Pansy shout something from the other end of the room. The camera came floating closer and sat on the table in front of Draco and Harry.
“Lost?” someone suddenly asked and Draco turned around and was faced with none other than Harry Potter.
.” He looked at Harry expectantly and to this, he could only nod. Well, and he laughed as well, thinking of how Malfoy would probably rant about his father.
Pansy – who actually was the person trying to get inside – joined after a millisecond with a scream of her own until it transformed into a fit of giggles for both. Draco pushed the door open a little bit more to see them both on the floor laughing.
Thy calm Lion
The owl in question was sitting on a window sill, looking at him intently. It was a white barn owl. The wings which it had tucked closely to its body were brown, with almost orange color changes around it and the white stomach looked incredibly soft and the equally as white face had a heart form.
He chuckled softly and shrugged his shoulders. Draco turned back to look at him and found his eyes almost sparkling, even with the darkness surrounding them, it was beautiful. The stars were illuminating Harry’s features perfectly and the soft waves in the background made this whole situation so much dreamlike.
The Gryffindor accepted his glass of wine, sipping a little bit, before he put it down again, never looking away from Draco, who was about to turn slightly red. “I guess.”
This made Fleur look up from talking with Dominique and shake her head. “Oh, I’m not scared. I know Bill loves me – even if it’s not the same level of love you show each other, I know I have his heart.”
“What do you mean with ‘different kinds of magic’, Eric? Are there more than one?” Harry sat walked to the window and sat down on the windowsill, looking intrigued.
Harry really couldn’t help but smile dumbly over it, which in turn made Neville sigh and roll his eyes. “How have you not been found out until now? You two are the most love-sick people I’ve met so far, and I’ve seen Dean and Seamus looking at each other secretively!”
Harry rolled his eyes, pretending to be… well no, he was indeed annoyed by this, so his eyeroll had been honest at least. Sighing, he turned to Neville and glared at him, before looking at his husband. “Malfoy… you…”
“Ready to go home?” Draco asked and his ward nodded, he slid from Draco’s arm and started walking towards Remus.
“What?” Draco asked and stood there, half through the door. Half his face was hidden in the shadows and with his dark blue button up shirt and his slightly wild hair, Harry could almost feel his knees weaken. He looked so damn good! So freaking handsome… He looked quite intrigued, when the doorbell sounded again, this time even knocks could be heard.
“That’s only one wrong letter, bear. It’s
Shaking his head, Draco chuckled. “I couldn’t hate your guts, Harry. I, however, hate Weasley’s guts. So… just a warning.”
he realized that he was actually very angry at her. How was she allowed to leave Azkaban and he had to stay and rot in there?! Yes, he was supposed to kill Dumbledore, but he hadn’t done that. He hadn’t even killed anybody! Granted, neither had she, but still… it was unfair.
“Harry, I thought Theodore went to my former mother's with you?”
And so, he created a mist magical story over his palm. The story was about nothing in particular. It was just soft whitish magic, almost like a Patronus, just instead of blue it was white. Since it looked so soft, most children were apparently drawn to it. At least that was what he had read. He had never practices it outside of the comfort of his own room, when he had needed a little bit of a reminder that life was going to turn around eventually.
Harry laughed and nodded. “Absolutely, I’ll be there.”
Harry sighed. “So, no reason in hiding this then?” Just then his eyes fell on the three lines under the bingo sheet. The additional points were: 1) 50 Points if either comes out as gay. 2) 100 Points if you figure out their relationship status. 3) 200 Points if you figure out they’re married and what last name they have. “This is humiliating.”
“Madam Pomfrey” Draco greeted the Healer, seemingly slightly suspicious. “What a nice… surprise.” He glanced at Harry, though still didn’t let go. Harry assumed that Draco thought he didn’t need to do that as they were already caught. Frankly, Harry was happy with that thought.
“Hi Olivia, hey James, how are you doing?” Potter greeted them and they walked to the bar, where the Saviour gave them a coke each.
Harry leaned over, capturing his lips in a kiss, prompting another ‘ew’ from Dominique, while Fleur said something to Bill, making him calm down his fake anger. “Of course,
Draco frowned at it. “What is this? His cousin pushed him down the stairs?!” Shaking his head, Draco turned to look at baby Potter, sleeping soundly in the crib. “How old is this idiot that he thinks it’s a good idea to push a baby down some stairs?”
“Pansy! What did you just do?” he asked, shaking his head. Harry rubbed his shoulder with his one free hand and leaned down to kiss the top of his head. Draco smiled, looking up at his boyfriend, when another flashing light and the sound of picture taken distracted them both.
“I…” Harry stared at Draco. As crazy as it seemed to say these words after their first… well second kiss, he knew exactly what Draco felt. He felt the same. “I love you too, Draco. Very much so.”
“Oh my god, Draco! Stop it with these stupid jokes!” Harry – overly dramatic – rolled his eyes again and stood up.
Whatever it was that was hurting Potter, he didn’t have the words necessary to talk about it and was babbling something.
Draco snorted. “Why are you guys so dusty? There’s some down there, but not that much!”
“And the intern just decided he was able to handle magic that not even you can pinpoint?” Harry asked and snorted. “That must be a wizard who thinks the world has nothing bad to offer.” He could see Draco rolling his eyes, but shook his head. Everyone who was coming back to Hogwarts right now had probably seen more bad things than they should have at their age.
She was just about to continue talking, when Harry said the words he was dreading all these days. “It’s Draco Malfoy.”
“I have no idea” Draco responded and grinned. He looked at the house. “Do you like the name Heinrich?”
“Oh yeah” Harry sighed. “I totally forgot all about you being Benjamin. Did you write about that in your letter as well?”
“How long has this been going on?” Draco looked very concerned. With the lack of a good night’s sleep his pureblood mask wasn’t entirely there, though it could also have been the imprisonment having changed him. Harry had to admit that he hadn’t seen much of the emotionless mask yesterday. He seemed rather open about his feelings.
. That’s all part of the plan, you know” Harry said and smirked again. He heard some ruffling next to him and looked up, pretending to look over there and not noticing that people were hiding behind the statue. Luckily, Padfoot came racing back with the piece of wood to distract him again.
“Absolutely not” Draco answered, ignoring the shiver that ran down his spine, and hit his ward over the head with the parchment, which led to Harry chuckling and leaving the room.
Harry laughed and shrugged his shoulders. “I got into reading right after Hogwarts, when I didn’t need it anymore.” He winked at Hermione. “And I wanted to find as many interesting books as possible, so I started travelling the world and looking for them. I realized I was really good at finding all sorts of books, so I decided to make it my passion.” Before he could continue, Hannah shouted.
“Still at Hogwarts or on another day? Perhaps the end of time?” Draco smirked and got a glare from his best friend, before she smiled at him innocently.
Luckily it seemed, as if that sentence alone was completing the chaos, as their classmates started screaming, commenting, discussing and arguing with each other whether or not Harry had the right to say something like that. While some discussions were about their broken relationship and whether or not one could prioritize money over happiness and a relationship, most were talking about if Toby worked for this pizzeria, which was why Harry was always leaving when that pizzeria was calling.
Potter looked around curiously, though once he was free to walk around, he chose to walk over to Draco and demand to be put on his knees. Chuckling slightly, Draco lifted him up and spun him around twice. His ward was laughing loudly and squealed, before he kicked shortly and Draco pulled him closer and sat him down on his lap.
Ian narrowed his eyes and crossed his arms over his chest. He turned to Potter and looked at him, while the other man was eating slowly. “Did your rebound guy just threaten a food critic?!”
be looking into that” the witch commented and crossed her arms again.
While he went back to his room to write a letter back, asking for help with his Patronus, he heard Pansy telling Harry to also read the book about Arithmacy, even though the Savior hadn’t taken this class. He was going to tell them that after he had written his letter.
Draco frowned. “Seriously, Potter. Everyone can see that you’re excluding yourself from this relationship. So, what’s going on?”
“Nothing!” Harry rolled his eyes.
to raise him over his friends.”
“I’m Benjamin Brown” he answered. He had hated the name for a long time, before he had started to see its advantage. It was easy to remember and fun to say. Most of his undercover stuff had happened with the personality of Benjamin Brown, though the people in dark circles only knew him as Jaime B.
“I heard you’re not doing good, but this is another level. Are you dying?” Draco asked upfront and sat down on another chair.
Draco smiled and nodded. “Just a few heavy life questions. You’ll get them once you’re older.”
“That’s okay, you just need to find someone who likes you the way you are. And I like you! You are awesome and you protect me, remember?” Harry smiled, pointing at Draco’s hair. Subconsciously, Draco touched his hair, still having a few tears in his eyes. His little ward continued: “Everyone makes mistakes! Pansy said that. It’s important that you learn from them, if you can’t correct them now at least learn from them.”
“I’m sorry?” Severus asked and a little smirk was on his face, as Harry rolled his eyes and corrected himself.
Pansy frowned slightly and held him back by his arm. “Are you okay?”
The wind blew Draco’s hair into his face, but Potter tucked it all away and smiled at the Slytherin. “It’s not optimism, Benjamin. It’s hope.”
Grinning, Draco turned to the letter.
“I don’t think I’m wanted in here anymore” the woman grinned and placed some money on the counter. “Good night, you two.”
“Oh, I am” Harry grinned and knelt down, so he had about the same eyelevel as her. “I’m playing a prank on your uncle and aunt, well and everyone else who’s currently at Hogwarts.”
Harry chuckled. “I’ve been thinking: Do you want me to invite Hannah as well?” He smirked when Neville turned slightly red. “I know you’ve been trying to be around us whenever she’s here.”
Draco looked up and returned to smile. “I love you too, Harry. You’re my everything, so don’t be scared that I might actually get a divorce.” He grinned. “We both know you’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
Harry turned back to her and raised his eyebrow. “And here I thought you were unable to have fun.” He grinned and left her after that comment, quickly sending a text back.
He was wearing a soft pink t-shirt with a grey overall and a rainbow scarf, which Draco thought was a little on the nose. However, he couldn’t stop looking away and after a few moments, he realised that he actually liked his outfit very much.
“You never know” Harry grinned. “I will have less time at home; I’d be living here most likely.”
It was on one hand amazing to have him back to his adulthood, but on the other hand, they had to realize that he was no longer in need of their rules and what they wanted to teach him. It was extremely weird, especially for Draco.
“Harry, you know that Ron thinks you’ve just invented a boyfriend so you don’t have to come over on Christmas for the past two years.” Hermione sighed. “And if that’s the case, at least tell me why. You know I’d never judge you.”
?! Are you sure that’s really happened in reality?”
Suddenly, he read the name of the pub. “Three Sheep Pub?” he asked, when he turned towards Potter.
Warning: I've changed this chapter from Harry's perspective to Draco's.
“What for?” Harry mimicked the bow and held out his hand again.
Harry nodded and turned back to the stone above them. “You could have gone through with it, marry, have children, be an
Kevin laughed. “Yes! Do you want to call her back and ask? I mean, I couldn’t believe it when I first heard it myself, but…”
“Harry, I…” Draco widened his eyes in surprise. “I was a terrible human being to you! And you want me to go back and adopt you for real?”
His former babysitter grinned at him and greeted him as well. “Draco! Nice to see you again! Headmistress McGonagall called me in to look at the school owls. Apparently something seems to be wrong. I’m according to the grapevine still a rather good man for a job like that – even though I don’t need the extra money anymore.”
“What is wrong with you?!” Harry interrupted his husband, unsure if he could keep up the pretend if he would continue listening to Draco who seemed to try and figure out how long it would take Harry to moan with lust in front of his friends. That wasn’t happening.
“Or what?” Harry smirked.
“Oh yes. I am prepared.” Draco answered darkly.
Weaslette shrugged her shoulders. “From what I’ve witnessed today, I think you really want to be there for him. And I’m sorry for making your life hard.”
Harry was so shocked about the sudden lack of emotionless mask on the Slytherin that he stood there for two seconds, before he quickly sat down next to him. He pulled Draco into a hug and held him, while he cried – for so long that both actually missed dinner. Not that Harry cared even in the slightest.
“Draco” there was something dangerous in Neil’s voice. He had first heard it, when he had started talking about the war. The American had told him to stop talking about it as soon as he had started, with anger in his eyes. “Draco, if you don’t come home
Draco chuckled and placed his hand again on his stomach right of top of Harry’s. “And yes, this one truly was an accident. I had put up the magical blocks as usual, but Harry’s just too powerful a wizard. Might have to change to Muggle protection, huh, love?”
Draco smirked and winked at him. “Well done! Hey, didn’t I teach you not to wake me up, little bear?” he asked and grabbed his ward, tickling him.
As the owl-cat saw Harry, it stopped walking and meowed, before walking closer and purring again. Alamar chuckled. “She likes you. Don’t worry, she doesn’t hurt anyone, you can just pet her.”
“Maybe also say something like how expensive dogs are and that you’re happy when you no longer have these expenses?” Harry offered.
“And if Draco had a saying in it, he would never die!” Pansy grinned at Draco and then Harry.
“You haven’t been following my rules, have you, Sirius?” he asked and placed the bag he had brought with him on the table. “Have you been sleeping?”
That had been a mere two months ago and he had already lost his hope to finally be a fully fletched Auror. In fact, he had decided to quit as soon as he had delivered Potter to the Ministry.
Pansy rolled her eyes and they made their way into the Common Room, where Blaise widened his eyes when he saw Potter dressed in his bear suit. The Golden Boy himself grinned and clapped his hands excitedly. For the past two days, Blaise had actually started reading him stories in French.
Looking up from the surprisingly small stack of files, Kevin sighed. “Almost good. I just want these papers done before I go home. But I already made so many mistakes.” He yawned and rubbed over his eyes.
Harry nodded. “The mediwitches figured out one potion that’s helping me keeping almost all of the food. It’s not a good potion, but I’d rather have this than having to try other things that ultimately will all fail.”
“Guys, it’s our seventh year! From what I’ve heard when I was around Hermione and Ron, they went through quite a lot of weeks without food. If Harry’s afraid he won’t get enough food… he might just eat as much as possible.”
Harry frowned slightly, but seemingly decided not to ask again. He could have asked anyway, since Pansy smiled at him and nodded. “What your uncle did to you, my uncle did to me as well, you know. I sometimes still have a flashback to what happened with him. Today was a particularly bad day and I think I might have pissed off Neville.”
Harry followed his gaze and turned back to him. “Yeah. Do you think Severus would be happy about a few basilisk parts?” he immediately followed it up, as if he didn’t want to stay on the topic for too long.
Harry placed an arm around his shoulders and pressed a kiss on his cheek. “Love, stop thinking about school for at least an evening.”
She shut up and nodded. “Sorry, darling. I was in too deep. I won’t mention him again. But my theory stays the same. It would surely be helpful to have him on your side.”
Draco was by now at a stage, where he was only glaring at the Injury Parchment wordlessly. These damn relatives. Cooking at an age of 5? Mopping the floors? He was being treated worse than a house elf! At least house elves were treated and healed if they hurt themselves (which only occurred once every 100 years). This should have by no means been the injury list of the Holy and Saint Harry James Potter.
I feel obligated to tell you that I am pausing this story. My country has another very hard Corona wave and this time it looks like I'm losing my job, so I need to concentrate on job hunting (like a thousand other people in my area probably). I don't know when I'm continuing, but I can't think about a story, when I'm having real life problems.
Love, teacup
Harry looked at Draco slightly confused. “Anything you would want?” Draco asked
Severus chuckled and took a sip, frowning at the potion afterwards. The assistant took back the cup and brought it over to Draco.
Harry narrowed his eyes, while Kingsley told Draco he would be investigating this as soon as he had the paperwork filed. And with that he left. Draco could tell that Harry’s mind was racing with ideas and whatever else there was to find in there.
“I don’t know, Harry. People change.” Draco answered. He had just wanted to continue, when Pansy spoke up as well.
He looked over at Fleur, who winked at him and nodded. “I just want to know if you’ve treated Olaf fine. What do you want to do with him?”
“What are you doing?” Draco asked and frowned at Harry, who had grabbed a vial of something. They were in the kitchen, dinner almost ready and the Gryffindor stood by the stove. Draco had noticed him taking these vials and in fact, they seemed to help him, as he hadn’t thrown up that much since Draco had been keeping an eye on it.
Draco looked up to see Blaise wet from heads to toe, Harry holding a bucket in his hands and with broad grin on his face. He was laughing loudly and Blaise looked at his clothes bewildered, before he got up.
follow you to the end of the world. Since we’re already quoting this movie, I will do so as well.”
“What Eric wants to say” Alamar interrupted and fondly shook his head over how much Eric was saying, “you can stay with us. However, should you decide that we’re not a good match, there’s a rather good magical organisation for orphans in Russia, so...”
White, red, pink and yellow flowers were everywhere, some more common than others, some seemingly incredibly rare and all of them protected in different ways, depending on what the flower seemed to need to most. It was beautiful and Draco almost didn’t want to leave. However, he needed to pick a flower and bring it back to the ritual. He was suddenly drawn to a beautiful deep red flower with a white middle. It looked so happy and strong… Next to it was a flower with deep yellow trumped shaped tepals and a white core. This one was also something he would have liked.
He had barely managed to go up the first set of stairs, when he heard footsteps behind him. There was no reason to look, as he recognized them as his husband.
They were quiet for a while. When he turned to his ward, he found him with closed eyes, nose into the wind, enjoying the fresh air. He looked so happy, care-free and relaxed. Just him breathing was enough to keep Draco's interest. He shivered slightly and pulled his pullover closer, suddenly feeling his head spinning. The happiness Harry portrayed was somehow too much. It took a while until he found himself able to tear away his eyes.
“Wow, Blaise, we’re not doing wedding vows right now! I don’t have prepared anything!” Harry chuckled and received a kiss on his cheek. He turned to Ginny and smiled. “However, since it’s you, I’ll tell you that this man right here has been a right pain in my ass. But every time I lose my shit and freak out, he’s there to get me back to reality. There hasn’t been anybody in my life who can do that.”
Draco shrugged and downed the vial. Harry grabbed the glass container again and stepped back. He looked the Slytherin over. They probably looked almost the same. Both were most likely about to die, so Harry didn’t feel bad for freeing the Slytherin.
“Anyway, I will see you next week, Harry. And Draco, take care of yourself. I’ve heard you have your mind healing session tomorrow. Be open for it, okay?” Remus asked and smiled.
Getting up himself, Harry cleared his throat. “Need I remind you, that you never even wanted to have a pizzeria? Why did you want that?!”
“Personally” Longbottom continued, “I think Hermione should have come to ask you, but I mean...” He shrugged as if to show that he had no idea what to do.
He enjoyed Harry laughing and pressed a soft kiss on his boyfriend’s cheek. That was when Harry noticed someone in the distance and pointed that person out to Draco.
“I can’t promise anything” Malfoy smirked and turned back to the door.
“Hermione, this doesn’t make sense! Why would they start a law against whatever these blood potions are, when they haven’t even been tested by that time?!” He threw his hands into the air and sighed frustrated.
When he knocked on the door, Harry quickly decided what he was going to do with the offer McGonagall had given him and as the Headmistress called him in, he smiled and opened the door.
Draco chuckled and climbed back into bed, pulling Harry into his arms. “How so, dear?”
Draco stumbled into the Common Room, almost walking into Millicent, who had been about to leave the room. She stopped and helped him to their secret space, where all his friends were sitting. Once they saw him, every discussion seized.
Before he could get up and clear the table, Weaslette stood next to him. He jerked back slightly, unsure of what was going on, though she smiled at him after a few seconds of tense silence. “Malfoy, I would like to officially say that I’m sorry. The way you take care of Harry, I’m sure you’re a good guy.”
After a few minutes, where Potter was talking and only some words were clear, the door opened again and Weasley and Granger walked inside. Potter jerked up and ran towards Draco who lifted him onto his lap and hugged him. His ward was for some reason hiding his face in his chest. Something must have scared him, however, before Draco could think clearly about it, Granger’s eyes widened.
The assistant had gotten the blood from Draco and he once again glanced at Severus, who nodded at him, before he followed the assistant. The inside of the back room looked like a greenhouse. Only it wasn’t green but filled with all kinds of different colors. And it smelled as if he had just entered a flower shop, sweet and fruity and just amazing.
Draco frowned and turned around, where he found Harry standing right next to the owl, petting his stomach carefully. The owl was watching him very carefully, however, neither seemed to be threatened or scared of the other, so Draco decided that was the sign he needed to buy the owl.
“What’s this?” she asked curiously.
Once again, Draco wondered how Harry had not turned out absolutely messed up... “You fought that thing?” he asked.
“I’ll be right with you, guys” he smiled and nodded at Harry, who managed a small, tired smile, before he followed Millicent, once Pansy put her arm around him.
Harry shrugged his shoulders and put on a lemon tea. “I figured you would tell me, when you were ready.”
“Anything I can do to help? Get Professor McGonagall for example?” Hermione asked and her innocent smile proofed (apparently) that she had nothing to hide. However, Draco had grown to see through her mask of politeness.
“Someone had a sleepover, I see!”
Even if Ron had been able to see his sarcasm, he didn’t comment on it. Throwing his bag into his hands and pushing him to the exit, Ron finally filled him in on what was going to happen now. “Let me get you up to speed – we have a mission as the youngest Aurors. And also probably to get to work with others.” He sighed. Harry shook his head and was just about to ask, when they walked out of the huge Auror department, just to find Theodore Nott standing there.
Harry leaned forward, placing his arms around Draco’s naked chest, the warm water welcomed his slightly cold arms, and he kissed his husband’s cheek. “The first thing coming to your mind is to bite me? Is there something you want me to know?”
Harry chuckled, when Draco finally seemed to have eaten enough. That was weird, since Draco was the only one who could eat Harry under the table when it came to pizza. He cleaned his hands and pulled out a few more parchments. “Harry, darling, Luna sent the new batch of art. I’m not looking at it.”
“I also know that the trials you’re currently running against the two Slytherins sitting there aren’t approved by the Minister.” Potter straightened his stature and smiled a winning smile at the judge. “So, unless you have actual proof of a crime, you should let the two of them go or I will have the Minister down here in mere seconds. I’m Harry Potter, I can do that.”
Pansy growled. She actually growled at Draco and threw her hair back rather dramatically. “Stop being pessimistic, Draco. Do something to get out of this depressive mood you’re in. Maybe go to bed, darling. A new day might give you new ideas or at least a little break.”
Ernest Macmillan
Ginny chuckled. “She’d never get suspicious. One of her many amazing traits.” Nevertheless, she still kissed his cheek and waved goodbye.
Millicent looked up and frowned slightly. “Outside. Why?”
“Fe-taal!”
Harry sighed. “Well, D... Malfoy did say, that he found me wandering the hallways, right? I went for some coffee at seven, but I was too tired and...” he shrugged his shoulders. “... and I got lost.”
Chuckling, Harry winked at him and shrugged his shoulders. “You’ve seen me train all throughout Hogwarts, Olly, there’s nothing new!”
Potter had watched him closely and raised his eyebrows. “Well?”
“So, this is how it’s going to go?! We broke up and now you’re already moving on to the next person?!” he asked venomously.
Daphne, Ernest and Parvati sat in a small circle closer to the water, whispering and sometimes throwing the odd look towards Harry. Padma, Millicent, Susan and Pansy had formed a girl’s club surrounding one of the picnic tables and shooing all the men away, but waving towards Hanna and Megan who just now walked closer to the group outside. They too seemed to be discussing the events that had taken place this afternoon.
His husband nodded and pressed a soft kiss on his forehead, over his scar. “I love you, Harry. And for the last time for now: I’m sorry.” He smiled, knowing full well that Harry didn’t like him apologizing too much, but he was clearly still too annoyed at himself to let that go.
Harry smiled and sighed, remembering Hermione giving him that stupid potion, which made him shake his head. Fleur frowned at him, before she sat down at the kitchen table and Harry followed, looking over at Dominique who was concentrating very much in her ferret.
“Draco, follow me please.”
Nicolai shrugged his shoulders. “Surprise me.” He smirked quickly. “But I will be taking this as a sign for what our future might hold. So choose wisely.”
The Healer chuckled and nodded. “I’ve been told there was a secret going on around the two of you.”
Harry placed his arms over his chest and raised an eyebrow. “You started all of this bullshit!” he said angrily and shook his head.
“Well, I do know quite a lot of people who do kind of owe me a few small favors.” Harry grinned and grabbed his phone.
With all due respect, you cannot just leave after the argument we’ve just had. I
“I haven’t starved to death, yet.”
Pressing a kiss on Draco’s temple, Harry motioned to the cage in his hand. “Ready for one final, big freak out? I’ll let you go to bed afterwards.”
Kira smirked. “Better than ever. He has gotten back onto the field and in Maiselle’s name, you should see him fight! He actually got back almost a fourth of what we lost in the last few centuries. It was awesome!”
