The simple Marauders map nickname the, was linked directly into the schools wards the first time it activated inside the castle. This link allowed the map to show a student's location and allowed them to select a person or a place by either writing out the persons name or describing/naming the place or by selecting it with their wand from a list of nearby or regularly visited places. It then gave you step by step directions to the person or place they wished to go.
"Well I had a 2.5 million galleon budget for both projects. I used 1.25 on each one and need about the same for both to finish, I can however wait until January and my next investment stipend to resume work." Harry sullenly answered.
“Yes, Severus my spy informed me that Potter left the safety of the wards surrounding his home. I was also informed that he went to Diagon Alley. What more can you tell me my slippery little friend?”
“I do wish, are either of you interested in the pyramids I can show you around a few?” Alomar asked his eyes on Harry as he smiled.
“By all accounts,” Alexander continued. “Sirius was promptly arrested for treason upon arrival at the ministry. I objected to this and asked on what basis or evidence that these charges were leveled, only to have an Auror spit in my face and inform me that it was not the business of a foreigner to meddle in the affairs of their betters. I was promptly escorted out of the building, I immediately called Tonks and Apolline to inform them of the developments.”
“I’m not sure but growing charms, anti-stain, anti-tripping, warming charms and I’m not sure what else, what would you suggest?” asked Harry.
"You go too far Lord Le-Fay. I suggest you remember your own place in this discussion, and among the kings court." Harry answers.
“Yes, boy get on with it.” Snapped portrait farther down the room. “Good gracious, let us hope your not the next heir Potter. You would fail before you even began.” Shocked then angered by the man’s words Harry focused, straightened his back and called the family magic around him.
"Not going to happen, as I've already met him and I didn't freak out then, but it is illuminating that the prophet went back to the "let's call him crazy mode"." Harry said pulling out his calling mirror saying "Andromeda Tonks."
“Now, let us go through the list of returned items. I assume the family Grimoire was among them.” Harry Potter said as a Goblin walked through the door and handed him the bag of galleons he had requested earlier.
Harry wound his arm around the slim waist and pulled the pliant body on his lap. He quickly adjusted Draco to have him leaning on Harry's front while hands wound around Draco's waist.
This time , Draco's cheeks really puffed. As he frowned and glared at the man . Seeing this the man howled without reservation . An act of truly accepting someone as family .
Taking out several potions he ideally made , he fed Harry a potion to replenish his health and another nutrient potion . Finally done , he stood up and looked down at the unconscious Potter . Now that Potter was asleep , it was the perfect time to slip out  and avoid disclosing anymore than he already did . He did not care from where Potter learnt to perform wandless magic . For all he cared , it was the best as long as he did not interface with Draco's life .
Draco's thoughts were rapidly derailing from the sane track to the track of what people of 2020 call 'shipping'. Then suddenly, a lightbulb appeared on his head .
He tremblingly moved to turn around but froze when he felt a cold breath on his back. His mouth opened to scream. But before he could , his body was forcibly pushed down and a spell hit him. He very clearly felt the sting on his nape as his limbs spread apart like a stick figure and bound in place. It was a body-binding spell.
Harry's hands were holding onto his waist in a bruising grip. They pinched his hip tight to trap him there, to block his escape. His wrists were pinned above his head and legs forced apart by Harry's body.
The look in Draco's eyes intensified as he heard these words . He was sure that with this he had exhausted all his good luck points in Merlin's bank . But it was worth it .
" Thus, the blood pact is sealed . And with this , it will remain till the end of eternity, to break it shall mean to cease from existence, your soul and body, to keep it means to cherish the bond formed "
" please ! You don't understand ! I am a half-blood ! My father was a wizard. He worked in this ministry for 20 years. I- I always wear his coat. I still wear it. Please !"
His face twisted with the thought. No ….not likely then what ? Ron couldn't think of anything else. Without even him realising his chance came to enter the ….toilet ….
Minutes passed but neither gave up. Draco could feel his muscles weaken due to his lack of energy, could feel Harry's grip bruising his arms. His eyes burned but, he did not know if it was from anger or pain at his situation. It was as if years of emotions which were choked up in his heart, all threatened to break free. They were clogging up his throat and pooling in his eyes. The dam he had built around his emotions was starting to overflow. With its opening shut tight, refusing to let even a drop escape, the dam was filled to the brim, threatening to shatter completely. As the first crack appeared, the first drop slid down the sickly pale cheeks. More cracks appeared as more drops fell. Soon a part of the dam fell and a strangled voice echoed the infirmary. As the dam shattered completely, so did the struggles .
Hearing a silent 'tsk' from Draco as he shifted slightly to better accommodate the egg , Harry put his hand on his mouth to mute him for good . Snape , probably hearing the 'tsk' , had stopped walking and was now looking around . He kept his grip on Draco as he squirmed and struggled to get Harry's hands off him .
Giving him a worried glance but choosing to believe him , Blaise and Pansy continued their work . Unknown to them , Harry , who was seated just behind them , had heard their conversation and also seen Draco's smile , making his mood slightly better than before . It was better enough  that people did not run away seeing his face but not better enough that they will willingly stay there . Harry was not fully convinced by this , it seems . For the next days , He always had an eye on Draco , thoroughly observing him , searching for anything different .
Harry let his magic surround Draco trapping him there , unable to move . It crackled in the air around as it let Draco feel it's power . Draco was stunned at this .
Was this really saliva ? No , it was a sweet wine , delicious and inebriating. And he was addicted with just a taste .
" Courting is with the intention to marry, isn't it? I myself have never done so but I do know the proper customs. If you tell me at the start of your courting then I will be having sufficient time to collect a wealthy dowry till the wedding" ; Dumbledore rambled on with a happy expression.
Sounds rang out from the entire room , the splash of colors accompanying them. People ran here and there , some even hid under their desk. As chaos descended , Harry stealthily made his way into the office of Umbridge.
Without further ado, Draco fled towards Harry. He knew very clearly that offensive duels and such deadly fights weren't something he was proficient in. So, listening to Harry was his best chance to survive rather than playing on his own. He trusted Harry enough to get both of them unscathed out of here.
As Draco ran out, the bashful look in Harry's face faded and a mischievous and scheming smile rose. Blissfully and with a heart filled with sugar , he generously told Jarvis, " Expect a rise in your paycheck this month. "
Harry smiled, this time genuinely as he said ," How can that be? You still have to prepare the dowry for the wedding, won't you? Also, I am sure the next generation of Potters would like to see their great-grandfather."
Harry stoned his face as he stared at Draco with cold and unmoving eyes. Trying to unveil what he actually was .
His eyes held years of exhaustion but also shone an euphoric satisfaction. He slowly closed his eyes, ready to leave behind this materialistic world to ascend in the kingdom of souls.
were the words in Harry's mind . It was such a wonderful picture . Draco , in his house , waiting for him to come back home, Beautiful and soft only for him . This fantasy was immensely pleasurable even in just imagination.
Harry's eyes turned a horrifying green and his magic reached out to blow them away from Draco and pull him close to him . But before anything could happen , Draco stood up , firmly and calmly saying ," Wands down "
The overly excited egg swung itself so wide that it rolled off Draco's thigh, about to fall on the floor.
Harry stood still, his entire body stuck in place. He stood watching in a daze as Draco hugged the baby in his arms, as Draco's eyes lit with joy, as Draco called out to him.
Such a cute one Draco was . Calling him 'respected ancestor' . A perfect little Malfoy , was he ? It was amusing at the least , seeing Draco act like a child and a respectable Malfoy at the same time . He wanted to know exactly how cute  this little Malfoy can be .
Eyes gentle but words as harsh as knives. This is how Pansy was. Hermione understood this and didn't mind. Instead, she took the plate in Pansy's hands and carefully helped her take out all the fish bones before giving it back.
He stood there, sternly eyeing both the sides. His monotone voice forcefully suppressing both the sides as his magic worked behind the scene to suppress their magic flaring around as well, "Use your brains and shut up. There is no use to arguing now "
Dumbledore's words, Harry noticed, held a hint of relief. The only conclusion he believed possible was that Dumbledore knew about Draco's emotional state but didn't know what to do , so he chose to wait for either Draco or fate.
“For a daughter of any house, the highest point they can aspire to in house hierarchy unless they are a matriarchal line is Lady of the House. The reason for this is that they carry the children and it is believed that they should not do things like wage war, manage the political and family responsibilities, for the King and other such responsibilities. They needed to focus on the health of the household and on their children. Though that has changed over the years, many houses still are patriarchal and as such their position has not changed much, though they have been given many more freedoms to do as they please after marriage.”
"Understandable, I will allow you to continue your group work, my apologies for the interruption to your work." He answered.
As Harry relaxed into Sirius’s arms, he couldn’t help but think on the warmth he felt even from his magic when held by Sirius, it was a lot like when Viktor had hugged him on their last date. It made him smile, relaxing he answered the question. “House Potter didn’t just sacrifice our family gift; it bound half our family magics. The house of Potter has finally grown to be strong enough to gain ancestral status, yet as it’s grown the half claimed by the seal has grown to. Furthermore, having a seal allows us to know a bit more about them. All the seals are interlocked, if Grindelwald breaks the twelfth seal, all the other seals will eventually come unraveled to. When the ninth seal breaks the rest of house Potters house magics will be released.”
"Prerequisite locked means that you have a prerequisite to meet before you can take the mantle of lord. This could be any number of things, it could mean you have to already be a parent, it could mean you simply have to be 21, the guidelines should be available to you upon request from the goblins, but you must request it. Power locked, means that your core has not been through the proper rituals to connect with the house magics, a costly fix, as you have to use the goblins ritual rooms, and it's a series of 5 rituals altogether but necessary ones. My own test would have said such if my father had not undergone them with me after my birth."
4. Any student having been found to inherit any seats in the high court, those of Most Ancient, Most Noble, Utmost Ancient, or Utmost Noble, are only required to declare a single house of any rank. If the seat they inherit on the high court is an Ancestral title, they are only required to disclose this inheritance to their protectorate house.
"Indeed" said Serpentis "I do not see what there is to discuss the charter stands or the grounds go into lockdown, and we are forced to locate and guide the founders and Peverell heirs through blood Rites, to be able to remake a new charter, in the meantime the students here would have to be sent to other schools. As 5 of the Albion schools are here in Britain, the students would not have to much work to transfer."
"I suggest you hope he thinks the same" said a man coming up from behind him trailed by a middle aged lady with jet black hair and a severe face.
“Our neighboring kingdom, Salidia, has a foolish king at it’s head, he is greedy, boastful, new to ruling, this king too does not hold the favor of his people. I understand the general’s words that war is not the solution. Salidia however is coming into a season of transition, they have a split monarchy were a king rules for a partial year as a winter or summer king and then retires and allows the other king to rule for six months. The transition period is in less than a month the winter king have we have dealt with before ewe know what to expect from him. I do not think this new summer king will willingly pass the crown; he will cause civil war to keep the crown. We silence all trade or other goods and services with Salidia and then once the crown has transferred after the war is over, we deal in either peace or arms against the victor.” Draco understood what he said.
"Some respect for your father would be expected Draco he did raise you." Marvolo interjected admonishingly.
Corsair and Edward sat in the seats in the waiting room as Alrick and Harry walked on back. As the woman closed the doors to her office behind them, Harry switched back to his base form. Eliciting a raised eyebrow from the woman. “I was unaware that any held that gift here in Britain beyond my daughter, I can tell bt the way the shift happened that that was not a glamour.” She said.
"Well, for the second question, I left Britain before the fall of He-who-must-not-be-named, and left my son as Lord of the family, while I retained my rights as head. This summer I returned and found that some things had not been taken care of as they should have and have reprimanded my son. My son remains the Lord of the Malfoy family however, heir Nott was trying to save face and get his punishment lessened by showing me the respect my line is due. As it is not tradition to simply call someone head of house, he called me by the closest title, that of Lord. It is an etiquette we will get to around Samhain, or as a Muggleborn you would call it Halloween. As to the first question what is Albion, who has an answer for this, ah heir Malfoy?"
“I think so, you created blood rites as a stop gap from people just taking over as family head that had no training to handle the responsibility that such a position required. It’s why its only required for a family after they’ve developed to a certain point. You lived in a different age of magic, so I guess I understand what you mean about it being needed. I saw Harry just using a few family spells at the battle with Grindelwald and he nearly leveled the whole battlefield. It was frightening and he never reached for any arcane magic so I guess I can understand it. You were trying to put more of an importance on the responsibilities of the line rather than just on the power such a title got you.” Draco answered surprised.
"From most of you, yes. From Lord Le-Fay we wish to ask his aid in the clean-up and recovery, if we can find Grindelwald's remains, we can stall the panic across Albion with ease."
Harry nodded and woke. He slowly got up from where he had been laying in the center of the ritual Room. He quickly picked back up his wand, from the holster at the door, and his bedclothes from where they lay just outside the door. He promptly returned to his bedroom.
Overall it was a very uneventful trip for Harry he got everything he needed, and they stopped at the trunk shop and got Harry a multi-compartment trunk with the first and only regularly accessible compartment being storage space for regular items like his quidditch supplies and things like that. The remaining chambers where all blood locked. The 2nd chamber was a portion storage cupboard on one side that had an automatically updated book that told you how much of everything you had, on the other was a ritual ingredient cupboard also with an automatically updating inventory book. The third compartment was a full walk-in closet, the size of the 3rd & 4th years boys’ dormitories at Hogwarts put together. The fourth compartment was an entire Library that after his visit to the Bookstore’s he had to return for the second and third expansion packs so that all his new books didn’t take up half his library. It also had an Inventory book, though this one sorted by genre, category, topic, etcetera as you wrote in it search terms it would also summon those books to the front visible shelf. It now held up to 100,000 books rather than the 1,000 or 10,000 the first and secondary expansions had. But then again, he had gotten quite a deal on books, one of the bookstores he had entered had just bought an old family library of an Ancient and Most Noble house that had recently gone extinct. Harry had bought the entire library for half its worth because the store didn’t have room as it was the fourth one that month, he had then browsed the shelves and found more he wanted. By the time Harry left the Great Square for Potter Manor, he had spent almost 5,000 galleons, and it was nearing evening as they walked to the nearest apparition point. Alrick takes Harry’s arm, and together they apparate away to Potter Manor.
People looked at one Harry James Potter and saw many things. Many saw him as his father’s exact replica but with his mother’s eyes, few looked farther and realized that this was not true. For in Harry James Potter lived an amalgamation of features. For the few that looked closer, and who knew the legacy they that while Harry had his mother’s bright emerald eyes and his father’s unruly raven hair, he had his paternal Grandmother’s high aristocratic cheekbones, and his maternal Grandmother’s build. If one were to look carefully, they would almost see other features that did not to come from either Lily or James, for the originators of those features, you would have to look much farther back into his family tree.
"Lord Longbottom, Lord Potter, I would ask your aid as well as the aid of the men beneath you, the vassals of both your houses would be helpful in this."
"Tut, tut, that won't do, when I say good afternoon, you are to respond with Good afternoon professor, let's try again, Good Afternoon class."
Last Saturday Rita had finally released his and Viktor's interviews and Harry had taken to spelling the part of his sleeve that cover the armband invisible simply so people would stop asking about it.
“With the grandeur of the other Potter properties, I would think not.” Says Consair sneering at the room in front of him. “With all that they were paid you would think they would have been able to give you better accommodations than this.”
"Done, though I now understand why asking Abraxas grandson would not also give you this information. I'm surprised you have not had miss Parkinson or Greengrass spying on the boy with all honesty. It was after all the group study session you assigned them to that my info comes from. It seems that the Gryffindor know-it-all, Miss. Granger was pushing for them to complete the extra credit question."
“You have no idea what you have truly wrought upon yourselves and I have no desire to inform you of all of it. If this is the folly the house of Malfoy has become, then I desire no part of it.” Michalis said and turned from the outside of her portrait. Outside in the hall the adults quickly cleared, many of them taking their children with them until Draco was left alone staring at the portrait.
As Harry was carried into the hall, the peels of laughter and joy, that had come from students celebrating their victory tapered off. Artemis, and Neville, quickly found their way to Harry's side worry evident in their faces. "Viktor, floo St. Mungo's fetch the Potter family healer, Ted Tonks if you will." Neville asked before Lord Le-Fay pulled Neville from where he had knelt at Harry's side. Shaking Neville by the collar he roared.
"Well, to start off with, Gringotts requires you to give your account manager 1% of all dividends made. Make it more than that, and make it tiered so that the harder he works not only does the money from his initial percentage rise but if he reaches a certain point, he also gets a percentage increase. It makes your manager want to work harder, and to stop giving you excuses, this will also make him more willing to go for riskier investments but only ones they know will go well, that will significantly help. Secondly don't exclusively invest only in the Magical world. House Potter has something a bit similar and I am going through a bit of the same thing. I invested into about four blocks worth of old rundown factories in London. They aren't worth much now, but they've been rezoned as residential and I'm building a bunch of apartment complexes, and other buildings on them. After buying the land, demolishing the buildings, and the cleanup of those lots along my other project however, I have to wait for my next investment deposit to move to the next stage, which counts against me. But it's expected for me to make about a million year once it's done and as I can also speed it up a little by using magic."
I second that says Delores I will not be changing how I teach to that document after all the ministry I'm sure will deal with charter matter. With that, the teachers left.
Sirius stepping over to the table of food filled a plate before returning to standing before the fire. "On this day we honor you the dead, in your life you taught us much, but it is only in your death that we can understand all that you have taught us. To James Potter I called you brother in life for we were closer than my own brother and I." at this as Sirius dropped food into the flames, the flames that had previously been lit now showed the face of James Potter as Sirius so often remembered him. "You taught me to laugh, you showed me the love of a home and I will always remember that. Lilly Potter nee Evans you taught about love and what true honor was, you showed me a path that could be walked different than those pushed at me by others you were a true sister to me and I will never forget you." Sirius dropped more food into the fire, it shifted to show Lilly's face. The fire would cycle through the faces of those that would be honored with offerings and words by different people throughout the night.
Draco walked over and finding a vine against the wall larger around than his wrist, with the silver gold flowers that Silas had spoken of grabbed it and with a flash of light he was gone again. Draco opened his eyes once more to find himself on a great field with a man walking towards him. Draco stood waiting as the man approached. The man got close and promptly sat down on the grass motioning Draco to sit as well.
In doing so the minister has given the High Inquisitor the duty of ensuring that Hogwarts is teaching to the proper guidelines. That all teachers have appropriate credentials to be teaching at Hogwarts and to enforce several other rules that the Ministry intends to enforce later in the coming months. For more Information see page 3.
"Very well so long as you understand the cost of my unjust expulsion. Firstly, Hogwarts will face its first ICW mandated hearing in over a century when 150 students leave the school with me, which will be a black mark on your record as headmaster forever. Secondly in the wake of said hearing, you Madame Umbridge, High Inquisitor or not, will no longer be teaching at Hogwarts. Though as half of the present teaching staff will be going with you, I fail to see it as a problem. Thirdly as I was expelled unjustly, the Hogwarts education fund set up by my family when Hogwarts fist opened its doors to those not of the Nobility, will be closed and all money in said fund will be once more returned to the Potter family vault. Lastly as this has happened and I have found myself expelled, the house of Potter, our wealth, and the majority of our businesses will be transferring from Britain to another Albion country as will all the children of our Vassals, no doubt of our allies, but most importantly the protectorates we have most recently taken into our home will also be removed from Hogwarts and the further stain on your record and legacy Dumbledore will be that the first Potter since the opening of Hogwarts to graduate from a school other than Hogwarts and we have a bad habit of once that happens not coming back."
It was revealed that the Gringotts shares being hidden from Harry, was one of the various treasonous acts committed by the former Goblins of Gringotts. For that and other things they would be given the traitor’s death, however rather than face their face some of them had escaped and were now being hunted down to be executed. As such Harry transferred some of the family’s wealth back to Gringotts, in exchange for all the vaults convenience fee’s being free for the next two centuries, or his death whichever happened last. However, feeling distrustful of the Goblins Harry only returned half of what had previously been in the Potter vaults and had placed the rest into both the Nome and Dwarven banks.
It was a stone room with a grey, almost black appearance with no windows and a wrought iron door. Torches lined the walls and there, in the middle of the room, was a humongous silver circle inlaid into the stone floor. Inside it was a 5 pointed star with each point merging into the circle. At each of these intersecting points were the materials needed to perform the ritual. In between the lines of the ring and the star were different runes to guide the magic with a big enough space for Harry to kneel down in. Taking the ritual knife from within the box given to him by Gringotts he then stripped and moved to complete the ritual.
“Harry and I checked it, both before we went out yesterday, and when we rose this morning there was nothing there, in either of our boxes, at least beyond the usual business paperwork.” Neville interjected.
Draco hesitates before continuing, "the middle houses aren't as old as the high houses. Their history is more common knowledge, you see more evidence that they exist, though they are also monsters of power and might, but they aren't the titans of magic that the high ancestral houses are. Traditionally the empire they serve under now is not the first empire they have served under, that goes for the high ancestral families as well. Taking into consideration that most of the current empires have only stood, as they stand now, for about 2 to 3 millennia. Those house are all older than 4 millennia, but they aren't the estimated at least 10 millennia of the high ancestral."
At noon Harry stopped and stretched, setting his papers full of notes aside. Mimsy quickly popped in with lunch which he quickly ate. After which Mimsy brought him his most recent mail, the letter from the dwarfs was the first to catch his attention.
Harry and Neville split up at the apparition point with Neville returning his home, while Harry invited Sirius to stay at Potter manor and to help introduce Harry to all of the family that was currently arriving at the manor.
With all of the excitement that had happened over the weekend, all of Gryffindor was at breakfast early on Monday morning as they wanted to discuss today's paper once they received it. As such was once again treated to the rare gift of absolute silence descending onto the Great Hall as the front page proudly declared:
Sirius casts a few severe privacy spells before handing Harry a copy of several tests, before continuing. "As you are aware this evening the Goblins did tests for a few of the hedge schools as well, but earlier this afternoon. A few have stood out and been immediately taken into the care of house Potter. In your hands is 7 such tests. Tyler Allen has been discovered to be the spare heir of house Slytherin, he is a muggleborn that was denied entry into Hogwarts. Andrew Silas, it seems has several inheritances, again he's a muggleborn that was denied entry into Hogwarts they all are. The interesting thing about him is that he's heir of two of Albions Utmost houses that went missing before the kings fall. Jason and Eliza Aarons are heirs of 2 lines apiece and coheirs of a third being twins. All five are Most Ancient status, only needing a few requirements to become Utmost Noble. Andros Mathews is the heir of two Ancient and Most Noble lines, one of which is Gryffindor. He's best friends with Andrew Silas. Kyle Sanders is the heir of Hufflepuff. Marcus Marron is the odd one, he's the heir of one line but the secondary heir to several lines and is best friends with Tyler Allen. Take a look at his paper." Harry looked down at Marcus's papers. Only his occlumency shields kept him from showing his shock. Marcus was not just a secondary heir to several powerful lines, he was secondary to two of Harry's own lines, Potter, and Pendragon. "Tyler and Marcus were in pretty bad situations and are going to certainly need some TLC from the house. I have already removed them from their previous guardians, and they are currently resting at Potter Manor recovery from some severe abuse." Sirius stated
"The fund affects no one Ministry madame, it affects the whole of the Empire, as such the House of Potter was in full rights to do as it has done. Furthermore the minister cannot simply silence it, or annul it. It will be proudly showcase in every Gringotts and the Ministry does not have enough foreign support to block it. Ten points to Gryffindor for cunning, and a further 10 points for thinking things through." Said Abraxas Malfoy, Harry smiled and went back to his breakfast. His eyes alight with pride.
5.	At any point in time, these students are permitted to request tutors for any classes they are attending and summarily drop that class with the Hogwarts Professor.
“That might be helpful.” Harry agreed his anger of what Dumbledore had done simmering beneath the surface.
"As I said before this one has as of July 31st been marked as deactivated so it's not something you have to worry about." Croaker answered.
Alrick led the way down the street passing all manner of stores as they went until they got to an area that wasn’t exactly shopping for goods, but for services. They kept going until they came to a building that had a sign proudly proclaiming “Tonks Law offices.” Entering the office, they found themselves in a modern-day waiting room with chairs and a secretary sitting behind a desk. She looked up as they came in. “How may we help you today?” She asked.
Sitting in the house below, was his aunt Alexandria and his Uncle Vladimir Ivanov, their children Alexi, Sofia, and Adrian. Alexi was married to Selena and had 4 children Vladimir age 16, Artemis age 14, Elena age 10, and Audrey age 8. Sofia married Demyan Abelev, they had two children, Zivan, and Vlas who are 12 and are twins. Adrian was married to Zhanna Medvedev, and they had three children. Yuri age 16, Arsenio age 14, and Donat age 12. Harry couldn’t wait to meet them.
Sirius gaped for a moment as did Neville, not quite certain what to say after all Ignatius Potter was known among even the Slytherin house as being a man with enough cunning to stand toe to toe with their own house founder and win in a battle of wits, and he was to be Harry's political guardian, it was awe inspiring. "Well a list of things really. A tome of rare dark magic from the black family library, 200 billion galleons or half the black fortune, and" Sirius stopped as Harry started shaking his head.
Receiving the letter from the dwarves of the about the basilisk and being notified as to the amounts rendered from the carcass, Harry accepted the offer for the Swiss Dwarves to in a joint operation with the Nomes hold 20 different auctions selling of 50% of the Basilisk. With one auction every 3 months for the next five years, and approximately a million to 5 million galleons being added to the Potter vaults after every auction he new that the Potter house had no monetary issues to concern itself with. However, looking at the numbers a regular 20 ft Basilisk yielded after being rendered Harry had decided concerning the Basilisk eggs.
"What shall I do with my troops once they are mobilized, shall they be stationed only at the local bases or shall they be moved to strategic points around the empire?" Harry asked treating this as a real issue.
“That would be an immense pleasure.” Harry answered. With that the three left the patio ready for a day of adventure.
Neville spoke up and gave his offering next. "James Potter you were my godfather you were taken from us before you could fully embody that title. Yet as I stand here today beside your son, my own godbrother I hope that wherever you may be, that you are laughing besides those of our line that have gone before. May we as godbrothers honor your legacy and through you the legacy of our Houses."
“Yes Headmaster, it seems he entered the alley about 9 o’clock and left about 11 o’clock. He visited the 3 bookshops for Owl Order Catalogs and Gringotts assumedly for money. However, most of his time today was spent within Gringotts.” Answered Kingsley.
"If the charter had been removed then the founders magic in Hogwarts would have faded Hermione. No more hat, no points system, no sorting, no houses, none of it, Hogwarts can't function without the charter in place. The castle itself would transfer back to being Peverell lands if the Hogwarts Charter was removed." Replied Neville.
“You were a beautiful baby Harry, and I saw no harm in asking your dad for permission to blood adopt, you were already proving that you would be strong. So, I adopted you, made you part black, and I think it was then that I became tied by fate. I accepted it later once I escaped prison, the other two pieces had already happened at least under a king’s banner I could better protect you, then you showed me your test. I didn’t want you to be king, call it selfishness but your kindness, your smile, the heart of innocence you hold, I didn’t want to share, because the realm chose that you were to be the next Pendragon. So, I reassured you when the time came. But sitting here today I can only think of the last thing she told me. She said, “Sirius Orion Black, you will see the rise of a king, you will help forge him, and your greatest joy shall be seeing him crowned.” I wish that I could see you crowned Harry, even if it meant you were king then I know your heart wouldn’t be breaking.” Sirius stopped here as two guards entered the room.
“Silas and Michalis Malfoy, Michalis was a bearer that found Silas favorable, I don’t know much about them beyond that. Father always told me it wasn’t history I needed to focus on, and that if I was truly interested, I could look through the family Grimoires after I became Lord Malfoy.” Draco answered.
"If you fail, Blood Rites then your house will at the very least be unable to go through the test for that house for 2 generations. The harshest punishments will be either the binding of your magic, or your death. If you have more than one house that you are testing for those last you will not happen unless the amount you fail is more than the amount you pass. Even then it is rare for those last two to happen if you have more than one house you are testing. There are other punishments but those are the ones that happen most often."
"Well, I wish to see you improve but no I wish to achieve the rank of Knight for my family's honor once more. Rumors abound throughout Albion already of the sorting hats warning that our king returns, if that is so then I wish for the house of Krum to be well placed to sit as a Knight in the Kings court, perhaps if I train hard enough I could place even among the twelve inner knights of Albion." At this Sirius and Harry exchange a look. "I would give you warning as well though, Heir Potter. There are those that see your house and that of your brothers as week and that in that, they can claim a higher rank for their own houses."
Despite all that Harry said that the week had gone well, and that he was glad for his friend's advice to get homework done as soon as possible, as by time the end of September hit, those who had been slacking where overwhelmed by the assignment load for the year. Overall Harry's first week of school went rather well.
"Well we have all had an interesting week. A reminder of the ground rules before we begin the discussion. If someone else is talking please do not interrupt them unless it is to clarify what the just said. I will take points, next stay on topic, if we need to jump topics or you feel the class needs to understand something first before you can answer say something then you may do so. Third make sure the questions you ask relate to either current events or what we are studying in class. Let's begin, stand if you have a question to ask." Several different students rose that all promptly sat down when Hermione stood up blushing as they all sat down. "Well miss Granger it appears that the floor is now yours."
"After Blacks back in Azkaban I assume the auction for bonding Rites to happen at 17 will begin?" asked another.
The house of Slytherin was practically worshiped in his house to find the heir of the only house that the house of Slytherin feared was the one that his parents and Lord Le-Fay was attacking had honestly scared him. Draco glanced up and looked at Harry who he saw was also looking straight at him. He nodded to him before focusing on his own thoughts. It wasn’t long before they arrived at the station. After exiting the station Harry and Neville both left for two days with their families before leaving for Egypt on Monday.
So, Neville’s magic let it be seen the blocking of him from his wizard and every push since to force him through the block. All the belittling and abuse his wizard suffered. All the pain his wizard has felt and had to deal with, but also the warmth. Especially by the one boy, his magic cried too, but he tried his best to help Neville.
“Dexby bes taking Master Harry sirs and Guest’s up to the manor sirs.” The house elf says as the air grows suddenly colder. All look around for the source of the chill when Edward suddenly shouts.
“I am sorry to hear that, I came with no intention of changing allegiances, I apologize your majesty if this offends you, but I am needed still in Albion.” Harry answered.
“Yes, Hermione that means that Harry is now the head of an Utmost house,” turning to Harry, Draco asks. “So, when will it hit the papers?”
"Lucius Malfoy did many things to me and for me Lord Le-Fay raising me was not among them, he was to busy chasing after power, for his family to be of any use to him." Draco retorted before turning back to Harry. "I'm assuming you have a few more things to say, I'll leave you to it and just inform the tutor that you will be running late. I'll see you either in Potions or in the library after for Ancient Runes study later I have the notes for you from Arithmancy and Ancient Runes yesterday." With that Draco left the great hall leaving Harry alone with the adults.
AN: Cliffhanger, I know I hate them to, but it only means you must wait for the next chapter. No, I can honestly say I am not sorry. Sorry? Anyways I apologize now that this chapter is a bit short, it just really did not want to be written. Now for all of you throwing a fit that Sirius is dead, wait and hold on a minute. Without giving away any spoilers I will say that this is not the end of Sirius Orion Black. Really, this twist has been waiting in the wings since I wrote like the second chapter. I’ve built Harry up on the point that he really doesn’t want to be king of Albion. And this Harry really does not want to be king he is satisfied just protecting his own. So, without giving away any spoilers I changed things up a little. If anyone can read between the lines, I have dropped a little bit of foreshadowing around in the previous chapters. So, if you go back and reread a little you may know what happened to Sirius. P.M. if you think you’ve got the right answer, I’ll give you a shout out if you get it right. So long and I’ll see you in the next chapter.
In Hogsmeade, Harry spent the morning and early afternoon shopping and enjoying the day off. It was as a fair group of them sat in a booth at Madam Rosmerta's, that the day turned sour. The sudden appearance of a black knight startled people, the knight pressed close to both Neville and Harry to pass on his news. "Grindelwald has left Russia, as much as we can tell he is headed here to Hogwarts, he brings with him almost half a battalion of Russian troops, and many of those that escaped with him from Nurmengard."
Draco pauses to take a breath and sip a drink of water, before continuing. " After fiver generations of house status, the house is given the title of honorable, but is still a common house. The house title of the commoner houses are Honorable, Most Honorable, Elder and Most Elder. At the time that they gain the title of Most Elder House they are at 12 generations since the creation of the house, or about 330 years old. The Noble class begins with the granting of the title Noble, at 15 generations or 420 years old. At this point they are also granted there first seat in the lower court. The low court only holds 40 seats for the Noble houses, so they are rotated each year, as there are more than 40 actual Noble houses. At thirty generations they are given the title of Ancient. Ancient and Noble houses hold two seats on the lower Wizengamot. As the Wizengamot only holds 50 available seats they to rotate."
Harry merely nodded and greeted his guests, before asking if the meal could be served. Throughout the meal Harry felt warm inside despite the teasing from the four Weasley brothers. Looking at Sirius he realized what it was and smiled, so this was what it liked to have a family.
"I have Hermione, Albus Dumbledore has set himself up as a King of Britain. I am a Potter, and as such I will permit no king that does not have a true claim to the Pendragon seat, to rule any of her territories."
"You are comparing this study to the Potter study at Potter Manor, and simply believe this is an earlier version of that study. It is not, this study was the foundation upon which that study was designed, not simply what it once was. Can you guess where we are?" The man probed. Harry going to stand beside him looked out the window into the courtyard below, and suddenly he knew where he was. He had once in his dreams, trained in that courtyard down below, he had studied tactics in these halls, he was at Dragons Moor. "I see that you do, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Ignatius Potter and under my watch, as Lord Potter the house became Most Ancient and Most Noble coming up from merely being Ancient and Noble. I was known to be one of the most politically active Potters in the history of the family for good reason."
Winter’s Watch, true to its name, was very wintery. Very wintery and definitely the sort of place couples would go on dates. Harry had to admit Luanne had very good taste in romantic spots. Just not the people to go there with. Krum was going to have a good laugh at Ron’s expense at the family dinner - that Harry would make sure of.
Mrs Weasley turned back to him. This time, she had a handful of carrots. “Can you cut these for me? I can’t move from the stove for a while and if we want carrot cake we must have carrots, right?”
“Mother,” Draco says, finally. “Mother and father will be in grave danger if I don’t go back. I don’t want to be responsible for their sufferings.”
“It's got warming charms weaved in and… you didn't have a coat or anything so I thought…” He trailed, looking away. “I couldn’t be seen with a parka-less peasant like you!” Malfoy snapped at the last minute, remembering himself at last.
Draco rolls his eyes. “No, I’m chopping strawberries. Honestly, Potter, maybe its time you got yourself some new glasses.”
"Ron and I need tutoring in Herbology and since Terry and Kevin are on that Bulgarian exchange programme we thought it might be easier to do it in Ron's dorm." He explains, hoping Seamus wouldn’t see through him like Dean did.
Draco smiled at him, eyes still closed. His hair was tousled and there were marks on his cheek from the pillow. Draco’s silk pyjama shirt had come unbuttoned halfway through the night, probably because Harry was too busy blushing to check if he’d buttoned them right.
At that moment Draco looked very much like a sleepy ferret - and it made Harry’s heart do loop-de-loops.
He edged closer, the floorboards creaking under his trainers. Harry placed his hand on the doorknob.
Yet, he couldn’t bring himself to get a new wand. Not while he had Draco’s. Not until he returned it.
Luanne and Ron were up at front, her dark head resting on a red-faced Ron’s shoulder. Merlin, Krum was going to have a field day.
Mrs Weasley seemed to be leaving, so Draco pulled out whatever courage he had inside him and stopped her.
Seamus approaches him in the Great Hall, looking too much like a kicked crup for Harry's liking. "You guys are having a  sleepover and didn’t invite me?" He said, doe eyed as ever.
She dramatically flops into Charlie’s chest, hand on her forehead. Charlie just blank-facedly pushes his best friend off.
“They meant for me to kill Dumbledore last year. He’d picked me for a task he was sure I’d fail. To punish my father. To humiliate us. It didn't work out for some reason.” Draco said.
Malfoy snorted, and Harry was glad the lights were off because he might have punched the git if they weren’t. “Shit.”
Back with another HP fanfic. Just wanted my boys to have some fun. Draco and Harry badly need some care, poor babies.
He’d been trying to avoid rowing with Malfoy ever since Toasty died. In retrospect the git’s been acting even more annoying than usual. “Maybe you should talk to the portrait again. Walburga let you guys fix up downstairs didn’t she?”
Harry found he quite liked the new décor. Sirius mentioned Malfoy sweet-talking Walburga into letting them fix the house up. Yeah, Harry could see the ponce doing that. Disgusting. Ickle Draco and auntie Walburga.
Nothing in the cannon changes. These few weeks the kids spent in Grimmo was like a hole in the universe where all is happy, where time doesn't exist, sort of, but as soon as you leave, it feels like nothing changes. You're the only one that remembers the time you spent in there.
The sky, as always, was littered with stars too close for something too far to touch. Like Draco. The winter air made their breath curl white like smoke from a dragon. Like Draco. The gentle shower of snow was too delicate to have made an impact, yet it left Harry shiverin all the same. Like Draco.
When the boy in front of him bites his lip and looks away before unbuttoning his shirt, Harry thinks it might be the Dark Mark, or even Sectumsempra scars, that Draco might want to show him.
"Fine," he rolled his eyes. "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. Now move over, I want to be the bank."
“You know, sometimes love leaves you, even when it’s right.” Sirius put an arm around him. Harry let himself find refuge in the familiar and comforting smell of magnolia and dog Sirius carried.
Seamus had taken up an apprenticeship under renowned Pyrotechnician, Damini Inigo, which meant he was probably out blowing stuff up at the moment.
“I’d like to try doing it without magic,” Draco told him, looking very soft and not at all like a pointy git.
Molly Weasley takes her to leave, but not before telling him to get some rest. “You can come down to the kitchens to help me out in the afternoon.” She’d said.
Maybe it's this terribly sad fic that I've been reading. Lol. Also I might be changing this chapter because I'm not throughly satisfied. It's a maybe, though.
“Going to sleep.” He said, simply. The sentence felt incomplete without a ‘duh’ at the end, but Harry knew better than to expect Malfoy of all people to say ‘duh’. “Wouldn’t want me to have a cramped neck now would we?” Ah. There it was. The Malfoy bit.
Malfoy had been quick to point out Sirius had in fact, always been barmy and Harry was just too oblivious to notice.
A trip back home, and then he was padding back to the alleyway again. Lighting shook above him as pellets of rain damped his coat. Not even that could shake his resolve now.
“Oi, ‘arry,” he suddenly whispered. Harry hadn’t known Draco was awake too. Exactly how long had he been up?
“Something’s forcing you to go,” Sirius concludes. He wraps his hands around Draco’s icy cold ones. “Is it something you can’t tell me?”
The map, a whole month of silence to become Animagi, James chasing after Lily like deer after doe; all of it made Harry very happy, but also quite barren. Bare. Because listening to the stories would never be the same. He’d never be able to experience it. To feel what they felt. To feel like they were with him.
Harry found his godfather behind him. Sirius had deep purple pockets under his eyes. He looked thirty years older and so, so very exhausted.
"Ok, I'm not going to say I understand that but without taking that into consideration which house would ascend next?" Hermione persisted.
"Tom Marvolo Riddle it's an anagram for "I am Lord Voldemort'." Answered Harry looked intrigued by that and no one commented further on the matter.
“Now I wish for all of you without families of your own yet to go sit your stand next to your parents. It will enable me to put names with the faces of those I see before me. Next, I would like to go around the room at this time I will permit you to present yourselves to me. Present only do not fallow this rule, and you will find yourself silenced. Fleur, your family, may begin.”
Neville spoke next. “My house follows suit you have paid grave insult to my brother in all but blood. Therefore, I declare all alliances between our Houses at this moment broken, all contracts are null and void. If house Potter finds grounds for Blood feud House Longbottom will follow.”
As the Goblins considered Basilisk meat a delicacy, it had been mentioned to Ragnok, whether he would be attending. Discovering he had not been invited to such an auction had angered the Goblin and he had written the dwarves who had informed them it was the seller who had cut the goblins out refusing to sell to them. Discovering said clients name had seen the Goblin High King writing Harry.
“How dare you, wizard how we goblins fill our fealty oath to the Pendragon line, matters only to an Albion King and that king will not be Pendragon but Le-Fay. I should kill you where you stand.” Narlfist started.
“Draco, know is really not the time to disobey your parents this isn’t a joke.” Blaise answered as a goblin strode into the room. A goblin that caused mumblings to go through the room.
"Other houses will no doubt contact house Potter for approval for protectorate rights. We can make it a requirement that part of that goes hand in hand with how much you contribute." Stated Alexander.
On Wednesday Sirius returned and he and Harry spent the day together learning about each other and putting everything in place for the following day. As Harry went to bed that night curled up in his Paddy’s arms he was all smiles well prepared for the coming day.
“The Potter lordship ring has been brought up, as has the Black Heirship ring as you have requested. The Potter ring goes on the ring finger of your right hand and the Heir on the middle finger next to it.”
"Wonderful, Wonderful well let me know when we find him, and I'll send him a letter reminding him to stay at the Dursley's for now." Dumbledore says cordially, in the meantime I do have some business to take care of" and returns to his office. A quiet frenzy takes over the rest of the Order as everyone begins the search, no one noticing that one of Dumbledore's instruments tied to Harry is softly and slowly blinking.
Disclaimer: If you recognize it, it's probably not mine It all belongs to JK I'm just playing in her sandbox a little. I do read a lot of Fanfiction so if you see anything else you recognize I may have accidentally incorporated something.
"Potter hasn't an ounce of cunning in him, he is nothing more than a brash, arrogant, Gryffindor no matter how you look at it, he is unsuited for…" Severus Snape was abruptly cut off by the hat.
"Potter, House Potter ended its service of five hundred and fifty years to the house of Evanshade five years before the death of the last king. Evanshade's last lord fell to death during the fall of said king, and the house has stood without a head since then." Draco answered. "It's why so many houses have tried to ally themselves with house Potter, it wasn't even 1500 years old yet, but had successfully ended its required ancestral service to the Black house to boot and ended it without any casualties or sacrifice. Stories say that they had even made an alliance with another ancestral house, though it isn't known what the house is. It's why even today so many have begun distancing themselves from Bones and her lot. She's made an enemy of what could quite possibly be the first Albion house in over six hundred years to achieve the title of Utmost."
The final lost branch of Roman Magic was one that house Potter was uniquely masters of. Roman Battle magic was second to none throughout the world, it could pull enormous feats of magic from its wielders, and more importantly had aided Rome in securing its empire. In the modern day Rome's battle Magic is more myth and legend, than fact but to this day some still speculated whether or not Saxon battle magic that Albion so prided itself with, could match up to its Roman predecessor.
Harry's question sounded like an accusation to Draco , so he answered with all his fervour ," I told you . I don't know . All I did was give him some of my blood now and then "
Even if she desperately wanted to deceive herself, Hermione knew that she couldn't. In her heart, she knew that-
Kreacher slowly looked at Draco and respectfully asked , Kreacher....wants to ….ask Young master ...so~mething. "
Mundungus slowly walked around the dining table in the middle of the dining room , " What are you trying to do ? Sending these wretched house elves to kidnap me , are you ? "
Before leaving, Draco quickly took out eggie from his portable ring to give him his share of breakfast . As he watched his warm blood fulfilled the appetite of this small being he cherished. He had come to care of eggie quite too much. Who wouldn't  love this Ball of pure cuteness ?! Even Draco wasn't resilient to eggie's charm.
"I don't understand many things in here , like what does embedding the magic into the skin and nerve means ? Also there is no specific information or way to remove the mark ."
Draco felt a pair of hands circle him. Stunned, Draco instinctively struggled and the force increased, squashing him. Unable to move anymore, Draco gave up on getting free and focused on getting air .
The man looked at them with an expression as if planning to play with his favorite toys and said, "Well, well. Looks like my efforts in disciplining you wretched brats finally bore fruit."
Harry felt that if they were going to use corrosives, why not directly use the most effective ones, in their case, the most deadly ones ?
Harry was able to maintain his composure but the same did not apply to Draco. With gentler magic and healing properties , the pact magic wrock havoc in his body.
Draco was on his own on the edge of forbidden forest trying remedy spells on small injured and infected animals .
Harry forcefully jerked his own hand and took on the cold and hard mask he had when in the company of others.
And the top of eggie's shell broke off completely, flying away to fall right on Harry's face, as if trying to wake him up.
The voice saw this sight with his invisible eyes and huffed but compromised and continued in a wronged childlike tone, giving people an unshakable urge to coax, if not for the voice indicating that the person was at the age of one's grandpa.
Her eyes followed Pansy's furious gaze. Shock filtered through her eyes at the scene before quickly turning normal.
The afternoon sky faded to the evening orange. Harry and Draco discussed the ways to destroy the horcrux for a long time. Concluding that right now, the only option left was for them is to carry it with them before finding a way to finish it for once and for all.
As Harry sat beside Draco , gazing at his sleeping form, He himself felt his exhaustion creeping up on him. The past months have been hectic for him. Not to mention that the magic he used that day at the astronomy tower was immense and still hasn't recovered. Over that, aparating a distance as large as he did tonight is quite tiring as well. A good sleep with a warm and soft Draco in his arms can never feel better , it will only feel the absolute best.
Headmaster was situated in the guest room as soon as they came here. A group of house elves were stationed here as well, tasked with looking after the house and the headmaster.
Her eyes lingered on how Harry held Draco, tenderly yet entirely shadowing him, showing absolute possession.
His behaviour was confident and relaxed as if nothing happened but Harry didn't miss the jittery and unsettled gleam in his eyes.
Getting up, Draco led Harry towards the unconscious body . Saying as they neared it , " He had already fainted when we fell. I checked and found that it was because of a poison , an advanced draught of living death . "
That was what Van Dyke did to Clarisse when he wanted her to declare her love for him.  Except she professed her undying love for Abram instead of Van Dyke. Plot twists really were something.
Harry figures if he runs fast enough he might be able to reach the apparition point and then  grab an international portkey to
“That’s not even a movie!” Blaise launches the offensive. “Even Gregory’s Girl is better than that one.”
Because we need something soft after all that tension. Here's Harry mid-gay crisis and Draco who wants to say thank you (and patch things up with Harry, but he needn't know that) + Harry having a (tiny) mother-hen moment.
Little Teddy made their lives even brighter, with the occasional sleepovers with Tonks adding to the cheer.
“He said he doesn’t transform, but Fenrir’s venom might still be affecting him somehow.” Remus rasps. “There’s not enough wolf in him to be able to transform, but I bet it’s tearing every muscle of his from the inside.”
“Malfoy.” Potter didn’t look angry. Only… resigned. “Just…” He ran a hand through his hair, making Draco’s mouth go dry. “Just, try not to be too much of a git to your host family, will you?”
Sirius saw memories flash by of himself, barely sixteen. Hiding in pubs and sleeping under bridges until James rescued him. How much he cried when Euphemia hugged him and called him her son. James standing up for him when they all sneered at the runaway. Being given a
And he was supposed to focus on contraception potions for plants or whatever. Isn’t more baby plants the point of Herbology?
“You know why Remus left his job.” He continued when he got a nod from the other male. “I’ll have you know I won’t tolerate a word against him. Family or no.”
Sirius wiped tears from his eyes, which Harry thought a bit unnecessary. Then again, this was his godfather they were talking about. “Well,” Sirius sputtered, still laughing. “It’s just that-that…” He wheezed.
Ginny had been cool about it, but Harry later learned that she’d shut herself in the room and refused to come out. He’d caught her rummaging the fridge one nightmare ago and promptly gone back to Ron’s room.
“I guess I sort of ruined your perfect Christmas plans, didn’t I?” Draco was leaning against Harry, his eyes glued to the dancing figures inside the snowglobe.
Maybe it was the way his eyelashes brushed his cheeks. Maybe it was the bleak winter sun against his pale hair. Perhaps it was his breath, warm on Harry’s arm. No. It had to be the faintest dusting of freckles on the other boy’s nose, that Harry made a mental note to tease Malfoy about later.
Teddy slept in Ocean Boudoir, where Andromeda Black once resided. The lines on the wallpaper seemed to move, like gentle waves tugging along a flat sea. Sometimes you could hear the sea breeze, lulling you into dreams of seagrass meadows.
Harry felt a grin tug at the ends of his lips. "Would you happen to have a secret stash of  alcohol and an unreasonable amount of knives?"
“I realize now that it’s not the things we do that makes Christmas perfect.” Harry continued. “It's the people we spend it with. And the memories you make with them.”
Draco turned a brilliant red, which Harry didn’t really think possible because he was already so flustered. It was so cute. And it was because of
Harry had no problem telling him so either. "You idiot! You don't shove forks into toasters! You get electrocuted, and the power goes out." And if someone called Harry an idiot for stating the obvious, he'd let it slide.
Also Draco's POV is harder to write than I thought. I ended up with an absolute disaster of a kid lmao.
Lavender piped up. “May Parv and I partake in your Christmas activity as well?” She asks solemnly, though it was easy to tell she was suppressing a giggle.
At last, they hit a tree or something (another boulder?) and the snow broke away, freeing them from the ice cold vortex of death.
“Look,” Draco pointed at one of the stores. An antiques store. “Would you mind terribly if we made a quick stop there?” He made his eyes impossibly wide. It was irresistible.
Fleur half-drags Viktor, who is trying to wrestle Victorie off his hair. Bill follows, hand over his mouth.
Harry flinches when Draco makes a pained sound. Did he think the knight was going to hurt the dragon?
Unaware of Harry’s apparent crisis, Malfoy continues. "Well didn’t anyone tell you doormen were supposed to let people
Draco points at a group of stars. “There’s your godfather. The brightest star in the Canis Major. Some might even call it the dog star.”
"Not at all. In fact, it ticks the snow off my wish-list." said Harry. He really had put a lot of thought into the whole 'Perfect Christmas' thing.
“Trying to get us off of this muggle torture contraption alive, if you would.” Malfoy replied. He seemed to be gritting his teeth. And his knuckles were white from how tight he was holding on. Huh. At least Harry wasn’t the only one scared shitless. “Working it like I would a broom seems to help.”
Presently, Harry took in the scene around him and wondered if he somehow ended up in the wrong house.
it over and over again, but heal it when it comes close to dying. Were they still talking about Curiosity and the cat?
Teddy is such an important part of Harry's life, so I couldn't not have him. I wanted him to be Wolfstar's baby, but couldn't bear tear him away from Tonks, so now little Tedward has three (3) parents!!!
Malfoy nudged him, and Harry slid his plate over to him this time. The blond turned around to give Harry a blinding smile. It was nice.
“Yeah,” Draco was helping Harry ‘tame’ his hair. The latter of whom was still shirtless because “you don’t own anything that can be considered remotely formal except the kurta.”
Just as he was about to drag himself and his trunk back to Azkaban, Molly Weasely appeared. She was holding a staggering amount of shopping bags.
didn’t put anything in them. That French chocolatier guy said there was a little something  that would make you declare your feelings for your one true love?"
was the bloke Harry went to school with. The one who asked a first-year to teach him sewing so he could make himself a dementor costume to 'scare' Harry. The one who stayed up all night to make those ‘Potter Stinks’ badges.
Well, if turning on the light reveals a ginger-hell then Draco’s perfectly fine with living in the dark, thank you very much.
“I’ll take it, thanks.” Okay, Malfoy, no need to be so crabby. “Here comes Pomfrey to say we can go.”
Harry meekly folds the jumpers. Malfoy seems to think they’ll need an insane amount of socks and beanies. “Otherwise your toes and ears will fall off,” he’d said with a smile.
The Black sisters and Sirius and Regulus, all glaring at one another. Orion and Cygnus Black shaking their heads in the background. Their wives locked in fierce staring-contest.
Draco’d never been to the Weasley residence before, but he knew it well enough to recognise the topsy-turvy cottage. Even from a distance, it looked so utterly
The house looked the same, with the teal walls and golden finishes, but somehow, it felt dimmer. Like darkness had found its way into the house. Covered it like smog, thick and suffocating.
“What was the pattern on it before?” Harry leans his face closer, enjoying the way Malfoy couldn’t look him in the eye.
“G’night, Malfoy.” Harry muttered, putting a pillow on his head. It was so cold, even under such thick blankets.
Heads up for some mentions of Fenrir Greyback doing his bull and also past self harm. Lotta scars. Also it doesn't coincide with the HP timeline at all but idc about that.
He grips Draco’s shoulders and forces the boy to stare him in the eye. “Look into my eyes, and say it again.”
Harry could hear the ten year old monster now. It was growing stronger each second. “So this Shakshouka, it’s not for celebration, but for condolence?”
Night-time was made known by muggle streetlights illuminating the roads. The light didn’t quite reach their corner of the alleyway though.
I thought writing Harry's POV would be easy because Harry's got fucked up feelings and I've got fucked up feelings... but the problem is that neither of us know how to express them. I don't even know
There was a trickle of warm breath on his throat. “The boat’s here,” Malfoy looked apologetic and a bit awkward. He seemed to want to say something else. “And uh…” He produced a parka, very red, with fur lined around the hood.
was something you should be afraid of. That would end up in a conversation much more mind-boggling than the thing about spoons.
Potter was standing right next to him. “When did you get here?” Draco demanded. He wasn’t going to admit Potter scared the living daylights out of him.
“You can’t bring him home yet,” Their fingers intertwined, foreheads pressed together. “Look after him, find out what he’s doing out here.” Remus was right to worry.
It took everything in him not to cry when the bite mark on Draco’s wrist began to bleed, mixed with a terrible, puce-like violet poison.
Apparently,  Kevin McCallister was his favourite Kevin. Harry wondered if he should maybe have a  favourite Harry…
"I have a problem with forks and spoons too," Harry goes on. "I spent eleven years never knowing magic. Sometimes I forget I have a wand. It's easier for me to do things the muggle way."
If fact, Malfoy seemed to be… steering them? Since when was Malfoy an expert of sled riding? Was that something that happened to people? You get shoved down a mountain and suddenly you become adept at winter sports.
The way Draco turned all prickly and pointy in a matter of seconds was a bit frightening to watch, Harry had to admit. He’d thought Draco's just softened after the war or something. He’d softened, yes. But only when talking to Harry?
The two of them then turn to see Percy Weasley calmly sit on the chair. Tonks slumps while Charlie pouts a little. They slink down to lean against Fleur’s settee, looking chagrined.
Harry laughed. “Not much actually. We meet up every Saturday to watch Bollywood movies and... sometimes Padma goes off into her rants. I think you know how well that goes.”
The stroking stopped. The boy’s breathing evened and soft snores escaped his lips. Sirius sighed. He wasn’t going home tonight. Moony be damned.
And then there was more crying and comforting and spilling Shakshouka. Some more crying, a little bit of alcohol and then all four of them were cuddled on the too-small sofa. The quilt Draco used when Harry first came to No.12 was draped over them as they watched the Cradocks on the telly.
Yeah, the one his  grandmother gifted him last Christmas with a note saying 'you probably need a good pillow  after all that Nagini chopping' or something like that. Harry's not sure what exactly. Cursive  is hard to read.
“Well, how was I supposed to know that?” Malfoy hissed. "I was just trying to get the pastries out."
“Mister Potter,” Huh? Was Professor Sprout talking to him? “Can you explain how the Controlled Reproduction Draught works?”
Harry hates it when people apologize for his suffering. There was nothing they could have done to save him.
"You mean the one where they kiss near the top of the mountain because they thought they might never see each other again?"
Padma swallowed. “You bring strong arguments, pasty boy.” Sure, insult the person actually dishing out sense for once. Lavender was having a bad influence on the twins.
"Fuck you Potter." Malfoy grumbled. "May I ask of you to assist me in task for which I am inexperienced in doing?" He drawled. "Better?"
Harry blinked. Yes, the portrait still hung there. The décor was still bright and welcoming. The unidentified blond was still dozing under the blanket, without a care in the world.
That dragged him into flames. Harry didn’t think he would ever forget the way the Feindfyre burned. The way Draco nearly killed himself trying to save his friends. Silent tears on his shoulder. Fingers just barely holding onto his jacket, like he was afraid.
Harry showed him how to plug the toaster in and let Malfoy push the frozen pastries into their place. He tried to ignore the look of pure fascination Malfoy had the whole time. He'd get on wonderfully with Arthur... had things been different and stuff.
, Draco’s brain supplied. The windows were rounded, and at least two vines were running up the walls, giving the place a rustic, Italian feel. It, like the forest around it, was revelling in end-of-summer warmth.
“We didn’t know.” She whispered. “You’re right, it was his fifth birthday. We had a party. Everyone was there. Your mother, cousin Cassie and Bella.” She choked.
Yes, Remus still beat himself up sometimes when he remembers what he is, but he grows his own herbs and always knows how to cheer them up. Sirius spent 12 years in Azkaban for a crime he didn’t commit and he had sentiments for muggle appliances, but he was the one that saved Draco from the alley and gave Harry a place to call home. Harry lacked in the emotional department but he was good at making people smile and didn’t royally suck at Defence. And that’s something.
“I understand that he is not an ally Marvolo I do, but this can not happen chief among it that it sets the precedence that we will not be able to ever overturn.” Said Abraxas.
“Indeed, whatever could that boy be doing? Thank you, Severus, you are dismissed. Tell the fool I needed strengthening Potions or some nonsense that he would not suspect.” Ordered Voldemort, and Severus left. With that Voldemort retired for the night.
Blaise took in a sharp breath, at the looks he got from the other students he answered the unasked question. “My family is from Italy, Rome to be exact. It’s well known that when Rome fell most of the textbooks and journals and such on Roman magics was burned with the city. This caused most of Rome’s magic to be classified as a dead magic branch, most assume that it is because of the fire that burned Rome, but that wasn’t true, we were losing the access to our magics long before then. The oldest families are known for creating things, wards, spells, rituals, etc., but the strongest families, can create magical creatures, of a sort. The Evanshade house is known for having created the first Basilisk. Someone in Rome created one of these creatures, it was fine at first, they were called the Battle Centurions, and people ran before them, a full knights suit made of Iron, with the full power a single element at its disposal, they were monsters of defense, then the golden centurion was forged, he was made with additional offensive enchantments, he was also given intelligence as he was to lead the rest of the iron centurions into battle for Rome, it didn’t work.” Blaise answered, before Harry continued.
crying?” Draco wanted to know. “The muggles in the cooking shows don’t cry either.” He said accusingly.
Neville puts his hands on Harry's shoulders. "Don't worry Harry, all you have to do is walk to Kevin's bed, lie down  and close your eyes. The next part is called
The scene played over and over in his head. The hungry looks Greyback kept sending him. Bellatrix's maniacal laughter and he writhed and screamed. Being shoved at Voldemort’s feet and forced to protstrate, to beg.
And then he wakes up to an annoyingly familiar white ceiling and gauzy pillows. Harry recalls thinking ‘oh, god. Not again.’ before he tried to sit up in bed. Only to get pushed back down. By Lavender Brown.
“Just snog him already, I want a turn.” Blaise Zabini called out, smirking at Neville. But wasn’t he with Ernie? Oh, Merlin.
Draco didn’t like to believe the man had an ounce of musical talent, big-headed oaf. Nothing very religious about him or his beer belly either.
smile when Draco talked to him. “Ron, ‘Mione and I were going to have a biscuit icing battle. You can join us if you’d like.”
Happiness could be found in the darkest of places, if only one remembers to turn on the light, said Dumbledore.
Molly was in the kitchen. She had at least two kettles running on the large stove. The ginger-haired woman was humming what Draco recognized to be Celestina Warbeck’s A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love.
Harry raised an eyebrow, trying (and failing) to subdue his laughter. Mini Malfoy projectile vomiting over Walburga was just too good to be true. He wondered if Sirius had heard that one. “Funny. I really thought she liked you.”
Malfoy raised an elegant eyebrow. Okay. That was a lie. Malfoy's eyebrows were not the only elegant thing about him. Merlin, the man was like Jacques and Marcel and Abram mixed  into one hot, blond, French piece of arse.
Really? This was how Lav planned on breaking the big news? Harry rolled his eyes. “Fine, bad news first.”
Harry wanted to turn around and flee. Hogwarts might’ve been in ruins, but even that was more comforting than what his home had turned into.
For Merlin’s sake. What was wrong with him, thinking about wading inside Draco Malfoy and all. What he should be doing is apologising.
“Anyway,” Hermione said. “I’ve asked Blaise and Hannah to help us judge. And maybe Draco would like to join the judging panel too?”
Stupid bigoted prat. Harry was a fool for thinking he’d somehow changed. What was Sirius thinking, bring a death eater home? Well, someone who is most
by having you hear it from the wrong person. This means a lot to me and I… I’d rather ruin it myself than have someone else poison it.”
“M’ arm’s cramping.” Draco says, breath warm against Harry’s neck and he really shouldn’t be turned on by this but he is.
The fire cast dim shadows across the eighth year common room. From one corner of the room, flashes of light could be seen bouncing off the walls.
“Merlin’s tits, what on Earth?” Sirius exclaimed at two chairs that started walking them to the table and made them sit.
The pillow is unfairly soft – for something made of Hippogriff. Harry’s been considering  getting a few of them for himself. And Dean, seeing as the man used it more than Neville did.
He casts a spell on the creepy figurine. Harry only sees it after Sirius sticks it on with a (potentially permanent) sticking charm;
Harry let Draco have all his scones, artfully avoiding both Lavender and Hermione’s questioning looks. That was a conversation he’d rather not have when Draco was attached to his hip.
Having Draco pressed against his side was a bit painful for his pining heart, but the warmth lulled him to sleep soon enough. And you don’t remember pain in sleep. At least, Harry didn’t.
They stood around the long kitchen island, a bit like during Herbology, actually. Recipe books lay open to different dishes on different parts of the table. Gingerbread, madeleines, shortbread and even stained glass window biscuits (though Harry couldn’t imagine putting icing on some of those).
Mismatched and barely holding on to a few seams, but still together, a bit like their little makeshift family.
Within seconds, Sirius is at his side. Arm around his shoulder. Comforting, Harry realizes with an angry shudder. They were trying to comfort him.
It was a dusty old thing, covered in cobwebs he was far too familiar with. That was probably what drew him in. The thing was a snowglobe that, after a vigorous wipe with his sleeve, revealed a tiny knight and a dragon. They were in a field of snow, both braced for attack.
Taking a hold of Draco’s wrists, Harry guided them to his neck. Then he wrapped his arms around the speechless blond. “Is this okay?” Harry asks.
“I’m from a place where magic is real. There are witches and wizards. I’ve lived there my whole life.” Oh, the boy was talking. “There’s been some conflict. War.” He swallowed the same time Sirius winced at the word.
Heck, they’d even attended a funeral service for ‘little old Toasty’ with black suits and all. Harry was starting to think his godfather was a little barmy.
“I charmed it red. I didn’t think you’d like the pattern that was on it before.” Malfoy looked very pink and flushed in the dim Hogwarts lights. Huh, Harry thought. Was he always this easily flustered?
Sirius stood up, despite the chair’s obvious distress, and pulled them both in for a tight hug. Remus joined them too, and Harry knew his eyes were shining with unshed tears. Sirius was pressing kisses into their hair. Draco was sobbing silently into Remus’ shoulder.
“Well,” Draco smiled and Harry's temper melted away instanty. “Professor Lupin made this really good curry thing the first day I was here. We had it with bread, on the floor with a palette box as a table. It was the best meal I’ve ever had.” He had a faraway look in his eyes, like he was already tasting it.
Harry turns to Hermione, eyes sparkling. He'd spent a fat load of Divination lessons daydreaming about the perfect Christmas.
It was time for a survivor to help another survivor. James taught him to swim when he started to drown. Sirius would do the same for Draco.
. “But-” He stopped when he saw the look Draco was giving him. “Okay fine.” Darn Draco’s adorable glare. Angry ferret was irresistible.
The warming charm was like a wave. Washing over from his head down to his toes, which curled in pleasure.
might think, but I believe it’s pretty dumb for a society that doesn’t have legitimate religious belief to go around celebrating Christian holidays and Christian holidays alone. If you’re going to celebrate, you should celebrate all holidays, of every ethnicity and religion.”
“Save it.” Sirius says, leaning into Remus. “We aren’t mad, Prongslet. You were hurt. It was only natural.”
The ten year old inside him, the one who hid amongst the shadows was laughing. Harry hated that child. It always made him feel worthless and unwanted. He didn’t listen to the sound of breaking glass ringing in his ears.
The boy in question swallowed thickly. “It’s true that I have a mark. Many actually, but not the kind you think I do.” He displayed his forearm, eyes closed.
Harry made a show of pretending to look out for Sirius. Couldn’t have his godfather find them eating contraband.
There were sparks around them - maybe from the magic mistletoe, maybe from something else. And then they were as far from each other as the Controlled Reproduction Draught allowed them.
The fires left the living room enveloped in warmth. It felt great after all that walking around in snow. It felt even better when Draco pulled him down to sit on the couch closest to the fireplace.
The days after, clutching his chest and wondering if he would ever breathe normally again. Eyes catching his wand and wondering if it would be cowardly to end himself.
“I am calm-” Harry was saying, before he spotted the humongous boulder in their way. “Watch out!” He instinctively circled his hands around Malfoy’s waist in an ‘if I die, he dies too’ moment.
Neville managed to prop the door open despite the very much unconscious Ron perched  against it. "Hey Harry, Malfoy. Ooh, is that knife monopoly?"
Harry remembers staying up trying to put the correct charms on his gift for Draco. And then nearly breaking the thing while trying to wrap it.
When he moved his hands, the chains around his wrists clanged. They made a sickening sound every time they made contact with the witness box.
Malfoy pulled Harry’s pillow from under his head and put it over his ears. “Must you Gryffindors be so loud?” His eyes fluttered shut.
“Well,” she twirled a bit of her hair - a sign she was nervous. Wait, Harry didn’t some sort of incurable dick disease, did he? She said something like that a few weeks ago, except it was a prank that time.
Harry shrugged, definitely not thinking about walking in on Remus and Draco watching Jamie Oliver at four in the morning. “It doesn’t sting as much once you’ve done it a few times.”
"But I will be lonely." Seamus said in his thick Irish accent. The one Dean wouldn't stop yammering about whenever Harry was unfortunately available.
“Sorry, Draco,” said Hermione before Lavender could open her mouth and once again, wreak havoc. “We were just about to leave, right Ron, Lavender?” She uses her Stern Voice, which makes the other two nod fervently. No one could fight Hermione’s Stern Voice. Not even Lavender.
He had to put the boy out of his misery somehow. The injuries would heal better if he slept. There wasn’t a single part of him that wasn’t covered in bandages.
"What are you doing here?" Harry blurts, feeling exceptionally stupid right after. He can’t help but over analyse everything. Like how close their faces were…
Harry knows he shouldn’t be surprised to see her here, smiling inhumanely wide. Ever since the Patil twins found out he was half-Indian (and subsequently formed
Viktor sighs but makes no further comment before scooping up Teddy and Victorie. “Who wants to play hide-and-go-seek?” He says in his thickest accent because Viktor knows how much the kids love it.
to tell him." Harry says, feeling like tearing his hair out. "Otherwise you're going  to end up marrying your best friend's sister and having three, horribly named children - the  second of which will become best friends with your crush's son.
I tried, to show how their relationship kind of improved. How they bonded over the week. But then it all went downhill and I came up with this.
Potter’s hands, which Draco didn’t realize were on his waist, flailed up as he tried to explain himself. “Gin, I-“
Harry glanced to his side to see Draco smiling, his face and hair lit in a warm glow from the fireplace. He looked very unreal, sitting at the dining table of No.!2 Grimmauld Place, wearing muggle clothes and a pair of Harry's woolly socks (that Draco doesn't know are his).
Harry shrugged. That made sense, but he slipped a pair in anyway because you never know when a heatwave might come in and all the ice melts so they have to swim to safety.
Sirius could almost hug him to death. Instead, he slid down to sit next to him, the fire crackling between them. An unbearable silence hung around them like a cold, wet blanket. Neither could look the other in the eye.
He slinks deeper into his chair at mention of them. Why would they even agree when he, Draco, had been nothing but a complete arsewipe to their children?
Harry was not above begging for his life. He did not come back from the fucking dead for this sort of treatment! "No Dean, please don't lock the door. Please. Please. Please."
Sirius had to sit down, the vehemence far too much for him. How could they? and that too to the point Draco felt compelled to hurt himself.
Remus already had his wand out and was swiftly healing the wounds on one hard. “Show me your left arm.”
"No, I saw you both leaving the party. You looked pretty inebriated.” Malfoy had assumed a  conspiratorial air that had Harry in goosebumps.
“-yes, and I’m sure it’s fascinating, really.” Harry patted his… seatmate? Friend? Did this new proximity make them mates now? They weren't really fighting, and Harry was far too tired to think up the schematics. Let’s call Malfoy a Significant Annoyance and leave the ponder about details for later.
Neville grins, something undoubtedly Slytherin in his eyes. "Because it's true, Harry, and the truth is bitter."
“I was forced to take the Dark Mark. Physically restrained and Crucioed multiple times until I was too weak to resist.”
It’s odd, but not unpleasant in the least. It’s quite nice is what Harry wants to say. Malfoy should smile more often.
And when Harry put his hand through Draco’s hair, everything in the world felt right. He couldn’t quite explain it, but it just did. He wouldn’t have minded spending the rest of eternity with Draco’s head in his lap, fingers curled in blond hair that resembled the snow, but was softer than it could ever hope to be.
He didn’t think he was capable of maintaining friendships. Pansy and Blaise were in too deep to back out. That’s why they stuck to him. Not because he was a good friend or anything…
“Well…” Was Malfoy seriously going to try to argue back? If so, the git was even crazier than Harry thought! “Of course, your concerns are valid, Patil… But if your goal is to establish other holidays at Hogwarts, would boycotting Christmas set a good example? I mean, wouldn’t it just make other students think they could just ruin the spirit of holidays if they wish. You should show that you embrace these holidays and respect the same way you do your own. That way, you wouldn't be labeled a hypocrite.”
“Harry, it’s okay…” Sirius might be saying. Harry doesn’t want to listen. He can’t listen – bells gonged in his ears, blocking every other sound.
“Can I at least put on a Santa hat?” Harry pouted. Hopefully his puppy dog face was just as strong as Draco’s.
He had been so ghastly to Granger and Weasley, only because Potter had chosen them over him. Draco didn’t wonder why Potter did that, now.
Honestly I don't know what to name these chapters but I feel obliged to cause I love it when chapters have names.
“It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” Harry tangles his fingers with Draco’s.  He feels a little squeeze and sighs in content.
you mean. This was Draco's third trial. The first one had him put in house arrest with mother. The second had him being dragged to Azkaban with chains on his wrists and ankles. Now, two years later, Wimbledon seems to have forgotten that.
Ron looks like he might be getting rattled by a snake when he says, "No Harry, it's not." And this time, 'come one snake, let's rattle' meant fighting. Just so you know.
"No." Neville replies. "I think it was just the right amount of creepy. Oh, and you make a  great fanboy. Probably should stop watching so many soaps, though."
Harry just drags fingers through Draco’s hair. Draco leans into the touch, facing him so he could see those mismatched eyes. You only ever noticed when you were in, say, kissing-distance. And Harry
Harry reached his free hand to… to do what? Touch his cheek? Push his hair back? Honestly, what was he thinking?
Was there not some magic spell that could, I don’t know, speed the potion up a day? Was that not doable in a world where immortality can be achieved by making a
Narcissa went on. “We barely… He… It was Bella. She said they were playing. The marks of the Cruatius curse said otherwise.”
James taught the Marauders Arabic and Tamil so they could talk about ‘stuff’ without other people hearing. Lily learnt it because she had to make sure they weren’t 'up to no good'.
Usually Sirius didn’t let confirmed-death-eater-and-probably-abusive women hold his baby. Yet, for some reason, he trusted her.
Okay who cried? Because I did. Even though that makes me sound pretentious, crying over my own work like that. Oops.
“Fucking guess what happened today?” Ginny shrieked as she apparated into Grimmo’s living room. She seems like a red and green tornado, pulling off her Quidditch gear and throwing her sweaty socks in Harry’s general direction. (One of the socks hit Ron square on the forehead while Draco shoots the other with an
The only time Malfoy’s not pretending is when he’s insulting Harry. Or duelling him. He bet the first thing Malfoy thought up in the morning was the list of insults he’d be calling Harry that day.
Their eyes met, Draco’s and Harry’s, for a split second, before prosecutor Wimbledon snapped his fingers at Draco’s face. Attention whore.
The boy’s face lit up when he saw the few sandwiches and bottles of water packed in there. “Thank you.” He smiled, the colour already returning to his cheeks. Then, he sneezed.
Mouth dry, Harry forced himself to look Draco in the eye. “What are you doing?” Hadn’t Draco told Zabini he wouldn’t get in the hot tub?
Harry decides to shout out "I've had tea with your auntie Matilda, Dean. That was a  compliment.” Because there was less chance of him losing anymore of his dignity. Well,  whatever dignity Harry had left after nearly seven years with the Gryffindor’s.
Was he alright? Was Malfoy going to cry? Was it Harry’s fault Malfoy was crying? Had Harry ever made anyone cry? Probably. But never Malfoy. Right? A thousand questions flooded Harry’s brain, but he couldn’t answer a single one.
If only Draco stopped puzzling him. It would help a lot with Harry’s heart and it’s occasional gymnastics.
Sirius and Draco have a heart-to-heart. Turns out they understand each other better than they thought?
He wanted to tell the boy to stop acting so dramatic, but he knew what would happen if a dog started talking. Instead, Sirius pushed the plastic baggie at him.
“I am a very selfish person.” She admits. “I don’t take personal cases, but I took on yours because… you remind me of my grandson.”
“Right,” he faked a cheery tone. “Thank you for having me, Mrs Weasley. I’m very grateful.” Don’t run away. Don’t run away.
He’d switched from Malfoy to Draco the moment he’d started talking about forks and spoons. He’d had to be explained how parents moulded children to understand Draco’s ordeal. And now he was Draco. Not Malfoy.
Draco stares at him the same disjointed way he did on ‘the day of the fork and spoon’. Dissociated. Like he wasn’t actually there. Eyes glazed over and voice shallow when he says, “I have something to show you.”
“Okay, okay,” grinned Lav, who was really getting on Harry’s nerves. “So the bad news is that one of the Controlled Reproduction draughts exploded in Herbology (which may or may not have been my fault haha) and some of it went on you and now you can’t go five feet away from Malfoy because you guys are now stuck in a bubble thing you can't get out of and no one can get into.” she said all in one breath.
"There's no one else since the Slytherins are going to a party and Justin is in the infirmary." Right. Justin had the  Dragon Pox. Not a serious case though. Harry made a mental note to visit him sometime.
“It’s used for… selective breeding! It’s used for selective breeding and it works by… err… it creates a barrier of sorts around the two intended plants and-” Ew.
"Dean Thomas. You have officially run out of excuses." Harry groans as the Gryffindor in  question screams into Neville's Hippogriff-feather stuffed pillow.
“Go away,” He said softly, not quite meeting Sirius’ eye. His skin blotched red in some places. Bruises only just starting to heal. The boy’s eyes sunk in and his cheeks were hollow.
“The fuck do you want, Malfoy?” Harry turned around to glare at him and found the blond biting his lips. Not meeting his eye. Malfoy was wearing the clothes Sirius bought for him. The turtleneck and the ripped jeans. Muggle clothes.
Harry laughed, and as he did, he felt the Gryffindor side of him winning. Merlin forbid this be the first time it's wrong.
For one thing, there was only one. And it was not big enough for them to build a pillow wall between them, and then not fall off the edge. In the end, they had to lie down side by side.. They agreed it was probably better to face one another than be kicked in the face.
Draco scowls, mouthing ‘cliché’ at him. He then turns and gives Molly his sickliest, sweetest smile.
Sirius put a paw on Draco’s thigh. A reassurance of sorts. There were a million words spoken in that tiny action.
Draco looks at her warily but sees nothing but genuine concern in her face. Somehow she managed to remind him of both his mother and Professor McGonagall. It was overwhelming.
“You guys are no fun,” Tonks says. Andromeda just shakes her head and resignes tothe kitchen. Probably to chit-chat with Molly about Merlin knows what.
"Because once someone said 'come on snake, let's rattle' and I body-slammed them into the  pool. Turns out they wanted to dance." That was how Neville got laid. By body-slamming his  crush into a pool. Harry could only wish he were that successful.
“If you think it means I feel the same way for you, then yes. If not-'' Harry doesn't get a chance to finish his sentence as Draco pulls him into a bone-crushing embrace.
"Thanks Ron. You're a good friend.” Harry hugs him, and then adds, “I'll find Viktor's socks for you."
Draco, unlike Harry, hadn’t taken his shirt off. It was a rather large shirt that made Draco look a bit boxy. The shirt ended just short of his knees, and Harry found himself gasping as he took in the way the fabric looked against Draco’s pale skin. So pale, the flesh and fabric could’ve been one.
it’s not safe. The only reason Sirius stayed back was that the Battle of Hogwarts was a night before the full moon. He stayed back for Remus.
The end credits of yet another muggle movie plays while an audience of three huddle together, too busy chattering to care who played the part of Whatever-His-Name.
Sirius smelled the shakshouka even before he saw Remus fumbling around in their makeshift kitchen. He was stress-cooking again.
Sirius and Remus exchanged a look. “I think we’ve officially become a family today. Four dysfunctional idiots.”
Malfoy glared at him. “It’s blue with tiny sheep, okay?” There was hurt in his eyes, like he expected Harry to make fun of him or something stupid of the sort. Even though the emotion was one Harry was used to being directed at, the softness, the
“Oh yeah? Then why the bloody hell did he get Crucioed when he was five? Was that your idea of a birthday present?”
across the room. He runs to pick it up again, but physically recoils when he gets close to the pile of socks Harry kept at the foot of his bed. It was quite the collection, and Harry was rather proud of it.
“Let’s get Moomy his soup, shall we?” Teddy giggled, turning his hair bright green. Sirius took that as a yes.
Draco had his head leaned against one of the less mouldy areas of the wall. He looked almost normal in the warm clothes Remus insisted Sirius give him. That earned him a lot of questions about his 'owner' which Sirius dutifully ignored.
"Just this once," said Harry, mouth full of crackers. "Just. This. Once. I'd like to have a normal Christmas. I mean, is that too much to ask for?"
Bruises followed his eyes everywhere he looked. Purple and red and fading pinks painting a gruesome picture no critic would appreciate.
It’s nice to think Dean trusts his judgement. Though Harry probably just wore him down. Still, he had Dean’s blessing to fuck shit up.
“Sirius?” his voiced echoed in the hallway. The darkness seemed to push against him, cold grip tightening around his body.
Draco rolled his eyes, but Harry thought he saw a tiny smile too. “Alright, Harry. You can wear a Santa hat.”
They dragged him back to his chair and the rest of the session whizzed by in a blur. Mother testified, and so did Potter, but Draco didn't hear a word.
Their teenage years long gone, outbursts like those only meant love. The war left them burned and bruised. Desperate to keep one another safe. Alarm was understandable. Guilt often followed.
"That's all you're going to say?" Harry mock-whines. "Just 'sounds fun'? You hurt my heart Hermione."
His boyfriend starts to laugh. Draco’s gesturing at the Christmas tree. There are pictures hung all over it. Moving pictures.
"I live here?” Malfoy says, looking a bit cross. “In this dormitory of which you are blocking the door?"
“I don’t think I can wait twelve years for him, Sirius.” He chokes. “I just don’t have that willpower.”
A compromise was reached (one based on Kale crisps) and a movie watched. Children put to bed, and the wine taken out of the cellar.
They fell into a rather comfortable pace, with Draco chopping and Molly stirring. The only sounds were of the knife hitting the cutting board and the bubble of the pots. Draco had to brush his hair out of his face multiple times.
sounded all sorts of wrong. “Prevents the pollen or whatever, from going into any other plant than the one we want it to breed with?”
“Liar.” Draco whispered in his ear. He’d gotten a pile of books from Hermione, some sweaters from Millie, an ornate mirror from Blaise (though it only showed Zabini’s face so was useless) and Pansy bought him a pair of stilettos for herself.
Vines ran across the pale pink walls, dotted with the odd rose. They part of the plaster, but often gave off the most delicious smell of rose and honey. You could feel tiny pricks when you ran your hands along the thorns.
At the same time Harry knew that Dean was genuinely afraid. He was scared that his feelings would somehow ruin his friendship with Seamus. Harry understood how that felt. He remembered how scared he was when he finally came out to Ron and Hermione, only for them to go off about some bet. Hermione won, obviously.
intercouse.” Why were they learning this again? This wasn’t a Sex Ed class last time Harry checked. He says as much to Dean, on his right.
Narcissa didn’t cry when Sirius nodded, but he noticed she squeezed Teddy a bit tighter. Teddy giggled and yanked at a stray blond lock. To Sirius’ amazement, if not despair, the woman didn’t even flinch.
"Dean, come on. You're better than this. Where's your Gryffindor courage?" Please work. Please work. Please work.
Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini don’t even look odd, standing in their respective ugly-sweaters, courtesy of Molly. Greg and Astoria got caught up in a big shipping deal and were very sorry not to attend.
While the thicket and the sound of running water and such reminded him of his home, the infamous Burrow did nothing of the sort.
Harry nods once. Tightly. Almost like he doesn’t want to know. Because he doesn't. Because if it was something Draco thought might ruin their this, Harry would rather not know.
Cheeks full of colour and eyes gleaming with mischief. Wearing muggle clothes and spending time in the kitchen with Harry and gardening with Remus, learning to do things the muggle way. Singing to Teddy in French and bickering with Sirius about the house repairs.
“Is that you?” Came Draco’s excited voice from somewhere. “I think I've finally got the hang of making fires."
“What’s wrong?” Draco peeks his head out from the shower curtain, hair dripping. It immediately makes the bathroom fog with steam.
? Harry had to battle a nose-less man and his henchman who could turn into a rat at will. Heck, Harry was the son of a deer. Stag. Whatever. How hard could this be?
It’s enough because the people on the telly are liars. They make up these crazy expectations of what the 'perfect' family is supposed to be. Aunt Petunia might be obsessed with those soap operas but even she knows they were unrealistic.
“Merry met, young heir.” Said a voice next to him. Harry turned and saw a man that was clearly a Potter but was not his guardian James. “My name is Michalis, I will be your mentor in the mind arts, as James is your mentor in Etiquette, magic, laws, and history of house Potter. As he teaches you to be a Potter, I will teach you how to master your mind, your magic, and your power. How to use that power in and out of the political arena as well. But first your mindscape must be handled, just look around it is beautiful, untamed, untouched, but also defenseless, and that young heir is the problem.”
"Among this year's first years only two could possibly be mis-sorted, one went to Gryffindor and the other Slytherin."
The spell types were inherently Roman in origin. In its prime Rome had jealously protected few things more than they protected their magic, not even teaching conquered lands the spells they were so well known for. The few written texts on Roman magic had been hidden in the bowels of the libraries of Roman family seats of power, the main manors of the Roman magical families. With the fall and sacking of Rome and its constituent city states, many of those family libraries had been destroyed along with the great city.
“No, it was then however that he took his bolder stance of starting to actually attack some of the family manors and squares. After the attack at Godric’s Hollow, we tried tracking you down, and succeeded. You were in the care of Alrick’s parents for two whole weeks while they tried to get Sirius Black a trial. Then Dumbledore came with Auror’s and took you back to your aunt’s and uncles. We were forbidden from contracting you as all vassals and cadets were by Albus Dumbledore and the Wizengamot, Dumbledore said the reason you had all been in hiding was a threat from within the family, so the Wizengamot unanimously voted for it with no proof. As such we couldn’t even offer our aid last year during the tournament. But you have made contact now and it changed things. On that depressing note let us continue with our shopping, where to first Harry?” asked Edward.
"I sincerely doubt you will have time to use your free periods as nap time Mr. Weasley. I would suggest you use it instead for the various homework essays, and projects you will be required to do this year." Mr. Sevine said as he went to the front of the class. "I have heard how history of magic has been taught by that Binn's ghost and I will tell you now that falling asleep in my class or not paying attention in my classroom will land you a detention with me and the loss of points. You all are here to study the history of our magical world. I understand that it is not the most fascinating of subjects, but I expect you to honor those who have gone before you enough to listen and to show your respect for their deeds."
The Great Hall doors both clanged open with a clang as Harry and Neville entered the hall fell silent as the hall took in the sight before them as the two strode forward, anger and fury emanating from them in waves. Dumbledore rose as the two came to stand before the teachers table. "Enough the two of you, I am highly disappointed in the both of you, first skipping classes without permission and running off grounds, then appearing here like this. This behavior is unacceptable of students at this school. Sit down and we will discuss this later."
"The ancestral houses are in the simplest terms our world's oldest, and strongest houses. They helped shape the empire's, they have molded our culture into the form you see today. Each empire has ancestral houses, for Albion, we had Emrys, Le-Fay, and Evan-Shade lines; for the Mayan Empire, there was Xook, Ehb and Chan lines; for the Inca, Capac, Tupac, and Amaru lines; for the Russian, Dramir, Mihailov, and Darkstrom lines; the Mongol empire had Yeke, Batu and Burilgi lines; the Hitite had Zindata, Zalpa, and Ishtar lines; the Indian had Digvijay, Arjun, and Dalip lines; the Chinese empire had Qianlong, Taizhu, and Taizong lines; the Japanese the Tarashihiko, Wakasazaki, and Hitarashi lines, with the Egyptian empire having the Ptolemy, Kush and Peverell lines; the Oeacanic Congress having the Maiava, Tuala, and Suega lines; with the African congress with the Adebowale, Abioye, Jaheem, Jelani, Imari, Folami, and Emem lines. Three for every individual empire, they provided protection, balance and guidance, a triumvate for every empire, it served our people well. One took the light magic, one the grey, and one the dark, and although borders have changed, and other ancestral lines have been lost with the falls of their nations, those are the names still we remember and know today."
Another silence followed. This one enhanced with the sound of dripping water Sirius hadn't noticed before. Must be from a leaky pipe.
Sirius found himself tackled by a very worried werewolf. Smiling gingerly, he dragged muddy fingers through Remus’ hair. “Moony, I-”
“Yeah,” Harry glanced at his friend’s faces. Hermione gave him a tight-lipped smile while Ron nodded jerkily. Neither of them was keen on his going to Grimmauld Place.
Malfoy would probably tell him Harry thought too highly of himself. And that he was a narcissist. An arrogant prick.
He tried to be gentle, because Ginny once said that firsts were supposed to be memorable, but that wasn’t easy when you have long fingers treading through your hair.
Tell me what you think! Hope you liked this chapter and please comment cuz I need attention :P Also you owe me for all the frequent updates.
Before Draco could reply, Ron interjected. “It’s pretty clear Malfoy helped Harry with his costume. It would be favouritism.”
“What can I do for you?” If Draco was going to pull the effort to be less of a dick, Harry would be more than happy to lend a hand. Maybe he could even help Draco out of whatever problem made him leave the Manor and his parents.
His mind drifted the hours of putting up with verbal abuse. Hiding under his bed until she gone. James healing his bruises when he went back to Hogwarts.
The sled began moving, slowly at first, but then Luanne gave it a harder push and they were sliding down the mountain faster than the latest model of the Nimbus broom.
“If you die, the potion is going to kill me too,” Malfoy mumbled, still hovering over him. “Do you want us both to die out here, Potter?”
But it was there. Alive. Slithering inside the head. Occasionally poking her head out of an eye socket to nip at the skin under his shackles. It hurt. It always did. Even after two long years of rotting in a cell.
with his crush. Things were rocky and often awkward, but hey, at least they weren’t at each  other’s throats anymore.
Draco’s lips were red from the snogging and Harry felt a surge of pride. I did that. Harry dragged his fingers on the blond’s back, relishing the way he arched closer. Draco rested his head in the crook of Harry’s neck, and within moments of mixed heartbeats, they fell asleep.
counted as a morning-after mess they had to clean up. Weekly Movie Night was one of the things they started doing together during eighth year. It was a fun way to spend Tuesday nights, Harry supposed. Sometimes Ginny and Luna joined them. Neville only did when they watched James Bond. He said he could pass for a Bond. Harry wasn't so sure.
But Harry doesn’t want that. He wants to stare into those mismatched eyes for as long as possible. To enjoy the way Draco gently tugged at his hair. To cherish the moment. Make the best of it.
Dean had been pining over Seamus for what felt like forever. Harry couldn’t understand why  he couldn’t ask the other bloke out. They were practically a married couple!
Harry freezes. His heart starts pounding against his chest at a rate much too quick to be  considered normal. He wonders faintly if it's beating loud enough for the blond to hear.
