Street noises below.
“Want me to come with you or…?”
He disappears after breakfast, likely learning everything he can about what Hermione sent him in the thick envelope. Harry tends to the kitchen, setting things out for lunch and tidying up after the week.
“Draco, you’re dating one of my closest friends.” Neville frowns.
“Yes? What do you want?” Malfoy asks innocently.
“Oh shit.” Harry says blankly. “I’d completely forgotten.”
“What? You’re sexy. I don’t have to be gay to see it. It’s a confidence thing.” He shrugs.
“Welcome!” She grinned, stepping to the side for the two to enter.
Snape sits down behind the desk, steepled his fingers and looks at Harry and Malfoy. The clock ticks.
“Sorry, think it might smell like sex in here for a bit.” Potter says.
“I’m so fucking proud of you.” Harry says softly. “Everything you’ve done today, I mean… you
“I thought the whole idea of a pet is to pay attention to them.” Draco complains. Harry laughs, putting his book aside.
“I’ve no idea. Am I? Was I all that dramatic back then?”
“Are you upset?” Draco asks quietly.
“I’ve had quite a blast just looking, and I’m sure I’ll enjoy watching the ones you’re getting go off.” Draco says, smiling charmingly as he misdirects away from Harry’s question. Harry accepts his answer, paying for his before bidding George good sales and leaving.
“Thanks, mate. Really.”
“Oh. Wow, that’s smart, I should’ve done that. Would’ve gone a lot faster.”
“The Ministry?” Harry asks, standing. It can’t be past eight o’clock.
Astoria gives Draco a weak smile, and he wonders if they’re still talking about Mr. Devoe.
wanted to run, change his name and Obliviate everything from the past year from his memory.
“Yes.”
Draco whimpers a complaint with words not even he can identify, and Astoria continues.
“You okay?”
“Because I- I’m not willing to do that with you. Sex, and things. I mean, I
Harry considers this before he answers.
“Blaise takes forever in the shops, I had to do something whilst I waited.”
Harry’s eyebrows raise as Lucius gestures at the two of them curled up on the sofa together, Draco’s arm twined with Harry’s.
Malfoy shrugs again, but walks back around the counter and waves his hands around to set whatever he'd been working with back to their cupboards.
“I don’t want to.” Draco says, pulling his leg free and standing. “You aren’t my boyfriend, and if you tell anyone you are, we’re over.”
When the shot doesn’t immediately bring the colour back into Draco’s cheeks, Harry grows worried.
He’s no longer under the impression that this is a hospital. After all, no one has tried to heal him in any way, despite the cuts and bruises lingering from… wherever he’d been before this. He can’t remember right before, but it’s a small gap in his memory. It was bad, he knows. He doesn’t care to examine further.
Pierson, with Draco’s voice, still sounds confused, but Harry can tell he and Draco are dreading the same thing. A Gilderoy Lockhart-esque result on Pierson’s memory.
“Fuck, you do open up easy.” Potter says, watching Draco’s face intently as he very quickly works a second finger in.
“Okay, lay down then.”
A few more passes, a brush over his knee, a gentle scratch near his ankle, light pressure moving up his thigh. But Draco hadn’t told him to stop.
Draco, but it still hurts. And there’s nothing I can do.”
I doubt this was the intended Master/slave dynamic, but I don't really enjoy a lot of cnc so I made it cute
“You’re not like that anymore.” Greg says gently. “We aren’t. We’ve gone through shit but we’ve come out the other side better men. And don’t you get off on humiliation, anyway?”
“Alright?”
“It all began in
“Yes, Master Harry! Miss Luna is in the gardens.” She says. “Now be going to get ready!”
Willows has to answer what his sexuality is, which he does with great exasperation- "I know none of you believe me, but I am mostly straight with very expressive hands."
Draco eats as long as Harry talks specifically about him being cute.
Draco sleeps in Sunday morning, and Harry strokes Draco’s arm, thinking absently about what to make for their breakfast.
“I thought it might make up for the ‘Potter Stinks’ badges in Fourth Year.” Harry teases, laughing more when Malfoy shoots him an unimpressed look.
Harry yelps when silver sparks shoot from the face of the signet, but Draco doesn’t flinch.
Private sessions are frightening.
“But I
“Mhm. I feel like I could sleep for a week, the research alone is driving me mental.” Neville says as he sits in the unoccupied chair. “I can’t believe I’ve just accepted having a cat on the dining table at dinner.”
“Thank you.” Snape says dryly, returning to the material, his eyes lingering near Harry and Malfoy. Strangely, though, they don’t seem to be as cold as years prior.
relaxed?” Harry returns, sending the wave back.
Malfoy’s eyes snap to his, then widen slightly. Like he’s surprised to see him. Harry squeezes again, and Malfoy’s fingers twitch in his. Then he pulls away, ending his dance before the music is over and disappearing behind the curtain.
“So you’re going to date them, then?” He asks flatly. “I’m sure
"What the Bloody Hell happened"
AHHH Cliffhanger!! Hope you guys liked this chapter, I know it was sad but there was a bit of fluff thrown in there to lessen the blow!
Draco woke up to the feel of soft kisses being pressed into his neck.
"I-" Harry choked out, before closing his eyes in shame and embarrassment. He wasn't meant to be like this. He was clearly just confused, or maybe defective. With this thought, afresh steam of tears began.
Major TW for this chapter, a lot of internalised homophobia, self-hate and self-harm.
Harry sputtered. 'I- I, uhm, yeah? S-sure" Harry continued to stare dumbfoundedly at Draco as the blond watched with an amused smirk as he stumbled over his words.
Harry and Draco had become better friends during the week after the second encounter in the bathroom.
"What do you want me to say? Huh? That I'm going to tell everyone? Because I'm not. You may not believe it, but I've changed, or at least, I'm trying to. But if you can't see that, or refuse to then it's your loss."
Poor baby :(
Harry's such a disaster, but we love him anyway for some reason.
Harry resumed his usual routine during breakfast, putting a small bit of food onto his plate.
After breakfast finished, Hermione stood up and gestured for them to come, stating that they "couldn't be late for transfiguration this early in the term"
Pansy nodded and gave him a better smiling after schooling her expression. They all sit together, talking quietly amongst themselves before Draco stands to leave. Pansy informs him of the last party before Christmas before he leaves. He nods in recognition before heading towards the astronomy tower.
"Ok spill" Pansy demanded, seconds after sitting down next to Draco. Knowing she would force it out of him, Draco began to describe his encounter with Potter.
This seemed to finally get Hermione to cave as she sighed and agreed reluctantly. Harry shot Ron a grateful look and Harry started to pile a small amount of food onto his plate.
Her eyes widened and a hand came up to cover her mouth as tears danced along her waterline. Pansy was heartbroken as she read between the lines of what Draco was telling her. She nodded quickly and pulled the boy in for a hug, praising him for helping Harry.
They leave the bathroom and head towards the library, where Hermione said they were headed next. They find the group just leaving and when spotted, Hermione sprints over to them and grabs Harry, pulling him into a hug. "Oh, Harry we were so worried! Where were you" Ron gave Harry a look that showed only Hermione was all that bothered and it made him smile. Draco grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the side, telling her not to badger Harry about his day, saying he needs space. She looked sceptical but nodded nonetheless.
Draco decided to ignore this and closed the distance between the two. He looked down, nervous before looking into Harry's enchanting emerald eyes.
Harry decided to be bold and licked into Draco's mouth, mapping it out before the blond took dominance. Draco groaned as he returned the kiss with fervour before the two pulled away to catch their breath.
It took him a moment to gain his bearings but when he groggily opened his mercury eyes to find a certain raven smiling up at him happily, he began to grin.
About one week later Harry found himself wandering down the corridors in the early hours of the morning, unable to sleep yet again, despite his constant fatigue. Approaching the steps of the astronomy tower, he could hear muttering in the distance belonging to the grumpy caretaker, who never seemed to retire.
They had to face their friends at some point.
The day began to come back to him and he sobered slightly, taking Harry's arms in his own and gently brushing a hand over the bumps, ensuring they were healing properly.
The boy jerked suddenly, seemingly pulled abruptly from the dream he was submerged in. When his eyes came into focus and landed on the concerned face of the raven before him, he let out a heart-shattering sob and fell into Harry's comforting embrace, crying relentlessly and relishing in the comfort the other boy was providing him.
When Draco was finally calm enough to pull away but Harry didn't let him get far, holding onto his hand tightly and giving him a concerned look. Draco let out a self-deprecating laugh before allowing Harry to wipe his tears away with his one free hand.
He then began to run towards the common room, thankfully on the same floor as the bathroom, they had been in. When he reached the portrait the Fat Lady eyed him suspiciously until she noticed the unmoving boy in Draco's arms and her eyes widened.
Daydreaming and practising levitating the core of his apple, Draco suddenly stopped dead. He heard crying from somewhere nearby. Deciding it was nothing; or at least none of his business, he continued onward.
His scars had remained untouched for many weeks, and other than one small relapse, Harry had avoided any more by seeking out the comfort of the blonde.
Taking a seat at the Gryffindor table and refusing to meet the gaze of his friends as they enter, Harry ate his dinner in silence. He proceeded to his dorm after, immediately falling onto his bed, knowing he wouldn't find the grasp of sleep anytime soon, for fear of the nightmares that take control once he does.
Harry heaved a big breath when he finished, chickening out of telling the boy beside him of his brewing feelings.
Harry remembered trying to leave and being grabbed by Malfoy after stumbling before his vision went black, and he couldn't remember anything further.
Harry immediately leaned into Draco's embrace, surprisingly unembarrassed by the action due to each of them seeing the other break down before. They remained like this in silence for the entire night, with the blonde gently carding his fingers through the boy's raven curls.
Draco guessed that since Harry hadn't previously gone to the infirmary, that he didn't really want to go there. So Draco decided to attempt to carry him to the Gryffindor common room and see if they knew what to do.
The next morning Draco came to breakfast and returned to class as usual, and anyone who didn't know him well would have never suspected anything to be wrong. However, those who knew him quickly realised he hadn't spoken since he received the letter.
Harry took in everything she said. He agreed with most of it and she probably did deserve to be screamed at, but right now he just needed a friend and here was one seeking forgiveness. "You're right Hermione" he began in his raspy voice he tried to ignore "You have been a crap friend. But you're here now, and I need you to be there for me. So can you do that?" He asked gently.
"Harry" Draco began "Please tell me what's wrong, I want to help but I can't if you don't tell me what's going on. You had been doing so well, did something happen? Did I do something?" Draco questioned quietly, nervously.
He did however glare angrily at the back of Harry's head when he saw how little the boy was eating.
Baby steps.
While Harry remained in his deep slumber, Draco curled himself protectively over him, resting his chin on the dark locks that never seem to tame. He noted that as something he needed to remedy as he pushed his fingers through them gently.
Draco didn't miss this new tint to Harry's cheeks and his refusal to make eye contact with him. He internally smirked and bid Harry goodbye.
"Oh" came Harry's timid response.
The Malfoy Heir carried the Potter Heir all the way up to the room of requirement, where he asked the room to provide a comfortable space to relax and sleep in. He was quickly provided with a cosy room with two couches and a four-poster double bed. He set Harry on the bed, removing his shoes before he did the same to himself and joined him on it.
Harry couldn't have asked for someone so understanding to be with him on that night. Draco forgot about his troubles momentarily, simply enjoying the peaceful atmosphere surrounding the two after Harry calmed down.
"S-so she started talking to me a-and congratulating me on something. I was r-really confused and then she explained that s-she thought I was able to throw the effect of Ve-Veriteserum because I couldn't possibly have answered with you to the question of who's the hottest in the room" harry rambled, unaware of the effect the last sentence had on the boy below him due to being stuck in his own head.
Harry rolled his eyes, mumbling something about a silencing charm.
This answer shocked everyone else for two reasons. The first was that Harry said Draco rather than Malfoy, because, despite their new cordial attitudes, nobody realised they were truly friends. But what really shocked people was that it wasn't declared with an air of hatred or even smugness.
Harry climbed into his bed having bid his friends goodnight and fell into a restless sleep.
Draco began to clean the fresh wounds to the best of his abilities whilst attempting to calm his racing heart. Draco's heart was breaking because Harry had been doing so well.
“Er, did Malfoy ask you, you know, when you were a kid, not to mention him to me? Or did your grandmother?”
“Very little, I’m afraid.” Draco says, wondering if Potter would tell him what spots to see, or where to avoid perhaps.
“Draco-” Lucius says haltingly, sending a furtive glance at Narcissa, who gives him an encouraging look. “Draco, I have no problem with-”
"Hi Luna. You alright?"
“But not eating?”
“Aren’t Slytherins supposed to be ambitious?” Harry teases. Draco rolls his eyes.
. We have sexy couples magic - I can’t believe you didn’t know that it takes a lot of intimacy to share magic like we can-”
“You brought me here. No pain here, bubble bath, blankets, Mrs. Weasley, nice touches.”
"You will do what I tell you. Have you forgotten your debt to me?"
He strokes his fingers along Draco’s hip, and it tickles but he forces himself to stay still. It seems like it takes
Well, it’s stupid of Malfoy to give Harry blanket permission like that.
Draco watches in fascination and dread as Potter outmaneuvers the beast at every turn.
angsty :)
“So if you happened upon him and he hadn’t been abducted or tortured, you’d be down?”
For anyone who didn't know, last chapter's confused memory Draco shared about the city lights was a jumbled memory of what happened toward the end of Chapter 15 when Draco strangled that absolute creep and fell off the veranda before he was fully Obliviated
Malfoy couldn’t really deny either - his outfit today is a pair of fishnet stockings under those short overalls, nothing else visibly underneath them. Even the overalls are skimpier than usual, the sides laced up with chains, making it obvious he hasn’t even got pants on. But he somehow decided wearing boots was weather-appropriate, and his wand is stuck inside the left one.
“Damn, Ron.” He says. Draco tucks his feet up on the sofa, face contorting with discomfort as he does.
"I did too. I don't really need one anymore."
thinks is my most embarrassing fetish. It embarrasses her, but it’s not my most embarrassing.”
“She asked me a lot of questions I didn’t want to answer before I was working for her. But I don’t like to answer any questions very much.”
He’d mock Ron in the corridors, Hermione in class, Neville in the Great Hall.
“Good. Have you eaten since I left?”
“That, actually.” Harry says, pointing up to the purpled hills in front of them.
“I’ve got it! I’m doing it!”
Sirius smiles broadly.
“Underage?” Harry gasps dramatically. Malfoy reaches out toward the table, rolling a stray grape around with one finger.
“I don’t think so.” Harry says, raising his eyebrows. “And I think I would know if I did. You’re easier to be around, though. So I don’t… I don’t despise you.”
“Can you eat some more of your breakfast?”
[Harry]
“Yeah. He keeps the rules strictly, no mercy on himself even if I try to get him to. He hates being punished.”
“He does sleep a lot, usually at least ten hours, sometimes even with a nap during the day.” Harry says. Draco tilts his head.
He must speak with Hermione before Ron does.
“That’s it? Done.”
“Thanks for coming by, get here early for breakfast and I’ll make us something nice.”
“I will. Just… not yet. We’ve got a little time left, he’ll probably wake up on his own. And he's not my
“Sure, Pansy makes me exercise.”
“Say what you like, Saint Potter.” Draco says bitterly. “It won’t convince me.”
Harry suggests a few when they find the chocolate section, and Draco grabs a few of each that Harry’s pointed out.
“Probably. I’m lucky, I was able to defend myself. They shouted at me as I was leaving and I used my real voice to snap back, which just sort of gave credence to what they were calling me. They followed me out to the Apparition point I was going to use, so I jinxed their cocks and Obliviated them before I left.”
Harry sighs, stirring his own coffee.
“Okay.”
.” Harry says, understanding. “You couldn’t take a hair when you were-”
, Ron. Well, the snogging was on purpose, but it got out of hand, and-”
“So you’ll dress up like a female superhero in a comic from the 60’s, what’s your outfit going to be?”
“Yeah, we remember.”
“No.”
tell the twins apart and he remembers all too well how Fred's face looked when he died.
“Malfoy-”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, I know.”
“Do you have anything sweet lying about?”
Potter waves with a broad smile, looking, for once in his life, like he doesn’t mind the attention.
“How old is high school?” Potter asks with a frown.
The entire court knows by now - a year into their arrangement - not to bother the Royal Pet. They know to treat him with respect. If the luxurious fabrics and jewelry were not indicator enough, then Draco’s fine leather and gold collar proclaim it.
“Yeah, I know.”
“Draco, you probably sleep a lot because your body is still in recovery and that takes a lot of energy. Do you get tired easily, like by using stairs or walking around for a bit?”
Laughing, Harry settles both hands on Draco’s hips and pulls him closer.
the chapter the day I post it, but I've been occupied so I'm only now writing up a storm to replenish my queue.
“I did. It tasted nice, and I was listening to her stories. Did you know one of her children died?”
Neville shrugs again.
Harry wakes up as the common room gets louder in the evening. He doesn’t seem troubled about taking up the entire sofa or being so openly affectionate, although Draco stops playing with his hair when classmates he doesn’t know arrive.
Draco’s eyes slide up to look at Potter looming above him.
Aftermath
“You’d think, given that they’re older and bigger than us, and that there's two of them, the Twins would be the best at holding their alcohol.” Harry says, looking at the sofa, where they snore loudly.
“Is this about seeing George yesterday?” Harry asks. Draco rolls his eyes.
“No. But sure, George. Decent fellow. One half of a matched set that’ll never be the same. I didn’t kill Fred.” He looks up at Harry.
“And the drama queen has left the chat.” He mutters, leaning back in his chair and wondering where he left off.
“She’s very pretty. I will show you.”
how much I love your mouth.”
Harry thanks him for the update as Draco catches his breath.
“Ha-” Collin starts to speak, but Harry claps a hand over his mouth.
Harry feels rather overwhelmed by that set of statements.
Harry and Draco meet up with the Weasleys at the edge of the muggle neighborhood, everyone bundled up warmly and Mrs. Weasley casting discreet warming charms every few minutes.
“Well, you’re the only one I know who’s specifically
“Sorry for making fun!
Harry and Draco’s relationship was sort of a secret still, which of course meant everyone in the school knew.
Draco rolls them over so he’s on top, and takes each of Harry’s hands in turn, kissing his palms and returning them to his own chest.
He grabs Harry’s off the bench instead, and Harry half thinks he might be in for a hex by his own wand, but Malfoy only uses spells to clean their utensils.
“Holy shit, will it murder me in my sleep?”
"I know." Draco says almost inaudibly. Harry frowns.
“There’s a bit of- like in… outside Diagon Alley. Bricks.”
“I don’t want to be a bother.”
“Yes, now hush.” He whispers back, tightening his grip on Harry’s arm. Harry grins.
“No, not at first, because… well, mainly your last name, and you did bully some of them at school.”
“Stop remembering? What do you mean?”
“He loves you too.” Ron says.
Neville looked between them in confusion, and his eyes widened as Harry pulled on the stitch again, making Malfoy whimper and sink into a crouch.
“Yes, well it’s called a ‘silent investor,’ Harry, it’s not meant to be public knowledge. I doubt the Ministry would buy from him if they knew it was me who supplied the down payment. They might assume everything is poisoned and Neville has been corrupted.” Draco says.
Harry and Draco leave the Manor, Apparating from the doorstep directly to Pansy’s equally large, equally impressive house.
Harry sees the clerk moving to approach them, and he steers Draco toward a wall of journals, hoping she’ll stay behind the counter.
“I’m fighting.”
To you readers, does it bring you out of the flow of the story to have so little narration with so much choppy dialogue? It's choppy on purpose, but I don't want it to be like.. ~boring~ choppy, just awkward choppy as Draco relearns casual speech. Let me know what you think!
they spoil each other ;-;
“Knox, Potter.” Draco snaps, jerking his head and walking very quickly toward the hospital.
“That’s what my friends tell me. But I suppose I just worry about the people I care about.”
“Vot are you, a coward?”
“What would you like to do?”
“I didn’t
“I remember, it gave you fins too.”
a battle. So. Practical is most important." Harry says mildly, though he does think Malfoy still looks cute in his all black, muggle-wizarding fashion mashup.
The room is easy enough to spot, with a glass-dome-enclosed haunted mouse which Malfoy’d had in their flat beside the door. The mouse scratches at the glass when it spots Harry, and he ignores it as much as possible, as he had in the flat. It’s one of Malfoy’s creepier artefacts.
Draco shifts the bowl in his hand so he can rub at his temple.
“Yes.”
“Now is okay.” Draco says, stepping back so everyone can see.
Ron’s right. But that doesn’t mean Malfoy will make it easy.
“‘Mione, Ron’s about to tell you something and I need to explain first or you’ll never believe me.” He warns her, and she looks heartily amused.
“But it would be so fun, he could try bratting for once!”
“Any friend of you three, he’s a friend of mine too.” George says.
Draco looks immensely distressed at that idea.
“Yes it does, if you sleep when it’s wet.”
“No he hasn’t. Not this.” Draco whispers. “That’s the problem. Part of it, anyway.”
Hermione looks up when Ron tosses Harry into the chair facing her.
“Okay.” Draco says. His voice is weak, like he’s trying not to cry.
“What is it?” He groused, opening the door to Ron. Of course.
“Hello?”
his body and he never wants it to end.
Harry has to admit, he does feel very luxurious in them, and from the way he’s touching his sleeves, Draco feels the same.
“All the blood in my body has gone to my prick, but carry on, I’ll catch up.”
Draco, Greg and Astoria went back to their house after dinner, and Astoria proposed an all-night campout in the living room rather than planning on going to bed when they all knew they would stay up talking anyway.
“How wonderful!” Mr. Weasley claps his hands together. Mrs. Weasley is smiling widely with flushed cheeks.
I'm gonna be honest, I was intending to cover a Lot more in this chapter, but what is here ended up being way longer than I'd planned on haha..
“I presume you have some sort of dress robes, or do I have to bring you shopping?” Malfoy asks.
.” Harry says, grabbing both cheeks to squeeze.
“Malfoy, obviously.” She says, barely pausing to wait for Potter to return to his seat.
He notices Draco tapping his wand against the side of his leg almost absently.
the war wraps up so neatly that Hogwarts is left standing and Quidditch is still an interest for anyone, and
As Malfoy moves to snatch up the wrappings from the floor, Harry’s knees threaten to buckle.
“I won’t.” Harry promises.
“Do you feel better or worse?”
“You haven’t looked me in the face.” Harry says. Malfoy nods. “Is- was that a rule?”
Harry sighs, rummaging around in his desk for a moment. He brings a small package over to Malfoy.
The third night Harry’s there, he doesn’t disguise himself. He’s filled out a bit from his Hogwarts days, and hasn’t been in the news for years. His long hair covers his scar, with the back tied into a small knot at the nape of his neck, and he doesn’t wear glasses anymore, so he isn’t spotted on his way in, and though one or two peoples’ eyes linger on him, no one says anything.
Draco takes the offered wand. It feels strange in his hand, he hasn't had a wand in ages.
So Harry runs his fingers through the white-blond locks, seeing Draco’s fingers tense where they hold the book. He smirks to himself, continuing to stroke Draco’s hair.
“Am I ever. Potter’s the absolute worst of them all. I see him multiple times per week.”
Draco thinks for a moment.
Malfoy’s body tenses up, and he glares daggers at Harry.
Harry is surprised when Memory Draco turns to look at his companion and Memory Harry’s face isn’t washed out like everyone else. If anything, his eyes are brighter green than they are in real life.
This is clearly a challenge.
To Harry’s relief, Draco is able to keep his smaller breakfast down, and eats another slice of toast after.
“I’m sorry. Let’s go have some breakfast.”
“What is this for?” Draco asks against his ear.
"Fine then, heal my tits for me and I'll keep your sweet, sleep-softened words to myself." Harry says. Malfoy mutters curses under his breath, but at least they're not the magical kind.
“Oh, it’s just you.” He says, setting his invisibility cloak and wand aside. “What are you doing here? It’s past 2.”
“I always… I. Whenever he gets like that, I just feel like… like I can’t take care of even myself, let alone Astoria. What kind of husband can’t take care of his wife?”
It’s not immediately clear, because Peeves is flying around overhead throwing dung bombs at him and blowing raspberries.
Harry decides he’ll ask Draco to wrap anything he’s gifting from now on, as the box has a large, perfect bow on top and has been charmed so the ribbons flutter like there is a light breeze.
.” He drawls, picking up the tassels on his shirt laces. “Where to?”
asking, though not the first person he spoke to. “That is a ton of alcohol.”
“No no no, can’t be! He’d be a rotten pickpocket, he’s no good at being poor!”
"I'm going through a phase." Malfoy sniffs.
singing your praises?"
“No. Not for dates. Blaise says he doesn’t date people.”
“I know.” He says softly. “I don’t understand.”
“I-I’m s-s-sorry-” Draco cries weakly. He’s shaking all over, paler than Harry’s ever seen him and holding the bin like a lifeline.
“Er, fairly strong, why?” He said, trying not to cringe away from where Ashe was clutching his arm where he’d finally relented and put it through Potter’s jumper sleeve.
“Do you have tattoos?” She asks. Draco frowns at her, then looks at Ashe.
“Aren’t you glad you’re not traipsing around our gardens in this?”
“Are we on a date?” He asks bluntly.
“After the war? The war, where I was an active member on the wrong side and shortly after came into my very obvious, unconcealable Infairitance? No, I didn’t go back to school.”
All it takes is Harry’s fingers brushing once against Draco’s Marked arm and he’s done for, coming all over his chest and Harry’s hand, sobbing and wailing the whole time.
“I don’t know, I didn’t remember you.” Draco says.
When Harry finally gets into bed, Draco jumps onto his chest, worming his way under the covers.
Drake accepts the strawberry from Inkwood, cheeks faintly flushed, but turns to face her grinning girlfriend, who leans forward to whisper in her ear. Drake squeaks, clapping a hand over her mouth.
Draco screams, every muscle tightening as the intrusion starts.
“Alright, worst one-night stand…” Knox says, pondering. “Probably the last person I slept with before Luv, a bloke.”
“Of course you can. Would you like me to take you or would you like him to come pick you up?”
“Two, you have at least two secret passages out of Hogwarts.”
He brings Harry to the kitchen, where there’s a stove in the corner with a fire crackling. The cupboards are painted a pale green, and they’re already filled with glassware and china. The large windows let in endless light, diffused by the clouds overhead.
This is my Fun story so I can't possibly let things be Sad for too long!
“Yes.”
“I’m just checking…” Harry says, reaching out to give it a tug. It takes a minute, but he finally wriggles it back to function properly and unzips the skirt down to the waist. The fabric pulls away from the flawless pale skin. Harry tries not to look.
“I told you what I was going to do.”
They walk up to the third floor silently.
“It’s your choice, I know, if you choose to get rid of them anyway. But would you do something for me?”
“Sure. I hope you didn’t pack me trainers.” She says with a look. Harry grins.
“I’m sure I will, you don’t need to tell me that. I’ve been your partner for months now, and if you’re sort of a mellowed out high-society pureblood, I’m not particularly looking forward to meeting the uptight ones.”
“Not yet, I’m not done with you.” He winks, then twists from the bed to get something from the drawer. Draco tries to catch his breath.
Malfoy hums, and Harry spots a place he could stop close to one of the heather fields.
“Potter, good. Where is Malfoy?”
“No.” Harry says, but doesn’t elaborate.
“Marion is going to help heal your body, she needs to be able to see what she’s doing. She’s only looking so she can help you. Are you still uncomfortable with it?”
Scarlet eyes dimming to a dull blood colour, Voldemort crumples to the ground in a heap of robes and a clatter of his wand.
Harry sat forward in curiosity as the Weasley brothers took the stage. The entire audience whooped and laughed as Ron came out wearing a sparkly black ball gown with a wide grin on his face. He twirled for effect, and George bowed to him dramatically.
“You dated a girl? Why was she crying?” Draco asks, sitting up a little bit and listing away from Harry.
“Peppy is baking cherry muffins right now, is Master Draco wanting some?”
It was past midnight when Draco appeared in the doorway, clutching at it, smudged with ink and looking terrible.
The final Truth or Dare night of the year was being hosted by Knox and Drake at their cottage off the reserve, and Draco was looking forward to embarrassment-based revenge on the idiots he has to constantly heal.
“In general or because of the situation?” Ron asks.
Malfoy rolls his eyes, and Harry bites back a smile.
“If I fall out of this thing, you have to promise me you’ll Obliviate whatever healer puts me back together.”
“Oh! Special delivery from England - don’t get too excited, it’s not a gift.”
“Huh.” Harry says.
With the glamours removed, Harry had noticed the thin silver band on Draco’s ankle.
"Yeah,
“It’s built by taking the time to learn each others’ bodies, which can begin with snogging, yes.”
“I just wish…”
Draco takes a small bite of his eggs.
Draco sighs.
“It is hard to tell, because he’s rather bad at it, but he came to say goodbye when he left work the other day. Not when he left for Christmas, but the day before.”
Instead of the library, Draco goes to the dungeons, locking himself in the dorm and leaning heavily against the door.
a criminal record.” Harry points out.
“I-I’m sorry, I didn’t know.” Harry frowns.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re really wet, I’m not sure I can touch you without electrocuting myself.” Malfoy says, Levitating the Furby off the ground. “That’s what happened to your transport.”
"Right. So you just do stuff overnight until you crash? How much sleep do you get normally?"
“Please tell me you’re wearing a thong for Christmas Eve dinner with your very conservative parents.” Harry laughs.
"I guess you were busy that evening."
"How can I know what's wrong if you aren't honest with me?"
“Potter, must I remind you
“Of course I do.” Harry says. “But I miss them every summer.”
“The crying one, it’s okay for you to cry. Crying is good. I was just surprised when you started crying, but I shouldn’t have asked you to stop. I’m sorry.”
He comes back out wearing red, a stiff looking dress with sleeves on his arms like they’ve fallen off his shoulders and a large skirt.
“Unrefined? You wanna keep riding that high horse or will you deign to grace us mere mortals with your comments?” Archie says angrily.
Harry shrugs.
Harry shrugs up at Marion, who makes another note.
Harry startles with a yelp as Malfoy appears in his field of vision suddenly.
Easing himself into the water, Harry relaxes as the heat takes some of the edge off his nerves. He pulls Draco back again, sitting him between wide spread legs and deciding
“Goat testicles and I will
“I think I’m fine, it wasn’t anything, just empty energy and my shield cracked too soon. It’s hard to maintain it when I’m like this.” Malfoy says.
“-the reddest hair you’ll ever see outside Ireland, Mister Charlie Weasley!”
“Was that just now? The first one I asked?”
“He may not have a large appetite, I remember him being fairly small.”
“I wasn’t particularly concerned about his
Draco grins, shaking his head.
“Of course.”
“Into a woman, yes.”
“Smart enough to not be caught.”
. Fondue, and other cheeses, the bread-”
“Sit down, I’m just about done.” Harry says as he plates their food. He puts one in front of Malfoy and sits down across, digging into his own food straight away.
Grumbling, Snape turns his back to start writing on the blackboard.
“I’m sort of glad you did. I feel very special for being responsible for it.” He says tenderly, and Draco looks up at him.
“Oh right. Makes sense.”
“Lupin?” Harry asks quietly.
He’s done far sooner than he normally would be given that he hadn’t washed his hair and didn’t have to wait for Draco to pick an outfit, but knowing that Draco wouldn’t be done for awhile, he went outside for a walk around the yard.
Infuriatingly sexy.
“What if you can’t see my leg at the time?”
Draco waves at Willows to allow the followup.
He’s looking across the room at Harry, but Harry can’t see his face with the light from the window behind him.
Draco wishes he hadn’t asked. Should’ve known Greg would ask back.
Lucius tries multiple times to ask Harry if Quidditch training is going well, so Narcissa ends up asking instead.
"I swiped those too." Harry says.
Harry kissed Draco.
It’s Ron who finally steps in front of him.
“I came up here to ask if you’re hungry for dinner.” Harry says.
“When, Draco? You’ve been blowing me off for months.”
When Malfoy doesn’t respond, Harry lays back down, wondering if he’d made a grave error by drawing out Malfoy’s fairy side more. He might never stand still again.
He shakes, breathing heavier.
Harry’s body relaxes when he sees Draco sitting at his usual place, looking at him curiously, between Luna and Hermione, with Neville sitting across him. He runs over.
It’s near the end of term when Harry hears it.
“Alright, Harry. I’ll humor you.” She sighs. Harry huffs. “What paperwork do you need, I’ll put in a request for it.”
“Are you upset?”
“‘Night.” Harry says, waiting for Malfoy to let the door fall shut before stepping out of the bath.
“It smells like my bubble bath.” He says.
“Yeah, you might be gay, Harry.” She concludes.
It's not real - not a memory at all, really. But it's the only thing that got him through-
“Love you? No, I don’t mind you staying at all.” Draco says softly. He gives Harry a light smile, half his face soaked in the orange morning light. “I’ve got a whole lot of fruits I want to make jam out of, and I would love some help.”
"You don't know what you're talking about." Draco whispers.
"You weren't responsible." Potter says immediately, almost like it was an automatic response he didn't think about. Like he'd thought about it before.
“That guy is looking at me.” Malfoy mutters, quieter. Harry can see who he’s referring to - a bloke with a lot of rings and very short shorts.
“Okay. How’s this then, as long as it’s only you and me around the house, you don’t have to wear anything you don’t want to wear. Okay?”
“I don’t need to
Harry will leave the financials to him and Hermione to figure out. Though it would take time for Draco to get an understanding of what he has between his two family fortunes, Harry knows that he’ll be much smarter about how to use the money.
The man buys him another.
“I’m not different. I act different. I sound different. I’m the same person who hurt you.”
“Before. But it’s a different kind of itchy.”
Potter freezes.
“Fame?”
Draco shoves aside the wrappings on the floor already to make room and pulls the first gift off the top.
Once outside, they find their way back to where Malfoy’s cloak is stashed.
“Stand up, let me see.”
“Draco?” Harry says gently. He takes Draco’s sweaty hand. “Hey, it’s alright. You’re okay, you’re safe here with me - Harry. No one will hurt you, not anymore.”
“What if those were part of a set?” Harry protests, standing up and brushing crust crumbs off his clothes.
A face which hadn’t been fondly amused in Draco’s direction for many years.
Draco takes a long time, nearly an hour. Harry is glad for the magical water heater which never runs cold.
“My shoes sink into the dirt.” He says as an explanation. Harry nods.
Two other elves come from the kitchen, one carrying a vegetable dish and the other carrying potatoes.
Jack’s eyebrows lift.
“Of course, you can’t show up to another event in the
Draco sticks around after the games end with the excuse of helping Inkwood and Ashe tidy up, but more because Potter’s also there, and Draco’s not quite ready to stop looking at him shirtless
“Potter, have you considered working for the Ministry?” Narcissa asks politely. “Lucius has had great success in doing so, and I imagine with your fame-”
"Punch me, Potter, and I'll have you expelled."
Mercifully, there is no music now, and it’s fairly quiet.
“That makes me upset.” Harry says. Draco doesn’t answer, just wraps his arms on top of Harry’s, where they cross his own chest.
“Eat a strawberry in the most seductive way whilst keeping eye contact with Triss.” Crane says.
“To be fair, I did warn you.” Potter says as he’s levitated to the bed.
Narcissa patiently shows Harry how to plait, undoing his progress every now and then to even it out.
“My package is here!” Malfoy says, followed by noisy rustling.
“I will accept any other followups.” Draco says, unsurprised by the silence. “Very well-”
Well, except for this exact moment.
“Malfoy, I’m awake.” Harry mumbles, unable to stand it any longer.
“I’ve sat through every witness in this court today. I myself did not know Draco Malfoy at any point, but the likelihood of someone who is so remorseful for his actions risking everything he’s built up since then just for one ounce of protection from Harry, which is clearly not doing much considering you still arrested him, well, the likelihood is slim to none.
“Isn't it...” Malfoy begins, resting his head on one hand, elbow impolitely set on the table. “Don’t you miss your friends?”
I am really curious though, how many of you guys are reading all/most of my other current stories ? (Infairitance, Potions Prof, Grey Eyes and My Fucking Flatmate)
Draco throws his hands up, sighing heavily. He looks immensely distressed, and when he starts rubbing his temples again, Harry tries guessing what’s wrong.
“Can you tell Harry about the band on your ankle?”
“Men can dance together.” Harry says defensively.
“Okay, see you Monday then.” Harry says.
Tender, subby and pink-faced from Theo’s slaps, Draco reenters the party with Theo’s arm around his waist, though his wiry frame doesn’t offer much support.
“Your godchild is a menace.” Malfoy says as he exits his classroom and meets Harry in the hallway.
“I’ll be back in a couple of hours. Are you okay to stay here alone?” Harry asked.
Draco follows him into the kitchen, where he stands compliantly in front of the sink while Harry washes his hands for him. Then they go back to the sofa.
“I don’t know.”
As Blaise continues to pet Draco, he has a very difficult time coming up at all, and instead decides to just fall asleep until someone needs him.
“I did not do that on purpose.” Draco mutters, sort of crawling across the circle to where Potter has only gotten more smugly amused.
At first, all Harry can hear is Draco’s mind screaming. Not a memory, but a reaction.
“My friends and I don’t fight. We usually don’t even tell each other if something’s wrong until asked.”
“Uh, okay. Sure.” Harry stands, shrugging his jumper off.
“Fuck you, Potter, it's called letting off steam.” Draco sniffs, pulling at his cock absently. “And it's cousin incest not parent-child incest.”
They both look up, red-eyed and cheeks streaked.
“You’re supposed to have professionals do that. Avoid blood problems or infections.” Harry says.
“Maybe a half hour ago? Why, why are you looking at me like that?” Harry asked defensively. Draco sighed, perching himself on Harry’s lap to get the affection he’s been waiting so patiently for all night.
Scarrow whispers the question to him, making Weasley’s eyes widen.
Harry makes a point to find Teddy after dinner.
"Yes. Blaise Apparates too fast." He mutters. Harry gives Blaise a look.
“Makes sense.”
Still, every now and then, Draco does something ridiculous enough to embarrass himself in his own head.
“I’d prefer a trainee.” Harry grumbles, but he knows odd numbers are always tricky, as trainees are partnered up in the program.
“You and Weasley, find Longbottom. Have him take all the above age students to Gryffindor tower - no exceptions, every last student above seventeen. Once you’ve told him, find the other Prefects and have them round up all the underage students and bring them to the Hufflepuff dorm. To my knowledge, their common room is safe from the Death Eaters, who were all Slytherin. We’ll use that to our advantage. Stay there until further notice.”
“He’s in shock.” She finally announces. “He should snap out of it at some point, but it could take awhile.”
“How does this sound: let’s get some breakfast, then I’ll bring you to my healer.”
"Don't die on me, Malfoy, my love, you've got to pull through-" Malfoy wheezes, curling up so Harry's hitting his shoulders and sides.
"Expecto Patronum!" Draco cries, stronger.
“Yes. Am I in trouble?” He asks, holding his wrist out.
“You’ve given me everything already.”
“It’s very complicated, Mother.” Malfoy says distractedly, standing on his toes to stare at a spot where the stoat’s fur is singed.
dirty ad?”
“Ron said he’s alright.”
“I think that was Fenrir.” He says uncertainly.
“Oh good for you then, my apologies.” He says sarcastically. “And pardon me for wanting to look my best.”
The song stops when Malfoy notices Harry.
“I’m bringing you to a healer tomorrow.” Harry says, gesturing for Malfoy to come back into the bedroom and shutting off the light. “Are all the dancers there hostages?”
“Tell me-”
It sends a shiver along Draco’s spine.
“Then show me the robes.” Harry shrugs.
"No, I do sell things. I've created several new potions and sell them exclusively from here on demand. I also have various necromantic services, though I don't claim to have the ins and outs down pat yet. I do more just-died stuff at St. Mungo’s - the healers all hate me, but they can't say I'm not effective."
Draco snaps his box shut.
“Yeah, clearly. It’s alright. I was a bit worried about you, but you made it relatively unscathed.”
Draco frowns.
Harry shrugs.
Malfoy doesn't turn back around, and when Harry mumbles an awkward goodbye, he sees Malfoy Summon his cloak again and fasten it back around himself.
“It- it is fucked up.” He wheezes. Harry laughs along, but he pulls away slightly to look through the darkness at Draco’s face.
“No.” Malfoy says.
“Okay.” He finally says.
“I have some regrets.” Harry says blankly.
After lunch, they spend the afternoon in the library in their respective chairs, with Draco reading
Harry’s mouth drops open.
“I don’t get it, though. Why me? Why not… I dunno, your mum? Or Blaise, or someone?”
“Malfoy?” Ron squints at the seemingly empty air.
“Didn’t sleep well, is all.” Harry assures him, trying to be more careful with the plants while Neville keeps a concerned eye on him. He doesn’t have the best track record when he’s distracted.
The group gathered around in a circle whilst Pansy explained the rule. "Ok, so if you choose dare you have to take a shot of Firewhiskey and do it, no backing out no matter what. If you refuse you'll get a sharp pain in your leg that will remain until you carry out the dare. If you choose truth, you place a drop of this on your tongue before answering."
Draco shifted and pondered the offer. Of course, the boy wanted more than to be considered a mutual insomniac, however, currently, he'd take what he could get. He also had the hope that this could help them grow closer and create some trust between the ex rivals. "Okay," he replied quietly, flashing a small but genuine smile to the boy beside him. Harry responded in kind and the two reverted to silence.
Harry took all of this in and seemed to ponder this newfound information.
Draco sighed, he supposed that would do for now.
The door to the Gryffindor common room opened, allowing the young boy inside. His raven hair covered hi emerald eyes, hiding his apprehension with the aid of his practised mask. Harry looked around the room for a sign of his two friends, naively hoping he could escape their notice and sneak up to bed.
"What is it Parkinson," Hermione asked after Ron had moved on. "It's about Draco and Harry". This got Hermione's attention instantly and she pulled Pansy towards herself before dragging her into the nearest empty classroom. "Spill," she told her.
It started innocent enough, asking about crushes, friends finding out things their friend had kept secret. The dares consisted of simple pecks on the cheeks or lips of a random person in the group.
Now Harry was very confused and had absolutely no idea how to respond to that so he just smiled hesitantly and asked as politely as possible, what in Merlin's name Ginny was going on about. Ginny, of course, explained what she believed to be true about Harry faking by saying Draco's name.
After going over them in his head again, Harry decided that, for once, Draco was right. Clearly, no one wanted him there or somebody would have come to talk to him, sent him a letter, anything. But he got nothing, no communication whatsoever. He gazed at his unblemished arms and went to find the nearest bathroom. Entering, he removed the glamour around his arms and face. Harry looked at the mirror to see his sunken in cheekbones and hollow eyes. All he could think of was how disgusting he was and how disappointed Sirius must be. He looked at his arms, at the torn skin, shredded by countless slices from his knife.
Harry's head started to clear when he heard voices mentioning that they are nearing Hogwarts. Casting a quick scourgify and replacing his bandages and glamour, he stepped out of the bathroom to change into his robes. After arrival, he climbed into the first carriage he can find and heads towards the castle, not looking at the silent third years staring at him in awe.
*****
Harry whipped out his wand, preparing to hex his captor into next week when he was overcome with a familiar smell.
He identified the voice as Ron's and began to shift himself to face towards the noise.
Of course, she was sure the first option was the answer and so decided to confront Harry to congratulate him on his incredible force of will to be able to withstand the effects of Veritiserum.
So he decided that in order to calm down and clear his head before approaching Potter again, he would take a nice stroll around the castle. He Made a quick detour to the kitchens to get an apple before heading off again.
Draco gave a soft nod and watched as a small smile crossed the raven's lips at the new information. "And, do you uhm, do you like anyone?" At the blonde's small nod Harry couldn't keep his shoulders from dropping slightly, already knowing he had no chance against this person the boy he fancied had taken an interest in.
Harry rested his head against Draco's shoulder as his eyes closed. The two chatted quietly about anything and everything, joking about the upcoming party and giggling about the potential dares they'll have to face.
Before they left Draco pulled Harry in for one last hug and kissed the crown of his head gently, smiling when the smaller boy melted into his embrace, relishing in the safety Draco provided him.
Thank you all so much for the support on the first chapter, I loved reading the comments and there were so many kudos, it was so unexpected so thank you! I hope you enjoyed this chapter too :)
Draco decided to take a long walk. He rarely admitted defeat but he had to admit that Pansy had made some very valid points and he really hadn't been thinking very calmly or clearly.
As Harry continued his story Draco tried desperately to focus on the events being described and not his increased heart rate at the thought of the boy curled up on his lap thinking he was hot.
All of these thoughts seemed to weigh heavily on the confused boy as he rose from his place on the ground slowly, almost on autopilot, his body seeming to know where he had to go.
After allowing Harry to nap against him for another 20 or so minutes, Draco pulled him away, not wanting him to get a crick in his neck from sleeping too long in such an uncomfortable position. Harry smiled sleepily up at him when he rubbed his thumb against the boy's cheek.
Ron went to snap at her to move when Hermione placed a gentle hand on his arm, silently willing him to stand down. He turned to her in confusion. "Yes?" Hermione addressed Pansy. "I need to speak with you Granger" Hermione gestured for her to go on, however, Pansy turned her gaze towards Ron before saying "Alone".
The two continued to kiss gently for a few moments before breaking apart, foreheads resting against each other's, eyes closed. When Harry sat back he looked into Draco's eyes and grinned giddily, pressing another quick chaste kiss against the blonde's lips before letting his head fall onto the other's shoulder.
"Malfoy carried me here?! Malfoy?" He screeched "And you didn't think to ask why the hell I was unconscious in his arms?"
Both got themselves ready for bed and climbed in, welcoming the warm embrace of sleep, trying to forget the happenings of the day.
Meanwhile, in the Slytherin common room, a certain blond had also adopted his Slytherin mask of indifference as he approached his friends. Pansy immediately began to grill him about his behaviour during dinner and his absence throughout the rest of the day.
Harry stroked a hand through Draco's hair, which had grown down past his ears and remained as soft as ever now that it lacked the copious amounts of hair gel he used to abuse it with. Harry continued to hold the boy until his sobbing lessened and turned to sniffles, Draco's hands remaining twisted in his shirt as if confirming he was indeed there beside him.
Despite the irrationality of almost all of his thoughts, the blood loss was not aiding Harry's thought process.
Deducing that the blood must have been Draco's brain in the panic, Granger thanked Draco and shooed him away, telling him to allow Weasley in "if he decides to behave himself."
Just as Draco decided Harry's life was far more urgent and began to stand, the pale and sickly looking boy finally responded.
He watched as Harry was interrogated by his frizzy-haired friend, sighing quietly in relief when she finally seemed to lay off thanks to the Weasel.
After the class was over, Hermione and Ron went ahead. She was trying to convince Ron to take up Arithmancy and Harry didn't want to be dragged into THAT conversation.
She smiled happily as she spotted Harry, heading towards where he was seated quickly. Draco tensed slightly, noticing the ginger's line of sight and narrowed his eyes, much to his friend's suspicions.
Pansy looked up when the Portrait slammed open to see a fuming Draco Malfoy giving everyone a death glare. She jumped up immediately, leaving potions homework abandoned on the desk beside her and she grabbed Draco's sleeve, dragging her to the corner, away from prying eyes.
"Oh my Merlin, give him here"
He told Draco that he'd have to consider what he had been told.
"Sure Malfoy" was all Harry could say back. He took a deep breath to try and rid the black spots from his vision.
They seemed happy however and Harry wasn't going to ruin that by voicing his opinion. Pansy and Hermione had planned another gathering for that Saturday and everyone seemed excited to attend. It seemed the seventh and eighth years had begun to enjoy and anticipate the enjoyable nights. They were an escape for some of the troubled teens.
Draco then began to panic. He had managed to catch Harry just before he fell but he was now sitting on the ground with an unconscious boy who hates him, on top of him.
He arrived at the great hall and made a beeline for the Gryffindor table, hoping to avoid the stares; or at least block them out.
"What's wrong with me," the boy asked brokenly, shattering Draco's heart further as he rushed to reassure him that there was absolutely nothing wrong with him and that he was completely normal and perfect. (Well I mean, as normal as a wizard can be.)
"Harry, come on Harry, wake up, please" Draco prompted gently. At the lack of reaction, Draco became slightly more worried. After no reaction still, he became slightly frantic.
The calm that seemed to fall over the two groups was shattered pretty quickly when Ginny entered the room, her long red hair flowing like liquid copper down her back.
Harry's jaw dropped and Draco's eyes widened. Blaise barked a laugh whilst the girls giggled to themselves. "Absolutely not-" Harry began before feeling a sharp pain shoot up his leg. He grunted in pain and all eyes landed back on him. Hermione's eyes gleamed as she reminded him of what would occur if he refused the dare.
"Harry please, you've got to wake up for me! Harry!"
However, he regretted not staying with them when he felt himself being dragged into a storeroom near the classroom.
"It's ok darling, take your time, I'm here." There that name was again. It seemed so natural to the boys that it again went unacknowledged.
The game went on, the boys were almost forgotten apart from the occasional truth question because, despite the awkwardness, it seemed neither boy planned on moving anytime soon.
"I-" He cleared his throat, "I had a dream that you were there with me, a-at the Manor and you g-got caught and The Dar- Vo-Voldemort," He cringed at the name but smiled at Harry's concerned but proud look, "He found you a-and he was torturing y-" He broke down again, "Oh Harry it was awful" He sobbed to the boy.
One such night, as Harry cracked a very corny joke along the lines of the Draco constellation and a fish, Draco let slip one word that shifted the atmosphere suddenly. "Shut up Harry," He said as he rolled his eyes. His eyes then widened drastically when Draco realised what he had just said.
"Harry, Ginny needs to take a hint, I swear she is so lucky I haven't decked her in the face yet. I don't care if she's a girl, she can't be doing this, forcing herself on you without your consent! It's not right!" Harry looked up at the blond with glassy eyes, before abruptly leaning in and pressing their lips together hard. Draco was shocked for a moment by the sudden kiss but reciprocated quickly, relishing in the feel of the raven's lips against his own.
Once he did, Granger turned to him and said "Tell me everything"
Draco thanked Merlin and Snape that he remembered to use the Spell "Vulnera sanetur" on Harry's cuts when he arrived, preventing the skinny boy from bleeding out his arms.
Once class finished, Harry left quickly. Having spent the entire class unfocused, thinking only about Draco's words, he needed some fresh air to clear his head.
That was where he found himself 6 minutes later, on the floor of the abandoned bathroom sobbing into his hands. He pulled his wand out and removed his glamours. With a sick noise between a laugh and a sob, Harry gazed at the old marks marring his skin, discovering that, thanks to Draco he hadn't cut in over 2 weeks. He laughed bitterly, guess that was for nothing.
Well shit.
"I-" Harry attempted but cut himself off as he choked another sob. Draco only held him closer, hushing him and trying to calm him again.
After what seemed like a lifetime to everyone in the room, especially Harry, Draco shifted so Harry could sit down. He slowly seated himself of Draco's lap and Draco barely registered it due to his lightness.
Harry was completely unaware of his newfound companion and continued to drag the silver blade across his wrist. Crying out it pain, Harry pulled his sleeve back down over his wrist and brushed away the fresh tears that stained his face.
Harry took a deep breath as he attempted to regulate his breathing. His heart was racing in anticipation of what he was about to say.
Ginny corners Harry and shit gets real.
"I- Uhm I was walking to the Great Hall this morning, w-with Ron and 'Mione when, uhm G-Ginny asked to talk to to me, so I went with her into this uh classroom and-" Harry cut himself off, frustrated with his stuttering. Draco simply hummed, confirming he was listening as he waited for the raven to continue.
He seemed to be successful when he looked down around an hour later to find the young hero asleep on Draco's arm.
The game continued but Harry couldn't get comfortable. He kept shifting around on Draco's lap until he was harshly told to quit it. He turned to Draco to ask why when he felt something underneath him begin to dig into him. He immediately stopped squirming. Draco did his best to ignore it and just pulled Harry into his chest so he could lean against him and they could both get comfortable.
Harry smiled shyly, burrowing into the warmth the blond was emitting. Draco chuckled and wrapped his arms around the raven again, before casting a tempus to find the time.
ry continued to babble as the blond boy tried to ignore the tightening in his chest at the mention of the Weaselette kissing Harry and focus on the shaking boy in his arms.
Seemingly sensing the blond's gaze, Harry turned in his chair slightly to catch Draco's eye, only to have the blond gesture pointedly towards his plate.
Emerald eyes finally opened and were greeted by soft mercury eyes staring back, swirling with worry and unshed tears. "Draco?" Harry's voice came, quiet, hesitant.
His eyes were immediately drawn to the slumped figure in the corner as he let out an anguished cry of horror and shock.
"I was in the Room of Requirement okay? I didn't think you try to stalk me to find my whereabouts." Hermione merely huffed.
Draco crossed his arms and glared at Harry awaiting a response, only then noticing that his beautiful emerald eyes had lost their usual sparkle; not that he had been looking particularly hard into Ha-Potter's eyes.
"Where have you been Harry? First, you disappear all day and then you just get up and leave dinner for no reason?" Harry scowled slightly when she claimed he left for no reason but said nothing as the girl continued to reprimand him for being so careless and for not telling them where he was going.
Taken aback Draco's grip on Harry's arm slackened. Harry, hoping to Merlin that Draco didn't see the tear broke free of his grasp and
Draco was aware of how difficult it was for Harry to stop, he knew doing that made him feel in control, kept his focus on one place and made him feel secure and present among many other things, so he was very proud that Harry had managed to take a break from it for so long.
"Let's go, Granger is freaking out" Harry gives Draco a look, expressing his reluctance. "I'll tell them not to harass you, I swear," Draco says. Harry smiles shyly, "I'll hold you to that"
Draco overcame his shock and sudden guilt and shouted out for Harry to stop. Turning around to glare at him, Harry answered "What?" however his voice came out raspy and sore. The realisation dawned on Harry slowly; he hadn't spoken in almost 3 months.
Harry looked into Draco's eyes in surprise at the action. However, his eyes widened comically at the whispered words that tumbled from the blonde's lips;
Which was totally manly by the way.
Harry reluctantly lowered his wand but never loosened his grip. He sneered at Malfoy and gestured for him to start explaining.
Ron explained Harry's unusual arrival the previous night and Harry's jaw dropped.
After a few moments longer, Draco finally roused Harry and convinced him to get up. He smiled gently at the grumbling Raven.
He had only come back to escape the Dursleys and the terror that they inflict upon him. No one knows of his trouble at home, at least not to the extent that it truly is. Not even his best friends. He had his Glamours for that.
He shook his head and attempted to shake the feeling. Telling himself it was nothing, he followed Draco out of the door and headed towards charms. He realized he had absolutely no excuse for his tardiness and inwardly cursed.
The great Harry Potter was blushing as he said the name.
Draco tried to explain himself but the remainder of the Golden Trio were unwilling to listen.
Draco merely held him closer and pressed his lips to the crown of Harry's head one more time before letting the exhausted boy rest against him. Draco was concerned about Harry's low energy levels, seeing as the two were sleeping for most of the day, however, he was reminded of how skinny the younger boy was as he rubbed his back, almost able to feel his ribs through his clothing.
With these things in mind, Harry made his decision.
He sighed when he saw they had missed the day's classes. He started to rouse the boy in his arms who he could feel was falling back to sleep in his arms. "C'mon Harry, if we get up now we can make it to dinner." Harry merely grumbled not wanted to move from their hidden paradise, afraid whatever was going on between them would shatter as soon as they left due to its newness and fragility.
Word got around that the girls were hosting this thing on Saturday night and Ron and Harry had already been made aware before Hermione even found them. They were highly sceptical but nevertheless agreed. Blaise and Draco were more difficult to convince but Pansy wasn't taking no for an answer so the boys agreed eventually, spurred on by the idea of alcohol.
Ginny was so proud of her astuteness, sure that her, frankly absured, idea was correct. She was giddy with glee, ready to have the boy of her dreams falling at her feet and even more smitten with the boy after seeing his skill in throwing off such a potion as veritiserum. She had never heard of anyone else having that skill. Although seeing as the Boy Savior had been capable of throwing off the imperius curse, she supposed she shouldn't have been too shocked.
Harry was merely gazing at him in awe, unused to having someone care so deeply for him as to go to such lengths to ensure his comfort and happiness. With teary eyes Harry nodded before throwing himself into Draco's arms, burrowing into the strong chest as the boy holding him chuckled.
Their conversation continues for a few minutes with Harry indulgently nodding along to Hermione's rant before their interrupted by the youngest Weasley plonking herself beside Harry and leaning into his side, causing him to tense instantly.
Harry woke up to a loud bang, followed by a grunt and a few curses. He began to take in his surroundings. He immediately recognised the vermillion curtains on his four-poster and determined that he was in his dormitory.
Harry had a decision to make. He could either drown himself in fears and what if's. Or he could take a risk and tell Draco everything, potentially losing the one person who seems to understand everything about him and new closest friend, which would only shatter the boy more.
Before Harry could panic further and question his decisions any more, Draco placed his hands on Harry's cheeks and leaned down to close the gap between their lips.

Draco turned his gaze back down to the too-small boy, continuing to comb his hands through the knotted locks. He began to hum, holding Harry's head to his chest and continued to hum the soft lullaby his mother would sing to him as a child, hoping the vibrations would soothe the smaller boy.
He was aware that now was probably not the best time to confide in the blond boy, with Harry bleeding and shivering on his lap, but he needed to get this off his chest before he chickened out.
Ginny grinned expectantly up at the boy, waiting for him to smile bashfully and shrug off his skill, as he was known to do. She was anticipating his bright red flush and shyly deny it, prepared to sing his praises and ensure he knew of how wonderful he was.
Whatever triggered this must have been massive.
Harry was more confused than ever. He didn't know what had changed in the last 30 seconds and was sure it was all just a joke. And he said as much. "Oh piss off Malfoy. I'm not going to fall for that right now" he answered before finally storming back to the common room.
Hermione was tearing up by now and barely stifled a sob when Pansy mentions Draco's past experience. "I just thought you should know, I would've wanted to if it was Draco." Hermione nodded slowly and wiped her tears, calming herself.
They didn't seem very happy.
The game was coming to a close and, after Hermione casting a quick tempus and finding it was well past 1 in the morning, the group decided to call it a night. Harry get up quickly and Draco was relieved that his problem was gone.
It was enough to halt the yelling and cursing coming from the two.
Once everyone had arrived, Pansy took out the firewhiskey and began pouring shots. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves for the first hour before things started to slow and people got bored.
As Harry's form melted into the comfort the blond's embrace provided, his trembling stopped and he calmed down, stopping his muttering to enjoy the safety he felt in the hold he'd become used to. Draco smiled when he felt the younger boy relaxing, happy to know he was part of the boy's safe space.
Harry gave in and allowed himself against the toned chest supporting him. Draco sighed and his breath on Harry's shoulder made him shiver. Draco smirked, proud of the effect he had on the younger boy but then remembered his own situation and sighed again, only causing Harry to shiver more.
She was right to be hesitant.
Having received confirmation, Draco nodded back and the two stood to leave, sharing one last soft kiss before they left their separate ways with promises to see each other later after they dealt with their friends, who honestly acted more like vultures than people when it came to information.
Just as Draco was sure Harry had fallen asleep, he heard the brunette utter a small 'Thank you Draco' which brought a fond grin to the face of the blond. When the younger boy was truly asleep Draco cast a disillusionment charm over the two of them before heading out of the bathroom with the bloody brunette in his arms.
Sitting at the Gryffindor table, Harry was immediately bombarded with questions from Hermione, confused about his absence from classes and frustrated with his vague responses.
"So are you upset with Ginny then?" She questioned. "What?" Harry asked with wide eyes, "What gave you that impression?" Hermione merely gave him an unimpressed look before sighing and changing the subject to what they did in class today, earning a groan from Ron who immediately zoned out again and returned to his chess game.
"Don't worry about it mate" Harry responded groggily. His head throbbed but he did his best to ignore it.
Draco's confession sparked hope in harry for two reasons but he decided to address the easier one first. "M-my uncle always said that the gays were diseased and wrong though"
He relished in the tranquillity of the room. The two boys seemingly lost in their own world, the only people present were each other, and that was more than enough. They completed each other in ways neither knew was possible and it would never cease to amaze them, the comfort that seemed so effortless between them, radiating in their personal space.
Harry chose to ignore the snide remarks and walk off however Malfoy wasn't finished. Grabbing Harry's arm, he asked: "What is it potter, think you're too good for me?". Harry tried to shrug him off, but the movement caused a tear to fall.
(See the end of the chapter for
"What have you done Malfoy"
Draco has some demons to face and Harry's a bisexual disaster. what else is new?
Harry was, however, unaware of a pair of mercury eyes across the hall, that hadn't left his plate since he sat down, watching him aimlessly move the food around his plate.
Harry caught Hermione's eye and grimaced at the calculating look there, immediately breaking the contact and looking to the side. He turned his body slightly to get further from the brunette's piercing glare and the presence of the ginger beside him.
Hermione clearly had different plans as her head shot up the second she heard the door to the common room, searching for a sign of her own friend who had been acting very strangely recently.
They seemed to take this in, deciding whether or not to believe him. Granger made up her mind first and dragged Draco into the common room and up the stairs to Harry's dorm to lay him on the bed.
Harry groaned involuntarily, due to a pounding in his head, causing Ron to whip around to face him. "Oh Harry, You're up! Sorry if I was too loud, I was trying not to wake you but dropped my book on my foot." Ron explained.
Hermione finally approached him and gave him a hug. Despite the hurt he felt at being ignored, Harry melted into her touch, not realizing just how much he needed it. Much to Harry's dismay, Hermione pulled away and began to explain; "Harry I'm so sorry I didn't owl you over the summer! I should have and I was an absolutely horrid friend and I totally understand if you don't want to speak to me!" Harry didn't have the energy to fight her so he just nodded dejectedly. "No Harry. I truly am. I thought that you needed space, and maybe you did but I should have realized that you still needed someone. So scream and yell and tell me I'm the worst. I deserve it. But just know I love you so much"
