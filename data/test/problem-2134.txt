“Please, Potter, let go I’ll be good I swear” whimpered Draco as Harry tightened his grip on Draco’s waist, it would have hurt, and yet still Draco made no move to flee. No matter how much he pretended, he wanted to be dominated, owned, hurt.
“What? No? Everything’s fine. Has she said something has?”
He wasn’t even controlling his own body by morning, allowing Ginny to guide him to the breakfast hall. She probably thought he’d had another nightmare. More like a nightmare came true.
Draco shrugged, “I don’t know? Change of scenery maybe, and he is quite fit. Plus everyone needs a rebel phase, I feel like me dating a mu— muggle-born could be mine.”
“You can slip out through our bathroom door, but it’ll be pretty obvious if no one leaves.”
“It’s okay,” Said Harry, pulling out and sitting up, tugging down his boxers, right hand coming up to touch his neglected cock, positioning himself at Draco’s entrance before pausing.
“Stop! Harry!” Draco shouted when Harry went to palm his cock again, “No! Harry, stop.”
Harry let go of Malfoy’s shoulder to hold his waist instead, feeling those muscles tense at his touch.
He looked at Harry at that, smirk full of challenge. Harry could feel the heat rising to his cheeks, thankfully Ginny was too busy giggling to herself.
“Fuck.” Harry slid up from under the covers hesitantly.
“Get your bloody hands off me or I’ll—“
“I know right!” Said Ginny, “Whitby’s always been horrible.”
“It's not! Get out!” Wailed Draco, bringing the covers higher to cover Harry more. “I’m serious! Out!”
“And ‘sides even if it had, it’s not exactly like I can talk to you about it.”
Ron sprung inside purple-faced and breathless. “Harry, mate, I think I’m gonna need you to pluck my eyeballs out.”
“Off-topic I know,” Harry chuckled, then focused again, “H-how can I know then, if you’re being real or not.”
“Alright you leave, I’ll sort it out.”
Draco snorted and broke this kiss, rolling his hips before sliding off Dean. Taking Dean’s hand to help him up, it didn’t really work as they both stumbled into each other's arms, giddy with excitement.
“I— I don’t like that you can do that to me, and that I’ll let you do it— that I’ll like it even. And,” he sighed not looking at Harry, “I just got control of my life back, and you keep— I hate that I like it.”
Please please please if u have ANY triggers with rape or non-con please read the end notes before u read this chapter!!!
Draco made a quiet noise, recognising him through sleep.
“No!” She quickly sputtered, “No it’s fine, seriously it’s fine. I’m pretty tired too, Harry, It’s all good.”
“What if it’s… more than that…”
“Harry?” Ginny called.
“Harry?” Ginny said, waving a hand in front of his face.
He wasn’t sure why he was so bothered by it. It wasn’t like he and Draco were monogamous, Harry had a girlfriend for fucks sake. Harry was straight! He knew for a fact, that he liked girls. And yet this bothered him more than anything. Draco and Dean. Fucking. Together.
“Likewise.”
“Well, I was.”
But Draco was already slipping out of the room, carefully slow so Pansy wouldn’t hear anything.
Still, he couldn’t help himself, making up some excuse about wanting to catch up with Luna properly, they hadn’t spoken in a while, and no one would suspect a thing if he popped out to get drinks with her.
Harry let out a quiet laugh, before swallowing Draco whole. Draco tensed, a soft squeak coming out, as his legs pulled in on himself, thighs pressed against Harry’s ears. He took all of Draco in his mouth, reaching the hilt of soft blonde hair. It
Draco looked so peaceful when he slept, hidden half beneath the covers, arms clutching at a pillow. Harry was drawn to it. Pulling back the covers to slide in beside him, still only clad in his boxers. His face was relaxed, gentle, eyes darting beneath their lids, a strand of over-grown fringe falling over his face. Harry reached out pulling it behind his ear. The slight touch woke him, eyes fluttering softly, lips pursing.
“Do you want this?” He asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And all I’m saying is that Malfoy isn't completely innocent here either.”
“Dean?” He mumbled, eyes blinking awake.
“Isn’t it a bit fucked up that you’d only be dating him because he’s muggle-born?”
“The prick who you bat bogey’ed last week?” Asked Ron, piercing his egg with his fork.
Harry chuckled and kissed Draco’s cheek wetly. “If I’m not mistaken, you’re currently missing ancient runes.”
“You weren’t acting like you were going to eat it,” she said, still chewing.
Also as usual, comments and kudos rly do keep me motivated, so if you had any thoughts about this chapter let me know
It wasn’t often that Harry spent the whole night in Draco’s bed. It wasn’t like he’d meant to. They’d gone at it three times that night, and Harry wasn’t sure he could get his limbs to function to move himself. But truth be told, he didn’t entirely mind it. It was nice, waking with Draco’s face in his neck, their naked bodies pressed so close together. He hummed, pressing a kiss into the top of Draco’s soft hair, watching his eyelashes flutter awake.
Draco shrugged, now grinning with his pearl-white teeth, “Oh he is, but you know how it is, Weaselette, some people just can’t keep their boyfriends satisfied.”
Ginny rolled her eyes, detaching herself from Harry to stare at Malfoy, before letting out a squeak of a laugh that made Harry’s whole heart freeze.
So I don't know if it's clear in this, but the bathroom that connects Draco and Harry's room also has a regular hallway entrance.

26 May: UPDATED FOR EDITS
Ron shook his head and clapped his hand on Harry’s back, “Please, mate, give me something to work with here,” and then he paused, “Ginny’s said some things to me, and it’s making me scared.”
“Don’t leave until you hear us in the hallway.”
“I seriously don’t think you realise how much you control me. I mean, fuck Draco, I’m here right now. I have Gin and I’m here right now with you. You could fuck my entire life up, my friendships, my relationship, and still, I’m here.”
It was strange that he missed him. Harry didn’t even really know Draco. Except he did. He knew his body, knew his face, knew his voice. He longed for something he never even really had.
Harry smiled as Draco pulled away, catching him and bringing their lips together. His entire body swelling with warming wherever he touched Draco. Not heat. Not burning. Not lust. This was warmth, soft warmth like a summer sun. He knew there was a word for it, but he couldn’t quite find it on his tongue. But it was strange how just the sight of Draco, even after everything, could bring him out of a jealous frosty mood, into something yellow and bright.
Ginny went pink, a rushed to throw her shirt over herself.
I've been so shitty at updating but i promise i'm back on a weekly schedule now!!!
“Draco,” he moaned, falling onto his elbows, their noses brushing.
Hi! I've been busy with uni so i decided to keep this short so ya'll weren't left on a cliffhanger of ages!
“Pansy!” Draco snapped, and Harry popped off Draco, eyes wide with a mix of horror and relief, thankful she could not see him from under the covers.
He was so slow, so careful, like he couldn’t risk losing this for a single second, leaning down to capture Draco’s lips with his own once more. His tongue slipping inside in rhythm with his hands, until it was two, then three fingers, and Draco was whimpering into his mouth.
Ron bit his lip, “This is going to sound weird, but maybe bring it up with Ginny…”
“Wha—“
“And I’ve done a lot of bad things, Harry, and Dean’s a good person. It just felt wrong to do it with you just hours after he asked me. And I’m trying to not be a bastard anymore…”
That was what Harry felt like when his brain let him think for one single second. Noticing the change from pretend to real, to very very real.
Sorry for that yall.
I want to thank a very very kind person who left an adorable message on my Ko-Fi today, I was having a particularly bad day and wasn't motivated to do anything but a checked my phone and read this very sweet message that really made me want to write. So thank you x
It was easier to pretend that Dean was wrong for him. But as another two weeks passed by, he realised that wasn’t it. It was Harry who’d been wrong. Never, not once, had Draco come to him. It’d always been Harry, showing up at Draco's house, or in his room, or cornering him behind a tapestry. Had Draco really ever even wanted him, he seemed to move on to Dean as if nothing had changed, they hadn’t even needed to speak about it. Harry’d just stopped coming to him after the conversation with Ron, and Draco seemed just fine. Happy, even. That was the part that pissed Harry off the most. Because Draco had tangled him up in his web of attraction, showed him how good he could really feel, but felt none of the withdrawal of losing it. It affected him more than he’d thought anything as minute as sex could. That’s all it really was. Sex. And yet he couldn’t stop thinking about it.
Harry laughed at him.
“I wasn’t—” Harry pulled his body as far from Draco’s as possible, which was difficult in such a small bunk. He was half-hard at the afterimage of Draco arching against him. “When did you come to bed?” Harry cringed at the domesticity.
But they didn’t fuck at work.
He takes one of Ron’s pallid hands between his two and rubs the freckles on his knuckles like that’s going to help.
charm echoing from the point of his wand. “We are making great strides for the security of our wizarding nation,” he gestured to the gathered crowds. “Look at how strong we are,” he nodded, and the Auror forces, rookies in the front and lines and lines of recruits new and old behind them all snapped to attention like a sea of red blood, moving in unison. “Look at how we have prevailed in these past three years.”
“I think you did,” Malfoy answered.
And the Oblivator — “Maia,” she’ll remind him, “Call me Maia, Harry” — will look old enough to be the original decorator with big hair and bright clothes. Harry will spend more time staring at her inked, psychedelic forearms instead of her eyes as he complains; it’s easier to pretend he’s not really there, to lose himself in the incandescent tattoos instead of grief.
“Do you ever want to get lost in it?” Draco was too close.
The kiss wasn’t an erasure, nor a memorial. It was a continuation, as raw as they had ever been. Harry kissed like he would throw himself on an AK to protect Draco, and he probably would. Draco kissed like he wanted to make it clear that every inch of his body was real.
Draco rolled his eyes, pink in his cheeks, a mocking comment clearly on the tip of his tongue.
“The watch was unaccountably boring,” Draco began. Harry brushed past him, walking to the edge of the boat. “Although I do have a new theory, based on the content of the— Harry?”
Draco laughed under his breath.
the Harry in Draco’s memory panted, explicit and in full color through their Legilimency link.
"Holding up?" Harry whispered as he pushed the latest text on Animagus transformation through the charmed bars.
“Maybe.”
At my loom, I had a view out the window to the sky.  So close to the city, we couldn’t see many stars, but I could imagine those that were missing.  I knew every constellation. Draco knew them all too, and he had this little spell to make the outlines appear in the sky in different shades of midnight blue when he described them.
Harry, face clear and obvious, no sign of a glamour or a potion at work. Draco took a moment, taking it in, re-memorizing the arch of Harry’s hairline (was it receding already? or was that but a trick of the light? How many subtle changes had Draco missed in these years underground?). He took in the shadowy bruise high on Harry’s cheekbone, the way it seemed to highlight the handsome blush even more, giving his jaw that perfect cut. He was
“I’ll have to keep you grounded.” Draco smiled, like he enjoyed the thought of being Harry’s tether.
“You know,” Malfoy says, and you’re starting to understand why nobody else wants to deal with them. “Potter here thought it was a good idea to start reading the spellbooks in my library out loud. Do you know better than to do that?”
“A butterfly Animagus?” Harry snorted when Draco first proposed the idea. But the Phoenix’s transformation had never left his heart.
VIII. October 2003, Islington.
“I was worried,” Draco said quietly, as smoking curled from his lips, blurring his view of Harry. He was enamored with the gentle curve to Harry’s new smile, the little hint of teeth tucked away. It was an expression he was used to seeing on so many faces, but it fit this one neatly.
“I just meant that—”
our wands, but I do wonder if this will give us an advantage.”
Harry blinked into the dim room, lit by the half-moon’s glare against the window. It was still late. Draco’s dreamwalking had ended too soon, and he was alone, alone in the too-big bed in the cool upper floors of Grimmauld Place with his Auror Uniform looming red in the closet.
He leaned forward, and Harry’s breath stuttered. Draco pressed his cheek to Harry’s, slid against him. Harry shook with it, with the feeling of his breath hard in his chest.
Harry obeyed.
“Alright,” Harry answered.  “It’s been a while since we said hello.  We can stop into a shop in town and grab a bouquet on the way.  Carnations, do you think?”
Draco nodded and rose, moving like water instead of man. Drawn by him, Harry stood too.
“Harry Potter has come to visit the Library.” Was the voice in his head now? It was too close, too much like his son’s voice. He wanted to turn and run, but he had to investigate.
First, never kill an enemy when survival is still possible. This one was easier said than done in many cases, and though he regretted each one, Draco had left more than a few bodies in his wake. Such was the necessary way of defending oneself.
“Can I look?” Harry asked hoarsely.
You stare at him.
Though Harry was quite strong, this portrait emphasized his shoulders, making him appear even more powerful, more intimidating. Tucked behind a thin pair of wireframe glasses, Harry’s eyes were a vibrant green, the precise shade of an
Harry put a single finger to his chest, holding both Draco’s wrists with the other hand. “You’re too competitive for your own good, Malfoy,” he warned, and kissed him again to stop whatever biting remark Draco would make.
“Hello,” the man with sandy blond hair tied into a neat knot at the back of his head said with a pleasant, unfamiliar smile.
“Fuck,” Draco winced, as Harry’s careful fingers traced the massive bruise blossoming across Draco’s ribs. “It’s fine,” he said quickly, setting his jaw.
Draco slides the heavy tome into his hands and steps off the ladder so they can spread it out between them, one hand on either side. Harry leans closer, pressing his shoulder against Draco’s and breathing in the feeling.
“We’re safe enough for now, you ridiculous idiot.” Draco ran a hand over his face, through his wet hair.
“Dearly,” answered Harry, taking his hands and kissing his assurance.
It’s raining outside the St. Mungo’s room, awful and unrelenting, and it’s been raining since Harry came home to drag Draco out of their bed and to Ron’s side, and Ron’s not waking up.
touched him.
“You’ve been in the walls, and hiding in the shadows, and dancing in coloured lights,” Harry complained. “Sending Illusions to deliver messages is not
“Cup of tea to your right.” Draco stood and stretched. Harry looked away, at the seam in the sheets, at the curl of steam from the metal mug beside him, at the woodgrain. Anywhere but at Draco.
Draco eased the paper out of his hands, and it was back away in some hidden pocket in the many folds of Draco’s coat before Harry could really process it all, and then Draco’s hand was away and Harry ached for its absence all over again.
, that could only mean real harm. Harry was the sort to get a deep and awful curse wound and not tell anyone about it until he was passed out on the floor.
He landed in an impossibly dull suburb somewhere in the middle of Surrey and ducked immediately into an alleyway, shrouding himself as best he could without magic. He was on borrowed time now, he knew it. He’d used his wand to Apparate and they could track that. They surely were tracking him, wand or no, as soon as he had left the security of Grimmauld.
Both of their jumpers, abandoned on their way to the bed, lay strewn across the tarp floor. Draco smiled, remembering the way they had distractedly extinguished the fire and stumbled inside the tent, caught up in the easy magnetism of being together and surviving another fight.
“It was horrible,” he says. I rub the blood from his palms; my hands turn scarlet with it too.
“We’ll have to get creative.”
. And every single day I came into work and saw it there, on my workbench, waiting for me…” He trailed off, avoiding Harry’s gaze.
The leader took a step forward, repeating his warning to give up his wand and raise his hands. Draco’s hands were raised, and he was looking for any chance of escape, though the possibilities were rapidly disappearing.
“Awfully rude,” Harry grinned. “I’ll have to report it.  Maybe I’ll write a
He dove.
“There’s only one of you,” Harry murmured. “And I want all of him.”
“Will you admit your collusion with neo-Death Eaters?” Harry asks. I can feel the rumble in his chest even in the memory. “Will you accept responsibility for the hundreds of Muggle lives already lost under your—” his mouth twists, my mouth twists, “—
It was nothing, and it was everything, and it was enough to throw their careful equilibrium out of balance.
Harry was prodding an unappetising soup with a stained wooden spoon when he heard the first raindrops splatter across the deck. Thunder crashed, lightning in the windows. The boat rocked suddenly, sending him lurching to steady the pot.
Harry smiled sadly, and Draco’s eyebrows creased in concern. He almost spoke, but Harry shook his head, looking at the fire. He was rather handsome like this, with the soft orange glow flickering over his features, reflecting off of his glasses and disguising whatever it was in his eyes that Draco could not discern.
He had to figure out why the Mirror compelled him.
The noise of the crowd was easy to ignore when the call of the Mirror was so much louder.
Drawn forward by something like magnetism, Draco pressed his forehead against Harry’s, no idea how to form the right words, no idea how to express the same feeling without sounding like an utter fool. Harry moved with him until their noses brushed against each other. Draco let his nose press against Harry’s, the tip of it rolling over the arch of Harry’s nose. And they were kissing, so gently, as if either of them might break. Draco thought that he might just break apart.
As he watched, Draco’s magic wove into the threads, lighting up the geometric meander of yellow at the border so that it began to swim. Harry sighed at it, entranced by the swirl. It pulled him in, a perfect, undulating optic, and he let himself swim in it, he let the tension drain from his body, till his hand on the mug was heavy and his knees felt like they belonged to the couch. The flowers began to bloom, somehow more red than they had ever been.  He could breathe again, the anger at Draco's disappearance, at Theo's death, at all of it out of his control fading like the colors worn from the carpet.
“I’ll see what we have.”
Hermione cast
Harry took a deep breath in, resting his head against the mast. There was no way to hide at sea.
Finally, finally, Draco dismissed his charm and appeared in the flesh, a metre from Harry.
“I’ve got it,” Draco says, and reaches across, flicking his rook into position. Ron grins, like he does when he’s about to destroy them, and makes his move.
“Where shall we begin today?” she’ll ask him, even though she’ll know the answer.
“Deal,” Harry said, and reached for his belt.  The game was on.
Harry set the intention as he dipped a final layer of wax and hung the enchanted candle to cool.
“Come over,” Harry said into the green flames. Draco’s back was to the fireplace, his long hair loose the way he only wore it when alone. “Please, Draco.”
Harry didn’t catch Draco staring the third time Draco saw him either. It was a massive press event, with representatives from the
Draco offered him the pack of Marlboros before he could think twice and watched him, voice in his throat.
Harry just stared at him, and Draco felt rather uncomfortable, like he’d said something wrong. Well, he knew that he had said something wrong, only, he had expected Harry to snap back at him, to banter.
Harry’s heart stopped when Draco leaned in to lick Harry’s wrist.
“So are you,” Draco said. Charlie had stayed at his position in Romania even after getting connected to the network, to the like-minded people who were working to change things in Wizarding Britain. Charlie had stayed on the surface, taking in news, sending it along to Harry and a few others as he could. Only about a month had passed since the threat on the Weasley family had escalated and all of them had gone into hiding.
On the third day of the third week of the third year of Unspeakable training, Harry had received his triad assignment. Deep in the cavernous halls of Mysteries, Harry had put his wand hand forward, palm up. Draco Malfoy did the same, and Theo Nott completed the triangle. They knew the words, the spells, the motions.
Draco moved to mirror Harry’s position, shifting until they were back at eye level, sharing space and pillows, not enough room and too much all at once.
until it stopped, stalling hard in his throat and he thought he might sob instead.
It should have been wrong. No one dances with a former enemy in the tiny gallery of the Tate. And yet, Harry’s hand settled in Malfoy’s and he couldn’t take it back. Malfoy’s hand fell to his waist, just as the Mirror-Draco’s hand did. Harry heard the music more clearly now, an unfamiliar waltzing tune, and moved with it.
There was little more likely to incite a Slytherin to battle than a good bet and a fair chance of winning.  Draco stood up from his knees in one fluid motion and reached for Harry, pulling him up too.  He kissed him once, firmly on the mouth.  “There’s one for me and three on you so far.  Whoever has the fewest weapons on them cooks tonight?”
In the water, Draco stilled. He met Harry’s gaze. His lips formed words. Harry hesitated.
The room warped around him like it was made of paper, like the stacks were unfolding and rebinding themselves.
“Don’t listen to him,” Malfoy snaps, rolling his eyes.
,” the voice said, and was so distinctly
“Do I look wet, Potter?”
“That was
“I do,” he answered, thinking it over. “I suppose we could pick out different people anywhere we go.” He pressed his hand to his lips, considering. “We’d need to sort out a way to find each other if we ever were separated.”
The hatch slammed open with a thunderous crack.
Draco was a little bit taller, but their eyes met. Grey in the steely night, Draco's expression was soulful, Harry's desire reflecting back. Harry hesitated too long, farewell words stuck in his throat.
III. 1998 - 2002, mostly in London.
Heavy silence stretched between them.
Harry faltered, then, looking over at Draco with wide eyes and Draco had to hold back a laugh. The man was so clearly stuck in all the Ministry’s brainwashing it seemed almost funny, almost unreal, except for the fact that it was entirely real and right before their eyes.
Though Harry had never seen Draco out of his club wear, the neat oxfords by the door were so obviously his.  There was a tawny peacoat on a hanger by the door; someone —
“I meant,” Harry started, shutting his eyes against the horror, still too shagged out to make sense of what exactly he’d said and why he shouldn’t have said it. “Like, that was nice. I meant I loved— that.”
Ron’s sprawled out on the couch and Draco is sitting — as he always does — too neatly, legs crossed, surveying the board like a battlemap. Harry is pacing, since he says he thinks better that way, towering over them and the board.
But it was too late. Draco pulled back and stomped up the steps to the hatch without another word. Harry threw himself back against the wall, legs caught in the quilt and the sheet. Draco was water, endlessly restless and impossible to hold still. Draco would slip through Harry’s hands before Harry realised he was wet.
"It's entirely your fault that your awful Gryffindor pants got into
.” The canvas erupted, utterly ruined. Draco snagged Harry’s free hand and cast. The gallery and the arriving guards spun away in the blink of an eye.
“I won’t spoil you.”
If they had been more prepared, Draco would have understood that the too-bright image of the New York subway stop, the green Astor Place station sign flashing, wasn’t Harry’s suggestion in his mind.
“Let me down,” Harry calls back, praying the wind would carry it down. “He’s going to be alright, we just have to get back now.”
“With my heart,” muttered Draco, “Idiot.”
“Obliviate,” she’ll cast, and that’s when peace will come. The memories will feel like fingerprints on glass in his mind until they finish the whole process and wipe him clean.
“Potter!” Draco bobbed under the surface, tugged by something unseen, and came up spluttering. “What the fuck are you waiting for?”
It was a good place to pick up the weekly zine, the
Draco and Harry used to move like limbs of the same body, sharing one mind, one goal, one heart. It was a surprise to no one when they fell into bed together afterwards, just an obvious extension of the dynamic they shared in the field and in the labs.
There is one bed in his room, though it is wide enough to accommodate my son’s tendency to sprawl, long limbs akimbo and blankets twisted around him, signs of a fitful sleep.  He was curled beneath the thin wool blanket I made for him. I spent hours rubbing lavender oil into the yarn as I knit, though it was but a simple stitch.
Instead, he said, “Yeah, I love Ron too, and Hermione loads. No big deal.”
The flat smelled like him, like Draco was made of the same stuff as the floorboards and the paint and the framed landscape on the wall. It was quiet away from the buzz of the club.  Still.  Aglow in the warm orange tint of Lumos bulbs floating in the sconces, Draco was more incandescent than he’d ever been on the dancefloor.
He expected to learn how to save lives in ways no Auror nor teenager could ever know. But there was more to it than defensive magic and violent attacking spells. There was also the feeling of Draco at his shoulder, of Theo at his back, a perfect, seamless team. A new triad.
The laundry machine in his flat had finally kicked the bucket after months of horrible squealing noises and leaking on the floor.  The landlord had patently refused to repair it, claiming that it still worked “well enough.”  Functional or not, Draco was left with a slightly-damp pile of clothes and a frankly sour mood.
“The spell takes an incantation, a golden talisman, and three stones marked in the name of Merlin,” Draco reads, scanning over the page quickly. “The incantation is here, it’s— well, it’s complex, but it’s manageable,” and he mutters some translation Harry can’t make out.
It might have been better if he’d just called the day off and gone back to bed, but that would have been the lucky choice.  Instead, he pulled his three best dress shirts out of the laundry and frowned at them.  Instead of crisp white, the shirts were an awkward shade of pale pink, streaked at the shoulders and utterly embarrassing.  Draco ripped the rest of the laundry out of the machine, appalled at the tinge that covered every one of his light-colored items.
“I can see it now,” Harry huffed, like it didn’t matter. Like it wasn’t possible. “Deputy Head Auror Potter quits the Ministry, moves to the West Country.”
“You must have left it on deck before the storm,” Draco sighed, as Harry picked through his bag too. “I’m not responsible for your disorganisation. It’s probably fish food now.”
“Malfoy?” he said, without looking up, reaching lower along the rope. It was loose, so loose, slipping through his hands as though there were nothing left attached.
Together, they readied the boat for the storm. Draco was faster and stronger than Harry had expected — tossing heavy lines across the deck for Harry to roll up, moving across the lurching ship like he was on stable ground.
“Auror Potter! Oh, Merlin above, I can’t believe it’s you in the flesh, Auror Potter,” a security guard interrupted, thrusting a hand out to shake. He wore neat black slacks, a Muggle radio at one hip and a wand holster at the other, as was the uniform for guards in this wing. He was eager, eyes wide and nearly sweating with excitement. Draco levelled a dark glare at him which might have deterred a less enthusiastic attendant, but not this man.
You’ve got three problems. First: their collective chart claims that the marriage bond was broken three hours ago, but second: neither patient seems to be aware that they are both free to leave. The third problem is named Sylvan, the willowy werewolf on a bad wolfsbane dose from bay six. He wouldn’t be an issue if it he hadn't also taken an interest in the bickering pair in bay three.
“Phantasmancy,” Draco half-murmured, half-thought, linked as they were through Harry’s Legilimens. “The study of illusions.”
about this painting,” Draco corrected himself, “but not exactly.”
Draco was leaning up against the brick wall of a small alley somewhere in Greece, the screeching sounds of children playing the square nearby making the space feel oddly private, exposed as they were. He wore the face of a handsome young Italian man, all olive skin and brown eyes. He was on his second cigarette, and Harry had still not arrived. Harry was usually better about making rendezvous points these days. Their evasion tactics had improved after over a year running.
“Maybe some rest was a wise choice,” Harry said. “But you're done resting, aren't you? You don’t come by to catch up.”
And then there were curses flying in every direction, and Draco could barely tell what was up and what was down and what was the sound of a curse smashing through cement and what was the sound of the subway train screeching to arrival. There was only one constant through it: Harry’s sturdy, warm back against his. Harry’s disguise that day had been taller than his, feminine and broad, with long black braids and a resting expression of fierceness. Harry shot a curse right over Draco’s head, missing his forehead by a hair.
“Right, er,” Harry was nervous, that much was obvious. His fingers flicked at the little paper tag on his tea, tugging at it, and Draco wondered how long it would take to crumble. Near the front of the room Ander was getting ready to speak, which would surely take a half-hour.
The room was silent for a moment too long. Harry peeked over his shoulder to find a flash of blond hair — Draco was turning too. Was Draco watching Harry? Harry snapped forward. He could be respectful. They never fucked at work.
Harry had never cast
Theo wasn’t there in the morning, nor the next. Their supervisors said nothing.
“That’s not what I meant.”
. He strained further. The waves danced just under his fingertips, like they were reaching back.
“We can change it from the inside—” Weasley said, right at Harry’s heels. He levelled a bitter glare at Draco as he passed, reaching for Harry’s shoulder. He touched and Harry flinched away and that was that.
As if summoned, Harry sauntered over, loose Muggle jeans comfortably at his hips, his pale grey pullover handsome against the light flush in his cheeks. Draco looked away from the too-long curl of his hair, staring at the rhythmic whorl of his drying clothes instead.
“I don’t know if you’ll like this,” Charlie grinned, the corner of his lip turning in such a flattering way, dimpled and yet he could never be described as sweet. “There’s someone new, but he’s just starting out in this life too.”
“There’s something in the water,” answered Draco.
“Did you hear about Shayla?” Harry said the words gently, like he was delivering bad news. Draco shook his head. He had been hiding out in Grimmauld for the better part of the past two weeks. The only news he got was from Harry. “She was attacked, Spike said. They’re not sure what, but she was in rough shape, all kinds of wicked curses. Illegal ones, but,” Harry chewed on his bottom lip. “Word is that the attackers were full-on in Ministry gear.”
He poured hot water into both mugs, unspooled a tea bag into each and tied the tag on the handles to keep it from slipping into the scalding water. Steam swirled  into the air, aromatic with the scent of Assam. An invisible hand ghosted over Harry’s shoulders and sparkled at the mugs.
“Well,
“You look clean,” Draco murmured, pushing Harry’s head to the left. “Smooth.”
When Harry yawned, the Mirror-Harry yawned, and blinked blearily in precisely the same way. Draco was just as touchy in the kitchen as he was in the meadow the day before. He ran his hands over Mirror-Harry’s hands, tracing his knuckles, over Harry’s scar, so gently and so lovingly that the real Harry felt it and shivered. Harry looked down at his hands and found them mimicking the movement though he had no conscious thought of doing so.
As the morning mist lifted, revealing the broken stones, bloody bodies, ruined lives at the foot of the castle, Harry stood alone, cloaked and watching. It was Draco who surprised him the most. Kneeling over the wounded, unobtrusive, unassuming, he healed with perfect blue magic, searching for no special acknowledgement.
“We’re safe here,” murmured Harry, moving so he was trapped between Draco’s arms. “We’re safe right now.”
“I don’t know,” Draco answered pensively, but he let his mind fall open to Harry.
“Well, I’ve got eight,” said Draco proudly, finally finishing off his trousers and whipping a stake and a bottle of holy water to the ground by the fire.  They clinked against the small mountain of silver knives and Muggle guns and Draco laughed out loud at it.   “So I win.”
Here, he was undone.
Draco knew almost everyone there, and almost everyone knew him. That was the way of things. You got to know each other and you got to care for each other. So Draco wasn’t the only one who noticed Harry, who stood out even more so for the fact that he had spent the better part of the past four years decorating the Ministry’s halls.
And then Harry was sinking lower, pulled by the current of something far out of his control.
“I don’t need words.” The voice was in the walls, now, in his ears, he couldn’t place it.
“You can check all the windows to make sure they’re sealed. I’ll cast a
Harry was in an inexplicably good mood, whistling as he checked the anchor.
“And what a tragedy that would be,” Draco snarked, though he meant every word.
“Let me finish this too,” Draco murmured, running his thumb over Harry’s half-shaved jaw, his fingernail sharp against Harry’s lower lip.
“Ron’s our new
“Absolutely,” Harry said, an annual surprise.
They both breathed for a moment. The quiet clearing was silent but for the careful sound of their exhales and a gentle breeze. A little bird flitted from one tree branch to another. Draco stepped backwards just enough to put grass between their feet. He pressed his toes into the earth, feeling the cool texture of the grass and the soil, untouched by the sun beneath the shade of trees.
.” He cast the spell with an open palm, moving his hand in the same swirling gesture he might have done with his wand. Harry did the same, copying him carefully, and they both looked down at the grass.
“Don’t you know who I am yet?”
“Thank you,” he said, even though it didn’t feel like enough.
Finally, he looked away. Harry caught his breath, unspooling from the hypnotic intensity of those eyes.
“Did you finish—” Harry started, and cleared his throat. Too close, they were too close. “You’re done repairing the sail?” It was still too rough, too intimate. It didn’t matter what he said, it sounded like something more.
They finished their tea in heavy silence. Then the dishes, quiet, clinking
Draco wanted to leave in the morning. They were meant to take a black-market portkey to the Continent. London felt like too many eyes, and the Ministry was only getting more and more violent. They could use only limited magic, if any, and knew that the Ministry tracked everything they cast with their wands.
“Draco. Or—
Harry took Draco’s wrists, one in each hand, and brought them over his head, stretching the sore muscles there. He scraped fingernails, just enough to bite, down the sensitive insides of his arms and Draco groaned, arching closer, begging with his hips for Harry to move closer.
The Lumos dimmed, a soft glow around Draco’s table. Harry tossed his glasses onto the small overhead shelf and shut his eyes. He tried to lose himself in the memory of Draco’s cool hand against his cheek. They didn’t fuck at work. They didn’t talk about important things. So what? He could manage.
.” He ran a hand through his hair (Harry did that when he was nervous, Draco had come to know). “You’ve got a damn impressive glamour charm.”
The bruise, like spilt wine on Draco’s pale skin, would only darken and ache worse before it got better, and Harry imagined a steaming peppermint bath in their future. For now, he leaned down and pressed a gentle kiss to the top edge of it, warm against the feverish skin. Draco shivered, and Harry kissed again, just over his heart, a little rougher on the unmarked skin. Draco smelled like sweat and tasted like the sun, hot and unyielding.
There will be parts of this memory that can stay: the feeling of Ginny finally, finally touching his arm and laughing with him like they were friends again, the way that Ron looked in the firelight, orange from head to toe and happy, and the brush of Charlie’s hand as he passed over a beer, like Harry could be one of them, like he was allowed to call them family.
“Did you find anything?”

“Roll over then, we can both fit. I'll hold you.”
They were in Nova Scotia, near a farm with the smell of cattle and the sight of sheep and green as far as the eye could see. And then somewhere in Scotland, Draco thought. He could hear a waterfall nearby, and they paused for the barest moment, sipping at their Polyjuice potion and panting at the strain of Apparating.
“I just… I got confused. I thought there was something different about this, about being here. I thought I saw you wanting me too, but I was wrong. It was just my own feelings reflected back. You’re Malfoy, and this is work, and we don’t blur those lines.”
“Does anything hurt?” I ask, sluicing fresh water over his shoulders, summoning the soap that I always use — oranges, cinnamon, bitters — to slip new suds across his chest.
— and they’re moving, and Harry’s still got the book in hand.
"She's a firecracker," Draco murmured, staring at Harry's lips.
. Harry recoiled, though he couldn’t deny it. They’d never given this a label, never claimed any sort of permanence for themselves.
Draco shook his head, "You're right. You aren't Harry, not the one I've known for seven years at Hogwarts. Not the one they knew in the war. Not the one Albus shaped to fit his own special mold," he paused to take a breath and removed his hand form LeFay's mouth.
“Yes, guests. Did you really forg-,” Sirius stopped in his tracks and turned to look at Harry. “Actually… we didn’t get a chance to tell you last night, huh,” Sirius bit his lip and smiled apologetically.
Ammit explained and started to move off him so he could stand. Harry stretched, yawning loudly before turning and looking into the full-length mirror near the bathroom door. He stopped to stare at himself, smiling slightly. His ears, and legs had returned to normal; his tails gone. He would probably miss them but he was glad to be normal again.
Harry spoke for himself, “I, we, are unsure of ourselves. As LeFay I am worried he will refuse us once he knows the real us.”
“No.”
Harry turned and looked back up at the dragon, only to have it as it turn itself and headed towards the water. Harry noted that the dragon still limped on his legs and the sun shimmered on his scales enough to light up the many wounds and scares littering the dragon’s body. Two more spears even poked out of the dragon’s hind quarters. There was also a couple feather tufted arrows in Draco's neck as well. The rest of the wounds, however, looked like they were healing well.
"Just do it, but don't move to fast," Harry ushered, watching the two like a hawk. He was afraid if he moved any closer Ghost might see Neville as a threat and actual launch a physical attack.
“I heard Parvati yelling and then there was a chaos of hissing noises. I don’t know where they came from but the sounded very angry. I was trying hard to stay conscious when I saw Seamus standing over me with his wand above me,” Harry bit his lip hard, he couldn’t believe Seamus would turn on him like this. “He said that if he turned me in he’d be rich. The next thing I knew though there was a black blur and Seamus was tackled by something, or someone. I’m not sure though. It was pretty big, that’s when I blacked out,” he finished and gripped his blankets.
Draco sighed and rolled his eyes before heading into the kitchen where he found Harry gorging on an apple he’d dipped in a mixture of peanut butter and honey. Seeing Draco enter, Harry stopped mid bite and eyed him for a bit before setting the slice down. “You ever notice that arguing makes you hungry?” Harry asked.
"I don't deny it," LeFay stated quietly.
Dean was hugging his sides as he laughed, trying hard to suck in a deep enough breath to speak.
Harry and Tatsuya have gotten along pretty well so far. Course, it's only been a couple hours since they initially shared one body in harmony. Well, a type of harmony that is. After telling Hermione about what happened and a very excited Neville and Luna, he heads back up to his room to show them, just exactly what he'll look like. For his first time it's unexpectedly easy. That is until he looses control. Hopefully it doesn't happen when McGonagall tests him in the morning.
“I expect you were comfortable while waiting?” LeFay asked, quirking his eyebrow as he lifted his cup to his lips.
Draco nodded, thanking him for the potions, and continued on his way. When he passed the wards he apparated to a town near the Forest of Rothiemurchus. He wanted to be as close as possible his starting point, along with gaining some insight from the locals in the area. Yet, to his surprise, he didn’t actually land in town, but right at the edge of the forest.
He found himself staring at Potter while he worked, watching the way his tails bounced around as he walked. He really was getting much better at walking around on those spindly legs. “It’s not really about sharing the bed,” he mumbled under his breath. Harry’s ears twitched, catching what he said and causing Harry to face Draco.
It was a good question, Harry wasn’t even sure. Why had he told Draco who did it? For sympathy maybe? No. Yet he honestly didn’t know why he had told Draco, or at least he didn’t think he did.
'I am the voice of your history
Jariss’ reflection looked thoughtful for a moment before nodding.
“You can use mine Remus,” Harry chimed in quickly upon seeing the red upon his second father's face. Remus smiled and nodded before Cogdigger came over to get Harry. Sirius and Remus watched in silence as Harry stepped into the middle of the room and was instructed on how to cut his hand. As the cut healed Harry could feel his magic springing to life and pain suddenly exploded across his body. He screamed as green and silver light enveloped his vision.
Proving a clear head, even in a crisis, Kingsley spelled the vomit away before asking sternly, "Gentleman, I would really like an explanation why our anchor is so battered!"
"No!" Harry gasped, slamming down his mental defences, as Severus approached his memories of Draco. Those were his, and his alone! Fighting off the restrictive hands, he stumbled back a few steps.
"That's right!" Draco immediately came to her rescue. "She did not betray your confidentiality. I … ahm … kind of listened in on her and Harry a few days ago."
good for her because he is as down-to-earth as they come. I think she is happy, and in the end, that's all that matters."
Entering the room, inspecting the plant, Severus placed a gentle hand on the boy's forehead, finding it clammy and hot. "How long did you smell these blossoms, Edward?"
Offering more juice, the Lady took in the distressed young man. "Before I begin, there is one thing you need to understand, Harry: Magic
The Auror's eyes flickered, avoided to look at Snape who sat at his accustomed chair at the table. Angling his body so the Potion Master was at his back and Draco in front of him, he nodded, "Very well, Draco Malfoy, did you brew a poison to kill Lord Alexio Rosier?"
"No. But I find it incredibly soothing to watch the water and try to."
But before Kreacher could tear into the muggle-born witch about her views on free elves, Draco rose from the sofa and stepped up to the trio. Putting his hand on Harry's shoulder, he assured the elf. "Your Master would never do that. Not when he knows that a house elf needs a wizarding family when he or she grows up, because otherwise the offspring would suffer and die from the lack of magic to sustain her growth."
Oblivious to the whisper, Lucius rose once more and began pacing the room. "But I did not know that at the time. Severus is right. I did plan on going behind your back because Hermione convinced me that it was the right thing to do. I want to put these Children of Hecate into Azkaban, so I spared no thought to your wishes. That's detestable. You are my liege and my first loyalty ought to be with you. If you chose not to make your own safety a priority, I have to accept that. No matter how foolish the decision."
When the head of the division started his speech, the vassal tried to edge towards the back of the crowd. While everybody seemed joyous and carefree, he doubted that they wanted to see a former follower of the Dark Lord in their midst. The persistent Miss Granger, however, seemed determined to thwart his attempts and he only understood why, when the Head Barrister came to the end of his speech. "… and all of this would not have been possible without the unexpected help of one person. A person who has worked on unearthing the true motives of Augustus Lostrife. Without your help, we would have continued to flounder in the dark, despite having our best witches and wizards on the case. Rest assured that we will be ready to work with you again, despite your current … limitations. So, thank you Mister Malfoy. Your support has been invaluable."
“It won’t turn off.”
It stood, great claw feet on the ground, as tall as Harry remembered it. The gold-painted wood frame had been restored by a neat hand, all its former chips filled and the gleaming, glittering gilt along the edges seemed vital with new power. Harry looked across the surface. The glass too had been cleaned, silver oxidation spots wiped away so that it looked as fresh as though it had been crafted days before, not millenia.
The three of them paused, hesitating. Draco reached behind him, putting his palms against the stone for any sense of comfort.
“This is not how I want to be remembered,” murmured Harry, jutting his chin out at the painting. Draco watched the play of emotions across his features. There was anger first, and then a softening, as though Harry was afraid that his current and righteous anger might look like that violence of the painting. “I didn’t ask for this.”
“I can hold this too,” I say out loud, half-broken, half-strong. Harry touches my shoulders to free me from the memory. “I’ll hold this for you too.”
The inscription along the top of the Mirror was the same as it had always been.
Draco snorted under his breath, kicking at a loose rock. If prevailing meant increasing security tenfold, sending out Auror patrols nightly and establishing a curfew during the week, then sure. They had prevailed. The wizarding world was safe from the threat of the Dark Lord once more.
“And that wine you got for my birthday?  From Blaise’s vineyard?”
, but it wasn’t very strong and Draco was an accomplished Legilimens.
But he came back, gasping again, shaking water and shouting something incoherent.
“We’ll dry the clothes, and put the kettle on. We’ll cast a warming charm.”
“Who is it?” Drack asked, looking carefully at Charlie. “The new supplier. Do I know him?”
Wolves mate for life, like cranes and married dancers in the fifteenth century and laughing lovers at Victorian masquerades. It’s fitting to begin this latest life as prowling enemies.
“Now they’re all lucky,” he said, and Draco knew this must be Harry. He smiled around his cigarette, leaning forward with it between his lips. The man now known to be Harry leaned forward too, pressing his unlit end against Draco’s until both flared.
"I think it's important for my students to read it," Harry added.  Behind Draco, the dryer began to thud insistently as it turned to the end of the cycle. Elena popped her gum once more and finally decided to abandon them.  Draco half-registered her bemused expression as she went off to instruct her classmates on the ways of detergent.
“You were supposed to be careful.“ Draco glared at the aftermath of their latest argument. They’d realized fighting outside damaged fewer plates, since their angry magic could burn itself out in the waves instead.
Harry was too incensed, and he knew it. “How about work? Tell me all about the fabulous research you’ve been conducting. Look at your amazing new tricks. Look at how much you’ve improved.” There was bile in his voice and he couldn’t feel the palms of his hands for how tightly clenched they were around the mug. “I’m so glad you’ve spent this time so well.”
? Never.”
“I’ll make you a big meal when we get back home,” added Harry, eyes earnest.  “With all the veg you could want, and potatoes and meat fresh from the market in Diagon.”
Draco looked so much taller like this, stretching high and handsome over him, his white shirt billowing at the sleeves.
“I’ve never seen your flat before,” Harry said, before he could stop himself.  They’d always gone to Harry’s, which felt shabby and awkward in comparison. Draco’s flat was full of unusual furniture and too many shades of royal blue that shouldn’t work together, but it did.
“Potter,” a voice croaked beside him, in between coughs.
"Right," he rolled his eyes. "Draco Malfoy, ex-Death Eater, Muggle-hater, and supremely dark wizard." He shoved a shirt into the dryer with a little more force than necessary.
“Oh, pity, I’m just talking a walk,” Harry answered, stepping closer, his wand obvious in his hand. “That’s still allowed, isn’t it?”
Harry’s face didn’t appear on a wanted ad, but he didn’t appear in the newspaper either as an “Apprehended Threat.” Shayla appeared a week later, and Draco thought that it might be the first time he’d ever seen her without Jill at her side and a biro in hand and it made his chest ache.
He hadn’t expected to see Draco for hours, until he grew tired of whatever research he could complete far from any libraries and took over the second half of the watch.
There’s soap in my hands, in his hair, and it’s the only defense I have against the tidal swell of heartache in my gut. I hate him in his Polyjuiced form. The Minister’s assistant’s shoulders are too thin, his hair too long. Harry’s lips are someone else’s lips, but I kiss him all the same. My hands on his skin are the only balm I’ve got to give, the only salvation I can offer the man who can’t stop saving everyone but himself.
,” he cast, and the spell burst from his wand, lit the corridor for a second, and dissipated. “
Harry stepped even closer, glancing just once at Draco before he raised his wand, making himself a bigger target. The one Harry had called Selwyn turned too, and Draco saw his opportunity.
“Are you saying that because you’re not sure if you agree with it?” Draco snapped, and Harry turned to him too.
Harry sent a half-hearted stinging hex his way, flicking across Draco’s shoulder, through his light t-shirt. “We’re already married.”
“Watching you like that makes me sick,” Malfoy snaps. “The bond is making me sick.”
Enjoy!
Draco could barely stand when they landed somewhere in Canada, the soft bustle of a crowd outside their little alley a reminder of how short this little bubble of peace could be.
Draco slid even closer to Harry, until they were pressed together from the top of his shoulder down to the tip of his fingers. He stretched his toes out so that the fire would keep them warm.
Three days after finishing at Oxford Law, Draco waltzed into Potter’s Pots on Diagon Alley and asked — no, told — Harry the time of their first date. Six years later, the Oversight Council adopted Draco’s Wizengamot overhaul plans, so Harry left his ceramics wheel and finally returned to politics.
It was there, that tiny detail reflected against the surface of his glasses, that Draco found the subtle truth of this painting. In the left glasses lens, wizards in traditional robes stood proudly, wands in hand and gathered together. In the right lens, among the barest twitches of paint swiped across the canvas, there were shadowy figures of Muggles, guns drawn and advancing.
Second, never bring a tail back to a safe house. Also easier said than done, though Draco’s skill at detecting and losing a tail was improving day by day.
“Anyway,” the man continued, oblivious to their shared look of near-horror, “I was coming to tell you that they’ve put your portrait back on view, right over in Gallery 394, and oh, mate, let me tell you it is more impressive than I remembered! Auror Potter indeed.”
It started there, but it didn’t stop. The sixth time they saw each other by accident, it was a very lucky thing. Draco had been caught putting up fliers with “Anti-Ministry propaganda” written on them, and he was stuck. Three Aurors, clad in the new maroon and black uniforms, sleeker and more terrifying than the traditional robes, were advancing on him. They demanded he give up his wand and would not take any excuse, though Draco did not have it on him.
“If they can’t break this, I’m going to have to kill you, Potter,” comes the posh voice in bay three. “Can’t spend my whole life tied to an idiot saviour.”
Draco stared at him across the room as he leaned over the machine, walking a pair of goggling teenagers through the many buttons. He was patient and kind with them, animated even in describing the minutiae of doing Muggle laundry. Harry chose that moment to look up and catch Draco's eye and Draco cringed, shoving the trousers into the machine and wishing he could dive in too.
The Death Eater Surveillance List was an open secret. Special Service Aurors were assigned a name and sent into the field. Cloaked in invisibility, Auror Potter watched Subject #283’s every motion. It was only in the dim Elysium Club, bodies moving, bass pounding, that he realized Draco was watching back.
“This is a momentous day,” the Minister - Theodore Rookwood - boomed,
“It’s a bit less about showing,” Draco began carefully, closing his eyes and relishing in the feeling of Harry’s hands, warm and gentle over his thin jumper. “More so about feeling. Listen to the magic, the way that it ebbs and flows.”
“We could do it, you know,” Harry said, quietly. He was always quiet these days. It was like realizing his world was not what he expected had shifted something heavy in him, something dark. Draco had watched, watched the weight fall onto his shoulders all over again, or maybe the weight had always been there, but Harry hadn’t realized he’d been carrying it. “We could run.”
“Good duel,” Draco sighed, healing Harry’s shoulder.
“That times have changed?”
Harry laughed, a startling, joyful sound, and Draco blinked. The spell was not quite broken, not if the warmth burning like a long-standing candle was anything to show for it, but Harry was pulling back and he was laughing.
A soft voice at his ear startled him, but Draco didn’t turn, looking forward. He felt and heard a body step beside him, so close that their shoulders brushed and Draco could feel gentle fingers at the back of his hand. “
“You did good with that vamp today,” Harry murmured, as he pulled a loaf of bread and some cheese from the bag and set to serving it up. He flipped one of the fixed blades up off the ground, looked it over, wiped it once over his trouser leg and started slicing the bread. “I thought he was going to get one over on you.”
He cleared his throat, tossed the remaining bits of clothing, including those cursed red pants, into the dryer and shut the door.
They were ambushed by not less than six wizards the second he landed in the crowded subway, all dressed in the typical Ministry black, all with their faces covered. That was when they still pretended that they were a secret police. That was when being one of Them was something to hide, not a point of pride. Draco and Harry had stood back to back, hands raised, watching as the six circled inward and the busy station didn’t seem to notice.
“With what?” Harry scuffed his boot in the brackish floodwater.
You’re about to respond, but both their eyes slide past you and you know, you
“My love,” Harry said. "My unknown road."
His eyes grew dry as he watched himself go to work at a job he clearly loved, laughing and chatting with coworkers. He couldn’t hear what anyone was saying, but he could almost make it out, as though listening from a great distance. It seemed this other Harry was some sort of social worker, chatting with gangly teenagers and parents. It didn’t matter what he was doing, this Harry glowed with a passion and a clear love for his work.
— had taken such care to straighten the sleeves.
The nausea symptoms should have ended with the bond. Have they even bothered trying to stop touching?  Maybe it's easier to pretend their obvious connection is only magic.
It was a passion Harry hadn’t realized he could feel, and yet, watching this version of himself, he could imagine it settling into his bones. He found himself smiling like the Mirror Harry smiled, moving to accommodate a pair of chattering teenagers eager to get a look at the glass. His view wasn’t threatened by a few curious kids. All would be alright if they looked too. They could see what their hearts desired. None of them were moved like Harry was. None of them stayed, like Harry did.
“Sure, let’s question my intelligence too.” Draco didn’t bother to button his expensive shirt, plucking his oxfords off the floor with a disdainful sniff. “Ta for another nice shag, Potter.” He waggled his fingers and let the bedroom door slam a little too hard behind him.
There was something wrong with the line connected to the anchor. Harry bent over the side of the boat, running his hands along the visible rope. It should be taut, the boat straining against the hard lead anchor far below, but it came up slack in his hands.
“Malfoy—”
Red for the blood spilled between them, in the past.  Black for our family, and grey for the Potters.  Silver for my hope for joy to come, gold for prosperity, success — whether in gold or love, let it come to them.  A strand of my hair woven through the middle for the magical protection it would carry for them. A mother’s love, freely given, is inalienable.
“Harry,” it said again, reaching for him, awful face turning into a horrible caricature of sweetness.
at her ankles. She moved too quickly, missing the Incarcerous and catching the biting end of the slashing curse at her shoulder. Blood bloomed through her grey jumper and she tossed her wand into her other hand, flying at him with a rapid string of binding curses spat between bitter teeth.
Draco and Harry are playing chess together against Ron because it’s the only way that the game is fair, and Ron’s still winning. It’s an antique set that Draco dredged out of an estate sale and cleaned and repaired till it gleams like it was made fresh yesterday, even though the hands that carved each perfect marble piece are centuries buried.
Though his body still rocked with the memory of the boat, Harry was on stable ground. Under the shower spray, almost too hot to bear, Draco held him tenderly. Soap suds sluiced between their bodies, rinsed from Harry’s hair, the last vestiges of seaweed and sea-sweat down the drain.
Bound by the gilt frame, his Mirror-self was laughing, free and joyful. Today, the parallel Harry was sitting in a wide meadow, free of anyone but his companion, a picnic basking open beside them and a glass of champagne in his hand. The sun was warm on his skin and as Harry looked, he felt the warmth burning his other self’s bare shoulders on his own, he could smell the breeze light and airy, taste the champagne on his tongue, sweet and bubbly.
Once dry, they pulled on clean jumpers and trousers wordlessly, avoiding each others’ gazes. It was ridiculous because they’d seen each other naked and yet this felt more intimate, as though their bodies, chilled by the rain and sudden onset of night, were completely bare.
Draco had wanted to get out of London in the morning, but Harry had begged for one more chance and Draco had acquiesced. It wasn’t going to work, but Harry wouldn’t hear him or his logic.
It was Harry who got distracted. A young Muggle girl stumbled and cocked her head, noticing the two remaining men in black. Harry, a saviour till the bitter end, dove to protect her, pushing her back into the crowd. Draco was almost too late. His spell, strong even then, was nearly not fast enough.
“Stephen King?” asked Harry, peeking at the cover of the book. Draco rolled his eyes and turned the page. Harry put his finger in the spread of the book. “He’s your introduction to Muggle reading?”
There was a small note curled in Harry’s hand, just a tiny bit of parchment charmed to go invisible at the wrong gaze. It was from Hermione Granger, or so he said. The young lawyer had stayed in her little office down the end of the Ministry barrister’s quarters. And yet, she had been a powerful ally, even from inside.

it was, with just the perfect austerity to it. They were aristocratic ears.
“Both,” Harry answered, getting to his feet and moving over to the dugout fire pit, piling up the sticks in a neat pyramid.  The sun was setting in the west and the cool night air was settling in their bones.  The hot adrenaline of a good fight could not last.
Draco stood, and they went down the hall. It was a familiar walk. The three of them had spent more than one evening pouring over notes in the great dining room, laughing about their missions over drinks in the sitting room by the fire with the awful carpet. Theo came out to the gardens with them only on the hard nights, when none of them much wanted to be alone, but most of the time it was just Draco and Harry’s spot.
“Fucking nice?” ventured Harry, hoping to salvage even some of the night. He ran loose, damp fingers through Draco’s hair, tugging at the back the way Draco liked it, but Draco stayed too still and Harry’s chest felt like it might’ve seen the wrong end of a Diffindo.
Without their third, Harry and Draco were a line, unstable, unsturdy, waiting to fail, a deficit of magic. Without Draco, Harry was a single dot on a plane, stable but motionless.
Looking away was no longer an option.
Draco moved quickly, Summoning the tent out of their extended bag.  He tossed the shrunken thing into the air over a wide mossy patch and cast at it.  It erupted into a neat white tent, the entrance about as tall as Harry.  It was well-worn, with a patch stitched messily across the front and a gouge along the bottom right corner, but it was better than the shack against the wind.
Perhaps if Draco had not seen Harry outside the shop, he might have been more wary when he found him for the fifth time since the war in the little Friends Meetinghouse late on a Thursday night. There were about thirty of them, little folding chairs laid out in the exceedingly democratic circle.
Instead, they sipped their tea and avoided looking at each other. Draco examined the chip in the lip of his mug, though he knew perfectly how it was formed, when one of his Illusions had held the cup and Harry had distracted Draco. Harry stared at the carpet, at the ugly pattern of flowers promenading around the middle in an awful, faded shade of red. A thousand feet had tracked dust and age over the surface of the carpet.
Soon enough, he’ll forget that they ever shared this bed. It’ll be easier that way.
“Do you really think he’d propose like that?” a woman asked her friend in a rolling Welsh accent.
“Close your eyes.”
, whatever, I can’t. I can’t.” He opened his eyes, but that was worse. Draco was everywhere around him, and Harry was awash in those piercing sea-foam eyes. “I can’t,” he said, but he was failing to convince himself.
“Are you done being angry?” Draco asked, finally, into the heavy quiet of the room. He rolled his sleeves up, tucking his wand back into the holster at his wrist. Familiar tattoos traced over the planes of both his forearms, and Harry did not stare.
I kept weaving.
Harry emerged from another meditative chrysalis, flicking wet wings and perching on Draco’s extended finger. There was freedom found in the ultraviolet otherness: in flight and in this homeward landing.
Oleander’s meaning was opposite to the soft pink shades of the little blossoms. Danger.
It was only once he was settled into the lumpy bunk that Harry realised he'd abandoned his own mug on the upper deck.
, it’s doing pretty well for me.”
and had
They curled under the blankets. It was less lonely like that, where they could share body heat and touch and oxygen.
Distantly, Harry remembered his abandoned shot, waiting on the bar counter.  It didn’t seem to matter anymore.  He couldn’t taste his earlier drink, couldn’t smell the sweat and heat of bodies and movement.
knew that there was some sort of organized effort going on.”
I knew that everything had changed when Draco gave him the bracelet.  It’s small and silver and shines when well-polished and carries the charm of a thousand generations of Black family.  But that was the marker: Harry was not going to disappear with the next turn in Draco’s whim, or at very least, if he did, it would not be my son’s fault as he had done everything he could to show his care.
The beauty of his skin on display was undiminished as Harry reached for the abandoned weapons and various holsters to begin the day.  If anything, he was more handsome as he bound a stake to his calf and slid into the shoulder holster, checking over the Muggle pistol before he slotted it into place in the leather,  He was gentle grace and deadly violence and Draco’s, all at once.
I watch it happen, blood on my hands, on Harry’s hands, the flicker-flash of the Legilimency burned around the edges with the force of his violent magic.
“Careful.” Draco wrapped his other arm around Harry. His whole body slotted against Harry’s, as steadying as the mast and the deck underfoot. “Do you think a Killing Curse would do it?”
It rolled off his tongue unbidden, too soon, while he was sweaty with the feeling of Draco’s hands on his skin. Draco froze beside him, warm breath against his neck suddenly absent, trailing fingers teasing at his pubic hair suddenly still.
Harry shifted, smiled, and let his expression turn neutral. “Did you find something?”
Draco grabbed him by the hips and brought him close enough to breathe the same air. His eyes were a shock of spread pupil.
Harry looked at him from his seat at the base of a wide oak tree, also barefoot, long dark hair flicking in the wind. This wiry body suited him, all long limbs and a strikingly handsome face with wide eyes and a perfect cupid’s bow. Harry sipped at the Polyjuice flask he wore at his hip now, all attention on Draco.
Draco always suspected it was fake. Even if the evidence of supernatural activity was incontrovertible, Draco attended each of their research sessions certain he was going to debunk it. When they’d first started working together, Harry found it annoying, like most qualities of Draco’s behavior. Now, he couldn’t imagine a life without it. Draco’s suspicion made his research perfect, his attention to detail unmatched.
“I know that,” Draco answered. “We all are, aren’t we? Just trying our best, however we can.”
Late in the night, after the moon had crossed the sky, Harry slipped down the steps and prodded Draco from his uncomfortable position napping on the table. Draco blinked at him irritably, made a fresh pot of tea, and went up to take the second watch.
v.6 no. 9.
“Well?” Draco asked, tilting his chin up.  “What do I taste like?”
Finally, gasping, Harry came up for air. Salt burned in his throat and his eyes, too much. He spat water out, suddenly nauseous from the rocking waves.
“I missed you,” murmured Draco, soft as the susurrus of dragon scales.
They landed in a little copse of trees not far from the lake in Hyde Park, laughing harder than they’d done in weeks.
Charlie avoided his gaze by digging in the satchel he wore across his chest, pulling out three large flagons of what Draco could only hope were Polyjuice. He opened one, eyeing the bubbling liquid inside. It looked right, smelled alright, but one could never be perfectly certain.
snapped Harry. It didn’t work.
Draco stepped across the room to settle into the uncomfortable metal seat, eyes on the black mark on the bottom right corner of the bag. A broken pot of ink, not caught in time to remove the stain. Draco remembered that night, the panic as they had run, grabbing bags and food and leaving more behind. They had left so much behind.
Draco lit a fragrant candle and Harry cast to clean the sheets. Their movements were familiar, a remembered pattern back and forth across the room. Harry stepped over to Draco, unbuttoned that high collar and exposed his neck. Draco slid his hands under Harry’s shirt, tugged it over his head, scraping his nails along Harry’s already-overheated skin as he did.
“Because of the bond?”
“Thank you, Charlie,” Draco said, and meant it. There was something settled in his chest. That nervous energy that had been building for weeks (or was it months? nearly a year?) had eased its awful grip and Draco’s chest. He pressed the folded paper into his hand and looked towards the end of the alley, preparing for a Disapparition jump.
"I know who you are," a girl with bright blue hair and even brighter red lipstick said, popping her ever-chew gum at him. Draco blinked at her, refusing to be intimidated by an eyebrow slit and lip piercing.
Selfishly, he wanted Draco to stay. They’d been naked together so many times, what difference would one more make? The idea of Draco lounging on the deck while Harry stripped down was enticing — a reminder that Draco still wanted him even when they wouldn’t indulge.
that convinced him to visit.
as he went. The Italians moved out of his way but didn’t reform quickly enough; the woman was right at his feet. He shoved through, only feeling mildly apologetic as he knocked an older man backwards in his haste. His daughter, or so Draco assumed, caught him and launched into an angry rant in Draco’s direction.
“Watch me,” Draco said, standing barefoot in the snarled grass. Perhaps there could be a distraction, a bit of hope. They were long without their wands and had grown used to the Muggle way of doing things.
“Shall we begin again?” he asked, a hand extended.
“Excuse me,” Harry said, and walked straight past Draco and into the shop behind him. The very coffee shop that no Auror had set foot inside without very, very good reason. The very coffee shop that Harry would have had to be brought to, by someone who trusted him and who was in the know. Draco walked until he found a bench and sat until his coffee was long cold and his head was still spinning.
Yes, Harry was lost in it, lost in him more often than he’d like to admit.
I was at my loom in the corner, as I so often am.  At the Manor, there was little time to practice my craft.  I spent my days minding Lucius and fretting over the food and the house and my own life, which left little time for those things that make me happiest.
“I didn’t mean the air.”
“Do you smell that?”
Malfoy points at you. “Even our Healer knows what’s what. This is all your fault.”
Instead, you murmur, “Just taking a new set of vitals,” as you conduct the familiar charms. Harry Potter’s pulse is jumpy, too high to be his resting, and he’s got a flush to his cheeks even though he’s not sick.
It was the distraction he needed to get the upper hand.
Harry can’t leave after hearing that, so he stays and listens and worries and wonders if there’s any trace of Merlin himself left to protect them in their magic.
Sometimes, Draco went home with Theo. Or Blaise.  Harry used to leave with Ginny once in a while, but not anymore.  He told himself it was only because she usually ended up with Pansy, too gone in each other’s eyes to spare a glance for him.  But Harry didn’t come to the club unless Draco was going to be there.
And yet.  Draco stepped over to him, curling a hand around his neck to pull him down, and kissed him.  Harry still kissed like he couldn’t believe Draco was real, like if he pressed too hard, Draco might dissolve under his fingertips.  It was probably for the best, as Draco still felt like the placid surface of a pond under Harry’s touch, so easily rippled.
So early in the morning, the museum was deserted. Even the special exhibition galleries were quiet but for the soft murmur of snide whispers from the few portraits hung among the walls. But Harry didn’t bother with the other galleries this time. After all, he wasn’t there to provide headlines, or to rectify his inability to remember any other object on view.
“When did you learn to move like that?” He’d meant to ask,
“Better be the best damn wands you’ve ever made,” he grumbled, but he was smiling at the sun.
His knees hit the deck, hands on the edge of the boat.
Even more bitter, Harry shoved his jeans down and pulled off his glasses.
The silence between them was palpable, like a vacuum consuming every exhale, turning it into pressure. Harry tapped his fingers against the leather of the couch, a staccato pattern of three. First finger, third finger, ring finger. Draco echoed it, rapping his nails against the ceramic mug. They went back and forth like that, a conversation without words.
There were so few things he could control when he was running. Not how long he would have in one city before the next. Not the moments he could steal to press his fingers into Harry’s skin, to taste him on his tongue again. Not even his own face in the mirror. But Draco could control who he trusted. And that was the way of changing the big things: trusting with your heart in front.
He landed somewhere near Kent and turned for another Apparition jump. Six was key to losing a tail, though he saw no obvious sign of his assailant’s partner following him. Perhaps he had caused her more damage than he had meant to do.
“That’s all I needed to hear,” Harry said, and finally,
Harry grabbed the mirror, wrenching it off the wall. It flashed silver in his hand as he brought it crashing against not-Draco’s shoulder.
Waves crashed everywhere around them, wine-dark in the deep night. Draco draped himself over the boat’s rail, trailing his fingers through the icy water.
Finally, Draco spoke, in a voice as soft as the blurred horizon line.
Harry allowed himself to look.
They were the perfect combination: the Illusionist, the Fighter, the Healer.
The Lumos burned bright yellow, hovering over the tiny wooden table. They didn’t speak, but they didn’t need to. Harry’s eyes had adjusted to the dim flicker of light across Draco’s sharp cheekbones and silver reading glasses. Outside, the sea was patient. The boat shifted almost imperceptibly, like breathing. Harry almost wished it were storming, if only to have something else to attend to.
Harry wouldn’t let Draco see it. Draco didn’t protest. There was something heavy in Harry’s eyes and maybe that was the Forest of Dean and maybe that was the note and maybe that was just a part of Harry that Draco could never understand. Such was the way of being on opposite sides of the war.
handsome it hurt.
“I know you could,” Harry said, and kissed him. Draco tasted like old tea and Harry didn’t want him to leave again. “You’re magic, after all.”
He looked at her, then, finally, at the clear passion in her eyes even as she slumped over the door, the eagerness in her voice under her affect of disinterest.
“James?” Harry shouted, rubbing the blood from his hands on his uniform. Scarlet on scarlet. He ran forward even though the door at the end of the hall seemed impossibly far. “I can hear your voice, please.” His hands shook. “Why are you doing this?”
Harry ate the orange segment by segment, rich scent bursting, filling the light breeze around them. Draco leaned forward and Harry fed him a piece, Draco’s eyes drifting shut at the little bliss of biting into the vibrant fruit.
“I mean it,” Harry looked at him then, a fierce intensity in his eyes. “You and me. It doesn’t,” he hesitated, but set his jaw. “It doesn’t get better from here, I don’t think.”
The Mirror was as he’d left it the day before. The room was more dimly lit than the bright, pale-painted main gallery. Black curtains hung behind the standing Mirror, and facing it on the wall opposite was a small display of cursed rings. Harry noticed these for the first time as he stepped into the gallery, determined to look around the room rather than directly into the Mirror.
“I did. I couldn’t stomach it,” he said, and really did look sick. “This is no better than during the War. They say it’s to protect us, to keep wizards safe, but,” he shook his head, wordless, and looked at Draco with worried eyes. “I thought I could fix it, staying there,” he added, “be a
“Outside Three Stones Bar,” Harry shook his head. “You smelled like lemons then too. I could have sworn I knew you, and I was
Harry stepped out of his trousers.  Underneath, instead of pants, he wore a thigh holster with a battered silver fixed blade strapped on.  “Seven,” he said, tugging it off with a practiced motion, till he was bare and vulnerable and without a single thing left to defend or cover himself.  He knelt down by the fire, staring through the flames at Draco as Draco hesitated over his trouser button, distracted.
Not-Draco moved even closer, crowding Harry back against the washbasin in a horrific mimicry of moments before. Harry’s stomach turned at the smell of seaweed and raw fish overwhelming him, filling all his senses.
It was meant to be a casual flight, but Harry couldn’t help but see a future in each passing house. There, he imagined lounging in the yard with Draco’s head on his lap. That one had room for kids. That one would need repainting, but they could do it together.
Sunset offered a fleeting moment to spite the curse and look across the meadow. Draco turned from his hawk form back into human, stealing the single moment of the sun’s hesitation when he could glimpse Harry. The sun sank below the horizon, and the cursed wolf claimed his lover’s body.
Can’t Potter see the affection in Malfoy’s gaze? It’s so obvious to you. They move like a matched pair of wands, like the bond between them is still true even though you’re certain it’s gone. Potter’s hand twitches when Malfoy’s moves; his eyes slip to Malfoy’s lips when he talks, like he wants to take everything but can't or won't.
Draco shook two tiny packets of sugar into the tea and stirred three times clockwise, waiting for the man’s acknowledgement. He breathed a sigh of relief as the blond man softened, the crease in his forehead easing and a subtle smile tugging at the corner of his lips.
“I like it when you kiss me like I might disappear,” Draco said, flicking ash into the fake grass flooring. “I could, after all.”
He hesitated on the side of the boat, staring at the ripple and whorl of water against the hull. Though the sun was rising, the air still had that morning chill to it, and the water would be worse.
Draco stared at her, a damp pair of trousers in hand.
Harry leaned against Draco to turn off the tap. The metal squeaked and protested.
"Goodnight, Harry," Draco said, quietly, reverently. He leaned in and kissed Harry's cheek while Harry stood open-mouthed. Could the ocean really grant Draco such tenderness? And yet, as Draco drifted toward the hatch, a hand lifted in goodnight, Harry could only thank whatever gods were left for the feeling of his lips on Harry's cheek.
“Good,” Harry murmured, and let go.
“No injuries.”
In the ring, they pulled no punches, spitting bitter spells across the arena. In the baths after, soapy water sluicing over sore skin, Draco stripped away his armor and sank into the suds.
Draco, breathless, shoved at his shoulder and curled a possessive hand over his bicep. “You started it.”
“How is this different?” Draco paused a foot from Harry, stopping the world from turning and the boat from rocking under Harry’s feet. “We’re still working.”
Harry couldn’t look away. Neither did Draco.
Harry sighed, pressing both hands against his forehead, and scrubbing them through his long hair. A bit of cement rubble fell out, tumbling between them. They both burst into laughter. It ripped out of Draco’s chest, a bubble of painful emotion that had been building there since they had run from the motel and he
“I won’t fall for you,” Draco warned. “I can’t do it again.”
Harry could see it now, the wrong-paleness of his cheeks, the sea-sick gray of his eyes, the pink maw of his mouth, the too-sharp brine of salt in the air.
It clicked into place as Draco passed over the Polyjuice dissolution potion. She drank it, and the long hair faded to something chin-length, her bony, lanky form filling out until it seemed to suit her properly. “
“I could get used to this.” Harry hadn’t realised how cold the nights on the ship had been until he felt warm like this again.
“Not much,” Harry lied, glaring at the fading embers of the fire. It had been roaring and warm when he sat down, and he hadn’t noticed it start to fade. The room was chilly without it.
“Love undiminished by adversity,” Draco answered. He let his glamour charms fade, shrinking until he was his normal height and his head, blond once again for the first time in many months - could rest neatly against Harry’s shoulder. They fit just right like that.
“Now cast,” Draco murmured, “
But there was something earnest in Harry’s eyes, in the intensity of how he said the words
The rain steals the words in his throat but Draco Apparates up to his side anyway and he does have it, and then they’re flying through time, the little gold Time-Turner around both their necks and all is going to be alright.
"It's a good article," Harry nodded, though he went pink at the crests of his cheekbones. Draco's mouth felt suddenly dry.
Harry snapped. His elbow connected with the face of the other Draco. He dove over the side of the boat.
“Draco,” gasped Harry, breathless from the exertion when a third song began. His lips moved in time with the Mirror-Harry, who paused too, resting his forehead on Draco’s shoulder.
“Grounded. In the middle of the ocean.”
Harry so rarely had a moment beside Draco in the morning. He was always so fast, too intent to leave and start the day. Yet here, he breathed as slowly as the waves, skin soft and slack. He was beautiful like this; beautiful with all the pressure of work and perfection drained away.
“Exactly like I like you,” Draco said. “
Harry sponged over Draco’s bruised shin. “I’ll beat you tomorrow.”
“You missed the last rendezvous,” the man said in a more familiar tone, voice hushed. There was a soft jazzy ambient music playing over the room, muddying the noise of the various Muggles milling about. They were all so carefree. One woman was reading in the corner, fiercely invested in a dog-eared novel, cozy on one of the public couches. In the other corner, a man sipped his coffee and typed away at a silver Muggle computer, fingers flying, a biro tucked behind his ear.
wash."
Draco peered closer at him, at the vibrant maroon shade of his heavy cloak and the epaulettes at his shoulders and Harry’s wand held up at an awkward angle to get it into the frame. Portrait Harry was angry, mouth curled into a determined and slightly terrifying curl. The scar across his forehead was exaggerated, slicing down across his eye, his hair swept out of the way to emphasize the pale line against his warm skin.
A bit of flirtation made the hours pass more quickly, anyway, and Harry liked the way Draco’s mouth curved at the corner. Like he wasn’t paying attention, even though he was; as though the research was his priority.
I can’t help but touch him as the last of the Polyjuice fades away, fingers following rivulets of water to track familiar lines across his collarbones, to press into the divot on his chest where he died (
Before he can go, a Healer in headache-inducing green robes walks into the room, clipboard in hand. She starts talking about a bitter, ancient curse and a healing spell lost from a centuries-old Swiss library.
“Coffee to spare?” Draco asked, and the man pushed a cup across the table, eyes still cautious. They were vibrant blue, with little crows feet at the corners where they crinkled, watching him. Careful. They were always so careful.
“I think the line to the anchor’s snapped,” Harry said blankly, staring past Draco, past the front of the boat.
Draco scowled at the separation, though he understood immediately when he saw Harry’s gaze.  He unbuttoned his shirt and unstrapped the sharp-edged sheath from its position across his hips.  “Better?” he asked, tossing it aside.  Harry’s hands were on him again, scraping over his bare chest and the hint of the holster at his shoulder.  He brushed familiar fingertips over the scars new and old, staring at Draco with that deep admiration that Harry reserved for him alone.
"I'll stay up for another few hours. Rest," Harry said, half-begged. If Draco stayed another moment, Harry would kiss him with all the force of feeling he wasn't allowed to have.
The young woman chasing him put a hand on his arm just as Draco fell out into the other side of the gaggle of people and he very nearly turned to catch her eyes. That would be his downfall, a powerful Legilimency link could be established and he’d be forever trying to run from this woman even as she had a direct link to his plans.
Catching his eye in the bathroom mirror was like seeing Draco for the first time. Kissing Draco’s shoulder as Draco told the story of getting the bathroom mirror was more intense than blowing him could ever be.
, ‘What would you do?’ You’re in another world today. I should have had them send me with Tim.”
And they were off. Back into the fray.
“A lead,” Draco said under his breath, into the coffee mug as he sipped it, keeping the tight blue gaze.
he claimed,
The Minister isn’t going to answer, that much is clear from the set to her jaw. She expects that the saviour will be a good man. He is a good man, but not by her standards.
Something pulled at his chest. Water everywhere. He couldn’t breathe. Water, so much water he didn’t feel wet anymore, just lost, sinking, spinning.
“It’s the question I asked myself,” said Malfoy. Harry watched the arch of his lips and wondered if kissing this version of him was as good as it looked in the Mirror. “I spent months working on it, cleaning and restoring it to the best of my abilities.”
My Draco, rather than restless in his sleep, was at peace, as though the lavender and the weight of my knit blanket had finally done its job.
Draco allowed himself a bit of preening at the praise, pressing his hands behind him and smiling indulgently at Harry as he walked back across the clearing. “Of course,” he said, “there’s nothing to say they can’t track us
His kiss was consumptive, consuming.
“I know that,” Draco answered, picking at the fray in his jumper. It was a small thread and he really ought not pull it. He tugged at it anyway.
Draco flexed, lithe Seeker’s muscles straining, showing that he’d keep his arms exactly where Harry wanted them.
Draco paused, mouth hovering less than an inch from Harry’s.
“Harry,” Draco said, looming over him to block out the moon.
Marena Morganthau, the Minister for Magic, reclines in her chair, mauve fingernails tapping on the desk. She smiles at first, and realizes he’s not who he’s supposed to be. It’s too late. The memory moves like a photograph, twitching forward wrongly, ruined by the frenetic frazzle of Harry’s magic.
"If?" Harry asked, devastatingly hopeful, but Draco answered with bruising lips.
, it was freezing. The cold ate into his bones with a charge stronger than an
curse.
“Is it?” Harry asked, tilting his head. He still wouldn’t look straight at Draco. “I didn’t realize. I won’t do that again. Do you—” he seemed to pause, perhaps remembering who he was speaking to. “Er,” he started again, “do you usually leave it at home? How do you get here, if you can’t Apparate?”
Draco slipped into the kitchenette, pouring two glasses of water.  Harry took the second, and sipped it gratefully.
It should’ve been easy, falling into bed and each other’s lives. They could have been the perfect symbol of postwar restoration.
Harry said nothing.
Harry was high on their shared endorphins, awash in Malfoy’s affection. “What happens now?”
He could see the appeal of a life at sea. Here, he could forget about all his land-going worries. All that mattered was the wood beneath his feet and at his back and the noise of water against the hull. There was no Muggle smog clinging to the air, nor the dense flavour of too much magic all in one place.
It didn’t matter, anyway. There wasn’t anything for Harry to fight. There wasn’t anything for Draco to lie about. It was just them, two young men stealing time under a thick duvet. Draco’s toes curled against Harry’s shin. Harry pet his hair, pressing gentle fingers in the soft spot at the base of Draco’s neck.
that meant someone else had landed. Draco took the smallest of steps out of the alley, just enough to see around the bend. It was Harry, slightly battered and windblown, but he was alive. Draco thought he might cry as he rushed to him, running gentle hands over his shoulders, checking for any worse injuries hidden beneath his robes.
“—know what you did,” Harry’s voice echoes from a memory that veers too loud against the side of my head. Distantly, I feel my hands flash in the water, but I’m too lost in his mind to register more than the touch of his hand over mine before I’m tumbling into the memory, into his mind. I’d throw myself to his mercy again and again and again.
“It’s getting worse too, I think,” Harry murmured, and Draco wasn’t sure if that was meant for him or for Harry. “I just felt so lost and so afraid,” he said, and Draco got it. He understood. And he knew that Harry might just be worth trusting.
Break the Fourth Wall, Lunar, Verklempt, Return,
flying before she could even fully take in the extent of the spells he had cast.
The boat creaked. Draco was quiet.
They’d fucked more times than Harry could count. Draco had seen more of Harry,
“I’ve finished the lead,” Draco murmured, levitating a scalding pot.
men, do you think?”
fell from his lips with an all-too-familiar snarl, and the man crumpled to the ground. Draco had faltered, then, unsure if he was more appalled at his magic or at himself. It had felt so natural, sliding from his lips like that. As if that awful word belonged there.
A curse flashed his way. He ducked and it rebounded off the inside of his Protego bubble, dissolving to the right of her shoulder in a flurry of blue sparks. Draco sent two hexes flying in rapid succession, fingers snapping sharply, the wordless, wandless magic flying from him.
"But," Draco said, dumbfounded. "Purebloods don't do uni," he stuttered awkwardly.
“I don’t—” Draco started, and Harry immediately stepped back. “I’m sorry,” he said quickly, unsure of how to put the right words together. There were a thousand reasons to say no. He was not wearing his own face, and surely if Harry knew, he would not be looking at Draco like he was something worth desiring. Harry was an Auror, good-hearted or not, he was an
had taken his voice too. “I’m sorry—”
She crumbles like the desk.
When he sat back against the mast, a little dreamy, shivering at the biting cold. He turned his eyes to the stars and the distant, blurry horizon. If he brought two fingers to the cool memory of Draco's lips on his cheek, no one could catch him.
“Were you?” Harry said, and oh, he was in that sort of a mood. Draco took another drag from his cigarette, eyeing the entry to the little alley. The man from before had walked past for a third time and Draco was growing anxious.
“But—” Harry said. He looked at his hands, refracted in the shifting water. “You were in the water.”
"Good to know I'm on your mind," Harry teased, leaning over the dryer door and into Draco's space. "I'll bring dinner too, if you like."
"Fuck," Draco sighed, heavy-hearted, as he always was at their parting. "There's someone at the Floo." He looked behind him, the linked dream rippling around them, and reached for Harry. They touched fingers in one a final brush and the dream ended.
“Like this,” Draco breathed, palm over Harry’s hand, guiding the thread through the paper. “Gently, or you’ll tear it.” Harry did so, tugging the thread into a neat knot. Harry spread his hand over the page, inked with the names and history of his family. “Once bound, it’ll write itself.”
They moved more smoothly, more slowly through the crowd now, the new person close at Draco’s heels. Whoever she was, and whether she could be trusted or not was yet to be seen. But
The storm brewed bitter, bursting like lightning across their shared single bed in the little loft in Chelsea. Wet with withheld tears, Draco blocked the doorway, defiant, chin raised, a torrential fierceness in his eyes. Harry hesitated. They stood, soaked by the rain between them, stubborn anger still too strong.
Harry stood, shucking off the wet rope. It fell back into the water with a horrible splash.
Broke all my rules and wrote two longer than 50 words - one unapologetically long, and one a drabble. All these have been posted on Tumblr before.
“Let me tell you what you look like.”
“It’s nice to see you,” Harry finally said, and his voice felt tight, like it’d gone dull with disuse, except Harry talked plenty, just not to Draco.
“Shit.” Draco jumped away from him at the sudden shock of cold.
The snap of Draco’s fingers broke Harry’s attention. He looked down at the cup in his hands for an excuse.
“You won’t remember it tomorrow,” Harry said through another devastating kiss, “you’ll forget it all when the curse restarts.”
Harry broke the surface to get a gulp of air, then dove back under to swim to Draco.
to her. And away, to the broken lightbulb flickering above him. And
Harry dropped his hand away and held them behind his back, afraid if he didn’t, he’d try to touch Malfoy again. He had no right to touch this Draco — this Malfoy.
“I’ve found the ghost,” Harry said, and, shuddering, collapsed against the washbasin stand.
There, amid the waves, was Draco.
.  Harry could do that.  He started there, lost in the sensation of Draco’s mouth, the spread of his lips, wet and open still.  Did he taste like lemon, salt, or tequila?
“I didn’t think you minded,” Draco murmured. He finally sipped his tea, avoiding Harry’s eyes. “You said that my hawk is beautiful.”
around himself and the woman with the short hair— the Auror —where she stood near the counter. The ward was thick and immediately muffled the sound of the jazz playing, the odd man in the corner’s typing, the sound of the espresso machine whirring. The whole world seemed to narrow to their tiny bubble as she turned, wand sliding into her hand.
He can look out the big window and stare at the bitter stars and count the seven sisters, and pretend that Draco’s next to him, counting with him. He can pretend that if he says their names out loud just right —
"I know it is."
The hatch doors closed behind them with a heavy
“Don’t you want to remember?” Harry asked, and regretted the question.
Spruce tips, honey, and water simmered over the stove. Harry ached on the couch, shivered under the worn afghan, flushed with fever. Draco poured out a fragrant mug and brought it to Harry, healing steam curling under his nose.
. His lips formed the word, though he didn’t give it voice.
,” Harry cast.
Harry paused in his slicing to give Draco a skeptical look.  “You were lucky I had that knife in my sleeve, Malfoy.”
There was a close call: the Auror closest to him stepped up and Draco caught his eyes. If the Auror had been a proper Legilimens, everything would have been lost. Draco would have been lost, the power of the mind link connecting and sending the Auror deep into his secrets as the curses flew around them. He was lucky. They had to count their luck because it was so rare.
He settled down beside Harry, back against the mast, but that didn’t make him feel any less big. All of Harry’s attention was on the curve of his arm where it pressed against Harry’s, on his thigh so close he thought he could feel Draco’s heartbeat through their trousers.
“James,” Harry said, reaching for his son’s hand. James pulled away. “
Draco was already turning away to begin the other charms. Harry walked around the perimeter of the boat. All the windows were shut. The hatch was closed and latched.
“I’m saying it because it’s true.” Harry looked over his shoulder, nodding at the great wide history painting of Arthur and Merlin at his side, the original Muggle and Magical bonded pair. “Why not bring together all of wizarding history in one place? I never had that history. I mean, I never could have come to a place like this even if it existed, but...”
He dove into the crowd, into a spectacularly tight throng of people, and stuck his elbows out, mumbling a poorly accented
It was easy, after that, to let the months fade away. Draco’s hand was so steady, so real under Harry’s. The garden was so simple, a familiar routine. They sat on the bench and Harry kicked off his shoes and tucked his bare, dirt-covered toes under Draco’s neat trousers against the cold iron. The stars were bright, and there was not a single cloud in the sky.
Harry tapped the table with two fingers. “Wrong place, then. Since they’re—” He swallowed the word. Was it bad luck to talk about drowning on a ship?

“Not like this,” Harry said, and Draco knew what it cost him. He stepped back from the door, expecting it to burst any minute, and it did. Harry pushed past him, unsurprised to find him close, and stepped into the little kitchenette with its rickety wooden table and mismatched plates and the little centerpiece that could only be Hermione Granger’s skill at work.
“He did,” Charlie nodded, unfolding the page and passing it to Draco, who looked at it. It was blank but torn at one corner and looked as though it had been thoroughly erased. “He’s alright. Had a bit of a bad run at the Polyjuice supplier but he’s just fine.”
,” he said under his breath. The shield rippled along his body, a familiar spell, like a second skin. “I haven’t spoken to any librarian.”
Draco brushed a hand over the molding on the door, wishing he could push through and reach out to Harry. “No— yeah, I know that,” Harry got in, before Weasley cut him off.
“I don’t remember you.” Draco said it simply, but Harry felt it like a Crucio. “I don’t remember this,” he glared at the photograph of them laughing together, at their decorations stolen from the Manor, at the solitary bed.
“Back again, Harry?” Malfoy asked, a hollow tease in his tone. He was just as moved by it.
“Malfoys never snore,” Draco snapped.  “You must have misheard.  Or you’re projecting.”
Darkness was bliss; Harry slipped out of his own mind. He was the point of Draco’s fingertips against his cheekbone, his chin, his jaw; he was the brush of magic against the fragile softness by his ear, he was the pull of muscle in his neck when Draco pushed his chin this way and that. Loose, he was easy, he was anything Draco wanted him to be.
“Careful,” said Draco, as he pressed two fingers to Harry’s lips, gentling away his too-hard teeth.
“What’s that now?  Five?  Six?”
Desire potent, Harry did the same. He reached for Malfoy’s hand. Like his reflection, he kissed each fingertip in turn and then met Malfoy’s eyes.
Draco hesitated, his hand hovering. His breath danced across Harry’s cheek: a dare. Harry took Draco’s wrist. Brought his open palm close again, against his jaw.
The sky was perfectly empty, not a single cloud in sight. The water was bright blue, fresh and clean and clear, like he could see down into depths with nothing hidden.
He’s gold in my hands, too precious. I’m certain if I hold him too close, the furnace in my chest will scald him and he’ll melt away, remold into something unknown. When he sleeps in my bed, golden sun across his skin, I swear I’m lying beside magic made man.
“I suppose that’s it,” said Draco. “Making history isn’t the problem.”
It was unfair that Draco was still so stupidly attractive when rolling his eyes.
“No, that’s not it,” Harry denied, scrubbing a hand over his face. “I left the Aurors.”
“Fine.”
Draco’s touch was certain. Desperate, like he was pulling Harry into him.
He’s going to pour them out onto the fresh dirt where they put Draco, and he’s going to watch the silver sink into the soil and he’s going to forget every second they had together. He’ll forget the laughs, and the touches, and the feeling of Draco’s hands on his hips, in his hair. He’s going to forget the taste of Draco on his tongue, sweat-slick and sticky after too long in bed. Every argument, every anniversary, every birthday spent by the water, by the fire, it’ll all go into the dirt, laid to rest with him.
“Have fun, Potter,” Malfoy called after them as Harry opened his bedroom door escorting himself and Ginny inside.
Draco let out another helpless sound as Harry’s hand found the rhythm, releasing his iron grip on Draco’s waist to fist his cock. Draco’s head rolled back onto Harry’s shoulder, letting out shrill squeaks and ‘please’ over and over again.
It was at that approximate moment, that Harry’s brain went haywire. Spitting out his pumpkin juice onto his omelet.
Harry, throwing on his clothes as he walked, followed him through, cautiously.
Ron sighed and came to sit beside him.
“They’re on the couch in the common room, I just walked in and saw them. I swear to Merlin, Harry, please obliviate me!”
“I want— I need you, Draco,” he whispered into warm skin. “Please?”
“What an arse!” Added Ron with a frown.
“You don’t have to be jealous, Potty,” smirked Draco swiping his hair out of his eyes.
Dean bought Malfoy another glass of elf-wine, and not so subtlety wrapped his arm around Malfoy’s shoulder. And to top things all off. Malfoy didn’t even move away, if anything, he leaned further into the touch. Looking up at Dean through those pale lashes, allowing himself to be held.
He didn’t know what was worse, the fact that Malfoy was now sleeping with someone other than Harry, or that judging by the sounds coming from the room, Malfoy was enjoying it.

“Is that good or bad?”
Harry scowled, and collected his stuff from the bathroom floor, before taking Ginny’s hand and ushering them both past Malfoy.
(See the end of the chapter for
Whoop he’s another early update bc I have an assessment I haven’t done that was due yesterday and I’m still procrastinating
Unfortunately, nobody could get a solid answer out of Dean, no matter how hard they prodded. Harry wasn’t even going to bother trying. No. He needed to get information out from the source.
“Exactly,” Ginny said, practically vibrating with glee.
“What did you tell him!” Snapped Harry, trying to keep his voice down despite the fury that was bubbling.
Anyway hope you guys liked this chapter!
“Harry!” Draco keened. “Oh Merlin, that's— ah!”
“Then you shouldn’t have tempted me, Malfoy, you act like that, you get punished.”
Harry gritted his teeth but said nothing as Draco and Dean stumbled past them. He didn’t miss Draco’s eyes on him, a soft smirk as their gazes met.
Something caught in Harry’s throat, forcing him to speak, “But isn’t it… Like also Malfoy’s fault too… I mean he knew Whitby is dating Astoria and he still went after him. Like we don’t actually know Whitby’s side of the story.”
“What—“
“Same difference.”
Harry blanched and Ron groaned.
It was early December, by the time his brain lost it. He and Ginny had gotten drunk together for one of their anniversaries. Harry wasn’t sure which one. First kiss? Making it official? He didn’t think so, this time last year he’d been running for his life. They’d tumbled upstairs, giggling softly to one another as he pressed sloppy kisses to the side of her freckled face.
Harry nodded. “I really didn’t know… It’s just… You said you liked it—“
“Will it?”
Harry’s head shot up and he spluttered out his drink, “Wh—what? No! What makes you think it’s about Ginny. It’s not! Everythings fine with Ginny.”
“And I said yes.”
“Yeah?”
“Of course you want to know about Malfoy,” Ginny said with a snort.
“Night, Potter,” he called, following Dean down the hallway.
So fuck, here ya'll go, I know you've been waiting for these just desserts... ;)
Hermione with her longing helpless gazes and Ginny with calming words and fingers curled into the nape of his neck.
“And who said I’m just after a fuck anyway? Did I mention he’s fit as hell? Why would I only throw that chance away for one time with him? I mean come on,” he gestured over to the furthest table where Malfoy was seated. Harry couldn’t help but look. There was Malfoy, sitting comfortably beside Goyle and Parkinson. He was laughing. A real-life, the kind that made his perfect teeth show and his Adam’s apple bob. His hair wasn’t gelled today, actually, he hadn’t been putting anything in it recently as it'd grown out, near white tendrils falling over his face, masking his perfect widow's peak. It reached his chin now, not long enough to tie up completely but sometimes he’d have the front tied to keep it out of his face. It was also easy for Harry to pull like that, eliciting a high-pitched wine whenever Harry tugged. The hickey Harry’d left below his jaw was still visible, a deep purple now from where Harry had sucked on it. His lips were still slightly pink, and Harry knew if he were closer he’d be able to see how raw and bitten they were. Harry itched to run his thumb along the bottom lip, imagined it stained glossy with his cum, dribbling down Malfoy’s chin, and then, he thought, he'd catch the line of white with his finger and force it back into Draco’s mouth, watching him lick and suck it clean.
If you want faster updates, evidently, comments tend to help x  aha
“Shit,” Draco murmured, both their hard-ons were officially gone. “She’s going to be waiting outside to see you when you leave.”
“You have a room, you know?” Drawled a voice, stepping around them to move to his own door. Harry looked up and gulped. There was something about that night that changed Draco, his hair was just a little lighter, poised so elegantly against his door frame, mocking them with the slight aristocratic tilt of his jaw.
“I know,” he said quietly, before turning away. Trying to focus on literally anything else. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see a blonde head rising to stand. And Harry’s body wasn’t his own anymore. He stood turning to the others, “I’ve got to go, I’ll see you in class.” And before he could let them reply or ask where he was going, he was off. Pushing past a herd of fourth years, to dash down the hallway, following that head of blonde up the winding stairs as the groups began to dissipate. When Draco reached the tapestry that hid the small alcove, Harry was behind him reaching out and shoving Malfoy inside, holding him steady as Malfoy writhed and swore.
“Brother mode off. Best friend mode on.”
“Wrong, he just didn’t let you starve to death while you were a prisoner in his home.”
Draco rolled his eyes, clearly bored, “That, amongst other things.”
Dean nor Malfoy noticed them sitting in the booth behind them, Luna tipping two spoonfuls of sugar into her butter beer, smiling softly to herself.
Ron went pink. “Like… During sex…”
“It doesn’t count if nobody knows about it.”
“Who would hurt a house-elf?”
“Oh.”
“Baby,” he whispered gently, it was, for all intents and purposes, manipulation. He knew Draco became putty with pet names. And he did melting in Harry’s hold.
Thanks for coming to my ted talk.
“Hey!” He said, nudging her.
As usual ur comments and Kudos mean so much to me and keeps me going with these fics x
Harry gulped, crossing his legs as to ignore his semi, and turned to her. “Sorry, just phased out for a bit.”
Ron winced at the same time Hermione said, “No he’s not, he’s with Astoria.”
“Yeah actually maybe Harry’s got a point,” contemplated Ron, “I wouldn’t put it past Malfoy to just shag someone in order to create general chaos.”
Damn Draco U rly out doing urself with the crazy tonight... Also i love the idea of Stoner Neville, and i also remembered Neville is meant to be blonde!!!
Harry gulped and gestured to the shimmering fabric on his desk. Draco scoffed and threw it over himself.
FYI had such a moral dilemma writing this, because a two and a half month of featus actually looks like a malformed alien lizard and not like a cute baby that Harry would be moved by. But we’re just going to pretend that Harry’s glasses were a little foggy and he didn’t notice the weird mega mind ass brain.
“Wonderful,” whispered Draco, still hungover with lust from the night before.
ooohhh shiteeee...
You know when you’re driving, specifically a Ford Anglia, and you daze off a bit on the motorway, snapping back just in time before you realise you were about to collide with a giant cement truck.
Breakfast the next morning was quiet with the eighth year Gryffindors, Ron and Hermione had gotten into a fight the night prior, Harry couldn’t keep up with what, and honestly, he was too afraid to ask.
He bent into the kiss, wrapping his arms around her waist. That of course was when the door flung open once more, to reveal Draco Malfoy, half-naked, spare for a pair of green briefs, covered in hickey’s, his hair a mess from a mix of sex and sleep.
Draco kissed him, gently. Just lips pressed against one another. It was simple, yet somehow the feeling that wound around him was so strange. Draco pulled away with a soft chuckle, pulling his trousers back up his waist, Harry following suit.
“You’ll what?” He said breathing into Malfoy’s ear.
“You have your own room for a reason!” Bellowed Ron, eyes still covered. Malfoy’s shirt was buttoned down almost all the way, a bright purple hickey blooming on his collar, one that Harry was certain he hadn’t left.
“Potter,” Malfoy whispered, his tone still biting, but his body gave him away, relaxing in Harry’s touch.
“Guess what Harry and I found out,” She said in a stage whisper.
Harry snorted, “I know, Malfoy.”
“Alright, Harry,” she said again, eyes focused on the laughing couple next to them.
“What!” He sputtered.
Harry gulped. “Does that mean you think I’m a bad person? Because of Ginny?”
He couldn't pull out, he didn’t want to move. He wanted to stay like that forever.
“It’s the moon cycle,” Draco yawned, nudging closer to Harry.
Ron seemed to think about this for a moment before answering, “I mean, I’m not blind. Yeah I see a girl and think she’s fit, and shit maybe I’ll have a wank over it, but it’s not anything more than that. And not when I’m with Hermione, I don’t think…”
That hit Harry right in the heart. “No I wouldn’t,” he lied.
He let go of Draco’s cock to spank his ass, hard. Draco buckled forward, elbow giving in and falling against the wall with a soft cry. That made Harry grin, stepping forward kicking Draco’s legs apart as far as they could with his trousers and pants around his ankles. Spitting into one hand, the other undoing his own trousers, letting them fall as he palmed himself, smiling and the magnificent picture Draco made. He was cruel about it, smacking Draco’s hole a few times with his cock, hearing a choked cry escape him.
(See the end of the chapter for
The door opened and Ginny slipped inside, she was in Ron’s old Cannon shirt and the pair of Harry’s boxers with a rip in the side. She smiled softly and looked him up and down. “Hermione told me the password,” she explained, though she didn’t need to, someone always told Ginny the password to the eighth-year dorms.
Thanks so much for the support, I know this is sort but i needed it
Cornering Draco after Potions was easy, there were no portraits in the room and no classes for the rest of the day, all he had to do was tug on Draco’s sleeve when everyone was leaving and nudge him away from the door, pinning him against one of the counters as soon as the door slammed shut. Pressing wet kisses along Draco’s neck.
Also I got a few comments about the chapter count and how many chapters will be left. The number in the description is justbased on how many chapters I’ve already plotted out, we’re probably going to have quite a few more chapters to go till the end, so stay tuned! This was only meant to be two chapters when I started writing, but I got so many comments that have me so much inspiration to add new elements! So, who knows!
“So wait,” Sneered Harry, still high on anger, “You told him that if he lied about sucking your dick, you’d actually let him.”
“Well I don’t blame Whitby,” Dean said with a smirk.
“Nice hickeys, Malfoy. You finally give Dean a shot then?”
Harry pressed a kiss to Draco’s chest, rolling him so Draco’s back was flat on the bed now. He moved carefully down Draco’s body, hands tracing over the lean muscle on his torso, as his head dipped under the covers, lips tracing Draco’s hipbones, hand coming down to stroke Draco’s twitching cock.
“Why the fuck would he agree to that!”
It was harder than Harry’d thought, to stay away from Draco. Which was strange, as really he and Draco were sun and moon in terms of schedule. Draco hardly ever went to breakfast, and when he did, it was quick and subtle, so that even Dean couldn’t notice him. And other than potions, they had no classes together. If he wasn’t so keenly aware of it, Draco could fly past him without a second glance. Except for one small problem, the bathroom. That divider that worked as a secret passageway between them. Harry could hear him and Dean through that thin wooden door, the worst kind of echo. When they brushed their teeth, Draco would flirt, Harry would stare and scratch the back of his neck. He wouldn’t touch him. Not anymore. But he couldn’t help but steal quick glances at that pale lithe frame of his.
“Well whomever it is, it’s definitely not Whitby.” Added Draco, still smirking at Harry.
“I’ve missed you, too,” replied Draco.
Harry didn’t get to hear about what it was or wasn’t, because his free hand went and wrapped around Draco’s throat. He felt more tears slick his hand, and god it was amazing. Incredible really. Knowing he had so much control over the one person he’d always despised. It was like he was drunk on it.
They were on the couch, or at least Dean was, Malfoy was seated fully on Dean’s lap, as Dean pulled him into another drunken kiss, hand roaming down to Malfoy’s arse.
He rose when he heard it. Three voices in the hallway. He couldn’t tell what they were saying or even who they were, but his head was fuzzy and he followed Draco’s instructions on instinct.
“I just mean… It wasn’t a big deal before… Before it was just like, wow you’re hot. But now they’re dating someone, I just… I really don’t get it…”
“Babe,” Harry said, slowly, regaining his confidence. “I wouldn’t actually do that to you…”
As usual, I love to hear your thoughts so leave a comment!
The only silver lining was that, because Malfoy was so fantastic and tight and perfect, Dean finished after only a few minutes. Leaving Harry in horrified silence.
Ginny was all gold. Golden eyes and copper hair. A warmth to her skin from time spent outside with her brothers. She shimmered like all hell. Rich and solid, with giggles like summer. Sturdy and un-blemishable.
“Yes,” he said quietly so that Harry could hardly hear him, “A little too good.”
It was Malfoy’s fault, he kept trying to tell himself. He and Dean’s relationship had brought a palpable distance between them that made Harry’s stomach hurt. It wasn’t like he missed Malfoy, they still had their mid-night trysts together every so often, but he could tell by Malfoy’s ambivalent guilty face that something had changed. And that scared Harry, and he wasn’t sure why. And whenever he saw Dean and Malfoy together, he felt almost sick at the pure wrongness of it. It made him mad in a way he hadn’t been in a long time.
Draco froze, noticing the tenderness in Harry’s voice, and gulped.
“Thank you!” Harry cheered, proud finally someone understood his point.
He hadn’t seen Malfoy much that week, determinately avoiding him whenever possible, to prevent punching Dean in his ugly fucking mug, which would probably raise some questions. He’d given one hand job in a broom cupboard and that was all. Part of Harry told him that was good. That he could go back to being Ginny’s. The other part of Harry, the louder more violent part of him, wanted to bend Draco over right in front of Dean and show him who Draco really belonged to.
Ginny sat beside him, her head rested against his shoulder, reaching over to take a bite from his plate, snatching a piece of bacon.
“What if I… Tap your side,” he pressed his palm to Harry’s right flank twice, “Like
“Please,” Draco whined, “Please don’t make me say it.” His ass pushing back against Harry, his body answering the question for him.
“Draco?” He asked gently turning him around so they faced one another. “I’m not evil, you’re allowed to tell me if you don’t like something?” He leaned down so his forehead was pressed to Draco’s.
Harry had left Draco’s room after dozing off for a few hours, he’d crawled out of the bed at just past one, slipping into his clothes, listening to the soft hum of Malfoy’s snores. It was easy for them to do this, Harry’s dorm was just next to Draco’s, only divided by the bathroom, working like a secret chamber between the two rooms. No one would ever see a thing, and even if they did, what would they think? Certainly not that the two had been having fantastic mind-blowing sex. He showered first, cleaning off the sweat coating his skin, feeling rather sated in the way he only ever felt after a night with Malfoy. He was grinning to himself until he heard the knock on the door.
“Harry wait!” Draco said a little louder. Harry smiled, part of him always loved this game of cat and mouse. He could feel Draco writhing against him trying to push back,
“You have?” Asked Harry quietly, freehand coming down to spread Draco’s legs, to pull closer onto his lap, caressing his thigh as he did, other hand coming to rub gently against Draco’s hole.
“You need to stop being so hard on yourself, Ginny won’t care if you say you were attracted to a bunch of random bints or some girl you saw on the muggle telly.”
It turned out that bringing someone back from the dead was child's play, compared to setting up a company, even with the help of Gringotts. Legal models had to be chosen, general terms and conditions agreed upon. And all had to be wrapped up in a nice little package, with a headquarter on top. Neither Harry nor Severus wanted Grimmauld Place on file, too content with the privacy a fading Fidelius Charm still offered. The idea of Spinners End made the Potion Master shudder. He wanted to go forward not back, and he had honestly despised the house for the majority of his life.
Now, that's a lot of personal information, you most likely didn't want to know, but I felt like sharing.
"That is a fox, Minister," the raven-haired ribbed good-naturedly, chuckling when Inari managed to climb up the tall man's other arm and started nibbling on his fingers.
No, Harry decided, he could not betray Snape like that. The pensieve incident was enough. "Kreacher?"
"Kreacher does not like to trick his master. No, he doesn't. No, he doesn't." The elf shook his head stubbornly. "Coffee is serious business, Master Harry says. Not to be messed with."
"You're the worst liar in the world. I bet she was on to you in seconds!"
‘Thank god for a competent partner,’ Harry thought as he watched the ringleader hit the floor, his wand snatched out of the air by his colleague and friend. He had gone through half a dozen partners after joining the Aurors. All competent people, no doubt, relishing in the honour of working side-by-side with the 'Boy Who Lived'. He could do no wrong in their eyes. But, either he worked his ass off, or they did, despite him earning all the glory. None of them had been feast able overall. Oh, they had had his back, the Ministry did not employ fools, but none of them had called him out on it when he had done something stupid. Not like,
"I do not need a babysitter!" He folded his arms again.
"It would be the pot calling the kettle black. I don't think that you have a leg to stand on. After all, you are the Gryffindor who invited a bunch of Slytherins to live with you. If that's not crazy, I don't know what is."
Harry nearly tripped over the kitchen bench, in his haste to reach his godson, pulling him into his arms almost desperately. He remembered how it had felt not to be wanted, and he never ever wanted that for his cub. "Teddy, no! My god, what makes you say … what makes you even think that? I love you. So much! I thought you knew that."
Fighting down his messy hair, Harry was at loss of what Draco was referring to. "What?"
When she let go, Luna nodded, "Thank you for the robes. They will make all the difference."
--O-O--
"Are we discussing my lack of trust issues again?" When the blond put down the volume, Harry wanted to know. "Aren't you interested in this book?"
"You look positively radiant."
Doubting that he wanted to hear the answer but asking anyway, Severus demanded to know, "What happened?"
Too exhausted to analyse the situation any longer, the blond curled around Teddy from the right and rested his head on Harry's warm limb. This was warm and comfortable and safe. Within moments Draco was fast asleep.
Harry returned more than an hour later, shamefaced and slightly hoarse. Teddy was sitting on the floor of his office, polishing all the pendants he had ever gifted to his godfather, while Draco was content reading a book in front of the fireplace. The desk was undisturbed.
--O-O--
"But," Draco contradicted somewhat helplessly, "he is at work."
"What must be?"
"I do!" Harry hastened to assure. "I trust you, it's just …"
"Oh, shut up, you love it!" The Gryffindor grinned boldly.
"It's okay to be scared," Despite having spoken rather quietly, Narcissa's voice carried over the bustling of the house-elves whom Severus had instructed with preparing tea and some snacks for the Aurors. They would work through the night, no doubt, and would hardly be efficient on an empty stomach. When he did not reply, the Lady stepped closer and slipped into his arms. They closed around her, so she could feel the trembling that Severus tried so valiantly to suppress.
With a crooked smile, his partner nudged him towards the door. “Why don’t you leave early for once? I’ll wait for the confirmation of the reports, file them and lock up.”
Since Lucius Malfoy was no actual barrister, thus not bound by their confidentiality agreement, he understood the necessity of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement to duplicate his notes, no matter how little he liked it. His liege would want him to comply, he was sure of that. What puzzled him, however, was, "Why Grimmauld Place?"
With a tilt of his head, he assured her, "With everything I hold dear."
"Honestly, if you are the future of our Auror department, I despair for our forces," Snape sighed.
After choosing pictures for all rooms - Kreacher had unearthed real treasures, brighter and friendlier than Harry could have ever hoped for in a Black house - the young man decided to finally call it a day. He was surprised to hear someone knocking on his bedroom, but nobody entered. Usually, Draco was bolder than that. To his surprise, he found Severus right outside the door.
Pondering that for a few moments, admitting that his former pupil's concern was valid, Snape suggested, "Then you should change the public's opin… view of Narcissa."
"What did you just say?"
Anchanee
"I know exactly what you mean," his friend chuckled.
"Leewood!"
When nothing happened beyond that, his godfather inquired, "What are you thinking about?" As always, Severus was the tiniest bit pleased when getting out the words flawlessly once again. His godson mirrored that smile, "You are really getting better. I am glad that my potion is working."
"So where does that leave us?" Harry wondered. A suspect under Fidelius was as good as useless.
Immediately the young wizard called upon his house-elf. "Kreacher, please change the sheets without waking Teddy." Then he left to fetch the witch's emergency-overnight-bag, she - like many others - had stored at Grimmauld Place.
"Going back to the Manor," Draco mumbled into his tumbler.
Yet Lady Blackwood had never made an appearance.
Yet before Emerald could confirm the order, Severus contradicted, "No, you will feed her, and then return her to Draco together with her brush, please."
"He had a nightmare, as had I. It was a coincidence that I heard him."
"Grimmauld Place."
The pure-blood Lady frowned when entering the British Library. "There is no magic section, as per your own research." She had been briefed with the bare necessities, being here made no sense. Why would 'missing' librarians hole up in a place like this?
"Yes … No …," the raven-haired sighed. "I want to prove a point. I don't have to be cruel about it."
At Neville's confused noise, the raven-haired shook his head, "Sorry, Neville, but that's private." Then he studied Severus, who was still staring at the portrait in shock. Smiling at his parents, he touched their frame, "Mum, Dad, welcome home."
"Not really."
Plonk.
A soft light illuminated the room, reflecting in the tears that streamed down Draco's cheeks.
He followed Harry at a sedated pace, while the exhausted Auror cooed over their elven-infant. Emerald was growing quickly, reaching Kreacher's waist already. But she would need a few more months with Harry before her magic could sustain itself.
"Alright, let's see how you are doing." Fingers entwined with his own, warm, gentle fingers, and for a moment, Snape was overcome with emotions, because he could not even remember the last time someone had touched him just for the sake of it. There had been Potter, of course, but his touch had been painful, only there to save his life. Well, he should not be ungrateful. It had worked, obviously.
"What do you know about the Deathly Hallows?"
Cautiously, Draco opened the door and climbed the creaking stairs. Though everything was dust-free, he felt like it had been decades, since the last human soul had entered these rooms. Once he had reached the top, Draco caught in his tracks. Oh, this was a lab, but Merlin!
With but a small smile, the Lord tilted his head. "As you wish, my Lord."
Unused to this ire, he stammered, taken aback, "Narcissa! This is…"
"But that is not the main reason."
--O-O--
Harry nodded. "Ron?"
"Understood, Sir!"
"Honestly," the redhead shook her head exasperated. "The audacity of this man, when our Harry lies here, unconscious."
“Thank you,” benevolently, he offered a small bow and turned towards the door. Incidentally, he mentioned before leaving, “By the way, you should add my house to the Malfoys’ permitted residencies. I can’t imagine being eager to travel to the Manor
"Not really," Charles admitted. "From what I've gathered so far, the dungeon-room was under some heavy-duty Fidelius, as was she. Even if she would have wanted to tell us something, she couldn't have."
Grinning, the young Auror challenged, "Since you are half Black, should I be worried?"
"Somehow, I doubt that," the Lady mumbled, but before her husband could inquire further, Draco picked up the bottle and topped off all of their glasses. "I think it goes lovely with the meat," he said, mirroring Harry's raised glass.
"How … do you … know?" Severus inquired, eyes flying over the notes. He had not realised how much he had missed his potions. Even this was a welcome, and most importantly interesting reprieve from thoughts that constantly circled from Harry to Lucius to ways to speed up his own recovery, before returning to Lily's son.
Looking at his godson, ignoring the glowering Weasley when Draco used the deprecatory nickname for his little sister, the blond squirmed, but revealed after a moment, "I might have added some Purslane to the Lavender and Camomile flowers for his bath."
Wondering if he should try to switch topics, Harry decided to get the current one over with. The Potion Master would not let him get away with anything else, anyway. "We met with Griphook not long after I've left here; went over the most important papers and then started visiting the vaults. I …
"You won't," His wife assured him, kissing him for luck. "You have researched this case meticulously and know that your client is guilty as sin. Nobody will let him walk free. Not with the abundance of evidence you have helped them gather."
Studying the newcomer with his tweed-jacket and elbow patches, Severus met the wizard's doubtful gaze before he reassured the man, "Though my godson's mixture is slightly toxic, I can assure you, that it works exactly as advertised."
"I thought …"
Knowing how research could go and how one could lose himself in it, Severus merely nodded, "Thank you, Emerald. Please make sure that there are more sandwiches for tea."
"I was as weak as a baby!" Severus growled, remembering with dread the first moments after waking.
"Then how …?"
"He is? I got the impression that it was a new cult. Not around during Tom's reign."
"And how can you determine that?" Harry wanted to know.
"What?" He wanted to know what had happened, despite obviously being relegated to one−word questions. It was not surprising, that one of his best friends since first grade understood him anyway. Making herself at home at the foot of his bed, since Molly refused to relinquish his right hand while Draco had claimed the seat on the left, Hermione explained. "When your parselspell − brilliant by the way, but what were you thinking risking parselmagic when buried under a house?! − helped to draw the other Aurors attention, they started the tricky process of digging you out. You and Neville were beyond exhausted when they finally reached you."
"I remember."
"You did it afterwar… later as well."
Harry's noise of protest came out as a weak whimper, that finally drew the attention of the other people in the room. A pale, blond head entered his field of vision and a heartbeat later, he had his arms full of a trembling and sniffing Hermione. "Oh, Harry, thank god you're awake."
"I …," Harry croaked, blinking rapidly to fight back the tears that wanted to well up at the unexpected compliment. The Potion Master picked up his journal, pointedly ignoring the young man. After a few minutes, Harry finished his own drink before stating quietly, "Thank you."
When the young wizard did not continue, appearing confused of how to continue, Severus found himself unable to keep in that sigh. "Did it ever occur to you that I may have haz…arded the consequences of coming to the garden?
"I do," he admitted, "but you see, I am not a guest."
"Alright, Leewood has wrapped up his analysis. We are ready to bring her in."
Sidestepping Inari, who was bounding out of the kitchen as soon as the door opened, Hermione helped herself to some herbal tea while looking longingly at Harry's coffee. "Something just exploded on the third floor," she commented dryly.
"An antidote," Harry nodded slowly. "And yes, that's exactly what I want him to do."
"Exactly, and if you can … harmonise the intent of many people, you can achieve truly extraordinary things."
"Thank you."
"You always used Fred's," George remembered, smiling despite the tears that were slowly rolling down his cheeks.
“Harry,” trying to break the tension, Narcissa requested, “Could you give me your sewing kit before you leave, please?”
Looking down at his place, the blond mumbled, "Mother and I mostly eat in the kitchen these days. It's the only room that's warm."
The corner of Westwood Gardens and Westwood Roads was as unremarkable as the name suggested, with one exception: as soon as the Aurors and their companions had set foot on the corner estate, a concealment charm lost its effect, revealing a sizable mansion. Since, strictly speaking, Narcissa was still under house arrest, and Severus was officially deceased, the four Aurors - and Ron - approached the house alone. Once they had knocked, a tiny elf with strange eyes opened the door. "What can Ruby be doing for the Aurors?"
"Well, future brother-in-law," Charlie grinned, "Every member of our family should possess at least one dragon-leather outfit. Believe me, the ladies will swoon at the mere sight of you."
Serenely, Luna strolled over to where Narcissa was surrounded by three mares. "Can't you decide which one to take?"
"Our gamekeeper? Why?"
Struggling subconsciously against the bindings, the white-haired man edged forward and gazed up at Harry beseechingly. Frantically, he replied, “Yes! I will swear a wizard’s oath, a blood oath, anything you want!”
"Lunch?" Severus asked exasperated.
Relaxing slightly, since there seemed to be no immediate danger, the little guy nudged Teddy's hand so the boy would continue his petting. At least until the child nodded to himself and turned around, screaming out loud, "Vicki, look what Harry found!"
Slowly, unsure if she should or not, the Lady Malfoy turned. There, in black robes with neatly pulled back hair stood Severus Snape. The first non-family-member who had been allowed to hold her son. The man who had stood at Lucius' side through even the worst of the Dark Lord's temper tantrums. The man who had sworn an unbreakable vow to protect her boy and had actually delivered, ensuring that Draco made it out of the war more or less intact. A man who she had buried and mourned nearly five years ago. "Severus," she breathed, flinching when Irma Pince was suddenly by her side, claiming the teacups.
Aware of the audience a scene like theirs had inevitably attracted, Harry kept his arm around Draco and instructed audibly, "Pet, you're with me."
"I hope you will forgive us, but we decided on identical gifts for the both of you," Molly explained, somewhat embarrassed as if this was some personal failing when handing over the presents.
Gently, Harry asked, "Why do you say that?"
"Lumos Maxima!" Harry cast. His colleagues followed him, through the door in the kitchen and at his spell the cellar turned bright as day.
Pondering the question, she shook her head. "No, you need to be around them. Otherwise, you can't help."
Harry considered explaining that it was a muggle-magical-device from work, but since that did not matter at the moment he merely nodded.
I'll have to leave you with a nasty cliffhanger with this chapter, but otherwise, it would have gotten too long. I hope you enjoy what is happening in the meantime.
"Of course," the witch snapped, "because Severus would prefer his friends and family thinking him dead!"
"This does not compare to anything I have ever done for you!"
After a moment, there was a knock on the door. Someone actually remembered to await permission to enter.
"You can't get rid of such stains with magic."
"Not all of us get an invitation on a silver platter, after leaving the country for nearly a year."
After a few minutes of casting, Neville turned around and did the same to the tapestry that contained the family tree. He then shook his head in confusion before repeating the spell.
"Oh my god, I'm sorry. I did not know that wands could do that!"
"Pettigrew was a Gryffindor too!"
Defeated, Draco pulled out the mangled parchment and slid it across the table.
"Of course, it did. I passed the test, after all."
--O-O--
"Yes, but that's not real magic. That's just me."
"Apologies. But I thought the two of you drifted apart after your Lily started to hang out with Potter and his crowd."
accept it. That would be bad form."
"I am not splotchy! This is my future wife we are expecting. I think a little apprehension is to be expected."
"Draco, Narcissa, I am sorry, but you will need these bracelets. Lucius will be expected to stay by my side at all times. But you are still under house arrest; strictly speaking. So, the ministry only agreed to let you leave the house if you wear something with a tracking charm."
"Draco," at his mother's unspoken request, the young man reached for her hand. "Do not think that we did not care for Severus. He was a good friend to our family, and despite his precarious position, he always did his best to care for you. Never doubt his love, because everybody could see him falling for you, the moment your father placed you into his arms."
When the other nodded, the Potion Master barely resisted the impulse of massaging the bridge of his nose, to stave off a headache. Potter having an existential crisis, sleeping close to none and then stumbling over the familiar. No wonder he had not been able to curb his temper. "Did you consider that his words were spoken in anger?"
With a huff, the other sank into his chair, offering despondently, "Well, the three of you did not have Severus' journals. Nor did any of you have a Potion Master for a godfather."
"I know what you mean, Hermione," Harry assured her, squeezing her hand for comfort. "But we are Aurors. In most cases we work, peoples' lives are at stake. And that makes every last case damn personal!" Pushing away his tray, Harry stood to leave, but his best friend held him back. He noticed the faraway look in her eyes that usually meant that her brain was in overdrive. Glancing at the watch, he decided that he could give her a few moments. With Hermione, it was usually worth it.
Spelling all the magazines back into the box, in reverse order this time, the young wizard retreated with a quiet, "I'll leave you to it. Have a good evening." While Severus was already leafing through the last copy, he could vaguely remember July 1997.
−−O−O−−
"Our land lives, but has yet to know life at its fullest.
Deflating, the boy nodded. After a minute, where Draco had started to rub his back soothingly, he started to talk, albeit so quietly, that Harry and Draco had to concentrate on understanding him.
A slow smile spread over Harry's face. "Like a summoning spell, that helps you to defeat a dragon." Hugging Hermine for a moment and squeezing his vassal's shoulder, the young Auror dashed towards the door. "Thank you. You two are the best!"
It was not uncommon for Aurors to cover their area of operation with anti-apparation wards, once their targets had gathered. However, to include more than two square miles, a dozen witches and wizards were instructed to take their positions for a joint effort. Since the entire Auror Squad was disillusioned, claiming spots and casting had to be timed perfectly. The sun was just touching the horizon as the wards flared up. Once they had settled, Harry tilted his head questioningly, at a squeeze on his shoulder, the young Auror started casting. It was quite a broad area to cover. Too wide, the parselmage realised, but he knew if he could not get his wards up, his colleagues did not stand a chance, civilians or not. With that many opponents, they would be sitting ducks without protection. So he dug into reserves deep in his core and spanned the last distance to reach Neville. His friend's artefact would make it easier, he just had to connect to it.
Severus hovered at the door of Harry's bedroom, just outside of Teddy Lupin's line of sight, who lay curled up in the bed. Cautiously he inquired, "Harry, what is it?"
Her composure was admirable. Only her eyes gave away that she had been crying. Harry wondered if it had been tears of relief, maybe even joy, but shoved that thought away, as soon as it came up. He had to act like a professional! Personal feelings had no place in this investigation.
"Perfectly alright!" The young wizard assured her. Still, he gazed uncertainly at the staircase. "Have tea with me, please. I'll even make you breakfast."
Upper body still mostly inside her trunk, a muffled rebuff was the only answer. "Astoria, I don't have time now. I'll have to leave in about six minutes."
"Did she survive?"
Pressing her lips together, she nodded.
"How is it cheating if fidelity is not contractually stipulated? Usually, only the bloodline of the child is agreed upon."
Looking at his partner, the brunet shook his head. "I promised you that I would have your back if you met me half-way. I wonder how long you will need before you can believe that."
"Three days ago?"
When a shadow fell over the blond's face, Harry confirmed, "She did and without Hermione's quick thinking and even quicker casting, he would have died in that boat-house."
research, you will step aside and let me see my godfather!"
"He broke the wand." His friend confirmed.
>For Ginny and Justin, from Charlie and family<
Closing the door of his room behind himself, Draco burrowed under the covers, even turning on the wireless. Anything to block out the noises that came from the third floor.
--O-O--
Kreacher was waiting in the corridor, making Harry asked concerned, “Already?”
Following Snape, Harry spotted the hearty meal that had been set out on the back patio that was blanketed with heating charms. When the older wizard instructed, "Eat!" he took a few bites and soon noticed that he was famished, having not had anything but the sandwiches Narcissa had served with tea in the afternoon. Ten minutes later, Harry spooned up the last of the raspberry pudding Ron had prepared, washing the meal down with a butterbeer. He gratefully accepted a glass of amber liquid, before sending the dishes back into the house. Reluctantly, Harry wanted to know, "What time …?" But trailed off when he saw Snape's blazing eyes.
Popping into existence right in front of him, the elf seemed to fight with himself for a moment, wringing his hands nervously in a way that reminded Harry uncomfortably of Dobby, before shuddering and bowing deep. "Master."
"Malfoy Manor it is," the goblin sighed. This stupid wizard would be the death of him! No sense of business at all!
I nearly forgot ... nearly! But I remembered just in time to post a new chapter. There will be brains and brawl, actually the other way around. And then an Auror will do the unexpected. I had a lot of fun writing this chapter, though it's a little on the short side. I hope you will have as much fun reading it :).
“We should review the statements,” Draco said, finally. He stepped back,picked up his empty mug, and stomped down the hatch. “Maybe we’ll see her tonight.”
Draco rolled his eyes and kissed him. He tasted like the joint and the cool night air, so Harry stopped thinking about terrible headlines and savoured every second instead.
Draco and Harry were tucked in the parlor of Grimmauld Place, knees against each other, the flickering fire sending warmth over their skin. Draco was watching Harry, and Harry was watching the fire.
Draco’s only solace was the ever-growing pile of books, nicked from big, corporate bookstores and purchased from little shops whenever he had the galleons to spare.
The blond man put a hand across the table, brushing a single finger over the arch of Draco’s right knuckle, pale fingers stark against the body Draco wore today — against Draco’s warm brown skin. It was the barest touch, as gentle as a breath of air across his skin and he shivered imperceptibly, lifting his pointer finger to caress over the arch of his fingernail. This man worked with his hands, that much was clear from the scarred and calloused roughness to it. It was better not to wonder at such things, better not to ask where this body had been.
Harry Summoned a towel from the bag, ruffling his hair with it before tossing it aside.  Draco rolled his eyes, though he certainly didn’t mind the morning look.
The stars were beautiful anyway, so he didn’t mind. It was easier to avoid that dangerous, consumptive desire in the open air, easier to stare up at galaxies silver across the ink-black darkness as far as he could see in every direction.
But the Draco parts, those will go. He’ll describe every detail of bringing a beer over to Draco, where he sat alone by the fire because the Weasleys hadn’t warmed to him yet. Harry will remember — just for a moment, in the safety of her awful patterned walls — the feeling of Draco’s knuckles against the back of his hand.
In the long second it took for the items to arrive at his side, Draco took in the raw and stunning power of Harry Potter in a fury. He watched Harry cast, sending one Auror bound and away and turning on the other. But it was no use. The fire was already turning green. As beautiful and powerful as he was, it would do no good. They could not stay here.
links us together with a flash like a camera going off. I’m his eyes and itching under his skin, I’m in his mind, and he’s guiding me through too many colors and sounds. I don’t know how he lives like this, in this cacophony; I don’t know how he thinks in this noise. I want to take every burden from him, let him sit in quiet.
“Avery, Ron,” a cheerful voice said, and Draco looked beyond the leader to see Harry, standing in jeans, a heavy black cloak draped over his shoulders. “And is that you, Selwyn?” he asked, raising his voice even louder so the names echoed off the bricks.
“Zinnias,” Draco said quietly, and glanced up at Harry. “Adoration.”
He took the shot.  Bit the lemon.  Leaned back.
“My mother. We—” he started, and hesitated. They didn’t talk about personal things, like mothers and childhood memories. They didn’t make love like that. “Well. It doesn’t matter, I’m sure you don’t care to know.”
“Bring me to the Librarian," Harry said.
“Bum a smoke?” Harry asked, and Draco blinked at him, hardly believing the sight. Harry wore Muggle jeans, ripped at the knees and the thigh, revealing more skin than Draco knew how to manage, so Draco kept his eyes on Harry’s face.
Draco picked up the research papers.
“Naturally.”
— badmouthed the Cannons.”
Draco kissed him back with a desperate sound, sinking his hands into Harry’s hair, falling forward on the bench. The kiss felt like nine months had not passed, like they could turn around and be caught by Theo at any instant. Harry could picture his wry smile as he stood in the doorway, as he hovered over two mugs of tea and left them to it.
I feel his swallow under my fingertips, the flannel a bare barrier between my hand and his throat. I think these are the marks of fingernails, and I want to hurt the person that dared leave them on him, though I know she’s already dead.
Draco pushed him, so he stumbled against the washbasin. The wood against his back, Draco plastered against his front.
Harry had gone a bit red at the ears, the way he did when he was in an uncomfortable situation and Draco had learned to stop trying to get him out of these moments. Harry cleared his throat. “I’m not an Auror.”
“Warm,” Harry croaked, and a shiver of water spilled down his spine.
Star Prophet reporter Draco Malfoy learned the old tricks and submitted his Animagus paperwork. No one noticed the tiny mouse curled in Harry’s pocket at all the Ministry affairs, nor dared to suspect him of leaking secrets. He didn’t need to leak them. Draco published every slimy lie they told.
“It’s alright, love,” Harry said, a touch of disappointment in his eyes. Harry was disappointed that Draco had turned him down. Draco thought he might treasure that moment to the very last of his days. “I hear you.” He stepped back against the wall so that they were standing side-by-side. He didn’t make to leave, though, puffing on the cigarette like it was a lifeline. Maybe it was. Draco regretted stubbing his out after only half because he didn’t have an excuse to stay any longer without something to smoke.
“Malfoy?” called Harry, torn between the hatch and the hob.
The hawk landed on Harry’s shoulder, a weight that was there and not all at once.
You ought to go see what caused that awful crashing noise, but you’ve been in their room three times already and you really don’t want to have to walk out in the middle of your shift.
“Why are we laughing?” Harry asked, wiping tears out of his eyes with sweaty palms.
The Mirror knew Harry and Harry knew the Mirror.
Harry slid his bare feet out from under the blankets, aching for Draco. “I know.”
“That’s me,” he said, brushing hands over his clothes to fit more comfortably. He left the shirt still a little too tight in Draco’s opinion, and he stretched across his chest as Charlie reached into his pocket for a small piece of parchment.
"You really think this will work?" Draco asked.
“I was about to visit Draco to give him his next dosage of potions. It would seem your ex-lover has some interesting spells up his sleeve that did a number on my godson.”
“I’ll manage. Oh one last thing, have you found your mate yet Harry?”
Draco woke again for the second time, this time, he was too groggy to react to the panic building in his chest. Opening his eyes he saw Severus, sitting on a chair next to the cot he lay on. This time he could feel a heavy blanket over his body, and some how he could smell the sticking charm that kept him from moving. He growled, eyes narrowing as his hairy toes clenched against the bottom of the cot. Severus looked up from his book and half smiled before setting it down. "You gave us quite the scare there for a moment. Thought you would bleed out," Severus stated. Draco huffed, curling his lip and snarling.
Remus put the book aside and placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder as he stood up from the seat he'd taken. “I don’t know what to think, but I’m sure we’ll find out more at the will reading,” he stated in an uneasy tone.
The man at the desk smiled as Regulus paid, “Seems you have a strong connection with your familiar. It usually takes longer than that for their names to show up on the collar. You two are pretty lucky,” the man said.
I am the voice of the future
"Yes headmaster?" Harry stammered, his eyes looking between the headmaster and the striped creature next to Snape.
“Skoll Greyback, and my deceased twin Hati Greyback.”
Draco laughed, "Only to fill the role of an heir to the Malfoy line. Do you know how much flack they would have gotten if they hadn't?"
"Harry!" Ron shouted, his eyes wide. "Did he get you?"
Harry nodded and watched as Sirius lifted Narcissa’s letter and opened it.
“You said it yourself, Lord Malfoy. There will always be one that reaches for power in the magical world. I simply took up the mantle before anyone else,” LeFay smirked and Tatsuya was pleased with the answer his vessel gave.
