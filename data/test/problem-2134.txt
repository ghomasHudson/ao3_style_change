Harry felt a knot of anticipation start to build.  This was it, the first time he would see Malfoy or the other Slytherins since the final battle, the first time he would hear their music.  He found himself hopeful for what was to come, hoping the crowd would like them … no, more than that … hoping the crowd would love them.
The invasion into her innermost thoughts felt like knives tearing away at her, filleting her skin from her muscle and bone, leaving her open and exposed to the ravagings of the demon who held her captive.
The fundamental techniques of how to hold and sit on a broom was something that most amateurs would dismiss as unimportant.  Playing at this level, the player was compensating well with no more than an occasional wobble when under pressure.  In the intense strain of a professional game, however, the Beater would find himself off his broom.
Grey eyes met green and held as Harry touched him.  His hand grew bolder sliding down to caress his sides and up under his arms, his fingers never lingering, never speeding up, just touching, soft and gentle.
“Are you trying to get me drunk Malfoy?” Harry teased and then nearly slapped a hand over his mouth.  Given Draco’s reaction to Harry at the club he was certain any flirtatious behavior would be unwanted.  “I’m sorry, Draco.  This stuff may have hit me faster than I expected.”  He put his glass back down on the bar and slid it away.
Draco smile was the brightest Harry had ever seen as he waved the house elf behind the bar away and took his place.  “What are you having?”
Goyle had gone to work off his stress on his weights and Zabini had gone to work off his on the piano.  From what Harry could tell he was halfway through the entire Phantom of the Opera score.  Harry had not asked what Ron and Pansy were off doing.
As usual, he was more worried about others than himself.  Draco wanted to hug him and never let go.  How could anyone think Draco was worthy of that?
Draco smiled, obviously pleased with their reactions.  “Let’s get Pansy tucked in and then I’ll give you the grand tour,” he said.
Draco’s mouth twisted up.  He was obviously trying to work out how to explain to one of the ‘Golden Trio’ why those who came out of the war famous for all the wrong reasons currently avoided St. Mungos.
“No.”  The steel resolve in Harry’s voice got through to his friend.  Ron sighed and nodded his defeat.
“Nothing I can do, not if I want to keep my job.  Robards pulled some strings with Miriam Lockhart, Gilderoy Lockhart’s older sister …”
I am not sure I approve.  A broken boy would be much easier to manipulate.  The control in his pace belies the tightly reigned in fury reflected in his face.  I wish I was close enough to see his eyes.  He is magnificent.
“Alright, then.  I guess if you’re not heading to the Apparition point there is no point waiting for you.  We’ll keep you posted if we find anything.”  Neville clapped Harry on the back and headed out.
alright?” Draco asked back incredulously and decided to hell with decorum.  He wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist and held on tight.  With Harry still recovering from the torture, Draco was not sure who was supporting who and yet despite that, all was wonderfully perfect in his world.  That was his only excuse for what slipped out next.  “I’m in love with a git.”
“None,” Neville said.  “The lads and I must have canvased every local business in the city.  No one has seen Rookwood, and with all the scars on his face he would be a hard one to miss.  You sure it was him, mate?”
Malfoy turned back, squaring his shoulders.  The way his old rival prepared himself for battle was as known to Harry as his own.  “This is not like when you were here, Potter,” Malfoy hissed.  “Slythern has already beaten Gryffindor once this year.”
Harry’s first thought was to sweep Draco up in his arms and never let him go.  The second, an over-eager yes was also forced back down his throat.  He was a grown man.  He WOULD be composed about this.  “If I say yes, can I still take you out before that?”
“It was an impossible situation that should have never been left to a bunch of kids to sort out.  Am I happy with the choices you made?”  Harry shrugged, “Not really, but I don’t envy the situation you found yourself in.  It’s over.  We survived it.  That’s enough for me.”
Ron sighed and pulled back.  His chewed on his lower lip for a minute before asking in a low broken voice, “Am I too needy?”
“Aww … don’t listen to them, pretty girl.  They just don’t recognize you, is all,” Charlie cooed at the towering beast.  “‘Course you were quite a bit smaller last time they saw you.”
“A mate of mine, his younger brother disappeared from that area a while ago.  Even though he’s kind of a rebellious kid, it still isn’t like him to just take off.  A group of us are taking some time off to go after him.”
After a bit Harry cleared his throat and asked with a forced smile, “Fred and George still out selling you two to one?”
The shock of the moment had passed and the sound of snickering could be heard.  Harry pressed his lips together tightly not to join in.  The expression on Peeve’s frozen face was priceless.  Looking down at the ghost wasn’t the horror that Harry had experienced when he had seen Hermione in a similar state.  Despite McGonagall's protests this was indeed a prank, one with a well-known cure, and perpetrated on someone renowned for harassing everyone in the castle as often as occasion would permit.
Ron tipped her head back gently, cast a quick spell and looked into her eyes.  Pansy did not know what he was looking for, but he seemed to have found it.  He turned back to Harry to shout, “she’s alright!  Go after him!”
The rest of Arthur climbed out of the pile to stand before his son.  “I know things haven’t been easy between you lately.  I’m not surprised, but I am truly sorry.”  He put a hand on Ron’s shoulder.
Harry walked away, frustrated.  “Why am I doing Ron’s job again?” he asked himself even as he started stopping people in the halls to show the picture.  Despite the frustration, Harry knew why he was here.  The image of a pair of grey eyes, lit up in relief when Harry said he believed him, kept him going.  He and Draco had done little more than wave at each other in passing, between the band schedule and Harry’s hunt for the escaped Death Eaters.
My body tenses. Even though I'm in good terms with Kingsley, many people still believe me to be a death-eater. Plus many more people have been offended by my father.
"One more word about Draco and I promise you Ronald that you won't stay alive to make a sound let alone say another word. I have told you time and again and I'm repeating it now for the last time. Get the fuck out if my life, you selfish, fame digging arseholes. Get out! You made me leave Draco! Forced me to be with that slut sister of yours. Forced me to leave the man I'm still so madly in love with. You forced me into this miserable, painful life while I could have been happily married already with him. And now, I left you. I threw you all out of my life the way you made me throw him out. Get out!" Harry yelled so loud. "OUT!"
Darien looks at Narcissa who is looking back at him with wide eyes. Darien smiles at her and calls her close.
"I'm in love with him. I'm sorry Darien. Goodbye." Millicent gets down the car and apparates to Cormac's flat.
Harry watches Draco breath. He loves watching Draco. Draco is a kink for him on its on. He really shouldn't be surprised with this realisation after accepting he's always been obsessed with him but he still is. He remembers the six years of watching the Slytherin, two tables away, in between the crowd. Harry can always spot him out like he's on the spotlight. He remembers noting Draco's every move, imprinting it in his brain. Like knowing that Draco plays with his nails when he's nervous, he loves reading fantasy fictions more than other genres, he always have sweets as much as he can during breakfast, he always rubs the green apple with a cloth before he bites on it, things as such. And he's still here, laying besides Draco, watching him lay there with his eyes closed and brows smooth with a content smile on his face. He can't stop himself. He won't stop himself. Draco is his and he can watch Draco for eternity if he wants. His hand still on Draco's arse, he tilts himself to snuggle Draco, get him in his embrace, and Draco, like his good pet, always comes.
Draco comes in slowly, sucking another blood lollie. He looks at Hermione and Ron warily. He's still avoiding everyone who isn't Harry or Astoria. He slowly walks towards Harry. Hermione casually folds the letter and puts it in her pocket in a way no one would think anything suspicious is happening. Draco walks towards Harry and stands in front of him. Harry, who was leaning his arse of the large desk in his study, pulls Draco close and holds him.
Harry tightens his hold on Draco as Draco nudges more onto him. He smiles looking at Draco, who has a goofy grin at his face. He's still hard, his poor pet, but the erection will wilt soon enough. He kisses Draco's forehead and chuckles as his pet babbles something incoherent.
He sat in the classroom which was prepared for everyone going through mind healing. Marina was here for his weekly appointment.
Harry's eyes snapped open. Was this weird? Does Draco do not like it? How did he give this up when he had tried to be subtle about it? Does Draco hate it? The last thing he wants is for Draco to feel uncomfortable and unsafe with Harry. How does one feel feel safe when they find out their lover loves seeing them cry?
"Its not possible Bee. I can't leave Teddy and I don't think I'll be able to take Teddy there. I want you to go but and complete your education. Did everyone get their letter?" I asked.
"I think I understand. Scorpius takes on me in that regard. I was too dumb to understand my feelings for someone as well. I didn't really know I was gay until the war was almost over. Pansy knew before I did."
"Do you promise not to let anyone purposely know that Pansy Parkinson will be helping you with the tasks?"
They curled up in the bed, Harry holding him close as Draco snuggled him. They shared a lazy kiss, both smiling.
I go to a toy store that has magic as well as muggle toys. I let Teddy select whatever he wants. He takes stuffed unicorn, monkey, dog, cat, tiger, lion, zebra, elephant. Then he takes a few barbies and ken dolls. Then he takes a car he can drive. He takes blocks and a play kitchen. I take some play food to go with the kitchen and some dinosaurs and a quidditch broom for toddlers.
"Wow, you're so disconnected to the world. More so than me. Next you'll tell me you didn't know Lovegood and Longbottom are dating." Malfoy teases.
Narcissa was well asleep while Draco tucked her in. The potions were doing it's work. Darien had left for office. At night. Leaving Narcissa with Draco. With one last glance at Narcissa, Draco cast a patronus, a cat to keep an eye on Narcissa and left the room to call Pansy.
Madam Pomfrey came and handed me my clothes. She told me that I'm good to go. She looked upset. She looked at the entire hospital wing full of students and then looked at me. I knew what she was feeling. I close the curtains and change my robes. I left hospital wing and walked towards the grand hall. I was starving and it was lunch time. I went and sat besides few of my classmates.
"You turn him into a squib and every contract, bond and oath I've ever made to him turns null and void. How poetic, isn't it?" Narcissa smiled.
"Alright." Draco agrees quietly, blushing, and feels a flutter in his stomach when Potter smiles at him.
For years I knew you existed and for years I've always hated your family. Your mother and father made sure my life was difficult when I married Edward. Our families, for years have been thought hatred and racism. When Harry told me about everything you've done, I couldn't be any more happier knowing you grew up to be a good man. I am proud of you Draco and I will be happy to call you my family. I'm sure Teddy will love you too. Send me back a letter to let me know when you will be coming to meet us. I can't wait to meet you my dear boy. You are my family. Waiting to hear from you.
"Times up." Draco stands up and walks out of office. The bell rings as soon as he opens the door to leave.
"No you don't" Harry cut Hermione. "You both have had a good childhood. Loved by your families. You both didn't live in a house where you are hated, neglected and abused. You can only know but you can't understand and you definitely can't relate or feel what we went through. I didn't get raped but I was abused as well. Beaten, starved, neglected. You don't understand and you never will. So don't pretend that you do."
He was going to heal them. Right now he was paying attention to the scars left by people already dead. And to his delight and disappointment, Bellatrix was one of them. He would've loved to be the one to slowly end her pathetic life but alas, that can't be done. The salve gets absorbed into Draco's chest and slowly, they both see the scar disappear. 'TRAITOR' written slowly vanishes and what's left behind is the flawless smooth ivory skin of his pet. Harry looks at Draco, who has a ragged breathing and is staring at the blank space that used to be a scar with wet eyes. He looks up at Harry and smiles. His smile reminds Harry of that of a child's who finally gets to come home after having a bad day at school. The smile filled with relief and it makes Harry feel warm all over. Harry scoops up some more salve and applies it on a knife wound that was caused by some death eaters who died during the war. He slowly, that evening, heals all the scars that were there given by people who are not dead. And those who weren't dead, Harry had a feeling something would happen.
"Not at all. Sweet kids. Keeping the children happy. They entertain us also sometimes." Hera replies.
"That's nice, Draco. You both are good for each other. What kinds of rule you follow? I've noticed the food one. Why wait for him to have the first bite?" Tori asks.
"Let's have a walk darling." Harry says and pulls Draco back. He casts scurgify on Draco to clean all the dust from the wall and stands he motions Draco to walk ahead.
Potter breaks the kiss and gets his hand near his cheeks. Draco flinches and then curses himself. Potters eyes go intense, he slowly caresses Draco's cheek, tenderly and tentatively. Lovingly.
"What shall I do with you now?" Potter asks conversationally. "Oh, I know. Follow me." He says and walks towards the bed. "Kneel." Draco does.
Harry understands his embarrassment. He has afterall brought Draco to a pet shop to buy things for him and he is going to enjoy owning draco in Gryffindor red. But he still has to make sure that Draco is okay with it. He won't buy red if Draco hates it. This is for both of them, not just him. He raises his eyebrows in silent question.
And Harry left. With the bottle safely stored in his coat pocket, he headed towards the lifts once more, his devious plan to spy on Malfoy already forming in his head.
Wait, why was Harry thinking of Malfoy at a time like this? He was in his old apartment, next to his best friend, in his old bedroom next to the room with his other best friend and his ex-girlfriend. Why would Malfoy suddenly pop into his head? Had Harry’s encounter really affected him so? He did want to go back to that bar to see him again, but only for his own personal investigation into what Malfoy was up to nowadays. NOT because he wanted to dance with him again.
Ginny only nodded while Hermione went to go whisper something in Ron’s ear. Upon hearing what Hermione told him, Ron ran to Ginny to look through the photo book before promptly laughing as well. So there he was, Harry, in his old apartment, holding two boxes stacked on top of one another, staring accusingly at his so called “friends” laughing their asses off from looking at most likely the most embarrassing or jarring pictures of Harry.
Harry, Ron and Hermione were all waiting outside Harry’s old apartment door, waiting for Ginny to open it. They would have floo’d but at the moment in Harry’s eyes, flooing felt a bit impersonal, like he was suddenly invading Ginny’s space. Obviously, the apartment belonged to the both of them but Harry left abruptly, making it clear that he didn’t want to be in that apartment anymore. That wasn’t what Harry was thinking at the time though.
“What?” Ron asked defensively, putting the boxes that he was carrying onto the kitchen island. Hermione scrunched up her face as much as she could to stop her from laughing and Ginny turned away and covered her mouth with her hand.
“I personally don’t think that going back to that bar is going to help anybody.” Hermione said quietly. She really is like a mother isn’t she, Harry thought to himself.
After a few minutes of crying and holding each other in one’s arms, it was all getting too much for Harry. Releasing himself from her grip, Harry needed to get out, get some fresh air as the temperature in the apartment soared. Grabbing his coat off the coat hanger, he made it to the door.
“Of course! He probably decided to remove his name from Wizarding mouths because of all the bullshit that followed in his wake!” Harry could tell Ron was getting quite angry from jst hearing the name, Malfoy. In his friendship group, nobody has mentioned the Malfoy name for 5 years. They all wanted to put the war and everything related to that behind them, start on a clean, new slate. So, to suddenly bring the name back up when you’ve just had a breakdown and everyone is in a melancholy mood was probably not the best move.
“Draco, let’s go” a voice from behind them made them both turn simultaneously. The shorter man who Malfoy was dancing with previously was staring at them, looking very expectant.
Harry quickly looked away. He didn’t want to be staring at something that intimate, in the open air just yet. Remember what you came here for. Harry’s whiskey had been forgotten while he was staring at Malfoy on the dance floor. Now, not only did Harry need to drink to forget Ginny and his relationship problems, he also needed to forget Malfoy who was only dancing about 10 metres away. Another big gulp should get him started at least.
Harry turned towards the mirror and ran the water. Staring at himself in the mirror, he looked more dishevelled than he thought he was. His hair, now completely black, was messy (messier than usual) from all the dancing and the hands. His cheeks had a slight flush from the cold (or most likely from the kiss with Malfoy but Harry wasn’t going to dwell on that) and his neck was properly bruised.
“The spare bedroom is still yours.” Hermione pointed down the corridor to the door opposite Ron and Hermione’s bedroom. She got up, placed a kiss on Harry’s forehead before heading over to Ron.
“If it didn’t Hermione, I wouldn’t be sitting on his sofa.” Harry raised is voice in annoyance of how stupid the question was but it was night and people above and below him were trying to get some sleep.
Alcohol was the most obvious choice, even though it was a Tuesday and he had work at the Ministry the next day. Meetings with the other Aurors and paperwork, just thinking about it gave Harry the foundations for a headache. Yes, alcohol will have to do, he just hoped that there were some Hangover potions at Ron and Hermione’s apartment as Harry couldn’t and wouldn’t show his face back at his own place, not after leaving Ginny to cry the evening away as he was now. He would just crash on their sofa, as he has done numerous times before.
Thinking back, Harry probably shouldn’t have left so suddenly. He should have comforted Ginny as she did briefly for him, wait for her to go to sleep, leave a note on the kitchen island and then go. But with his emotions through the roof, the alcohol was more tempting. Tending to his whiskey, Harry took a large gulp, the burn was smooth going down the throat and left him feeling a little better.
Jack nodded briefly, a sad smile, a look of pity on his face. Apparently, Harry's case wasn’t the first that he’d seen. A few moments later, Jack returned with a rock glass of amber liquid, Harry’s saving grace. Harry paid and grabbed the glass like it was his lifeline. Like reading his face, Jack said sternly,
“Yeah. He doesn’t actually own the place, but with the amount of people that like him and the amount of…”
“Fine, but if anything goes wrong, I’m not going to support you.” He handed over the polyjuice to Harry who took it eagerly.
Discreetly, he made his way to the door and started walking down the corridor to the stairs. The apartment building did have a lift and it would have been easier for Harry but he wanted some time to himself and didn’t need anyone else in the lift with him.
“I’m just gonna make this blunt because I don’t want this to be harder than it already is. I think that we should break up” Harry choked around the final words and he heard Ginny gasp slightly.
Harry obliged and faced away from Malfoy. He didn’t know what he was doing but he had an idea of what Malfoy was going to do next.
Shaking his foot to try and remove most of the cold water droplets, he raised his head and something caught his eye. The bar was sneaked away around the corner but definitely appealed to Harry’s needs at this moment in time.
Harry wanted this to be over as quickly as possible so he got straight to work, rummaging through the drawers to find his clothes. Ron pulled out from his pockets a shrunken cardboard box which he then spelled back to normal and put it on the bed. Harry quickly passed him the clothes that he had gathered before opening the wardrobe to get some more. Ron could see Harry’s frantic pace from a mile away.
The music subsided again with the accompaniment of people clapping and cheering. Harry sensed that someone was walking towards him. He didn’t want to turn around and know exactly who but he had a hunch.
Harry’s grip around his glass tightened as he watched Malfoy sway to and fro with the other men. It did seem to Harry very strange that Malfoy, any Malfoy could smile like that. The Malfoys that he knew kept their cool, collected masks on at all times, preventing even the tiniest slip of emotion. The Malfoy that he was watching had removed that mask. He was smiling widely, his eyes full of joy, the harsh lines of his face subsided with the smile only leaving a relaxed individual who was just having a good time.
"Okay, first of all, I met him so that I could tell him to fuck off permanently. Second, who the fuck do you think you are? My father?" Draco yelled.
"Yes, Draco. Why? We thought you'd love this bakery. Jenna said that the baker was cute as well. Fits your type."
"That would be because I'm half Black. And pureblood. And now it likes you since you've got a Black pureblood to permanently reside here and respects you as it's master." Draco explained Harry as he set the spoons and plates.
He pulls me by my hair again and pushes my upper half on the bed. I arch my ass up so he has easy access. I hear the plastic of condom get ripped. He catches my hair with one hand and I feel him enter my pussy. He's going slow first and I moan in the slow pleasure. Slowly he increases his pace and I can feel it till my stomach. I move my hips according to his rhythm and moan in pleasure. He then bends down and he fishhooks my mouth from both his hands and fucks me more faster. My mouth hurts from being pulled apart but I don't complain.
When I step inside I see that the common room is disrupted. There are some first years and second years student crying and terrified. Many people are bruised and hurt. This is too much. I have to do something.
I took the diary with Bee written on it. Ginny took the one with P written. Ron took B amd Hermione took T. We all read the diaries. The diaries had all the messages they had passed on to each other. All the secret intelligence, saving Ginny, saving Luna, all the activities they did to ensure people at school were safe.
Everyone stared at their common room a little too long. All four walls were of the four colours of the houses. The wall with the fireplace red, walls on the sides, blue and yellow. Wall towards the window, green. Outside the window was the beautiful view of the black lake. Comfortable black armchairs, tables, chairs and couch decorated the room. Draco went to look at the board with room numbers and dormmates names.
"What dark magic you used to make Harry Potter fall in love with you? We're here to free him from your curse." One of the two ugly men said.
Draco smiles in the kiss. He always does. How can he not? Christian pulls back and Draco keeps on smiling. Christian kisses his cheek, takes his hand and pulls him out of the crowd. Draco knows they're going to fuck. He hopes Christian uses ropes. And maybe the flogger. Draco looks at his table. Astoria is looking at them. He waves Astoria and she smirks.
"What is he doing here?" Harry asked with gritted teeth as he saw Christian and Draco talk through the glass. "Is Draco blushing?"
"Sure. I'll ask her to join me after breakfast. Draco wants to go to this cafe he saw today so we'll be having breakfast there. Be ready by 7." Harry replied then started towards his room.
He feels Draco inhale the breath of relief. He had realised early on his fear of abandonment. Being left hurt and alone. He never wants Draco to feel like that with Harry but Harry knows this is a slow process and will take some work on. He tells Draco to have some breakfast. Its one of the rules for Draco, to have three meals a day, even if in small quantity. He won't let Draco neglect his food and that is something Draco has been doing for quite some time now. He had noticed since the start of the year when he was observing Draco.
"Are we having a party in the middle of the week? If so then without music, its pretty lame." Potter said.
long. His mind is quiet afer years of mindless screaming and this is all thanks to his most merciful Master. The one he never imagined he'll belong to but he does, and he is madly, deeply, truly and crazily in love with him. His Master, his lover, his Harry Potter, who is still holding his unmarked arms. He tilts his head back and rests his head over Potter's with a goofy grin on his face he isn't aware of. His smile just as pure as the snow that has started to pour outside in the mix of colourful sky through the sun.
Draco's smile faltered. Meet the Weasleys? After so many decades of animosity between the Malfoys and the Weasleys, Draco going in there, being a death-eater, this didn't sound good any more.
Just like that, her body relaxed its defenses and she started to cry.  Loud ugly sobs tore out of her chest that she struggled to breath around.  Her body pour out the horrible trauma through tears and convulsing muscles.
The young face crumpled once again but Harry was proud to see how, a moment later, he firmed his jaw and got himself under control.  “Good,” the brave young man said and then walked away.
“You still don’t get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn’t enough! Holding it, using it, doesn’t make it really yours. Didn’t you listen to Ollivander? The wand chooses the wizard… The Elder Wand recognized a new master before Dumbledore died, someone who never even laid a hand on it. The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will, never realizing exactly what he had done, or that the world’s most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance." Harry said. What is he talking about? “The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.”
"Oh, because wanting to be with Ron's gold digging whore of a sister was alright? Don't even try to deny it. She's made that reputation after I left. If I were to give in to her, she would've made me drop Teddy to an orphanage so that she could use all the money I would spend on my son."
Draco sighed and poured Harry his tea exactly how he liked it. Poured his coffee, sat down on the chair opposite to Harry and put some eggs, sandwiches and sausages on his and Harry's plate. He passed Harry's plate to him and then placed his own plate in front of hinself. He waited patiently for Harry to take a bite. It was one of the rules, Draco had to wait for Harry to take the first bite. If he didn't wish to wait then he could ask Harry's permission to eat before him. This happened everyday. And Draco out of his own volition followed his rule, because he wanted to, not because he had to. And this knowledge always made Harry's chest flutter with excitement. Harry decided not to make Draco wait much long and took a bite of the sausage. Draco smiled gratefully and took a bite of his eggs benedict.
Harry watched delighted as Draco increased the speed and tried to control all the moans and groans. This won't do. Harry cast a nonverbal silencing charm but not a notice me not charm.
He sits next to me and kisses Teddy's head. I do a quick cleaning charm on all of us. He wears his shirt and and I wear mine. We go down with Teddy in my arms for breakfast.
"Yeah. Just worried about Tori. She still has a year to go by in Hogwarts before she can get a job or something." Draco replies.
Draco places Teddy in his crib which has little moons, stars and dragons dangling from above. The harp is still playing a slow, soothing tune. Teddy immediately snuggles with the small stuffed bunny that Pansy had got. He bends down to kiss Teddy's forehead and then lays on his own bed. With a snap, he unlocks the door. He closes his eyes and ignores Potter and Aunt Andromeda as they come in. Of course they wait outside the door. Can't trust a Malfoy and a death-eater now, can they?
Impossibly, Draco's eyes go darker, he gives another moan and a nod. Harry tugs on his hair a bit tighter and pushes Draco further down his cock. He bucks his hips up and feel the tightning of Draco's throat. Draco gags and tries to take Harry even more deep. Harry helps him until Harry's cock is fully inside his tight, warm throat and holds him there for a few seconds, gagging Draco. Draco coughs and tries to breath through his nose. Slowly, Harry pulls him up only to push him down again. Repeatedly. He uses Draco's hair to push him up and down Harry's cock while Draco uses his tongue and is careful with his teeth. Harry slowly fastens the pace until he is effectively and aggressively fucking Draco's throat. Soon enough, Harry's balls tighten and he cums in Draco's mouth, which Draco hungrily swallows. Harry losens his hold on Draco's hair. Draco licks Harry's cock clean and with a pop, leaves Harry's cock.
"Traitor!" The Dark Lord yells while I'm all tied up. Harry is laying on the floor, almost lifeless.
He feels foolish to ever think that Potter will leave him after everything he has done for Draco. He has smiled a little more last two days than he did the whole week. He has spoken a bit more as well but still is pretty minimal. Only when he has too. He thanks all the gods and deities above that it's Potter he belongs to. Potter doesn't force him to talk. He understands that Draco needs the silence. He doesn't understand why Draco needs it, and to be honest, Draco himself doesn't understand. He just knows that he needs it. He'll come back on his feet. He ways does. And even though he has his friends to help him get there, he has Potter to catch him if he falls. And he is blessed to have all of them.
"Now, there, Draco. I meant it when I said it that I'll wait for you.I didn't want anyone to have anything against us. People had found out and you know it. Not to forget the fact that I'm a Weasley and you're a Malfoy."
"It wasn't your burden to bare, Potter. And now you've took it on yourself. I don't want to put more burden on you. I-" Draco bit his lip and looked down again. "I don't want to be a burden on you either."
The door opens and a figure walks in, turns around and closes the door behind them. Harry immediately seals the door with a wandless charm, ensuring that the door won't open without his permission and casts anti-apparation wards as well. The person flinches and turns around with their wand whipped out, pointing straight at Harry from the distance. Harry lights the candles and lamps and smiles at the person.
Draco won't run. He's done running. He'll sit here, finish the cake, pay and leave with his head high. He wasn't the one who used Potter. He was the one who got used. He starts working on his paper again, ignoring Potter who is standing there, looking at him. The worst part is, he can't even blame Potter. Draco is a Malfoy, he's Potter. How can Potter be with a Malfoy after everything they've done in the war. Draco just wishes, that Harry hadn't played him the way he did. He shouldn't have gone along when Draco kissed him, should have never flirted with Draco with his useless puns and compliments and sweet touches. He waits until Potter leaves and then takes a bite of his cake. Fucking Potter! He had to be good in this as well. Thanks to his occlumency that he can keep his emotions inside. He manages not to let a moan out. He sits there, finishes his cake, doesn't even ask for the frappe he had ordered, goes to the counter and leaves extra money, smiles at the girl on the counter and turns to leave. As soon as he opens the door to leave, Potter calls him.
And so Harry does. They wait for about thirty minutes when the dragon comes back. The dragon tells Harry that the trail stops in knocturn alley, right outside an empty building. The patronus is supposed to talk in Harry's voice but it sounds a lot like Draco's. Patronuses aren't supposed to do that.
"But look at him carefully. Come closer." Father says excitedly. “Draco, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, everything will be forgiv—”
Malfoy slowly flicks his wand and the music changed to something instrumental which was slow and soothing. Malfoy kept staring at Harry with unreadable expressions.
It's not always Draco admits such things. But he can't help but think it's true. He's hated many things these few weeks. He's hated the damned aurors for putting him through that interrogation. He hated the minister to let them go through it. He's hated the prosecutor to get ahead and make a scene about the time he got punished to save Potter's life. He's hated that Potter found out the secret he kept for so long. But he hasn't hated himself through all that hate. He doesn't love himself yet, but he doesn't hate himself anymore. And that, that has made his chest a lot more lighter. The grin at Potter's face due to Draco's admission is worth everything Draco's ever been through. It always is. Potter sits up and takes the guitar away from Draco and places it on the bed then pins Draco's body below his own, his hands pinning his wrists above his head on the floor.
This is fantastic! There's a D.e. meeting today. I'll try to find out about who Greyback is eyeing on. At present you just get any one kid you can out of this bloody place.
The door opens and I hold her, pretending to trying to take her clothes of. She yelled and screamed and begged me to let go. Amycus opened the door and saw me forcing her. He looked at the girl and me in anger.
It had been a couple of days since they had spoken about the scars. Harry had made it his mission to heal Draco's scar. He want nothing but the marks he had left on Draco's body. Slowly and surely, he was going to heal them, physically, emotionally, mentally. He opens the vial that had the salve which cured the scars from the time he was cursed by the four siblings. Draco sits on the bed wearing only some sweatpants, leaning on the bed post, his hair tied in a ponytail. Harry sits facing towards him and looks at the salve. He remembers Ron buying it immediately as soon as it had came out, even though it was a bit expensive for him. He remembers Hermione's tears of relief when the 'mudblood' carved on her hand disappeared forever. He remembers holding Hermione while Ron applied it on her hand. Ever since the war, some woman had successfully made this salve that got rid of each and every scar, even the ones created by dark magic. And Harry was about to use it on Draco. He scoops a bit of the salve on his two fingers, slowly spreads over the 'TRAITOR' written on his pet's chest. Its from the same knife that was used on Hermione to wrote 'mudblood' and was done by the same person. Bellatrix Lestrange. Harry hated that woman. He hates the maniac laugh and everything she represents. He remembers holding Dobby in his arms as slowly his breath was taking away, just like his life. He pushed the painful memories aside and concentrated on the scars.
"That I was, in fact, not under any curse or potion. That being with Draco Malfoy is my concious decesion. You know what that means?" Harry asked.
"I think I'm going to adopt a crup and stay single my entire life." Pansy replied, her voice a bit robotic on the phone.
"Fine." Harry grits his teeth. "Been happier with Draco." Harry says and kisses Draco's lips, showing everyone that Draco belongs to him. "How have you been?" He asks finally after kissing Draco.
"Az much az I am honered zoo be granted ziz meezing, I ave zoo azk Mr Potteh, what au you zoing ere?" Cartier asks after two minutes of stunned silence.
"We can't attack on the Pedophiles though. With you in France, if any more pedophiles are killed here, the ministry will attack you, Potter. So we need someone who has done something else." Draco says.
Harry looks at Draco's breakfast. A small part of pancake is ruined from the angry stab but apart from there, not one bite has been into Draco's stomach. He looks at the pancake sadly. He knows he won't be able to feed Draco now and he had rarely managed to convince him to eat two pancakes. He sighs and walks out of the kitchen, leaving them all behind. He enters the room to see it thrashed. The bedsheets are all torn and all around the room, the small coffee table and the chairs are in pieces on the floor. The curtains behind are burning. Draco is standing by the window between the burning curtains with his long hair tied in a messy bun.
Draco opens the dusty box and inside is a beautiful wand. Smooth and made of wood that gives it blue hue. The wood looks blue. He's never seen wood like this before. He picks up the wand and feels it. He feels connecting to the wand. It's his. It's perfect.
He feels hands under his arms and someone picking him up, laying him on the bed. The bed is good. It's comfortable and soft and good. He can distantly hear Potter mutter something, the voice soothing and soft on his ears. And he's unaware of the goofy grin that's on his face as he lays on the bed, his eyes still close and he falls asleep.
"You can call me that whenever you want. Can I call you kitten and pet in front of others?"Harry asks.
"Remember. When the bottle lands at you, you only take a drop. A drop won't last more than a minute."
"Fine. You give us information of every person important to him and their positions and I'll get you out of this place." Harry promises.
"Come." He says in that authoritative tone that Draco found sexy. He nods. Potter walks towards the kitchens and Draco follows him. One step behind. Harry tickles the pear on the portrait and the kitchen doors swing open. They enter the kitchen and Harry gets him a chair. He motions Draco to sit on the chair. A silent order. Draco, a good boy as he is that no one believes, obeys. Potter goes to some elves and they give him two plates of fruits and sandwiches.
I sigh. "Its alright." I hug her. "Go on now. Try to be out of the radar. She nods and walks towards the door. "Belle." I call out.
"I'd also like not getting pissed upon or having me pee myself. I hated that." Draco says tentatively.
Ugh. My head hurts. My body hurts a little bit. I slowly open my eyes and I'm in a familiar place but it isn't my dorm room. I wake up completely. I'm in the hospital wing. Why am I here? Slowly I remember everything that happened. I look around and the hospital wing is filled with students. To my horror besides me is Luna. I look at her and start crying. After everything I've been through, why couldn't they leave her alone?
"Close your eyes." Harry says as he rests his forehead on Draco's and Draco, his obedient pet, obeys.
"We did it for you Potter Sir. We knew you would be free of his curse if we get him out of line." Phillip, the taller one says beaming.
Draco eagerly nods his head and through the crying gives out a 'yes please'. Who is Harry to deny? He walks in front of Draco, admiring the crying face. This is rapidly becoming a growing kink. He steps back and touches the tip of the cane to Draco's neck. He slowly sides it dows through his collarbone to his right nipple. He presses the tip in the nipple amd twists it. Draco lets out a small cry. He's breathing too fast.
"Extremely dominating. Extremely hot. It's like she was meant to be a dominatrix. But she's not much into giving pain as well. She avoids it. But she loves being in charge. I think I will be getting myself one of those collars from Ginny as well, soon."
Draco turns towards him and presses his face on Potter's chest, Potter replies by immediately tightening his hold on Draco. Potter gently kisses the top of his head. Draco tilts his head up, opens his eyes and looks at his Master who is already looking at him with intense heat filled with love from those beautiful green eyes. Green. So green. It reminds him of this one night he spent in Greenland with the Greengrass family. The sky was black with hues of bright green northern lights that mingled with clouds, showering the ground with its brightness. One of the most beautiful sights Draco has ever seen, the northern lights, and Potter's eyes. Potter is looking back at him with such fondness that Draco is sure is a reflection of his own fondness. He's still smiling.
"Bee, I need to say something." He said nervously. Belle raised her eyebrows. "Do you think it is wrong if a boy likes wearing girly clothes? Like panties or crop tops?"
Draco won't leave the bed and he hasn't eaten anything since yesterday morning before they went to the court. He's silent, won't even make a small sound. His face is fallen and there are already bags forming below his eyes. He won't leave Harry even for a second and Harry is growing rapidly concern. He's just laying on the bed, holding Harry tight. Harry needs to use the loo, empty his bladder but he can't seem to get up. He however tries to untangle himself from Draco and just as he manages Draco holds his hand.
"That's sweet, Potter. I'll ask her but I don't know if she'll agree. She has a very strong personality. She will stand her ground until she is sure it would make no difference but she might need an escape for a day or two." Draco replied.
Harry roughly pushes Draco more into the wall and pulls his wrists almost up to his upper back. He feels the satisfaction as Draco's eyes widen and he groans in more discomfort.
"She's cut throat, scary, not one to be messed with and a Slytherin. Means she'll use all underhanded methods to get what she wants. She's brilliant at her job." Neville tells Elizabeth.
"Well, I can't let this go. You know that right?"  McGonagall asked and Belle nodded. "Detention on Monday after class."
He's pretty sure he's successful in creeping out the duke now, if the duke swallowing is any indication. Just as he suspected, the duke turns around to run, only to fall when Harry snaps his fingers. The ropes come up flying, tying his hands behind his back, his arms and his chest, his thighs and his ankles. He falls down and with another snap, Harry positions him on his knees.
"For my mother." A tear escapes Draco's eyes. He's just so tired, he can't stop himself. "I just wanted her safe. I tried." He sobs. He can feel his shoulder jerking. He can feel the tears stain his cheeks. " He would've killed her. I just wanted my mother safe. I wanted her safe. I wanted her alive and I did all I could to keep her alive. I didn't want to do any of it. I tried so much to find a way. To find a way to break the loyalty bonds. To break her marriage so that I can take her away and keep her safe. To take her away from my father and the other death-eaters. I tried."
"She drops subtle hints. If you can pick them up and be brave enough then you will work a relationship with her." Belle said. "I'm tired. Let's call it a night."
Morning, Draco woke up, feeling his head and chest on something firm and someone playing with his hair. He slowly opened his eyes, turned to place his chin on Potter's chest and saw Potter staring at him intensely with soft expressions. He gave a content sigh and turned his head so that his cheek lay at Potter's chest. He looked out at the beautiful view he sun was mostly up, giving a pink tinge to the clouds in the dark sky.
"Very good." The professor smiled. "Five points to Ravenclaw. And can anyone else tell me some professions where occlumency is used?"
"Do you promise not to let anyone purposely know that Blaise Zabini will be helping you with the tasks?"
Harry had a feeling that Charlie and Draco had a past. Maybe Charlie was Draco's ex? But how would that even work? Charlie lives in Romania. And Charlie is way too old. He's at least eleven years older than them. He watches as Draco comes out of the bathroom and storms off out of the room and Harry is just, very confused.
"Stand, pet." Harry says and Draco get's on all fours. "Good boy." Harry grins and gives Draco another treat. "Let's teach you a new trick now." Harry says.
"If you've got to listen to music this early in the morning then at least play something slow. This is too loud to be played in the morning." Harry grumbled.
"Listen to me Draco. You are an amazing man. You went against your father's bullshit. You grew up and stood for what's right. You're so loved by a muggleborn sister. You're raising a child who isn't pureblood. You are amazing, you have to remember that. You deserve all the love. I love you." I say and send a patronus to call Belle.
a treacherous part of his brain reminded. Harry looked at Draco. His face free of the worry of abandonment. Harry will have to have a chat with the editor of Prophet.
Harry was speechless. What would he say about this? Dumbledore lead to slaughter? And Salazar Slytherin wasn't motivated to kill muggleborns but save them from the lide Harry lived with Dursleys?
"Thank you all for being here." I say in cracked voice. "Andromeda Tonks was one of the best Black family member to exist along with Sirius Black. Within one week of meeting her, she was more of a mother to me than my own mother ever was. I wish I knew she existed so that she would've been my family way before. She loved me and accepted me with her whole heart. She was a kind, caring amd extraordinary woman. I love you Aunt Romie. May your soul rest in peace and you be happy in afterlife. Thank you for everything." I give up and start crying. Belle comes and gives me a hug.
"Save it Zabini." She gives him a glare threatening him to shut up. "I wonder what they're cooking. I'm in mood for cake." She said changing the topic. I feel grateful.
Harry wouldn't have listened to Draco but the look on his face, desparately begging to get on with it, Harry couldn't deny his begging. He stepped forward and stood in front of Kingsley, glaring at him. The mediwitch did her tests, proving that Harry is in fact not under any potion or curse which seemed to disappoint the aurors.
"It makes me my father's son. I'm sorry for everything he has done Harry. He didn't leave your parents alone in school as well. Malfoys don't deserve love. I'm a death-eater. It won't go." He now started crying hard.
"Because I don't have the permission to say yes to you. And I don't even want to. And my boyfriend will not like it and it won't be pretty for you." Draco replies.
Twice more. Draco lay in his nest, which smelled perfectly of Potter, and tried to wrap his head around what had happened. His heat had ramped up, Potter had buggered him, and it had receded. The intervals between … fits… were growing shorter, however, and his incoherence in the throes of them was growing even worse. Never, not in any of even the wildest Slytherin parties, had he ever been as drunk as the hormones made him feel, and he had never been so out of control of himself. It was insupportable.
“Brie, that’s a French cheese, baked in puff pastry. Sometimes they put fruit in with it,” Draco said, sounding a bit breathless. Harry caught his hand and began sucking his fingertips to get the taste of the honey and the pure taste of Draco.
Ohhh. He was no longer being battered, down below; it had subsided back into an incessant press and slide, but the half-knot was not being shoved against him anymore, and he was grateful for that. Potter’s lips, though…
He pushed, and felt the muscles give. Pushed more, and felt them part entirely. Draco gasped and then tensed in his arms as he pressed in completely, and he hugged him tightly and mouthed the scent gland in the crook of his neck as he ground his cock into the omega and then began to rock back and forth. After a moment, Draco’s tension melted and he began to move in his arms, arching into the thrusts and keening quietly.
"I know you ziz, 'Arry. But what's the point in putting yourself en eem in so much pain when you've left Ron and Hemione? I mean, zhey still do try-"
"We can use that." I speak. "Belle, you could teach us everything you know that we might not know. Salazar knows the defence against the dark arts is shit here."
"I hear Malfoy is in St Mungos. He seems pretty out of it." Harry says conversationally as if he's discussing whether.
"You've never gone so deep before. So deep in subspace. You were so high that you were bound to drop. It's natural." Harry explains.
Today I received the reports from the doctor." Ralph read from his diary while Hera lay there, her head on his chest.
"Guys. She's Belle Darling. Yes that's her name." Belle chuckles at this. "She's my friend. Belle, this is Pansy, Theo and Blaise."
"Wow. I can't believe you would think that Harry. I'm 200% gay. I never felt attracted towards women and if I did, I'd have some class. Bulstrode? When there's Pansy or Luna or Weaslette or Granger or literally so many other actually good looking women? Seriously Potter. I'm disappointed. Plus I love you." Draco said.
His eyes widened as he watched Weasley leave the kitchen and pull his wand out as soon as he saw Draco. He stood there frozen as Blaise put his wand on Weasley's throat, Pansy drew her wand as well, pointing at Granger while the counter girl pointed a knife at Weasley.
"Potter. Did you really care about saving Slytherins? You all treated us like shit just because of how our parents were. We retaliated and treated you'll like shit as well. We knew none of you'll will care what happens to Slytherins so I made that sacrifice and ruined my name just so all the Slytherins will be out of there. You call us racist while we have been tolerating your hatred and racism as well. I did what I had to do to save my people." Pansy said in a stern voice. My stomach hurt. I knew she was speaking the truth.
"Woah this will take time to get used to." Pansy says as she enters the kitchen. I let out a chuckle.
Harry remembers that night Draco had the nightmare where Astoria helped wake him up. He remembers how that nightmare was specifically bad and affected Draco more than others. He holds Draco tight as he cries hard in Harry's arm and Harry barely manages his own tears. Harry's eyes fall at the pictures and his blood runs cold as ice, he can barely breathe. There are pictures of a limp and naked Draco Malfoy, surrounded by so many death-eaters, at least ten of them. They all have their hands on Draco, his Draco, while one is in Draco's mouth and other is under Draco, clearly visible of what he is doing underneath the limp and barely moving Draco. How can people be so inhuman? How can they do something like that to a child? How can one watch unbothered as their child goes through something so horrendous and horrible? And Draco had to go through this because he chose to save Harry that night in the manor. Harry shuts his eyes close and the pictures burn. He can't look at them anymore.
Harry ignores the blush in his cheeks and folds the bags then wards the cabinet shut. Only he has the access to the cabinet. Not even Draco. And if Draco wants anything from this cabinet, which he always does then he has to ask Harry. And ask he does. First it used to be two three times a day but since he's got the fixation for his blood lollies, Draco asks about five to seven times a day. Harry leaves the kitchen but not without telling them that Draco and him might not be there for dinner. As soon as he enters the room, he smiles at Draco who is waiting on the edge of the bed on all fours like an eager kitten. His tail starts wagging faster as Harry enters the room. He then looks at the paper bag in Harry's hand curiously and Harry smirks.
"If I could, I'd make him sleep still. He kicks a lot in sleep." Hermione laughed and then so did others.
"I was born here, in London. But after my dad died, my mother had to move back to Yorkshire. Small town. My father was a waiter. He used to clear plates and wipe tables while others ate the expensive food. But he had a dream. To open his own restaurant. He built the few walls, but didn't have money to complete the construction. He died here. On this land, under this under-constructed building. You know, Millie, I worn the same uniform last three years of Hogwarts. Even with all the death-eaters around and life in danger, I didn't have enough money to buy new one while I was desperately trying to stay alive. Thank god for magic. I tutored children, did all sorts of odd jobs to save up money. I'm still just saving money. So that one day I can finish the construction if this restaurant. Fullfill my dad's dreams. If money was everything, I would've sold this land ages ago and would've spent my time relaxing and enjoying instead of working overtime everyday. Stay with me please. Don't go home."
"Draco, before he left after the battle, he asked me personally to make sure I take care of Belle. I knew Belle was getting the information from the inner circle but I didn't know who was giving it to her. She said she had made an unbreakable vow so she can't tell us until they themselves don't." Luna explained.
Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny and Luna sat in one compartment, chattering while Harry stayed quiet.
"Oooh Pansy has a crush. I knew you liked her. You couldn't keep your eyes of her even for a second. My doubt was confirmed when she said she'd hook up with Ginny and you looked like you would hex her then and there." Theo said. That fucker.
Well, I said talk to her not mumble something and then yell at her. Not my fault you can't function like a normal human being
"Bee. My Buzzy Bee!" I managed to say with cracked voice. I  wiped her tears and kissed her forehead. "My Bee. My Bee." I repeated and hugged her tight.
"There's that blush. I missed that blush of yours. You're gorgeous when you blush, you know that?" Christian smiles.
Blaise glared her for a second then took a drop of veritaserum. He crawled towards Belle. Belle could feel the butterflies in her stomach turn into a whole zoo. Blaise turned and looked at Draco, silently asking for permission. Draco nodded. Blaise looked at Belle again and slowly they reduced the distance between their lips. The kiss was slow and passionate. Blaise's tongue tried to enter her mouth and she happily gave access. After a few seconds of intense kissing, Blaise pulled back. Belle couldn't look at him and kept looking down at her lap. Her body burning with fire inside. Blaise gave another small peck and went back to his seat, smiling. Blaise spun the bottle amd it landed on Hermione.
Pansy waits in the waiting room of the Witch Weekly's building for an interview. She still works for the prophet, but she just can't anymore. It's too much for her. She turns the pages of her magazine as she hears a familiar voice. She looks up to see Longbottom.
Draco takes the phone to the living room, only room with magical socket. He places Darien's phone on charge and just as he was about to keep the phone down, it rings. There's a message. Darien is shaving so Draco thinks maybe he can give Darien the message. He opens to check but what he finds is not what he expected.
“Pansy, you are a woman of hidden depths.”  Draco threw his arms around her.  “We will definitely invite your mother to hear us perform.”
Ron shrugged.  “We both agree that the man has gone around the bend, but is it enough for Kingsley to do anything … I don’t know.”
The walk to the nearest club was too short and did nothing to clear Draco’s head.  He ditched his coat and took to the floor, hoping the pounding beat of the music would help.  He was ignoring the small voice in his head whispering “what if…?”.  It sounded far too much like a much younger version of himself, the eleven year old dreaming of a new friend, of someone who could help him.
He pushed her hair back behind her ear and smiled like the sun had come out.  “My pleasure,” he said, and Pansy believed him.  Believing Ron was becoming a habit.
“That snake has been nothing but bones for years.” McGonagall stepped away, dodging George’s grab for the eye.
Draco sat up.  Harry pulled his hand back, expecting another rejection.  Instead, he found himself with an arm full of warm Malfoy.  “Hold me.”
The next moment, all Pansy could see was Ron’s chest as he wrapped her up in his strong, warm arms.  “It’s alright Pansy, I’ve got you.  It’s over.”
The one thing Draco did know, catching Rookwood’s pleased expression as he approached, was that things were about to get worse.  “Draco Malfoy, my dear boy.  So good to see you.”  The grandfatherly tone was belied by the sinister expression on his scarred face.
Harry didn’t know when he started taking pictures, it was almost an extension of the song itself. Shots of Malfoy, moving to the beat of the music, his long white blond hair fanned out around his head like some elegant underwater sea creature. Shots of Goyle and Blaise as they leaned into the music, each intent on the passion they were creating; shots of Pansy, her whole body moving to the beat as she ran the length of the stage with her guitar.
The mention of Hermione got Ron’s attention right quick.  He took a breath and shook his head.  “She’s not … we’re not together any more.”
“And I thought your obsession with Draco was bad fifth year.  You got nothing on Robards.” Ron said, leaning back and stretching out a bit as he warmed to his subject.
Draco looked up and up and up again to find the dragon looking back.  He shuddered and looked away.  He had been trying to forget what it was exactly that he was using as a backrest.  It had been a plan that had been working for him.
“Are you saying that you saw this man right here talking to the bus driver for ‘Sly’ yesterday.”  Harry clarified.
Ron grinned.  “It’s almost like being back at Hogwarts.  The world burning down around our ears and all anyone wants to do is talk about the Malfoys.”
“Several weeks,” the potions master admitted.  “We don’t stock fully-grown Mandrake root in school for obvious reasons.  I doubt we will find any for sale at a reasonable price either.”
Still, there was only so much of being cooped up that a girl could take before she just had to go shopping.  The tour bus pulled in as the first rays of the sun were coming out.  Manchester was too big a city to ever really sleep, but the early morning was as close as it came and Pansy took full advantage of the new town and the hope that their fans had not yet figured out that they had moved.
Draco Malfoy simply looks down his aristocratic nose at him.  “And this is justice, is it?”  He does not wait for a response.  With a swirl of his cape, he turns and walks off.
Pansy rushed to Ron, throwing her arms around him as he groaned.  Draco spared them a glance before he staggered to his feet and stumbled, unwilling and more than a bit panicked, towards the edge of the steep drop off.
“Yes!” Fred cheered.  The twins gave each other a high five.  One hand passed through the other but neither seemed to mind.
“I could do manual labor,” Greg volunteered.  “If you didn’t have to worry about me the two of you could find something, I’m sure.”
Loud familiar cords ripped through the quiet of the club.  The unmistakable opening to Phantom of the Opera caught everyone off guard, grabbing attention as the unexpected sounds resonated through every chest.
Harry believed him.  Draco struggled not to burst into relieved laughter.  He had been so sure, even with Harry’s defense of them against Robards, that he would dismiss what Draco had seen.  But he had not even hesitated, simply accepting what he said as true.
Draco peeked out from Harry’s shoulder to watch Shacklebolt.  He was glancing around at the field full of Aurors when his face suddenly brightened.  “Ron!”
“Huh,” Charlie said, scratching his head.  “Maybe you ought to take several in a row.  I mean that one isn’t bad, but then you’ll have a selection.”
“I mean taking the pictures, dummy,” Charlie glared.  “The image you get on a camera isn’t anything like what you see.  The lighting is different.  I almost always found I had to have more light than I thought on whatever part of the dragon I wanted to see.  And then having the camera pointed at just the right spot, ready to take the picture right when the dragon was in just the right place … I’m telling you, harder than it sounds.”
“Thank you!” Ron said.  Some of the weary exhaustion lifted off his shoulders at the reminder that he was in charge, that he had finally achieved a position of respect.
The two of them had managed to meet a couple times inside the club where they were performing, before a show.  Pansy would spend a few minutes venting her justifiable frustration with Draco and Ron would grumble about Harry's pinning and they would stand really close together and hold hands and smile and flirt.  Draco might be miserable, but Pansy was having the time of her life.
“Still, that was a completely different lady altogether,” Charlie waved the other away.  “This pretty girl here has her own history with the two of you.”
“If you are here to arrest us on spurious charges do it.  Otherwise get out.” Pansy pointed to the door
“No arguments from me, mate.  If anyone had any reason to dislike Malfoy, it’s us and if we think the sentence is stupid and pointless, I can’t imagine how anyone else justified it.”
Draco could not look away.  Harry and Ron lay on the ground screaming, Dolohov standing over them cackling in delight at their pain.
Shacklebolt led Robards off which left Draco alone with two Weasleys.  That would be bad enough but he had the sickening realization that he owed them both an expression of gratitude.  He was struggling with exactly how he was going to pull that off and not lose all sense of decorum when Harry Potter arrived to save the day again.   He pulled Draco to his feet and wrapped him close.  “Are you alright?”
Harry shrugged.  ‘No idea.  Neville said the potion was a personal interest project.  He was just looking for something that would have saved…”  His voice tapered off.  Even after all this time he struggled to talk about it.
“Only after we both figured out neither one of us wanted to get back together.  Before that it was awkward as fuck.  You, my friend, have lost the privilege of setting me up on any more dates.”
Greg and his new girlfriend were sickening, as Draco repeatedly informed anyone who would listen.  Greg’s new favorite pastime was lifting weights in his room to the beat of their own music while his girlfriend oo’d and ahh’d at him.  He was dressed all in black, when he got dressed at all, and the eyeliner he wore was tastefully done; apparently his girlfriend was a bit of a makeup diva.  Pansy was forced to admit he might be going a bit over the top, but he seemed happy.  The new muscles he was sporting as he walked around the tour bus half dressed, however, were making Pansy a bit uncomfortable.  This was Greg after all.  That he might have a body worth noticing was not something she had ever considered and quite frankly never wanted to.
Harry moved even closer, slow and careful, until there was only a breath of air separating them.  “What was it about Fred that caught your attention?”
“Stop it!” Pansy yelled in helpless fury as Ron screams are cut off as his lungs struggled to keep up with the demand for oxygen.  Her cries only goaded the mad man on, Dolohov's face twisted in unholy glee as he renewed his efforts.
That Rookwood had been spotted talking to the bus drive the day before the band’s trip north could be a coincidence.  While Harry had been out searching the city, that the Death Eater had been walking around right under his nose…. it could just be incredible timing ... but Harry did not believe that for a moment.  That Rookwood had been there yesterday could only meant that there was going to be another attack today.
How could anyone resist wanting something so beautiful?  The thought broke Harry out of his trance and he pulled his eyes away from the stage.  Once more he pulled out his wand and checked the crowd.  No magic.  No magical ingredients in the air.  The spell the ‘Sly’ band was casting over the crowd was completely natural, a combination of charisma and talent.
Harry’s lips quirked up as well and he shrugged.  “It was a tough time.  I don’t blame anyone for trying to survive.  You really can’t think of any reason why Rookwood would attack Pansy?”
In the stillness of the night, Draco indulged in thoughts of Harry Potter and what might have been and the demons were quiet.
“Harry, I’ve been your friend since we were eleven.  You’ve always been obsessed with what he was doing, what he was wearing, the color of his hair … lordy I can’t even count all the times you went off about his hair.  Now that the git has grown it out long you’re going to be impossible to live with.”
“No,” Draco said, the same thing he had been saying from the beginning when Greg mentioned going off on his own.
“What?,” Ron struggled to stay on his feet pressed in between all of the bodies.  He was obviously miserable in the noise and the heat.
Harry had often wondered how his archrival was fairing, knew it could not be easy with the choices his family had made, and even found himself with feelings of sympathy that he was not exactly sure what to do with.  It was good to hear that the clever blond had not only found a way to survive but to thrive.  Staring at the flames Harry could almost see that aristocratic nose raised in proud superiority.  While once such a pose would have infuriated him, Harry now felt only amusement as he imagined this expression he knew so well turned on the world.
While the bus was reminiscent of the Wizarding tents with their expansion spells, saying they were the same was like comparing Harry’s tiny room under the stairs at the Dursley’s with Hogwarts.  The bus was on a different scale entirely, complete with house elves scuttling about.
Thank you to everyone for their support!  I will reply to every comment, I treasure every kudo, and I thank everyone for reading.
Before Harry can figure out how to respond, the professor's eyes catch on something just over Harry’s shoulder.  “Merlin save us,” Malfoy breathed in horror.
“I will have you all safe.”  Miriam said, warming to her new subject.  “And Harry Potter is the best in the business.  Aren’t you Harry?”
He had made it a point to be in the audience, front and center for every performance.  Partly it was to keep an eye out for Rookwood, but he was also still the band photographer.  Taking pictures of Draco had become an obsession.  The way he moved was like grace personified, his arms raised above his head, his body bending and thrusting.  By the end of each concert, Draco was drenched in sweat and Harry needed to lock himself in a loo for some much needed relief before he was presentable.
“He’s not as bad as all that, not really.  I know you lot all had your rough times at school but that’s all behind us now.  Those of us who survived have to pull together if we don’t want the next generation having to fight the same wars over again.”
“Not here, obviously,” Draco said, but he was looking up.  Harry followed his gaze.  It was like an optical illusion.  The windows lining the ceiling of the room appeared to be two stories high, but the long figure looking down at them through the glass appeared as large as though they really were only separated by the height of the bus.
“I have already posted several of the really good ones out on social media, which have caused a firestorm of interest.  The best ones I’m holding onto for posters and fliers and such,”  Miriam was explaining but Draco barely heard her.
“Blaise.”  That was Malfoy’s voice, deep and resonating, washing over the crowd with almost as much power as the chords of the music.  People laughed again at the obvious scolding tone in that one word.  The lights came up just enough for everyone to see Malfoy, tall and majestic, the microphone in hand as he peered back over his shoulder towards the keyboard and his bandmate.
Pansy rolled her eyes at him before pulling him to his feet.  “Come on, let’s get you out of here before you get yourself in trouble.”
It will be a couple weeks before I start posting the next chapter in the Not Easy story.  I've gone through the original and made a whole bunch of fixes and changes to the original and will be posting those next week.
Ron was not there yet and neither was his favorite Slytherin so Harry dropped himself into a spot with lots of room.  As he waited, Harry made it a point to catch the eye and give a smile to every student he knew.  He wasn’t aware of Ron’s presence until he dropped down onto the bench beside him.  He turned, opening his mouth to speak when someone took the seat on his other side.  Malfoy looked as uncomfortable as he had ever seen him as he glanced up at Harry’s face from beneath his fringe.
That the two of them were both single again was going to take a bit of getting used to. Although Harry was pretty sure it would be a while before Ron was ready to start anything new, he could not help thinking about what the future might look like.  There would be new people in their lives.  Harry wondered who they were, what they would look like and where they would find them.
Even Pansy herself had fallen under Draco’s temper.  Ron had battled his way to the tour bus door every morning bearing chocolates and flowers and danish pastries.  The first day he had shown up, Draco had nearly blown a gasket, although it did not stop him from taking his fair share of the pastries.  That Pansy and Ron were working their way up to a proper date had not escaped anyone’s notice.  Draco would go off about consorting with the enemy and Pansy would sit quietly and file her nails until he was done.  Then, leaving a kiss on his cheek, she would head off to her own room to owl Ron about how much she enjoyed the chocolates and his smiles.
Ron didn’t even bother to look up at Pansy from where he was hunched over with the pyrotechnics lead.  “Are you kidding?  This is fascinating.  It’s almost as good as what George is doing at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.”
“No idea.  That stuff is not exactly funny.  Not that Fred and George can’t make anything funny, but I can’t think of a use for it.”  Both of them exchanged a look, remembering the Chamber of Secrets and the Basilisk.  “But maybe that’s what Neville is helping them with.”
His breathing ragged, he nodded.  “I can’t… I just can’t…”  Ron seemed as incapable of completing a sentence as Harry.
Ron was as good as his word.  He and Harry hovered over Pansy obsessively, making it very clear to anyone who even got close to her that she was important to them, and anyone who treated her with less than their best would answer to them.  Draco looked as dazed as Pansy felt as he got swept up in the whole procession.  He was called Mr. Malfoy in respectful tones by everyone after the first sneer resulted in Harry tearing into a poor nurse hard enough that the poor guy would probably feel his ears ringing for a week.
Ron scratched his head and sat back up straight.  “He might say that letting them know they were under investigation would make them nervous enough to make a mistake.”
“I ran into Neville the other day and he mentioned working on a project with the twins.  I have to admit I was surprised.  Neville’s speciality these days is in healing herbology.  I can’t think of two people who need a staff doctor more than your brothers but that doesn’t seem like the kind of thing they would be interested in.”
Harry makes Draco drink some water with success. Kreacher pops with a tray of sweets, cakes and pastries that Draco loves. He has called Kreacher from Hogwarts for a while until Draco is better and Harry can go back to cooking and cleaning. Ginny and Tori have been helpful. Harry asked them to stay for as long as they can to help with Draco and the house. They occasionally come and sit in silence with Draco while Harry manages other things.
"You are his everything. Entire year I've seen him look at you like he has hearts in his eyes." Ron replies.
"You look pale amd tired. If I didn't know better, I think you've put on glamour charm. Are you okay?" I asked.
He lands in front of a three story building which looks abandon. The building is all concrete black wood. Its broken on so many places and looks like hasn't been cleaned in ages.
He bends down and places a kiss on Draco's forehead as he caresses his cheek. Draco rarely flinches now if Harry's hands go anywhere near his cheek. This is just one of the so many ways they have achieved, so far they have come. And Harry is extremely proud of both of them.
"What if, what if I do and it's a mistake? What happens when Granger and Weasley come back and don't approve? What if they make him choose and he chooses them? What if I end up hurt like always?"
"Yes." Potter replied. "Stay with me during break, we'll come back to Hogwarts together. I'd even like to introduce you to my adoptive family."
"One thing's missing though." Potter says and walks towards Draco. Draco looks at him confused. He's dressed, hair styled, make up done. Only his boots are left which he will wear later. What's missing?
"There's this spell I learnt about four days ago. In one of those tomes I was reading." Draco stops.
"Belle Darling!" McGonagall yelled. "I expected better from you. I raised you to be better. Why is Ms Bulstrode in the hospital wing like that?"
Draco blinked. Did he want Potter since years? Was it Potter for him all along? Well, he did go way up and above to make his life miserable. And to get his attention, he won't lie about that. He also does remember being more comfortable dating gryffindors like Woodie and McLaggen. And Christian definitely would've been a Gryffindor if he were a wizard.  Draco remembers hating Patil twins, Chang and Weaslette especially more. Huh. Looks like Draco always did have a thing for Potter.
Draco goes crimson. Beg for it. He really does want it, it's just that when he really is having sex, like he is now, it becomes difficult to ask for what he wants. He used to ignore what he wanted when he used to get abused but that's because he knew there was no point. This, it's different. Christian made him do it sometimes as well. This sets his skin on fire, he so wants it.
"Is that why we keep finding things we need? Like the bell peppers and onions yesterday? I just thought you brought them when you came back after meeting Nott and Bulstrode."
Malfoy blushes and walks straight into the washroom. Its another thirty minutes he spends in the bathroom, Harry lays awake on his bed. When he is finally out of the bathroom, Malfoy gives Harry a long stare.
I chose green apple to give to Luna because I knew that food will go unsuspected. Everyone knows I can eat all the green apples in the world. She huffs and leaves. I make sure she has actually left and run to the cells.
Potter bends his head down, Draco dutifully tits his head as upward as possible. Potter kisses his forehead, his nose and Draco suddenly feels the spicy mint in his mouth as Potter places a wandless and wordless cleaning charm on both their mouths. It's such small things that make Draco even more giddy. Potter always does these small little things for him. Like this cleaning charm, knowing Draco hates kissing with morning breath, making sure Draco has breakfast every day, sleeping on the side of the door, knowing it makes Draco feel safe, such things. And he does them with almost no thoughts, he does them naturally. Potter kisses Draco slowly and Draco opens his mouth to let Potter deepen the kiss. He is still smiling. When Potter pulls back, Draco bites his lower lip shyly. As soon as Draco opens his mouth to greet Potter morning, Potter shakes his head and Draco snaps his mouth shut.
Draco slowly gets the glamour charm back, hiding all the scars, all the wounds, all the ugliness. It is still there. He's not really got rid of it. He doesn't know if he will ever be able to get rid of them. The reflection that stares at him is mostly a lie. Its flawless and perfect as if most of his past never happened. The only truth about this reflection is the dark mark. The mark of being sold to the dark lord like a piece of meat. Just like his father sold him to so many others. He wears his top back.
The whole courtroom bursted in whispers as Potter walked towards the stand. Draco looked at him. He stand there, taller than he was before. Built a little better. He had muscles. His black hair all unruly and wild. His bronze skin shining. He looked powerful.
Harry can't stop thinking about it. 'When you've been getting this treatment all your life, you kind of get addicted to it.' It's what Malfoy had said. Has he been hurting his whole life? Harry didn't even want to think what had happened with Malfoy to make him believe his consent wasn't important. But he did. He thought about what happened with him that made him believe that whether he said yes or no was of no relevance. Something had happened that made Malfoy believe he can't say no. Almost like, he doesn't has the right to say no, or like he doesn't has the permission. Harry can't pay attention on the class. And how can he, when his mind is still stuck on the blond who is missing the clas? Who Harry gave an excuse for.
"She'll be here. She takes a decade to pack and she packs like she's permanently moving. Don't worry. She'll be here." Draco tried to reassure Ginny.
"I lost my hearing aids. I can't hear anything Theo. I don't know what to do. I can't find them." She sobbed.
The fight has started. All the death-eaters have managed to invade Hogwarts. We are all dueling with them. I fight those fucking death-eaters as much as I can. Lucky I haven't really shown anyone how good I am in defence.
"Blaise is brown skined and black haired. You were with him few times. That boy from Dumstrang as well. And the one from Bauxbaton. And that son of your father's business associate." Marina replied.
"Failed attempts. Because I couldn't kill to save my life. I'm a lot of things but a murderer is not one of them." Draco replies.
"If you win, and I say yes, how will I belong to you? I'm a Malfoy, Potter. I still belong to my father." Draco has to know.
Draco sees a glimpse of Potter before the bus halts in front of him, blocking the view. Draco freezes there, not climbing the bus, but also not doing anything else, not looking for Potter. As the bus leaves, Draco watches Potter half way crossed the streets, smiling and coming towards him.
"Now, I have fair idea of what not to do? I still have a list of things I found. We'll go through them now and tick them as yes, no and maybe. Alright?"  Harry asks. Draco nods again. "Remember, you can say no to anything you want. Do not say yes to what you don't want. Understand?"
"Just because you are comfortable going out dressed like a caveman, Potter, doesn't mean I am too." Draco replies and Harry again, groans.
"In between this, you casted few unforgivables yourself. You used Imperious Cursenon Katie Bell and Madam Rosmereta."
"Read it! It's a good book." Potter replied. Draco could only watch as Potter became a distant figure as the bus kept going ahead.
Draco moans as he walks and Harry smirks. Draco has had a difficult time controlling his moans while walking as the plug tortures his prostrate. And Harry is enjoying every second of it.
He looks at Draco, observes him. Draco bites his lips, that pretty blush hasn't left his cheeks once. He takes a bold step forward and nudges Harry's thigh with his cheek and the top of his head. Harry smiles at his confidence. He strokes Draco's cheek tenderly and gives a sigh.
