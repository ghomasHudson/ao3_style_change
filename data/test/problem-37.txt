Harry sat on the back steps and gestured to Draco to join him. Draco sat on the step below, and Harry tucked him firmly into his chest. Every exhale was shaky and warm against Harry's chest. Harry tentatively smoothed his hair, and Draco gave one big shudder and closed his eyes. It felt nice to thread his hands through Draco's hair, so he continued.
And Draco doesn’t want it. There’s nothing he can do with it now, he can’t keep suffering for someone who doesn’t want him. Even when that someone is standing right by his side as they walk to the hospital’s floo. Harry’s made his position on Draco clear when he asked for the divorce.
Draco presses Harry closer still, trying to get rid of any space between them, and repeats in his ear again and again until the song ends, “I love you.”
He’s grown accustomed to not being alone anymore, to having Harry always present, even when he’s not around.
"You’re left-handed. Stop switching your right hand under when you dive." Grace dove a few times under his supervision and smiled at him.
"Yes. Wood will be Vice-Captain," he confirmed. "I still need you. Even if you won't fly, I want us to crush Kenmare. Can I trust you with the playbook?"
"I don’t know why the house locked all the rooms last time. You can stay in the guest bedroom if you want. If you wanted to come in—" Draco cut back in with a few brushes of their lips then a more intense, searching kiss like they were already in Harry’s bedroom. It was freezing, and Draco’s hands were cold as they slipped under the hem of Harry’s jacket, but Harry didn't protest. He made a small sound and pressed into Draco like the last time.
Molly was so overjoyed I was going. She called upon generations of Weasleys to descend on the place for lunch. It ended up being only a few of her offsprings and in-laws — Ginny, Ron, Hermione, Bill, Fleur and Victoire, Percy and Oliver, even Andromeda and Teddy showed up — but it was too much for me.
Draco can’t blame the elf. The creature tries to take good care of them; he’s been doing that since before Harry's coma. Whenever Kreacher isn’t at home, Draco knows he was by Harry’s bedside. He figures it hasn’t changed now, since Harry woke up. He can’t bring himself to call the elf when Harry might need him more.
Going out became less of a struggle when I realised I needed a couple of days to recharge, after being around so many people, and when I started to respect that.
It gives Draco something to hope for every week, beyond the company. He knows she will always tell him something that isn’t in the papers if he eats three meals a day and goes out at least twice a week. His body is filling out again, and his skin doesn’t look as sickly as it did before.
So he focuses on himself for now. Despite the fact that his life is just a series of lonely days. Draco had been alone before Harry. He can certainly do that again.
It’s small, but it’s enough. He can picture Harry trying to write a letter to him and coming up empty. He can picture the amount of discarded crumpled paper on the floor. It doesn’t matter that it's only one question. Harry wants to meet him.
Harry shakes his head and takes Draco’s hand again. “No. It’s mine. Because I didn’t want to leave you alone, I couldn’t go. But you’re not alone anymore.”
"From the team? No. Outside of that? I don’t think it’ll be a problem," Harry said. He had walked this line before, and in any case, they banned the media from their hotels. No one worth paying mind would print anything worth repeating without evidence, and Harry had become an expert in not leaving evidence of his personal life.
"So one mark in his favour. His many faults include a completely insane way of distributing House points, and that he left Severus Snape in charge of children." Miles moaned. "That's what I don't understand. What was he trying to teach?"
“Yes, yes.” She waves a hand. “I’m really petty. Actually!” And then Julie finally lets go of Harry’s arm to clap her hands together. “I have a group of students looking for a model. This is your time to redeem yourself.”
There’s barely any disturbance in the grass where his body had lain. It’s as if he’s never been there at all.
Harry snorts, closes his eyes tightly, and pinches the bridge of his nose. “Your life isn’t worth it, Draco. For fuck’s sake.”
Draco purses his lips, containing a shy grin. The words tumble out of his lips so fast he can barely control them, and he whispers, “I miss you.”
"You never properly took possession of the house. It hasn’t ever known what to make of you. It’s not used to you or your magic."
"As I said previously, the spell is clever magic, superb security. It’s like the wards, but it recognises something deeper than that: lineage. Works with non-blood relatives. Fascinating stuff. Kleine from the Berlin School seemed to think charms like that are responding to your magic and how it is influenced by other people. Adoptive, marriages, blended families, it recognises it all."
“You must be Julie,” Draco barges in, still smiling and pointing at the dark-haired girl. Then, one by one he tries to name them from what Harry has told him over the last few months. “Mark,” he points his chin at the man who just spoke, who nods, and then turns to the other two, who also confirm when Draco says, “Hannah and Elio?”
He always waited until day two after the championship media circuit to think of something he could do in the offseason that would make him feel accomplished but not piss off his coach or his trainer. He learned better three years ago with the Running of the Bulls after the Quidditch World Cup. Coach Raul Jimenez had refused to look him in the eye for two weeks during summer training camp after the
Harry shakes his head. He looks hurt, and the look is not something Draco appreciates on him, mostly since
Luna had gone to the place a few times, and assured me it was all very harmless, albeit overwhelming. I trusted her word — I might have trusted her more than myself at that point.
Harry was still towelling off his hair when Draco arrived the next morning. He had learned messing with his curls never helped matters. Harry was dressed, at least, in a white Falcons t-shirt and a pair of black Cleansweep joggers he had gotten from their sponsorship package.
“Yes. I don’t know. I think so,” he stumbles against his words, raking a hand through his hair. “I think we can tell them apart most of the time.” Well, Draco can, but it might as well be because he already
It’s not, however, and he manages not to destroy everything he owns. He’s not repairing his room again or buying any new plates and mugs because of his destructive behavior. He goes to work, and treats Elle and his other patients with sepulchral silence, yes, but as a good healer.
Draco shakes his head. “It’s perfectly fine. I couldn’t sleep either.” A heavy sigh escapes his lips as he takes a seat on the table in front of Harry, ignoring the way Harry’s eyes follow his every movement.
“No way, Harry, look at you and look at him,” Julie complains, pointing broadly at Draco and apparently ignoring the whole of Harry. “He’s a med student for God’s sake, and he
However, when he opens Harry’s messages, he finds something he’s never seen before. The last one is from the last day Harry had been awake, and it had never reached the recipient.
Granger’s eyes spark. She nods. “Yes! Probably. The tree in Malfoy Manor was powerful. But where could he get more, if not from the most powerful tree of Wizarding Britain? He sacrificed Harry in the Forest to harness that tree’s power. But he didn’t expect Harry to be a horcrux. That he was killing part of himself, and for Harry to come back. It didn’t work with that tree because…” She gestures vaguely, trying to find the right words. “Maybe because Harry was a willing sacrifice, the tree must have felt it and held on to him, somehow.”
Draco touches his fingers to Harry’s heart, the thundering pulse beating under the skin. Harry is alive, warm and looking at him like Draco’s his entire world again. Draco is not sure he will survive this night without having his own heart combust inside his chest.
"Winston says he's not coming. So I ask him, then what the fuck are we doing? He gets all huffy. He leaves for his sister's place."
Harry fumbled it a few times before managing it. There was nothing visual to confirm, but Draco seemed to sense he was correct.
Draco is ready to answer all of her questions, knowing this difficult procedure isn’t something he can do without Elle understanding how it will work and the potential outcomes for it. Healer Cameron is by his side as he assuages each of Elle’s doubts with utmost patience, eyes trained on her and posture impeccably still.
Draco drinks the rest of the bottle alone, to the sound of their past selves dancing to their song and past-Harry’s words ringing in his mind again and again.
Hermione opens her mouth, but opts to not say anything before shrugging. Her shoulders slump down, defeated, as she rests both hands on the table. “It’s the only theory we’ve got so far. I believe it’s... I believe Harry’s connected to that tree.”
The way Harry says it makes Draco’s body pleasantly hot again, and the lunch is almost completely forgotten when Harry drops to his knees between Draco’s legs.
The Forbidden Forest does that to people, Draco realises, a shiver running down his body. It makes you feel alone, unwelcome, or maybe it’s just Draco who’s not welcome here, by Harry’s side. He stares at the spot on his arm; the Dark Mark is hidden by his sleeve. It wouldn’t be the first time magic perceived him as… less than worthy. With the way the forest dampens their footsteps, the dark trees close around them, and the thick canopy smothers their presence, Draco is sure he shouldn’t be here. But Harry keeps pushing on, quietly mumbling to himself things the forest engulfs before Draco can make what they are.
“To this day, I haven’t paid that bet,” Draco confesses to him one day, startling a snort out of Harry. He had taken the infamous bet with Julie when Harry was still in the early stages of his art class. It hadn’t been something Draco was extremely comfortable doing, but he wasn’t one to back out from a challenge, even when Julie stated clearly he’d have to pose nude to an entire class to win that.
If Elle is still standing and moving, it is because of her own willpower. Others would be attached to a bed after so many years of this kind of hurting. Draco only wishes the potions he gives her could do more than just ease some of the pain. But they don’t, and he doesn’t know how to help her other than make sure she’s somewhat comfortable while dealing with her condition.
Heart in his throat, thumping violently, Draco refuges himself in the guest room until his breathing calms down. They’ve been talking for months, touching for a few weeks. Why is it that the way Harry says his name leaves Draco like he’s about to have his universe tipped upside down?
"I vote for Baby, because of the cheeks," Sam said, reaching up to pinch said cheeks. Atty slapped his hands away.
"Well, in all fairness, they stole it first," Hermione said yesterday while looking at a small Goan wooden carving with its British Museum plaque still attached. Thieving from national Muggle institutions was not beyond the power of his house. It had gone away on its own, but somehow this was below the interest of the Ministry. A ministry that had chosen the slow and optional route for progress.
"What's the difference between what you pretend to be and who you are, if you pretend all the time?" Draco asked, frowning at him.
Draco knows the Forest is listening to him, and ignoring his pleadings. He knows Harry is here somewhere, despite the bond being nothing more than a faint pulsing connecting them now. He can barely feel the tug of the magic, Harry’s presence. It frightens Draco more than he lets himself be aware at this moment. So, he continues.
"I can’t be home for the renovations today, and I got short notice, so I figured I’d come see if you had anything for me to sign."
It’s Harry’s old phone. Small and bright red, much like Draco’s, except his is green. He never uses it anymore, not since Harry stopped replying years ago and it stayed forgotten inside his closet. It had been an easier way for them to communicate back then, and Harry always seemed to find it enjoyable to send Draco endless messages detailing his days.
"My stats are all publicly available if you want them," Harry said cheerfully and side-stepped him. Seamus was in the kitchen when he entered.
Harry said his hellos. Greg nodded back, which was a marked improvement. At this rate, by next Christmas, they might be all the way up to a handshake. The gathering was more subdued than New Year’s, but it was the same crowd.
Harry resorted to trying to get Pansy to contact Percy. Surely, as Deputy Minister, he must have some good ideas. He tried his best not to think about the fact that Pansy and Percy were dating, but an emergency was an emergency. Harry could still remember the awkwardness from the Weasleys the first winter they started dating.
"Not—the house knows I have a valid claim by blood. So I have to be more careful than usual until you claim it, so I don’t complicate matters further," Draco stammered through.
Harry had wondered, but they both agreed they could simply pretend they had transported a fully grown tree here, rather than wait for ten years to enjoy its functionalities. The possibility that they might not have all that time hung heavy in the air. None of them brought it up.
"You’re accomplished twice over, and you still act…" Draco trailed off. "Do you really not know what you look like?"
Draco takes so long to answer, Harry is already shaking his head and gesturing an apology with his hands.
The first thing he notices is the Tree of Life. It’s impossible to miss it. It’s as huge as all the gossips’ descriptions. Its trunk is thick and of a dark, almost black wood.  There’s ample space around it, as if no other tree dares to grow too close to it. Branches that look like veins draw patterns in the night, poorly illuminated by the moonlight filtering through its leaves. Shadowy roots slither across the ground beneath his feet, leading to a body lying motionless on the grass.
“Yes. It is,” Draco nods, uncertainty straining his features. This is something he had expected. Draco expects Harry not to want to live with the imposed bond, but it still hurts. “But I don’t know what would happen to you without my soul to attract yours. It’s too dangerous. I don’t want to leave anything for chance.”
They wrapped up in a half hour. Harry had to admit that he did look pretty good in all the photos she showed him. It was easy to see the sharp cut of the vee in his abs, the thick Quidditch thighs, the defined muscles of his biceps. He looked like he was contemplating murder in a few, but he also looked determined reaching for a practice Snitch. He also liked the one with him running his hands through his hair while leaning back and laughing.
“Coffee? Yes, you addict,” Harry snorts, shaking his head and leans against Draco’s table, watching as Draco takes a seat and raises an eyebrow at the two steaming coffee cups on the table. “From Serendipity. I know you love their coffee. Mia said hi.”
"The job will be done even if you think I am a—how did you once put it—'handsome but morally blank, stuck up ex-Death Eater who everyone forgave because he's useful'. My father disagrees with you on the useful part, for whatever that’s worth."
“I like it here,” Harry says finally, gazing so intensely at the picture Draco wonders if his intent is making the moment displayed in the photo disappear by sheer willpower. Then he adds, “I can feel your magic.”
“What have you done?” Hermione’s expression looks like a mix between anger and hope. Her best friend is awake again, after so long, and she must feel something other than suspicion. She seems wary, but Draco doesn't judge that. He expects it. She's the smart one, after all, and she didn't support his suicidal plan.
It was so uncanny that Harry gave a surprised laugh. The food came then, and Harry stood up and had Miles find a more suitable chair than his lap. Harry tried a few of the less fussy entrees and an oyster because Astoria insisted. He turned down the wine this time and had a pleasant chat with Millicent about the upcoming World Cup in Kyoto. Astoria chimed in with a few recommendations.
When the bill came, there was a round of polite arguing about who would cover what, but Miles elbowed them all out of the way and tossed a hefty bag of Galleons on the tray which promptly disappeared with a pleasant chime.
Harry caught him by the elbow and pulled Draco in close. The kitchen towel dropped out of Draco's grasp, forgotten. Draco looked very sweet like this, gazing at Harry. The nape of his neck was still damp, his cheek unshaven and lightly stubbled, waiting. Harry started with a tentative brush of lips; this kiss felt the same as last night. Then Harry cupped the back of Draco's neck and kissed him more deeply. He tasted faintly of the tea he'd been drinking. Draco coaxed his mouth open, and it was lovely devastation. He couldn't doubt there had simmering lust, not when Harry had him pressed against the counter.
"Hand me that letter opener in the first drawer. Be careful with the catch." Draco gestured carelessly at his art deco credenza. This must be his equivalent of a junk drawer, and Harry wanted to know if he could glean something from the contents, but he fetched a tacky-looking sword letter opener as directed. He spotted nothing more than odds and ends anyhow.
It was almost like praise. Harry preened a little. "If you want to come watch a game, you should. I can put you on the list at the Falcons VIP box."
, is wondering about whatever attraction exists between them. He tries to keep the smugness out of his grin. “It’s not that kind of attraction. This is all on you.”
“You’ve tried that before.” It’s clear that Healer Cameron is making a huge effort to keep her voice level. “It didn’t work. If you take her magic out completely, you do not know the consequences on Elle’s body.”
"Again, my sincere apologies for my overreaction. I think I should go. I will find a way to work on the rest in your absence," Draco said.
Pansy holds him tight before she makes him shower and shave. Draco considers going back to his cocoon of warm blankets when the song starts on the wireless, but he knows sleep will never come without Harry by his side as it hasn’t since Harry went into a coma, and he’s tired of lying in bed all day.
And, with a split second decision, Harry said, "Draco Lucius Malfoy." The wards glowed gold and then settled. "Since you’re working on the house, and I’m not sure how you’ve been getting here," Harry clarified. He still had the Floo restricted to calls.
His heart skips a beat. Then it clenches, knowing full well who’s on the other side of the door, and unable to bear the hope spreading fast. Magic ripples in the air, the bond tugs at him weakly as Draco mutters, “Come in.”
Draco’s heart does a loop in his chest, and the words tumble out of his mouth before he gets a hold of them. “Want to go to my place? It’s close.”
"Yes. Thank you, Harry." It was the first time she had used his name instead of Captain, and it felt like a gift.
” And as if to prove her point, she lifts her arms trying to reach for the sky, opens and closes her hands several times. “I can
don’t know all of what you did, where you went.” And most of what Draco knows, he only learnt through the time he spent with Harry in the After place.
If this weren’t Draco's home already, Harry would have memorised every detail to tell him like a scout spotting land ahead. It was very Draco. His office was in a similar condition to his car, aside from the shelves. A lot of his furniture was Muggle, some were discarded from other houses. Everything had a story. He could listen to Draco talk about them all afternoon.
Draco sighs, not as relieved as he’d like. Harry’s alive, but barely. His pulse is weak, faint, his heart is struggling to keep beating. The most concerning thing, though, is that he can’t feel Harry’s soul anymore. Draco can sense the magic radiating from the tree, and Harry’s own, but there’s no sign of their bond, no sign of Harry.
"Your arms," Draco said, his eyes darting up and down. If Harry flexed just a little, that was between him and the house.
Blaise stares appraisingly at Draco, eyes filled with mirth but something else, something more careful. “It’s good to see you,” Blaise says, finally, an arm resting on Draco’s shoulders as he drags him towards the entrance.
They stare at each other in silence for a second. However, before Draco’s uneasiness turns into laughter or tears, Mia drops a second mug of coffee in front of him. Black and steaming.
she’s written in her letter, Draco knows she means it deeply. He tries not to think of how she, too, didn’t reach out to him during those years, when crafting a second letter, then a third, then many more. He’s promised Harry he’d try and that’s what he’ll do.
Blaise rolled his eyes and began speaking loudly. The vehemence and the lingering anger he felt radiating from Draco left Harry more confused than before. Harry reached out and put a hand on Draco’s. Draco took it.
Her voice is soft, as she caresses his hair with the tip of her fingers. “Draco, it worked. Your plan worked. And he’s awake now, baby. He might still get his memories back, and if he doesn’t…”
"I’ll catch up on some of my other files. Research," Draco said. The last drawer held a tiny carved silver bottle with a Stasis Spell, and they both looked at it for a moment.
His letter to Harry had been short. He knows visiting their old home is something Harry’s been avoiding, but it’s also something that’ll have to be done eventually. That’s why, deep down, Draco had half expected Harry to respectfully decline. However, when the clock strikes eight, he hears three knocks on the door and soon after, Harry’s magic is spilling into his house.
Oxygen crashes in with a deep breath. A clank echoes in the bedroom when his wand drops to the ground. His hand is still burning though, where it’d touched the wood.
"Not like six more, but we both think Rose should have a sibling? And we shouldn’t wait too long," Ron said, a thoughtful look on his face. Ron crossed his arms, watching the broom drills with the same attentiveness he paid to a professional match. He must have been waiting for Harry to say something.
Harry, despite the smile on his face—strained, Draco notices—isn’t happy when their flat is swarming with people a few weeks later. Not because of the visits. Granted, he loves his friends and having Pansy, Blaise, Granger and Luna over is always bound to be fun. It’s the reason behind their meeting that has Harry bouncing  on his feet.
"If that’s why he did, he would know better than to say that was the reason, even to me," Harry said.
Harry clutched at his shoulder and came on the rug. Harry almost expected Draco to complain that the rug belonged to Charlemagne or something, but he just Vanished the stain with a flick of his hand.
Harry had forgotten that they were related. "He’s fine?" It came out more like a question than an answer, but she seemed satisfied nonetheless.
He feels pathetic, a delightful contentment fills his chest. It’s been a long time since he heard Pansy’s open laughter directed at him.
Fiona, the realtor, follows Harry’s sprint around the house with amused chuckles. She’s a young and very discreet witch—an important trait, what with Harry’s fame—who has been helping them with their search for the past months, showing houses both in Wizarding and Muggle London for them.
Draco agrees because he misses her and talking to her, despite the fatigue wearing his strength down. Luna has always been low-maintenance, and never been bothered by Draco’s silences during her interminable monologues. He usually misses half of what she says, but Luna never seems to mind it, not listening so intently to Draco herself when it’s his turn to talk his heart out.
Why should he? Just because Potter saved the Wizarding World—potentially the rest of the world as well—doesn’t mean he’s entitled to anything that Draco isn’t.
Draco hadn’t wanted to get her hopes up before he was certain. Though this is the first Elle is hearing about all of this, her reaction is nothing but the usual cold detachment the girl presents whenever Draco has news for her about her health, good or bad.
Speaking of, there’s a Falcons event on Sunday," Harry said. "I’d like it if you came. It’s just the players and their friends and partners at a pub we rent out. No media or anything."
This guilt isn’t something Draco can take away from Harry, though he wishes to. He doesn’t find much resistance, though. Harry nods in silence, seeming less worried about it as the old Harry had been. Harry leans in and mouths at Draco’s scars, lips wilfully tracing each line. A shiver runs down his spine, and he whines helplessly at each of Harry’s caresses.
"How closely do you follow Quidditch?" Harry asked. Draco shrugged. Harry took a chair and sat in it sideways.
"Someone give me a copy of his speaking points, please and thanks." Pansy sounded cheerful though she glared daggers at Harry once they were alone.
“Draco?” Harry says, and his voice carries with the waves, with the almost silent wind, low and distant.
He’s been here before. It had looked different when Draco had sacrificed himself to find Harry’s soul months ago. He remembers the beach, the mountains, the bridge. He remembers Harry’s inexpressive eyes staring back at him.
"Because I like Quidditch a lot, and everyone has to work. Next question." He wouldn't put it past Hermione to have taught her the concept of generational wealth so he was hoping for no more follow-ups from her.
shared past too much, and Harry never navigates their conversations in that direction. It’s fine, though, as long as they can keep talking. “But I haven’t talked to Julie in years. I don’t really think she remembers it anymore.”
, Draco’s mind urges him to say. He doesn’t. Instead, he dries and puts the cup in the cupboard and remembers their last day with a pang in his chest. “We had a fight, you know, your last day…” Draco murmurs. “I never forgave myself for the last things I said to you.”
. He wants to hear Harry, to let Harry’s moans of pleasure penetrate his skin and mark him. And never leave him.
reporter, striking right at the heart of Harry’s insecurities. It was all politics, but there was a time he was so good it would have never been a question. Now they could go for someone else talented but younger, less controversial. Playing for England in Worlds made him ineligible to play for any of the other regional Nationals teams to discourage poaching; right about now Harry wished he had gone out for Wales in 2001 instead.
Ron held his birthday at the Burrow as always. It was the last time Harry could relax going into the last stretch of the season. Some players were more lax, but Harry tended to be all or nothing. Halfway didn’t suit him for anything. He kicked up his feet and had too many ciders and watched everyone laugh and dance to the wireless without joining in. Ginny sat on the end of his lawn chair and nudged him hard with her foot.
Elle’s taut posture sags, head sinking into the pillow. “I know. I’m just tired.” Her voice is small, so small Draco has trouble hearing it.
"Miles delights in giving the most horrible gifts he can think of. Lean in close." Draco struck the pane lightly with the tip and it chimed, a pretty crystal sound with a depth Harry wasn’t expecting. Draco’s expression was nakedly pleased at Harry’s wonder. He showed Harry the intricate weaving of his personal wards he had done. Constantine, black, fluffy, and proud, wound his way around Draco’s legs, sniffed at Harry’s proffered hand and then bolted under the couch.
“Do you think...” Draco starts, voice a little rasp. “Do you think it’s because of the tree that Harry’s like he is now?”
"So," Harry said. Draco was still looking around, like he remembered what it had looked like before Sirius’ parents had passed away. Draco could probably guess.
"I didn’t think you owned anything red," Harry said by way of greeting. He nodded at the jumper that had taken residence on the piano bench. Draco dropped half a dozen books midway in the air and caught them with a flick of his wand milliseconds before they hit the ground.
"Yes, Pansy Parkinson. I would like to think—that is to say, we are dating," Percy said. Harry covered his surprise by taking a long swig of water.
When Luna found me an hour later, seeming more distressed than I had ever seen her, I almost didn’t want to leave. But I knew I would, anyway. I didn't ask what had made her so anxious that night and she didn't offer.
Draco gave him a disdainful glare. He wore another pair of tight trousers, this time grey. Lighter than his eyes. Another billowing shirt in heather green. There was a glint of green in his left ear. A small emerald earring. Was he wearing an earring yesterday?
He tries not to look at it too much, at the windows falling to pieces, at the trees trying to root themselves inside the walls, at the dark tone they have taken since he left it to rot twelve years earlier. There’s nothing good this house can offer him now.
Draco gasps, darkness filling him with every breath, spreading in his veins like venom. His entire body burns, the sting in his eyes doesn’t subside when he blinks away tears. There’s nothing he can do to thaw the coldness in his bones.
“Are you sure you want to do this, Harry?” Luna’s fist stopped mid-air, the brush dangling from between her fingertips.
Neither of them bring it up again until Draco wraps up his appointment with Elle and he and Harry walk out of the room, leaving the girl resting on the bed.
"Ah, if you want to be serious, I better put you down," Ron said. He lowered Rose while she shrieked in delight.
They settle into a comfortable pattern for the rest of the day. Conversation comes and goes, mostly about unimportant things—Quidditch in the last twelve years, Muggle technology, movies Harry
As the night falls quieter and the buzz of the hospital dies down, their conversation drifts to other innocent topics.
Draco carries him back, and Harry only seems able to walk by himself again when they’re far from the forest. All the way back, only one thought floods Draco’s head… Why does Harry, of all people, have to go through that after everything he’s already sacrificed?
“There’s nothing you can say that’ll convince me Scorpius is a good name for a child,” Potter offers on one of these afternoons, lifting his head momentarily from his notebook.
Harry could do a few minor charms because game regulations penalised improper use of magic. Nothing showy. He could keep a cup of tea hot. He’d never seen the point in doing much more.
In the morning, he got halfway to Harrods before realizing he forgot to bring the sheets. He transferred the Muggle money carefully into a cash register with a discreet charm from his pocket and called it a day.
He devours his casserole with a goofy and undignified smile on his lips, and to Harry’s relief—and a flare of pride in himself—Draco forgoes another cup of coffee for the tea Harry’s brewed for him.
"No, you’re not. That’s outdated rubbish. If you fly well enough, the increased arm span outweighs the slight disadvantage from wind drag. The Seeker from Pakistan’s Worlds is at least your height if not taller."
His own grin grows as he cards his fingers through Harry’s hair and pulls him to a kiss, repeating endlessly into his lips:
He doesn’t want to share what little he has with this boy who’s got everything and everyone by his side.
Draco’s entire body shivers and his magic spikes excitedly with hearing Harry’s voice again, husky and not at all filled with rage like in that dreaded first time at St Mungo’s. He wants to hear it again.
"Do fuck off," Draco responded. They flew off for another round, and Harry let him catch the Snitch that time.
doing?” Draco amends, before she insists on the topic of Harry making out with other people. “Tell me something good.”
He wants to reach out and doesn’t know how. Not when he was the one to reject Harry, to distance himself.
Harry averts his gaze so quickly Draco is left wondering if he really saw that hunger in his eyes or if it was just his imagination. The bond, their magic intertwining, tells him it was not.
Pansy’s fingers delicately take the paper from him and he lets her. A second later, the heavy intake of breath from the girl and Blaise’s muffled “Whoa” resound in the room. Draco, though, is left staring at his own fingers and the void that message left there.
Harry says nothing else as he passes three pages of pictures before stopping and poking at a new one. In the picture, they’re both lying on the grass under the shade of the creamy, white flowers of their dogwood tree in the house's garden, during one spring. It’s motionless as it’s Muggle, but Draco can almost feel the breeze and warmth of the memory prickling his skin.
Luna holds Ruby in her lap, and Draco stares at them both with a soft tug on his chest. He fully believes he wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for Luna and her insistence on his mental health. He probably wouldn’t have met Harry again. They wouldn’t have fallen in love like they did. He wouldn’t have these friends he calls family.
"I need…" Harry said. And it turned out there wasn't anything Draco wouldn't give him that Harry needed. He pulled Harry back upright—Harry, who was unused to anyone even
Harry’s nod is relieved, the smile he directs at Draco so bright and joyous, there’s almost nothing of the void Draco’s sure he had witnessed minutes before.
Percy took one look at Harry and said to Pansy, "Right, I’ll go for a walk, then." He put on shoes and bolted.
He wants to say yes. He wants to let go. He wants to move on and forget about Harry, about how Harry is finding it so easy to forget about Draco, when he’s dying a bit more each day.
"Good to see you’re getting along now," Andromeda said with a grin that reminded Harry that Teddy’s penchant for mischief went back more than one generation.
Harry’s friends have been bugging them about visiting their flat, but despite them living in a Muggle neighbourhood right now, their flat is too packed with magic to let them come.
Harry was halfway through his water bottle, so he just grunted when Coach slapped him on the back. He was happy though. It was always hard to spend every waking moment with his team and then go without seeing them for months.
Instead, he muttered, "There’s a spare key underneath the front hall mirror," and left the house to go to clear his head.
“There were only two wizards there. An old apothecary and his son.” Harry continues, unaware of Draco’s internal battle. “They helped me control my magic.”
Draco remembers Harry’s last morning so clearly that it hurts. A chasmic pain that never healed properly, that he can never truly leave behind. He remembers grabbing Harry's still body. As if crying and shaking Harry’s unresponsive body could bring him back.
And he can learn to do that. He can try. The only thing Draco knows for sure is that he won’t give up. Not now, not
“It’s just...” he starts, unsure how to phrase it not to sound too hopeful. “Harry comes to St Mungo’s almost every day, so I get to see him often.” He doesn’t tell them they talk now, a lot. It’s something Draco wants to keep to himself, like a little secret he knows Harry’s keeping too. And he ultimately doesn’t want to spoil it.
It’s hard to say where his own grief ends, where Harry’s begins. Their magic has always been like magnets, pulling them together. Now, however, the tendrils of their energies intertwine themselves as their souls claim each other in a bond Draco doesn’t know how to deal with. It pulses between them, reverberating whatever they try to hide behind hooded eyes and half-truths.
"They’re all from Hogwarts. You know all of them," Draco said with a flourish of his hand. Harry did not, but he nodded anyway. Millicent took pity on him. At least he could talk to her all night if all else failed. He never saw this side of her as his solicitor. For the most part, he saw her in a suit with her hair pinned up while she pored through his contracts. He liked the striped short sleeve, the bowtie, her hair messily parted to one side. She looked far more comfortable.
He’s doubly, triply, grateful that Hermione Granger accepted his apology and agreed to publicly support his initiative to lobby the Wizengamot to formally ban thestral racing.
Harry tapped his cheek with one finger. "You talked about bail bonds. Contracts. Adjudication. Torts." Harry had sat up with her while she revised for that one.
“She will die if I do nothing!” Draco snaps, finally turning to Healer Cameron. The strands of his diagnostic spell dissolve in the air, and even the magical dome seems to quiet down after his outburst. “The curse is draining her. If I don’t take the magic out now, she has no chance of living!”
Draco brought out a long, thin golden thread and silver needle. For all his flinching about the blood when he broke the plate, he didn't hesitate to prick his finger and begin weaving over the burn mark where Sirius' name had been blasted off of it.
Malfoy’s don’t change their minds, they don’t apologise, they’re always right. That’s what his father taught him. Draco hadn’t believed that after the war, when he stalked up to Potter and his friends, thanked him for speaking up in his trial and tersely apologised to them for how he behaved at school. But his mother still believed that outrageous mindset when they had parted, and the apprehension that she still might was what kept him from reaching out sooner.
Harry had somehow never connected the dots. He knew, of course. He had learned French because of the Continentals, after all. Luc was a French citizen but also allowed to play for Canada by language rights. The teams likely wouldn't ask, but he could get Barb to use her connections. He could play.
"When did you start thinking Draco Malfoy is decent?" Harry’s voice cracked under the stress. He had woken up in a mirror universe.
The next morning, Harry had run out of things to do and he was so bored he finally resolved to ask Draco if he could help with the house.
Harry leans over his body again, kissing him ever so softly, taking the fingers away. His lips are on Draco’s cheeks, his jaw, his neck. Draco can’t take it anymore. He doesn’t think he can keep living without
“I’m not going anywhere.” Draco lays their bodies back on the mattress and pulls the covers above their waist.
Harry tamped down his anger just a tiny bit more. He didn’t want to have come all the way to the Ministry for nothing. Mostly, he was too tired to contemplate what new bit of petty theft his house might have done in the meantime. It was currently cycling through art.
When Draco arrives at St Mungo’s, he’s dizzy with anticipation. The sobering potion barely does anything against the nerves keeping his limbs jittery and his eyes darting from one corner to the other.
In the study, the golden light was almost blinding when Draco said, "The heart of this home is the act of sharing with those we love."
The first thing Draco takes in when he opens his eyes is the cold seeping deep into his bones. He doesn’t move his fingers, but they tremble as a slow heat creeps into his body, awakening his numb limbs. Every fibre of his being feels dormant and forgotten as if not used for a long time.
He left it in Draco’s spot. And the next day, on the newel post, was one word scrawled on parchment:
He takes comfort in Harry’s promise and believes he’ll be back. He has to believe it. So he does what he can to make it better, to make it right.
The distraction, however, is welcome, and he feels his shoulders relax with the first gulp of his coffee. It’s not a cigarette, and much as he regrets admitting he’s smoking again, it’s enough for now.
He stands on what’d once been his favorite place in the world and now is just a pile of memories. Draco's held on to this house, to the memories of Harry for so long. He didn’t know how to let them go.
Harry doesn’t ask if he’s sure. He pushes in slowly, as if Draco might shatter. It fills him whole; the burning makes Draco’s vision blur. He wants more. When Harry’s completely inside him, he pauses, giving Draco time to adjust, and asks how it feels.
Who is he trying to fool, though? There’s something between them. Something that sends sparks down his spine whenever they touch, that makes his stomach flutter when Harry smiles at him. It’s not the bond, and it’s not Draco’s memories of their past.
He’s still shaking, and he’s still afraid of having done something irreparable, but this is why he’s here, anyway; to understand his mistakes, his fears, his boundaries.
“Welcome to PRTND” a man at the door stated, and when he opened it, there was nothing but a wall of translucent blue energy between us and the muffled noises from the interior.
“We both know he won’t,” he says instead of what he actually thinks. Harry won’t get his memories back. And then what?
Draco laughed bitterly. "Oh, as long as I married a pure-blood and produced an heir, I don’t think they would have cared. They would contort themselves into pretzels to justify it to everyone. I think they would have let me marry Theo if push came to shove. At least he's a pure-blood. They just didn't want me to disagree with them. Being gay was a horrible disappointment on top of everything else."
In response, there was an uptick of events to take advantage of. Harry found himself on a near ceaseless march of galas, sponsor events, award ceremonies, and ribbon cuttings. Barb cut them back to only what was essential and still Harry was at training as often as he was in some stupid manor or castle or Grand Wizarding Hotel.
It seemed to. Rooms started popping into existence. Harry was set spindrift when he opened a door to a ballroom instead of his bathroom, and then an indoor courtyard where he thought the linens were. He stood frozen for a moment, sun shining on his upturned face, the warm, orangey-red of light through closed eyelids. It reminded him of an ancient agora he had visited in Wizarding Athens with Ollie at their first World Cup in 2001, draped in overgrown olive trees. Oliver had complained the whole time about it being a waste of flying time, but took as many pictures of Harry as he wanted.
"Another save! Falcons Keeper Oliver Wood has been pulling off miracles. Seriously beautiful flying here, Jim. Anyone facing Scotland this Worlds will have their work cut out for them. I can’t believe how this team has come together—"
"Stay over. You can stay," Harry said. Draco agreed. They stumbled over the threshold just as Harry roused the presence of mind to say, "Nott was a bit possessive of you."
"You’re not getting curse damage on my watch." Harry felt a pang of guilt. After all, it had been some weeks ago that he had been pushing Draco to finish as soon as possible. "There’s nothing in this house worth hurting yourself over."
Draco looks up, poking Harry in the ribs. “I can’t believe you, Potter! Your place is double the size of mine. We could be hanging here this whole time.” Draco rolls his eyes with a snort, rummaging through the box and pulling out a pair of maroon sandals with at least fifty straps attached to it. “Where did you get these things?”
The underwear Draco’s thrown around reminds him of how Harry loved when Draco took them off himself.
Harry’s not shy, though he seems a little uncomfortable. He walks around the room, perusing the furniture he helped Draco pick years before. It doesn’t seem to escape Harry’s attention the way the room was made to be cosy, and he hums as he takes in the beige coloured walls, most of them covered either with pictures of them with friends or shelves with books and little trinkets they had collected during their life together. The fire is burning in the hearth, casting shadows on the wine-red rug on the floor. Two maroon upholstered couches sit in front of the fire, facing each other, and between them rests a small wooden table. After his studio, this used to be Harry’s favourite room of the house. Draco joked it had probably something to do with the amount of red in here.
Harry certainly would have preferred the version of events where Dumbledore mentored him by telling Harry that he would enjoy drag brunch more than nightclubs and to not do party drugs.
“Harry, I want you inside me,” he says in a hushed voice, the words almost getting lost in the night. Draco wants Harry’s bruising grip on his skin again, Harry filling him with his body, his magic. The bond quavers and stops, subdued by Harry’s touch, then flares alive with love.
“Harry?” Draco calls a few times, crossing many cabins with closed doors. He tries opening the first ones, but when they don’t budge, Draco just keeps following the corridor.
Draco forcefully did not encourage that line of thought after their divorce. But when the news is rubbed in his face that Harry is, indeed, trying new things, there’s no point in denying the horrible feelings Draco’s has brewing inside.
"Should a rookie have replaced a veteran? Should the Falcons have perhaps invested in a more seasoned player?" Lee Jordan asked before the next match. He framed questions like this in terms of tactics and strategy, but Harry bristled all the same.
He spent a pleasant few days with his friends and settled in on December thirty-first to stay home. It was about ten pm before he felt the wards shift and heard ‘Harry?’ from the hallway into where he sat by the fireplace.
The year before, he had tried learning French, which went less well, but he could take some international press questions without the translator when he was called up for Nationals, even if he sounded like a toddler when he responded. At the time, he learned he was eligible to play for Cote D’Ivoire in Worlds and the Union of Africa’s Continentals too, because of a great-great-great-grandmother, so it seemed like it might help. The media lapped up his new language skills, which Harry did not give a fuck about, but Falcon Media Relations did.
Draco risks a glance at his face, relieved not to find pity there, just a peacefulness he’s never really known Harry to have.
And then Granger’s hair is bursting in the room, followed by the girl herself. She scans the kitchen, flinching back when she finally takes in Draco’s presence.
"For us, it's just good to have Rosie somewhere where she can't take apart half our house. We still don't know how she broke the clock or did the cutouts with Hermione’s law textbooks." They both winced reflexively, remembering the expression on Hermione’s face at the time. Harry was happy to hand over an absurd amount of Galleons to replace the text. In general, Ron didn’t care much about material things, but Harry had felt as if someone had come in and chopped all of his brooms for firewood.
Draco sighs heavily, cutting in with a shake of his head. “I know. But just. Not yet.” Whatever she means. Either to search for help, or to try to get out, or
He tucks the violin back in its case, and by the time he’s back to Harry’s side on the couch, Harry has his mouth open, words on the tip of his tongue, but he doesn’t seem too forthcoming with them.
Harry rarely felt the urge to make someone understand what his life was like. Either they understood or they didn’t. But for some reason he wanted Draco to understand him.
Teddy laid on his back to see better and Harry and Draco followed him without question. Their heads bent closely together on the ground, Harry was aware of how near they were.
In the end, it’s Draco who falls in love with Mango, their new dog, and monopolises him whenever he’s at home. Harry and Noir—the black cat that won them over at the shelter—snuggle like they’ve known each other forever.
"Russian is better for complex defensive wards, and they don’t translate a lot of their texts. I can read it, but I speak it like a Ukranian peasant," Draco said. Harry snorted, and Draco didn’t even do a good job at looking affronted.
Draco paused. "This didn't begin as a magical home. It became one. But granted, it is more complicated than that."
Draco plasters a smile on his face. “No. Let’s stay. Buy me another drink and pretend to be my boyfriend for the rest of the night,” he asks, and Blaise happily obliges.
The feeling of fear and anger never leaves, and Draco’s so hopeful. He’s sure they come from Harry. He doesn’t ask Harry, though, what is it that’s pulling him away from Draco. Instead, he reaches for the thin line of the bond between them, of their magic, and pulls as hard as he can, trying to keep Harry here.
Draco’s been relying so heavily and for so long on the certainty that... Well, he isn't exactly certain. It’s hard picturing his hopes now as they seem to make even less sense than his actual life.
Draco gets up, ignoring his protesting limbs, watching as Pansy starts a series of diagnostic spells upon Harry’s quiet body. His eyes follow the strings of golden light coming off from the tip of her wand, circling Harry’s body, surveying his state after a 5-year-long coma.
Granger, taking in the silence, raises her head to meet Draco’s eyes, suddenly devoid of colour. She gives him a soft grin and nods.
He darts from one room to the next, clearly trying to keep his composure, but failing abysmally. Draco doesn’t mind. He enjoys watching Harry’s excitement. He
Once Astoria blew out the candles in a cherry torte, Harry shifted over to the Slytherin girls while Luna and Draco were talking intensely in a corner. Draco caught him looking and winked. Harry was both pleased and embarrassed.
Draco sits down, mouth watering and stomach rumbling loudly from starvation. No point in pretending he isn’t hungry now.
"Ah, I forgot. Why would you be familiar with that nonsense? Pure-blood families used to run a legal notice in the paper if someone was officially disowned. It doesn’t go so far as to deny you the use of your name, but it stops you from accessing vaults, using family accounts at shops, or visiting their property. Most families, even in my day, handled it more privately. Like with the Parkinson girl."
George looked like he was considering it, his face twisted with a mix of rage and hurt that was uncomfortable to witness.
“It was never my intention,” Harry apologises, once he stops chuckling. “I promise, if I had a say in the matter you’d be one memory I would’ve kept.” He winks at Draco, and all of them pretend it doesn’t sound as sad as it is.
He reins it in instead, flashing a grin at Harry when he turns again and looks over at Draco. His knees buckle under the intensity of the stare, but soon Harry’s turning away once more, his eyes entranced by the moving picture of their past happy selves.
Despite being terribly mortified about his meeting with Harry weeks prior, Draco still goes to Serendipity. He figures the press, opinionated as they are, will eventually find where he lives and the places he attends regularly, so he should enjoy it while his peace lasts. Still, Draco hides his face under a grey hat and sunglasses when he does so.
“I don’t see why not. It’s supposed to be simple. I’m in love with you and I’m pretty sure you love me too. You said so yourself. Were you lying?”
"Well, Draco is very good at what he does. I’ve been trying to recruit him for a housing rehabilitation project for years now." Hermione rolled her eyes at Harry’s expression. "I’m married, I’m not blind."
“He’s awake,” he repeats, trying to soothe his own frail nerves, and stares at Pansy. She is still sitting in the same place, preening at her achievement.
They were only visible when Harry let them be. The magic in the stars pulsed at Draco's touch with a gorgeous warmth. They would be twinkling now.
Over the next few weeks, it seemed like this truce might be longer lasting than their last one. Most days Harry found cups of tea cooling on the staircase and notes left for him from Draco, but they were more personal and chatty. Harry enjoyed reading these missives after a long day at training or a match depending on the day. He would come home, pick the notes off the bannister, and fill up his large water bottle. Then Harry would lounge in his new larger bed to read them and shove the little neat square of parchment into his bedside drawer when he was done.
Draco’s moved to his third box when he fishes a cookbook from it and his stomach rumbles loudly at the sight of a plate with beef on the cover. It’s probably time for lunch, he considers, glancing at the window. The absence of curtains lets the strong sunlight bleed into the room, bathing it in heat despite three cooling charms.
Pansy gives him bits of information on Harry every time she comes over. He wants to pluck everything he can from her, he needs to know all of it. But after he burst into tears the first two times she tried to tell him what was going on, Pansy decided it was better not to overwhelm him with too much information at once.
Harry shakes his head and faces Draco, chuckling amusedly. “How will you attempt to control me, Healer Potter?”
He needs to get out of here. But he also needs to stay, to never take his eyes off Harry’s now fading grin again, and to touch him, and to embrace Harry in his arms and never let him go.
"Everyone knows it's me you have the problem with. It’s always been me. Don’t look at her, look at me," Percy snapped. George did turn his head then.
They crushed the Kestrels 250 - 40 with Harry pacing by the bench next to Coach the whole match. It would have felt better to play, but it was better than nothing. They had a lull until the next three away games, so they took to their pub and celebrated.
It was so immediately transparent that Andromeda had been keeping their visits separate that Harry was embarrassed.
Harry rolled over after a few minutes to face Draco. Sweaty hair curled in his eyes. Draco might look the most appealing when he was this loose-limbed, sleepy, sated creature.
"Speak French in the scrum for me, will you? You’re so handsome and useful," Pansy said, patting his cheek. "Go tell them something nice to make up for
Harry let her herd him upstairs. His last glimpse of Draco was his back to them, unmoving, by the entryway.
“You didn’t assume,” Draco rushes to assure him. “I… I just.” He takes a deep breath, closes his eyes and searches for strength in his own magic to say what he needs. “You need to know I can’t be just one more. I won’t share you, Harry. If we do this, it means…” Draco sobs, wet grey eyes meeting green. “I want you so badly. I love you so much.”
Harry is not asking him to move in, Harry is proposing they, together, find a place they can share, a place that’ll have both of their approval, a place that’ll be
“We’re moving,” Harry mutters under his breath, when he notices Draco’s gaze skimming over the hoard of books and parchments.
“They didn’t, back then. We tried Muggle medicine for a while, to help you sleep.” Draco inhales deeply, forcing the smile to stay on his face. This is good. This is better than rage or indifference. “I’m sure Pansy can prescribe some if you’re—”
"What kind of a question is that? As my boyfriend." Harry's heart was already starting to race in anticipation of an argument with the tense way Draco held his body.
to get better, to disentangle himself from his past prejudices and the obsession with Harry Potter. He doesn’t want Potter here; he doesn’t want him to see what should be only Draco’s.
Draco chuckles, but his laughter is too hysterical for Harry not to notice there’s something wrong. Green eyes blink open in the night. Harry asks, “What’s wrong?”
Draco doesn’t ask if Harry keeps having those now, he’s not sure he wants the truth. Instead, he only nods, forcing a wan grin on his lips when the memories assault his head. “Yes. It was... a difficult time.” Desperately trying to save him, to be with him, watching him slip further, spending sleepless nights worrying whether Harry would be alive the next morning. Willing the memories away, Draco tries to quell the emotion with a deep breath. “But, Harry, dying and finding your soul wouldn’t have worked on its own. I... I wasn’t sure your soul would stay here, after being detached from your body for so long.”
You didn’t wait to touch me this time; you made the first move, and I didn’t fly from your fingers. Your skin was warm, and familiar, and meant hope.
"Speaking of plants," Harry said. "I’ve got a new courtyard. Would you want to come look? Not sure what to do with it, and I don’t recognise the plants."
Julie says they’re evading her, trying to get out of paying their bet. Draco has no intention of paying, if he’s honest. It’s not his fault that he lost it. Not that he’ll let the truth out. He’s been too pleased about Harry’s sudden and rare spark of jealousy to be more concerned about their little punt. But he wouldn’t prevent Harry from having his friends over, either.
He never actually believed St Mungo’s would accept his request to study there to begin with. Draco has taken a year of Muggle med school, considering it to be the closest he could ever get to fulfill his desire of being a Healer. It definitely helped increase his respect for Muggles, to see what they go through while studying to be a doctor. It’s been one of the most challenging things he’s ever done, but he enjoys every minute of late night study sessions and surprise quizzes. But St Mungo’s accepted him, and now Draco’s terrified of going back to Wizarding London, even though that’s what he wants.
Hermione is halfway to the door when it opens again. Luna comes out, closing it behind her before Hermione reaches for it, her lips pressing into a thin line and her face creasing softly in a grimace. Her gaze darts between the three of them, stopping at Draco, and he
"I dare you to say it again," Sam said to the same Chaser that had hit Harry. Harry could only imagine what Baddock would have had to say to rile up the famously unflappable Falcons Chaser.
He feels his own magic as well as the bond’s trying to keep the cold out, esconcing him in warmth and comfort. It’s odd how something that feels so good can be so exhausting. He knew bonding his soul to keep Harry here would be difficult, but he had hoped Harry would be by his side in this venture. No such luck.
"Because you don’t need it," Harry said. He was familiar with the feeling, and Draco appeared to be doing all right for himself. Harry wondered if Draco ever had to sell something he loved. His home was beautiful, certainly, but it also felt like Draco loved it. Loved it like it was his, because Draco took care of things he loved.
“I know exactly what I’m getting myself into. Or you thought I didn’t know the Golden Boy would come with a lot of drama in the package? I’m not about to let you go because some dark curse wants you.” He feels the certainty in his words before it fully takes hold. “I’m going to break it. And you’re not going anywhere.”
Weasley’s eyes are wide and they travel unashamedly across Draco’s body, and then the kitchen, and back to something behind him in the living room.
Draco raises a questioning eyebrow. “It died because of Voldemort’s dark magic. I already know that—”
"Authorised visitors. Hermione Jean Granger-Weasley, Ron Bilius Weasley-Granger, Rose Jean Granger-Weasley, Edward Remus Lupin, Andromeda Tonks, Victoire Weasley."
Silence descends over them for a split second, before the three burst into bitter laughter. Draco finally stares at his friends, and his laughter slowly and quietly morphs into tears. Pansy holds his hand and Blaise just stays there in silent companionship.
He dropped by for some post-dinner time with Teddy. When he was younger, Harry read him bedtime stories, but at ten years old Teddy was the one telling him stories of his day.
The Mediwitch follows him in, talking behind Draco and over the buzz of the magical dome surrounding Elle’s body. “We’ve tried stabilising her, but none of the previous treatments are working. It’s like… The curse is even stronger now, it’s rejecting every procedure.”
"What did EuroQuidditch call you once?" Stella asked. She was grinning wickedly, without a doubt awake now.
He breathes in and out, experimentally, and basks in the sharp feel of the fresh air on his tongue, rejoicing in being alive again. In being
Harry’s first time seeing a world without war, without so much death and fear, his behaviour is justified.
"I don’t have the connections with the old families if you want to use this to become a bigwig in the League when you retire. I’m Muggle-born," Barb said bluntly. "I am a small-time agent with a handful of athletes in smaller leagues. You would be my most high profile client by far."
"Both your teams have the most money in the league, so buying your merchandise is not as meaningful to your clubs," Ron started.
When he’s finally alone, Draco gathers himself on his couch. By the centre table stands the bottle of his 1996 Barolo he has been saving for years, and a letter he started writing after Serendipity.
"There’s no need for this," Draco insisted. He had removed his hand from his pocket and, thankfully, it looked normal. "It will heal."
Harry’s smile is crooked. Draco has noticed it before, but never actually considered it until now. He hadn’t thought about the slightly skewed curve of Harry’s nose, or how full his lips are, or how messy are the curls that frame his face, or how his eyes glint a bit golden under the sunlight.
"Then Oliver Wood came over from Puddlemere." Draco was clever enough to connect the dots on his own.
more, the bond does too. And his magic, that missed Harry’s so much it seems like only now it’s become alive again. He kisses Harry as if it’s their last day. And as far as Draco knows, this might be.
Harry is crying, even though he can’t move the muscles of his face yet, after sleeping for so long. Draco dries a stray tear with his thumb, a smile tugging on his lips.
Draco is invited to come back. He's not sure if he will, but he promises to think about it. It’s good seeing Marvin again and looking at that part of his past, seeing it's not as bad as his mind paints it to be. But Draco’s not eager to go back to that. This is a closed chapter of his life. He just needs to convince himself that Harry is one too.
Harry couldn't even manage a 'Yes, Coach'. He just nodded and tried to forget the ghost of Draco Malfoy that was haunting him. It was a countdown to the finals at this point.
"You never used to bring people you were dating to Falcons stuff," Stella said sometime later in the evening. "Then you show up with him."
“I’m sorry I vanished like that, but I… I can’t be in crowded spaces.” And after that, everything else spilled out like water running down on a waterfall. I talked about how the noise hurt me, how I was detached from everyone, how people sucked my energy, how hard it was for me having to deal with physical contact, how I was broken since the war and had no way of fixing it. I wasn’t the same Harry they were familiar with. I wasn’t normal.
“Like fire on snow,” Draco replies, his limbs melting away. Harry’s magic fills him. “Like you’re burning my insides out. Like you’re living inside me.”
With the turn in the weather came some welcome changes. Draco left him notes. But sometimes he waited around until Harry was home from training, and they chatted.
Luna has recently announced she wouldn’t be working so closely with Draco and Pansy anymore, for she’s decided to specialise in children. Draco and Pansy, both undertaking the curse-damage specialty, will be at least two floors away from her. Not that it had been a surprise, but Draco will miss being close to her every day. They can still have their usual coffee breaks, Luna had said, and he agreed.
Harry watched a pretty script spell out Mr Fleamont Potter and Mrs Euphemia Potter, Wedded August 3, 1924. They beamed in greyscale from the plate, and his grandfather gave his grandmother a kiss on the cheek while she laughed. Harry couldn’t describe the feeling that arose in him. This plate in Draco’s hands had belonged to his family. Someone, perhaps a relative or a house-elf or his parents, had packed these up carefully and stored them away.
Draco should have said it wasn’t Harry’s fault, none of it was. That they could take the photo down, take new photos, ones that represented what they were at that moment. Instead, when the anger boiled inside him, he said, “It’s
Harry’s presence, his fears, his doubts, his loneliness, but also his curiosity of the world. Draco wants to be with him for all of that, but he settles for  watching from afar.
Draco rolls his eyes, waving a dismissive hand. “She wasn’t very supportive of my changing, especially the part where I said I didn’t want to marry a good pure-blood girl and continue the Malfoy lineage.”
"I don’t think her wife would agree. Also, aren’t you and Luna…" Harry trailed off. He didn’t know what was going on with Luna and Ginny. No one talked about it, but sometimes Luna was around and sometimes she wasn’t, and Harry thought those things had nothing to do with whether they were together.
“I wish they could see I’ve changed, but I understand they don’t have to, and they might never.” He turns to Potter again, and the way their magic tries to pull each other is maddening. “Still, I will apologise and do everything I can to be better.”
His flat is only two blocks away, but by the time they finally reach Draco’s place—purple painted wood, in a hall with dozens of monochromatic doors—they are completely soaked.
The next day at dinner, Harry decided to drop in at Andromeda’s for something to do. Unlike Molly, she fussed over Harry in a way he enjoyed. But when she answered the door, her voice was subdued.
Draco tries to comprehend what Harry’s going through and how this is such a new world for him. He’s doing his best to be supportive and understanding. He has to, or he’s going to go insane with wanting something he’ll never have again. Something that maybe was never his in the first place.
“I...” Draco tries, but his voice cracks and he has to start again, “I’d have done worse if I had gotten the chance.” Even if it pains him now, Draco knows it’s true. Had he got the chance, Harry would probably be in worse condition. He wasn’t a good person back then. He had tried to hurt Harry repeatedly and had managed it in a few of those times. Draco was a lost boy, yes, but that is no excuse for what he did and he’s thankful every day for his own lack of power and courage that prevented him from accomplishing more evil deeds.
, Harry had said, a week earlier, knowing enough about Draco’s hectic schedule that he’d need some time to organise his hours in order to fit the new appointment.
"It was about the war in that they could have saved us some trouble and thrown us all in Azkaban." Her tone was light and dismissive.
The mist he had seen before has returned, and it stalks his steps as a silent companion. Draco keeps walking for far longer than should be possible until he finds one open cabin after what he can swear were a hundred cars.
Draco tries to hide the way his stomach churns. He doesn’t want to say it out loud, but he does. “Yes. It’s... well, my tree died during the war. The entire property is dead now.”
Harry hugs him back, but his voice is empty, untrue, when he says, “I’ll see you on the other side, Draco.”
Luna hums happily at Draco’s side and none of them bring up the fact that he’s, in fact, divorced at the moment. And hopeless. He doesn’t feel all that much better right now, but he knows what Marvin must see in him.
When Healer Cameron’s horse Patronus barges inside his living room, Draco is almost so lost in thought and so drunk he thinks it’s his mind's playing tricks on him at first.
“Draco,” Elle repeats, closing her eyes again with an agonisingly slow motion. Her tone is soft, though it sounds pained. “It’s okay, Draco.”
“Draco, listen to me.” Elle stops, turning and staring at him directly, both hands on his shoulders. “This is
So, predictably, the game got nasty. From the first whistle, there was taunting and pushing from the Arrows players. The winds were high, buffeting players this way and that. Harry had a bad feeling about the whole thing. Harry was trying to focus on finding the Snitch and was jostled by Malcolm Baddock, one of their Chasers, with a nasty smirk.
“Of course they are. You saved their arses, Harry. The least they can do is stalk you endlessly.” And Draco’s not nearly as irritated by this as he should be. Reading the papers allowed him to see  photos of Harry and know of his whereabouts sometimes, so that has got to be a silver lining.
Harry talks, and it all seems to change around them. The white shifts to the deep blue of the night sky, but it’s calming and comfortable. Time does feel odd, Draco thinks. He could have been listening to Harry’s voice for a few minutes or hours or days.
A weak “Sorry,” escaped my lips, as I slumped against a wall in the alley, my back sliding down the solid concrete. Tears wet my cheeks. It had been
It was the same, as Harry had asked. But, on one wall, Draco pinned all the photos, and another book was bound on the desk. Harry flipped it open to a letter dated July 2, 1972 and signed
"Any closer to a working prototype of the Weasley clock, Ronald?" Draco asked. His pasta, at least, looked edible and Harry eyed his plate with envy. Ron looked surprised to be asked anything first before launching into a brief explanation.
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry caught Teddy in motion. He had somehow fallen face first off his broom onto the grass, but by the time Harry got there, Teddy was grinning.
"Where do I find someone who specialises in house magic? Is that even a job?" Harry reached for a biscuit. Blaise slapped his hand away.
"Apparently he’s the only one who can fix this house thing, according to Percy, Hermione, and everyone else I’ve asked. But he’s said no."
“Draco!” He hears, followed by a series of the same anxious knocks. “Draco, I know you’re there. Open the door!”
Draco blinks a few times, and lets his hands fall before Harry catches them. Is it Draco’s fault that Harry’s trapped here? Harry didn’t leave, because… Draco hadn’t wanted him to?
And it must show on his face, for even Elle pats him on the shoulder when Draco tries to cast a diagnostic spell on her. She’s one of his long-term patients, one of the cases he was assigned right after he stopped being Harry’s Healer. Her curse, allegedly unbreakable, settled inside her bones, slowly shutting down all of her body movements. She is cold and quiet, and always says she’s learned to live with her own demons, despite his insistence on trying to break her curse. She’s too young to have to live with that.
The sentence won’t stop echoing in his mind, a heavy weight chaining his limbs to the ground, burying him in barren land.
“You look like shit,” Draco says, kneeling to pet the stray on the head. The animal purrs contentedly, tilting its head back to grant him better access to its neck.
Draco doesn’t register exactly when his body falls to the ground, when everything goes blank around him. When he opens his eyes again, all he can see is white blotched by a thick, bright mist. This is a numbness he’s more accustomed to than he’d wish.
"No, you're quite right," Pansy said. She smiled but there was something of a hint of forced openness as if she was baring her neck for a blade. A hot flash of shame went through Harry. Even years later, the war was still present in every interaction.
He must not have seen Harry because Draco tilted his face up to the skylight as if to face the house. "Oh, don’t you get cheeky with me. Just because you’re happy to see him doesn’t mean you’re welcome to strip the gardens bare.
The Healers and Mediwizards scurry out so fast that the buzz of the dome around Elle is suddenly smothering the newfound quietness.
Even Kreacher becomes a source of comfort to him. Through the elf, Draco finds out Harry refused to stay at the Burrow because of Fred Weasley. Or, more accurately, the absence of Fred.
"Of course. Twenty years ago, there were no openly gay athletes in Quidditch. Gwenog Jones had to marry her wife in Malta. No one used to come out before they retired. Fans regularly used slurs in chants."
Draco had been feeling Harry slipping from the day Harry woke up. He hadn’t let himself believe the time they had together to be borrowed time. Harry had to be back for good. And Draco hadn’t known what to do. He still doesn’t. Except trying to tap into the bond, as guilt tugs his chest. Nothing answers back.
Draco approaches them in a few steps, ignoring the smug grin Elle gives him. “What? No. Never, Harry. It’s my favourite song. I like that you like it.”
Draco’s not done trying. He can do more, he knows this. He’s sure there’s a way out. There's a cure. There has to be.
Their breaths come out ragged. Harry pulls away, taking a deep gulp of air. Draco doesn’t let him go far, hungrily chasing his lips. Draco
The next day, their faces are splashed over the papers. Draco doesn’t even care, because Harry is by his side in the picture and he’s smiling at Draco.
Harry’s glare, crossed by a long lightning scar, is fixed on him, so many emotions Draco hopes he still recognises shift across the green eyes he’s come to know so well. Now, though, he can’t tell what the anger in his orbs means.
"It'll be stronger if it's reinforced in two places." So Draco took the needle back, pricked his thumb again and stitched over Andromeda until she returned, and the thread wove in her husband with the Perseus constellation. Then came Nymphadora wreathed by Nova. Remus, of course, was woven with Lupus. And a bright shining gold line wove from Teddy, in Leo minor, to Harry.
everywhere. From the empty space in the closet where Draco kept Harry’s clothes neatly aligned for years, to the drawers he refuses to fill again since he sent Harry his socks and underwear a couple months ago.
But Harry doesn’t hate him, and that’s better than anything Draco hoped for this meeting. He has no idea how to deal with that.
"A very fine house, and I’d be happy to see you in any of them," Andromeda responded. Harry and Draco each took a shopping bag from her. All four of them put everything away in no time, and Harry collapsed onto a kitchen chair.
Rose’s group was much the opposite. Maybe a handful of them came from Falcons fans' families. The rest were from access and integration programs for minorities, low-income, and, on Harry’s insistence, Muggle-born families who found out early about magic via outreach groups. Most of the kids didn’t know who Harry was other than an athlete, which he found refreshing. He sat in the media studio and took their questions as if they were journalists. Pansy stood at the back as if it were a press conference. After some coaxing by volunteers, Rosie put her hand in the air.
"More roast!" Molly said, getting up mid-bite. Her fork hit the plate with a loud clatter, and she disappeared to the kitchen. Fleur got up and joined her. Even Hermione was casting longing glances at the kitchen. Andromeda rolled her eyes.
Harry frowns, gaze locked on his hands, where Draco had tried to touch him. “I don’t—” his voice shatters. Harry’s face twists into something painful, his body curling down as his hands go up to hold his head.
He looks embarrassed, and Draco doesn’t quite know why Harry is apologising for it. He can’t even contain his own grin at the possibility of Harry liking their old song.
— our voices barely whispers no one else could hear above the music. I still felt dirty and didn’t want to be touched, and you didn’t try to.
“Hmm,” Draco says distantly, tipping his head back as Harry nuzzles his skin. “I thought you liked the movie too much to miss it.”
"Filthy whoreson half-blood! Blackamoor! Sodomite! Catamite! Thief! You dishonour this house with every breath you take!"
The rain started falling sometime during their meeting, and Draco half expects to watch Harry’s damp back again as he leaves. However, when he’s finished helping Marvin tidy up the room, Harry and the stray cat are waiting for him by the door.
Why, though, should he have to contain it? Nowadays, holding back whatever expression of joy has become somewhat normal for him. But there’s no reason for Draco not to be smiling right now, and this certainty lifts something heavy from inside him. “It’s not like you invited me. Oh wait, you did.”
Everyone nods, knowing the origin of Draco’s fears by now, but it doesn’t stop Marvin from asking, “Why is that?”
“Weren’t you afraid?” Harry asks, after a moment of silence from his side. He turns on the bed, facing Draco almost completely. “When you died to find me. Weren’t you afraid of not coming back?”
"Have you thought about which anchor objects you would like to use?" Draco said. He hadn’t turned from the piano and was still playing something that sounded like a Scottish reel, upbeat and simple.
He can’t even say he’s been doing all his work for Harry. He obviously wanted Harry back, but his motives have always been self-centred.
"Forget about who it belonged to. There are about a hundred magical houses in Britain that are this old, many of which are dying. The magic used to make them alive is unique. We
"They must have done nothing but go to parties," Harry muttered, unpacking yet another plate. Draco laughed. Harry stared with confusion at one chalice, Draco lit up even though it looked unimpressive to Harry. The chalice was silver stamped with crescent moons and embedded with rubies, sapphires, and diamonds. It was heavier than it looked, too.
"Want some?" Harry teased, tilting the glass towards Draco. Draco made a face. Harry couldn’t help but smile, letting his tongue poke his teeth.
“I’m his Healer, and I’ll do everything I can to make sure Harry is better, even if I have to get you away from him.”
Draco, however, never got to feel what it’d be like to have lived with this gift, to have access to such power, to such life.
Hermione laughed. "Honestly? It’s fine. I still can’t believe the Wizarding world is so behind in legal rights. Most of the trials are like someone wanted all the showy parts of a witch burning without any of the minimum evidence standards. Then McMillan had the gall to tell me that traditions are our ancestors guiding us. Whose fucking ancestors? Shall we allow them to bully us from the grave into perpetuating injustice?"
"You’re supposed to catch the Quaffle with your hands," Oliver said helpfully as he zoomed past. Atty flipped him off and changed direction to throw it at his head, which made her rise in Harry’s estimation. Oliver caught it one-handed, grinning.
"How was your off-season, Park?" Harry asked the alternate Seeker. He was newer to the team, and an intimidatingly good flyer, Seeker for South Korea’s Worlds. If he agreed to play any other position, Min-Woo would no doubt be starting for another club. But he was loyal to being a Seeker even if it meant playing a couple matches a season.
The silence becomes oppressive when all he can hear is his own ragged breathing. Draco doesn’t stop trying until a heavy hand falls on his trembling shoulder and Healer Cameron’s voice echoes in the room. “She’s gone, Draco.”
build houses like this anymore. This house has a personality. It’s sentient magic. It takes a long time for that to happen. There’s a history we lose that has nothing to do with traditions, and everything to do with magic. We don’t know how they work. And if they all die off because no one cares, we never will."
Bill said he’d rather do several things, including climb into a Sphinx’s mouth, than do that kind of work. House magic was the realm of a specialised Curse-Breaker. Bill also put Malfoy’s name forward as his former apprentice. After Harry pressed Bill, he gave the name of several general Curse-Breakers, who came to Grimmauld, waved their wands around and then shrugged.
He can’t. Not really. He isn’t prepared enough, and it’s been years since he’s last done this. Even when they were married, Draco usually took the lead. He doesn’t care.
“I can show you some more pictures, if you want?” Draco’s offer sounds a lot like a hesitant question, when Harry keeps staring at their picture in silence for too long.
Draco resigns himself into sitting quietly by Harry’s side as the others continue their discussion, content in leaving Draco at the outskirts of it. Harry’s hand slips to his thigh, hot and possessive, and remains there.
They don’t exchange much more before Draco leaves. Although drinking to oblivion seems to have lost its appeal since he’s begun taking care of himself again, Draco is ready to tuck himself in bed once again with a bottle of good wine.
"A little swollen as usual, but the bone is normal density; muscle and tendons are nice and strong. No sign of the sprain. Penelope will give you a new routine, but there’s no reason to baby the ankle, it all looks good."
"I don’t want anything from Sirius’ parents. Put it all in the trash where it belongs. It’ll be a guest room," Harry said.
He’s graced with a glance of pure exasperation from Mia. Draco manages a short nod he hopes conveys everything he can’t say—
“I like yours though.” It was shorter than the week before, messy, shaved at the sides and black. I couldn’t help but laugh.
. Draco wonders if he needs to redeem himself again—or if he ever did. He will apologise to Harry a thousand times, though, if it means he can have him back.
Which was still better than what he wanted to say, which was ‘fuck you Blaise, I liked you better when you had your dick in my mouth.’
Draco shakes his head and forces the thoughts to dissolve into the background of his mind. He’s exhausted, has been working long hours without rest to make sure everything would be perfect with Elle’s ritual. He’ll think clearer once he’s had a glass of wine, a meal, and a good night’s rest.
Harry is also getting better, according to Pansy. He started with a new physiotherapist right after he woke up, and has been exercising regularly. It helps him control the movements of his body better, she explained unnecessarily, but also his untamed magic.
this.” Harry blurts, and there’s anger spilling out of him, before apathy settles again, before Harry’s eyes go back to the blank void.
Of course, it has to be Luna. She’s doing the same as she did to Draco when he was at his worst—even though he can’t really acknowledge this as Harry Potter’s worst. What, did he just come out of a magazine? She must be trying to help.
