“I suppose,” Harry answered before finishing his glass and placing it on the table.
“You’re already injured.”
Harry threw his leg over the seat then looked at Draco. “Hop on,” he said.
Brief as this exchange was, Draco found himself not wanting it to end. He wanted to cling to that spark of joy which seemed to ignite within him whenever in Harry’s company. The remanence of a flame that was never truly doused.
“No. You haven’t.”
Harry thought before answering. “I don’t know. Maybe I’m not saying anything,” he said more to himself than to Draco. Harry laughed nervously before continuing. “It’s just the thought of kissing you…” He trailed off and looked up at Draco. “Is something I’ve thought about for a long time.”
“Woah,” Draco said when he received notification of the unexpectedly large amount of money that had been deposited in his vault at Gringotts. His first payment from his unofficial position at the Ministry was much larger than he expected.
Draco resisted the urge to roll his eyes. As if he had a choice. Instead, he smiled politely and said it was no trouble.
“That’s too bad. I was hoping for a repeat performance to start the day.”
"Oh, leave him, he looks so sweet," said Hermione.
you. But anger was so familiar and easy – so much easier than any of the other feelings he might admit to.
“We’re going to Hogsmeade,” Harry said. He did not want the students to get the wrong idea and think he and Malfoy were on some sort of romantic stroll – but the truth seemed to make things even worse.
For a moment he thought Malfoy might protest, might try and wait with him, but to his relief, the other man just nodded.
of the room – the door, too, was boarded up – but when he followed that footstepped path through the dust of the floor he found it led to a blank wall with a tiny, hand-lettered sign taped to the blank expanse:
"Oh, basically fine? I told you Mona got that fellowship in Vancouver, right? Well, so she gets there and it turns out the guy who's supposed to be supervising her project straight up
“Not at the strength level your diagnostic suggests you require,” said Kevari. “You know Barley-thorn’s the only thing that’ll get your muscles to loosen. Here, can you sit up?”
“I don’t care what you did to them,” Negasi said fiercely. “I hope there’s a hell so they can rot in it. I just keep thinking… if it had been one of us, and
want to go in the lake. His fringe was sweat-damp and his t-shirt was sticking to his lower back, and absolutely nothing sounded better than leaping into the pure ice-cold water, where gravity wouldn't pull him down and it wouldn't matter if his leg didn't hold him well. But his shoulder -- his shoulder would make it very difficult to swim. He could wade in and float, probably, but then there was the idea of taking off his shirt in front of Malfoy, whose broad shoulders and strong arms would be on full display. Harry imagined the rest of his torso was just as impressive. Harry hadn't really looked in the mirror recently, but he knew he was thinner than he'd been a few years ago, and his time in the Ministry had left him with an unflattering set of scars even before he'd been cursed. The curse scars alone were horrible to behold, shiny and raised and so clearly made from dark magic.
"Professor, you -- your mouth is bleeding."
"You're lucky," Malfoy said. "Usually on a Wednesday at this time I'd be knee deep in parchment, but I've just finished grading the last one."
“Excellent,” Harry said, finally feeling secure enough to reach for his cane again and slot his wand away. “Could I side-along with you?”
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. "Some things never change." Then he said, "I also apologize. What you want known is your business. I didn't realize it was a sore subject or I wouldn't have been so cavalier."
His good mood from the letter helped him push through third period to lunch, though the ache in his shoulder had intensified and his whole upper back was complaining. He hesitated at the Floo, debating whether to skip lunch in favor of a hot bath, but he was too eager to see Malfoy, to try and speak with him, to make things right, so he went to the Great Hall instead.
“Merlin, your faces,” he said, wiping his eyes. “No, Potter, of course we’re not going to arrest you. We need an official statement is all, you know the protocol. You too, Malfoy. Come along.”
“Well,” Neville said, fussing over the leaves like a proud mother, “like I said, I heard this from McGonagall, back when he was very first hired at Hogwarts. Like you, he didn’t even have to apply – she reached out and offered him the job, partly because they needed a new Potions master and he was very well-qualified… but partly to protect him.”
Malfoy, for his part, did no more than glance at Harry, and Harry felt both relieved and obscurely disappointed. He knew he was nothing to look at, not anymore, but shouldn't Malfoy at least be curious? About the scars, anyway -- most people were. The complete lack of interest was disheartening. Which was a strange feeling, because usually Harry hated to be stared at.
Malfoy shook his head. “It isn’t masochism if you like it, is it?”
With effort, she did so, clutching her hands together like a tiny grown-up.
What a question! Was it inappropriate to tell the truth? "Yes? Though it's not, of course, erm, public."
“Er – I suppose I did notice,” said Malfoy, and even in his own torment Harry took pleasure from seeing prim and proper Malfoy grow discomfited. He did not, however, take pleasure in the wave of thrilled giggles this comment brought about. “Well, they’re an unusual color,” Malfoy continued, clearly trying to assert logic in the face of all this silliness. “Very green.”
He felt rather than saw Malfoy smile. "I think that could be arranged."
Ron glanced at the curled, swollen fingers of his left hand, then at the white-knuckled grip the right had on his cane. “I don’t like this, mate.”
"He was terrible, like all of us," Malfoy said, as if in agreement. "But he's one of the only other ones who made it out."
"Was it food poisoning?" Neville asked.
Harry couldn’t answer. He was suddenly so exhausted he couldn’t even find it in himself to lift his wand, and he sat there with a lapful of potatoes and chicken, trying to gather the energy to clean the mess and make a joke and get through the rest of the evening like a human being, but the energy wasn’t coming.
"You Brits and your stones... Draco, can you give it to me in pounds?"
"It's only now occurring to me," she said, "that I didn't think to -- that is, it was foolish not to have considered -- well, your room's on the sixth floor and your classroom's on the first."
“Dougie said you might come by. Couldn’t pass up the chance to see if the old magic really works, could you?”
, but he was too angry to explain this, and too frightened of what it would mean if he did.
“Out?” Harry said blankly.
"Cane's in the trunk," Harry said shortly. And there it would stay. Even apart from having been in the papers, the injuries to his leg were impossible to hide; all you had to do was watch him limp across a room. Lesser-known, however, and much easier to conceal, were the injuries to his arm on the same side. He had no grip or fine motor control to speak of anymore and his shoulder waged war if he tried to raise his arm above the waist, which essentially only left him with one free hand -- which he had no intention of filling with a cane. If a situation came up, as it was sure to, he wanted to be holding not a cane but his wand.
"Gesundheidt?"
know,” Neville said stubbornly.
“Thanks for everything, Healer Kevari,” Harry said, a bit shamefaced.
version of the pain potion you should have been taking, and that will take the edge off. I assume you had an unfortunate experience with your own disgusting concoction?"
"Oh," said Malfoy. "Yes, I mean, I -- yes, it's interesting. I'll owl Betsy and let her know. How's 2pm?"
"What d'you want to do today?" Ron asked. "Any Hogsmeade sights you're dying to re-visit in your few hours of freedom?"
Hermione appeared around the corner, her eyes lighting up when she saw them. “Is that – oh, Harry, hi! Ron, what’s wrong?”
"At least you're self-aware." Malfoy sipped his whiskey and then turned the glass around in his hand. "I heard you talking to Neville the other night about Hogsmeade. That's where Weasley and Granger ended up, didn't they? Or -- I suppose I ought to say, the Minister and the Mr. Minister."
“Johnson got held up in the field and asked if I could fill in,” he paused and Draco could feel his stare burning in the back of his head. “I didn’t realize anyone else would be joining us.”
“Malfoy, glad you could make it,” Robards greated. “Thank you for taking the time to come in.”
“Go home, Harry,” Draco said, facing the wall opposite the door with his hands leaning on his desk.
“Do you want to sit down? You look like you could use a break from whatever it is you do here.” Harry smiled.
A draft entered the room causing Draco’s hair to fall into his eyes.
“Not so much a ‘what’ really. More of a ‘who,’” Draco watched Ron’s face as he slowly realized what Draco was implying. The moment it clicked would be one Draco would cherish for years to come.
“Astoria.”
Harry eyed Draco’s throbbing cock as he continued to work his fingers around it like a trained musician. Harry soon replaced his fingers with his tongue and ran it from the base to the tip, finishing by inserting it into his mouth. Harry sucked on the tip before bowing his head to take more of Draco in.
“But it’s fun,” Draco whined.
“Oh come on,” Draco grabbed Harry’s arm and pulled him up the four flights of stairs that lead to his flat. He unlocked the door with his key and rolled his eyes at the feigned look of shock on Harry’s face as he noticed Draco’s use of muggle technology.
Draco walked toward the window and saw a note. He opened it to find the tell tale scribble of Harry’s handwriting.
He was taken away from his thoughts when Harry suddenly took his entire length in one go. His mind went blank as he was overcome with pleasure. Draco ran his fingers through Harry’s unruly locks and pressed his hips forward .Before he knew it, Draco was coming down Harry’s throat.
Draco swallowed the entirety of Harry’s length and lost himself in the salty taste of the precome that was leaking from the tip. He feverishly sucked Harry’s member reaching the base with every go.
“I don’t think I’m strong enough to apparate so we’ll have to walk,” Draco said without acknowledging Harry’s statement. “It’s not terribly far.”
Draco leaned in to kiss Astoria and lift her up so she was properly seated on the counter. She ran her hands over his chest as he ran his up her thigh. He was delighted to find that the shirt was, in fact, the only thing she was wearing. Draco smiled into their kiss at the discovery and began to massage her clit.
“I’m sure I’ve endured worse.”
Draco wanted to speak. Wanted to tell Harry just how much he had wanted this--wanted him--but he held his tongue. This couldn’t possibly go any further than it already had. Draco had a hard enough time believing that the wizarding world’s golden boy was on his knees with an ex-death eater’s cock in his mouth. Draco simply watched in fascination, dreading the moment it would all be over.
Tears began to fill Draco’s eyes, and through the fog, he saw that Harry had begun to cry as well.
Draco found himself lost in his work, connecting dots where he could and noting gaps in the information. He hadn’t even noticed that the sun had fully set until he got up to start another pot of coffee. Once he realized how late it had gotten, Draco opted for a glass of water instead of the extra caffeine.
“It amazes me how fast you can heal.”
“I have an emergency stash in the kitchen…” Harry barely waited for Draco to finish what he was saying before he sped off to help the blonde.
“What?” Draco asked as he tried to ground himself, but his head was so high in the clouds that he didn’t ever think he’d be able to come back down.
Harry followed without protest. The music from below was dampened by some variation of a silencing charm as they crossed the threshold. The owner’s lounge was even more lavish than the main floor. Harry glanced around at the standing tables lined the balcony that looked out onto the general crowd, black leather couches were arranged around matching ottomens and side tables, and a bar with priceless liquors. There were about twenty or so people lounging and chatting. All were dressed in the latest fashions and many sipped cocktails with a red heue.
“Scotch, neat,” Harry directed to the bartender who nodded and had his drink prepared in seconds. He turned to observe the crowd again taking in the details he’s missed before.
“That can’t be possible,” Draco said. “That can’t possibly be legal.”
“I’ve managed to make it comfortable.” Draco entered the pin that allowed him access to the building. He ushered for Harry to follow him inside. “There’s no lift so we’ll have to take the stairs.”
Draco looked up to face Ron Weasley. Excellent.
“Babe?” Draco shouted over his shoulder and saw Ron repeat the word out of the corner of his eye. The redhead appeared to be questioning everything he believed in.
“I’m fine, Potter,” Draco said only to prove Harry right when the vampire winced from the pain he felt when he moved to stand.
“You’re not just stringing Astoria along are you?”
“We can discuss this further tomorrow evening.” Draco turned without another word and spelled the doors to lock after Harry.
“Oh, I don’t know. There are plenty of positions for interns in all of the departments.”
Astoria paused and something between them shifted. Her piercing blue eyes cut into Draco as her expression changed from frustration to sorrow. “Is there someone else?” She asked quietly.
“This is the one thing you can’t fight me on, Draco. You know I’m right.”
Draco pulled Harry in for a kiss and apparated them up the stairs to his lofted bedroom as he did. Draco gently guided Harry to the bed who fell back onto the cushions dragging Draco down on top of him, not once breaking the kiss. Not even when Draco’s hands moved from Harry’s waist to explore the black haired man’s body. Draco’s hands ran over the dips and curves of Harry’s elegant muscles. His hands slipped under Harry’s shirt allowing his fingers to trace the outline of Harry’s abs. Draco’s hands traveled lower and his lips followed suit, mouthing at the skin on Harry’s neck.
“I see you decided to take the tour on your own,” Draco smirked in his direction.
“Don’t worry about it.”
Harry looked at Draco. “Sorry to bring down the mood. I just mean to say that you mean a lot to him.”
“There you are, I’ve been looking for you all night.” Harry said when he’d finally reached Draco.
Draco smiled and looked down at the sleeping child. He lifted his hand to smooth stray curls out of Teddy’s face. Draco’s gaze rested on the child for a moment longer before looking up and meeting Harry’s eye.
“Mainly we’d want you to help us keep tabs on You-Know-Who’s followers. There have been whisperings of illicit activity stemming from that particular group of witches and wizards. You do still have connections with ex-Death Eater’s, yes?”
“Well, here,” Harry rolled back his sleeve and offered Draco his wrist. “Take my blood.”
Harry’s hands were firm on Draco’s length. He tugged and twisted and Draco let himself be taken over by the sensation. Draco must have missed the moment Harry pulled his trousers down so he was fully exposed, because when he looked up Harry was sliding off his lap to position himself between Draco’s thighs.
“There are always openings at The Ministry,” Andromeda suggested while she and Draco cleaned the dishes from dinner.
They stopped in the middle of the dance floor and Harry grabbed Draco’s hips and pressed his chest against the blonde’s back. Harry guided Draco’s hips to the beat of the music while simultaneously grinding up against him. Draco dropped his head back to rest on Harry’s shoulder and shivered as the shorter man’s stubble scratched his cheek.
“I guess not.”
“Hm,” Draco thought for a moment. Everything in Draco’s life was always given to him. He never had to work for what he had. His father never worked so he didn’t have any frame of reference of what it would be like to have a job. “I guess it’s worth a shot.”
“Mr. Malfoy,” Robards then addressed Draco. “Please, come in.”
The relief was short lived, because the sight of Harry was accompanied by the same tightness in his chest and a tortuous reminder that he was headed down a dangerous path.
Harry gave into Draco’s light touches. He sighed before speaking. “I’m sure we can come to some sort of an arrangement.”
“Draco!” Harry warned indicating that the door was in fact to be opened by Draco.
Harry walked into the kitchen leaving Draco to sit uncomfortably at the edge of the couch. The lunacy of his decision to show up on Harry’s doorstep was beginning to dawn on him. He should just get up and leave. What was he even planning to say to Harry? And even if he could find the words he doubted Harry would listen. But before Draco was able to find his feet, Harry returned carrying two glasses and a bottle of fire whiskey.
Harry moaned as Draco began to kiss him and his hands crept round to his arse. Draco began to undress Harry so they were both free of their clothing. His lips traveled down Harry’s chest, licking and sucking at each of his nipples on the way.
Draco slumped into the couch, trying to catch his breath. Harry looked up at Draco. His glasses were crooked and he had a look of complete satisfaction on his face. Draco smiled and ran a hand through Harry’s messy hair once more before pulling him back up to the couch, flipping him over, and yearning for the moment he would have Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, trembling beneath him.
Their tongues danced around each other in a frenzied rush to be reacquainted with the once familiar territory. Neither seemed concerned with breathing. It was only an interference that threatened to break them apart. When the need for air became too much to bear, their lips would part but only for a moment. For being apart was as uncomfortable as a lack of oxygen.
They sat separate from the other guests, and Draco did his best to engage in normal conversation with the man sitting next to him. He was surprised to find that the task wasn’t nearly as daunting as he’d originally thought. Draco tried to convince himself that it was the alcohol, but sitting there with Harry, talking and laughing, Draco had felt happier than he had in a long time.
“How about some breakfast?” He asked, planting kisses along Astoria’s shoulder.
“You have no idea what you’re getting into,” Draco’s words cut Harry short.
Draco tried to think of a retort but was drawing a blank. “Well, you almost kissed me too,” was the best he could come up with.
Draco stared at Harry. The look on the blonde’s face resembled the look he gave Harry before lying to his family, effectively protecting him from Voldemort. It was a look that one could only manage when they saw someone they cared about in pain.
Draco was able to use the floo because he had previously made an appointment to meet with the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. All he was looking for was an administrative position, something that didn’t require much experience. He could have easily chosen any other department at the ministry, but he felt drawn to this one. Granted this probably had a lot to do with the fact that this was the very department that Harry worked in. Although Draco would never admit that.
A loud “what the fuck?!” from Ron was the last thing Draco heard before he entered the kitchen (with no intent of actually doing the dishes.)
Ron turned to face his boss and he went from predator to prey in an instant. “Yes, sir?”
Once home, Draco threw open the liquor cabinet and grabbed a bottle.
“Voila!” Draco spread his arms wide after he placed the box next to the front door to show off his new flat. Harry walked in behind him and looked around. “What do you think?”
He followed the man to the back of the house and once out of sight Draco rushed at him pinning the culprit to the wall.
“Well, spit it out weasel. Some of us have important things to get back to.”
“Not quite,” Ron obediently answered.
“Are you sure?” Draco asked imagining the handful of people who had direct access to Harry’s house and the likely unwelcoming reaction Draco would receive from any of them.
Draco smiled at these words and gently kissed Harry in response. “Show me then.”
Malfoy’s didn’t work. Everyone knew that. Plus, his family had been underground for some time now. The last time Draco’s father had shown his face in this horrid place was to pawn the last of his dark artifacts before the Ministry raided the manor.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Mr. Borgin greeted when Draco approached the counter. “To what do I owe the pleasure? I haven’t seen you father in quite some time. Are we buying or selling today?”
“More illegal than your entire operation?”
“Well if you’re not going to talk, I will. Why did you lead me on if you were dating Astoria?”
“It’s fine.” Draco’s words were cold and abrupt. Out of the corner of his eye he could see the remorseful look on Harry’s face and it suddenly felt like there were oceans between them.
Teddy’s grin widened then he turned his attention back to the movie, resting his head on Draco’s chest.
Draco figured that he had made enough progress for the evening and went to join Harry and Teddy in the other room. Teddy’s face lit up when he saw Draco approaching and climbed into his lap when Draco took a seat next to them.
“Draco,” Astoria’s voice was stern. “You know what I mean. I spend more time here than at my own home, yet you’re afraid to call me your girlfriend.”
“What was that?”
“Hey, Harry,” Ron said suspiciously. He looked back and forth between Harry and Draco (who was still laughing) as if he were trying to figure out whether Draco had Harry under the Imperius Curse.
Harry sighed and set the glass on the table in front of Draco before taking a seat on the armchair across the room.
Harry pulled back, breathless from the intensity of the kiss. “I can’t even begin to tell you how much I missed you,” he whispered against Draco’s lips with their foreheads pressed together.
Teddy giggled and whispered something into Harry’s ear. Harry smiled and laughed at the shared secret.
Teddy’s laughs increased instead of answering Draco’s question.
“I think you should go,” Harry’s words were quiet but cut through the silence nonetheless.
This new discovery sprung Draco out of his depression and straight into a manic state. He wouldn’t rest until he knew for sure what the cause of his love’s death was. He’d gone from spending all of his time locked away in his room to being locked away in the estate’s library. He feverishly paged through the hundreds of books on the shelves searching for anything that would clue him in on what had given him such a bad feeling.
Draco locked eyes with Andromeda as he stood. She walked over to give him a hug and he felt himself begin to tear up. He couldn’t find the words to thank her for all she had done for him. She had taken him in in his time of need. She had helped him get back on his feet. And most importantly, she believed in him.
Eventually he wasn’t even able to feed at all and his hunger reduced him to a corps like state. Malcolm had given up trying to get him out of the house figuring that at least if Draco stayed in bed he wouldn’t have to pull him out of the sunlight.
Draco was losing his grip on reality. When he wasn’t sitting at home, he was wandering aimlessly through the streets. He had bought a bottle of fire whisky before shoving it to the back of a cabinet resisting the temptation.
Draco snatched it away and drained the container of blood, not caring how it must have looked to Harry. He rarely fed infront of anyone. Vampires typically saved such a sight for their most intimate of relationships. Draco quickly regained control over his animalistic nature at the thought.
Draco lounged with his feet on the coffee table. Daily Prophet in one hand, a cup of steaming tea in the other. He was just beginning to feel relaxed when the doorbell rang. The last thing Draco wanted to do was move from his current position. Besides, it wasn’t even his house. It was Harry’s. And they had kept their relationship secret to prolong the bliss and avoid the inevitable judgment from others.
“‘Employment opportunities?’” Ron repeated. “Blow through your inheritance already, have we?” He seemed to laugh at the thought until he noticed that Draco was in fact serious. “What makes you think there’s anything here for you?”
“You made your choices. Don’t blame me for the consequences,” Harry said.
“I know.” There was a pause. There was something in the way Harry had said those words that Draco couldn’t quite make out.
“It comes in handy.”
“The Reform had just begun when I joined the Aurors,” Harry began. He tried his best to keep his voice steady, but in turn found his hands were shaking. He knew Draco would notice, but he forced himself to continue.
“I knew training would be demanding, but some of it was just cruel. They would use unforgivables on us nearly everyday, and awful potions when they didn’t. It was their rewritten philosophy that we as Aurors should train with anything we might face in the field. Before we could pass the program they…” Harry’s words trailed off as he tried to form them. “They made us drink The Drink of Despair.” The memories of the horrible things that potion made him see and feel. He had watched all of his loved ones die all over again. It felt as though fire was coursing through his veins. The nightmares that had plagued him after the war became relentless after that. He wasn’t able to get a good nights sleep unaided for months. Even the strongest of sleeping draughts  prescribed to him by the ministry’s mind healers only took the edge off.
Ron shuttered before speaking again. “Is Harry here?”
“So,” Robards began. “I take it you’re seeking employment?”
The job was slow at first. Draco spent countless hours scanning various documents and gathering information from customers when he could without seeming suspicious. But all of this work eventually paid off when Draco spotted a sly exchange outside of Borgan & Burkes. Draco figured the best way to get more information was to pose as a buyer. He was far too recognizable to present himself in front of such a high profile criminal.
“Then why does it matter? It’s not like you ever wanted to be seen with me when we were together. I was just one big embarrassing secret.”
Draco sighed. “What? Were you hoping I’d be your forever boy?”
“At least I have inheritance to blow through,” Draco sneered.
“Well, what the ministry doesn’t know is that Macnair escaped. He came directly for my family when he did,” Draco paused. He closed his eyes and took a breath before he continued. “I was unlucky enough to be home alone that evening. I was completely pissed and forgot to set the wards. It wasn’t difficult for him to break in. I don’t remember much,” Draco lied. “I woke up in a tomb somewhere not long after. And, well, you know the rest.”
“Still want that drink?”
Harry pushed open the office door only moments after Draco. The silence that followed was almost as deafening as the chaos on the other side of the silencing charm on his office.
“What?”
“Draco,” Harry stood after him. “Where are you going?”
When Draco was presented with an opportunity to fully commit to Astoria, he froze. Draco should have denied it outright, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. He loved Astoria, he truly did, but he still loved Harry as well.
“Eloquent as always.”
“I wouldn’t worry too much, sweetheart. Most of the ministry officials aren’t as squeaky clean as they appear.”
The way Harry moaned and twisted his face in pleasure each time the blonde grazed his prostate. The way Harry squirmed under Draco occasionally brushing up against his cock. The erotic sounds emanating from the auror’s mouth were nearly enough to drive Draco to the edge on their own. He couldn’t take it anymore. He needed Harry and he needed him now.
Merlin, Draco! Talking to you is like trying to talk to that pompous, selfish, arrogant prick from Hogwarts who lived to make my life a living hell!”
“Anyway,” Pansy rolled her eyes. “It seems that you’ve had quite an enjoyable time yourself these past few weeks.”
“The ministry has an arsenal of deadly poisons and potions. Almost all of which are illegal. Why do you ask?”
“Are you scared of the commitment?” She continued to push for an answer.
Draco flashed his fangs and the man’s eyes widened in terror as his gaze locked on the needle like teeth that protruded from Draco’s gums.
“Are you going to be ok?” Harry asked.
“Please,” Draco accepted Harry’s offer then lifted Teddy carefully before carrying him upstairs to put him to bed.
Harry’s voice was cold. And rightfully so. If the situation were in reverse, Draco would have hexed Harry into oblivion. Draco surely had Robards presence to thank for the other man’s restraint.
“Get out of here. And I better not catch you in my club again.”
Harry exited the kitchen and rounded the corner to the stairs when he ran into Malcolm coming out of what Harry assumed was his bedroom just ahead.
Draco looked at Astoria. A wave of various emotions rolled through him. He was angry with himself for having not been honest. He was scared that, after everything, he would lose Astoria because of his mistakes. And the look on Astoria’s face saddened Draco. Above all he couldn’t believe that he'd hurt her so.
“Vampires? Yes.” Draco answered before Harry was able to finish. “Not to worry though. They won’t attack you, unless I want them to.”
Draco rolled his eyes. Sure Malcom would understand, right after he chided Draco for the stupid way he’d manage to injure himself.
Harry was beaming at the action, and pushed Draco into the silk sheets. He pulled Draco’s shirt from where it was tucked into his trousers as Draco took to the gesture by undoing enough buttons so the garment was easily lifted over his head.
“Well, all of the admin positions are filled. But how would you like to work in the field?”
Draco clenched the bottle in his hand as he scanned the crowd and kept his eyes peeled for any suspicious activities. His club was high scale but it was still underground and plenty of criminals made their way through. Tonight, Draco had particular interest in the potions dealers. It was expected that people wanted to get high and Decadence was the perfect venue to buy and sell. It was mostly harmless recreationals that entered the circulation, but Draco knew many of the dealers had ties in the dark arts. One of them was bound to know where the bloodroot came from.
“Almost everyday,” Harry finally said after taking a moment to compose himself.
“What are you doing here, Malfoy?” Ron finally managed.
“Very little,” Draco corrected with a small laugh.
“Bet you’ll think twice about making me answer the door next time.” Draco smirked and obeyed his boyfriend.
Draco instinctively reached towards his arm before answering.
“What do you mean?” Draco asked.
Draco heard Harry’s steady footsteps approach him followed by a firm, yet gentle grasp on his hips. Draco didn’t resist when Harry turned him so they were face to face.
He hadn’t really known what to expect when he’d taken Robards’ offer. So far, much of what he’d been doing he assumed was typical auror work. Maybe Robards had wanted to recruit him but couldn’t risk the backlash that would have inevitably come with hiring a Malfoy.
“You should go,” Draco said quietly.
“Not exactly. This is more of an unofficial position.” Robards clarified. “An undercover informant if you will.”
“How long until it’s healed?” Harry asked.
In an instant, Harry’s footsteps sped up and Draco laughed at the “shit” Harry mumbled just loud enough for him to hear from the next room over.
Draco woke up to the sight of Astoria sleeping in his arms. He smiled at the thought of being greeted by this sight every morning. Images of what their future might hold flooded his mind, and Draco found himself fantasizing about things he’d previously thought he could live without. Marriage, children, building a life with someone and growing old together. Draco had never thought he’d want these things. But the thought of having Astoria in his life filled him with so much joy that he couldn’t help but hope for a future together.
“Damnit, Potter!” Draco shouted, slamming his fist on the coffee table, anger finally boiling over. “You’ve got to be fucking kidding me! My father kicked me out of the house because he walked in on me with another man. And you not wanting to be seen with me in public?”
“Hey, Ron!” Harry tried to say as casually as possible and failed miserably.
“No! Of course not!” Draco defended. He would never dream of doing such a thing to Astoria. As far as Draco was concerned, the Harry situation was handled.
Draco’s eyes rolled into the back of his head as he came, edged on by the sounds of Harry’s release. And as quickly as it began, it was over.
“I know you can’t look at me when you’re lying. I know you think you’re protecting me by pushing me away. And I know that whatever it is can’t be worse than losing you again.”
He’d stopped feeding regularly, only leaving the house when absolutely necessary. And when he did gather enough strength to do so, he was careless and threatened to leave a trail. If the Aurors found their lair so be it. He had nothing left to live for.
“You can sit down,” Harry said and Draco did. He was careful not to choose the seat he had come to claim as his own during his frequent visits and settled for the couch.
A devilish grin spread across Harry’s face and he lunged forward, grabbing Draco forcefully. Draco suddenly found himself on his chest with Harry spreading his cheeks. He shivered from the cool air in the room and the anticipation of what was to come.
“It’s Harry, isn’t it?”
It wasn’t until a peculiar scent caught Draco’s attention that he was able to rise himself from his bed. It wasn’t surprising that the scent of the potion was familiar to him, he’d been training as a potions master before his transformation. Draco lifted the vial to his nose and his stomach turned once he got a good whiff. That awful feeling from that horrible night returned. He did a mental inventory through all of the potions and ingredients he’d had in the house but none matched what was in his hand. Not wanting to believe his nose, Draco scoured through his cabinets only to confirm that there was no match. This potion contained something that was much darker and far more dangerous than any household ingredient. Even the items in his less than legal collection did not match the scent.
“Not until you tell me what’s wrong. I thought--”
“Draco,” Harry said. “I want you,”
“Really?” Teddy asked.
“We were starting to worry. And Teddy hasn’t been able to sit still since lunch,” Draco said, still lingering in the doorway.
“What are you saying?” Draco asked hesitantly. He feared that he might have been misreading the situation.
“Who is that? In the painting,” Harry asked as Draco approached where he was standing.
Draco’s eyes were tired from reading the small print for most of the day. He reached for his third cup of coffee and sighed before diving back into his work.
Harry said nothing. He scooted closer to Draco, closing the gap between them on the couch. His face was just centimeters away as he looked into Draco’s eyes.
Draco scoffed. “You’re one to talk.”
“Hey, kiddo!” Harry greeted Teddy. “Sorry I’m late. There was a late arrest and we were slammed with paperwork.” Harry addressed Draco this time.
As if reading Draco’s mind, Harry wandlessly did what the blonde was attempting to do and positioned himself on his back so his entrance was in full view. Draco’s prick twitched at the sight of the slick, gaping hole that beckoned him. Not wasting another second, he positioned his cock and slid into Harry. Their cries of pleasure rang through the entire house as Draco forcefully thrust into Harry’s arse, hitting his prostate nearly every time.
“No, wait,” Draco held the door open, trying to ignore the irritated look on Harry’s face as he did. “Can I come in? Please?”
Harry didn’t have to clarify before Draco realized what he’d been referring to. He finally looked at Harry only to have his suspicion realized. Draco knew what this meant. He’d been here before. Sensing another’s mood and thoughts and intentions without a word passing between them. He didn’t want to believe it, wrecking his brain for another possible explanation of the phenomena.
“Don’t be. I’ve seen worse,” Harry said with a shadow of amusement cast over his words.
Draco sighed. Giving into Harry’s insistence, he grabbed the helmet and pulled it over his head.
Harry leaned back and looked at Draco. His face had lit up at the idea and his hand wandered to Draco’s achingly hard cock and teased it through his jeans. Draco’s hips instinctively jerked upward as Harry tugged on his waistband
Draco lost track of his surroundings and let himself be engulfed by the euphoria of the moment. Harry gently guided Draco to turn and face him and pulled him close. Their eyes met for a moment before Harry tilted his head up to kiss Draco.
Draco came with a shout, his entire body shaking from the intensity of his orgasm. Harry was soon to follow, just as fiercely as Draco.
“This is the only place in London to get a drink after curfew. Here for a similar reason?” As Harry said this he pushed his coat back to reveal the stake he kept on his belt.
“You might as well have been. Let me see your arm.” Harry said as he rose from his position and approached where Draco was seated.
“I wouldn’t put it past them.” Harry knew it was probably the last thing Draco wanted to hear, but it was the truth. And he wasn’t going to keep that from him. Draco’s life could have been in danger as well and it was better that he had the knowledge necessary to protect himself if the event did arise.
Ron had, once again, lost his ability to speak. Draco looked at Ron then Harry.
“Fine,” was all Harry said before turning his back and retreating into the house.
Both men collapsed on the bed, completely spent. Draco could hardly move, small waves of pleasure still coursing through his body. He hummed contently when Harry threw his arm around his waist and held him close. That night, Draco slept more comfortably than he had in ages.
“No need to get wound up, Potter.” Malcolm responded just as nonchalant as before. “Just wasn’t expecting any company at this hour is all.” He barely acknowledged his presence as he spoke.
Draco looked at the note and a wave of unjustified anger ran through him. He wished Harry would just take the hint and move on. The same as Draco was trying to do.
“Well hopefully the boredom stops now. Why don’t we watch a movie?” Harry suggested.
Draco looked up to see Astoria approaching him from the stairs. He walked into the kitchen to meet her, taking delight of the image of her wearing his shirt from the night before.
One moment, both of the men were standing in the middle of the room as if the proximity would strengthen the sting of their words. The next, they were kissing against the wall.
“So I’d be fetching coffee for the whole of the department?”
It didn’t take long for Draco’s crippling depression to return. The weight of Adriel’s death was simply too much to bear and there was nothing in his life to lessen the burden. For the first time in a long time, he felt truly alone.
“To what floor?”
Draco eyed the page in disbelief as he tried to wrap his mind around his discovery. It shouldn’t have been possible. Bloodroot was a highly regulated substance. He had never handled it, not even at the high level of potions work he had achieved in his previous life. As much has he wished it weren’t true, Draco couldn’t deny that this was a far more nefarious act than he had originally thought.
“Draco!” Harry waved as he made his way through the crowd.
Harry could see the gears in Draco’s brain turning as he began to connect the dots. He’d visibly  clenched his jaw and his entire person had become tense. “Are you saying the ministry killed Adriel?” Draco’s words were barely a whisper, but the venom behind them was clear as day.
The black haired man’s stare always managed to penetrate Draco’s defenses. He became engulfed with an overwhelming sense of vulnerability. The last time this had happened, Draco made a fool of himself. And he wasn’t sure he was quite ready for a repeat performance.
“Merlin, Draco. Is she at least a witch?”
“How was the honeymoon?” Draco asked Pansy. Her and Theo had returned from their month long honeymoon in Bali a few days earlier. She was now joining Draco for lunch at his loft.
Harry ran to him and kicked the door shut as Draco fell into his arms.
“He says that you were boring today,” Harry confessed.
“Hey,” Draco knelt down so he was level with Teddy. He scooped up the child and sat him on his knee before wiping his cousin’s eyes. “I’ll still be around, Teddy Bear.”
Draco fell silent once more. He simply turned and faced Harry, crossing his arms.
Teddy nodded. “Ok,” he leaned back in to hug Draco again and then went to say goodbye to Harry.
“So,” Harry began once Draco was seated. “About the other night.”
Harry moved his lips from Draco’s mouth to his neck. “Tell me what you want,” he whispered against the sensitive skin of Draco’s neck.
“Have you got those reports ready for me yet?” Robards asked the now tame weasel.
Feeling extremely vulnerable, Draco made his way to the couch and sat beside Harry. He was barely able to organize his thoughts before Harry spoke.
“What’s your poison?” Draco turned to Harry when they reached the bar. Before Harry had a chance to answer, the bartender placed a martini glass on the counter next to Draco.
“Just a memory now,” Draco answered.
A gasp slipped from Draco’s lips as Harry took him in his hands and used his thumb to smear precome over the slit. Harry began to stroke Draco, bringing him dangerously close to the edge. Not wanting to reach his climax before he was able to fully experience Harry again, Drake took control and moved so he was on top of Harry.
Draco quietly got out of bed, careful to not wake Astoria, and slipped on his discarded briefs from the night before. He descended the stairs and went to the kitchen to start a pot of tea and look for something to make for his and Astoria’s breakfast. He had placed the kettle on the stovetop when something on the windowsill caught his eye.
“How are you feeling?” Harry asked once he rubbed the sleep from his eyes.
“I, well, I suppose,”
“How’s your arm?” Harry asked Draco after taking a sip of his drink.
“I’m not out, Draco. Publicly dating a man is a bigger deal to me than it is to you. And as far as I’m concerned my sexuality is no one's business.”
Harry elbowed Draco in the side. It had stopped the laughter, but Draco was still beaming with pride.
With Draco momentarily distracted, Harry stole a kiss and guided the blonde’s fingers to his hole which was already slick with lube. Draco snapped back into the moment when Harry’s breath hitched at the gentle caress of the sensitive muscle. He teased the outside once more before sliding a finger into the tight warmth of Harry’s arse. As Draco worked Harry open, he could hardly wait to bury himself deep inside the other man.
“Hello there, pleasant afternoon isn’t it?” Draco said to the two blonds who paused their conversations to look at him. He continued on turning to Luna, “My name is Draco Malfoy I believe we go to the same school you’re a Ravenclaw right?”
If he lived long enough to become Malfoy head with their riches intact he’d put the money to good use for once. Probably to create a home for abused and mistreated magical children. And of course donate to a few muggle LGBTQ+ charities. Something meaningful and selfless for once.
As Draco made his way up the steps behind his parents he was nervous. The thought of coming face to face with the golden trio was nerve wracking. On one hand he’d be meeting his previous life’s idols and on the other he knew exactly how he had contributed to the deaths of many of their loved ones in another timeline. Even if he hadn’t actually done it yet the guilt was like an acid in his body. His only hope was to firmly hold the Malfoy mask of indifference and ignore them completely.
The man demanded all the money in the drawer and their wallets. Miguel and Alma worked quickly to comply but Miguel refused to move from in front of his dear cousin moving when he needed to when the man would shift. The masked man was jittery and erratic; he was sure he had to be on something due to the paranoid ramblings he kept muttering to himself.
“Draco, come” his mother said, pulling him gently back to the villa. He tried focusing on her face but was greeted instead with another ‘memory’. This time his mother was far away. Her face looked older and more tired. She stood next to his father who looked nothing like the haughty man he had always known. Instead stood a man willing to gamble his family’s lives to follow a madman; there stood a coward.
“Here take this one free of charge,” said Mr. Lovegood before standing up to hand Draco the copy he had been holding.
He looked at Luna still grinning. “Your father is so much nicer than mine!”
Its the first week before the Wizard World Cup and Draco is here to enjoy it. He is still coming to terms with himself but won't let that get in the way of the fun.
Mr. Lovegood looked pleased before replying, “I’m doing great, are you also a reader of the Quibbler?”
Miguel felt a sharp pain in his stomach. Looking down he saw he was bleeding heavily. He looked back to Alma. “Are you okay?” Miguel asked before he fell to the ground and everything went black. The last thing he heard was Alma screaming his name.
“Okay but you have to keep the book in a swirl patterned sack for safety. Nargles like to steal things and would prefer to protect their secrets. The swirls will confuse them” interjected Luna.
“You know it’s called Slytherin and so what? You’re never going to be pretty but you still put on makeup.” Miguel ran away as his sister started hitting him. “Mama Yansi is hitting me!”
Yansi rolled her eyes, “You aren’t a Slipper-in and in case you didn’t know you’re twenty two you need to accept your Hogwarts letter isn’t coming.”
The portkey had been what he recognized as a punctured soccer ball. Though he figured here unlike in his previous life’s country they referred to it as a football just like his previous family would which made him smile. For a brief moment he wondered if either of his current parents would recognize the type of ball it was, but quickly tossed the thought away as his parents hated muggle culture so much they probably couldn’t recognize a simple pencil. His parents were unimpressed with the muggle collecting payment and did nothing to hide it, hesitating to even go near him.
Draco leaned into Seamus’s ear as to share a secret “Ireland will win but Krum will catch the snitch.” He pulled back and winked “Let's keep that between us for now.”
Finally at the marked location his mother pulled out a small pouch that definitely didn't seem like it should have been able to hold more than a handful of coins but with a flick of her wand, which he was sure she wasn’t supposed to be holding with a muggle not to far away, out came what looked to be a miniature palace made out of silk. It was over the top but still elegant Draco thought it looked quite nice until his father pulled out a second pouch and with a flick of his own wand pulled out a short iron gate surrounding the tent and filled it with live albino peacocks.
Mother was a lot younger looking for her age and had fully blonde hair instead of black blonde. Her eyes were a light blue and just made her look even more beautiful on her almost wrinkle free face. In his opinion she could have done WAY better than his albino peacock obsessed father. Even if his father’s family was filthy rich. Which by filthy he actually meant filthy, he now had the knowledge of the family history which confirmed that his family had never earned an honest wage before in any sense of the word.
“¡Ya pararse los dos!” (Stop it you two!) His mother yelled at them. “Miguel I need you to go to your tíos (uncle’s) store and get some more tortillas we’re almost out. Pero hazlo rápido ya está en camino tu papá (but do it quickly your dad is on his way home).”
After asking his mother to duplicate the map the muggle had given them Draco made his way to where some of the vendors were located. He noticed some familiar wizard faces passing by but wasn’t sure if his Draco memories actually remembered them. It was strange really, he knew he was Draco Malfoy and had been born as him instead of his soul recently entering his body but combining Miguel and Draco was so hard. They were both so different in race, culture, personality and beliefs. So much so that his whole existence and everything he’d been conditioned to believe was called into question. Plus he had to go through puberty for the second time or maybe it was the third time since he remembered future events too? Either way he was calling bullshit.
“Consider it on the house for a future reader of my work,” He winked. “Now I’ll be heading inside to work on a few things for the Quibbler. Why don’t you two stay here and chat.” He then waved and went inside his tent leaving Draco feeling awestruck.
“It’s not meant to be an insult really. I was just wondering if you’ve ever checked to see if you had an affinity for fire. Usually when things like that happen often it’s because of your elemental magic acting up due to under use. But you probably already know this since your mum’s a witch she probably already mentioned it. My mothers told me about it once before but it was way before my first year.” Draco paused to look at Seamus who instead of angry just looked confused. “I’m sorry I’m babbling on, it happens when I’m embarrassed.” Draco covered his face with his hands wanting to crawl away into a dark hole.
The last day before the tournament The three young wizards had to bid each other goodbye in case they wouldn’t meet again before school. It’d only been a few days but Draco already felt really close to the unlikely friends he’d made. He made Luna promise that she’d sit with him on the train to school mainly because he didn’t want her to sit alone and because he hoped that with the other Slytherins she’d build a strong friendship. He also agreed to stop by Seamus and greet him and his friends to get to know them too. He was really looking forward to meeting Neville Longbottom and seeing if the ass lived up to the namesake.
He opened the glass store door and was greeted by his pregnant cousin Alma. “Hey Alma where 's tío?” He asked, walking to the front counter.
Draco threw himself out of bed and to his dresser mirror. Silver eyes stared back at him before scanning his body for open bullet wounds. There were none. He needed to calm down. He was breathing hard and could feel the start of an oncoming panic attack. Sliding down head in his knees he focused on his breathing like Doctor Johnson had taught him. Who was doctor Johnson!?
The not ‘Dean’ nor ‘Thomas’ boy started to look angry again “My name is Seamus Finnigan”
Walking back to the tent felt like a bucket of iced water had been poured on him. It was almost time for the horrors to start. He started at the back of his fathers head feeling a hot rage building up knowing what evil deeds his Father would be getting up to tonight with his sick Death Eater friends.
Harry turned back to look at the stadium fidgeting with his own Omnioculars, “Maybe.” He mumbled, still upset and not really understanding why.
Draco felt his face flush from shame and embarrassment. Dean and Seamus are considered a really big ‘it should have been canon’ couple in the fandom. He sadly failed as a fan but he was going to blame his Draco memories because Miguel was relying on Draco to recognize people since they didn’t really look exactly like their actors. Who knew the one main thing that both boys had in common was their strong ability to forget names.
His father had the same eyes which meant it was probably a Malfoy bloodline trait. His features were more aristocratic with a strong jaw and pointed nose. Unlike his movie counterpart his hair was only slightly long and slicked back but not long enough for a ponytail. Draco had mentioned to him he’d probably look better if he grew it out past his shoulders but his father just said ‘I’ll keep that in mind’ which usually is code for ‘stop bothering me’.
Seamus still seemed upset crossing his arms in an attempt to seem more imitating, “What of it?”
The boy was in the middle of speaking before realizing just who had bumped into him. His demeanor quickly changed into one of anger “Malfoy” he said his voice like venom.
I'M SO SO SORRY!!! I really didn't mean for it to take me this long to update I had a lot of stuff happen in my personal life but I will update the next chapter way faster. EVEN IF IT KILLS ME!
“Seems Yansi was wrong. I did get my Hogwarts letter…”
Which when talking to himself and peeking through Draco’s memories he came to realize Draco might unknowingly have a small crush on the clumsy boy. Miguel will forever pick on Draco about it being so adorable.
Draco grinned nodding. “Of course it’d give me an opportunity to practice some fire repellent charms.”
They were seated at the highest point of the stadium along the side between the two goal posts. It was nostalgic in a way having the memory of Draco’s future where he was here before and Miguel’s past watching it on tv screen with close friends. His heart ached painfully remembering the friends he’d never see again. He tried his best not to think of the people he left behind as it was painful but it still managed to sneak up on him when he let his guard down. He turned back to his current parents that he’d ditched in favor of the magical view and almost bumped into the youngest Wesley.
Seamus looked as confused as Draco felt. But she was a smart one and Draco trusted her magical creature judgment. After all as far as he knew she was some type of magic creature seer. Seeing what regular wizards can’t. “Remind me to write that one down it seems interesting.” He said to Luna before refocusing on the boy in front of them. “In case you didn’t know, this” he gestured to Luna, “Is my friend Luna Lovegood she really likes magical creatures and is a year below us in Ravenclaw.” Luna seemed happy to be referred to as a friend.
Ginny turned to Hermione whisper shouting, “Did you see that!?”
Just when Draco thought the barrage almost over a new memory came to him. Unlike the others this one wasn’t a vision of his future but of a past long forgotten…
“Does Malfoy seem to be acting strange to you?” He asked Ron quietly.
He quickly made his way to the store wanting to get back so he could continue his book. Draco Malfoy had just been turned into a ferret by Mad-eye Moody who was as he already knew really Barry Crouch Jr polyjuiced as Mr Moody. Poor Draco, he was a git but he definitely didn’t need to be turned into a ferret and slammed around like a rag doll for it.
When they finally make it to the Minister’s Topbox Draco’s breath caught. The view was incredible; he slowly made his way over to the safety bar staring out onto the stadium. Harry’s description in the book nor the movie effects compared to the actual experience of being there in person. What looked like hundreds of thousands of wizards filled every seat dressed in their favorite team colors. The excited buzz of voices and singing filled the air as pregame advertisements seemed to write themselves on a large blackboard in neat cursive script. He could feel the magic pulsing around him; it was almost overwhelming.
“HEY WHAT ARE YOU DOIN!?,” the man screamed, trying to get closer to Alma.
“Draco, come” his mother’s voice called. She smiled at him gently. Like there wasn’t a courtyard full of Death Eaters ready to kill every peer he’d ever known with a flick of their leaders wrist. Against everything screaming at him not to, he slowly walked towards his mother's side. Not before he was stopped and lightly embraced by the most evil being to walk the earth telling him “Well done.”
After finally finding the vendors the two blondes
Seamus nodded to her holding his hand out for a shake to which she accepted shyly. “Nice to meet you. I’m going to keep your advice in mind for when we get back to Hogwarts. Would you mind if I asked you for help sometime?”
Seamus turned his attention back to Draco, “As long as he’s willing to be civil I’m willing to let him join too.
“Just because a lot of people have read it doesn’t make it less nerdy. Besides, not everyone who reads it dresses up in costumes as students to meet up at bars for trivia nights.”
“Maybe…” the two girls turned to stare at the young Malfoy who was fiddling with his Omnioculars ignoring everyone else in the room.
“Well yeah but he didn’t even acknowledge me. He’s never done that before.” Said Harry confused.
“That’s a brilliant idea if you two manage it I’ll print the copies for your book.” Mr Lovegood exclaimed excitedly.
“No It’s fine I didn’t know about that my Mum’s never mentioned it but I don’t really tell her about my small fires it’s a bit embarrassing to bring up really.” Seamus replied finally uncrossing his arms. “Do you know how I could check for something like that?” He asked curious.
Draco gave a smile back and turned to her father, “Mr. Xenophilius Lovegood publisher and editor of the Quibbler. How are you?” He asked the older Lovegood.
“Maybe he’s mad Slytherin lost the house cup again?” Said Ron.
“Must be the positive thoughts keeping them away. Would you like to walk around the area with me? I’m looking for some Omnioculars and hopefully some street foods, I’ll pay of course.”
Draco had been a coward before and so many had suffered for it. Miguel was apparently a Slytherin too even if his sorting had been through an app instead of the real sorting hat; but he died being a hero and protecting his cousin and her unborn child. Miguel lost his life once but he’d be damned if he ran away just because he was scared. Just because they were Slytherin doesn’t mean they can’t be brave too. They’ll just have to be more cunning about it.
Not wanting to look at the peacocks any longer, Draco instead went inside to find his room. A house elf already in the tent led him to what would be his sleeping quarters for the next few days. It was smaller than his actual bedroom at home but still quite large and even had its own bathroom. The decor much like the rest of the tent was dark colors and modern uncomfortable looking furniture which was actually quite comfortable when sat on probably due to some sort of cushioning charms. His room had a window that showed an enchanted view of a bright flowery meadow. After checking to see where his clothes were stored he decided to take some of his allowance and explore the camp grounds. If this really was the ‘Wizarding World of Harry Potter’ he was going to explore to his fan heart’s content.
Draco walked Luna back to her tent where they shared their snacks and drinked tea with Luna’s father. “We should meet up again tomorrow” suggested Draco, “I brought my art supplies from home. I’d like to try drawing nargles as you describe them to me. Who knows maybe we can make a book on undiscovered magical creatures. You’ll be the next Newt Scamander.”
Finnigan seemed confused by Dracos personality change but thanked him for the information anyways. He parted ways with them a bit after some more casual chatting then bid the two farewell before returning to his waiting family.
Miguel wouldn’t let him “Back off! She’s doing what you asked. She's pregnant and you’re stressing the baby!” He struggled against the man trying to stop him. Panicked the man shot twice. Realizing what he’d done, the man ran away.
Harry Potter was dead.
“By the way who are you two supporting for the tournament?” Asked Seamus.
Luna gave a small smile and replied back, “Luna Lovegood nice to meet you and yes I’m in the year below you, this is my Father.” She gestured to the older man beside her.
“Oh my dad’s back was hurting so I told him to go home while I watched the store today. Did you need him for something?”
Miguel reacted quickly putting his hands up and moving to block his cousin. “Please don’t shoot!” he begged, “she’s pregnant!”
“It’s called cosplay and I need to represent my house when showing those Ravenclaws who’s boss.”
“Excuse me, sorry I wasn’t paying attention.” He gave her a quick smile then went to sit with his parents unknowingly leaving a stunned Ginny behind.
“Dean?” Draco replied uncertain, he was panicking because the exact Scenario he was afraid of happening just happened. You see Draco never really learned all the Gryffindor names in his year. Sure he knew the names of Potter, Granger, Weasley, and Longbottom but he really didn’t find it important to remember anyone else’s name. Which now he was regretting because before this summer he wouldn’t have cared if he couldn’t remember a Gryffindor’s name but with his new conscience he was feeling really guilty. He was hoping with his past memories he could remember the guys name but sadly Miguel was even worse than him at names and could never remember who was who between this Gryffindor boy and his dark skinned best friend.
“We haven’t seen each other since leaving the train. I don’t know what he could be so upset with me about.” Harry replied frustrated. Things shouldn’t be this complicated with your nemesis.
This was not one of his father’s fairy tales though. It was a memory and it wasn’t. It was a future set to pass at the Quidditch World Cup this summer. Draco could hear the screams of tortured muggles and muggle-borns alike. Feel the wicked magic of dark curses zipping the air at unlucky targets followed by cruel mocking laughter. Unlike the Draco in this memory who was crackling with glee at the pain of fleeing mudbloods, The current Draco felt sick with shame and guilt at all the hatred filled chaos.
Miguel realized he was going to have to train Draco’s body to have more stamina off the broom if the burning in legs was anything to go by later. The regular exercise would do both of them some good. Especially if he was going to stop a war.
The boy looked confused, “I’m not Dean.”
After coming more to term with his reincarnation Draco had taken a good look at his surroundings including himself with Miguel’s point of view. He noticed he didn’t quite look like his movie actor nor did his parents for that matter. Yes he had the platinum blond hair he was known for but it was more wavy than he’d remembered it being. He was still tall and slender, in his other life he’d probably be described as a twink which was somewhat embarrassing but also a bit exciting as he was never this skinny before. He’s face was slightly different too, not as pointy as Potter liked to exaggerate, the bastard, he was actually a lot more handsome than his actor. No offense to Tom who was his teen and adult crush. But his eyes held the biggest difference. Dark silver not a hint of blue. It was a shade he’d never seen on anyone not wearing contacts before.
Luna seemed surprised for a moment whether it was because he knew what Wrackspurts were or because someone had finally asked her to hangout he couldn’t be sure. Luna agreed to join Draco then quickly let her Father know she would be walking around the area before they both set out.
His father called his name twice, gesturing his arm to come to his parents side. Draco ignored him instead glancing at the courtyard where he stood among his silent peers whose last hope was now laying dead at the Dark Lord’s feet.
“Well if you hadn’t been so absorbed in your nerd book then Mami wouldn’t have sent me to come get you” she huffed.
Lately his mother seemed worried about him. She always had a concerned expression on her face until she noticed him looking then she’d go back into the blank mask of indifference she always wore. His father didn’t seem concerned other than the occasional odd look. He just chalked it up to the incident back in France and gave it no more thought. After all he had more important things to worry about then weird parental behavior.
At the same time Harry Potter was having a small dilemma. Just a tiny one he insisted to himself. Nothing to be upset about at all. Barely bothered really. Everything was fine. It was just that Draco Malfoy entered the box, walked to the railing, not glancing at him once, then sat down after he was done, still not paying him any mind. Anyone else would think it was great that their enemy wasn’t bothering them but Draco had never out right ignored him before. It made Harry feel uncomfortable.
“Yeah…” Hermione replied slowly, her eyebrows scrunched together in deep thought. “Maybe he forgot your face?”
“Ok ma,”
He managed to avoid looking at Potter and his friends for the whole game but had noticed a small female house elf before the game started. Winky, Barty Crouch Sr’s house elf. Until tonight at least…
Hermione looked back at Ginny just as stunned as she was. “I’m still not sure if I just imagined it…”
“He apologized for almost running into me.” The redhead stated still in disbelief.
“Oh...Um sorry about that mate, you're the one that sets things on fire right?” Draco asked, searching his memory for something to change the subject to.
Draco was also a coward.
Draco was sure he looked as excited as he felt holding a real life copy of the Quibbler instead of the recreated ones he’d received in his geek box subscriptions. “I can’t possibly let you do that, let me pay you. I'd be more than willing to pay.” He began to reach for his money pouch but Mr. Lovegood stopped him.
made their way to the food first because priorities. Munching on pumpkin pastries and holding bags filled with sweet treats they looked over the available merchandise. Draco decided to buy a pair of Omnioculars for both of them along with a miniature Victor Krum for him and a Ireland hat for Luna.
Faintly he heard his mother yelling his name as the blood in his ears started to pound. Draco’s vision was blurry with tears he hadn’t realized were falling. His mother’s arms embraced him pulling him back onto shaky legs. When had he fallen?
Draco groaned in embarrassment his father always wanted to show off his “perfect” peacocks. He even had a shrunken album of them he carried around in his pocket he would pull out to look at when he missed them. Not only that but his father kept track of each one's birthdays himself but had to be reminded by the house elves about important dates pertaining to Draco and his Mother. So it shouldn’t have been a surprise that his Father brought them. Didn’t stop it from being utterly embarrassing though.
Passing by two familiar heads of long pale blond hair he paused. Looking at them closely the name ‘Loony Lovegood’ aka Luna Lovegood came to mind. She was sitting next to what seemed to be her father on a large patchwork quilt holding matching ‘Quibbler’ magazines chatting away happily. Draco was thinking about how weird they were but Miguel was freaking out with excitement. THE Luna Lovegood was just a couple feet away and she was real! How he longed for his phone so he could take pictures or maybe a marker for an autograph. He probably better off not having either because no one would understand just why exactly he was so starstruck but how could he not be when one of his favorite characters was sitting right in front of him. He wanted to jump up and down squealing. Draco wanted to simply walk away but Miguel refused and instead took over making his way over to introduce himself.
The same mark he knew so well from tracing it on the inner left forearm of his father as a tot. During which his father would tell him stories about as if tales of blood purity and the deaths of all non magical folk were beloved fairy tales.
“Nope just asking. It’s weird not seeing him here. My mom sent me out to get her some tortillas for dinner.”
“Well maybe he’s trying to play mind tricks on you? When Mum’s really mad at Dad she gives him the silent treatment and won’t even look at him.” Suggested Ron shrugging.
Luna who looked much happier than when he first walked over replied, “I think he was as excited as you to meet a potential reader. You look happier than last time I’ve seen you. Much less Wrackspurts hanging around you.”
A/N: I like to imagine that Miguel and Draco are two souls inside one body who like to constantly argue with each other. Miguel assumes most control while Draco sits back and critiques. They are one person but they are not, at least not yet.
Luna finally chose that moment to join the conversation as Draco removed his hands from his face. “The school library has a few reference books about it. But Madam Pumfy might be able to do a magic diagnosis to know for sure. If it comes back that you do then you're registered for it in the ministry as an elemental wizard. They aren’t very common so they try and keep track since it can be unpredictable at times but it’s the mark of a powerful wizard. You can even self study. But due to the presence of Infernojebogles around you it must be true. They prefer being around fire souls to play tricks.”
“Sadly no my father only lets me read boring things,” Draco rolled his eyes, sighing dramatically before continuing. “But if you have any extra copies I’d be more than happy to purchase one”
“Miguel! Mami is calling you!” His younger sister screamed, slamming his bedroom door open.
It was official, Draco Malfoy had gone absolutely mental. There was no other explanation for what was happening. One minute he was enjoying the feel of the French summer sun beaming down on his sunscreen charmed skin. Toes digging into the wet sand as he closed his eyes to breathe in the smell of the ocean one last time before leaving the calmness of his family’s private beach villa. In the next moment he opened his eyes and instead of the view of blue waters and clear skies he saw an expanse of black night marred by a symbol of hate and death, the Dark Mark.
“I’m not sure,” Draco said as he cast a tempus. It was getting late. Still early evening, but the sun was beginning to set.
Harry threw head back in a fit of pleasure and bucked his hips forward, causing Draco to gag. The blonde sucked at Harry’s cock, taking in the taste of him and losing himself in the action. Draco released Harry and looked at him with swollen, spit covered lips and a dark desire in his eyes.
Draco brought Harry’s lips back to his before answering his question. “Suck me.”
“Don’t act so innocent, Potter. One would think you would have grown out of that hero complex of yours but clearly time has just reinforced it. You aren’t the ‘Golden Boy’ everyone makes you out to be. You weren’t then, and you certainly aren’t now.”
Leaving Draco to tend to his wounds, Harry wandered down the hall, admiring the gothic architecture as he did. Intricate designs were carved in the woodworkings along the ceiling and down on the floor moldings, Candelabra wall sconces lined the hallway illuminating the space in the dull flicker of candlelight.
Harry stood from his chair and was out of the office as soon as Robards’ said they were finished. Draco let out a sigh of relief for not having to face Harry.
“The top floor, of course.”
Draco observed Harry under the dim lights of the club. His usual uniform of vigilante justice--an all black ensemble complete with auror quality robes and sturdy dragon hyde boots--was replaced by an old leather jacket, distressed jeans, and a fitted white t-shirt. Through which Draco was able to make out the outline of Harry’s incredibly sculpted figure.
The man nodded frantically then took off. Draco banged his fist against the wall in frustration. He’d had no leads, but he'd be damned if he let whoever did this get away.
“Can we go to the zoo again?” Teddy asked enthusiastically.
Draco smiled and shook his head. “Stay out of trouble, you two.” He said before returning to the stack of papers on the kitchen table.
“I inherited it from my godfather,” Harry clarified. “I only bring it out for special occasions.”
Ron scowled at Draco and looked as if he were about to charge when Robards burst through his office door. Saved by the bell.
Teddy fell asleep in Draco’s lap before the movie ended. Neither of the men went to turn it off once they noticed the little one had drifted off.
“Daphne tells me that you and Astoria have taken quite a liking to each other.”
“Perhaps not,” Draco laughed.
It was a special kind of love. One that Draco had been chasing, and thought he had found in Adriel. But here, back in Harry’s arms, Draco knew nothing else could ever compare.
He should have just let Harry go home. He wasn’t ready to deal with whatever it was that had happened between them. It was not something Draco wanted to talk about. It was a foolish thing for him to do and frankly he was embarrassed.
Teddy continued to laugh and buried his face in Harry’s shoulder.
Draco looked at Harry. He was silent for a while and Harry began to wonder if he should have asked before the blonde spoke. “During the death eater trials I was pardoned because I was underaged when inducted. That, and it was proved that I only did it because Voldemort had threatened to kill me if I didn’t cooperate. My father, however, wasn’t so lucky. He made a deal with Robards that he would turn in any death eaters the ministry wasn’t able to track down in exchange for amnesty. He still had ties with a good number of them. My father gave the names, but most of the remaining death eaters had offed themselves before the ministry could get a hold of them. Except for Walden Macnair that is. My father was responsible for his arrest and he swore vengeance. The idiot still held onto the idea that Voldemort’s work had to be finished, and my father stood in the way of that. When he was being shipped to Azkaban, a group of vampires attacked the prisoners. That’s when he was turned.
“If I knew you’d make me do excessive physical activity on my day off I would have never agreed to come,”
“This is ridiculous,” Draco mouthed the words to Harry.
“They could arrest me,”
Harry tore his glasses off and threw them across the room, not caring if they landed safely. His hands gripped Draco’s hair like it was the only thing keeping him upright and began riding Draco’s leg.
“I...I don’t know exactly,” Draco admitted.
A wave of pleasure rolled through him, and memories began to flood his mind. Memories originally thought to have faded long ago. Those memories were accompanied by feelings, some joyous and heartwarming. Others dark and painful.
Surely it meant nothing. Draco did his best to convince himself of this. But no matter how many times he shot down the idea, he wasn’t able to completely douse the flame of hope that burned inside him.
“I have a better idea,” Harry smiled and waved for Draco to follow him.
Harry came with a shout, painting Draco’s chest with his cum. The sight sent the blonde into a frenzy. A few forceful and erratic thrusts later and he emptied himself inside of Harry. Draco’s arms suddenly became too weak to hold himself up and he fell onto the bed beside Harry breathless and sweaty and reaking of sex.
“Like a baby,” Astoria said as she leaned back on the counter behind her. “You wore me out last night.” She smirked.
Draco crushed the note in his fist before tossing it into the fireplace and lighting it ablaze with his wand.
“And that means there’s someone else?” Draco really didn’t like the direction this conversation was going.
“Perhaps to start. But think about how many people you’d be able to meet while you fetch them coffee. You could make some important connections with your superiors that might lead to better and more permanent job opportunities.”
“Don’t try to talk your way out of this. Who is it?” Pansy pried.
Draco heard her voice begin to crack as she spoke those words. He felt a great sense of loss once he was finally alone.
“No.”
Draco’s first instinct was to fight for them, but he didn’t have the energy to argue anymore. He did know Harry was right and it pained him to admit it.
Harry’s demeanor changed when he returned with the blood for Draco. Not that he had noticed, with his focus solely on the thing in Harry’s hand.
“What about you?” Draco asked.
The tears in Draco’s eyes overflowed and formed a steady stream down his cheeks. He stumbled out of Harry’s house in a haze and aparated to his flat.
Draco kept the vial that had been in Adriel's possession during his untimely demise. Holding it close both brought him comfort and pain, yet it was as if being parted from the small glass vial he would completely fall apart. It felt as though it was the only thing keeping him tied to this world.
“No. Of course not.”
“Why don’t we discuss this further in the bedroom,” Draco pressed his body up against Harry with his hand on the small of the black haired man’s back, holding him in place.
“I’ll go get him settled,” Draco said quickly when he noticed Harry about to speak.
“It’s very...” Harry placed his box on top of Draco’s as he continued to look around. “You,” he concluded.
He filled the classes and offered Draco one, which he waived away. Draco felt a twinge of annoyance at the gesture, having clearly forgotten that Draco didn’t drink. Something that Astoria was always sensitive about.
“Potter? What are you doing here?” Robards’ words sent a chill down Draco’s spine. He didn’t dare turn around to face the other man.
“Bloodroot? No that’s not possible.”
Astoria’s hand snaked down to Draco’s throbbing member and she pulled him free. She stroked his length for a moment before guiding the head to her entrance and encouraging Draco to fuck her properly.
Days turned to weeks and he still hadn’t figured it out, but he was determined to do so. It wasn’t until he’d gone through the last of the books, the ones that he had desperately hoped would not hold the answers, that he had found it. It was his copy of (book of dark potions) that held the key. The description was identical and the (magical) scent that emanated from the page was that of the scent that clung to the vial. Adriel had been poisoned with bloodroot.
“At least they look at you in a positive light. People look at me and pulled their children across the street. People look at me and whisper foul things about my family. No matter what I do I can’t escape what I’ve done!” The guilt and shame from the life Draco had lived had always lingered in the back of his mind, but now they were consuming his entire being.
He was early and he hoped to Salazar that he wouldn’t see anyone who--
Harry had become a regular guest of Draco’s in no time. They’d spent many nights sipping their beverages long after the bartenders left for the evening, long after Malcolm escorted his female companion of the moment back to his and Draco’s shared residence, and even risked sunrise on some occasions.
“What? Who is it?” Harry asked from within. His footsteps leisurely approached them.
“Like I was just dragged from a burning building,” Draco answered.
“Maybe so,” Harry began. “But I know you.”
Sorry it took me so long to update but I promise this fic isn't abandoned! I'm just a procrastinator who has yet to master the art of work-life balance. Enjoy!
“Don’t waste your breath,” she started towards the door before turning to him one last time. “I really thought you were different, but clearly you were only interested in wasting my time.”
Just then, there was a flash of green light that illuminated the sitting room. Teddy hopped out of his chair and ran towards the source, Draco following close behind. Teddy jumped into Harry’s arms who caught the child without struggle. Something Draco had yet to master. He guessed being an auror also prepared you for the unstoppable force of a three year old.
It was something they had realized in their sixth year when Draco had taken the mark. It ignited something between them. It began as mutual understanding. After the sectumsempra incident they’d called a sort of truce. Almost as if they had finally realized that their rivalry wasn’t the battle they should have been fighting. This understanding grew into something that resembled a friendship. And then something more. Dark corridors and empty classrooms became their refuge as they explored this new intimacy. But as good things often do, it came to an end.
Harry looked up, seeming to have just noticed Draco’s presence. His expression softened slightly as his eyes scanned Draco’s body.
Draco silently stared at the wall in front of him, careful to avoid eye contact with Harry. Harry steadily took sips from his glass while he eyed the other man, waiting for him to explain himself.
Harry sighed and wondered if Draco would always be this stubborn. “Is there anything I can do to help?”
“Do you really want to know?” Pansy asked suggestively with a raised eyebrow.
Draco had barely heard Harry call after him as he pushed his way through the crowd. A part of him wished Harry would just fuck off so he wouldn’t have to face him. But the other part that was glad Harry had chased after him neglected to lock the door.
“Draco,” Harry whispered as Draco took one of the auror’s erect nipples into his mouth and sucked at it mercilessly.
Harry undid Draco’s buttons and zipper and shoved his hand down the blonde’s pants. Harry began to stroke him slowly. Draco threw his head back with his eyes squeezed shut. “Fuck,” he breathed through the wave of pleasure that radiated from his crotch.
“And exactly how long ago was that?” Harry asked, referring to the vintage clothing that adorned the man in the portrait.
“The Auror trainers can do whatever they want. The Minister is just a puppet controlled by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Whoever heads the department has total control over the entire Wizengamot.”
Draco raised an eyebrow at the gesture. “Are you really going to threaten me in my own club?”
“What are you doing here, Potter?” Draco asked, trying his best to convey that Harry’s presence wasn’t entirely welcomed.
“You live in a muggle neighborhood?”
He was not left waiting long, and Harry’s tongue lapped at his hole. Draco groaned deep into the pillow under his head and pushed his hips back, begging for more. Harry replaced his tongue with his fingers, which were coated in lube laced with his magic. Harry fingered Draco expertly, hitting all the right places.
Harry’s expression fell slightly at the subtle rejection. “Right. I should probably head out anyway.”
“Breakfast sounds lovely.” She replied and planted a kiss on his lips.
Draco knocked on the door to Robards’ office and pushed it open when he heard a voice from within inviting him inside.
“I’m fine,” Draco breathed. “I just need to feed.”
“Go!” Harry continued to push Draco.
Draco took a seat in one of the chairs in front of Robards’ desk and began to organize his files.
“The whole process was meant to turn us into cold, obedient and unfeeling soldiers.” Harry spoke again. “And it worked.”
“Well,” Harry mirrored the action leaving barely enough room for them to breathe without touching. “You might have to buy my silence.”
“Never mind,” he said as he walked past Harry and disappeared into another room of the house, but not before adding another thought. “At least I’m no longer the only one intervening in his pathetic attempts at suicide.”
“Harry, don’t be an idiot. It’s considered treason to willingly offer your blood to a vampire.” Draco said as he pushed Harry’s wrist away.
“You’re right, Teddy. He is boring today.” Harry said to Teddy.
Harry’s head fell back onto the wall and his legs became weak. Even so, he managed to meet Draco’s bobbing head with powerful thrusts and mercilessly fucked the blonde’s mouth.
“Can I help you?” Draco asked as he casually leaned in the doorway.
A fire suddenly roared to life, casting an orange glow throughout the room. Harry turned back toward the door to find Draco standing in its frame, placing his wand back into his pocket.
He stalked to the door and swung it open before glancing through the peephole to see who it was. A decision he instantly regretted because he was now face to face with a stunned Ron Weasley.
“No one.”
Draco melted at the feeling of Harry’s rough palms on his chest. It was a sensation that, until then, had only been a memory.
“Sorry you had to see that,” Draco mumbled with his eyes still cast downward.
“Don’t go!” Teddy’s eyes were filled with tears as he clung to Draco’s leg.
Harry led Draco to a narrow street adjacent to Decadence. There, a weathered black motorcycle was parked on the curb.
“Well – why not? As you said earlier, we do have to eat. Is there – is there anywhere you particularly like?” Now that he’d proposed the idea, Harry was starting to get nervous. Walking around Hogsmeade together was one thing, but sitting alone at a restaurant? That felt like something else entirely.
Malfoy left him at the Floo and a moment later, Harry was wobbling into his classroom. It was populated by many of the same people who'd been asking him daft questions before lunch that morning, and when Jacob's hand shot up he said, "Don't, I'm in no mood."
"Did I tell you what Ginny made me for dinner when I visited her in Oslo? While she was reporting on the Cup?"
“I mean it,” Draco agreed.
"You're bothering him, too," said Ron. "And in point of fact, 'Mione, you could do with a day of sitting about, as well. Harry's not the only one looking a bit ragged." He ducked, laughing, as Hermione threw a spoon at him. "Why don't you two working stiffs get comfortable in the living room, and I'll make breakfast before the baby's up from her nap."
Harry smiled grimly. “That hasn’t stopped me before.”
Malfoy's eyes flashed. "I'm not insulting your masculinity, Potter, I'm asking a purely physical question about what's keeping you from standing. Pain? Or weakness?"
"I'm... concerned about her. About her... her mental health."
Neville, who'd also seen his fair share of poorly-used levitation, nodded without further comment.
“You don’t need to check on me,” Harry said, very sharply. “I’m not your patient, Draco – I’m your bloody colleague.”
Harry, who still felt horrid for yelling at McGonagall, or Minerva, or whatever he was supposed to call her, had reevaluated their conversation and tried to take her (few) words to heart. She was not wrong that he could have, and probably should have, asked for a railing to be installed instead of silently stewing in his own bitter juices. So he rallied his nerves and asked if there were, perhaps, maybe, an alternate form of transportation that could be arranged for anyone not feeling up to making the long walk into Hogsmeade.
It was a voice Harry had once thought snide but now found full of quiet humor; a voice that poured through his body like a tonic.
Clearly, he was not going anywhere under his own steam. Even with his hatred of Mobilicorpus he'd have gladly used it on himself right now, if such a thing were possible, but at the very least he could send a Patronus to Neville, begging assistance. It was humiliating beyond all reason and Neville would probably report straight to Hermione and Harry would get a scolding, but right now a tongue-lashing from Hermione sounded like actual heaven compared to what was happening right now.
“Nothing’s happened to me, I’m absolutely fine, just trying something new to help me get about,” Harry recited tersely, and sat as far away from her as he could. “Malfoy, pass the potatoes.”
Harry winced. "I'm -- I wish you hadn't seen me like that in the first place. I feel terrible about it."
"Why on earth didn't you come to me? I assume you have a prescription."
Harry, as hesitant as ever to part with his wand, handed it over slowly, though he relaxed to remember how carefully Betsy handled it, with such respect and professional attention.
"No!" shrieked Silvia, and all three girls fell about with laughter. "No, that's not it, but thank you!"
"Harry, you look knackered," Neville said the next morning. He poured him a glass of pumpkin juice and slid it over. Harry nodded his thanks.
Harry thought he understood, now, what this ritual was intended to do. They were going to kill Malfoy -- and somehow, through Merlin knew what kind of arcane dark ritual, they thought they could take his magic and channel it into that teenage girl. Evie, in the white dress, looking lost and anxious.
They were walking along the grounds to the greenhouse so Harry could admire Neville’s new crop of Cute Snailwort, so-named, apparently, because they looked like very cute snails, which Harry was having trouble picturing. It was chilly and bright and smelled like turning leaves.
"But good news about the Floo, isn't it?"
“Hi,” he said to the person nearest him, a pretty dark-haired white woman in jeans and black cashmere, who was smiling at him in welcome. He tried not to look at Draco, though every instinct roared at him to act immediately, to knock out every one of these buggers and smash these chains and grab his friend and go. In practice he knew it would not be so simple. He smiled back down at the stranger. “I’m a bit late.”
"Exactly, good. And does anyone know the difference between the Leg-Locker Curse and the one I've got going now?"
Harry gave in. If Neville hadn't noticed by now that his arm was as buggered as his leg, well, no time like the present. He pushed himself back to his feet and took the cue in his good hand, moving round the table looking for the easiest shot. There -- the striped 9 was lined up pretty well for a corner pocket. He positioned his left hand gingerly on the table and, trying very hard to keep his balance, sank down as far as he could until his shoulder couldn't take it anymore, which wasn't very far at all, unfortunately. It didn't help that his one-legged stance was putting undue pressure on the joint to support him against the table.
“It might not be as bad as you’re thinking,” Neville said. “It might just be he’s really gone to get some venom.”
,” he said. “But we’ve maybe had a – a disagreement.”
“Fuck!” he roared.
“It’s not my name that bothers me, it’s – when you say it like that.
"I'll get out too," Harry said, letting his legs drift beneath him. If he was careful, it didn't hurt too much to kick, and he used his good arm to steer himself until his feet touched sand. Malfoy was looking at him, and Harry was beginning to recognize the different variations on his unsmiling smiles. This one was amused. "What?" Harry said self-consciously.
Harry, because he did not know what else to do, took the support that Malfoy was offering and made his clunky way down the steps.
you feel the need to explode.”
"Potter," he said slowly. "Do you make a habit of nonverbal spellwork?"
as hard as they could.
“Yes please,” Harry said fervently.
"How did you know?"
"Yeah," Harry said. "A swim sounds nice."
Harry had not thought about vibes, but he was pretty sure he did not want either of the first two. "I would prefer it look... quite normal?"
"Welcome home," she said, with that not-a-smile smile again.
He was still having trouble getting over the fact that Draco Malfoy was about to be his colleague. The last time they'd seen each other had been the last day of the Battle of Hogwarts nearly thirteen years earlier, and Harry would have been perfectly content to leave it there for the rest of his life. He probably would've managed it, too, if he hadn't been for what had happened last year. Sometimes he still couldn't believe how quickly his life had changed. Just eighteen months ago he'd been the top Auror in the department and a rumored shoe-in to become the youngest-ever Head Auror when Roberts retired; he'd been fast, and strong, and still a holy terror on the Quidditch field. Now he was staring down the barrel of a pity position in academia and tiring from being on his feet for more than five bloody minutes.
When they entered her shop they found Betsy busy with a customer, a very small mustached man who was speaking excitedly about his idea for a self-sorting bookshelf, but she waved at them with great enthusiasm and pointed them towards the back room. Harry followed Draco to the little room they’d been in before, relieved to have a moment’s sit-down before anything else. He lowered himself down onto the couch and bit back a groan of relief at getting off his feet, then dug into his pocket for a pain potion and downed it quickly, not meeting Draco’s gaze. He didn’t want to answer questions about how he was feeling, he just wanted to feel better. Draco didn’t say anything, bless him, and for a minute or two Harry sat back, eyes closed, waiting for his body to stop shouting at him, listening to the distant murmur of Besty and her customer and the soft sound of Draco moving around the room as the pain ebbed away.
"Thanks again for letting me stay the night," he said. "King's Cross Station would've been a nightmare to manage on this leg, not to mention the train itself."
Malfoy looked genuinely pleased, even allowing himself a small smile, no hint of a sneer. "I'm glad it's worked out so far. I'll fiddle with it and try to find out what's inducing the narcolepsy, it might be the poppy..."
As briefly as possible, Harry filled Ron in while he finished changing Rosie’s diaper on the living room floor. Harry found himself pacing as he spoke, an old habit, and forced himself to stay still, conserve his energy, though he refused to sit when Ron repeatedly offered him a chair.
Roberts smiled despite the fact that it was clear he didn’t know what he was meant to be smiling
“Good call,” Harry said. “I think my storming days may be over.”
Harry stood as straight as he could, wishing he was standing on his own, without the cane. He felt too-aware of how heavily he was leaning on it, too-aware of his left arm Locked tight down his side and across his stomach, one eye squeezed shut against double vision.
“No can do, bub,” the man decided, and Harry’s heart plummeted. “But I’ll call you a cab if you need it.”
There it was.
“Don’t worry,” said a low voice. “If he’s making things difficult it means he’s feeling like himself.”
Outside, the afternoon sun was bright and mellow in the little village. The Hog's Head -- and the passage to Hogwarts that Aberforth, after much persuasion, had agreed to let Harry use ("Once!") -- was only a few blocks away, and Harry's traveling trunk floated along behind him as he moved down the quiet cobblestone streets, so different from the busy London roads he was used to. He thought briefly of Grimmauld Place, left closed-up under Kreacher's care while he was away during the school year, and had to admit he wouldn't miss coming home to that dark relic of a house.
"But children..." Harry said. He was working something out and not liking where it took him. "Only powerful dark magic can make unHealable wounds. Who would -- who would curse a child?"
Something flickered across Malfoy's face but Harry couldn't read it. "Yes?"
"Potter," he said. Languidly, he replaced his quill in the bottle of ink. "What is it?"
There were five stairs up to the professor's table, naturally, and Harry took them carefully, thankful for the pain potion that let him appear at least halfway normal for a few hours. He knew his limp was still noticeable, but at least he wasn't the shambling mess that had greeted Professor McGonagall less than an hour before.
Draco needed...he wasn’t exactly sure. But before he knew it he was staring at a bronze number 12 set on a black door. It was clear to Draco now that he had hit rock bottom.
“Stop lying. Who is it? Would I know her?”
“Maybe I’ve changed?”
“Lead the way,”
“No.”
“Go make yourself useful. Wash the dishes or something. I don’t know.” Harry began to push Draco into the house.
Finished to his satisfaction (or at least enough to keep him stable) Draco whipped his mouth with the back of his hand and did everything in his power to not look up at Harry, even though he’d desperately wanted to.
“I’m sorry that happened to you,” Harry said after a moment.
“Are you going to be fun now?” Teddy asked looking up at Draco with his big brown eyes.
Harry looked at the building they were about to enter. “A bit small for you, isn’t it?”
“Draco! Wait!” Harry bolted down the stairs and across the main floor. He reached the back hall just as Draco was turning the handle.
“Draco,”
“Hm,” Draco thought for a moment. He was overwhelmed at the opportunity. He didn’t think he would be able to land a position that easily. Especially in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement of all places.
Sunlight peeked through the crack of the heavy black door as it swung open. Draco cried out in pain as the rays from the morning sun scorched his skin.
“Someone’s got to stop them.” Draco concluded.
Intending to take full advantage of their new location, Draco rose to his feet and threw Harry onto the bed. Their lips met again, this time accompanied by the glorious sensation of their naked bodies rutting against each other as a result of Harry wandlessly vanishing their clothes.
A deafening silence engulfed them. All Harry wanted to do was cross to Draco and take him into his arms. To take away his pain. To tell him that everything would be alright. Even if it was a lie. Draco’s passion was always able to weaken his knees, and when he expressed that passion for Harry the world around them disappeared. In moments like this Draco was the only thing that mattered. Harry had to protect him. If the ministry was attacking civilians, there was nothing they weren’t willing to do.
For fear of saying something he might regret, Draco simply nodded at the other man and retrieved his clothes. Once he was dressed he stopped at the door and looked back only to find that Harry was no longer in the bed.
Draco was on his third drink of the night. He wasn’t completely gone, but the alcohol did enough to help him relax. He’d been on edge ever since the other evening when Harry had seen him home.
“Right, well,” Robards’ spoke up clearly sensing the tension between them and pointedly avoided to address it. “No use in dawdling. Let’s get started, shall we?”
“You know what I mean,”
“I need to feel you,” Draco breathed.
Harry’s breath quickened when Draco’s hand began to make its way towards the waistline of his jeans. His delicate fingers swiftly undid the buttons and slid into his pants, taking Harry’s shaft in his hand. Harry gasped when Draco began to stroke him slowly. He was hard in Draco’s grasp when Draco pulled him free.
“Not today, Teddy Bear,” Draco replied as he looked over the case files for his first assignment. “It’s too cold out. We don’t want you getting ill.”
“No. And not that it’s any of your business, I actually came to inquire about employment opportunities.”
“I happen to do a lot here, thanks,” Draco laughed.
“Suppose I do look for a job at the Ministry,” Draco asked, entertaining the idea. “What would you propose they have me do?”
After running his plan past Robards it was easy to get his hands on a batch of Polyjuice Potion. And with plenty of his target’s more high profile customers in custody at the ministry, choosing an identity was just as simple.
They arrived at Draco’s house in just a few minutes. His bedroom was on the lower level of the house, underground and without windows.
