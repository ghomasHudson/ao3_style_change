"You think I don't know that?" Millie growled, voice full of so much singular resentment for that fact, Draco almost leaped away. "But I-" She looked to feel humiliated to confide so much in him. "What you said about me- going professional- I know you were probably just sucking up, and didn't mean it, but- I've thought about it too, I know it's stupid, but- I practiced all summer, and I've kept practicing at Hogwarts. Just in case there might be a chance someday-"
"A story for another time. I promise I will tell, then," Draco said airily. "So that leaves us to figure this out between ourselves. The seven of us, right here, right now. Gilderoy owes me so much, he'll follow whatever path I choose for us, so let's choose it."
"Is there any way..." Draco tried to look as pathetic as possible. "Any way I could stay over the summer with
from talking, though, and the summer had made Draco forget quite how annoying most of them were, convinced they knew everything while knowing so very little. Even Theo was little different than the rest in that. When Draco and the fourth-year girls regaled the boys with tales of selling the Quibbler at the tent city, he looked every inch the appalled high-class pureblood he was. "Why, Theo," Draco breathed in a suggestive tone, remembering the crush that the boy had seemed to develop for him in fourth or fifth year. He wondered if his different behavior in the red line had hindered or hurried it along. "What else is it you would prefer I be selling?"
"No, I want to dance a slow song with you," Harry insisted, with the growing dusk catching behind him like a diffused halo of blue. It was surreal how handsome he looked, his gleaming white suit still completely unsullied, every bit the figure of the Prince Charming even with glasses and messy hair, every bit the hero. It didn't actually make it any harder to turn him down. The last thing Draco wanted was to ruin the wedding by making a scene. Unless he was needed to, should Luna's still-pending attempt to dance with Neville backfire.
"What, Severus?" Draco said innocently, widening his eyes at his godfather. "Did I misspeak? I don't think I got any of the words wrong. Should I have said
"Severus," Draco tried to say. Severus didn't hear him. When he waved his hand before Severus's eyes, he didn't respond. Severus finished picking the leaves, pressing and storing them more efficiently than Draco had ever learned to do, and walked out of the greenhouse with a rapid tread, turning back towards the castle-
"Oh," Dorian gasped, hands to his mouth, covering very pretty flushed lips. He had somehow contrived to become lovelier since the start of fifth year, which seemed impossible. "I'm so sorry. I didn't know they'd passed-"
," he said all in a rush, and Black's face was worth every month of struggle and failing, to see his old dark eyes widen like that, and turn so very young again with hope. Almost like they had looked in Severus's memory, but there was no trace of cruelty in them anymore.
What does that mean?" He took a deep breath. "Malfoy, my mother's portrait... it was in tatters. I went into Grimmauld after your first visit, and found it bleeding and dead. That was you, wasn't it? Why? Why would you do that?"
"You're so, so, so good at those spells," Harry babbled inanely. "You're good at every spell, you can even cast the Disillusionment Charm now..."
Lord Nott. Natural thing, to look for a pureblood girl to wed as soon as possible, to produce a Nott heir..." Except if it was a rush, two years younger made Astoria a worse prospect than her sister Daphne. Whom Theo had
Draco wrapped his arms around himself. "Please, Severus, if you're angry at me, just leave me alone. I'll tell Remus or someone later, I can't stand it when you're angry, not you..."
"What the hell, Dobby? I told them about you saving me before you came, and they all listened. I thought they ate it up like you were a hero to them, and now they don't even like you?"
"No, just- I just wondered is all," Potter said, fidgeting, "Because you seemed so sure you were gay, so I thought you must have someone you fancy to be that positive. And he was pretty much the only male in the castle you willingly ever spent time with-"
"The Order- many of the Order, hurt, badly," Neville panted, voice audible as they neared, only a handful of steps from each other. "The castle... unconscious, lots of the members- still fighting there, could only find- Sirius and Remus, I found- fighting at my parents' side- told them- they insisted to come-"
authority on the subject. "My father told me stories from the first war when I was growing up, okay?"
"Potter?" Draco said with a shrug, "Potter wouldn't know how to spell his way out of a paper bag. I am hardly losing sleep at night worrying about what
But there was someone else, part of an entire Divination class who knew that Draco was lying about when he heard that prophecy by Trelawney. Draco couldn't tell whether he was close enough to hear them, but there was no missing who it was. The intruder was standing not far from them. He was almost hidden by a number of taller headstones, but Draco knew him even by his shadow, as he looked up at Harry guiltily and noticed something darker behind him.
It was a fight not to say anything. But he owed it to her to just listen, the way he had promised. He tightened his hold on her shoulders. She moved her face back from where she had been burying it in her own knees, and buried it in his shoulder instead. This close, he could hear the facade of eerie stoic calm was not complete, as she sniffled every now and then between words, if only from the cold.
Pansy held the cage as they walked out of the common room together, attracting some stares but no followers, which was good enough. Draco edged up towards Severus's office, remembering the story young Voldemort had told of first-year Luna robbing Severus's desk, and if she could do it he could, whatever new precautions had been instituted. Still, it was a heart-stopping few minutes leaving Pansy and the case outside his side, while he used his blood charm to sneak into the office and find Black's two-way mirror that Severus had confiscated. He used the latch Luna had, and got the mirror out, pushing it in his bag before he went out, and breathed a sigh of relief like he'd just been released from the Cruciatus curse when he saw Pansy still standing out there, keeping watch and holding the case with the rat in it.
"It will come back," Gilderoy said hurriedly, raising his hands and inserting himself between them. "I wouldn't have gone in if it wouldn't. Please, we'll just have to wait. In the meantime, let's get out of Nurmengard. Don't you want to see some other place before you die?"
Hufflepuff actually had fewer girls on their team than Slytherin, with their Chaser McAvoy the only one about, but between Vince, Greg, and Millie, Slytherin still managed to visibly be the larger team as they all soared up into the May sunlight. It was almost an out-of-body experience, how beautiful that Slytherin green looked on the emerald robes of Draco's team, as the Quaffle was let loose and Astoria, the youngest player in the air, was predictably the fastest to it. He swooped up higher, keeping one eye out for the gold of the Snitch and another eye cautiously on the rusty gold hair of the Hufflepuff Seeker Summerby, who'd somehow beaten him to the Snitch the first go around, when Hufflepuff Beater McManus had nailed him smack in the jaw just before a sighting. Just the memory of that day in the blue loop made the sight of Summerby a maddening one, making Draco long to waste time leading him in some wild feint liable to cause bloody injury.
Draco and Theo started spending far more time together, once Draco had unburdened himself to him about the talon wand. It was time spent in research, with Theo writing to Ollivander using Draco's name for any information he could get, and then scouring the library, about both wands and dark magic rituals. It wasn't as much as it might have been, with his extra time already divided up for flying sessions, extra potions lessons, and the secret brewing of Wolfsbane with Hermione. But his newly increased association with Theo was still an anomaly that Draco's friends noticed and regarded with suspicion, particularly Harry.
"I'm sorry!" Potter yelled, flying up to lean against one hoop with Draco between another, leaving them less than a meter apart. Even distressed and struggling for words, it was impossible to miss how Potter flew as naturally as walking or breathing, which just made him more despicable. "When we heard the rumor had spread, we were shocked. And maybe I should have gone to tell you right away, but I had to figure out how it happened- Draco, we didn't let out that you were like that on purpose, it just-"
"Run!" Severus ordered, and they all followed Severus's lead, the previously encircled combatants racing down from the stairs and literally over the Death Eaters' bodies as their final steps, Harry's shoe satisfyingly trampling the unconscious dark head of hair of Bellatrix, who it seemed Draco's spell had caught instead.
His realization that if he did go to the duel, it would have to be alone was enough to reinforce his determination not to show up. But then he found himself lying in bed past eleven, not noticing he was on his back, with the scars truthfully all but healed already from Severus's expertise. He was failing to sleep without pain as an excuse. Hugging Imoogi to his chest under the covers like he had as a child did not even make him sleepy. All he could think of was Potter's voice going,
"She has taken the Dark Mark," Severus informed him, and Draco slid off the bed to the floor and began to cry. Severus let out a snort of disgust, sitting down beside him to shake his shoulder roughly. "What did you expect, with her husband sent to Azkaban mysteriously missing a hand? Your father failed in his mission, and
"I need to tell you something, alright?" Theo said heavily, and that explained the unusual initiative taken in going after Draco in the kitchens. Draco's first hope was that Theo had found something out about the talon wand over the break. But if he had, he would have led with that, coolly smug in his own unimpeachable cleverness, rather than this uncomfortable skulking.
Draco's mood abruptly plummeted down lower than the dungeons. "I wouldn't want to leave your house if I had a choice, Severus. I wouldn't have wanted
," Father echoed, lip curling. "I knew this place was going to the dogs, but this is beyond the pale. No wonder Dumbledore was allowed to sneak back in unchecked after he had been removed. That will not stand for long." His gaze swept over them contemptuously. "Yes, we are due for more than a few changes around here." He looked towards the door, as if ready to stomp in, then looked twice at Draco and started. "What is that all over you? Is that
"And I want my own chance to see it," Draco said softly, "Champion," and pressed a kiss to Harry's cheek. "See, you might, maybe, just a little, finally... have
"I can't turn on Ravenclaw completely," Draco sighed, wording a betrayal of where his allegiances truly lay, whatever color of tie was around his neck. Even if they'd never gotten close, he really was grateful to his dormmates. If only for putting up with him during this year's mental breakdown. But more than that, turning his back on Ravenclaw would feel like a betrayal of Luna, who remained firmly enough behind her own house to render Neville's loyalties murky- however much she urged Draco to root for whoever he truly wanted to win.
Dantanian began to walk again, not towards the train but Hogsmeade. Lamia looked dubious but followed. "Don't worry," he said casually, "I'll make sure you get home. I just have something to show you first."
Draco was left drained himself over the next day, though he still made sure to make an appearance at their library table, hugging Luna every time he saw her. He found it hard to focus that night at extra Potions with Severus, but at least he had some very interesting potions to distract him. The problem was what that distraction ended up teaching him.
By the afternoon of the 27th, he had gotten his third book out of the Restricted Section, and was looking forward to reading it slowly and carefully. He had an unusual spring in his step, only to collide with someone waiting outside the library, which sent the book flying from his arms.
"The third and final task will take place at dusk on the twenty-fourth of June," Bagman said, to give Draco just one more damn thing to panic about. It was the only thing that should properly be on his mind. "The champions will be notified of what is coming, precisely one month beforehand." Or Draco could just notify Harry the next time they were in private, if he could come up with a good excuse for knowing. "Thank you all for your support of the champions."
if it's the wrong one- or I ruin Dumbledore. I do as much damage as I can. Unless this letter has you shocked enough that it turns out, that's what you'd want too."
"Clearly," Father said, looking over at Mr. and Mrs. Granger. He seemed primed to insult them, before remembering he had let his own son spend a week visiting them. Draco just prayed the Grangers had more sense than to greet Draco here.
Talk about a celebration of freedom. Sirius had been freed from the specter of Azkaban. Could Draco have been freed as well, from the unwanted affections of Pansy Parkinson? He would happily toast to that.
I know how that feels, alright? I know how it feels to have so much dark in your past, you feel like you're neck-deep in filth and no one would ever want to touch the face they see, if they knew what everything below it is caught in- I know how it is to feel your skin is like poison and other people must be blind not to see it, like the things you believed in turned you to something irredeemable. I know how it feels to think you're too ruined to be any good for anyone else anymore- but that's not

An orphaned fifth-year without any place to go. It would have been a horrific abuse of power- would have been enough to make you a monster- even
"No, Draco," Severus said softly, and squeezed Draco's shoulder. "Whatever personal issues will always remain between myself and Black, this is a war. He
"Granger, you're Muggleborn," Draco hissed, and she reacted to that no more insightfully than if he had proclaimed she was Hermione Granger. "And I'm a pureblood. Both my parents are from lines of wizards going back centuries and centuries. Houses Malfoy and Black." Again, no reaction. "Don't you know what that means?"
"I remember binding spells," Harry said confidently, and Draco rolled his eyes. "I do. What, do you need proof?"
And just as Draco had suspected, that did the old bat in good. "Of course," she croaked, with a tear glimmering from her eye, and Draco bit his tongue to hold back laughter. "Of course, I realize this has all been hardest on the friends of those who have been... I quite understand."
Ron snorted and put the brooms back in their slots with two clean smacks. "Oh, yeah. Suppose it's one of the hazards of cursing people. People start getting around to thinking you might, you know,
"That was funny, wasn't it, Theo?" Draco tested. "Professor Snape's face when I kissed you at the Christmas tree this morning?"
Meanwhile, Draco was prowling about less circumspectly. It took him mere seconds to find a suspiciously secure-looking and non-dusty chest in one of the antique cabinets. He appeased the talon wand- or Dantanian, he tried to settle the nerves that rose in him at the thought it could be Dantanian fucking Noir himself who breezily unlocked the cabinet and then the chest for him. There were several carefully packed layers of Potions vials, dozens and dozens inside.
I didn't choose to love her, I couldn't help it. I hope someday you will understand and that we can be friends again. I wish you all the best, in your match and in life.
He showed Millie and Pansy his list of attendees before taking them out into the cornfield, under one of the many strings of lights. He conjured bluebell flames to follow above them, then a large, lavish set of cushions to sit on atop the dirt paths. In truth, at such a massive, nearly all-Gryffindor event, he too found himself more comfortable in the present of other Slytherins. They could go back when the official part of the party happened, and Sirius's freedom would be toasted at sunset as planned. But for now, it was more peaceful than he could believe. Especially when Millie began to tease a blushing, genuinely smitten-looking Pansy about how much she and Blaise had been hanging out over the summer.
Voldemort got out Wormtail's Dark Mark, which he showed far more interest in than Wormtail's sobs. "It is back," Voldemort said softly, "They will all have noticed it... and now, we shall see... now we shall know..."
Hagrid came tearing into their part of the woods like Wormtail threatened with the Cruciatus curse. "Neville? What'd yeh do that for?"
They'd told the other guests to arrive half an hour after the Longbottoms, to give them time to adjust before overwhelming them with more people. The Floo had long since been declared unsafe, so they arrived chauffeured from St. Mungo's by a jumpy Mundungus. Dumbledore and McGonagall would be taking a Portkey out of Hogwarts, and Dumbledore had sent a Portkey of his own making to Xenophilius Lovegood as well. Thus it was just twelve people standing there awaiting them at six that night, not that twelve was a reassuringly small number. Then Mrs. Weasley barked at all of them, sending the children out of the way before retreating to the kitchen, telling Sirius and Remus that as the hosts, they should welcome the Longbottoms to their house alone at first.
Luna still hadn't finished getting ready, but the effect of the Marie Antoinette dress on her was genuinely stunning already. She would show up every girl at that ball, and if she hadn't earned Pansy's eternal enmity before, she would in
The beast slid, the front of its coils slipping in the sticky red pool over shattered stone. But Draco was slipping too, shoes skidding. He could never have imagined so much blood.
"I do not have the Resurrection Stone," Albus exclaimed, the very picture of amused innocence. "I truly know nothing of the Deathly Hallows." It was harder to seem a good actor, when the listener knew how very much you were just acting.
Harry was there in the Room of Requirement, sprawled out across the blue silk sheets looking pensive. His thoughts, for once, did not seem to be full of Draco. Instead, they were ones he babbled out right away, before Draco had the chance to deliver any life-shattering revelations. Apparently- before Draco had seen Dumbledore, so he couldn't ascribe it to that- Dumbledore had given Harry a mission.
"Draco? Luna?" a voice behind them asked. Draco cast a Lumos to see. Then he looked up wiping his eyes, to see Harry Potter standing above them like another angel, in a dark puffy coat, with two more dark puffy coats in his arms. "I'm sorry to interrupt. I just- you never came inside, and I thought if you were going to stay out like this at night, you'd need a jacket-"
"Don't worry, Draco, he won't hurt you," said Luna, nudging the body with her foot. "See? Everything is going to be alright."
Father had perhaps never looked at Draco with such disgruntlement. As the summer months had stretched on, though, Draco had not just found his early contempt towards his father loosening its biting grip on him. He had also found the degree to which he could make himself care for his father's moods lessening as well.
Severus looked halfway between accusing Draco to be a liar and questioning his own sense of reality. "Padfoot was Sirius Black," Severus said slowly, "The nickname one might have expected to hear spoken at the Manor, as the betrayer of James and Lily Potter. Prongs was James Potter's nickname, and Wormtail was Peter Pettigrew."
to, that she was the only one who could get in, because I blasted Aunt Bella off the family tapestry, and that blocked her- I'm going to have to blast Father and Mother..."
He didn't know if those were questions that could be asked separately anymore. The wand didn't answer, but when he stroked his fingers over, tracing the bend in the wood, there was an unmistakable comfort in it.
him... maybe because there was something possessive about it, an intimate way to keep hold of him. Harry was not going to let him go, and Draco didn't want him to...
know the truth would bring nothing but more destruction upon him, and want to protect him, every instinct in his body telling him to get out of here, even if it meant running right out over that sheer drop-
Draco snorted. "Idiot! Just because I'm better at not showing how I feel all the time than Harry Potter, human distress signal-"
"Yes. From my mother. This is the Antipodean Opaleye," Draco said, and laughed hollowly at Theo's Severus-like drawl of
Smith looked over at his fellow Hufflepuffs, but they were all frozen, looking as petrified as in second year. Then he glared at Draco viciously and sprinted out. Draco had expected, perhaps even hoped, that a Hufflepuff exodus might follow. But they all sat there with their big eyes gone so wide they looked like house elves.
Draco looked up and saw Theo standing over them anxiously. He hadn't known Theo knew how to get into the kitchens, but in his experience, Theo
"I had to do that," Palmer insisted, looking truly guilty. "I knew the Muggles would find her first, and they took you away before the wizards knew one of their own was dead. So I thought the wizards would see all those- those blood and bones- and think her son's body must be part of that pile. I didn't- I killed her the quickest way I knew. I didn't hurt her at all, until- after."
So they skipped breakfast and climbed up straight to the Owlery, where they waited for Viktor Krum. He soon came up to write a letter, with an eagle owl awaiting him to carry it that looked almost as gloomy as he did. "Viktor," Luna said, "Hello," and Krum stared at her blankly.
"The total eclipse," Grindelwald said, with his Austrian accent thick, the aesthete showing in the emotion in his voice.
"Blood traitor!" Kreacher snarled at Sirius, then turned back to Remus with grim satisfaction. "Werewolf! Nasty half-breed
- Severus, who somehow had the grace not to throw this in his face, just pat him bleakly on the shoulder and sit beside him on his own office floor, indulging his useless godson, after Draco had the temerity to not only risk his godfather's life but have a bloody fit about it...
kind. They'll look down on you for your birth and call you a Mudblood, and you'll be lucky if they don't do worse."
On an impulse, Draco raised his wand to the Snitch and concentrated. Its material wasn't that different from ones he had transfigured for jewelry before. There were enchantments woven into the very fibers of it, but protections of that sort never seemed to do much against the talon wand. He remembered the display Lockhart had made for Severus, and the gardens at the Manor. Then with an ease he smugly exaggerated, he transfigured the Snitch into a long-stemmed golden rose, each individual petal delicate and distinct.
He should just be grateful the silvery lines of scars Potter had left on his body that year hadn't followed here too.
When the grave was filled, Draco started trying to pat it in, but Periander stopped him. "No," he said, reached into his robes, and withdrew a small opaque black jar. He uncapped it and gave it to Draco. "Fill this with the grave dirt. Pack it tightly." Draco obeyed, watching his hands get muddied with it. Periander closed the jar and handed it to Draco, then ran his hands over and packed in the ground himself. Draco stared fearfully at the jar in his dirty hands, before Periander barked to him. "Up! We're going." Draco stood.
"Malfoy... clever Malfoy boy..." Wormtail pleaded. "You understand... you know that world... you know how frightening
are you going to convince the Order it would be worth interfering, to get Lockhart's help with your uncle's castle?" Draco was met with the unfamiliar sensation of Ron making
"No, you're perfect," Draco said dismissively. "You look more Harry Potter-ish that way. Humble defender of the downtrodden. I'm the one who has to look pureblooded as fuck." Harry did not seem to relish the idea, especially after Draco led them in with a haughty nod past the goblins. The famous inscription against thievery was inscribed on the silver doors past the bronze ones, which Harry eyed fearfully and Draco ignored. He didn't need anything making him more nervous than he was already. Not that he intended to let Harry or anyone here see it for a second.
Maybe he shouldn't have been quoting a Muggle playwright on the stand, but then, Umbridge shouldn't have been wearing pearls that shade of pink.
The only hitch in Draco's newfound sense of calm- the Second Task scared Draco far less than the first, despite the theoretical risk to Hermione in it- was the story the Gryffindors told him of Rita Skeeter nosing around in one of their Care of Magical Creatures classes, as if she couldn't have just watched in beetle form. Draco did have a vague memory of some pointless saga with her writing an article smearing Hagrid, and Hagrid having a meltdown and refusing to teach for a while. He remembered being fiendishly gratified at the time, none the least because it was hard to think of anything further beneath the dignity of a Malfoy than handling Blast-Ended Skrewts. When he looked through his fourth notebook, though, it apparently hadn't seemed important enough to merit a mention anywhere.
"PROTEGO HORRIBILIS!" Draco screamed, and the shield that came up around him was clear at first, and shimmering. Then the stunners hit it, turning the transparent film in the air a lurid red- and Draco's magic swelled up like a pit of escaping shadows, turning the shield black, a second before Draco's hand
Before taking his bath, he took a Polaroid down off the wall to sit with him. He had his long angel's infusion then, with the one picture of Harry Potter with him, to sit beside him on the rim of the tub. In it, Harry was still and unmoving and confident, in his Triwizard champion robes with Draco a nervous wreck fussing over him to the side. Hermione had taken it before the First Task, and if Draco folded over the half with him on it, that was the beauty of Muggle photos. He could erase himself, without fear his image would just cross over to the other side to get nearer to Harry again.
And the spiders did not seem to like the sound of that, making all sorts of deranged clicking sounds and rustling about, and it chilled Draco's blood when he realized:
He practiced a lot of other spells after to wipe the slate clean, should the wand be checked for some reason for past use. He would soon have his own wand back in this time, the old reliable unicorn hair one. Earlier than the last time, since the change he had managed to prevail on Mother to make was to let him go to Ollivander's first- ostensibly out of over-excitement to get a wand- and thereby avoid Potter at Madam Malkin's. He wouldn't be using either wand in this time period for very long. And yet with each hour that passed as an undetected intruder, it felt more irrationally vital for him to be capable of defending himself.
The red light of a Stunning spell came from Severus, felling Mother cleanly, and she fell. Not, though, as Draco's heart desperately feared, into the water. Just onto the stone, where she collapsed, slumped over herself with her bright blonde hair like a felled banner. The elf Stunning spell sent Theo's way by Dobby was less successful, as Theo hit the floor, crawling rapidly to the side out of the line of fire completely. Draco shot a spell in his direction that fell short, hitting someone in the heap of dazed Death Eater bodies, and Theo's gaze lifted in a panic of his own now, locking onto Draco's.
"You loved her," Draco observed carefully, "Even with what she was. Her limits. You loved her anyway."
"Tell him that," Grindelwald insisted, and Draco nodded. "Use his curse, so none blame you, Kaktusblüte. Make sure when you cut me open- cut me deep," he said, and Draco's trembling hands raised.
Severus remained deadpan as he opened the present, a book on rare poisons from sub-Saharan Africa, though Draco knew he was likely quite interested, unless he happened to already have it. He stayed just as level when he opened Draco's first two presents, an expensive new pair of dragon-hide gloves and a book on recent developments in spell creation theory.
"Only Muggles talk about brunch," Draco said with nervous energy, stalling incoherently. "Mrs. Granger goes out and brunches with her lady friends. You know all about football too- how do you always know my Muggle references?"
Before then, though, there was Hogsmeade on the sixth, making it vitally important that Draco had gotten out of his sickbed when he did. Once again, he had to beg off his non-date with Harry in the name of stealing supplies for the 'Wolfsbane', and Harry accepted it to help Sirius and Remus, though he looked let down. Draco would have come up with some other excuse to cancel, though, even if he didn't have to get the ingredients for Naufragiam. He was well aware that he couldn't carry on with his plan of ignoring Harry's feelings, feigning continued ignorance, and avoiding being alone with Harry until the end of time. But he'd cross that bridge when he came to it. For now, illegal Apparition to rob his own parents. Normalcy.
Draco had been prepared to threaten Potter and Weasley with a Langlock curse of their own, should they use their own tongues to speak of him, let alone
"Take your time, Draco," Severus said dryly, "Whenever you're ready," and reopened his book, a morbidly interesting-looking tract on ancient poisons.
you're the one who figured out a plan for the Department of Mysteries last summer. And of course, the supreme death blow to the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets that was the
"Is that bad?" Harry said softly. "You called me that once, remember, when you were pretending to be..." He broke off before saying the name. "What should I call you, then? If you meant it, when you said you love me, then I want to call you at least one name like that..."
Severus ignored Gilderoy as if he hadn't spoken. As did Draco. "Here," Draco said, fishing out the talon wand and throwing it forward, only just out of his own reach. Severus made a show of knocking it with his foot, without really putting it much further from Draco. He was unharmed, before turning back to the Death Eaters and returning to Bellatrix's side.
Severus let the door fall shut behind him, with a rather louder slam than Draco hoped he had meant. "Very well, then, formidable godson-"
Dantanian pushed the door open with his foot. His sole tread on his grandmother's white hair on the hardwood, as he stepped in past her. Then he went over with the calm of a man who believed himself unimpeachably in the right, and began to gather his father's paintings.
Sirius Black or Harry Potter. "I would much rather see him hang," Severus said coolly. "That's why I set the Dementors on him. But I've been asked questions about that night, so I'll answer them truthfully."
Together, the six of them sat down under the tree where the presents had been, and watched Sirius pull Remus to the center of the room, in front of the decorations and the roaring fire, all the guests in the living room with their glasses of cocoa or something stronger. Neville's parents were on the couch beside Shacklebolt, Tonks, and Moody, the latter two of whom looked three sheets to the wind already.
"I take it," Draco said dryly, looking Aberforth in the eye to show himself unflinching, "That history has held more successful patriarchs."
"He did not get the Stone, as you must have gathered. But you will surely soon hear the story in more detail from your little friends." Severus frowned at the face Draco made. "What, boy? You told me on the first day of term that you had no friends. Do you still hold that to be true?"
She paused dramatically, until a crestfallen Neville and Draco leaned in obligingly, and she whispered, "You see, I wasn't sure until after the article that came out about Sirius and Remus this summer, but our new friend Rita here is an unregistered Animagus..."
You have received a declaration of formal enmity. You will have seen the demands it entails to have this enmity reversed. Should it not be reversed, there will be things that even a father cannot protect you from.
"Champions die," Dumbledore corrected mildly. "Draco, it is quite simple. You and the other three will be taken hostage by the merpeople in the Great Lake. It will be the job of each champion to save their own hostage. You will be unconscious for the whole process, but will see and breathe again perfectly fine as soon as you are above the water."
"The past," Draco said, a strange enough answer to get their attention. "That is, the fact that I, unlike the rest of you, know actual Death Eaters, and how they operate. And I'm telling you, this isn't going to be fatal."
It had been Ron's idea, naturally, always the one to think of practical things. It had been for the football matches, and the natural fear that going somewhere so public, away from Britain and all his friends, would be unnecessary exposure for Voldemort's nemesis par excellence. Space from Harry didn't mean Ron didn't count Draco his friend. The very day Harry and Draco fell out so spectacularly, Ron came to him with a very nervous suggestion.
Draco turned back without thinking, diving with the breakneck tunnel vision of a Snitch catch towards the falling form of his godfather. Severus was like a great dark raven with its wings cut, stunned and slamming down against every branch on his way down. Draco caught up to the billowing black blur before it hit the ground, only just, but the added weight of yet another grown man made all three of them fall rolling off the Nimbus 2001, in a great burst of faded old rotted autumn leaves from the forest floor.
Except he couldn't sleep that night, thinking about the blue loop, of everything he knew of Buckbeak. He'd written that Sirius Black was rumored to have escaped on the Hippogriff, the day he had been captured and broken out of Hogwarts. That was presumably what had saved Buckbeak in the nick of time, Black's intervention, on what Draco was sure was the same day as the scheduled execution, because he'd taunted the trio and Hermione had punched him in the face over it.
"It is not," Severus said crisply, "That simple. Nothing is that simple." He took Draco's shoulder with no fear for the weapons in his hands, and led both him and Gilderoy out, room after room, until they were out of the very flammable library tower, and into the midday air. It felt hideous to be in so much sunlight.
Draco only realized they had misunderstood when he got off their carriage first and offered Theo a reflexive hand off, only for Theo to recoil from it like Draco had been wearing his snake watch and it had sprang at him. With the Chamber of Secrets reopening and snakes a live issue, Draco had thought it politic to hide away that enchanted snake watch, given its tendency to uncoil and even hiss at times. But even without it, Theo jumped back like a venomous viper had started upon him.
Draco shrugged lackadaisically, too proud of himself and his incredible strategic thinking to feel much shame. "Well, Professor Snape knows I'm already a skilled potions master, you know?" He was drawing stares where he was standing, summoned to the Gryffindor table at dinner by an apoplectic Granger, but Granger ought to get the chance to be impressed by him as well. He shouldn't be gloating, but it was rare any of his plans ever came off this well.
Sunrise, Harry had said, but that was a vague unit of time. It could have meant anything, and that had Draco sitting there waiting out beside the Great Lake for a very long time. Although that wasn't entirely Harry's fault. Pitch blackness at four in the morning could hardly be considered sunrise by any objective adjudicator. But Draco hadn't wanted to miss a second with Harry if he could help it. At least he had the Marauder's Map to monitor the Harry Potter dot with. He watched it sit there still in Gryffindor Tower for far too long, until it felt liable to drive him mad, but then finally, the map showed Harry beginning to move.
"And now, it is late," Dumbledore was finishing, "And I know how important it is to you all to be alert and rested as you enter your lessons tomorrow morning. Bedtime! Chop chop!"
"That's right, Gilderoy," chipped in Sprout. "Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?"
The fallout from the Quibbler didn't begin until tomorrow. Whispers had already begun to circulate that Sunday. When they brought the issue to Hagrid to show him that evening, he'd already heard about it. But Umbridge looked unworried at supper that night, cheerfully tormenting Trelawney as always. The next morning was a different story, as she looked self-righteously vicious even before a torrent of owls descended over the Gryffindor table, jockeying to deliver letters to a newly notorious Harry Potter.
"Well, yes- alright, then, I'll, um, I'll go to the ball with you if you'd like," Hermione said, very stiffly. She reached out and actually
"Dantanian." Phineas leaned back in his chair. "I am sorry, but your blood is full of filth. If you think I feel ties of kinship to you, you are as unintelligent as your grades would suggest." His words did not seem calculated to hurt Dantanian's feelings. It was rather as if emotion had never entered the equation. "Take the gold and go on your way."
It was a last narrow staircase on foot, from the top landing to the tallest place in Nurmengard. Even flying rather than walking, Draco was rather exhausted by the time he reached it. So he checked his watch and leaned against the half-intact banister, musing absently over the comically excessive number of those armor things lining every landing on the way up, until he had his breath fully back. Then he withdrew a small compact, surveyed himself, wiped or spelled away any dirt or perspiration, and fixed his hair and clothes to perfection, before he made that last climb.
"As well as the cosmos, I was going to say." Dantanian gave him a playfully judgmental look. "Meteorology means the study of weather. Not astronomy, or
"I don't deserve this," Sirius said suddenly, looking like he wanted to rip the ring from his hand. "It's a
you, Ron?" Draco scoffed. "Oh, hardly. Not even close, you sister-obsessed simpleton. You're lucky you haven't been downgraded from Ron back to Weasley."
"A person awakens with two husbands. How do they decide a rightful husband?" asked the Ravenclaw eagle.
At first, he got more studying done, with his library table's usual occupants off at Hagrid's hut. He heard bits and pieces about it, though, almost regretting his decision to absent himself when they enthused over watching the creature hatch. At some point around the turn of the year, though, imperceptibly, he had decided to take a unilaterally passive approach. Granted, trying to blow up the Mirror of Erised with every spell in his arsenal was hardly adhering to that philosophy. The passive approach did tend to strain if Draco got angry. But he was passive about the dragon, up until he heard Hagrid had named the beast Norbert.
There were steps coming from the high table, Severus's voice yelling something, but Draco had his shield up, and had to see what it said. Written in jagged, scratch-like handwriting instantly recognizable, the ink looked to be blood, just as in tradition:
The green light never reached Voldemort. He stepped aside, or dodged, or flicked his wand and moved a face in front of his, Harry too low to the ground to be used- but Wormtail, Wormtail was there right beside him. Draco would never know which one it had been, and Wormtail never saw it coming.
And yes, Draco has definitely regressed a LOT to a childish mindset, depending on the situation he's in, while also having traits and memories that no child should have to have. The fact that he's not fully aware of the effect that living as a thirteen-year-old in a thirteen-year-old body has on him, his maturity, magic, hormones, etc., just makes the effect more pronounced ^^ pobrecito ;)
"And what do I get, another Arsenal hoodie?" Draco spat. "Except no, your father withdrew that invitation after he saw what
But this wouldn't be like Malfoy Manor, nothing like the past. Harry wouldn't have to try and fail to save anyone in this cursed place. "I don't doubt you. I doubt you less than anyone, even Luna, because-" He found he did, and then he understood where his simple faith came from. "Back in my second year, Dobby, when everyone thought I might be the Heir of Slytherin, except for my godfather, and even he wasn't speaking to me- it was you, Dobby, you were the only friend I had in the entire world. Without you, I would have been completely alone."
"You weren't WHAT?" Hermione shrieked. "Was it Theodore Nott, do you think? But he isn't half as smart as you!"
, he would have been bitter, but two of the other three were the boys' bloody Yule Ball dates, not their friends. Delacour just didn't like Roger Davies enough- and Harry
Riddle laughed his high laugh again. "It was my word against Hagrid's, Harry. Well, you can imagine how it looked to old Armando Dippet. On the one hand, I was Tom Riddle, poor but brilliant, parentless but so brave, school Prefect, model student; on the other hand, big, blundering Hagrid, in trouble every other week, trying to raise werewolf cubs under his bed, sneaking off to the Forbidden Forest to wrestle trolls. But I admit, even I was surprised how well the plan worked. I thought someone must realize that Hagrid couldn't possibly be the Heir of Slytherin. It had taken me five whole years to find out everything I could about the Chamber of Secrets and discover the secret entrance... as though Hagrid had the brains, or the power!
Draco raised a hand as if in class, and with a frustrated sigh, Severus called on him. "Should I start Vanishing them, sir?"
Severus's eyes found the distinct bent shape of the talon wand in Draco's pajama pocket.  "Your mother informed me, the morning after the cup final, of your misadventures with the Weasleys. Now, she has written to me that the damage you underwent is more lingering than she would have hoped. I am here to consult as to the pitiful state in which my godson has managed to plunge himself, before he appears to all and sundry on the Hogwarts Express, and besmirches the good name of his godfather by passing out on the train like some common
His playfulness was at odds with his own genuinely impressive guise, with his powerful frame well-displayed in a tailored all-black Muggle suit, set off by a hooded long black robe flowing around him. What was menacing was the stag mask, covering his entire face with the horns pushing forward as if reared to stab someone, leaving room for the hood in the back. The mask was intricately carved in a realistic style, but in red and gold, with the stag's eyes made of rubies. Draco was reminded of what a rich old pureblood family the Potters actually were. You could almost forget it of a boy who had grown up in a literal cupboard.
Draco protested laughingly, and then more seriously at the idea of trying at making a Patronus again. But two days after Harry was attacked, he ended up stood there alone in the empty wooden dueling room with Remus anyway.
"Luna?" Draco called frantically, the pull of the wand seeming to tug him in two directions at once when he was deep enough into the cellars that the only glow was his Lumos. "Luna, where are you?
"We have a deal," Draco warned him, stepping in the way of the fireplace to make it explicit before he made the trip. "Even if this doesn't work, you
See how she liked being the one interrupted. "Bound up? Oh, yes. I received an award for special services to the school, for helping
"Come on, we shouldn't keep everyone else waiting," Potter said, and picked up Draco's discarded piece of wood and virtually dragged them out.
many, or so dark and deep. It was like fangs had punctured the same places over and over, each time the skin healed. If it had ever been given a long enough interval to heal
"And what I hear," Grindelwald countered, "Is that you aren't denying it. Surely, even if it happens not to be true, you must concede it makes a great deal of sense-"
"Gift?" Draco cried, and his hands shot out to grip on Grindelwald's shoulder before he remembered the way the man had been cut. He was trying so hard not to look at the wound, looking only at that hideously blissful face, and yet he could not escape it in his peripheral vision like the whole world was filling now with the dripping of red, not flame but blood springing up from mountain stone. It was blood on his own hands, whether or not he struck the final blow. "Gift? You call it a gift?"
Draco groaned. "Okay, fine, whatever. You'll just have to wait a second, I need to change. Just hang out and chill or whatever." And so it was that Draco left a World Cup finalist to
Thank Merlin that the Weasleys had gotten the trip to Ollivander's over with before Draco had to make an excuse not to come. He didn't know if his jealous wand would understand he was just going to get a new wand for Ron. And he didn't think the
of those walls, even the strength of them, does nothing to alter the nature of what rests behind them."
many Stunning charms," Severus said, "Even were you 24 and not 14, and even for a brief period. Hence the profound magical shock your body seems to have been submerged in. The charms you performed after, while impressive in their destructive force, are not outside your usual repertoire? I am so unfortunate a man as to have to postulate thus..." Draco nodded weakly.
Harry's hands went to Draco's waist, but pulled back once he realized. Draco scowled at the loss, then shrugged off his robe to leave himself in his uniform, getting it out of the way before pulling Harry's hands back where they had been. "Twelve days and you want to
"Astaroth had choices," Theo said evenly, and reached under his shirt and pulled out a necklace. The opal of the charm caught the light like a spell, before Theo took it off and offered it to Draco. "Here. I've been waiting to give the mad dragon back."
If the boy who Potter had been meant to save from the snake hadn't already turned and fled like his life depended on it, Longbottom's Hufflepuff partner showing an irritating amount of sense.
With a wave, Wooky indicated a pile of candied mango beside the pomegranate on Pansy's plate. "We have been at Hogwarts for many years, mistress, since the Parkinson family freed us." From Pansy's disconcerted face, it seemed that at her tender age, her family had kept that unpleasant business from her. "And we have not bothered you, mistress... only made sure the menu would have Mistress's favorites sometimes... but when Dobby told us that Mistress Pansy had a Quidditch match tomorrow, we wanted to help! We cannot believe Mistress Pansy is playing for Slytherin!"
Draco put Harry off until next Monday, saying he needed to prepare for the dueling lessons, which really meant he needed all the time he could muster to work on his secret potions. Harry agreed, looking happier than Draco had seen him since he survived the Norwegian Ridgeback. Maybe the boy just really enjoyed putting himself in danger. Got off on it, even.
"You're a time traveler!" blurted Dorian, and the sudden yelp made Dantanian and Lamia start, just as the words used might make any observer of the memories take pause.
And Draco, barely half-conscious, could lie between his uncles and listen to the sound of Death Eaters falling one by one, as Dumbledore arrived with a half-dozen stragglers who had finally escaped the wedding. They helped win the day, while Draco buried his face in Remus's chest and began to sob.
Slytherin. It's moronic to just take half of our house and leave them out of the talent pool for some arbitrary old rules. If having more possibilities for our team makes us
Still, having managed not to kill either his dear new Uncle Sirius or himself, he had to count this as a win. "He staged it too well. Did he cut off his own finger that they found?" Draco asked, remembering the stories of Wormtail cutting off his own hand for Voldemort's blood ritual.
, but it has a certain pithy treacliness that amuses the aesthete- in juxtaposition to what lies behind it."
," Severus had drawled in amusement, "It only works the other way around," but Draco had been insistent. Draco would never expose Lupin himself, of course- unless it proved necessary for Lupin to give Sirius a chance again.
Dorian Malfoy was, predictably, the voice. Lamia looked up at him with uncomplicated irritation at the interruption, while Dantanian's stare seemed to size Dorian up more thoroughly. "This one," Dantanian said to Lamia, as if Dorian wasn't there. "How has he gotten even taller? It's monstrous. Well, he'll likely stop growing by the end of, say, third year-"
At least Mother and Father had managed to keep Draco's arrest out of the papers, though Draco feared the rumor would spread inevitably through Hogwarts, if nothing else through Diggory's pretty little son. Draco's work in his notebooks mainly consisted of half-drugged rambling dialogue to himself, on the subject of how to prevent the Dark Lord from rising again this year, mainly because he would prefer never to experience anything as unpleasant as the night of the World Cup again, in bodily terms. One of the byproducts of that change would be sparing Cedric Diggory's life, preserving a prime genetic specimen for their generation. That had seemed a far more appealing prospect to Draco before meeting Amos Diggory.
He found some hope, though, in his immediate return to Ron and Potter's confidence, and the wild story they gave him of the scene they'd witnessed under the invisibility cloak at Hagrid's hut. They didn't even seem to blame him, when they mentioned his father's role in arresting Hagrid and banishing Dumbledore. Instead, they just seemed to be mortified by their mistake suspecting Draco, and wishing fruitlessly that they could take it back.
"I'm not going back to the Dursleys forever," he argued, only to undercut his own argument as he tentatively added, "And it's been so long since we all spent time together, you know, this is kind of nice..."
"I know," Draco said, and enfolded her in a hug, while they waited for the others to come down to the entrance hall with their bags and say goodbye as well. "I know, Striker. I'll miss you. I'll write you every week-"
"I asked," Luna said, and Hermione and Draco boggled at her. "And asked again. Over and over. Every day, for the entire semester. I think he just got sick of me asking."
"Except I was trying to do something good! I was trying to save Black, like I tried to save Hermione from the Basilisk- like I tried to save Luna from Riddle- and I just keep failing, I can't do anything right, I can't save anyone-"
"You don't think it's a good idea?" Hermione said, looking so disappointed by his reaction, it was hard not to feel guilty. Harry's head lifted at that, as if looking for Draco to give him an excuse to bail out of it before it began.
Hermione cleared her throat. "'Harry Potter's eyes brim with the ineradicable pain of the loss of his parents, a pain he fights back manfully to proclaim the shocking truth about their murderer...' oh, Harry, don't make that face, we knew what we were getting with Skeeter. And she knows her audience. This stuff works. Come on, just listen. 'The terrible blight upon wizardkind we all thought dead and gone has returned, and the young and brave hero Harry Potter, pride of the wizarding world, has come forward with his boyishly handsome face and haunted green eyes to tell the story of the terrible ordeal he suffered, fighting He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named once more...'"
He should have tried harder. With the arrival of March came the end of Hogwarts' tolerance of their free boarder. Severus had betrayed him enough to allow Sirius and Remus to recall him. Apparently they believed the lies of continued magical exhaustion, and wanted him close enough to their care, and St. Mungo's if necessary, to help restore their adopted son to health. Those two taking parenting seriously was so
"You can't actually be asking me out," Draco said slowly. "Asking me to go be your date, and dance with you and all the other champions in front of the entire school-" He got a vivid mental image of himself trying to waltz with Potter, not moving about very much because Potter was terrible at it, just swaying and staring at each other, faces close- "That
for you, you think I'd scruple just to fight a duel for it?" Ron seemed stunned at Draco's ordering of those acts' unpleasantness. "Someone has to show you you're not always right!"
"I wish," Ron muttered, but it was that stubborn loyalty of his that seemed to drag him down to the dungeons to accompany Potter, unlike Draco who had simply had nothing better to do.
There was nothing repressed about Harry's aggression. "You can't stalk him! I know you've been following him around! What, are you plotting revenge?" Harry got in Theo's face again, and it felt like a miracle neither of them had drawn their wands. "Stay away from Draco!"
"Oh," Draco said, lowering the blade from Harry's neck and forcing a smile, one that felt rather manic on his own face. "Oh, it's you. Sorry. I was having a nightmare- Merlin, your skin-" A bead of red was visible over the November-pale curve of Harry's neck, sliding from a thin line to cut a stroke of ink towards his collarbones. "I'm so sorry..."
"Kreacher," Black repeated. "He was my family's house elf here when I was growing up. He should still be living here, though I haven't seen his ugly mug. Must be, if things like that are disappearing. Never too fond of me, that miserable old rag. Why do you think I haven't used this place more? Can't trust him not to try and get me caught or done in. He was loyal to my mother-"
Harry and the others were still milling around the Gryffindor table. When they strolled back over, Harry's green eyes widened at them, or more honestly, at Draco, in the falling dusk from the enchanted ceiling above. Harry held up his left hand, where the small golden rose gleamed, and Draco couldn't help it. He strode forward, as fast as he could, and pressed his mouth to Harry's hand, hard, with impulsive feeling. "You're going to win," Draco told Harry, though the words were more for himself. "You're going to be fine."
"Lucky," she echoed, staring at the spot between her fingers. "Funny, for him to go to such extremes to run away from this world, and end up one of the worst of them."
Going into Kreacher's small room and seeing a photograph of Aunt Bella was hardly the best beginning to Christmas. But at least Draco managed to pocket the framed picture before anyone else could see. He took it to the corner, cast a hasty Reducto, and Vanished the fragments.
Draco made a face at Greg and shook his head. "I wouldn't enter even if I could." He rolled his eyes when he heard Theo on his other side whisper,
A startled noise drew both their attention. It was naturally the worst person in the world to have overheard, except perhaps for Theodore Nott, or Albus Dumbledore. Harry stood there with a parchment that must be the Marauder's Map in hand, with eyes as wide as an owl behind his glasses.
"You're in luck, then," Draco drawled, "Because I'm never happy. I might as well be a Dementor myself-"
"I don't know if I'll be that lucky," Draco said. Though he knew having sole possession of the blue loop gave him privileged knowledge, it didn't make him wish any less he had an
"Severus!" Draco cried out, and flung himself over and hugged Severus for the second time in his life. He felt he deserved it after his relative bravery, and if Severus didn't appreciate being covered in Basilisk blood just this once, well, could he really keep calling himself a Slytherin?
"We didn't even say the name," Luna said softly, "But yes, it was Tom. We were at the Heart of Winter gala, just as it was when I went. It was like he always described to me, in the diary. We were there, we were together, and we were dancing. That's what I saw. Him and me dancing under all the snow and ice."
He was glad for the memory of the troll on Halloween, reconfirmed by a check in his notebook, for the excuse to skip out on dinner entirely. He went to the kitchens after his last class, and managed to wheedle some of the Halloween feast out of the elves early. What made him just that bit more depressed was the lack of any news about Dobby once again. But it seemed the sight of his real solicitousness and disappointment that prompted the elves to go from grudgingly giving a few pieces of candy, to packing a personal bag of more treats than he could carry. A Featherlight charm took care of that, and he hid inside his curtains with his food, notebooks, wand, and Imoogi right beside his pillow, with one part of his mind trying to puzzle out everything McGonagall had told him, and another trying not to think at all, ever again.
"Millicent Bulstrode?" Ginny gasped, zooming up in disbelief, her red hair a flaming trail behind her in the waning moonlight. "You've got to be kidding me! She told the world you would
- and we must do so much of the transport and setup ourselves. We are hampered by the need to keep the island as secret as possible. The Fidelius charm would be little use, since the Death Eaters already know, but our focus has been making it completely unassailable. In contrast, yes, to the night of our wedding..."
"Finestra," Draco hissed, snapping his empty hand in the glass's direction with all his frustration crystallizing in the motion, and only realized when he saw the glass shatter that he should have checked first if there were any dark curses on the case. He should have learned after just getting into trouble with another unknown artifact. Maybe that had been what Dobby was trying to warn him about, but either way, Draco found he didn't care overmuch. If it cursed him, if it struck him dead where he stood, well, that saved him the trouble of getting back to the future, or figuring out what he had to do with those long pointless years that awaited the venerable old name of Lord Malfoy.
"Why?" Pansy howled. "Because of this bitch?" She drew her wand, pointed it in Ginny's face. "She doesn't see a thing! They're all blind! Conjuncti-"
me? Moody will get told or figure it out eventually. The wards around Hogwarts, the distance, possession, none of it works that way."
"A lot of things. I mean, maybe it's that a lot think I'm the one who set that troll out in the dungeons in Halloween."
sentiments. Dantanian believed that his namesake, the founder of the citadel, made this bargain, entering the mirror and going off to die for some Eurydice of his, but then chose in the end to live rather than 'stay in hell'. Hence his isolation and strangeness, hence his dark experiments- and most of all, hence his writings' unusual mysteriousness and
There was nothing in the bedchamber save a black bed, some drawers, a number of shelves of books and papers and potions, and a massive stone table, with what was obviously a Pensieve on top of it, currently empty. Draco could guess what Severus meant to do, even before he drew his wand and pulled a silvery thread from his head, dropping it into the liquid and pushing Draco closer.
Harry smiled at him fondly, taking off his own mask. Draco felt sweaty, but of course Harry looked pristine, despite the larger and heavier metal. Maybe there was an enchantment, or maybe it was just hard for Draco to think Harry looked anything but perfectly desirable.
Draco was happy to put aside that disturbing, pernicious letter and attend to happier topics, even if the warning Percy had put about Umbridge being given more power had already come true. The Daily Prophet had announced, as in the blue loop, that Umbridge had been made Hogwarts High Inquisitor, with the only real point of interest in the article a quote from Father acting as if he was
"You know," Draco said some time after, when the wizards were done taking all their reports and Mr. Diggory was unbinding him from the arrest spells, "Your hostility was uncalled for. I'll have you know I've been a quite enthusiastic supporter of your lovely son at Quidditch."
"No, it's somethin' yeh cain't find in Hogwarts," Hagrid hinted, and Draco found himself stumped but entertained, watching the savior of the Wizarding world be equally stumped by Hagrid's artistic self-expression, too polite to admit it was impossible to tell what it was meant to be.
the man with the silver hand was? And why was that name on an enchanted map, in the hands of a beaming, unsuspecting Harry Potter, a Christmas present from his beloved surrogate family?
," and ripped his shoulder from Periander's grasp. Then he ran. He sprinted out of the graveyard with all of his Seeker's speed. When he looked back to be sure Periander wouldn't shoot curses at him from behind, he just saw the man standing there over the grave still, wand not even out. The only expression his face seemed to hold was fear.
Draco picked himself off the stone and rounded the end of the beast, finally, to the sight of the diary impaled through with a Basilisk fang, ink oozing out all over the stone like blood. There was sizzling from the pages where the fang had touched. Riddle was nowhere to be seen, like finishing the diary off had done the same for him, and that scream had been his death. Two wands, one bent and one straight, lay before the diary like some offering to it, the ink curling around leaving them untouched while it ran like a river to join the Basilisk's blood beyond it.
"Don't act like he's your son," Draco said, uncomfortable at the intensity of Black's desperation, pleading despite saying he wouldn't beg. Severus might as well have been there in the room with him, for the way Draco felt that dark stare on him too, condemning him for yet another betrayal to even consider this. "You don't even know Harry Potter."
"That was exhausting," Draco complained to Hermione, after Severus officially adjourned class. They headed out to the courtyard for break before they had Arithmancy together. He was tapped on the shoulder by Ron, gesturing to an increasingly frustrated-looking Harry.
Severus was in his rooms when Draco came to bang on the door, looking none too pleased at this unscheduled visit, or Draco tracking snow over his floors. "What now?" Severus sighed, returning to his armchair with his book and glass of whisky, and Draco squeezed his eyes tightly shut, wishing Severus had given him a different potion than the Draught of Peace. As if there was any potion in the world that could falsely endow him with the courage he needed.
Draco's attention turned to another kind of dark magic: his blood magic book, Hecate's wheel, which in July Draco had, in all his infinite wisdom, decided would be the perfect symbol for Hermione's birthday present. It wasn't an etched design, but an actual wheel, intricate and mysterious with the five-pointed star wedged securely between the mottled turquoise coils. He'd used a real blue diamond from one of Great-Aunt Walburga's bracelets for the star, taking hours and hours just on the minute work carving its facets carefully, and it stood out prismatic and almost eerie within the whirls of darker blue.
"I know you've had a rough time of it," Hermione said briskly, "But I hope you know we've all been pretty down without you. And I didn't think it right, to not take you to see him as soon as he could." She looked up at the sky. Draco could make out a circling figure, hovering near the brass hoops. His heart began to beat faster, before she cupped her hands to her mouth and yelled, "RON!"
So Draco and Dobby went to the lowest empty space on the map, in search of that kitchen. It might hold the house elf they imagined there, doing his or her loneliest of tasks keeping Grindelwald alive day by day, all without likely being allowed to speak with or even see him. Better to have no contact with the elf, only Obliviating them if they popped in at an inopportune moment. Not just for security, but to keep Dobby from conceiving some humanitarian mission of liberating the help. Though if Grindelwald ended up dead somehow, and no longer in need of feeding, Draco would definitely consider it.
"You can't be yelling about these things in the open, Sirius," Remus coaxed him, "Anyone could hear," and stroked a propitiating hand down his chest, soft gaze pleading. "Draco's giving him Occlumency lessons, so maybe once Harry improves and stops having these visions, maybe..."
Potter was everything Draco had ever wanted to be, and give Draco a second chance, give him fifty lifetimes to try again over and over, he would never get anywhere close.
"Vain boy," Severus sighed, looking tired as he took Draco's hand. Draco squeezed Severus's hand, the small proof of affection making him break down again.
"I just- you want me to be?" Draco asked, with a shyness he found embarrassing in himself, and got his shoulder shaken again by Sirius.
"Get used to it, Neville," Hermione said calmly. "If I'd kept on getting flustered every time Draco said something sexual, I'd have had a heart attack by now."
"And don't bullshit me. You went to make a wand from Astaroth's heartstrings, with Gregorovitch, which is how you knew about him to steal the Elder Wand from him later. I guess you didn't have it yet."
"Draco," she said slowly. "I should not have to tell you how talented you are. A wizard of your skills could do a great deal of good in the world. You have showed great leadership skill this year as Slytherin Quidditch captain. The team is unrecognizable from last year. And with integrating young women into the Slytherin team for the first time, you showed great vision and courage. With these qualities, you would have the skills to make a very fine Auror-"
While the Weasleys and Hermione dropped in every few nights or so, Harry came to watch dueling practice nightly without fail. He took each time to make obvious his resentment he was not included, though it was hard to tell whose place he would have liked to take.
It wouldn't matter, of course. But even if Riddle had killed Potter, Draco was not going to go down quietly. He was Severus Snape's godson.
"The prophecy!" Draco yelled, so loud that Severus jumped away, covering his ears and giving him a wounded look. "No, it's just- last year- I would save Sirius- the dragon would strike, the rat would be swallowed in flame, and the Grim would rise- she saw that I was going to kill Pettigrew, didn't she? I thought- I don't know-"
The Quidditch championship had, like last time, fallen between Gryffindor and Ravenclaw, with Slytherin nowhere in the running. Draco wished he had a way to contact Millie, and see if her non-spying for him extended to telling him whether anyone in light of this underperformance missed the Kingsnakes.
the direction of these hints? The inferior pretender will search for me here- but my Kaktusblüte is surely too clever to think it remotely possible to shelter me
"Hagrid was only a boy, but he cared for me, hidden in a cupboard in the castle, feeding me on scraps from the table. Hagrid is my good friend, and a good man. When I was discovered, and blamed for the death of a girl, he protected me. I have lived here in the Forest ever since, where Hagrid still visits me. He even found me a wife, Mosag, and you see how our family has grown, all through Hagrid's goodness..."
"You were about to receive a pass to use the prefect's bathrooms freely," Severus said coolly, "To administer your infusions. But if you persist in
"Draco," Hermione reminded him gently when he kept picking up novelty gifts and eyeing them speculatively, "I don't think your father would like you having these kind of things around the Manor."
Draco and Luna had taken turns watching the Marauder's Map, and Krum had been as good as his word, up to the start of the Task. When they snuck off from Harry towards Krum, they found him with not just Karkaroff but Crouch, who was trying to take Krum off for a brief chat. "Just a few things I need to check," Crouch said menacingly, "In
"I don't need to tell you, Kingsnakes," Draco began, "That everyone hates us. But that won't touch us
"Hi," Fred said to Aberforth, "Could we have... twenty-five Butterbeers, please?" He seemed to want to keep those winnings to himself, actually, as he appealed for a collection to go around from the students. Draco stepped in front of the stack of dusty Butterbeers appearing, though, before anyone could take them. He had his own plans before anything remotely resembling fun.
He couldn't take back what he'd said about Harry, and saying he was too busy for the meetings would just make it sound like he'd been talking out of his arse. He tried something closer to the truth. "Me being around would make people uncomfortable. Come on, half of you think I'm going to curse you at any moment. I'm here to help set it up for my friends, and make sure it works out for
His voice trailed off so abruptly that Draco looked up as well. Harry was staring at the entrance to the courtyard, where Theo stood there alone, watching. Upon being noticed, he quickly crossed the courtyard along the edge, and went out of sight.
After forever in that haze, the trees thinned. When Draco's head bounced backwards, he could see the sky.
"Draco Lupin Black," Hermione hissed, two of the only students still in their seats, "Is that iron from
Severus stared at him still like he could see through him, and knew he was holding something back from the professors, but as Draco gathered his things back up, he had no recourse but to bite out some sarcastic comment and sweep his way out. Draco's jerky glug from the draught of peace as he left threatened to goad him further, from his glare, but he managed to control himself and depart nonetheless. No doubt he had other questions in his mind to answer.
"You see! Ha!" Karkaroff exclaimed, tottering until he could jab an accusing finger right into Severus's chest. Severus jerked away to avoid the touch as he would have any madman's, which Karkaroff in truth had come to resemble. Just over his time with Draco, the stringy overgrown hair around Karkaroff's face seemed to have turned grayer and wilder. Karkaroff's unshaven face was contorted into a hideous caricature of his usual merely grumpy and contemptuous self, alive as he had never seemed with a hatred greater than anyone could have known- but Draco
"Jealous of what?" Potter said incredulously, "Jealous of what? He wants to make a prat of himself in front of the whole school, does he-"
"Peter," Lupin breathed, and then looked back at Black, tired old honest hazel eyes filling more emotions than Draco could follow. Potter raised his wand before Wormtail, who was cringing and shying back, trapped between their wands and the fireplace. Draco joined him, letting the rat-looking bastard feel the flames near his ankles.
"Harry," Draco said coldly, "You're fourteen, not four. You can handle binding a bloke a little without losing your nerve like this. Now stop acting like a Hufflepuff and tie me up properly."
"He was just an ordinary painter," Frederick said, voice heated, "Who- passed, three years ago, because-" He seemed to regain his self-possession. "Listen, son, I don't know what your mother told you, but the truth is, your father wasn't a- witch or wizard or any of that. The only magic person we ever met was- Astarte.
"You really don't give a fuck about me, do you?" Draco screamed, pulling hard enough on the bonds on his wrists to make the chair rattle and feel almost precarious beneath him. "You told me in first year that I was wrong that no one would care if I was dead- was that a lie? Because you wouldn't keep putting me in harm's way, and sending Aurors and
Ron was taking Draco by the shoulders then, like all these Gryffindors were doing, as if anything could be fixed by touch. "Bloody hell, Draco, are you alright?"
He stayed in the room after everyone left for Quidditch. His cashmere sweater and slacks were hardly suitable for flying, so Harry had offered to let Draco borrow any of his clothes he wanted. Draco looked, reciting to himself in his head like a mantra,
Father said that. Father had been the one to speak so much of what Draco knew about Mudbloods in his head. But Severus might have been in love with Lily Potter, who had once been Lily Evans. Mother had said that, once all the fighting and dying was over. And Severus had done what he did against the Dark Lord, reading between the lines, because of that unreturned love.
"Your father," Draco said, and that got Potter's attention right to him. "Your father was a famous Seeker for Gryffindor at Hogwarts, did you know that? Think you inherited any of his skill?"
Draco could see they were drawing more attention yet. He downed his glass of punch, wishing for the cool crisp lychee nectar at the Manor's galas, and elbowed Potter.
When Draco went back out, thinking to extract one more hug, he found them already halfway down the stairs, quietly arguing with each other from the sounds of it. He didn't want to do any more eavesdropping that night, so he went back into his bedroom. He was too tired to put up the Patronus-colored lights and bluebell flames.
Theo shot him a sharp glance. "You've got a couple of them on that team now, Draco. You're going to have to promise us you won't go easy on them. I'm less worried about Dobby than you."
"Potter," Draco said, licking his dry lips, mind working sluggishly, almost as unprepared as his heart. "I'm talking to you now, I'll swear to you on anything you want. I wouldn't do this, I wouldn't open the Chamber even if my father told me to, I wouldn't betray Hermione like that- Potter, I wouldn't betray
Poor Lockhart. It almost made Draco sorry to know he was soon to have his mind wiped and become a useless vegetable.
Draco fell gasping at the threshold. Severus came running out at a thud Draco's still-ringing ears could at least register now. Severus's dark-clad figure was like a Dementor, but somehow still the very vision of salvation, as Draco gasped out, "Hospital wing... tell them... potions accident, making- making the Wolfsbane..."
"Yes," Phineas said impatiently, as if his student's survival was little matter to him, compared to his student's obedience. "That is a question for the Ministry of Magic. As is the penalty you will incur for your dangerous trespassing, although I am positive that will rest largely, if not solely on my
Harry's darkened green eyes seemed to see Draco to the core. It was past pleasure, almost agony to feel this close to someone, and from zero to a hundred, so forcefully. So impossible to detach, like it was risking their magic to be knit together as one...
"Shouldn't you be more focused on your replacement Hogwarts than kicking me out of the real one?" Draco blurted, and saw from Remus's expression that he'd hit at the truth.
"I love you," Harry said, in that way that meant he wanted to be damn sure Draco heard and understood. "I love you more than anything in the world. And that is never going to change. Do you understand?"
Those keen blue eyes were unmistakable. "You were singing... Silent Night, but... in German. Why... you're not German..."
"Oh, that doesn't matter so much, academics and all that," Sirius said breezily, to Hermione's look of horror. "
"Stop sucking up," Hermione sighed, "I'll show you the bathroom, at least." She led him to Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, of all places. "What? It's one place we know no one will go."
"Trust me," Draco said evenly, "You want to tell the truth right now. For your own interest. You want to keep your old school pals engaged, because if they aren't, I take over, and that might not be as charming a walk down memory lane."
He sat himself in one of the furthest armchairs from the fireplace, drawing up his legs in hopes of avoiding attention completely before she returned. He hadn't been imagining the greater share of stares and dirty looks they'd gotten for a Slytherin in Gryffindor Tower than last year, though Hermione had just told him to ignore it and no one really cared anyway. Last time, though, he had been a first-year, inherently more unthreatening than any year above, and in the presence of their token Gryffindor Saint Potter, whom they all so rarely dared question.
When Draco kneeled for the vow, too deep underground for any windows, the cell's dim light only showed his shadow. Lockhart remained sitting, watching Severus rather than following Draco. "Get on your knees, Gilderoy," Severus barked, oblivious to the effect those words in that imperious tone had on his admirer. Lockhart dropped to his knees like he had been shot.
If Harry had been as good with the real sword as his mental sword, he, Ron, and Draco would all be long-dead, haunting the Chamber with nothing to do but vandalize that god-awful statue of Salazar Slytherin.
Potter would not stay put as Draco advised, and went off to peer around the trees, though at least he had the grace not to run his mouth again. It didn't matter, as a low ragged voice shouted out, "MORSMODRE!"
a game of chess, in which, unlike Ron's game in first year, he could only hope to not end up the knight. He had faced up to worse than what awaited him in that great mountain fortress, if Dobby could get him in. It had been so much more frightening, for him
Nothing could have welded them back together quicker, whatever fissures still lay underneath, than the loss of the girl who had brought them together in the first place. Draco would have gone crawling back to
Draco went over with the intention of getting dressed, and found himself getting sidetracked, because bloody hell, forget Ron, that suit sure did things for
"You should have, Draco," Hermione said disapprovingly, "You've said yourself, she doesn't have friends
"Sure," Draco said, trying to keep his voice level, but then Potter leaned in furtively and pressed a sneaky kiss to his cheek, before sprinting away and past the Fat Lady like he'd planted a bomb and had to escape the blast radius.
Dantanian was with Phineas again, this time in the Headmaster's office, quite different from the days of Dumbledore. Either Dumbledore, or the limp noodle headmaster Dippet between the two, must have done considerable redecoration. Dantanian had in hand the fatal letter, legible over his shoulder, and one expected him to crumple, however restored his health looked by passing time. But he merely straightened in his chair with the posture of a statue, and told his new uncle, "It's a lie, of course."
She rolled her whip low, striking the hindquarters off the centaur, and the great gold beast fell on him with all its weight. Draco almost managed to roll away, but not quite. Its weight came down on his side, pinning him. He might have screamed for help, with the many duels going on beneath in the distance. But he could not even let any of his friends know he was about to die.
Harry got more interested, though, after telling Sirius and Remus about it in his two-way mirror, and finding out that his father had attended a few such Samhain masquerades, although those had been proper bonfires, not in a common room. James Potter had a beautiful stag mask he wore to them, along with the traditional hooded dark cloak and black suit. Harry unwrapped the mask that Sirius sent with glee at the Gryffindor table, attracting many admiring stares. The first time he put it on, Draco had to fight off the reminder of Trelawney's prophecy. He told himself it had already unfurled, and he should just enjoy his boyfriend supporting his creative endeavors.
Draco looked at the vial, which was indeed labeled as such, and drank with an exhausted resignation to fate. The world cleared up after that, though he began to cough in turn, which Severus called a natural side effect of inhaling a prodigious amount of toxic dust. "Toxic?" Draco breathed, and Severus let out a mirthless snort.
"Oh, my, my," Umbridge trilled again, discomfited by the expression of strong attachment between two men and doing a poor job of hiding it. "And yet when you heard of the tragic events that befell your friends, even you believed Sirius was guilty, the man you... loved
to give me your watch," he said sadly, pouting for all the world and soon the cameras to see. "I would have given you mine, but I'm sure it's different for the Minister of Magic. You don't have to fulfill your promises to
written forever into that hallowed skin, and it was all he could do not to laugh at the sounds she made.
, and wondered if there were elves remaining in the house. They couldn't have missed their entrance from the noise it generated. Nor could Sirius Black.
"Wait," Draco said, and was fast enough to stop the appalled reaction he would expect from Severus, with a first-year pointing his wand at his hand point-blank. A wordless wave of his wand tightened the band of turquoise, with the stone still malleable to his magic but settling. When Severus pulled it off and on again, this time it fit perfectly. Draco was surprised at his own exactitude with the spell, but as with most of the transfiguration, it worked better without him thinking about it much. He had a distraction, then, from the discovery he could not share his secret even if he tried, with the thought he had impressed Severus.
"What is this mirror, Black? What does it do? Does it show the past?" Dumbledore sounded frantic, notes of drunkenness nearly gone.
Draco's heart constricted. "You're telling the person whose dormmates have to navigate their morning routines around a board covered in clippings about Grindelwald," he quipped.
"You're not supposed to catch it, my little prince," the woman laughed, and the child, apparently a boy, gave up the chase to run to her side, clinging to the side of her long black skirts and lifting his eyes up to her adoringly. "It's not for you to play with. It's for me to paint." The boy made quizzical, incoherent sounds, which she understood easily. "This is a magic spell, darling. It's called a Patronus." He pointed to the painting instead, seeming to find it more fascinating up close than even the magic. "It's a commission."
"No," Dobby said excitedly, trying to help him along while holding onto Draco's sullied shirt like it was some great treasure. "But Dobby has heard many tales of him, and how he defeated the Dark Lord, and Dobby is thinking great things of this Harry Potter."
"Draco," Gilderoy gasped, looking around frantically, as if hoping invisible hands would come out of nowhere and extract him from the confident grasp of his former student.
He ignored said other intellectual friend's tentatively reproachful stare as he cut away from the other Slytherins and went down towards the kitchens. As if Theo would have the nerve to discipline Draco, whether or not he actually wanted a spot on the Quidditch team. Being prefect might be more trouble than it was worth for Theo, for whom trying to restrain
"Let him go, Snape!" Sirius snapped. "Liberacorpus!" Harry fell to the ground. Sirius pulled him up, brushing him off, while Draco pulled himself to sit up. He covered his stinging swollen lips, as if there was any chance of hiding what they had been up to now.
Severus waited for him, then seemed to see Draco would not deduce it so quickly. Absurdly, Draco felt a pang of shame for not being clever enough in front of his godfather. "What did he do?"
- Draco, it's Orpheus and Eurydice, I'm surprised you don't know. You like other Greek mythology, don't you?" She held up her bracelet, indicating the Medusa head. This myth did sound vaguely familiar, though Draco couldn't place it.
"Inmotus. Tumultum adux." Draco pocketed the talon wand, fighting the urge to laugh in dismay. "Are you actually
Luna was surprisingly sad. "It's so stupid of me," she said, with a distant sigh. "I wanted to go with him, but I couldn't. So I should be glad he found someone else to go with him."
"Does it look like I don't what I'm doing?" Draco laughed. He had no idea why he was letting himself show off, flashing his palms open and making the fireball expand again. It turned to wisping shapes that fit to the edge of each fingertip, where he could draw in the air with them. The fireball became more of a nebula, with the room obliging him and making itself darker with inky shadow around them.
Harry seemed reluctant to come up to Draco and Luna, but eventually sidled over, after hitting every other pair at least twice. "Hey," Harry said with an awkward little wave. "Listen, I, uh, I know this is way too basic for you, Draco, and maybe you too, Luna, but..."
"You already have more than enough firepower. Your education now is not a question of building that, but learning how to use it. You must build your repertoire of spells, refine your technique, improve close control of individual spells, speed of casting, and above all your endurance, as recently demonstrated. I do not intend to spend
Black raked both hands through his hair, a shudder going through him. "To be honest, I feared that he could be the spy, and anyway, the charm..."
"I'd already taken it," Draco groaned, "Earlier today- Severus, they all saw me, they know I'm weak, they're going to tell- they're going to
"Bloody hell, I forgot, the tapestry," Draco blurted. "Sirius, I haven't figured out how to get Remus on the tapestry, I'm sorry-"
Dobby glared around them fiercely. "Then Dobby will protect Harry Potter!" He deflated right after, though. "If only Dobby knew who he was to be protecting Harry Potter
"Draco," Father snarled, "I asked you a question," and Draco looked up with the shields falling into place in his mind that had in time learned to withstand even Aunt Bella.
"Are you worried whether we'll stand out enough?" Remus asked, and his gaze softened as he stared over at Sirius, who was still in jeans and a T-shirt, fussing over helping Harry with his tie. "Well. That's never really a problem for Sirius Black..."
Luna was upset too, everyone was, Dementors are awful- and I ate chocolate like Lupin said-" The name put an even sourer look on Severus's face. "Luna tried to tell Potter what Black did to his family. And she got far enough that now Potter knows Black is connected to his parents-"
"Incarcerous!" Draco cast, and at the last second, he made sure the rope meant to go around her neck cuffed her wrists twice instead.
know, Lamia. I told you years ago. I'll just need time to prepare, to be sure I get it right this time."
Draco staggered back and Potter pursued him, wand fixed on him with Avada Kedavra eyes never more ready to live up to their color. "Ron said you left, wanting to know where Hermione was! Didn't he?" Ron nodded, ashen. "Ron, go get Professor McGonagall! Hands out of your pockets!" Draco pulled them out and raised them, staggering, while Ron ran like Hermione's life depended on it.
Hermione smiled over, making a valiant effort to look pleased for him. She carefully raised her hands to flash both, then three fingers. Thirteen minutes. A proper Hat Stall, but nothing on half an hour. Draco sagged back in relief, as Dumbledore welcomed them to tuck in to the feast.
Lupin shooed them out then. Potter began following alongside Draco, both of them drained and silent, until Draco's mind caught up with their bodies. "Uh, Potter, don't you think-"
Draco was sure he hadn't. There was no Apparating out of Hogwarts regardless. But the reference to his own crime still made him shudder. He was less disturbed than outraged at the tale that followed of the map that Potter had been given by the Weasley twins, a moving animated real-time map of the entire castle of Hogwarts, including secret passages and the people inside it. That explained so much about the antics of Potter and everything he'd gotten away with in the blue loop. It would be, he supposed, more fun this time, to at least technically be on the other side of it.
Potter was a quick study, and seemed comfortable returning Draco's tricks once he got the feel of them, outside a real game. Draco's elbowing and shoving at the side when they dove and flew together was soon being returned by Potter's superior physical strength, in another reminder of first year, except there was so much laughter even in Dementor-thinned air, and Draco had the singular indignity of realizing how very much of that laughter was also his own.
Hermione and Luna admired the silver S clasp with the little emerald evil eye. "This is so lovely," Hermione said. "Did your mother buy it for you?"
He had never known quite whether to believe Luna, when she told them she wholeheartedly believed Black's story. But she seemed to now, from how gravely she nodded.
Draco might have felt guilty manipulating him like that, if it hadn't been for Harry's own salvation. And if he hadn't had his own selfish reasons for enjoying feeding those pretty lips.
"Safer than with Crookshanks, I'd reckon- actually, I'd bet we're all still safer right now than poor Scabbers alone in the Tower with that beast- bloody hell, Draco, are you alright?"
Dantanian turned to look at him, seeming more alarmed at the first part of the sentence. "I don't have any friends."
"I was," Luna said breathlessly, "But Hermione hates it, she's not athletic at all, and when we heard what had happened to Mr. Weasley, we thought we should be here with Ron and all of you..."
"No, not Neville, we thought we should make it a more exclusive group," George laughed, and had to suffer Hermione's screeching, only to have her fall dead silent when the lift stopped.
year. No Slytherin would have the lack of self-respect to comport herself in such a way once a teenager-
Draco was proud to already know that was the name of the doctor and not the monster, though most Muggles apparently didn't. It was bizarrely engrossing, though Draco got himself into trouble by the end. "How did you get the nickname Frankenstein, Draco?" Mrs. Granger asked. "You're such a nice-looking, polite young man. Is it ironic?"
Draco refused to engage in his confrontational air. Or let himself remember how that leaning body had felt in his arms, when they'd hugged for long outside the hospital wing. "I'm not a mind-reader, Harry. You're going to have to tell me why you're pissed at me this time. Is it to do with Hogsmeade?" Harry's face told him he was right. "You know I have to make the potion for Remus-"
"Relax, Potter, it's on my shoulder," Draco said, and undid a few buttons of his white shirt before tugging it off his right shoulder. "Here, see? It's kind of a reddish copper."
Draco tested his lying skills. "I just wanted to be ready as soon as I could for Hogwarts, Father," he said in a trembling voice, "Because- because you always say my magic is so weak for a Malfoy, so I just wanted to start-"
"Why does everyone think I'm always using dark magic," Draco whined at him, "I mean, I'm a dark wizard, yes, but I'm not
"Or he's just a decent person," Lamia said. "And reached out and befriended someone in need when they were at their lowest-"
Draco spent the night in Severus's rooms that night, and at least when he woke up, his wand  was the talon wand again. He was excused from classes for the rest of the week, as Pomfrey was apparently furious that they'd ignored her earlier recommendation he rest for the entire week. Easy to let Severus attribute Draco's fit to the magical exhaustion, rather than psychological failings. That was convenient enough. Draco used that excuse in his minimal dialogue with his dormmates, in the annoying slivers of time when he had to leave his locked muffled bed curtains to relieve himself or get food from Dobby or deliveries of notes and homework from a cautious but helpful Theo.
how you managed to produce such an incredibly powerful and dangerous piece of dark magic on command, in such a dangerous situation?"
Wow, Draco's presence was really helping them make progress at the whole Potter-not-dying thing. "Well, Pansy Parkinson, for one." Their unimpressed gazes showed higher expectations. "Theodore Nott-" Hermione put a hand to Potter's mouth to silence his indignant shriek. Must have given him war flashbacks to that one sordid interlude with the Polyjuice Potion. Draco strained his mind for any more remotely plausible names. "Adrian Pucey, Zacharias Smith, the list goes on, it's a trial but I try to bear up under it with grace, now have we figured out how to save Potter's hide?" He picked up a book from the stack and smirked. "Oh, look. This one's rather topical."
Implicating his wand had fooled no one. It was just one more proof, to anyone who somehow hadn't gotten the message yet, that Draco was a dark wizard from a dark family. But it did give a lie to stick to. That had a virtue of its own, even if everyone knew it a lie. The disbelieved lie formed the most perfect kind of wall, stubborn and pointless but impassible in front of the truth.
"Lucius, we do have matters to discuss. Shall we go up to my office?" Fudge inserted himself quickly. Matters in this case clearly were of the gold-colored variety. Charity, under-the-counter campaign contributions, outright bribery, you name it, it would happen in that office.
Potter was watching him closely, a smile threatening to curl up at the corner of his lips. "I don't know if I've ever seen you this passionate about anything."
"I only got an E in Defense too," Ron said. Hermione proved unwilling to say whatever cutting thing must have come into her head. Instead, she pushed Draco's letter into his hands.
Why did no one ever believe Draco when he said that? Just because he was young? It wasn't like some of his characteristics probably didn't fit the stereotypes. But no, it was like Draco had to declare it biweekly, and some people like Pansy still wouldn't even get the hint. "Hermione is like my sister, Potter. The Dementors make me remember when I heard Luna had been taken into the Chamber, too. Are you going to ask me if I fancy my cousin?"
The Lovegoods weren't exactly made of money. Luna had been happy to repurpose her robes from the Heart of Winter gala with tailoring charms. Draco tried to forget they had originally been Mother's. She was dazzling in layers of glistening, filmy white tulle, hair in a braided with a snowdrop flower crown Draco had ordered. Neville had nearly fallen down the stairs at seeing her.
It was not a question of possibility, but will, as its burning hovered into being above it, all of its screams and blasts of light silenced, every broken stone erased by a falling shadow. A shadow with vast sweeping wings that erased the ruins where Hagrid's hut and steps to the Great Hall had once been. The shadow had a head so bright, it made the shadow shimmer, like lakelight on the walls of dungeons that might burn with the rest of this place that was once the center of the world.
Draco's chest constricted like it always did at the reminder of that singularly unholy place, even if the Dementors were missing. The smell of the Dementors would still be in the stone...
"Draco," Luna said, coming over and taking his shoulder. She looked very contented, for someone whose honor he was trying to defend. "It's okay. I'm just glad to see you're alright." She glanced back at the Ravenclaws, hovering nervously behind her. As if he would fix the curses for them.
"You were right," Draco said. "She was right. The Death Eaters are going to try and use this to get into Hogwarts?" Dobby nodded anxiously. "And she went on ahead? What was she
An impressive silence greeted Draco's pronouncement, before Remus took a more empathetic tack. "I can't imagine how all of you must be feeling right now. This is your father. But he's in the hands of the best doctors money can buy, and Draco's right. At this stage, with him safe at St. Mungo's and in treatment, we wouldn't be able to see him right away. We would just be in the way. So I know it's hard, but please, try and stay put with us and wait."
"Gilderoy," Draco admitted, and changed that once Harry looked more disbelieving. "Lockhart. Gilderoy Lockhart. Dobby. And, uh... Igor Karkaroff, so-"
"I believe you," Severus said quietly. "I believe you are mad, but I believe you. Oh, Gilderoy. What have you done to yourself? It is impossible. I am sorry. I am truly sorry, but it is impossible. It will always be impossible."
Draco made short work of his shoes and socks, and then straightened with a grin. He couldn't keep the adoration out of it. "Did you miss this?" he said, running a hand up his chest slowly, enjoying the feeling of his nipples hardening under his own touch. He took the HJP chain and pulled the initials forward. "It's like a collar, really. Marking who to return me to if I get lost..."
I remember you as one of my best students, although in truth I was not much of a professor. Congratulations on your O on your Defense OWL! I believe one day you could make a fine Auror. You must already be a fine duelist, if you follow at all in the footsteps of your godfather.
The laughter then was far louder. Fudge and Umbridge exchanged furious glances, able to tell how badly this was going off the rails. "You were accused," Umbridge pressed on, "Of helping Harry Potter sneak his name into the Goblet of Fire and illegally enter the tournament!"
The trade extracted then could not have been more simple: permission for Slytherin to re-form, and Draco, Umbridge, and Severus would stay out of each other's way. In return, Draco would not use the brand or any other magic against Umbridge. He was middlingly sure he could hold to that. But if necessary, he wouldn't exactly scruple to break his word to the likes of her.
"Fifty years ago," Draco breathed, and then rounded on him. "Dobby, my father said the Chamber was opened by Hagrid fifty years ago. But the diary wasn't Hagrid's. It said T.M. Riddle inside."
Dobby didn't respond. Draco suddenly realized Dobby was no better-prepared, for this piece of wintry hell, than the addition of an adorable puffy down coat and snow boots, both patterned in turquoise-pink paisley that bore the unmistakable mark of Luna. "Focillo," Draco cast, "Focillo, Focillo," and Dobby seemed grateful, but still shivered. With a shudder, Draco took off the medallion he'd bought in Munich's wizarding street market, a tight spiral of thermal amber and garnet that promised 'a hearth within the heart' in winter. It belonged around Dobby's neck.
"Not before you ask your questions, Potter. Get what you came for. You won't believe me now that I figured you out, but ask them."
Draco had to rouse himself eventually to provide agreement to Mr. Weasley's rendition of events. "I know I agreed to come right back home with you," Draco lied, having no interest in giving Mr. Weasley suspicion towards his father to complicate matters. "But I'd cast a tracking charm on my cousin Luna, and I remembered just as we were going to Apparate... I didn't
"Thank you, Mr. Malfoy," Dumbledore said finally after waiting for Draco to change his answer, long enough that no one in the room could have missed that Dumbledore didn't believe him. "We will keep this book and investigate it thoroughly. Inform Miss Weasley that she must regrettably find herself another diary."
"I... I can't," she groaned. Draco's body felt shot through with power, like the lightning around them had struck them both, and made the top of the tower ready to collapse from the surge of energy there as for a fourth time, he cast Cauterizo on his mother's hand.
He didn't seem to notice that the other teachers were looking at him with something remarkably like hatred. Severus stepped forward, and the intent was palpable in the air even before he spoke, the exquisite malice. But Draco could barely even feel it, let alone enjoy it. He could feel his fingers going numb.
There was something too pitiful in Father's sobbing to listen to any longer. "Stupefy," Draco cast without any malice left, knocking Father out. He closed his eyes, taking a breath, trying to explain to himself what it was that he had just done-
"You get your wands out," Weasley instructed, as if he was a veteran of these things, and the memory of Lockhart's Dueling Club in second year hit Draco with a surreal partial déjà vu, hearing Weasley's quavering voice substituting out Severus's over a year too early. But Potter followed Weasley's instructions, so Draco had no choice but to get out his own wand.
"It was always going to be difficult for us to make by ourselves," she told him, and Draco tried not to snap at her. He managed, but it was a close thing. At least he had planned this to be a surprise, so Sirius and Remus weren't caught looking forward to being sent the potion and having to be disappointed. He and Hermione started again from scratch. It was a good thing they'd bought a lot of ingredients, and Draco had stolen a great deal from the Manor.
would want. They would rather I march down and start shooting off Avada Kedavras at all of them, sooner than throwing
"It might have had something to do with how I cursed this one," Draco drawled, throwing an arm around Finnigan's shoulder. "No hard feelings, eh, Finnigan?"
"You don't have to sound quite so pleased about that part," Hermione sniped. "As I recall, you were too occupied hurling on my shoes at the time to contribute."
He shouldn't have watched and listened, like he shouldn't have spied on so much between these two. But he wanted to protect Gilderoy, should things come to true humiliation or even violence. He owed the poor man that much. And the fire had showed him this already.
The snake proved as fascinating to Hagrid as a real creature, once Draco let slip that it looked rather like garden snakes at Malfoy Manor. Then nothing would do but for Hagrid to hear about all the creatures across the Manor and its grounds, which took some time. He seemed most fascinated by the albino peacocks. Draco told him of their work guarding the Manor, and showed Hagrid a faded scar or two on his arms, where the peacocks had gotten him when he was young. Hagrid's childlike enthusiasm was contagious. Draco found they had reached the Great Lake before he knew it, the impending sunset already a lovely pink over the water.
It took writing to get Draco's thoughts into any semblance of order, though he was paranoid enough to want to burn each sheet after he finished. He would have if he had his wand back. By all appearances, his mind had been hurled back to his 11-year-old body, which made the most likely suspects for this nonsensical occurrence time travel or psychotic break. Either would likely constitute breakage of his parole. Who knew where he was or what his body was doing if this was all in his head? And what if he really had escaped to the past, and returned to a team of Aurors, demanding an explanation for sinister spells detected at Malfoy Manor? What would he tell the Wizengamot if hauled ignominiously back before them, with no Saint Potter to plead for him this time?
"Luna doesn't think you ever had magical exhaustion at all," Hermione whispered as they made their way, down relievingly familiar moving steps. "She thinks it was just that you couldn't bring yourself to get out of bed, after what you saw."
Draco had thought there might be a thawing with the Gryffindors after their Polyjuice attempt at interrogation, if only out of shame on their part. But January saw them still keeping a cautious distance, although less so. Avoiding him was more difficult now that Hermione had become a hospital-bound cat.
Harry's teeth raked over his lower lip, pupils dilating and making his eyes darken. "Draco," he breathed, "If you think I don't think about that too, you really are mad..."
"How did you find that wand?" Father hissed, getting right in his face with that unsettling snarl. It made Draco remember Father's face the first time they ever visited him in Azkaban, stubble-covered and sunken like his own living ghost, enough bone showing through it gave him a dead-eyed permanent snarl. "How?" Father repeated, and in an instant was brandishing his wand at Draco's chest. The thump of the cane falling to the ground followed.
know about Dantanian- Severus, how am I supposed to look him in the eye again, knowing everything, and- I called you here because I think when he visits tomorrow, we should
He'd seen Severus in Defense yesterday. That might not have been enough of a window to satisfy Voldemort's appetite. But then again, it might have been. It depended on the level of creativity.
Only Grindelwald seemed concerned by his presence, a foreign one to him despite their meeting many years ago. He prodded at Draco's back in curiosity, as if this was no more than some light fare at the cinema, in a series he had dropped in on mid-run. "Who is that?" he whispered, but a transfixed Draco ignored him.
The papers the first day were all about Bluthers's testimony, although the photo on the cover was Sirius striding into the courtroom like a conquering hero in red and gold. Even Rita Skeeter's article was not without reference to "the stunning transformation of the savage Prisoner of Azkaban, now Bachelor of Azkaban. If acquitted, the ladies might be the ones looking to lock him down!"
"Come on, isn't it enough that I had to put up with that sod romancing my girlfriend the whole year?" Ron groused, while Hermione's cheeks turned a faux-cross pink at Ron's show of jealousy. "Can't
The next afternoon in the library, Potter and Ron were sitting with Hermione at their study table. Draco counted that as the weekend's fourth victory.
And here Draco and Father had been exchanging civil, if generic and largely untruthful letters this year, devoid of references to the Chamber of Secrets. He should have known better than to trust Father to behave.
First was Severus, shooting him a look at dinner. Draco could read him well enough to discern that roughly as,
"I don't understand you, Draco," Pansy said, and it was clear what had waylaid Draco's summoning of Luna by Millie. "I don't understand you at all. Ever since we went to school, it's like you've changed. Everything you used to hate, you love, and everything you used to love, you..."
Sirius had heard this story, but not in detail, and all Draco had done was pique his curiosity. He, Remus, Ron, and Draco ended up sitting up together by the fire until late in the night, trading stories of the year before Sirius's breakout. Remus's wanderings were something Draco had never heard about, nor Dumbledore's eventual recruitment of him to the Defense position. Nor had he heard about Sirius's time in Azkaban in quite this detail, and that part set his teeth chattering. There were memories of his own in Azkaban he couldn't share, and he just had to smile and nod as Sirius ended his story, as always, with the solemn wish that Draco and his friends would never even have to see the place, let alone reside in it.
Draco resolved to leave him a historically good present to make up for it. And he did make his own version of Mother's beautiful transfigured silver snowflake invitations, and send one off to Xenophilius Lovegood and his daughter. After all, family should be together at the holidays.
Draco had feared a dismal fate for his own presents to Severus, but only Lockhart's had suffered one. "The minute he unwrapped it and saw it, he threw it into his fireplace."
Severus was trying and failing to get in a word edgewise against Gilderoy. "Needless to say, I will require the assistance of a powerful wizard to complete Tempus Itinerantur. As well as his expertise in Transfiguration, above any that
Ginny came into the kitchen still in her nightgown, blearily rubbing her eyes and asking what was for breakfast. Her shriek when she noticed their visitors had arrived was enough to draw more Weasleys piling down the stairs in great excessive bursts. Ginny ran off to get dressed, while Mr. Weasley, the twins, Peter, and Ron squeezed themselves into the kitchen in turn. Ron and the twins accepted hugs from Hermione, while all but Peter got handshakes from Draco.
"He'd given him a tapestry for Christmas. A pretty meadow full of golden roses. Gold as in gilded for Gilderoy, I suppose."
I don't ever want us to be against each other. I didn't want to leave home. I didn't want to leave you alone with him. I just didn't have a choice after what I did. And I know it was my choice to do that, but I made that choice. And you can make that choice too.
!" Lupin snarled, with only a superficial resemblance then to the mousy, unassuming Defense teacher he had been. He hauled Black up by the rope on his throat and jabbed his wand in place beneath it. "Shut your mouth, how dare you, how
"Vipera relashio," Draco kept telling Sirius as they exited their dueling room. "The counter-curse is Vipera relashio,
But Potter was cheered when he somehow passed all his exams, and Ron and even Neville Longbottom did as well, a feat which Draco smugly attributed to himself, at least in the case of Potions. Hermione was top of the year for the third year running, with Draco second. He chose to attribute that to Hermione's suspiciously high marks in Muggle Studies, and not his own imperfect performance in History of Magic and Arithmancy. When they got the results, he could see her run excitedly right back over to Gryffindor table. He knew what they must be. Eventually, she came up to Slytherin with a remorseful look on her face. Draco rolled his eyes at her and flicked the H on her wrist before taking her for a walk.
"You fooled me, you say? No, I was not wrong in my assessment of your potential. Whatever you were in your future, you must have changed since then into something different." Grindelwald leaned forward, with the untroubled excitement of someone presented with a new puzzle that had nothing to do with him. "So the Mirror of Ecidyrue works, and you made a deal. For whom? I take it you're experiencing buyer's remorse? But how could you have made the mirror work
"I'll keep making you the Wolfsbane," Draco promised bravely, though of course he had no idea where he would supposedly be doing that, if alive to do it at all. "So that should help..."
"Enough," Severus said abruptly. "No more apologies. They..." In that strange moment, the spying Draco could see Severus likely remembering Draco's words, though they came out differently. "They do not suit you. I prefer you smiling."
," Draco called, in the same simpering tone. Ron tripped over his own feet, and nearly knocked Tony into Padma Patil's cleavage. Which from the looks of it, a medium-level soused Tony wouldn't have overly minded.
, beside the red mass of what had once been his heart. Draco thought he must be hallucinating, but he reached out and took it, and the silver shine under red was real between his fingers. It was something the size of his palm, and fit there like a still-beating heart.
"Of course I do! My grandmother had so many pictures. My mother made paintings from them. They covered the walls, when I was young. So you can't acknowledge me, so you probably
They went off on a tangent then, as Hermione demanded a number of unnecessary details about the functioning of the Fidelius charm, which seemed to fascinate her. But it was worth it if it helped convince her. She did finally seem to relax her death grip on his forearm, once her thirst for information was bestirred enough. Draco looked down as he regained possession of it, and saw half-moon nail marks deep in the skin.
It was a split-second decision whether or not to show mercy. And Malfoys were hardly known for mercy.
"There's something wrong with my wand. Mother said there was this name tied to it, something terrifying. It could change me, if it hasn't already- turn me bad- worse than I already-"
"...For the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points."
Draco was thinking what spell might show the symbols if they were hidden. But just tapping his wand between the first two words made the symbol appear. Again, only part of it lit up, this time the central line instead of the circle. None of the words were illuminated around those symbols, but it astounded Weasley still. When Weasley tapped his wand in the next space between words, nothing happened for him, but Draco's wand worked each time, with a total of 8 of the same symbol appearing, the line glowing in each. It was messing with his head, having to wonder now whether what he saw before him was the same as everyone else did. "Can you see these?"
If Harry was here to break up, he could have done Draco the courtesy of looking less gorgeous. His Muggle clothes were summer ones, light blue jeans and a plain red T-shirt that was fitted to him for once, showing off the muscles of his shoulders and bare biceps at nearly sixteen now, hair fully grown out, a year after he'd cut it so short. The overall effect was something that made it hard not to start mentally taking those clothes back off him. But Draco tried.
, and I won't care enough to try to figure out, so I suggest you begin exhibiting more of a Slytherin circumspection."
It was not hard to be a sharpshooter. Draco went to gather a second share of ginger root, an unnecessary trip that had Hermione watching him like a hawk. She was the only one to notice, though, as he moved his arm in the distinctive swooping circle and then curve downwards that only she knew to recognize, the talon wand held right tight to his wrist and thrumming as he cast once, twice, thrice passing the Slytherins and then Hufflepuffs. Slughorn was busy sucking up to Harry, and everyone else was concentrating on their Potions. Draco made sure of it before he moved his wand and whispered each time.
"Are..." Neville breathed, seeming to lose any memory of what their conversation had previously been about. "Are you planning to go to the wedding too, Luna? Are you asking if... if you want you and I to go together? Like a date-"
The list didn't seem to make anyone happy. Neville was confused. Hermione and Luna were indignant to find Ginny so low, complaining that Draco didn't even
? You might as well call it Fluffy. What, is it because it's alliterative? Norbert, Norwegian ridgetail? No, surely Hagrid can be made to see reason-"
"Ron and Draco have both gone mad," Potter said, with a tattletale instinct quite unlike his usual self. He must have been very protective over the mirror. "There's no need to-"
"I don't." Dantanian gave Taylor a fake but beautiful smile. Taylor stumbled, foot almost catching in a divet, before he hastened to catch up to his new colleague. "I'm excited to pick her out." Dantanian stopped at the first dragon they found unattended, a gentle and lazy-looking little creature that didn't reach higher than his waist. "What about this one?"
"Correct again, Mr. Malfoy. The diagram is still incomplete." McGonagall made sure she had his attention, then restored the blue line from 22 to 32 above the red line, letting it hover so he could see it. Then she lifted it and sent it linking in a circle around the pink figure's head, orbiting around it like a halo. "This is where the traveler's past would go, I would hazard. The only evidence of an old reality would reside in the traveler's mind."
"Just crystal and turquoise," Draco said with false modesty, "And yes, there's a charm that makes sure," but if anything, she looked less contented with that information.
Far better than the other Slytherin first-years, who Draco found himself watching from a safe distance in the common room, a place he usually avoided like the plague. He had to, once his resolution to ignore the duel had broken, and he'd been seized with the insane urge to find himself a second for the duel. He wasn't going to go, but he should figure one out anyway. Just in case.
The applause was thunderous as Sirius and Remus kissed, Sirius lingering so inappropriately long that Remus had to pry himself away, with a laughing, helplessly adoring smile.
"You were right, I did it, I did it, wasn't I marvelous," Ron babbled up at Draco, and Draco smirked over at Harry.
It made Draco's hands go out and clasp around the back of Harry's neck, holding him and staring into those darting green eyes, trying to get them to focus on him. Then they did, and Draco just had to keep reminding himself to breathe.
"Ah," Grindelwald sighed. "You will only give me the best, which I presume also means you will give me nothing. If I can only drink from the finest glass, then..."
"Okay," Harry said slowly, as if trying to talk himself into it. "I get that. I'd rather have you in my head than Voldemort." Then he ruined it by adding, "I mean, I
"They'll already be in the Department of Mysteries," Draco said, and they ran again. Draco led them through the empty hall, which had the eeriness of a ghost town, or a place some terrible atrocity had already been committed. But when he looked back, he saw the twins grinning.
"You think Draco's still at the Owlery?" Blaise's voice asked from outside the curtains. "Or just locked in bed like always?"
When he reached the Great Hall in his knot of terrorized purebloods, he saw Granger for once not apart from the other Gryffindor first-years, but beside Potter and Weasley, chattering together excitedly in their own world. It had been a familiar sight before, perpetually annoying but hardly surprising, and yet it sent an inexplicable rush of spite through Draco as he sat, his own distance from his classmates maintained. He had wanted to be an outsider, and he should be grateful Granger wasn't any longer, that she had taken her rightful place at Potter's side to keep him safe. Grateful she had that place by Potter, a place he could never have.
"My first thought was that the monster was a Basilisk," Draco cut in, trying to at least subtly plant the idea, "But when I told Severus he just laughed it off and dismissed the idea."
Chang pulled back, though, a bit chastened. "I didn't catch the Snitch, though. I never have against Harry, he's too good. I'm sorry, I wanted to for you, Luna- but it was still enough, wasn't it?"
Granger actually giggled, before covering her mouth and looking guilty. "Just give them a chance, alright?"
One morning, Obitus came to their door. He laughed as he asked for the hand of the eldest daughter, Sola, in matrimony, to replace the wife he had lost.
the Death Eaters at the graveyard!" Vince flinched back, and Blaise put a protective hand on his shoulder. "I'm not going to curse you, okay? Any of you! We're just talking! I just- what do you expect from me? For me to get Harry and Luna to leave your fathers out of it, because I'm friends with their
"Oppugno!" he cast, and just when Bellatrix had decimated the centaur, gasping for breath, the wizard and goblin attacked her too. Draco fell back against the rim of the fountain, gasping for breath. "Accio dagger," he whispered, and the moonstone dagger flew right to his hand, hilt falling into his palm with a snap. With a start, he realized that he had proven one of his greatest fears untrue without even noticing: the talon wand could cast spells against Aunt Bella.
Severus did not exactly suffer Draco's hug with a smile, but his attempts to free himself from were half-hearted at best. It made Draco think he didn't really mind.
"I'm not allowed to send owls," Gilderoy said sadly, "But perhaps, just receiving... and congratulations, Draco! Harry was quite the fine young man when I knew him. I'm sure he's become even finer still, from the stories I've heard of his heroics. Is he what you see in that mirror?"
have reached out to her sister. But the Dursleys, being what they are... they're out of your life for good."
"He's been more angry and depressed," Draco said, rolling his eyes, "Because he's been through some shit. He feels guilty the Dark Lord is back, he blames himself, half the school thinks he's an axe murderer, Dumbledore is ghosting him, Umbridge has it in for him, OWLs are coming and he's not ready at all, and oh, yeah, the person he likes won't reciprocate his- his attachment- which is exactly why he doesn't need
Hermione and Ron showed up about an hour later, to find the four of them clean and changed, but Draco ready to regale them with tales of his inhuman plight. They had a pile of candy awaiting from the trolley, which Ron descended upon like a swarm of locusts, while Hermione reported on the other prefects. Theo was the male Slytherin prefect, while Pansy was the female. Luna commented on how bad a time Ron had given Ravenclaw prefect Padma Patil last Christmas, at which every other occupant of the compartment tried to change the subject at the same time. Not one of them wanted to be reminded of that Yule Ball.
"You stand, Harry Potter, upon the remains of my late father," Voldemort hissed, with Draco approaching cautiously, straining to hear. "A Muggle and a fool... very like your dear mother. But they both had their uses, did they not? Your mother died to defend you as a child... and I killed my father, and see how useful he has proved himself, in death..."
He bit his lower lip, staring into the darkening spiral of wind that was fast becoming a tornado, and heard several snapping and cracking sounds he almost thought had to be the chain giving way. But when Periander told him to stop, the tornado cleared to reveal the chain intact. Even if some of the silver on it had rusted away. Periander had to send his bird over to restore it with some elegant swoops around, her wings giving off a scent somewhere between anise and rotting flesh.
Draco let himself into Severus's office in a hurry, only to stop dead when he saw not just Severus but Dumbledore there waiting for him. Draco knew then, though he didn't want to believe it was true, if only for the sake of the Wolfsbane. He would have checked it last night, if he'd had the slightest clue that he could be the one chosen for...
"I can't explain, Hermione's waiting, just trust me, you're not going to want to miss this, okay?" he demanded. "You have to make sure and be there. I'm not supposed to say, it's a surprise."
"And you have no idea what this hare-brained scheme was?" Severus said dryly. He sounded amused by how obvious he found Draco's hedging of the truth.
Ginny looked between them dubiously, lamentably quick on the update. "What is going on here, anyway? Why are you trying to help her, after they all dropped you and she talked shit about you in the Prophet? Are you two secretly still friends or something?"
"Langlock!" Draco tried, but he couldn't hit her through his own damn smoke, which was making tears pour down his face not from panic but from the sheer amount of his own magic he was inhaling into his failing lungs.
"You're so creepy," Draco said, and leaned over and kissed Harry like a punch to the mouth, both the pent-up tension of that awful party and the rush of seeing Harry's powers work on even the simplest of snakes coming together to put a force there that surprised them both, making Harry stumble back a few steps. His hands went quickly to Draco's hair, though, and he was licking into Draco's mouth with that clever, Parseltongue-gifted mouth before Draco was the one to pull away.
world has been deprived of him, as much as he has been deprived of it. Those who have had the pleasure to know the real Sirius, and not the monster he has been painted as, know him as an incredibly devoted, loyal, loving and caring man, whose great passion in life now, his
"I wouldn't usually," Draco said guardedly. "I'd at least tell my cousin. Keeping this secret- is just to protect the Slytherin who told me about it, like I said..."
Draco dragged Wormtail's corpse with him, the grave and Harry all he could see. Then he and Harry locked eyes, and then Harry called "Accio!" The cup soared through the air in a perfect arc, every second Hermione had spent drilling the summoning spell into that beautiful head not going to waste, as the handle hit Harry's bloody palm with the cut. Harry's wand went into his pocket, as he grabbed Draco's wrist with the other hand. Draco kept his grip on the corpse as the Portkey began to work, whirling them out of the darkness and shadow, out of the high shrieking of Voldemort as his failure was complete, the Boy Who Lived living yet again, with his betrayer and his betrayer's victim on the way back home...
"It was just because he was supporting me, it wasn't that he did anything wrong," Sirius said protectively, putting an arm around Remus's shoulders, and the Grangers misinterpreted.
of me?" Millie scowled, refusing to answer, and that was worse than a denial or an agreement. "Well, Mills, I thought the forest was just more paranoia on your part over discovery, but instead it seems this has become your proverbial gymnasium. Taking it a bit overboard, isn't it, to risk this place so often to keep your secrets?"
"No," Draco and Neville's gran, apparently called Augusta, said at the same time. She looked like an Augusta.
Harry brought Draco's hand to his lips to kiss, and nuzzled against it, pressing his face into it with wild affection, like he was the one unworthy to be touching the other, and at any second he would lose that touch forever.
"Do any of you recognize this wand?" Mr. Diggory demanded, holding it high in the air, where the Dark Mark was considerate enough to illuminate it for them.
- it wouldn't be so bad, to have that on me- but I'm rambling, and you don't want to hear that sort of- perversion-"
"Do you think he was lying to keep you in line," Draco asked carefully, "Or that he simply didn't know how it really worked? I mean, maybe people who entered that water... didn't tend to come out."
"And to pay my respects. I asked him for the Resurrection Stone, you know. And he never had it, but he did say he searched for it once, because," and here was a piece of truth that might win the day for the lie, "He told me he would have used it to bring Ariana Dumbledore back."
"Crucio," Draco said, and had the snake writhing in pain before Periander could finish his sentence. Practice had made it much easier to draw in the concentration he needed. Besides, with his father in the room, it was never difficult to summon up negative energy. "Enough?"
Something was prickling again at the back of his contended mind, the voice trying to come back to life, but it was halted when he imagined Harry stepping into the tower, having left all his friends and fame and glory to be alone with Draco Malfoy. There was no part of him that kept questioning then, because he wanted to see Harry, wanted to be selfish. He wanted to be the center of Harry's world for one night. He wanted to give Harry everything he had ever wanted. He wanted to
Being social and putting on a brave face for his fellow Slytherins was as uniquely exhausting as it had always been. He was grateful when Dumbledore's real speech came. This one dragged on, naturally, when Draco was flagging and fantasizing about going to bed. The storm was still loud, as if to forecast just how terrible Dumbledore's idea to hold the Triwizard Tournament would turn out to be. Or maybe it wouldn't, if Draco had anything to say about it.
I didn't think you had such a literal mind. The only thing dying will be the connection between you and Nurmengard."
The torrent of facts sunk into Draco's mind and left him even more numb. Put all together, it sounded impressive, except throughout it all, he had almost never had any idea what he was doing. "But what does that have to do with you, Severus?"
"You know the future," Grindelwald said in beaming happiness. "Do tell me about one subject, then." Draco shot him daggers. "Myself only. You cannot begrudge me that curiosity." Draco agreed, and Grindelwald's impishness made him look positively young. "Did we ever meet in- what should I say, the past timeline? I take it you've been sent back
of hate mail. Flitwick had to call him to his office and gently admonish him for using Incendio to vaporize the letters in the air as they arrived. "You should check at first, they could be legitimate post. And you're scaring the first-years." As for the curse, he only insinuated that he suspected Draco behind it, but of course no one had any proof, and Flitwick didn't outright accuse him. No one did. "I do hope that the victims of the red-handed curse will get better in time," Flitwick merely observed, as he let Draco go.
So far, in between duels and research, they had seen a film called Independence Day about aliens invading the Earth, with a pleasing quantity of explosions, and an animated musical called The Hunchback of Notre Dame. The Grangers decided that Draco was a Disney devotee in the making. They insisted he stay and watch one of Hermione's old favorite Disney films with them. As much as Sirius and Remus seemed to disconcert them, they always seemed happy for a bonding opportunity with Draco.
- will somewhat buy that I'm just going to ransack the Munich university library like I say I am, for anything about the Hallows. It's how it has to be, if we don't want to be caught."
