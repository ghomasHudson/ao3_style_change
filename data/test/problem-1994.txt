“What?” Draco smiled at seeing how his friend blushed. “No, of course not!” Greg muttered something else and took a sip of his beer.
Harry: Did you know that ducklings and puppies are like little Pansy Parkinsons, waking up at ungodly hours?
They took a step back to admire their hard work. Harry frowned and Scorpius looked in disapproval at the big tree.
He went straight to the bathroom and decided to take a long bath. He picked one of the books James kept there for when he was on the toilet, and forgot about his problems while the warm water relaxed his muscles and his mind got lost in the romantic novel he had chosen.
The last sun rays entered the library bathing everything in a beautiful red and orange light. However, their group and their classmates didn't have time to enjoy it. The NEWTs were coming closer and closer, and the amount of work the teachers expected of them grew every day.
“Did you come here with your parents too? It’s hard to think of them eating in a place like this one,” Harry said, looking around.
“We’ll have to find the person who dreams with you, and maybe…” She stopped talking, and Draco raised his head to look at her. She was biting her lip and staring at the wall in front of them.
Draco stared at the door. Was Michael there? What would he want? Maybe Draco had forgotten something in his flat and he had come to return it? He swallowed and forced his legs to move. It wasn’t a good idea to make Michael wait for too long.
Harry: Yup. Me. Astoria fixed everything and sent me home. I went to the Burrow and played with all the kids though. I needed some happiness.
“Yes, but, listen, this is more important!” He waved a hand near Theo and Pansy so they looked at him too, and began to tell them what he had heard. “He wants me to be his soulmate!” He signed excitedly once he finished.
“Lay the table, please.” He hated that chore. It made him feel like he was going to make a mistake, and put out cutlery for three instead of just for two. He supposed that putting that task on a child wasn’t fair either. “We’ll talk about it, okay?”
“Do soulmates dreams show you your kinks?” Harry’s voice was suddenly very high pitched, and he looked nervous.
Harry’s body was closer and closer to the ground, and still, it seemed like none had noticed. He couldn’t lose him. He tried again. He closed his eyes for a second, and thought about Harry, about his smile, about how happy his presence made him, and let the memory of those happy moments overcome his scared mind. Then cast the spell.
“And what do I get in exchange? A brute that doesn’t even wash his hands before hugging his wife,” she says, an eyebrow raised, and laughing softly at Harry’s blush. “Don’t worry, I love you anyway. Merlin knows why.”
“Yes,” she looks to the garden through the window again. They’re playing that muggle sport she hates but surprisingly the two little menaces adore. “And it looks like my dear husband is losing against two children. I’ll better go help him before he cries.”
“I don’t think they’ll take it well that you and I are together. They’ll think you’re up to something, that you want to hurt me or… I don’t know.”
Harry: I sent Pansy a smug note, but I don’t think she understood it because she sent me a very rude drawing (why doesn’t she use a smartphone like everyone else? You purebloods are the weirdest people on Earth, I swear!).
I park in the street where Harry’s shop is, but far away enough from it so he doesn’t see me. His car is still parked outside, so I know he’s there. I breathe in and out, in and out, trying to calm myself down, trying to forget what I’m about to do. I try to listen to the radio, but it puts me in a bad mood. Michael leaves. I won’t have to wait too long now. A few minutes later, Harry leaves too, closes the door, and goes to his car. I start mine and wait. When he leaves, I follow him.
“What are you doing here? Can’t I have a moment of peace?” he signed quickly. He was a bit annoyed because he was sure that this time it would have worked.
“You’re only taking five NEWTS so stop whining,” Draco signed with lazy fingers. He was so tired. He stretched, and let out a huge yawn.
“Fancy dinner. Do you think I’m dressed well enough for it?” Harry stood very still in front of Ron, and his friend snorted.
Draco took his time to shower, and ignored Pansy when she asked him if he wanted her to wait for him. When he finally heard, Susan Bones and Daphne Greengrass had  left the lockers, he went out too.
Minutes later, when their food arrived, Draco burst out laughing. Harry looked confused at his dish, full of something that looked very similar to spaghetti with some clams.
Harry nodded. That was exactly how he felt too. He hoped that soon enough they could be as friendly as they were in the notes.
“Don’t be ridiculous! The bed is big enough for the two of us, and it’s not like we aren’t used to sharing it, is it?” Draco said. He couldn’t be sure because it was dark, but he thought that Harry blushed.
“If there’s no difference, then why are you so eager that I tell them now?”Harry’s looked at him, eyes flashing with anger, and just a second before he said it, Draco knew what was coming. “If you can’t wait, maybe we should break up.”
Draco, Pansy, and Greg looked around. The flat was small, but cosy, as it said in the ad Draco had seen in
I went to the park after that, and the ducks were being cute. I like Feather for a duck's name. What do you think?
“No idea,” Draco answered. “He doesn’t have pictures in the house, and I’m not going to look in his private things either!”
. They’re looking in the lake. It’s hard to find something so small as a corpse in such a big space, but they have spells for that.
Draco snorted, and kept eating. He had missed this place. It felt good to be back, if only for a few hours, and revive the memories of all those past holidays in the summer house. However, being there with Harry added a new exciting memory.
Her flat is small but cozy. I know she lives —lived— alone so after making sure none of her neighbours are on sight, I open the door and go inside. I put on the gloves once again and look around. She has a lot of pictures on a little table in the living room, but Harry isn’t in any of them. There are a few fashion magazines on a side table, and the dirty dishes from last night's dinner are still in the sink.
“I’m going to look for another book,” Draco signed, and then looked sternly at Pansy and Theo, “Don’t look at my essay. Blaise, don't let them copy.”
Harry: If you did, I'm not forgiving you for not telling me. No wait. I'm not forgiving you for introducing Pansy Parkinson into my life.
Harry left the note just before leaving for work. He had one of those shifts ahead that lasted way too long and left him completely knackered. However, it was full moon night, so he was glad he’d be at the hospital, as his worry for Sarah had only grown in the past days.
“Yes,” Harry said. They were silent for a few seconds, and he added in a quieter voice. “It’d be better if I knew who they are, you know? Or, well, I…” He stopped, and Draco went a bit closer, not wanting to miss anything. “I wish it’s someone I know. I wish… I wish it was Draco. Do you think that’s possible? He did say he was having weird dreams too.”
Harry: How can I be happy when your friend Pansy Parkinson invites herself to have lunch with me and asks me how she, and I'm quoting her here, "can satisfy Ginevra sexually"?
“I was just going to say that we have to be careful to catch the snitch once we’re winning by twenty points!” Weasley said.
Harry: DRACO! FUCK! PANSY'S GOING TO KILL ME! WHAT IF SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING TO THEM BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT THEM TO KNOW!! FUCK FUCK FUCK I'M DEAD.
“It’s nothing,” Draco signed. He had been worried out of his mind since the match. Weasley and Granger had gone to the Hospital Wing as soon as they allowed them to visit their friend, and had returned to the common room saying that Harry was well but unconscious. That morning it had been the same, so Draco was glad to find Harry awake and without consequences for the hit on the head. “Are you alright now, then?”
“I’m fine now. And it was you who told me to go away in the first place,” Draco said, crossing his arms.
“Your only fear is about Weasley and Granger’s reactions, right? Or is there something else?” Draco asked, already feeling awful for mentioning this, instead of going on with the snogging session they had planned.
He got up, placed Draco’s legs with care on the sofa again, and then kissed his forehead before leaving, making Draco melt a little. He knew it was stupid, but he felt so ugly and so unlike himself lately that he was surprised Harry still loved him.
Draco took his hand and dragged him to the bedroom, where before either of them could change their minds, he closed the gap that separated them and kissed him. Harry kissed him back, wrapping his arms around Draco’s body. When they pulled apart to breathe, Draco smiled, and Harry looked at him like he was the most beautiful person he had ever seen. Something warm expanded in Draco’s chest.
Harry kissed the scars on his chest with care, as if his kisses could make them heal, and then sucked his nipples. Draco kissed him wherever he reached; a hand, a shoulder, the forehead, and buried his hands in Harry’s hair.
“I don’t know. It just feels… weird that he wants to be with me after all the things I’ve done.” Draco took a sip of his glass and made a grimace. He didn’t like alcohol. He left the glass on the side table.
Harry: Today, I’m taking Leo and Cassie out to the park. It’s cold, but sunny, so the perfect day to be outside playing with a puppy or swimming in a lake if you’re a duck, right?
“They’re cute! Rats, he says!” Draco saw it as soon as the thought formed in Harry’s mind, because his eyes shone with mischief. And sure enough, a second after Harry jumped over Draco, sitting on his belly, and began to tickle him mercilessly. “Take back your words!” Draco laughed and squirmed, trying to free himself, although he couldn’t move under Harry’s weight. “Say they’re cute!”
Michael looked intently at him, and Draco felt himself break into a million tiny pieces. This had happened before. Lots of times. Michael reminded Draco of how useless he was, and Draco broke a little and agreed with him. Michael cupped Draco’s face over the table, and he stayed still, afraid of moving and fearing what Michael was about to do. He didn’t want to be with him. He didn’t want Michael to kiss him. However, he seemed unable to move, and so Michael’s lips captured his for what felt like an eternity.
“At 7 in your flat. I want to see it,” Radwah said, as she caused a small explosion when she added the frog brains to her potion.
Harry: Paperwork is fun. Paperwork is fun. Paperwork is fun. Paperwork is fun. Paperwork is fun. Paperwork is fun.
The four of them got up with excitement, though Draco wasn’t about to drop the subject so easily. They left for the landing, and a few minutes later — they had to wait for Pansy because she had forgotten her purse inside — they went downstairs and to the café where, with a piece of cake before them, it was more rewarding to discuss Harry’s intentions.
Harry: I’m home again. This is so depressing without you, Draco, at least I have Cassie and Leo. They looked very cute with the Christmas jumpers Molly knitted for them.
I firecall Harry at work. We should rid his work desk of evidence, too. And hers. Michael, another of his coworkers, answers my call and tells me that Harry isn’t there. I roll my eyes at his incompetence. I have to do everything myself, then. I get the rubber gloves we have in the kitchen, put them in my bag, and then step through the floo.
“They won’t. We’re safe. We were at home that night. Together. Now we just have to fake in front of everyone. None will know anything.”
He had forgotten how handsome Michael was. His smile looked almost out of place in the dark shop. His eyes, however, looked cold, like they had when he broke up with Draco.
Harry picked up one of the expensive quills, and caressed his face with the feather. Draco would kill him if he saw him now. He tore a bit of parchment, and wrote:
It was two goals later when it happened. Draco had had to slow down to dodge a bludger Peakes threw, and when he wanted to go back to the match he was behind most of the other players that were gathered around Ron’s goal. He made his broom move forwards, but a movement to his left caught his attention. He wasn’t the only player on that side of the pitch. Harry had seen the snitch and was flying quickly towards it.
After I fainted at the portkey station and some good people helped me recover, I went back home and cried. I cried for hours, for our broken relationship; for my own idiocy at not recognizing who Yours really was; for Padma, dead in a lake; and for myself.
“You heard me.” Draco was immensely enjoying the effect his words had had. “I’m going to help him with some potions.”
“You didn’t believe him, right?” Suddenly it was very important to Harry that Draco knew how likable he was. It hurt him seeing him so small. “When he said that nobody would like you, you didn’t believe him, right?”
Ron didn’t insist, and Harry kept looking at the rain. Would the sweater stop smelling so good if he wore it often?
His parents kissed him and hugged him before disappearing in the fireplace. This is lonely, he thought, alone in the drawing room and with his huge body anchoring him to the sofa. However, he didn’t have to wait too long until Harry came back and helped him go upstairs and into the deliciously hot and calming bath he had run for him.
“That’s because you’re a nosy bastard,” he said, smirking when she showed him her middle finger. “He’s kind of cute, though.”
The first step of my plan leads me to Gringotts. I have to wait ten minutes before a goblin is free to guide me to our vault. I take as much money out as I’m allowed without having to sign any parchments, as the vault is shared with Harry and they need both our signatures to empty it. It doesn’t matter. We have enough for me to leave the bank with a good sum. I put it all in my satchel, charmed to carry an infinite amount of things without it being too heavy. Then I change some of it into muggle money.
“But you like Potter,” Greg pointed out. “And I’m not talking about your crush now. I’m talking about the weird thing you have with him here, with the bed, the notes and all that.”
“Weasley is devastated we lost against Gryffindor. I think he’ll hex you once he sees you’re well,” Draco signed, smiling a little, although he was sure Harry wasn’t paying attention to him. He looked at him, but as if he hadn’t looked at Draco before, and when they locked eyes, Harry blushed and averted his gaze. “Are you sure you’re alright?”
“Take off the socks, you weirdo!” Draco exclaimed when he saw that Harry had left his on. Harry laughed and took them off, then kept kissing Draco everywhere.
“Why do you think he hates you? I can’t stand Potter, but I don’t think he’s the kind of person who deceives someone in the way you’re implying here.”
The doorbell woke Harry up. Drinking coffee before going to sleep had been a novice mistake, so he had had problems falling asleep, which was why he was in such a bad mood when the insistent noise woke him up.
Harry: I’m scared of this sometimes, because, yes, my father and his family were from India, but I’m not. Do I have any right to enjoy this? To be part of it? I feel like I’m intruding somewhere I don’t belong, but I didn’t belong with the Dursleys either, right? I was not white enough.
“Just a few seconds until the street stops moving,” Harry said. “I don’t like Apparition. Brooms are better.”
Draco Malfoy. Harry had been sharing his flat, his life, with Draco Malfoy. He unfolded the note where Dray, Drac-, Malf-, Dray had written his confession and stared at it. One part of Harry wanted to snap and throw him out of his house. But a bigger one refused. He was Dray, after all. He liked his roommate a lot, and maybe had started to develop a small crush on him. Of course, he couldn’t forget that Dray had lied to him, or had hidden the truth. Names weren’t necessary in magical contracts, so Dray hadn’t felt the need to say his.
“Of course it wasn’t!” Draco snapped and regretted it instantly. He shouldn’t make it so easy for him to guess.
“Do it.” Sarah looked at her mother and Harry with hopeful, big eyes. “Mom, please. It hurts a lot.”
3.- He’s running away with her. They’ve been having an affair for Merlin knows how long. They love each other. She’s Yours, and Harry loves her, even if she doesn’t know him at all. They’re going to live in Spain together, in a nice flat near the sea. Harry will forget about me, except to send me the divorce papers.
“You’re lost without me. You can’t even choose a nice flat. You’re pretty useless when living on your own, Dee.”
Draco opened the door of his father’s studio but didn’t dare to take a tiny step inside until Lucius looked at him, eyebrows raised in surprise.
“Blaaaaiiise! Draco had been nice these past days, don’t anger him now. I can’t stand another week like the last one!” Pansy said. She looked tired too, and Draco noticed that she had given up on her Charms essay and had drawn some flowers in the margin.
Harry got up, wrapping Draco in an embrace and kissing him, then he made Draco stand so he could kneel in front of him. Draco shivered in anticipation.
“I thought you had seen it before, that time in the bathroom. I can hide it if you want or —” Draco bit his lip. He looked a bit tiny too, like that time when Michael had almost barged into their flat. Years ago Harry would have said something nasty, but now that he knew Draco, he only wanted to hug him and reassure him that all was well.
Lucius nods, and they get up. They go to the second floor in silence, and Draco thinks about how different these visits to her parents are from how it used to be when she was a teenager. Then, her father was her favourite person. She told him everything and trusted him to fix every problem she had, even if ‘fixing it’ meant just ranting about it. However, in the last years it's been as if there’s a wall between them. She can’t tell him everything as she isn’t sure he listens to her and not to the child he thinks he has.
“Yes, Father,” she says, the chance too good to let it go away. “Why were you so worried about Harry’s homework?”
“Tomorrow, you’ll go to the Aurors. You’ll tell them that you were having an affair with Parvati and that Padma discovered it, that’s why she had all the pictures and notes in her flat.”
“Are you going to Weasley and Granger’s house?” he asked when they were standing in the alley they used for Apparitions.
“I still have to write a few inches about the defensive curses, that’s why I woke up so early. Do you want to go to the library now with me?” Pansy asked, as she cleaned her lips with a napkin.
As always Harry’s name was mentioned, Lucius let out a long sigh. He had taken the news of Draco and Harry dating better than Draco had expected, but he still had some opinions about it.
The intelligent thing would have been to throw it into the lake. Water destroys everything. Bodies can be submerged for days under water until they’re too full of gas to reappear on the surface again. Maybe we’re lucky and that won’t happen with Padma’s body. Maybe algae keeps it in the bottom of the lake. Maybe when —if— they find the body, they’ll think the broken neck was an accident.
The next week didn’t go fast enough for Draco. He couldn’t focus on his work enough, and even Radwah had to call him out a few times. He was too impatient for Saturday.
Harry: BUT I hugged Goyle. Merlin, Draco! He's such a nice hugger! He's so big I felt like the entire world was hugging me. It felt so SO comfy there…
However, his silence was worrying Harry, who bit his lip, and whatever thoughts he was having cast a shadow over his expression.
“Dee?” Michael ignored her. “It’s important. You haven’t answered my letters, and we need to talk about your boyfriend.”
“That was Theodore’s experiment. I don’t know if he was trying to make a drink or a poison,” her father says, taking a seat on one of the armchairs in front of the fireplace.
I go to a cafeteria that’s just down the street and sit on a table near the window. That way, I can spy on Parvati. A waiter with a bushy mustache asks me what I want with a funny look.
Harry laughed and took it off while Draco looked with hungry eyes. Yes, that was better. He let out a gasp when he felt Harry’s hands on him, undoing the buttons of his shirt now. He didn’t wait for him to finish before taking it off over his head.
“No. I heard him talking to his friends about dreaming with his soulmate’s voice. His soulmate was singing, and has a beautiful voice, apparently.” He had been standing in front of Pansy, but when he finished, he dropped down beside her.
Harry made sure all was in order with Sarah’s pillows and sheets, and left to see his next patient. If he focused on his job hard enough, he could almost forget about the note he had left at home and about the fear it caused him to think about what he’ll find when he arrived home.
“I’m sorry, Draco,” Theo signed, “but I agree with Blaise. It’s great that Potter likes you that much, but, as you just told us, he’s dreaming with someone else’s voice. It isn’t possible it’s you.”
“I just don’t want to go now,” Scorpius said. He picked up the forks and knives, and closed the drawer with a little too much force. Forks and knives for two.
“It’s difficult and no everybody is able to do it,” Harry said with a calm expression that only managed to infuriate Draco.
. His cheeks were burning. He could have said anything else, literally anything else, but he had to say that.
Harry: Merlin, Draco! I begged Robards to give me a case again, because doing paperwork was making me want to kill someone, so he agreed and… well… it didn’t go well.
Harry: Should I go back to work? I don't feel like working. I feel like staying in bed all day hugging Leo. Hermione says that isn't good for my mental health, but how can she know how grief feels? Ron is there with her, alive!
Harry: I also tried to teach Leo some tricks, but as I keep forgetting that he can't hear me, it's going slowly. Sometimes I remember, so now he knows that when I point to the door, it means we're going out and he runs excitedly around the living room.
Draco snorts at her husband’s words, and Scorpius lets out a small giggle. Scorpius is usually so quiet that hearing him laughing so much makes Draco’s heart float with happiness.
This time Harry didn’t wait outside or knock, he just went in. He said a loud ‘hello’ to let Draco know he was there, and just a minute later, he was staring at a beautiful Draco. He had his hair in that casual messy way Harry liked so much, and was wearing black trousers and a silky shirt that showed his forearms. Bright grey eyes filled with excitement stared back at him. Suddenly, he felt very shy and very brave at the same time.
They had left the restaurant after the desserts and had gone straight to their flat. Draco had made some sexual innuendos, and Harry had too, and now, standing in the living room, he didn’t know what to do. He knew what he wanted: to kiss Harry senseless and maybe something else. Something more daring than a few caresses. But he didn’t know if Harry wanted it too.
He noticed Draco looking and smiled shyly . Draco smiled back, and making sure the professor couldn’t see him, he signed a quick lucky bastard. Blaise’s smile grew bigger.
“Not especially,” she said with a bored voice, but the blush that had appeared on her cheeks didn’t fool Draco.
Draco showed him his middle finger. When he was close enough to Harry's bed, he sat on the chair next to it, and threw him the present he had brought.
Harry: I bet you’d want me to live in a castle, in the middle of nowhere, dressed only in black, and be a dramatic sighing widower for the rest of my life. But according to Ron, you’d want me to be happy, and he’s sure he’s right.
“Excuse me?” Harry asked, his voice with that tone that Draco knew so well by now; the tone of vetoing a name. “We’re not naming our child
“I’ll see you soon, Dee,” Michael whispered when he pulled apart. “At your flat, in a few weeks, okay? I have a business trip now, but then we’ll talk about this, about us.”
Harry: We had a busy and stressful weekend around here. Cassie got hurt, so I called Luna but she was in Finland (no idea what she's doing there though), so I had to take care of her hurt wing, and give her all the love I could. She's alright now!
Draco put a spoonful of crushed newt eyes in the bubbling potion he was brewing, and took a step backwards so the purple smoke that left the cauldron didn’t burn him.
aren’t going to brew anything,” Draco pointed out. “I’m going to brew them in the potion’s shop I work in. I asked my boss, and he said it was alright. Come on, let’s go to the alley here to Disapparate.”
It all went down on Saturday, when during the quidditch training he threw the quaffle at Dean Thomas’s head on purpose because he made a comment about him and Seamus going to Hogsmeade later to celebrate their anniversary.
Harry launched himself in a detailed explanation of how much it had improved Sarah’s life, and it made him even happier seeing how Draco glowed with pride at his work.
Harry smiled against him, and then locked their mouths together. Draco could only abandon himself to the kiss they shared.
When he went to the bedroom, he let out a gasp. Why would someone have so many cushions? And what was he supposed to do with all of them? He couldn’t leave them on the bed or he’d have to sleep on the floor, and throwing them to the floor didn’t feel like a nice thing to do. In the end, he put them at one side, under the soft blanket Dray had left on the bed, and went to sleep.
“Leave us, it won’t be long,” Draco said, smiling reassuringly at them when they left for another table. Michael sat down in Pansy’s chair. “What do you want? And how do you know where I live?”
Draco shook his head. It was like Harry’s words had awakened him from his astonishment. He called Harry’s attention by waving a hand near him, and when he was sure he had his undivided attention, he answered.
Thanks so much, all of you!! Your comments have been amazing and I can't say how much they mean to me! I was so excited writing this fic, and then sharing it with you! It has been an amazing experience!
2.- They’re business partners. Harry’s and Michael’s shop is a successful business. They have opened shops in other countries, that’s why Harry is going to Spain now. A good marriage doesn’t need the spouses to tell everything to each other. I know that because of my parents. I don’t tell him everything, and he keeps his secrets too, especially the ones related to his job. That’s why he hasn’t told me about Parvati being one of his business partners too. It isn’t necessary for our marriage that I know that boring information. And the hand holding? See possibility 1.
. The walls were a soft cyan blue, and the furniture was a weird but nice mix, from a modern sofa to an old looking kitchen that was hidden from the living room by a wall.
“Of course I want!” Harry almost shouted. He sat on the bed facing Draco and took his hands on his. “Can I hug you, my saviour?” He asked in a hushed tone.
Draco swallowed, and forced himself to smile again. He should be happy that his soulmate had a soulmate, right? It was the kind of thing he should be happy about, although it wasn’t him. Was he getting too depressing, thinking always about the same thing?
He knew he couldn’t sleep after the dream, so he dressed, and left the room quietly. He planned to go to the library for a few hours before the first class to look for more information about his dream, but Pansy was in the common room, and dragged him to the Great Hall to have breakfast.
He glanced at Draco, but there wasn’t anything he could do to help him at that moment, so he turned to the fireplace and floo-called Ron. When he was done, he looked around but didn’t see Draco. As Michael kept screaming and hitting the door, Harry assumed Draco was still inside, so he went to the bedroom.
Harry: But she doesn’t know about that time Pansy woke you up at 5am because they were opening that clothing shop in London, and you hexed her.
“Are you free next Saturday?” Draco asked. “We can go buy all the ingredients we need in the morning, and then brew some of the potions in the afternoon and on Sunday.”
“Well, you’re two people sharing a flat now. It’s normal he wants to put his touch there too,” Hermione said.
Harry entered the room of his favourite patient. Obviously, he wasn’t allowed to have favourites, but the little werewolf girl reminded him too much of Teddy for him to be neutral.
I hug him and kiss him, but he moves away from me after a second. He must be tired after his long trip.
Harry: Paperwork isn’t fun. I’m so bored, I want to die. I think I’m going to George’s shop to have some fun and to get my will to live back.
“We’ve already ordered,” Pansy said as a greeting, and pointed to the beers and chips in front of them.
. They’re speculating about the reasons Padma could have had to disappear or the reasons someone could have had to make her disappear. One of them is a jealous boyfriend, and an idea takes form in my mind.
He put on his pajamas and laid in his bed with the curtains closed. He yawned. The teachers were losing their minds because of the NEWTS, making them work harder and harder with every day that passed, even when the exams were still weeks away. He was sure he’d pass them, although the practical exams scared him a little. He always had more problems than his classmates learning the spells, and hexes. Apparently, it was easier to cast them verbally, but that had never been an option for him. He was sure there had to be an option for people like him, so mute or deaf first year students could be as good as their classmates, but Hogwarts hadn’t discovered it yet.
I'll be updating the fic these days. I have all written and betaed, but I have to fix some things yet. Besides, I've always wanted to post a fic chapter by chapter 😂 I'm a simple girl, with simple dreams.
“Are you going to tell us what the hell is wrong with you today?” Blaise finally snapped at dinner after Draco made a very petulant remark.
Draco felt how his cheeks blushed. His crush on Potter had been legendary back at school. He doubted there was a Slytherin in their class that hadn’t heard about it.
He made up his mind. Who could he trust more than his soulmate? He needed someone who listened to him, who calmed him down a little, someone that just held him, and not started plotting something to fix his life. He needed a soulmate, even if it just worked as a friend, and nothing else.
“I’m home,” Draco said in a stronger voice than Harry expected. “When are you going to understand that I’m not with you anymore, that I live here now? You broke up with me. You told me to leave your flat. Deal with it and leave me the fuck alone.”
“Pretty good. He’s very easy to live with, although I suspect he’s fattening me up with all the cakes he bakes.”
He took them off, and Harry did the same, hurriedly, without taking their eyes off each other. Draco was sure that the other man would disappear if he stopped looking at him.
Harry: We played Monopoly too, and I'm happy to tell you that your husband is the rich proprietor of Hogsmeade, Diagon Alley, and Knockturn Alley! I also own hotels in all of those places, but I don't know if you could afford a stay there! Sorry, hun.
. Couldn’t that be enough? Couldn’t Harry’s wish fulfil the soulmate gap? They liked each other, and they wished to be together. It had to count.
“Yeah, they can’t come back for another four years, and, honestly, I don’t think they will. They have their life there now.”
“It’s interesting that both of you are having the same dream every night,” Pansy signed carefully, as if she was scared of saying the wrong thing and hurt Draco, “but it’s not like both of you are dreaming about the same thing. And there’s the problem of the voice, Draco. I think Granger is wrong, and you shouldn’t get your hopes up about this. If I were you, I’ll try to find the person that has you as their soulmate and forget about Potter.”
His father looked offended at that, but Draco didn’t care. He couldn’t believe he had been that close at naming his precious daughter something as egregious as Ruth. He rubbed his belly, asking the baby for forgiveness.
“You can drink water. Why are you always so difficult? Besides, don’t you want to see Greg?” he smirked at her.
“Yes!” Harry gave him a one-arm hug, and kissed him on one cheek. Draco made himself comfortable on his boyfriend's chest, and sighed happily. “You’re wonderful. Don’t let your brain tell you otherwise.”
It doesn’t take them that long after all: during Saturday’s evening, they find a body in the lake. Hours later, it is confirmed that Padma Patil is dead, and that she was probably murdered. However, we’ll have to wait for the autopsy.
During the Potions class and all the ones he shared with Harry that day, he could feel his eyes on him. Harry liked mysteries and right now, with no Dark Lords around, Draco was the biggest mystery out there. However, Draco couldn’t let him know. He couldn’t do that to Harry, as much as he wanted to put out all his rage on him.
“How does it sound like? Anyone you know?” he signed, and for the first time it occurred to him that Harry might know who the beautiful voice he had been hearing in his dreams belonged to. Suddenly his stomach felt very heavy and empty at the same time.
“Do you want to move to that old, mouldy, cheap flat we visited in Knockturn Alley, or with that man that looked like he hadn’t taken a shower since 1960?”
“It’s a young gentleman, I’m afraid,” Harry said. There was something about her that made him trust her with his secrets.  “We live together, you know. And I’m starting to really like him, but we have a history, a not so nice one at that, so...it’s complicated.”
“It’s not that…” Harry bit his lip. “Fine. I don’t want to bother them so late. I’m Apparating us now!”
I make sure no one is in the hall, and I leave the flat. I’m crossing the street, congratulating myself on a job well-done, when something makes me turn my head to Padma’s building and I see her. Parvati Patil doesn’t see me, but I see her entering the building. She might have come looking for her sister.
When I wake up, Harry isn’t here. I look everywhere but he must have gone to work. I’m too nervous to wait for him to do something. Knowing him, and I know him better than anyone else, he’ll show his nervousness; he’ll look guilty, and he’ll have left a thousand bits of evidence behind for the Aurors to discover.
“Malfoy and you living together and you thinking he’s cute, and funny, and sleeping in the same bed as him? No, Harry, it’s normal and it isn’t going to end in disaster,” Ron said with his eyes still very open, which made him look like a crazy man.
Draco and Harry laugh at Lucius' discomfort while he hugs Lily awkwardly, although the child doesn’t seem to notice.
“Say what?” Harry asked, although he didn’t fool Draco; he knew all too well what he was talking about.
He looked at the lake again. It would be great if Harry was right, if the voice he heard was Draco’s or, well, some magical voice supposed to be Draco’s. They were friends, they had an amazing relationship, and they knew each other better than anyone; they were perfect for each other already. Draco thought that maybe that’s everything he was getting out of this. Maybe he didn’t need a soulmate to marry or to have a romantic relationship with. Maybe he was only getting friendship. But what would happen when Harry finally met his soulmate, the lullaby singer? Would he forget about Draco? Would their friendship change?
“Shut up,” he said. “What do I do now? I can’t keep living here after this! He’s Potter, for Merlin’s sake!”
He tried to put all thoughts related to Michael away and focus on the food. He hadn’t bought anything, so he hoped James wouldn’t mind too much that he used his food to make himself a sandwich. He left a note apologising and promising to buy everything soon.
Pansy turned around too, and contemplated the distant buildings, cars, and people with him. It all seemed to belong to another world, far away from the pain and the grieving.
Harry: Your friend sent me a howler at 8am telling me about her date with Ginny. I don’t know how it went, though, because I was too busy trying to make the howler shut up. I’m going to pay for this. I know it.
Harry: You’d know what to say now. Please. Send me a sign or something. Don’t you have anything written somewhere about this? We’ve talked about it, but never like this. I’m an idiot. I shouldn’t have waited this much. How am I going to understand myself if you’re not beside me to call me an idiot or to recommend the right books?
“I was in a hurry the other night when I wrote that!” Draco half shouted after him, but Harry showed him his middle finger over his shoulder and kept walking down the aisle. He smiled and went to look for his own ingredients.
“I haven’t told you everything yet,” Draco signed. “I’m having strange dreams. They’re always about the same thing, over and over, and he’s having them too. According to Granger, that means that we’re connected in some way.”
“No, everything’s fine. Just Pansy talking about Williams, a seventh year Slytherin she’s in love with now.” He approached Harry, and took one of his hands. It felt warm, and it brought him a little bit of comfort.
As soon as I arrive home, I clean my car exhaustively. Then I go to the bedroom to wait for Harry. He’ll tell me everything when he comes back, and together, we’ll make a plan for the next few days and weeks. They’re critical. People will come asking questions, but we’ll have the perfect story for them. Harry and I. That’s what husbands are for.
Harry looked at the flowers. Michael White must be the ex, or a new boyfriend of Dray’s. He shrugged and left them on the living room table with a note. Then, seeing as he was already awake, he took a shower and left for his daily meeting with Ron and Hermione.
Auror’s Notes: Mr Smithers place of employment is the café across the street from Padma Patil’s flat.
“We have never seen something like this before! The Gryffindors don’t let the Eighth Years catch the quaffle, they seem resoluted to score!” The commentator’s voice said.
He shook the hand away, and ran to the back room. Michael wouldn’t like that, but in that moment, Draco couldn’t do anything else.
“Idiot! We’re friends! Nothing else! And you look nothing like Ron!” Harry felt a bit embarrassed after saying that, but letting Draco know how perfect he was seemed very important. “You’re handsome.”
Harry: Anyway, Ron's my partner now. So what if he can't tell a lighthouse and a dick apart? We all have issues.
Harry: Game night! Pictionary again, and I’m not going to show you the awful things Ron drew for me to guess. I think Rose does it better than him, although she’s just a year old. Thank me for this, really, you don’t want to be scarred for life as I am.
I hear steps. Closer and closer. Two people. Flat shoes and high heels. They laugh. Yours lets out a silly giggle. I roll my eyes. Parvati opens the car door and slips inside. Harry curses under his breath about the tyre. He’ll need to change it, as modern muggle inventions don’t do well with magic. He goes to the car boot. I walk towards Parvati’s side of the car, crouching down so Harry can’t see me. When I’m close enough, I pull Harry’s wand out of my pocket, still wrapped in the handkerchief. I get up, point the wand at Parvati’s surprised face and say the words:
“Can’t you?” Pansy asked, wiping her laughing tears with her hand. “You like living here, and, honestly, I haven’t seen you this happy in years. What difference does it make that ‘James’ is Potter?”
Harry resisted the urge to take a step backwards, as he didn't want the man to enter his flat. He stayed in his place, blocking the door.
Pansy and Draco sniggered. Radwah joined them moments after, and the four of them spent a nice time talking about Pansy’s problems buying from a fashion magazine, criticising Martin, and joking about Greg’s coworkers.
After a week of his melancholic state, his friends stopped trying to cheer him up, although he could feel Harry’s worried eyes on him at all times.
“Good,” Draco says, trying to ignore the hopefulness that is making itself comfortable in her chest. “Are you sure this drink isn’t poison or that you aren’t dying? You don't sound like my father.”
He sat on the cold floor outside the Potions classroom, and put out the essay he had to turn in that day about poisons. He was sure he had made a mistake somewhere and the wording seemed weird in the last paragraph, but he couldn’t focus enough to know what was wrong with it.
“Merlin! Not you too! You pay for the whole flat, not just the bed!” Harry exclaimed. It really bothered him that people thought he was a weirdo for his flat-sharing idea.
They ordered their food and had a bit of a discussion when Draco insisted he was paying for their food and Harry refused. Draco won. Then walked down the coast path until they found an entrance to the beach. They sat on the rocks near the sea and began to eat.
And with that they began. It took them hours until Draco screamed he had one of the ingredients and wrote it down on a bit of parchment. From then it seemed easier, or at least Harry thought that Draco found more and more ingredients. He didn’t understand why Draco had asked to meet as he wasn’t doing anything helpful. His work consisted in giving Draco the books he needed, refilling his glass with water or juice, and making dinner. He felt like some kind of servant, but watching Draco engrossed in a book and observing how his eyes lit up when he read something interesting made up for it. When, yawning, Draco called it a night, he had ten different options for what the improved Wolfsbane could be.
The day of the final match, the Inter-house team was gathered in the locker room listening to Weasley’s speech.
Harry’s mouth took the tip of his cock, and then little by little he took more. It felt incredibly delightful. Harry’s tongue played around his cock, and Draco thought he would come then and there. He moaned. Harry took a bit more and began moving. In no time, Draco felt really close to his orgasm.
“In the NEWTs exam you’ll have to demonstrate you know how to cast a patronus,” said professor Arias the next Tuesday during their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. “They’ll ask for it just in the written part, but it’s better if you already know how casting one feels. I know that many of you have already learned how to cast it, and have even used it in trying circumstances. So… Miss Abbott, how do we cast a patronus charm?”
“We don’t sleep there at the same time!” Harry said for the hundredth time. “It’s good too. We have our side, and don’t touch each other’s things. Besides, he’s pretty funny and cute.”
I run inside and look frantically around. He has to be here still. His portkey time hasn’t passed yet. I look in the bars, in the lines before the check in desks, I even go to the toilets, but I can’t find him anywhere. I’m about to give up and go home, when I see a jacket just like Harry’s. The man is wearing jeans just like Harry’s too, but he can’t be Harry, because this man is holding hands with a beautiful Indian woman who laughs and kisses him, leaving a red mark of lipstick on his cheek. Parvati.
“Harry? Are you listening to what I’m saying?” Hermione asked with her eyebrows furrowed. It wasn’t a good idea to zone out while she talked.
I only have to wait a few minutes until he appears. He’s driving his car, and I see he isn’t alone. For a moment, I think Parvati is with him, and I frown, confused, but then the two of them get out of the car and I see who it is. A man; tall, with a bushy mustache. The waiter from the cafeteria in front of Padma’s flat. The one who served me the coffee and laughed when he saw I was wearing the gloves.
The team reassured him, and left to the pitch. The roars of the hundreds of students watching the match welcomed them. Draco didn’t feel as excited as other times, but the familiar space and knowing that soon enough he will be flying cheered him up a little. Madam Hooch made the Weasleys shake hands as the two captains, and then they were in the air.
Harry: In other news, Ginny and Pansy played on the same team and they were disgustingly romantic. I thought they were going to fuck on our sofa, but a glare put them on their place. They owe me, after all.
“So he’s Potter again?” Pansy smirked at him. Draco glared. “Why don’t you ask him if it’s a date date or just a friend’s outing?”
He was the last person Draco wanted to see in that moment. Part of him wanted to slap him for betraying him in his dreams  , although he knew it wasn’t fair. It wasn’t Harry’s fault.
As the expression says “fake it ‘til you make it”, and that’s exactly what Harry and I do for five months. We talk to our friends and family as always, we attend dinners and galas, we comfort Parvati and her family that were devastated after so much time without Padma. By now, I sometimes forget what really happened.
Sarah sat on the bed and turned so he could look at her back and her left shoulder, where a scar had ripped the skin and turned it into a mess the Healers had barely healed before the girl lost too much blood.
The next morning, Draco felt like he did the day after he overheard Harry saying he had dreamt with his soulmate’s voice for the first time. The hopes and happiness that had calmed his troubled mind in some moments had been wiped by his friends’s words. They were right, and now Draco didn’t have any doubt about it. As Pansy had told him, he should forget about Harry. However, it was really difficult to forget about him.
The students got up all at once making a lot of noise, and then, little by little, the excited voices quiet down as they began to think. Draco knew that many of his classmates had learned with Harry to cast the patronus charm years ago, and he also knew that he’d be rubbish at it. It was the kind of magic that worked better when you screamed it. He had seen that lot of times before. So it was the kind of magic that he had troubles casting. With a sigh and a sympathetic glance from Pansy, he tried to think of his happiest memory.
“I already have a green scarf,” Harry reminded him. “And the Sorting Hat said I would have been a great Slytherin.”
Harry had to agree with her. Many of his coworkers at St Mungo’s were pretty stupid. The problem was not only that the other Healers were bigoted idiots, but that people in the Ministry had been working lately to create laws against werewolves. He sighed inwardly.
Draco sighs to herself, now actually disappointed at her father. It has been ten years since she came out to him as a trans woman, but he’s still treating her as a man. Harry looks at her, and she notices that he's angry on her behalf, so she smiles a little to reassure him that she’s fine. However, she can see he isn’t convinced. He turns to Lucius and opens his mouth to speak, but someone beats him to it.
“Of course. But… Draco, is there any problem with your soulmate? Is that why you’ve been so sad these days?” Harry asked, concern in his voice.
The thought had been bothering him since the week before, when he saw a butterfly and couldn’t remember if Draco loved them or hated them.
Draco had arrived home after a long day at work, and the last thing he needed was a bouquet sent by Michael. He looked at the note attached to the flowers. Michael said he loved him and wanted him to go back home. Draco cast a drying spell at the flowers and then vanished everything to the bin. Home was no longer Michael’s big flat. Home was his small shared flat with James.
“Well? What is it?” his father asked, waving his wand to fill two glasses with firewhisky and handing one to Draco.
“Because now I know who he is!” Draco glared at his friend. “I can’t forget that I’m sharing a flat with Harry fucking Potter.”
The polyjuice potion begins to fade as I walk down the streets of the unknown city where I apparated. I feel calm. I know I did what I had to do. My marriage with Harry is finally broken. I don’t know at what point we broke the beautiful thing we had, but we can’t go back to it. I don’t mind. Now, we’ll play again, and we’ll try to get out of this as best as we can. I know that I’ll probably be charged with Padma’s murder, and Harry will be charged for Parvati’s. Who cares who killed whom? The thing is, none are innocent. Harry, Padma, Parvati, myself; we are all culprits of something, it doesn’t matter what. I wouldn’t have killed Padma. And never Harry.
“Okay! Calm down! The happy memory you choose is the quid point. The first time I tried, I went for the first time I flew in a broomstick, but although it was happy, it wasn’t enough. What usually works for me is thinking about Ron, and Hermione, and…” Harry blushed and stopped talking.
His father just snorted, the traitor. What has his life become when he couldn’t even trust his family?
Harry: Since when does Pansy like Ginny? Are they dating? And how the fuck would I know that, if I haven't had sex in my life except for The Time We Are Not Talking About?
Harry: How was your day? Did you help a lost soul find the path to the other side or something? I feel pity for that lost soul.
Harry stared at him. Had he heard right? He was Draco’s Hogwarts crush? He opened his mouth to say something else, although he didn’t have any idea of what, when a voice in the living room interrupted his intentions.
They were the only people in the cemetery now. Everybody else had gone home long ago, although some, like their friends, had been there for almost as long as them.
“Draco. What’s wrong? Did I hurt you?” Harry’s voice was full of concern, and Draco, once more, couldn’t understand why.
Witness’s account: It was some months ago, but I remember well because he was very weird. He looked like some rich wizard, you know? Expensive robes and everything. Very pale and with white-blonde hair. He was wearing those gloves muggles use to do the dishes. At first, I thought he was one of those pureblood wizards who don’t understand muggle clothing, but when I pointed them out to him, he took them off quickly and said he had forgotten he was wearing them. Who forgets something like that?
He remembered Draco staying there until late at night, working on intricate runes and spells Harry didn’t understand. He used to come in then, with the excuse of a cup of tea, to check that his idiot husband didn’t work himself to death. They talked then, talked and talked for hours: about all the silly things that crossed their minds, and about other more serious topics.
He gave the piece of paper to Harry, and observed how Harry read the words moving the lips. Harry’s face seemed to light up with every word.
On Saturday, he woke up early and took a quick shower. Then, wearing just pants, he stared at his open wardrobe for something to wear. He wished that writing a note to Harry was an option in that moment, as his words always calmed him or made him laugh. At last, he chose something comfortable, as they would be going back and forth all day.
“I booked a table at that Italian restaurant they opened in Kensington.” Harry hoped it had been a good idea.
“I hope so. I want to go back home.” She sighed. “Merlin’s beard! I almost forgot! I have something for your boy.”
Then, I leave the alley through the Leaky Cauldron, as I need a muggle for the next step. I wander the streets of London until I find a man with a build similar to mine but with different hair and skin tone. This one has red hair and freckled skin. Perfect. A simple accio aimed at his head procures me some hairs. I go to a nearby alley to put the hairs in the polyjuice potion and take a sip of it. It tastes as awful as expected.
“It’s an old building,” the caretaker answered, taking out the key and opening the door. “They were bigger flats, but they did a renovation to make a bunch of one-rooms flats. Come inside.”
“I threw it into the lake. I picked a boat, rowed out into the middle and dropped the body there. I doubt anyone will find it,” he says in a whisper.
“Dee. I want to talk to you,” he said, standing just in front of Draco, serious. Draco swallowed. He didn't need this right now.
He tried, but it didn’t seem like something necessary now that there wasn’t going to be anyone waiting for him at the breakfast table. He rolled over and looked at the sheets and blankets in confusion. Something was wrong with them.
“Oh, Merlin! I’m so sorry, Harry. But listen to me, it’s alright. We were at home that night, okay? You and me. Watching one of your muggle movies.”
“You’ll tell us if he’s a weirdo, won’t you?” Ron said, getting up too and straightening his Auror robes.
He went straight to the girl’s room, where he found her with her worried parents. She looked too pale, and she kept grimacing in pain.
“It looks too red. I’ll put that salve you love so much on it so the itching stops.” He waved his wand, and a little bottle came flying from a cabinet.
“I’m offended that you don’t trust me for that, you know,” Draco said, walking towards the front door.
Draco nodded. He was a lot like his father, in looks and personality, so he hoped this was another thing they had in common, and that talking was all he needed to put his insecurities away.
Draco laughed. Harry pulled apart, and Draco, still laughing and still feeling the warmth of Harry’s body, tried again. And this time, although the patronus wasn’t corporeal, it was close enough.
“Sorry.” Harry smiled. “I’m going to visit others now, but I’ll come to help you at moonrise, alright?”
“Maybe,” he signed just to appease her. He had missed their conversations the past week, when he had been too preoccupied with Harry’s revelation to pay any positive attention to his friends. He took a sip of tea, and thought that he wouldn’t bother Pansy again with his soulmate problems. “Did you finish the DADA homework last night?”
He leaned back and let his hand work on Harry’s cock, finding a rhythm comfortable for both of them. His own cock was hard, but he ignored it a bit more. Finally, Harry came with a great moan, and Draco kissed him again.
“It’ll be fine! We won’t even see each other! I’m planning on spending all my weekends at your house as always,” Harry said.
“No. The hospital refuses to buy the potion other hospitals are using because they say it’s too expensive, and that someone here can come up with the right ingredients any moment now. However, we need money for it, and I think I’m the only one that worries about it,” Harry said.
Draco cursed under his breath and guided her to their bedroom. It was weird thinking about Harry Potter sleeping in the same bed as him. It was easier when he thought of him as James.
“I don’t know,” he signed slowly. “It’s always different for me, but…” His fingers stumbled over the signs a bit. He wasn’t sure how much to tell Harry.
“What!?” Draco looked at him with wide eyes. “And why am I only learning about this now? Merlin! Imagine if you had gone to Slytherin! I think I’d have killed you in your sleep with a pillow or something.”
In the following weeks, Draco tried to be his old self.  He ignored all the dreams he was having in which Harry whispered different versions of what he had said that first night in the Astronomy Tower. However,  Draco kept going to the library to look for something that explained them, but he hadn’t found anything yet. Meanwhile, Harry hadn’t mentioned to him anything else about the beautiful voice that visited him in dreams, but Draco had overheard him talking to Weasley and Granger about it.
“Idiot.” Draco took a sip of his butterbeer and glanced at him. “Are you feeling as awkward as I do, or are you more comfortable?”
“I don’t know how he did it, that idiot,” Pansy muttered next to him with her eyebrows knitted. She, like Draco, hadn’t been able to cast anything, not even the mist Daphne and Theo had done.
“Okay, we’ll need five couldrons. I don’t think I can brew ten potions at the same time, but five is more manageable.” He waved his wand and five cauldrons appeared over the five potion stations placed in the different tables. “The potions we'll be brewing today are these ones." He showed Harry the instructions he had written the night before. "Help me put the ingredients beside each cauldron, please.”
“Sure, and, please, feel free to enter this time. There’s no need for you to wait on the landing until I save you.” Draco smirked, and Harry cursed to himself. “Do you want to...er… sleep here tonight? By the way, where do you spend your weekends?”
“You haven’t asked him out yet?” She looked intently at him. “Harry, you have to ask him! How are you going to be happy if you don’t?”
“So gentlemanly of me!” Harry laughed. He glanced at the clock on the wall and cursed under his breath. “We should go, it’s getting late. I’m Apparating us!”
The little shop looked eerie without Draco’s coworkers there, but he wasn’t going to complain about not having to listen to Martin. He went to the back room, and heard Harry following him.
“I was trying to do the patronus charm, but…” His fingers wavered, but he saw that Harry understood.
Harry tried to close the door, but the other man took another step, standing now just in the entrance.
“It’s the worst thing I have ever heard.” She took a sip from her teacup and looked at her watch. “I have to go to work in ten minutes, enough time to make you see reason.”
“Of course not!” Pansy exclaimed. His friends had never liked Michael. “But this… Are you sure? You’re going to share the bed with a stranger!”
His hand touched it, and Harry let out a soft moan. Draco wriggled, pushing Harry to the bed and making himself comfortable on top so he could touch him better. His fingers wrapped around his balls, carefully, and then he kissed the tip of his cock, making Harry moan again. Precome wetted Draco’s lips.
The next day, he left early for work as he had to Apparate from London to a small village near the border with Scotland. When he finally arrived at the small potions shop, he was freezing and soaked due to the heavy rain that was falling.
Scorpius wriggled a bit, so Harry let him go off his embrace. The boy put his head on Harry’s shoulder, and Harry hugged him with his arm, not wanting to be separated from the only person that kept him sane.
“I’m sorry. I think— well, I know I wasn’t trying hard enough but after what Scorpius and Lily said today I think I’ll do better. I know this is very stupid of me but I haven’t realised they hadn’t met you before, and— I’ll do better. I promise, Draco.”
He looked at Scorpius. The boy had tears on his face too, and looked at the name on the tombstone as if he were trying to learn it by heart. Harry hugged him with one arm. It wasn’t fair.
“Isn’t there anything you can do to help her?” her mother asked. Her eyes were red, and her face looked tired and old, even if she was only a few years older than Harry.
Harry: You’d love the first chapter because it was just porn between, yes, Alex and Sylvia! Finally, right? I almost jumped when I read who they were having sex with! They’re officially together now! They both had to go to Prague to investigate a murder, and of course our old friend Lord Vicious was there too (I’ve always found the name funny… Lord V..? Rings a bell, right?). So it was fights, sarcasm, and a lot of detective work! Of course, I knew who the murderer was, you idiot! I’m a great Auror. And no, it wasn’t Lord Vicious, it was… drum roll...MANDY! Yes, I was surprised too!
The only interesting thing that happened that week besides his nervousness was that he began his sessions with a Mind Healer. They were going better than he had expected, although more often than not he ended up crying.
“The Gryffindors have a good team, no doubts there, but our team as a whole is way better. They had really good Chasers, but that’s nothing compared to you three,” he said, looking at Daphne, Dean, and Draco. Inwardly, Draco thanked him for including him in spite of how badly he had been playing lately. “Our Seeker is the best one in centuries, and our Beaters are as fierce as mountain trolls!” Draco didn’t think that comparing Pansy to a mountain troll was going to leave Weasley without consequences, but apparently the nerves for the match made Pansy forgive him. “We only has to be careful with—”
Draco felt  all the warmth that he had been feeling leave him. He hadn’t forgotten about his problems, and often wondered about who the sexy lullaby singer could be. He thought it could be Ginny Weasley, and that was one of the reasons why he wanted to defeat Gryffindor so badly in the upcoming match. However, the little moments he had spent with Harry lately had almost made him feel like they were soulmates.
“Morning, Harry!” Ron said from the door. He and Hermione had just arrived for their morning breakfast-dinner. “I bring croissants and Chinese food for you. It’s from last night, but I think it’s still good.”
But this is too horrible to think about, and I know that Harry loves me. It’s Yours who confused his mind, who made him think he loves her. I know better. That’s why the fourth possibility is the correct one:
He was sure that the connection Granger had found wasn’t a coincidence, but maybe those hopes were fed by the words Harry had said.
“Scorpius will go back to Hogwarts next week.” He focused on the hem of his sweater. Well, it wasn’t his. He didn't have sweaters that were this soft or this expensive, but it smelled good. It smelled like
“I think you should,” Pansy quickly said, wrapping his hand in hers. “I don’t know what he did to you, but what he did the other night wasn’t right, and I know you weren’t happy when you were together.”
He closed his eyes, and thought of when he was little, maybe six or seven years old, and his father bought him his first broom. He smiled. He opened his eyes, with the wand ready, and then dropped it when the door opened and a smiling Harry entered.
“You should thank me, Malfoy,” Martin said with his usual spite. “I haven’t told Mr. Smith about you always being late, nor about the constant visits of your boyfriend.”
“Come on, Dee! You don’t know how to live on your own. It’s a wonder you’ve managed to be on time to work these days and, honey, who’s cooking for you? You don’t even know what a kitchen is!” Michael laughed again with that soft laugher of his that Draco loved so much.
“You know what? I’m not going to reply. I’m going to just sit here and let you make your own, wrong conclusions, and then I’ll laugh at you.” He crossed his arms and pouted.
“It’s not awful! And if you don’t like it, I’ll find someone else with whom I have a child and name her that. But not, I thought of a name you could actually like.”
Harry: Also when I say I drink with Blaise and Goyle I don't drink enough to get drunk (and neither do they!).
“I didn’t know you knew how to dance. I was there during the Yule Ball, you know?” he signed, smirking.
“What are you doing here?” Greg asked, standing up. He was bigger than Michael, but he ignored him too, as he had done with Pansy.
! I’m so excited! There’s a lot of people outside the bookshop waiting for it. I hope they have enough books because I need mine!
Harry rolled his eyes at him, but picked his foot up again and kept massaging it. Draco’s feet were so swollen it hurt just looking at them.
Harry let out a relieved sigh and smiled. He didn’t bother to wipe the happy tears that escaped his eyes.
“He’s still Dray!” Harry said, emphasising his words with a hand movement that sent his dish flying to the floor. “Fuck!”
“I’m trying to be a better person and you accuse me of being sick?” Lucius asks, raising an eyebrow in that special way only he and Draco can manage and that irks Narcisa and Harry to no end.
“Did you close the door?” Harry asked, his face very close to Draco’s. His lips were almost touching Draco’s cheek. So close that he wondered if it was even necessary to close the door anymore. How would they explain their situation if someone entered right now?
“I’m sure too,” Harry said, taking it off and folding it carefully. He looked at the scarf and thought about the woman’s words. He felt how his smile faltered.
Draco turned in bed, angry at the injustice of his life. He could fall in love with another person and so could Harry  fall in love for him, but  both would know that that person wasn’t the one meant for them, something will be lacking in their lives, like a soul that wouldn’t be complete.
“I think I’ll accept the dance invitation,” he signed, as he got up. Then he grabbed Harry’s hand and dragged him to the middle of the common room.
“I signed it as ‘James’ so I don’t attract some Harry Potter crazy fans,” Harry told them. “Besides, I already have a roommate.”
Harry shrugged, and went back to sitting on the grass. Draco thought that that was a moment as good as any to ask what had been on his mind for the last weeks. After all, it was in moments like that one when he wondered over and over what the hell was Harry doing with someone like him when Harry could have anyone else.
It’s important to keep up appearances. Harry is nervous all the time, he refused to go to the Burrow yesterday, and has stopped going running. I had to force him to go today. People have to see us as always. We’re the same as everything; we’re not two killers, but Harry and Draco Potter-Malfoy.
“I’m just on time, arsehole,” he answered and went straight to the back room, where Radwah was already attending some potions. “Morning.”
The doorbell rang again for a few seconds. Annoyed, Harry opened the door and found a man he hadn’t met before.
Harry didn’t know what to do. This was something private between Draco and his ex, but at the same time, he was too scared to leave Draco alone with him. So he just stood there, next to Draco, and grabbed the door to slam it at the first chance.
“Sorry, I thought you were ready.” Draco looked at him. He certainly didn’t look well. “Er… Do you need anything?”
“Draco isn’t coming right now. And you better go before I call the Aurors,” Harry said, standing before Michael and noticing that the other man was bigger and stronger than him. He wished he had brought his wand. He felt vulnerable just wearing his pyjamas.
“He’s just stressed,” Harry laughed, as he picked up a T-shirt. Draco looked avidly at his naked torso before the shirt hid it. “Wood was worse. He followed me around to tell me his ideas.”
Draco smiled at him too. Harry was wearing jeans and a worn out t-shirt with the name of a Muggle band on it. His eyes shone behind his glasses, which had some finger marks on. And of course, his hair was a bird’s nest. Draco didn’t know why he found that so attractive about him.
And he was nervous. He went inside the café looking around like someone was after him. He sat near the window and kept looking outside, at the building across the street, I think. I saw him leaving the building before he came to our café, but I hadn’t seen him before. He was really nervous the whole time he was in the café; I thought he was going to pour the coffee all over himself. He didn’t drink much, anyway. He smiled to himself from time to time. I thought he was insane or something, you know? After a while he got up and left, leaving a generous tip. That’s all I remember.
“Welcome, sirs, ma’ams,” the house-elf says when she finally opens the door. “Mr and Mrs Malfoy are in the gallery.”
“Sorry! I fell asleep, I didn’t hear you!” Draco said. Harry’s heart did a weird jump at hearing his voice. It had been so long since the last time he had heard that drawled voice.
Harry: I called Blaise and Goyle. I need hugs. I could have just called Goyle, but it felt wrong to leave Blaise out.
“Kind of cute? Draco!” She let out a suffering sigh, her way of telling Draco that he needed to tell her absolutely everything.
“And that redhead? You’re dropping me for that redhead?” Michael’s eyes flashed with barely contained fury. “Don’t you have any respect left for yourself?”
The last Saturday of April, they had their quidditch match against Hufflepuff. Thankfully, Ron didn’t have to look for another chaser as Draco hadn’t thrown any other quaffles into his teammates' heads. They won for just ten points when Harry caught the snitch under the Hufflepuff seeker's  nose. The eighth years threw a party to celebrate their victory.
He took a few minutes to relax and to think of what he’d say if Draco hadn't left for work. He had imagined many times how it would be if they met sometime, but this hadn’t been a situation he had thought of before.
“I have something to tell you. I finally heard my soulmate’s voice!” Harry’s smile was bigger, and his eyes were shining in excitement.
The five Slytherins that  had returned to Hogwarts for their Eighth Year were sharing a table in the common room, and doing their homework,  books and parchment were scattered all over the place. On the purple sofas near the fireplace, the Gryffindors were playing chess, and talking quietly. Draco looked at them from time to time and wondered if Harry had dreamt again with the beautiful voice.
He closed his eyes, and soon enough his mind filled with the bright and confusing images of a dream. He was flying, and Weasley kept signing at him that he was a Hufflepuff, but Draco flew faster and faster, until he left the other boy behind. He was standing in the Astronomy Tower with Harry. Draco smiled and approached him, but Harry jumped off the tower while screaming that they couldn’t be together because he was in love with a veela.
of all people! They look like they’re arguing, but they’re too far away for me to hear what they’re saying. They stand on the edge of a bluff, overlooking the lake.
“I have no idea, Draco.” Harry’s expression was sadder now, and Draco felt the urge to hug him, so he would be happy and excited again. However, he refrained. “I wish it— I supposed I’ll find out someday, right? We all can’t find ours here at Hogwarts. You haven’t told me who’s yours either.”
Draco smiled and gave him a proper kiss on the mouth, happy that their relationship would be a secret no longer.
I change into my best shirt and trousers that I haven’t worn so long. Then, I take Harry’s wand from the bedside table with my hand wrapped in a handkerchief. It wouldn’t do for me to leave any fingerprints there. I need Harry’s.
Harry: You know I've always wanted to know more about my Indian heritage so I decided that this was the moment to do it. Whatevers makes me happy, remember?
Harry: Of course you know. I bet you're smirking now and raising an eyebrow at me. Well, I didn't know it but I'm ready now!
Padma approaches him, and he pushes her away with a little too much force. She tumbles over the edge, falls, and breaks her neck with a sharp snap on the rocky shore. Harry climbs down and shakes her, but even I know she’s already dead.
“Potter doesn’t think that.” Pansy waved the note she was still holding. “Draco, we’re past our school years, we’re mature now. This isn’t going to devolve into a magic duel in the living room if you ever run into Potter now.”
Sarah’s parents looked at each other and at their daughter, doubt all over their expressions. Harry  retired a bit to give them privacy while they decided, but inwardly he hoped they accepted.
The next day Pansy had to beg Draco to have breakfast while the rest of their friends look in surprise, as Draco usually had a very good appetite.
They laughed, and then Thomas left, saying goodbye with a hand gesture. Harry looked around, making sure they were alone, Draco guessed, and asked:
My nails are shorter than ever as I haven’t stopped biting on them, and I have bags under my eyes from lack of sleep. Padma and Harry and Parvati are all I think about all day. Harry’s DNA on Padma’s body; Harry and Parvati shagging in the sun in Spain; signed Yours with red lipstick; Padma’s swollen corpse; Harry coming back because he loves me; Harry not coming back because he doesn’t love me; Parvati smirking at me…
Harry: Ron says if I keep on like this, I’m going to develop an obsession with her as I did with you in 6th year.
“He is! I did the laundry the other day and cleaned his clothes too, and the next day when I arrived from work, I found a note on the kitchen table thanking me and accompanied by a chocolate frog.” He smiled at the memory. He had had a not-so-nice night, as he had been thinking about Michael and about how he didn’t miss him that much anymore. It had been strange, as Michael used to be the centre of his life. But lately, he had felt happier, lighter, like the anxiety that had so often plagued him when he lived with his boyfriend was finally leaving.
“He’s shagging you now? First the redhead, and now this one. Draco?” the man screamed, looking at the interior of the flat, and Harry realised that this must be Michael. “Come here! We need to talk!”
“You little shit,” Draco smirked. “There’s still hope for you, we can make a Slytherin out of you yet.”
“At Venezia’s? We’re going to have dinner at Venezia’s? Did you tell them you’re the famous Harry Potter to get a table? It’s fucking hard to get one there!” Draco looked very excited, and Harry had a sudden urge to kiss him, although he refrained.
“I’m sorry, Draco,” he says when he comes back. “Ron called me, and I have to go back to the shop. I won’t be late.”
role and I know how to play it. I don’t know if I should tell him that I know everything, that I’ve taken care of everything. I think I should, because otherwise, how will I be sure that he disposed of Padma's body?
“I think it’s some kind of steak with sauce,” Draco said, reading the menu with his brow furrowed. “Mmmm, I think I’ll have a risotto.”
“I don’t have ten inches of information about protective charms!” Pansy hissed back. “He’ll have to be happy with this. Unless…!” She looked brightly at Draco and Blaise that were working on the other side of the table.
“Wait, but you aren’t his soulmate,” Theo said, then looked at Pince, and decided to sign instead of talking. “Him wanting you to be doesn’t fix anything, right?”
“We’re in a library!” Madam Pince hissed near them. They haven’t seen her leave her desk. “Out if you don’t know how to behave!”
“It’s a bad idea,” Hermione said, getting up too and vanishing the teacups to the sink. “I’m going to work now.” She pecked Ron on the lips, hugged Harry, and left.
“Harry, they found Padma’s body yesterday. They know she was murdered. But, listen, I have everything figured out. You don’t love Parvati, right?”
“Nothing, absolutely nothing. Harry’s just an idiot.” He paused. “No, wait. Do you like it? I don’t think I like it anymore.”
“Leave me alone,” Draco said at the same time that he grabbed the door and slammed it in Michael’s face, who screamed again.
Harry smiled again, and opened the present with the energy of a 5 year old on Christmas Day. It was a little box of the best chocolate they sold in Honeydukes. Harry took one and offered another to Draco.
Harry: Don’t be jealous. I don’t like Pansy, and this time it's true, not like when I said I didn’t like you in 6th year.
“Ugh! I can’t stand him! One day, Draco, I swear I’m going to curse him so hard he won’t be able to talk for a month!”
Harry: I want kids. Or wanted. I'm not sure I can have them now because how am I going to, without you?
“And speaking of home, how are things with Dray?” Hermione said, and Harry guessed it was her attempt of cheering him up a little, as talking about the potion always made him sad.
The car’s turn signal blinks. I look over and see a hotel. Expensive. Like the ones we used to go to. The car goes to the underground parking lot. I drive past it and go around the block. Once. Twice. Thrice. I don’t see them leaving.
It was past midnight when they left the shop. The potions needed a few days or weeks to be finished, but Draco would do that during the next weeks when he had time at work.
Harry: We had game night at theirs tonight, and they announced it! I asked them to be the godfather but they said I already have Teddy and Rose, and that the new baby is for Ginny. She was very insufferable after that, the prat.
And neither had Harry. If he wanted to get angry at Dray for not telling him the truth, so could Dray about him. As he had written in the note, technically he hadn’t lied. Technically, James was part of Harry's name too, even if no one knew in his life called him that.
He opened the door with more force than necessary and stared at the little postman, who tried to look over the big bouquet he was carrying.
“Flowers?” Ron asked with his eyebrows raised, as if he had never heard about something so strange as flowers.
“No, you’re not.” Harry sat on the bed too. “I bet he wasn’t like that at the beginning, and then you were too in love to realise.”
“I’d go nuts looking for something!” she said as she cleaned the table and readied it for the next brewing.
Harry: Ron says I’m a sentimental idiot because I’m still worried about the woman and her husband (I firecalled St Mungo’s and they told me the man is fine).
“I think you should relax, and start thinking about other things.” He furrowed his brow in indignation, and was ready to start ranting at Pansy, but then she interrupted him. “I mean! I know it’s awful, Draco, I know it is, but you can’t be thinking about it all the time! You’re driving me crazy, and you too! Maybe it was just a normal dream.”
Harry flushes the toilet, and positions himself behind her, his hands wrapped around her waist, so they both are reflected by the mirror.
“Exactly!” Greg said. “You’ve been living here for two months now and haven’t seen the man once. Why would that change now?”
Harry: I wanted to try the food my father and grandparents ate, and, well, I’m in love now. It was delicious! I have to learn how to cook it all! I wish we had gone together, or that you were here to try it out with me and to discover all these things about myself with me.
“Come here, you,” he said, kissing Harry all over his face while his hands worked on the buttons of his shirt. When he finished, he began to kiss Harry’s chest, his scar, the birthmark that looked like a flower, the nipples, the navel. “Fuck, Harry, put this shirt on the floor, I want to see you!”
“That man is…” Greg left the sentence unfinished and made his knuckles crack. He looked at the floor and his brow furrowed. “What’s this?” He had picked a note from the floor. “It says: ‘Sorry I didn’t do the dishes this morning, I’ll clean everything when I’m back from work. James’.”
“Is the Chosen One feeling pity for a Death Eater?” he asked, raising an eyebrow. “I must be a very bad influence on you.”
“And according to the idiot named after an oversized lizard, Lyra is a musical instrument not a person’s name.”
Harry: I'm taking the children to the vet tomorrow. Leo needs vaccines (that's a muggle thing I'm not explaining right now because my lunch break is ending, and I still have to eat my dessert: chocolate pudding).
“It’s alright. And I get that. Pansy and Greg are the same. Good night then, Potter.” Draco smirked.
It’s not that I don’t trust Harry, because I do, I love him, but I don’t think he can do this on his own. I know some part of him is still hesitant about incriminating Parvati. He doesn’t love her, but his heart is too noble to do something like that. That’s why I’m Apparating outside the Auror’s office, to see if he actually goes inside or if he chickens out.
“She was angry at me after what happened at the Ministry because of what that meant to you, and she let me know as soon as I was out of Azkaban.” He took a sip of his firewhisky, and Draco looked at him, eager. “After the war, she was still angry. And I was, too, of course. I haven’t forgiven myself for all that happened to you then. But she doesn’t hate me.”
“You what?” Draco exclaims. She hasn’t heard that story before. “And you tell us to behave! That’s ruthless, Mother.”
“I do. Now make yourself comfortable. We’ll be outside,” Harry said, and left to the corridor bench, where Sarah's parents joined him a minute after.
He’s sad; he looks so scared! I take his hand in mine, reassuring him. He has to know that I won’t leave him alone with this.
Radwah laughed, and pestered him for more details all morning. Yes, he definitely could get used to that.
Harry: Don't worry, I made sure that Cassie and Leo were fed and loved. It was only me starving or eating unhealthy amounts of buns with chocolate chips. That's my grieving food
He nodded, as if someone had whispered those words directly into his head, yet he didn't move, simply stared at the blankets in confusion.
He left the note stuck on top of Dray’s one and went to the bathroom. He had noticed small changes here and there all over his flat that showed that another person was living there now; however, nothing had prepared him for the bathroom. In the single shelf he had over the bathtub, there was now what looked like an entire apothecary of soaps, shampoos, and bottles, and Harry could only guess what they were for. He had trouble finding his small 2-in-1 gel that looked like an old man among all those other fancy bottles.
Harry: I’m going to open my presents now, and then we’ll drink hot chocolate, and have a snowball fight! (No, I’m not 6. You’re no fun at all!).
When Draco finished telling her about his living arrangements, Radwah began a two-hour story about how Draco and his secret roommate will fall in love in the most ridiculous of ways.
“Gossiping, are you?” he said, glaring at their potions. “Your boyfriend is here and wants to talk to you, Malfoy.” He turned and left for the front room.
He turned around and opened the wardrobe. Here was where things could get complicated. He couldn’t do with just half of it; he needed at least three quarters. He opened James’s side, the closest one to the window, and made space for his things. James’s taste in clothes was as lacking as his taste in decoration. He snorted when he found a Gryffindor scarf among his roommate’s things. He couldn’t resist putting his Slytherin one in a place where it was easily noticed.
And that’s important, that I know he loves me, because then I know that the note I found this morning on his pocket, the one written with red lipstick and signed “Yours” doesn’t mean anything serious. I know that whoever Yours is isn’t important to Harry. Everyone has affairs. It’s just another part of marriage. Mother had one, and Father had at least two. But they had been together all these years anyway. Harry loves me, and this thing with Yours is just a little distraction, a little thing he has for himself, like I have my Tuesdays with Pansy and Greg and my yoga classes.
“The one that smells like lavender?” Sarah exclaimed. “Ugh! I hate that cream! You should give me one that isn’t that one, as I’m your favourite patient.”
Harry couldn’t believe that Draco and his friend had done the potion so quickly. Patients like Sarah had endured a lot of pain just because the Ministry refused to pay a few Galleons. He hoped that the people in charge compensated Draco and Radwah as they deserved.
The brilliant morning sun bathed the Hospital Wing making it nicer than any other time Draco had visited it. He blinked when he entered as it was sunnier than the corridor he just left, and then smiled at Harry, who was sitting in his bed with a thick bandage around his head.
“How are you feeling today?” he asked softly. He hated this part of his work, seeing his patients in pain and being unable to help them. He had thought that becoming a Healer would keep his saviour heart happy, but he hadn’t realised that he wouldn’t be able to save everyone.
Harry: I used my most persuasive voice, and charming personality (because I have that, don’t laugh, you git), and painted Pansy in a very good light. Ginny fell for her, I could see it.
Harry: Work is gaining its appeal again! Except when I have to do paperwork, then I want to throw myself off the Astronomy Tower at Hogwarts.
“And that’s supposed to make it better? You’re going to share your house, and your bed, with a total stranger and plan to keep it like that?” Ron shook his head in bewilderment, and said goodbye with a hand gesture before Disapparating.
“I’ll go to see who it is,” Harry said, getting up and leaving the room hurriedly. He saw how Draco looked at him and realised what had happened last night, but he didn’t want to talk to him when his cock had other ideas.
The drawling voice came from behind. He turned and there he was, as perfect as he had pictured him in his mind. He was wearing a white shirt and jeans. The Muggle attire looked very good on him. His hair was less messy than the last time Harry had seen him, but it looked like Draco had messed it on purpose, in a way Harry couldn’t imitate with his own hair. He was also carrying two bags, so Harry hurried to take one.
“But lately I’ve always dreamt the same. The words change, but he… he’s always doing the same thing. I wanted to research too. I don’t know if that’s a normal dream or something else.”
Harry has always been a mess, so it’s my job to make sure his baggage is ready for his business trips. I don’t mind. In fact, I like it, it’s my way to show him affection. I fold everything carefully and with a flick of my wand, send it to the bag open on the bed.
A pale hand appeared in the shower holding a towel. Harry grabbed the towel, and the hand disappeared.
“Get out of my house!” Harry screamed too. He hoped one of his Muggle neighbours would call the police.
“She likes it too! She just kicked me!” Draco smiled, and received a bright smile from his husband in return.
He went to the lake, and sat in the grass. It always calmed him down, the water movements, and the occasional tentacle that reached for some distracted birds.
He spent the rest of the day reading on the sofa, which was very comfortable, and buying the groceries he’d need for the rest of the week. He only cried once for Michael.
“The bathroom and bedroom are over there, in that small corridor,” the caretaker said, pointing to the opening in the middle of the back wall.
When Draco nodded, still feeling like or either Harry wasn’t as well as he wanted him to believe or either he was missing something only Harry knew, Harry tore apart the last copy of The Daily Prophet and pushed it towards him. Draco picked a quill from Harry’s bedside table and began to write the words feeling Harry’s gaze on him.
Draco’s first instinct was to fly to Harry and tried to save him, but he knew he couldn’t make it on time. Without keeping his eyes off Harry, he picked up his wand and cast a spell to slow down his fall. But from so far, the spell didn’t work. Panicked, he tried to think of something else. There was a spell… He had only read about it, but he hoped his desperation was enough to make the spell work. He thought the words, and pointed his wand again. But again nothing happened.
“I didn’t think that.” Draco smiled. “I was just curious. So… all the rent I’ve paid is going to come to me again when — and notice I said
Draco rolled his eyes, and readied himself to defend James once more. The conversation kept going like that for a few hours, and Draco went to bed that night feeling a lot better than how he had felt that morning.
I hope you liked this last chapter as well. It was my first time writing a sex escene, and although I know I still have a lot to learn about how writinh them, I have to say I have FUN writing this one, and thas't what matters, isn't it?
They enter the study that hasn’t changed since Draco was a toddler, and Lucius serves two glasses of the liquor. Draco takes one and takes a sip.
Harry: Have I told you that I’m going to kill your friend Pansy? She came here AGAIN, with Blaise and Goyle, and I had to hear about her date AGAIN! How did I end with all these overtalktative Slytherins in my house? Ah, yes, because I married their king.
At around 10 p.m., he went back to Sarah’s room, carrying a cup with Wolfsbane in it. The girl took it, and after making sure she was fine in her bed, he and her parents left the room, locking the door just in case. The screams Sarah let out during the transformation could be heard in the whole ward, and many patients left their rooms to see what was happening. Sarah’s parents hugged each other, crying. After a while, the screams stopped, and they didn’t hear anything again until morning, when Sarah transformed back to human.
“Because apparently Cassiopeia sounds like the name of an eighty year old,” Draco said, kicking Harry again, and receiving a soft slap on one of his feet.
!” Draco said, pointing his wand to the list of ingredients he had brought. “Here, we’ll finish earlier if we split the work, and then we can go take a stroll on the beach for a while.”
“I married the wrong woman in this family,” Harry says, admiration pouring out of his voice. “You’re my hero.”
Harry: I apologised to Ron by the way. He and Hermione came with me to an animal shelter and we all fell in love with Cassie, and with… roll drum, please…
Later that night, Draco went to sleep with a big smile, and for once his dreams were about a certain green eyed boy not telling him how a horrible soulmate he’d be, but about sweet things whispered in loving ways.
I’m reading an article about autopsies on drowned people —it’s important to be informed— when I hear the main door opening. My heart beats wildly as my first thought is of the Aurors barging in, but when I get up, I see Harry coming inside.
“How do you know that? How do you know she doesn’t fake it?” Draco decided to ignore the first part of his father’s discourse, although it had touched him. It wasn’t usual for Lucius to admit he felt guilty about something.
Harry: Someday, Draco, I’m going to kill Pansy Parkinson and her love for waking people up way too early on the weekends.
Harry: I'm sorry I didn't text you yesterday, but I had training, work, park with Cassie and Leo, and then game night.
Scorpius shakes his head no shyly and hides behind Draco’s leg. She puts a comforting arm around his shoulders and he seems to relax a little.
“Yes, yes. Just… Draco. Er…” Harry blushed again, and seemed unable to look at Draco. Draco just stared in confusion. Finally, Harry looked at him again. “What spell did you use to save me?”
“Harry could fall in love with you, you know? He likes you, you two have been friends since the end of the war. That had happened before. Or you could fall in love with the person that has you as their soulmate,” Pansy said, while she kept stroking his hair. It was their dynamic by then: whoever was feeling down got their hair stroked by the other one.
“Yeah,” Draco said, laughing. Harry noticed he liked his laugh; it was a sound he wasn’t used to hearing but he could get used to it easily. “I knew you were my flatmate, but now it’s like getting hit in the head with the idea.”
“This is so weird!” he said. “I think I’m only now realising that you and I are living together. It’s different now that we’re both here, because usually, I only know you live in the flat when I see your things or read your notes.”
“And you were worried about me?” Draco let out a dry laugh. “Michael let you think you were so special, didn’t he?” he went on with cruelty. “He made you feel all important and big, sharing his secrets, and spying on me. He doesn’t care about you, Martin. He’s a manipulative bastard, and you’re a traitor for telling him those things about me.”
“You’ll have to go back, Scorp. Not now, but next week. On Monday.” He used a spell to turn the meat on the pan, and looked at the potatoes. Cooking was good. Cooking made him forget about things.
After Harry trusted me with what had happened that night, I hoped that our relationship would improve, but he kept his distance as before. I think he was too affected by all that. Not because he cared about Yours, but because he’s a soft, good man who had been forced into a horrible situation.
“Git,” Draco muttered. “Okay, what do you want for lunch? Fish and chips on the beach?” he asked when they left the shop.
It was the first time in months that Harry had laughed like that, it felt freeing, although soon enough he realised he was crying too. And he wasn’t the only one. He put an arm around Scorpius’s shoulders and guided him to the sofa. They sat very close to each other, and hugged, and cried together for what felt like hours. However, it didn’t feel like the anguished cries that had shattered him in the last months. Somehow, sharing his pain with Scorpius felt good, even.
Then we had lunch together in his and Hermione’s house, and we played chess. He won, obviously, and was pretty smug about it until he had to change Rose’s diaper and one of his fingers touched the shit. I cried with laughter and now I’m not welcome in the Granger-Weasley house until I beg for forgiveness. Or so Ron says. You and I know that he can't live without me.
“I saw people that night near the Black Lake. I think one of them was Padma. You should look in the lake.”
“I’m sorry!” Pansy said with her best contrite face, and in an exaggerated low voice. Madam Pince seemed happy enough with it, but she kept looking at them like a vulture would look at its prey.
“You’re right.” Harry smiled a little more at him, and kissed him on the cheek. “Am I forgiven for my little outburst before?”
“I don’t know. Maybe you feel forced to be with me or you’re too kind to break up with me… Don’t you feel disgusted by all the things I’ve done and…?”
“It’s a great idea! Hermione, tell him it’s a great idea!” Harry said from his place on the sofa, next to his best friend.
“Hey, everything alright with our dear supervisor?” she asked as she removed the clear liquid from the cauldron in front of her.
Draco went to work with a big smile the next day. He and Radwah had worked very hard to create the Wolfsbane Potion, and he still couldn’t believe that they had been able to do it. He was sure Harry’s patients were going to have a very easy full moon.
Draco glared at Harry, but the idiot just smiled. Luckily for him, he kept the massage, so Draco didn’t hate him that much.
Harry looks at Draco over the stupidly rich dinner he made today. He’s been like this all week and it’s starting to get on Harry’s nerves. Besides, there are all the weird things Draco has been doing lately, like going to his work from time to time, telling him that everything is alright, and talking about Padma with a nervous expression whenever her disappearance is brought up in a conversation.
Harry: Anyway. Pansy. Tomorrow I’ll meet Ginny for lunch, and then I’ll tell her about how nice, and interesting, and intelligent Pansy is… And then I’ll ask her to date her!
“I dreamt with Harry again, but it was different,” he signed slowly. “He said we couldn’t be together and jumped off the Astronomy Tower. What do you think it means?” His fingers trembled a little, and he stumbled over the signs.
Harry: I’m going to be very busy these days buying all the presents, and I’m going to stay at the Burrow so this doesn’t get too depressing. I love you!
“Is that a new sign they forgot to teach us in the BSL class in first year?” Blaise asked in a mocking tone.
It had been a shock when Draco first dreamed with his soulmate’s voice, and he discovered it was Harry Potter. He was fourteen then, and had patiently awaited for the moment that Harry dreamt with him too. Although as Draco was born mute, he wondered what Harry would hear. Nothing probably. Maybe he didn’t know he had a soulmate.
They fell silent after that, and Draco thought that there was something strange there: in the fact that he and his soulmate had recurrent dreams. Was their soulmate magic trying to tell them both something? His heart jumped in distress. Was Harry in danger? Was that why his dreams show him falling or was it because of something else? Maybe it was a way of telling him that once Harry met his soulmate, he’d drop off of Draco’s life. That thought alone was close to bring him to tears, but he refrained. He couldn’t cry in front of Harry.
Harry: I knew I shouldn’t have accepted! She looks as smug as you do when she thinks she’s right, that prat.
“I like the sea. We had a summer house near here, and I loved coming every year,” Draco told him. It felt like those times had happened a lifetime ago.
Harry looks hesitantly at me; he’s always been too good, too noble for this world. But he must understand that Yours doesn't deserve that sympathy, she’s our perfect scapegoat. After some persuasion on my part, he finally agrees to go to the Auror’s office tomorrow before work. We go to bed together, and I fall asleep with a smile on my lips.
Padma being his coworker fucks everything up even more, as Harry will be one of the first people they suspect. I inspect the entire house, all of Harry’s things: pockets, clothes, bags, desk, everything, in search of other letters or notes that Padma sent him. Nothing.
My heart beats harder. Is he finally going to tell me? I decide to play dumb. He has to tell me himself. I smile at him, encouraging him.
Draco snorts. She wanders to the windows and looks to the gardens. Harry, Lily and Scorpius are playing tag while Narcissa takes pictures.
“Hello, darlings,” her mother greets as soon as they enter. She and her husband stand up to kiss Draco and her family. “How are you?”
Martin had gone pale. He had always enjoyed being the important person, the one in charge, so Draco guessed that hearing about Michael using him hadn’t felt very good. Draco looked at him with distaste once more, and strode into the back room. He thought that Martin wouldn’t bother him again in a while.
Harry: AH! Such a nice day! Of course I missed you, and I wish we had the Christmas we had planned, but this was okay too. I didn’t feel very sad, and could enjoy this and the people around me. Although at one point, I had to drag Ron to his room to cry and be hugged.
“I’m going to call Ron,” he said instead. “The door is locked with spells, so I don’t think he can come inside.”
“I don’t know. It’s too complicated! He wrote that stupid note like all the other ones, but then he said ‘love’! Why did he say that? He has never signed with it before! Ugh!” Draco rested his head on the back of the sofa and closed his eyes.
“Yes! I told you it’s all about the memory!” Harry exclaimed, going closer to Draco and engulfing him in a hug.
“Mate, your whole situation is weird. That the lad changed the place for the forks isn’t the strangest thing there.”
Harry: Isn't she cute? Adorable? I don't think Feather is a good name for a she-duck. So I looked for constellation names and chose Cassiopeia, Cassie for short. I know you're thinking I'm mental, but you are secretly delighted about Cassie.
Harry had done what he could to calm Sarah and her parents. She wasn’t in pain, but she was still scared. Exhausted, Harry sent a message to Ron and Hermione to tell them that he was too tired for their usual breakfast-dinner. When he arrived home, he went straight to the bathroom.
“It was easy since we already knew some of the ingredients and steps we needed, and I didn’t do it alone. Radwah helped a lot, although I must say that the good potion was one of the five you and me brewed together.”
— I brew this potion?” He raised an eyebrow in what Harry thought was a very Malfoy-ish way. That gesture made him feel more comfortable. An arrogant Draco, he knew how to deal with.
Harry didn’t think it was so worrisome, but if Ron said so, he wasn’t about to not believe his friend. His protective instinct was very happy Draco was still living with him.
“Nope. That’s something Weasley and Granger would use for their child. And we’re not done discussing Chrysanthemum.”
Draco’s heart was beating so fast and loudly he thought it was a miracle that Harry and his friends didn’t hear it. Harry wished he was his soulmate? He breathed deeply a few times trying to calm himself, and then kept listening. A few minutes later he returned to his table.
“Come on! It was a Gryffindor, wasn’t it? And I’m guessing it was a boy… or do you like girls too?” Harry said, now with a knowing smirk.
“Hey,” he greeted. “No, we’re going to the beach. There’s an apothecary in Brighton that has more variety than the one in Diagon Alley. Besides, the bloke at the one in the alley is an idiot.”
Harry: The language seems like a good starting point so I downloaded an app for it, and I haven't been able to do anything else in the last few days. I wanted to tell you as soon as I began to learn, but I also wanted to tell you an actual word and not just some random sounds.
“You realise I’m not a clown you can hire to entertain your guests?” He took a sip of his wine, and looked at the city under them.
“You can’t ask things like that, Parkinson!” He walked around the table and dropped next to Radwah on the sofa. “Any ideas of how I can face this?”
“Dashing! I’m sure all the young ladies would fall for you when you wear my scarf,” she said proudly.
Draco closed the flat door and ran downstairs. He could still feel his cheeks blushing, and his dick was hard, even though it had been a really embarrassing — and delightful — encounter. Harry was more beautiful than he remembered. He had grown up a few inches and was less thin than during the war. Draco saw a scar on his chest he didn’t know he had, and a birthmark on his shoulder that looked like a flower. He had tried not to look, of course, but he couldn’t help but to glance at his cock too. A smile turned Draco’s mouth upwards. He could get used to that sight every morning.
Harry: I think they’re trying to transform me into you. I should have checked the firewhiskey, maybe there’s some shady potion in it.
“I like James. I have an enemies relationship with Potter,” he said, and let his body drop to the floor with his back against the wall.
“I don’t know if you’ve noticed, Potter, but I’m mute,” Draco signed, smirking at Harry and raising his eyebrows. Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry: I had such a nice week, Draco! We talked a lot, played with Rose, and forgot a little about all the things that are wrong in the world.
“Okay, what about this: you go out with him and act as if it were a date, as I’m sure it is, and if you see that he gets weird, you stop?” Radwah suggested. “Or you act as a friend’s thing. Whatever option you like best.”
“NO!” Bakshi screamed, horrified, but with the mess at the other side of the pitch, nobody paid attention to him.
Harry: I’m sorry, I’m sorry! I went with the Granger-Weasleys to a cottage in the south of England and forgot my phone at home. So then Hermione decided that it was a little holiday to forget about the real world, and turned her phone off too.
Harry: How do you think animals learn to swim? Is it instinct? If so then we're the most useless beings on Earth because we're the only ones who need a beefy man to shout at us and teach us how to do it.
Harry looked at Draco. He looked tiny, although he was taller than him by a few inches. He had his eyes fixed on the door and trembled everytime Michael screamed. Harry had never felt a bigger urge to hug someone before, but he didn’t dare.
Draco sat on the bed next to him because thinking about Harry getting up with the concussion he had made him anxious. Harry threw his arms around him as soon as they were close enough, and Draco did the same, relishing on the warmth of the hug and on Harry’s smell.
The October rain fell heavily on the other side of the windows, making it difficult to see the forest that surrounded the house. The three of them were sat on the living room sofas, Ron and Hermione holding their teacups, and Harry staring at the rain.
Ron Weasley saved the quaffle thrown by his sister, and Draco caught it again. He threw it to Daphne when he saw Robins coming for him, dodged her, and flew as fast as he could to the goal posts, where Daphne and Thomas were.
Harry: See? I can't live without you to tell me when I fuck up. I think I'm broken. Do you think that's possible?
“In one of your notes, you said you liked Potions because you got to see your crush there, who was he?” Draco turned to look at him, feeling his cheeks blushing, and saw that the git was smiling kindly.
“Can I ask you something?” Harry asked, putting the dirty napkins in the bag they used for the trash.
The man looked relieved that he was finally giving the bouquet to another person, and left in a hurry downstairs.
“And what is going to happen in a bit more time? Is Weasley going to be my best friend in a week? Is Granger going to hug me in the corridor in a few days?” Something inside Draco snapped as he talked. He had waited enough, and Harry’s excuses were always the same. Waiting wasn’t going to change things. “Harry! Things aren’t going to solve themselves just because we wait! You have to tell them! Aren’t you a Gryffindor? So be brave! Tell them you and I are together! This isn’t like before, we’re friendly now. They should understand. They—”
They went inside the flat, and while Draco went to the kitchen to put everything he had bought away, Harry sat on the living room armchair feeling very awkward.
“All the difference!” he exclaimed, standing up from the living room sofa where they were sitting. “All the difference, don’t you see it? It’s Potter!”
“Right, but I don't mind. I feel bad making you sleep in another house instead of in your own bed. There’s no problem on my part, really.” He and his friends had slept in the same bed multiple times without anyone batting an eye about it. Of course, it was different sleeping with Harry, but they were going to sleep, nothing else.
“Not enough, dear, not enou— What’s he doing here?” Pansy’s eyes had become cold, and her gaze was fixed at one point behind Draco and Radwah.
Draco has to fight a smile, and she sees how Harry and Narcissa do the same thing. Or well, Narcissa does. Harry is openly smiling.
Sarah nodded with another grimace, and her parents hurried to help her. Harry left, feeling useless, wanting the potion the hospital refused to buy more than ever.
“Making a whole new potion is hard, Ron,” Hermione said. “The Wolfsbane they’re using takes all the suffering away, even during the transformation. I don’t think it’s just an improved Wolfsbane, but something entirely new.”
Harry: Ron came this morning for our training session, but I told him to fuck off. I know! I have to apologise and be nicer to him. And I know you can't believe you said that about Weasley.
Draco thought the flat needed some changes. It was nice, but James, his roommate, was really messy and didn’t have a taste for decoration at all. He arranged his ten cushions on the bed in an aesthetic way and carefully folded his cashmere blue blanket, placing it at the foot of the bed. Now it felt like home.
, and I wear his favorite lingerie at night. It’s my way to tell him that I’m here for him, that he has me, that I have hidden the notes, and the tickets, and the pictures, that he’s safe. That he doesn’t need Yours to be happy, that I can be as good as her and everything he desires.
“That’s for me? Thanks so much!” It always made him happy when his patients gave him small presents. He felt like he was doing something good, even if he couldn’t heal them, if they felt the need to thank him with gifts. Except for Mr. Robinson, of course.
Harry: Yes, I’m aware of my lack of punctuation and my excessive use of the conjunction “and”, thank you very much.
“Try it on, dear,” she said with a bright smile. “I think green looks good in you. Because of your eyes, you know.”
“Are we going to stay here all night or are we going to have fun?” Blaise said, putting away his empty butterbeer bottle and getting up.
Harry heard the door close, and breathed. He had gotten hard at seeing Draco. He really hoped the other man hadn’t noticed.
Nobody had seen Harry. He was going to catch the golden ball and win the match. Draco smiled a little, but then his mouth turned into an horrified grimace. Bakshi had seen Harry too and had hit a bludger his way. The ball hit Harry on the head, and now he was falling to the floor, unconscious.
“I dropped him. It’s us, Dee. I can’t leave you,” Michael said, making a movement as if to touch Draco’s hand, but Draco crossed his arms over his chest in that moment.
“I trust my friend and the potions experts at the hospital. I know they’ve been careful with their work,” Harry said.
“I don’t understand why it doesn’t change for me. It’s always that song. Every night. I’m going mental!” Harry whispered, and Draco imagined that he was furrowing his brow in that adorable way he always did when he was frustrated with something.
I nod and rest my head on his shoulder. I haven’t done this in ages, but it feels so good. However, a few minutes later Harry wriggles and I lift my head.
“My big scar is itching again, and I howled when Healer Stevenson entered before, and he ran so fast he broke his nose against the wall,” she said, smiling and with her blue eyes shining.
Draco laughed. Everyone in their common room had heard Harry sang while he was in the shower and he thought nobody heard him. He was a terrible singer.
“He’s nice! And he makes me dinner every day. I don’t love him, if that’s what you’re thinking, but we’re friends.”
It had been the hardest year of their lives, and he knew it wasn’t over, that they had to learn to live with all the pain and the sorrow that Draco’s death had caused. He knew that he had to learn to live with the hole in his heart, and soul; with the fear of forgetting about Draco; with the angst of seeing his things, his chair at the dining table, the picture on his bedside table, and the right side of the bed intact every morning. However, he knew that little by little he was getting his life back, people to talk to, reasons to smile and to laugh, people to rely on. And he also knew that it would be hard to find reasons to live without Draco, when he has so much to say, and Draco was so far away.*
“This is perfect. I love you.” He closed his eyes, and rested his head on the towel Harry had put on the bathtub edge as a pillow. “Stay with me?”
He spent the Saturday morning in the library studying, and doing his homework, and after lunch, Pansy, Daphne and him went together to the quidditch pitch for their training session.
“What?” Harry started rubbing the scar with the salve. “Excuse me, but my favourite patient is Mr. Robinson next door.”
“You saw me in Charms this morning, Potter, don’t be ridiculous,” he said, only because he knew it’d annoy Harry. He had missed him too. Painfully.
Harry hugged him tighter, wishing not for the first time that it was him under the ground, so Scorpius could have Draco with him.
Ron found him in the Ministry toilets, sat on the dirty floor, and crying his eyes out. It was the 5th of June, Draco’s birthday, only this year, he had no one to write a card to, buy a present for, bake a cake for, to tease, and to talk, and to spend a lovely day with. No one at all.
“Just weird. He has a lot of clothes and was a Slytherin, by the way — he made sure I saw his old scarf — and yesterday when I came home, I found flowers everywhere!” Harry said, before eating a good piece of his lasagna.
“Merlin, I don’t know how you put up with him, Harry. I wasn’t this bad when I was pregnant.” His mother said without even looking at them. She had her sight set on the blanket she was knitting with magic. It looked soft and beautiful, just perfect for their little baby.
today. They look pitiful, as always, and they have written a sad article about how much they miss Padma. I fear that their words get to Harry’s heart, that they break him, and make him confess. We can’t have that. I get dressed and floo to his office.
Draco looked at his friends in anger. He had come here to tell them the good news he had heard, and they had destroyed his hopes with just a few words. Pansy had the decency of looking sorry about it at least. He picked up his homework, ink, and quill without looking at any of them, and left the library. He needed to be alone.
“Yes.” Pansy glared at him, and Draco finally surrendered to her and decided to admit what had been on his mind since that moment. “No, and I think… Do you think that I should… I mean...”
“Can you take this seriously?” Draco asked. Sometimes, he thought that strangling Pansy wouldn’t be so bad.
“This. I don’t want to hide anymore, and I want to annoy Pansy with all the things I think about you.”
“I didn’t want to bother you, and you’re already doing five things.” He pointed to the five cauldrons. “But if you don’t mind, I’ll keep my investigation about your Hogwarts crush. What do you think about Seamus?”
Harry snorted at the note he had found stuck to the kitchen counter. He didn’t mind his new roommate eating his food; since the moment he had met Ron on the Hogwarts Express all those years ago, it always filled him with joy to have someone to share his food with.
“I just want to talk to you. We haven’t talked in ages. I’ve missed it,” Harry said, smiling at him.
The next days followed the same pattern as the day after the revelation that turned Draco’s life into a miserable hell. He was alone most of the time, because when he was with people he couldn’t help but be rude to them.
“Mmm, I think I was around eight,” Lucius answers in that serious voice of his.“I hadn’t done my History homework, so I accidentally burnt it when my tutor asked me to return it. Luckily, my parents were so proud about the magic they forgot that I hadn't done my homework.”
“Maybe the Latin version of little monster, for posh points, you know?” Draco sighed. “We have thought of some names, but Harry doesn’t like my options.”
He couldn’t breath. Michael’s words were like a strong vice around his chest that got tighter and tighter. He used to joke about that, and Draco used to laugh. At how useless he was in cooking. At how he wouldn’t leave his bed in the mornings if Michael didn’t wake him up. But now… Draco had done all those things. He had proven he was capable. And Michael’s laugh and words didn’t make him laugh this time too. He felt tears in his eyes.
Ron didn’t try to talk to him, or to rush him. He sat down next to him, and held him, while muttering nonsenses and kissing his hair.
“We have to think about something that makes us happy, and focus really hard on it. Then we cast the charm,” Hannah said with her fingers playing with one of her thick plaits.
I want to scream. I open my mouth to do it, but the sound doesn’t leave. I’m speechless, and the only thing I can do is watch as my husband walks away from me holding hands with his lover.
“No.” A smile curved Harry’s mouth upwards. “But you know what I mean. And Pansy… Aren’t you afraid of forgetting about him? Sometimes I can’t remember the things he liked or the things he’d say.”
He heard them muttering behind him, but he didn’t care. If he had to spend the rest of his life pining after Harry and being miserable, this one seemed a moment as good as any to start with it.
Draco sighes, defeated and disappointed, and leans against the window that she has been using to look at her family.
“Do you want to eat something?” I ask him. “There’s pasta from yesterday, but I could make you something quick if you want.”
They were right. As soon as they arrived —they were the last ones— Weasley began to remind them of the importance of winning their last match, against Gryffindor, if they wanted to win the Cup.
Harry: Cassie is swimming and Leo is running around. They're so cute! I wish you could see them! You'd love them.
Harry read the note thrice in a row before letting out a relieved sigh. He didn’t know why Malfoy staying made him so relieved, but he supposed he had gotten used to sharing his flat with the git after all this time, and the truth was that he really liked having him as a roommate.
Harry: Sometimes I think of that night, of the stars, and all the stories you told me, and think that maybe you’re one of them now. In the Draco constellation, of course! You’re so far away up there! Can’t you come down here from time to time? At least once? For me?
“My dear flatmate was taking a shower, and I saw him. Radwah, it was glorious. It wiped last night out of my mind.”
Harry: So Pansy found out about me telling Blaise and Goyle about her, but she says she'll let me live and have all my body parts, if I convince Ginny to go out on a date with her.
“What?” Harry looked really confused now. Draco would have laughed if he wasn’t so worried. “Why would I be with you if I hated you?”
“So how’s life with your bedmate?” Ron asked while he, Harry, and Hermione were having dinner the next day in a small restaurant.
Ron laughed again, and Harry ignored him. In just an hour he’d be having a date with Draco. Ron could laugh all he wanted, but Harry was happy. He had been very anxious after leaving the note asking Draco out, as he hadn’t known if he had made his intentions clear. And as it turned out he hadn’t. Thankfully, Pansy Parkinson of all people had left a note in the living room asking about it, so he had written another for Draco, this time without space for doubts. He couldn’t help but smile like an idiot.
They prepared the table while Hermione talked about some Ministry gossip, and Harry thought that he should tell his friends about what he had learned about his flatmate in the last days.
“I’m sorry, I was more interested in that article they wrote about Weasley. The one about him being the sexiest man of the month and that picture of his red face next to it. Now that’s amazing, Potter,” Draco says as she puts on her bra and summer robe.
Harry: I hate this. It's like I can't make the effort to remember things because you're not here anymore, so what's the point if I can't tell you about them?
“Yes, of course. I have the notes and the pictures here.” He raises his eyebrows at that. I keep talking. “You can show them to the Aurors. You’ll tell them that Padma sexually harassed you, and that when she discovered your relationship with her sister she got jealous, tried to blackmail you, so she met with Parvati at that lake. They fought and her own sister killed her. Parvati got jealous, too, of your relationship with Padma. It’s the perfect crime for a jealous person. Don’t you think? And we have the evidence! You can forget about all this and then we can be happy again. What do you think, love?”
“I’m in a bad mood because an idiot almost made me choke,” Draco signed, glaring at Harry in what he hoped was a playful way.
Harry: I know you want to know everything about it, although you say these books are stupid and the author should go to Azkaban for writing so badly, but we both know that that’s just you being a posh prat and that you secretly love them, and have read them while you’re in the toilet.
“I’m sorry. I have a potion that might help you with that.” He turned to her parents. “A friend of mine is a potions master, and he and one of his colleagues had investigated an improved Wolfsbane. It can make the pain go away during the transformation. The Ministry hasn’t approved it yet, but the hospital has. If you accept, Sarah will be the first person to try it.”
Draco opened his mouth to protest. He had thought all that too, but somehow hearing Pansy and Greg saying it made it sound a thousand times worse.
“I had fun with him too!” Draco said. “We did a lot of things together, and I have very good memories of my time with him. You don’t know everything. I liked him. I loved him.”
“And are we listening to Granger now?” Blaise signed with clumsy fingers. “She doesn’t know anything about it.”
Harry: Blaise and Goyle came by this afternoon. They brought firewhiskey and we drank together. It was weird.
“You don’t have a spare bed for me, and I refuse to sleep on your couch. It’s lumpy.” Draco opened the wardrobe and looked inside. He doubted it was big enough for all his clothes, but he hoped his new roommate wouldn’t mind sharing a bit of his space. “And I’m not going back to Michael’s flat.”
Harry: I asked her why she hasn't asked Ginny out yet, and her answer was that she's shy. Pansy. Parkinson. Is. Shy.
“I’m not dropping you,” Draco talked through clenched teeth. “You broke up with me. This is what you get. Or do you think I’m going to crawl back to you every time you get tired of me?”
“I’m—.” His fingers didn’t respond to him. They were shaking, and it didn’t help that his brain didn’t know what to say either. “I can’t be—.”
Harry: I had you last year and all the other ones before. I can't go to the cemetery this time, all alone, knowing that I won't have you to hug me and make me a hot chocolate when we're back at home.
“That’s what you liked? That I looked like Weasley? I have always known you three had something weird going on!”
“Fine,” Draco says, hugging her mother. “We had a busy week, but something great happened. Did you already tell them, Lily?”
Harry: She made an homophobic comment, that's why I wanted to kill her. I knew you wanted to know. Impatient git.
Draco turns around and stares at him. She's sure her eyes are wide open and she can't close her mouth in her surprise. Her father apologizing about something is a new occurrence, especially about misgendering her.
“Of course not. I didn’t see him those last weeks, and living here was kind of a last moment decision.”
I’m about to leave when I find something else —inside one of her bags—, two portkey tickets to Ibiza, one for H. Potter and another one for P. Patil. Harry hates the crowds and the beach. It’s like his own lover didn’t know him in the slightest. It confirms my first suspicions: this affair didn’t mean anything to Harry.
“Are you alright, dear?” Mrs. Williams asked with concern. “Oh! There’s a young lady, isn’t there? And you think she doesn’t like you.”
