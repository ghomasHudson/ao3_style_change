Harry was about to accept when a girl that looked to be around his age walked in, coming from the direction of the dressing room.
—What if they ask you to spy? — Victor didn’t answer immediately.
—Look over there, we have another newbie
—You were in a hospital, Sirius said you were tackled by a wolf—
—I think there are way worse people to get acquainted with
Remus leaned a little over the bag to take a look and Harry saw him moving his nose, as if sensing something. Could he smell it? No…that wasn’t possible
They walked out and into the living room. There the other invitees, mostly Blaise´s friends, where scattered among different groups. The overlapping conversations filling the place with noise.
Harry scratched his neck and stole a look out of the shop´s window. Tom was still there talking on the phone.
It was probably taking some effort, since he had managed to somehow “miss” all the flights his parents had scheduled for him to get back to England.
—No need— Ron answered before they could say anything about it —. We got them
—Yes, I understand —he said giving a small smile and started to turn around to leave when Bellatrix stopped him.
—And you have said several times, how you never imagined yourself to be a parent— she added—. You thought were infertile
Narcisa chuckled at hearing that, they sure understood each other.
Harry then saw something out the corner of his eyes and turned to find Malfoy coming into the kitchen
He balanced himself on his feet.
Harry took his pen from the table, determined to continue studying but stopped mid air
—What? yeah…uh I’m not worried about it — he answered a little unsure about the change in subject.
Draco was about to ask him what the hell was he on about when his mother appeared
Meanwhile his relatives were dying to get rid of him. Harry liked to pretend he couldn’t listen to everything that was being said about him, but his relatives were far from subtle.
He’d just touched down on the outskirts of the pitch when he was hit full-force by one of Harry’s hugs.

Draco let his palm fly, snapping at the middle of Harry’s arse.  Without thinking, he threw another, coming down in the same spot, and watching Harry jolt.  He held nothing back; he never had, and he felt distinctly like Harry wouldn’t want him to.
But Harry was undoubtedly asleep, and there’d be plenty of time for that in the future.
Hannah barked a laugh.  “No, you’re right.  He does have quite the fan club, doesn’t he?  Now, I just indulge him when he brings some twiggy tree in from the cold and convinces me it can’t survive unless we replant it in our home.”

Harry looked stupidly earnest as he replied.  “Yes?  Why wouldn’t I?”
“Draco.  You’re supposed to be adding that unicorn hair now.”
“No – slaloms!  We get to do the fun dives, like a roller coaster,” a Muggleborn girl argued, which was incomprehensible to Draco.
, he wanted to say.  Instead, he conveyed his question slowly, emphasizing the consonants in some irrational attempt to make Morpheus remember it all correctly.  But, as usual, this only backfired on him, as the man got it in his head that Draco was mocking him.
It was enough to drive Draco to finally wrap his hand around Harry’s cock and pump it desperately as he thrust.
Perhaps Potter had felt it too, but he was dissipating the aura with humor, quipping now about the cheeriness of the Slytherin dungeons.  To which Draco quipped about the favoritism of the Gryffindors.
The elf scowled spectacularly but did eventually admit, “Mister Potter sir has been out of sorts lately…”  He gestured towards a decadent plate of linguini in a light cream sauce.  “There it is.”

Draco glanced down the table to where the man chatted animatedly with Hannah and Longbottom.  He was glad to see he looked less dead today, even if it stung to be unwelcome in that radiant presence.  Lifting his utensils, he forced himself to eat more and look less.
“Draco,

he wondered.  Prove that he could dance well enough to get even Malfoy to join in—a tall order, given Harry’s history with dancing, but he was nothing if not a Gryffindor.
Malfoy’s gaze, of course, landed on Harry with the smug beginnings of a smirk.  “Potter!  Fancy seeing you here.”

for you to call me by my given name,” he said instead, because jokes were all Harry seemed capable of responding to.
They parted ways at the edge of the pitch, and he watched her red ponytail bobbing after her as she disappeared into the lockers.  It wasn’t even a question, where he was going next.
, Draco corrected furiously – though he didn’t dare say it aloud for fear of proving Morpheus’ point.  Moments like this were easy enough to ignore as long as he pretended he was somewhere else.
They made it to the library without incident; Pince had gone to bed, so it was just a ghost or two on guard duty.  They were easy enough to get past, if you knew their habits enough to slip by.  Luckily, the magi-computers were in a separate little room that had been installed for the express purpose of limiting the amount of magic that would mess with the devices’ function.  But it also meant that they could close the door, cast a muffling charm, and then talk like normal people without anyone ever coming to check.
But, regardless, he looked like someone who was ready to seduce Draco Malfoy.

He mustered a nod out of politeness, half-hearted as it was.  It was all pointless – they would come for him again.  Whether he walked out of here healthy or remained bleeding out on the pitch, his fate would be the same.
“Yeah, well, I’ve never had a heart-to-heart in an alley before,” he responded, clearly grasping at straws.
He ran through several snappy comebacks in his head until he landed on one that was half-joke, half-truth.  He couldn’t bear to be flippant after everything – not fully, at least.  “When it comes to beating you, I’m never satisfied.”
“What was it that Sam said to you yesterday in class?”
The weight of that thought struck him hard.  Things weren’t getting better.
“Right.  You only
to do with the way Malfoy’s body felt against his.  Somehow both comfortable and electrifying.  It certainly wasn’t the way their dance had lingered in Harry’s mind ever since, replaying with startlingly clarity whenever he caught sight of the man from across the room.
VOICE-OVER: Cedric learned to love baking from an early age from his father, Amos, and now shares that passion with his girlfriend, Cho.  He is a senior at Hogwarts Culinary Institute in Scotland and has received multiple job offers from patisseries in both France and Switzerland for when he graduates.  Still deciding where he’d like to go, Cedric is enjoying his remaining days at school and relaxes by volunteering at the local reptile-and-migratory-birds animal shelter and playing racquetball with his friends.  Last year, he also started a nonprofit that focuses specifically on feeding hungry Labradors in Liverpool, and he continues to oversee that on the weekends.  In addition to his own charity, he also fundraises for several other tertiary charities like Orphans of Liverpool, Liverpool Healthcare for All™, and the ‘Let’s Make Bridge Club Exciting Again’ Granny Club of Liverpool.  An honors student through and through, Cedric also runs his own tutoring service at Hogwarts Culinary, which services over 200 students each semester!  [aside] Busy boy, isn’t he?
“Do you want me to?” Harry asked, raspy voice the only clue as to what he was feeling.
“Mmph-”  Draco cut off the pained grunt that exploded out of him at the sensation.  It
He wasn’t sure what his face was doing, but he was quite sure it was doing a poor job of masking the pain.

“Oh, Draco…”  She petted a hand through his messy hair.  “That’s not true – you can still get out.  Get out while you can.  Don’t get stuck here like me.”
– I’m sure.”
“Oh, so you hadn’t heard, then?”
[DRACO, who has frozen in shock, with wide eyes trained on HARRY, suddenly snaps back into himself and refocuses.  His hands begin to move again, adding more sugar to the fault lines and attaching more ornate pieces to the outer edges.  With a deep breath, he lifts the roof, eyes flicking to HARRY for only a brief moment before continuing.]
“And think – soon you’ll be up there with them!  I’m so pleased I ran into you, my boy.  Absolutely
“But Mister Malfoy –

made the man’s eyes snap up.  They were tortured and pleading and turned on.  “You looked…really good,” he rasped, barely above a whisper.
But he was at his absolute threshold with Morpheus’ Miscellany at this point – and he also had nothing to lose.
“You’re doing this just to spite me.”
Potter rounded the corner of the staff table, and, based on his path, Draco had the sudden realization of why he was here.
He hummed his approval.  “I do like the sound of that.  Alright, Potter – I want you to tell me what kept you aroused in an empty room for the past hour.”
After several minutes, he glanced down at the page he had typed.  He seriously considered burning it.  But then, after rereading several times, he decided that it was actually the perfect thing to unsettle Potter.  He remembered the man’s blush from the night of the Sorting Feast and desperately wished to summon such a beautiful expression to his face once more.
Did you just say
Potter blustered for a few seconds, trying – and failing – to wipe the guilt from his face.  “None of your business, Malfoy!” he said at last.
Being different was a terrible feeling; it took time and suffering to get used to.  Throw love into the mix, and it was a volatile compound.  The worst feeling in the world was fearing that your love would hate you if they knew who you truly were.
Draco leaned in, enjoying the praise, when a look of terror crossed Harry’s face.
“Ooh, yeah – can we?” several others clamored, remembering the fun from two weeks ago.

“Err, why?” Dean asked, snapping Harry back to the present.

"I have no idea. I was just trying to get home."
Harry coughed, and Malfoy's grin sharpened. And Harry didn't know how that was possible. "Pavlovian. Refers to Pavlov, the Muggle who studied conditioning." Malfoy wanked the cock again. "So, Pavlovian refers to a situation where a positive or negative stimulus is used to change a response to something neutral."
the results of the Magical Analysis on Bartram’s note, before Rosemary stuck her head in shortly after 4. "Halloo, sunshine. Miss me?"
"This hat ended up in Misuse this morning. Addressed to me, for some reason." Arthur shrugged before smiling back at Harry. "It's got a faulty Extension Charm and this penis was inside."
, for instance. Also,
what about our situation could be seen as Pavlovian." And the bastard gave the cock another wank, and Harry didn't know if he wanted to laugh or punch him or snog him until he couldn't see straight.
"To see me, of course. You always seem to come when I'm on shift. Suspicious, really."
He coughed. "Paperwork that is so very exciting for a brain like Granger's?"
"Okay, one, it's not a sex toy collection, and it just sounds dirty when you say it like that. It's part of an open investigation, and as such I cannot comment directly. Two, if you're going to take the piss out of me about the cocks on my desk, you need to provide me with a lot more beer first."
"Yes yes, you do that. I apparently need to talk to my best friend about what he knows about your
Harry blinked at him. “Coriander?”
Harry backed quickly out of his cubicle, but it was too late. Sixteen cocks perked up, the hat flew off his chair from the force of his cock's sproinging; Vindaloo vibrated hard enough that the specimen jar holding the creepily clingy CopyCock nearly toppled off the shelf, Sparklepenis started shooting sparks five feet in the air, the new penis, which Harry
“Stasis Charms work by repressing an object’s natural energies and refocusing them inward,” Malfoy said, tossing the cock into the Containment Receptacle. “It’s like how when you put a Stasis Charm over a cup of hot tea, you get a puff of steam when you release it.”
,” Harry snapped again. Really, how could someone possibly be this insulting and obnoxious without even realizing the full extent of it? Then again, Harry supposed he and Malfoy had always had a sort of sixth sense for getting under each other’s skin, a strangely preternatural ability to tell when a particular jab was hitting its mark and really pissing off the other one.
Because the
That caused another burst of laughter from Ron, and Harry shook his head. "Bloody wankers, the both of you." He then proceeded to ignore them and drink his beer.
“What,” said Harry, backing away. “What are you doing. Stop. Stop doing that.”
Harry glanced over to see Rosemary waving at Hermione, still laughing too hard to answer. He sighed. "What's up?"
fake cocks in his office?"
"Fucking Merlin," he sighed.
"Merlin, Potter. Are you going to get naked or am I going to write this off as a loss and go back to work?"
"So those are the cocks?" Seamus leaned in close, examining both from every angle. "And they really get hard?"
"That was when I thought we were in this together! United in our misery! I just want to strangle you right now!"
The penis twitched. Harry blinked a few times. No, definitely not his imagination. The penis really had twitched and was now beginning to harden. Malfoy gave it another stroke with his wand and, yes, no question about it. It was getting hard. Malfoy swapped his wand for his quill and used the feathery end to give the penis a tickle. It twitched again.
None of them were reattaching a penis. It was a somewhat comforting thought.
And. Oh. That was a whole different sort of problem, Harry found.
friend." Harry stuffed a bite into his mouth, aware he'd lapsed into whinging.
“It’s just weird, is all,” Harry said when he took the third one to St Mungo’s. He’d forgotten to grab a Containment Receptacle on his way out of the Ministry and had been forced to wrap it in yesterday’s
Harry snickered. "Yeah, I thought so too. I mean, this case is going to be a pain in the arse, pun intended, but at least it sounds fancy, I guess.."
Rosemary gave him a long look, then she nodded. "Yup. I'll see you in a few hours." She turned back to her office.
“But,” Harry began, and broke off. Malfoy looked up and arched a brow expectantly at him, so Harry sighed and went on. “Coriander messes with charmwork?”
Harry sighed a bit to himself as she left. He looked at the cock. He looked at the stack of paperwork. He looked at the cock again. He looked at the clock on his wall. It was five til, and there was no way Harry was staying overtime to get this done. Everything would be waiting for him bright and early tomorrow morning. He would just take care of it then.
Pansy blinked, "Draco? What does Draco know?"
Her eyes swept meaningfully up to his scar. "I know. Go on up, now. Fourth floor."
Harry sighed. "You're going to tell Ron about this, aren't you?"
“I know the rules, you wanker,” Harry said. He threw a teaspoon at Ron’s head and missed. “I was rat-arsed, I’m not stupid. It’s not like I Apparated into Mr Smythe's bathroom on purpose. And anyhow, I was off-duty. What I do in my personal time shouldn’t have consequences at work.” He scowled at where the spoon had landed against one of the skirting boards. “It’s entirely unfair.”
went out the window around the time it became my job to collect cocks from around the city.”
Back at the Ministry, he settled in at his desk. He sat the newest cock in line beside the other two and took a moment to pray that he’d crack this case before he ran out of space on his desk. He finished up his request for Magical Analysis on the note that had been sent to Bartram and sent it off to be processed, then pulled out a blank sheet of parchment and began to make notes.
Seamus spun around in his chair once again, and Harry eyed the entrance of his cubicle. "You here to finally let that Sticking Charm go?"
"No." Harry muttered. "But Seamus might."
The Containment Receptacle did nothing to muffle the cock’s frantic buzzing, and the other three people in the lift with Harry kept slipping him sidelong glances while he concentrated on keeping a firm hold of the box. The cock gave a hard twitch, jostling the lid, and Harry gritted his teeth and tightened his grip and tried not to imagine how bloody embarrassing it’d be if he dropped the box and the vibrating cock flopped out onto the floor right here in front of these unsuspecting people.
over there as well? Where you wouldn't have to… look at it all day?"
Both cocks
He tucked the paper into one of the evidence envelopes he’d brought with him and rifled through the stack of paperwork until he found a Request for Magical Analysis. He clipped that to the open envelope to send off later, then turned his attention to the instruction card.
“All yours,” the Patrolman said, snickering before he ambled away.
"I'm shocked it's taken you this long to show up," Harry said, sweeping his paperwork into a haphazard pile.
Harry reached out and grabbed the plate in one hand, and a biscuit in the other. Whatever the shape, Ron made delicious biscuits, rather like his tea. "This is the only reason you're not dead right now." And he took a large bite.
“If you want to be technical about it, then yes, I’m only talking to you because I’m the Healer on duty up here and it’s my job to deal with you,” Malfoy said loftily, then smirked. “But more often than not it does turn out to be the best and most exciting part of my day, frightening as that may be.”
“So what you’re telling me,” Harry said, trying to force his hands to stop clenching into fists, “is that you’ve lost my evidence.”
“Not to worry,” Malfoy said, setting the cock aside. He pulled open a drawer and produced a fresh copy of the paperwork. “I’ve got it here.”
It made a strange kind of sense. Hermione
“I want you to think about this very carefully before you go running your mouth to him,” Harry said. “If this person is creating replicas of actual people’s cocks, it’s not entirely unreasonable that yours might turn up at some point. And unless you want
Harry snorted and left. As he waited at the lifts, he caught himself smiling a little, and wasn’t that strange?
There was
Malfoy laughed again. "If you were going to strangle me, you would have done it in the initial burst of indignation."
"Yeah, okay." Ron wandered into his cubicle, peering at his desk. "Where are the others? You had more."
He settled for slapping the stack of forms down on the exam table with a loud smack. "68-J again."
It was even worse now that Harry knew exactly who he'd be spending those few hours with. The only consolation was that Malfoy was the one who'd have to fill out form 68-J in its entirety. That was nearly enough to make Harry feel sorry for the bastard.
Malfoy shoved the cock away from his face and laughed. "All right. All right. Yes I did. I didn't expect you to come here, though."
Malfoy blinked twice more as his gaze sharpened. "I'm the one who came, I rather thought I won."
The minute she started naming forms, Harry could see Ron’s eyes practically glaze over. Only this time, now that he was looking for it, he also saw the way Hermione looked rather satisfied at that. She slipped Harry a wink as she packed up the last of the cocks.
The idea of someone coming in to investigate what sounded like an entire horde of angry bees and instead discovering Harry with six erect penises on his desk filled him with panic. On the heels of that came the horrified realization that although by some miracle he’d thus far avoided discovering exactly how realistic the penises were when they ‘came,’ if the vibrations kept up much longer Harry was going to find out firsthand.
Of course, when Seamus made the connection, he announced it loudly. In front of Ron. Who looked liked the Christmas Train of Piss Taking had arrived early.
“Second year, I think,” Harry said. “She went on a kick about expanding her vocabulary. Went straight through the whole thing, cover to cover. Took her about four days.”
The man’s hands stilled on his cup, though that was the only tell he’d even heard.  “Oh.”
“Aggression,” Harry finished with a glare, ignoring Draco’s incredulous grin.  “So we were always a little ridiculous when we came together – you would drive me into grandiose fights that I wouldn’t otherwise pick, and I would make you throw dramatic temper tantrums when you lost.”
But Hannah’s face softened a degree, and she patted him on the back with an air of amused sympathy.  “There, there.  I’m sure he’ll come around.  It’s not like he’s forgotten you.”
No one in their right mind would wear this!”
[CEDRIC is curling them perfectly with the parchment paper he cut into individual segments earlier for this purpose.  Unlike the others, who only manage to roll one before they harden and need to go back into the oven, he can do four in one go.]
The man snatched his wrists and gave him a challenging glare.
He bit the inside of his cheek at the arch expression.  The guilt was eating him alive.  “I needed…a break.  For a while.”
GEORGE: Now that we’ve dispelled the bad mojo from the room, it’s time to announce the challenge.  Are any of you familiar with ballet?
And really, that just wasn’t

DRACO: [quietly] Are you?
She waited a beat, as if expecting him to continue, but since he’d been utterly unprepared for this meeting, he found himself drawing a blank.  McGonagall was terribly intimidating at the best of times, and furthermore, she bore the knowledge of all his faults and mistakes.  It gave him anxiety to think about what she actually must think of him.
DRACO: Yes.

Draco felt her curious eyes on him long after he’d turned to walk away.
He tugged apart Harry’s cheeks, and the man’s body lurched in his hands as the sensitivity caused an involuntary reaction.  With the help of the spell, Draco sunk a finger deep and messily into his arse.
He’d risked the relative peace of being ignored by his father, the only job he’d ever come to enjoy, and his own blasted

Another sigh.  “Very well.  I was planning to speak with Harry already, given the situation with his classes this morning, so I suppose I might as well confront this while I’m at it.”
He said it despairingly, and Harry was silent.  Draco wondered what expressions they were both wearing on the other side of this door.

HARRY pours caramel onto his base biscuit for the lake and begins frizzing trees out of the remaining sugar in the pot.  They work like madmen, and if it weren’t for their harried frustration, the scenes of CEDRIC would convince you that it’s a leisurely day.]

His answer was breathy and immediate.  “Yes.”
“What precisely is bothering you about this?” he asked.  “Why do you feel so compelled to change it?”
“Is there something else I can make you, dear?”
Ron went to peer into the next room but Draco spoke again, his words making both Hermione and Ron frown.
He almost jumped when he heard a small whine carry under the gap of the door then, his heart stuttering for a beat before he shuffled around and opened it enough for Rubeus to slip through.
Draco said, thinking on it a moment before he looked up to the older Beta.

He murmured, raising the bin in gesture before he walked out the door without another word.
He hated it. All of it. The memories, the pain… the want.
“Yes—no, I don’t… no,
“Do they know, lad?”
Draco mused, looking up at Harry from under his lashes, his lip quirking into a hint of a smile. Harry stiffened when he felt the boy’s body shift slightly, angling his hip so that it brushed up against Harry’s groin.

A very long talk.
“Hermione…”
Hello everyone!
Draco moved fast, diving for a piece of bacon and raising it to his lips— but Harry moved
Harry whispered in his ear, teeth grazing roughly against his neck.
“Tell him to reel in his scent. He shouldn’t act like some common wizard loitering around Knockturn Alley and, and just release his pheromones like that…”
When was the last time Draco had been touched like this…
Harry murmured, a husky note colouring his voice as he crawled back up Draco’s body until he was at his neck again, burying his face there like it belonged.
“Don’t worry about Ron either, dear, ever since he turned forty he's been as moody as an old man. Pay him no mind, he’ll come around.”
She reached out to her son, only to have her hand slapped away, Draco’s eyes raising, tears no longer held back as the betrayal in his icy gaze settled on her with a heavy determination.
He went to the bird, snatching the note from her beak quickly and reading its contents, his gut dropping at what he read.
Harry growled, hanging his head for a brief second before he breathed in harshly, another threatening rumble rising up through his chest. Draco stilled, his instincts screaming at him to submit when he was suddenly hit with a wave of angry alpha pheromones.
Ron didn’t remove his hand.
“10 inches, too, a good-sized wand for a boy your age…”
🙈 Let me know what you think hehe xxx
he was for attention.
”I d-didn’t… I—“
Harry surged forward, his wand in hand and the retractory spell already leaving his tongue.
Hermione shook her head and scowled.
He spoke so strangely, almost entirely monotone except for the way he smiled at the end— a tiny twist of his lips that wasn’t convincing in the least.
“Yours, always…”
Hermione shivered, not liking the directions of her thoughts.
She said, reaching over and snagging a piece of cheese covered macaroni before popping it in her mouth. Draco nodded his head slowly, his brows pulling together in thought before he finally spoke, his words unmatched to the thoughts swirling around in his skull.
She was going to miss that.
Draco nodded in understanding, his shoulders relaxing a little. His eyes dropped to his feet as he thought back on what Hermione had said this morning.

Draco quickly huffed out the rest of his words, standing up in one swift motion before pushing his chair back in.
“This is probably going to be a big job… be a doll and prep the wall for me while I get us something to drink.”
“Really?”
”I only t-took it this week…”
Draco nodded slowly, trying not to show just how much this was all killing him. One whole year… one whole year to live with a
Enjoy xx
Draco’s sluggish mind crawled slowly through each winding thought, yet nothing stuck, everything just continued to pass through him at an almost laughable pace.
The witch sighed, and rubbed his back gently before she eventually got off the bed and headed out the door, looking back to his curled up form one last time.
When the Alpha had walked in, it had taken all of his strength not to turn on his heel and run out of the room. He
No. It had to be done. Ron was his guardian, he was supposed to be the adult here and he couldn’t just pretend that it wasn’t happening.
He felt the thick head of his Alpha’s cock nudge at his entrance, and without more than a warning grunt, it was pushing inside of him, splitting him apart, simultaneously opening him and filling him up.
“Eat your damn breakfast. After this, we are both going to go through this house and clean it up. You’re living in a bloody pigsty!”
“You’re both great cooks.”
(See the end of the chapter for
George snickered. "Oh well, carry on then."
Harry’s eyes narrowed. “How do you know what it is and isn’t supposed to do?”
to it?”
“Oh!” Harry said. “Oh my god.”
And while at lunch, he commented that the new penis looked an awful lot like Harry's. Which, yeah, after that many years of communal showers in the Gryffindor dorms, Harry probably should’ve seen that coming and left the newest cock hidden away in its hat.
“It’s called
"I'm just being nosey. A sex toy being sent to Member Bartram has become the talk of the Ministry."
Harry just shook his head, because phrased like that, it made a bit of sense. Stupid sense, and he was really starting to worry about Malfoy's mind, but sense.
“What,” Harry stammered out. “Have you lost your mind? No! I’m not going to touch it.”
“Nnnggh,” Harry said, flinching again as his brain helpfully supplied a colorful mental picture of what it must feel like to have one’s cock and balls Splinched off. He took a deep breath, then another, and another. Right. He had a job to do here. He was a professional. He was here to help.
"No." Harry kept his words flat, as the last thing he needed was to add his exes to the current list of things his friends were giving him shit for. "Unfortunately, Polyjuice ingredients are easy to get. And I can think of a bunch of people who'd be able to brew it and who see me often enough to get my hair. Including you."
"Don't touch that, it's evidence."
He hated it when she started using all those big words at him. It reminded him, "Your bloody page a day word calendar thing is a menace. Are you aware I spent my morning thinking of synonyms for 'cheerful' when I was talking to Rosemary? I think she thought I was on Forgetfulness Potions."
Harry was required to stun it three more times over the course of Malfoy's examination, just because every time he opened his mouth, it perked right back up again and continued its attempts to reach him. It put a damper on the whole flirting thing, because Malfoy was getting obviously annoyed by the second perk-up.
“Healer Malfoy,” the Mediwitch repeated with a smile Harry couldn't quite comprehend someone using while saying Malfoy's name. "Exam room 12. I'll let him know you're waiting and he'll be in just as soon as he finishes up with the patient he's currently seeing to."
"What do you mean, it's not real?"
Well. Best get on with it. The sooner he got started, the sooner he’d be done and could go back to sitting around his tiny office and being bored out of his skull. Harry made short work of dismantling the protective Wards. When they fell and Harry got his first look at the specimen he was meant to collect, he couldn’t help the full-body flinch of sympathy for the poor bloke who’d had the accident.
"Well… If anyone deserves being told to shove it, it's Bartram."
“I’m going to go get a cuppa,” Harry said abruptly. “Do you mind if I step out for a sec?”
lovely, as is being forced to stay overtime because of you and all your bloody paperwork.”
And fuck, but Malfoy's hand felt perfect, tight and smooth and oh god Harry was lost. Completely lost. He leaned in, kissing Malfoy frantically, knowing he was too close for anything but sloppy, breathless, gasping kisses. Malfoy's hand was tight on his cock, his other was gentle, cradling his head. Malfoy pulled back, pressing Harry's head firmly against his shoulder and murmuring in his ear. "Come on. Come on." And Harry was helpless to resist. Malfoy's words and hands pulled his orgasm from him, unraveling him like a thread.
When he could finally stand up without falling back down again, the Omega quickly wrenched down his ruined pants, another wretched sob leaving his lips as he hurried out of the rest of his clothes and balled them against his naked chest.
The answering snarl was
Draco stiffened, something so familiar about the detached way the man spoke… it reminded him of his father.
“I’m ok,”
Ron’s tone had become oddly sincere, the sound of it running a shiver up Draco’s spine.
Harry snarled, his heavy body suddenly rolling onto Draco, pinning his wrists hard to the ground.
See you in the end notes 👀
By the time Harry had made it back to his room, it had already been a good few hours. Ron had been late, which didn’t exactly
He blinked back tears, but more fell in their place, painting his cheeks wet and causing dirt to stick to his skin.
“Gone through your first heat?’
He wanted to move forward, to pull the crying boy into his arms and hold him until he stopped shaking… but something told him that it would be a bad idea to touch the Omega right now.
Now that expression was pointed at him, and he didn’t know why.
“Is Hermione talking to someone?”
He scratched behind Rubeus’s ears, his smile picking up a little more when the beast unconsciously lifted his back leg and started to scratch at the air too.
Draco stuffed down his anxiety, instead dragging his best ‘Lucius Malfoy’s smile-that-wasn’t-really-a-smile’ onto his face, before swishing around swiftly and marching into the dining room.
“What exactly are you hoping to do with that? Are you actually thinking of doing this by hand?”
“I cast Muffliato before I came in here, so do feel free to scream if you need. We don’t have to worry about Hermione and Ron waking up to it.”
“Wander-weed! Of course! Oh, that’s brilliant, I’ll have to test that out next Friday. Fancy lending me a hand, then?”
Lucius and Narcissa had been the ice prince and princess of Hogwarts in every sense of the word. That was the one thing they both had in common with each other.
He liked the kid, liked him a lot, and things had been getting better again… he really didn’t want to go and ruin it all…
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
Then two more hard smacks that had Draco lurching forward, the stinging heat in his ass bringing tears to his eyes.
“I am not a child!”
”Not many people know it but honey-milk weed and dried acklelope petal can h-help with… with morning sickness.”
He couldn’t.
Hermione asked with a wry smile, her eyes watching Draco shove another large bite into his already stuffed mouth.
“So, that’s the farm.”
“We don’t expect you do a lot, really, we just want you to help out a little, do your part, you know? Our Rose is a good girl and she happily tended to the animals when she was here, never once complained. She’d spend all day with the horses if she could, she loves horses…”
Draco shivered under the softly spoken words, his arms squeezing his mother tighter as he buried his head into her scent gland, greedily breathing in the tranquil smell. It wasn’t often that his mother released her pheromones, it was only in the quiet times like this that she would share it with him… when his
, by the time I leave, you’ll be ready to be left to your own devices. That’s what you want,
It felt like they had stained his flesh, branding him with the searing reminder of why they had fallen.
? What the fuck had he been thinking?
Draco wrinkled his nose, already hearing his father’s voice echoing in his mind,
Enjoy xx
When Draco nodded jerkily, Ron’s stomach lurched.
“You smell like
“Just in my free time… I found a book in my father’s library, and I just, I was bored.”
growl, like some kind of wild beast.
Lucius had been waiting to mate him with a pure-blooded Alpha of good stock, preferably one that would help reintegrate the Malfoy name back into society. If he found out that Draco had already been taken by another, forced or not, he would probably never let his son see the light of day again.
“I noticed… that some of my special ingredients from the cupboard are missing, kid, do you know anything about that?”
my bloody father, you knot-headed prick.”
His large body moved suddenly, pinning Draco with his own weight as he forced a knee between the boy's legs, his cock twitching as the feel of the Omega’s sweaty skin against his own. The Alpha sunk his teeth into Draco’s shoulder as he quickly lined himself up with the boy’s entrance, his dick nudging at the tight little hole as he readied himself to thrust.
The woman pursed her lips.
—Maybe that is the problem, you have never been challenged before, — Snape took a quill and started scribbling —. Ill shall appoint you with a study group and a classmate as your tutor, I think Mister Malfoy would do nicely
Harry bounced his leg impatiently. The soft music at the hip coffee shop felt like it was mocking him, making a soundtrack out of his discomfort.
Tom thought about for a moment.
—Agree? — he asked
—Sued?! I am the one who is going to sue
— Vernon! —his aunt screamed while he was dragged up the stairs.
attacking her? — he refuted—. She is your aunt
—Well you won´t be forever, and you have to make the good choices now
Harry pursed his lips losing momentum, not wanting to taunt anymore. There was a small silence and for a moment he thought that would be it, but Tom surprised him speaking again.
Tom looked at him strangely and Harry knew he wanted to stress the importance of the trip, but they had company.
So they already knew…
—So Milo — Lavender said interrupting his train of thought—. I have a friend that thinks you are cute.
—I told him he should had bought a plushy snake or something —Draco yelled from the other side of the room.
Harry was taken aback at the insistence, thinking a simple refusal should have sufficed as he was not about to explain to her his motives. He saw Ron rubbing his forehead uncomfortable.
—Are you really surprised? It was always going to be Sirius, he is the favorite
—Haha you asshole— he accepted with good humor —. So you’re taller now, enjoy it while it last
—Oh, is this like…with the whole class?
—. I’m going to let him in now —
—They are all manifested lyons — Sirius argued.
—Who?
—That was fast — Bellatrix said looking at Tom up and down.
And quite the difference, as there was never even a chance of hiding it. As soon as she was born her blonde lock had given her away, and as if it wasn’t enough, she then had presented as a veela, in a family known for their strong dog blood.
After hours the shopping mall felt decadent. With no people in it, silent hallways and dim lights, it was such a contrast from the usual lively place. There in the middle of the technology section, Harry was sitting on one of the counters of the closed department store, eyes glued to a flat tv screen, where some kind of gossip show was airing.
—Don´t say that I haven’t seen you in two years— she refuted.
Harry just started at her blankly, resolute to not play along.
—Well then, good thing i didn’t bring a child into that house... there would have been nothing left for him— she said this with such conviction, her eyes lost somewhere else as if was a deep irrefutable reflection.
Harry saw Hermione writing quickly, hurrying to add the last information into her notes just as the bell announcing the end of the class started to ring.
He just gave her a forced smile, she didn’t know the half of it
—Sure thing —
—So behave like it, you´ll be free, stop taking their bullshit, you are the Norwegian dragon
—I’m not — Draco defended half laughing.
It took her a moment but when she decided to move again it was mechanical and with purpose.
—Well it seems he is staying and besides, My mother always says it, Sirius biggest accomplishment was convincing everyone he is harmless
—So how you been? — she tried again.
—Heyyyy, Hope you guys didn´t fight in my absence — he said jokingly—. So Harry… I wanted to introduce you, this is my dear friend Victor, he is a snake, the first time you meet one our age, right? — he announced proudly.
—Well, How does it fit? — Madame Malkin asked.
—Is an omega thing — he answered and jumped on his chair when his uncle hit the table with his hand.
—Ahh yeah — he said wincing — She is…its actually…lately hmmm…yeah— he accepted quietly at the end.
Ron was feeling hungry, so he hurried his steps to the house. The little cobble road that lead to the door was a bit muddy after yesterday´s rain and the plants on the garden were starting to look neglected, giving the usually bright house a runed down appearance.
—I´m playing the long game here Victor
—You don´t like his boyfriend? —
—Milo, legally…is a long story
Ron went to stand up, but Ginny grabbed him by the arm stopping him.
After the announcement of Sirius as the Black´s heir, Regulus finally had enough. The first time he excused himself from coming back, the story had been he was going to a school summer camp, it was fairly believable, but after that every holiday he would find a new excuse. It took his parents two years to finally caught on.
—I mean…my father, Tom Riddle…— he cleared.
Narcissa frowned at hearing that, genuinely surprised this time.
—Is alright, calm down, I’ll go check on them  — she left him to go upstairs, feigning a confidence she didn’t really have but wanted to convey to him.
—oh already? — the professor lamented —. Times flies when one dives into history, Go on children, we´ll continue from this point next class, 1964 and the start of mating bans on British families.
Draco noticed his father’s reaction and thought maybe his mother was onto something after all.
—I’m sorry to hear that, I…— he started but was interrupted by a loud scream.
—I wouldn’t know
—Send me your current location
Bellatrix didn’t say anything for a moment, but her face looked distorted and gave him an strange look, like she was trying to find something in him.
Draco was a little taken aback. He knew his father enjoyed going to the games, but he, more than anything, took great pride in bragging about how much better than anybody else his son was, and he couldn’t do that if Draco was no being…well…the best.
She took a moment to scroll through the comments.
—Jesus…—Harry sighed understanding the situation —…but she seemed normal
Tom was tall, and cool, and so much like an older brother. He would bring him presents and seat with him, talk with him, and in those moment, he didn’t feel like the snake anymore, trapped in the cage.
—…This was the most different aspect of the western and eastern society — Professor Cuthbert said, babbling about the ottoman empire —. Inheritance being a huge problem in England, where legitimacy was often put into question to discredit rulers, and the conditions to fill the heir shoes were quite limiting, meanwhile in the ottoman empire every child was potentially the next sultan
—Really? —he faked confusion—. …maybe we have some misunderstanding here, Harry has always been supposed to finish his education at Hogwarts
— I think Dad was right, they are trying to force his hand — He said.
Harry looked ahead to where the girls were walking before responding.
He was startled out of his thoughts by Remus throwing the packed bills on the table, the noise resonated on the empty store.
—Money first dude, or not drugs at all
The speech was good, the little part he paid attention to at least. His father went on about the pride it had given him to see his son and heir grow up and when he was finished  Draco applauded with the rest.
Harry signed but nodded along.
—So was it really a friend situation or I just witnessed you being rejected? — Ron asked as soon I they started walking.
Draco nodded vaguely, not giving anything away.
—We are not but…since he is you know, like me, I figured
—What happened? — he asked and was surprised at hearing his own voice sounding so hoarse.
Harry stalled remembering, his uncle had been so angry at him.  Maybe this was him making good on his threat to send him to a special school, and these men were here to assess how crazy he was.
—That’s not what I asked
—Not much…just that…she didn’t know her parents either, like me
“So, what now?” Draco asked, throat tightening.

, he thought.
Harry made a snarky comment about what would happen if they lost their “star performer,” which Draco played into with ease.  For once, the atmosphere between them was warm and softened from its usual animosity.  He was so busy basking in it that he reached the double doors quite by accident and stopped, unsure how to proceed.
The devoted Slytherins had come by again, and he’d updated them on his progress.  They, in turn, had told him of the other Houses and brought him a pumpkin pastie from Hufflepuff that was to

-L.A.M.
The past two years had been utterly abysmal.  That much, he could say with absolute certainty.  He had watched his home fall into ruin, his family torn into drifting constellations of pain, and he had endured worse treatment and humiliation than he had ever experienced in his life.  But the worst part about all of this was that no matter how awful these past two years had been, they were still not the

experiments and
they’d been acting differently around each other, but he also knew there was much he didn’t know.
The pudding squished between Draco’s fingers as he ran his hand up Harry’s engorged cock. Draco pulled the cup off the tip of Harry’s dongus and squeezed a little bit of pre cum into it. He licked the inside of the pudding cup clean and began to bring his head down to Harry’s huge dick. He began by slowly licking the chocolate off the tip. Harry winced with pleasure.
“Well,” she said, “when you told us…I mean, I wasn’t sure what to expect regarding how you’d act around one another.  But now I’m seeing it’s not dissimilar from how you’ve always acted.”
"Polysyllabic? Be still my heart." Malfoy grinned. "Do you know what that actually means?"
Harry snorted. “Don’t lie, Malfoy. You’re only talking to me for my cocks.”
“Self defense?” Malfoy asked. He sounded genuinely curious.
“Oh,” said Harry, anticipating a long and awkward visit as Healer Reynolds poked and prodded and filled out the mountain of forms.
Harry watched as they made their way down the long aisle between Auror cubicles and then slipped between the massive doors that led into the briefing room. As much as he wanted to find joy in Rosemary getting dragged into whatever was happening over there—at least as much glee as she'd shown in sending him to fetch the fake cock—he couldn't quite manage it. Getting called out by name was never a good sign when it came to situations like this. And if the situation was spilling over into Apparition, there was a chance Harry himself might be at risk for getting pulled in. He turned away and headed to the kitchenette to get a kettle going for when Rosemary returned.
"My purpose in this department. Provide you tea and entertainment while you take the piss."
It was three more days, days filled with quiet since Harry was still considered active on the Cock Case, and he was
“Yeah,” Harry said. “But sometimes I’m reminded all over again.”
hoped he was done with.
Sighing a little, Harry squeezed into the crowded lift. He kept a tight hold on the box to keep the lid firmly affixed, pressed the button for the fourth floor, and—
Harry took his time making the trip down to the canteen and then back, two paper cups in hand. He stopped in the lobby to have a bit of a chat with Muriel, then took the lifts back up to Spell Damage where he nodded to the Mediwitch on duty at the desk and went down the hall to the exam room. Balancing the cups precariously in one hand, he opened the door and had just enough time to register the faint glimmer of Shield Charms before Malfoy hit the cock with a
“Sorry,” Harry said again. “But
He flung himself out of the way with a startled sound that was most definitely
Malfoy ignored him as he took up his wand to cast a few spells at the penis, and nodded to himself as the colored sparks of magic fizzled and died out. He made a few more notes on the paperwork before he snapped on a pair of gloves and picked up the penis to give it a few brisk strokes. It firmed up in his hands, and Malfoy set it down on its end, the balls drawing up closer to the shaft as they made contact with the chilly steel of the exam table. It wobbled a bit, but stayed upright looking all big, and. Perky. Very perky. Almost intimidatingly perky.
"Take the box. I'll sort out a more formal briefing once you've had a chance to compare the two… items."
“Why ask if you don’t want an answer?” Ron shrugged.
When he walked into the Atrium, he found a small crowd of witches and wizards gathered around the Fountain of Magical Brethren. And, wonderful. Lovely. Looked like the areshole leaving the cocks around was back to making political statements.
Harry finally wrangled his robes into a ball, great bloody thick Auror wool uniforms all heavy and hard to get off for
Malfoy’s cheeks went a little bit pinker, but his smile turned sly. “I’ll hold you to that. Normally I make a bloke buy me dinner before any cocks get involved, but I suppose I can make allowances for the peculiarities of the situation. I’ll settle for a drink.”
Harry gave the Vicious Cockmonster a wary glance as he drew his wand.
He skimmed down the list, until he came to the very bottom:
Prestissimo Erectus
Rosemary wasn't that bad, Harry told himself repeatedly as he carried a box of his things to the Apparition Department. She could be nice. Cheerful. Jolly. Perky. Ebullient. Chirpy. Harry grimaced and resolved to send Hermione a very sternly worded owl about the word a day calendars she insisted on giving him every Christmas.
This cock was at 10 Downing Street. Charmed to the fucking front door. Apparently they were moving on to Muggle political statements. Harry was so entirely done with all of this.
Harry deflated slightly at Malfoy's sudden capitulation. "But. Why?"
"So you
And that sounded perfect to Harry. He'd just ignore them for three hours, the problem would take care of itself, and Harry would never again utter the words 'Prestissimo Erectus' in his life. Lesson learned.
"Morning, Harry. Good morning, Rosemary."
"Which? The one I don't know where it's been, or the one that I know where it was going?"
He then proceeded to ignore the entire conversation. He didn't even care anymore. When he waved at the barman for another pint, Hermione was repeating the rant about Bartram and nepotism that she'd probably been building up to deliver in his office earlier. Letting her words wash over him, nodding in the gaps, was something he'd mastered years ago, and he concentrated on drinking his pint.
"Are you kidding?" Ron asked. "We weren't going to come anywhere near you until all the particulars of the case had been settled."
problem now. I'm off to the pub."
of all the bloody things and ended up feeling twice as irritated as he had to begin with. He drank more of his pint.
“I’m sure Granger will be over the moon,” Malfoy said dryly.
"Harry!"
"You… You…." Harry stalked over to him, raising the cock and shoving it in his face. "You."
It wasn’t until he’d made his way down to the Atrium that it occurred to him that Rosemary hadn’t mentioned what
“Scared, Potter?” Malfoy asked, his voice more teasing than mocking.
A shrug. "Polyjuice. Easy enough to get your hair, or any Auror's really. Either you're laid up at St Mungo's or I see you at a pub night."
Rosemary smirked. "Get out of here if you want me making excuses for you. And you owe me breakfast in the morning. I want something yummy."

of the penises currently in his office, as it was striped in red and blue and looked more fake than any but Sparklepenis. Harry stared at it, unwilling to touch it, waiting for the trick.
“You’re an arsehole.”
“That bad, huh?”
Spell Damage was, again, blessedly quiet, and he approached the desk quickly. "Quick sign-off. It's not a splinch, but needs a Healer's say-so."
Malfoy stepped back with each question, and Harry followed, not stopping until he had marched Malfoy back out of the room and across the hallway, right against the wall.
Malfoy hummed thoughtfully to himself as he pulled on a pair of gloves and picked it up. He gave it the usual brisk strokes that Malfoy always used to test for… well, Harry had no idea what Malfoy was testing for, other than ‘reactions.’ There was nothing in the thick stack of paperwork that asked for how readily a fake penis achieved an erection. Harry had checked.
"What do you mean, 'and'?"
Which, of course, was exactly when Malfoy walked in.
"Don't be a big baby. You'll be fine. Think of it as your welcome to the department."
but…"
It wasn’t until he stepped out into the lobby at St Mungo’s and cast a hurried Drying Charm on himself that Harry realized he’d neglected to pick up the Containment Receptacle after he’d retrieved the latest cock, and also said latest cock apparently liked him enough to go hard just from Harry touching it. Or maybe it just like traveling by Floo, some preciously optimistic corner of Harry’s brain suggested. He scowled and blocked it out.
“You,” he said faintly. “You do realize that the purpose of bringing it to me to examine is to ensure that it doesn’t actually belong to anyone, right?”
His suspicions only grew when he was called to collect another cock just a few days later, and found that it was an exact duplicate of the last.
"I. You. No." Harry felt he should add more to it, a stronger denial, but his brain rather shut down.
Ginny came to the table a bit later, bringing with her a fresh round of pints. She slipped into the seat beside Harry and greeted him with a quick bump of her shoulder against his. “How’s life in Apparition treating you so far?” she asked, nudging one of the pint glasses over to him.
"Hello there!" the Mediwitch greeted him cheerfully as the broccoli woman sat down with her paperwork and a quill.
"Merlin, Potter, do you ever shu—
There were about a million things Harry wanted to say in response to that. Starting with
"Okay. But. Why?" he asked, unable to help himself as Malfoy gave the penis another tickle, got another twitch, and used the quill to jot down a few notes on the stack of paperwork.
Just in the nick of time, too. The cock tried to follow Harry and ended up dangling over the edge of the table. It drooped a little, but rallied quickly, twitching determinedly in Harry’s direction.
"That sounds like a horrible plan. And I have no idea who Mrs Periweather is."
cock in that fucking hat.
"Alas, not mine to keep. If it wasn't for bloody Bartram, the whole lot would be off in Lost and Found by now. Only question is whether this manages to be enough of a reminder to get Kingsley breathing down my neck again."
"Potter…."
Though that might’ve been the amount of bickering they did. Honestly, at this point in his life Harry wasn’t sure he knew how to have any sort of relationship with another person that
“You wouldn’t,” Harry said.
When he finally shuffled his way to the front of the line, he didn't even have time to open his mouth before the Welcome Witch flicked a bored glance at the box in his hands and said, "Spell Damage, fourth floor."
"Poor bastards," Harry said, suddenly feeling a lot more cheerful about his own mound of unnecessary paperwork, though he did feel a little bad for Ron and Seamus. When a Member of the Wizengamot came down to MLE, everyone in the department got caught up in the ensuing storm. Drinks would probably be on Harry, next pub night. Which, even that thought cheered him because it meant that someone else's life was currently worse than his.
"No!" Harry decided then and there that his idea of keeping Malfoy quiet through snogging was the right one, and proceeded to do just that. Malfoy speaking, hell Malfoy
for it?”
“Pot, kettle,” Malfoy shot back. “I saw you watching.”
,” Harry said archly, taking a much-needed gulp of his pint. “I’m fairly sure you haven’t heard of it.”
"Exactly what I said," Malfoy told him with an impatient little frown pinching the corners of his mouth. "It's not real."
his best friend.
different. No use worrying about that yet."
." Ron's voice had a decided whine to it, which told Harry he'd had at least four pints by this point, and Hermione had likely been on a while.
His hands clenched at that thought, and he only realized then that he was still clutching the newest cock in one hand, and the box in the other.
“Not for a while. I’m on holiday for the next two weeks,” Malfoy said. “Any more penises you find before then? Someone else’s problem.”
was just too perfect, and soon they were each holding onto Rosemary's desk and gasping for air.
"Harry Potter! I'm shocked at you!" Rosemary giggled again. "What if a
"Dirt, probably? It was on the ground. You know, where it's dirty."
Harry laid it slowly, gently on the table. Not willing to jostle it in case it… did something. He didn't even know what he was doing with these cocks anymore. His life was a neverending nightmare of cocks. Big cocks, small cocks, sparkly, vibrating, and now striped.
“Mrs Periweather?” Ginny echoed.
"I'm just saying… You could take that big one with you to St Mungo's to get a sign-off, then go straight home to drop it off because you can't take a thing like that with you to Hogwarts, and no one would have to know what you got up to in the overnight."
“Very interesting!” Malfoy said gleefully, poking at it himself to no effect, before pushing it at Harry again. “Touch it again. Give it a good wank, if you’re so inclined.”
And if Harry didn't make it before Ron's pot was gone, he'd probably be stuck with the stuff that Robards brewed. Rumor had it he used water straight from the Thames. It certainly tasted like it. Harry's stomach rolled at the very thought.
A bunch of daisies sat in a vase by the Welcome Witch’s desk. As subtly as he was able, Harry sidled up, cast a discreet Duplicating Charm, and then jammed the erect cock down amongst the blossoms. Muriel was on duty again this morning, and she gave Harry a sidelong glance but otherwise didn’t pause in directing a young witch with a Venomous Tentacula tangled in her hair up to the third floor. Harry fluffed the flowers around the CopyCock to hide it as much as possible, nodded good morning to Muriel, and walked to the lifts.
He frowned, picking up the box and wandering to the lift, stepping on and then off again automatically when it reached Level 2.
“Don’t mention it,” Harry said, fervently meaning just that. Offering to fetch tea for Malfoy, and Malfoy acting grateful for it. It was bizarre enough to make his head explode.
Everything gave Malfoy the advantage though, which Harry was feeling heartily sick of, so he simply entered the room to the right, looking around at the dark wood and books and contemplating hexing the lot.
"Quick you said? Right, go to room 3 and I'll send someone in."
After a short detour for a nice bracing cuppa, Harry set the box in the middle of his desk and closed his office door very firmly. He took a sip, then another sip, then decided it’d be best to get this over with. Dawdling only prolonged his misery. Harry set his mug aside and opened up the box. Removed the glossy instruction card and set it aside as well. Then with a swish of his wand he lifted the cock from its cushioning and levitated it gently to sit on the edge of his desk beside the other cock he’d found.
“I…don’t know what that means,” Ron said, glancing over at Hermione, who shrugged.
The new penis waiting for Harry at King's Cross a week later looked different than the previous seven. It looked different from
"And you didn't put…" Ron leaned in, dropping his voice to a loud whisper. "You didn't put
"You. I can't believe you. After everything, I can't believe you sent me
Admitting his ignorance seemed to mollify Malfoy somewhat. “Well, I suggest when you get back you submit this Containment Receptacle for examination. Whatever blithering idiot,” And here he aimed another sharp look at Harry which was, frankly, uncalled for, “poked a bunch of holes in this may have damaged the charmwork.”
Well, he’d just have to use what he had.
“The frightening part is,” Malfoy said after considering that for a moment. “I’ve no idea if you’re joking or not.”
Harry couldn’t imagine it being worse than the last, but he expected he’d be able to picture it quite vividly by the end of the day.
? And
It felt like a sign. A great big flashing neon sign that today was going to be
Malfoy cackled and turned away to snap on a pair of gloves. “Honestly, Potter. It’s a fake cock. It hasn’t got feelings, you know.” He adjusted the snug cuffs around his wrist. “And while we’re at it, nor has it got ears. I promise you it neither knows nor cares what I say about. I mean, I understand that you’re the Saviour and all, and you probably can’t help yourself rushing to defend anything you feel could use your aid, no matter how small or helpless—”
“Oh, right. And Rosemary was in earlier looking for you.”
The throbbing behind Harry’s forehead promptly doubled at the mere thought. He bit back a sigh. "Yes, sir."
“Anyhow,” she said, hefting the box and balancing it on one hip to give Harry’s arm a pat with her free hand. “Looks like you’re back to boring Aurorwork, now. When I dropped off the paperwork to transfer the case, Kingsley mentioned he was putting you with Ron.”
He took the penis and the paperwork and returned them to the Ministry feeling strangely disappointed.
"Centuries," Rosemary repeated, and Harry didn't think it was just his imagination that she sounded gleeful about it.
For a long moment, Harry stared dumbly at it, his brain still desperately trying to process what the fuck had just happened. And then the sound of a door opening down the hall kicked him into action. He scrambled into the hall and snatched up the cock and all but threw it back into the exam room. He didn’t mean to aim it at Malfoy but Malfoy caught it on what seemed to be pure blind instinct so it was probably okay, no harm done to either Malfoy or the cock, and Harry hurled himself into the exam room after it and slammed the door behind him.
"Yeah, because that's so much more subtle. I'll stick with the naked cocks, thanks. I'm hoping they scare Mrs Periweather off when she comes by on Tuesday."
, and mushrooms sprouting from their hair.
“He’s assisting with an emergency case down in Potions and Plant Poisoning,” Healer Reynolds said gruffly when Harry asked about it.
Draco stuttered, kicking himself at how truly fucking weak he sounded. In front of
drinks.
Though he hadn’t remembered it the next morning, he had dreamed, a dream that awoke him with a strange emptiness that hadn’t left him for the rest of the day.
you, Draco, that you aren’t my first unruly client, so this little rebellious act of yours doesn’t work on me. Your mother is the one that signs my paychecks and it is
He wasn’t ashamed of that. He
She remembered how he used to react to them, almost cowering away when either Ron or her got too close.
“I better go feed the horses.”
“Mrs Granger mentioned you’ve been feeling unwell recently, do you know what could have caused that?”
It was a long and torturous wait before Draco’s steps were heard once again, and Harry’s mouth went dry when the omega emerged into his eye line.
“It’s not your fault.”
“Listen here, kid, I understand you’re upset, but I will not have you treating me with disrespect. I am your mentor–
“You’ve gone and torn yourself, you little idiot.”
It was despicable, and no matter how set in their ways the elite of the wizarding world were, what the Omega’s parents had done to him was just plain
“But mine is bigger.”
“What is this? One of Ron’s famous recipes?”
Sorry its been so long, I've been in such a funk lately and I haven't been able to write anything. At all. Nada.
“Are you alright? You suddenly look quite poorly…”
Ron said, the smile on his face not reaching his eyes. Draco didn’t seem to notice, just smiled back and got to work mashing the potatoes by hand. He didn’t even complain anymore about having to do certain things the ‘muggle way’, he just went a did it without a second thought.
Draco chuckled, bumping him playfully with his hip when Blaise didn’t move away.
That was the worst of it all, that unsheathed feeling of something other than terror cutting through his defences. It made him feel dirty…
”It’s not! It’s n-not ok!”
She couldn’t even dare to imagine what could happen if the boy was left in the hands of someone with bad intentions… all it would take was the wrong person to release enough pheromones and the boy would be at their mercy.
Green eyes.
He bared his neck without a second thought, his heart hammering in his chest when Harry let out an approving grunt. The alpha took the offer, pushing his nose into his neck and sucking in another deep breath.
“Oh, leave him alone, Ron, I’m sure he just wants some space. He’ll come out when he’s ready.”
Ron asked, finally capturing the Omega’s full attention. Draco blushed then, clasping his raised hand into a tight fist and dropping it to his side.
When Draco finally raised his head, Harry had expected to see pretty tears marking his rose-blushed cheeks… but… he didn’t expect to see the look of pure contempt etched across the boy's features instead.
Ron chuckled, his laugh slowly dying when Draco nodded absently and raised his hand, muttering something under his breath as two fresh eggs floated up from out of the carton and hovered over to Ron’s waiting hands.
Eventually they helped him to his room, Hermione tucking him in while Ron ducked out momentarily to fetch some peppermint tea to bring back for the unusually quiet Omega.
“You are a little warm… I might just make you a potion, just to be on the safe side of things.”
“I won’t go.”
, it’s not bad news.”
Harry scanned the parlour, noting the muted colours of once-grand furniture that had been left to slowly wither and fade.
He couldn’t concentrate, his head felt as if it had been stuffed with cotton, all he could focus on was the heat of the fingers still clawing possessively over his body. It wasn’t until he felt himself being moved that the outside world finally came crashing in.
At first, he thought it was Ron or Hermione making their way into the kitchen for a drink of water… but the sound of the footsteps weren’t familiar at all, too heavy to be the witch… too even to be the Beta’s.
He felt good. Warm.
A cold chill settled at the base of Draco’s spine when he heard the sound of a zipper being yanked down, and he laid there frozen in fear when Harry pushed himself up on his feet and stood tall over him, pulling out his
“Thank you for the meal.”
Draco sighed, patting Harry’s cheek before pulling away and moving towards the stairs, not a second glance to the alpha left frozen behind him.
To show them that he wasn’t so completely…
“My daughter, Rose, is around your age, she graduated Hogwarts a few years back and she’s now training to be an Alchemist. I heard that that is an interest of yours as well, Draco?”
”The ingredients… they aren’t just used to induce
“Wouldn’t have guessed it, would you? Adds that real kick.”
Harry warned, trying to keep his tone civil as he watched the omega hum in thought.
Draco hissed, screwing his eyes shut when he felt the Alpha shift, pressing his cock flush against him as he did. Something inside Draco’s belly fluttered.
Right as the stinging grip of panic had started to wrap around his throat... he heard it…
Ron started, only for Draco to raise his head again and catch him in a steady look.
Before she could finish, Draco chimed in, his eyes narrowing as her words brought forth some questions of his own.
He was bonded, his soul tied with another... and his body yearned for an Alpha that
With one last sweet smile, she turned on her heels and disappeared down the hall.
Draco asked, stabbing his fork through the creamy pasta before he brought it to his mouth, his eyebrows raising when the taste hit him.
Draco scoffed, the corner of his plump lips twitching up in a sneer.
Draco murmured, dropping his eyes to his hands so he didn’t have to see her frown again.
Draco let out a strangled gasp when the Alpha buried his face between the milky white globes, hot tongue already lapping at Draco’s clenching hole, tasting the pure nectar that was his slick.
“Put your plate up please.”
The Alpha’s nostrils flared as he ripped his eyes away from the sight, instead, focusing on the boy’s pale eyes, still narrowed at him, framed by a fanning of thick eyelashes that made the little brat look much too innocent for the contemptuous glare he was aiming at him.
“Huh? Oh, ah, no, I don’t think so.”
Harry spat, no humour in his voice at all, his wild eyes still blazing. He looked
Ron finished, raising his arms wide in show before he dropped them and casually shoved his hands into his pockets.
“You’re going to leave this house, little Malfoy. You’re going to go back to daddy and mummy where you belong and leave my friends out of whatever little fucked up shit show this is.”
“You don’t look happy to see me.”
I really didn't expect this story to turn out to be such a slow burn, but I promise, more Harry and Draco in the next chapter. Let the games begin xx
orders that I follow, not yours. She has left you in my capable hands, so you will listen to me now and you will listen well.”
Draco’s smile grew when Ron continued to list off ingredients, a strange flush travelling up his collar as he followed the older man into the house, with the weight of an arm resting comfortably across his shoulders...
I hope you all had a lovely weekend! Enjoy 😘
Trust his parents to throw a party on the same day they were sending him away.
To tell or not to tell? It wasn’t even a question anymore.
Draco asked, avoiding the incensed glare from the Beta.
The stranger didn’t mean
Time dragged on painfully slow, and when the twenty minutes were finally up, Draco’s stomach was practically ready to eat itself.
“Mhm, you really did, and it looks like it’s done you a world of good, too, thank Merlin.”
The witch giggled, petting him fondly before commanding him to sit over in the corner of the room. He did, his tail drooping a fraction as he followed the orders.
, Draco, are you alright? Oh, Merlin, I didn’t mean to–“
Draco whispered, smiling almost sadly down at the dog whose eyes continued to watch him quietly.
He stifled his own surprised smile, instead, pressing his lips into a thin line.
, doesn’t that just sound so delicious?”
It was only really when the adrenaline finally stopped coursing through his system and the heavy hand of sleep threatened to pull him under, did he
It didn’t take more than a few steps to find an array of oddly shaped holes in the wall, and he scowled to himself as he let the well-worn floorboards carry him into an equally unimpressive kitchen. Before Harry could turn his nose up at the rest of the house, a voice rang out to his far left, coming from what he supposed was the loungeroom.
“It’s good to have you back, kid.”
When there was no more food to bring, Ron, at last, came back with a cooling pad, awkwardly handing it to Draco with a kind smile.
Draco came in shortly after, a cheery smile curling his rose-blushed lips as he walked up to Harry and handed him his drink, taking a small sip of his own.
Forgive me for taking so long but thank you so much for those of you who stuck around and continued to encourage me with your lovely comments, they honestly helped so much with this chapter 🥺♥️
He couldn’t say a word, and somehow Harry had known that.
“I’m sorry about Ron, I know he seems a little prickly, but once you both get to know each other I’m sure you will get along just fine.”
Even the stubborn had to
Borsk grunted, pulling open his briefcase and swiftly uncorking the stopper of a moss-green potion bottle.
“What do you mean, ‘

He asked incredulously, shoving in another mouthful and savouring the taste as he chewed.

Draco grinned, his hands immediately running through the beasts fur, groaning when the dog licked a slobbery stripe across his cheek.
The boy hissed, the narrowing of his eyes almost masking the deep-rooted fear swimming there.
need of another babysitter, Mr Potter. I’m not a child.”
, Draco had been sent to his room for the next two nights, until his father had come in with his belt on the third… On the fourth night he had been told that they were sending him away… for his own protection... and that was when one nightmare had shifted into another.
Harry sighed, leaving to grab himself a second portion.
“I’m not playing around here, Draco, this is your final warning. Say thank you and we can both sit down and enjoy a hot breakfast.”
“You’re an Omega, yes?”
“It’s just orange juice. Nothing like a little vitamin C to get the muggle juices flowing.”
Draco gasped out, scrambling away when Harry finally released him. Draco crawled forward before collapsing, sobbing into the ground as he clutched at his stomach and gagged. Nothing came out, and the nausea that clawed at his stomach refused to fade.
As the night rolled on, Draco was getting more and more annoyed, he couldn’t put his finger on exactly
Everything was
The days before Harry had befriended Ron and Hermione had been his darkest in the school, filled with the scentless torment that had been Lucius Malfoy.
“I w-wouldn’t do t-that, I— please, please, you d-don't, I wouldn’t…”
Draco stepped out on uneasy legs, clothes forgotten on the shower floor, a towel wrapped around his body.
“I’ll get used to it.”
… made him think of—
I would have liked to edit it a little more, but screw it, happy Easter to those who celebrate, and a happy weekend to those who don’t xxx
the next morning to see Draco’s smiling face greet him as he entered the kitchen, dressed in an oversized cream knit-sweater that went to his thighs, only revealing a hint of the black silken boxers underneath.
Draco said quietly, pressing his rose-blushed lips into a thin line as he stared the Alpha down.
fault, all of it. Draco hated him, hated his very existence— hated everything about him!
the fuck just happened?
Draco had never seen another man’s genitals before, only his own flaccid cock that he had peered at sometimes in the shower, itching to touch himself out of sheer curiosity to see how it felt, but never ever indulging the thought.
Draco whined, his pale eyes catching Hermione long enough to flutter his eyelashes. He didn’t miss the fact that he had called this place his
“You’re hard.”
“There’s just something so delicious about the combination of golden syrup and butter, don’t you think?”
“Get o-off me!”
His skin was burning by the time he turned the water off, the inside of his thighs scrubbed raw and his usual pallid complexion now a blushing pink.
Only, he looked different… his dark hair, usually swept back and neatly styled, was unkempt and tousled, his face stubbled and unshaven, eyes bloodshot.
That question rang out in Draco’s head, making him suck in a whimpered breath.

Hermione sang, pulling him out a chair with a sunny smile before placing a heaped plate of bacon and eggs in front of him.
from this infuriating boy.
“No, it won’t take too long.”
... hollow.
Draco cried, almost pleading with Ron through his tears, his body quivering as he sobbed.
“It’s good, trust me, I was sceptical too but it’s Hermione’s favourite.”
He murmured, turning back to the door and grasping the handle before he paused.
“Well, it’s good to have some young blood back in the house!”
“Draco.”
Draco asked, a hand coming up to rest under his chin, his attention now fully on the Beta. Ron’s smile faltered a little as he let out a small sigh.
He smiled reassuringly, gently patting the Omega’s foot before he left the room.
Hermione sighed, the sound not masking her amused smile.
Harry pushed that thought away as quickly as it had come.
“Yes, dear?”
“I had to, mother! He tried to-“

It was an inside joke, the muggle training. Ron had made it one of Draco’s chores to put all the groceries away by hand, something about ‘learning to do things without magic’. Draco thought it was rubbish, what kind of idiotic contrast was it to make him study magic 8 hours a day, only to then tell him how he could go about
