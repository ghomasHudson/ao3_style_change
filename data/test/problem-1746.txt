“Although,” Potter said, smirking, “the restricted section was always a highlight of the Hogwarts library.”
From the doorway, Andromeda nodded, something unspoken passing between them.
“I’m not.” Harry looked up to find Malfoy regarding him curiously.
“Malfoy, don’t.” Harry could feel humiliation sneak past his anger, twisting into the hurt brought on by the truth in Malfoy’s words.
Ever the warm welcome, there were bruising hugs, familiar claps on the shoulder and Harry felt himself relax as he made his way into the arms of his family.
Oh yes, he was definitely firing him now, no question about that.
“She’s not coping, is she Potter?” Harry stiffened. “Is that why you’ve been so irritable, Potty?”
Potter looked taken aback. “You really were a brat,” he said gently.
“Is it the impossible size or your ego, Potter? The reminder of the Dark lord, emblazoned like  a beacon into the very skin of your thick forehead?”
“Ah so you’ve heard of them? Whatever it’s called, I’d rather like to try one myself.”
Draco shook his head, “I have a duty to my customers.”
Feeling brave, Draco squeezed his hand. “This is just your way of bribing me into closing shop early,” he accused with a coy smile, “isn’t it?”
Harry swallowed, wincing at the mention of his partner. Their relationship had turned stale months ago. Ginny was his best friend but sometimes he thought that was all she was to him. Sometimes he thought that was all she wanted to be. However, he felt about Ginny, what Kingsley had said was true. No matter how much he wanted to make the world a better place, Harry was neglecting his family. They were too important to him.
Potter was watching the scene unfolding before him with a vulgar look of amusement.
“She wanted to buy a book about wizards.” He let his hands drop to his sides with a slap, looked away. “That was all.”
“Potter,” Draco said, a little harshly, but he was being rather ridiculous, “you just told me that the—Mrs Weasley saw you as a son. That was before your relationship with Ginny started, am I correct?”
“I can look after myself. You’re not a babysitter.”
Draco almost regretted having to close up the library. It meant having to say goodbye.
(Also if you noticed, yes, pun definitely intended.)
"How else would I find out about your vinyl collection?"
Draco heard him apparate away, no doubt with a little wave. He closed the door behind him as soon as he could, breathing a sigh of belief. He leant his head back against the door and groaned.
Cue the angsty chapter. Not to spoil anything, but don't worry, it doesn't last forever.
“Ginny,” Harry moved around, taking her into his arms, “it’s ok. We’re ok.”
“If you try to tell me that one more time, I swear I’ll—”
“Oh,” Harry said, like he hadn't just watched them both leave, “and how was that?”
“Mmm,” Harry said, “but you get to see my cool scar.”
“No really,” Draco stared at his hands, “I never knew. I just thought—”
Not his mother’s eyes, like everybody said, these were Harry’s eyes.
Draco cleared his throat and Potter spun around to face him. His shoulders visibly relaxed when he realised the new arrival was only Draco.
Harry stared at the stern woman standing in the doorway. The woman who’d sacrificed her familial status for love. He smiled.
Draco shrugged. “I like books.” He began to walk towards the entrance. “Come on,” he said.
“Oh,” she said, “oh I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to pry. Ronald says I sometimes—”
“Could you please just go?”
The girl nodded. “Thanks,” she said, “I’ll have a look.”
Potter’s deep green eyes told Draco he didn’t. He nodded slowly, hands slipping away from Potter’s grasp.
“I didn’t expect you to be here,” Harry admitted, swallowing. He’d thought she’d be at the Burrow.
Draco visibly relaxed, releasing a shaky breath. “Um,” he said, “I’m not sure I can direct you to any specifically.” He’d never been a fan of books like that. They all tended to be hilariously inaccurate, all with the same stereotypical tropes and pointy hats. Though, thinking now of Professor McGonagall, perhaps the hats weren’t too far off reality.
“Hmm?”
“What was that?” he asked, voice soft. “Didn’t catch it.”
“Uh…” Harry hadn’t a clue. “I mean—”
“That what?” Harry interrupted. “That I lived in a manor like you? Not all of us were that privileged Draco.”
“I believe we may have already established that, yes.” Harry looked as if he’d just walked in on Granger snogging Weasel. Come to think of it, he probably had at some point.
The pair were rescued from what would’ve been an uncomfortable silence by the rattle of the bell as a customer entered the library. She walked over to Draco’s place at the front desk, smiling brightly. Potter slid down from the countertop, instead leaning against the back of Draco’s chair, arms folded.
“…I’m sorry,” said the girl from before, sliding a smooth looking fantasy novel across the countertop. Must be a new copy, Draco thought absently. “Is this a bad time?”
“Missed you too.” Harry ruffled his Godson’s hair.
“I was trying to pay you a compliment, you arrogant arse.” He nudged Draco and they both laughed. “Thank you though,” Harry said, “for telling me to go. I wouldn’t have done, if you hadn’t, you know. You helped me, more than you know.”
He had to get a hold of himself. He couldn't be crushing on the man who lived, not anymore, that was ridiculous, not to mention unwanted. Potter would probably gag if he ever found the true nature of Draco Malfoy's feelings.
“Yeah,” Harry said, somewhat awkwardly, “I guess…it’s complicated. But he’s nothing like when we knew him before. I think he’s changed a lot.”
George was the first to greet him; he’d started hugging a lot more after the war, and he clapped Harry rather heartily on the back. Molly had been rather perturbed when George had first dyed his hair a dark, yet still noticeable purple, but she’d quickly let the matter drop when George had been able to look at his reflection again. His smile was still the same as it used to be, but there was now a haunted look deep within his eyes and not everyone could stomach holding his gaze for very long. Still, he’d managed to retain his mischievous streak and Harry was certain it’s what Fred would’ve wanted.
He shouldn’t be lying to Potter like this, but Draco Malfoy was selfish, and he wanted Harry’s company. He’d have to lie to him for now, though it wasn’t really lying. It was more not telling him, so Draco supposed, maybe it wasn’t too bad.
“Keesey hates to interrupt, Sir, but this is the third letter this week,” her eyes were widened as if delivering news of the gravest kind, “Keesey has to ask, Sir, when will Mister Potter be replying to his family?”
Draco forced an uneasy smile, waiting until she’d disappeared out of view before he doubled over, gasping. He stood to his full height, staring down at his hand. It was shaking, ever so slightly, but noticeably nonetheless.
Keesey looked conflicted but she nodded all the same, curtseying before she whizzed away to wherever it was she liked to spend her time when she wasn’t dusting cobwebs from the manor.
Draco shrugged, attempting to keep his expression blank, though really he was desperate to smile. “I'm merely stating the obvious.”
She held out the letter for Draco to accept. It was addressed to him in a practical, swooping hand.
Draco scowled. “I’m not a bloody Thestral, Potter,” he said, even as his knees buckled, barely caught by Harry.
Kingsley raised his brows but didn’t say anything more. “Harry, he’s…he’s not doing well. He needs someone there, making sure he isn’t targeted.”
He opened one eye, slowly, then the other. He’d tried to help last time, but he’d tried using magic and it hadn’t gone well. He wanted to learn this way, Harry’s way.
I'm still alive! I'm so sorry this chapter's so late! My sibling gave me COVID and I was super sick. BUT I'm back now! And, I have new inspiration and should be back to a normal posting schedule.
He was never the boy who lived. He was the boy who hoped. That was how they’d defeated Voldemort, because they had hope. The Prophet never failed to miss that from their articles.
Draco rolled his eyes. “She has a name!” he called back. “And she was tidying them up, you imbecile.”
“Maybe you should get someone else.”
“Oh,” Harry said, scratching the back of his neck, “right.” He looked around him, trying to find, to be honest Draco wasn’t sure what he was trying to find. Harry’s cheeks were reddening fast, and he was knocking papers out of the way in his haste to find whatever he was looking for.
“Uncle Harry?” His eyes snapped open at Teddy’s voice. Despite himself, he smiled.
“Well?” Malfoy said, putting down the paper with a huff.
He watched as Potter’s green eyes fixated upon nothing. “I never liked the fame you know,” he said quietly, “you always had that wrong. I hated it.”
Draco’s throat bobbed. He could feel it, tight under the skin of his throat.
He and Draco, they could never escape what they were to one another. Now more than ever, that they were talking, actually getting to know each other. Now that he knew Draco might feel the same way as he did.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I was kind of surprised actually,” Harry said, “at dinner, when you said it was about time we settled things.”
Her hair was still kept in a familiar classy bob, though one side was longer than the other. She leant against the doorframe, grinning, snakelike. Predatory.
“I don’t,” Harry said, too quickly. He didn’t.
“Harry, do you love her? Do you love Ginny?”
“Ted,” he said, swallowed, “do you, would you like it if I called you, she? We could try it, to see how it feels?”
“Uhh,” Harry started, “I think maybe Malfoy should tell you that himself.”
“What is?”
Potter tilted his head, looking thoughtful. He smiled with amusement, his brows knitting together in a slight frown. Draco didn’t like that look at all.
“Sometimes,” he worried his lip, “sometimes I don’t feel like a boy.”
When he’d seen Potter in his office, he was struck by the way that he’d grown into his physique. He hadn’t grown
“You could’ve at least sent a letter!” There we go. “All I knew was that you’d apparated off somewhere, drunk, to Merlin only knows where, and—” she paused, anger fading into something thoughtful, “where did you go?”
Draco nodded. “I know that now,” he whispered.
“I’d hoped you might come back here,” she said, “we thought you’d maybe go to the Burrow, but when you didn’t, well, home seemed a likely option.”
“I felt like me,” Teddy said. Harry squeezed him.
Malfoy paused, turned back to look at him with a tired smile. “Thank you,” he said, and Harry knew that he meant it.
Hermione had been annoyed. It wasn’t really unexpected. She’d wrapped him up in her arms and then proceeded to join Molly in her fussing, though Hermione hadn’t been quite so happy to see him. Ron had managed to calm her down but not before she’d both insulted and told him how much they all needed him in the most Hermione way possible.
Sobered, he released Harry’s grip and cleared his throat, wiping his palm against his waistcoat. When he looked up, Harry was fixing him with a melting smile and Draco just about puddled, there and then.
Potter actually smiled. Draco wondered if he was mocking him and stiffened noticeably.
Though Harry did feel guilty about his useless godparenting, amongst other things, sitting next to Teddy as the kid swung his legs back and forth on the couch, Harry was struck by how peaceful it all seemed. Maybe not everything was as bad as he’d imagined.
Draco had always wanted that handshake with Potter, but now, holding his hand, there was nothing that could have prepared him for how easily their fingers slotted together.
“Oh?” Harry said with a snarl, his anger bubbling over. “And why’s that?” He shouldn’t be letting Malfoy get to him, but he was being deliberately antagonising.
“What?” Draco snapped.
Draco jumped as Potter placed a soft hand upon his wrist. “You were just a child. You didn’t understand what you were doing.”
“Ah,” said Pansy, “yes, of course.” Some kind of non-verbal communication passed between the two, and Harry stared as Pansy squinted her eyes in varying different ways. Eventually Draco sighed, nodded, sighed. He waved his hand flippantly and Pansy grinned in triumph. Clearly, she’d won whatever staring contest they’d been having. “Blaise, we’re leaving!” Pansy called, “Draco’s found his new muse.”
“Why do you care?”
“Ha,” he heard from over by the sink, “made you yawn.”
Draco glanced Harry’s way where he was trying very hard to clean his glasses, inspecting the narrow frames intently. A difficult task to accomplish when you’re practically blind without them.
He squeezed his eyes shut, cursing himself and apparated the both of them.
“Your itinerary. Potter.” Draco rolled his eyes. “You’re going to need to know what I’m doing aren’t you?”
Malfoy rolled his eyes, sighing. “What did you find? I’ve been sitting here for hours.”
“We all thought you were.” Harry’s comment should’ve stung, and it would’ve done some time before. He probably would’ve snapped back with a decidedly more venomous retort, but Harry’s expression was soft, and Draco found himself chuckling instead.
“I would've pegged you for more of a
“I—” he could lie, of course he could, but they’d been lying to each other for too long now. He couldn’t keep doing it. “Yes, ‘course I’m hurt. You hurt me so much Gin. You’d barely speak to me, barely look at me, when we were together.”  It used to make him angry, but only the kind of angry that bloomed from pain and he’d bury it down, pretending everything was as fine as the tabloids claimed. He sighed. “Yes, sure I’m hurt but, neither of us acted how we should’ve done. I don’t hate you for it, if that’s what you’re worried about. Though, it might take a while for me to reach where we were before all this.”
Draco was at a loss for words. What was he supposed to say to that? He’d always thought Potter to be an arrogant bastard. Perhaps, maybe…maybe he’d been mistaken after all. It wasn’t as if he’d always been right before.
He led them down a side road aligned with trees, a sprinkling of autumn leaves coating the pathway.  “Just checking,” Potter said, “we
“I think the Ministry is rather preoccupied with keeping me under surveillance at all times by the famous Harry Potter,” Malfoy sneered
As I said, it's a bit plot-heavy, so sorry about that! Needs must!
Kingsley sighed, standing to his feet. Harry’s eyes narrowed as he followed Shacklebolt’s movements. Kingsley shrugged. “You have to understand…with his family history—”
Harry nodded. “Well, yes, but—”
He was well aware that he was staring at Malfoy with an idiotic grin, but he felt like he deserved it; he deserved to be happy.
All in all, it was nothing like Harry had thought it would be.
I couldn't quite make myself happy with it, but I think it's because I've had to split it up because it just grew too long otherwise. So, let me know what you think about it.
She pulled back with a smile, her eyes crinkling just a little, at the corners. “How are you Harry?” her brow furrowed slightly. “You look tired.”
Keesy smiled brightly and scurried out of the room, on her way to see to Harry’s order.
“I never understood the point of those enchantments. They never last long and take forever to cast.” He flicked Harry’s mug with his nails. The following clink was sharp.
“I’m an ex-Death Eater,” Malfoy said bitterly, “of course I’m under threat.”
His loneliness was pathetic, he knew that, but he couldn’t help it. Emotion was the one thing he’d never quite been able to force down, no matter how hard his Father pressured him to do so.
Potter nodded slowly. “I suppose we were both arseholes in Hogwarts,” he said with a sniff. Draco huffed a laugh.
“I was going to say supremely irritating, but yes, I suppose that works just as well.”
“Sir?” a squeaky voice called out from behind him. Draco looked round to find his house-elf, Keesy, anxiously staring up at him in the doorway with her large blue eyes. He smiled softly, crouching down so that he was eye-level with her.
“I’m sorry?”
Malfoy swallowed. “I…I uh,” he cleared his throat, “believe you me, Potter, you’re the last person I’d want round my house.”
Also, I always got the sense that Harry was uncomfortable around house-elves, not in a cruel way but I wanted to touch on it a little.
“Of course,” Draco said, then wished he hadn’t. His voice had sounded so soft, it was almost sickening. There was no way Harry couldn’t be able to see right through him. Draco shook himself; this wasn’t about that, about him. This needed focus.
He thought of the boy he once was, how he’d spent so much time concerned over what people would think, of pureblood ideals, Lucius’s ideals that he’d severed bonds between people he hadn’t even met. He loved Pansy, Blaise too, he always would, but he’d selected them based on lineage, because of how he thought people would look at him.
Hermione could be overbearing, yes, and there were certain points where Harry wished, today even, that she'd just leave him alone. But he needed her, just as she needed him, and when Ron wrapped his arms around the both of them and told Harry that they'd always be best mates, he remembered that they all did. They all needed each other.
Harry thought about it, considered telling her. But he shook his head. He couldn’t be sure. “No,” he said, “not yet.” 'Yet' was the keyword here.
“No,” Draco agreed, “you shouldn’t have.” In his peripheral, he saw Harry flinch. “But I’m glad you did,” Draco whispered.
“I’m not touching your sweaty palm.” Harry frowned, wiping his hand against his trousers and extending it once again. He waved his fingers, beckoning to Draco. Defeated, but sort of in a good way, Draco reluctantly rose to his feet, placing his hand in Potter’s.
Draco smiled, drained the last of what was in his glass.  “You know there’s no one else Potter.” Draco looked tired, so incredibly tired.
(See the end of the chapter for
The last point was strange. It’d been crossed out twice, unusual for Malfoy, and was written in a different type of ink – it was darker than the other.
He would think about Draco after he sorted everything out with Ginny. There was no time for that now, no matter how he…felt. God.
“No one wants to employ a former death eater Potter,” he said quietly, as if reading his thoughts.
Harry smiled. He nodded, once. “Can I borrow some pyjamas?” he asked.
Probably not, Draco decided. He’d never been one to display a good set of manners.
Harry forced a strained laugh. They should be enemies, him and Malfoy. Maybe Harry had been enchanted.
Harry entwined his fingers together, fidgeting. “So, Keesy?” he blurted. Draco was only half right. Of course, Harry had questions, but that wasn’t why he’d been staring.
When he finally arrived home, Harry was met with a heavy curtain of dull silence. They were currently looking after Teddy, just for a few days, whilst Andromeda took some time to herself. Even with Teddy there, however, the house felt drab and impossibly empty. Ginny ghosted through the halls, an empty reflection of the woman Harry had once fallen in love with.
Ginny huffed a breath and rushed towards him, throwing her arms around his neck. He let out a little ‘oof’ sound, but his arms relaxed around her, squeezing her back.
“No offence,” Harry said still hovering in front of him, “but you don’t look fine.” He tried a small smile and Draco snorted, pressing fingers to his forehead.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yourself?” Draco
Draco huffed again, but he didn’t say anything more. Realistically, he knew Harry was right. It was just embarrassing, and he’d always been told not to appear weak. Gave people an advantage over you, that’s what Lucious always said.
Draco shot him a quizzical look.
“Why?”
Harry narrowed his eyes, pushing his cup away from him. “No, actually.” He smiled sweetly. “I don’t really need to, you know.”
“—but surely you’ve grown to move past that.” Harry looked as if he’d been slapped.
Malfoy manor sent shivers running down Harry’s spine. He’d promised himself he’d never come back there – too many unpleasant memories. Unpleasant didn’t really cover it, if he were being perfectly honest. ‘Unpleasant’ was better than the truth.
Teddy’s face brightened, smile exploding. “If that would be ok.”
“Hey Gin.”
He was startled from his thoughts when Ron slapped him on the side of his arm, grinning like a maniac. “Hey mate, it’s been too long.”
Draco used his hand to gesture around the room with s sweep of his hand. “So,” he said, “what do you think?” He could scarcely believe that he was asking for Potter’s opinion.
Malfoy took him to a room he hadn’t seen. Harry wondered if it was on purpose.
Draco arched a brow. That had him genuinely curious. “I never did manage to find out what happened to you all those years. I heard rumours, of course, but I could never find a way of making sure they were true.”
It’d been the first time in so long that he’d been able to laugh without everything looming over him, without feeling trapped. He felt like the chains had been released; he could breathe again.
Malfoy’s brows creased slightly, he regarded Harry with a strange look. “Alright,” he said. Harry couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Did Malfoy just give up without a fight? If Harry couldn’t see it before, there was no doubt in his mind now that something was wrong.
Draco felt his cheeks heat, a combination of shame and hope. “I said I’m fine,” he tried to shake Harry off.
“Yup,” Harry said, “yep, it is.” He grinned. “We’re closing up early. Doctor’s orders.”
Harry expected Draco to offer his arm.
why you hired me, isn’t it?”
“What is it?” He searched Malfoy’s pale features, somehow even paler than usual. “Malfoy, what’s wrong?”
“A…leaf.” Did he just say he was good at lying?
“Right…” Potter said, “and necromancy wouldn’t have freaked people out.”
The Carbonara was delicious, a little burnt in places, Draco’s fault, but delicious. The sauce had been creamy, packed with flavour, and there was a different feel to it, something to do with having made it himself. Or having helped make it.
Harry stared down at his coffee-stained shirt. “Can’t it wait—”
Malfoy frowned. “Dinner can wait for a while,” he said.
“Do you think,” he started, but cut himself off. Harry checked behind his shoulder, small smile, arched eyebrow.
He was currently leaning across the reception desk, a stupid smile spread over his lips as he watched Malfoy help a young child find their favourite book. He looked almost ethereal with his silver, thin-framed, round glasses and sharp suit. Harry had never felt this easy with Ginny. There was always something missing.
“It’s practically midnight.”
Potter chuckled. “What about that time in first year? You got as all sent to the dark forest, remember?”
Hope you enjoyed it, please let me know what you think. I'm a simple writer, comments really help me keep going.
“Hey,” The brunet said, peering into his eyes and drew in a shaky breath before he said, “It’s going to hurt, but in the end – It’ll be okay. We fall, we break and we mourn. Yet, we go on. We possess the ability to carry on, with or without the missing pieces.”
Draco gave him a soft nod, and placed the book on the side-table and walked into the kitchen. He mused through the kitchen cabinets, and set out a cup and saucer. He closed his eyes, frowning in confusion. Harry must’ve been insanely distracted or he wouldn’t have called him ‘Malfoy’.
“I want it,” Draco whispered with the venom laced in the voice, eyes fixed on the artifact, the corner of the mouth curling into a sneer. His fingers flexed. “only for a minute –”
He softened. The moonlight was dancing on the pale skin, and falling on the platinum blond hair. The soft snores and the sound of the waves silenced the whispers in his own head. “Night, Tinkerbell.”
The silence was comfortable, yet he had the stirring guilt in his chest. Out of all the things he had in mind, feeling guilty for the harsh words he had uttered wasn't one of them. Not if he had 'uttered' the hurtful words to Draco Lucius Malfoy.
Malfoy had a smile on his lips, and he raised the cup of tea to his lips to hide it. He held the cup in his hand, savouring the warms for a while. “Earl grey?”
The silence returned, yet it was a comfortable one. He couldn’t find the right thing to say – words had evaporated out of his mind – what could one say when their arch-nemesis shares one of their most treasured and happiest memories of when they were eleven with them?
"Yes, of course, now I'll find Gin and irritate her for a while - fifteen minutes only, Potter."
With a soft nod, Malfoy rushed out of the room and closed the door. He slipped into a plain black sweater and glanced at the easel – The painting of a sky was replaced with a blank canvas.
Why, indeed. The two words echoed in his mind: ‘
Draco’s nose wrinkled upward and a small frown creased the forehead. “Your saviour complex –” He shifted in place with a slight grimace and clenched his jaw, “it won’t rest, will it?”
“No, you –” An uneven breath stuttered out of Draco’s mouth. He curled his fingers into a fist on the side. He couldn’t show a trace of weakness to Harry Potter. “why would you care?”
“No, we’re in a show where the protagonist is stranded on a severed Island with a rival of seven years – Draco Malfoy – who can’t correct the stance,” Draco wanted to punch the smirk off Potter’s face. “a fantastic show.”
“You’ve been apparating.”
Draco Malfoy isn’t focusing on the stance,” He said with a soft snort. “and I’m not correcting it.”
Tentatively, he advanced towards the kitchen counter and picked the folded parchment. A reluctant smile spread across his face, as he read the note:
“Draco –” He had to bite down on a retort while the dull ache in his chest turned into a searing throb. “It was cruel and for the fifth time, I’m sorry,” He winced at the venom in the tone, cleared his throat and continued, “Yet, you said I had one last chance and I shouldn’t screw it up,” A beat. “That I was forgiven.”
thank you for the comments and kudos so far<3
Quickly Harry shook his head, looking up into cool grey eyes. "No. I want to keep dancing."
Draco sighed softly and nodded in understanding. "I want this fantasy to last forever."
“No, I’m not.” He stated as a matter-of-factly with a low snort. “Why are you scared for Voldemort, Malfoy?"
Harry chuckled, as whisked the flour, sugar and salt. In another bowl, he added the milk, butter and the eggs. Malfoy was watching him intently. It was insanely uncomfortable. “Can you whisk it, as I add the flour in portions?”
He yelped, an intense pain flaring up his right side and he turned to squint at Draco. Perhaps, it wasn’t fractured, yet it was aching. “Oh, you’re not a delicate figurine, Potter.”
Why would he, when Draco was here to pay the price of his own actions?
Draco mutters something that sounds a lot like "uncivilized brute" but Harry chooses to ignore it as he goes on.
Harry stared at the canvas. It was a night sky, and it was oddly familiar. A perfect mix of violet and black. Dim speckles of stars and a soft orb of moonlight in the sky.
“Somehow, I can’t think of a happy memory considering I’m stranded on a severed Island.”
“You wouldn’t understand.” He said softly, and a silence hung heavy in the air. His eyes flickered to Malfoy’s mouth, abruptly opening and closing. “We are all born into our ways of life. I was taught to play in those ways – And I did.”
Harry exhaled, slumping off the blond and on the soft sand, focusing on the stars in the night sky, to offer another distraction to the mind. “Oh, you’re an arse.”
A shiver went down his spine as he stared at the seagulls. With a confused frown, he half-turned and stared at the house, half a mile away from the shore. He was fairly certain Malfoy would set him on fire in his sleep.
“Your sense of self-preservation, clearly.”
The pocket watch was warm, and pulsing with the all too familiar magic.
He gave a slight shake to his head, and turned to the small pantry and mused through it to gather the ingredients. “Er – I was thinking of having pasta for dinner.”
“A disarming charm or a
Harry opened his eyes with a scream caught in his throat and a rising heartbeat. He was drenched in cold sweat, his fingers curled into the sheets. “Fucking – bastard – arsehole.”
“Alright, fine –” Draco said weakly, “you want to know why you and I can’t be friends?” He unclenched his fingers, “Now that you’ve offered a chance at a friendship, you know why I decided we can’t be friends?”
“Why – No, you are – Why aren’t you using any of those stupid names you always do?”
“Not too much chocolate, love.” Draco teased, handing Harry his cup. “Granger’s orders.”
“I know.” He smirked, as Malfoy sipped his tea with a sigh of content. “If you’re done grilling me –
“Yes, well, you’re an oblivious prat.”
Uncertainly, he placed a palm on Draco’s cheek, as his thumb wiped the tear trickling down his face. “You don’t deserve to die, Draco.”
Anywho,
"Yes, I want to dance with you and if the prophet wants to publish fifteen articles it can," He outstretched a hand towards the blond with a small smile, "come on."
Draco wasn’t alone when
Otryazan – He had heard of it before.
“I will, if you will.” He said softly, as he stirred his cauldron anti-clockwise. “It’s not 1996 – You were competitive in the sixth year. Your performance is preposterous in the eighth year, Potter.”
Harry didn’t even know if they were safe. He didn’t care about the fucking horcruxes. He cared about Ron and Hermione. He wanted them to be out of danger. He wanted them to be safe.
“Fuck off.”
” A corner of Draco’s mouth curves up. “or how we’re up at night on the Tower.”
It was plain atrocious. Wasn’t the wicked witch of the west with red cat eyes enough? He didn’t have a wand. He had to save the wizarding world. He had to stress over the horcruxes and now – Draco Lucius Malfoy. Yeah, fate was fucking cruel.
“It was brave, and even if I despise your father – Perhaps, he despises
Malfoy was quiet, a frown etched on his face, probably calculating the next words, fumbling with one of the gloves he was wearing. “Do you suppose your Patronus will be related to one of your – to Narcissa or Lucius?”
His fingers brushed against his pocket absent-mindedly, as he lowered himself on the couch and fished out the golden snitch, staring at the all too familiar words
“W-what?”
Draco was staring at the mars bar, unwrapping it uncertainly. With only a small bite, and his eyes widened. It lasted for a second before he schooled his expression into the usual bored-mien. “It’s alright.”
The brunet stared at him, almost as if he was calculating. Thinking. “On the top of the novel, is a pocket-watch. It’s an ancient artifact, don't -
“Harry.” He said, the desperation in his voice growing. He wanted to be called by those names. Not ‘Draco’ or ‘Malfoy’. Fuck. He’d have even take ‘sweet cheeks’ right then.
“Of course.” He was surprised at how quickly he said it. And how certain he was about it. He felt a pressure in his mind, like it was filled with smoke, before the feeling retreated. “If I find a way out.”
’ face on, which is the case ninety-nine percent of the time.” The brunet said with a short laugh. “white isn’t your colour, if you’re angling for it.”
He detested the tiny flutter. Or the warmth that coursed through him for a second. He decided to ignore it – Because it was reasonable to ignore it – And he didn’t want to feel that flutter again.
in one sentence. In fact, it could be your year-book quote, if we were in a mundane school without the wicked witch of the west in our lives.”
The corner of his lip twitched, and curled into a satisfied smirk. He wasn’t supposed to laugh with Malfoy, but it was oddly comforting. Almost surreal. He stared at Malfoy, and all he could see was a boy broken by months of tragedy and pain, forced to be on the wrong side of the war.
Harry pursed his lips and directed a pointed glare at Malfoy. Even if he wanted to, he couldn’t resist a clever sardonic remark: “Oh, well – must your stance be off every single time?”
The brunet scoffed.
He nicked the cloudlike towel and draped it around his hips, walking into the room, only to find Malfoy standing near the door. He scanned Harry, a little longer than required. Harry realized he was in the middle of the bedroom wearing only a towel, his wet hair dripping onto his bare torso. Awkward.
“Yes, I did and don’t gape, Malfoy.” Potter said with a stifled yawn and mumbled a curse. The idiot wouldn’t fucking rest. “I can read if I want to. Or at least I can read if I’m in a modern-day Neverland with you.”
Harry hummed, wrapping an arm around him. When they pushed open the door, stepping into the warmth from the fireplace, they sighed. They walked over to the kitchen, hand in hand.
Malfoy cursed with a soft groan. Clever, sarcastic retorts were rather amusing since they irritated the blond. “I should rethink your subtle and not-so-sarcastic compliments over the years.”
“We have a choice, Malfoy.”
“Perhaps you should cast a glance around the place when you not-so subtly compliment the chosen one.”
Malfoy tried to turn him around to face him but he remained stubbornly in place. “Why do you care, Draco? You fucking detest me”
He couldn’t resist.
“It’s not the kind of world I can survive in.”
Instead of interrupting Potter’s useless attempts at perfecting wandless magic, he strode into his room and closed the door behind him. He had the sudden urge to break a few things. Specifically Potter’s face.
Harry laughed. Malfoy smiled. And it caused a tiny flutter in his chest again. He opened the fridge, browsing for the chocolate chips and avoiding Malfoy’s gaze. He detested the flutter or the warmth that coursed through him. He cursed silently. Yet, the flutter didn’t want to cease.
He turned his gaze to the canvas, searching for the tiniest bit of resemblance. A resemblance of the sky with Potter. And he didn’t find one. Or perhaps he didn’t know Potter.
Draco clasped a hand in Harry’s, who hauled the blond to his feet. “Rule Five: Consider whether Harry Potter would leave you face-planting in the sand before you allow him to pull you to your feet.”
“We’re in a place that doesn’t exist on the globe.”
“I – when I was in your compartment for an introduction,” He said with a tone of impatience and had a strain to the voice, his eyebrows creating a small, sharp crease which Harry strangely wanted to smooth out. Draco exhaled, forming a cloud of fog in front of the face. “On the train –”
The one Draco had draped over him.
“Right.” Potter said in an unfocused voice, tilting his head at the sky, a smile forming on the face. “Glad we did.”
Harry tried to catch hold of something, but he was already falling. And then he wasn't. Draco's arms were back around him, holding him in a dip off the ground.
“Harry,” Draco whispered softly, with a brief touch of fingertips, and it sent shivers down his spine. “I know.”
“If I had wings, I would fly to Neverland and leave you in Otryazan, Potter. I can barely stand you for two seconds.”
He wanted to retort with a “
–” he said with a small scoff and stared at Draco for a moment, while he calculated the next words. “don’t care about each other, Malfoy,”
The trauma of the loss hadn’t been easy on him. He would’ve spiralled into a never-ending cycle of suffering and guilt if Potter wasn’t here. And he couldn’t decide if he wanted to kick Potter’s arse out of Otryazan or not.
“No fucking way,” Draco said, with an air of drama and frowned at the screen. “Eat your own atrocious candy.”
Of course, friends or not, the fight-fests with sarcastic retorts won’t cease. Perhaps, the fact that he was friends with Draco wouldn’t change the familiar comfort of antagonism he shared with the blond and he was fine with it. Yet, he couldn’t resist a quip. “Christ, why are we friends when you’re a prat?”
And he practiced near the seashore for a while, torturing Steve the seashell. It was bad enough that the poor seashell didn’t have wings. Harry was targeting its insecurities over the inability to fly. It went: “Oh, hi! You don’t have wings and you never will. I’ll levitate you for a while for selfish reasons and once I’m finished, you’ll go back to existing as Steve – The seashell without wings.”
He placed the cup on the bedside table, over the copy of The Lord of The Rings and walked out of the room with a slow pace and over to the kitchen counter.
“I watched bloodshed, and I’ve heard the screams of the others while they were being tortured by the death eaters.” Malfoy continued, clearing his throat awkwardly. “It wasn’t right.”
scene?”
“Oh, wait – You’re Harry Potter – It’ll have some sort of a complicated explanation. You’re right, I don't think I want to hear it.” Malfoy said, with a little smile. “Do you remember our Quidditch matches?”
It was certainly a strange week. He was on an Island, with Draco Malfoy. A severed Island. He didn’t have a wand, and the simplest wandless spells were draining him and he couldn’t even get started on the crepes or the recent events. It was sort of an odd dream.
He stared at Malfoy, and gave him a soft nod.
Draco was silent was a while, mouth set in a thin line, his silver eyes had a furious, sort of vulnerable, uncertain glint. "Oh, fuck you," He whispered. "Fuck you for how you,” Draco’s voice cracked and a flicker of pain crossed the features, “for how you offered a chance at a friendship when you don't care."
Draco falls, Harry catches him (I KNOW)
The corner of his lip twitched and curled into a soft smile. The wisps of silver circled, and turned into a beautiful white stag. A familiar comfort washed over him. He was safe.
“I was sixteen and fucking scared, Potter.” Draco said in a spur of moment, and his eyes widened as realization dawned on him. He cursed under his breath and grimaced. “You wouldn’t know shit about it, would you?”
“Y-You can’t. He will kill my mother, Potter. He will kill her, and he will hunt me down and kill me as well.”
“You produced a corporeal Patronus without a wand, when you can’t even perform a simple levitation charm without a sporadic outcome, wearing yourself out in the process and you still didn’t recover.”
“If sarcasm is your defence mechanism, it’s ‘
“Do elaborate.”
“We’re not –” The brunet paused, considering his next words. He wasn’t certain what they were. Wasn’t certain if he could forget the six years of animosity for once. Yet it had reduced, hadn’t it? “we’re
The stag was fading.
satisfied to cause it. “You’re not half as humorous as you think you are.”
“It’s not a –” Draco arched a brow while he squinted at the cup. If one charm could conceal the cup, to perceive it in a certain way, it was a rather potent one. He could slowly feel himself giving into his curiosity but thankfully, his frustration at Potter was overpowering then. “not a sufficient clarification for what you said a while ago.”
“You’re staring."
Draco gaped at him. He would certainly remember if he let Harry Potter into the Slytherin common room. He arched an eyebrow at the brunet. “I didn’t.”
“Oh, of course,” Harry said with a soft snort, wrinkling his nose, a familiar, sly glint returning in the eyes, which Draco

section in the prophet –.” Perhaps, it was a quip, yet Draco forced a serious mien on the face. “to trash you.” A beat. “write about how you’re a moronic fuck.”
Harry glared at Draco, and he would’ve been slightly fazed if he wasn’t tired after the panic attack earlier.
“You’ve never cared about the title of the ‘
(See the end of the chapter for
With a nod, he entered the bedroom through the unlocked window and he was engulfed in a familiar warmth, and the brunet trailed into the room in a minute.
No. He couldn’t blame Potter. His father had known. He had fucking known, that if he extended even the slightest bit of help to Draco, he would be breaking the vow. And he had done it anyway.
Harry smiles cheekily while Draco rolls his eyes dramatically–still flustered.
Draco clutched his chest with a pained gasp, a small smile on the corners of his mouth, the dust of the previous conversation subsiding. “Oh, you wound me.”
The vain attempts at finding the note continued for a few minutes. Malfoy didn’t even bother glancing at food on the counter. When he didn’t find one, he walked back into the bedroom with an irritated growl, closing the door behind him with a loud thud.
“Why?”
Draco felt a slight shake his shoulder, and his eyes opened. Harry was pointing up at the evening sky, the corner of his lip twitching. "You can around five different planets without a telescope. Or six.”
Draco ran his fingers across the frame. He exhaled softly, tearing his gaze away from it. He walked towards the window, and a soft breeze brushed across his face. He inhaled the familiar scent of seawater and watched the waves crash against the shore. “What the–"
’ I will not quit, considering it’s an incentive to rile you up, Malfoy.” He said, casting a quick cleaning charm on the plate. “Ever.”
God, he wanted a break.
Malfoy cursed with a muffled groan. The words were unfamiliar. Foreign. “Perhaps you can tone down the swearing a bit – quit glaring – Plus, I can’t even comprehend what you’re saying.”
Voldemort was a pain in the arse. A royal fucking pain in the arse. He designed ‘Lord Voldemort’ out of Tom Marvolo Riddle, when he could’ve created Mr. Atom Dildo Lover or Dove Lord out of it.
Anger curled hot and unstoppable in his gut, like a blazing inferno that wanted to burn him from the inside out, and his nails cut into his skin. “You take that back right now, Malfoy.”
“This is me giving in." Draco admitted softly after a while, inhaling and breathing in his calming scent. It was like everything Draco loved; it was sweet and warm and soft and just – Harry
“It’s quiet,” Draco whispered with a sigh, fingers outstretched to the sky, fingers tracing the pitch-black night sky, around in a sort of backward question mark with a small triangle. Leo. “Isn’t it?”
Potter underlined the words with an oh-so familiar smirk and it was infuriating. The silver light faded, and vanished into thin air. “So, you decided to conjure a patronus?”
And then, he couldn’t take it anymore. He felt a loud ringing in his ears. The voice that was too close yet too far away. He clenched his fists to his side, his fingernails digging into them. He didn’t want to hurt Potter. Because he wasn’t fighting back.
Draco nodded.
With an uncertain sigh, he whispered a soft ‘
It wasn’t detailed. Yet, he was certain that it would work. He wanted a fucking victory, even if it would be short-lived. One fucking victory over Draco Malfoy. It was the six years of animosity and the desire to have a win. He didn’t care about Malfoy. He wasn’t worried or stressing over the unrequited notes. Or so he said.
“Oh, what do you want, Malfoy?” He rasped, almost a growl, without any venom in it. Potter was sort of worn-out, the eyes were dull, reflecting only the dim candlelight of the room. “I want to sort out our fight.”
Would his own sky ever hold a bright star?
He sighed softly. Hunting the horcruxes was important. It was the only way to defeat Voldemort. The only way to survive and to save the wizarding world. He owed it to the ones who had lost their lives in the war.
contradicting you over the fact that I’m a moronic fuck when you’ve convinced yourself that I will –,” It elicited a scoff. “continue to remain an unbearable moronic fuck to you, Malfoy.”
He sighed, as the soft footsteps approached him. In a brief second, Malfoy is standing beside him wearing the well-practiced smirk.
“A warning,” He murmured with a slight quiver, lifting a brow, voice laced with sarcasm, which was one of the
He sliced a lemon and placed it on the side of the two cups and added half a spoon of milk, and half the cap of cream to it with one spoon of sugar in his cup and cast a warming charm on it. Perfect.
“You got a little something –
“Aw, you can fight,” Draco said in a slow, sarcastic drawl. “Not a delicate figurine, are you?”
Malfoy scowled, and half-turned to face him with an arched eyebrow, “Oh, the world is ending every fucking day – what’s your point, Potter?”
“Moronic fuck – yes, we’ve established that thrice,” He whispered a soft curse while he forced the small flutter out. Yet, he couldn’t ignore the fact that his hand was clasped in Draco’s cold ones. “friends?”
He figured he could offer to prepare a cup of tea, considering Potter didn’t leave him out on the rooftop. “I’ll prepare a cup of tea for you. Rest on the bed for a while.”
"Very much so," Draco sneers but it loses most of its effectiveness because of the blush still staining his cheeks.
“Oh, I’m fascinated with the title of the article,” Draco said in a slow, sarcastic drawl. “it’s rather catchy.” He shifted in place with a soft grunt. “you should consider a career in Journalism.”
Draco continued staring anyways.
“Potter.”
He was certain that Potter wanted to rile him up, and force him out of the room. He wasn’t even subtle about it. Draco was slightly tempted to argue with the brunet. Even if it was over a shattered teacup.
He had to find out if Ron and Hermione were safe and if they were continuing with the horcrux hunt. He wished they weren’t. He wanted to believe that they were in a safe place. Wanted to believe they weren’t continuing with the hunt without him. It would be unbearable to stand the pain, if he lost them in the war.
“Stuart Little? I have no idea – Potter, be lenient with the sugar – who Stuart Little is, and I’ll ignore it.”
“Convenient – I’ll
Harry smirked. It was more than alright.
And the flutter returned.
the right time for childish trash talk, Malfoy.”
“You – No fucking way – You and Weasley entered the common room, disguised as Crabbe and Goyle, to spy on me because you assumed that I was the heir of Slytherin?”
“I was,” Draco said with a small smile, tracing his mind back to when he was a child, and would stare at the wide-expanse of the night-sky for hours. “It’s beautiful, of course, yet –
“In the current episode of
A laugh escaped his mouth. “In the second year, we brewed the Polyjuice Potion to spy on the suspected heir of Slytherin.” He said the ‘Heir of Slytherin’ in a mysterious mock voice. “As Crabbe and Goyle.”
Baking cookies while listening to a fairytale is one of my favorite memories w my bsf. Had to include that.
Draco’s eyes widen and an uneven breath stutters out of his mouth.  “You – I – forever?”
Draco frowned.
He inhaled shakily. The rage was familiar, and he couldn’t give in. He closed his eyes, focusing on the sound of the waves and the rustling of tress. On the soft breeze. And it was slightly better.
"Pansy, can I borrow your best friend for a while?" He said when he walked over to the table, eyes fixed on Draco, who was turning the glass of wine in his hand, a small smirk on the mouth. "if you don't mind, of course."
It clicked. Fantastic. Twice within an hour. The brunet’s throat went painfully tight. He had, in fact, screwed up. Draco’s reaction was simply an instinct of self-preservation.
“I can toast a bread without burning it, Potter.” Malfoy said while folding another crepe, placing it on a plate and drizzling it with a bit of chocolate syrup. “Plus, I want you to be confused.”
. He hadn’t intended to offend him. It was only a quip. “Not the couch, Potter. Read or rest if you want to – on the bed.”
“I trusted my instincts of the dark mark branded on your arm,” He retorted. “I wasn’t wrong, was I?”
It was a soft whisper, the warm breath ghosting on the skin, causing a shiver to race down Draco’s spine and a warmth to rise in the face while the brunet guided his hand in a slow circular motion. “ease up, Draco.”
side. A side that wasn’t insolent. A side which could cast a warming charm on ‘
“You’re not my favourite Slytherin.”
– In Madam Malkin’s – the first year,” Draco whispered with a soft sigh, the shadow of his mouth moving up and down. The occasional flash of the perfect white teeth.  “we had a short conversation.”
The artifact in his pocket pulsed with raw magic. It was warmer, and heavier. And he had the urge to vent it out. He wanted to let out the pent-up rage. All at once. He was furious – Furious at Draco Malfoy. At Lucius Malfoy for sending him to Otryazan.
Harry groaned inwardly, as he recalled the events of the manor. He would’ve been dead if Lucius Malfoy hadn’t sent him here. Yet, the question remained: Why was he here?
"Don't ever try to get inside my head again" Harry said, in a dangerously low voice and pushed him against the rough bark. He stared into the grey eyes, and his tone softened. "It's too dark for you."
“Draco, what –” He was cut off when the blond raised a hand with a slight quiver and rose from the bed and paced over to the door, he paused for a brief second, however, when Harry whispered, “Draco.”
Draco’s eyes tailed Potter’s line of sight, who was watching the sky in a trance with a fond glint, eyes transfixed on the full-moon. “You’re fond of the night-sky, aren’t you?”
He adjusted his glasses, as he walked towards the window. The waves were calming. The glasses weren’t broken. He had figured that Malfoy had fixed them last night, and it was absurd. The Draco Malfoy he had known would’ve never fixed the cracked lenses.
“Weren’t you supposed to lure me into –”
“It’s – a healing charm,” He curled his fingers into a fist at the side. It wasn’t a clever idea – which was becoming a running theme – to heal the cuts. “It was–”
“Do you, now?”
“I wasn’t –” Potter cursed, fingers twitching on the side while he frowned at the artefact and the corners of his mouth downturned, “wasn’t in a stable emotional condition.”
“Oh, well-done,” He said in a slow drawl with a faint chuckle. “and quit with the ‘
“Is it?” Malfoy said with a smirk and it caused the flutter in his chest. “Correct it, if you want to.”
A note was placed beside the plate.
Draco jumped up, eyes containing stars, and he began to explain his plan for constructing the snow figure. He seemed so excited, an expression Harry rarely saw, but loved to catch on him.
“A bit of both.” Draco whispered against his mouth. “Can we share the chocolates?”
“Sort of,” He said in a rather strained voice. “I’ve levitated enough seashells, and I wanted to perform a complex spell while you – Malfoy – were snoring and mumbling nonsense.”
“Christ, not a fight-fest with you,” He shifted in place with a curse, brows frowning, fingers fidgeting with the cup. “One of us is bound to screw up with an insensitive retort in the first five seconds.”
He couldn’t leave. It wasn’t an order. It was an obvious conclusion. He had to leave. He had to find the horcruxes. And he didn’t have a lot of time. “Where are we, Malfoy?”
“I’m heading out for a bit of fresh air,” Harry said, nicking the cloak which was placed on the kitchen-counter and draped it over his shoulder while exhaling slowly. In consideration, he wanted a minute of peace and quiet, yet he decided against it when he turned to Malfoy and in an unclear voice he said, “You coming?”
“You’re insanely disappointed,” Harry countered, with a smirk. More banter – It was almost surreal. “Tea?”
Harry apparently had to work on the summoning charm, because the teacup didn’t even twitch. It was the most challenging aspect of practicing wandless magic. He couldn’t focus on the spell and the direction of magic at the same time.
*gasp*
It was about fairy-tales and fantasies. A land with faith, trust and pixie dust. A sky where falling stars live instead of burning out. A side with a soft fucking epilogue.
The panic surged through him, and a tear tricked down his cheek, followed by disjointed by his gasps for air. His sight clouded, vision growing dark from a lack of oxygen, and his knees dropped to the floor, as he cried. “Stop it, Harry. Please. Please don’t.”
Draco stared at him.
on my headstone.”
Harry cleared his throat, and released the grip of Malfoy’s wrist. He turned his gaze towards the kitchen Island, and frowned. A heavy silence hung in the air.
He wandered out in the evening for the cup of tea. And it was waiting on the counter. With the perfectly sliced lemon on the side.
As the sun dipped below the horizon, the fleeting colours of the dusk started to fade away. And he was entranced by the sight. It was beautiful to watch a sunset.
“Oh, such high praise from our precious Chosen One,” Draco said with a scoff, voice laced with sarcasm, wrinkling his nose, fingers uncurling out of the soft fabric of the sweater. “I’m
“I wasn’t in your room for an opinion about the Prophet,” Potter said with a soft sigh, carding his fingers through his unruly hair. “you want to be clued in on the artefact, correct?”
He had described the sky near the seashore at night, under the light of the stars. Yet, the curiosity lingered in the air: Why had Draco Malfoy painted the sky of Harry's fancy?
“I’m stranded on a severed Island with my arch nemesis, baking chocolate chip cookies for supper. Of course I’ve lost my sanity, Malfoy.”
“Yes.”
“Harry,” Draco said softly, and the brunet jerked his head in disbelief at the use of his first name, “My father – Did he say anything to you?”
He moved it forward and upward in one motion, sending the crepe about half a meter in the air before it landed into the pan again. He repeated the motion a few more times, each time gaining slightly further distance from the pan, landing back down with a soft sound.
Harry chuckled, as he passed a mars bar and a mini Toblerone to him, as he nicked a chocolate bar from Draco’s hand and nibbled on it. The texture was delicate. Malfoy-ish.
“You wish, Malfoy.”
Potter arched an eyebrow.
It was clear that the brunet despised flattering Draco, and he had been subtle about it. He wouldn’t say it out loud, but it was slightly easier to have conversations with Potter. It was light-hearted. Sort of amusing.
“No, I didn’t.” He muttered as he turned his gaze towards the window, and focusing on the soft sound of the waves crashing against the shore. “All the pain – the loss – the guilt – It turned into rage.”
Harry didn’t want to leave another note with tea, because he knew that Malfoy wouldn’t answer. And despite that, he left one:
“Finished, Malfoy?” He asked in a monotone, releasing the grip on the chair. Malfoy wasn’t finished. In fact, a few of the curses were sort of strange, foreign words. “Oh, we’re still swearing – fantastic.”
“You’re a moronic fuck, Malfoy.”
The breath he was holding stuttered out of his mouth, and his thoughts were reeling. “I’m sorry.”
“Oh, we would’ve had an interview,” He cut him off with a soft snort.  The prophet would’ve glorified the article if it involved Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy. “from rivals to friends: A closer, exclusive insight.”
Or maybe just a slow dance.
“Never,” Harry said, with a soft chuckle as he placed his crepe neatly on the plate, folding it and topping it off with whipped cream. “I can never get used to The Draco Malfoy complimenting my crepes.”
He cursed. “Weren’t we clear over the fact that I had to leave Otryazan to defeat the wicked witch of the west with red cat eyes?” A quip to lighten the situation. “We were, right?”
An amused smirk formed on his lips, as he stared at Malfoy. He directed an icy glare at Harry, but it didn’t affect him. It never did. Harry chuckled, and headed to the small pantry to get the rest of the essentials. “Isn’t Otryzan enclosed by ancient magic? Can’t you ask the Island to prepare the breakfast?”
“Malfoy, I’ve seen it.” He said softly, the emerald green eyes peering into his own grey ones. “We’re linked in a way – Voldemort and I – And I accessed his mind without intending to.”
“You saved him, didn’t you?” Harry clenched his fists to his side. He barely managed to hold back a retort. He didn’t suppose that: “Serves him right” would’ve been the right thing to say. “You saved your father’s arse, and that bastard sent me here.”
create a conflict,” Draco said with a faint snort. The familiar comfort of antagonism was well-suited for a proper, light conversation. “We would’ve had a small fight-fest over it.”
thank you for reading it so far <3
His voice was small. A mouse’s protest. The silence stretched on, and it was uncomfortable.
And once again, there was a tiny flutter in his chest.
The blond frowned, as he brushed the strand out of his eyes. The light was falling on his face, and his skin was even – Oh, shut up. “Sure you weren’t.”
“Draco…” He whispered, placing a hand over his. He knew, that he couldn’t hold him back. They weren’t dating, because neither of them had the courage to ask.
“I’ve been sixteen and fucking scared, Malfoy.” He scoffed. “I’ve been eleven and fucking scared.”
He inhaled sharply as he neared the house, his fingers twisting the doorknob slowly. He slipped in, closing it behind him with a soft thud. Instinctively, his gaze landed on the countertop, and a piece of parchment placed on the side with familiar elegant cursive.
. Draco’s eyes lingered on the brunet for a second. Two. “I'll head out for a minute of peace."
“Don’t.”
Lifting Draco's hands to his lips, Harry places little pecks all over them until he spots that familiar coat of baby pink settle on Draco's cheeks, darkening by the second.
“Your chocolates are in different shapes, I want one.”
“Okay, truce,” Malfoy said, with a short laugh. It caused another fucking flutter, and a flicker of warmth with a small smile grazing his lips. “It was amusing to disrupt the Quidditch match.”
, and if you are covered in blood, it shouldn't be on the bed."
Or maybe his sky would remain dark.
“Can’t you accept a compliment without coming up with some sort of comment?”
He slipped.
“A Patronus is conjured from a strong memory, filled with emotion. You need to find one a content memory, and concentrate on it, then say, Expecto Patronum."
"No."
“I wished on the stars for us.”
“What are you staring at, Potter?”
“You wanted to be friends not five minutes ago,” He paced over to the other side. “In fact, you’ve wanted to be my friend for six years,” Draco directed a rather sharp glare at him which he returned with the similar intensity. “Now, when we are friends, why would you change it?”
"That's literally your fourth cup of coffee, sweetcheeks. At this point, you're not finding sleep tonight." Spoken with an endeared undertone as Harry pries the coffee mug out of Draco's hands, ignoring his protests and replacing them with his own instead, clasping the warm hands with a gentle yet firm grip.
“An astute observation, Potter. I would’ve applauded, but I’m occupied with a crucial task of finishing the rest of the cookies.”
Draco held out his hand at him, his mouth set in a line. He clasped his hand in Draco’s, and allowed himself to be pulled to his feet.
“Never. I never did, because if I hated you, I would’ve just ignored you.”
“Oh, right.” He said with a small smirk, resting his elbows on the kitchen counter. “Wait – but you can’t even toast a bread without burning it – I’m confused.”
He felt rooted to the spot. His legs felt odd—heavy and stiff—weighing him down. The words were underlined with a glare, as though daring Harry to argue.
He opened his eyes, and a soft gasp escaped him. He rummaged through his clothes, and finally fished out the soft piece of fabric, and draped it over his shoulder as he walked out of the dorm and into the common room and out. Out of the castle.
“I – what?”
“Oh, the moronic fuck won’t leave,” A soft sigh escaped Draco’s mouth. He didn't want to do this, not now. He had no patience or the inclination to care about what the precious Chosen One wanted. Yet of course, ignoring Potter's presence wasn't an option. The prat wouldn’t grant Draco the privilege. He closed the novel with a curse and placed it on the bedside table. “what?”
Malfoy’s face was slightly pink and he felt his own face warming up.
“Where were you – Oh, you were in the cabinet, weren’t you?”
we’re friends yet you won’t deal with it?” Harry lifted a brow at the blond in confusion. He angled for a quip instead, “Or no, I can’t interview you about your skin and hair care routine if I start a Draco Malfoy section in the prophet?”
Malfoy’s voice was calm, clear yet strict in a sense while he briefed the brunet about the theoretical part of it and for once, he was focused and intent on listening to the blond. “Wait a second – spontaneous?”
would be his response to the situation.
“Yeah, well, it’s easy for you,” Draco had a tremble to the voice yet he maintained a bored-mien on the face, oblivious to the fact that he had a tint of pink of the pale cheeks. “is the stance
Potter nodded, and turned to leave. Draco caught his elbow without thinking, tightening his grip and inched even closer. Potter froze, his eyes wide and pupils dilating. He cleared his throat, and half-turned. He jerked his arm out of the grip, and Draco reeled a couple steps back. “You can’t – I – Was?”
“You can’t, and I’ve told you before – It’s surrounded by ancient magic, and it’s severed from the rest of the world. There isn’t a way out.”
The pattering of the raindrops, and the occasional lightning and the thunder was rather calming.
He shrugged dismissively, turning the page of the novel he had been reading. His nose scrunched up, as he marked the page and set the book aside.
“You winced two minutes ago,” Malfoy said, carding his fingers through the platinum blond hair with a slight upturn of lips, curling into a faint smirk. “Yeah, I’m not oblivious.”
“I went against The Dark Lord’s interest, and he sent me here.”
Instead, he focused on the easier ones. When he had found out he was a wizard. It wasn’t tainted with the war or Voldemort. It was an innocent one, with a bit of childish delight to discover the existence of magic.
“Er – Malfoy,” Potter said, raising his eyebrows in confusion. “If you aren’t going to punch me, can you –
He sighed, carding his fingers through the unruly hair. If the note wasn’t on the counter, it was probably with Malfoy. A subtle way to answer the question on the note.
Harry couldn’t resist a small smile. “Wicked witch of the west instead of The Dark Lord – Merlin, who are you and what did you do with Draco I despise references Malfoy?”
“W-What?” Draco asked, opening his mouth to answer but the only thing that came out was a choked sob. He didn’t want to be around Potter. He didn’t want his enemy to see him in a vulnerable state. Draco pushed him away, with a warning glare and the brunet stumbled backwards. “Don’t, Potter.”
Draco went still against the mantelpiece. A flicker of hurt crossed his face. Harry watched him swallow, watched the muscle that was twitching in his jaw, and felt like he might crawl out of his skin.
“No quips,” He warned, yet the corner of his mouth upturned. “or references – so, shut up.”
Harry closed his eyes, and whispered, “Do you really want to have that conversation right now?”
Steve was levitated for a while, until it returned to existing as Steve the ordinary seashell. If Steve was sending curses at him, he wouldn’t know.
“We’ll figure it out.” Harry whispered against his mouth, and smiled as he said, "I promise."
He heard the front door creak open slightly, and close.
“No, Malfoy.” Malfoy visibly flinched at the loud, harsh voice. “when did you ever provide one reason – only one fucking reason – to trust you?”
“I was in pain – And I didn’t know if I could deal with the loss of my Godfather. And that pain turned into rage. I wanted to inflict insurmountable pain on Bellatrix. Torture her. Kill her – I wanted revenge.”
As anticipated, the crepes were still on the kitchen counter when he returned to the house. And he could only assume that the plan was still working.
“Oh, can you quit it, Potter?” He said in a strained voice, the words laced with venom, yet in the current situation, it wasn’t holding the intended effect, which seemed to infuriate Draco further. “you fucking prat –”
Another shatter.
This was going to be fun.
His voice trailed. He didn’t know if he could trust Malfoy or voice those two words. And he didn’t want to get into another argument or a fight. He wasn’t sure if he would fight back.
“True,” He said, closing the files and placing it on the side as he leaned in to place a chaste kiss on his lips. Only a brush of lips. “Night, Malfoy.”
“Draco,” He said, his voice soft and slightly remorseful. “Your father is dead.”
He stuttered out a soft ‘
“So, now you can prepare a crepe – which is perfect, by the way – you can find a way to continue your to-do list which involves
“You don’t pause for one second to calculate your words, do you?” Draco underlined the words with a glare. “The one person you don’t want to be with – who would you rather prefer, Potter?”
Draco quivers underneath his fingers, lifting his gaze off the floor, and in a small, frail voice, he murmurs, “It’s our secret, Harry.”
Malfoy arched an eyebrow at him and as if he was speaking to an invisible crown said: “Oh, the overachieving chosen one.” He said in a monotone. “I resented your overachieving abilities.”
Harry peered into the startling grey eyes while he swirled to the music with Draco and felt a faint flutter in the chest, which wouldn’t cease. “You dance well.”
A night sky.
He guided the wand in a circular motion and a silvery mist, stretched and curled around him, even as it started to dispel. It was pronounced than the ones he had cast before He caught a breath in excitement.
The code of conduct was the perfect distraction. “Rule Four: when you’re cold and the
“I can censor an insensitive comment,” He whispered. “No second chances if I screw up, right?”
He was focused on the small cut on top of Draco’s face. A tinge of red on the pale skin. He frowned. It would scar. “Can you –” Uncertainly, the brunet reached out, cut Draco mid-sentence, tracing his thumb in the direction of the cut, whispering a soft ‘
“I ate your candy – chocolates – I ate your chocolates.”
“Perhaps,” He whispered, in a low, uncertain voice. “but her sacrifice has sort of woven an intricate pattern of protection and it will remain in place – for a while – with the Patronus, it’s – it’s a simple pattern of Dad’s.”
“As long as I don’t have to share the M&M’s.”
’ or the rest of it.” He stated as a matter-of-factly, with a small laugh. To Draco Malfoy, he wasn’t the
He was no longer outright laughing, but the sparkle of amusement was still behind his eyes. Draco tried to send a withering glare at him, but it didn't faze him. “You’re infuriating, Potter.”
Falling.
He wanted to obliterate the fucking watch. The closer he was to it, the worse it would be.  It wasn’t an actual pocket-watch, he had cast a glamour on it while he was in the Malfoy manor.
“After I kick your ass,” Harry winked and waggled a finger at him. “I will kick your ass. Bad.”
“Oh, of course.”
“Potter,” A voice said, and the voiced drowned. “Focus on brewing the potion, will you?”
The words were cut short when Draco tripped over a protruding stone, fingers clutching into a fist on Harry's sleeve and throwing the both of them off-balance, sending them crashing together on the sand.
“You could’ve died, or risked the others – The entire operation failed, because you wanted to save me. I don’t care if he would’ve killed me, Malfoy. I care about the others. I care about you.”
He chuckled, as his mind traced back to the match in second-year. He had broken an arm because of the rouge Bludger. Yet, he had won the match. It had been insanely satisfying to win against Draco Malfoy.
“You had to ruin the hope, didn’t you?” He said with a scoff. “I wanted to wish on a genie – if we ever find a magical lamp – and ask for a flying carpet, and find a way out of the fucking Island.”
Malfoy cleared his throat awkwardly, as he stared fixedly at his shoes. “No, I shouldn’t be.”
He opened his eyes and wisps of silver were circling in front of him, only to vanish in the air. No, it wasn’t the right one. He had to focus on something else.
Harry couldn’t figure out how to refute it. Instead, he watched while Draco strode out of the room and to the kitchen. He had screwed up but for once, he couldn’t find it within him to fight with the prat.
“Yes. The Wicked Witch of the west or Wizard Hitler – Whatever floats your boat.”
“Malfoy, I –
“Oh, shut up.” The blond wrapped a warm cloak around him. “If you’re quite finished with the remarks –”
“We are in the Otryazan Island,” He said after a while. “An Island severed from the rest of the world. It is surrounded by ancient magic, and we can’t leave.”
“Yeah.”
A serious conversation with Draco Malfoy was an ongoing nightmare, yet for once, it was one the brunet wanted to continue, without censoring it. “You could’ve –
“Guess we both got dragged into this, huh?”
“Watching you torture the poor crepe.”
“No idea.” Draco said with a soft chuckle, shifting with a groan. “we’re –” He winced and raised his nimble, trembling fingers to the cut on the top of the cheekbone. “well, we’re in an incredible amount of pain.”
With a groan, the blond paced over to the fireplace across the room and leaned on the mantelpiece. A low growl escaped Draco’s mouth and he said, “It’s a dark artifact, isn’t it?”
“I’ve changed my mind – No grave, I’m tossing you in the fucking sea.”
“The ancient magic in Otryazan will wear you out with the simplest charms.” Malfoy whispered; his gaze fixed on a picture on the mantle. “It’s easier with a wand.”
Draco stared at him; the confusion evident on his face. Harry would always use a pet name, and give him a kiss. At least one. “Is everything alright, Harry?”
Harry thought about Draco, in his mansion, hating every ounce of plaster. If home was where the heart was…
Potter snorted from behind, earning him a sharp elbow to the ribs, causing him to take a step backwards with a little ‘oof’.
Harry nodded, sucking in a deep breath to compose himself. Bloody Malfoy, always catching him off guard.
Harry glared into his abandoned drink. He hated it when Malfoy was right. By now, the coffee had cooled down, the smoke thinner, the dancers dropping as they plummeted softly through the air.
“Here and there, whatever I can.” He smiled sadly.
Harry shrugged. "I think it's cute," he said, not missing the way Draco's brows shot up and his ears turned red, "I've got a record player back home. Maybe we could listen to them sometime."
“Is it your arrogance perhaps? No, I’d say it’s more to do with the nightmares you have. Do they keep you up all night? Does she have to sleep in a separate room?”
At least Ron had Flooed him, having heard about his recent assignment. They hadn’t spoken for long, but they’d been able to complain about the situation enough to make Harry feel at least slightly more at ease.
Ok, so I know it's not exactly canon, and I'm honestly not sure if what Draco did was entirely possible according to magical lore, but I was having a look at "magic reveals" in the Harry Potter books (like how Harry regrew his hair and everything) and I thought that maybe pureblood families like the Malfoys would be looking for something powerful and explosive. J.K never really gave us much backstory on any of the other characters surrounding this kind of thing so I thought I'd have a play around with it.
Draco squirmed, on the verge of bursting.
“Of course you would,” said Malfoy, rolling his eyes.
Her eyes were pleading, and Harry nodded, trying for a small smile. “I’m sorry too,” he said.
“Oh Harry, dear,” Molly fussed, brushing stray hairs away from his eyes, “do you ever tidy your hair?”
“Yes, I know.” Kingsley pinched the bridge of his nose when Harry folded his arms, cocking his head to one side. “We understand that you had a, let’s say tumultuous relationship when you were at Hogwarts—”
“Characters,” Potter corrected, “the amount of books that would screech at you for no reason.”
Though it didn’t change the fact that he’d be working with Malfoy in just two days. Malfoy. Would horrors never cease?
Draco nodded, worrying his lip.  Circe, he’d been so cruel. To think that he’d been jealous of a boy who didn’t even know what his own name meant. He wished, now more than any other time, that he hadn’t grown up in such a pureblood home, that he’d been exposed to more than just traditional values. Maybe if he’d been muggle-born, maybe if he’d been kinder, maybe if he’d learned how to cook…
“Master Draco’s waiting for Mr Potter, sir.” Harry blinked.
“Oh yes, it became rather impossible to sneak past Filtch once you set those off.”
“It wouldn’t be all that bad if you were to become friends,” she said. Harry could tell she was uneasy, but she was giving him her blessing and he honestly didn’t know how to thank her for that.
“I feel like I don’t have to force myself to be someone I’m not when I’m around you, you know,” Potter mumbled, “you insult me far too much. No way I could be a hero with you constantly reminding me of my faults.”
“Potter do you realise how ridiculous you sound?” Draco folded his arms as Potter pranced about gleefully. “Potter this is a public library,” Draco tried exasperatedly, “any number of people could’ve taken out that book.”
Harry stared at the paper. “Dinner?” he asked, quiet at first. “Dinner? Malfoy you have got to be joking.” He jumped to his feet, waving the papers in Malfoy’s face. Malfoy blinked innocently, sipping from his glass.
“This is my job,” Draco shrugged.
“I thought that was an estimate,” he squeaked.
The sky was a dull orange, ebbing away to lilac behind the curtain of reeds surrounding the burrow, nearby water shimmering as if it were alive with tiny flames.
“Harry…” he swallowed, “if you push them away because of this, because of what you think they think about you, you’ll never get them back, not in the same way. Don’t give up on them, they never have on you.”
“Give us a minute,” Blaise shook his head, tugging at his laces with more force than necessary, “I’ve barely just got my shoes back. I should sue.”
“No need.”
“Now.” Ginny’s face softened again. “Or we’ll just keep putting it off.”
It burned, how much he wanted to kiss him. It burned.
“I’ve been keeping you company, haven’t I?”
Harry shrugged, slipping out of his robes. He tossed it into the hall behind Draco where It crumpled on the floor, clearly in no mood to do entirely as he was told.
He sighed, sitting upright in his chair. “What are you planning to poison me with this evening?” he asked, in a not so subtle ploy to change the subject.
Harry’s head shot up and he tensed, immediately. He almost jerked away, but Draco held his hand in place. Every nerve was screaming at him to let go, to stop himself from letting Harry hold his hand, but Draco couldn’t hear them, for his heart was beating too loudly.
“You really think he’s changed?”
He left Harry staring down into his tea. It was cold by the time he took another sip.
“I’m sorry,” she said, running a hand through her fiery hair, “you don’t have to tell me, and I won’t push, but Harry, you can’t just disappear like that.”
Malfoy sighed, dropping his paper into his lap. “What is it, Potter?” Harry realised he’d been staring and dropped his eyes to his hands. “I can tell your desperate to ask questions.”
Ginny nodded. “Well,” she said, after a moment of silence, “I think we should break up.”
Harry chuckled. “I was under the impression that you’d hired me to protect you.”
“Something wrong with it, Potter?” Draco was in no mood to be ridiculed, especially not by the precious chosen one.
“I’m so sorry,” she whispered, “I’m so sorry.”
“I know you said Saturdays,” he said, almost shyly, “but I thought I might stay.”
an old man.”
“Yes Keesy?” He’d freed the other house-elves, not wanting to be reminded of how his father had treated them. He wished he had done so out of the kindness of his heart, but he hadn’t. He’d freed them because he couldn’t face his own guilt, because he was a coward. Keesy had chosen to stay behind with him – she’d said that she had nowhere else to go. She was an odd one really, always eager to look after him. It was nice, sometimes, to have her company. He didn’t deserve her kindness, not after the way he and his family had treated her. “What is it?” Draco asked.
He straightened his tie, sucking in a deep breath. He tried to keep his features blank. “Potter,” he said, “you’re late.”
Harry had to smile back, returning his friend’s enthusiastic greeting. “Did you miss me?”
Harry stared up at Draco, his beautiful features, pale and sculpted, eyes closed as the wind toyed with his hair. God, he wanted to kiss him. To take his face and make him see just how much he deserved to be loved. How much Harry loved him.
“Did you ever have problems, with Ron?” Harry asked, voice very quiet.
Harry folded his arms, huffing a breath. “Next, you'll be telling me that Hobbits were real all along.”
“Ok,” he said, “what’s in it for me?” He drummed his fingers against the desk.
“Keesy’s glad Master Draco is seeing someone new. Keesy was beginning to worry.” The elf’s eyes were wide and searching. Draco shrugged, straightening to stand upright.
Harry stared, almost held his breath. He thought maybe Malfoy would tense up, maybe slam the door. To his surprise, he didn’t. Draco just laughed, shaking his head. Cleary, Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson had some sort of special of standing with Mr Draco Malfoy.
Potter only chuckled, shaking his head.
Apart from that one time. He was right then, but that didn’t matter anymore.
“Off…where?”
“Thanks,” the girl said, eyeing the pair a little confusedly. Nodding to Draco, “Hope you feel better.”
Malfoy was sitting in the living room, newspaper in hand, the very picture of poised elegance. Harry awkwardly shuffled in to stand opposite him. He stared at Draco, not for the first time drinking in the extent of his beauty. There was something inherently turbulent about the nature of his gaze; the intensity raking up both a lively sense of excitement and a thirst for knowledge.
Harry stared down at his drink. The smoke didn’t dance, just sighed against the air between them. Harry could feel the heat brushing the underside of his chin.
Harry shrugged. “I think it adds character.”
(Also, yes, I just had to include mildly jealous Harry. I don't like possessiveness, but a little jealously is always fun.)
“Yes,” Draco drawled, wiping sauce from his cheek, “I’m glad you find this all very amusing.”
“Bodyguard’s orders,” Draco scoffed, “and you’re hardly qualified to tell me—”
What Harry had expected to read was nothing like what he held in his hands. He’d expected a list of ridiculous demands. Instead, there were a total of three bullet points:
“Wizards,” the girl repeated with a frown, “do you have any books on Wizards.” She pulled out a battered copy of ‘
“I’m flattered.”
“Shut up Potter.” He leant his head back and closed his eyes, for the first time thankful that there didn’t seem to be many people in the library. Once he’d managed to control his breathing he straightened his back, steepling his hands against his lower lip. “She said wizards.”
“I don’t see why you’d even think of me.” He sat back in his chair, digging his toe into the carpet like a petulant child.
Harry stared as Malfoy dripped a swirl of honey into the tea, stirring it slowly. He slid the cup towards Harry once he was done, leaning forwards across the table.
“Well,” said Malfoy, “this should be fun.”
“Would Mr Potter like anything to drink?” Keesy asked. Harry’s eyes were still trained solely upon Draco’s features.
Malfoy shuddered against Harry’s side, and he was once again reminded of the job he was supposed to be performing. Before Malfoy could ask what he was doing, Harry secured his grip on his arm, apparating them both away, both for the sake of Malfoy’s safety and his sanity.
Harry’s nod was decisive. “Alright,” he smiled, “Draco, I know you don’t believe it yourself, but I don’t think you’re a bad person. Not anymore.”
Even if Harry could push his love deep down, sure, but he couldn’t quite shake how much he wanted to push him up against a wall, be pushed against a wall. He wasn’t fussy, but he wanted Draco, to taste him. He bet he tasted of something like cinnamon, all sweet and bitter, addictive. Harry almost groaned as he poured his drink, narrowly avoiding spilling it onto the countertop instead.
“I like to think I’m dignified.”
Draco kept his footsteps light, smirking as Harry became far too encapsulated by his emotive reading to notice him rounding the corner, sneaking up behind him.
Harry nodded. “Thank you too.” Neither one of them had ever needed to be forgiven, Harry realised. They’d both just been too lost to let go.
“Yes,” Draco said, “but we also know that Blaise here could never provide an argument compelling enough to win a case.”
Shacklebolt relaxed in triumph. He was a perceptive man, and he knew when he’d won. “Just until we find somebody more permanent and Malfoy’s settled in.”
He placed the letter on the tabletop, nodding to the house-elf. “Thank you, Keesey,” he said gently, “you don’t need to worry. We’ll discuss it.”
Harry could feel Hermione’s eyes on him throughout the day’s proceedings and if he noticed the looks Ron shot him whenever he squirmed at the mention of marriage, he pretended not to have seen them.
Pansy’s laughter was contagious, to Harry at least; Draco was still standing with a sneer surgically attached to his lips, but Harry was wiping tears from his eyes by the time Blaise finally emerged from the manor, disgruntled as ever.
“We, I mean you,” Ginny continued, “you’re more like a brother to me now, though I did love you at the start. After the war, well, I think it put some things into perspective, for the both of us.”
Hope you enjoyed it! Please drop me a comment or kudos if you did!
Potter’s eyes widened slightly. “No, no,” he said quickly, with a smile, “you do have to admit that it’s a little surprising Malfoy.”
Harry perplexed even himself with that admission. Malfoy had changed a lot. He almost felt ashamed of their entire rivalry at school. Well, maybe not all of it.
“Who’s this then?” Alicia asked brightly. She always did like to try to pry into his personal life, so it was altogether unsurprising that she wanted to know about this particular matter. She frowned slightly at Potter’s strange appearance. Draco knew his outfit would cause problems. “He your partner?”
“Are you alright?”
Keesy shook her head enthusiastically. “Oh no, Keesy couldn’t possibly sir. Keesy needs to begin cooking dinner.”
Harry sighed, turning around with one hand on his hip and the other pointing in Draco’s direction with a wooden spoon. “Draco, you’ve been threatened multiple times and they know where you work.” He folded his arms, tapping his foot impatiently. “It’s no wonder you were going to be on edge.”
Harry was going to help Malfoy. He cared, just enough.
In red paint, dripping from the bottom of each letter, were scrawled the words Harry knew Malfoy never wanted to see or hear again. Someone had vandalised the library walls, someone who had found out where Malfoy was now working. The words
Harry shrugged, forcing a smile. “Wasn’t much paperwork.” That was true, there hadn’t been. He swallowed. “How was your day?”
From behind, Ginny cleared her throat. “I’m going out.”
He’d ask Draco about it later.
Draco had never been shown how. It was deemed beneath him. A job for the house-elves.
“Malfoy,” Harry’s concern was quickly drifting towards panic, “what’s going on?”
No, this was not happening, not today. Not ever.
“There are pages to sign there.” Harry scowled, flipping the pages over. The rest were forms regarding the protection of Draco’s privacy as well as his belongings. Harry wasn’t about to sign them without some answers first.
“I uh,” Draco started to clarify, “I invited Blaise and Pansy over. To reconnect.”
“Well, I for one,” Hermione interjected with a toss of her hair, “think it’s about time that the two of them matured past pubescent shouting matches.”
Teddy sniffed, nodding. “Can you…have you ever made it longer? Have you ever changed to look more like a girl?”
“Really mate? You’re not just saying that?” Ron asked him, eyebrow raised.
Harry nodded. She was right, he supposed. Sighing, he took what was left of his coffee and assumed the position opposite to Ginny. “Yeah,” he said, wrapping his hands around the mug, “ok.”
Potter grinned, elbowing Draco in the ribs. “Shut up,” he said.
“Thank you.” He hoped Harry was brave enough to realise the hidden meaning.
“You can always change it as you grow older,” Andromeda said, “and besides, Teddy can be short for Theodora. Would you like that, Theodora?”
Harry didn’t go to Hermione immediately, as really he should’ve done. Instead, he decided to return to Grimmauld, to steel himself, he supposed. Hermione could wait another day. She probably wouldn’t think Draco had kidnapped him until at least a whole week, seven days, had passed.
Merlin.
Kingsley didn’t blink. “His saviour, hopefully.” Harry scowled.
Harry just stared. The light caught Malfoy’s blond hair as he furrowed his brow in concentration. It was like he was performing some important task. What a prick, always had to make a show of everything.
“I’m sorry,” Draco whispered, and Harry nodded.
Malfoy stared at him for a good few seconds before he slumped back in defeat, looking paler than usual. “I knew this would happen,” he said, his voice practically a whisper.”
“Oh, look at the time, I’d best be going Potter.” Malfoy pushed away his chair, draining the last drops from his cup. He slammed his part of the bill down upon the table. His features softened slightly. “It was nice seeing you here, without all the fame that usually follows you.”
Draco nodded, clutching the spoon handle as though it might escape. He poked at the thick noodles sitting in the water, scrunching his nose as they flopped about.
“Goodbye Potter,” he said haughtily. He didn’t look around but heard Potter mutter something incoherent under his breath, “I look forward to seeing you again on Wednesday.” He wasn’t sure that he did.
Draco nodded slowly, gazing at the ceiling, unsure of how to react. “It’s nowhere near as impressive as the library at Hogwarts,” he eventually said.
“Quite.” Draco glanced nervously behind his shoulder.
Hermione laughed, a light sound, one that carried through the breeze. “The prophet would have a field day.”
Ginny hadn’t really understood his need for muggle appliances in their home, but she hadn’t said anything and had even used the kettle herself, a few times. Harry snorted at the memory, when Ginny had been convinced that electricity could never produce a drink as perfectly warmed as magic could. As it turned out, Harry had never needed perfect, and though he was happy to let Ginny boil her own tea, her own way, the electric kettle suited Harry just fine.
“Malfoy, I would if I—”
“I can talk to the ministry—”
“My estimates are never far from perfectly accurate.”
Title loosely taken from Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier which I highly recommend.
“Oh joy,” Malfoy said, though his cheeks were slightly pink, “scavenging off my purchases now are we Potter?”
“Oh, the two of you, do behave!” Mrs Weasley scolded from the head of the table, shaking her head in that way of hers, halfway between judgemental and fond.
He wondered how many times he would have to tell himself that for it to become true again.
“Shut up, Draco.”
“Ted…” Harry started, stopped. “You can change your hair blue, right?”
“No, no,” Draco shook his head, “it’s quite clear to me that Shelley was a necromancer. She merely adapted her story to capitalise on the fears of her society.”
Potter swallowed, considering what Draco was asking. “No,” he admitted, “and I’d rather not talk about it now, either. I just want to be myself for once.”
Malfoy snorted. “Please,” he said, “you look like you’ve just had yourself a good snog.” Malfoy’s eyes widened. “Not that…not that I’ve ever really thought about what you’d look like after that.”
Thursday passed in much the same way as Wednesday did and come Friday, Harry was beginning to find himself growing quite fond of Malfoy, not that he’d come anywhere close to admitting it. He was finding that just watching Malfoy’s enthusiasm when talking to customers was enough to cumulate a warm feeling in his gut. He tried not to think too hard about what it might mean.
Oh, it was far too early for this kind of thing. “I—”
Draco prayed for Gilderoy Lockhart to come and work his magic. Either way, the spell worked, it’d save Draco an awful lot of trouble.
“You have to know a bit about the law,” Blaise mumbled. Pansy pulled a face.
"Harry,” he begged. “Calm. Just calm down, my love. It's going to be okay.”
Draco rose and saw beneath the paws he’d been watching carefully, gasping at what he found when he walked toward Harry.
By the time the Christmas Holidays arrived, he had to admit that they were almost friends; even Flitwick commented on how much better they seemed to be getting along. Harry couldn’t help but admit it. Despite every reason not to, he realised that he actually
"What can I do, Erica?" Draco replied, effectively seeming to calm her and ease her embarrassment.
He sighed and looked out at the fields again.
Barkley simply dropped his head into Draco’s lap.
He crossed his arms and glared, despite the level of trembling he was internally feeling.
“I already told him that,” Pansy interjected. “Look, you two. Focus. We can deal with you in a minute. Harry, you’re
“You horrible brat. You
. Where is he now? God, he doesn’t like...live with you or something?
“First of all, you want to be the one to try and test that? Remember that time I said you were jealous? I wonder how you would feel if you discovered you were
So instead, I offer up my hands
Harry was not wearing a shirt. All other conversations could wait.
Despite his frustration and confusion, Harry grinned as Draco sprang out from under the covers, clad in one of Ron's far-too-large PJ sets and utterly flustered. Flustered Draco was rare. It was also Harry's favourite.
"Well. You don't survive school in Paris without knowing how to handle your hangover potion."
Rose was asleep on his chest by the time he’d finished telling her the whole story. He’d picked her up on instinct when Hermione had been in the kitchen making tea, and she’d calmed immediately. Her presence relaxed him so she’d been there ever since.
The shops on this street were incredibly strange. He wondered what kind of amusement park fun ride he’d ended up in. The names above the doors made no sense, and he could barely see the cobbles for how busy it was. He glanced around him at street signs until he finally discovered one that said held the simple picture of a train, old fashioned and worn but pointing to the East.
“No, no,” Harry protested. “That’s not necessary. I’ll be fine wherever I am—”
Although he was fuming, Draco did note that Marci’s face fell slightly upon hearing this accusation and the sadness was just enough to drag him back to himself. He took a deep breath and slumped down in the chair across from her, head in his hands.
“Harry. Draco.” Neville nodded at both of them, removed his jacket, and sat down before he could change his mind.
No. Scratch that. He knew
He promptly threw up.
That wasn’t what had disquieted him, though. Owen was uncomfortable because, against all sense and reason, he
"Potter,” Malfoy replied suspiciously.
“Every time you open your mouth, it becomes even more obvious that you do not know my father. Does he still believe you’re a squib?”
“You’re ready now, though,” Draco stated. “Why are you doubting that?”
"Must be annoying," he had said. "Being constantly reminded of that day, people treating you like a hero."
The details are specific. The start of a very promising Ministry career, the painful burn out. The decision to try out for the Beacons, the minor league team that doesn't quite understand who they have on their pitch until they are faced with the best Seeker anyone has seen in over thirty years. The quick rise from the lower levels, fame upon fame dragging him out of the gutter against his will.
“Hi, Abrahim,” he said cheerily.
"I love you."
Neville swallowed. Which made Draco chuckle.
“What?” Harry smirked. “I’m pretty sure I already
Draco jolted a little himself. He wasn't used to Potter not picking up the thread of an argument. "I…uh, you go ahead and look first. I've been here before. Pay attention to the windows, not the size. It's Paris, after all.
. You aren’t allowed to hurt him. You have to stop.”
“Theo, you know what I meant," Draco teased, rolling his eyes.
“Good—oh, Draco, good. I need to talk to you before you go out to the floor.”
Draco sputtered for a moment. “I do not need you to… no, you know what, just piss off, Weasley.”
"Do you… do you want me to call?"
“Look,” she interrupted, her therapist veneer slipping just a little as she exhaled in a sound that was very close to exasperation. “You haven’t been in months and now you’ve called me at home during my vacation time. Obviously something is bothering you. So, if you aren’t going to ever open up to me, why am I here, Mr Potter?”
“Unlike his owner.”
"Ginny, don't be ridiculous.” He rolled his eyes. “I can't
“Draco,” he muttered, going as close as he dared to Draco’s ear. “See how many people are gawking at you right now? I promise you, it’s not because you look ‘ridiculous’. You’re fucking perfect. I could put you on stage if I was willing to share. Trust me. You look amazing.”
An uncomfortable silence ensued. Perhaps, he should’ve waited and practiced levitating Steve before producing a corporeal Patronus which had only worn him out. “I could teach you the basics of it – control, focus and the flow and a bit of theory – which you continue to ignore.”
.’ He had always believed that there was light in the dark. And dark in the light.
"Mhm, yes." Draco said with a short laugh while they turned to the rhythm. For once, it felt like there were less eyes on them. Like there was just one single tree in the forest.
"Draco, baby, have you seen my hoodie? The red one you were wearing yesterday? I swear I'd left it right here but now it's gone!" Yelled out from the bedroom while Draco was in said hoodie.
“Or how you read the cliché poems when I can’t sleep after a nightmare.”
Tom. Tom Riddle. Voldemort. He fished out the pocket-watch (or at least it was a pocket-watch to the eye), and stared at it. He couldn’t fucking believe it.
They were both panting heavily, the adrenaline still raging in their blood circulation but with a hint of something more that made them both still. The laughter died down slowly as he found himself staring at the grey eyes. A second longer. Another.
“It’s not the saviour complex,” Harry said with a soft snort while he cast a glance at Draco in faint concern when the blond stifled a grunt of pain. Perhaps, the Patronus had worn him out. “Plus, the operative word was wanted and I can’t focus on career options when I'm not certain if I'll survive in the war, can I?"
Another laugh.
A price? He wanted to know, but the air around them was tense. He couldn’t resist a quip: “If you drew a sketch of Voldemort wearing a dress –
Draco pointed his wand at the book, casting a simple levitation charm and directing it into the bedroom and frowned when the watch started to create a resistance, weighing the paperback down.
“I can catch-on fast.”
“You’re never letting it go, are you?”
Draco winced. He was downright anxious, and even bit into his bottom-lip, keeping his gaze on the brunet. He felt a brief rush of panic flaring through his body. “I was protecting you, Potter.”
conversation.
“It astounds me, that you’ve solved so many riddles over the years.”
“You were distracting me!”
Harry turned his gaze to the photograph on the mantle.
Harry Potter, however, wasn't focused on the music or the stars. Instead, he was rather focused on Draco Malfoy, who was, without a doubt, a sight to behold. He was wearing a beautiful, black, long, one shoulder, slit dress which accented him perfectly.
Harry nicked a warm cloak, and walked out of the house. He wanted to get away even jf only for a moment. Otryazan was surging with ancient magic. It was overwhelming. Overpowering. He didn’t want a place to hold that kind of power over him. He wouldn’t give in. And he wanted a distraction. A distraction from his thoughts and Malfoy.
The blond frowned, and the corner of his lip twitched. In retrospect, he should’ve known that the cup would be in the manor. It would’ve saved him the trouble.
Draco paused the movie, and turned to face him. The Malfoy-ish way of ‘asking for one chocolate’ was cutting a deal. “I don’t want to eat the so-called chocolates.”
In the morning, he didn’t leave a note with the crepes at breakfast. Yes, crepes. Because Malfoy would specifically expect a sardonic note with crepes. And he hadn’t written one.
A distraction would probably work. He didn’t want to think of the artifact. And it wasn’t a fucking watch, he was in denial and he didn’t want to voice the truth in his mind or out loud.
” Potter said with an uncertain edge to his voice, carding his fingers through the jet-black hair to tame it. A vain effort. “I – I want to focus on the complex ones.”
1996. Third of December. Stars. Silver. The whisper. Light of a thousand falling stars. A missing piece of the puzzle.
His eyes widened, as a blue light hit him in the chest. He stumbled backwards, and his vision was out of focus.
“Oh, of course.” He stared at the brunet; one eyebrow ever so slightly quirked “I had a certain set of obligations to my family. Not that you would know because you don’t have one.”
“I want you to tell me what we wished for on the falling stars,” He said, interlacing their fingers together and peering into the familiar grey eyes. Beautiful grey eyes. “Or I want to wish on the stars once again, if you will.”
He walked back to the house. A bit of magic had cleared his head. He wasn’t stressing over the argument. He had an impending doom hanging over his head, and he didn’t want to add Malfoy to the list of crises he had to deal with. He had to rest. Not worry.
One of Voldemort’s seven horcruxes.
“I don’t need a thousand falling stars.”
He had summoned the whipped cream in the morning, but he hadn’t been focused on the magic. He had wanted to gain a tiny victory over Malfoy. It shouldn’t be a task to summon a seashell. To his dismay, it was a task. And a problematic one at that.
“I’m not – do you want a trip down memory lane where you were a school bully, or the times you’ve tried to ridicule or maim-slash-seriously-injure my best friends and I, Malfoy?”
No ‘Good morning, sunshine – I love you.’? He couldn’t even recall if he’d done anything wrong. He didn’t suppose that Harry was being an arse on purpose.
He could walk out of the house, towards the shore and argue with Potter. Despite the white-hot rage in him, he didn’t. He couldn’t risk another argument. Not after the last one.
“I said I was sorry for how I reacted.” He felt a small, dull ache in the chest. “One sorry, might not cut it,” If the floor could open up and swallow him whole, it’d be preferable to the current situation. “I was –”
“Oh, it certainly was.”
When the brunet ended it with a soft exhale, Draco raised his head with a slow yawn. He cleared his throat as he created a bit of distance. “You’re up.”
Draco felt the familiar itch to snap at Potter and say something hurtful, something to refute the accusation. “I didn’t intend to poison the Weasel and I did not want the necklace to hex Katie Bell.”
“Oh, what – to write about my hair care or skin care routine?” Draco refuted in the a spur of moment, which caused a small, brief smirk to form on Harry’s face. “Salazar fuck –” It elicited a soft groan. “
He, however, wasn't good with reassurances. In fact, he wasn't good with words. He could come up with a quip to lighten the situation. Yet, he had an odd constriction in the throat and he couldn't force out the words. So, he waited. Reconsidered. "No, wait, why wouldn't I -" He could barely maintain an even tone, "Oh, for Godric's sake, why wouldn't I care, Draco?"
“Oh, can you fucking
Harry snorted, an amused smirk playing on his lips. “You – Draco Malfoy – My arch nemesis – The little blond lesbian from the snake house – draped a blanket over me at night?”
He opened his eyes with a soft smile on his face. It was calming to have a sky of your own fancy.
“We’re sworn rivals, Potter.”
A beautiful silver stag was standing before him, as he opened his eyes. It circled around him, and he gave it a weak smile. He pressed his back against the rough bark to steady himself, his vision unfocused. His hand was trembling, and his knees felt weak.
“I can recall the short conversation,” It was a rather one-sided conversation, considering Draco Malfoy had a proper upbringing and had a clear – if prejudiced – idea of the wizarding world. “what’s your point?”
“Fuck off, Potter.”
Instead, he wanted to feel something familiar. Something to remind him of the easier times, when he wasn’t hearing his own bones straining under the weight of the war. Something closer to home. Closer to Hogwarts.
“I always distract you,” Draco reminded him, and scoffed. “You’re such a sore loser, Potter.”
It was a quip, and it caused the blond to scoff. “I don’t think I can cast a corporeal one. We were supposed to learn it in the fifth-year.”
Draco smiled, twirling Harry slowly around again. "Then let me steal your air and make you breathless."
“Aren’t you supposed to be braiding your hair or wasting ten canisters of hair gel on it or whatever? I’m quite surprised you didn’t trap yourself in your bedroom/tower.”
They danced through the entire night, both feeling oddly comfortable in the other's arms. They swirled and swayed, rather like the snowflakes that continued to spin down from the inky black sky, scattered with pinpricks of light. Harry smiled as he looked up at the stars, noticing how the moonlight settled down upon Draco's hair, making a halo of moonbeams dance around his head.
He placed the note in a box on the side-table adjacent to his bed with the first one and closed his eyes as he felt another headache. The closer he was to the erased memories, the more it hurt.
The sky was slightly darker when a light of a star faded. It wouldn’t be, if the light never existed.
He poured the tea into the cup and with a faint smile, he walked into the bedroom. “Here, Potter. You should get some rest. It’s your third cup of tea.”
He didn’t have proper control over wandless magic. Of course, accidental magic was different. He chuckled, as his mind traced back to Aunt Marge – She had an inflated ego, and he wanted her to get over it. In hindsight, ‘inflated’ wasn’t the best choice of thought.
The tea was – perfect. It had a bit of extra sugar and a cap of milk.
a skin care routine?” He repeated with a short contemplative stare. Of course, Draco had a routine for self-care. “I’ll interview you on it if I start a career in journalism, Malfoy.”
Awkward rooftop conversations between these two, just-
“I don’t have a to-do list.”
He turned to face the blond. The setting sun turned Malfoy’s hair gold – added color to his skin – and he had a glint in his eyes. “Not your concern, Malfoy, and correct your stance – it’s off.”
The mere thought of the D.A caused a warmth to course within. It was a small act of rebellion. It was a brilliant ‘
“I – Well, have you packed?” Draco asked, a smirk playing on his lips. “You’re ridiculous at packing.”
“Mhm,” He said, glancing at the oven. The scent of chocolate was drifting in the air, and he wanted to finish off the cookies at once. “Pleased with yourself are you, Potter?”
“Aren’t you cold?” Harry asked, burying his head in Draco’s shoulder. The blond drew him even closer.
“You never asked me to stay.”
“Yes, Potter.” Malfoy said with a long sigh, not quite thrilled with the interruption. “It’s spontaneous, which is the reason you obtain a sporadic result and it wears you out – control it – will it to obey you.”
Draco Malfoy had a
A short, amused laughed escaped Draco's lips. "We can continue dancing inside too, you know."
Harry glared at him. It didn’t work, because he was immune to the glares or the threats. “You finished all of the M&M’s? All of them?”
“Oh, I’m frightening?”
Ron and Hermione were the two stars in the sky of his fancy and if the stars faded, the brightest lights would go out. If the two lights faded, he wasn’t certain if he even wanted stars in his star-filled sky.
Harry falls asleep in Draco's room.
Harry covered it with his fingers. He could feel the warmth underneath the fingertips. It was pulsating. Almost similar to a second heartbeat. “I warned you not to touch it.”
“Yeah, it has nothing to do with the fact that you fixed the fucking Vanishing Cabinet, providing a way for the Death Eaters to infiltrate the school. You didn’t care about anyone else or the damage it would cause.”
“If I could shift, I fucking would.” Draco’s voice was sort of strained, yet it had a final tone to it. The prat wouldn’t shift and considering the brunet’s sides were in pain it was wiser
“Oh, shut up.”
“Bold of you to assume that I won’t toss you into the sea.”
She would be a lot calmer as she cleaned the house and hummed along with the music. She was a little tolerant and wouldn’t yell as much. And it was the only reason he still liked the song.
“It’s not – I – I can’t think about him.”
He whispered all of the ‘sappy endearments’ as Draco fell asleep with his head on Harry’s shoulder, a soft smile on his face.
The door creaked, as he closed it. He brushed a strand of hair out of his face, and arched an eyebrow at Malfoy. He was on the couch, reading a paperback with his nose scrunched up.
The blond directed yet another warning glare and he couldn’t resist a short, amused laugh. It sounded more like a bark, really. “If I nicely ask you to dial it down a notch, will you?”
Another fight? Yeah but is okay, it's Draco and Harry, what do you really expect?
“Who gifted Holding the man to you?” He asked with a frown, flipping to the first page and back to the one he was reading. “I assume – no, I’m certain it was a gift.”
Malfoy tilted his head to the sky, closing his eyes for a brief minute and exhaling slowly. The corner of the mouth downturned, and his voice cracked when he said, “I – erm – Yes. I’m still mourning father.”
“I – what?”
“Or the front page of The Prophet.”
“Wicked witch of the west – You didn’t – You’re referring to The Dark Lord as the wicked witch of the west?”
It wasn’t enough. It would never be enough. He couldn’t cast spells without draining himself and he couldn’t even apparate because of the magic surrounding this place.
"You should continue to wear the dress when Harry Potter fancies you in it.”
Yet, it was. Even if he could contradict it in front of Potter, he couldn’t find a way to contradict his own mind about it – It caused a flicker of panic – Draco Malfoy was concerned about Harry Potter.
“It’s – it was a period of innocence,” He paused for a second, chewing on the lower lip and he half-turned to face Potter with a frown etched on the face. “now, everything has changed.”
"Sweetheart, let me do it, you'll end up burning the pan." This was delivered with a soft kiss on Draco's cheek and Harry being indignantly shoved away from the stove.
"Darling, you know that distracting me with a kiss still counts as cheating, right?" Followed by a fondly exasperated laugh when Draco simply shrugged and acted like he had no clue what Harry was on about. And they continued their game of poker.
“Yeah, I don’t. Your death, on the contrary, would be a minor inconvenience. We don’t want the Chosen One to die, do we?” He said in a slow drawl. “The fate of the wizarding world rests upon you.”
He could hear the smile in Draco’s voice when he said, “Oh, Of course – who would you show off your overachieving abilities in Quidditch, sarcasm and Patronus charms to if not your favorite Slytherin?”
’ overpower him. He wasn’t even Peter Pan. And Malfoy wasn’t Tinkerbell. Or was he?
The glint in Potter’s eyes was downright revolting. If conjuring a Patronus hadn’t worn him out, he would’ve hexed the brunet. Or he would’ve come up with creative insults. “I can’t tolerate your sarcasm. Not now.”
“You –” He had a small crack to the voice and a flicker of confusion crossed the features for a brief second, the composure shifting slightly. In an uncertain voice, he said, “we’re not –” A pause. “friends yet, are we?
He didn’t know of a vaguely dim star, staring to form in his pitch-black sky.
He wasn’t with Ron and Hermione. He was in Otryazan with Draco Malfoy. Was Draco a friend? Could he forget the six years of animosity? He had considered it once or twice. Yet, he wasn’t certain. Could he trust Draco?
“No, I had to finish your sentence,” Draco said with a soft sigh, carding the fingers through the hair. “Of course, I’m not fond of your clever, sarcastic side, yet, it’s a tad bit bearable than your
“If you wouldn’t be so hellbent on staring at my arse, then you would’ve learnt it by now.”
, focus on levitating the red conical seashell.”
.” He said with a fake-dramatic gasp. “I’m wounded.”
Harry frowned at the parchment – The third of December, 1996 – He traced his mind back to the sixth year. Yet, he couldn’t pinpoint the events. It was sort of blur. A lot of events of 1996 were a blur. It didn’t add up. He couldn’t place it.
“You offered to be friends with the prat, Potter”
Harry was, however, certain he wouldn’t form proper sentences for the rest of the night if he was with Draco Malfoy. “Can we –” He inched closer to the blond. “can we dance?”
He glared at Malfoy, and sent a jet of whipped cream on his ‘oh-so perfect’ platinum blond hair.
Malfoy was an amusing mix of confusion with a hint of rage and a small uncertain smile on his lips. “Go on then, I want to hear it. It’ll be easier to decide if I want to laugh or kill you.”
“I’m the king of kicking ass,” Draco proudly declared, but promptly got hit in the face with a snowball only seconds later.
infuriating qualities. “you’re frightening, Malfoy.”
“I’m not,” Malfoy said, as he narrowed his eyes at him. Right on cue. “The slice of lemon on the side of the cup, and the perfect mix of hot and sweet – How did you know?”
Draco scowled, yet it was replaced with a similar concerning frown when Potter’s teeth chattered and the lean body started to tremble. “We should continue with the Patronus.”
Draco snorted. He shouldn’t have said it last night, because Potter could be utterly infuriating if he decided to be, and he was excessively sarcastic – A trait he fucking loathed because Potter would always have clever sardonic retorts. “Yeah. Too fucking soon, Potter.”
did draco soften for a second?
Draco scoffed, muttering a few curses in French which was an incentive to rile him up or to earn a reaction out of Potter, yet the brunet was only shaking his head in wry amusement. “so, now the curses don’t affect you?”
“You don’t sleep much, do you?”
“I – forget it, Potter.” Harry felt a small throb in the chest. “perhaps, you and I –” Draco’s fingers circled around the doorknob and he twisted it slowly. “I was right, we can’t be friends.”
“Your eyes – One of the irises – it’s blue.”
Draco’s gaze flickered towards the couch, where Potter was curled up comfortably with his eyes closed. A soft sigh escaped his slightly parted lips, and he relaxed further into the red blanket.
He nicked a warm coat by the door, and walked out of the house. As the door closed behind him, he exhaled and walked a little further. “Having an existential crisis, Potter?”
“I’m not here to kill you.”
Malfoy laughed, as he placed the crepe on the plate. He placed the strawberries in the middle, and summoned the chocolate syrup, drizzling it over the strawberries with a oh-so familiar smirk.
In that moment – He knew. He knew that there was a lot more to Draco Malfoy than he let on.
Malfoy snorted, and gave a slight shake to his head. “To what do I owe the – What is the opposite of pleasure?”
Harry frowned. “I’m flipping the crepe, what are you doing?”
He couldn’t think of Sirius. It was stark reminder of the casualties in the war. Of the one family he had lost. The only family. He could never have a proper family.
Harry enclosed his lips on Draco’s; soft yet immersive, gentle yet powerful all the same.
“It was a smile.” He said in soft amusement, a corner of his mouth upturned. “I’m certain, you –” The lights of the room flickered for a second, “found it humorous.” He cast a careful glance around the kitchen, “or it was sort of humorous,” another flicker, “I’m rather pleased with myself.”
He softened when he detected a slight tremble in Malfoy’s voice. In retrospect, he should’ve specified the reason. “It’s not because you’re a Death Eater. It’s not.”
“Yes, Sherlock. I was in the cabinet and will you quit solving
“Can I have one of –
Harry cursed under his breath, carding fingers through his jet-black hair in frustration. He wanted to nudge him awake, or push him off but he didn’t. He couldn’t.
Hermione would’ve figured it out. Would’ve figured out what it was. He wished Ron and Hermione were with him. Seven years. Seven years with a family. Not friends. A family.
It shot up in the air and dropped down, and he felt a surge of magic go through him. He had levitated it, but he had minimal control over the spell. He hadn’t controlled the intensity of the magic.
"Yeah?"
“Your face is screwed up in an unpleasant manner.”
The warmth was reducing, and the artifact rested lightly in his pocket – Almost as if it wasn’t there – And the rage subsided slowly.
A flicker of rage flared in him, “Oh, now we’re friends, Malfoy?” He resisted the urge to hex Draco’s mouth shut, “now, when you –” He softened for a brief second when Draco rested his forehead on his shoulder, which intensified the ceaseless flutter, “Draco can you trust me for two seconds?”
“Yes,” Draco drawled, a playful smirk on his face. “I’m going to hit you with a knife.”
Harry couldn’t provoke Malfoy. Breaking teacups wouldn’t work either. He had to use a clever incentive to force Malfoy out of the bedroom and it had to be subtle.
Harry cursed under his breath. He wasn’t intending to converse with Malfoy. Yet, the blond had shared one of the fondest memories he had with Narcissa, hadn’t he?
“Yeah, of course it’s our secret,” He whispers while placing soft kisses on the back of Draco’s hand, interlacing the fingers. “yet, I want to come out and I want the others to know you’re mine and I’m yours – forever.”
Harry drew his lips in a thin line, and frowned. The world assumed that he would be the light. The hero. Brave and courageous. In his own mind, was he the hero? Or had he shaped himself to be one? Who was he before? Not ‘The chosen one’ or ‘The boy who lived’ or ‘The savior’. He was Harry.
"Well yeah, essentially, and you haven't set me on fire in my sleep yet so I count that as a yes." An attempt to lighten the situation. Smooth but also reckless in the most Harry Potter way possible.
now?”
He was desperate to perfect it. Instead of waiting around, he wanted to overpower the Island and find a fucking way out. Plus, he didn’t want to be vulnerable, considering he didn’t have a wand.
He placed the teacup with the spectacles on the kitchen counter, and closed his eyes only to feel an intense pain in his head. He clenched his fists to the side and cursed, barely resisting the urge to punch a fucking wall. Or Malfoy. Or – oh, it was the watch. It was the fucking watch.
Draco answered casually, as if it wasn't a major confession. After all, maybe to him it wasn't. He'd had since the beginning of the Triwizard Tournament to realize just how much Harry Potter meant to him and since the First Task to come to terms with it. Harry nodded, looking up at Draco curiously again.
cares about him
The painting of the sky didn’t leave his mind.
"Of course you can, sweetheart,” Pansy said as she rose from her chair, placing a small kiss on Draco's cheek. "couldn't resist, could you, Potter?"
Malfoy let out a low snort, and directed a glare at him. It didn’t work. Harry laughed. Malfoy smiled. And it caused a tiny flutter in his chest. He ignored it.
A pause.
“And you let me break your fucking jaw because you were familiar with that rage.”
“Oh, shut up.”
, you’re fond of mundane fairy-tales, aren’t you – the ones with happy endings?”
“Or what?”
He had to practice more if he wanted to perfect it. The summoning charm, however, was the one charm he hated - second to the flutters in his chest around Malfoy – It was fucking infuriating, to put it mildly. It hadn’t been easy with a wand, in fourth year. It was a nightmare without a wand.
Draco didn’t laugh. He didn’t comment on it. It was familiar to him – To be scared of your own dreams. To wake up in cold sweat, with a scream caught in your throat and being frightened of your mind as it weaves a nightmare as an aftermath of the demons you’ve faced. Of the mistakes you’ve made.
“The cup?” Draco said with a snort. “Oh sure, it’s a dark artefact which
“Er,” Malfoy said, and paused for a brief minute and cursed under his breath as he scratched the back of his neck awkwardly. “You’re the chosen one, of course it’s satisfying to –
“Alright – I ate one. And I ate another. And another –
He didn’t reply. Instead, he closed his eyes and exhaled softly. “We have our own ways of dealing with grief. And I knew that you wouldn’t cry. You wanted to channel the grief into another emotion.”
“Any other ideas? I’m don’t have much of an appetite.”
"Probably because I was an arse, isn't it?"
He decided to practice wandless magic, considering he couldn’t move for a while. Plus, he wanted to work on a complex spell – Complex, yet familiar – The Patronus Charm.
He couldn’t deal with the next stab of pain. It was overwhelming. He didn’t want to fucking care whether Potter despised him or not. Yet, he did. Only a little. “Fuck off, Potter.”
He sipped his tea, as he stared at the canvas. Out of all the skies, he had painted the one of Potter’s fancy. Why? Why had his mind wandered to the night near the sea – A moment of vulnerability – When he had asked Potter if he had a sky of his own?
He carded his fingers through the hair with a soft sigh, sort of reluctant to continue with the conversation. Yet, Draco was in front of him, with a trace of curiosity, a sculpted, pale brow raised artfully, waiting for a response or a sarcastic quip. “well, Potter?”
There was another pause. Malfoy’s Adam’s apple bobbed in the light, and he had ducked his head. It was sort of a white flag. A parley. They both returned to staring at the sea. It gleamed menacingly in the dawn light.
“On the sand after the not-so graceful fall where you
“Don’t fret over it, Potter. It’s not your concern.”
"Why?"
Harry scowled at the note Malfoy had left for him. His eyes flickered to the plate on kitchen counter. Malfoy had barely touched it. He crumbled the parchment, and tossed it aside. He hadn’t signed up to deal with Draco Malfoy and he would’ve killed Lucius for the trouble he had decided to put him through, if he wasn’t already dead. The work of Voldemort himself. He wasn’t even remotely pleased to have to put up with his arch-rival of six years. He was insufferable.
He desperately wanted to get out of Otryazan. And he didn’t have a wand to enhance his magic. To make it easier. Practicing wandless magic was insanely tiring.
In an hour, he was piling two plates with scrambled eggs, sausage, baked beans, potatoes and he cast a warming charm on one of the plates. Malfoy wouldn’t deign to touch the plate. Or maybe he would. Harry couldn’t decide.
“It’s – fuck – it’s not because you’re a death eater.” He said in the spur of a moment. A small, tiny part of him couldn’t trust Malfoy for a certain reason. “it’s self-preservation.”
“Draco,” A soft familiar voice said, and he half-turned to face the brunet, watching him with a small smile and leaning on the rough bark of the closest tree. “try again.”
“If it wasn’t true,” Draco whispered softly with a bit of confusion in the voice, stuttering out a breath, fingers curling into the white sweater, “you wouldn’t’ve said it.”
“No,” He warned, and let out a high-pitched sound. “Truce, Truce!”
If he could find a way out, he would continue the hunt alone. He didn’t want any further casualties in the war. It was the chaos he had to deal with on his own and he didn’t want to have to rely on the others.
Harry snatched the can, and pointed it at the blond. Malfoy backed away, and gave him a warning glare. “It was an accident, Potter. Don’t you dare –
“Don’t pretend you don’t know what I want answers to,” he inched closer to Draco. Felt the beginning wrenches of anger twist in his gut. “Besides, I’d rather not repeat myself, Malfoy.”
It caused a flicker of curiosity in Draco, yet he maintained a mien of indifference on the face. He was certain it was the artifact and he intended to find out what it was, considering it certainly wasn’t a normal pocket-watch.
“Oh, who would?”
“Yes,” He said, peering into the confused grey eyes. He chuckled, as he said in a soft voice, “If it’s a sad ending, why shouldn’t it mean it isn’t beautiful?”
“– I didn’t pretend to be a dementor – ”
Harry snorted.
“Y-yeah.” Malfoy had a pink tint on the cheeks. It was faint. Perhaps, it was the cold. “yeah, sure.”
Draco sent an elbow to his ribs and it caused the brunet to grimace with yet another yelp of pain.
Draco didn’t leave a note.
Draco had closed his eyes for a brief minute to focus on it and he had drifted off to sleep, ending up closer to the brunet and unconsciously resting his head on the slender shoulder. Oh, he wished he hadn’t closed his eyes.
“If I fall on the ice again –
“But we’re not friends either, are we?” Draco had an unsure, wobbly voice. Sort of impatient. He shifted in place, arching a pale eyebrow.  “are we, Potter?”
“Oh, we can continue.”
The contact wasn’t supposed to feel right. It shouldn’t, considering it was Draco Malfoy. Yet, it did. It was unfamiliar, yet comfortable and the proximity caused a twinge in his chest. Oh, how he despised the twinge.
“I prefer the balanced ones,” He said in a soft voice. “A bit of angst, and a bit of content. It shouldn’t necessarily be a perfect ending. It can be sad, and it would still be beautiful.”
His throat was constricted. Yes, Draco never let his walls down and he was misunderstood by many in the wizarding world. To them, he was a death eater. He was tainted. To Harry – He was Draco Malfoy, an enormous but lovable pain in the arse.
“You won’t find a way out, Potter.”
“I enchant you.”
Draco couldn’t resist the slow grin forming on the mouth. “Yes, well, perhaps I’m fond of mundane fairy-tales about a love, genies, and flying carpets or a lost princess with magical hair now.”
A flicker of hurt flashed across Potter’s face as he retracted his hand. The warmth lingered for one second. Only for one fucking second. “I don’t pity you, Malfoy.”
“It’s not my fault that you think you’re better than everyone else, Malfoy.”
It elicited a soft groan. If he couldn’t touch the pocket-watch and considering it was on the top of the novel, a levitation charm should work fine. "
“Yes, Frodo.” Draco said with a sarcastic drawl. “Blaise gifted it on my fifteenth birthday, and if we’re quite finished with the pleasantries, why don’t you find a way back to the shire?”
badge. His fingers quivered and curled around the right handle and paced over to the room.
"Don't you think you've brewed enough potions for the day? Come to bed, baby." This was mumbled against Draco's lips after Harry had pulled him away from his cauldron.
“Crepes for lunch?”
He raised the trembling fingers to his forehead to wipe a streak of sweat and heard a few whispers in the classroom, yet they sounded rather distant. He forced it out of his mind and stared at the cauldron as he exhaled slowly.
The familiar fear coursed within him, and he had to focus on the crash of the waves to send the thoughts out of his mind. On Draco’s warmth and the soft snores.
“So, you’re not the overachieving Chosen One I resented in Hogwarts?”
“Malfoy I –”
The flutters didn't cease. It never did. It was a royal fucking pain in the arse.
“No dead Chosen One.”
Anywho, thank you for the kudos and reading it so far!
To save his family.
, we’re not friends or
on me,” It wasn’t accusatory. It was soft, and almost pained. And it caused a pang of guilt in his chest. “and I still couldn’t find a way to detest you, Potter.”
Harry snorted, a low, humourless laugh escaping his throat. Yeah, Lucius Malfoy didn’t hand over his head to Voldemort on a silver platter, but being here wasn’t thrilling either. It was slowing him. He had to destroy the horcruxes. Now, he couldn’t. “Yeah, after he put it in danger.”
A realization dawned on him when he repeated it in his head. He had fucking implied he was focused on Harry Potter in the Yule Ball, fourth year. "Isn't your proudest moment to admit you were staring at the Chosen One in the yule ball, is it?"
“I would’ve prepared breakfast instead of conjuring a patronus but you drifted off to sleep in the middle of a fairy-tale and I don't suppose I could've left you out on the rooftop, could I?”
Over the course of five weeks, the mutual resentment had reduced. He was comfortable with Draco’s presence who was sort of sufferable – minus the french curses.
And Malfoy curved his lips into the all too familiar smirk. “Don’t get used to it, Potter.”
Harry smirked, raking his gaze over Malfoy with an intensity, probably making him feel exposed in a way that he was not sure he would ever be comfortable with, his green gaze piercing straight through him.
Draco cursed under his breath. He had tossed the parchment aside instead of leaving it on the kitchen counter. And he wouldn’t admit it out loud, but the notes were an effort. An effort to have a subtle conversation – A banter – instead of an apology.
He gazed out of the window, and at the sunset. As the sun dipped lower, it illuminated a quivering path across the water. It bathed the ocean's meek waves and the wispy clouds in a soft shade of red.
“Malfoy, will you get me a cup of tea?” Harry was skimming through one of the files on the bed, with a scowl on his face. He glanced at Draco briefly, with an apologetic grin. “I’m tired.”
“Right, I’ll consider it as a back-up career,” If he could trash himself in the Prophet for a good laugh, it was a good back-up career option. Besides, it’d be a definite improvement from the fictitious news of how he was the
Oh, for Circe’s sake, Malfoy
“No, No,” Harry said, taking Draco’s trembling hands into his own steady ones and his thumb strokes the back of his hand in a slow rhythm. “It’s okay.”
Harry smiled in that dopey way Ron always calls him out for, complaining he looks lovesick, "Oh do you now, baby."
Harry couldn’t resist a faint smile – It was progress – One week ago, he couldn’t stand the blond and now, he was offering Malfoy to walk to the seashore with him for a bit of fresh air. “No promises.”
Harry twisted the doorknob slowly, and walked into the bathroom. It was dimly light, and he could hear the soft sobs at a small distance.
Subtle – He didn’t expect a proper compliment – Yet a subtle one was fine.
“Oh no, we’re not writing a code of conduct.” Draco whispered with a soft groan and a variation of curses in French. “and you,
Harry scowled, and clenched his fists. Rage pulsed through his veins. Lucius Malfoy wouldn’t save him because he was noble. He never could be. He had an ulterior motive. “I’d rather die than be here with you.”
"You."
Malfoy let out a snort. A silence engulfed them, pregnant and uncomfortable. The blond peered into his eyes, glaring at him curiously.
“Sort of, yeah.”
Silence.
“I’ll find a way out,” He said with a relented sigh, carding his fingers through the unruly black hair falling over the right eye. “If I want to win the war, considering the fate rests on the so-called Chosen One.”
His stomach clenched at the intensity of his emotions. Draco clenched his jaw, all the things he wants to say failing to fall onto his tongue but tumbling around in his head. The air was stagnant in its silence. “Is it because I was an arse to you in Hogwarts?”
“Are you afraid of your dreams?”
Harry didn’t want to risk being splinched in the process of apparition, but he meant what he had said yesterday – He would rather get splinched or die than be here with Draco Malfoy. He couldn’t stand that arsehole. Apparition was the only way.
"One day," Draco whispered against his ear, in a soft voice laced with a promise. "I want our fantasies to be real, and I know that it'll be worth the wait. You will be worth the wait, Harry."
or the
“It’s going to hurt nothing, but your pride.” Harry said with a snort. He skated backwards carefully and he skated forwards with him. Draco watched his feet carefully as he did, trying to mimic his movements. He drew the blond to one side, watching him as they skated alongside each other. This time Draco definitely had more balance and seemed to be skating easier.
With a soft groan, he turned to face Draco Malfoy. He was slightly tense, and focusing on the potion. He had an odd sort of relationship with the blond. Not rivals. Or acquaintances. It was a mutual decision to call a truce. “I am focusing, Malfoy. I was only distracted.”
I love Steve, he's very helpful<3
He snorted, as he turned to face Draco. He was worn out, and had dark rings under his eyes. “A perpetual one. Is it bothering you, Malfoy?”
“Harry, I –
“If you don’t care, it shouldn’t bother you.”
"No," Harry said, slightly disappointed. "I suppose we can't."
He chuckled, and gave a slight shake to his head. His gaze was soft, as it landed on Draco. He knew, that Harry was unsure about moving to New York. And Draco didn’t want to let him go.
Harry let it slide. He scrambled to his feet, his knees trembling slightly. God, he should’ve saved the wandless Patronus for later. “Upset, Malfoy?”
“I’m assuming you had to do a lot of research –
“I’d rather not,” He placed the cup on the edge of the bed, one finger on the base. It had a faint throb. A second heartbeat. “the prophet writes enough articles about the chosen one and I’d rather not add on to it.”
“You’ve been calling me Rapunzel – I want to know.”
Rooftop conversations
“Bless your observational skills, Draco.” Harry said, with a sarcastic drawl. “I would’ve never noticed.”
“Don’t. I – I don’t want your fucking pity.” Draco exhaled softly and closed his eyes, only to open them as he felt another brush of fingertips and a soft touch on his arm, and he flinched slightly. “Don’t fucking touch me.”
A death eater was firing spells at him, and he was barely dodging them. Yet, he wasn’t scared. He had managed to get Ron and Hermione out of the manor, with the prisoners. His lips curved into a satisfied smirk, and he stunned the death eater.
He had seen a minuscule piece of the memories in a blur flash – It was a simple obliviation charm – He had to figure it out.
“Oh, shut up.”
’ crap,” Draco’s voice cracked and the composure shifted slightly. “Can you not, Harry?”
Anyways, thank you for the kudos and comments to far<3
Harry cocked his head to the side in confusion, and stared at Malfoy. “A what?”
He closed his eyes, as he thought about a sky of his own. “Beautiful. A perfect mix of deep violet and black. Alive with raw energy – Stars lighting the sky like snow-flakes. Chaos – infinite and eternal. Yet, the stars aren’t bright.”
Harry only laughed harder. A lot more than required. “You’ve never flipped a crepe before?”
The stars were fading, slowly and all at once. He wasn’t afraid of the stars – they were beautiful – he was afraid of having a bright star or a moon in his sky, and watching its light fade.
“Oh, shut up.”
to accept that he was a moronic fuck. “Oh, open to criticism now, are you?”
out of concern in cold weather, and it was sort of confusing.
“Graceful as always, aren’t we?”
“No, you don’t, and neither do I – if you want me to trust you, earn it for yourself – It’s not a one-way street. I’ll earn yours; you earn mine.”
Thank you for the comments and kudos so far<3
“The Patronus – It’s a stag,” He said with a brief pause, staring at the sort of faded wisps of clouds. The sky was canvas-like painted with warm colours. “because my dad was an Animagus stag.”
“Okay, Stuart Little – wait, he was a mouse and you’re a fucking ferret – Stuart The Ferret is rather fitting and if I die, you should write ‘
The wisps of silver smoke curled out of the wand, hovering in the air for a brief minute or two and vanished in the air. “what the – oh, fuck it – I can’t.”
The sound reached to his consciousness and he absent-mindedly curled his fingers into the maroon sweater the brunet was wearing with the faintest smile and he shifted a bit.
Draco was sprawled on the sand, a frown creasing his forehead, mouth curled into a well-practiced smirk, yet the malevolent glint wasn’t present in his eyes. “Need a hand, Malfoy?”
“Or what, Potter?”
The blond offered him a curt nod and he returned to the novel, flipping to the next page and muttered, “It’s a gay romance.”
A mix of violet and black with a chaos of stars – A sky which was familiar – why had Draco Malfoy painted a sky of Harry Potter’s fancy? “If you find a way out of Otryazan, will you win the war?”
, Harry Potter confessed that Draco Malfoy has a
Another pause.
An odd sort of guilt stirred in him, as his mind traced to the brief flicker of hurt across Malfoy’s face. He should’ve calculated his words carefully. He had been insensitive and sort of irritated. Not that it was an excuse or – wait – He didn’t care about Malfoy. It wasn’t supposed to trouble him. It shouldn’t. Yet, it did.
Harry arched an eyebrow at him. His first instinct was to laugh. The second was to decline the offer with a quip or a retort. However, he settled for the third. “At what price?”
“No, wait. In the current – what’s it called –” A beat. “episode of
“Or to be in a world where you need a little faith, trust and pixie dust.”
“You, perhaps, yet you don't want to believe that.”
He didn’t suppose it would’ve been appropriate to say
“Oh, what exactly do you suppose the Patronus will be?”
He caressed the warm sand with his fingertips, waiting for a brief minute. The soft sound of waves crashing on the shore was sort of vague. The sky was overcast with clouds. He wasn’t fond of a sky without stars.
Draco snorted. “Yeah, because they are fantastic and yours aren’t. I asked you to stop buying those atrocious so-called chocolates. You aren’t getting one of mine.”
“I can’t skate.” Draco admitted, frowning at the ice skates on the table beside him. Harry straightened up, and thrusted the skates towards him. The blond twisted his mouth to the side in reluctance. “I’m ridiculously handsome, and I am brilliant at ballroom dancing. Not this.”
“You’re unusually chipper today,” Draco said, arching an eyebrow at Potter curiously. “Any leads on Neverland?”
“You tried to cast the
“I can settle, if you won’t light me on fire,” He said with a slow exhale, and rested his head against the bed post in resignation. “Or if you won’t continue with the other plans you’ve devised.”
“Rage,” Draco said, with a thoughtful hum. “You’ve been there, haven’t you?”
The sky was a shade of violet and black, corpses of infinite stars lighting it, twinkling in the inky canopy. The moon was bestowing a dim light upon the water and it cast a silver luminescence on the sand.
Harry closed his eyes, and inhaled sharply. He needed answers, and his patience was wearing out. Or he could get out of here. He wasn’t intent on staying here with Draco Malfoy. Yet, he was curious.
Harry didn’t want to dismiss the possibility of this entire situation being a trap. He didn’t trust Malfoy. He would have to earn that trust for himself. He didn’t even care that Malfoy was a death eater. He had tormented him a lot over the years, and he wasn’t going to warm up to him. Not until he was certain that it isn’t a trap. “Why are you here, Malfoy?”
He preferred to maintain a distance and flinched if he was touched. Only Ron or Hermione had touched him and it had been rather brief. Not that he didn’t crave a bit of physical affection but he still couldn't help flinching at a touch.
“Now?” Harry asked, arching an eyebrow as he inched closer. “Give me one reason to stay, Draco. One reason – And I won’t go anywhere.”
“It’s not the answer, Potter.”
“You’re irresponsible on the field, Malfoy.” He screamed, as he slapped the file on the surface of his desk. “You screwed up, and didn’t –
Draco directed a sharp glare at him, and his voice trailed. No, he wasn’t intimidated by Draco Malfoy. But he wasn’t necessarily fond of the dramatic turn of events if he continued to ask for one chocolate.
Harry opened a cabinet, and set out the cups. He didn’t have a specific preference with tea – But Draco Malfoy did. His mind traced back to the events of last morning. It was still fresh in his mind. He would’ve fought back. Yet, he knew that Malfoy had to vent it out.
A loud crack echoed piercingly in the room. He flinched at the sound, and sensed a slight discomposure in the blond, and a badly suppressed flinch. He decided to avoid a quip. “Erm, do you want anything specific to eat?”
Draco drew in an uneven breath. “You’re linked to The Dark Lord?”
He was grieving.
“Do you mind,
“Malfoy, what do you think of while producing the Patronus?”
He focused on the shell and on the magic coursing through him. It wasn’t working, and he groaned in frustration, wishing that the ridiculous shell would move. And it did.
on it.”
He cursed as he walked into the kitchen and browsed through the pantry for the ingredients. “Or you could ignore me. That’ll work too.”
Draco Malfoy half-turned to face him. “You – I – I obliviated you. You can’t –
"Darling," He whispers in a soft voice, fingers trailing over Draco's left arm, tracing small circles on the mark on the pale skin. "I want to -" He pauses, interlacing their fingers together, "Oh, love, can you not -"
He wanted to amuse himself with another small argument. To have the satisfaction of winning. To gloss over a small victory over his arch nemesis.
A blur of blond hair, silver eyes and the falling stars flashed in his mind, and he didn’t force it out and the intense pain in his head worsened.
“Quit with the titles, for the love of God,” Harry said with a soft sigh while he carded his fingers through the unruly hair, “now, could you, perhaps, shut up for two seconds – no interruptions – and for
,” Draco said in a soft voice, "well, if you win the war,” A pause. “Or find a way out of Otryazan, first,” A corner of his mouth lifted into the familiar nervous, half-smile of his, “and consider other career options for yourself," it curled into a small smirk, "you could be a journalist and trash yourself in the paper."
“Can’t argue with you on that.” He wasn’t certain if he could argue at all, considering the faint ache in the side. He would appreciate a cold shower. And – he ran his hand over his jaw – a shave.
“Will you ever quit referring to The Dark Lord as the wicked witch of the west or Wizard Hitler or whatever you come up with?” He whispered with a shiver in a small voice. “aren’t you scared of The Dark Lord?”
Anywho, hi, hope y'all are well!
“A hair care
He didn’t suppose that the wizarding world would’ve feared a ‘Dove Lord’ or ‘Mr. Atom’.
“No – you certainly are – if you’re finished with the sardonic remarks and the quips, I have to travel underwater and befriend Ariel and the fishes.” He said with an amused snort. “Or perhaps, I can befriend –
The water trailed down his body, and he rested his head against the tiles. He was so tired. So tired of finding a way out of Otryazan only to fight one more battle with barely any room to recover.
“I was fine without you on Otryazan,” Draco’s voice was uncertain, wobbly. "One day, out of the blue, you, Harry James Potter, the Chosen One, were sent to the Island," he swallowed hard, looking as if he was having great difficulty trying to spit the words out, and whispered, "by my own – father." He managed to only waver for a brief second when he mentioned Lucius, "who risked his own life, for once, and sent you to save me or whatever."
Harry closed his eyes, as he clenched his jaw and clutched the end of the working table. It was only flashes. A piece was erased. He had to find out. He had to find out the events of Third December, 1996.
“I was – er – The chocolate chip cookies are done, and I placed them aside to let them cool off. If you’re quite satisfied with your atrocious hair –
He didn’t even know Malfoy, and he wanted to. He wanted to know the reason his sky was pitch black, and didn’t have any stars. Was it because he was alone? God, he would’ve never thought that there was another side to Draco Malfoy. A side that he didn’t know about.
He felt an intense pain in his head, and a blur of flashes in in his mind only worsened it. A flash of silver. The night sky with falling stars. A soft voice. A soft, familiar voice. A whisper of ‘
He scrunched his nose up, and let out a low hum. “Yeah, it was a tad bit far-fetched.”
“Yes. Focus on brewing the potion, will you?”
"Our soft epilogue."
Harry turned as he cast a final glance at the sea, and walked to the house. Overcast skies opened, and a soft drizzle began. The rain clouds were leaden.
Harry nicked the cloak, draping it over his shoulders. The cold air brushed against his face as he opened the door. With a final glance at a confused Malfoy, he closed it and fished out the pocket-watch.
With one final, brief flicker, the lights went out.
Narcissa would often sing it to him when he was eleven. The hum was closer to her and he wanted to be eleven for one second.
"Told you he fancied the idea of you in a black dress," Pansy winked, which caused Draco to direct yet another warning glare at her. "oh, why don't you stare fondly at Harry instead?”
With a scowl, he willed the seashell to levitate, focusing on the direction. He could vaguely hear Malfoy’s calm, clear voice. “Focus – silence your mind – concentrate on the magic coursing within.”
“I was sent here to pay the price for my actions.”
Draco’s mind traced to his mother. He wondered if she was still coping with it. Or if she had given up. Salazar, he wished he could understand Lucius Malfoy.
Draco–in an impulsive move very unlike himself because apparently an influx of emotions makes you incapable of making sound decisions–is the one to claw through the last seams of the silence first, "It's not pride, you know? Simply self-preservation."
He scoffed. There was absolutely no fucking way that Malfoy had intruded his mind to know about the manor and his father. “You could’ve asked.”
“Yes, forever.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, a faint smile on his face. “Are you? You’ve been staring at me as if I announced that I’m one of the avengers.”
“Oh, shut up,” He said with a small snort and the corners of his mouth upturned in soft amusement at the flicker of anxiety across Draco’s face. “the oh-so deficient vocabulary will suffice for a conversation with you.”
“Oh, shut up.” Malfoy said, with a soft groan. It was insanely amusing to revel over the tiny victories. Not against the house, but against Draco Malfoy. “I would’ve won the match in our second year if the Bludger –
With that, he set to work, levitating the nearest red conical seashell.
“Otryazan means ‘severed’ in Bulgarian,” He continued, as he stared at the sea. It was calm, and the waves were crashing softly against the shore. “I’ve tried to get out, but the ancient magic –
When he returned to the house, he didn’t find a note with the untouched tea. With a little effort, he cast a vanishing charm over the teacup and a quick cleaning charm.
It elicited a soft laugh. “I know.”
Harry tilted his head back to gaze up at the endless sky overhead. “Venus is misunderstood. Modern science can’t crack the dense layers. But it’s beautiful. And you are beautiful, and intriguing.”
“Careful, Malfoy.” He said with a soft nudge. “It was a compliment.”
It was a fact. Draco traded insults with him thrice within an hour and the choice of words for the ‘
The blond leaned closer and curled his fingers around Harry's neck, mouth an inch away from his. "Kiss me."
“I want a deal,” Harry said with a soft sigh. “Not charity.”

“It’s
He placed the cup of tea on the counter and flicked the badges to one side. He wasn’t certain what it was. A cup with a piece of Voldemort’s soul in it, sure. What exactly was it, though?
“Darling.”
?” A sharp pain flared in his right side, causing him to wince, wishing it wasn’t a fractured rib. Or ribs. “If you couldn’t walk –”
"Together?"
Draco circled the trembling fingers around his arm in a rather weak grip, whispering a variation of profanities. In conclusion, the swearing wouldn’t cease. Fantastic. “
Falling stars. The whisper of wish on the stars. The flashes. The owl didn’t wait. It soared in the sky, and towards the owlery. He read it out-loud and for a brief moment, a falling star flashed in his mind. Yet, it was only a blur.
Malfoy uncertainly reached out and clasped his hand, pointing it upward and his fingertip lined with a bright, flashing, white star. Sirius. A star that the sky of his fancy didn’t hold. “Thank you.”
“Accept a compliment without coming up with some sort of sarcastic comment?”
on them.
He scribbled on the back of the parchment after lunch, placing it inside the now-fixed cup and casting a cleaning charm on the plate.
He couldn’t wrap his head around that. Lucius Malfoy could’ve given him to Voldemort, but he hadn’t. He wasn’t even hurting him in any way. “He disarmed me, and sent me here.”
A shudder trickled down his spine, as his eyes travelled around the room frantically. Cold, hesitant light streamed in through a cracked window. The tension in the atmosphere made him uncomfortable.
He had to get out of here. Lucius Malfoy had disarmed him, and he didn’t have a fucking wand. He hadn’t fixed his glasses yet. With a groan, he closed his eyes, casting a wandless
He wanted a distance and didn’t want to lean on the brunet anymore. The soft hum caused one of his repressed memories – one of his fondest – to resurface. He didn’t want to ruin it. So, he remained in place with his head resting on Potter’s shoulder and listened to the familiar hum.
“Quit with the saviour nonsense, for one.” Potter whispered with a small snort, pacing over to the bed, his calm composure shifting slightly, “I’m not the saviour or the Chosen One.” A beat. “you can’t rely on The Prophet.”
It was barely a whisper. He wasn’t intending to say it out loud. Malfoy went awfully still, and he turned his gaze from the sea towards him. “No, I didn't, Potter."
He didn’t trust the six years of animosity. And he couldn’t trust himself to pause and reconsider before hurting Malfoy. Lucius Malfoy had disarmed him for a reason – To protect Draco, in his own twisted way.
The knots around his chest began to loosen up, and Draco collapsed against the brunet, and he curled his arms around his waist. “I’m sorry, Draco. I didn’t -
Fantastic. A foreign phrase. A French phrase that caused a brief stutter in the chest. “I can’t recall a second of the conversation where Ron was offensive to you or your minions.”
He shrugged. He had been dueling with the death eaters, and he was exhausted. He didn’t even know if the others were alright. “I can’t stay.”
He was enchanted, his body moving in along in tandem of it's own accord and it caused a warmth to surge through him. He felt content for once.
“You’re the chosen one, aren’t you?” The venom was returning in Draco’s voice, a hint of irritation crossing the features. “If you own a suspicious artifact, I want to find out what it is, considering it might bite me in the arse.”
It lasted for a while, then he fell again.
He didn’t even want to think about the ferret situation in the fourth year. It was still a sour topic, and sort of irritating. The brunet was clearly amused. Waiting for a reaction. “No headstone.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Add one cup of flour,” Harry said, with a small smile. With a scowl, Malfoy added the flour into the mixing bowl and placed it down with a soft groan and a few curses, mostly with the ‘f’ word. “Always the dramatic one.”
“Yeah, I can vaguely see Venus.” He said, as he directed Harry’s hand and held it up. "There.”
The blond arched an eyebrow at him in evident confusion. “Go on, Potter – I’ll not light you on fire if it’s a sensible question.”
, not start a fight-fest when I convince you that I do care,
“Rule Two: Contradict the fact that
Harry opened his eyes, observing a look of concern flash across Draco’s face, an eyebrow quirked up, perhaps waiting for a quip or a retort. He traded insults with Draco thrice in an hour but he couldn’t come up with one now.
Draco whispered a ‘
“And I didn’t sign up for dealing with the Chosen One, who is insanely sarcastic and has a shit load of absurd names for me.”
The panic surged within, an unsettling feeling coursing through his nerves and he exhaled in an uneven manner. Of course, he didn’t care about Harry Potter. He couldn’t. Yet, if he didn’t care – why was he concerned about Potter’s well-being? Draco couldn’t soften up on him. Not now. It would cause trouble.
“Good.”
He stared at the sea and inhaled the familiar scent of the seawater as comfort washed over him.
Reversing it was easier – Not yet – Not until he could find a way to obliterate it.
He raised his eyes uncertainly, and they were met by worried emerald green ones. He was kneeling down before Draco, a hesitant hand on his shoulder. “I don’t know, Malfoy. I only saw your father.”
The brunet's gaze flickered to Draco's lips and back to his eyes. He wanted to. He had wanted to for years. Now, he had the chance - so, he placed a single finger under Draco's chin and the nervousness he was so prone to feeling washed out of him like a tidal wave, flooding from the tips of his fingers and crashing out of his mouth as it parted in the slightest way, almost invisible.
Malfoy searched the kitchen, and he cursed when he didn’t find a note. It was sort of amusing. Not that the intention was to amuse himself, but it was an added bonus. And a tiny victory.
He sighed. Reciting the story of Rapunzel while baking cookies was certainly a sign of losing whatever bit of sanity he had left. “Can’t we bake in peace?”
“I’ll give you the most Malfoy-ish ones.”
“You owe me an explanation.”
It was kind of unbelievable. Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy in a bit of a banter which didn't involve insensitive retorts and didn't turn into a fight. It could be a fucking headline.
The pause returned, lingering in the air for a brief minute. He wanted to clear his head. The troubling nightmare was imprinted in the mind and he had to force it out or he would return in a never-ending circle of remorse.
“Oh, of course.”
“I wouldn’t want you to –” He paused mid-sentence when Draco’s fingers circled around the artifact with an odd glint in the eyes. “Draco,” It was a warning tone. “Put it on the counter.”
Acting on impulse, Draco reached out and cupped the bruised jaw in his hand, and traced a finger across the cuts. Potter’s lips parted, his eyes wide and pupils dilating as the finger lingered for a second longer. Two. The emerald green eyes flicked up to him, and he raised an eyebrow.
He smirked, folding it to the middle and placing it on the plate with a final touch of whipped cream and a sprinkle of powdered sugar. He slid the plate across the prep table over to Malfoy, and prepared his own.
“Whatever floats your boat, Malfoy.”
"To what I want." Draco said simply. Harry waited for an explanation, for Draco to say what he meant, but none came. Softly, Harry sighed, tentatively resting his head on Draco's chest again to listen to his heartbeat.
He wasn’t exactly familiar with building a raft, and he didn’t suppose that it would get him out. He could sense the magic that the Island was radiating. It wasn’t going to be that easy.
Malfoy arched an eyebrow at him, and he waved it off. He didn’t want to spare another second thinking about the summer at the Dursley’s. He had been fucking miserable.
“You are wasting my precious moment of peace with your –” A fight-fest with Harry Potter was not a clever idea and it wasn’t worth the trouble. He didn't have the emotional capacity to go through with petty arguments right then, “never mind, come in,” Draco said with a scoff, “what can I do for our saviour?”
“If I – yes.” He whispered with a soft smile and outstretched a hand which caused the brunet’s mind to trace to the first year when Draco had offered a chance at a friendship. “yes, I want us to be friends.”
Or it was probably a lot less painful than ‘Mr. Atom Dildo Lover’ Or ‘Immortal Dove Lord’. Not that Voldemort wasn’t a pathetically painful variation of the initial name.
“Your quips, mind you, aren’t well-suited for a serious conversation and you should tone it down, Potter or I will light you on fire in your sleep,” He warned. “Clear?”
Yet, in that moment, he didn’t flinch. He didn’t flinch when the blond curled closer to him. The surge of panic at the touch was replaced with the familiar flutter in his chest with the warmth coursing in his body.
"You could say it isn't the first time I've considered it, so no, actually, I've been considering for a while now and have finally decided to change my mind." Merlin, the earnestness and pure regret and guilt that shone through those emerald eyes was impossible to look at.
Carefully, he inched closer to Draco Malfoy and crouched down before him and placed a hand on his shoulder. “Draco?”
He was snoring with his lips parted slightly, and a strand of hair was over his left eye. Harry absent-mindedly brushed it out of his face. “I’m not perfect, you know?”
“I couldn’t’ve refused,” he whispered in a small voice while the soft smile faltered and Harry felt an odd throb in the chest.  “not when –” A pause. “not when I’ve wanted to be your friend for six years.”
Instead of prancing around, it was standing still and it didn’t vanish either. Absent-mindedly, he started to hum in a soft voice, oblivious to the fact that Draco Malfoy was awake, and listening to him.
because you wouldn’t shut up about
“Christ, you’re not on the front cover of Vogue.” He paused with a soft sigh. A confused frown was etched on Draco’s face. “It’s a fashion –” The trouble wasn’t worth it. “Never mind.”
, you’re forgiven,” Draco whispered with a soft snort. “
“Oh, I was with Ron and Hermione, on my way to defeat Voldemort, until your precious father sent me here and now, I’m on a severed Island with the one person I don’t want to be with – so no, I haven’t forgotten, Malfoy.”
It couldn’t be. The Dark Lord had said that he wouldn’t harm either of them. Draco couldn’t find his own voice, and he didn’t want to know. “Was?”
The tension in the air vanished, and he stared at Malfoy with a grin on his face. “You said that you would to toss me in the sea.”
He closed his eyes, and focused on the spell. Yet, the content was replaced with sorrow. He couldn’t be with Sirius. He couldn’t have a home.
“You’re a full tilt diva.” The corner of his lips quirked in pure amusement, as Draco directed a piercing glare at him. “We were stating facts, weren’t we?”
The second note, was written in an untidy scrawl. He exhaled slowly, as realization dawned on him. He had written the note. He had written a note on Third December, 1996 and he couldn’t recall writing one.
He didn’t have dinner that night. Or leave a note
Deaths that occurred because of him. “I was taken to the manor with Ron and Hermione by the snatchers – I barely managed to get them out with the prisoners. I couldn’t leave.”
“Wipe the smirk off your face.”
Ever the noble chosen one, who didn’t even waver while draping the cloak over Draco and it was certainly a cause for concern. “
well hi!
Draco’s mouth simpered; a sculpted, pale eyebrow artfully raised. It was clear that the blond was pleased with the course of the conversation. “Rule Three: Pretend you aren’t interested in a conversation about you.”
He was searching for an argument. Only to vent it out at once.
The cup was conjuring an object. It was on the bottom of the cup. A badge. He fished it out and turned it over. Quidditch Captain. He exhaled. Quidditch. He wanted to play Quidditch. Wanted to fly on his beloved firebolt.
Harry confesses that he trusts Draco, if only a little.
“Oh, I’m accustomed to it now, considering you can’t survive for a minute without sending a French curse with a sneer or a scowl in my direction.” He said in a low drawl. “Harry Potter – 2, Draco Malfoy – 0.”
Draco's hair was curled at the ends, a few strands falling over the forehead and his eyes were captured with a black eyeliner, a powder dusted on the eyelids, archly curled lashes.
Malfoy raised his eyes and arched an eyebrow at him with a scowl. “Yes, Potter. While you were resting, I had to prepare lunch and considering I won’t burn the crepes –
“No, you’re fucking infuriating and I can’t deal with you, Potter.” Draco said, with a soft sigh, raising his gaze from the sky to stare at the brunet. “A Hufflepuff – certainly. A Gryffindor – Never.”
Hermione could’ve. She would undoubtedly master wandless magic within a few hours. And she would proceed to teach him and Ron with patience, unfolding each aspect at a slow pace.
The corner of his lip twitched, before curling into a teasing smirk. “It revolves around a ‘lost princess’ with hair containing healing powers and an evil witch with ageing issues. Of course it’s weird.”
He let his magic build up, and directed its flow at the shell as he willed it to himself. The magic in him was shifting, and he was trying to keep it steady. The shell was unable to make up its mind, and it alternated between floating in the air and coming towards him – It decided to stay afloat.
“Put the goddamn ice skates on,” Harry said, loudly than he’d been wanting to. They received a few stares from the muggles, and Draco gave him a sharp glare. “Do you want me to drag you there?”
The stir of magic in him halted once again, as a shell lowered into the sand at a slow pace. He was breathing unevenly, as a sheen of sweat broke out on his forehead. It was reasonably well. Performing the levitation charm had been taxing on him.
bearable now.”
In an hour, he opened the door slightly and peered into the living room – Potter was sleeping on the couch, his arms curled around a pillow – And at the plate on the counter.
“Mhm, not quite,” He said with a chuckle, the hand on the back trailing to the right shoulder and adjusting it, and with a twitch of the fingers, he extracted it. “now, practice the wand motion.”
“No?” He chuckled, and Draco detected a glint of mischief in his eyes. “I figured it would have ‘
If he was anything in the universe, he was star dust finding his way to the stars.
“You’re an arse.”
The kiss was slow and sweet and lingering, the two wizards taking their time to taste and savor the other's lips. There was no rush or hurried movements as they continued to sway gently to the music, caught up in the warmth and sweetness of each other. At long last they pulled apart, both of their faced flushed a light pink. In that moment, he wanted nothing more than the savor this moment entirely.
“Yes, well – if you’re surrendering within the first four days of practicing the Patronus charm – you’re not cut out for it.” He said, with a rather dramatic roll to the eyes. “Patience, Malfoy. Patience.”
A knife wasn’t his first choice. He didn’t wish to accidentally stab himself. Malfoy would create a song and dance about it.
He drew Draco closer and for a few seconds, he couldn’t find the words while he swayed to the music in a slow pace. “Oh, it is?”
He was away from the war he never wanted to be a part of. But he was away from home. And if he could go back, he wasn’t sure if he would belong there.
He could’ve refused. Yet, he hadn’t. He couldn’t pinpoint why Draco hadn’t rejected Harry the way he had, on the train, when he was eleven when he had the chance. “I – why didn’t you?”
Malfoy directed an unamused
Malfoy shrugged, reaching for a small pot the waitress had placed on the table. “Try it with honey.”
Draco’s shoulders slumped and he sagged forwards, his hair sticking up in all directions. Which, of course, delighted Harry.
Ginny had told everyone about their split, whilst Harry waited with bated breath. Eventually, though Molly had looked stricken, they were offered support and love and, though Ron would never admit it, some relieved smiles.
He sighed. “I know.”
Potter shrugged, shoving his hands deep into his pockets. “Yeah,” he said, kicking at the air, “it’s nice.”
“Mmm, touché.”
Draco stared at him, keeping his expression disinterested. “Admin mostly,” he admitted, “though I do have a say in which books are kept here and which aren’t.”
“Blimey,” Ron said, “I thought you would’ve been tearing at each other’s throats by now.”
Harry nodded slowly. “So naturally,” he said, “you turn to me.” He tossed his sweetest smile. “Your saviour.”
Malfoy cocked his head to the side. “I thought they would’ve told you already. Things working a little slow at the Ministry are they?”
Draco shrugged. “Indeed, I do.”
What in the name of Merlin’s damned red scarf?
“Well, she must be mad,” Harry spat, anger overflowing, “who’d want to live with you?”
“You’re not…” Ginny sniffed, “you’re not hurt?”
“That’s it, Potter.” Draco lunged, easily sidestepped by Potter who scurried off to another aisle. Draco sprinted after him even as he continued to read out more paragraphs of drivel.
Harry grinned, opening his mouth to say something more when Keesey popped in, brandishing an envelope.
Potter was in a relationship. He was happily, incredibly happily by the looks of things, in love with Ginny Weasley. But…in the library, Draco was sure that there was something else, in the air, some cliched spark between them. Potter would never act on that of course, he was far too noble, Draco doubted he'd even felt it but the way his cheeks were flushed, his green eyes huge…Draco had promised himself this wouldn’t happen again. Not this quickly.
The was had ended, the Dark Lord defeated. He was supposed to be resting, properly living. Retired even. He could retire, he had enough money.
“He leaned in, breath fluttering as our noses nudged closer– shall I continue? I can definitely continue.”
To make up for it, here's a fluffy chapter for you all. Hope you enjoy!
“How long will I be working with him?”
“It was none of your business.” The cheek. Potter was endearingly blunt, but irritating, nonetheless.
No, he loved her. He had to.
Ron could barely contain his laughter when Molly lightly whacked George over the back of his head, after which they were immediately ushered to the dining table where an array of different foods had been laid out in time for lunch. It almost reminded Harry of the first breakfast he’d had here, when he’d escaped the clutches of the Dursley home. He’d forever be grateful for that. He doubted Ron would ever quite know how much it meant to see him ripping off the bars in a rusty blue car, how much it’d saved him.
