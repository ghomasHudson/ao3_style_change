“I don’t want to hear it, Mr. Potter,” she cut him off with an invisible blade. “You’ve just sent another student to the
Alas, that was a worry for another time. Right now, it was time to finish those five inches on the proper growing conditions for Bubotuber for Professor Sprout.
“No one wants to listen to your prattling, Malfoy.” Harry made a grab for the rat. The other boy jerked the animal out of his swipe, none too gently.
That was the final straw. Scarlet bloomed across Harry’s vision. His fist connected with other boy’s nose, hard.
There was something peculiar about Malfoy’s reaction to her insult, a strange paleness that suddenly came over his already-fair skin, making him look as if he’d seen a ghost. Making him look like a ghost himself. Perhaps it was just Harry’s imagination, but he could’ve sworn that there was almost... fear, in the boy’s thin face.
, Harry realized glumly. He wished he himself had thrown on something nicer than a wrinkly, ancient Weird Sisters T-shirt.
The Great Hall was already brimming with hungry students by the time the two of them arrived, the ruckus of clattering silverware only muffled by even an even greater ruckus of excitement for the new year.
Harry groaned, glancing nervously around. He accidentally made eye contact with a certain sandy-haired D.A.D.A. professor at the front of the hall, who sent him a quiet glare. He slid down in his seat as much as he could.
Together, they’d been named Head Boy and Girl in their seventh year. Even before they’d received their honors, no one could deny that they were two of the most brilliant, most popular, finest students that had ever attended Hogwarts.
But after a disaster at Hogwarts in their fourth year, involving magical criminal Barty Crouch Jr. breaking into the castle polyjuiced as famed auror Alastor Moody, every wizarding family in England had been on edge. He’d sabotaged the ongoing Triwizard Tournament, setting a full-grown dragon loose in the halls. After the beast had gotten into the boy’s bathroom in the left wing, setting poor Neville Longbottom’s pants aflame, the rest of the cross-school event had been canceled. Even after Crouch had been apprehended, he had refused to reveal his motives, and whether or not he was working with a larger insurgence. The professors had cautioned against the usual student get-togethers over the summer.
Of course, the three of them had still written feverishly to each other over the summer months, but now that they were back in person, Harry abruptly realized how much he had truly missed his friends. He’d missed Ron’s gangly clumsiness and clever jokes. He’d missed Hermione’s frizzy curls and well-meant nagging. He’d missed the sound of their laughter, mixing in with his own.
Ron and Hermione cast apologetic glances at Harry, but there was nothing they could do. He shut the office door, and stormed down the winding stairs to the Great Hall alone.
With two of the greatest people in the world now by his side, Harry felt as if he could handle anything this school year had in store for him. Even...
Harry thought he could feel Malfoy’s greasy little smirk on him as he broke the seal with trembling hands.
Malfoy’s snakelike grin only grew with Harry’s horrible realization. He must’ve seen what happened at the train station. He’d probably already spread it to the rest of Slytherin House. Harry could practically already hear the snickers of ‘
“What did McGonagall want to talk to you two about?” Harry stole his food back. “I hope you didn’t get in trouble too because of me.”
He sat across from her, using every inch of willpower he had to keep from squirming under her steely green gaze. “Professor, Malfoy started it, he-”
“You’ve been made prefect!” he realized. “Congratulations, ‘Mione, though it’s honestly no surprise.”
“I suppose your outburst was not entirely unreasonable, Mr. Potter. I will ensure that Mr. Malfoy faces his consequences as well. Fifteen points from Gryffindor, and I shall lessen your own punishment.”
It was a usual ‘welcome-back-summer’s-over-work-now-begins’ speech so far, but Harry had always enjoyed the way Dumbledore spoke. He was a fine sort of orator, who knew exactly how to waver his tone and lengthen certain syllables to make one feel as if they were listening to the most important thing in the world. He found himself leaned forward just the slightest.
.” Ron plopped down next to him, snatching a lamb chop off of Harry’s plate. George instinctively moved aside for Hermione to get through on the other side. They would have to finish the conversation at another time.
“That’s enough nonsense now.” Lily swiftly put an end to any brewing schemes, along with the last of Harry’s hope. “You’d better hop on the train before it leaves without you. And no taking the sweater off once your out of my sight!”
weeks!” George hardly lowered his voice. “Can you at least practice on your own outside of set hours? You could borrow the snitch, fly around on the lawns or-”
“Anyone who knows the two of you would not be comforted by that statement.” Harry realized that Ron, along with the rest of his dormmates—Neville, Dean, and Seamus—had already been shaken awake by the Weasley Twins. The fifth-year boys now all stood about blearily, extremely grouchy about being woken up in the middle of the night. Ron’s vibrant hair was sticking up like a genuine fire. Neville was in a full set of bright yellow duckie pajamas. Seamus was falling back asleep on Dean, drooling a little on his boyfriend’s shoulder.
“Harry.” The last, but equally essential part of their trio, Ron Weasley, draped himself dramatically over him. “’Mione’s bastard demon has done it at last. It’s devoured Scabbers, it’s...”
“In the same spirit, we are searching for four students, one from each house, to work closely together on this challenging but magnificent project. Honorable Cho Chang from Ravenclaw and Cedric Diggory from Hufflepuff have already volunteered. Please stand, so we can all give you a round of applause!”
People in the stands had now spotted Ron and Harry’s brooms, and the commotion only grew. Harry almost winced at how loud everything was getting.
“I said I don’t want to hear it!” The transfiguration instructor repeated, then sank deeper into her seat with a tired sigh. “I know that James and Lily raised you to be better than this.”
“We heard that you punched Draco Malfoy in the face on the train,” the one on his right, who he was seventy-percent sure was Fred, announced. “Nice going, mate.”
“Not you, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger. There’s something else I would like to discuss with the two of you.”
“We hope that all of you will join us in this mission, and help us make Hogwarts a stronger, unified institution. Whether you are a Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin...”
“Does this include one Miss Granger?” Ron asked teasingly, but not unkindly. Everyone already knew the answer. Harry loved Hermione, but this was probably for the best. This would not have been good for her blood pressure.
Ron gave him a long look, an unnerving sort of expression in his blue eyes. But before he could respond, Headmaster Dumbledore began his usual speech at the owl-shaped podium at the front of the hall. Gratefully, Harry listened to the great wizard’s sonorous voice reverberate in his ears, letting it drown out his own jealousy.
Crookshanks, her frumpy ginger cat presently nestled in her arms, had on an expression which told Harry otherwise. Or perhaps his face was always like that.
“Harry!” Hermione Granger, one of his best friends since first year, greeted him with a brilliant smile. She’d written happily in one of her letters that she’d finally be getting her braces off this summer. There were magical ways of fixing children’s teeth, but her parents were muggle dentists who’d insisted on the traditional wires and waiting.
Ron pulled back suddenly, his red hair gleaming like copper under the compartment lights. “Mate, no offense, but that sweater... you look...”
The small red music device was the only muggle thing Harry really knew how to use. It had been his parents’ going away present for his first year at Hogwarts, so that he could listen to the muggle music his family always blasted around the house when he was away at the castle.
Harry’s own snowy owl, Hedwig, was already safely tucked into the new mobile owlery on the train, a few corridors down. He watched Crookshanks lick at his whiskers, and was suddenly very relieved about this fact. No offense to Hermione.
“You are all the future of the wizarding world.” Dumbledore spread his arms out as if he could give the entire hall a grand embrace. “With this in mind, I announce Hogwarts’s first ever Cross-House Ball, to be held at the beginning of April, near the end of the second term.”
At least the opening feast was as amazing as it always was. Gleaming silver platters of giant roasts and multilayer cakes sat in the center. Dozens of more treats blossomed around the main courses—lamb chops, chocolate muffins, and Harry’s personal favorite, treacle tarts. A thousand wonderful smells wafted through the air, strong sugar and spices which had already coaxed Harry’s mouth into watering.
Hermione rolled her eyes, but before she could admonish them any further, the clanging of a spoon against a glass from the professors’ table was amplified by magic.
“It’ll wear off soon enough.” His mother nodded with satisfaction. “I won’t have you getting a cold during your first week of school. You’ll fall behind for the rest of the year if you do. Go on, run along.”
“Twenty points from Gryffindor.” Professor McGonagall produced her sentence. “And your personal punishment shall be-”
But Harry hoped that when he was truly, perfectly in love, it would feel this mushy. Gushy, mushy, strong enough so that when he did feel almost completely lost, he would still be absolutely certain about the person he loved. He would willingly fight to figure things out, to fight to get back on his feet, so that he could be with them. No matter how hard life push and pulled against them, they would stick together.
“Well then.” Dumbledore finally took pity, clearing his throat. “If any Gryffindor or Slytherin does find themselves interested later, feel free to bring it up to any professor during these next few months. I shall let you all resume your meals now.”
“Not the entire student body.” He didn’t realize he’d spoken aloud until George answered him. “There aren’t any first, second, or third years here. Along with a few other students who... wouldn’t quite approve.”
Malfoy was definitely glaring at him now. So was Professor McGonagall, and Snape. Remus had his head in his hands as the rest of Sirius’s Howler commenced, more praises and extremely inappropriate language.
This, combined with the fact that Harry looked quite a bit like his dad—the only differences being his mother’s green eyes and a small, lightning-bolt scar on his forehead he’d gotten from playing with James’s wand when he’d been six—made Snape hate him even before his ineptitude for potions had been discovered.
But he’d barely reached for his first tart when two tall figures slid on either side of him, with matching glints of mischief in their eyes and Ron’s fiery hair.
Angelina, Cho, Fred, and George would be playing against them on the Unicorns, along with Marcus Flint, Graham Montague, and Tasmin Applebee.
“You can have my sweater if you want, Harry.” Peter Pettigrew, the second of his parents’ best friends, offered kindly. Unfortunately, his bright red, newt-patterned sweater did not seem like a huge step up from Harry’s current daffodil situation.
,’” Luna explained. “And I can’t imagine a situation when mourning someone or something is ever good, so I’ve been thinking about other morning greetings instead. I’ve already been through a few, none of which I’ve liked very much, but this morning, the sky’s clear enough that you can still see the moon. It is quite pretty, against the blue wash, so I thought, ‘Good moon.’ What do you think?”
“You’d better just open it, Harry.” Neville Longbottom, who was sitting across from them, suggested timidly. “It’ll be worse if you don’t. My gran sent me one once, and I ignored it, and... it was horrible.”
Harry unconsciously peeked at the table farthest away from his own. Even after the abolishment of house arrangement, it was clearly still the Slytherin table, a distinct block of deep green and silver. He caught a glimpse of Malfoy, with a satisfyingly large bandage over his reddish nose. People like him and Snape would never mingle with “outsiders.”
Meanwhile, James Potter had been the captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team during his years. His father had led the house to total victories in his three-year reign, and had actually been scouted by a few professional teams. But his true dream had been to start a family with Lily, and so he’d found a career as a Transfigurator for a private shipping company closer to home.
“How-” The professor sputtered. Her office door was protected by multiple complex magical wards. “How did the two of you-”
“Can I have your jacket instead?” Harry eyed Sirius’s own leather jacket hopefully. He loved his father, but found his godfather’s fashion sense more aligned with his own. A much cooler, more sophisticated version of Harry’s sense, at least.
” Harry was still half-asleep, attempting to make sense of the current situation. He had started to come to the conclusion that this was the beginning some sort of very bizarre dream. “Why would I need my broomstick?”
Harry grinned, holding his arm across Hermione for a high-five. Ron clapped his hand with an impish, freckled grin of his own. Harry reminded himself that this was still the same, awesome Ron. One trivial title didn’t change anything.
“So Scabbers is missing again?” He tried to steer the conversation into a less embarrassing subject.
“I would if I could, believe me.” Hermione was not the slightest bit frazzled. “But I’m up to my elbows in classes, O.W.L.s. preparation, not to mention S.P.E.W...”
George!” The twin exclaimed, but then broke into a toothy grin. “Only kidding, I am Fred. And ‘we’ refers to most of the school.”
It was no surprise that library-hermit, perfect-homework Hermione had been made head girl. By Merlin, she’d been approved a Time-Turner in their third year by the school so that she could go back in time and take even more classes. Unfortunately, all Time-Turners had ben outlawed after that year due to a most absurd incident involving a Hippogriff on trial. Why a beast had been on trial at the Ministry of Magic in the first place, Harry had no idea.
Harry slid down as far as he could into his seat, and did not move until it was time to head to his first class.
Then, Fred turned to George. “You know... we could always ask the others if we could adjust the schedule for... that.”
Cho Chang, Ravenclaw’s Seeker. Harry’s crush for the past year. She seemed even prettier than she had been the year before, her silken, ink-dark hair a little longer, her cheeks a little rosier with slight embarrassment as she stood.
What on-” His groggy anger was stifled by fear when a warm hand came down on his mouth. But then he recognized the mischievous gleam in the face above him.
But he would poison his mind no longer with thoughts of the horrible ponce. He got into position with the rest of his team, crushing the balls of his feet into the tall grass in preparation of a swift take off. He thought that he might’ve been distracted by the roar of the crowd, but he found that the thudding of his own pulse drowned everything else out. Excitement turned, almost nauseatingly, in his gut.
He was a mediocre student, particularly horrid in potions. People often mentioned how much he looked like his father, but it seemed as if Harry had inherited none of his natural social charm. Only his terrible eyesight and wild, uncooperative hair.
“Please don’t misunderstand, I love talking to you.” Harry continued his conversation with Luna, looking away from Ginny a little too quickly. “But are you allowed to be here at the Gryffindor table?”
He wasn’t sure what he was angrier about—the fact that this slimy git was making him feel embarrassed about his wonderful family, or that he was allowing him to.
Fortunately, Hermione had saved them seats at the Gryffindor table. It only took a moment to spot her familiar shock of bushy hair, even though it was tied back with a red and gold bandana today.
Hermione cuddled her cat protectively. “Like Harry said, this isn’t the first time your rat has gone missing, and this isn’t the first time you’ve wrongly accused Crookshanks! It’s not our fault that you can’t keep track of your own pet!”
In between practice and Wizard’s Chess with Ron, Harry busied himself with working on his Patronus Charm. He, James, and Sirius had been begging Remus to teach it at school since his first year, only to be met with “the students aren’t ready yet,” and “maybe next year.” His mother had of course agreed with Remus, foiling any attempts of James and Sirius to teach it to Harry “before he was ready.” But this year, the D.A.D.A. professor had finally relented. Harry could only produce a few, silver wisps as of now, but he was already guessing what form it might take. He hoped it would be a stag like his father’s.
She looked in between the three of them, and though it was well-veiled, Harry thought he could see a hint of affection. Her protectiveness of her students had always made her James Potter’s favorite professor.
But just as Fred leaned in to answer, another body started worming its way in between him and Harry.
“Why’d you decide to blind everyone on this train with that horrendous sweater? Oh wait... mummy made you wear it.”
“What about you, Ron?” she shot back at him. “You’re a prefect as well. It would be a dutiful thing to do.”
Both voices were cut off by the sound of Harry sliding the door open, their owners immediately whirling towards his arrival.
He couldn’t listen to Frank Sinatra’s rendition of “I’ve Got You Under My Skin” without thinking of his parents reenacting their first wedding dance, twirling around the kitchen. Michael Jackson’s “Billie Jean” and “Thriller” had been the two most popular songs in his house when he’d been younger. Any song of Queen’s had pretty much been ruined by his godfather’s mediocre guitar skills and less-than-mediocre warbling.
“It’s too thin!” Lily shoved Harry’s red jacket in question into his suitcase. “I told you before, this is a
“I’d do it again in a heartbeat.” Harry squeezed her shoulder. His eye caught on a new glint on her robes. It was a recognizable badge, laid in their house’s trademark red and gold. The metal ribbon in the middle spelled out Hermione’s new title in bold, capital letters.
Harry stared sorrowfully at his broomstick, the beautiful Firebolt that had been Sirius’s present for his fourteenth birthday. He could hardly bear to touch the gleaming wood, knowing that it would only make him think of how well the grooves fit against his hands, improving his grip as he soared through the air, even the strongest of winds unable to hold him back...
It was so unfair. The offer of help Malfoy longed for, the hand he was waiting for finally stretched out towards him… and he almost accepted it despite all that happened.
Thought about ditching Potter crossed his mind as well but Malfoy was too curious to let this just slide. Curious and horny.
And despite all of this, Harry viewed himself as a victim. As if it wasn’t his free will doing the absolute most and unnecessary. The hero complex Potter had was so strong he made himself believe there was not any other choice. Defeating Voldemort was the only thing he couldn’t avoid, every other offer of help was optional from his side. Yet he made countless offers to help almost everyone.
"You can talk to us about anything, you know that. Don't struggle alone." Hermione touched his hand gently, giving him an understanding look. Harry nodded, but felt a sudden feeling of discomfort and stood up.
"How very nice of you." The other pointed out sourly. Harry had been waiting to be noticed and untied by the blonde boy the whole time, lying there butt-naked and dirty.
"Shut up about things you have no idea about." Harry's eyes penetrated deep into Malfoy's skull. Draco got shivers, realizing he overstepped the unspoken boundaries, but somehow, seeing Potter so worked up for him made him smile inside.
Harry clasped the blonde boy's asscheeks, digging his nails into delicate skin, slamming Draco harder against himself.
"Fuck, you're tight." Draco muttered under his breath as he slid out. He thrust back in hard the next moment, causing the black-haired boy under him to moan some more. Harry's hands were tied together, resting above his head. Malfoy leaned in and pressed down on the joined palms to reach even deeper places of Harry's body.
The constant pressure he felt from all sides, the unmet expectations, the stares… living in his own house felt like abuse. Draco never wanted to do things that he was required to, he never wished to become a follower of the Dark Lord. Even some of those conservative opinions he held about half-blood magicians weren’t extreme to the point he wanted to kill them. He desired the simplest things, a warm home and understanding parents but it turned out to be a privilege Draco never got.
"Madam Pomfrey? Anyone in here?" Harry yelled as soon as he managed to open the main door with his elbow since some spots on his palms turned purple.
"Oh, my apologies, sleeping beauty. I'll try not to die a bit quieter next time." Harry barked out as he turned around, which caused his head to spin. He became dizzy and the world around him went blurry for a moment.
"How very nice of you," Harry repeated the words he said earlier that day. "I'll keep that in mind. 'night." With that, he headed upstairs to his room, not giving any more attention to the blonde boy.
"Not everyone has the privilege of being the Chosen One. Some have to work hard to get by." Malfoy said, surprisingly with no sarcasm in his voice. Or maybe Harry was just too out of it to hear it.
Sweet, Harry thought as his tongue made an impact with the blonde boy's pale skin. Draco probably showered in the morning, giving the faint mint scent Harry could smell.
Draco walked past Blaise who was playing chess with some second year, so he knew he got a bit of time for himself. Once the door on his room closed, Malfoy rested his back against it and slowly slid down. He stretched his knees before bending them again and wrapping his arms around them.
"The scorpion's poison is highly dangerous when is mixed with dragon's blood and comes in contact with skin, Mr. Potter. I believe I've mentioned it at the beginning of the lesson. Quickly go to the nurse!" Slughorn rarely lost his cool but this was one of the cases. The golden boy was about to die in front of his eyes without realizing it. On the other hand, Harry was already calculating how to make it up to Slughorn while he rushed to the hospital ward.
"The Golden Boy is sneaking out late at night just to cry on his girlfriend's shoulder? Truly splendid Gryffindor behavior." Malfoy chuckled.
"Mr. Potter...? Did you-... did you just touch it with your hands? Does it not hurt...?" Slughorn asked hesitantly and with concern, his eyebrows formed into a frown. Harry just wanted to move on with this topic, he couldn't understand why he was getting so much attention all of a sudden. But when a pain sprang up to his forearms, forcing him to look down, he finally understood.
Heavy moans and slapping filled the small room, the second day in a row. Halfway through Harry ought to switch their position, leading Draco to be still on his fours. His arms quickly gave out once Potter's palm made a rather painful impact with one of his arse cheeks.
Harry moved at the last second and grabbed the blonde boy's wrist before he exited the room. Their eyes met, creating tension so dense it could be cut by a knife.
Harry's pants came off quickly and his half-erected penis welcomed Draco. It took Malfoy one glance at the other boy's face to realize that he didn't come to play. No teasing blowjob or cupping balls was on the list at that moment, the paler boy wasn't in charge.
Draco found himself lacking closure for the past few weeks, even longing for something he had never received – hugs. He only imagined how it felt because the distant memory of his mother hugging him as a child had faded long ago. The closest skinship he got was, yet again, from Potter, but he didn't think about it that way.
Harry had no place to go after saying goodbye to the only family he had left. It wasn't like he minded not living with his uncle anymore, but crashing at Weasley's wasn't a permanent solution either. Hogwarts was the only place he felt at home, even after all the years and events that had happened. It was only natural to agree once Ronald suggested coming back for one more year.
Not everyone has lost purpose in their life after defeating Dark Lord. Those words, repeating in his head, caused a twist to tighten in his stomach. Swallowing dryly, Harry left the room, pushing the uneasiness into the back of his head.
“Are you aware of how dangerous and irresponsible that was?” McGonagall asked with eyes full of iciness. Draco had to avert his gaze.
Draco wished to yell at Potter, so many sentences flooded his brain, but only a laugh escaped from his throat. Tears filled his eyes so quickly he had to leave before that idiot noticed.
That’s why when he took a right turn and finally appeared in front of the hospital ward, the crowd of students lurking around the main doors made him uneasy. It could only mean that the word about Potter’s clumsiness spread around – not that it was anything new. But it also meant Harry was still there and probably not in the best condition. Draco made his way through the group of younger students and entered the ward. He was not expecting four pairs of eyes to greet him the moment he closed the door behind himself.
Malfoy watched the scene in front of him, having to stop himself from jumping out of the bed and saving the famous Harry Potter from falling.
He didn't lose his balance completely but it made him to stumble awkwardly around before standing still again.
The single bed creaked heavily. This part of Hogwarts was still under renovation and the old bed should have been thrown out a long time ago, yet the pair hid it well in a small, vacant room. It was only a temporary solution, but it served them well.
Or so Harry thought but when Malfoy turned abruptly around and faced him, he surely didn't expect it.
"Nice observing skills, Malfoy. I was worried you'd mistake me for Santa Claus." Harry was surprised by the harsh tone that escaped from his throat. The word choice he just used wasn't typical for him either.
"Impatient, aren't we? Seems like you're the one pent up here." Harry commented with a smirk, his dominant side taking over. Malfoy's eyebrow arched up and he gifted the other boy an amused look.
"If my humble look doesn't fit your tastes, I'll save you the misery of looking at me and take my leave." Draco spat out so hatefully, yet so calmly it gave Harry another chills. As swiftly as Malfoy undressed, he was fully clothed in a moment.
“Were you the one who administrated the antidote to Mr. Potter?” The headmaster asked, going straight to the point. Although the answer seemed obvious to Malfoy, he realized nobody else probably knew with certainty what happened yesterday.
He had become a double spy, like Severus, in his fifth year and joined the Order. Seemingly fighting for one side, secretly working for the other left him split. Being the cause of people dying on either front, putting up an act, and dancing on the edge of death every day was something a fifteen-year-old wasn't made for. Though, Draco was somehow grateful to his father. If anything, he taught him to preserve, to stand proud, and don't waver. That was also why the betrayed and utterly disappointed looks on his parents' faces left him broken.
"Shut up." Draco breathed, faint blush flushing his cheeks. It was hard to tell if it was from the arousal or Potter's previous comment. Maybe both. "I have no desire to listen to your fantasies." He snapped and Harry's face showed surprise. They rarely talked during their acts and the submissive Malfoy usually did not strike back.
"I'm just a bit tired." He said after a while, breaking the silence between them. That was true, Harry was tired and still angry at how his body responded. He felt gross.
"Easy. It's almost over, just bear with it for a little longer." Draco uttered gently. So gently that Harry forgot about the pain for a second.
His steps stopped at the bridge that stretched over the deep chasm. A small cloud of warm fog was creating around Harry's mouth as he leaned his elbows on the railing. The freezing air made his whole body tense but his mind finally seemed at peace.
Harry's brain was tingling and he could feel the pressure taking over, he wasn't able to stop it anymore.
Their eyes met, catching Draco off guard. He was feeling sentimental which made him vulnerable and he looked away first. Normally, he wouldn't have lost in their staring contest so easily. His moment of weakness pissed him off to the point he got up and left, not giving Potter another glance.
"Listen here," he leaned close, whispering to Harry's ear. "You can go and fuck every person you come across in the hallway and I couldn't care less."
“I detected a short-term paralysis in his left arm but Mr. Potter should regain his full control within a month. He was truly very fortunate to have you around Mr. Malfoy.” Madame Pomfrey responded to Draco’s question and nodded her head. “But what brings you here today?” She asked in return the blonde boy.
He managed to sneak into the dorms without any problems, it must have been really late because even Filch wasn't around anymore. As Harry struggled to open the main door, which was spell protected after curfew, he noticed a light coming from the common room.
To say he had lost everyone was an exaggeration, but not so much. There was one particular person who triggered his nerves, had he done so from the beginning of the first year. Harry Potter was a reason for Draco to keep himself together. He treated him the same way regardless, the familiar hatred but not hostility he felt every time they spoke lessened Malfoy's loneliness. It was like a safe place that had never changed despite circumstances. Their relationship wasn't shifted even after they started fucking.
Harry felt a feeling of relief slowly spreading through his body. The effect was almost immediate, the horrifying purple color started fading visibly as well. It'd only been a few seconds and his state was already a lot better.
Malfoy was on his back, holding a book in one hand, the other resting behind his head and serving as a pillow. He didn't notice that someone had entered the room. His guard was lowered and he turned all his attention to the book of advanced potion brewing.
"Has all the fame finally kicked in and made you blind, Potter?" A familiar, piercing voice brought Harry back to reality. The blonde boy appeared in front of them, smirking widely. Harry bumped into him gently while day-dreaming.
It was a sight that bothered Harry. It bothered him to the point that when Draco undressed in front of him and revealed his thin, bruised body, he could not hold back anymore.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows, but not in a way that demanded Harry to finish his sentence. It was more of a 'I'm done with you so let go' way. This was definitely not the right place, time, and person for Draco to break down. His last week was so shitty he decided to forget it. But the boy who-minds-everyone's-business-except-his was making it rather difficult.
"Okay, I guess this will hurt," Malfoy said when he finished preparing the injection. He ignored Harry's remark completely, since there wasn't enough time for their petty arguments.
"Nghh." Malfoy let out a muffled moan with his eyes shut tightly and the back of his palm covering his mouth.
Second; no kissing. This was given. Blowjobs were a yes but kissing any part of the other's body was something neither of them ached to do. Kissing was a next-level intimacy the two arch-enemies didn't have.
"Scorpion's poison mixed with dragon's blood. Touched my failed potion with bare hands." Harry explained, letting his body fall and making an impact with the hard, hospital mattress. His eyelids were too heavy to keep his eyes open.
"Gosh, one doesn't need to attend Divination lessons to see it. You have it written all over your face." Draco finished fixing his appearance, looking neat and fresh as always. "Not that I care." He added after a while.
Harry blinked twice before backing down, letting Draco breathe steadily again. He didn't realize how much strength he used until he noticed a red mark from his wand on Malfoy's neck.
It was just a short, almost polite remark, insignificant to Harry since he was so used to saying it, but it happened. Potter’s strong complex to save everyone reached him, after all those helpless years. For the first time, he meddled in Draco’s business to help him and not investigate or framing Malfoy for something he did not do.
"Phleashe... Imm cummhing!" He screamed and his eyes closed in ecstasy as the white liquid sprayed over Draco's hand. Harry drove his post-orgasmic wave while the blonde boy thrust in a few more times before reaching climax himself.
Day passed quickly, but not as quickly anymore. Harry felt as if he was dreaming through the classes. Maybe he was, but one look at Malfoy brought him back to reality. A reality he so desperately wished to escape from.
"See you next week." With that, Maloy was gone. The room fell into silence after the sound of the slammed door stopped resonating between the walls.
"Oh, almost forgot." Malfoy stopped himself before exiting the room. He waved his wand lazily, untying Harry's hands quickly.
Harry ignored the other boy's call and started moving, which abruptly silenced Malfoy yet again. During those three months, he realized Draco was sort of a masochist in a twisted way.
"I'll just have to show them to you then," Harry smirked, pulling Draco's legs up and placing each of his feet on his shoulders. Draco's eyes widened in surprise as he found his body halfway up in the air.
The bustle of platform 9 ¾ is around us. Ginny is smiling and fussing over the children. I told her to stay home, but she wanted to say goodbye to me at the station. James is with Hermione so she only has to juggle two children but it is still a tad bit annoying. I really love my children a lot but I don’t need them in the middle of all this ruckus as long as they are still this young. So my eyes wander away from her and over the masses of people.
Both of our eyes snap up to the blonde. He strokes Dragon’s head as he stands up. Lowly humming under his breath, he waves his movable hand and the empty plate floats slowly over towards the sink. It looks like he planned to put it into the sink, but the plate drops a bit too early. Instead of landing cleanly inside it hits the edge of it and topples down with a loud clanging sound. Draco glares at it as if it personally offended him. I exchange a look with Hermione before we both break out into laughing at his expression. That earns us one of his ‘you’re an idiot’-looks but only causes us to laugh harder.
He snorts again, “Unfortunately the world runs on pretty looks and money, not bravery and good deeds. You are still too naïve.”
I nod and push the blonde further towards the head to give the woman access to the horse’s side. Draco follows me willingly as long as he is allowed to keep contact with the animal. Andrea steps away again to return with a girth and a large blue cloth. She puts the cloth on Shenan’s back, making sure to put the fur down so it won’t hurt the horse. She fastens the belt around the palomino’s body, two grips now up on the animal’s back. She nods at me and we exchange positions again, Draco letting himself be led.
I stay silent, because I have no idea what to say. Sure, I could give him the motivational speech I usually do, but it doesn’t seem to fit right now, so I let him decide.
I only just make it before I stumble over a towel on the ground, banging my hand on the sharp edge of a counter. I fall down in front of the toilet and start retching violently into it. It seems everything I ate the day before is determined to leave my body again.
“The wizarding world is more open than muggles. You can marry or bond, which is the wizarding equivalent, whoever you want,” then she grins, “And thanks to magic you can even have children between you two without adopting.”
“Alright,” she grins while leading me towards the back, “Is there anything else I need to know? Like something he is especially afraid of?”
I don’t know what I expect but it certainly isn’t this. Again it takes some time until he even does anything. But then he slowly reaches out one of his bone-thin hands towards me. It is slow and shaking but he certainly does react. Then his ice-cold hand lands on my cheek, that crooked smile still on his face. He isn’t even really looking at me. I gasp and my pained face falls against the bed.
“Alright,” she picks up a plastic container at the side of the door filled with brushes and the like. She takes one out and holds it out towards Draco, “Here. The first step is brushing her fur.”
Kingsley browses through the sheets, “Indeed if this person is Draco Malfoy he deserves honours more than a prison cell. However you have not given me proof yet. Even though I believe you, the council will not.”
“Draco Malfoy,” I sigh, shaking my head and rubbing the heavily scarred skin, “You are a mystery all over. What other secrets have you been hiding all these years?”
“It’s not only that. I can see that he is still suffering. I want that to stop. Despite the fact that I still don’t know everything, he has been through enough. Too much and I am talking from experience…” I sigh, my eyes downcast.
“On the horse’s bare back?” I stare at him. How is that supposed work? I touched Shenan’s fur, it’s kind of slippery, I can’t imagine getting any kind of grip on that, “Isn’t that difficult? Or dangerous?”
I miss our time in Hogwarts. Even our fights. Will you ever know how much I crave your presence? Will you ever know how much I care?
This time he does react and opens his mouth. I give a small smile and put the mashed potatoes in his mouth. He closes again and chews. It earns us a giggle from the girl.
“I’m not sure whose job it is to take care of his fortune. Usually it’s his guardians. With his parents out of the picture and Snape, his godfather, dead, it’s more difficult. The Malfoys’ solicitor was killed during the war, so no one is reviewing their papers either. Draco can’t do it himself for obvious reasons, so it might fall to the person taking care of him.”
Draco only blinks. Yes, any kind of (human, he seems to be working quite well with any kind of animal) social interaction is still his biggest problem.
“So were there spies who had the dark mark? I mean, I know Snape was one of those, but apart from him.”
On the other hand he seems to endure apparition surprisingly well. He twitched when we tried it the first time and seemed massively confused and at first a bit scared when we appeared in a totally different location. But all in all it’s good that we can apparate with him. Otherwise we would have had to think about sedating him on our way to therapy and neither of us wants to do that.
“During the final battle,” she corrects me, “Not to mention that you were still only seventeen, so still kids if you ask me.”
“I haven’t seen him, but if I do, I could call you. Do you want have my number?” she is worried too, since she has come to care about Draco too.
Surprised I look at her for a moment. Then the words register in my brain and I burry my face back in Teddy’s hair as light blond hair and silver eyes flash through my mind again. I groan. Andromeda laughs softly.
“As you maybe know the Malfoy case has been opened again. There will be a new trial for Draco. The Ministry requires a preliminary statement from him,” he replies, completely ignoring the second part of what I said.
“That shows a different side of his story, that’s for sure,” he nods contemplatively, “And at Hogwarts?”
Andrea still hasn’t appeared, so he steps back out, uncaring of the horse hair on his shirt, and closes the door behind him. His eyes flit up to me for a second then turn away again. He crosses his arms in what I now recognize as a defensive action. His gaze is still averted when he asks.
“That was close,” I breathe, “Alright. So you can drink on your own but hold nothing even a bit heavier for longer than a minute. We might have to work on that.”
I know Draco might be too aware here, but for him (in this story) the horses are his safe place where he doesn't need to hide himself and so he can push past the haze.
She returns the expression, “I found support though. I met with a woman whose husband used to be a Slytherin. She is more than sympathetic to Draco. She even insists on getting him a Merlin’s Order.”
You will never know we spent a night together in sixth year. You will never know you have a son even older than James. You will never know that I still love you. Because of one Obliviate, because of one sentence maybe carelessly spoken by you, you will never know any of this.
His steps are slow, but to anyone not looking he would probably look as regal as his father used to walk. Malfoys probably don’t run or speedwalk either.
“Well at least I have persons who would want to have sex with me and I’m not still a virgin like you!”
She bows and apparates away. I take a deep breath and grip the handle of the dark door in front of me. I swing the door open and take my first look inside. And am surprised. For one Draco seems to have known about the existence and use of windows, because two of the walls (it’s a corner room) have both two of them. Apart from that the room looks very impersonal. Very little decorations, no posters, no photographs or trinkets. The bed is pretty big and covered in green sheets (not surprising). On the expensive looking desk to the side is a potions book. Still open, like Draco just left to get something to drink. The shelves are full of books about potions, spells, dark magic, healing and other subjects from school. I can’t spy any novels or magazines. Doesn’t he have any or are they somewhere else? The walls are bare apart from two drawings in pencil. One is of a Quidditch player, most likely chasing the snitch. The second is of an elegant horse, reeling up majestically. I smile softly and trace the lines of the broom. Did Draco draw that? It’s beautiful. I sigh and turn back to the rest of the room. Let’s try to find out if there is something interesting here.
He sighs as he sits down at his desk, “The council won’t be happy with me if I do it without asking them first. However I agree with you that Malfoy should not spend a second longer in that hellhole.”
I have also found nearly everything in here by now. From prototypes for school letters over grading sheets and lists of pupils. From personal letters between Order members over meeting protocols to attack plans and even the occasional spy report. I also found some knitting magazines that belonged (with 99% certainty) to Dumbledore and a few of the aforementioned sweets bills. I sigh and cough as I pull at a dusty box in the corner.
“I doubt that is going to happen, but the one memory should be enough to convince the ministry. Together with the reports,” I say as I dip my head into the fluid, the girl following me.
I am reading through one of the books I got from my teachers in the healing classes. I decided to become a healer in the end. Even though both Hermione and Ron urged me to become an auror like I said in 5th year. Everyone thought I would apparently. But I have had enough of fighting the bad guys for a lifetime from these seven years. I needed to do something else. As a healer I can help people just as well and don’t have to throw curses ever again. I spent about half a year after Hogwarts not sure what I wanted to do but then I went to Malfoy Manor again and nicked some of Draco’s healing books (together with the drawing of the horse and some of his sketches). I read some of them and found it interesting. That’s when I decided that healer is the job I want to do. Two months ago I have started classes and I enjoy them.
Soon the professor calls for attention and the room quietens, everyone moving to their places. Papers are passed out and the scratching of quills starts as soon as the teacher calls to begin. I am tired and from time to time the letters swim in front of my eyes. I manage to answer nearly all questions anyway, even if I feel ready to fall asleep any moment. Eventually the professor calls for everyone to put their quills down before I can get started on the last question. I sigh, but it went better than I expected after two weeks of little and one night of no sleep at all. So I will leave it be. I drain the last of my coffee while everyone else packs up and starts to leave. I yawn widely as I pad past the professors.
Andrea startles me when she steps next to me. Just before she can open her mouth and call out to Draco, I put a hand on her arm and shake my head, telling her not to interrupt him. Instead I take up the tool to clean out Shenan’s hooves and push it soundlessly towards Draco. Wandlessly I loosen the sling that is holding his left arm.
“Well at least I have persons who would want to have sex with me and I’m not still a virgin like you!” It hurts to keep up all those lies.
“I look like someone tried to turn me into ground meat!” he yells back, shooting around, rage and despair in his eyes, “My looks used to be the only thing I really had control over and now!”
“So, uhm,” I start, in an attempt to come up with something to distract him, but anything wizard-related risks bringing triggers into the conversation, so I am running short on topics, “You talked about your own horse back then? Karina, was it?”
He just cocks his head to the side again, hand still caught in mine, “I take that as a ‘no’,” I give a sad smile and lay his hand back in his lap, only to softly reach out for his left hand, “What is with your other arm?”
“He hurts me,” he mumbles, carefully peering at me with unseeing eyes, “I didn’t even do anything wrong. Neither did that house elf.”
When I don’t answer her, she only gives a wet snort and turns around, stomping down the corridor away from me. I am left there standing shocked. I look like I am in love while I am reading the reports of Spy A? Such a bullshit! How can you be in love with a person you know nothing but the gender of? And where does she get the idea that I’m gay. Granted I have long suspected that I am bisexual. My obsession with Malfoy is way too strong. Only when a gush of cold air rips me out of my musings, do I remember my original destination. I was on my way to McGonagall’s office to floo over to Andromeda’s house and visit Teddy.
The next big step happens once again with the horses. Three more weeks after my exam (which came back with a surprisingly good grade, even though I think Professor Javis might have had something to do with my test getting graded a bit more towards the positive) we are on another horse therapy session. Just me and Draco. Hermione hasn’t been accompanying us for a long time anymore. Especially not since Draco has started to consider the stable a safe place too (as long as there are not too many other people there).
I nod, my throat still choked. After stroking the gaunt face a last time, I leave the now asleep boy alone in the room. I follow Hermione back to the sitting room from before, the food still on the table under a heating charm. I sigh and let myself fall into the sofa next to my friend who rubs my upper arm soothingly.
“What could be more important than clearing the wrong accusations and receiving a just punishment instead of what he got now?” I sigh, downing the rest of my glass.
The guard (it reads Michael on his nametag) nods and makes a short notice over the magic walkie-talkie on his belt. Then he comes out from behind their desk and waves to us. Entering the first room, he turns around.
I give her a sad smile, “Well, I have a friend. He’s… in a very dark place right now, traumatised. He used to have a cat when he was younger so we thought getting one now might help him. But of course in such a case I can’t have one that startles with every jerk he makes or gets impatient when he doesn’t pay attention to it immediately. And since his trauma is also connected with physical pain, getting scratched might have adverse effects.”
It’s Draco! I nearly startle away, but he makes an uncomfortable sound at my movements so I go still again. He huffs in his sleep and digs his face into my arm. I shush him carefully and stroke his hair. He pulls a face at my touch, which causes me to chuckle a bit. His nose scrunches up and while I think about how cute it is, I don’t notice his own eyes drifting open. The moment his sight seems to clear, his eyes go wide in shock.
“What?” he snorts, “Are you feeling sorry for me now? Stop it. I got myself into it on my own and I can deal with it on my own. I don’t need your help or Severus’ or my mother’s.”
And that’s how Hermione finds me over an hour later. My wards are open for her, so she walks right in and as I don’t react to any of her calls, she simply searches the house for my magical signature and comes up into Draco’s room. She gasps when she sees me sitting there, slumped in front of the bed. Hurriedly she crosses the room and kneels before me.
I sigh, taking his hands in mine, because I don’t dare to hug him, “As much as I hate to say or even think it, because it’s not fair to you, but… By getting marked and subsequently being forced into Voldemort’s inner circle, you did more good than you could have ever done if you joined the light side straight away.”
Motioning me to sit down on the chair in front of the (slightly chaotic) desk, she goes to the other side. After a bit of rummaging she draws out a few sheets and snaps a pen from the side of her computer.
But when I got the first 3 grades today, they all came back with a 1, at the beginning (german university system where 1,0 is the best you can get and 5,0 the worst). So my mind is collected enough again to upload, yay ^^'
He holds her gaze for a few moments before flitting away. Thin arms cross and his posture becomes defensive once again.
Focusing back on the task at hand, I reach down to his pants, the same dirty grey. Even though I am as careful as I can, he still flinches when it slips down his thighs, but then he goes slack, like he lost every last ounce of fight in him. I run shaking hands through his hair, an awful suspicion creeping up on me.
“I agree without a doubt,” she nods then suddenly grips one of my hands, “But you look not that much better than him, Harry. You should take better care of yourself.”
I waver for a moment, but then nod, “Yes, thank you. I just don’t think he will react well to strangers.”
There is a clearing in front of me. And the grass is littered with bodies. Dead bodies. And I recognise every single one of them. All of them people important to me.
I wrote that note years ago, but since I never uploaded the chapter on fanfiction.net, it remained in Word.
“That’s good,” she takes out a stack of sheets, “Then you will now have to sign the papers for him.”
“Really?” she leans over the pensive together with me, “That would be enough proof. Especially if we could get his memories to confirm it.”
“What did father do this time?” he prods and moves the arm carefully as if to test out how painful it is. A frown creases his forehead, “It doesn’t hurt though. But why can’t I remember it?” he shrugs, “Maybe he knocked me out again…”
As it turns out, getting Draco off Shenan at the end of the session is probably the most difficult thing we faced all day. He doesn’t want to let go of the grip, not to mention actually step away from the horse. As much as I hate to do this to him, I have to use a bit of magical persuasion to finally get him back on the ground. To placate him, Andrea lets him help with pulling the gear off Shenan and groom the horse once she has the animal back in the stable.
“Naturally, that is a requirement if he wants to clear so much as some of his guilt,” he explains calmly, my anger rising further once again. When he starts again, my patience rips another time, “And now – “
Her face has been getting sadder too, “I understand. Give me a moment. I will look which of the cats might fit your profile.”
“And you want to protect me by not telling me that it can’t stay that way?” I make a guess, voice steady even though my stomach clenches at the thought of losing the joy now residing in Draco’s eyes.
She sighs and runs a shaky hand through her brunette locks, “Technically yes, but the chances are very low. It has only worked like five times ever. And with as deep in as he is… I really don’t think it is going to work.”
Then it fades into silence, both of us watching the blonde slowly run his fingers through white fur, accompanied by loud purring from the content cat.
“He did not look any better when we saw him at the Manor. He looked like a ghost at the time,” I answer with a sad smile.
“It’s about Draco,” I sigh, motioning to the still figure on the bed behind me. The girl gives me a knowing expression, but I ignore her, “I pushed him too much and he freaked out.”
“You were enemies and now you’re taking care of him. What changed your opinion towards him?” he carefully phrases it differently.
She nudges past Draco to get to Shenan’s head. She pulls a leather bridle from outside the door and the mare dutifully lowers her head to let the woman pull it on. The bridle lacks the bit in the mouth though and the strap across the nose is thicker with three small rings attached to it.
Unfortunately that first attack seems to have triggered the rest of them. Just the same afternoon a loud panicked shriek rips me out of my peace in the library. From shock I drop the book about magical healing I was reading. My wand is in my hand and I am down the stairs before it has even properly registered.
A chuckle sounds from the figure, “Come on, get up. You’re only going to hurt yourself further by staying there,” when I don’t show any reaction, the voice sighs and clears her throat, “Oh Draco, what are you doing here? You don’t look that good today.”
Bringing him out front on the street with other persons worked a good deal less. I tried after ten days of peaceful time spent in the garden. To say it didn’t go well would be an understatement. He froze as soon as I opened the door. The sound from the relatively calm street outside was enough to scare him. I tried to coax him over the threshold but I had to give up before I pushed him too far and caused another breakdown. Three more tries didn’t get me much further. I managed to get him out on the steps but that’s about as far as he would go. The last time one of the people walking by looked at him or more likely just looked in his direction accidently because I put a barrier around us so no one can see us unless they are especially searching. As soon as he saw the woman’s gaze turn on him he ripped himself free from me and took a staggering jump backwards only to land on his back in the entryway of the house. I decided to leave that subject be for now.
I on the other hand carefully approach Draco who is sitting on the ground in front of his cot, staring at the opposite wall, grey prisoner’s clothes covered in dirt. Even though I make no effort to hide my approach he doesn’t so much as turn his head. So I kneel down in front of him.
I am really sorry for the long delay in updating but when I returned from holiday my laptop wouldn't start and I haven't gottten a new one yet.
“Broken bones, 16 in the last year alone…” Hermione breathes, a shocked hand on her mouth, “Bruises and cuts, more than I can count… Severe damage to internal organs…” she chokes, “Heavy anal scarring…?!”
“Then I will make sure he gets the post-mortem honours and be done with it,” I sigh, not really wanting to think about that (pretty likely) possibility, “But for now I prefer to think about saving a person undeserving of punishment from Azkaban.”
Today’s study session though is interrupted by the floo flaring, alerting me to an incoming call. I throw a cautious look towards the door to make sure Draco isn’t coming in. It’s been a long time since he saw the green flames last, but when he did it ended with him hiding in the corner for the better part of an hour. He might be better adjusted now, but that would probably stretching it. When I see that he’s nowhere close I step in front of the fire, the floo telling me that it’s just Andromeda calling.
Instead he stumbles past me to Shenan, saddle still in his arms. He takes a breather against her side, but then tries to lift the saddle up on her back. It doesn’t work, his arms are too weak to get the equipment higher than his chest. He tries and fails again, causing him to huff in frustration. For a moment he hesitates, looks around to make sure no one but me is watching him, then he mumbles a spell under his breath. The magic he can access past the binding is enough to make the saddle basically float on Shenan’s back on it’s own. He catches it again and carefully lowers it to avoid hurting the mare. Once it’s settled, he starts tugging at the saddlecloth and stroking the fur back underneath it. I watch him in fascination until someone puts a hand on my shoulder, causing me to nearly jump out of my skin.
The rest of the night stays free of nightmares for me and Draco too as far as I can tell. In the morning I wake up with him still in my arms.
“I know. Just a short answer, maybe? Otherwise the question is going to come up in the middle of the trial and you might prefer not to say it in front of countless people.”
Now it’s her time to blush. Even if they called her the brightest witch of her age at Hogwarts, if they had cooking as a subject there, she wouldn’t have gotten that title. Because to put it bluntly she is rubbish at it. I only ate her cooking once. That was enough of a trauma, not to mention the ten minutes I spent throwing up over my toilet. Ron was braver in that department and got food poisoning at least once for his efforts.
“Give him a safe space for the start. His room for example. Somewhere even you don’t enter unless it’s an emergency. Be there for him. With some luck he will remember that you are a safe person and trust you even if his memories are mostly overwhelming him otherwise. Make sure to trigger his memories as little as possible.”
At the end of the therapy session he is as relaxed as always, even though he wasn’t happy that Andrea wouldn’t let him gallop at all. He cleans up Shenan completely on his own this time, except her hooves because a moment as clear as the one earlier doesn’t come again.
“Then we will have to believe the reports of eyewitnesses and what other death eaters told us about you. That makes you guilty of all charges,” he explains nearly gleefully.
One hand never leaves his back as I steady him in the bathtub. He is sitting still, slightly slumped, apart from the occasional movement of his hand, splashing water a bit. I summon toiletries, towels and additional water over. Carefully I wet a cloth and then look at his face in confirmation for a moment, but he doesn’t react in the slightest, only stares straight ahead. I sigh but put the cloth to his back anyway. He doesn’t even flinch. I run the material half-way down his back, only for it to come back completely brown with a worryingly reddish tint immediately. I shudder at the amount of dirt on his skin. And I am worried that a large part of that dirt is actually dried blood. With a deep frown I put the cloth back in the water, colour releasing into the fluid.
However the current situation isn't doing me any good. I used to shut myself inside my room one to two years ago due to my mental health on my own. It simply wasn't a good time for me. I got better during the last year but now that I'm forced to stay inside, everything is coming back which makes it difficult for me to update. So I'm sorry, I will try to do better and if I'm lucky germany might lighten the restictions again on the 20th of April.
Eventually I have to break Teddy from his playing to get him to eat dinner. Not to mention getting food for myself. It tastes as good as it smelled and I enjoy a happy and carefree meal for once without having to coax a silent participant to eat at least a bit. After food my attention is once again diverted by Teddy who demands I play with him. I indulge him of course, his cheery attitude so different from my usual companion. It ends up being me tucking him into bed as well. After the toddler is peacefully asleep, I join Andromeda for a drink and some calm in the living room, in front of the fire place.
“I have the warrant here that you are to immediately release a prisoner,” I hand the paper from Kingsley over, “The minister has signed it. I wish to take Draco Malfoy with me now.”
Close to dozing off I suddenly look up when I hear whispers start in the round. And I immediately straighten up when I see why. There in the doorway is the person for whose trial I have been waiting the whole week. Draco Malfoy. The only Malfoy who will stand trial at all. Lucius was killed in the final battle, even though no one was sure what both he and his wife were doing on the battlefield since none of them had a wand. Narcissa was hit by a stray curse (most likely from a fellow death eater) as well. She isn’t dead, but her mind is wiped, leaving little more than hallucinations. That makes Draco the last survivor of his family. I am sure the weeks since the battle haven’t been easy for him. Having to grieve his father and look after his mother until they took him into custody and transported her to St. Mungos.
But his wife asks a different question, “Why do you refer to the spy as ‘he’ while you said you don’t know their identity?”
“Not yet, I would say. As much as it might help, it could also be that he might also react negatively to another living, moving being in the house. And if it doesn’t work out you are stuck with a probably hyperactive kitten on top of taking care of him.”
I chuckle, “Not at all,” I lay my head on my hands where they rest on the window frame, smiling at him, “I like it. I think it’s amazing how you care for the horses. It’s just…”
I reach out again, trying to touch his forearm, where I know the scar-covered dark mark lays. He twitches again, pulling a face. I smile sadly.
“Come on, Draco. Let’s get you to bed. It’s been enough for today I would say,” I say to him softly.
I nod and hurry after her. Unfortunately my fast approach seems to have garnered even Draco’s attention and he stiffens when I come too close, legs closing around the horse and hand white-knuckling around the grip. I bow my head and shush him, slowing my walk. Once I have come up next to Andrea, she throws a look at the blonde.
I have never married. My heart can’t get over you. I care a lot about Lou, but she’s just a friend. I work for an apothecary now, making potions. They hired me despite never officially having graduated and the faded dark mark on my arm. Lou’s helping me and we are planning to expand the business. Orion’s starting Hogwarts this year. That’s where I saw you. I was saying goodbye to Orion on platform 9 3/4 and there you were with your wife and your own children. It hurt, but the pain has numbed over the years.
I open my mouth to say something, but he is faster and hurriedly pushes me away from him, using both hands. I try to grapple for something but fail and fall backwards off the bed. His face is panicked as he struggles to sit up, while I rub my back.
He snorts and turns away. Instead he just nudges the mare again and she starts to trot. Fiddling a bit he shortens the reins, bringing up her head without pulling it up too far. I shake my head, apparently reading the horse books with him all the time also imbued some facts about riding in me.
It takes me a few seconds to realize that it’s not cat fur in front of my face, but human hair. It’s not that differing in color, but certainly another texture. I blink again, am I still dreaming? But the sight doesn’t change. Before I have time to think about it for longer though, the body before me gives a groan as he turns from his back to his side until he is laying with face to face with me, his hair laying spread out like a halo around his head.
I don’t know how long we just sit there, on the cold floor of the empty corridor. At some point Dragon has crawled back onto the blonde’s lap, purring and pawing at the boy which helps calm him as soon as he has recovered from his panic attack. I continue to hold him until I feel him slowly drifting to sleep, drained from two memory induced panic attacks in one day. Softly I shift him to pull him into my arms when I’m sure he’s asleep. The cat curls on his chest, claws extending just far enough to hold himself in the blonde’s shirt without injuring him. I stand up and give a small smile when the gaunt face cuddles a bit into my chest. I carry him and the cat to his room and tuck him in his bed. I sit there even longer, staring down at him with a sad smile until his first nightmare rips him from his sleep.
Anyway, we had just left the library when I hear a knock on the front door. It’s enough to make the blonde stiffen. I groan, there is a reason I told everyone to send a notice before actually coming over. Since I can’t just leave Draco alone in the middle of the hallway, I just ignore the knocking and walk him to his room instead. But apparently the person outside the door has never heard of patience before and in the two minutes it takes me and the blonde to reach the end of this corridor and turn a corner, they have stopped knocking. Only to have something like a shrill bell ring through the house. The first time it sounds, Draco nearly does a jump into the air. His eyes go wide, head thrown upwards. His breathing is getting faster, nostrils flaring nervously. Casting a pissed glare towards the door, I start rubbing his back and murmuring comforting words but it isn’t enough. I can feel him get worse next to me as I urge him to go faster so we can reach his room soon and can get him away from the sound. And then suddenly the last straw comes.
“Bullshit,” I give back, frowning, “I was worried, Draco. I came back and you were gone. I thought someone kidnapped you,” I tell him, purposefully leaving out that I was worried about him being out on his own as well.
“Yeah,” I sigh, “Draco just came in, saw the green flames and got scared. It seems he made some bad experiences with fire.”
A grunt from Draco breaks me out of my musings. Apparently the dragon has slipped his hand. The toy has fallen off the bed. The blond is making unhappy sounds. Well, it’s a step upward from complete silence, just still far from actual words. I am about to walk over to help him when he gives a louder huff and it looks like something under the stuffed animal explodes. It flies about two inches in the air, but unfortunately Draco doesn’t have the coordination to catch it yet. Once again, the dragon lands on the ground. The blonde makes another sound in the back of his throat and another invisible explosion throws the stuffed toy around, this time in entirely the wrong direction though.
I am just watching him when I notice the stable’s owner come towards us. To not disturb him, I distance myself from Draco a bit. The older man nods at me and holds out his hand when he reaches me.
The man looks up surprised then sighs, “Harry. I was just waiting for you to do that someday. What is it?”
But I wouldn’t have needed to say that because just as my friend starts to make her way towards that direction, the blond woman is already approaching us with a strong stride. I am glad that Draco seems out of it and doesn’t notice her.
There Draco is indeed, still looking paler than two days ago, his muscles slightly tense. Nonetheless he looks up from the book on his lap when the door creaks open. He gives me a tight smile as he spots me. I smile back and let myself fall onto the sofa next to him. My left hand strokes his hair and he calms down, letting his head fall against me.
“I don’t know,” she answers, “but even though all our horses have normal saddles, this is a therapy stable and we don’t give riding lessons. I am pretty sure he will grow bored with the therapy program soon. Nonetheless horses seem to be doing him a load of good, so normal riding lessons might do him good without boring him,” she looks unsure for a moment, “He can’t simply start riding in a group lesson of course, you have to find a stable that can work with his situation. Or his own horse if you have the money and possibility. Changing horses constantly might be a bad idea.”
“Yes, I know you were neglected and to a certain amount abused by the Dursleys,” I open my mouth to protest, but she cuts me off, “Don’t even try to deny it. I know.”
Life goes on. I get to know Orion well. He’s a bright and strong boy. I know you’re proud of him, I can see it. My chest hurts when I hear him bouncing around, giddy about his new baby sister. Just a friend, bullshit. You even have a child together now. I even meet the girl later when she comes to Hogwarts. Smart witch who lands in Gryffindor actually. That was a surprise for anyone around. A Malfoy in Gryffindor? The shock of the century (I am happy though). I’m pretty sure if Lucius could he would have rolled in his grave. I see you only at the station. My chest feels so tight every time I do. It hurts. Will you ever know how much it hurts me to see you with her?
She nods thankfully, “Give information for or about the Order to Mr. Weasley or his wife. They know what to do with it after that. What belongs to the school, please pack back into the shelves. And if you find something that was solely important to Dumbledore, you can either collect it or simply burn it. I am sure he had the bills for his sweets orders somewhere in here,” she shakes her head, “And it would be best if you could at least look through the files in the shelves and boxes too. Pull out those for the Order.”
She studies him for a few more moments before lowering her voice to ask something else, “Do you ever think about the future?”
Dragon meows as he is probably gripped closer again, “Malfoy?” I ask as I enter the room, having learned not to call him by his first name when he has his clear moments.
I can’t help but wish that one day I can experience such a scene without all that craziness. That even when he’s sane and good again, he will still let me close and maybe even let me see his vulnerable side. Him making a grumbling sound, rips me out of my dreamy state and I remember that it is high time for both of us to get some breakfast. Nonetheless I can’t stop smiling all the way through making it after seeing him walk on his own.
Lou makes polite conversation with me and I answer with half an ear. My eyes come to rest on you more than her. You look away from me, seemingly bored. But I notice your hand is interwoven with hers. Well what did I expect? She is an important person and I am only your former enemy.
Now it’s my time to snort, “He might never be able to stand on trial again, even only as a witness. And even if he can do it, it will take months, probably years until that. They can’t expect it to be accepted to wait that long.”
The stuffed animal is soft and pleasant to the touch. I can’t stop myself from burying my face in it even though Draco’s smell is long gone. I sigh and close the box then leave the room again. Wanting to check up on Draco before I go to sleep, I carefully open the door. To my surprise I see grey eyes staring straight at me. I freeze and give him another sad smile. Then I decide to approach him. If he’s already awake I can give the dragon to him now.
“Yes,” the house elf nods eagerly, “Tilly will make sure the prisoners stay healthy, but she must never let anyone find out about it. Tilly understands.”
“NO! Please no!” the blonde repeats and I am honestly at a loss about what to do, “I was good, I promise!”
“I gathered that much, since you have been standing in front of them for over twenty minutes now. But apparently you can’t find one you like. None of them catching your eyes?” she smiles.
I finally got a new laptop. I'm still struggling a bit with it though so this chapter is still rushed.
“Of course you can have it,” I choke, “It’s been yours and now you can have it back. You might normally not be in the age for stuffed toys anymore, but right now you need the anchor. So you can have it for as long as you want. It’s yours until the day you don’t need it anymore.”
From this passage it seems like Spy A also made sure that the prisoners kept in Malfoy Manor were at least treated properly. That may be a way to find out his identity. While I still doubt that he could have done that openly, maybe the prisoners know something. At least a clue.
I nod but before I can say anymore soft steps are coming down to the room. Cautious silver eyes peak around the doorframe. I smile brightly at him.
“Draco, please, wake up. Look at me,” I plead, tears running down my face, “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to push you. Please, focus on me. Come back, Draco.”
“Wander around the neighbourhood all night with no clue as to where your ward is,” she grins before waving her wand over the device, “Let’s go.”
He is doing his walk around the hall with Shenan right now. I am watching him and following at a safe distance. Only to see him lean close to the horse’s head, like he is trying to whisper in her ear. Activating a discrete listening charm, I notice that he is actually doing exactly that. It’s difficult to catch and even with the spell I can’t understand proper sentences, but it’s true. He is talking! Actual words. More than some sounds or unintelligible mumblings.
“I know,” I whisper, “Believe me, I am trying my best. But every time I say his name to the ministry they shut down. And I haven’t yet found proof that he did anything to warrant getting his freedom back. At least nothing the ministry would accept.”
“Yes,” she gives out a pained hiss, “I agree with you. I am just seeing this the rational way. Maybe,” she squirms uncomfortably in her seat, “it might be better to end his suffering. He has been through so much we don’t have to make him put up with even more. I…”
Only now do I realise that he must have fallen into one of the memory flashbacks Hermione talked about. Unsure what to do about it, my first action is to pick up Dragon. The blonde on the other hand has scurried away to cower against the wall. It reminds me of the first days after he came here. But this time he is constantly begging not to be punished. That’s even more painful than his silent panic. I crouch down in front of him, still in enough distance not to crowd him.
I sigh, “Fine,” and wave him past me, “But down in the kitchen,” he nods and I lead him into the old room after closing the door.
She hums approvingly but then frowns, “Wait a minute. I remember that report about this. The warning about that attack on the muggle governor’s family.”
“No, he never,” she falls silent for some moments, “Now that you talk about it. He sometimes disappeared and no one knew where he were. Later on Tonks seemed to be aware of it as well, but he never said anything about it to me. I’m sorry.”
That causes him to still. He doesn’t say anything, but since he doesn’t push me away either I continue to hold him. We sit like that for a few minutes before I feel his grip weaken and his body go slack. Bringing him upright reveals that he fell asleep. The emotional exhaustion must have caught up with him. I stroke a strand of hair out of his face, before carefully leaning him against the cushions. Lena comes over cautiously.
Harry slipped out as he felt himself going soft, letting himself collapse down next to lying Malfoy.
"Continue, I was enjoying the show," Harry ordered him with a teasing smile. Draco managed to frown before walking up to him.
The awaited help never came. In the end, Malfoy had to save himself and chose the winning side - The Order. Even after he made his choice, the situation didn’t improve, not how he imagined it would. His anxiety worsened and he could see no light at the end of the tunnel. Malfoy wasn’t suddenly less scared, less lonely nor more confident in his actions. If anything, he felt like walking on a minefield, one wrong step could get him killed – literally. The mere thought of him being discovered by Voldemort kept Draco up at night and made him shiver even after he died.
"As if." Harry was already sitting at the only piece of furniture there was - the old bed. He watched Draco slip off his shoes and socks and neatly putting them aside.
The big room seemed empty, with no staff or students. Harry hesitated before the itching and stabbing pain forced him to urgently find someone. It felt as if thousands of needles were penetrating his skin, painfully tickling him.
Draco lived under the impression of not being worthy of this help, but the moment he caught Harry’s interest and good intentions, something broke. It was as if a long-neglected child finally caught their parents’ attention.
"Don't mind him, mate," Harry muttered quietly and continued walking past the Slytherin boy. He didn't have the mental capacity to deal with Malfoy at that moment. Ron stared at his best friend's back before rushing to him with Hermione behind.
The fewer people you are tied to, the less you can lose. Harry has lost far too much in his life and it often left him wondering, what if things turned out differently? What if he was sorted to Slytherin and never gained the favor of Dumbledore? What if he never met Sirius and got his hopes up about living with him and escaping the hell of a house from his childhood? What if he never made friends with Ron and Hermione...? Would he still choose to come back when Voldemort killed him? Would he still be here now in that case?
It wasn't the longest they had sex, but neither commented on it this time. They were young and didn't take ages to get off.
It wasn't weird for some students to stay up late and study, but he surely wasn't expecting to see a certain blond-haired boy lying on the sofa.
Malfoy's eyes searched the room before landing on Potter and their gazes meeting for a brief moment. Draco continued to watch the other boy even after the eye contact was broken, his curiosity and interest were triggered for one simple reason.
"Didn't know this was a competition," Draco replied, sitting up. He reached for his wand and cleaned himself up with a charm. He then got himself dressed, carefully masking any signs which could give away that he just had sex.
The list of titles Potter had was endless. Draco hated it from the very bottom of his heart and soul. Especially the Savior, a title that made him grit his teeth the most. Potter was supposed to save everyone and he acted all high and mighty because of it. Always sticking his nose into everyone’s business. Always violating rules for the ‘greater good’ and being pardoned for it. Always doing stuff nobody asked for, just for his own sake of validation. Making people feel indebted to him, meddling in every situation, getting recklessly hurt, and being praised for it. What a might hero he was.
He blamed himself for all kinds of things, one would say that the creation of the universe was also his fault.
Yet he was still worried about… Potter. There were possible long-term side effects from the poison Harry touched. There was no guarantee Draco injected the antidote fast enough for no damage to be caused.
Harry thought as he put on his clothes, pondering on how he was burning up just a second ago. He left promptly, casting a masking spell on the door of the small room before heading back to his dorms.
Ron nodded slightly as a greeting, being lost in his thoughts. The essay he had due tomorrow was slowly eating his brain cells away, so he stood up from the table few moments later to stretch his sore body.
It was his turn to take a deep breath before replying. ‘This is what I get for trying to play a hero.’ Draco thought and rubbed the inner corners of his eyes with one hand. This situation was causing him a headache.
'...because I was worried? Because I noticed your strange wounds? Because I can no longer look at your worsening situation?'
Draco rushed down the corridor as quickly as he could, hoping he won't bump into someone again. The Hufflepuff's group earlier was already enough bully dose for the day.
"I'm... mhmm, shit, cumming!!" Draco choked as he sprayed all over the sheets. Harry came almost at the same time, letting it all out inside.
"Shit." Harry said, more to himself than the boy lying next to him, opening his eyes slowly. He came way sooner than his usual self.
Days passed quickly, maybe too quickly in Harry's opinion. Since the tense encounter with Malfoy, they haven't spoken. Harry would move past it, but there was one thing nudging him at the back of his mind. The blonde boy looked worse every time Harry saw him. It wasn't as if he paid much attention to Malfoy, but even then he could see how much he changed over such a short period of time. What baffled him more was the fact that nobody else seemed to notice. Or maybe nobody just cared enough to notice. To notice Draco's visibly dark circles, his paler than usual complexion, his blood-shed eyes, his bruises....
"Brilliant. Harry James Potter, that was just brilliant." Harry cursed under his breath, angry at himself but also at Malfoy.
Hogwarts was under renovation due to the increased amount of students flooding in, some older parts were made to dormitories and classrooms. Because of that, sleeping arrangements for 6th years and higher were temporarily changed, making everyone sleep in any available room. Naturally, Harry and his best friend managed to obtain a small, double-room for themselves before it was too late.
"I'm getting close..." He muttered quietly. Harry wasn't very verbal when he topped and he rarely moaned.
Draco was almost finished with his feast when the door opened and a short, slim figure sneaked in. He didn't need to be a Seer to know it was Potter. He would recognize that messy hair and lame glasses everywhere.
Potter grabbed Draco by shoulders and pinned him down against the bed, grinding their hips together in the process. They looked into each other's eyes, their every breath becoming more unsteady. Harry switched his weight from palms to elbows, lowering himself to savor Draco's pink nipple, pinching and fondling the other with his fingers.
Draco couldn't look at the other boy anymore and averted his gaze. "Not much to thank me for, plus you're not healed completely yet. Though rest can be done by Pomfrey when she comes." He said hastily and straightened himself up. "I should leave."
“Mr. Malfoy! I was about to call for you, good that you’re here.” The sharp voice of McGonagall sliced the awkward silence that caused Draco’s entry.
Harry got up and followed his archenemy almost without thinking. He didn't intend to approach him, he made sure the distance between them was big enough not to give the other boy any weird ideas.
"Uhm..." Ron cleared his dry throat to get his friend's attention. "Everything alright there?" He asked as they all sat down on a couch nearby the fireplace. The common rooms were now accessible to all students, regardless of their faculty.
He and Potter decided to use each other because it didn't bring any commitments. The assurance that it wouldn't ever develop to something more and the sole purpose of fucking was to get off, brought them to the situation they were in now. No jealousy nor a need to care, just freedom of pleasure the pair could enjoy without creating ties.
His mind was occupied with the words he had said to Potter earlier. He would've never admitted to anyone that it was based on his own struggles, not even himself.
There weren't any particular thoughts occupying his head, Harry just caught himself staring at the wall or random people around him after minutes of daydreaming. He was spacing out so much he didn't register when someone bumped into him on their way back to dorms.
"Have you ever done this?" Harry asked, feeling a bit worried now that his enemy was about to inject suspicious liquid into his body.
"I said that because it seems like you may need... a bit of help," Harry said so carefully as if he was talking to a child. In fact, that's wasn't far from true, because talking to Malfoy was like handling a timing bomb. It could explode at any moment.
Draco, on the other hand, was filled with rage. Before thinking, he grabbed Potter by his sleeve and yanked him back.
Draco was tired of this hide-and-seek game. Yes, he avoided Potter. His feelings were a mess and all his frustration was directed at Harry. Rightfully.
Harry pulled out his wand faster than Draco could notice, pressing it hard against the fair-haired boy's neck.
"Your expression said otherwise." He noted, spreading his legs as he sat down on Harry's lap, one knee wrapped around each side of Potter's torso. Then he proceeded to take off Harry's robes and shirt, making them both with only pants on.
Deep down, Harry knew that he was not directly responsible for the deaths of people close to him. At the same time, he blamed himself for ever meeting them, because it just brought misfortune. So much misfortune it cost them their own lives. Now his only nephew was growing up without his parents. The Weasley family would never be fully together again. Dobby won't ever come to visit him occasionally.
When there was a long silence in the room and Draco noticed everyone was looking at him, he interpreted it that it was time to leave. He was so deep in his thoughts he didn’t hear the question Madam Pomfrey asked him.
And the last one; no calling by their given name. Although it mainly applied to the first name there was a silent agreement that even surname was off track. The thought of having their surname called out in a wishful way only to hear it later on as a form of insult was something neither of the boys wanted.
He entered the common room swiftly, ignoring everyone and heading straightly to his shared bedroom with Zabini.
It was dark and peaceful outside. A thin layer of snow made the stone floor slippery and Harry almost lost his balance a few times. The bit of adrenaline rush he got from almost tripping over made his body warmer.
Nightmares that crept to his sleep every night didn't help. Voldemort wasn't there anymore to occupy his mind, but Harry still woke up frightened sometimes with vivid flashbacks planted in his brain.
"Yeah, thanks. Ron, you still have to finish your essay. I just remembered I wanted to visit Hagrid so I'm gonna come back in a bit." Harry quickly made up an excuse and left his two friends alone.
