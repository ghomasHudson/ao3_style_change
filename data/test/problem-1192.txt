“Right again.” Draco turned to pick up his jacket, apparently considering this conversation to be at an end. Harry stayed where he was, arms folded and eyebrows raised. “I presume the Lovegoods will have owl’d Scorpius whereabouts.” Draco continued, fussing with his glasses case. Glancing up at Harry, he froze. “Yes? Potter?”
After a while Snape got around to confirming the exact words of the prophecy he’d found (“by luck,” Harry’s throbbing brain insisted):
“Have you tried charm?” Poppy suggested when Minerva broached the subject. The school nurse was still flushed from the excitement of the match and the lack of blood was clearly affecting her cognitive abilities because-
“Yes, yes.” Draco waved the words aside, impatient with whatever social insurance Blaise was about to concoct. “Not a word to the others, you and Nervy are simply star-crossed lovers-” he felt a jolt of mean satisfaction at the uneasy glance Blaise threw towards the door. “I saw nothing, know nothing, consider me a vault, sealed and-”
“A bit, yeah. Sorry. Didn’t know you were, you know.” Ron mimed slicing his own throat in a gesture that was both overblown and completely accurate.
“I… Ok, yes, I did say that.” Draco reached up to fiddle with the hair curling behind his ear, immediately regretting the move as something cold slithered down his neck and into his collar. “I’m a problem solver.”
“That’s not how any of those sayings work.” Harry hissed while, somewhere in the back of his mind, acknowledging that this was actually a solid piece of advice.
Draco tried to imagine what it would have been like if his parents had done something similar, especially during his 5th and 6th years.
“Yes. Percy and his ardent defender who looks ready to insert one of her Louboutins into your ear.” Draco gives Pansy a small wave. She ignores him and continues to glare at Ginny.
“Think it’s best we get out the way.” Freckled fingers wrapped around Draco’s elbow and Ron started leading him towards an ambulance parked further up the street.
“M’fine.” Harry pulled Draco’s hand back down and waved the Healer away. “Just not used to being around this stuff anymore.”
“Good.” She beamed. “99 percent of magical beings underestimate the importance of hydration to a fulfilling sex life, it’s a pleasure to meet a fellow 1 percenter. That’s a pun, I’m Muggle-born.”
Draco almost replies. “Because I want to see your new tattoo,” is what he actually says, giving thanks that his tone remains light. For a moment he thinks Harry is going to refuse and then…
Even though he was the one who initiated it, Draco pulled out of the hand shake as if he’d been burnt. “Take it off.” He turned to Mr Snape.
This, Harry remembered, was when he genuinely thought someone was going to tell him what the bloody hell was going on. Instead, Snape and Hermione had immediately got into a prolonged discussion about how prophecies were formed before synthetic dragon’s blood was developed as a stabilising element.
Severus puzzled all this out as he absent-mindedly brushed biscuit crumbs from his robes and tried to avoid all thoughts of
“Of course this business with Scorpius has reinforced that wariness.” Draco hurried on. “People who are overly concerned with their appearance are not... they do not seem...”
As the only person who wasn’t involved in the prophecy, Snape had suggested he play the role of Forgiveness Facilitator. Unfortunately, he was about as good at teaching forgiveness as he was at teaching potions.
“Look,” he sighed, grabbing Draco’s hand. He fumbled with it a bit at first, taking a moment to make sure that all their fingers and thumbs were arranged in the most comfortable way. “I know you think that I’m an idiot-”
“Pack it in.” Harry doesn’t stand, but tips his head back as Draco moves closer. “M’fairly sure that saviour stuff is why they’re calling on a Sunday. Making sure I don’t get too up myself.”
“I’m just saying,” Harry whispered, “This is a man who created a spell “for use on enemies”, yeah? Are we sure he’s the best person for this forgiveness gig?”
“Wow! Really? Wicked!” Cormac exclaimed while examining a small ivory penis. Ron snatched it away from him.
The realisation that he could say whatever he wanted to Potter without worrying about it being used against him sank into Draco’s mind like a dollop of butter into a hot jacket potato.
“So, now that we have The Boy Who Lived supporting our cause, we can play a little game.” Malfoy’s eyes flicked to Harry’s when Harry muttered “not supporting,” under his breath. Smirking, Malfoy continued speaking to the audience. “As you can see I have some phallic objets d’art- ” fucking trust Malfoy to not call a dildo a fucking dildo, “ -and a number of unlabelled bottles of artificial lubrication. As you know, I am a Potions Master specializing in flavour making, testing, and tasting, and these are all my concoctions.”
"Of course. The usual spells will remain in place," said Snape, referring to the charms all match brooms were treated with to avoid any student having an advantage.
“Then you’re off the team,” George grinned, reaching down to give the bottle a spin. It caught on the bobbles of the scratchy hotel carpet and barely turned 90 degrees before stopping at Astoria Greengrass. “Alright Tori,” George cheered, laughing when Astoria turned pink.
“I suppose it wouldn’t hurt,” piped up Katie, tipping her head back and emptying a fourth (fifth?) packet of electric blue Nerds into her mouth. “We could make it so that if you don’t want to kiss someone, you’ll have to duel them instead and-”
“Squib and Muggle-born, thank you very much,” the Slytherin Beater corrected from her perch on top of the sanitary towel bin. If it was anyone else, Harry would assume that they just didn’t know what the bin was for, but considering that Mafalda was the student who had successfully campaigned for the theme of the last Yule Ball to be ‘Sexy Squibs and Mad-For-It-Muggles,’ it was probably some kind of Slytherin power move.
“You don’t even work for the Ministry.” Millicent pointed out as Ginny did some elaborate and—in Draco’s opinion—overly sexual warm-up stretches.
“Here we are.” They’d reached the fourth floor, stopped in front of a door that had scuff marks around the lock and a blue squiggle of spray paint across the peephole. The paint sparkled as Mr Snape passed his wand over it, fizzing as it started to move, spreading out to form a question mark. “Severus Snape,” said Mr Snape, gesturing for Harry to do the same.
“Yeah. Yeah alright, fair point.” It really was very, very early. Slipping his fingers behind his glasses to rub his eyes, Harry contemplated the merits of calling it all a bad job and just continuing to push his fingers into his eye sockets until they found brain. “Forgiveness, then,” he said, keeping his eyes closed for a precious few seconds more. “Until we come up with a better plan. How do we do this?”
"But the chance to practise with a Nimbus 2001." Flitwick's voice rose in agitation, the sound filled Draco with glee. "That will give Slytherin a great advantage over the other teams. Lucius Malfoy may hold sway with the Ministry but surely Dumbledore-"
“Exactly.” Hermione lifted her head, looked around at the three of them. “We’ve all done enough hiding and running, time for a new plan.”
All the petty humiliations Draco had thought he'd managed to keep hidden. He didn’t sleep that night. Instead he listened to the other boys breathe and seethed with humiliation that their conscious thoughts might be full of how poor the Malfoys really were. Did they know about his robes? He pictured them laughing to each other about his shabby trunk (“a family heirloom”) and the elderly Malfoy owl.
“See you later Harry,” Luna called. Raising a hand. Harry squeezed his eyes shut and pressed closer, closer to Draco. He’d worry about the glee in Luna’s voice later.
, Potter,” Draco hissed. “This is not the behaviour of someone showing a healthy appreciation for the Malfoy line, this is... this is...” he lowered his voice, glancing at the door. “This is the kind of behaviour Aunt Bella indulged in. The sort of thing that led to Death Eaters and, and, and, and Voldemort and the like.” Draco trailed off, blinking at Harry.
it made his head hurt. What did it matter if he was unable to recite all Umbridge’s silly rules at the drop of a Sorting Hat? He was still capable of telling when a pair of students were engaged in covert activities for The Order and Blaise was hardly an obvious suspect. Ginny on the other hand… “Leave. Now.” Draco turned to Janice. “Unless you wish to put my status on the Inquisitor Squad to a vote of confidence? In which case I would find myself compelled to ask Professor Umbridge to investigate your own activities on the night of the 23rd.”
“Indeed.” The smile slipped off Draco’s face and he turned his attention back to the hanging baskets.
Apparently unaware that Granger’s tears were as fake as Pansy’s nose, Umbridge was smiling. “Now, now, my dear. Are you ready to tell me how that nasty Dumbledore took advantage of you?”
“Oh, okay.” Harry nodded, took a deep breath. “Yeah, good point. Okay. I do want us to be friends.” A thrill shot through him as he watched Draco’s face fall slightly. “But, er, when I woke up and you were gone, on the last morning, I felt a bit empty? Maybe?”
“He won't be interested in you, if that's what you're hoping for.” Draco smiled as Ginny blushed and crossed her arms.
“Ghastly people,” Draco considered a theatrical shudder, then reconsidered when he realised it would place parts of him in sudden, repeated, contact with Harry. “We should follow them, or at least stop canoodling in a bog.”
The block of flats looked like it was held together by half-hearted sticking charms and luck that was about to run-out. A waft of urine floated down to meet them as they climbed the stairs. Breathing shallowly, Harry concentrated on putting one foot after the other. Mr Snape didn’t seem to be bothered by the smell. Tall, gaunt and greasy, he reminded Harry of a jolly Dementor, dancing ahead as Harry walked further and further into what could easily be a trap.
“Not today.” Pansy replies, rubbing a towel through her hair. “She called me ‘Pea’ the last time we were here.” The overly casual words drag Draco’s thoughts away from black ink stretched across soft brown skin.
“Ok? So you are coming back?” The hopeful expression on Potter’s face made it impossible Draco to answer, instead he nodded and reached for the restaurant door, closing his eyes as a familiar tug behind his belly button signalled the start of another time loop.
“Harry is a wonderful dinner guest.” Hermione joined in. “Your parents would be lucky to have him. Do you hear me? Lucky. If anything they should be begging him to join them.”
“Potter. Psst. Potter.” A bony finger lodged itself repeatedly in the soft flesh of Harry’s armpit. “Potter!”
“Exactly,” Harry moves closer, nudging his nose against Draco’s. “We’re in a library, Malfoy. Far too much talking. What would Madam Pince-” Draco cuts him off, chasing the words from Harry’s lips and valiantly rejecting all thoughts of Hogwarts librarians and dragon tattoos.
Severus Snape was thinking about HobNobs when he found the prophecy. Specifically he was thinking about the packet of half-eaten HobNobs he had seen Griselda Grimshaw tucking behind the microwave in the Department of Mysteries staff room. A well-paid position on the Hall of Prophecy restoration project was a pipe-dream come true, even if the work itself was a tad... monotonous.
“We aren’t.” Draco spoke, his voice strained and a dark pink flush creeping up his neck. “Do try to pay attention.” He turned to Harry. “I believe you were talking about…er…your mouth and my um…er…please. Do continue.
“What can I say, Potter? That I am extremely impressive? That I do rather relish an intellectual challenge? That I have a natural affinity for-”
“Right,” Harry echoed, watching in silence as Draco completed the rest of the obstacles. It was utterly humiliating, Draco quickly realised, trying to fumble and wiggle and flail one’s way through a swamp while the object of one’s… while the person one felt most… while a person, a person with green eyes and muddy glasses just… watched like some, with a look of…
“Progress,” Snape announced, sweeping into the living room. “Has occurred. The prophecy has a small, hairline crack.” He held up the prophecy to show them. Harry couldn’t really see any difference. “I believe we must attribute this success to the trust exercises,” Snape continued, swishing back and forth in front of the TV. “How many of them did you complete while I was gone?”
Potter chuckled and shook his head, “Bit gruesome, Malfoy, but you’re not wrong. When Lily was three one of Luna’s twins told her that the only reason she could understand anything was because there was a fish living in her ear, whispering all the words to her.”
—only to be stopped by Narcissa wrapping a hand around his wrist and giving a quick shake of her head.
Harry gave up on sleep around 4am. The sugar from the vending machine snacks was still fizzing through his bloodstream, the events of the game pinballing around his mind. Every time he closed his eyes, he remembered the way Draco had pressed forward to kiss him. Every time he opened them, he remembered that the kiss had happened on this very bed.
“Well I… I…” At a loss, Draco looked to the empty training room for help. “I’m sorry? If that made you uncomfortable.”
“He really doesn’t remember?” the pale man asked Mr Snape. “Well,” he didn’t wait for an answer, unfolding from the armchair and coming over to stand in front of Harry. “My name is Draco Malfoy.” A long pale hand was extended.
“No one is being forced to kiss anyone,” Angelina was saying. “We’re playing with the charm or not at all, and-” She was interrupted by a snort from Marcus. “Swear down I will come for you as well.” The Slytherin Captain’s snort turned into a gurgle as Angelina continued, stepping back to address the whole room. “If we play by Muggle rules, then Oliver, Marcus, Mafalda, Millicent, me, Fred, Astoria, Harry, Greg, Draco and Alicia can’t play. So what... we’re going to sit around and watch Katie, George and Cassius snog each other?”
This jumbled feeling lingered with Draco as he stumbled home, owl’d Scorpius and collapsed into bed. He dreamt of cereal and green eyes and woke in a cold sweat. Was Harry alright? Why hadn’t he waited for Draco after the second interrogation? What if he’d sustained some long-lasting spell damage during the raid that was only just becoming apparent? Should Draco call him? Text? Owl? Orchestrate an elaborate badge-centric flirtation?
“I just got on a different bus than normal.” Hermione shrugged. “They only had three tracking charms on me. Can you imagine?”
That particular evening Pansy had begged off, sighting homework and a date with Theo, and Draco was planning to spend the evening listening to the rather gruesomely titled ‘Meat is Murder’ and practise transforming old boots into daffodils. He’d been looking forward to it all day and was dismayed when, less than a minute after taking a seat behind the Inquisitor’s desk, Janice and Nigel marched in with two new prisoners.
Harry’s meditation on the bonds forged in the flames of athletic endeavour was interrupted by the second realisation: Draco Malfoy was sitting on his bed.
“No, Hermione’s moods tend to burn out pretty quickly,” said Harry. “Still, we should probably do what she said.”
“Are you bloody mental?” Ron rounded on his boyfriend. “If that came anywhere near your your arse, you would be as dead to me as the mummy that first used it.” At that he promptly pushed Cormac away from the stand.
“Um, I think it’s actually ‘huddle together’.” Judging by the way Draco shrank back against the headboard, that was very much the wrong thing to say. “I mean, if we’re going to do it we should call it by the right name.” Harry hurried on, reaching forward and pulling the duvet away from Draco. “Come on.” he wiggled down onto his back, holding the duvet open for Draco to follow suit.
“Are you telling me,” Ron’s voice was faint, “that there are people in this world who buy a dead person’s dildo and shove it up their arse?”
“Yeah, but she’s Games and Sports.” Harry smiled up at Draco. “Not exactly a normal bunch. Last time I dropped ‘round, one of them tried to convince me to use protein powder instead of sugar in my tea.”
Wouldn't she be pleased when she discovered that Draco had traversed the entire castle in ferret form? And with such good news to impart! An invitation from the Zabinis meant that Narcissa and Lucius could afford to summer on the Amalfi coast, without the added cost of a villa big enough to include Draco.
“What?” Draco glanced wildly at the restaurant and then back to Ron. “What are you doing here? You’re not cereal?”
“You want to sit outside?” Harry kept his eyes on the pixies as well. Was it possible that he liked looking at them? He’d as much as indicated in the Cereal Monogamist that he preferred his dates slim and pointy but Draco had assumed his taste ran to human-sized. “Not sure it’s warm enough for that.” Harry shifted slightly as he spoke and the backs of their hands brushed together. The soft pressure made Draco’s mind up for him and he spun 180 degrees, marching back the way they’d come. “Er, where are you going?”
“Almost.” Draco winced. “They recently transferred their, um, allegiance to me. Not that I have a cause to align to!” He hurried on. “Usually they keep their distance. This is the first time I’ve seen one of them in the flesh, so to speak.”
“Is that red and green fog part of the game?” he asked Draco. He was half expecting Draco to answer with some sneering put down, since Harry’s unfamiliarity with Magical stuff was one of Draco’s favourite jump-off points for a monologue.
“Thanks.” Harry didn’t really want to put the hoodie back on. He rolled it up and stuck it behind the pillow, propping himself up to examine the room. “If I ask you a question,” he said, “Will you give me a proper answer? Without being a dick about it?”
“What? Ahem.” He cleared his throat, trying to pretend that he hadn’t just squeaked. “No, I greatly appreciate your help. Please, do go on.”
about the Malfoy Martyrs. “Weren’t they involved in a domestic incident up North? Some protest in Leicester?”
“Thanks.” Harry grinned back. Just thinking about that morning still made something happy and hopeful swell inside his chest. The way the early morning sunlight had brought out the golden freckles that dusted the bridge of Draco’s nose and how Harry had—
hovering between them. Something that was hot and staticy and sometimes zapped gently at the back of Draco’s neck. He was fairly sure that Harry felt it too.
Harry gaped. Why had no one told him? How had he not known his grandfather was a fucking lube maker?
“Investigating the possibilities of obtaining our Animagus form should be a priority, however, before you arrived Professor Snape, myself, and Hermione, we, ah, we...” Malfoy trailed off, his neck going a splotchy pink.
“Right.” Harry pushed his glasses up and rubbed his eyes. The pressure was still there. “Because I don’t fucking trust him-”
Going to Hogwarts immediately soothed Draco’s ferret. His spontaneous transformations practically disappeared overnight, aside from an embarrassing incident after being caught out of bed by Professor McGonagall. Pale, trembling, and still bewhiskered, Draco had sat in McGonagall’s study while she and Snape whispered to each other behind a Muffliato. Was he going to be expelled? Reported as an illegal Animagus? Would his mother be put in prison? What would his father say? Panicked plans for escape chased each other through Draco’s mind and by the time McGonagall returned to the sitting room he was halfway through another transformation.
“Oh.” Harry didn’t really know what else to say. It was a bit embarrassing to have all this explained to him in front of everyone. “Does everyone know the charm?”
“Harry!” Katie yelled. “It’s your go!” The Gryffindor Chasers always got a bit rowdy when they’d had too much sugar, and Harry had learned the hard way that immediate obedience was the only option.
. Draco repressed the now familiar desire to scoff at the babyish design. It was part of the same set that Daphne’s mother used for their Halloween high-tea, very much a novelty item and not to be used day-to-day.
“Wait,” Draco held up a hand, cutting Potter off halfway through. “Don’t tell me. I shouldn’t have asked, Scorpius would kill me too,” he tried to smile but felt it warp into a grimace, Potter grimaced back.
"Salazar, what does it matter?" Draco had asked, admiring Blaise's handmade Italian leather brogues and the understated gold serpent tiepin, glittering in the firelight. "Still Blaise, I take it?" He stepped forward, holding out his hand. A beat passed and then Blaise nodded and accepted the handshake. "Excellent, you can bunk next to me. Vincent-" Draco redirected his attention. "You can move into the spare bed, take your snoring with you." It wasn't a very good joke, but Blaise laughed and the ice melted away, leaving Draco with a potential new rung on the social ladder.
Unsure of how best to comfort Draco without insulting Draco’s pride by appearing to actually try to comfort him, Harry stayed silent. Except for his teeth. They were now smashing together like the hail starting to bounce off the pavement. After a moment the noise attracted Draco’s attention as he turned rather bloodshot eyes toward Harry and, with a huff, pulled off his own scarf.
“It’s a Muggle word.” Ginny spoke. Honestly, Gryffindors really were the pits when it came to social niceties and discreet lurking. One would think that they-
“I don’t... this wasn’t what I envisaged,” said Draco, his eyes drifting across Harry’s face. “Um...” He lifted his left hand and pressed against Harry’s left shoulder. “I’m not pushing you away,” he insisted, apparently seeing something uneasy on Harry’s face. “Just, let me... There.” When Draco finished they were both lying on their right sides, with Harry’s back pressed up against Draco’s chest. Draco’s arm was heavy around Harry’s waist and his nose was in Harry’s hair.
“Magical creatures must drink at least 1.5 gallons of water to stay hydrated,” said the woman. Without looking away from Harry, she clicked her fingers and a long ribbon of water began pouring into one of the mugs. “If you intend to have sex then you will need another half gallon to avoid symptoms like halitosis, dry mouth, empty testicles, flat feet, premature ageing, and eventual death.”
“Indeed.” Draco inspected the jar for cracks. “I haven’t had this much trouble with a Summoning charm since our Academy graduation party. Speaking of which.” He placed the jar on the table and nodded to the second chair. “Breakfast.”
“There is no need,” drawled a familiar voice. Harry spun around, making the two hands fly off his shoulder and almost getting a second bout of whiplash. “And if you ever call me that again, McLaggen, I’ll send you some lube with ground chilli inside.”
“Hi,” Harry replied, sounding a bit breathless to his own ears. Malfoy’s smile twitched before he turned back to the crowd. There weren’t many people watching, but most of them had stopped after they’d seen Harry climb on stage.
“It’s cold. There aren’t any heating charms.” Draco’s voice was muffled as he pulled the hoodie off, revealing a wrinkled grey shirt underneath. “Here.” he thrust the hoodie at Harry.
“Oi!” A sweaty, sweary Tonks appeared to erupt out of the pavement between them. “Oi! Sodding-” she held up a hand, sucking in great gasps of breath. “Just... alright gimme a moment.”
“Just so. This transformation must presumably be permanent, otherwise the prophecy would be too easily broken.”
“Wicked!” Cormac breathed as Harry recoiled. “Show me?” The two of them disappeared into the crowd, leaving Harry with a half-chewed croissant and a terrible foreboding about what Ron’s birthday celebrations would entail.
“You too,” she grinned, snapping her goggles into place. “Alright chaps,” she stepped down into the swamp and began wading over the the first obstacle, an 8-foot climbing wall. “See you on the other side.”
“Well, no...even the most wiley seductress would struggle to get that team away from Rolanda,” said Poppy, laughing again at whatever Minerva’s face was doing now. It felt as if it was going bright red, but that could’ve been from the fire. “Why don’t you just try smiling at her a bit more? Maybe accept one of her invitations to the pub.”
“Look.” Draco swallowed down a rush of rage, tried to choose his words carefully. “I have a date with a man called Liam. The waitress informs me that this table has been reserved under the name Liam. I am therefore waiting for my date, Liam, and I would greatly appreciate it if you could-”
Despite dragonhide gloves reinforced with localised Protegos, it was dangerous work, and Severus really should not have been thinking about biscuits. Especially as he was fairly sure Griselda was using the HobNobs as bait for a cunning trap. The question of why Griselda appeared to be fixated on exposing Severus’ sweet-tooth to the rest of the Restoration Team was still to be puzzled out.
Nothing had been said, but ever since Harry came back from his six month tenure on the Isle of Sark there had been
Malfoy stopped talking to the audience and turned to Harry. “Since I’ve been employed by SlickEasy’s Lube.”
“Doesn’t matter; you can’t just be the Captain on the pitch,” said Angelina, keeping a protective arm around Astoria. There were now so many people standing between the bed that all Harry could see was a line of arses. In the name of not being a pervert, he turned to look at Draco, who appeared to be completely uninterested in the entire conversation and was using a charm to touch-up his nail varnish.
The next morning, his head aching from lack of sleep and his eyes rubbed raw, Draco pulled Theo aside.
Harry scowled. There shall be no jam in the vicinity of his body ever. Not on the inside, not on the outside. “I’d rather have a fist in my body than jam on my tits.”
“No, it wasn’t a bloody suggestion!” Harry glared, crossing his arms, not caring that the slicked dildo in his hand grazed against his clothes.
“I know you know my name, Dwaco,” Alicia sang, twirling around to face Harry and a bright pink Draco. “I’m asexual.” She shrugged and turned back to the twins’ bed where the rest of the Gryffindor team, minus Oliver and Harry, had reassembled. “So are we playing again with the consent charm or not?”
“Neither would Pansy. Do you think that we Slytherins go around constantly manipulating and deceiving each other?”
“I think so too.” Hermione pushed the book completely onto Harry’s lap. The book grazed some rather cital equipment and Harry looked up to see Draco wince in sympathy. “The question is whether restricting the forms we can take would limit the potency of the transformation.”
“Indeed.” Dimly, Minerva realised that they were already talking about bottoms, and that it was probably the ideal scenario for some flirting, but her mind seemed to be moving rather slowly. She watched as Rolanda fiddled with the end of the broom. “Do you... have you given much thought as to how you’ll create camaraderie within the new team?”
“Hmm?” this meant that Potter had used the Prefects Bathroom before Draco. Even though Draco actually
“I know you’re taking the piss.” Mafalda grinned back at him. “But in about three seconds, one of these idiots is going to think that’s a good idea and then-”
“What?” The queasiness Harry had been fighting off ever since Draco sat down came roaring back. “Just, you know, our dates. The dating…thing.”
“What a delightful image. Time to be unconscious now.” Gentle hands tucked the duvet around Harry and Hermione’s voice faded away.
It was, without doubt, the most revolting display Draco had ever witnessed and he would probably be scarred for life. The announcement of which did nothing to stop his parents flirting and so Draco excused himself.
Draco didn’t really think his father was wrong, exactly. He just wished Lucius could find a way to cosy up to the Minister without making empty promises that were likely to alienate Fudge in the future. After all, Draco had his own political ambitions. He was still a little fuzzy on what exactly these ambitions
But he did it anyway, a small voice whispered to Draco as he took hold of the rope and tried to work out how to pull himself up the wall without losing a shoe. By the time he reached the top, Ginny was gone, leaving a trail of muddy footprints in the direction of the showers. Angelina and Ernie had disappeared. Only Harry was still there, waiting by the floating platforms.
“Your turn Draco,” said Mafalda, making rather a performance of spelling away the last of the green smoke as she winked at Harry.
“Yes, I heard you,” he said. “Hermione and Pansy tricked us both into a date with someone called Liam so that we could forge a bond over our inability to choose decent friends.”
“Course not; where would we be if you haven’t taught us to use the vending machines?” She grinned and gave him a nudge. “The consent charm was invented because some witches and wizards were feeling pressured to get off with people they didn’t like, that’s all. A few ofthem told Helga Hufflepuff and she developed the spell so that we could all watch out for each other. Make sure that no one was being pressured to do something they don’t want.”
“And another thing,” Draco said, picking up his complaint from before, “as Seekers, you and I will be flying far more than any of the other players. Getting used to a new team requires a great deal more training than flying with tried-and-tested teammates. We’ll be worn out before the tournament even starts.”
“You didn’t answer, Haz.” Cormac reminded him, his grip on Harry’s shoulder for once gentle and his eyes warm. “Is Draz more than recreational cardio?”
At this, the girl smirked and pointed at an exceptionally battered stone phallus. “One thousand three hundred and twenty-two B.C. Tutankhamun.” Her smirk grew wider. “Went through the whole dynasty.”
“You know what? Fuck—” Ginny lost her grip on the zip wire handles and landed face-first in the mud.
Even Cormac, who had been chattering without a pause ever since they entered, gaped in silence. Then he took a tentative step forward. Foreboding raced through Harry as he realised that Cormac’s expression reminded him of how he, Harry, had felt when he first walked into The Great Hall at Hogwarts.
!” Harry really, really, really wanted to punch something. He was considering Cormac because, if anyone, he deserved it most for being a twat, but Harry would probably break his fist on his abs or something equally pathetic. “And you didn’t think to tell me?”
“Alright that’s enough,” Harry pushed himself to his knees and pointed his wand at the watching otters. “Expectrum Patronum!” A stag erupted from the end of his wand, sending the otters scurrying off the bed. “Tell Hermione to calm the fuck down,” Harry said to the stag. He waited for it to gallop off before collapsing back onto the bed, one arm thrown over his eyes.
“Fuck off, Greg,” Millicent snapped. “Mal is doing a great job explaining how not to rape someone, and-”
“Fuck’s sake, come here.” Harry sighs as he reaches out and hauls Draco in by his lapels. “Wasn’t complaining, just working out the ground rules.”
“Idiot.” Draco was properly smiling now, reaching forward to wrap an arm around Harry and pull him along the street. “Come along, Tod.”
It turned out that Snape’s idea of explaining ‘everything’ actually meant explaining nothing, badly. Hours later, squinting through the dark to see if the bedroom ceiling had any interesting cracks, Harry made a list of the things he did know.
“He’s fine,” said Ginny, tension melting from her shoulders as Ron swung around to give them two thumbs up. She wrapped an arm around Albus’ shoulders and firmly turned him away from the crowd. “Let’s go and wait with the other families. Draco? Would the two of you care to join us?”
“I’m not ashamed of him,” said Draco, reaching for Hermione’s wine and downing it in one. “Not all families are the Weasleys.”
“Yes?” Snape was now sending a volley of cleaning spells whizzing around the room. It would be rather offensive, if the room hadn’t been occupied for three weeks by a pair of wizards with only two pairs boxers shorts between them.
The next few days passed in a whirlwind of bad temper and bad sandwiches. After Harry had refused to discuss Malfoy’s mauling (“stop calling it that you make it sound like Buckbeak started rubbing up against you on the bus”), they had spent the rest of the morning arguing about Hagrid’s teaching qualifications while Snape looked out the window and Hermione did a crossword.
It looked like Ron, a zealous proponent of the fair mere hours ago, was starting to realize that he’d signed up for his biggest nightmare. After all, there was nothing Cormac did better than public embarrassment; Cormac McLaggen
wizard. Which was an incredibly bitter pill to swallow as, before walking into the Cereal Monogamist, Draco had rather hoped that he’d already accomplished that transformation.
“Like my arse,” Greg interrupted, speaking for the first time since the team had Portkey’d into the Travelodge toilets.
“To get us sitting at the same table?” The resignation in Potter’s voice made Draco’s shoulders feel tight.
"What are you doing in here?" Greg had asked, squaring up to Blaise during their first night in the Slytherin boys dorms. "You were in with the girls last year."
“Yes, ah,” Fred stepped over to where Harry and Angelina were sitting on the bed. “Ah, just, er, budge up Draco, you beast.” He grinned at Draco, squeezing in between him and Harry. “Look, it’s, ah, it’s a good charm for making sure that people like me and this arsehole—” he nodded to George who was back from the vending machines, “—it makes sure that arseholes like us don’t get carried away and insist that everyone snogs everyone else. You know, because it’s kind of hilarious.” He grinned at Harry, who felt himself grinning back. Maybe it would be okay. Maybe he wasn’t a rapist. Maybe Draco
“Alright mate, calm down yeah,” Ron wrapped a hand around Harry’s elbow and tugged him back down into his chair. “Maybe we all need to take a moment.”
“No one cares.” Ginny singsonged, showing a bit of the fighting spirit that had disappeared with Blaise’s arrival.
“My father’s houseguest is on his way. He asked that I secure the weapon, immediately.” Draco could only assume that whatever reason Granger had for luring Umbridge into the Forbidden Forest was better than her woeful playacting.
“Ginny Weasley and Blaise Zabini.” Blaise spoke. “I have a permission slip from Madam Pomfrey to visit the Infirmary at all times-”
“You alright?” Harry murmured, nudging Draco’s arm as they stood in line for the Ministry-approved portkeys. It was getting late and Ginny had volunteered to take Al and Scorpius back to Harry’s flat. The crowd had mostly dispersed and orange street lights glinted off the shards of glass surrounding the Cereal Monogamist.
“Flatterer. Just, give me some credit, yeah? I’m not that much of an-” The rest of Harry’s sentence flew out of his head as Draco leaned forward and pressed their lips together.
“More like wistful thinking.” Pansy finishes towelling off her hair and starts flinging anti-wrinkle spells at her tights. “She’ll never forgive me for ousting her favourite daughter-in-law.”
“-but insisting on the creation of a completely new team is nonsense,” Draco continued. It was nothing that Harry hadn’t thought himself; still, a small thrill went through him as he watched Draco’s gestures get looser and his face more flushed.
“Alright,” Potter reached across and took a large spoonful, chewed it for a few seconds and then gazed at Draco in complete horror. “This is rank.”
“Yeah, ahem— I mean, yes.” Malfoy was shaking his head, a small smile pushing curves into his sharp cheeks. “Very well. Let us go over what we know so far. We need to achieve a transformation.” he waited for Harry’s confirmation.
In a previous life the restaurant had been a computer repairs shop and it still had the old sign above the door.
“Hmm?” Draco misses Pansy’s answering huff, his thoughts once again noting the contrast between soft red wool, smooth skin, and the slightly raised lines of a new tattoo. “Oh do leave off.” He bats Pansy’s hands away as she moves to help him with his coat. Too late, he notices Pansy’s dark lipstick almost disappear as her mouth thins.
“Are you enjoying this?” Draco gasped, sucking down air as he finally flipped off the last trampoline and landed at Harry’s feet. “Getting an illicit thrill?”
“Right,” said Harry, feeling a bit queasy. “I’m going to just…er…yeah, let you finish up. Have fun with your parents.”
“Hmm.” She continued to inspect him over the top of her glasses. “Perhaps we have done enough for one evening. Let us resume on Wednesday. For now, I believe a cup of tea is in order.” With a flick of her wand, McGonagall conjured up the now familiar
“Of course.” The mermaid smiled some more. “Sorry, let me just do this properly.” She raised her voice and sang;
“A ‘dick hole’ is by definition ‘air,’ you idiot,” Draco continued, his fingers digging into his own thighs. “As air is vital to keeping us all alive, I accept your compliment and wish to return to the topic of those few brain cells that you may need to start vigorously rubbing together in order to-”
“It’s to stop anyone kissing someone they don’t want to.” Millicent spoke up, twisting around on the horrible sofa to face Harry. “I thought Muggles had this game too?”
“Er, maybe another time,” said Harry, making a mental note not to venture over to that side of the hall.
Fudge was still talking about the campaign he wanted to run, something about a series of recruitment pamphlets for next year’s Hogwarts graduates, with continued mentions of Lucius’ “generosity”. It was no surprised to Draco that his father appeared to have dropped hints at a large party donation. A relatively new presence at the Wizengamot, Fudge was too green and greedy to understand the discrepancy between Lucius’ words and the Malfoy vaults. A gentle tap on his knee from Narcissa drew Draco’s attention back to the game.
A Hogwarts team had never won the tournament, mainly because whenever a Gryffindor or Slytherin team qualified (which was 100% of the time), the other team would dedicate themselves to sabotage. With the Gryffindors that meant an endless series of exploding Quaffles, carnivorous Bludgers, dissolvable uniforms and amorous brooms. The Slytherins, meanwhile, favoured the kind of psychological warfare that usually led to broken hearts and angry owls.
“Afraid so.” Harry scrubbed his hands back and forth across his face. Fuck. From the ten seconds he’d seen of Draco he was looking just as pointy as ever. Pointy in that smug, posh boy way that set Harry’s teeth on edge. Although, his teeth seemed to be slacking recently as they were no longer on edge so much as mildly clenched. Other bits of him were proving to be dangerously alert but—
The owner of the sharp voice was a very pale man, only a few years older than Harry,sitting hunched in a plush, dove grey armchair that matched his eyes. The pale man blinked slowly.
The girl, who couldn’t be more than twenty, inspected her bitten nails. The nail polish on them was mostly chipped off .“Yup,” she replied to Ron. She sounded like she had had to answer this question fifty times that day already.
“Hmm? Yes. Ms Granger asks that you meet her and one of the Weasleys at the Giggling Gryffindor for brunch.” Snape managed to make bunch sound like simultaneously the most depraved and tedious act he had ever heard of.
Harry had been pressured into attending this...this - he hesitated calling it an event - he even hesitated calling it a fair, even though the word was in the official title. Fair of Artful Pleasure, or F.A.P., as the sign above the entrance hall declared proudly. The sign, the acronym notwithstanding, wouldn’t have been quite as traumatising if Harry hadn’t noticed there were penises and vaginas painted inside the letters.
“What? How is that fair?” Oliver protested, glancing fearfully at Katie and Alicia who had darted over to stand next to Angelina, arms folded. “Cassius is the one who suggested we do the Muggle version.”
“Nicely done.” Blaise smiled. “See you back at the dungeons.” He turned to reach out a hand to Ginny.
“It’s a terrible pub on a British highstreet with a lot of drunk pixies hanging around outside. Now.” Draco took a step closer and braced himself for an immediate interruption. When none came, he exhaled and smiled down at Harry in a way that he hoped made him look charming and not nervous enough to do some vomiting of his own. “May I invite you to my home for dinner and a decent bottle of wine?”
“Scared, Potter?” Malfoy asked, his eyes locked on Harry’s. It felt as if Malfoy was asking for a lot more than Harry’s public embarrassment. As if he was dredging up their past to see whether it should stay buried forever or if future could be built on it.
“I am definitely going to be taking the piss out of you for that later,” said Harry. “But that bloke seems a bit interested in us and maybe we should, um, leave.” He nodded his head towards a short wizard standing a few feet behind them. The short wizard waved and lifted a gigantic camera—disconcerting reminiscent of the Malfoy canons—onto his shoulder.
“Indeed, come along, Granger.” Draco turned towards the door, trying not to smile when Umbridge immediately cleared her throat;
“Does it matter?” Draco asked, leaning in close to Harry and pressing a small kiss to his shoulder. It was a bit odd and incredibly nice. “After tonight they’ll have more than enough motivation to move out.” He kissed Harry’s shoulder again, grinning as Harry grinned back at him.
“Draco’s right.” This time Hermione spoke. “Even if we do wait out the prophecy this year there will still be two more years of being hunted by the kidnappers.”
“Sorry Professor,” Angelina piped up, rubbing her forehead. “We were...” She stared helplessly around at the rest of the team.
“You’re laying it on a bit thick old girl,” said Blaise. “At this rate you’ll have flooded the castle before we reach the Infirmary.”
“Breaking up? Who is breaking up?” Draco’s posture was now so rigid he looked he was about to snap in two.
Unfortunately, Harry decided to come over and look at the Tough Mudders recruitment leaflet as well. Something he was apparently incapable of doing without first pressing his entire left flank against Draco. Harry’s disregard for Draco’s personal space was an ongoing problem, mainly because Draco liked it so much.
“I said nothing of the sort,” Draco sniffed. Noticing a gleam in Harry’s eye, he hurried to tack “Potter” onto the end of his sentence.
“I know who the Malfoy Martyrs are.” Harry’s mouth was dry, the room appeared to have shrunk by a few feet. “They’re that group of Death Eater apologists who think your dad should have been the Dark Lord.”
“I tell you I was framed,” Malfoy insisted as he and Harry did the washing and Hermione and Snape read in the living room. Despite “the transformative power of forgiveness,” they had all agreed to leave personal growth on the back-burner and focus on ways to speed up the Animagus charm. Harry knew that he was happier with any arrangement that passed the research onto someone else, but he was a bit surprised that Malfoy had agreed to do the dishes.
“I beg your pardon?” Draco’s mouth went dry. “Houseguest? My parents, ah, my parents are not entertaining at the moment. Professor.” She couldn’t
“What, um... what is this “thing” that you’re referring to?” Draco asked, his voice came out much lower than usual.
“Did she tell you that she was setting you up on a date with a man called Liam?” Draco sounded like his father, he hated when that happened.
“You are wanted,” said Hermione, reaching past Harry to grab the biscuits. She was going for the posh ones, he noted.
“Yes, very well.” Professor McGonagall drew herself up to her full height, looking incredibly composed for a woman who had just shown everyone her tonsils. “Back to your rooms; I do not want to hear so much as a peep from any of you for the rest of the night.”
“Spare us.” Snape appeared behind Draco. “Ms Granger, have you made any progress on the Animagus Potion?”
“You,” he breathed, shifting so that they were sitting very close together, their knees touching. “You moved the bottle.”
They sat in silence as the waitress moved to the next table, Potter having already tasted and given up on his bright, pointy cereal.
“It seems my trust exercises have paid dividends, Mr Potter; the prophecy...” Snape paused, smiling like the murderer a tiny part of Harry still suspected he was, “Has been terminated.”
“Nothing,” she glanced around at the surging pre-match crowds. “So,” hazel eyes darted back to pin Draco in place. “Have you seen him?”
“Oh.” Hermione seemed to be biting the inside of her cheek, a small smile tugging at the corner of her mouth. “He didn’t tell me he was going to do that.”
A thousand apologies for the diabolical length between posting chapters. I've spent the last 18 months opening and closing this doc, then today, much like using chocolate milkshake in your cereal, I was inspired.
“Yep, go ahead. What should we do?” Really, it was like Snape hadn’t just offered to help, the way he was blinking. It wasn’t exactly like they had many other options, unless lobbing the prophecy off the balcony had been considered. Probably not the best idea, Harry decided, what with not knowing how many other versions of the prophecy existed. He vaguely recalled Snape saying something about how most of the prophecies in the Hall had been duplicates. “Come on then.” he sighed. “Let’s have it.”
“-and I can defend myself. If needs be.” Draco said, primly picking a piece of invisible lint off his right cuff. The movement distracted Harry long enough that the sound of the recording starting up again caught him by surprise.
“Are you honestly telling me that everytime the Dark— Voldemort made an attempt on your life the three of you trooped off to the library and rehashed all the old lore?” Malfoy’s face seemed to be stuck between disbelief and a kind of gleeful horror.
“Did I hear someone mention bottoms?” The woman who had spoken was wearing black and yellow striped dungarees and a sign around her neck that said ‘Arse Readings: Your Fate Lies Between Your Cheeks.’ Harry felt his life flash before his eyes as he read and reread the words.
“No-” Whatever Harry was going to say next disappeared as Draco let out a muffled shout of frustration and took one last step towards him.
“Fucks sake, alright. It’s like now I know you as Draco, you know? But back then you were Malfoy, so it’s like that happened to Malfoy, yeah?”
“Harry, mate,” said Fred, darting off the bed. “How about we go for a walk? Hmm? Quick chat outside?”
“Here you go.” The waitress was back, carrying their new cocktails and two matching green bowls. It was the first time that they’d been given bowls the same size. The contents of the bowls were the same — glass for Potter, mush for Draco — but at least they now had the same amount of inedible food.
“Please, yes. Whatever, ah, Harry is having.” The waitress disappeared and Draco squared his shoulders, only to have to immediately curl them back in as he shuffled through the tightly packed restaurant.
“Oh fuck off,” said Harry. “My head was hurting from the memory charm and...” he trailed off as a silvery, translucent otter bounded through the door, swam around their heads, and settled at the foot of the bed.
Draco opens his mouth to reply, only to become distracted by the soft press of Harry’s lips against his own.
“Yes!” The arse reader beamed at him. Why was everyone at this fair so bloody happy? Was this what regular sex did to people? Got them so hyped up that they just went around smiling and offering to look at people’s arseholes?
“I… Alright.” She huffed, grabbing his sleeve and pulling him away from the crowd, behind a Pugnacious Popcorn cart. Draco allowed himself to be towed, fighting to control the whiskers he suddenly felt itching at the end of his nose. “Listen,” she gave his sleeve a shake. “Blaise asked if I could ask George and Fred [Double-Weasel, Draco reminded himself] if they could develop a charm to change a person’s voice. He said it was for a prank he wants to pull on Snape.”
“Sorry.” Harry shuffled back, resting his head against the wall. The wallpaper was textured and he rolled his head from side-to-side, feeling the ridges rub against the back of his skull.
“Well, children.” He spun around, smoothing his hair once more. “This has been delightful but I’m afraid I must join the Minister in the Minister’s private box and-”
“For the love of magic it was a mistake.” Ginny pushed her own glasses up her nose, rubbing her eyes and looking every inch of done. “Al, we’ll talk about this later. Scorpius, your dad is fine but maybe he’d like to sit down? Draco, there’s a tent for us lot to sit while they finish up the raid.”
The game resumed. Cassius’ spin landed on Millicent, which resulted in a red mist. Millicent decided that Cassius would have to kiss the fossilised chip that Astoria had found down the back of the sofa. Then Millicent’s spin landed on Cassius, who took soggy revenge by demanding that she kiss the chip too, but only after he had left it to soak in the bathroom sink for a few minutes.
“Right, um. What’s this thumb thing?” Harry breaks the spell. “Is this one of your Slytherin seduction skills or am I supposed to suck it or summit?” Face hot, Draco pulls his thumb away, steps back.
“Bloody hell.” Tonks spun Draco around by his captive shoulder and used her spare hand to grab Harry’s sleeve. “Time to get out of here before we end up on the frontpage of
He couldn’t stop replaying the way Draco had sighed when Harry kissed him. A small, bitten off whimper that Harry had hardly noticed at the time, but was now running through his head on a loop. The slick feel of Draco’s tongue against his, the way his long nose had gently pressed against Harry’s cheek. With a shudder, Harry realised that he was at half mast.
“I didn’t want to hurt him then; I didn’t know what the spell did. I really didn’t,” Harry turned to Draco. “You know that, right?”
“Harry.” The question mark stayed in place. “Er, Harry Potter.” With a shiver the question mark became two exclamation marks and the door swung open to reveal a dark hallway. The carpet was soft underfoot—Harry’s trainers sank into it as he followed Mr Snape into the flat. All the doors were closed, the only light coming from Mr Snape’s Lumos.
“Right,” he said, pulling on his own goggles and gazing mournfully down at the swamp. “I’ll just. Go. Then.” It was only mud, Draco reminded himself as he stepped down into the swamp. Mud. Soft, harmless, mu—”Why is it so cold?” He demanded. The swamp seemed to be charmed to always come up to the inhabitants armpits, no matter how tall they were. Raising his voice, Draco asked the question again.
“Hmm?” Looking up, Draco was distracted by the thick dark hair falling over Harry’s glasses. “Yes I suppose.” He heard himself say, the words feeling thick on his tongue as Harry smiled.
“We all know you’re squeamish.” She talked over the top of him. “But this is a serious infringement of school rules
“Be my guest.” Draco pushed his own bowl across the table, hiding a smile when Potter’s face twisted into a now familiar expression of horror.
announce that you can identify a murder suspect in the middle of an interogation and then prance off into the sunset.”
Two weeks later and Draco’s head was a lot clearer, unlike his schedule which was packed with training sessions for The Ministry of Magic’s Magical Mudders. This was the first time they’d been able to practise with the mud, something Angelina assured them was a vital component.
“But...” They were almost nose-to-nose, Draco’s eyes were a lovely grey blur, and Harry really just wanted to get to the snogging.
“What’s not worth it?” Cormac’s head poked over Harry’s shoulder. “Shower sex, eh? Personal fave but not sure it’s quite right for you, Haz.” He gave Harry a conciliatory bicep squeeze.
“May I kiss you?” He asked. “Or offer you a gag. Whichever will help you stop talking and make up your mind faster.”
“You are welcome.” They munched in silence, Draco was careful to cup his hand under the biscuit. Nodding with approval, McGonagall Vanished the crumbs in his cupped hand and leant forward. “I’m sorry I don’t have any tea to offer you. Now,-” she held up a hand to forestall his assurance that tea was utterly horrid and a biscuit was much better. “Unregistered Animagi are illegal and as a Hogwarts Professor I am duty bound to report all incidents involving said Animagi to the Ministry of Magic. Luckily I did not see any unauthorised transformations this evening, otherwise the rest of the week would have been spent buried in paperwork and the potential expulsion of one of my most gifted students.” She eyed Draco in a beady way. Draco eyed her back.
“Thank you for endorsing my hard-won non-bigoted status.” Draco interrupted, pushing as much ice as possible into his voice. “As you appear to already be aware of my motivations without the need to actually check any of your assumptions with me and I must confess myself to be at a loss as to why you suddenly feel the need to do so now.”
Rolanda with her gravelly voice and her twinkling eyes. Rolanda who called Minerva “Minnie,” who always left the broomshed unlocked on the anniversary of Minerva’s husband’s death, and who remembered to bring Glenfiddich Whisky Shortbread back from Aberdeen. Rolanda who still resisted Minerva’s many offers to help coach the younger students in their Quaffle underarm passing technique.
“Finally,” a sharp voice rang out, the owner blocked from Harry’s view by Mr Snape’s billowing cape. “Did you bring him?”
“Well, well, w-” She didn’t get as far as the third “well” before Ginny knocked her out with a Bat Bogey Hex. Draco had just enough time to appreciate Ginny’s aim before he was taken out as well, along with the rest of the Inquisitorial Squad.
“Why don’t you clear out the spare bedroom then?” asked Hermione. They were sitting in the living room, balancing a book the size and weight of a generous tombstone across their legs. Harry was fairly sure that his primary function was to act as unreliable, slightly sweaty furniture, but it was nice to spend time with Hermione, just the two of them.
When Draco had raised the subject with his father, in as tentative and roundabout manner as he was capable of, Lucius had frostily pointed out that;
“Fuck you, Potter. You’ll pay for this.” Draco stormed away up the street, raising his middle finger when Harry called after him. It took two blocks for Harry to catch up, dodging past late-night shoppers and cursing Draco all the way.
“Is that what you want? Friendship? Or is this decision to quit the Mudders a sign that my friendship is no longer desirable?”
“Do you mind retracting your gigantic head?” Draco’s voice was mild and much closer than Harry had expected. He was peering around Harry’s shoulder, trying to see where the bottle had landed. The cuff of his right sleeve kept brushing against Harry’s wrist.
“Careful, dear,” Molly murmurs to Ron, Vanishing the small flecks of snow his enthusiastic stamping has sprayed on the hallway walls.
“If you want,” Draco shrugged. It was a bit weird with the shirt stretched over his knees like that.
Snape had made the connection between Hermione and Malfoy’s kidnappings while working to restore the Hall of Prophecies. Judging by the smug way Snape kept smiling, Harry got the impression that he was supposed to be impressed. Unfortunately, all Harry got from Snape’s rambling meditations was that they’d all been rather lucky.
A gasp from Draco prompted Harry to open eyes he hadn’t even realised he’d closed. The pot was moving, sliding smoothly along the wall as the two of them watched. The sound of the pot falling off the wall and smashing against the paving stones seemed to energise Draco, and he swung around to face Harry, delight spreading across his face.
“Don’t lie to me.” Draco was standing very close, the wind whipping his fine white hair into Harry’s face. Thinking that he should probably step back, or push Draco away, Harry moved forward.
“Mrs Weasley,” Draco scoffs on autopilot, his frozen fingers fumbling with the buttons of his coat. “You are going to have to call her ‘Molly’ one day.”
“Yes! Eventually…” Draco’s eyes did a bit of a shifty thing but his hands remained firmly clasped around Harry’s. Harry valiantly tried to remind himself that, apparently, Draco held hands with everyone. It just didn’t really work when Draco was softly rubbing his thumbs over the backs of Harry’s hands.
Harry found a packet of Rich Tea biscuits in the Auror snack cupboard and munched his way through them—taste buds cooing happily at the opportunity to wrap around something wasn’t cereal or alcohol—while Draco and Tonks argued. It only took Draco an hour to agree that he and Harry should probably be in the same room when they reviewed the 50+ hours of their date. Of course that still left the matter of whether they should review the tapes in the Auror rooms or at Malfoy Manor (“not a chance, mate,” Tonks was quick to interject). And what about the room allocated for the viewing? Tonks might
Draco’s white hair absorbed every scrap of moonlight, creating a faintly glowing halo. He was wearing black skinny jeans and the undershirt of his Quidditch uniform.
“Have you had your two gallons today?” The other woman behind the stall had turned her attention to Harry. She was quite tall with big eyes that pinned Harry in place.
It took a while for Harry’s eyes to adjust to the dark, to notice that someone was sitting on the bench.
A shout from George alerted Harry to the fact that the game was ready to resume. This time he made sure to spin the bottle gently, his stomach clenching as he watched it twirl across the carpet. The plastic bottle spun for a lot longer than the glass bottle had, and Harry swallowed against the unease that was starting to bubble up inside him.
It took a few minutes for the charm to settle, leaving Harry ample time for some brooding. Cassius and Katie were deep in conversation, their hands not quite touching on the purple duvet. George and Alicia were laughing as they sent enchanted Quavers zooming around the overhead light. All the couples were wrapped up in each other, Greg was in the loo, Astoria was reading the room service menu, and Harry was…
“Have a biscuit, Malfoy.” McGonagall waved her wand and a tin of shortbread came zooming out from behind the sofa cushions. “Odd place to keep them” some part of Draco’s mind registered, as he automatically reached for a biscuit.
“Draco!” Molly bustles out of the pantry, a steaming dish of apple crumble floating behind her. “Be a love and check on Harry? He’s in the-”
“Watch it.” Harry quickly unwound himself from Draco, heading over to the climbing wall and scrambling up without giving Draco another glance. “I’m coming for you, Johnson!”
“Doing something? What, like getting chucked out of a restaurant most people wouldn’t pay to sit in?” Ron’s question sent Draco spluttering.
“No consideration for his own safety or how it would feel for Copper watching Tod…w-watching him…” Draco abruptly stopped talking and glared at the sky.
“Wait,” he told Malfoy and stepped up to him darting a harried glance at the crowd. Merlin. There were even more people in the audience than before. Harry grit his teeth and hissed. “If you think I’m licking this thing off a fucking dildo, you’re out of your mind.”
“N-no.” Granger really was laying it on thick, twisting her hands in her robes and screwing up her face as if she’d eaten one too many Ice Mice. “He said it was to be kept at Hogwarts and the DA, er, Dumbledore’s Army, were supposed to distract you.”
Silently giving thanks that he was the only one working at this early hour — Griselda wasn’t the only team member feeling the need to prove herself — Severus gingerly levitated the prophecy and walked it towards the staff room.
Across the room, the twins were snoring as one in that creepy, twinish way that they were bound to deny when awake. Oliver was grumbling in his sleep; Harry caught some mention of “Marky,” which was enough to propel him out of bed. Groping around on the floor, he found a pair of tracky bottoms and one of his own hoodies. His trainers took a bit longer to find, and he acquired numerous snubbed toes before finally making it out of the room.
“Tapes?” Someone bumped into Draco, highlighting that he had stopped walking, and that he should probably start again. “Er. Tapes? You said something about tapes?”
The corner of Potter’s mouth twitched. “Lies and lying promises?” he asked. “Wow, you’re really upset about this. Aren’t you?”
“Alright.” Draco still looked a bit terrified, but he smiled as Harry gestured towards the door. “Alright, Potter. Let’s go.”
“Yeah.” Harry nodded along, wistfully thinking how much easier all their lives would be if he could just transform Malfoy into a ferret and have it done.
“Right.” Draco nodded a few times. “Of course. She’s right, of course. Transformation.” he cleared his throat, visibly gathering up his composure and smoothing it over the anxious lines covering his forehead. “We should focus our efforts on no longer being recognisable as the subjects of the prophecy.”
Smiling fondly at her old friend, Minerva nudged the plate of crumpets across the table. They had been having variations of this conversation ever since they became Second Year Potions Partners and it was time to move on. Or at least, to turn their minds to speculating on how long Malfoy and Potter would have insisted on holding hands if the match had not been declared a joint win.
“Alright lads?” said Chrissy. “And lasses, of course. Welcome to the Sheffield Travelodge. Piss about and you’re out on your arses, play nice and I’ll tell you which vending machine gives out pound coins every time you buy a Twix.” She smiled at the groups of nonplussed teens, all of whom looked at Harry.
Another snap of her fingers, and the mug floated over to Harry. The picture on the front was of a tall, thin, blonde wizard who was—much to Harry’s consternation—already topless and leering.
“It’s to match your heart,” whispered Millicent. Taking an audible breath, she nudged Draco aside and lowered herself into the swamp next to him.
But they haven’t hooked up in months. They haven’t hooked up since it got weird, and Harry spent every day trying to not fucking think of Malfoy’s stupid pointy face and his stupid splotchy chest, and his stupid hot palms and his stupid, stupid kisses.
“Right, yeah, you’re right,” said Harry, rubbing a hand over his face and up through his hair. “Couple of dates is hardly a relationship. Yeah. So anyway moving on,” he addressed himself to Ron, “do you reckon the Canons are going to play Pennyfogger on Saturday or stick with Shariq?”
“Exactly. You didn’t know him, and you didn’t know me.” Draco sat up against the headboard, his hip pressing briefly against Harry.
“Huh? Oh! Well they’ll stick with Shariq if they know what’s good for them,” said Ron, already pushing pint glasses aside to make a Quidditch pitch on the table. “Thing is—”
Trust Cormac to offend him over his sexual practices. Harry wasn’t vanilla, was he? He was in half a mind to head back to the Everything's a Dildo stand and buy that 12-foot monster cock out of pure spite. Maybe he could make a lamp out of it?
“Ah.” Potter nodded. “Well I know what that’s like,” he cheerfully slapped his own beer belly and smiled across at Draco. “Hopefully Scorpius is having an easier time of it now that he’s at Hogwarts? Al hasn’t mentioned any name calling.”
“Yes, yes of course. I am sorry, Harry. I can’t help feeling a bit responsible; we did encourage you—”
“Yeah.” Harry blinked. The screen had gone grey, the spellwork slowly unravelling. “Guess I didn’t realise what a shit time you were having. Still can’t believe you tried to climb out of the roof. Don’t think I’ve ever been on a date bad enough to make me do that.”
“Listen to me.” Draco fought to keep his voice under control and the fur from sprouting behind his ears. “I don’t know what or who,” he eyed Ginny, “you are involved with, and I want no part of it. Do you understand me? I am not “trying” anything and whatever you are “trying” to do with this blood traitor may well get you killed.”
“Why you were given a firefighter and I was given an underwear model? Presumably a misguided attempt on the part of Granger and Pansy to predict the kind of man we would find most appealing.” A small sour feeling was starting to uncurl in Draco’s chest. It shouldn’t be surprising that Potter, the ultimate Gryffindor, would prefer a man of action.
“Er…” Harry found himself alone with the Bumble-bum reader. “Do you actually look at the arses then or…
“Are you going to expel me?” Draco asked, swallowing down hot tears and glaring at his hands. “There was a dragon, honestly! It’s Potter and Weasley who should be here, not me and-”
“They don’t need to know, the act of forgiveness and relinquishment of anger is a transformative act,” said Malfoy, he sounded like Hermione.
“That’s alright,” said Draco, smiling at Harry and Accioing the Marmite. The jar bounced off two of the cupboards before finally pin-balling into Draco’s hand.
from the bra he had been inspecting. A mermaid was standing – no, floating – beside him in what looked like a giant martini glass on wheels and wearing a… wearing a…
“You were having your memory wiped every three minutes.” Draco sat back in his chair, stretching his arms above his head. “I think you can be forgiven for behaving like a normal human being, rather than a sugar-crazed maniac.”
“Actually, you’re both the reason you’re standing around in mud.” Angelina was the last member of the team to enter the swamp, Draco absently noted that Ginny had nearly finished, and Millicent wasn’t far behind her. “Because, you know, you’re not bloody moving.” She reached out a muddy hand, as if to ruffle Harry’s hair.
“I was calling you a lot of things back in the cafe.” Draco was still staring at the screen. “And I will call you them again if you don’t help me complete this odious task.”
“Hmm.” Potter hummed, playing with his glass. “I suppose. Personally I’d be keener on the underwear model.”
“Goodbye, Mr Potter.” Snape’s mask was back in place, although his cleaning charms seemed to fizz and sing a little louder.
Much to Draco’s unease, Potter laughed. “Well,” he picked up his drink and held it up to Draco in a toast, “if he’s scared off by a man sitting in a chair he’s clearly not up to handling you. Seems like you’ll be better off without him.”
“It’s actually an ancient Anglo practice.” The arse reader was explaining to Ron. “The Anglos believed that a man’s fortune could be foretold through detailed examination of his anus. Of course, now we know that a lot of that was sublimated homoerotic desires and confusion over the translation of some awkwardly rendered runes.”
“Potter. I... I’m sorry but... are you... are you trying to reminisce about the time I spent attempting to murder our headmaster?”
“Yes, yes.” Stepping further into the room, Mr Snape waved Harry forward. The room was surprisingly big; large windows stretched up to ceilings that must, surely, have an extension charm on them. Someone had charmed the view to match the view from Primrose Park at sunset—Harry recognised it from long walks with Hermione.
“I’m not.” Draco spoke too quickly, readying himself to replicate Harry’s jump onto the platform. “I’m waiting for it to get out of my way so I can jump. Why—” he landed heavily. “Why are you quitting the team?”
“Thanks,” Harry told the girl awkwardly and set out after his friends. She waved after them, laughing.
“As opposed to when you were playing the part of Dumbledore’s sacrificial goat?” Draco’s mind was still half on whether he should call the Healer back and it took him a moment to realise and regret what he’d said. “Er... I mean to say...”
“Sure.” The woman offered the plate to him. “Come visit me at my stand later. I’m here to promote my bakery.”
“M’fine, thanks.” Harry tried to return the smile, judging by Draco's confused head tilt, he hadn't done a very good job.
“I am not dating him.” Draco yelled. Causing the whole pub to go silent and Harry to slowly raise him head.
“There you go.” Ron helped Draco sit on the ambulance steps, crouching down to take Draco’s pulse. “Hmm, bit high. Nothing to worry about though.”
.” She marched them back the way they’d come, through the atrium and back up the lifts. Somewhere between the Auror desks and the interrogation rooms, Draco and Harry got seperated. One moment Harry was wagging those ridiculous eyebrows at Draco and the next he’d been whisked into a different room by another Auror.
The obvious pure-blood candidate was Draco. Draco who, as the owner of the wand that killed Voldemort, could be expected to have a fairly robust magical core. As for the agent of Voldemort’s death, who else could it be but Potter? The size of the prophecy indicated that it had been cast fairly recently, probably within weeks of the Battle of Hogwarts.
Sensing a pause in Potter’s story, Draco scrambled to retrace the last few sentences. Something about Scorpius and Al both starting Hogwarts.
“No.” Draco responded quickly, reaching across to tap Potter’s knuckles. “I don’t want to stop I just...”
“What dating thing?” Draco threw a bewildered glance at Hermione. “Did you hit your head during the raid today? I told Robards to—”
“Hmm, you in distress love?” The faux frenchie switched to a Bristol accent. It was distracting and Harry almost forgot that he
Draco’s role as the new Slytherin Seeker had been earned well before the brooms appeared, but he continued to feel a sliver on unease whenever he looked at his new, unGlamoured, Nimbus. He avoided Blaise, feigning a headache when they were partnered in Potions and closing the curtains around his bed earlier than usual. It wasn’t that Draco felt guilty, he’d acted in the true spirit of Slytherin, afterall. Still, he never did get around to asking his mother for permission to holiday with the Zabinis. After a few weeks, Blaised asked Theo instead and Draco spent the summer miserably listening to his father rant about how the Potter boy had “stolen” their last reliable house elf.
“Oh, Potter.” Draco’s voice was dripping with venom; Harry hadn’t even realised that could happen outside of Ron’s vampire romance novels. “Do try to keep up. Mafalda and Millicent are in a relationship. You know what one of those is? It’s-”
“Should have kicked off mate,” said Harry, shifting out of the way as Ernie stepped into the swamp and began making his way over to the climbing wall.
“Well, with Weasley involved in your escapades I can see why that became a habit,” said Malfoy. “However, as neither of us is a complete imbecile would it be possible to skip the First Year Charms class?”
“It wasn’t really kidnapping,” Hermione had protested. “We just knew you wouldn’t have gone with Severus if you remembered who he was, and we needed to make sure that you didn’t go running off to the Aurors.”
“Not unless he is sitting in the Minister’s private box.” Draco mentally congratulated himself on slipping that into the conversation so early. The Weaselette was bound to run straight back to Potter with the news that the Malfoys had secured the best seats in the stadium and-
“Because you were hoping that the thing I desire the most is you.” Draco doesn’t even try to stop the smile spreading across his face. Hope fizzes in his chest, spills out along his arms, through his body to the roots of his hair and the bottom of his feet.
“Hmm, very proper.” She had wrapped his arm around her shoulders and led him back along the dark hallway into a cold bedroom. “You’re sharing with Draco,” he heard her say as she slipped off his trainers.
It had taken twelve meals of nothing but sandwiches for Draco to claim he had an allergy to Hellmann's salad cream and insist that Snape teach him how to use the microwave. The two of them were in the kitchen, wrapping the microwave in magic-repelling charms, while Hermione and Harry looked for a way to speed up the Animagus charm.
Although he very much doubted that a nice chat and a selfie — perish the thought — would be enough to escape the time loop, Draco nodded. “Very well. Tell me, how are your children?”
His mind flashed to a drunken night, a few weeks ago. He and Malfoy had attended the same Ministry Ball and, after bumping into each other on the balcony and complaining about the terrible food choices, they set out to drink as much as they possibly could in order to forget how hungry they were. Well past tipsy, Harry brushed against Malfoy whispering “my place” into his ear before heading to the fireplaces. It was the only night that they spent together without having sex. Instead, deciding they were still ravenous despite all the booze in their bodies, they set out to make a sloppy, crumbly, overly-sweet treacle tart.
“Or vagina,” The girl reminded him before continuing. “And, yes, believe it or not, a lot of the time, they do so with great enthusiasm.” For the first time the girl’s face broke into an amused smile. She seemed to be enjoying the abject horror on Harry and Ron’s faces.
“Dad?!?” Scorpius’ grey eyes swam with fresh tears. Goodness. Draco hadn’t seen his son this emotional since the Magical Menagerie ran out of Flailtail Snail Kale; forcing Leopold to dine on dandelion leaves like a common garden snail. Speaking of which.
“Hmm? Of course. What is it like to die?” Draco winced even as he was asking the question. “Sorry, that is not, ah. Sorry. Please, do not answer.”
“Yeah, nice one mate.” Ron grinned, tugging Hermione a little closer to him and wrapping an arm around her shoulders.
“And you think that if I...” Minerva trailed off, her eyes drawn back to the cheerfully crackling fire.
you don’t talk to me?” Potter pressed forward again, elbows back on the table. “I know you’re not a blood-bigot any more but-”
They sat in silence, taking occasional sips of their drinks. The buzz of the alcohol was starting to take the edge off the cold, although every exhale still sent a cloud of steam into the room.
“From what I hear it’s more like facts, not rumours.” Ginny glared up at him, refusing to give an inch.
“Of course.” Draco nodded. It was flattering to be confided in, maybe Umbridge wished to ask for his opinion of the best way to imprison Potter and Granger while-
“No, that’s not what I…Harry…” Draco was staring at Harry, his face twisted in distress. “I didn’t realise that you thought we were. You know.”
Malfoy merely shrugged and lowered his voice. “Talented taste buds and a penchant for sucking cock.” He winked.
“You can’t keep us here.” Ginny, moved forward to stand beside Blaise. “And you’re not going to torture us.”
Two hours later Harry jerked completely, horribly, awake. The bedroom was still cold, thin curtains bathing the room in an orange glow. Malfoy was lying next to him, breathing shallowly, his fingers twitching against the pillow. Letting out a small whimper, he arched his back slightly and rolled his head to the side as a stripe of orange illuminated his long throat.
“Indeed. Just as well that there is an entire table between the two of you.” Draco finally notices that Pansy is sitting between Hermione and George, as far as she could  possibly be from Percy. Taking a moment to absorb the rest of the seating arrangements, Draco realises that someone is missing. “Where’s Harry?” he asks, turning to find that Ginny is busy apologising to Percy.
“Not at all. Caring about the way one looks and presents oneself to the world does not automatically equate to vanity, at least in my opinion.” Draco ran his fingers through his hair, making sure it was still on the artful side of tousled. “I suppose I spent a lot of my childhood fixating on being seen to do the right things, be the right way. Judging people like the Weasleys on their clothes, rather than their actions. For example.” Draco had already had this conversation with Ron but how much of it had been related back to Potter was unclear. Probably not a lot, judging by Potter’s startled expression. “When I first met you, in Madam Malkin’s, I dismissed you as a scruffy little nobody. Later, when things were rather difficult, I found myself wondering how things might have been different. If we might not have been friends, or at least avoided becoming enemies. Had I been able to see past your and Ron’s shabby clothes and family names.”
“Draco.” Blaise placed a firm hand on Draco’s back, reclaiming his attention. “The Weasleys are my friends, that is why I was meeting Ginny. They are not… they do not have any alliances that might, might impede your family’s wishes and…”
“Right that’s enough of that.” Ron’s voice was level as he grabbed Draco’s hand. “Let’s get this nasty graze cleaned up, shall we?” He began dabbing at a long red mark on Draco’s wrist, tightening his grip when Draco squirmed. “Every time you tried to leave the restaurant it flipped the time trap. We still hadn’t worked out if the suspect was carrying and there you were, climbing out the windows and pissing off the waitress. Zach Smith was campaigning for us to drop a sedative in your cereal.”
“But why the fuck did you become a fucking lube taster?” Harry thought that he might be swearing a bit too much, but who the fuck cared, this was the weirdest fucking day of his life, Blast-Ended Skrewts lesson included.
“That’s it? That’s the grand plan?” said Harry. “We sit around here holding hands.” He watched as Malfoy tucked his own hands primly beneath the duvet. “And making friendship bracelets in the hope that it will stop the kidnappers from rooting around in our magical cores?” It was the worst plan he’d ever heard and, judging from Malfoy’s pained glance at the ceiling, Harry wasn’t the only one who thought it was crap. “Will that even be enough of a transformation? And how will they know we’ve changed?”
“I’m saying that Hogwarts is fortified with charms to help the young students control their accidental magic and the longer you stay here the less common any accidents will be.” She nodded and Draco realised he had been dismissed.
“No can do, Ang,” said Oliver, grinning at Marcus in a most uncaptainly, uninspiring way. “You lot can sort this out yourselves. Although...” He straightened up and glared at the rest of them. “Marcus and I are out if there’s any forced kissing.”
“It’s seriously fine,” said Potter, moving the tapped hand away from Draco and signalling for the waitress. “Don’t worry about it, I-”
“Honestly.” Draco looped the scarf around Harry’s neck, frowning as he tucked the ends into the front of Harry’s hoodie. It was probably making Harry look like he had one giant breast in the middle of his chest but, rather than complain, he snuggled into the scarf. The action caused Draco to roll his eyes, a small smile pulling at his thin lips.
“Professor Snape and Headmaster Dumbledore are dealing with Potter. We are going to talk about you.” McGonagall interrupted him.
“Put that down,” Harry hissed. He was already regretting giving the mug to Ron. Still, better than Cormac. “That is not Malfoy, it just looks like him. And secondly-” Harry snapped his mouth closed, realising he’d been about to point out that Malfoy probably wouldn’t mind getting naked for him, seeing how eager he’d been to take his clothes off at Harry’s- No. Delete. Erase. Annul. No thinking about that.
“A time trap.” Draco breathed, mentally reshuffling his entire evening. “It wasn’t... so it wasn’t waiting for me to, ah...” He trailed off. All of Narcissa’s training—as comprehensive as it was—had ill-prepared Draco to ask the question; “you mean to say that I am not the centre of the universe?” without at least a twinge of embarrassment.
Malfoy composed himself quickly, all hesitance gone as a small cunning smile curled across his lips. “Perfect,” he almost purred, then turned to the crowd. “We have our volunteer! Potter,” he said, “care to join me on the stage?”
“Oh stuff it, Potter. Once we have forgiven each other our magical cores will no longer be recognisable, the first step in the ritual will no longer be possible, and the prophecy will melt away.”
“Er, yep. Yes.” Harry nodded, trying to tear his eyes away from her hair. It was currently white and reminded him a bit of… “How do they, er, work? Also… what are they?”
“Shhh.” Draco hushed him, apparently only just tuning into the couples’ frantic whispers. “They’re talking about us. The ferret and the phoenix. Oi.” He snapped his fingers in front of Ron’s nose. Harry tried not to smile at the sound of his own West Country ‘oi’ coming out of Draco’s prissy mouth. “What are you talking about? Why are we in an oven?”
With a shudder, Draco’s attention wandered back to where the Aurors were still standing in formation. “Shouldn’t they be doing something?” He asked, swallowing against the thought of Harry. Alone. Waiting for Draco to come back. Possibly sharing a bowl of Shreddies with a mass murderer.
“S’nothing,” Harry grunted as he and Draco slumped back onto the bed, still glaring at each other. “Is it my go to decide what Alicia needs to kiss?”
“Smooth move,” said Harry, watching with interest as Draco’s hands tightened around the notebook. The movement made his knuckles so white that Harry could almost believe the bone was sticking through. Suddenly squeamish, he looked down at his own knuckles; dark brown and relaxed against the pale denim of his jeans. Hermione had told Harry to wear these jeans, brushing off his complaints about how tight they were and insisting that “Liam” would like them. How Hermione knew what jeans Draco liked was a rabbit hole that Harry had no intention of clambering down.
“You’re a right twat, you know that?” Ginny snarled, wrenching open the door and staring expectantly at Blaise. Suddenly exhausted, Draco made no attempt to detain her.
“Right, um, well actually I-” Draco stops, takes a deep breath. “I’m smiling because I am happy, I think.”
“Harry.” Draco bent forward, his breath hot against Harry’s cheek. “I’m going to kiss you and I think you will find it a lot easier to kiss me back or— or— or punch me, or whatever you wish to do, if you are no longer babbling.”
“Oh. Is he?” Draco doubtfully scanned the five tables squished against the far wall. Three of them already contained couples, while the other two had people who were decidedly not Liam the Underwear Model. One of them was a tall, skinny woman with a prominent chin who was wearing turquoise headphones and the other person was... “Fuck,” said Draco. “That’s not Liam”.
Knowing that everyone knew he’d wanted to kiss Draco made Harry seriously consider flying his broom into the nearest wall. His shoulders were tense and it felt like his face was on fire as he imagined them all looking at him, knowing that he was hoping it would land on Draco again.
“Just a bit,” answered Hermione. “It turns out that we can speed up the process of transforming if we brew a potion with concentrated mandrake as a base, rather than that nonsense with the leaves. The problem is that the concentrated version limits the number of forms we can take.”
The restaurant was already full, diners packed so tightly together than many of them were sitting back-to-back. Tori Amos had been replaced by Neutral Milk Hotel and the barman was indistinguishable from the customers: buried in his own phone, apparently disinclined to make smalltalk. Or serve drinks. Hovering awkwardly, Draco pretended to be absorbed in the extensive cereal menu painted on the wall above the bar. £8 for a bowl of rice crispies seemed like a lot but Draco had always found Muggle currency a little confusing. Maybe the dish involved a few special ingredients? Possibly shavings of truffle or-
“What?” Ginny’s mobile face morphed from teasing to apprehensive. It didn’t make Draco feel as good as he might have expected. “Don’t… You wouldn’t do that.”
A few of the diners glanced up as Draco wrestled the monkey back into place before switching their attention back to slurping pastel coloured cereal out of picnic bowls and showing each other things on their phones. Draco tried not to take this lack of interest to heart, it wasn’t as if he wanted the squishy-faced twenty somethings of Hackney observing him all evening. He repeated this to himself as he shuffled around the artfully rusted IKEA garden furniture that Cereal Monogamist favoured.
“Chrissy doesn’t scare me,” said George, dramatically dropping the volume of his voice and winking at Harry. “C’mon Draco, what have you got for us?”
“You know where everything is?” Molly’s smile slips as she asks the question, although this may be due to the loud crashes coming from the kitchen.
“Stop right there.” Harry held up a hand. Malfoy’s mouth snapped shut. “The way this works is that we talk about the problem until something clicks. That includes asking stupid questions.”
“Potter,” Draco leant forward. “You have a horror story like that, and yet you accepted an invitation to a restaurant that serves only cereal? My man, how desperate are you?” Potter's surprised laughter attracted a glare from the tall woman at the table next to them.
“Ah,” said Draco, slowly raising both hands in a placating gesture. “Now I do understand how that might have—”
Malfoy took a deep breath, before barging on. “The treacle tart flavour...I-” His eyes shifted away from Harry’s face to a dildo shaped indent on the floor. “I made it because of you. For you. I meant to- Well, I meant to bring it to you. For weeks now. But I just...couldn’t. I was scared.”
While Harry pondered the qualities of Malfoy’s smiles, the man had stepped up to the table, taken a bottle of lube in his hands, and let the liquid dribble over the head of a fake cock. As if slapped, Harry jerked out of his thoughts. Oh, no
“Kink and let kink. It’s not that deep.” The girl shrugged. She had obviously become completely desensitized to the abnormality of her profession.
“Right.” Harry lapsed into silence. He carried on staring at Draco, watching the way his long fingers gripped the edges of the Ministry-issue notebook. They were supposed to be recording the timestamp of any moments of the date that they didn’t want shown in open court. As long as no crime was actually being committed during those time stamps, the judges would view them in a private Pensieve, prior to making their final judgement. Harry knew this because Tonks had already explained it to Draco. At length. He also knew this because that had been his first job as a Junior Auror, shifting through time trap footage to make sure the Aurors hadn’t missed anything. It had been mind-numbingly dull and Harry still wasn’t convinced that Kingsley hadn’t assigned him that shift specifically to put him off Auroring for life.
“Yes, thank you, Malfoy.” Ginny spoke through gritted teeth, contorting her body as she tried to inch along the wire.
“I think you’ll find it’s called ‘a cinema’, Hermione.” Draco interrupted. “And I will thank you to stop glaring at my—at Harry in that manner. He didn’t have many opportunities to watch Muggle cinemas growing up. You know.”
“Aren’t you Liam?” The waitress frowned. “The table’s reserved for Liam, I’ll have to make you a new reservation if you’re not him.” She was already reaching for her iPad and
While an afternoon of pointless trust exercises may have dented Hermione’s ego and head, they did not impede her love of learning. Specifically, learning how to be a better person than Draco and Harry.
“Thank you, Professor,” he said, standing quickly and attempting to push the chair back into place. It remained bolted to the floor and he gave up, nervously smoothing his hair as he edged towards the door. “I do, um, I, thank you. This is, thanks. Are you, um,” he felt himself compelled to ask the question, even while his brain screamed to get out and back to bed immediately. “Are you saying that there may have been other students who, um, who...”
“Tell us about the cinema,” said Hermione. She and Ron were being very accommodating, something Harry decided to worry about later. For now he wanted to check that he hadn’t imagined his entire relationship with Draco.
“Er.” As conversation openers went it wasn’t Harry’s worst. “Look, they’re probably short on space, alright Draco?” A quick squeeze of Draco’s shoulder stopped him mid-rant. Interesting. Filing this observation away for later, Harry continued: “Let’s just watch the tapes, sign the papers, and then go meet Gin and the boys. I even promise to fast-forward all the bits when your face does that weird pointy thing.”
“What?” Harry’s head snapped up so fast at this that he was fairly sure he felt something tear. “When did that happen?”
As neither Potter nor Malfoy were willing to relinquish the Snitch that they had snatched from the air at the exact same moment, the game was declared a joint victory and the Gryffindor and Slytherin teams tied for the Hogwarts Quidditch Cup. Which meant that both houses had qualified for the European Under 17s Quidditch Tournament, and team Slytherdor was born.
“To the ends of the Earth,” Lucius gleefully wrote back. “When the Dark Lord’s day arrives there won’t be a single bolt or loophole for those animals to wiggle through.”
“Alright. Firstly it’s not creepy, it’s sexy.” Ron informed him, leaning over to count off on his fingers. “Secondly, we’re not talking about you—”
"Dumbledore is already aware of Slytherin's generous benefactor." Snape interrupted Flitwick. Above their heads, the staircase began to swing down to where the Professors waited.
Harry was rather doubtful that Mafalda - a woman wearing a top that said ‘gone fisting’ across the chest - had ever been particularly susceptible to peer pressure. Still, he nodded his head.
“You missed that one,” he said pointedly, mainly because if he had to do this, he would be as mardy about it as possible.
Harry had never thought of himself as a particularly sensitive person. He’d survived eight years of the Gryffindor common room, seven years of Neville’s feet, and months in a tent with Hermione’s snoring. If ever there was a man trained to block out external stimuli it was Harry James Potter. But the mugs were A Lot. There were red mugs, yellow mugs, blue mugs, purple mugs, green, black, white, brown, orange, grey, puce, puke, poppy, pumpkin, spotted, striped, glitter and sequin mugs of every shape and size. All this, and on the front of every mug was a hunky witch or wizard, waving at Harry and occasionally rubbing their nipples.
“It could be with you.” Draco interrupted. “If you want. You haven’t eaten either and you, well... you should.” He trailed off, looking both terrified and hopeful.
“Mmhmm.” Draco nodded, pretending to reread the rights waiver they’d been given to sign and very carefully not thinking about the smell of Harry’s cologne. “And yourself?”
“Thank fuck,” Ginny cheerfully agreed, stepping up to the doorway and gazing down at the swamp. “Surprised there’s not more of you lot down here to be honest. If I worked here I’d be diving in face first, never to emerge.”
“You’ve never licked jam off my chest,” Harry reminded him, hoping that Malfoy hadn’t confused him with some other bloke he was fucking.
“Harry,” Draco paused. “Must kiss. Marcus’.” Oliver sat up straight. “Teddy bear.” The room erupted into cheers and dramatic gasps.
“I still don’t understand the need for a combined team,” said Draco. “Why not just select the best players?”
“From what I hear that’s more your department,” said Ginny. “Or are you only interested in borrowing brooms?” Her words soured Draco’s mood and he stepped close to her.
“I know,” said Draco, casting around for a distraction. “Do you,” he licked his lips, unsure if the question he'd been dying to ask since the waitress interrupted them would salvage or sink the conversation even further, “do you find yourself constantly angry on your children’s behalf?”
“Malfoy. Alright?” Potter’s startled jump had caused his glasses to slip down his nose and he nudged them back into place with a stubby finger.
“Gin-nerv-ah Weasel.” Draco spelt out slowly, making a show of filling in the first line on the slip.
Harry found Hermione in the kitchen, once the memory charm had mostly evaporated. Stumbling out of the sitting room (“don’t follow me”), he had opened a door, thinking it would lead him out of the flat. Instead he found himself in a kitchen, watching a familiar figure struggle to open a packet of cheese slices.
“Alright lads?” Tonk’s hair was standing on end and there were dark circles under her eyes. “Haz I know you already know this but Draco, mate, did you know that because I’m the first Auror to have contact with you when you left the crime scene, I can’t go home until you do?”
The only drawback to bounding around the castle in ferret-mode was that the moving staircases didn't register his presence, leaving Draco to lurk behind tapestries and under armories until one of the patrolling Professors triggered the stairs. The stairs from the Dungeons to the Great Hall were fine, but the swinging staircase from the entranceway was stuck on the third corridor for so long that Draco was seriously considering turning back into a human for a few minutes.
“Oi, Hazza! S’on you, mate!” Harry looked up to see that George was right and the bottle was pointing at him.
“Um, yeah. Cheers.” Harry accepted the chapter. It was printed on nice, expensive feeling paper and was titled:
“But you just found the prophecy in a random box,” Harry persisted, ignoring Hermione’s attempts to hush him.
“Right” Malfoy said for the third time in an effort to collect himself. “That was, indeed strawberry jam as Potter correctly guessed. Now, onto the next one.”
“Alright Draco!” George rubbed his hands together. “What’ll it be? The Slytherin badge? The moldy shower curtain?”
“If you can’t sleep you can start working out how we’re going to break the prophecy,” said the second otter. Also in Hermione’s voice.
“Oh,” Snape was back to the blinking. “Well. Thank you for accepting my counsel. It was... tolerable.”
“Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t realise that sitting in the Minister’s box meant you had to surrender your eyeballs.” The Weaselette smiled sweetly. “Well if you do ever regain your sight please point Blaise in my direction.”
“What, er—” Harry cleared his throat. “What do you mean?” He’d been so sure that they were done. The remaining Death Eaters were dead or incarcerated, fallen friends buried, former enemies forgiven. Well, some of them, he corrected himself, glancing back to the dark hallway where Snape and Malfoy were probably lurking.
“Not really.” Draco reached forward to play with the stem of his near-empty cocktail glass. “I have nothing against underwear models, I just... I, ah, I find myself uncomfortable around people who are required to place a great deal of value on their physical appearance.”
Shouts from the other bed alerted them to the fact that Alicia’s spin had landed on Draco. The mist was back to red again and Angelina and Fred were arguing over whether Alicia should have to kiss Fred’s trainer or Angelina’s pumice stone.
The snowball fight is winding down, and everyone is thoroughly soaked by the time Molly calls them in for lunch. All eight try to cram through the backdoor at once, grabbing towels and casting drying spells as they scuff the snow off their shoes.
“Misguided”? You’re saying you wouldn’t prefer an underwear model?” the expression of discomfort on Potter’s face suggested that his mouthful of spikey cereal was especially pointy.
“This entire conversation. I’m going to fix it and come back with an answer that doesn’t make your face do that.”
This was when Harry stopped smiling and switched to taking deep swallows of his cold tea. The Cedric Diggory conversation didn’t usually crop up until his fourth date with someone. And it had been a date, whatever Draco might have to say about it. Raising Albus had taught Harry a fair bit about how quickly Slytherins could lash out when their pride was hurt. By this point in the never-ending date Draco had had his fair share of humiliating experiences.
He turned seeming to only now remember that they had an audience the entire time. Harry’s eyes swept the crowd. The mermaid was whispering to the water witch, the dildo witches were simply standing there with their eyebrows raised, there was no sign of the arse reader, but the mug witch was pointedly avoiding Harry’s gaze. Ron looked queasy, and Cormac, for once, didn’t seem to know what to say.
No, what was really bothering her, Minera realised as she untangled a pair of amorous Slytherins en route to dinner, was that she hadn’t done any flirting.
“Oi.” Harry and Ron spoke together while Hermione narrowed her eyes and Accioed’ the empty wine glass.
"That... you're not making any sense." Greg cast a desperate glance towards Draco, clearly at a loss.
“No,” Potter hedged, taking another swallow of his drink and grimacing as a Cheerio bobbed against his nose. “No, I know that Slytherins... are... nice... I’m just saying that you’re wrong, Hermione is a good friend.”
“He does,” Ron shrugged. “Now that he’s trying to lean out we do it every morning, for 20 minutes, fasted. I’m getting pretty burnt out, to be honest.”
The right thing to do would be to wake him up with swift kick to the shin. After a few moments Harry rolled over to stare at the wall, leaving Malfoy to whatever nightmare had him in it’s grip.
People didn’t hear what he and Malfoy were saying, did they? They had kept their conversation to whispers. There was no way the audience had heard. It was probably the act of seeing their Saviour lick a dildo that had the crowd stupefied and Ron queasy. Harry would feel queasy himself if he saw Ron licking lube in public. Or in private.
“Professor Umbridge?” He returned to the classroom. There was a fresh cut on Potter’s cheek and some of the Inquisitorial Squad members looked upset.
“But there must be something better than this. What if we went and found the kidnappers? We could trick them into thinking we want to take part in the ritual and then—-”
“Yeah, suppose so.” Harry laughed along with her. This was nice, he thought to himself, maybe he could just stay here for the rest of the fair. She looked like the kind of woman who might have a flask of tea tucked away somewhere and-
Not that it was Harry and Draco’s bed. It was Harry’s bed, or—if pushed—Harry and Oliver’s bed. Although he was fairly sure that Oliver was planning to sneak into the Slytherin boys’ room later on, which meant that Draco would probably be evicted from the bed he was sharing with Marcus and then Draco would probably need to share with Harry and-
been up to on the 23rd must have been rather juicy, he speculated as she grabbed her things and slammed out of the room.
“Unbelievable!” Malfoy smiled his fake smile again. “Potter guesses something again. Who would have thought that after two encounters with death any of his taste buds survived!” The crowd laughed, but Malfoy continued without waiting for the laughter to die down. “That is it for today, thank you for your attention, and remember with SlickEasy’s everything slides easy.”
Headlines about the attempted kidnapping of Hero Hermione Granger had dominated the Ministry atrium for weeks.
In his haste to get as far away from the stage as possible he almost missed Ron and Cormac making their way towards him through the crowd.
Draco then attempted to antagonise the barman into throwing him out of the restaurant, just in case there was some kind of reverse vampire situation in the mix. Unfortunately there are very few insults that a man who mixes cereal-sprinkled cocktails for a living has not heard and become impervious to. In the end Draco was reduced to sitting on top of the bar and singing an off key rendition of Hoggy Hoggy Hogwarts until the waitress cracked and escorted him outside. Which of course didn’t work and now Draco was forced to live with the knowledge that in at least one dimension Potter had witnessed him being told off by a woman wearing shoes made out of milk jugs.
Cormac’s enthusiastic applause prompted Harry and Ron out of the stupor they had fallen into. Nodding graciously, the mermaid gave each of them a large green giftbag (“where was she hiding them?” Ron frantically whispered) and began happily answering Cormac’s questions about her handcuff preferences. Ron looked like he was slowly being boiled alive, the red colour in his cheeks deepening with every passing minute. Cormac, naturally, ended up buying three different pairs of handcuffs
“Seventeen,” Draco spoke. “We did seventeen, my lucky number.” He turned to smile at Harry and Hermione, neither of whom smiled back.
“That’s it then?” He asked, feeling almost light-headed as relief hit. Ok. This was going to hurt but at least he knew.
“Hmm, and that’s all it took?” Cocking his head, Harry let his eyes travel across Draco’s face. He was still smiling, but it wasn’t the sweet, fond thing it had been a moment ago.
“Yeah, it’s Hermione’s. She must have...” Harry forgot what he was going to say next when a second otter wiggled through the door and sat down next to the first otter.
“Only that Rolanda seems rather fond of you and a bit of extra attention from you might, ah, work some magic, as the Muggles say.”
“A date?” asked Draco, scrambling for a distraction. Why on Earth had he asked about death? He had absolutely zero interest in hearing about Potter’s lonely journey into the Forbidden Forest. Well maybe not
The corridor was boring and the lobby was creepy with all those dust sheets, so he wandered outside, shivering as the night air nipped at his throat and fingers. Crossing the strip of pebbles and a few empty flower beds that separated the hotel from the carpark, Harry made his way over to what Chrissy had insisted on calling “The Grotto.” It was only a bench with a bit of straggly vine hanging over it, but it was tucked out of sight of the hotel, just in case the professors were awake.
“Look, you dramatic fucker.” Harry caught up with Draco, spinning around to block his path. “I know I said that I wanted to do the whole dinner and drinks thing again but I was hoping that we could avoid repeating that whole bit where you constantly leave.” He was breathing a bit heavily, his eyes not quite meeting Draco’s.
The cleaners seemed to share Draco’s unease. Sasha had planted himself in one of the six open doorways that overlooked the hall, arms folded and unlit cigarette clamped between his teeth as he glared at the swamp. The other cleaner, the one who simply stared Draco down when he introduced himself, was at least pretending to clean the wall behind Sasha. Although, Draco wasn’t completely convinced that the wallpaper itself should be coming off on the sponge.
Malfoy opened his mouth to say something, then promptly closed it. “Well, it’s a fairly basic taste, isn’t it,” he said, turning to the audience again, completely ignorant to the pang of disappointment in Harry’s stomach.

Harry snorted. The one thing he liked about Cormac was that he made him laugh when he didn’t feel like laughing at all. “Who thinks of sex as recreational cardio?” Harry shook his head, finally looking up.
“Where’s this teddy, then?” Millicent called, scrambling across Mafalda to prod Marcus in the chest. “Come on, whip it out.”
“Oh.” All the air seemed to leave the pub as Harry dazedly watched Draco lean closer, his lips shiny and slightly parted.
“We can talk about it tomorrow.” She said, tapping his glasses to remind him to take them off. “I’m nextdoor. It’s a single bed.” She held up a hand to forestall his protest. “There’s another bedroom down the hallway but it’s full of exercise equipment.”
“It’s the consent charm,” said Draco, smiling softly at Harry. There wasn’t even the hint of a sneer, and Harry was a bit distracted by how... non-prattish Draco looked.
“It is a bit flat,” a voice from above agreed, causing the Hogwarts Headmistress to glance up so quickly that her hat slipped. Before the newly-trimmed hat could hit the ground, Rolanda had darted down, snatching it up and landing in front of Minerva with a sheepish grin. “Sorry about that,” she said. “Thinking about bottoms is serious business. I shouldn’t have startled you.”
. It didn’t ring any bells but, scrabbling through the memories previously obscured by the memory charm, Harry did recall weeks spent comforting Hermione. She’d escaped her own abductors but returned to the house the two of them shared with nightmares as a souvenir.
Veelas, centaurs, vampires, mermaids, werewolves, house-elves, metamorphmagi, registered and unregistered animagi — the people making the laws didn’t seem to care where the human side of these creatures went to school or who their fathers were. Draco had checked, in a roundabout way, loitering in the library near the magical law section and owling his father convoluted questions about how far the new laws extended.
“Great!” Rolanda climbed back onto her broom, “I’ll get Chris to send over the details. Wood! Get that Quaffle out of Flint’s mouth before I demote you from co-Cap to Ball Boy!” She zoomed off towards the pitch in a flurry of robes.
“Now that I’m no longer trying to murder you, you want to spend time with me?” Draco tried to keep the hurt out of his voice.
As a fellow Midlander, Severus might have hoped for some support from the Solihull-born witch: a shared smile when their teammates insisted on pronouncing the “s” in “issue”, a roll of the eyes when the department head started using his “Brummie” accent—small things that would have eased the strain of being “practically a Northerner, darling” in a group of Southern County Seers.
“I do not give a frigging fuck,” said Hermione, hand tightening on her wand. “Talk about the prophecy or not at all, otherwise I’m telling Ron that you called Severus ‘Mr Snape.’” Turning on her heel, she disappeared. Harry gaped at the empty doorway. It had been a while since he’d seen Hermione so worked up.
“Alright.” The waitress smiled at Potter and shot Draco an appraising look before moving away to serve another table as Kelis started making grand claims about the capabilities of her milkshake.
“Pshaw. We should join the others, oh goodness-” Pansy finally takes a proper look at Draco “-you’re soaked!” On cue, a cold icy dribble of melted snow finds its way beneath Draco’s collar. He shivers, remembering how Ron had grasped Harry’s jumper, yanking the collar open to stuff snow down Harry’s back. A move that revealed several inches of Harry’s lower back and… “Draco?” Pansy’s face creases with concern. “Are you alright? You’re not getting ill, are you?”
“Oh-kay...” said George, summoning the bottle of water Greg was still drinking and Vanishing the contents. “Many apols my man Gregory,” he said, winking at the spluttering Slytherin. “Tori, you mind giving me a hand with this?” Nodding happily, Astoria pulled out her wand and began to cast what Harry assumed was the consent charm.
“They’re called Sexual Aura Sensing Stoneware,” she said, smiling again and causing her hair to turn Gryffindor red. “They sense whether the drinker is thirsty-” she gave him a long, slow wink, “-and then the picture on the front reflects that, look!” Snatching up a mug, she took a deep swallow. The wizard on the mug loosened his top button, giving Harry a rather smouldering glance but was apparently disinclined to remove more clothes. “Hmm, looks like I’m not in the mood right now,” she shrugged. “Let’s see if we can find one for you!”
“Yes.” Draco sighs, letting his thumb drift across to press gently against Harry’s bottom lip. “Because I love myself. Or because I, ah-” He clears his throat.
“How did I get here?” Draco struggled to remember the timestamp on Pansy’s last text to him, 19.36. “What time is it?”
“Oh fuck you.” Potter laughed. “Yes the scar, old scarhead over here." He fixed Draco with a meaningful look. Draco ducked his head, still smiling. “But also the weight thing. Turns out people prefer their “saviours” skinny and malnourished.”
“Scorpius doesn’t remember half the children who were mean to him at nursery,” Draco hurried to explain. “I, however, might as well have their names carved on my heart.”
Draco huffed at Harry’s words.“Well really,” he started, building up to a good rant, “having a good team for the Cup
“Hmm.” Draco pretended to consider as he scrambled to collect himself. Sasha and the nameless cleaner were starting to sweep up the swamp. They didn’t look very happy about it. “Why don’t we go any place in the world that isn’t here then maybe a meal? And a shower?” Despite the last few minutes and weeks of heated glances and hesitant touches, Draco found himself half-convinced that Harry would say no.
“Professor I assure you I would never-” Umbridge reached up a hand and slowly pinched her fingers together. Draco’s mouth closed, his mind flooding with images of angry pink scars against brown skin.
?” He made Liam’s name sound like a rude word and Draco puffed up indignantly, only to deflate when he remembered that Liam was nothing more than a figment of Pansy’s diseased imagination.
“Well... you’re always so uptight about that time and I thought maybe if I made a joke out of it then...” Potter trailed off and blinked earnestly at Draco.
“Right, because involving the appropriate authorities is a terrible idea and definitely something I’m likely to do.”
“Eugh” he gagged. “Strawberry jam.” Of course, Malfoy had to give him the flavour he hated the most. Some things simply didn’t change, and Malfoy being a prick was one of them. “You know I hate jam.”
He was sitting back at the table, opposite Potter who was put down his own phone and turned to the waitress. “We need a few more minutes, thanks.”
“Well I don’t know,” Potter ran a hand through his hair. “Did you even hear anything I said about Hermione? Or are you too busy thinking about
Firmly setting aside any questions about how Scorpius would have formed an opinion of Harry after only glimpsing him across a crowded crime scene, Draco owl’d his consent for Scorpius to watch snail sex and then, vibrating with nerves, he penned a second note.
"A donation that size, for only one team as well, I don't know what Dumbledore will have to say about-"
“Oh.” Draco reaches out a hand, catches his fingertips on the edge of Harry’s belt as he asks: “Does it hurt? Can I…” He wants to ask if he can touch it.
“I can assure you, it is not.” Draco didn’t think he’d spoken out of turn, yet Potter’s head snapped up and he glared at Draco.
“Of course it matters.” Draco blinked rapidly and swallowed. His throat clicked. “Granger lied to you and-”
told him he was a Potions Master and Flavour Tester, but Harry had thought he worked for, like, one of those stuffy wine cellars at the posh end of Diagon Alley? Or something? How could he have known Malfoy was a sodding lube taster? True, Harry had never really asked, but who the fuck would have thought such a profession even existed? Why did everything about Malfoy have to be so bloody exotic and different and intense? From his choice of profession to the feelings he incited in Harry, Malfoy had to stand out at everything.
Harry laughed, and reached out to take Malfoy’s hand in his. It was a simple gesture, but somehow clutching the pale hand in his clammy palm, feeling Malfoy’s pulse under his fingers was enough. It was enough because now he had time to love.
“Forgive me.” She returned to her armchair, the urge to pace abandoned. “I was distracted; what were you saying?”
“Malfoy.” Harry sat up enough to fold his arms. Malfoy’s innocent expression melted into wavering uncertainty.
“But are you really alright?” Scorpius had got his tears under control and was now scowling up at Draco. “Like, properly? Because sometimes spell damage takes a while to show up, you know? Like you feel alright in the beginning and then you walk around a bit and then poof, you drop dead!”
By the time Tonks caught up with them, Harry and Draco got all the way past the block of Auror desks, down the lift, through the Ministry of Magic atrium and they were ambling down Horse Guards Avenue as Draco loftily explained to Harry why, eggzactly, tomato-free shakshuka would not cut the mustard.
“Yeah I know my own name, thanks”, Harry grinned, inching closer to Draco and forcing him to come to a halt. Draco opened his mouth to protest, only to close it again as he took note of the completely unacceptable way in which gold threaded through the dark curls that had fallen across Harry’s face. Deciding that future Draco could blame sleep-deprivation, Draco lifted a hand to move one of the longer curls aside. Harry jerked slightly, eyes darting to Draco’s hand and then almost going cross-eyed as he stared up at his own curls. “What are you doing?”
“Er, thanks,” he said, accepting his role as the groups’ official Muggle translator. “Thanks for... you know... er... having us.”
“Sometimes,” she nodded. “You’d be surprised how often people have photos of their own anus to hand. Fancy a cauldron cake?” She produced a gigantic cake from her rucksack. It was golden brown and dotted with glace cherries.
Taking a deep breath and one last scan of the crowd, Draco followed. Long strides quickly caught him up with Ginny and she turned, a grin pulling at her lips.
“You just said his name.” Ginny spoke. She looked very young, wearing a shabby red dressing gown and with her hair down around her face. She didn’t look like the kind of girl who would inspire someone as pragmatic as Blaise to break the rules.
“It’s alright.” Tonks sat down, nodding her head to the other chair. “Sit. Now then,” she rubbed her face, gazed at Draco for a moment. Slowly, her hair flickered back to neon pink and she lowered her wand, leaving the recording charm unfinished. “Right, first question.” She leant forward, a grin spreading across her face. “How long have you fancied Harry?”
“Did he now? Well, he’s not the first man to underestimate me.” Umbridge nodded grimly, for some reason making eye contact with Draco. “Mr Malfoy? A moment, if you please.” She walked over to the window and cast a Privacy Charm. Taking great care not to brush against Potter, Draco followed, hoisting his best sycophantic smile into place. It was a bit like his dashing smile but less confident and with a touch of grease.
“Liam.” Pansy had insisted that the reservation be made under Liam’s name, “they’ll only call you Drake, darling, and you know how cross that makes you.” Draco did not personally believe that he looked like a Liam but the waitress’ iPad seemed to believe him as she beamed and pointed towards the back of restaurant.
“Of course love,” said the waitress, scooping up the rejected Cheertinis. “Just so you know we’ve got a surprise selection menu tonight. You choose a bowl colour and the chef creates a meal specially tailored to match your personality.”
“Yeah I am! Team record!” Angelina was scrambling up onto the last of the floating platforms, high-fiving Ernie as she reached the top. “Come on, Harry. You can snog Draco when you’ve finished the course.”
Draco had expected to feel a sense of triumph when Potter’s Poseurs (as he nicknamed them, much to Pansy’s delight) were apprehended. His role on the Inquisitorial Squad had stopped being fun a while ago, somewhere between casting a barrage of Tickling Charms on squirming second years and Blaise’s look of resignation when Draco called the Weasleys “Mudbloods”. Recently Draco had spent most of the nights after his IS patrols lying awake, listening to Astoria’s dreary Muggle albums and trying not to think about his bedroom back at the Manor.
The final admission was barely more than a whisper. It was loud between them, though, echoing their shared thoughts.
“Not as much pain as I am whenever that oafish husband of hers opens his mouth.” Lucius grinned as Narcissa pretended to wrestle her hand free.
“It, er, it shows the viewer whatever they most desire,” says Harry, ripping the bottom out of Draco’s stomach. “Bit like the Mirror of Erised, you know?” He darts a glance at Draco, then quickly looks away. “Ginny talked me into having it, er, there-” he makes an abortive gesture towards the small of his back. “I thought, um. Thought when you came up here that you might be coming to rip the piss out of me, you know, maybe for having a tattoo of myself or something…”
It wasn’t until the time loop had restarted for the 27th time — following an attempt by Draco to leave the restaurant via the skylight — that Draco resigned himself to his fate. Judging by the fictional adventures of Timmy the Grumpy Troll, it was clear that the time loop Draco was currently trapped in would keep restarting until he had learnt the error of his ways and become a kind, sensitive, enlightened
“Yep, that’s it,” said Harry, ripping open the mini eggs and trying not to breathe too deeply. “They really should pack it in.” He raised his voice. “Otherwise someone might hex them.”
“Pack it in,” said Angelina, coming over to sit next to Harry. “Look, Haz. It’s alright, yeah? The mist was green so you didn’t do anything to Draco that he wasn’t happy for you to do.”
“I feel a bit wobbly to be honest,” said Harry, running a hand through his hair and glancing around at the crowd. “Did they tell you who the suspect was?”
“Oh, I don’t know.” Narcissa’s quiet voice cut through the tension between Malfoy Jnr. and Snr. The three of them were eating breakfast in the third dining room and Narcissa reached for another croissant as she spoke. “Life on the continent sounds rather charming. Or at least, according to Binky Waldorf.” She raised an eyebrow at Lucius, who chuckled and reached forward to take her hand.
“Whose go was it?” he asked, watching the red mist streaming out of the bottle. How could the charm know who Harry did - or in this case, did not - want to kiss before he did?
Volunteer? Harry’s head spun. Oh, no, not in this fucking millenium. He looked around wildly trying to find an escape, but his only option seemed to be a doorway decorated with pink plastic and foam to make it look like a vagina. Everyone who'd gone through the doorway so far had been crying when they came back out and it was too late, anyway. Cormac was advancing, his strong hand curling around Harry’s bicep, and, in no time, Harry was being dragged to the stage with the words, “Tits out and abs tight, Haz. Time to load that bar and just do it..”
“Yes, Potter,” Draco jumped into the conversation, fighting off another shiver at the thought of consuming a cold bowl of mystery cereal, “is there a colour you usually favour? Maybe to exclusion of all others? Hmmm?”
“Draco.” A small fly had become stuck in her lipstick and it waggled it’s legs feebly at Draco. He struggled not to feel a certain amount of kinship. “Do you know what I do with little boys who lie to me?”
“Prefer the live ones, myself.” The gentle voice caused Harry to leap about 10 feet in the air and 10 feet
Harry didn’t know what he and Malfoy were exactly. He just knew that their previously uncomplicated (and often drunk) hook-ups had, somewhere during the rushed gropes, quick wanks, and quiet fucks, grown into something awkward and hesitant, full of lingering stares and not-even-slightly-casual touches.
“Right,” Harry muttered, almost gagging as he dragged himself to his feet and stumbled along the corridor to the kitchen. Draco was sitting at the kitchen table, reading
“No,” Potter cocked his head to the side. “You sat down and started banging on about some bloke called Liam, then the waitress brought some drinks over and Hermione texted me. Are you alright?”
