“Possibly.  Well at least for little me.  Lucius already recognised me as his heir, which should still be valid, even though it won’t officially happen for another 14 years.  It might not be good enough for the Ministry – we’d need identities we can use and documentation for that, but it should be enough for Gringotts.  The Goblins work by different rules.”
“The baker is sick.  It’s why he doesn’t work.”
Draco knew it was no good to try and avoid it, so he talked over each unpleasant episode over the last five months and what triggered them.  Doris knew about his relationship with Potter, although it had been years since he’d come up in their sessions.  Draco had always insisted on keeping Potter’s identity a secret though, and Doris had respected his wishes. Draco told her about the surprise meeting, about the drunken visit, even telling her about his falling into bed with Potter.  He told her about Scorpius’s letter and the fact that his ex was getting a divorce.   He poured the whole sorry mess out to her, allowing the release at getting it all off of his chest to take over.
“I’m flattered. So all I needed to do to get more than three dances at our wedding was invite half the wizarding world so you would dance with me to avoid talking to people.”
“Shhh… It’s okay Moony. I’ve got you.  I’m here.  We should have told you we changed secret keepers at the last minute.  We should never have bloody changed to the rat in the first place.”  Sirius said and wrapped Remus up in his arms.  It wasn’t until that moment that Harry realised exactly what type of relationship the two men had.  Harry hadn’t suspected anything like that back in his time.  But then, he’d been 15 when he’d last seen them together, and maybe they had never gotten back together after Siri had escaped Azkaban.
“Nothing much, just how nice this is.  Just to sit here with you.” His hand was trailing down her arm, and he could feel her hand stroking his side underneath his shirt.
Scorpius pulled back slightly, just enough so that he could see her face.  His expression told her that he’d heard.  That he’d understood. It felt like an eternity as the two of them just stood their eyes locked, yet only moments had passed.  Then he leant in and kissed her nose and just like her Daddy had mere months ago, he picked her up, carrying her in his arms.
“You’ve been there to check?”
“That has nothing to do with it.  Any way I’m ill and you should be treating me better than this.  I shall not tolerate your teasing.”
In an embarrassingly short amount of time he was vanishing the sticky mess in his trousers away.  He felt a little guilty that it had all been about him, but Lily was snuggled contently into his side and didn’t seem to mind.  It was like she knew that he’d needed the physical release to help clear his head from the pounding of guilt and anxiety that had become his constant companions.
“Well there goes our relaxing morning.  We should get dressed and head over to your parents.”
“Hugo, how are things going with you and Lysander?” Lily enquired whilst sinking into the warm water and bubbles.  Her and Hugo had both been so wrapped up in their respective love lives over the term, that they hadn’t had a chance to talk properly like this in ages.  The intermingling of the respective friend groups also hadn’t helped with managing a private conversation, as there always seemed to be someone else around who could overhear.
“But why here, don’t you have friends you could have gone to”
“And.”  Harry admitted.
Blaise maneuvered Harry into the bathroom, which was his safe place to talk with Blaise.  Blaise sat on the floor an pulled Harry into his lap.
“Let me finish this aria.”
“He’s my first cousin once removed.” Draco said, sounding horribly pompous and Harry had to stifle a giggle.  He was glad he did when he saw the expression on Draco’s face and even more so at the next words came out of Draco’s mouth.  “Can I really meet him?”  Draco seemed both awed at the prospect and shocked that he was being allowed to actually meet this tiny human.
“What you thinking?” Lily asked, looking up at him.
“We may have stopped Father getting his claws into little Draco, but what about the mad man who made him do it in the first place.  I know we’ve got another few years before he tries anything, but maybe we could sort that whole thing out before it gets to that point. I mean…”
“Very.”  Harry sensed Draco walk around the counter behind him.  Warm hands snuck under his jumper and around his waist.
“Sirius.  Don’t do this.”
“Yeah they died.  Final battle.  They both rushed off like idiots to fight, with a month-old infant at home, and got themselves killed.  I know everyone says it was the brave and noble thing to do, but to me it seems completely selfish and reckless.”  Teddy was really struggling to hold back tears now and Justin didn’t know what to do.  He just kept his hand resting on Teddy’s.  “But it’s okay, it’s not like I remember them.  Harry doesn’t really remember his parents either.  And Draco’s dad was an awful human being by all accounts, even if his mum is amazing.  And I have Andi and Cissa, and Harry and Dray.  I might not call anyone mum and dad, but I don’t think it really matters.” Teddy sniffed loudly and had to pause to rub the tears out of his eyes before he continued. “Fuck, this took a deep turn.  Confessing all my deepest secrets.  I swear I’m not really like this most of the time.  I promise I’m much more fun.”  It was said in a self-deprecating, half jovial way, as if Teddy was trying to make light of the situation.
“Your children have been back at school for around six weeks if I remember the term times correctly.  You’ve been avoiding me.  Something happened.” It was a statement, not a question.  “Something happened to make you avoid me, and something happened to make you come and find me today.”
“Well, I’m someone who finds people of the same sex attractive.”
“Merlin you are an idiot Draco, how did you get yourself into this mess.  I’ll be here with you till you can get Potter back.  I’m not letting you go, okay.”
“Little Harry?”  Narcissa asked.  Draco had introduced his mother to his Harry whilst they were making their way out of the Manor.  She seemed to accept that he was the sixteen-year-old version of the boy-who-lived pretty well.  Draco supposed if she accepted that he was her son from the future anyone else along for the ride wasn’t too out of the realms of possibility.  What they had forgotten to explain was there kidnapping of the infant boy who lived.
“Swear all you like.”  Andromeda chuckled slightly.  “I certainly feel like it.  If it weren’t for my proper upbringing, I’m fairly certain my language in the Healers office would have had a sailor blushing.”
“Ron, I’m not pregnant.  And if I were do you think I’d be stood here with a very large alcoholic drink.  You can stop.”.
“Teddy Lupin?”  Justin questioned, recognising the man from the fateful day a week ago when he’d got the, still unbelievable, interview with Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy.
“I remember him being drunk, but I wasn’t sure how drunk.  If he really was as out of it as you say, then that’s the problem.”
Scorpius saw his Father pacing the common room when he exited the dorm.  He looked as awful as Scorpius felt.  Pale and thin with dark circles etched deep under his eyes, which were red and puffy, as if, like Scorpius, he’d spent half the night crying.
“We can start with this again next time if that feels right at the time.  For now, we can move on to something a little easier.”
“Harry…don’t do this again.”  That Draco had used his first name told Harry that he was as affected as he was.  Draco rarely called him Harry, and it usually only slipped out when he was feeling overwhelmed by his own emotions.
Harry had slotted each part of his life into compartments.  Compartments that weren’t allowed to interact.  Compartments that didn’t realise that the other parts of Harry’s life even existed.  Only Draco got to see all of him.  Currently, he was trying to deal with his increasing frustration at the work compartment.  He was rapidly growing to hate his Auror training programme.  Most of the other recruits, and even the instructors, treated him like he could do no wrong.  He was
“You’re pretty smart for a Malfoy.”  Sirius snorted quietly.
“Draco, you look worse than you did 10 minutes ago.  What’s happened? Nothing with Scorpius I hope.”
“Probably.”
____________________
Harry jumped up, startling Teddy.  He hadn’t expected Draco to actually make it this far.
“I think pretty much, if you’ve been seeing her anyway near as long as I have.  She’s one hell of a therapist.  And this certainly proves her discretion.  There’s no way she didn’t know, if you’ve been talking about me, that is?”
“I’m sorry.  I don’t know anything about my godfather.”  The youth said curtly, showing obvious displeasure at her enquiry.
“And you couldn’t just hold your tongue.  Just for once.”  Draco replied, handing over the bowl of the healing solution.
“You seem pretty proud too.”
“Moony.  I promise this isn’t a trick.  I have no clue how they got here.  Neither do they.  But it’s really Harry, and… well the two of them saved me from making an incredibly foolish mistake when they met me… If it wasn’t for them…  if what they’ve told me is true, I’d be spending the next 12 years in Azkaban for Wormtail’s crimes.”  Sirius said.
“But if I go inside, they won’t be able to continue their conversation.  You wouldn’t want to make them cross?”
“You sure?”
“No Harry.” Draco said, making Harry want to cry at the use of his first name.  Draco almost never used Harry’s name and Harry knew that he was using it now to say goodbye.    “Look, I wasn’t going to tell you this, but you’ll see the announcement in the papers in a few day’s anyway.  I’m engaged.  Mother arranged it.  In six months we’ll both be married, and this will just be one little mistake that neither of us ever mention.”
Harry didn’t know what else to say.  He didn’t want to make things worse, but he knew that Draco needed to know who had been at the gates.
Harry went back to Draco’s side and led down on the bed next to him.  He slipped his arms around the blond-haired man who was currently trapped inside his own bleak thoughts.
“They will support you in whatever decision you make.”
“Shhh….  Hey, love.  It’s all right.  I didn’t go anywhere.  Your cousin got upset because he woke up somewhere unfamiliar.  That’s all.  I was just in the living room.”  Harry pulled Draco onto his lap, and started stroking his back and hair, just as he’d done with Teddy.
Draco raised his eyebrows then reached to touch Harry’s face and letting his thumb smooth over the frown line that Harry was sure had manifested between his brows.
“Quite possibly.  But you have to get in here.  It’s better the prefect’s bath”
“You’re just scared.”
“A drink would be good.”
Harry didn’t really like it, and he especially didn’t like how cynical Draco’s attitude was, but he had to admit the other man had a point.  If he pretended to be with Ginny, they would all be less likely suspect he was seeing Draco behind all of their backs.  It wasn’t like they weren’t already sneaking around.  That he wasn’t already lying to everyone.  Besides, Ginny had spent months pawing at him when they weren’t together.  What would really change?  He could live with lying.  He’d been doing it increasingly since the war ended.  And this would protect Draco.  Protecting Draco had become the most important thing in his life.
“Right now he doesn’t seem stable.  He’s just lost his best friends.  And then on top of it he gets two accidental time travellers sprung upon him.”
“It won’t be as bad as you think…” Draco started trying to reassure his mother but trailed off before he could finish under a particularly vicious glower.  Harry knew, now the giddy high that they’d both felt after talking to the journalist had worn off, that Draco was petrified.  If it was obvious to him, then it would also be obvious to his mother, and his uncertainty and fear were not helping his case that everything was going to be okay.  He also didn’t think there was anything either of them could say that would truly reassure Narcissa.  Even if both Draco and he were confident about what was going to happen now, which neither of them were, she would be concerned for them, and a Narcissa who was concerned for her family, was a force to be reckoned with.  She looked about three wrong words away from hexing the two of them, either that or sending them to their rooms without any supper.  Harry wasn’t sure which was worse, mother Narcissa treating them like naughty children, or the Narcissa who had survived living in a house with Voldemort for nearly two years, under constant threat of torture and death, who was likely to flay them alive.  Both of them seemed to be standing in front of him and Draco, warring with each other as to which option was best.
“Hey… how are…”  Blaise started, walking into the kitchen, a bag of fish and chips in his hand. “Fuck… Which one of you is a mess this time?”
“You came to see me in the hospital?  I don’t remember.”
“Draco…Potter… are you going to tell me what the hell just happened?”
“That could have gone worse” Harry whispered. “Do you fancy getting a bit more ‘fresh air’?”
“It is comfortable though.”  Harry said turning back towards the hob and the sauce that was just starting to thicken nicely.
“Family emergency.”  Hermione didn’t know how else to describe it.  It wasn’t like she could come out with the truth.  For starters she wasn’t sure how to explain the whole ridiculous situation, and certainly couldn’t do it without breaking the statute of secrecy.  Victoria didn’t seem to notice her reservations though.
They were naked under the thin sheets, the balcony door open letting in the warmth and sunshine, as well as a pleasant breeze.  Draco’s head was resting on Harry’s chest and Harry gently played with the soft blond hair, watching as the sunlight reflecting off the hair, turned the strands gold.  There was nothing Harry loved more than lying in bed with the man he adored.
“And emotionally?”
Blaise watched as the mask dropped, and Andromeda burst into a wide and infectious smile at this announcement.  “Very nice to meet you.  Call me Andi.  Please.  I’ve heard so much about you I feel like I know you already.  You’re the artist, right?”
“So we’ve stopped your dad from ruining yours and your mother’s lives.  What do we do next?”
“Who is he that he gets you this worked up, Draco?  Please tell me.  I don’t like seeing you this upset.”
“Why Occlumency?”  Blaise questioned.
The three of them poured over the book for an hour, before they decided that they had the details of the ward straight.  They’d have to sort the illusion charm another night, as it was already past 1am, and they guessed it would be another pre 6am wake up.
“Yeah, like that.”
“He still is a complete git.”  Harry laughed.  “But he’s mine, so I don’t mind so much anymore.”
“Fuck…  I did it.”  Draco exclaimed, watching his own tiger run around the room.  Harry let his out as well and the two tigers proceeded to chase and pounce on each other playfully.
“Don’t touch me.”  Harry responded, harshly.
Harry thinks that he may have drifted off.  It’s starting to get cooler and the light coming in through the door isn’t quite so bright.
“Come on… enough sentimentality – we’re after books on Horcruxes.”
Harry didn’t know how Blaise managed not to drop him when they came out the other end.  Harry always managed to stumble, even from the shortest of floo journeys.   Despite the extra weight in his arms, Blaise stepped out of the floo as if it were no different than walking through a doorway.  Before Harry could ask to be put down, or even open his eyes look around the room, he could feel Draco tugging at his shirt, trying to get Blaise to put Harry down.
“How long do you think we have to wait?”  Sirius interrupted Harry’s thoughts.
“No.  I’m fine.” Harry lied.  He really couldn’t believe he’d been unconscious for three days.  At least it was three days free of the pain.  He didn’t think it was the aftermath of the dream either.  That wouldn’t explain the tugging sensation and the increased gnawing at his chest, both of which he was fairly certain were related to his Malfoy problem.  He couldn’t think about that though.  Thinking about Malfoy just made things worse.  “Where are the others?”
“Probably.  It’s actually a little better here than last time.  It’s much easier to ignore the ridiculous supposedly uplifting speeches with you next to me, rather than with an engagement ring in my pocket.”
“Dumbledore is going to leave me on that doorstep in 24 hours.”  Harry said morosely.  “He’ll grow up with those monsters, just like me.  He’ll be beaten and starved and locked in a cupboard.  No one is going to love him.  He’ll be the freak servant who doesn’t even know his name till school.  He…”  Harry hated this.  Hated it so much.  Shaking in Malfoy’s arms he admitted every awful thing the Dursleys had ever done to him.  Even being tied to the headstone in the graveyard hadn’t made him feel this helpless.
year.  And Malfoy killed Dumbledore… Harry was devastated after that.”  Ron was starting to sound cross.  Hermione could just feel despondency creeping over her.  Like one of the dementors was in the room sucking out her happy memories.  One that was focused on only her happy memories of Harry.  She tried to be rational.
“I know.  It’s better this way though.  I don’t want to get hurt again.”
The tears had started to fall down her face as she finished and Harry felt unbelievably guilty,
With that he moved all the way into the fire and stumbled out into the living room, bringing with him a fine trail of ash onto the carpet.
“Don’t run.  We’re not going to stop you publishing, we just want to talk to you first.” It was Harry Potter that addressed him this time.
Harry obliged and was quickly on his knees in front of Draco, working kisses up the insides of his thighs as he continued to stroke and tease.  It wasn’t long before the blonde had come completely undone from the ministrations of his tongue and fingers.  He stood up and kissed Draco, his own cock still hard and wanting.
“What the fuck have you done to your hand, Potter?”
“I’ve sent a message to Ron already.  He’ll do everything he can to get Lee here before that baby is born.  But you know better than I do that baby’s set their own timetables on this, and there’s not much you can do once they decide it’s time to make an appearance.  We can’t keep Lily waiting at the hospital either.  She’ll start panicking if we don’t step through that fire soon.”
“We’re both fine.  And we’re mostly ignoring the papers.  We expected them to do this.  Not everyone is as good as that first reporter we met.”
“I can’t believe you really just did that Harry.  Fuck.  Talk about diving off the deep end.  I come round to think about doing this no more than an hour ago and here we are telling our biggest secret to a journalist already.  I love you Harry Potter, but you’re taking the blame with mother.  Fucking Gryffindor.” Draco is laughing slightly hysterically as he says this.  Justin just watches on in amazement, unable to believe what he’s just been told either.  He stays silent and lets the two men get on with their bickering.  They gave him plenty of useful information with their bickering before, he can only hope they’ll do it again.   Harry appears to regain his composure again and does indeed start jovially bickering back.
Then his father had died and he’d stupidly tried to cope by himself.  Tara had told him time and time again that she was there if she needed him.  So had Harry and Blaise.  But he wanted to be strong.  To manage by himself.  And he’d gotten it all wrong and lost himself in the muddle of his own mind.  Somehow it had worked out and resulted in things which he’d all but lost hope for.  He had connected with family.  And he had left the Manor.  He had required a lot of potions to deal with the anxiety the latter had heaped on him, but he had managed it.  That was the important thing according to Tara.  It didn’t matter that he needed crutches, he had still pushed through and done something he’d come to believe was impossible.  The crutches helped, so he accepted them.  And the people who loved him accepted them.  They accepted him as he was.  Unlike his mother.
“We’ve been well.  You’re certainly looking better.”
“Fine. Fine…  Let’s shop in muggle London for the baby things.  I think it would be best to keep this off of people’s radars.  Harry may not have anyone personally close to him but you Sirius, but as far as the public go…”
They wound through the corridors.  Harry had to fight not just turn and run straight back out.  Not that it would have done any good.  He had no idea how to trace back the many turns and connecting rooms they’d been through to get to this point.  Still, the thoughts of the Death Eaters spending more than a year wandering through this place left him with a chill.
“Harry, you seem a little out of it.”
“What is it then?”
“Oh…”
A knocking at the window dragged him out of his self-loathing. Looking up he saw an owl tapping on the glass asking to be let in.  Harry obliged, and the owl dropped a large letter on his lap before flying back out.  The letter had the Hogwarts crest on it and Harry ripped it quickly open, wondering what it could be.  Harry hadn’t really thought much about the future.  He supposed he’d join the Auror corps, knowing they’d let him in despite his lack of NEWTs.  He wasn’t really sure it was what he wanted to do.  Like with Ginny he felt a desire to avoid the expected path.  He’d spent too many years walking along a path someone else had created for him.  Harry wanted to do things his own way for once and the thought of chasing down dark wizards had lost its appeal.  He’d hadn’t even considered going back to school to finish his education, not realising it would be an option.  The letter he now held seemed to be providing just that.  Harry read it several times through, liking the idea of going back to Hogwarts more and more.  The letter stated that there would be a special eighth year for those who had missed out on their last year of education.  Accommodation would be provided for those who wished to stay in the castle.  Those who would prefer, could have their homes connected via the floo network, so they could attend lessons and still live at home.  It was perfect Harry thought.  He didn’t much fancy sharing a dormitory right now, he’d started getting used to his privacy.   This would give him an extra year to figure out what the hell he wanted to do with his life.  He wondered whether all of his year had received a similar letter, he knew Hermione would jump and the chance to go back, and Ron would do it to make her happy, but it was Malfoy his thoughts settled on.  Would he be allowed back.  His education had been just as messed up as the rest of them, and he had been pardoned in the trials thanks to Harry’s own testimony.   Sighing he got up and went upstairs to get showered and dressed.  He knew he had to go talk to Malfoy, and the longer he put it off the harder it would be.  Besides, he still had the git’s wand.  The image of Malfoy sprawled naked on his floor, looking up arrogantly at him flashed through his mind.  No, he shouldn’t think of Malfoy like that.  Ginny was definitely not right about him wanting to spend any time with Malfoy, and certainly not any time with an undressed Malfoy in his bedroom.  Harry had had years of practice at pushing these kinds of thoughts from his mind.  He turned the nob on the shower to cold and the freezing water quickly expelled what he could not think about.
“Time to drop the masks.” Harry said, squeezing Draco’s knee.
“Well, are we going then.”  Yara snapped at the aurors, in complete contrast to the way she spoke to Harry and Draco, the second she was passed the protections around the ancient Manor house.  The aurors looked very confused, and decidedly annoyed, but acquiesced.  When they had all disapparated both Harry and Draco let out a sigh of relief.
“Mate, you probably didn’t notice as much in the past because you were busy working too.  Look, make a plan to take her out somewhere nice, spoil her a little.  Then sit and talk to her about how you’re feeling.  If you’re feeling this way, she’s probably feeling the same.  You just need some time to work through all of the changes that have happened since you stopped working.” Then, almost as an afterthought Ron added, “Hermione is also right about the holiday, we’re going to hot springs in Norway, it’s meant to be really romantic.”
With that Harry got up and left and continued his walk towards Grimmauld place.  Although he knew he couldn’t go in, he wanted to see the place and how the neighbourhood had changed.  He also wanted to avoid his next task for as long as possible. He had to talk to a lawyer and then to Ginny.  He couldn’t wait till Christmas to tell the kids.  It was a bad idea and he knew it, but he still didn’t know whether he was ready to look at the women whom he had spent more than half his life with.  Harry also knew that talking to a lawyer and starting the process of divorce would make everything more real and he didn’t know if he was ready for that.  After maybe an hour strolling round Islington, he turned down an empty looking side street and disapparated home.  Dealing with either task was too much for him today.
When bedtime came, Harry tried again, although he knew it would be in vain, to put the kitten into the bed he’d made in the kitchen.  The kitten mewled so pleadingly that it didn’t take long for Harry to give in and take it to his bed.  It was quite nice falling asleep with the kitten on top of him, stroking its small furry head.
“Shit.  And the blood.”
Draco did as he was told and stayed silent.  The cuffs were discreetly unlocked, but they left them in place.  They held no power like that, and they couldn’t risk anyone seeing.  Draco’s wand was passed over and Harry used the knife he had hidden to quickly carve a rune into his hand to help with the barrier they needed.  One that would push away and keep out anyone not of his or Draco’s blood.  It wouldn’t work on the dementor of course.  Draco saw what Harry was doing and the second he was finished grabbed the knife and drew the same pattern on his own hand.  They didn’t need to say anything to work together like this.  It was something they had practiced so many times.  They could share power through the bond alone, but it was risky, especially without Blaise there.  Runes and blood meant they didn’t have to dive so deep into the connection that they risked losing themselves in it.  Harry had cast a notice-me not on them the second they’d moved away from Lucius, but it wouldn’t hold once the crowd’s attention was drawn back to the man on the table.  The Ministry official stopped talking and nodded to the guard who was in charge of bring the dementor.  Another minute.  Just one minute and the thing would be in the room.  Harry saw the door open and knew it was now or never.
“He stayed at the Manor with Draco.  You need to put your finger on the second spindle from the left of the gate.”
Draco, Sirius and Remus all rushed to him.   The two men had watched in horror when Harry had started screaming, knowing that there was nothing they could do.  Draco was the only one who could stop the spell.  And then realisation had hit them, as it had hit Draco, and they felt like they were being plunged into a nightmare.  They helped Draco carry Harry upstairs, only to run into a panicking Narcissa with an unconscious baby Harry in one arm and a sobbing little Draco in the other.  Sirius quickly took baby Harry, leaving Narcissa to soothe and comfort her distressed son.  Sirius had thought that walking Godric’s Hollow and seeing his best friend dead on the stairs would always be the worst moment of his life.  He couldn’t envisage anything that could even come close to that.  But the scar on baby Harry’s head was bleeding and the green mist had found both versions of the only thing left of the friends who he loved and missed every second of the day.  His body didn’t know whether to laugh or cry at the cruel hand fate had held back.  Harry was his to protect, and he didn’t have a clue how to protect him, either version, from this.
“No.  It’s all good.  We talked this morning.  And then with Tara.”  Harry answered.
“I’m not happy about it -” Hermione huffed.  “- but fine.  I’ll respect your decision.  Why does Andromeda know anyway? I mean I know you go there to see Teddy every week, but that doesn’t explain why she got to know first.”
“Yes and this child nearly killed you when we were sixteen by using an unfamiliar and dangerous dark spell.  You’re not the only one who made mistakes.  I’m not this sodding perfect saviour that everyone seems to want me to be.  You were forced into an impossible situation.  If I’d been in your position.  If that psychopath had been threatening my family.  I would have done exactly the same as you.”  It was a truth that Harry hadn’t thought about, but as the words flowed uncontrolled out of him, he knew he’d stand by them.  They’d both been put through more shit than anyone should reasonably expect of people who were barely more than children.
Tara smiled and picked up a biscuit of her own.  She examined it before removing one of the silver balls decorating her selected biscuit and putting it in her mouth.  “It goes with the job description.  So are we going to come up with a plan?  And remember, if this plan doesn’t work, it doesn’t mean that that is the end of things.  I have a brain full of hundreds of different plans, and I will not give up until you decide it is something you truly do not want, rather than something you think is too hard.  And remember, too hard for the moment is also okay and can be a plan in and of itself.”
They spent the evening eating fish and chips with their fingers from the paper and talking about arrangements for Teddy staying next week.  Harry even managed to bring up the idea of Draco and Blaise coming with him when he took Teddy out at the weekend.  Draco wasn’t sure, but said he’d think about it, which was something.  Harry just hoped talking about the reasons he really wanted Draco to try this with Tara during their next sessions would persuade him.  Having had his little break down, and talked through everything with Blaise and Draco, Harry found sleep came easier to him that night.
So most of the places I've described in this work, and in most of my other pieces or writing are real places.  The tea shop is one in North London that I absolutely adore.  They're closed at the moment due to Covid, but if anyone is ever in the Palmer's Green area I would absolutley reccomend it.  Their menu of teas is amazing, as are their scones.  The same is true of the park I describe in this chapter and the one in the previous one, along with the brief history of the hospital Draco gives.  The odeon cinema I talk about is a special place for me.  It was demolished several years ago, taking with it a piece of history and a building that the Beatles once played in, but the dancing ladies were saved and are now displayed by the new cinema.
The wards still accepted him as he strode through the gate and up to the front door.  Harry knocked three times and then waited.  The seconds seemed to pass like hours before the door opened and a nervous looking house elf stood in front of him.
“Of course, Mr Potter.  You should hear from one of our associates by the end of the day.”
When they were all sat round the table Harry told the two of them the news from the Burrow.
“I know.  It was my fault.  I upset her and then ran out.  Hence Al needing to kick some sense into me.”
“I know they fell out of contact when they were much younger.  I’m not sure about more recently though.  I know mother mentioned something about wanting to get in contact with family again when we were discussing my wedding plans.  Maybe she was talking about Andromeda.”
“I’m sure he’ll cajole me into at least one dance.  His poor toes probably won’t manage more than that.  You guys want another drink?”
“Fun?”
“Okay, I’ll stop teasing.  We should probably get back to the castle now anyway. It’ll be dinner time soon and I want to get changed.”
Draco had left Harry at the Manor, not long after they’d managed to untangle themselves.  He still didn’t really want to leave Harry side but for this next trip Draco needed to be alone.  At least Harry was in the Manor, safe under the wards and with his Mother.  If it came to it Harry knew how to get back to Blaise’s place undetected, if needed.  Draco needed to judge for himself that Andromeda Tonks was trustworthy and would keep their secret.  He had discussed this visit with his mother several times, and it was her that decided to use the cover of the property deed to go and see her.  Teddy was the one person that Harry had left behind that he would run the risk of discovery for.  With everything they’d gone through together, Draco wouldn’t deny Harry this.  It wasn’t fair to deny Harry this chance of happiness.  He knocked on the door.  The close calls today were making Draco feel more on edge than he expected.  It felt like eyes everywhere were watching him.  Waiting to spring out and arrest him for kidnapping Harry Potter.  The door opened and the Aunt he’d never met before stood there.
“Well it did.  He was assigned to keep an eye on me whilst I was on probation.  Or more accurately, catch me out and get my arse sent to Azkaban where it belonged.  Except his eyes on my arse went in an entirely different direction.  We’ve been together since early July.  Nineteen Ninety-Eight, less than three fucking months after the end of the fucking war.”
“Thanks for, you know, helping. I had a bit of a rough day yesterday”
Harry takes over frying the onions from Blaise to let him sit down whist Andromeda is outside with Teddy and Draco.  Rather than sitting, Blaise goes to the fridge and pours himself and Harry a glass of white.  Harry adds a spoonful of flour to the caramalised onions, and slowly starts pouring in vegetable stock whilst the peas start boiling.  Blaise adds a huge dollop of butter and a generous helping of salt and cream to the potatoes and starts mashing.  By the time the others are back, the food is being plated.  With Teddy’s presence, conversation over dinner remains light, although Draco, Blaise and Harry all use the meal to insist that Andromeda stays with them for the night.  Blaise is just rummaging in the freezer section of their cold storage for some icecream that he was sure was in there, when Draco tugged at Harry’s sleeve urgently.
“Tom.  You’re safe here.  We made you a promise.  Do you remember?  We’re your family now.  No one is ever going to hurt you again.  If they try, they’ll have me and Draco to answer to.”
“I’m sorry ‘Mione.  I didn’t mean to.  I know they wanted Malfoy, but I didn’t know they’d chose that specific time to go.”
“We’ve got you Tom.” The first voice said.  The one that sounded less like the stuck-up purebloods.  “Open your eyes properly if you can.  It’s been nearly a week.  We were so worried about you.”
The kitten purred at him contentedly, seemingly wanting to do nothing more than curl up on Harry’s chest and fall asleep.  Harry walked back to the living room, carrying the kitten.  He got a book from the shelf and sat on the sofa, making himself comfy.  The warm furry little creature curled up on his lap now he was seated.  Harry was just getting to a good bit in the book when the fire place lit up green, startling him and making him jump up, forgetting the kitten was still curled up asleep.
“I was never without it.”
Lily did as she was told, quickly washing up in the bathroom and dressing before heading down to the Great Hall, praying that this whole thing would just go away so she wouldn’t have to think about it.  She wanted to just laugh about the whole thing with her friend and go back to enjoying her time at school.  Her time with Scorpius.
“I don’t know why they are either.  It seems a bit extreme.”  The situation was making Hermione curious.  There was something a little off about the whole thing.
“Hawwy sad.”
Draco licked his cheek in response.
“I didn’t get her name.  But it’s this person.” Teddy hand over the photograph.  “The photo was left in the house.”
“Shit Harry, it’s okay.  Just breathe.  If you pass out on me Hermione is going to be pissed.”
“Okay.  Try and eat something later.  Harry, you don’t have a choice.  Breakfast and potions.”  Harry rolled his eyes before smiling at Blaise.
“You can’t say things like that, Potter.”
“I thought I couldn’t get my bandages wet?”  Harry asked, confused.
“Draco, love.  You need to wake up.  We have company.”
“I want to hold you right now.”
“And I’ll be able to claim the Potter estate, even though technically I’m only one and half at this time, and there are two of me.”
“What?”  Draco responded in astonishment.
“Okay, no problem Malfoy” Al’s dad replied and with that his father turned and left without even a goodbye.
“I’m going to write back and tell her no.  I don’t really feel up to a Weasley interrogation about my health.”
It was the 17
Harry winced at the words his ex-wife said.  He knew where she was coming from.   He’d had many of the same thoughts, but seeing his daughters face crumple he knew that Ginny had gone about talking to Lily all wrong.
“Why would a conversation with Angelina make her decide that?  Isn’t she the one who walked in on us at New Year’s?”
“Your mother is going to testify.”  Harry said, trying to distract himself from the thoughts that were going through his head.
“Yeah… It was pretty bad.”  Harry knew that it was an understatement, but he knew from the way Andi’s expression changed, something about his tone or body language had let Andi know that something awful had happened.  He quickly continued, trying to reassure her.  “He’s okay now, actually he just threw me out of his room.  I do need to get back.”  Harry paused then, suddenly making a decision.  “I…  I can take Teddy with me.  If you want.  It’ll be easier for you to go to your appointment without him getting fractious on you.”
“Teddy, we need to wait for Draco, Cissa and Andi before we go in.”
“I wouldn’t.  But I’m sure the stars will understand that it’s December and cold out here.  You need to be wearing some clothes if you want to talk to them more.”
Sirius answered.
Draco took a chair next to Pansy and took note of the other students in the room; Vince, Greg, Theo, Pansy, Graham Montague (a 7
“Don’t you dare fall asleep.  Either of you.”  Blaise said in a commanding tone and Draco opened his eyes.  Blaise left Harry and Draco alone.
“Fine.  I’m not happy, but fine.  Just please promise me that if you’re in any kind of trouble you’ll tell me.  I want to help.  I’m your friend and I can keep your secrets.”
“Good.”  Draco said with a nod and summoned the salt and pepper from the other end of his table so he could season his eggs.
“Does she know about you?”
“Okay, let’s go get Teds packed up.  Don’t promise him cake.  He’s become a bit fixated.”
“Mother can happily rot in hell.”
“What Harry?”
“Th..th..thank you Mipsy.” Draco stammered over the words.
“What’s happened?  I thought things were going better for you.”
“It is my bloody fault.  I shouldn’t have gone back to work.  That’s why he’s here.”
_________________
“Hi.”  Teddy replied, equally unsure.  There were an uncomfortable couple of seconds silence.
“Little Draco?”
“I want to meet them.  Both of them.”
So I decided I quite liked this beginning and have started to continue it into a proper story.  I have storyboarded where I think it will go but it is by no means written and I'm not sure how long its going to take me to finish each chapter.
“Hey Scorp, what are you doing here?” Al said, sounding decidedly suspicious to Scorpius’s ears and grinning widely as he came out of the back of the shop.  Al was never one for subtlety.
“Yes.” Harry said morosely, the guilt from his outburst still eating him up.  He should have come and seen Doris sooner, then maybe it wouldn’t have happened.  Maybe he wouldn’t have said those hateful things.
“So that’s four.  Just the ring to work out.  I know Dumbledore was looking into places that meant something to the snake faced bastard when we left.  I’m guessing the ring was in one of them.  I know he worked in Borgin and Burkes for a while, but I don’t think it’s there.  There’s the orphanage I suppose.”
“Sounds perfect.”
“Hey Princess.” He said, leaning over the cot and picking up the little girl.  She was nearly 7 months old now, and Draco couldn’t believe how quickly it had gone.  He held her against him, and gently rocked her up and down, trying to get her to settle off, after giving her a dose of the sweet pink medicine.  He could feel salvia soaking through his pyjamas where she was drooling on his shoulder.  She was still quietly whimpering, with the occasional hiccough, but the worst of the tears had stopped.  “I’m sorry you feel miserable, little girl.  It will get better.  And Papa is here.  Even though he has a horrible headache because he hasn’t had a cigarette in a week, he’s the one who got out of bed because you were upset.  He gave them up for you, you know.  So you just remember that Papa loves you the most in the whole world.”  He said gently to the nearly sleeping baby, stroking her soft blonde hair as he rambled, trying to soothe her.  Then with a light chuckle he added. “And that Daddy is mean and decided his bed was much more important than comforting his Princess when she was hurting.”
“On who’s authority.”  The guard looked at him, distrust evident in his eyes.  “Lucius Malfoy is to see no one but his solicitor”.
_______________________
The did eventually manage to fall asleep, although not a quickly or chastely as Draco had planned.  One kiss turned into two, and then they were making out.  They both ended up in just their underwear with legs tangled together before they finally managed to stop.  They stayed like that, facing each other and breathing heavily before Draco caved.  He kissed his way down Harry’s chest stopping when he reached the band of his underwear.  Then slowly and deliberately he started to ease them off.
“So, what happened after this fight exactly?”  Doris asked once he had finished the story.
“No other information?”
“Draco?”  His Aunt asked, “Narcissa’s son?”
“Christ, that feels better.”
“I want Harry’s toast.”  Teddy demanded.  Harry was too tired to argue so let Teddy take a bite of his toast.  It was promptly spat out straight into Harry’s hand. As Harry had known it would be.   “Yucky.”
“Oh?”  Robards looked slightly puzzled.
Albus and Scorpious's plotting mean that Malfoy and Harry have to face each other for the first time in years.
“You know you’re insane right?”
“So, how do you feel about my son dating your daughter?” Malfoy started the conversation.
“Go back to sleep then sweetheart.”
“Cake, Cake.”  Teddy said enthusiastically, and not exactly quietly.  Harry noticed Draco open one eye for a second, and quickly indicated that the blond should stay still and pretend to still be asleep.
“Yes.”  Harry said softly and came and sat on the bed.  He started running his fingers through Draco’s hair.
“Because if I do, I won’t be able to pull away.”
“You’re…”
Friday came all too quickly.  Draco apparated them both into his usual alley, although Harry complained that they were going to be far too early.
Lily is devestated at the news of her parents separating
“Good.  How the hell did they know to come whilst I wasn’t here?”
Draco walked out of the room leaving Harry alone.  He felt like a complete idiot.  He’d managed to say the wrong thing again.  He knew Draco was right though.  His children were far too important to mess around, and he’d done enough of that lately as it was.  Harry sat their contemplating how his life had changed so dramatically for several long minutes, sipping at one of the whiskeys they’d abandoned on the table.  Then he got up and went outside to watch the fireworks.  He spotted Angelina talking to Scorpius and Lily, both of them looking sheepish.  He guessed Angelina had caught them doing something he’d rather not think about.  Draco was stood off by himself, lit cigarette in one hand and a glass of red wine in the other.  He was leaning against the wall looking thoughtful.  Harry wanted to go over to him but resisted.  Instead he went over to where Ron and Hermione were standing.  The fireworks started and the sky lit up with rainbows of beautiful colours and moving animals.   A phoenix lit the sky as the clock ticked down to midnight.  Then everyone was singing.  Ron and Hermione had started kissing, as had George and Angelina.  Harry didn’t want to look towards his kids, knowing that they were probably behaving similarly.   Instead Harry looked around trying to find Draco again.  The other man was stood in the back doorway leading into the kitchen.  The cigarette was gone and the glass he was holding now empty.   Harry caught Draco’s eyes and held them for a long moment before the blond man turned and walked back into the house.  Harry wanted to run after him, but instead he let Draco Malfoy walk back out of his life.
“And the Order?”
“Harry… you don’t need to baby me.  I’m fine.  Honestly.”
“He’s out for the count.”
“What do I do instead?  I can’t sit around the house.  Me and Draco would drive each other insane.  Well more insane.  We’d probably end up killing each other.  And he can’t leave.”
“I think this has been the best 6 months of my entire life.”  Harry said.
“Hopefully he’ll talk to Tara when she sees him in a few days.”
“So I have to talk to
“Come on Mother…”  Draco said gently and eased the baby out of her arms and passed him over to Harry.  Narcissa felt very apprehensive about handing over her baby.  He always screamed whenever anyone who wasn’t herself or his godfather held him before.   She was surprised when he didn’t.   Knowing that her little boy felt safe enough with Harry not to bellow the house down, she followed the older version of her son out of the room.  Without Severus around to treat her she was really feeling the effects of the latest beating Lucius had given her.  Draco said he could help, and if she couldn’t trust her own son, who could she trust.
“Sometimes I would escape into London to get away from Father.  I would people watch.  I’m not sure whether they’ll be more or less people around in 1981 though, so we should probably start looking for him from about 6am.  We should check in with each other every 30 minutes.”
“Draco… I play a little, but he’s… His father wasn’t very approving of his learning when he was younger, but his mother encouraged it.  He used to entertain us with the most amazing music in the Slytherin Dorms.” Blaise snorted at the memory.  “He also used to drive us potty in the middle of the night playing when he couldn’t sleep.”  It made him feel sad thinking back on some of Draco’s behaviours back in school, and how he hadn’t picked up that something was wrong.  That he hadn’t been there for him.  “None of us knew that it was his illness that stopped him sleeping.  He was just lovingly eccentric.  Although that description still fits rather aptly, even knowing the cause.”
“Are you two ready to order.”  The waiter said, before Teddy could say anything to Justin.  He felt like a prat for ordering drinks for the two of them without asking the other man.
“Fuck.”  Draco didn’t know what else to say.
“Later.  When the little ones are in bed.”
“About what you said before, I think the truth was that he really didn’t respect Ginny.  He told me something else as well… something that if it was true, well, I don’t think I’d blame him for not respecting Ginny all that much.  And this one wouldn’t just be a case of him not trusting us enough and talking about it.  It’s just… I don’t know… It’s pretty awful and I don’t know how to tell you.”
“I don’t know.  I’ve never been able to produce a corporeal one. Why the change in topic?”
“You don’t need me here.  Me and Teddy will be fine.”
“Yes, it’s James and his lot.  I think Teddy bought the weed along.  They know better than to let the underage ones join them, I think.”
“Pans, what is your charming daughter up to these days?”
“Really?  And can I get a report from this mind healer?”
From the moment Harry entered the ministry, he was bombarded by people asking about how he was.  He could feel a headache building, even though they’d been settling down significantly despite the additional stress of Draco acting out at home.  He’d felt better since admitting the cause of his accident to Blaise.  Neither of them had told Draco yet.  That was not a conversation Harry was looking forward to.  When he finally entered the offices of the DLME there was no reprieve from the well-wishers.  All of his colleagues wanted to know when he was coming back.  He did eventually manage to get to Robards’ office on time.  When he knocked on the door the familiar voice of the head of the department told him to enter.
“Hermione, please don’t force me to tell you this.  It isn’t fair.”
“Tawly, Harry is in danger.  You have to let us in.”
“I’m tired though.  I don’t want to fly Draco.  I don’t fly anymore.  Not after the fire.  We don’t fly anymore.”  Harry was feeling more and more distressed. His breathing erratic.  He didn’t want Draco to get on the broom.  Just the thought of it was making his panicked state worse.  He knew Blaise wanted to come closer, to help calm him, but the magic was stopping him.  Then Draco looked at Harry properly for the first time.  The magic started calming.
Little Harry looked at it and then Draco in wonder.  Then he looked sternly up at Harry, making Harry’s heart melt a little.
“Bastard.”
“That’s… I saw him trying to sneak out of the house that morning.  I told how happy I was about the two of them.  I even teased him about mum finding out about him spending the night in Gin’s room.  Why didn’t he just tell me?”
____________________
“Where are we going?”  Blaise asked.
“Just make it stop…. Please…” Draco begged.
“You really shouldn’t shut yourself down there for hours on end.  It’s not good for you, dear.  You should see some of your friends.  I’ve been here for more than a week now and I don’t think I’ve seen you receive so much as an owl from any of them, let alone have one of them visit.”
“Sure Malfoy.  Do you want to bring your son to Fortescue’s once you’re done?  We should be there in an hour.  I promised Al and Lily ice-cream before we headed home.  Scorpius is welcome to join us there”
“I know.  Really weird. But I have a really weird family, so it kind of goes with the territory.”  Teddy seemed to try and blow this off as an unimportant piece of information, but it seemed like more, and in spite of himself, Justin couldn’t help but ask.
“Not even I’m that much of an idiot, Love.  I was thinking about sending them some of the souvenirs from our travels, you know, like the postcards I used to buy them.  Maybe even some copies of our photos.”
“I know, love.  But it’s coming back.  Just like we said it would.”
“If it had been me out there, I’m not sure I would have had the restraint to leave it at a threat.  No one is ever taking those babies away from us.  Now you look like you need to get some sleep.”
.  My Aunt found me in the morning.”
“If I remember correctly, it wasn’t exactly brilliant before that.  I remember it was one of the things we worked on together before your eldest son was born.”
“I have been designated as a pillow.”  Draco was lying so that his head rested on Harry’s lap.
_______________
Draco started laughing.  It was a strange hysterical laugh.  He heard Potter start laughing too, which only made it worse.  The two of them were lying on the lawn in front of the gates unable to let go of each other.
“Besides, his messed-up sleep patterns aren’t exactly something we can blame him for.”
“Great you’re happy.  You know what Harry.  I don’t want to hear any of your pathetic excuses.  Get out.”  Ron uttered, his fuming temper evident in every word. It wasn’t what Hermione wanted, she still had more questions, but keeping Harry here with Ron was not helping.
“They can wait till the morning.  I’ll just tell them I was upset and didn’t feel like going back to the tower.  It’s not even a lie.  The only place I feel like being is with you.”  Harry kissed Draco deeply.  “That’s both of you by the way.”  Harry added when he broke the kiss and stroked a hand down Blaise’s side.  Blaise leant across Draco and kissed Harry passionately in return and Draco felt every flick of Blaise’s tongue against Harry’s mouth and gasped.  He could feel himself getting hard.
“Well they did hate each other in school.  Mum used to tell me stories of her and Dad’s time back in Hogwarts.  Our Dads’ rivalry goes back to their first year.  Supposedly they were always managing to get each other into trouble.  Dad never really liked it when Mum told those stories though. I remember a couple of times they ended up rowing about it.  They were arguing a lot just before we came back to school” Lily’s expression become more melancholy when she talked about her parents quarrelling, her voice sounding a little sadder as she continued. “I haven’t told my parents either, though I don’t know whether Al has mentioned it in one of his letters.”
“What’s the time, Draco?”  Harry asked when they were alone and seated in the open plan living area.
“I think these ones are closer to three hours.  I found some of one of the better batches.  We shouldn’t hang around though.”  Draco replied.
“What actually happened?”  There was real concern in Hermione’s voice.
“You promise to be good.” Draco was smiling down at him.
“Just… tell him I’m sorry.  That he is still my baby boy.  And that I love him and missed him everyday we were apart.  Just… please.”
Hermione was waiting by the floo point at St Mungo’s, as if she expected Harry to try and avoid her if she wasn’t watching.  She tried to hug him when he approached her, but he held her back.  Physical touch hurt his injuries, and although it was worth it with Draco and Blaise, he didn’t really want to with anyone else.
Blaise was in the bathroom adding a variety of potions to the steaming water of the bath he’d run for Harry.  He turned to look at the two of the when they walked in hand in hand.
“Sure, sure.  Head back and I’ll be there in…let’s say 10 minutes. I just need to get rid of my house guest.”
“I love you too.  More than anything.  I don’t like that I hurt my old family, though.  Seeing them made me realise again, how badly I treated them.  I don’t think I’m ever going to be able to bring myself to see them again after today, not sure I even want to try, but I still want to do something make it up to them.”
“Newt Scamander! The author of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” Hugo exclaimed.  “Care of Magical Creatures is my favourite subject, and he had loads of incredible stories about Thunderbirds, Erumpents, and some really amusing ones about his old Niffler and Bowtruckles.”
Draco entered the kitchen, followed by his mother and Aunt.  He immediately went for the cup of coffee and smiled gratefully at Harry.
Before they could all leave Aunt Daphne stepped out from behind the bar, and to his embarrassment hugged him.  Then the four of them approached the fireplace and, with Al going first, they all headed back to the Potters’ house.
“Hermione. Shit.  I should of thought of it.  We need to find it before we leave.  It needs to be destroyed.  They probably know I’m in here, but they won’t know that you’re with me.  If we leave that device there is a chance they can use if to trace magical signatures.  I forgot she could do that.”
“I’ve had a few weeks to think things over. Congratulations by the way.”  Harry was sure that if Lee’s skin tone hadn’t hidden it so well the other man would have gone bright red at that comment, and although Harry didn’t feel any of the anger he’d had when he’d first found out, he found it quite satisfying to make the other man squirm.  After all, he had had an affair with his wife, no matter the appalling state the relationship had found itself in before that had started.
“No.  Let me out of here.  My head is fucking pounding as it is.”
Al and Scorpius spent the rest of the evening in Al’s bed playing exploding snap, reading some of their old comics and eating their way through the stash of sweets and chocolates they both had.  Rather than going to his own bed to sleep that night, him and Al stayed in the one fourposter. The two of them lead top to tail in the bed, talking into the early hours of the morning before finally falling asleep.  Scorpius knew he’d been neglecting his best friend over the last few weeks, caught up in the whirlwind of his new relationship with Lily.  But Scorpius knew that Al needed him there right now, and he wouldn’t abandon his best friend for anything.
“Hey Harry” A familiar voice pulled him out of his contemplation.
“Sweetheart.  It’s okay.  You can cry if you need too. And me and Draco aren’t going to make you do anything that you don’t want to.”
“Okay, Father.” Scorpius replied.  Scorpius looked as troubled and unsure of himself as he had earlier in the garden.  It was a fair assumption that he was worried about Lily’s decision, but there wasn’t anything he could do right now to help.  Draco was right, leaving the two of them to talk would probably be best.
“How?  If you didn’t cheat on her how did you ruin everything.” Al sounded confused.
“A friend of mine lived here a long time ago.  Do you own this place?”  Hermione’s inquisitive nature was slowly but surely taking over her unease at the bizarre situation she’d found herself in.  She was becoming more and more intrigued by this young man and how he’d ended up with Harry’s old house.
“Oh fuck.  Sorry excuse my language.  You are a witch right.  I didn’t just do something really stupid did I?  I mean you saw me coming out of my house.  You couldn’t have done that if you were a… crap I’m making this worse.  It’s just, when I get flustered sometimes I can’t…”
Draco pulled Harry into his arms and kissed his forehead.
“He’s due back any minute.”
“No… can’t help…”  Draco screwed up his face.  Everything hurt.
“Well” and Scopious couldn’t help noticing her blush and look down at her feet as she said this.  “I… kinda need a tutor for potions and I know Scorp is the best in your year and I hoped he could find time to help me out if it wouldn’t be too much trouble.”  She said this all in one breath, very fast, blushing more.  Al didn’t seem to register this to Scorp’s relief, having gone straight back to eating his breakfast, bored with his sister’s interlude.
“That was why his hair looked like Mr Potter’s.  He found this photo.” Andromeda said, handing over the photo of Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny lying beneath a tree by the lake at Hogwarts. “It was on the coffee table in Grimmauld place when he entered.  Sometimes when his emotions run away with him, his metamporphmagus abilities take on a life of their own.  Going to the house the godfather he doesn’t remember left him and seeing that photo.  It was a big day for him.  You badgering him about the Godfather he doesn’t even remember distressed him, and he came straight here to tell me.”
“No worries.  Draco, how are you doing?”
floor….” Harry admitted sheepishly, then hesitated for a long moment before continuing with the explanation.  “I’m using the Black bed.”
“No.  I meant what I said in the café that day.  It’s about time we came out of hiding.  I think there are things we didn’t even realise we were missing out on by living that way for so long.  Good things.  It doesn’t mean I wouldn’t do it again if we had to.  But you don’t want that anymore, and neither do I.  Besides, having you screaming my name in the Slytherin dorms fulfilled one of my long-standing fantasies.  I would have risked arrest a hundred times just for the memory of you pressed up against the window into the lake.”  It had been amazing.  The only thing missing had been Harry wearing a Gryffindor tie to complete the vision.
“I know he wants me to testify against Lucius.  But I don’t know if I can do it…”
“I’m going to go grab us all some champagne.”  Harry says and turns and walks away, leaving Ron and Hermione talking excitedly to Ginny.  He couldn’t cope with the unbounded joy directed at him.
“Yes.  Well, Dumbledore made a portkey and sent me to his office.  Then I kind of trashed the place. The door wouldn’t let me out to get to you and I was already a mess as it was.  When he arrived, he told me the prophecy, which was the whole reason I was lured there in the first place.”  Harry felt grief start to overwhelm him again.  He’d pulled himself together for Draco, but he couldn’t keep it up.  “If the bastard had told me before then I never would have gone.  I would have known Voldemort was tricking me.  Sirius would still be…”  Tears started pouring down his face.  “Dumbledore says I still have to go back to them.”
“And how do we explain why I’m with you to your Mother?  Draco, sure, but not me.  Sirius was the only other person we could tell.”
“And Draco was driving me insane.”  Blaise rolled his eyes.
“Why would Snape tell you that?  I thought he was on the Dark Lord’s side.  I know he’s a Death Eater.”  Draco asked.
“Only ten minutes.”
“I don’t know what I want.  I just want it all to go away.”
When they arrived Teddy proudly showed off the cakes he’d been icing to his grandma.  They were a disgusting mess that only family could love, and no doubt contained the extra ingredient of Teddy’s saliva, but they all tried one dutifully.  They sat and ate a light dinner together, before Andi announced that she needed to get Teddy home.   The toddler stropped briefly at this, but seemed placated by the fact that he’d be back to stay the night in a few days.  When they had gone, and the mess in the kitchen was clean, Harry, Draco and Blaise settled down with a glass of wine.  All three had been pretty wiped by a day of toddler entertainment.
“I thought you told me we didn’t need those.  You tried to argue with me for 10 minutes in the store about it.  Who was right?”  The teasing tones that Harry had grown so fond of edging back into Malfoy’s voice.
“It’s okay.” Harry said, stroking Draco’s hair as he pulled him into a tight embrace.  “I’m going to go and see who it is.  Can I have your wand?”
“Do you know how big this sodding place is?  It’s not like any decorators are going to come here and do it for us.”  It wasn’t an outright no, which Harry took as a good sign.  He also found he liked Malfoy grouping them together.  That he thought of fixing the Manor as both of their tasks.  That these weeks together had made them a team.
Hermione didn’t see how to pry more information out of the woman, even though she was sure there was more to the story.  Pressing further wasn’t going to get her anywhere.  She’d just have to research Andromeda and Teddy further or accept this was another dead end.  “Well if that’s all the information you have for me, I suppose I should leave.  I’m sorry for intruding on your time.  I would just like to ask you one favour, if it’s not too much, I would very much like to keep that photo.”
“Harry…”
“Draco.”  Harry reached and placed his hands on Draco’s thighs.  Stroking up and down as Draco stroked himself.
“We could get Blaise to write it.”  The grin Draco let spread over his face as he said this was particularly malevolent and Harry had to laugh.
Molly only frowned a little when Harry brought the boxes of cakes and biscuits in to her just after Bill arrived with Fleur and Victoire.  They were the last of the guests to get to the Burrow, which was now very crowded.  Not long after they were all seated round the dining table.  Teddy was sat in a highchair next to Harry and making a wonderful mess of himself with the roast dinner Harry had cut up.  He’d reached the stage where he was refusing any help when eating, and as a result food often ended up in his ears and hair as often as his mouth.  His skill with a fork was still lacking in many ways.  It made Teddy happy though, and that’s what cleaning charms were for.   Harry listened to the conversations the others were having, occasionally adding the odd comment, but was mostly focussed on his own meal and Teddy.  When Molly had cleared up the main and brought round the tea, coffee and deserts, Harry received his usual praise about the baked goods he’d brought.  Once they’d all got a slice of something in front of them – Teddy had his own special chocolate cupcake that Draco had put in just for him, as he knew it was Teddy’s favourite – Ron stood up.
“Umm.  You guys; are you going to finish the story?  You still haven’t explained the whole, you know, four days unconscious thing.”  Blaise had been listening without interruption to the two of them, essentially just talk back and forth between themselves, even though they were meant to be talking to him.  Their behaviour puzzled him.  It wasn’t just the touching.  It was the whole way they interacted with each other, as if all of their past enmity was dropped for the moment.  Draco being a bit possessive wasn’t new to Blaise, he’d always been a bit like that.  But for him to be possessive over Potter was just bizarre.  And his current actions were over the top, even for Draco.
“You’re not making any sense.”
“Mr Zabini.  I believe I have you to thank for helping Draco back to the hospital wing, as well as apparently finding and assisting Mister Potter here when you found him wandering around the school.  I believe twenty points to Slytherin is in order.  Now, Draco can you please look at me.”
“That’s definitely true.”  Harry gave a small smile.
“Probably.  Also if Siri never took up his family ring in our time then that wouldn’t have helped either.”
“Yes, but I thought you could stay in my bed.”
“I’d prefer not.  I’d rather talk to someone I trust.”  Letting someone else into his mess of a head was not appealing.  Particularly if he only felt able to share less than half of the confusions of his life with them.
“Would you want me any other way?”
Ron’s wide grin was full of the sincerity of his words.  Harry had to plaster his own poor copy of a grin on to his face.  This was why he’d done this after all.  To make his friends and family happy.  Still, the reality of the situation was leaving him feeling even more bitter than he was before.
“Mrs Tonks” Hermione started as she sat down, wanting to get straight to the point. “I’m here because I bumped into your grandson a couple of days ago.”
“Where did the mist go?”  Harry asked as sense of dread and foreboding coming over him.  He had a horrible feeling he knew exactly where the mist had gone.
“But…”
“Are you sure?  I know what Bella was like.”
Harry ate his cheese and sipped at his wine.  The Oxford Blue that Blaise had picked up a couple of weeks ago on a work visit to the city was particularly satisfactory.  Draco wasn’t really eating, just picking at crumbs of cheese.  Draco eventually huffed loudly and put the paper down with more force than necessary.
Harry suddenly didn’t know where to start.  He’d gone through all of it with Doris, but now he was here, confronted with a royally pissed off George, words seemed to escape him.  The silence was starting to become uncomfortable before George spoke again, putting Harry out of his misery.  It wasn’t in George’s nature to let anyone suffer in silence.
“I love you.  If you need to interrupt for any reason you just come in and interrupt, okay.  I know the rule is usually not to do that.  But rules don’t matter as much as you feeling safe.”
“Because we haven’t even met our neighbours with our own faces.  We can’t just bump into friends in the street and say hello.  Because Teddy went to school, got all of his post graduate qualifications, and now works under a different name and face than his own.  I want Draco to be able to get the recognition for his achievements he deserves.  Do you know how many prizes for advancements in both potions and charms he’s had to turn down?  Fuck, when we were at Hogwarts did you see how people treated him, and me by association.  No one except you really approached either of us all night, and you only approached me when he was off with the others.  Do you not think I want to know about how everyone is doing, and want them to ask me about how I’m getting on?”  Harry spoke completely openly, and Hermione felt for him.  A lot of the problems he had were caused by his own actions in disappearing so abruptly, apparently without caring about those he hurt when he did so.  She also could completely understand why they’d done it.  The Ministry’s reaction at their first public appearance together was enough for her to understand why they couldn’t have come out and been together publicly back then.  Maybe given enough time to see the two of them together attitudes would have changed, but it probably wasn’t fair to expect two nineteen-year-olds, as they’d been at the time, to want to do that.  She thought maybe Harry’s friends and family might have got it and supported them eventually, the same way Draco’s friends and family obviously had, but they weren’t given the chance, so she would never know.
“You left behind all of the photos of us.”
“I’m ready Blaise” Harry said, when he’d removed his clothes and saw that Draco was comfortably positioned.
Draco’s mouth felt disgusting when he woke up.  He’d fallen asleep in his clothes and hadn’t even managed to cast a cleaning charm on his teeth before he’d passed out.  He fumbled on the bedside table, quickly finding the small phial he was looking for.  Silently praising his house elf, he downed it in one swallow, grimacing at the taste.  A strong wave of nausea followed, but when it passed, the headache and fuzzy feeling the excess of alcohol had left him with dissipated.  Rather than making do with cleaning charms, Draco went to the bathroom and turned the shower on hot and full blast.  Washing away the last of the night’s excesses, he felt human when he looked at the time for the first time that morning, and realised he was going to be late to meet Pansy.  Rushing out of the house he apparated to London and then had to all but run through the London streets to reach the Savoy.
“Just a photo you are absolutely not copying for the Weasleys.”  Draco said handing over the album so Harry could see.  It was the page dedicated to their Diagon Alley escapade.  They’d gotten ridiculously drunk that day wondering through the hub of wizarding shopping in England.  They’d kept their clothes on, most of the time, but once the place had been mostly deserted, they’d held their little dance party in their underwear in the middle of the street.  Things had only gotten more chaotic from there.  Draco still can’t remember who suggested breaking into the Ministry, but that was where they had ended up.  Both couples had ended up completely naked in the fountain in the foyer splashing water at each other.  The particular picture that had amused Draco was of him and Harry kissing under the flowing water.  How they hadn’t gotten caught was a complete mystery and was probably due to a great deal of luck.  It had been a fantastic day, however.
“Nice to meet you Lily, Scorpius has written about you often in his letters.” Draco noticed Lily blush as he said this. “Albus, it’s nice to see you again.  Are you all ready to head back to the Manor?”
“Good, you’re actually going to talk about him then.  You know you’ve been driving me crazy avoiding the subject all week.  I wasn’t entirely sure whether he’d run away scared or actually grow a pair after I talked to him.  Seeing you this week has made me glad he chose the second option though.  Although I will not hesitate to string him up by said bollocks if he hurts you again.”
“We were friends.  It’s why I sent you the photos.  I essentially shut you out of my life and I thought it was a way to let you see some of it.”
“Harry.  If it was to save you and little Harry I would do it in a heartbeat.”  Harry glared, but Draco quickly continued before he could step in and say anything.  “But I don’t have to.”
“Really?”
“And I thought you were meant to be paying attention to your treatment regimen.”  Draco replied, without turning around.
Lucius looked like he wanted to argue but kept his mouth shut at the glare Harry gave him.
“I can’t be your friend, Potter.  I spent all night going over and over all the ways this is going to go horribly wrong.  You have your friends.  Friends you can be seen in public with.  You need to stop coming here.”
“Yes.  Maybe we can spot something they haven’t.”
“I think we’re ready for painting now.” Harry wanted to change the topic.  He didn’t want Malfoy thinking too much about his family, and even more, his family’s tattered reputation.  Didn’t want to lose the positive momentum they had managed to achieve so far.  “Do you want me to cast and impervious charm over the floor?”
“I forgot, it’s your last day isn’t it.”
Blaise closed his eyes and took a breath.
“Ron, I think you should open the box. It’s from Harry.  He wished you a Happy Birthday and says that the present is for the kids.  It won’t be dangerous.”  Hermione was quite certain that Harry wouldn’t send anything that could hurt them, at least not physically, and she was curious as to what he thought the children would like.
There was a long pregnant silence.
“We should check.   There may also be some things in the place that are salvageable.”  Draco responded, clearly thinking over the practicalities of the situation.  Harry didn’t want to buy into the conspiracy theory Draco seemed to be leaning towards, but he had to admit he was curious too.   He didn’t really want to see the destruction of the house, or where his parents died, but the idea that there may still be items there that belonged to him or his parents was too tempting.
“He’s as well as can be expected at the moment.  Aside from the Jam production line.  I don’t really want to talk about what happened.  It was pretty bad.  But he’s home now.”
“We’ve been up since half five.”  Blaise replied, with a slightly pained smile.  It was clear he was exhausted.
Scorpius didn’t know how long he’d been led on his bed just staring up at the canopy.  It must be nearly dinner time.  Maybe he could pop down to the kitchens and get some food off one of the elves.  He didn’t think he could face the crowds in the great hall.  He was just contemplating moving when Al came with a hamper of food.
