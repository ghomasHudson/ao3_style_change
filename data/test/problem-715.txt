“They’re terrible, but she’s got us now.” He planted a kiss on Draco’s head. “Besides, if it’s from you, she’ll think it’s perfect. I know I would.”
Harry couldn’t think of a proper response to something like that, so he went with, “So you’re finally talking to me then.”
“Yes, well. Misery loves company, as they say.”
He paused midway through ladling some of the soup into a bowl. “Whatever for?”
Harry watched as the students filed out of the Great Hall, first years following prefects, and felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned to see McGonagall, looking weary and for the first time in a while, like her age.
“Er, Miss Zinke?”
He made his way back to the staff table and took his seat - which, much to his chagrin, was next to Malfoy. As McGonagall stood up to make her customary start of term speech, Harry struggled to resist the urge to just...stare at the other man, who was dutifully paying attention to McGonagall, unlike him.
He could not, for the life of him, corner Malfoy. And frankly, he was at his wits end. He even had gone so far as to memorise Malfoy’s schedule, in order to pin the man down, but it was to no avail. Harry felt like if he did finally manage to capture Malfoy, he’d end up strangling him as a way to release his pent up frustration.
There was a loud knock at the door. Harry made his way over and opened it, finding Amara standing there and struggling to balance a tray laden full of food. There was some sort of steaming lentil soup, what looked to be shepherd’s pie, a tankard of pumpkin juice, and best of all - a thick and hearty slice of treacle tart.
“Why not?” he asked.
“Hey, Miss Zinke,” Harry said sternly. “You are never a bother. And besides, if I really thought of you that way, I wouldn’t ask you to join me. Come on, you must be hungry.” He turned around and made his way to his desk, setting the tray down on it. Then he went and dragged the armchair next to the fireplace over to his desk. When he was finished, he saw that Amara was still standing in the doorway, watching him with hesitation in her eyes.
Frankly speaking, Harry was just baffled about the whole thing. And to be honest, it felt like every time his eyes weren’t on Malfoy, that Malfoy’s were on him. Which he also didn’t understand, because it was as though Malfoy was equally confused by Harry’s presence, when Harry had been a professor at Hogwarts for seven years now.
, Malfoy was a quintessential socialite, and in France no less. The last he had heard from him personally was after having owled Malfoy his old wand again, having received a brief thank you note in return.
“What?”
“Well...if you’re certain, Professor,” she said uncertainly.
“Nothing!” Harry waved his hands frantically. “I didn’t do anything. In fact, I tried to start a conversation with him, but he wasn’t interested. And then he asked me something and it startled me so I sort of...spilled pumpkin juice all over my plate. Then things got weird and he left the feast early and now I’m here, repeating the tale for you to laugh at me instead.”
“I can’t take this anymore. Ron, I’ll leave this one to you. Harry, I love you very much, but Merlin help you,” Hermione said, patting her husband on the shoulder before leaving them both.
The blond drummed his fingers against the windowsill and looked away. “I...in France, things were okay. Good, great even. I was well-loved by my students and respected by my peers. But everything felt off-kilter. It didn’t matter if they thought that well of me, because I knew that I hadn’t done anything to deserve that praise. And Mother, well, she’d pretend like everything was the same. Like nothing had changed for us, when in reality...well, everything had. I couldn’t take it anymore. So I left.”
“Well, what did he ask you?” asked Ron, curiously.
He made his way back to his rooms, meandering through the school as he did so. Sometimes he liked to take his time aimlessly traversing the halls - he found it comforting to just walk, and walk, and walk. There was never a particular path he liked to take, he just let his feet go wherever they felt.
He’d never know, and it made him feel sick.
“So what I’m hearing is that you, in essence, wanted to make right your wrongs, or rather be held accountable for them? And now you’re moping because no one is, so you’ve taken it on yourself to self-flagellate,” Harry said matter-of-factly.
“Obviously, you were watching us.”
This year promised more excitement than most - Flitwick had finally retired, and along with the departure of the Slytherin head Caprine, that meant new staff members arriving. They hadn’t come to the school prior to the start of term like most of the other Professors usually did, and all McGonagall would tell him about the new Charms Professor was that they were renowned for their work in France. In wondering over his new peer, Harry felt like a small kid come Christmas Eve, bubbling over with curiosity that couldn’t be sated.
“Yeah.”
“It’s not about having faith in him or myself, it’s about not destroying the very fragile relationship that I’ve been nurturing into existence,” argued Harry. Ron was missing the point, entirely. He didn’t understand the deep-seated fear Harry felt in his bones, he couldn’t understand the stakes at play right now.
Though in thinking of Hermione, he found his mind drawn to thoughts of Malfoy. Malfoy who, like Hermione, always seemed to have his nose plugged into some sort of archaic or esoteric text when he wasn’t involved with something else. Harry found himself wondering how Malfoy would respond to the way Harry taught his classes, and wondered how Malfoy himself taught his own. From the mutterings of his students, Harry had gleaned that Malfoy was much like McGonagall - tough, but fair; interesting, but strict. But it was one thing to hear it from students, and another to see it for himself.
“Excuse me, it’s who now?” asked Ron.
“If you already know the answer to your own question why even bother asking it?” Harry grumbled.
“I don’t think that of you,” Malfoy scoffed.
That hadn’t been the response he was expecting from her, but it also gave him pause for a moment. Since when had he, really? He hadn’t given much thought about it, and the way they were right now felt like they way they had always been. But obviously this wasn’t true, and he was in unexplored territory with Draco.
Oh, well. He’d deal with it as it came up, he supposed. He tossed a bit of floo powder into the fireplace and gave them a call. Ron’s head dutifully appeared in the fireplace soon after.
Eventually Draco tired himself out, and he let out a relaxed sigh as soon as the laughter trailed off. “Sorry, I shouldn’t have laughed. It’s just...you’re right. It’s incredibly weird.” More shyly, he added, “but I find that I don’t mind it. It turns out you’re tolerable company after all.”
And frankly, he just didn’t understand why.
“So, did you bring this all the way from the feast then?” Harry asked, rifling around in his cupboards for some extra utensils and plates for Amara to use.
“The girl. What did you say to her?” Malfoy’s voice cut in, startling Harry so hard he knocked his goblet of pumpkin juice over and onto his plate of food. Harry stared forlornly at his plate, mourning the loss of a good meal. Malfoy, for his part, was still not looking Harry in the eye, but there was a glimmer of a smirk playing around the edges of his lips.
He came to a stop near Amara Zinke, and paused to watch her progress. Amara’s brows were furrowed in concentration - and perhaps frustration as well - and her wand was clenched tightly in her fist. She repeated the wand movements as Harry had shown the class, but instead of a singular fluid motion, it was a series of choppy movements. With each failed attempt to knock back the stack of books, the furrow between her brows grew deeper.
Harry let out a crazed laugh. “Tell him? Tell
There was silence. And more silence. And more silence. And more silence. And then it seemed as though Malfoy’s whole body collapsed in on itself. He turned back toward Harry with a weary look on his face.
Harry rolled his eyes. “And how was I to interpret ‘lest I sick up all over you’, then?”
As October slid into November, as the air turned crisper and the beginnings of a winter chill began to settle over the school grounds, and as the leaves fell from the trees, Harry found that the seeds of friendship he hand planted with Draco finally began to blossom and flower.
“Erm,” said Harry.
Harry nodded, already standing up from his seat in front of the fireplace. “Of course, ‘Mione. Thanks for talking with me, though.”
“Think nothing of it, Amara. My door is always open,” he insisted.
“If you’re sure, Harry. Good night.”
“‘Just Draco’,” said Hermione, with a raise of her eyebrow.
Harry felt eyes on him and he turned to the side. Malfoy was watching him, with an unreadable look in his eyes. Harry wanted to say it was one of concern, but that would require a level of hope that Harry didn’t have in him today. Instead, he just felt irritated at being examined like an insect under a microscope.
Harry felt like she owed him one too, but he’d come to realize in his ancient twenty-eight years of life that sometimes shutting his mouth was actually the best option after hearing what usually came out of it, so he shoved another biscuit into his mouth and chewed furiously.
In due time, he of course, landed back at his rooms. The first thing he did was make his way to the floo to call Ron and Hermione. had promised he’d tell them immediately who the new Charms professor was (which was, of course, on Hermione’s request. She was insistent she knew who her future children were going to be taught by.) He internally winced at the thought of their reactions to this new development.
All it boiled down to was Harry realizing he was a right shit of a person. Malfoy really hadn’t done anything wrong, but already Harry was treating him with suspicion. He wondered if many other people treated Malfoy that way, such that his response was to become restrained and withdrawn. He wondered how many people treated Malfoy even worse. Harry found that he didn’t like the answers his mind came up with.
“No, it
“I-what?”
Hermione worried at her lip a bit. “Harry,” she began carefully. “Since when has Malfoy been ‘Draco’ to you?”
“I...think this is something you need to figure out on your own. Just think about it. I think if you do, you’ll understand soon enough,” she promised. “Look, think about it this way. You spend as much time with Malfoy as you do with us when we’re around in person. Do the feelings you have about Malfoy apply to the way you feel about Ron and I?”
“Whoa there, mate. You all right?” Ron asked, concerned at what must have been Harry’s increasingly panicked expression.
and it was quite a riveting treatise on the theoretics of creating a charmed object that comports a patronus inside of it, I’ll send it over for you to read.”
Ron's forehead wrinkled. Hermione frowned deeply and she gazed off in apparent thought.
had made an exhaustingly huge deal out of it, like they did with everything he ever did.
There was a moment of silence and then: “I’m sorry.”
Harry took a moment to digest this information. What he’d expected was something insulting, and snide, that beat around the bush and didn’t really answer his questions. Instead he had got something raw and incredibly vulnerable and unexpected. He was at the edge of a precipice and what he said next would either toss Malfoy into a black abyss from which there was no return, or pull him away into the arms of someone safe.
“Well that’s a shame, isn’t it? Waste of good food if you ask me,” said Ron, looking the picture of disappointment.
Harry stared him down and waited for a response. And waited. And waited. And waited. When it became clear Malfoy wasn’t going to say anything, Harry took it upon himself to break the silence. “You’re the one who told Amara to bring me food, aren’t you?”
“Oh, you know. The usual. Treacle tart galore, and someone cried about being placed into Slytherin again. How are things at the DMLE?” Harry skirted around the subject.
“Well, no, but that’s besides the point I think,” huffed Harry.
Harry continued to make the rounds throughout the class, adjusting students when and where he saw fit. Every time he paused to check on Amara, she seemed to have improved herself. Internally, it pleased him to note this. There was hope for her yet.
The more he thought about it, the angrier he became, and the worst part about it all was that the man responsible for it was dead. And he should be happy about it, but he wasn’t. Part of him wished Voldemort was still alive, so he could punish him again, and again, and again. Part of him knew this was sick and twisted and wrong, but he couldn’t help but feel that way.
“Er, is that all you have to say, then?” Hermione usually didn’t choose to be cryptic and vague, she’d always been more to the point and blunt about the state of things, so Harry was irritated that it seemed this was all she felt the need to say right now.
At that, Ron let out a snort. “Malfoy the reason why you dumped pumpkin juice all over your plate then, eh? I’ll bet it is.”
Harry sighed and pulled on a winter cloak, scarf, gloves, and some heavier boots. It looked like there was no worming his way out of this interaction. He slunk out of his rooms, Draco following shortly behind. They walked in silence for a time as they made their way onto the grounds. Near the lake that had by now frozen over, Draco stopped and reached out, grabbing one of Harry’s arms to get his attention.
Despite having been a Professor for a good few years at this point, the start of a new term always filled Harry with the same sense of anticipation it had as when he had first come to Hogwarts. The sense of excitement amongst the new students was electric and palpable, and always transferred to him. He shifted on his feet and crossed his arms, leaning back against the wall of the entrance hall where the first years were to arrive, led by Hagrid as per usual.
In an instance like this, normally Harry would refrain from rolling his eyes. But it was Malfoy, so of course, he didn’t.
Fortunately, this endeavour did quiet his brain, if only for a bit. Essentially being the Dursley’s live-in maid had made him rather...averse to cleaning on his own accord, but he did have to admit that the mindless nature of the task always did do a good job of distracting him when he needed it.
“What in the bloody hell is wrong with you, Malfoy?” Harry asked, a sort of quiet fury laced into the tone of his voice.
“Yes?” asked Harry.
“Yeah, I know. Thanks, Ron. I ought to head to bed, it’s late.”
“Good lad.”
“Er, well, you know I would for you ‘Mione, but. I’m not so sure that’ll be happening anytime soon.”
But there was really no other option, in Harry’s mind. The more time he spent with Draco, the stronger his feelings would grow. He needed to cut it off before it took root and grew stronger, or else he was fucked. Not that he wasn’t already.
“I would, if you could. But since that doesn’t seem to be happening, I don’t think I will.”
Harry sighed, and pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose. “Yes, Miss Zinke. All the homework you’ve been turning has been half-complete at best, non-existent at worst. I’m worried about you - what’s been going on? Are you all right?”
“Now, Miss Zinke, do you think you can try that for me?” He asked softly. She nodded furiously and turned to try it herself, looking somehow uncertain and yet more sure of herself than before. Harry quickly reset the books for her, and watched carefully.
“I believe,” she began with a great sigh, “that I owe you an explanation, Harry.”
Harry felt like this was a moment where he should get offended, but seeing as he wasn’t sure what Hermione was trying to imply, she might have a point. There was a tap at his windowsill, and he glanced over to see Draco’s owl, a snowy owl named Xue, at the window.
Harry scratched at the nape of his neck sheepishly. “Er, well, to tell the truth, I spilled pumpkin juice over most of my food. So I didn’t get to taste much of it.”
“Don’t really know anyone who would disagree with you there, Ron,” responded Harry.
Harry watched the other man’s delight, and found warmth blooming deep within his chest. He wanted to reach out and pull Draco toward him, he wanted to tuck soft blond locks behind one ear, wanted to cup his face in his hands, wanted to trace the lines of his mouth with his fingers, wanted to pull him into a soft kiss.
The look that Harry received from McGonagall was one of deep disapproval. Maybe he should have taken a third biscuit. “You know, Harry, I know how much you hate the
“How do you know that?” He asked, confused and wondering for a brief moment if he’d ever accidentally waxed lyrically about the wonders of treacle tart during class.
He found himself wondering what they’d be doing now, if they were still alive. Would they have retired or still working? Would they be proud of him? Harry liked to think that they would, but he’d never know for certain. The chance to know had been taken away from him.
Before his mind could wander too far in its daydreams, three knocks were heard on castle doors. Harry swung them open and Hagrid came bustling in with a load of nervous first years following behind, like little ducklings after their mother. Harry straightened his posture and stood tall, trying to resemble the picture of a responsible and serious Professor, though he knew he was probably failing.
the day after I admit that I know I’m terrible. You know...I thought we were becoming friends, of a sort. And every time I tried to corner you, you managed to disappear on me. Frankly, it’s making me feel like I’m some sort of dragon pox-ridden leper. Don’t think I didn’t notice that pile of unread letters by your bedside, too.” His voice shook a bit, and when Harry looked closer, his eyes were suspiciously bright.
“Yes, well. If I had to hazard a guess, you are not the only one,” Malfoy responded coolly. There was an odd note to his voice, a mixture of resignation and what Harry almost wanted to say was disappointment. Malfoy’s attention was directed firmly on his plate of food, his eyes refusing to meet Harry’s. They lapsed into silence, Malfoy seemingly uninterested in continuing the conversation and Harry not really knowing where to go with it.
“Oh, come on. I haven’t had Hogwarts food in years. You’re usually more detailed than that, Harry.” Just like Ron to latch onto the thread of what Harry wasn’t telling him, wasn’t it?
Harry sat up. “What.”
Harry awoke on Halloween, the day of his parent’s death, with a restless itch under his skin. This was par for the course. If it were any other day, he’d get rid of the restlessness by going for a run, or flying on the quidditch pitch if it were empty. But it was, of course, Halloween, and so he couldn’t.
Malfoy stared at him, mouth agape.
Malfoy’s hands paused in the patterns they were drawing on the table, and his gaze snapped up to meet Harry’s. “Why...Harry, why are you telling me this?”
For his part, Ron looked like he didn’t agree, but he held himself back. “If you’re certain this is what you want to do, Harry...I won’t stop you. But you know what I think.”
He intertwined his fingers with one of Draco’s hands and lifted it up, placing a soft kiss on the palm of Draco’s hand. “You act as though you weren’t enjoying every minute of it.
He pushed the plate of treacle tart toward her. “Here, have some tart. It’ll make you feel better.”
“Nowhere. Just thought I ought to remind you, before you get too in your head again,” she said.
He excused himself and told McGonagall he was feeling particularly ill today. By the look on her face, she knew he was lying, but to her credit said nothing. He returned to his rooms and threw himself atop his bed. With no idea how to get rid of the buzzing in his ears, or the itch underneath his skin, he tried to force himself into a restless sleep.
Couldn’t he?
“So that’s the thanks I get for making sure you don’t forget to feed yourself on today of all days?” Malfoy sniped.
“Huh. McGonagall told me that he came to her, actually.”
“Personally, I’d be all for hearing your suspicions, ‘Mione. It’d probably help me,” said Harry, with what he would not admit was a tinge of desperation in his voice.
“Of course, Harry. Have a good night.” With that Ron popped his head back out, and Harry doused the flames in the fireplace. He sighed, standing up and wiping any dust and soot from the front of his robes and trousers.
Something like hope began to flutter in Harry’s chest, but he tried to dampen it. “I said that I think I’m in love with you.”
It’s fine. That’s fine. It would be fine. He’d be fine. Everything was going to be fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
“I told her what I tell every Slytherin who gets upset about their placement: that Merlin was one, that Snape was one, and that I almost was one, too.”
“I dunno myself, mate. You know him better than I do at this point,” said Ron, rather unhelpfully.
“Fine,” was all Harry said.
“Although, Harry, if I could ask you a question?” Draco put forth hesitantly.
Malfoy opened his mouth, but then paused, hesitation crossing his features. He schooled himself back into a more composed look, and then coughed to clear his throat. “I best take my leave early. I only arrived this morning, after all. Much is needed to prepare for the start of term. If you’ll excuse me then, Potter.” He placed his utensils down on his plate, got up, gave a nod to McGonagall and simply...walked out of the Great Hall.
“I said,” Draco spoke even more softly than Harry, “say that again.”
“Well what?”
“Uh, well,” said Amara, looking somewhat sheepish. “I have to admit that it wasn’t my idea to bring you food. I ran into Prof-someone in the kitchens who told me you weren’t feeling well and asked if I’d bring you some food, and they knew all your favourites.”
They lapsed into a silence that lasted till they parted ways, but it was a comfortable one.
He clucked his tongue. “I’m serious, Amara. I would love the pleasure of your company, even if you don’t want to eat.”
bloody pride, or his bloody feelings, when there’s a fucking student’s well-being at stake!”
If only Voldemort had chosen a more opportune day to kill his parents.
There was a moment of silence as Draco processed Harry’s question and then, much to Harry’s surprise and delight, he burst into laughter. Rather than the derisive and snide snickers Harry remembered from their childhood, Draco’s laughter sounded...lighter. He kept snorting from laughing so hard, and tears of mirth threatened to pour from his eyes. It was unrefined and out of control and unlike anything Harry had ever expected from someone as...prim as Malfoy was. He enjoyed watching it immensely.
There was a loud banging on his door that startled him out of his thoughts. He jumped in his chair, and nearly knocked his cup of tea over. The banging stopped as abruptly as it had started.
“Well,” he said slowly, “I think...it’s been almost a full month now, yeah?”
Both Harry and Ron’s heads swiveled to look at her, incredulous at her lack of surprise or displeasure.
He said all this and more to Hermione one late November evening, hoping that perhaps she’d know what was going on. Because, well, it was Hermione. She watched him with a calculated stare through the fireplace, but stayed silent.
Ron narrowed his eyes even further. “Well, do you have any plans to tell him?”
“Harry.” Hermione narrowed her eyes at him. “What did you do?”
Harry felt his face flush with a sudden warmth that blossomed from within him. It was odd, but he’d never really...told anyone those thoughts before. Not even Ron or Hermione. And being validated in a way he hadn’t expected to be was disconcerting. Usually he felt sure-footed but now it was like he’d been thrust into something new and unfamiliar, though he couldn’t say it was an unwelcome feeling.
“I said, have you considered writing him a letter?”
Harry considered Ron’s proposal. If Malfoy wouldn’t talk to him in person, he wasn’t really sure he’d talk to him through letters, either, but...Ron was right. There really was no harm in trying.
“Of course, Professor,” she said, looking at him curiously.
“I’m not saying you can’t be civil to him. But if he wants to talk to you, he’ll talk to you. And if he doesn’t, he won’t. Let it be.” There was a gentle firmness to Ron’s tone of voice, and a knowing look in his eye. What it was Ron knew, Harry couldn’t exactly say.
“I said you’re wrong.” Draco opened his mouth to argue but Harry held up a hand to stop him. “Draco, tell me: Why did you come back from France? Why are you here?”
And because Harry Potter was a coward when it came to love, he ran.
She took a forkful of shepherds pie into her mouth, and chewed thoughtfully. Amara swallowed, and then daintily patted her mouth with a napkin. “Well,” she said, and then paused.
“Er, so...should I apologise?” Harry asked tentatively.
“Did you eat?”
The more the man avoided him, the worse the itch under Harry’s skin got. It built, and built, and it built, becoming more unbearable with each passing second. He was simultaneously exhausted and wired by the whole thing, and it had only been a week.
“I never said that I think that,” snapped Harry.
“Yeah, I do. But I’ll be fine, Ron.” Harry was lying, of course. The look on Ron’s face indicated that he knew Harry was too.
What made it worse was that now, when he wanted to avoid Draco, it seemed the man was omnipresent. Enter the library? Draco’s there, sitting by a window, reading some ancient Charms text. Stop by the kitchens? Draco’s there, making himself a cup of tea. Go for a walk around the lake? Draco’s there, seated under a large tree by the lake, despite it snowing.
He perked up at the chance to talk about who was now, admittedly, his favorite student. “Yes, actually. She’s been turning in her work on time, and participating more frequently in class. She also seems to be struggling with the theory less and less, too. I have my own suspicions someone is tutoring her, but that’s not a bad thing. I’m quite happy for it, really.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Your effusive praise will stay with me for days, Draco.”
Malfoy drummed his fingers on the table and looked off to the side. “I asked, did you eat?”
The uncomfortable itch under his skin grew a bit stronger.
Well. Perhaps Harry had been wrong in his earlier assumptions. He made his way over to the door, and opened it to a rather disheveled and frantic looking Draco. His hair was ruffled, like someone’s hands had been run through it multiple times, and his normally pristinely-pressed robes were ruffled and wrinkled, as though they’d been put on haphazardly. Even the laces of one of his boots were untied. He was wild-eyed as he pushed his way into Harry’s rooms.
“Time for what, exactly?” Harry said into the carpet.
Hermione let out a bright laugh. “Yes, but we both know I’d be lying.”
“Of course I do, ‘Mione. I love you too, but where is this coming from?”
“But what if- what if they’re right? What if all I’m good for is bad things, what if I can’t create anything good, and right?”
“Oh, nothing,” she said innocently. “He seems like a good professor, from everything you’ve told me.”
It was Harry’s turn to frown. “What’s that got to do with anything?”
“Your parents are a load of wankers,” he said, matter-of-factly.
“Uh-huh,” said Hermione, in a tone that implied the opposite was true. She gave him a long-suffering sigh. “You know, sometimes Harry, you’re incredibly thick.”
“Er, well, I sort of panicked? And told him I had papers to grade? And then came here and floo-ed you?”
“You know. There are several great Slytherin wizards and so on and so forth and that even I almost was one.”
“No, I can make it on my own.”
“Grading.” Malfoy was still not looking at him. It felt almost intentional at this point.
The lesson at hand was one Harry had been looking forward to teaching for a while - the ins and outs of the Knockback Jinx. Though, with Harry’s manner of teaching, it was more of a demonstration followed by the students practicing it themselves. Not on each other, of course, but on a stack of heavy textbooks he’d set up prior to the lesson start. Hermione would have a fit if she saw what he was letting his students do to those books, already bruised and battered with age. As he made his way around the room, stopping here and there to lend pointers and adjust stances, it made him smile to think of it.
kept me up last night.”
Harry swallowed down the remains of the second biscuit and wiped the crumbs from his hands on the front of his pants. McGonagall, for her part, did not look very impressed. “Look, I just want to know one thing and I’ll leave it: why him?”
“There is a certain appeal to it, yeah,” Harry laughed.
Harry awoke, sweaty and gasping from a nightmare, and felt the pangs of phantom pain around his scar. He sat up and pulled the bedcovers off, rubbing at his eyes tiredly.  Rather than return to a dreamscape full of flashes of green light and dying mothers, he opted to leave his apartments and go for a late night walk through the school again. The itch under his skin and the buzzing in his ears had returned, and returned with a vengeance, and he thought that maybe exercise of some sort would serve as a cure-all.
“What did you tell the girl, then?” asked Hermione.
“Do you understand how utterly and completely infuriating you are sometimes? Just...just why? Why won’t you talk to me normally? What did I do?” Harry felt his voice getting shrill, and heard the crazed desperation in it. He’d be cringing at himself if he wasn’t so upset right now.
“See? It’s something you had to realize for yourself,” Ron pointed out. “So what happened when you realized then? Have you told him yet?”
“Erm,” said Harry.
“Oh, Draco,” said Harry, resigned to his fate. “That’s not it at all. Couldn’t be further from the truth, in fact.”
“I mean since when has Draco Malfoy been anything but a partying socialite pretty boy?”
After giving Draco a terrible excuse about having some papers he just remembered he needed to grade, Harry hurried off and back to his rooms in a panic. It was just like him to be an idiot and fall in love with Draco as soon as they’d become friends. He made it back to his rooms and slammed the door shut behind him, before sliding to the floor and placing his head in his hands.
,” Harry continued forcefully, “it was kind of you. You did a better job than I ever could have, you know.” He took a seat next to Malfoy, but kept a careful distance between the two of them.
Draco glared at him from over the sandwich, but chewed in angry silence. He swallowed and then: “Didn’t I tell you not to come looking for me if you valued our friendship?”
“Normally I’d take personal offense at ever being compared to Granger but knowing you, this is supposed to be some sort of compliment I assume.” Malfoy sniffed haughtily and picked his quill back up.
“No! Well. It’s just. I come from a family of Ravenclaws, and so, well, everyone at home expected I’d be one too. But I’m not. And, well, they may have said some things about Slytherins and the kind of people Slytherins are that weren’t very...nice. They’re very disappointed in me.” She sighed sadly.
Harry made his way into the room, and took the seat across from Malfoy. “Do you have some sort of sixth sense specifically to detect me, then?”
“Since when?” Harry was incredulous.
The other man pursed his lips and frowned, a furrow appearing between his brows. “Do you really have so little faith in him, and in yourself, Harry?”
Why or what he needed to prepare himself for was not something that he had an answer for. But the annoyance bubbling up inside him at McGonagall felt well-founded, nonetheless.
Hermione’s eyes widened in surprise. “Really? Oh, you must find out why, Harry. And then tell me, of course.”
They always, however, skirted around certain topics, like the war and what came before. Like unspoken rules, that they could be friends, but only at night, and only on a surface level. When he thought about it more in depth, the itch under his skin grew stronger, but he did his best to ignore it. If sometimes his feet found their way to Malfoy’s apartments or office, hands raised and poised to knock on his door before he came to his senses and left, or if sometimes during meals he said idiotic things just to get a reaction to spill out of the man next to him, could Harry be blamed? Self-control had never been his strong suit, after all.
“Oh? And what’s that then?” Malfoy was paying such close attention to his plate that Harry wondered for a moment if maybe Malfoy had taken this job on for the dining benefits.
“The almost-Slytherin sense of self-preservation in me has won out,” grumbled Harry. “Look, I’ll get over it. I just need space from him. If I distance myself enough, I’ll get over my feelings, and then things can go back to normal.”
“Any time, Harry.” She popped her head back out of the flames and Harry made his way over to the window, where he let Xue in. He untied the letter from around her foot, and gave her one of Harriet’s owl treats when she nipped at his fingers. Unraveling the letter, it read:
Ron sighed. “And before I go, I know Halloween is tomorrow. Remember that me and ‘Mione are here for you if you need anything, the whole day. You know that, right, Harry?”
Harry wasn’t stupid - he wasn’t going to deny the possibility that Malfoy was Flitwick’s replacement because, well, he was literally sitting in Flitwick’s old spot. The question was why McGonagall had chosen him. When had he even gotten a Charms mastery? The last Harry had seen, from before he had finally cancelled his subscription to the
He came to a stop in front of the staffroom. The door was slightly ajar, and light spilled out of the cracks, alerting Harry to someone else’s presence. It looked like he wasn’t the only one who couldn’t sleep tonight. He peeked his head in and saw Malfoy seated at the table near the fireplace, scratching away at some parchment with a quill. His internal debate on whether or not to enter the room was interrupted by Malfoy himself.
After what seemed like an eternity of silence, Malfoy, eyes still closed, opened his mouth to speak. “You can come out now, Potter.”
Harry leaned back in his chair and scratched at the back of his neck with one arm. Unsure of what to say in response, he went with “Er, well, you’re not alone there.”
Draco gave a suspiciously wet cough to clear his throat. “Well, then what was it?” he asked expectantly.
“Fine,” ground out Harry. “I’ll...let it be, as you say.”
“Well, I knew someone was watching me, and it felt eerily familiar to when you were obsessed with me back in sixth year, if you must know. Not going to curse me again, are you?” Malfoy still hadn’t opened his eyes, but a smile played at the corner of his lips.
“Just. Think about it, Harry,” urged Ron. “You don’t even need to give me an answer. I just want you to think about it.”
“I heard what you said to Amara, Malfoy an-”
Ron rolled his eyes at Hermione. “‘Mione, as much as you find that stuff fascinating, I doubt Harry has the time or the interest. But...is it Sweetleaf? Who’d McGonagall hire?”
Harry for his part, stayed silent and munched on his sandwich, watching Draco thoughtfully. The man had returned his gaze to the stars. He looked lost, and distant. Harry wanted to know what was on his mind, what had him inhabiting the Astronomy Tower for all this time, but part of him felt like maybe it wasn’t his place to ask. And he found that he was okay with that, that he was fine with just being near Draco.
“Oh, I couldn’t Professor. I know it’s your favourite,” she said. She gave him a tentative smile, to indicate she’d heard what he said.
“I’m starting to think that you...might have a point, Professor. Prof-someone else told me something similar.”
“This late at night? I always took you for someone who got things done bright and early.”
It turned out that Harry didn’t have to try hard to leave Malfoy be, as Malfoy seemed to have made it his personal mission to make himself scarce whenever Harry was present. Upon entering the Great Hall on the first day of term, Harry found that Malfoy had switched seats with Hagrid. That alone wouldn’t have bothered Harry, though after a few days it dawned on him that it was a permanent switch.
Harry found that his late night wanderings through the school when his nightmares became too much always conveniently led him to the staffroom, where Draco would usually be, reading or grading or working by the light of the fireplace. He began to bring his own stack of work with him for the times Draco couldn’t be bothered to pay attention to anything but the task at hand. During those times they didn’t talk much, but the silence was comfortable.
“Er, actually, I was just about to go for a walk around the grounds,” said Harry. He was lying of course, but it was the only excuse he could think of to get rid of Draco.
Her movements weren’t as smooth and practiced as Harry’s, but he didn’t expect them to be. The books didn’t fly back with the same force as they had when Harry had shot the jinx, but they still fell over. He clapped Amara on her back enthusiastically. “See? I knew you could do it, Amara.”
Being a professor gave him no time for romance, anyway. Ever since he and Ginny had broken up shortly after the war, he’d never really had a chance to find someone new. And he liked it that way. He liked being alone. He liked the solitude and having his own space and not having to answer to someone when he was feeling upset. It was better that way, he thought.
“Hello, Potter,” said Malfoy.
The children all stared at him wide-eyed and awed, the way most people still did. Much to his own personal discomfort, Harry was still regarded as a...legend of a sort. He supposed killing maniacal megalomaniacs sort of had that effect on how people viewed you. But it was no matter, they’d learn he was still just as annoying of a Professor as the rest of the staff soon enough, and that awe would be replaced with a sense of normalcy.
Harry didn’t mean this in a negative way - all right, maybe he did, actually - but Malfoy was as slippery as an eel. If, prior to this, Harry had convinced himself Malfoy wasn’t purposefully avoiding him, he had been thoroughly disabused of that notion.
Harry looked up at Ron’s face in the fireplace, unamused. “We’ve known each other for seventeen years, Ron.”
If her eyebrows could raise further, they probably would have. “You find yourself thinking of Draco as a parent often, then?”
Harry doused the flames and stared at the embers of the fire for a bit, Ron’s words ringing in his head. The thought of telling Draco how he felt...it was far too much. He didn’t know how he’d go about it, where he’d tell him, what he’d even say to mitigate the risk. And he couldn’t lose Draco, he just genuinely refused to let him go. So there was no other option but to hide, and shove his feelings away, until they disappeared like they were never there in the first place.
“I have not been anxious,” Draco said, voice muffled from the pillow. “I just wanted to ensure everything was perfect. When she told me her parents told her not to come home for the holidays, I had half a mind to just adopt her right then and there. Honestly, what kind of people are they?”
“I should be angry at you for searching me out when I explicitly told you not to, but I can’t find it in myself,” sighed Draco, turning back to the stars. All of a sudden, he let out a bright and excited laugh. He reached his head out the window. “Look! It’s started to snow, Harry.”
Harry shrank back down into his chair, and chose to stare at the portraits hanging up above her head instead of at the stern visage of the woman currently scolding him. Snape was smirking at him, likely pleased he’d made a fool of himself. Dumbledore was smiling gently at him, in that knowing way of a teacher outwaiting a student too scared to admit having done something wrong. Not that Harry would admit to being any of these things, of course.
He said as much to Ron, in one of their many floo calls, agonizing in depth over the whole thing. Ron was not very sympathetic.
“I know, Harry.”
“Even if it was, which I’m not saying it is, you can’t just use words like...like that,” she insisted, red in the face.
It was in that manner that before the blink of an eye, a whole month had passed, and the school was heading into October. The leaves of the trees had turned from various shades of green to burnt orange, red, and yellow and littered the grounds of the school. The crisp air bit the noses of those who lingered outside, and students and professors alike switched out their clothes for heavier weight fabrics. It wasn’t Harry’s favourite time of year, as Halloween was up and coming, and with it brought more restlessness and night time wanderings. But he had to admit that Hogwarts was a beautiful place during autumn.
“You know, they say that after a while, married couples start turning into each other.”
Stormy gray eyes pierced his own, giving Harry an unfathomable look, distracting Harry, so it took him a few seconds to process the question. “Yeah,” he said. “The hat almost Sorted me there. It would have Sorted me there if I hadn’t refused.”
“Stupid?” offered Harry. “That’s because it is. No one’s treating you poorly because we can all see that you’re a different person. Do you really think that I would be sitting here with you, bringing you sandwiches, if I thought you were the same person who called one of my best friends a mudblood years ago?”
“Follow me to my office, would you, Harry?” she sighed. She turned on foot and started walking at a rather quick, no-nonsense pace, and Harry scrambled out of his seat to catch up. He followed her through the halls and to the Gargoyle in front of her office, watching as she gave the password (
Harry felt his cheeks heat up in response. “Well, er, maybe?”
Harry heaved out a frustrated cry and fell backwards onto the floor. “I don’t care about
“Yeah?” Harry asked, leaning back in his chair.
Like a turtle tentatively poking its head out of its shell, she carefully made her way into the room and over to his desk, where she took a seat.
The students shared nervous glances with one another, and some of them broke out into worried whispers. It reminded Harry of his first year - how nervous he’d been, how he thought there was some exam he’d have to take, and how scared he was he’d be made a fool of in front of all his peers. He felt for the kids. He did every year. Harry coughed to get their attention again, and the students quieted themselves.
Harry felt a smile creep onto his face. “And so what if I am?”
“Er,” said Harry.
Maybe he should put his nervous energy to use and clean his apartments. Rolling off the bed with a thump, he picked himself up off the floor and examined his surroundings. Books were stacked not on shelves but in jumbled messes upon various pieces of furniture. His desk was a mess of student’s homework and lesson plans. Harriet’s cage by the window was sort of disgusting to look at. The collection of pictures he had by his bedside and on the fireplace mantle were collecting dust. It was admittedly filthy, and nothing really burned out his energy the way a good deep cleaning could. So, he rolled up his sleeves and got to work.
“I know you’re in there, Harry Potter,” came Draco’s voice, sounding rather incensed. “Open up the bloody door right now, or I’ll knock it down myself.”
He rubbed at his face tiredly. “I’ll try it, I guess.”
“I’ve run and run, but I don’t think I’ll ever be able to escape my choices.” He smiled bitterly. “If only I’d been born a good person, right? But I’m not, and I don’t think I ever will be.” Draco fell back into silence.
Malfoy seemed to...jump a little, as though surprised that Harry was speaking to him. But he regained his composure quickly, and had a look about him that was oddly...serene, in a way that felt off. Like he was faking a level of calm that he did not have.
“And this makes sense, how, ‘Mione?”
“Then if I can be capable of very bad, and of - to you - good things too, why can’t you be, sweetheart? Why are you so certain that all you’re good for is the bad?” He pushed a lock of hair behind Amara’s ear. “You are a bright young girl, with a kind heart, and most importantly, you care - about being good, and doing what’s right, such that it bothers you terribly to think that you might be doing the opposite. Do you think bad people, the real bad ones, care about these things? Do you think they concern themselves with such matters? I know for a fact that they don’t. A bad person doesn’t care that they might be bad, but a good person does. You, my dear, are a good person. I know that it may be hard. Don’t listen to the rubbish that your parents or anyone else tells you. Can you promise to try that for me?”
She made her way to the door and then stopped and turned around. “Um, thank you, Professor. And, um, I promise to try to get more of my work in from now on.”
“You know, truthfully, I think sometimes I’d be lost without you and Ron,” Harry pointed out.
“You’re wrong,” Harry replied simply.
“Look,” he began. “You...may be right. I’ve not known Malfoy for a long time, and to be fair, I don’t think I’ve ever really known him to begin with.” He pulled at a loose thread on the arm of the chair he was sitting in. “And I know my past with him is...difficult, but I spoke for him at the trials. I gave him his wand back. If he’s a good teacher, he’s a good teacher, and I won’t let myself interfere with that.”
More than ironic, it was pathetic.
Draco glanced to the side, gaze drawn to Harry. “What?”
She nodded and all but ran out of the room. Harry sighed as he watched her go. He needed to talk with the other professors to see if they were having similar issues with her, but most of all, he needed to speak with Malfoy, her head of house.
Malfoy crossed his arms tightly and looked away from Harry and toward the fireplace. The glow of the firelight softened the harsh lines of his face, giving way to a more gentle countenance. His ears were flushed pink, matched only by two similar spots of color high on his cheekbones. If Harry was less angry in this moment, he might have even gone so far as to say Malfoy looked delicate and ethereal, like some sort of porcelain doll.
“I just mean...well, it’s been kind of obvious you’ve had a thing for him since he’s been here, is all,” Ron said carefully.
“What?” asked Harry.
“If you’re certain, dear. Then head on back to your rooms.”
The other man’s face flushed a pretty shade of pale pink, and he tried to bury his head in his pillow. Harry let out a bright laugh. Draco was oddly shy sometimes, and he found it endeared him even more to the man. “Come on, the sooner you get up, the sooner we can give Amara her gift and see her reaction. I know how anxious you’ve been about the whole thing.”
The other man frowned and turned away. “Oh, come off it. I may be a bad person but I’m not an idiot, Harry. It can’t be a coincidence that you start running away from me like I’m some sort of...sort of
“Do you know,” Harry said so softly he could barely be heard over the sound of the fire, “that sometimes I wish I could resurrect Voldemort, just so that I can kill him again, and this time make it a torturously slow and drawn out process?”
“Yes, well, I gathered,” said Harry, still feeling rather uncharitable.
“From you, that’s a compliment.”
“Except you kind of do,” Harry pointed out. “You seem to think you’re not worthy of even speaking to me, which is just a load of rubbish.” He ran a frustrated hand through his curls. “Look, you say you’re tainted. And maybe you are. But I think we’re all tainted, in our own distinct ways. I think you ought to seek forgiveness, and I think that you’re deserving of it. You aren’t the same person you were a decade ago, Draco. Neither of us are, truthfully.”
“I’m a wizard, I’ll use a warming charm. It’ll be fine,” Draco sniffed. “Come on then, haven’t got all night, have we?”
“It’s Malfoy. Draco Malfoy,” he finally said.
His mind flashed back to the feast, and the way Malfoy had spoken to him. How surprised he’d been to even have Harry start a conversation with him, how cool his response had been to what Harry had said, how he’d left the feast early giving an excuse that was, ultimately, obviously not the real reason he had left.
A careful pause, and then: “You’re allowed to be angry, Harry. You’re allowed to be selfish, sometimes. You don’t have to be perfect, you know.”
“I’m the last person who would say be gentle with Malfoy, of all people,” began Ron, “but that was probably a bit of a shock to the system, you know what I mean? He’s probably in his room having a crisis over his very existence right now.”
They continued writing late night letters to each other, letters Harry found himself starting to treasure. And they still, of course, bickered with one another. Harry didn’t think they’d be, well, Draco and Harry, if they stopped. But there was no venom in their tone when they did - not there had been any for awhile now.
However, this time he was prepared. “Miss Zinke, if I could have a word with you at the end of class, please?” The poor thing looked frightened as a mouse, but she nodded her assent. He smiled at her gently, trying to reassure her, but if anything she grew to look more scared. Harry stopped to wonder for a moment if he was really that intimidating of a teacher, but surely he’d have been told by one of the other professors if he were, wouldn’t he? Perhaps he’d ask around, just to check.
“Oh, Amara,” Harry sighed. “Just because I lost my parents doesn’t mean you can’t complain about yours. My best friends complain about theirs all the time and I don’t mind. If you feel comfortable, you can tell me what’s going on with you and yours.” He finished filling her bowl with soup and set it down in front of her.
It’s not like this was something that kept Harry up late at night. Or like he was concerned over this. Or like when he wandered the halls late at night when he couldn’t sleep, which was often - because, well, he’d never been able to sleep well and adulthood and the end of a war hadn’t changed much on that front. It’s not like this was on the forefront of his mind.
“Why does he matter so much to you?”
“It’s Malfoy. Being a prat is basically built into his genes. And besides, there are more important questions at hand here.” Ron’s tone shifted to something more serious, causing Harry to pause.
“Who’s her head of house?” Hermione asked.
He knew she was talking about Malfoy, but thought it best to leave that knowledge a secret. “Glad to hear you’ve been talking to someone else about this, Amara,” he said, meaningfully. “Can I ask you a question, though?”
He entered the Great Hall for breakfast, skin buzzing, and took his seat next to Malfoy. He added food to his plate, heaping it on mindlessly. And then he just stared at it, not eating. He simply pushed the food around on his plate with a fork. He wondered idly what his parents would have done on Halloween. He wondered who cooked more - his mother, or his father? He wondered if they took turns, or if they traded household duties.
Ron shrugged at Harry. “I dunno. Maybe just...leave him alone? If he wasn’t interested in talking to you to begin with, and he left early...maybe it’s a blessing in disguise for you? You won’t have to worry so much about what Malfoy might be up to if he doesn’t want much to do with you, now will you?”
Malfoy sighed. “One thing you must know about me, Potter, is that I am in no uncertain terms, a coward. You know this already, you’ve seen it firsthand when we were in school, and during the War. You offered me a chance to build something better of myself when you spoke for me at the trials, and I’ve done my best. But I also ran from my past, fled to France where I thought I could better hide who I was, or who I fundamentally am. Being around you reminds me that I can’t, that for all I’ve done and may do, I’m forever tainted. And frankly, knowing what you do about me, I’m not sure why you’d ever want to know me.” He traced mindless patterns with his finger on the tabletop. “Running from you when all you’ve done is try to reach out is...cowardly, yes, but that’s just who I am.” He sounded resigned, like he’d consigned himself to this idea for eternity.
“And how many of those years did you spend hating each other? And trying to make each other’s lives a living hell? How many times did you both succeed at it, too?” Ron pointed out. “Besides, you’re the saviour of the wizarding world and he almost ended up in Azkaban, if not for, again, you. Bound to be some odd feelings there.”
There was a pause and then Draco ran up to Harry and yanked on his cloak, pulling him into a ferocious kiss. His lips were cold as ice but Harry’s body felt as if it were on fire. He wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist and pulled him closer, such that their chests were flush against one another. They pulled apart for air and then Draco dove back in, busying himself by peppering Harry’s forehead, nose, cheeks, and jaw with kisses. Each spot Draco kissed felt alive with searing heat.
“You’re such a prat,” said Harry.
Malfoy’s eyes snapped open in annoyance. “Get over yourself, Potter.”
“Yes, but you’re not like that
“Yes. Well, no.” She shook her head and her curls bounced. “If you think there’s something missing from your relationship with him, there probably is. But you know yourself better than I do - you’re the only one that has the answers to those questions, really. Even if I have my own suspicions.”
Amara made her way up to Harry’s desk and stopped. “You...you asked to see me, Professor Potter?” She fidgeted with her hands, nervously pulling at the loose threads on one of the sleeves of her robes.
“Itsdracomalfoy,” said Harry, in a rush.
“Bit surprised to see you here.”
For a long time, the only sound to be heard in the room was that of the crackling fire. The silence seemed to stretch between them, and Harry wanted desperately to close the gap.
He first stopped by the kitchens to grab a spot of dinner, since he was functioning under the assumption that the other man had yet to eat. Looking for Draco, he checked the staffroom first, with no luck.Then he found his way to Draco’s apartments, which were dark and empty. Having struck out twice, and with no idea where to go, he let himself wander around. Maybe his idle wanderings would lead him to Draco, and maybe they wouldn’t.
“It looks like you have company. I ought to let you go then, Harry. But think about what I said, alright?” Hermione asked, giving him a meaningful look.
“No, I have these things called eyes, and another thing most humans have called peripheral vision. I know you’re quite dense so you may never have heard of them before.”
Draco jumped back, startled. “I never said that,” he said, in an attempt to save face. “I simply said I wasn’t feeling well.”
McGonagall ended her speech and sat down, and the golden plateware began to overflow with food. Now that the opportunity was there, Harry wrestled with whether or not to say anything to Malfoy, but he wasn’t sure what to say. Ron would have known what to do, but Ron wasn’t here, forcing Harry to rely on his own, admittedly terrible, social skills.
“Except you kind of do,” said Draco, echoing Harry. “You seem to think your sole function is to exist as an object to serve others before yourself, and you seem to forget that it’s okay for you to be human. Merlin knows if anyone’s earned that right, it’s you.”
It was ironic, really, the way Harry was now behaving. It’s like his position with Draco had flipped. He avoided taking his meals in the Great Hall, stopping to pick up food in the kitchens, so that he didn’t have to sit next to Draco. He still wandered the castle at night sometimes, but he forced himself away from the staff room and from the Astronomy Tower. If he caught sight of Draco in the halls he turned the corner and ran. He took the letters that arrived from Xue, and left them unopened, without giving a response. They piled up in a stack next to his bedside.
“Thank you, Professor,” she said. Her tone belied a quiet sort of pride in herself. It was moments like this that were really demonstrative of why Harry had chosen to teach. It filled Harry himself with his own sense of pride.
With the way Malfoy was avoiding him, however, he doubted he ever would. Which of course, didn’t matter to Harry in the slightest. He didn’t need to know anything about Malfoy.
“It rarely snowed at Beauxbatons, you know,” said Draco. He reached a hand out the window, collecting some snowflakes in the palm of his hand. “I’d almost forgotten what snowflakes look like. Look at how beautiful they are.”
Harry felt his skin begin to prickle, discomfited by the whole situation. Hogwarts was his home, where he was always on sure footing - but with Malfoy here now, the ground had shifted underneath him and rearranged into new, unfamiliar territory.
“What do you mean, ‘that’s it’?” Harry was incredulous. Surely Ron would be more shocked by this revelation. The force of it had nearly knocked Harry to the ground.
“That’s supposed to be the part where you say ‘Thanks, Harry, I feel exactly the same way.’”
Malfoy’s entire body immediately stiffened, and he went dead silent.
“Amara, chin up now. There’s nothing to be ashamed of. Merlin was a Slytherin. Severus Snape, one of the bravest fighters in the last war, was the Slytherin head of house at one point. And I’ll tell you something else,” he leaned forward and whispered conspiratorially. “I was almost placed into Slytherin myself. I promise it’s a good place to be. Don’t listen to what nonsense or silly things others have been saying about it.” He thumbed away the tears falling from her eyes and stood up, and gave Amara a gentle nudge in the direction of the Slytherin table.
“...Fine,” Harry acquiesced.
, Professor.”
If he entered the staffroom while Malfoy was there, the man would promptly end whatever he was doing and leave. Even if it meant leaving a confused fellow professor halfway through a conversation.
“Harry,” said an exasperated Hermione.
“Yeah, well, there’s no harm in trying, is there mate?” Ron pointed out.
Right?
“Oh, really? Who was it, then?” he asked, curious in spite of himself.
And all that indeed.
“Like...what, Ron?” he asked tentatively.
“I won’t push you to. But I want you to know that I’m here if you need an ear. I know you can do better, Amara, and I think you know you can too. Now go on, wouldn’t want you to be late to your next class.”
Harry could feel eyes on the back of his head, coming from the direction of the staff table. He turned, curious, and saw Malfoy staring at him inquisitively. But the other man quickly looked away as Harry returned his stare.
For the first time since he’d known her, she gave him a bright smile, looking less like a wilted plant and more like a blooming flower for once. It made his heart feel warm at the sight of it. She nodded again, and then hurried off. As she left, any residual energy Harry had in his body sapped itself from him. He could bring the tray back to the kitchens now, or he could toss himself into a bed that looked incredibly, incredibly inviting. The only danger lay in the fact that he knew sleep tonight would only bring nightmares, but he was so tired. There was the option of forcing himself to stay awake through the night, which he did for some years, but in this instance it felt like it would be a losing battle.
Harry wasn’t sure why that stung, but it did.
Looking over at him, Draco let out a sigh and sort of...awkwardly shuffled over to Harry, and wrapped him in his cloak. Harry eyed him, and watched as his face began to flush red. “Not a word, Harry,” he grit out.
Instead of answering, Malfoy simply pursed his lips and turned back to the book he was reading. That just irritated Harry more. He wanted to break something, to start a fight, to scream. But he couldn’t. He felt his ears begin to buzz.
Much to his surprise, he did not have to wait long. Harriet returned, with a new letter attached to her foot. He fed her a treat and untied the letter. It read:
“Which I am.”
The other man hugged himself tightly, his whole body curling inward on itself. “I mean...you’re different. You’re bound to be all forgiveness and goodness and saviour-y, because it’s, you know, you.”
Harry clutched his chest in mock-offence, and toppled over onto the floor. “My heart has never known such pain.”
And it’s not that Harry really minded Malfoy being a professor, if he had the qualifications for it. It was just that he felt like he deserved to know, to prepare himself beforehand.
“Oh! That makes sense,” said Hermione, at the exact same time.
“Then just...think about why that is. What makes him different from Ron and I? That’s what you need to ask yourself.”
Harry took off his glasses and began to wipe them clean. “So,” he said tentatively, “does this mean you’re going to start talking to me during the day now, or do I still have to resort to communicating to you through letters where you insult me for no reason?”
“There isn’t enough room in the world for two Hermiones, and she wouldn’t let there be anyway,” said Ron, lovingly.
“Er, ‘Mione?”
? Why? So he can run away from me again, and never speak to me? I don’t think so, Ron.”
Harry turned his gaze toward the lake. Snow was falling in fast flakes, coating the ice on the surface of the lake. He stayed silent for another moment, thinking. He’d hurt Draco, already. Made him think he wasn’t wanted, made him spiral over being a bad person when he was far from it. Perhaps it wasn’t right for him to hold back any longer, even if it meant losing Draco. Maybe that was okay.
“Oh, it’s just Draco,” Harry said with a wave of his hand.
A pause and then: “And he calls you Harry?”
Normally he could make it through the day. Most years on Halloween, he’d be more irritated than normal, and he’d be especially restless at night, and yes, there would be a return of some of his more choice nightmares, but he could make it through. This one was not one of them though.
He hadn’t really been expecting a response to his initial letter, and the response he had received was also not what he had prepared himself for. In the letters, it was the Malfoy that Harry knew, or used to know. And he wasn’t really sure he understood why Malfoy had decided to avoid him in real life, but treat him as though their letters hadn’t changed anything. The worst part about it? Harry wasn’t so sure he even minded. In fact, part of him preferred Letter Malfoy to Real Life Malfoy. If only he could figure out a way to get Letter Malfoy to translate over into Real Life Malfoy. But Malfoy, as he always was, remained a conundrum that Harry couldn’t parse how to fix.
Harry let out a frustrated grunt and fell flat on his face onto the carpet.
Harry spent the next few hours like that, walking down every hall, exploring every nook and cranny of the castle, in search of the man who had so mysteriously vanished for some reason. Eventually, something drew him toward the Astronomy Tower, and he climbed the steps. He found Draco leaning against the windowsill, looking up at the stars.
“I’ll leave you to it then, yeah?”
“That’s wonderful, Harry. I know you were fretting over her for a while, but it looks like things have smoothed out. Do you think she’ll keep it up then?”
“I mean...I comforted a girl who was placed into Slytherin, since the poor thing looked like she was about to cry in front of the whole school. And he asked me what I said, so I told him, and then he stared at me and sort of...left the feast early? He said it was because he had to prepare for the start of term but, well, it didn’t feel like that was the real reason…” Harry trailed off, unsure.
“I’m not lying!” Harry cried out, indignant.
“I’ll pretend like I didn’t hear that.”
He knew that was a lie as well.
She tucked a lock of hair behind her ear, and bit her lip uncertainly. “Um, well. They asked me not to say, so I really can’t. I’m sorry, Professor.”
“Hmm,” was all Hermione said. She gave Harry a look, and raised her eyebrow. “That’s interesting, Harry.”
He shook his head to clear it of those thoughts and returned his attention to the task at hand. Harry had a class of first-years to teach, and he wasn’t going to let his mind’s idle wanderings distract himself from that.
