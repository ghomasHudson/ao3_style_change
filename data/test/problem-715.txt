He clutched onto Potter’s blankets, his breaths coming out as silent pleas for him. He couldn’t breathe. His lungs filled beyond capacity, and forcing themselves to hold. Feeling the tension build, and the walls begin to collapse. Closing in upon his quivering self.
"Potter," he spoke to no one in paticular despite the fact that Potter himself was sitting beside him.
He tries the door next, snarling when it didn’t budge open. The silence thunders, warning Draco of what was to come. Each passing second, ticking away like a time-bomb, and he waits. Waits for someone to come around the corner to attack him from behind or for someone to open the door before him.
"I'll be going, and when I come back you better have all your shit together. It honestly isn't this hard to have to take a stupid damned potion, and go to sleep. I'm starting to think your doing this to just get attention. I'm living the potion by the bedside, so take it. I have better things to do then waste my time,
Draco did not look forward to seeing Potter again, but it seemed it was all he could do to get rid of this agony, that seemed to be running through his very veins. Sometimes, he wondered if he’d been born with it. As though it's always been there, only he was noticing it now. And oh how it
It’s loud...his heart thundering against his chest, deciding if it’s worth begging them to let him talk to Draco one last time before they skin him alive, or if he should spare Draco the pain of watching him die.
Draco gave her a disbelieving look. Did they not know that they were in the middle of a fucking apocalypse..and usually that means needing food to survive. “We needed food?” he answered confused.
He stood abruptly, scowling when he accidentally stepped on his bad foot and grabbed the broom that lay beside the tree trunk.
“You stalked us for miles, and were going to steal our supplies. Pretty sure that’s more than enough reason.”
Draco almost let out a gasp, but before he could determine what exactly it was underneath the concealer, his captor turned around facing away from him.
He yelped, feeling himself being lifted, and placed upwards on the bed, Potter still holding him tight and snug against his chest. "I'm sorry." The words sincere, and filled with a torrents of guilt.
Draco swallowed. Five years sounded a lot, and without joining a pocket its near to impossible. “You tell me. You survived didn’t you?”
Harry pauses, freezing up, and turning to Draco with a sharp snap of the neck. “They?” he asks suspiciously, and Draco wants to be laugh at his pitiful state.
Draco feared the thought of being forgotten. It kept him up all night, wondering if tonight would be his last. It was a scary thought. Knowing that these stone walls might be the last thing you see before you go, or maybe the open jaws of an unfortunate as it came down on you.
Harry looked back at the Slytherin table and this time took his time to actually look at the distinct features on the the blonde's face. Malfoy looked rather horrible compared to his usual self. His eyelids drooped, hair unkept bare of it'd usual gel and even though Harry couldn't see the bags underneath his eyes, he could
Dumbledore took his arm of the other and grabbed the bottle of good ol' muggle beer that lay on the shelf.
Draco groaned in frustration and turned yet again. When his final attempt failed as well, Draco sat up on the bed, pushed his head in his hands and shook. He wasn't sure whether it was just anger or frustration or straight out annoyance. Maybe it was all three. It was probably all three.
The raven’s hand shot out, and Draco scrambled back flinching away from the calloused hand. Harry froze for a moment, before reaching behind his waist, pulling him close. For a moment Draco though he was hugging him, but when the weight on his hands fell, and the chains fell to the ground, Draco changed his mind. Harry was taking his chains off. They fell one my ne, clattering to ground. The rustling of the chains louder than that of the unfortunates.
Ahh. So here it is! The new update! I tried to write a scene with Draco having a panic attack, and I apologize if that is not how Panic attacks are like. I've never experienced one, so I can never know what they are exactly like. I was simply using accounts of experiences written by other people on the internet, so if you find something that is a little off, or not right, please tell me. I'll try my best to fix it.
For now, he stands, feeling the pain tingle through his broken body, and he the smallest bit alive. The pain a reminder that he is still breathing and feeling.
Blaise wants to laugh at the irony of it all. Getting killed didn’t sound so bad, but he supposed he could hold on for a little while longer. Maybe Draco could be right. Maybe they’ll escape...find way out the walls.
It wasn’t a complete lie, but they haven’t had a full complete hideout in months. The last one still secure, but back on north. It was far and it was safer to try their chances here than to try and trech on back up north.
Maybe, if it wasn't for what had happened to Pansy, he would've been the one to do it, but that wasn't the case. Two years ago, his best friend broke, and glued herself back together colder than ever.
He tried to kill someone, again!!! And this time he'd almost gone through with it. Not that he didn't
“You called me your friend,” Harry blinks, a small hint of shock mixed in with that same mischievous tendencies he’d seen for the past few years.
Draco wanted to laugh at the obvious lie. It wouldn’t just pinch, it would burn. And burn it did. He screamed. Trashed, and tried to curl up in his own body, snarling when Potter kept him pinned to the bed with his left arm. “LET GO!!! STOP!
Another hit. “This is no time for games, Blondie. You either answer the question, or next time, it’ll be your friend that gets it.”
Only Draco knows where the cure is hidden. He knows he can’t let it fall into the hands of the Third Eye. They’d use it for absolute power, to create a world in shackles.
The freak leaped onto him, and he punched it in a desperate attempt to get it off. Her mouth snapped open, coming down to him. Draco closed his eyes. He didn’t want to die. He didn’t.
Draco yelled, voice cracking and rasping, but he continued nonetheless. “And judging by the way you guys are reacting to this...you’re probably new to this city, aren’t you?”
Fear pulsed through his veins as an unfortunate shrieked at his awakening and reached out to him. The unfortunate stopped a little more than a meter away, chained to another pole in this dungeon-like room.
Blaise sneered, grabbing his by his arm hard enough to bruise. “We stay here and The Third Eye will kill them all.”
They walked in silence through the dark, musky hallways. Stone floor, and stone walls, stone pillars. Stone. Stone. Stone. The same old cold samp stone receding all the way down the dimly lit hall. Water dripped from the dies, falling onto the group in platters. Sometimes, Draco wondered if it really was water...and not the blood of those that were now long gone.
Running away without shoes was suicide, and it ensured his captivity without all the ropes and shackles.
“Oh quit being sarcastic, it isn’t that bad,” the raven muttered, running a hand through his hair, and Draco peeked closer to his forehead, wanting to confirm whether or not his suspicions were true. And just like that, the raven removed his hand, allowing his hair to fall onto his forehead in wisps. “Better than out there.”
His control was dancing on a thin line, ready to tip over with one small push, and surprisingly enough, he was almost daring Malfoy to go on.
Draco felt a surge of anger, frustration rush through him. What do they know? What have they ever known?! Sure, they blame him for being prejudice, moving racist views, but how little they realized that they were just the same as him. They were cruel, mean, mocking, like him. Beat him up, just as much as he beat them up, so how dare they? How dare they put all the blame on him, as though it were all his fault.
They seemed to be having the same effect these days. Gave his heart the same amount of happiness and joy.
The door slammed open, and Draco snapped up with wide wet eyes. Light came creeping in as the unfortunates turned their attention from him to the man before them. They were louder than ever now, clawing at each other, and screeching as though trying to communicate. Draco almost smiled at the silhouette of a man standing at the doorway.
Draco didn’t allow the other to finish. Instead, he let his trembling hand go limp, the blade slipping from his fingertips, and clattering onto the hardwood floor.
Draco kept his gaze away from Potter’s emerald eyes. “I’m not lying,” he tried, voice coming out more broken than convincing.
Something he handed felt in a long time. Not since evil had come knocking on his door, taking its place within his home. If he could even call it home.
Draco doesn’t even know why he’s angry. It’s irrational, and he knows he should probably stop, but– “Geez,
The raven tilts his head amused, and Draco finds himself staring at the foundation that had been hidden behind his unruly hair just a moment earlier. It’s no mistake. Draco can make out the faint outline of a lightning shaped scar hidden away by the foundation.
Draco bolted. Sprinting past the hall, and back to the room where he first came from. He was close, so close to leaping out from the bedroom window, but something slammed into him, knocking him over. Draco kicked at the body, and swinging his bat wildly at the man. Black hair, and green eyes. Breathtaking and
The boy infront of him froze. His skin turned a deadly pale, as the blood rushed away from his face. The moment of shock didn't last lont as a wild look overcomed Potter. His eyes became feral, and the boy snarled, baring his teeth ready to attack and strike.
Draco bit his lip nervously, before noticing the small twitch of the other’s lips. “Wait–” he started, eyeing the large pile of mud and uck in the other’s hands. “Potter...” he warned, taking a step back.
His fingers tremble, clinging desperately to the cup of water they had gifted him with, and he didn’t to waste a single drop of the pure nectar. He took another sip, feeling the cool slide down past his crackling throat like honey. It was oddly sweet. He wonders if it’s just his thirst or if they had added something to the water.
“Or what? Gonna go cry back to your mommy and Daddy?” the blonde sneered weakly, before putting his hand up to his chest in a mocking gasp. “Oh! Silly me, I forgot. Poor Mommy and Daddy died.
A strangled groan broke Harry out of his trance and he looked down to see Malfoy shutting his eyes tighter and snuggling more towards his body. He quickly broke away, and stood abruptly, pushing Malfoy away roughly. He looking down at the figure below him, as it whined and groaned even more. The blood, he could see now, was pooling up underneath his head, and staining Malfoy's dove white shirt into a rich, dark shade of crimson. Harry winced a little at the sight and cringed his nose in pity.
Sooner or later Malfoy fell on his face like a flopping penguin, but this time his body didn't rise back up the snow.
.” he started, swiping a tongue over his lips. “If I could stay over for the winter break this year. I mean...it might be my last year here, and you know with all these people I’ve come to
Anyways, I hope you like this chapter! I'm not he best with writing romantic scenes, but I tried. Enjoy!
” Draco attempted. Potter paused for a moment, looking over to him. “Look..w-we all make mistakes, okay? And it’s not like I haven't been a sore arse to you all these years. I’m not angry.
This could be the last time he’d see it. The last time he would feel the warmth of the sun on his skin, or the bitter rouch of snow. The wind brushing through his hair. The memory of his Lily’s blinding smile. The pair of emerald eyes he’d grown to love all too much. The memory of Molly’s cooking...Mr. Weasley’s old childhood stories, which he was sure were being exaggerated but interesting all the same. Granger scolding the pair. Even Weasley’s fucking hand me down. The ones he was wearing right now. He remembered it all, and he wished he would die remembering them.
Potter put a hand on his chest gaping at what Draco had just said, and gasped dramatically. “HOW DARE YOU!?!?” Draco merely shrugged. “By the way...how do you know what Diabetes is? Isn’t that a
“Traitor? Is that what I am now? Oh, how forgetful you’ve become, father. Do you not remember the name of your
'It wasn't fair. No one,' his eyes wandered up to the pale face. '..No one so cruel and vile should be able to look so...so pure. Almost...
“There you are!” a panting voice comes chirping in from his left. Draco whips his head to meet a set of emerald eyes, and a smile. Something Draco hadn’t seen in awhile. “Of thank fuck, I was afraid you might have gone down the wrong way or run into some unfortunate. Ah that’d be the worst, I mean, you don't even have a weapon–”
Only thing, he was afraid. Scared shitless as his eyes widened in realization After all, it was like Theo had always said,
Draco had been wrong. It wasn’t Potter who was blind and Foolish. It was him. He’d been a fool to think that the one man that he had tormented for years would feel any sort of sympathy for him. That he could possibly even begin to understand him. The more Draco lingered on it, he realized that he, too, didn’t even begin to understand Potter. He had hated Potter for really no reason. He’d bullied his friend every day, called him names, spouted insults that only someone as spiteful as him could say. He was a complete arse, and nothing he could say would change that. Nothing that would justify what he did.
He lets out a chuckle, and lets his body drop onto the forest floor, chest rumbling with laughter. His vision blurs as tears began to pour from his eyes, wetting his cheeks, and watering the grass below.
The man scavenges through the bag, filling, pulling out a few water bottles and a scarf. Nothing. He motions to the followers behind him, and they begin to reach in to the body’s pockets, searching...and as the hand pull out, holding a folded paper, the man lets his lips curve.
Draco blinked in realization, before turning back to Pansy’s adorable cute, but annoying pug face. She was right...she was so right. He was in too deep.
," Draco found himself saying, hands trembling, eyes stinging,  threatening to let free the river of tears that he'd pooled up in there, and breathing heavy.
Thank you again for being patient, and having to put up with my lazy schedule. You guys all have a great day or night...if it's night. Expect an update by next week. Until next time,
“I’d rather not,” he stated, getting straight to the point. The silence that followed after was much like the dark stare that Potter had given him earlier, and it was deafening. The air around him wavered again, and what felt like a bucket of cold water was dumped upon his head. He gasped at the cold leaching through his clothes, wetting the fabric. Anger bubbled up his chest and he turned around to hex whoever it was that had dumped ice cold water on him to next week.
Draco gasped, when he felt the unfortunate fall onto his body limp. He could feel its teeth grazing his shoulder, but not biting. Still....and unmoving.
used to be his captive. Cut open and rewired over and over and over again, until they became stronger than any human before them.
A woman...who would’ve been no older than his mother came charging at him. Her feet moving with an odd limp. Foot twisted behind her, with the bone jutting out from where her ankle should have been. She shrieked, no doubt trying to attract the attention of other unfortunates. Draco swallowed the bile back down, and didn’t waste time in swinging his bat once more. Her guts spilling out from the bite marks from her stomach as she fell, and scrambled for him.
And as the final specks of sunlight crossed over the horizon, she pulled the trigger, fading away into nothing.
New chapter!! I know it's kinda late...very late, and I apologize for that. I thought I had updated this...but I hadn't so yeah...Hope you guys liked this chapter? Also..if you guys don't understand anything, just ask below in the comments. I'll be more than happy to clear it up.
Draco winced again. "Blaise? I'm running on 3 cups of coffee and havnt slept in the last 4 days. Now I can feel Pansy talking. Please....kill me."
Something broke within the other boy, and Draco knew he'd gone too far. He knew it was coming. The air had gotten unbearably thicker, making Draco's breathing short and hard. And yet the smiled remained, plastered onto his face.
is. But Draco knew that no matter how much Madame Pomfrey thought he was lying, there is no way she'd send someone who has claimed to almost be killed with the declared killer. "He..He tried to-"
He let out a small smile, as Lily giggled stuffing her face with a fork-full of chicken, practically mimicking Weasley’s actions from across the table. They were in complete sync, stuffing their faces with as much food as they could, and then gobbling it down with a gulp of pumpkin juice. From the corner of his eye he could see Granger scoldinging them.
“Don’t call me that!” Harry growled. Weaker maybe, but it seemed that the bullying antics had never really left. Old habits really do die hard.
Before he knew it, he was standing in front of the invisible barrier, where his footsteps stopped. The night with Potter, he’d stuck to tracking his steps along the house just as a way of knowing he was really here.
Molly quickly nods, and put a her arms around the boy's frail body, ready to pick him up, but he shakes his head and then moves out of her hold. He lifts his arms and raises the bundle, as if to tell her to take it.
Draco flinched at the name, and glared. He tried not to show his hurt, his disgust in knowing that Potter was right. Knowing that he would
Malfoy only responded by another stir of his head and groaning a little before snuggling closer into Harry's chest. Oh, if only Malfoy was awake and aware of what he was doing. He'd throw a fit.
“Blondie here persists on lying,” Granger rambled out, more polite, but Draco could still taste the poison in her words. Oh, how he wanted to lick it all up, swallow it till it turns him into nothing but a shell of his own body. It was would be easier. So much easier. But he’d made a promise...they’d all made a promise.
Up close, she can make out the distinct features of the newcomer. Short blonde hair, a few strands brushing the front of his forehead in wisps, and a scar running across the bridge of his nose. He turns to look at Harry, who stood smiling sheepishly, excited to have met someone new.
“Why’s that?” Draco asked more teasingly than serious, but the redhead went on. He truly hadn’t expected his question to be answered. It was not usual of kidnappers to tell their captives of their plans, or answer their questions and yet here they were.
That made Potter crack up, his frown splitting into a half smile. “Nope. My turn to ask questions,” he began, expression going grim again. God, his moods change so fast. “Was it you?”
Maybe...maybe then they could trust them enough to stay. To stay and never look back from the road they came from.
New chapter! It's a really short chapter, but I tried my best to update as soon as possible. I promise to make the next one longer. Hope you guys like it!
Gods, he didn’t want to go back this winter. Not at all. Not back to where Mr.Noseless, and Ms.IwantNoselessToNoticeMe.
The raven pulled up a stool next to him, sitting down, and leaning a fist on his cheek. Draco slumped his head down in defeat. He’d be honest...for now. If it kept them alive, then so be it.
” contact with people other than Blaise, Pansy, and Theo in a long time. He wasn’t exactly on par with his “
Malfoy in the process. So why was it that the blonde was only getting more and more wearier. His skin pale, and almost sick looking even through the glamour. Hands were shaking, and his posture less...
“I asked first!” Hermione complained, placing the feather back down on the table, careful to keep it away from the parchment.
make a run for it. Avoid getting into detention altogether. Oh who was she kidding? Backing out on Harry like that? No...she couldn't.
Draco winced a little with the tone of her harshness. It was true. They really did have no reason to help him or rather keep them here. Not with the way he'd treated them. He felt his anger, that had been peaking it's way up, now drooping.
Madame Pomfrey who seemingly noticed turned to Harry and smiled. "I must thank you, Harry. You did a great job on keeping Draco calmed and controlled. I was right to leave you incharge."
He pressed his face farther into the bark, not getting much farther away. He attempted to bite the Death Eater rather than bothering to answer. His teeth snapped onto empty air as the masked man took a step back.
The pain doesn’t come...instead he feels the pressure from is wrist slip as the ropes fall one by one to the ground. He snaps his eyes open, looking up at his captor in shock. He doesn’t understand.
Draco looked up at the ceiling, feeling just about as empty as it looked. “I think we both knew that it was an obvious lie.”
Dumbledore, however, pretends to not hear the others words at all. He puts his hands together in delight and spins around in his chair squeeling.
Maybe he should have Madame Pomfrey look over him again. Look for some other reason or problem that might be causing this
Harry could now feel the warm blood seeping through his shirt and clinging onto his body. A pang of guilt hit Harry again.
He clenches his eyes, waiting for the brunet to step closer, waiting for the perfect moment to attack. Just one step closer an–
I know this chapter is late, but I'm moving and that's taking up a lot of my time, and I haven't been able to write as much. I hope this chapter makes up for it, and I also hope it gives some insight into Draco's past.
The hand on his jaw squeezed and Draco returned his gaze back to the raven’s eyes. “Good. Now...we’ll leave your friend alone, but you’ve got to give us a few honest answers here, ok?”
"Don't bloody tell me what to do!! I'll do whatever I want to do!" He snapped, narrowing his eyes and glaring at the raven. Potter on the other hand, only smiled.
He remembers hearing the squelching sounds of the teeth sinking into their victim, remembers hearing the sickening crack of his mother’s skull. And he remembers so much...knows what a coward he was to run. To walk away and refuse to spare a few of his only bullets to put them out of their misery.
The sound of weeping cut her off. She looks down and Malfoy now has his head cradled in the bundle that he held. His body shook with violent tremors and sobs. Choking. Not crying, but trying to. As if all that he could produce were dry tears. The boy held the bundle tighter and kissed it?
"He says he needs Malfoy on our side, so he wants me to make draco fall in love with me so I'd convince him to join DA."
The blankets underneath him shifted and Harry raised his head to see Malfoy moving and squirming around in the bed. He took a closer look at the other's face and sighed. Malfoy was waking up.
but gentle woman. So she thought.  The world knew better than to get on her bad side. She would stay home make apple pies. Pick up after the mess her children left. Watch them grow up, only to bid them farewell every year. Oh how she adored them.
It felt like ages. Years, before Potter came back in, holding a ceramic cup, with some sort of paste. A revised version of the Pepper-up potion mixed in with a little bit of Skele-Gro. How did he know?
It’s like every other night, only this time he’s alone. No Blaise waiting by his side, no Pansy tickling his feet...no
Draco doesn’t want to be alone. The mere thought pushing the breath out of him, sending shivers up his spine. The wall is cold and damp against his back, the air far too humid and dense.
Potter raised an eyebrow, and it came back, pressing down on his lungs as though they were nothing. Why did this always happen with Potter? He’d kept it well under control in front of his father, so why couldn’t he just...keep it down now?
Draco furrowed his eyebrows confused, and Harry decided to relieve him of the suspense. “We all started off here, but we’re returning.”
Draco didn’t bother with the stupid foreplay, instead running straight ahead and catching the other by surprise. He pushed the raven, attempting to get him to slip back in the mud pile. However, things don’t always go as planned.
Blaise was saying something...he couldn’t hear. The noises had dulled down in the background, his ears now filled with a light buzz. Exhaustion swept through every cell in his body, and cold sweat dripped down his back.
"So, Draco. Even though I already know what has happened, I'd like to hear it from you myself. How did this happen?"
It wasn’t as though it’d matter either way. Draco already knew the outcome. There was no way he would be able to kill a wizard who’s had more than a hundred years of experience ahead of him. Did he mention the old man was also supposedly one of the most powerful wizard aside from the Dark Lord and all those other old grumpy old bearded men that always greeted you with a long warm creepy ass smile that Draco absolutely despised.
The raven stuttered, face heating up the tiniest bit. “That’s not it!! You’re like..two feet away from us. You can’t exactly have a private conversation even if you wanted to!”
“What?” he snapped, looking around to make sure no one was around to listen into their conversation. Harry had taken him to meet Blaise who had been sitting in a clearing near the tents. They weren’t far from everyone else, but close enough to be caught running away. Not to mention, they had taken his shoes again.
It wasn’t fair. Rather...it was cruel. He’d been in this city for five years, and in five years, he had never seen anything like this. Never seen such an unorganized group of children, laughing and enjoying their asses off as thought he apocalypse had ever hit. As though there weren’t flesh thirsty monsters just outside these metal walls.
A carousel of broken bottles and dreams spinning round and round. A never ending cycle, but peace comes eventually. Surely, it must. Eventually, with all those shards piercing the soles of his bare feet, eventually, he shouldn’t feel anything at all.
” he yelled in a hushed whisper, the fear of alerting such a creature gnawing at his bones. “Are you fucking crazy?!”
The raven sniffled quietly as his tears rolled down his cheeks in thick beads. His lip quivered, and the white around that ugly green turning a violent red. “I-I didn’t mean to–”
His ‘father’ waved a hand to the side, motioning the other cloaked figure up ahead. They raised their wands up at him, all beginning to glow an pretty crimson. It was ironic. How a spell used to hurt so many could look unbearably beautiful. “What this, Mr. Malfoy? Too much of a fucking
Harry woke up falling off the bed. Dazed, he landed on the floor and groaned a little with the slight throb in his stomach. His attention turned to a shriek coming from atop of the bed.
It had horrified him to see one of his only friends be so broken. To the point of where even meeting someone would send her into hysteria. So how could he? And how
Potter straightened up, and reached out for his wrist, pulling him to the exit of the door. “Hey! Let go of me, Potter!
He wants them to hurt...to make sure he’s not forgotten, so he continues. Screams and yells like the man he’d shot two year ago. Weeps like the child who had gotten mauled and eaten before him, and begs.
Draco yelped and jumped away from the voice. He broke out of his trance and looked at the source of the noise only to come face to face with Potter. His cheeks heated up, turning into a light shade of pink. Draco had just yelped.
She could head the nails being dragged weakly down the door, and then a slump. That's when she heard the croaking voice.
” Blaise snorted, and Draco spared him a weak glare. “Just let us go...we won’t bother your lot again.”
Everything else aside, I hope you guys enjoy!! I know this was supposed to update at like the end of june, but like bear with me. At least I got it done. Love you all~
Malfoy came not too long after he settled down beside the big whomping willow. He looked rather off, almost like plastic. The glamour was back up, but weaker than before It seemed Malfoy was getting weaker...from what? He didn’t know.
of you?” Blaise whispered almost awed by the idea. No one had groups that big anymore. They’d all been infiltrated, and taken over. Some separated...others dead. Mauled until all who ceased to be a part of the group were nothing more than piles of guts, and bones.
Wincing Draco looks up and his eyes glimmer with hope. Molly Weasley. One of the nicest and feistiest woman he'd ever known. His eyes softened and the corner of his lips curved up a little until...
“No.” there is no hesitation in his voice, and Draco can tell this isn't the first time they have done this. “
So sorry for this really really late update! I've been busy with other things and it took me a while to write this one. I'll try to update the next chapter soon. Well anyways, how you guys enjoy it! Tell me what you guys think, and feel free to leave any critics. They are highly appreciated. ヽ(*≧ω≦)ﾉ
"Ok, that's it!" Draco beamed in victory, but it was short-lived. Potter marched towards him, grabbing his arm, and pushing him down on the bed.
His demands were left ignored, as the raven pulled him across the hallway and down to the exit. Potter’s grip on his wrist was tight, as he opened the door, the brisky winter air greeting him almost instantly.
Draco gulped down the bile in his mouth. He coughed as the wetness dribbled down his dry crackling throat like fire burning the thin sheet of crumpled paper. He swallowed again, wincing at the sting that hurt more than the throbbing on the side of his jaw. “I-I told you...they’re all dead,” he rasped.
“You know what Malfoy? You’re right,” came a calm voice, and Draco’s heart fluttered with the tiniest bit of hope. “It’s not nine yet. It’s fucking
His eyes rolled to the back of his head as he fell, the ground rushing up to him. It collapsed upon him with a hard grunt. The pain shooting up his shoulder, and down to the throbbing of his feet.
Harry stayed quiet for a few moments, before running his hand through black unruly hair, and nodding slowly. “Alright...but
He gave Blaise a reluctant nod, and quietly removed the netting from the window, before getting to work on unlocking it. Unlocking the window hadn’t taken long. A couple pulls at the small gaps between the window frame with a couple twists of the notch, and the window slip open with ease. He motioned for Blaise to stay outside and keep watch. Blaise gave a small sarcastic salute, and disappeared around the corner.
They weren’t pretty. Far from. No, it wasn’t a pretty grey. It was a small sheet of ice that covered the grass after a long gruelling summer. A light of sorts. It was the first shade. The last fade.
He just had to go, get what they needed, and then leave. No diddly-dadling, or as Blaise called it ‘exploring.’ That was food, and water. He had no doubt the group residing here was big. Consisting of at least four people. Two men, and two women. Blaise and Draco had followed them in hopes to perhaps finding their base, or some food to steal, and find their base they did.
Draco grimaced inwardly. He didn't even know if the 'safe place' would even take them in. Wait not them. Not him. But they would definetely take Lilly! She's a small girl. They'd take her for sure!
Draco sputtered on his glass of Pumpkin juice. He felt his face heat up, and he scowled at the former raven. “
Draco didn't answer to the innocent voice and mounted on the broom, Lilly still in his arms. He rose slowly, adjusting Lilly's weight so she wouldn't fall.
Draco walked carefully on the concrete floor, fearing his every step for the chance of breaking skin. Getting a cut on your feet was one of the most foolish mistakes one could make in this new world.
“Why do you even care?” Potter asked after a long pause. “I can clearly recall you saying, she was nothing more than another
Potter snapped his eyes up, meeting his eyes. “What caused those panic attacks? I swear I didn’t know what was going on...so I’m sorry for leaving you alone during them..Mione’ told me and Merlin’s sake...I didn’t know,” Potter rambled, before Draco cut him off.
you are doing this!” A part of him still hoped that maybe Potter wanted to help him. A tiny piece buried deep under that ice wished that maybe...just maybe, Potter understood.
It’s not long before they stop, and Draco is greeted to a small gray metal door. It isn’t before Draco notices the big bolt on the door handle, does he move back, but Harry has his wrist in an instant.
“You asshole!” Draco yelled, sending a mud pile hurling his way. The raven raised his arms trying to keep the mud from his face, but failing miserably, as it splattered onto his glasses, and sinking deep into one ear.
“Huh?” Harry looks confused. This was not the man he’d previously met. He acted...different. More bubbly. Expressive? An open book really. Which was the act? “Why not?”
“Quite clever for a Blonde, I must say,” the freckled boy responded, giving a slight shove forward to get him to moving. Draco winced, stepping groggily across the stone floor with his bare feet. Hell, they’d even taken his shoes away just to make sure he wouldn’t escape.
His thoughts linger back to Sarah. His first patient. And back then, hope was something he had clung to desperately. He’d watched her get better, only to find another soulless creature. She was a necessary sacrifice, he’d convinced himself. For the better of humanity.
The raven came sweeping in, moving around the reach of the unfortunates, before finally reaching Draco. Harry stared down on him, with a scowl on his face. That’s when it hit him. This wasn’t his saviour. This was his captor...kidnapper and probably also the one who had put him here.
He was dying...he was going to die. Another sharp tug at his heart, and Draco curled up upon himself. His fingers digging into his arms, harder, and deeper with every coming second.
Draco curses his past self, for having sympathized with these creatures. For helping them when he should’ve known better. He should’ve...and here he is. Captive of the very ones he’d set free. The tables had turned and he wants to laugh at the irony of it all.
Overall, the place was secure. Secure than most places would be, but just like any other hideout, the danger was still imminent. If this base was to be swarmed by Unfortunates then, where would they run? Did they have a exit? An escape route? A second base?
But just as the other was about to leave, Dumbledore swings his arm around the others neck and pulls him back in.
The other stopped startled, but not alarmed. Something that seemed rather odd to Draco. Made him feel as though he was the one losing control of the situation. This...this was
Harry almost sobbed, but something choked him back, tugged at him yet again, and he felt his guts twist a little. Another pull on his thoughts and...
Draco gaped when he heard those words slip out of the boy's mouth. Potter merely turned to face him and smiled '
Draco froze. The hairs on the back of his hair stood up at the mention of his father. He gulped and looked up at the motherly face. Oh, if only she knew, that his father wouldn't be mad about him not taking the potions, but rather having to rely on such weak things
A chuckled emerged from the other boy, ss he crept closer, causing Draco to shift back onto the bed further away from Saint Potter.
you are not going to leave me alone and I'm eventually going to have to answer your questions, so I want something in return. I answer your question, but
Draco gulped. Should he take that risk? Should he tell them...would they really bring Blaise into this? They couldn’t....right? “I’m surprised you know that reference. S-seems like you all are not just stuck up nerds t-that have never watched Lord of the Rings afterall.”
He wonders if it will hurt. He hoped it will be quick and sudden, not give him time to dwell on the moments he’s lived when it is he would die.
His heart clenched, clogging up in his throat, choking his words. Potter was going to leave, and just like all the other times, it would be Draco's fault for pushing him away. For pushing away the one this he'd been longing for.
Draco turned around to the source of the voice and saw a frustrated looking and very much angry Harry Potter coming his way.
So he didn’t blame her. It was human. To be scared and overwhelmed and angry and....and done. She was still human and so he wasn’t angry...not at her at least. He supposed a part of him is human too.
"Again about that dumb weaslette! I didn't do it! Why do you always assume that all the evil done in this school must be tainted with my hands?!"
Draco closes his eyes, the white turning to a warm brown. Heat from candles piercing his skin, and the feeling of a bent knife, with a plastic fork welcoming. Opening his eyes, he’s back at the Weasleys’. He takes a look at his plate.
It wouldn’t surprise him if they’d put him in a cellar. The thing that did surprise him though, was how they managed to secure such a place. It was huge...and securing such a huge place must have meant they had a big group. Groups like that didn’t exists anymore. at least that’s what Draco, Blaise and Pansy liked to think. It was easier to go on with that mindset. Made it easier for them to stay away from larger groups, or as they liked to call it ‘pockets.’
He could already imagine his father's horror. He let out a small chuckle at the thought and Pansy gave him a look. “Can you imagine what father would think?”
Harry frowns, looking down at his hand and blinks a couple times before tilting his head back up to Draco. “But...you’re the one who did this, isn’t this what you wanted?”
"I..okay. Let's just make this clear. I don't plan on staying here. I'll plan on leaving as soon as I meet Lilly and see that she is ok. And as for Lilly. You don't have to worry about her. I can assure you that she is no death eater, and probably won't poison you drinks. Though I can't promise that."
Potter hummed, the awkward silence returning once again. This time longer. The last of the sun’s rays were peeking just barely over the edge. The sky behind his turning black, following a coloured pattern back to the setting sun.
Potter pressed the vial against his lips, and this time he took it willingly. The raven moved out from under him, placing him back onto the bed, and pulling the sheets up his chin.
Her eyes drooped a little with the mention of Harry. Oh the poor boy. Molly was glad Albus had allowed him to stay at hers this winter, rather than making him go back to his aunt and uncle. The pair had hardly fed him enough, and made him work all the time. Molly had seen the damage. It disgusted her to think how someone could be so cruel, but it wasn't like it surprised her. She's seen worse. She's been through the first war, and the memories haunt her still.
Harry's head dropped and his face darkened. Hair fell like wisps over his face and anger radiated from him.
Blaise didn’t seem to hear. He seemed almost lost, as though he could not hear what Draco was saying. “BLAISE!”
fucking years, Blondie. But you did...” his gaze falls back to Draco, studying, trying to find any signs of lying, “...so tell me. How is it you managed five years in this hellhole without being bitten or...
And the more and more he gazed at the two before him the more Blaise’s words seemed true. He should never have doubted his friend’s words. This world was cruel. There was no more ‘nice’ people anymore. He knew that, then why did he still doubt it so much?
The raven turned to leave, and Draco was almost torn in two. Harry was going to leave him...leave him back with the unfortunates. None the matter...as long as Blaise was ok. That was all that mattered. For now, Blaise was everything. “Where’s my friend?”
The other obviously creeped out, slowly got out of his chair and started to tiptoe his way back to the door.
He grins weakly, holding a middle finger to the door, knowing full well the other could not see him. “Fuck you, mullet head!” And with that he sprints down the hall, heading for the second left. He’d mapped out the journey to the little bunker over and over again. Now he only hoped he could somehow find Blaise in all this chaos. If he was lucky, the sun would have long set, but he couldn’t put his faith on luck.
“Please..please...stop...” he muttered, trying to press his face further into the ground, trying to block out the sound. It was horrible, disgusting.
Draco slumps onto the floor, the walls beginning to cave in. He squeezes his fingers together before feeling them peel apart, and it’s suffocating. His lungs constricting and collapsing on himself, every breath feeling like a struggle.
He felt the warmth reel back, and the raven beginning to lean back. Harry let out a small grin, and Draco couldn't bring himself to be angry.
“Draco!” his father's sharp voice came, dragging him back from his thought to the present. “Are you listening?!”
“Blaise,” he finally breathes out, feeling his blood run cold. “We need to get the fuck out from here.”
Ripples flowed along the barrier like waves trashing up against the ocean side. The raven looked disheveled. His glasses missing, and eyes wide with rage. Anger. Dry lips moved, yelling something, he couldn’t hear. Potter’s fist pounded against the invisible wall, bruises forming at a frighteningly fast pace. Skin breaking, and spilling blood.
Potter sighed and for the second time this week proceeded to drag Draco out of the great hall. During times like these are when Draco regrets most of the decisions he makes. Like forgetting his wand in his room. Definetly forgetting his wand in his room. That was the biggest mistake out of all.
Draco looked confused. Was Blaise also going to end up like pansy? "The roof ofcourse...blaise. Why would you ask me that?"
“Move!!” Draco tries as another spell finds its way to Potter’s body. He hits Pooter, smacking his fists against his body in a desperate attempt to get the raven to move. “Move! Y-you’re getting hurt! Move!
“Nope!” Draco hushed him, raising a finger up to the other’s lips to quiet him. “My question first!”
He chuckles softly, shaking his head at such a foolish notion. Of course Blaise would have. He’s been waiting to die for far longer than Draco could imagine. The only thing keeping him going was Draco’s stupid promise. Draco had made them swear. He’d made them promise, given them a false hope he knows he’ll regret later.
Sarah no longer remained, but she left behind a gargling, convulsing child’s body. Draco had never felt more sick. He remembers.
” the masked death eater came up inches away from his face. He could feel the gremly breath escaping the mask from the small slit on the mask.
They...they were running. Running because they were hiding. A betrayal like that would have killed in a way worse than turning into an unfortunate. Back there, turning was more merciful than being caught. So...they were running. Yes, running...but they’d been running or over 2 years now...maybe even longer. He couldn’t tell for sure. He remembers Theo. The first one of their group to be shredded to pieces. He remember Astoria. Their first kiss.
The air around his became heavier and he lifted his head off the ground to look at the very cause of it. Potter. A siege of fear and panic rushed towards him. He'd totally forgotten about Potter!! Who was standing right in front of him.
have a problem. This is a severe case of insomnia, and it won't be solved simply by hoping and wishing it would go away. Eventually things like this are bound to happen and I'd hate to see you injured more from this. What if you'd lost conscious while you where out on your broom? You'd have more than just an injured head! You could die!!"
Draco was proud to say he was winning. He was fucking winning, and he was going to rub it in the champion’s stubborn cocky face. “Guess who’s winning, Potter? That’s right!
Draco flicked his eyes up, pulling the hidden knife out from the strap under his jeans, and swiped at the raven. The other stepped back in surprise, bringing a hand up to keep the hand from his Blade met flesh, and the other winced, as it sliced his hand, blood spilling out from the wound.
Ron frowned and nodded. "I swear, when I find who did it, I'll beat em' to a pulp! I'll bring justice to Ginny! I swear I'll make em pay!"
," Blaise cut in. Finally. They were getting somewhere and Draco figured he'd do something to help his situation as well.
Draco flew down to the ground, trembling slightly as he got off the broom, legs shaky,a and knees buckling slightly, from the pressure. He let out a uncontrollable laugh, as Harry followed, falling onto his arse, mud covering his clothing, and palms.
“Live in a closet?! Don’t kid yourself, Potter!” Draco scoffed disbelieved. “Your the chosen one. You were probably pampered, and spoiled you your entire life. Gods, they must’ve
“Names Hermione,” she said. “The redhead holding ur friend is Ron, and Mr. Grouchy Pants in front of you is Harry.”
The first thing that Draco registers is the noise. And this time it isn’t the deafening silence, but voices and words and music. Laughter echoing across the walls, and Draco gasps. There were...people. Living.
His voice is softer...almost fragile, and Draco notes his own weakness. Don’t get him wrong. He’s trying. Trying to keep up this facade...and be all hard, unbreakable, stainless steel. “Why do you want to know?” Harry asks, and Draco almost wanted to smack him for asking such a stupid question.
Draco wasn’t sure exactly how he had failed them, or why. He just knew it was somehow his fault. Maybe if he’d seen the signs before the first outbreak. Maybe, if he’d taken a right instead of a left, then he would've seen them, and maybe he could’ve saved them from turning. Maybe if he’s put his attention to formulating a cure rather than selfishly trying to survive. He didn’t know.
He let his gaze absently wander to the griffindore's table. His eyes went to the infamous Harry Potter. Normally Draco would have glared at his back, but this time he saw green. Potter was looking at him. Long before he looked at him. Draco sneered. Or at least tried to and turned away. He didn't fail to miss the others flustered look.
Strong, calloused hands pushed him down onto the bed and pushed his shirt up. Potter gave a slight wince and wrinkled his nose in disgust.
Draco shot up when he heard the voice. He knew it all to well, and yet it seemed somewhat different. The sheets slipped slights off his shoulders and Draco let out an involuntary shiver.
Draco gave a small glare. This conversation was going exactly as it’s gone with Granger. “Who do you fucking think? We needed to food because we ran out. Blaise and me.” He leaned his head back in defeat. They weren’t going to believe him. Whether he told the truth or not. They were never going to fucking believe him.
Potter sighed. Warm fingers pulled at his bandages, carefully peeling them off, and cringing as they came in contact with the sickening blobs of puss. It was disgusting. It really was.
“I know! And I have been...but sometimes I just need a break,” Draco tried, flailing his arms around to convey his point, but in no avail. Harry gave him an  unamused look and Draco continued. “C’mon...it’s the holidays, and we have weeks before school starts again. Let's do something for a change. You know...like head to town, have picnic, go grab a butterbeer? Anything!
Potter loosening his hold, and that's when Draco burst into action. He pushed the raven, and sprang out from under Potter. He pushed up from the bed, and had only managed a step from the bed, before a hand grabbed his wrist. He yelped as the hand spun him around, and brought him back into Potter's chest.
His kidnapper frowned narrowing his eyes. “Normally we don’t negotiate with thieves, but I’ll make an exception.”
Draco's face brightened instantly and he tried to stand, and moaned a little when he accidently stepped on his bad ankle, but didn't say anything. Maybe Mrs Weasley didn't hate him as much as he suspected after all? Maybe!-
Another hit, and Draco swore he could hee stars. His jaw rattled slightly, blood dripping out from the corner of his lips. “Try again.”
He wanted to give up...just not care for a moment. Perhaps even get a nice dream...or maybe sleep forever. He didn’t know. But as the darkness crept up upon him, Draco found himself not caring.
Harry gritted his teeth and continued to glare at the feret as though hoping it would peirce a hole through his head.
” Draco sneered slightly, feeling blood begin to rush up to fill his face. “W-what do I sound like?!”
For Molly Weasley, today was going to be a good day. She was going to make lasagna, and cake, and she would think and spend time with her children. Today was definitely going to be a good day.
For some reason they seemed louder, and his head throbbed in a dull pain every time Pansy would shreak.
the magic being used to cover them up. It felt delicate, fragile, weak but ready to snap back at anything that threatened it. It was controlled, hidden behind a thin layer of ice ready to drag the victim down into the cold, murkey water that lay below.
So when that first tear broke free, the rest followed in an unbroken stream. Sobs to incoherent cries for help poured from her mouth like vomit.
As soon as Draco heard the door click shut, and the footsteps fade out into the distance, he turned. He pulled his knees closer to his chest, and let out a chocked sob, and the first tear broke through, the rest following along in an unbroken stream. He could feel his heartbeat speeding up, pounding in his ears, threatening to burst right out of his chest. He felt so small, yet so big. Lungs burned as they reached their maximum capacity, and forced themselves to stay there-and the tension hurt. The gagging feeling fills his thought, and Draco just sobs louder, wrapping his arms tighter around his fragile self, whispering and telling himself to stop shaking, only to find him shaking even more.
At that Malfoy rolled his eyes and scoffed. "My own good, my arse," he muttered underneath his breath.
Squeezing his knees together he huddles into a small ball in the empty dark hall. And he’s alone. All alone. No Blaise. No Pansy. No one, but the soft melody of the unfortunates playing in the distance.
“And so what? We risk their lives for our own?” Blaise shakes his head, looking at him in disbelief. “They have more of a chance to survive on their own, then with us.”
He didn’t look back. Couldn’t afford it. Potter, and his gang was no doubt already catching up, and with final look Potter had given him, he didn’t think the raven was going to relent any time soon.
“Why indeed?” Draco asked, more to himself than to the raven that sat only a foot away from his frail, shivering form. “
Another hit to the jaw. Draco winced as another sharp pain bolted through his skull. Ears ringing, and head slightly dazed. “Don’t play games with me, traitor! You know exactly what I am talking about!
Draco swore he did his best to avoid his ‘mission,’ as much as he could, not wanting to take part of it. Killing Dumbledore?
He wonders if he can trust these people, but decides against it. For all he knew, they might just boil them alive, and chew their chopped up pieces down as dinner but something was different about these people.
“Draco does suit your more than Sylas ever would, now doesn’t it?” Draco didn’t reply to that. “What’s your little buddy’s name?”
“We should get going. It’s almost curfew,” Draco said, trying to rid himself of the uncomfortable silence.
And as the Yule Ball crept closer, Draco couldn’t help, but wonder whether or not he could hate Harry as he once had before.
The door was locked, and secure...and if anything, he had this tall-ass human right next to him. Another inhuman scream pierces through the air, and Draco winces, closing his eyes tighter, trying to shut out the outside world once and for all.
The raven–Harry closed his eyes out of annoyance or defeat. Draco couldn’t tell. “We are not!” Granger persists, tongue dripping with poison.
The raven in front of him paused, causing Draco to bump into his back. “Let you go?” The raven questioned, turning around.
Draco sighed, risking a small look to his stomach. Big mistake. Black ick oozed out from the gaping hole, sputtering out in ugly clumps of red. He could feel the bile starting to force its way back up his throat, but swallowed it down, hoping it would stay down. No wonder, Potter sounded worried. An injury this bad, could make anyone revolt, and give a small hint of pity...or worry. He couldn’t really tell the difference anymore.
Draco winced slightly, his surprise turning to anger. “Oh yeah?! What do you fucking know? I’ve been out there 2 years. Two years, and it’s just me and Blaise!! Don’t give me that ‘he’s lying’ bulshit! You don’t know anything!!
It’s a maze of the worst kind, running up and down and in directions Draco didn't even know were possible. It’d be a feat for any one to find their way around this hell.
Eventually, Harry did reach the infirmary. He walked with heavy feet and trembling arms towards the nearest empty bed, and placed Draco on the white sheets, waiting for them to be stained soon enough. Why the hell was everything white anyway?
The raven sighed, adjusting his glasses a little, and stood up from the floor. Merlin, oh how Draco wished Potter had just stayed on the ground. Potter towering over him didn't exactly make him feel the most..
Draco tried to smile. Was that worry he heard in Potter’s voice? No...it could just be pity he reminded himself. Not that Draco minded.
Harry let out a satisfied grunt, and stepped closer to the choking boy, and let his thumb brush across the other's cheek in what would seem like a caring manner, but of course Malfoy knew that wasn't the case. The carress was no show of affection, it was a warning. A warning that things were only going to get worse.
"Why Potter? Can't hold me down for long?" Draco gritted, moving again, trying to loosen the hold in any way he could.
"Maybe," Pansy said while putting her finger to her lips and then winking. "But I never kiss and tell. Just not my style."
His captor grinned widely, and Draco swallowed the small lump of anxiety that had found its way up from the queasiness in his stomach. “What do I have to agree to?”
Draco didn't know. He's lost track of time, and he could feel his consciousness slowly fading away. He could no longer tell if he was cold or warm. A tingling sensation had taken over his body, and with every passing minute his eyelids grew heavier.
little knucklehead!” she scorned, taking a sharp turn down the hall. “How could you possible leave him in such a condition?!”
That was the oath the three had taken together, but looking back at it now, it didn’t seem they were given much of a choice.
” the raven paused, green looking over to meet silver. He hadn’t needed to say anything else. Draco already understood.
Draco paused for a moment, not speaking and then returning Granger’s questions with a soft number. “..Layne..”
–” he paused, feeling everyone’s eyes on him. He gave a sharp look, as they all returned to their eating. “
Warnings: Suicide thoughts, Implied/mentioned suicide, violence, some gory descriptions, flashbacks, self-worth, and interrogations.
Everything flashed like wildfire through his eyes. He was hearing but not really listening...feeling but not understanding. Draco felt detached. As though he were watching a movie unfold through his eyes. He wasn’t there...but he was there.
Draco stared blankly at Potter, barely comprehending. His lack of sleep was catching up to him, and Potter's bloody yelling wasn't helping. He swallowed, feeling dry and raised his eyebrows, bringing back the cocky grin.
He could hear Potter grit his teeth from behind him. "Fine," the raven muttered in a small growl. "I'll answer your questions, but the same applies for you."
His dreams, were of that perfect fairytale. And as the days went by, Draco wished he'd never wake up, because overtime his eyes would open all he ever felt was utter dread. He'd be dragged back into this cruel world of his, and spend his hours trying not to break there and then. Trying not to panic. To not to curl up and hide away in the corner, in hopes that his arms could somehow protect him.
He regretted ever making fun of the Weasley’s. He regretted not saying goodbye to his beloved mother. He regretted not putting in the effort to listen to her..or try to help. He regretted being the coward his father was. He regretted being so selfish...
Her name? She supposed it really didn’t matter much matter much now. Back at the hideout, it was the only thing that they could could grasp onto and call their own. The only real thing, that reminded them they were still alive, breathing...
Hermione snorts, chipping the piece of wood with his knife. “Sure,” she mutters, not bothering to get up from his spot on the log to greet Luna.
Neither of them had spoken a word of the loss. They hadn’t known what to say. Didn’t know whether they were supposed to cry, or hug....or laugh. Nothing felt right. Nothing felt
He remembers snooping in his mother and father’s negotiations with their new boss. He remember betrayal, and pain and heartbreak. He remembers running away that night. How he’d gotten his friends together, how they’d shut down the entire facility, and how he’d stolen the one serum that could decide of the survival of mankind. He remembers feeling like a hero. He wanted to be a hero.
I'm low-key sleep deprived so i finished this chapter and really didn't have the strength to proof read it, so there might be grammar mistakes, but if you guys notice something that is off or doesn't make sense, feel free to tell me! Criticism and advice for plot is greatly appreciated!
Harry gritted his teeth. "It doesn't matter how I knew you were out after curfew. All I know is that you did
The hazy figure of the raven stood up, saying something Draco couldn’t really make out. Or maybe he just didn’t want to hear it. With the way the figure walked out from the room, running a hand through its hair, a habit that Potter had grown quite fond of. Draco doubted Potter had anything good to say. Just more painful words, which were the tiniest bit more agonizing that his father’s cane.
Her lips quirked up a little. Was...was she smiling?? Draco furrowed his eyebrows. What was wrong with this weasel?? She was...
“Shhhh...shhh..it’s ok..” was all that came in return, and it made Draco’s blood boil with rage. Another smear of the paste, and he howled. Wailing, and screeching like a wolf in transformation. “Shhhh..it’s ok.
” Draco slurred, not really sure why he bothered saying anything at all, but he supposed it was worth it.
She would not hold out for hope. She lost such a foolish though a long time ago, and now she only wants to quench the never-ending rage that runs through her veins.
His captor didn’t reply, instead turning around and giving a sharp tug to the rope to get him walking again. All the while, Draco glared at his back, silently hoping it would pierce a hole straight through his back.
His eyes shifted long his tracks surrounding the house in a circle. There were almost gone now, his holes being filled up with the snow, and a part of him wondered if he disappeared, if anyone would care at all. If anyone would notice.
He should’ve knows when he’d first seen them. They’d looked familiar, and Draco wants to bash his head for not noticing it earlier. Draco and Blaise might as well have walked straight into the zombie herd themselves.
Were they? Or was Harry doing this all out of guilt. Draco groaned, running a hand through his disheveled hair in frustration. He didn’t know and it infuriated him.
. Draco swore, Merlin had used his best pallet to paint him with the most purest of colours, warmth finding itself home in even the most darkest of colours. The emerald holding all the wonders of the world, shining with ambition and
Ron said joyfully chewing his food, but freezing when a shadow gloomed over him. He gulped, taking the food down in one bite and looked up with a wavering smile.
His lips graze against Draco’s neck, and he could feel the warmth of Potter’s breath along with the wetness of the blood seeping out from the raven’s mouth.
Everyone thrived for the top. Everyone wanted to rule...to be the best, to be the fittest of them all. Draco just wanted to run. Get somewhere away from others. Somewhere away from himself.
....And that was how he met Liddi. He took the coffee from Liddi and almost smiled at her. Almost. There were no need for any exchange of thank you's. Liddi knew he appreciated it.
Seemed nice when she was younger, but she was learning. Late maybe, but as her final moments were drawing closer, she was beginning to see the lie. It was an inconvenient truth. Something she, nor anyone else could ever change. There was never any happy ending.
"Who are you calling a brat?! And just what the hell are you thinking by calling Pomfrey!? You better let go of me this instant Potter or I'll-!"
Draco instantly lifted his head up and opened his eyes. He looked at the shivering form of his sister and regretted not grabbing another cloak before leaving. His wand was useless at the minute. Binded. To prevent him from using magic. But at least Draco had a few potions and dark artifacts on him.
He pulled his own cloak off himself, leaving only his blood soaked shirt to protect himself from the bitter, dry wind. Draco wrapped the little figure with the cloak and kissed her head with cracked lips.
Snarling, the raven dragged him out of the bedroom door, all the while Draco struggled. He twisted, squirmed, kicked, and trashed in the frightening hold. Hell, he ever tried biting. Turning to the ways of the unfortunate. Draco was desperate.
Scared shitless as the rusty door creaks open, the metal hinges grinding against one another as it was forced open.
It wasn’t his fault that he wasn’t able to walk at his best with his ankles and wrists tied. Not his fault for not having eaten or drinken any water or food in the past two days. Wasn’t his fault that his heart was racing with anxiety bubbling at his very skin wondering when these people were going to feed them to the unfortunates, or when Blaise would die or when he would die. It wasn’t his fault. It wasn’t. It wasn’t.
Harry was confused, so very very confused. Why wasn't Madame Promfrey mad at him, anymore importantly why hadn't Draco said anything about what had happened earlier? This isn't what was supposed to happen. He was supposed to be in St. Mungos, perhaps even Azkaban. They were supposed to be shocked, and disgusted by him...
He stood up abruply pushing his plate away in the process, and made his way towards the Slytherin's table, ignoring his friends concerned cries, and the strange looks being thrown his way. No, Harry did not like Malfoy. Infact he loathed him more than anything, but Harry had made a promise to Madame Pomfrey. He'd told her that he's make sure Malfoy took his potions, and that he slept properly. And Harry always kept true to his word, even if it was half heartedly said.
magic," he whispered hoarsely. Too bad Potter heard him, and the other boy shook in realization. Whether Potter shook out of panic or anger, Draco did not know. However one thing was for certian. It was not out of fear.
“Walk faster,” came a growl from the raven, and another tug on the rope. Draco stumbled forward, close to giving up then, but he forced himself to stay upright. Glaring at the back of his captor’s head, he snarled.
Draco blinked dumbfounded watching the raven rambling on about shit he couldn’t possible give a damn about at the moment. “How the fuck did yo–”
this was real. Sooner or later he’d wake up cold with Blaise by his side, all alone. And that would be a real fucking punchline, wouldn’t it?
Draco had never eaten another human before. He couldn’t do it. Couldn’t deal with the guilt that would follow after that. He knew Blaise had though, even if he’d never actually admit it. Times were desperate, and Draco understood that. He didn’t blame Blaise. Just like Blaise wouldn’t blame him, if he were to do the same.
Gripping his bat tightly, he walked cautiously for the door. They had to be waiting for him, and he just needed one moment of shock to slip by, and escape. He took in a deep breath, letting his mouth open slightly to keep his breathing quiet.
The voice was menacing, cold, and even more poisoned than that he’s heard with Granger. Shivers ran down his spine and he nodded again not trusting his voice to speak.
New Chapter! I know I haven't updated in a long time, but I hope this makes up for it! Hope you guys like it!
Taking in a deep breath he turned around to place the lion back on the stand. Only he threw it instead, letting it fall and clatter onto the floor.
Pansy gasped at that, putting a hand up to her heart dramatically, and her mouth opening in shock. "He told me to move!
Well, it wasn’t really their ‘base,’ per say. Just a spot where they would stay for the night. Traveling during the night was dangerous. Unfortunates plagued even the emptiest of places, but that had never stopped Blaise and Draco. Traveling at night was the easiest for them. It kept them out of sight, and the sewer systems were a great route to get around the city. Unfortunates tended to stay away from these areas when the sun went down. They moved out to the open during the night. The behaviour was strange, but then again, when had unfortunates ever been normal?
"You're telling me to shut up!! NO ONE TELLS ME TO SHUT UP! My own mother doesn't tell me to shut up!!! YOU CANT TELL ME TO SHUT UP EITHER!!!"
“H-How?” Draco finds himself saying, when the raven beside him gave no response. “How did you manage to stay hidden with
Draco face palmed and sent Blaise a pleading look, who in return starts to defend Pansy with his 'That's right, Potter. You can't tell her to move!'
His ears caught up with the barely audible sound of Granger’s painted screech, and for a moment, Draco wanted nothing more than to tear them apart for touching her. It wasn’t fair...they didn’t deserve this. Weasley stood behind the bulk of a tree trying to keep himself away from the bombarding spells which didn’t show any signs of stopping anytime soon. Potter was rolling off the side, dodging yet another spell, this one from his father. They were being overwhelmed...they were losing. It wasn’t until Granger’s screeched turned to violent screams and thrashes did Draco sob.
“Ok ok...your turn.” Draco added quickly. The topic was tense, and neither seemed to willing to talk about it yet.
all made sense. The thin red sheets, coated with a golden boarder. The lion carved onto the top of all 4 bedposts. How had he not seen this before?! He looked down at his lap and shifted slightly so that his feet almost hung off the edge of the bed,
His path ahead doesn’t feel like a lot longer. Today...maybe tomorrow, it will be an unlucky raid, and an unfortunate will let its jaw open and clamp shut around his heart. Chewing and gnawing, it’d tear him apart. And Draco has no doubt it will be painful. Maybe it's karma. He deserved it for letting Pansy die so easily. For not trying harder. Maybe...maybe if he hadn’t done what he did five years ago...this all would’ve stopped by now.
Harry lets out a chuckle, and sits across from him. “I suppose you can sleep here..unless of course, you’d rather sleep on the floor or in the hall, but there is no guarantee that you won’t see a freak or come across a few rats. No promises.”
Draco whipped his head around to look at Potter. Potter stood tall, a smirk painting his face and leaning on  the table next to the bed.
“Yeah...well, you wouldn’t listen otherwise.” Draco huffed, crossing his arms. Inside, he was relieved that Potter had stopped crying. Gods, this boy was like a complete child.
Hermione gave a small groan of frustration, and quickly ushered out from the dorm door, heading down to Harry’s room. Harry followed, still confused, and just the tiniest bit worried.
Pansy looked offended. "Of course I know what that is! It's cuffee. We have that stuff all around my manor!" She raised her chin and smirked defiantly.
And then Draco shot forward, covering his sisters body with his own to protect her from the wind. He shivered, starting to feel his hands go numb already.
The raven was so close, and Draco swore he could hear the other’s heartbeat from where he sat, knees deep in the mud, the rain pounding down around them.
New chapter! I know it's a late update, but I hope you guys I liked it! I wanted to start a new Drarry Fan-fiction, and my impatient ass wouldn't let me wait to finish the other stories first. My other Drarry fan fiction is called, 'The Unfortunate Ones.' It's a zombie AU, where Harry has a mullet, and there is no magic. If it seems interesting to you, please go check it out! I promised it won't disappoint!
Maybe he could tell Harry about it. He’d trust him, right? They had this talk before. Sure, he’d avoided the question, but he still got a gist of what Potter had tried to tell him. That he would, ‘trust him.’ Even so, Draco wasn’t sure.
And with that Draco pulled the cloaks around Lilly tighter and tied the two ends of the cloaks together so they would keep wrapped around her. This was it. He had no other choice, but the Weasley's. Anywhere else would've been better.
Blaise made sure to remind him that every now and then, just to quiet his want to meet others. He knew better now, and wanted nothing more than to leave, even if that meant killing the boy in front of him. And if blaming Blaise for that made it easier, than so be it. It wasn’t as though Blaise would ever know.
She handed him the vile and Draco cringed with the smell. He looked up hoping that Madame Pomfrey might take a little bit of pit on him, but she stood unshaken. Sighing, he closed his eyes, held his breath and downed the liquid in one gulp. It'd been a big mistake. Draco sputtered and gagged with the taste.
Maybe there is still humanity left. Something humane still lingering around in this city, and he couldn’t help but feel excited at the thought that this..this might be their humane.
Their promise to one another seems to be the only reason they hadn’t found death yet, and Blaise figures it was a good idea. The promise kept Draco alive, gave him more time with Pansy, and in a way...kept him alive. There was always the possibility that heaven didn’t exist, and if that were the case, he’d want as much time with the people here as possible. Can’t imagine a life without them.
Lips curling upwards just a little, he let his arms wrap around the warmth, and into the shoulder that held him.
That's when she finally took in the sight laid out before her and gasped. She regretted saying those words to the boy, that didn't mean she liked the boy any better. She simply had pity. The boy infront of her was wearing a shirt. ONLY a shirt. Blood stained it, and she could make out his thin, trembling body underneath the thin cloth. She wondered when he had last eaten. His ears and face nearly blue, hair disheveled. Hands shaking and his clothes drenched in mud. His eyes drooped and looked as if on the verge of fainting.
' he'd told Lilly about. He'd been so desperate that he had gotten on his knees and begged. Draco grimaced at the thought. He'd stooped so..so
“Fine,” his father groaned, reaching for his coat that lay hung over the armrest of the dorm chairs. “
By the time Draco had looked back up, half the table was already gone. Mr. Weasley had long finished his food. He could hear Lily’s laughter and Mrs. Weasley’s laughing from kitchen. The twins were long gone, and the only ones that remained on the table were Potter, Granger, Weasley who was on his third plate full, and his little sister. They were joined in on some conversation about going out later...and Draco was....just listening.
Harry sat on the chair beside Malfoy, as Madame Pomfrey worked her magic on him. Oh, don't get him wrong. Harry would've left a long time ago, that is
So when, ‘holier than thou’ swooped in through the door, looking at him with that same wild anger he’d grown to love. Draco wished he would’ve left when he had the chance. He should be dead by now, and Merlin knows it would be for the best. This secret he was holding, would die along with him. He’d take it to his very grave, and he didn’t have long left...he
This coffee was what helped him survive the day. The smell plunged his nose, and he sighed with content. He took his first sip, and felt pure bliss. The bitterness was perfect along with the tint of sweetness, and it had this strange aftertaste. The crispness of it made his feel better. More whole. Pure bliss.
Knowing that even if they did not survive, they had a week or two of freedom. Surely, they had deserved that. It was the only thing he could give them after all he’s done wrong. It was his way of repenting.
"Oh god...I-I'm sorry...I-I...Malfoy I'm-..i did..n't...mean t-to..I-please..I-I," he mumbled. Harry felt disgusted, scared. Guilty. Of himself. This is what he'd done. What he'd become. He'd turned void again and this time he..he almost
“Yeah,” Blaiss turned to give his a wide grin. Draco returned it, turning his gaze back to the unfortunates piling up on them, “Couldn’t keep you waiting forever, now could I?”
“I want to see Blaise,” he says, tearing his gaze away from the makeshift heaven in front of him. Oh if, Blaise knew...if only he could see
"Hmmm," the raven hummed from his place under Draco. Potter had fallen asleep, and Draco being the selfish brat he was, took full advantage of that. He'd remained curled up on the other's lap pretending to be asleep.
Draco pushed around a piece of lettuce around with his fork, debating on whether he should take the bite. Whether or not he deserved it.
He lowers his gaze to the floor, contemplating on whether or not he should be revealing such information to them. He could lie. They wouldn’t know. They didn’t have to know...as long s Blaise kept up with it...they would never know.
"Awwwww...you can feel me talking!!!" Draco groaned and looked at Blaise pleadingly. He sighed and patted Draco on the back.
At the best case scenario, they would be robbed of their weapons if caught. Worst case scenario? Cannibalism. It wasn’t uncommon. When food became scarce, and all stores were stripped of their good, people had started to resort to eating one another. First, it started with the animals. Their pets. Dogs. Cats. Hamsters. You name it. Then it came down to the mice, and rats. They were a bitch to catch. And when that all ran out...it came down to one another. The weakest in the group would be killed, and chopped up. Cooked...sometimes raw, and given to the others to eat.
They didn’t let Draco meet Blaise. That was the worst part about this capture. He didn’t know where he was, hell alone how far away from the surface he was. It was dark...and cold.
There wasn't a Fred or George spraying her with sink water. No Ginny chattering constantly about Harry. If it wasn't for Ginny dating that Slytherin boy, she'd think that Ginny had a crush on him. They were all out. Ginny, ofcourse was on a date with her boyfriend and as much as Molly disliked the boy, she went along with it. Fred and George were out working and the golden trio was out shopping.
They had promised to survive no matter the cost, but he doesn’t blame her for putting a bullet through her own head. To survive took a strong will...and the fear took over, and the want for a peaceful end overwhelmed the want to survive.
None the less, Draco welcomed it, knowing it'd be gone sooner or later, so why not as well enjoy it while it still existed. Taking a deep breath of air, his arms tightened around the source of heat and pushed up closer to it. Content.
There was Blaise, struggling in the dark against the hold of another male. Red hair, and pale skin. A blade of held up against Blaise’s throat and it made Draco’s heart drop.
But Draco knew that he'd be rejected everywhere else. He had spent too much time thinking, and sitting next to this tree. It's either going to the Weasley's or playing a nice visit to his good friend.
"Shut up," the raven grumbled rolling them over, before continuing on his sleep and Draco couldn't help but feel the tiniest bit jealous. Potter could fall asleep
He stuffed a couple bars in his bag, along with a couple of bottles of water. Mouth watering, he made a grab for the peanut butter. He could already imagine it. The sweet greasy pile of fat, and protein, melting onto the tip of his tongue.
“Same thing Blondie, now speak!” she growled, spitting at Draco with spite that he’d only last seen in the Unfortunates.
to her, You-know-who will be the last of your worries!" He tried to sound intimidating. Sound scary. Sound like a Malfoy, but how pathetic was this. He couldn't even speak Voldemort's name.
He lays in bed for a while, eyes staring blankly at the metal door keeping him confined from the outside world. It’s cold, and he curls up, trying to keep him mind from fearing the worst. He hated it here, despite the tempting luxuries and this...this fabricated sense of safety the room provided him.
Draco trembled under the harsh touch, breath escaping from his parted lips in small pants. “You know what he told me?”
“Mind your own fucking buissness, Mullet,” he sneered, swatting the bloodied hand before him away. “And for fucks sake, take that spring out of your hand, it’s making me sick.”
Draco rested the front of his body with Lilly on door, and silently congratulated himself. He'd made it. To the safe place. To lily's safe place. To..the...the...
The raven growled behind him, and Draco froze shutting his eyes and letting go of his struggle, but keeping his hold on the knife held tight. He wouldn’t let go of it.
"What's wrong, Potter? Cat got your tongue?" Malfoy mocked. He felt his strength come back. This was where he was good at. Talking himself out of any situation, and how to change it to his benefit.
“Yes...I mean no. I didn’t put those pictures up there. I know I’m an arse, but even I wouldn’t stoop
Breathing in a musky, dense scent he opened his eyes slowly flinching away as the light pierced through his sight, blinding him momentarily.
That was her life’s purpose. To survive, or die trying. Another step along the wall, and her legs turned to jelly, pain shooting up from her ankle all the way to her pelvis. Broken foot. Not good. No-it..it wasn’t good at all.
A stray spell hurls towards them, but Potter still doesn’t move. The raven grits his teeth, as the spell hits him in the back. His gaze doesn’t falter, those piercing emerald eyes staring into Draco’s, refusing to budge.
He swallowed, feeling gravity inch them closer, the space closing in on them. And the outside world doesn't seem to matter, almost ceasing to exist. They could kiss at this rate, and he was so close...
Draco looked away, biting the inside of his cheek. His face was flushed, and now he had even begun to pull at the flash around his nails. He never did that!
All hopes of escape shattered then, crumbling to the ground like glass. His hopes weak, and fragile.
And as though understanding what Draco had said, they cried. Screaming and snarling at Draco with the rage Draco still hadn’t gotten used to.
“Hmm...what were you running from?” Draco wanted to swallow himself. Of course the raven wouldn't let go of that little mistake of his.
Draco sits in silence, mind screaming, telling him to do something. Anything. And he trusts it, afterall, it is the only thing that has kept him alive for so long. Not wasting anymore time, he flips the mattress over, tearing at its seams with his fingers. It’s a long painful fight, before the fabric finally gives way, and Draco reaches through the stuffing, pulling out the first metal spring his hands found.
Draco stared wide eyed at the chain of stairs. Was this how they stayed out of sight? Burrowing themselves under a massive underground system. Who had been here before them? What had they done to make this place their home? He followed, curiosity shrouding his instinct to run, and never look back.
"Geez..children these day." Molly muttered, before stepping out into the cold. Ms Weasley even cursed the moment her bare feet hit the snow. She walked about 10 steps and picked Malfoy up, dragging his limp, cold body into the warmth.
Draco was right. They needed him alive after all. He was the only one who knew where this Horcrux was. Had they found out he’d erased his own memory, and he no longer knew, they’d kill him no doubt, and kill the trio along with him. Or maybe they wouldn’t believe him, and torture him until he became like the slobbering man he’d seen in the dungeons. Drool slipping from his mouth, eyes rolled up, body still, but alive. They wouldn’t give the mercy of death.
and turning to look at the clock on the wall, and that's when he remembers he's fucking blind. "Ok ok..wait...ok...it's good now," he says putting his glasses on. "Ok...it's like..2..in the morning. For fuck's sake Malfoy, it's fucking two in the morning, go back to sleep."
Potter holds him, and Draco breaks down. Crying, and sniffling in the other’s shirt. He looks pathetic, and weak, yet Potter holds him, ignoring the calamity unfolding around them.
The rules had kept them alive for this long, and he doubted they would fail him this time. That’s when it hit him. His mistake. It was too easy. Far too easy. Rule number three,
New chapter!! It's kinda sad and depressing, I know, but do not worry....never mind. The next chapter will probably be just as sad and depressing. Anyways, hope you guys like it!! Be sure to review!! Until next time~
"No, you're a big girl and big girls are allowed to get cold. I'm a big boy so I have to be strong and tough, to take care of a big girl like you. You don't have to worry about anything. Just live it up to you big brother. oK?"
Harry chuckled slightly and patted Ron on the back. "Ok ok, Mister Justice, eat your chicken first, and then we can think about beating people up."
Yes, Harry knew this was not helping with the assignment that he'd been given, but it seemed impossible to do it at the moment.
As much as Draco despised the idea of coming here, he honestly had no choice. The Weasley's hate him. They would kick him out in no time. But in his hands was just a little girl. A girl who'd been caught up in this war without ever intending to. A girl who'd been been cursed the life of a Malfoy. They'd accept her.
Hermione didn’t reply, instead tapping into her com, and mumbling something he couldn’t quite make out. Maybe Blaise could...he didn’t know. His head was spinning, knees wobbling with every agonizing step. Draco peered at Blaise with lidded eyes, his head swaying. He stumbled a bit, before coming back up, and taking another step, eyes fixated on the hazy figure of his friend.
“Oh, save me the bullshit!” Potter huffed, words dripping from his tongue like venom, and Draco wanted nothing more than to drink up every last bit of that poison. He too, wanted to cut this bullshit.
Oh, he was lying alright, but Draco hated them...Gods he hated them so much. They were no better. No better than the
Draco snarled, and dropped taking a swipe at the raven’s feet, in hopes of knocking the other out of balance. The boy only responded with a small jump to avoid Draco’s leg, and gave a kick of his own.
“Lily wants Draco to play too!! Draco plays too!!” the toddler spoke, smile blinding. The others gave a distasteful look, but he paid no heed. His sister was looking at him with hopeful eyes, and if this was her wish, then so be it.
Draco woke up cold. Something he had become all too familiar with. His hand had been moved behind his back, legs bound tight together, and he groaned as a piercing pain shot up his spine to the back of his head.
new. If you weren’t, you would’ve killed us by now,” Draco paused for a moment, his voice going quiet. “.
?” Draco cut him off in disbelief, flaring his nostrils, and snarling at the raven. “Right Potter, because I’d totally force myself to stay away for
Sprinted through the woods without as much as a look back. Hell, he didn’t even now where he was going. He just had to get away. Away.
Blood drips to the floor, looking oddlyblack on the floor below. It dripped fast, with no signs of stopping, and Draco trembled, his hand clenched tight on the spring. The spring’s sharp end dug deep into Harry’s palm. The raven wrapped his injured hand wrapped around Draco’s squeezing the spring tighter in his hand.
Draco gasped, feeling warm arms wrap themselves around his back awkwardly. The owner of the warmth dropped their head within the crook of his neck, muttering something he didn't quite hear.
“W-why would you return?” Draco stammered. They had gotten away from this city...no one gets out of this city, and now they’re breaking back in? Draco had begged to find a way from out this city, but from what Draco and Blaise knew, there could be the
His father huffed, raising his cane slightly, and Draco had to will himself to not flinch. “As I was saying. The Dark Lord has requested your presence.”
Blaise lets a dreadful thought begin to sink into his blood. Today might be their last day alive. He might stop breathing tomorrow, and he isn’t sure whether to be smiling with joy or to start balling his eyes out.
Draco knew that feeling. He grew up with it. Gripped its hand as it would drag him deeper into the depths of the forests, promising a way out, only to get more entangled. Lost. Unsure. Oblivious?
Draco didn’t get the chance to jump out though. The black-haired boy reached out, snatching his wrist in a crushing grip. The other, came around, and took a hold of the bat, pulling it back, and eventually forcing it out of Draco’s slim fingers.
His silent question remained unanswered, as rough hands pried his mouth open, pouring what he could only hope was a drought of peace. His minds numbed, senses dulling to the point where he could hardly feel as much as a buzz. A peace drought. A highly complicated, and difficult potion to brew. One that he, himself still had trouble with. The ingredients had to be put in a precise order, mixture stirred exactly the right amount of turns, and the heat of the flames simmered to the exact temperature for the perfect timing, before adding the last ingredient.
"Listen here, Parkinson. I'm in no mood for your horseplay, so I suggest you get out of my way, before-"
Draco hugged and kissed his sister goodnight. Her eyes were brighter now, and her speech a little better. He walked out the door with a smile, but it fell as he reached is own room.
Horcrux? Was that what he had done. Hidden this horcrux somewhere even the Dark Lord’s most trusted men couldn’t find it. He couldn’t help but smile in pride. He’d finally been useful. If what he had done was important enough to get the Dark Lord to order every single one of his followers out for his head, then oh how he would fucking love dying knowing they wouldn’t be able to anything to reverse his deeds.
Draco doesn't reply. Doesn’t want to give this fucking mullet the satisfaction of knowing. Instead, he opts to falling onto the bed before him, feeling his muscles begin to water at the soft touch of the mattress. Fucking hell, they had beds.
“Ok, I start,” Draco said, cutting potter off, who had just opened his mouth. “During second year...How did you get a hold of a Polyjuice Potion? Was it Granger?”
The brunet tilts his head, slightly amused. As though it had met some new species and was now trying to dissect it to see how it works. The other was curious eyeing the makeshift weapon in Draco’s hand. Something Draco didn't quite understand. “And are you trying to kill me now?” he asked.
His henchmen scrambled forward, putting a clean bullet through the unfortunate still gnawing its way through the girl’s stomach. In all, it’s disgusting. The girl lay, her parts scrambled across the cold floor, brains splattered across the pillar behind her, with a gaping hole going going through her skull, all the way from underneath her jaw to the tip of her head.
“I do not!” he snapped back, trying to push away his yearning nerved to the back of his mind. His body felt incomplete, missing something he couldn't begin to describe.
The realization dawned upon Draco like cold water. They needed him alive. If this Horcrux important enough to have them send out a search party for him. Important enough to not kill him on first sight...they needed him, because to them, only Draco knew where the Horcrux was. Ironically, he didn’t remember, but it wasn’t as they had to know.
Potter let out a sigh, and looked off to the side. “Yeah...it allows be to see where anyone within the boundaries of this school...”
None the matter. Blaise was alive. He was alive. And as long as they were alive they would still  be surviving, and
Harry paused for a moment, and scratched the back of his head nervously. “..you know...like an adorable little lawn mower.”
Draco raised his head up to look at Potter. Potter had changed, again. The once confident, smug Potter, now turned back into his clueless, and flustered self. The strong magic that had wavered smoothly around the air, now became uneven. It peaked up and went back down, cracking the windows, and shattering the chandeliers. The worst part? Draco could
Malfoy of the other hand was now turning blue, he tried gasping, and digged his nails in his neck in an attempt to release whatever it was that was suffocating him.
He couldn't blame them for wanting  a piece of him. Not to be cocky, but you can't change the facts, now can you?
Harry looked over Ron's shoulder and to the slytherin table. Malfoy was looking glumly down at the apple down in his hand. Harry frowned and turned to Ron. "Yeah...I see it too...but...lets not waste our time talking about Malfoy. He's not worth it."
you get a taste of what would happen to you if you refused. Didn’t feel the need to waste time in asking politely first..so here we are!”
When Harry had first come to the Weasley house, he had been thin, frail, and weak. You could even see his ribs. She shuddered at the thought.
"Lilliath can grow her hair, and wear dresses!! And Lilliath doesn't have to wear that stuffy, ucky suit again??"
And that is all to think. Nothing more. He feels tired, and even running down to the next turn seems like a chore. He pauses, his steps faltering, and takes a moment to look at the walls around him.
His voice full of a thousand expressions and the emerald eyes shining with emotions Draco had thought were long lost through the years. But his words were chilling. Like that of a child that had been kept away from the outside world and was just learning. Calculating.
“And you promised to be truthful. I guess we both broke our promises, now didn’t we? So how about we start again, and your friend wouldn’t have to go through that again.”
Draco was getting desperate. He pressed the muggle Bell again and again, and rested his head to the door. His legs bucked and he stumbled to the ground, hitting the door in a frantic manner. In any other situation it would've been funny. Seeing the great Slytherin prince hit himself on the head with Weasley's door.
He was getting nowhere with this. Potter wasn't going to give up and the two idiots wouldn't be of any help. The whispering has increased, now turning into soft murmers. If this kept up, he would lose his reputation. He could already feel the leering looks being given to him from the slytherin table. He sighed and made up his mind.
Draco paused and took in a deep breath. He'd forgotten to breathe in that little rant of his. He panted and looked at Mrs Weasley with a flushed face.
And a blood-curdling scream echoed from the hallways, laughter following it. Fear peaked at his very skin, his hands trembling, the slicing of his knife cutting through raw meat.
On the side, Potter must've stopped his rambling, because he couldn't hear the muffled voices anymore. His vision shook, and an unimpressed face came before him asking him what he was on about now. His body felt numb, knowing that Potter must've thought of this as another act of him. The tingling sensation took over, half putting his body at ease, while his brain screamed. Begging to let him out. His eyes searched around the room the room, desperate to look at something other than the raven's disappointing face. He'd done something wrong again. Messed up this fairytale even more, making everything worse. He felt judged. Felt like a failure...at everything. Like he couldn't do a damn thing right.
He held the probity Probe tight in his hand, careful to not touch it with the shard of glass just yet.
He waits...gripping the spring as though it were his last resort of survival...and maybe it was. He can tell it’s Harry. The footsteps. Each person’s step defined, the sound calculated to its unique shape and size, and Draco has made it an art to memorize the steps of all he’s met.
From the corner of his eye, he can see his men begin to drag the body out of the warehouse, shooting nay unfortunate that had the misfortune of approaching them.
Cries, and spells rang out through the air, and Draco snapped his head up to the sky, crying as Mr.Weasley and his group of aurors came swooping down on their brooms. The whole scenario felt like the cliche endings from the old fairy tales he’s read when he was younger.
Draco rolled his eyes and reached for the apple and took a bite out of it, chewing slowly, feeling sick as the food slipped down throat.
Was there still an ounce of humanity left within him? A small bit...maybe the slightest touch? His mind crawled back to the woman that lay chained, snarling and only moments from turning. The glass walls that kept them all contained, and alive in a living nightmare. He remembers Sarah. She was only 7...and crying sobbing incoherent slurs of words she’d barely learned to speak. He remembers watching her get better. He remember that hope...that glimmer of hope shining in the child’s ink black eyes. When he’s returned later that night waiting to see Sarah with that dazzling smile of hers, he was met with horror. She’d clawed her eyes out...with her own very small hands.
low. Can’t believe you still think that I put them up there,” Draco said, talking more to himself than Potter.
“M-Malfoy,” he hears a voice from behind him. It was Weasley, voice cracking almost horrified, Draco doesn’t fall for it. He knows it’s not real. He knows they don’t actually care.
That was something they’d learned a long time ago. They weren’t going to repeat their mistake again. Not again.
His palms started to sweat, and he rubbed his fingers together feeling the dampness. He placed his fingers together mending them. Glued,  stuck, and then he'd pull at them. Ripping them apart and then repeating the process. Like there were two people inside of him, both yelling at him, blaming him for all that was happening. A part of him telling him to confess everything, to give it a try. To try to get the help he needs and desperately wants. That it was his own fault that this was happening, and he best to something about it. The other, telling him doesn't matter. Telling him that nothing he does would change a nothing. No one to believe him, and none to stoop low enough to help a person with the likes of him. Again his own fault. His own actions and behaviour that bought and place him here.
“Yeah?” She glides the knife carefully across the wood, taking pieces off strip by strip. Slow and calculated. “And what’s that?
"The more I think I know you, the more baffled I become. What is it with you, Malfoy? Coming into my life, and not making me able to push you away." He mumbled, and dropped down on the other side of the bed. Harry looked up at the ceiling and sighed. He had no idea how he was going to pull through everything. He had no real idea on how to defeat Voldemort, and it's been months since they had started to work on figuring out what the horcruxes were, and with no luck. He turned to his side, pulling the covers over him, careful not to take them away from Malfoy.
He can hear shouts from the other side of the door, but Draco can’t find himself to understand any of the words. The adrenaline was pumping through his blood, his ears filled with the soft hum of each heartbeat.
“Draco,” Blaise speaks again, more softly this time. “I know it’s hard, but we can’t put them at risk.”
Sorry, I have never had a panic attack before, so I can't possibly begin to understand what that would feel like. I researched a bit online, and wrote this chapter based upon what I read. If there is something off, or wrong, please let me know! I'll be more than glad to fix it.
Fingers trembling he reached for the vile that lay forgotten on the table top. Popping the top open, he tried pouring the potion down his throat. He felt the liquid dribbling down his chin, wetting his shirt, as vile slipped from his fingers a little, missing his mouth. He swallowed the little bit that had found it's way into his mouth, feeling the groggy taste enveloping his tongue.
His lower lip trembled, as he breathed in the hatred. The rage they held for him. The tiniest bit of hope hidden underneath the inky blackness. As though they thought Draco could help them....
Potter let out a gasp and put his hands over his chest mockingly. "Oh my, such vulgur language and that too from a noble pure blood. Tsk. Tsk."
Draco let out a pained laugh. “Oh thank fucking god! I can finally be rid of this disgusting name you’d so graciously bestowed upon me!! I NEVER WANTED TO BE A FUCKING MALFOY ANYWAY!” he yelled despite the scratching in his throat. “
He didn’t know how to reply to that. Were they dead...were they alive? Draco didn’t know...he fears he’ll never truly know. “
They were quiet for a moment. Silence filled the whistling air, as they peered to the horizon over the lake. It was nice. Frost was beginning to freeze over the water in crystal. The small gleam of light over the hills gave the waters a orange hue, making it look more like an autumn afternoon rather than winter. Snowfall was late this year, but he still hoped it would snow during Christmas.
He follows the other out through the metal door, biting his lip with every agonizing step. The door opens, enveloping Blaise in a blanket of light, and for the first time in months, he doesn’t look back to the darkness, wondering if he was ready to accept the change he knew was to come.
he found himself asking, almost craving for the answer to this question he couldn’t even begin to understand. He wasn’t even worth such effort. Wasn’t worth this potion. Fuck him, if he was even worth as much as a sickle. So why? Why put this much in for him. Why not just let him fall into the bliss of endless sleep. He’d be more than happy to sleep forever. Never needing to wake up again. Not having to deal with reality ever again. Not having to put the effort into dreaming...living...or
I know this is short, and also a very late update, but I hope it works for now. I'll be sure to update soon. I'll also start to update this story more regularly from now on. Anyways, hope you guys enjoy it. Be sure to review!
And I'm really sorry at how slow I'm writing this! I'll try to update the next chapter as soon as I can and hopefully make it longer!
Draco knows they could all be alive. Astoria. Pansy. Theo–they could all have been...alive. Breathing.
Hermione narrowed her eyes, and the same dreadful feeling of guilt began to build. “What do you mean...
"No. You see, we don't like sharing and besides why should we just hand him over to you? You think us as weak, Potter?"
She washed her hands quickly and turned the oven off. The house was soundproof and the windows concealed from the outside world. So the ones outside wouldn't be able to hear or see the ones inside. She'd put the spell around it for safety. Fred and George had teased her for being so paranoid. It wasn't her fault though! They hadn't seen the war like she had. They had yet to experience loss, pain, and fear. And she hoped, dearly hoped that it would stay that way.
kill Malfoy....so why was he feeling guilty. This was Malfoy. Harry, this is Draco Malfoy. He deserves this. There was no need for him to feel bad or say sorry. This was his long rival right here. His enemy and Harry should be glad. Glad. Like he'd first felt when he was first ordered his magic to hurt Draco.
She let out a small chuckle, sounding more like gasps for air, and coughs. Huh, it seemed even when she was going to die and unlike the movies, there would be no last look to the sky. No last bask of sunlight, or a tree...or chocolate or grass or the smiles of her friends or kisses or the last piece of gum she’d saved for later or late-night walks or the night or the moon or stars or....or
That earned him a knee to the stomach. Draco tried to topple over pain, but the ropes held tight to their promise, rending him immovable. “Shut up! Answer the question, traitor. Where is it? And where have you hidden
Harry walked over to Malfoy's side of the bed, and pulled the sheets over the boy, but stopped when he saw the tracks trailing down Malfoy's cheek. Harry bit his lip, feeling a little guilty when he remembered the words he'd said to Malfoy. Maybe...just maybe Malfoy hadn't been faking it. But such a strong reaction only to having to take a potion to fall asleep seemed like a little too much. Even to Harry. Harry understood that not wanting to go to sleep.
"Well, from what I see. It seems like you are ready to abandon your sister wherever, as long as you get rid of her."
Draco stood in his room for a moment, not sure exactly what to take along with him. His wand was useless to him, and his broom now in custody of the one and only saviour of the wizarding world. The potions he’d made from earlier were poured down the drain.
Surely it couldn't have been less than twenty minutes. It felt far too long. It HAD to be longer. An hour maybe? No...hours.
"Potter!! You let go of me this instant! POTTER!!" Draco yelled as his feet were forced forward away from the table and towards the exit and Potter would've succeeded in his attempt of kidnapping Draco if it weren't for Pansy and Blaise that stood in his way. Oh, lord bless these two heavenly being that have decended from heaven...No...scratch that...They were demons.
Draco swallows backing up closer to the wall, trying to stay as far away from the raven as possible, which wasn’t that much, considering it was a twin-sized mattress. The reality of the situation was starting to sink in, dropping like rocks in his stomach. They wouldn’t do that...would they? He turns around, facing his back to the other, and closes his eyes, not daring to fall asleep just yet.
