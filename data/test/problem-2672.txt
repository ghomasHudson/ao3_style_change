Malfoy looked out at the empty grounds. They could hear some rustling in the overgrown grass. It was probably some gnomes. God knows what they were getting up to, this late at night. Harry decided he preferred not to know.
Ah what a pity. And here I thought I was being subtle.
It wasn't a date.
Malfoy turned to face him.
"Well, not like that's such a bad thing."

(See the end of the chapter for
You've never been good at that. Anyway, what've you been doing?
"Well, the short version is, if you break it, you die."
Harry laughed bitterly. "I'd say it wasn't your fault, but I don't know."
"Falling to your death after getting hit by a killing curse from your confidant? Still one of the better ways to die."
Harry laughed, his eyes bright, open. Sometimes it looked like he had nothing to hide, no secrets at all.
"I agree. Send me a list of secrets tomorrow, and then we can do one each week. I think mine can take up the rest of this week. You good with next week?"
Who says I need my hands to write?
Harry's voice betrayed him. He paused, took in another breath. Breathe. Let it out.
Hermione and Ron watched as Harry moved too quickly, and nearly knocked himself over. Malfoy grabbed hold of his waist to steady him, and both of them laughed. Hermione smiled. She was glad to see him happy again. She turned to face Ron, tell him she was right after all, that this seemed to be working out for the best.
“You mean the wedding?”
“Nothing, I just know war and people tend to die during it. Let me tell you, I wish you all the best, but if anything happens to him, or to you, wouldn’t you regret it? And I’ quite sure that everyone needs to remember what they are fighting for!”
That’s why he accepted to help the Deatheathers to get into Hogwarts.
He turned around when someone tapped on his shoulder, and he was surprised to see Seamus Finnigan standing there, swaying unsteadily.
He set a tray on the nightstand next to my bed, bowed, and then scurried out. I looked over and found that it was steak, potatoes, and broccoli. There was a goblet, and a fork, knife, and spoon.
“I tried, ‘Mione, and your healing charms are much better than mine-”
I'm on the wrong side of a war.
Her voice is a bit too loud, and I put my face in my hands.
Ah. Yes. There it is.
Blaise came over  me and grabbed my wrist. “Bye, guys. See you tomorrow at breakfast. Your table?”
I ran over, throwing my arms around her, and I whispered, "Maman, what's wrong?" (Quick
I'd forgotten about Christmas. Wasn't that the whole reason that I came back to my fucking house?
I mean, who gets five gigantic boxes of pranks? I want to ask him about that, but if I get my way I'll either never talk to him again, or I'll magically go back in time and stay at Hogwarts for Christmas. Really, if I had just stayed this could have all been avoided till summer. I'd have had just
She gave me a box of one of my favorite Honeydukes sweets, Caramel Cobwebs. I smile, at least I still can be friends with Pansy when I go back. I know she's got my back. Same with Blaise. Even if Pansy's dating Hermione...
And last of all, there's Ron's gift. He gave me a large box of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. I snorted. It's such a

Harry shot her a smile, and then said, "I hope we meet again-" he glanced at her name tag. "Laila."

say yes, you’re being moved to Groomsmen. Okay, Blaise?”
I crawl over to my pile of presents, sighing. I dig through them, looking for names that aren't
“I... I think... I don’t know, Gorgeous. I... Harry will come around when he’s ready, right?” Hermione bits on her bottom lip, a habit of hers when she’s nervous. I lean down and search for my cigarettes in my bag. I pull one out and light it. I only smoke when I’m really worried. I really shouldn’t have done this, but when I look up, Hermione is sighing.
He looks at me, and then says, "Parkinson. Come with me. The Headmaster would like to see you."
I tighten my grip on my knife, and I lift it up to my forearm. I’ve cut a lot in the past few days… more than I probably should. I’ve lost a lot of blood. If I cared about it, I would probably cast a few healing charms. I cast one blood replenishing charm, but I’ve always been shit at healing charms. And I’m going to get lots of scars… not that I’ll be around much longer to look at them. I’ve been thinking about ending it. It seems easier than going on, like this. Much easier.
this is the one,” he said, feeling the rightness of saying that and agreeing with it.
“I… it’s been awkward, when I’ve talked to him. Either he leaves immediately, or we stand there, staring at the ground, not talking. He doesn’t look good, that I can tell you.”
Smut.
"We should go... the train is leaving soon." I jutted out my lower lip and pouted shamelessly, and Harry smirked. He detached himself from me, and I crossed my arms. His smirk widened, and he leaned in and gave me what was meant to be a short kiss. My hands immediately went to his hair, rooting him to the spot. I pushed my tongue into his mouth, and pulled his body onto mine. Harry lost himself in the kiss, but eventually had the sense to pull away. "Come on, Draco. We have to go. You'll miss the train."
to get over it!"
I was sure that I had never run this fast before. My legs were pumping, and I felt like I was flying. But that wasn’t the point.
a small voice said in the back of my head.
But I did it anyway.
Slytherins, aren’t we?”
Maybe I should just avoid him. That seems like the best option. Much better than my other choices...

hangovers, according to Draco.
That’s what best friends are for, after all.
Neville stood up, and walked to Malfoy. He just simply kicked Malfoy's crumpled up form, and walked in the direction that the Golden Trio had gone. Lots of Gryffindors (And a few Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs) (Most of the people from other houses that left were in the DA) got up and left. When Luna breezed past him, she said "I would insult you for hurting one of my five friends, but I can see the guilt eating you up inside... it's enough of a punishment for anyone. Good day to you, Draco. And be careful for Snacklepuffs. They're particularly vicious this time of year," she said in her dreamy, high, voice.

These were common thoughts for him, so it was no surprise that he was thinking about it right now.
Pansy looked up at me guiltily.
dear.” Draco shakes his head, and pulls his knees into his chest, wrapping his hands around them.
A short chapter, but an important one.
“Oh my god, guys. Why are we even doing this?” I ask Blaise, Crabbe, and Goyle. Crabbe and Goyle just laugh, and Blaise answers “Because it’ll be
” Another shake of the head.
So, what does it mean that his name is faded?
Pansy stopped for a second, calming down, deciding if she was going to agree with me, or beat me into a pulp.
Harry glanced over at Draco, who was sitting at the edge of the Slytherin table, all by himself. His head was lowered, so Harry couldn’t get a good look at his face, but he had come to the conclusion that Draco was just really
Draco’s my best friend, and this could potentially be really embarrassing for him. I mean, Draco’s already kinda sensitive, and I don’t want to push him too far.
“Aha! Right here.” She placed the key in the lock, twisted it, and then pulled the key out and set it in her pocket.
handwriting.
nice of you to show up!" my aunt said quickly, in her high-pitched, girly, over-excited manner. I nodded at her, still unsure of what I was seeing. I pushed my face into a cold mask. My father turned and faced me, as did my mother. When I looked at my mother's face I gave a small gasp. It wasn't audible, but I did it anyway. There were dark circles under my mother's eyes, and her face was creased with a worried and pained expression. "Draco." my father drawled in his cold manner, his eyes blank. I nodded, walking closer. "We have a very esteemed guest here, today." I nodded again. The tension was so thick in the air you could feel it. Everyone was tense, except for my Aunt Bella. She was smiling, seemingly excited. She was swishing her wand back and forth, a maniac smile on her face. I wondered again who was in the chair, but I kept silent. I was polite, like I was taught to be. Then, a high, cold, voice broke the silence. "Draco." I felt dread wash over me in a wave.
“Yeah, babe, I know. If he would even show

“MATE!”
Also, Draco’s memory takes place in Narcissa’s quarters, in her sitting room. He two, btw.
“Well-”
“so,”

hey guys! just a quick warning for this chapter - panic attacks, anixety, depression, and self harm. please don't read if this triggers you!
I've always wanted a Firebolt. Father says that I already have a good enough broom, no matter how much I beg. It's unlike him to not get me anything I want... but not unheard of.
More fun stuff next chapter :) a bit of humor, hopefully, lots of fluff, and a bit of angst, cuz wtf would this story be without angst. Love you all! ❤️
remember why you are here, our Welcome Witch will be pleased to help.
” I said, this time with more enthusiasm. Hermione rattled the handle again, and then shook her head.
"That little fucking ferret." Ron said as soon as we had sat down on my bed.
That's the only way to describe it. It's like my insides are coated with nothing, nothing, and more nothing. The silent tears are rolling down my face, and I think that I'm not even cutting straight.
“First of all, there’s
The bartender shook his head. "
He hadn’t really been thinking properly when he rushed past Harry and the fucking Weaslette, so, there he was, tumbling down the stairs. He tried to protect his head, because even though he had a death wish, he would rather not die of head related injury. Case closed. He let out a whimper when a sharp crack of pain flashed through his ribs, and started to wonder if he just hadn’t noticed how many stairs there were, or he was just falling really, really, slowly.
I can't ever fix it.
I look up at Hermione from my homework, and I furrow my brows.
Draco had stumbled across that spell in a book that was almost older than time itself. It came from the first Malfoys library. Draco thinks that the spell has been forgotten.
can get out of class with cramps. All of the male teachers just nod, look a bit sick, and then point to the door. It even works with Snape, for some reason. Actually, I know that there’s a potion to get rid of the pain, but for some reason the male teachers don’t seem to remember that. McGonagall does, though. She keeps it on a shelf behind her desk, and hands it to any girl who uses the excuse. If you watch, some girls gulp it down, and you know that they actually have bad cramps, and some just set it aside.
His arm was an angry red, and there were a few cuts. The blood mixed with the water, it ran red, and Draco couldn’t tear his eyes away from it.
AHHHHHHHHHHHH! I FINALLY did something right! I’m throwing happiness around like confetti rn. *throwing confetti* HAPPINESS TO YOU, HAPPINESS TO YOU, HAPPINESS TO- *hits some baby in the face* oops. My bad.

"Love you more."
"No, Pans. Sorry."
I struggled for something to do. My brain kicked in, and I pulled out my wand. “

“Harry,”
Ginny and Luna were a very unique couple, and they didn’t get jealous easily. Again, Gin was very much a physical person, and so was Luna, so they had gotten over the whole ‘You’re touching someone else? You’re
I suddenly wished that I had gotten sick this morning.
Angelina stopped at a door, and then said, “Well, I’m going to blindfold you, because I’ve noticed that Alphas tend to judge more by appearance than scent.” Harry said, “Yeah, okay.” Angelina flicked her wand, and he suddenly couldn’t see anymore. He heard a door click open, (Harry’s hearing was enhanced when he became an Alpha) and then Angelina (He assumed) grabbed his hand and led him through the doorway. He hit his hand on the side of the doorframe, and Angelina said, “Sorry!” and then cast a pain-relieving spell. (Which was expected, she was a Healer and all) Harry said, “S’okay,” then walked through the door. He sucked in a sharp breath, overwhelmed by the
“Thanks, ‘Mione.”
“See you, Gorgeous.” Hermione smiles, and then nods at Blaise. Ron just waves.
“Pansy, you literally have

bottom?
“What are we going to do about it?” I ask, looking into her eyes.
“That was hot… if I didn’t just knotted you I’ll probably fuck you again right now.”
He was now two fingers down, buried in the natural slick of Draco’s ass, the blonde’s hips shoving back for more of Harry's touch. Harry crooked his fingers, thrusting them a little, obtaining a chorus of gratifying sounds from Draco. In a blink of a eye he was pushing the third finger inside.
Slowly in the soft light he focused Harry’s silhouette.
Draco pushed backwards, trying to get as much of the fat dick inside of him as possible.
When he woke up Harry wasn’t there and he wasn’t in the same bed anymore, he struggled a little but a nice nurse told him he was at the hospital. He had a bad fever due to the stress and his organism was rejecting the suppressants. They took him into a special chamber and it was obvious why right away.
He couldn’t move much but he made the best of it giving little thrust against the omega prostate.
Some people have dreams about the moment when they met their soulmates.
Draco grabbed handfull of sheets and clenched on his cock hard as he can.
“Oooh, you mean free from my big, fat knot?” He thrust up and Draco gulped, it was exactly against his prostate. He could feel his cock hardening again but it was too soon, he was still sensitive.
But he wasn’t done.
He could just take it.
“Yes! No! Shit, fuck.”
He was alone.
The alpha fucked him through his second hard climax with low groans, both of them feeling it as they tied. Harry’s hips stuttered a bit, gradually slowing until he was just giving an occasional hard thrust between heavy pants. Harry’s hair was damp with sweat as he boneless sank down on Draco, he was heavy but the omega could handle it.
When the knot went down, Harry gave him another kiss on the shoulder and went out to start a bath. His alpha knew how to take care of him.
On his neck, Harry’s lips bent in a smile.
Draco was always so perfect around him, even when he was so loose due to all of the fucking they have been doing in the past days. The blond groaned softly, pushing back when Harry pressed forward. He loved him slowly, caressing him with his hands and his lips. He sucked new marks around Draco’s neck, already covered in purple spots, he gave special attention to their mate bite. He always did, even when they were in public he loved putting his hand on it to remind Draco and all of the world to who he belonged and Draco loved every second of it.
Draco tensed, and Harry with him.
“I wasn’t thinking straight after Bill got injured I felt so stupid worrying about my dress.”
Draco said something but it went lost in his moans, he wanted to make some sort of sarcastic remake; but Harry made it impossible still sucking hickeys against the thin skin of his collarbone, not with the way his other hand was now firm on Draco's ass, guiding him in a rhythm, fast bouncing on his erection.
Malfoy nodded, waiting.
Harry nodded, smiling wide. Hermione was right, his personality was 90% impulse. Malfoy smiled back.
"Sure. I'm jumping now though."
"It's…..hard to put into words everything I feel about that night."
He looked up.
"It was a close fight."
Malfoy laughed.
"Suddenly I quite admire Gryffindors."
"Shut up.", Malfoy scolded. Harry could tell he was holding back a smile.
She supposed she could respect that. Your followers won't ever consider betrayal if they know you can read their every thought.
Harry closed his eyes, and let himself fall backwards too. The wind rushed past his ears, and his robes flapped about him. The noise they made battled with the rush of the wind for dominance. He opened his eyes, and turned around, to see the ground rapidly approaching his face. He put a quick wordless cushioning charm on the ground right underneath him, and landed safely. He righted himself, and spread his arms and legs out. Just staring at the stars from down here felt amazing.
"Here, my lord." His father says, grabbing Draco's arm firmly, nearly digging his nails into Draco's skin and pulling him up from the chair. "Look up," His father demanded in a whisper. He does as he is told, only to be rewarded with a sense of fear.
"Nothing it's just... Blaise is uh, he might kill me for this, but he has this massive undying love for Neville." Draco informs with a smirk.
"Uh... You wanted to see me?" He asks.
"No, it was perfect." Blaise compliments, leaning towards Neville and kissing his warm red cheek. He leans away and grabs both of Neville's hands in his own and looks him in the eyes. "Neville... I love you. I really do. I didn't tell you in the letters because I was afraid, but I love you." He smiles brightly, "And it's alright if you don't say it back. I mean, I've had feelings for you for years and you've only had feelings for me for... months it seems. So, I get it."
"That's not it." Draco interrupts.
"I can't have that, you know this!" He whispers.
"I can do it myself for free this time! Then you won't be so stressed." Hunter suggests.
"You seem to have a security problem, Headmaster... How dare you stand where he stood?!" Harry shouts at him. "Tell them what you did! How you looked him in the eyes and killed him!"
"Uh..." He looks around and notices them right on the bedside table. "Here you go." He says, handing them to her.
"Fine. Just tell me, please." Harry pleads.
"Wow, I didn't know Blaise had such empathy for other people." Pansy says, a mischievious grin wide on her face.
"No, I'm perfectly fine. I'm simply speaking the truth."
He walked into Borgin and Burkes that Hogsmeade weekend, sighing heavily before he walked to the back, meeting the cold glare of his father.
They step into the Great Hall and they sit together. He makes a big mistake by looking around and catches sight of Blaise. Even though the boy was a manipulative little snake, his very essence captivated Neville, particularly at this moment. He had worn a dark green button up that was tucked into his black dress-pants and something about it made Neville feel strange inside. He watched as Blaise's lips curled up into a smug smile as he talked to Draco. Neville couldn't help but think, 'he is quite pretty.' Perhaps that's not the right word for a boy or perhaps Neville shouldn't be thinking that at all. But instead, he ignores those things because Blaise, after all, did look amazing. He just didn't notice until now.
Neville sighs, "Fine... Tell Luna I said bye."
He plopped himself onto his bed and took off his shoes.
"Because that is not the way to deal with things! If you never communicate anything, you'll never know what could've been."
"I want to make a toast!" Arthur Weasley announces, raising his glass in the air. "To our new friends, Draco and Blaise."
"How'd you find the secret entrance?" Hermione asks.
"Lovegood!" Blaise shouts, running towards her in a sprint. Luna turns around with a calm expression as Blaise stops in front of her, breathing heavily. "I need... your... help." He breathes out.
"No. You're misusing it. I don't think I will." Harry says.
Draco's POV:
"That was a... Boggart." Harry states. Draco diverted his gaze but he couldn't hide his red cheeks. "Let's go back to our room, ok?" Harry says, grabbing Draco's hand and pulling him up.
He looked up and... oh no. Not another one! Draco Malfoy stood at the bottom of the hall staring at him. Without a second thought he ran away and fast. Draco called after him, but he didn't stop. He found himself in front of the Hufflepuff common room, wondering how he turned up here.
"Well... I don't exactly know what it is... I mean, I've only ever had feelings for him." Neville says.
"What's wrong?" Luna asks calmly. "Is everything alright?"
Neville drops the sword on the ground and drops his arms to his side. He softly laughs and stares up at the blue sky. He clenches his fist and holds it up high in the air.
"We have guests!" Molly scolds.
"His parents are in the nut house!" Xavier chuckled, "And he cries about how bad he is at dancing and how his teeth looks. We can really get him with this shit!" Xavier laughs.
"Alright, Draco, the tests for love potions all came back negative..." Madame Pomfrey says before giving him a knowing smile. He blushes heavily. "No need to feel ashamed. However, I do have a theory, which means we must test it, of course!"
Blaise gasps and clutches his wand, but doesn't move at all.
Harry chuckles, "You speak the truth, Malfoy. Although... Hermione's parents are pretty nice and my cousin actually apologized to me before the war. But my Aunt and Uncle... yeah they're repulsive."
"I'm not dating Luna, for Merlin's sake!" Neville shouts out.
Harry's head pops up, "Huh? Oh... nothing I just..." He sighs, "I don't know who I am now." He nearly whispers.
"I have a question for you. This may be a bad time so, forgive me. Where did you find that bracelet?" Dumbledore asks.
Harry comes back soon with the same bottle he saw in Dumbledore's wrinkly hands just before Christmas.
He noticed him and perked up, "Hey!"
"Good. Thanks!" Blaise says, running away and towards the great hall to find Harry.
"Look, Nev, you're flying!" Blaise says with a bright smile.
When the doors to the great hall slammed behind them, Blaise's anger showed true.
For the first time in a while, he isn't jealous. He doesn't need to be the only one in a persons life. For the first time in a while, he is truly happy to see Neville and Hannah sitting together.
"It is done." Voldemort smiles. It took everything inside him not to grimace at his chilling smile. It didn't help that he was also trying to hide the throbbing sting coming right from the mark. He honestly thought he'd have to go through more than just this, but he didn't. Should that worry him?
He knew he shouldn't be going anywhere with any Slytherin, but something about Blasie intrigued him. "I'd love to!" He said, maybe a bit too happily.
"Really Harry... I'm sorry."
Neville sits in silence. How could someone go through this? How could a parent do that to their child? He scribbles angrily.
"Pick whatever bed you want, I don't care. Just don't make me come back here, I am dreadfully exhausted." Snape says before walking away and leaving them alone.
"Draco, my dear Draco." says the Dark Lord in the same quiet voice that makes you shiver. "Have you been working on my assignment for you?"
"Are you kidding?! Who cares about me?! The boy you've been pining over for years is dating you and you expect me to just return to what we were talking about before?"
"Holly berries," Draco says and the doors to the common room open.
"Uh... W-wh... I-" He grunts, "I'm an idiot!" He shouts at himself. Wait a minute, he only meant to think that! His breath hitches and he continues to hide his face.
"I can't get addicted to it. It's not like a drug or something."
Draco slowly looks over at Harry and jumps a little at how close they are.
Blaise picks up the bracelet, noticing it is now somehow dry. He gives it a sniff and closes his eyes. The smell made him feel warm and peaceful inside. Other than amortentia, he would say this was his favorite smell.
"Uh... Gryffindor?" Neville asked nervously. Nothing happened. He whined in agony. If he didn't get in there, he was doomed. He was sure of it.
"Ok, that's good. Let's go then." Hannah says awkwardly, getting onto her broom with Neville following shortly after.
Draco's POV:
"H-hey, Harry," Draco says nervously.
"You took something from me... I want it back."
"No! Oh God, no! I was actually assuming that..." Myrtle replied, looking away from Draco.
"How?" Neville asks.
"Harry."
"I can't! He has a girlfriend and he'll never love me back and even a tiny bit of physical contact with him ruins my ability to think and act correctly! I hate it." Blaise vents.
"Neville! I was wondering where you went! Blaise didn't hurt you or anything, right?" Hannah asks, holding her broomstick in hand.
"Hey Harry... I know this sounds stupid but go to McGonagall's office and ask for... essence of Lavender I think it is?" Blaise says. "And hurry, please."
"Why would asking you about your sexuality to be a problem?" His grandmother asks.
It all made sense now, the feeling he got when Harry took off his shirt, the happiness he felt seeing Harry get riled up, the rare happy feeling he got when Harry gave him attention, his constant need to be cool around Harry. It all made sense. Good Merlin! His stomach stopped doing leaps and began to sink low. Oh no, this is bloody madness!
Blaise sighs, "No... If they love each other I suppose I should leave it alone. I still hate her though."
"Hmm... Perhaps it's Romilda Vane?" Harry smirks.
"Goodness, Ronald, give it a rest! Ginny will do what she wants. She is practically grown now and you aren't her father!" Hermione scolds.
She had to get them together... but how? Veritaserum didn't work, but it sure did humiliate Neville. Speaking of... Everyone, especially in Slytherin house had been incredibly shocked when they saw Blaise and Neville all lovey-dovey. Everyone thought they were just friends, but not Pansy.
Draco sat beside Blaise in the great hall. "Hey, Blaise."
"Neville... you're going to get into more trouble." Blaise says.
"Blaise?" Neville asks. Blaise hums in response.  He takes a shaky breath and says, "I think I might... Love you."
"Floo powder! Or even apparation... Well, I might be bad at that too..." Neville trails off.
"I'm sorry for your loss. I really am. If you need to take the rest of the day off, you may do so." Dumbledore suggests.
"It'll definitely come to him. It's just... Slytherins wanting to be friends with a Gryffindor is strange. Neville even came to me for advice on whether or not to be Blaise's friend."
"Attacked me? Yeah. Well, techincally we both fought each other, but I never tried to do anything like this! There is no way that bloody troll is getting anything from me. Ever." Draco says, glancing down at the flowers and rolling his eyes. Flowers are overrated.
Blaise tried to shut it all out, but he just couldn't. He couldn't stop himself from hearing every word.
"Sure," Neville says. "Well, I should be getting back to the Gryffindor tower."
"Ronald!" Hermione scolds. "I think we should listen to Luna. If he is bad, we will be prepared to fight."
She apparates him home and puts a finger in his face. She only does that to scold him.
Blaise's head suddenly shoots up, "What?"
"You're upset. I can tell." A few students, two happened to be Gryffindors, passed and looked over at them. The smiled at them and walked away giggling. Neville sighed once more. "Ah, I see. It's the people upsetting you." Luna touches his shoulder comfortingly, "I understand, people can be mean."
He runs into the great hall, only to notice that most eyes were on him, some giggling and some gazing in disgust and dissapproval, at least that's what it looked like. Yet, he was filled with confusion. Why was everyone looking at him. Then, he caught sight of Neville who was right in front of Hannah Abbott, being one of the few not looking up at him, other than Draco and Harry. He was scratching his neck and staring down at his plate with a look of defeat.
"But..." Neville begins.
Shit, Draco thought. He completely ignored whatever Sprout had to say in Herbology today.
"You... could talk to me? You know... I've been having thoughts about the war too. I can't seem to sleep sometimes. Maybe we can talk about that together? You won't have to be alone."
"I love you."
"No, never. I never thought I'd even see you again." Blaise says, his voice cracking. He pulls away from Neville and looks into his eyes. "You have to go back home before your grandmother realizes you're gone."
"He will apologize to you and I will make him get you back on good terms with Neville." Draco promises.
Blaise rests his back on the wall in front of the Hufflepuff common room entrance, waiting for a certain Hufflepuff to come into view. After waiting for quite a while and getting dirty looks from many other Hufflepuffs, including Hannah Abbott, to which he gave a scowl right back at, the Hufflepuff he needed came into view.
They go back home and he searches around for his owl, hoping he came back with a note. Sadly enough, he found his owl but no letter. He sighs. Days like these are often dissappointing anyways. He should've known this would happen.
"Is it Ron?"
Neville's POV:
He notices Blaise open his mouth, then close it back again. Then open his mouth once more, tilt towards Neville and whisper very softly, "Hey, uh... I never really thanked you for picking up my stuff yesterday."
Blaise reaches into the bag, taking out the beans and one cauldron cake before handing the rest to Neville.
Harry put one foot on the broom, and then another. He wobbled slightly, so he spread his arms out in a vain attempt to balance himself. Vain, because as soon as he did that, Malfoy snatched his hands and held them. He'd walked around to the other side of the broom, facing Harry.
"He'd put me under a Petrificus Totalus. I couldn't move. I couldn't speak. I was there, under my invisibility cloak. Do you have any idea how it feels to be so utterly and completely powerless? To just watch one of the things you love the most be taken away from you? Right in front of you! And you can. Do. Nothing. It's in your power! It was in my power to change that! I could've saved him! I could've done something! Anything. Just."
"I was a coward."
Now, it was Draco's turn to stare.
Harry laughed.
Malfoy smiled. They were sitting with their backs facing the room, their legs hanging precariously over the edge. All of a sudden, Malfoy stood up.
Hagrid was stood outside his hut, a cup of tea in his hand. For some reason, drinking tea all alone in his hut never felt right anymore. So, he'd come out, and stare at the forbidden forest. His hut was close to the edge, so it wasn't like he could spot anything significant from where he stood. Yet, the thought of all the magical creatures who reside there, the mere thought of their presence, was a huge source of comfort to him.
"I don't think standing on a narrow wall is safe."
Sure.
He stepped off his broom elegantly.
Soft tears were trailing down his cheeks. It was the first time in a while he'd felt himself cry. He closed his eyes. He was startled to feel a hand on his face wiping away the tears.
Sometimes she didn't even want to think about the situation she was in. She'd been trained in occlumency by her mother during the war, so rationally, she knew no one could read her thoughts, invade her privacy, know what she was really thinking about. And yet, that phantom fear remained. The dark lord had been especially good at legilimency, and no thought had been her own, for a very long time.
"I think trying wouldn't hurt."
"Yeah."
Let me know what you guys thought of this chapter! I look forward to hearing from you all!
"That was a horrible pun."
He wished he knew how to help Harry. Moreover, he wished Harry would let him help him. Feeble hope.
Yet, yesterday, Hermione was over the moon. She told him all about Harry and Malfoy's so-called friendship. Of course Hagrid didn't trust that. Wars changed people, but he'd never heard of enemies becoming best friends overnight. Hagrid doubted the friendship would last, but for Hermione's sake, he kept that particular thought to himself. She was always more happy for good things in other people's lives than her own, and he had no intention of raining on her parade.
And with that, he was gone.
Harry rolled his eyes.
"It was entirely unintentional, I assure you."
"Do you know what an unbreakable bond is?"
Harry was startled. He blinked, uncertain what to expect. All of a sudden, Malfoy seemed to deflate. He sighed.
"You are the boy who lived, after all. Got to live up to that right?"
Malfoy took in a breath. He probably hadn't known. How would he have?
Maybe. Maybe, if this friendship wasn't just a fleeting thing. Maybe, if it lasted. Maybe, if it made Harry happier. Ah, what he wouldn't do to see that poor child smile truly again. Maybe, if all that happened, Hagrid reasoned, he would consider giving Slytherins a chance. Malfoy, on the other hand, that would take much longer.
"I think about him. That night. All of it. It's hard to forget. There's so many things I've seen, sometimes I think it'd be so much easier if I could forget a lot of it, y'know? I've often thought about what life would be like if I could do everything over. I don't know if I'd change what I did. Would I be a bad person if I did? I mean, I did save some lives, but a lot of them were lost too, right?"
It was the early hours of the morning. Pansy was in the common room, like always. Not a lot of Slytherins were awake this early in the morning, especially on the weekends. She liked the peace and quiet.
Malfoy turned to face him, understandably startled. "Don't you mean murdered?"
"I know, it's a talent."
Walking back from quidditch practice, Ron was wondering if he knew his friends at all. He thought he'd known what Hermione wanted when he'd asked her out. He'd loved her truly, and he'd always believed she loved him back. It wasn't hope, it was concrete belief. To have it shattered, and in such a monumental way, was like a punch to the gut. He'd questioned for weeks and weeks, how much he knew her.
"Somehow, you make that sound like an insult."
"That's it?"
"Doesn't it help with balance?"
I didn't say it was.
"Have I ever told you how much I admire the fact that you're not superficial in the slightest?"
"I'm so sorry."
He realised with a certain sense of disorientation that he was already sitting on his bed again. Muscle memory at this point, the walk from the grounds to the gryffindor tower.
Harry took his time explaining their trip to the cave in the middle of the ocean, and the ring. Malfoy looked him straight in the eyes the entire time, like if he stared hard enough, he could figure out if Harry was telling the truth.
Malfoy raised his voice unexpectedly.
It's due in 4 weeks!
He wasn't there. He'd just gotten up and walked away.
She couldn't stay whining forever. Sure, self-pity felt good, but it wasn't a good indulgence. Everyone had it hard, she wasn't alone. She startled at the sound of footsteps. Well, nothing to worry about. Only one person would be returning this early in the morning.
A beat of silence. The wind whistled through their hair. They were sitting on the wall of a balcony looking out at the grounds, on the topmost floor. Evidently, the exact place from where Dumbledore fell to his death. Maybe that's what prompted Harry to start this conversation in the first place. Of course, they'd sat here before. He'd never quite plucked up the courage to ask earlier, though. So much for being a gryffindor.
Hermione had often scolded him for being prejudiced. One Slytherin did not represent all Slytherins, she repeated every so often. Coming from anyone else, he wouldn't have paid any heed to that advice. But, coming from a muggleborn witch, who'd been at the receiving end of countless barbs, from the day she set foot at Hogwarts? Her words had a different sort of value.
"You don't mean…?"
"No? I was a natural with the sitting on it and flying bit, so I figured I wouldn't test my luck after that."
He didn't know any other way to ask the hard questions rather than just asking them head on. They'd both just be sat in silence, probably just in their own heads. Harry would begin to worry. That wasn't the point of this. The whole point of meeting up was not to be alone in this. So, his impulse would get the better of him, and out of the blue, he'd ask something bold like, "Do you ever think about the night Dumbledore died?"
Writing up the three feet for charms.
"I let him die, Malfoy."
Harry opened his eyes. Malfoy was looking away again. Maybe it was a habit.
A feeble attempt at humor. It wouldn't work.
Malfoy sighed. Good. Harry was getting through.
Malfoy offered him a hand, and he stood up.
"You know, if it makes you feel any better, he was dying anyway."
"This was my home. I belonged here just as much as anybody else. And they wanted me to murder, to take a life, right here. I was never overly fond of Dumbledore, but to kill him? Until then, everything was just we're good, they're bad, and we're going to win in the end. It was never real for me until then. I thought I'd be far away from all the fighting. The responsibility to take a life, kill a soul. It's just too much. I couldn't handle it."
"You don't?"
And now, he felt like he was going through the same thing again with Harry. When he'd started leaving late at night, Ron had been a little worried. Of course, he'd known. Harry's attempts to muffle the noise were useless. Being on the run had turned Ron into a light sleeper, and now he couldn't shake off the habit. He'd told Hermione, and she'd been worried too. She'd tried to help the best way she knew how, which was to approach the concerned authorities, and inform herself about insomnia. She'd insisted Harry see a mind healer for PTSD, but he'd refused. He wasn't ready to talk about all that with someone who wasn't there. He was right, thought Ron. He didn't doubt countless people would even go so far as to pretend to be mind healers, just so they could get the "inside scoop". Scum of the earth.
Before the war, she was a completely different person. Loud, boisterous, always wanting to be the center of attention. Now? It was like someone had punched the life force out of her. She was always tired, always running short of time. She always thought she'd been rather good at time management, but boy, was she wrong about that.
This budding friendship was making him reminisce about his own past. It was the fault of a certain Slytherin head boy that he'd been banned from using magic for years together. If it wasn't for Dumbledore, he might never have survived at all. A half giant who couldn't even use magic. Who would want to employ him?
Harry had about as much tact as a door-to-door salesman. It wasn't his fault he was this bad at conversation, he reasoned. When you spend the majority of your childhood in a cupboard, the socialising opportunities just never seemed to pop up. Strange.
That still wasn't enough. It was painful, walking the corridors with those hateful stares fixed at you permanently. The "accidental" curses thrown her way, the silent treatment from many friends in different houses from before the war, and surprisingly, even from the teachers. So much for being unbiased.
"I'm glad you can see the humor in this, Potter."
He'd tried to help Harry in his own way. He'd tried to talk, but he had a gnawing feeling Harry didn't trust him anymore. He regretted it everyday, the fact that he left. It was the ultimate act of betrayal, and in Harry's place, Ron wouldn't trust himself either. But he was trying, he really was. He wanted to be there for Harry, now. It seemed to him like Harry needed him, but he refused to let him in. It was all his own fault, he knew that. But why couldn't Harry move past it? For 8 years, he'd trusted him, been right by his side, always agreed to everything he'd asked. Why did one act have to change everything?
He covered his cock in his sleek before pressing inside him going all out since the start.
Harry leaned forward closing his teeth on their bond mark; he also had one now, even if it wasn’t usual for omegas to mark their alpha he pleaded Draco to do so so now they matched.
He rested there, feeling boneless with Harry hard breath on his neck.
“I think this is a terrible idea.” Said Draco determined.
The omega was his.
“Than that’s has to stop,” said Harry determined “next time I leave you will come with me!”
The night before he was supposed to be released someone barged into his room startled him.
The day they mate. The moment Harry's teeth closed on his neck, all of Draco's worries were washed away.
She let out an excited yelp and thrown his arms around his neck almost making him spill it.
“I think this is a terrible idea.” Said Draco determined.
If the Chosen one was really that dumb they were all doomed.
Some people have dreams about the moment when they met their soulmates.
“You are so hot.” Said Harry with a deep rough voice which made Draco tremble, his gaze was black with lust and want, his pheromones so strong that he had to bare his neck in submission.
He groaned when Harry took one between his lips and suckled hard, pulling the flesh deep into his mouth, swirling his tongue around, raking his teeth over it. The smaller man shook and shuddered from Harry's ministrations, his body on fire already.
A kid, possibly more than one, to build their family together and he wanted to give it to him. He would give Harry an army of kids as far as his body would let him.
Harry strengthened his grip on the omega chasing his orgasm. He could fell it building, his slowed his pace to put more intensity in his thrust trying to get his knot inside.
Thirty minutes in the cabin and Draco was already squirming under Harry’s hands. They didn’t even make it to the bed, Harry pushed him against the tub’s wall to kiss him while he tried to take a bath, and now he was already working him open.
“Be mine…”
Draco fell on his knees trembling like a leaf. An arm circled him and the strong smell of alpha wrapped him. Suddenly everything was alright, he felt safe for the first time in years.
The world flipped when Harry left the wall and let go of him on the blankets, he was on him in a flash resuming the wild kissing. Wild magic was running in the air, Draco could hear things hitting the ground in the room, thrown off by primal magic with no form or intent. Harry was glowing with it.
Harry took advantage of it more than once.
“One day,” he growled, “you will be mine!”
Draco woke up to the sensations of a hot mouth closing on his lobe. A wet tongue lap the area beneath, trying to slip under his collar, no that there was any chance, magic glued it to his skin. Lips came in tracing his neck.
His alpha suddenly decided it was wrong, so he grabbed firmly the hot body and it turned him. He crawled over him kissing the place he was going to bit really soon.
“Ron, you got everything?” Asked Granger eagerly.
The auror whispered a weak levitate spell just o lift his body enough to push a pillow under his hips.
Being buried knot-deep inside Draco forced him to lessen his movements to a slower rutting, a small winding of his hips that made the bulbous knot to soothe back and forth against wrecked prostate.
In the background, his rational self remind him that it was Draco’s first heat since the suppressant, it was impossible for him to get pregnant, his body was still getting ride of the chemicals.
“You can, is recorded. I think Hermione convinced the press to assume a more muggle line of action, there were some cameras. One day that girl is going to shred the secrecy act, I’m telling you.”
Draco whined, his omega had been responding to Harry’s unlashed alpha making him beg to be breed. A voice, far away, tries to tell him he is not even in heat but the instinct to mate was too strong.
The knot was swelling, Draco could feel it against his rim but Harry didn’t seem ready to push it inside.
Under all of this there was that little voice in Draco’s head that whispered to him in the lonely hours he spent alone at Grimauld’s place that Harry could literally have anyone now. While he was there tendering the house Harry could have been meeting another omega, or a beta, or even an alpha just perfect and realise that Draco was not the one for him, that he wasn’t worthy.
Draco thrashed his head back and forth cradling him and shook harder, the intensity of the pleasure washing over him, pushing at him. He was dangling over the edge now the risk to fall back pumping adrenaline into his body, Harry's cock taking him to that incredible place where there was nothing but pleasure.
As Draco tensed and Harry’s alpha squirmed. He wanted nothing more than knot the omega and claim him but not if that meant hurting him. The brunette kissed his nape gently.
Of course that's doesn't include Draco. You can skin people but you better don't touch his omega.
Probably unconsciously Harry was growling against his earlobe. The way the alpha was completely lost to his need made him wet and horny, and eager to be breed.
The day after he didn’t know what to expect out of the room they gave him. It was a weird house, built-in height and totally against any physic’s law. They called it The Burrow. Turn out he didn’t have anything to worry about. As Hermione told him afterwards, Harry gave everyone a lecture about him, he told them he gave up on killing Dumbledore and that he deserved the benefit of the doubt. Not all of the adults agreed but then Harry became stone-cold and gently told them that could either leave Draco alone or defeat the Voldemort themselves.
“Draco, am I so boring that your mind is free to wander?” Cranking Draco’s hips upward and palming the globes of his ass, Harry spread him out and reached deeper. Not satisfied he did it again nailing his prostate so hard that Draco had to hold to the couch behind Harry to stay upright.
He almost chuckled at the though snuggling in Draco’s neck as the omega slowly slipped into sleeping.
That’s the reason because most of the guests didn’t spare him a glance. What it did surprise him was the number of people who accepted his story and forgave him. First of all Weasley.
Harry reached so deep inside him that Draco could swear he could feel it in his stomach.
Next time he woke up something was off.
Draco was gone, completely out, Harry hold him close enjoying the comforting sensation of their new bond. His alpha was pumped with pride for knotting his omega that now was safe and warm in their nest.
“Sleepy.” He said stretching his neck a little to have a kiss. Harry ruffled his hair before going to the bathroom to clean a bit.
Slowly Draco started to breath again, his hand reaching for Harry, the alpha grabbed his fingers pinning him on the blanket.
The day his life changed was in the middle of August.
Finally, Harry slammed in steading his balls pulsing as he started shooting semen. Draco screamed painting the sheets with his pleasure.
Draco wasn’t sure to stay this close when they were on the run, by he changed his mind after Harry took him in a wild part of the north-Norway, where they rented a car to reach a small luxurious cabin deep in the forest, a place where they could forget everything but themselves.
“I know, I can smell it.”
“I bet it was amazing. I wish I could have see it.”
“I love you too.” He whispered in the night.
“I would let the world burn Potter, but I’m under the impression that you wouldn’t last three days.”
The omega was delirious, his body divided between overstimulation and the need to come.
Seriously, if you are reading this story for the sweetness brace yourself because Harry's going to loosing it (also Draco will loose the big V).
He took out the fingers grabbing the white legs around him so strong he probably left signs, at least his alpha hoped so.
"It's the girl's bathroom."
"Who is your subject, oh mighty Parkinson?"
"You've got to be-"
Blaise nods, "Thank you again." He smiles softly.
"Do you have nothing better to do, Malfoy? I said shut up. Can you even hear?!" Harry remarks.
"You dare to lie to him?!" He whispers, "If he finds out you've lied me and your mother can die! Do you understand the danger you've put us in you idiot!"
"No... you didn't." Draco says quietly. Blaise notices a rare tear fall from Draco's eye.
"My sister?! Are you kidding?! Best mates don't date each other's sisters!" Ron shouts.
"Thank you for being my friend." Blaise says with a sad smile. They both embrace each other in a tight hug and Blaise can feel Draco softly sobbing, but he doesn't say a word. Instead, he begins to sob with him. After all, this is the first real hug he has gotten since he was five years old.
She laid on her bed at home thinking about how to possibly get those two together. First, she had to figure out if Harry liked Draco back, even though she was positive he did. She couldn't be sure though.
"I've been looking for you everywhere!" He locks eyes with Harry who sits beside him. "I need to talk to you."
"What?! No!" Neville almost shouts, his face now burning red.
Harry detaches their lips and kisses his cheek, then his jawline. The hair on Draco's arm stands up as Harry's lips reach his neck. Draco closes his eyes and allows the moment to take over him.
Draco sneers at her, "Go away." He says. He glanced over at Harry, trying to be discreet. He saw Harry looking at him and Harry quickly looked away. How strange.
"You're right, my bad." Neville replies with a smile.
"I snuck out! She won't let me see you so I took matters into my own hands." Neville replies with a smirk.
Neville wandered off, looking at the milk chocolate wands. Blaise smiled and made his way toward the Cauldron Cakes. He grabbed a few as well as Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans before walking back towards Neville, struggling to hold it all in hand.
"That's so wonderful that you are safe and happy! That makes me happy! For me, yes I am safe. I'm at home with my grandmother. I still think about my father sometimes which upsets me, but I can always pull through. Your bracelet also has helped keep me calm through these times, especially after Dumbledore's death and being afraid of not only my life but my friends and families lives. But it's really kept me from going crazy. Thank you for that by the way. And the blanket has kept me warm! I also forgot to compliment you on those cookies. And don't worry about that, I don't mind you being a boy. Actually, I've been trying to figure things out about myself recently and it makes me feel pretty weird and disgusting. Anyways, enough about me. How is your friend? What does it look like there? How do you feel?"
"Yeah... I do." Blaise rubs the back of his neck, "Not to mention... It's a boy..." Blaise admits, staring down at the table before them.
"But... I tortured you for years, I threatened you in the Room of Requirment, I beat you up in class, and I joined the Dark Lord. There are many other things I did... Not to mention I tortured your friends too. All for some petty rivalry." Draco says.
They have two children, the oldest being Rose Granger-Weasley, the other being Hugo Granger-Weasley. Rose and Hugo were both sorted into Gryffindor.
Blaise laughs, "It was a joke!"
In the great hall, Draco didn't eat and instead observed. There was no possible way he could eat after what's happened in the past week. Knowing what he's going to have to do only soils his appetite.
"Yes?" Blaise asks, the tiny bit of hope he held onto fluttered inside him.
He scolds himself for what he's about to do next, but does it anyways.
"Draco, where are you?!" Harry shouts. Oh no.
"So... he likes me? He actually likes me? Like... more than a friend?"
"Harry, you'll never guess who killed the last Horcrux." Ron says and Harry simply gives him a look of confusion.
Blaise stays behind for a little while the rest walk out, up until Snape shouts, "Out!"
Harry scoffs, "Get off it!"
He knew instantly where he needed to go.
"What?"
"Blaise, get up now! Something's wrong." Harry urges.
His grandmother talks to his mum first. "Hello, my Alice. We missed you so much."
He walked out to see Blaise walking fast towards the steps and he runs towards him.
"That would be a great idea! We'll all go to the Burrow tomorrow and set it up. Hopefully Mr. Weasley won't be upset with a Malfoy being at his house... but I'm sure I can help him understand the situation. It would be good for him and all of us!" Harry suggests.
"Thank you! I love it here as well." Dumbledore says with twinkling eyes and a warm smile. It almost made Neville calm down, almost.
"The vanishing cabinet... In the room of requirement." Draco informs.
"About what exactly?" Draco asks.
"Alright, then... Don't get mad at me but... Is it a boy or a girl?" Blaise whispers.
Luna looks at her and smiles, "Good. If I know anything, he will be looking for Neville."
"I will be." Draco says, not sure about that himself.
"Oh... Wait, did you say him?" Neville asks. He would've been freaking out, but he couldn't seem to feel anything.
"We'll let you two talk alone." Neville says, letting go of Blaise's hand, giving Blaise a smile and walking away with Luna and Harry following closely behind.
They had taken Luna Lovegood not too long ago along with many others. They assumed that if they kept his friends prisoner, he'd have no other choice but to show up right here. Then they'd call the Dark Lord and Harry Potter would die.
"I'm doing it to help you. I... I care about you. It may sound stupid and absolutely not true, but I'm not lying! I care about you a lot. Even if I thought you were a prat all year I kept thinking about that boggart incident... And uh..." Harry pauses for a while, "It just bothered me and made me worry about you. And that look you had at your house... I didn't wanna believe it but all I could see was fear. I really wish I could've helped you earlier. It's terrible to be forced into things and have a whole life planned out for you that you don't want. You know, we have a lot more in common than you'd like to admit."
Draco's eyes widen, "No! No, I need to hear it from you. Who's your boyfriend?"
"Go up to him and tell us if that is Harry Potter." His Aunt demands and he obeys. He slowly makes his way to the boy, kneeling down in front of him.
Draco's POV:
"You were upset he didn't like you so you got your revenge... Huh, impressive." The boy replies.
"I will answer that question another time. For now, I want to know more about these feelings. But first off I want to tell you that you didn't make things awkward and second, you shouldn't feel ashamed of liking boys. It's completely normal. My friend likes boys as well! I actually think I like both boys and girls. Either way, it's completely normal and you shouldn't be disgusted. It won't make things awkward to talk about this stuff with me at all. I mean, I really wished I had someone to vent to when I was thinking the same things. It's hard to do it alone, so I'm here to help you. Vent away, dear Neville."
Hannah reaches into her jacket and pulls out a crochet toad. "It's not much, but I know you have Trevor so I assumed you liked Toads." She smiles nervously.
Maybe that is it! He just hasn't had enough physical touch in his life. That's all it is. Now he can stop worrying about it.
"Of course not, especially not Hermione. If it would make you feel better, I'll threaten to hex Ron if he tells." Harry jokes.
Draco walks to a secluded spot and sits down on a bench. "Continue please."
"No, no Professor, you must understand that can't possibly happen," Harry says.
He caught sight of Blaise and began to blush. He didn't know why but just the sight of Blaise made him feel all weird inside. Maybe it's because of how scary Blaise looked. He was skinny, but he was too skilled at hexes and curses to cross him.
Blaise smashes his lips onto Neville's. He stands there, shocked that Blaise would do that so spontaneously. After a few seconds, he begins to kiss back.
"You know... You are quite beautiful." Harry whispers.
"T-thank you, Professor," Neville says, leaving his office at that.
Right now he had to focus on having a good excuse for his father. Maybe, if he negotiates enough, he can try to stay here for the break and finish his assignment before anyone gets back. But, knowing his father, he would definitely want him home. Especially considering he's failed his task, forgot about it for weeks, and has managed to become even more of an embarrassment by being defeated by Harry Potter. He really was afraid to go home for all of those reasons, but he had no choice.
Neville does the same, trying to remind himself that he can fly. He can fly. They kick off and fly through the air. Neville tries not to stop to look at the scenery around him, although it was beautiful. His grandmother was going to be furious.
"Fine! I'm handsome now stop it!" He giggles.
"No, I... I really do like it here. It's just..." Draco feels the tears coming back and stops.
"W-what?" Neville asked fearfully, quickly glancing at Blaise only to look away once more. The room suddenly felt warm. He didn't like it at all.
"What, golden boy?" Blaise mocks.
"I'm not trying to tease you about it, Draco. I want you to admit it!" Blaise says.
"We have Defense Against the Dark Arts again soon... We have to get to class." Goyle reminds him.
Blaise simply nods and walks out of the cozy office and into the cold hallways of Hogwarts.
George Weasley simply ignores it and shoves more food into his mouth. Other people might've thought it was gross, but Draco saw it as hilarious and admirable. They didn't have a care in the world.
Blaise's POV:
"No it doesn't... I mean, we were starting to become friends and then..."
Blaise gags, "Eww!"
He didn't think that through either... "I already told you! I heard crying so."
He did just that, but it only made it worse. The more he tried to breathe normally the worse it got.
"No, you apologize, Harry. Draco hasn't said a word." Dumbledore says, peering at Draco with his pale blue eyes. Draco tenses up. "No need to feel threatened. I'm here to help you, not harm you, Draco." Dumbledore gives him a smile.
They were fighting, every single one of them. All Blaise could hear was screaming, banging, and crashing. He couldn't find Neville. He tried to stay close to him and make sure he could save him if he needed to. He had him close by, but now he was gone. He ran through the halls, fighting off any caster who came in his way. He was able to knock some of them out pretty quickly, but others he had to take his time to duel.
"Look at that, Neville! Maybe now you'll stop complaining about that pathetic blanket." Seamus remarks, but Neville didn't listen.
A couple of girls looked his way and giggled, making him feel extra self-conscious. To be honest, he just wanted to leave. The great hall was one of the worst places in Hogwarts, other than Snape's classroom.
Blaise grabs his hand and pulls him up, "You may have to get some extra help with landing."
"So, what happened?" He asks Draco.
"Uh... well... First of all, I want a promise." Blaise says. Luna simply looks at him with her eyebrow raised, so he continues. "I want you to promise that nothing we speak about is repeated." Blaise says.
"Isn't that something your father taught you? I've met the man before, and he is no picnic. I may have been mad at you before, but in all reality, you only did all of that because you were taught to hate!" Myrtle says, rubbing his back.
"First of all, just call him Voldemort. Second, I forgive you. Some of those things you had to do to survive. But, I would appreciate an apology to Ron, his family, and Hermione. As well as any other Gryffindors you bullied."
"Oh no," Luna says and runs into her home. They all follow after her.
"I'm sorry," Blaise says, giving Neville a soft glance. "I-if it makes you feel better... W-we can be slow friends, ya know. Maybe I can prove to you that I have good intentions." He suggests.
She drops Hermione to the floor. She grunts in pain and attempts to get back up.
He grabs his fork and stabs it into the pie. He shovels the piece into his mouth and nods in approval.
Huh? Was this some part of a sick fantasy Potter had? No way.
"Oh..." Blaise stares at his shoes. "I'm sorry... I don't mean to scare you."
"Good." Draco glances down and notices a large snake slithering across the floor towards the Dark Lord as he moves around the room as if he was floating. To his loyal followers it would look beautiful, but to Draco it was something that would haunt him until he dropped into his grave.
Neville tapped his foot anxiously as he waited for potions class to start. He noticed McGonagall stepping in and speaking to Snape, who simply rolled his eyes and glanced at Neville. He hated that. Every time Snape looked at him he felt a sense of dread. He just had a feeling Snape wanted him dead. To be fair, he wanted himself dead too.
Harry looks at him with wide eyes. "Oh, hey Draco!" He says nervously.
"Well, if this person is who I'm thinking it is... I think you two would've been cute."
"Dang, Zabini..." Draco says, "I didn't know you loved someone."
"Well... goodnight." Neville says, climbing into his bed and covering himself up with his thin, skinny blanket. He'd had it for years, so he never threw it away. However, he did still wish he had something better to cover himself with, but his grandmother didn't have the money to buy a better one, at least not at the moment. The most they could buy was food and the cost to stay in their home.
"What don't I understand?!"
"Alright. Step inside before the door closes." He says, urging him inside the room. His eyes scan the room and catch sight of Luna's light blonde hair.
Neville's POV:
Harry stares at him with wide eyes, "Uh..."
"Really now? Then why were you friends with Draco?" Neville asks angrily.
"What are you whining about, Potter?" Draco teased.
"Uh... I just... You scared me." Draco says softly.
Hunter gives him a strange look, but still smiles. "I can see why she says the bargyles love you. Not many Slytherins want to do that on their own..." Hunter trails off. Before Blaise can get offended, Hunter speaks up again, "Well... we have to get past those house-elves. The only way we can and have enough time to cook is if it's during the Yule ball... What do you say, Zabini?"
He debates with himself for a long time on whether or not to tell Neville that he does indeed love him, very much. After almost an hour of not wanting to respond, he writes:
"Harry... I mean! I mean um Potter..." He says nervously.
As if on cue, Luna passed Blaise. He didn't fail to give her a glare as she traveled by. Draco watched as she tapped Neville on the shoulder and handed him a plate of cookies. Neville smiled at her and said a few words. She nodded back and skipped away towards the Ravenclaw table. Draco looked over to notice Blaise's hand softly shaking.
"Zabini?! Luna, how mad are you?!" Ron asks her.
"Oh... It isn't a girl is it?" Harry smirks.
"I'm sorry... You can go back to sleep now, I'll be quiet." Harry promised.
Neville picks it up and notices it's quite heavy. He takes it to an empty table and undoes the bow. He notices a few of his acquaintances follow him. He reads the note which says: "Merry Christmas, Neville. I hope you get all the presents you wish for this year. In fact, I had asked some of your friends to help me with this very special gift to give to you, so perhaps you will find something you have needed. Inside there will be another note. I would prefer you read it away from wandering eyes."
"Yes. I told him everything and he plans on talking with you when he gets here. Well, he said whenever you wake up, but you're awake now so..." Harry informs.
George Weasley still continues to grieve the loss of Fred, but runs Weasley's Wizard Wheezes like normal. Ron and Ginny help him run the business so he doesn't get too stressed. He continues to take counseling after being urged by Harry to do so. He also remains single but helps out Molly and Arthur at home because they're getting older every day. Although, it does make him happy to be around his parents and be able to help them out any way he can.
"Oh, hello." He jerks his head in the direction of the new voice that just entered. He blinks back the tears when he notices it's his Aunt Bellatrix. She smirks and stands behind him. "Well done, dear nephew."
