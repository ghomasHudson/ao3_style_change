, Pansy, are you sure?
Draco wants to hide Harry from the stares, to turn away and hold him until the tarry blackness covering his mind has gone. He feels it: Voldemort’s stain all throughout Harry. He has wrecked Harry’s logic, putting in place only implacable fear and loathing. But Draco doesn’t know what to say that Voldemort’s pollution wouldn’t turn Harry against him, so he grits his teeth and holds Harry closer, ignoring the dull kicks and scratches.
by the people around them. It doesn’t make sense—does his father not go out for numerous meetings with this and that committee? Are owls not arriving with dinner and party invites every other day? Pansy has made a mistake, calling his family odd. He isn’t so sure he is so eager to make her acquaintance now.
Neville raises it up to his face, squinting. ‘I don’t know. Do you think—’
Borgin quailed, twisting his hands together. ‘Yes, but –’
? And you were a Horcrux? A living being?’
He raises a trembling hand to his hurting ear. He had cast a rudimentary healing spell, but the explosion has ripped it open again. ‘
He only needs to know that being Harry Potter’s soulmate means that his strength does not only mean hurting the people around him; it can be useful. He leans in and says with a smirk: ‘Not so scared now that I’m here, eh, Potter?’
‘Ron!’ his mother snapped. ‘Language.’
‘Tosser,’ Draco breathed.
‘He wasn’t when you killed him,’ Draco snarls. ‘He died trying to destroy
‘All right,’ Draco says softly. ‘Will you be home tomorrow? We could make pancakes for breakfast.’
‘Do you? So why did you stop visiting me in prison, Potter?’
He wanted to laugh, remembering how vehemently he had told Malfoy he didn’t like blokes.
‘Well, it does not matter in the end, I suppose,’ Lizzy says firmly, setting aside Darcy’s letter. ‘For he is a Muggle, and I will not give my magic up for anyone.’
‘Good afternoon,’ she says in the poshest voice Harry has heard outside of the telly. ‘It has been a while since we last met, cousin.’
‘What’s that letter? Is it your parents? Are they all right?’ Myrtle asked worriedly.
McGonagall strides forwards, taking the Hat from him, and says briskly: ‘Welcome to Gryffindor, Malfoy.’ She gestures him towards the Gryffindor table, smiling not unkindly.
,’ Draco says triumphantly. ‘You are the single most powerful creature—human or otherwise—in this entire fucking world. You are
he wonders in despair.
“Would that suffice?” Draco continued.
‘You don’t have to apologise,’ Harry forced a grin. ‘I do like blondes. I should go. Saturdays are your busiest days, aren’t they? Say hi to George and Kate for me.’
As suddenly as the pain appears, it disappears, and Draco can breathe again, albeit with bewilderment.
She hesitated, blue eyes flicking up and down his face. Then she shook her head and took him by his arm. ‘Come on.’
‘I knew you were coming,’ Harry says. ‘My wand—do you know it heats up whenever you’re near? It has a core of Veela hair.’
Narcissa Malfoy leaves with Bellatrix Lestrange’s body—Andromeda refuses to even look at it—but Draco stays by Harry’s side, his claws and wings still splattered with blood. He doesn’t speak, and growls at anyone who comes too close. Harry doesn’t mind, because when the wailing rises to the rafters of the Great Hall, where their fallen heroes are laid, he is desperate for any distance he can get.
‘Sirius—’ Remus puts a restraining hand on his mate’s arm.
‘Do you think you could carry us out?’ Harry asks, gesturing to the still form of Ginny. ‘She’s fine, I think. Riddle didn’t manage to suck all her life out.’
All around them, the castle walls wailed, the lamps flickering. Intermittently, he heard whoops and screams and shouts. The sounds of fights echoed down corridors, warped and twisted by distance; it was like a horde had descended upon Hogwarts.

It has been four years since Harry laid eyes upon Malfoy, when Harry spoke in defence of the wizard at his trial before the Wizengamot. The outcome was Malfoy’s freedom from the chains of Azkaban, where he was imprisoned for a year on exaggerated counts of war crimes. Malfoy cut a pitiable figure then: a skeletal, cowering creature with starving eyes that pierced Harry’s chest. He was not to be compared to the haughty, mean bully Harry knew from school, and both iterations are unimaginable in the light of the Malfoy they behold now.

Dean turns crimson, dropping his spoon into his soup, as the rest of them sniggers, Ron whooping loudly. Seamus and Dean have taken up a cautious sort of flirtation: Dean seems unwilling to risk their friendship, while Seamus makes his desire very explicit. It has provided frivolous entertainment for their housemates: Ron soliciting bets when Dean would cave, and Harry very helpfully teaching Seamus
Draco ushers Harry into the flat, a hand on the small of Harry’s back, a casually possessive gesture that sends a thrill down Draco’s spine. Harry looks around curiously, but the flat is still in its sterile and inoffensively pleasant state; he didn’t plan on staying long enough to mark his personality on the place.
her subjects. She claims that the pursuit is the very essence of her painting.’ He shrugs. ‘I am glad I am not an artist. I cannot begin to understand her thoughts – and she, the woman I have lived with for twenty-three years!’
‘If you tell Dumbledore, I will kill you,’ Draco said simply.
He smirks. ‘I doubt
‘Yes, I woke up early today.’ Draco turns, smiling as naturally as he can manage. ‘How was your dinner with Sirius and Remus?’
Potter looked stricken. He didn’t want to hear Draco’s words, but he was held fast, as if in the embrace of Devil’s Snare.
‘I don’t—I don’t know where he is,’ Draco struggles to speak, his throat tight. ‘He’s—He’s very far—I don’t—I can’t

Next to the king, the brown-haired alpha—the only bright one in the group, it seems—opens her mouth, eyes wide with alarm, but Potter, looking only at Eltanin, barrels on.
“People need to let the past go,” Theo said with a frown. “We have already paid for our mistakes. Draco, especially.”
She had firmly attached herself to Draco’s trip to Diagon Alley. Of course, it would be perfectly fine if all he was planning on getting were books. Now, he would have to think of a way to shake her off.
could you let yourself get hurt when I was not there to protect you?"
Harry tells him an hour before the Portkey from Malfoy Manor to London that his godfathers know that Draco knows he is omega. ‘You don’t need to be so worried. They aren’t going to do anything,’ the dark-haired boy says, amused. ‘Dumbledore and Minnie know too. They are fine with it—they know I trust you.’
He wants Minnie to be happy, he really does. Does she know how the Dursleys shoved him into the dark, spider-infested cupboard beneath the stairs? Does she know the days he were sick and lay coughing and sobbing on a hard mattress, thinking he was going to die? Does she know what she has done by bringing him here a year ago, to these green windswept hills, where if he flies high enough, he can see the ocean glinting on sunny days?
Before Draco can reply indignantly that
Draco had once thought he could not love Harry more. He was wrong. He could. His love was heat and desperation and desire and longing and want. His love was too much salt and the smell of eggs in the morning and the melting of biscuit crumbs on his tongue. His love stared at him with serious green eyes sprinkled with gold dust, indentations on his nose where his glasses sat.
He turns to face the rock wall, and focusses.
The Galleons could be better spent bribing the Azkaban guards, those who were wizards, to secretly give thicker blankets and clean robes to Lucius Malfoy. After receiving his lord’s punishment, Father had been sent back to suffer the rest of his Azkaban sentence; the wizard prison was the first institution to fall to Lord Voldemort.
– how could you have stooped so low?’
, the book explained,
‘I think about you every day,’ Harry whispers. ‘You are mine.’
Draco is bored. He sits next to his mother, kicking his foot against the table leg, ignoring her warning looks. They are at Mrs Parkinson’s tea party, sitting at dainty round tables in the middle of perfectly manicured gardens. The ladies are making mind-numbingly dull conversation over tasteless tea and bland cakes. He has eaten at least seven of those little cakes, and watched the dragon shrub cavort around them for the tenth time already.
There it was: those
rude to us. In any case, I do not hold the gentleman’s judgement to any regard, hence it matters not to me how he insults us – if he had.’
A sob tears through his chest, heavy and true like an iron-tipped spear, and he wraps his arms around Harry, sinking to his knees on the ground.
aware of Potter, but he is. The thread between them thrums, strong and true, leading Potter to him as surely as Draco feels Potter’s confusion and desperation. Draco is now privy to Potter’s emotions, tuned into every moment Potter should be afraid or tired or weary or sad. Colette said that this would make it easier for the Veela to protect the mate.
Harry is happy to report to Lizzy and their friends at home of Jane’s recovery. When he is not accompanying Kitty to parties and assembly rooms, he vists his old friends from Hogwarts and his time in the Auror Corps. He is particularly delighted to meet by coincidence Mr. Dean Thomas and Mr. Seamus Finnigan, who were in Gryffindor House with him, at the park, where he is taking a stroll before dinner. Thomas and Finnigan married at the end of the war, and now live in London, where they manage a tourist agency for wizards who wish to tour Muggle destinations.
Draco collapsed onto a seat, covering his face with his hands. Merlin, he was tired. He heard the quiet footsteps, the slither of clothing against the doorframe, and the door closing. He smelled Potter before he felt him: Potter always smelled like soap and dust for some reason. He leaned into Potter’s embrace, his eyes still closed.
But the blonde wizard does not turn back, and Harry hears Dobby hastily seeing Malfoy to the front door, bidding him farewell in his high squeak. Harry makes to go after the other man, but Lizzy pulls him back.
Magic shot through his arm, singing in his blood, in his bones. There was heat and friction; it was like touching the sizzling edges of a wall of lightning. Magic, strong and pure and alive, ricocheted through his body, through his mind.
Troubled, Harry returns his attention to the letter Mary has written the family.
Potter must have perceived Draco’s insanity the way a prey instinctively knows a predator because he jerked away, eyes now filled with a different kind of terror. A knife twisted in Draco’s chest, driven in by this act of rejection. He didn’t want Potter scared of him.
‘Yaxley, Greyback, the Carrows … there are others. I don’t know who they are.’
Smirking, Draco began to stroke himself. For a while, there was no sound in the bathroom but the susurration of skin against skin and the occasional
‘Draco knows,’ Ron says, spearing a potato on the end of his fork. ‘He doesn’t care. Rather thinks he likes it. Keeps people away, he said.’
‘There is something different about the way you smell,’ Draco murmurs into Harry’s chest, eyes closed. ‘You smell … cleaner … thicker … it’s more intense.’
The man shrieks, thrashing beneath Draco’s claws. Draco yanks—skin tears—bones crack—and he is staring at a raw pulsing heart, blood spraying in all directions. The man is gurgling, awful wet sounds. Draco snaps his beak around that beating heart, and tears it out of the chest. The man stops moving, the sound of his thumping feet dying away. Dead—he's dead.
? Slowly, he raises his wand again, focusing the incandescent light on the intruder. Draco stops, a muscle pulsing along his jawline.
The others turn to look at her, disconcerted. Ron understands first, his freckles stark against his white face, and he starts scrambling over the wall of dead bodies, not seeming to notice when his hand sinks into soft, torn flesh. ‘
‘It’ll be weird having Potions without Snape,’ Nott was musing. ‘Slughorn doesn’t really seem like a

in the ballroom downstairs – they would all gladly take you, even the married couples. Do not make a mistake – with me.’
He should have done this from the start, shaken off the fear and doubt that were wrapped around his throat like the Devil’s Snare. Those treacherous thoughts he has worked so hard to deny are now rampaging through him with the grace of panicked hippogriffs.

He knew fixing the Cabinet was going to be difficult, but he had completely underestimated the task. Borgin needed him to find out not only the physical specifications of the Cabinet, but also the individual spells that made up the Cabinet. You would think finding out the measurements was the easy part; not quite so when the Cabinet existed in seven dimensions.

“Me,” Potter said, now frowning. “Wait, do you not want to come with me?”
‘What do you mean?’ Regulus cries out. ‘He made more than
‘There’s something I miss doing,’ Harry whispered and in a swift motion, flipped them over. ‘Scoot up,’ he commanded, hands on Malfoy’s hips, pushing him up to lean against the headboard. He sat between Malfoy’s legs, a hand hovering over the fly of his trousers as he checked Malfoy’s expression.
It feels like he is cradling an iridescent bubble in his claws, desperately keeping it from popping. When they are back in the quiet house, Harry pulls him down next to him on the narrow bed. He lies there, arm rigid where it presses against Harry, his heart pulsing wildly. He cannot think what Harry wants.
‘Apples, especially the big ones – they can be rather filling. I bet you live in a posh manor with grounds and all that. Do you have a horse?’
‘Lizzy!’ Jane and Harry exclaim, the former in outrage and the latter in dismay, as Kitty gives a shriek of laughter.
‘Oh, it does, of course, it does, sir,’ Borgin said quickly, attracted by the scent of a potential sale. ‘And as a working Cabinet, it will not be cheap, oh no, it won’t, but of course, for
Harry blinks. ‘We’re fine.’
‘I received a letter from our cousins in France,’ Mother said. ‘Aunt Melinda, do you remember her? We stayed in her villa when you were ten and you had so much fun playing with her three children, Victor, David and Elizabeth.’
Harry quickly looks up and his stomach drops at the sight of the other boy’s face – still and pale, his eyes dark with fury, his jaw tightly clenched. Well, fuck, now he’s gone and pissed Malfoy off. He swallows, licking his dry lips.
Alena flits towards the two Veela waiting in the middle of the clearing. Lit by the soft, golden light spilling through the gap in the canopy, the Veelas are ethereal: luminous skin, long blond hair, and bright sparkling eyes. Their smiles glitter like thin ice on a warm winter’s day. The woman next to Alena is holding a bundle of brown cloth.
,’ Draco says, shaking his head sharply when Harry opens his mouth to protest. ‘No, you’re listening to me now, Harry.’ Draco takes a deep a breath, takes a step back. ‘For sixteen years, I’ve been raised to believe in the superiority of purebloods – and I honestly believed it, I truly thought Voldemort was doing the right thing, that we purebloods deserved to be the rulers because we were the true wizards.’
But looking down now at the child in her arms, Narcissa wonders dazedly how she could have wanted any other child. This boy is

It feels familiar, it feels like
‘I’m afraid that’s not how it works, Harry,’ the Minister said sombrely. ‘He has continued to support Voldemort, even after he came of age. He was already a legal adult when he fought against us in the Battle of Hogwarts – as were you. We must hold him accountable for his harmful actions, no matter how sorry he might be now.’
‘Potter,’ Luc’s voice was composed. ‘Will you tell me about Malfoy?’
‘Indeed! Spare me the suspense – do tell.’
Draco must have been in his other form for a while. There were leaves and branches in his wings and matted hair, dried blood on his beak, and dirt encrusted on his claws. What remained of his robes were filthy and stained. He cried out when he saw Harry, deep and throaty, and launched himself towards him.
He pauses, the first glimmer of uncertainty on his stony façade, but he plunges on in the same stubborn manner that won him a second kingdom and the realm, his eyes flashing defiance and certainty. "You are mine …
‘Nah, the three of you are just early,’ the Irishman grinned. ‘The rest are right behind us!’
‘If he’s not here – if he’s gone,’ Draco’s mind was spinning, his thoughts randomly connecting, disconnecting. Potter would be in Dumbledore’s office for hours for those private lessons. Potter couldn’t be with Dumbledore
‘People do not expect it of me, judging from my appearance,’ he says with a self-deprecating grin that immediately endears him to Harry, ‘but that is the very objective, of course. It suits me, the work there, and I enjoy it well enough. It is quite intellectually stimulating. That is what most of us would like of our work, I should think! You have been to the Department of Mysteries, I understand? Quite an eerie place, is not it? We would like to redecorate it, if we could, but that is very much under the Minister’s purview, unfortunately.’

‘So, we must destroy these objects?’ Hermione asked. ‘How many are there? How many times can he split his soul?’

already forming in his mouth, but there are three of them after all, and he and Malfoy are easily disarmed. He swears, tightening his grip around Malfoy’s arm, his heart thudding in his chest. The prince clings to the back of his robes, his breathing shuddery. The kidnappers are pointing their lighted wands at them.
‘What do you mean?’ He was feeling as if he had taken a vat of Confusing Concoction; Godric, he loved Luna, but picking apart her riddles after five pints was asking for a bit too much.
Draco opens his mouth, and sucks in a breath. ‘I know,’ he manages to say. ‘I’ve known since first-year.’
He shakes his head again. ‘I didn’t—’
The Japanese place a lot of emphasis on duty and honour—and the strict role one must fulfil in society. When he first came here to stay with a friend of Remus, a Welshman who migrated to chase the neon fever dreams of Muggle Tokyo, he was flabbergasted by their treatment of omegas.
The Gryffindors—even those in the upper years—have happily accepted Draco Malfoy into their fold, especially when he teamed up with Fred and George to prank the Slytherins by slipping Itching Powder into everyone’s robes overnight. There is also some pride in owning the most beautiful person at Hogwarts. Draco at twelve is still slight and delicate enough to be the subject of infatuations from both girls and boys, despite the fact that he could probably topple a tree with his bare hands.
Harry took a sip of his sugary tea, reaching out for a biscuit. Parkinson was sneaking glances at him. When their eyes met, she flushed and looked away, causing Zabini to turn to check on what troubled her. He realised that it was Harry and glared at him as if it were Harry’s fault. He took Parkinson’s hand, squeezing it, and leaned in to whisper something into her ear. She shook her head firmly, turning her head resolutely to look at McGonagall. Zabini shot Harry a lingering look of dislike before looking away.
‘What do you think?’ Harry asks, waving vaguely around the room. ‘It’s not much, but it’s the best I could find on short notice, and I thought we should stay in a wizarding village, you know, it’ll be easier for you. We can move when we find somewhere better.’
The jagged edges of his shattered mind click into place. He is alpha. He is a Veela. And he is Draco Malfoy, named for the fearsome, fire-breathing beast, and he
Draco. It’s ironic that he cannot be with his mate for him to be well again, to be
Draco doesn’t mind the stares, but he has to admit that entering the Great Hall behind Professor McGonagall and having the entire Hall of older students turn to look is terrifying enough to weaken his knees. Granger is staring fixedly ahead, while Longbottom whimpers and Weasleys is white beneath his freckles. Only Potter seems unaffected, striding along in McGonagall’s wake; he was delighted to see her.
‘Our secret weapon,’ Draco suggests.
When Harry read the exposé on his and Malfoy’s relationship in the
odd—why do the adults give you everything that you want? They give you the best cakes! They serve you tea first!’ She glares at him accusatorily.
Dumbledore was considering him with placid blue eyes, as if Draco was standing before him in the office, sent by another professor to receive punishment from a higher authority. ‘Why are you doing this, Draco?’
Jane only laughs and waves Lizzy’s request away. Harry and Jane have their suspicions of Darcy, which Draco would encourage with amused smirks. Hence, it comes as a surprise to everyone else, including Lizzy, when Darcy proposes to her while they are on a walk from Netherfield to Longbourn. Lizzy has been meeting the gentleman by coincidence frequently on her walks through the neighbourhood, much to her consternation.
‘Wanker,’ Potter said, still smiling that wonderful smile of his, the smile that filled Draco’s chest with butter-yellow sunlight.
‘The. Map,’ Potter said with deliberate slowness, his outstretched hand already curling into a fist.
“That’s what all the pessimists say,” Harry teased and kissed him again.
He knows people would find him unsavoury company—not only for his family name, but his inhumanity too.
Draco studies the familiar face in the darkness: wild dark hair, golden-brown skin, the curve of a cheek, chapped lips. His best friend. They have grown up a bit since first year; Draco is pleased to note that he is still taller than Harry. Growing up also means other things—Draco isn’t interested in dating, but Harry could be. His asking his godfathers about soulmates and love shows that he has at least been thinking a little about it.
The Draco of the past six months isn’t the Draco he loved before the Battle of Hogwarts—but no one is whom they were before—especially Harry. He didn’t realise until it was gone: there is a hollow within him, where Voldemort’s evil used to nest. He shouldn’t be feeling so empty, like he has lost a part of himself when it was not his to begin with. The only thing that seems real and unchanging is his bond with Draco.
Sometimes, Draco thinks of his transformation as a stillborn phoenix rebirth. Where the firebird pops out of the ash as a whole, healthy creature, Draco is still soot, hopeless and useless – utterly bereft of wizard magic.
could ever marry a Muggle. ‘It is not so much our differences in culture and understanding of the world. It is, after all, no fault of their own that their world is so drab and colourless,’ she said, smiling, as she gazes down at the velvety darkness of the slumbering land beneath them. ‘I would hesitate to fall in love with any Muggle based on the poor understanding that we would have of each other’s characters. Only love borne of deepest mutual respect and trust could move me into matrimony – and how could there be genuine respect when a witch must hide such a crucial part of herself from her partner?’
Sirius nudges his mate, wriggling his eyebrows. Moony rolls his eyes, but relents: ‘Well, hard work should be rewarded.’
The teakettle trilled, and Potter prepared the tea in silence. The loudest thing between them was the occasional clink of the cups being set on saucers as they drank their tea. Draco was staring at the stained table top.
How he fucking wishes he can hate Harry sodding Potter.
It was an assault that began as the whiff of an aroma like decadent chocolate cake baking in the oven, orange blossom trees, and storm winds rippling across the downs. It made Draco think of home. His chest was tight, and he could hear his pulse thrumming in his ears. He looked up in the mirror to see the people his parents were talking to, and there he was.
‘How do you know?’ Draco asked without heat, genuinely curious. ‘I have done … terrible things to get what I want. Isn’t this expected of a Slytherin?’
‘Why?’ Potter asks. ‘You want me – I can see it on your face right now. Why are you pushing me away?’
‘I’m yours,’ Draco replies, and digs his thumb in, parting Harry’s lips wet and plush. ‘If the way you smell now also drives me crazy, I don’t know what I’m going to do when you are in heat.’
ME!’ Luc all but screamed, whirling around to face him.
He finished his drink, set the damp glass down. ‘No. I won’t. I can’t.’ He couldn’t read Luc’s expression. ‘He’s mine, and I won’t give him away.’ He didn’t think he explained it well enough; Luc’s face was still blank. ‘Malfoy’s mine, you see, but he’s dead so I don’t have anything else of him, right? These memories are all I have left. I can’t share them with you – they’re
Draco shivers at the sound of his name on his mate’s lips: soft, reverent, a prayer.

Yaxley shook him. ‘He
He sat up and Draco could hear him starting to dress. Potter had Charms with the Ravenclaws next; Draco had Arithmancy.
Draco thinks Harry’s godfathers suspect something, judging from the way Remus’s looks gradually transformed from suspicion to pity over the years. Hermione probably does too. She could hardly miss the way Harry’s strength flags at a particular time of the month, his prodigious knowledge of potion-making and how he shunned any relationships at school, despite him being rather popular. And once she deduced that Harry is omega, it only takes following a logical line to understand why Draco, an alpha, behaves the way he does around Harry.
Harry has thought about visiting Draco in the last six months – excessively so. He has thought about

Ginny pulls him outside, where they might have the pretence of privacy in the crowded house. He looks at her curiously. It has become somewhat of a settled thing for Ginny to be part of the group, despite Ron’s grumbling about little sisters. She is always good for a game of Quidditch, and when Harry is Seeker and Ginny Chaser, they usually win the game against her indignant brothers.
Harry is usually glad to have Draco on his side, but not when he is so weak.

confused I was, Potter?’
It has been two years since he left Britain. ‘When are you coming home?’ his friends ask, over Floo, in letters, when they visit.
‘Oh, like you don’t like it,’ he retorts, rubbing the back of Harry’s hand with his thumb.
‘Did you hear me, you filthy tart?’ the prince hisses. ‘Remember that
‘You’re not—Sirius?’ Harry stammers. ‘Are you … Regulus?’
‘Let’s say there is,’ Neville is stubborn. ‘Don’t you see that if you let Voldemort in, you are exposing Draco too? Do you want Voldemort in Draco’s head?’
did to each other.
‘You think about it now or later, the outcome is the same, innit? It’s only omegas for alphas like you and Draco,’ Seamus says, waving his fork.
There were holes up and down the street, as if entire shops had been scooped out and tossed aside. Bits of masonry and brick littered the narrow street, larger blocks shoved to the side. Every single glass window had been shattered, shards glittering in the murky light that reached here. Shop fronts were scorched; extremely strong
When he was caught up in the midst of it, when he was only thinking of transference spells and magical wood and special runes, he relished the work. His mind focused, he didn’t need to think about the Dark Lord, about his mother trapped in Malfoy Manor, about his father wasting away in Azkaban, about Harry bloody Potter. He only needed to look at the spells, to trace the runes, to trawl through books with pages nibbled by bookwyrms.

he could buy a broomstick of his own.
People roared, surging forwards, and Harry pressed himself against the wall, flabbergasted at the intensity of the outrage for the besmirching of his name. Plainclothes Aurors jumped out of the crowd and began shouting for calm and order. Harry took the chance to dive into the crowd, elbowing his way to the exit.
Draco wanted to give himself up to a Hungarian Horntail, and wipe his shit life from existence.
Jackson collapsed onto the ground, a puppet without its strings.
Potter shook his head. ‘No. I’m not having sex with you.’
Harry looks up cautiously, and blinks at the sight of Minnie’s face. She is crying, her tears pouring down her cheeks. She kneels, so that they are eye-level, and places her warm, heavy hands on his shoulders.
pointless, but necessary; after all, doesn’t he like the person he is today better than the boy he was five years ago?
? I’m fucking crazy for you, Malfoy! Do you know how gutted I feel knowing that you have a mate?’
Draco was sitting on the edge of his bed, his arms wrapped tightly around himself. He jerked when his aunt entered his room. Mother came in behind her, her regal face pale and drawn. Their eyes met and Draco felt her despair reach for him across the room, cold and clammy.
Malfoy’s smile widened just a little, and he dipped his head almost shyly, as he said, ‘Brilliant. I’ll meet you at the entrance hall at six. See you around, Potter.’ He turned around, walked back to his corner, scooped up his book, and disappeared up the stairs to the dorm rooms.
It soon comes to the ball at Netherfield Park Bingley has long promised to hold. Lydia had accousted him with the notion a month ago, and the gentleman readily agreed, no doubt persuaded by Jane’s gaze upon him. The neighbourhood speaks of nothing else for the week prior to the ball, and the shops enjoy a healthy patronage. Harry is driven nearly to madness by his sisters’ – including Jane and Lizzy – fussing over their attire, and seeks refuge with Ron and Hermione, who laugh at his predicament.
‘Well,
‘I don’t know,’ Draco said. ‘I don’t like Granger because she’s an obnoxious know-it-all. Davis is fine, but she is a Slytherin. I don’t really … I don’t really talk to Muggle-borns much, do I?’
Harry munches on his sandwich, his mind cast back to Sirius bleeding out in the entryway. He feels the sharp edges of something darker and far greater than he can understand within him. The adults don’t tell him, but he gets the idea that being omega is something to be ashamed about, to be hidden. He wonders if the reason they don’t bring him anywhere is because he is omega. He wonders if being omega is the reason the Dursleys hated him so much.
It starts with bones, blood and an earlobe.
‘Fine. Have it your way,’ Zabini sounded bitter. ‘You are dabbling with things more dangerous you can imagine, Malfoy, and I’m not sure you are doing well enough to hide it from Potter. We all know how Potter is going to react when he finds out what you are – he is going to
At the lake, Draco finds himself in the same boat as all of them—despite the fact that since Neville and Ron come from wizarding families (and ancient pureblood lines at that), they must have heard something about the Malfoys. Draco pretends not to notice the way Pansy Parkinson is pointing at him from the other boat, whispering to the people around her.
Growing up in the exclusive society of pureblood British wizards and witches, there weren’t many gay wizards around Draco’s age, so Jonas was the first man he ever had.
The land falls away beneath their feet, as if the ground has been cleaved away straight down to the grassy fields unfolding across the horizon. Everything is grey and black at night, the moonlight a gauzy white across the land. Wind whips through the trees behind them, bringing the sharp clean scent of greenery, flapping their cloaks against their legs, rippling across the whispering moors.
He stands to leave. Narcissa looks at him in concern. ‘You can stay the night. We have plenty of rooms,’ she says. He shakes his head, no, no, he can’t. ‘All right. I will have Dropsy bring you home. Good night, Harry, and thank you again. I suppose we will see you tomorrow?’
‘How did you escape?’ George asks in a hushed tone.
recently. Change is meaningful only when we undertake the journey for ourselves, do not you agree?
‘My pleasure, Master,’ the house elf squeaks happily, and scurries back into the kitchen.
Darcy is puzzled. Taking pity on the gentleman, who is ill-equipped to handle
‘Put him down,’ Neville says, attempting to sound calm.
Draco heard the words come from somewhere far off, from a mouth that wasn’t his. ‘He wants me to kill Dumbledore.’
‘Exactly,’ Ron beamed proudly, wiping his hands down the front of his robes and turning to look at Harry. ‘Anyway, we were talking about Luna’s cousin. It just sounds to me that the poor sod was a little star-struck.’
He doesn’t mean to sound so plaintive, almost accusing. Harry has told him before that it’s enough that they are friends, that he doesn’t
‘Enough,’ he said firmly, ignoring the pleading look Potter shot him. ‘Merlin’s beard, you’re such a horny git.’
His frown deepens. ‘When you start dating someone, isn’t there kissing and all that?’
‘It’ll work to our advantage then, won’t it?’ Draco asks excitedly. ‘We only need to find him—after we have the diadem—and we could finish him all at once!’
‘It could have been worse, considering that I came here to find my mate dripping in another alpha’s scent.’
’ Malfoy all but screamed, his hips jerking, his cock sliding deeper into Harry’s mouth.
Potter says: ‘Take me.’
He jumps, his head snapping backwards. An old wizard is stepping out onto a ladder from the paper-thin gap between two shelves. He peers down at the group of them, blinking owlishly from behind thick glasses.
They are standing to the side, waiting for Minnie to finish her conversation, when Harry catches people taking double takes and staring as they pass by. He nervously flattens his fringe over his scar, keeping his eyes on the shop windows. Minnie has warned him that people might stare—or even try to talk to him. It feels weird, people knowing who he is just because of something he did accidentally as a baby.
Draco blushes, heat shooting through him. ‘Oh fuck, I know
Draco recoils, smarting from Harry’s stinging words—the injustice, the assumptions—and the words tumble uncontrollably out of his mouth. ‘People will think
‘Here,’ Draco says eagerly, taking Harry’s hand—the bleeding stops and the skin starts to knit together—and pulling him through.
Draco drank more wine, pretending not to see Potter’s expression.
Or that people were using
Parkinson took a deep breath. ‘I’m sorry,’ she blurted. ‘I’m sorry for trying to give you up to the Dark Lord. I’m sorry for being such a twat to you during our years at Hogwarts. I’m really sorry.’ Her pug-like face was screwed up in distress, her fists clenched tightly by her side. Zabini loomed behind her, a dark figure of disdain.
,’ Potter spits out the name like poison, ‘and how you no longer have magic … and what you’ve become.’
I have to attend those dratted Slug Club meetings now,’ Zabini grimaced. ‘Rubbing shoulders with Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs … Ravenclaws aren’t too bad at least, when they’re not going off tangent on some abstract concept.’

An arm wrapped around Neville’s shoulders, Hermione says in a choked, accusing voice: ‘Harry is our friend too.’
‘Are you doing anything yet?’ Potter asked.
send you back to your aunt. I’m sorry that … I made you think that way.’
, they deserve it,’ Harry said unthinkingly.
Harry didn’t need anyone to try and understand what they had. He didn’t think Malfoy himself understood what they were. Merlin, it was only in hindsight that Harry realised that he loved Malfoy, whether there was the Amortentia or not. The sad thing was that Malfoy had died, believing that the only way he could have had Harry was if he had drugged him. Knowing that was enough to knock Harry to his knees.
Harry took that small, cold hand. His skin tingled where they touched, and when their eyes met over the handshake, Luc’s eyes were dark with an incomprehensible expression. Harry could only tell Luc was making him a promise, then and there, but whether that promise was in his favour, he had no idea.
Draco exhaled, the wine-scented breath billowing against Harry’s lips. ‘Didn’t you say you would go down on your knees and beg me to come back to you?’
He chatters away inanely about the places he had been, the food he had eaten. Eventually, to his relief, Potter looks up. The dark-haired man props his chin onto his palm, asking a few questions but otherwise seems contented to let Draco prattle on. His eyes are the warm gold-green of sunlight in a forest clearing and Draco feels a responding twinge in his chest.
He leans in closer, his eyes dark and molten. Draco feels Potter’s breath on his lips, his heart thundering in his ears, his stomach clenched. Fear and longing twist in Draco’s chest, hard.
‘I hope you are telling the truth, because it was both clumsy and foolish. Already you are suspected of having a hand in it.’
“Harry, your potatoes are the
‘A barter. I would give the other party something they want in exchange for what I want.’
‘Our son,’ he echoes.
He closes his eyes, but there are wingbeats in the air, and when he opens his eyes, another Veela—an alpha—is standing over him, arms folded across his chest, eyes narrowed in scrutiny. ‘So, you’re the disturbance in the forest,’ he says in heavily accented English.
Draco staggers only because he is caught off-guard, and returns Ron’s hug in bemusement. The commotion brings Fred and George out of their room next door, and soon, everyone in the Burrow is piling into the room, shouting greetings and questions at Draco, who tries to answer everyone all at once. Ginny comes too, giving Harry an amused glance, as if to say,
It was a glass bead, shaped like a teardrop with a hole through the round middle. Harry took it, surprised by its warmth. Draco looked over his shoulder, at Moaning Myrtle’s usual haunting spot.
‘Only to those it does not care to have in its home,’ Lizzy replies smoothly.
Harry is counting down the days to the end of Malfoy’s month with the Aurors, when the prince is kidnapped.
‘No, they’re only pretending,’ Johnson says impatiently. ‘It’s an open secret in the department. Our little prince here has a stalker problem. Pathetic. Can you imagine this omega is meant to
Albus Dumbledore tilts his head, listening, and soon enough, they hear Lily Potter’s laughter and the midwife’s soft murmuring response. Albus nods, and James flies across the small room and thunders up the stairs. The sound of the young father’s joyful and effusive greeting echoes throughout the house, joined by his wife’s teasing admonishment to
Draco smiled. ‘Potter, if I had, we would have started snogging months ago.’
Zabini was referring to Draco’s enslavement to Lord Voldemort as
Better to think that than to face the dark clawed thing threatening to burst through his chest.
The other man chuckled, swirling his drink around. ‘Fine, you’re just a prat then.’
He thought of approaching Malfoy directly – that was a rather exasperated Ginny’s suggestion:
Draco sits straight-backed, hands curled around a steaming mug of tea. Harry mirrors him across the kitchen table, gulping down his tea to chase away the last of the mead-induced fogginess. The Veela watches him, still and silent, grey eyes trailing from Harry’s face, to his throat, his shoulders and arms, and back to his face; like the stroke of soft, warm palms against his skin. Harry suppresses a shiver.
“It’s bad
Harry chokes on his beer, spitting it out, and wipes his mouth furiously. ‘Draco’s not my boyfriend! Why do you think that?’
‘Do you think –’ James makes a sharp gesture towards the stairs.
. He wriggles his way through, and with a backward glance at his friends’ upturned gawping faces, flies down the pitch-dark tunnel on the other side.
‘Are we – are we –’
Luc strode forwards, furious, as Zabini carefully closed the door behind him and placed a Locking Spell. Alarmed, Harry held his hands up because Luc seemed like he was prime to punch him in the face. The smaller man hauled him off his stool and slammed him against a cabinet of utensils. Harry winced; for such a small man, he was absurdly strong.

‘I know I made a mistake—I should have told you where I was going—I should have told you I needed time—it was irresponsible and awful of me. I’m sorry, I’m so very sorry, Harry,
During his week at St Mungo’s, he had noticed quite a number witches and one or two wizards give him a meaningful once-over as he passed. Some of them had approached him with glazed eyes, too blinded by his Veela appeal to realise that he was Draco Malfoy.
‘It isn’t,’ he said flatly, grudgingly, because he didn’t want to make it explicit, didn’t want to put his heart raw and bloody before Potter.
Blaise's fingers tighten on his arms. "The fucking
‘You’re a wanker,’ Draco says.
He turns around, his hand clamped around Harry’s wrist, and pulls him along. His heart is drumming in his chest, in his ears, and he dares not look back, for fear of realising that this is only a dream. There is only going forward: pushing his bedroom door open, pulling Harry in after him, propelling his mate into the bed.
‘You say you know what happened, but you
to be right.
He is frozen, unable to look away from his godfathers sitting on the other side of the table, which might as well be the other side of the moon. Pressed against him, Draco is still, barely breathing. Grimmauld Place is holding its breath, the universe wondering what waits on the other side of the veil.
Myrtle was still sobbing and working herself up into a proper hysterical breakdown. Potter sat on his bum where Snape had pushed him and stared, keeping his eyes on Draco’s face. Draco couldn’t look away from him. The way Potter had looked when he thought he had killed Draco. The way he had
He looks up, meets her familiar blue eyes, and abruptly, everything is a blur, like peering up at the sky through murky lake water. The nothingness in his chest stirs: something, not nothing. His face is wet, his wounds stinging where the tears touch, and there is a sound, a wretched wail that feels like the world is ending. It comes from him.
Draco moved now, holding out his hand. ‘Look at this. Myrtle gave it to me.’
act, but well, Draco can always be trusted to be irrational when it comes to Harry Potter.
Fred and George have been looking at each other shiftily. Fred nudges his brother, who leans forward to announce grandly: ‘Secret passageways.’ They have the attention of the group now. Fred picks up the thread: ‘We found this map in Filch’s office,’ —everyone ignores Hermione’s outraged ‘Were you sneaking?’ — ‘and it shows us all the passageways and corridors in Hogwarts,
His friends were worried, he could tell. Pansy would look at him askance, making little casual comments about his schoolwork and the horrid bags under his eyes. It took most of Draco’s self-restraint not to snarl at her, mostly because he knew Zabini would skewer him for making Pansy cry.
prophecy has falsely given you the idea that you are all that matters in the world.’
‘No, Harry, you would serve us far better by staying. Longbourn would surely fall apart if you should leave it to us,’ she said, waving her butter knife around the table.
‘Are you going to tell me what you’re doing?’ Zabini asked, even though he knew it was pointless to try.
But Draco’s fist loosens under Harry’s hand, and he is turning his hand over, pressing their palms together, intertwining their fingers. Carefully.
Draco hasn’t said a word after his laughing fit, only followed him into the kitchen, accepting the cup of tea. The lines of his beauty are softened in the warm yellow lights, surrounded by pink, froufrou curtains and cushions Harry hasn’t had time to replace. No longer marble, but pale smooth skin that would redden easily under Harry’s hands, pink lips wet and plush begging to be kissed, and half-lidded grey eyes darkened by desire and knowing—
Mrs. Bennet is staring at him in consternation, ignorant of the ottoman twitching beneath Malfoy’s heels. Bingley and Darcy look nonplussed. This is clearly behaviour they have not observed from their friend. Harry intercedes before his mother could injure the service Malfoy has performed for them.
The dark-haired man gives a sharp bark of laughter, and shrugs. ‘Well, I thought we could start off with the easy stuff:
ing the front of his robes. When they saw that he was not going to reply, they left him too, muttering about ungrateful bastards. He hefted his bag onto his shoulder and headed straight for the seventh floor. Safely ensconced in the Room of Hidden Things, he threw himself into his work and the rest of the world melted away.
Neither of them was prepared for the way Draco lunged at him. Draco fell out of his bed gracelessly, his legs tangled in blankets and his elbows cracking against the floor painfully. But he was hardly aware of that.
They listened to his ranting echo down the corridor, punctuated at points by Mrs Norris’ mewing, as he hurried away to seek help from the authority.
‘Of course,’ Draco echoes his mother, thanking Merlin that his voice did not come out as a croak.
‘I know,’ Draco says stiffly, feeling Potter’s eyes on them. ‘I will write everyday if I can – you don’t have to miss me so much. It will be Christmas before you know it!’

The tableau broke apart slowly at first, and then completely. Death Eaters fled, Aurors chasing after them, casting

He turns his face away, fists clenched by his side, perspiration dripping down his back, as the seamstress makes this and that adjustment to the heavy robes. Father murmured there might be trouble, but he only meant that Mother’s rebel cousin—the only Black on the
He swallows his mouthful of dry bread and salty ham, and nods and smiles. He’s fine. Sirius calls him the most prepared eight-year-old in Britain, and he will be. He must be stronger, smarter, less of a cry-baby, so that – like Dumbledore tells him – nobody must ever find out that he is omega.
The Weasleys make noises of disgust, as the brown-haired female looks exasperated, nearly identical to Mother's next to him. Blaise half-turns towards him, a furious look on his face, mouth opening, but Potter cuts through the rising chatter: "If you fuck anyone else," he says pleasantly, "I will cut your knot off and choke you with it."
. She managed somehow to imply that Harry had caused the accident. Draco and the other Gryffindors barely kept their outrage in check.
Mother is making desultory conversation with her cousin and his mate. She has told Draco many stories about Black, usually in an amused tone. She was a few years older than him at school, but the antics of Black and his friends were infamous. His being sorted into Gryffindor was a terrible scandal for the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, which mostly sorted into Slytherin like Mother. After Sirius Black was disowned, he was an Inferius to the family.
Harry keeps his head above the flood, because that is expected of him. There are funerals to attend, and dead friends to mourn. He holds those who are alive, their anguish reverberating through his chest: boulders wrapped around his wrists and ankles, and he is sinking in pitch-dark waters. He looks into caskets, and wonders how he isn’t in the dirt with them.
‘Dumbledore told me how to kill him,’ Harry snarls. ‘That’s what was in the memory Snape gave me! I know what I have to do, and we should go to him now that we know what the last Horcruxes are. We can
‘Dance, I suppose. That is always a safe choice – along with conversation. There is nothing like conversation for parties to discover likeness of mind and compatibility in character. In fact, I would call conversation the very essence of romance. One always requires understanding and compassion for one’s partner, I think, and conversation is the very method to achieve that.’
‘I heard something outside – I thought it was you guys – and I saw him cry – I saw Potter there.’ Goyle flushed, mortified at his slip-up.
‘And if we should speak of manners, why, Darcy has been most polite in all our interactions with him after the ball. Perhaps he has come to regret his earlier insolence, and wishes to make amends,’ says Harry.
He doesn’t need to fear Draco exposing it, that’s for sure. Draco says he wants to help him, but he doesn’t know what
‘Hullo! Another first year? You’ll be wanting the standard set of robes, I suppose?’ she asks energetically, her eyes already taking Harry’s measurements. ‘Well, come along then. I’ll get you sorted out. Don’t have any siblings, I suppose? No hand-me-downs to take advantage of?’
Harry grins savagely. The person who made the Portkey to transport only Malfoy would have been hanging around the prince—and by extension, Harry—for weeks to capture his magical signature. He knows that voice: Johnson, a junior officer in the Administrative Registration Department. The Martyrs are going to be so
‘I am your friend,’ Harry says numbly.
Now it was Draco’s turn to sputter wordlessly. Pansy and Goyle laughed. Crabbe was ignoring the whole lot of them, buried in Goyle’s comic.
‘Leave the bloke alone, Harry,’ Ron said, carefully levitating a man-shaped statue made entirely out of Ever-Bouncing Bouncy Balls into the display window. His brows were furrowed in sheer concentration as he cleared the barrier and set the statue down with the collective shrieks from the balls. ‘What do you think?’
The scent—the scent of waves crashing upon rocky shores, a greenhouse of lilies and lavender lit by blue lightning—suffuses his senses, and he cannot think beyond
. He opened his eyes, blearily staring at the mess strewn across his floor. Heaving a sigh, he stood and began picking his things up.
’ve been following me around so much,’ Draco said petulantly.
‘So good,’ he whispers against his skin. ‘Draco,
‘I’m afraid our conversation does not interest the children,’ Mother says to the other ladies, nodding at Draco and Pansy with a benevolent smile. ‘Rose, what do you say to Pansy taking Draco on a tour of your lovely gardens? I think there would be enough there to entertain the children and keep them out of our hair.’
Zabini was one of the few Slytherins who had friends in other houses. Despite what he said about Hufflepuff, he had a close childhood friend in the House of Badgers. His mother wasn’t even a Slytherin, but a Ravenclaw and as a socialite, had friends from all four Houses. This was one of the reasons the Malfoys, Parkinsons, Goyles and Crabbes did not care for Mrs Zabini’s company.
‘Well, we would not know, would we?’ Jane says gently. ‘I have noticed that the gentleman is close-lipped of his achievements, which is quite proper.’

“I’d rather suck your cock,” Draco replied.
"If it doesn't, will you run from me and make me chase after with a better offer?" the god asks.
circling around and around his head. He hides his face in his hands, vaguely aware of the bleeding wounds gouged by his own beak and claws. The chains slacken around him, meant for his larger form. He is human for now, because he must use words to talk to Mother. He licks his lips, dry and cracked.
“Somebody wants you dead badly enough to endanger an entire street of people. It’s a wonder the Angel’s Trumpet hit nobody else. Cooperate with us, and the sooner we solve this case, the sooner we can go back to our lives.”
– bollocks this up.
‘Like what?’ Draco was goading him, he knew, but when Potter was angry, he kissed Draco like a living wet dream.
Potter made a rueful face, slumping down into the pillows again. He slid an arm under Draco, pulling him close. He ran a knuckle over the spot where the bruise had already faded. Draco shivered, curling up into Potter’s embrace.
Draco was now dead to Zabini. He didn’t just ignore Draco; Draco simply didn’t exist. To his credit, he didn’t tell anybody why he had cut Draco so completely. Nott, Millie and Tracey Davis, whom they weren’t close to, thought it was only another tiff; they knew Draco pissed people so easily. Pansy worried.
Harry finds that he still has tears after all.
‘What is that?’ Zabini asked him; Draco was the best at Potions in their group.
‘Ah, how nice. All three of you have bought wands from me, haven’t you? And you bring me your progeny now,’ Ollivander says in a peculiarly dreamy manner. ‘Lovely, lovely.’
‘Not the twins,’ Zabini said impatiently as if Draco was being thick on purpose. ‘
Footsteps clacked outside the room, and Draco looked up expectantly. Unfortunately, Potter accompanied the Healer, and the same disconcerting, obsessive
They do reach Ollivander’s eventually. For a shop with such a hallowed history – many great wizards in Harry’s books have gotten wands from Ollivander’s – it is rather underwhelming; a narrow, dark shop sandwiched between a robes boutique and a parchment maker. A single wand lying on a purple cushion in the dusty window, and peeling gold letters above the door that reads
Draco nodded. Yes, he knew Florean Fortescue, the kindly man who had always given Draco extra chocolate chips as a child. Fortescue, who was murdered by Death Eaters for refusing to give the Dark Lord the knowledge he wanted.
‘And what do you suppose a

When the Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs in the other years, who had class with Umbridge, heard about the walk-out, they started doing it as well. The Ravenclaws joined them, although Harry suspects they protested more on the face of the lousy syllabus. The Heads of Houses had to harangue their students back into the classroom, and Umbridge didn’t get to entrap Harry in detention after all.
“Good evening,” he said, nodding politely to Weasley and Granger.
Madam Pomfrey was expectedly horrified because there was so much blood and spoke of sending Draco to St Mungo’s immediately. Thank Merlin, Snape managed to convince her Draco’s wounds were healed, but he needed dittany and blood replenishment potions. The nurse bustled away to gather the potions.
Harry flushed, his skin turning hot under Draco’s fingers. “I’m sorry. It’s just – you killed – blood – and I’m – I’m really sorry.”
Eventually, the Hat slides over his head, blocking out the intrusive stares of the other students. He heard the swell of chatter, until the Hat speaks and drowns everything else out. He squeezes his eyes shut, and hopes fervently for Gryffindor.
It’s different, walking down Diagon Alley, now that he has a wand in his pocket. The hard little ball of worry in his chest has loosened – just a little bit – and he enjoys his dark-chocolate-and-caramel ice cream happily.
. Come on. What are you, scared?’ Without waiting for an answer, he whirls around and continues pushing his way through the shrubs on a path Harry cannot see. He hasn’t brought his wand: apparently, the moonlight is bright enough for his Veela eyes.
“I didn’t want you to be attracted to me only because of my Veela charm,” Draco replied honestly.

He was trying to be good for Minnie. She has been so pinched and silent since Elphie left them three months ago. Harry feels a little lonely without Elphie’s plants in every corner of the manse, and he still keeps wandering into the greenhouse. He expects to see the old wizard pottering away amongst the greenery, a streak of dirt on his face. Harry wants to cry sometimes, missing Elphie, but he mustn’t, because Minnie is hurting more than him, and he mustn’t be a bother.
“Did he tell you, Harry?” Granger asked.
His parents are worried, sending him into a castle full of people who would either shun him or deride him for being a Malfoy. ‘That is a burden you must bear for being my son,’ Father said last night, his eyes full of sorrow. ‘I am so sorry, love.’
him, he's mine!" the omega shouts, deep voice ringing in the charged metallic air, pushing aside men, stepping towards Eltanin.
‘What do you want, Malfoy?’ Potter asked, his tone deadly serious.
‘Harry,’ he sputters, blood dribbling down his chin.
On her pristine cream couch, Narcissa Malfoy winced.
‘And I hope,’ he added, ‘that spending time together would force the two of you to at least be
‘Mr Harry Potter,’ he pronounces. ‘Ahh … I remember when your parents first came in here for their wands. Eleven inches, mahogany, deer heartstring core for your father—a loyal, steadfast wand. And your mother’s was ten and a quarter inches, willow, unicorn hair—a powerful wand, very good for delicate charm and potion work, which I heard were her special skills. I wonder … what wand will choose you?’
‘What’s the matter, Potter? Afraid the ponce might ravish you?’ Draco leered, his hands stuffed in his pockets.
There was a dull silence, before old Mrs Longbottom broke in with an appalled cry. ‘Godric, with the number of people he has killed, he could have countless of those Horcruxes by now!’
‘We were trying for the fifth time to find a way out of the castle, to break the siege, for our supplies were desperately low, and there were so many of us sick or injured … The Knights came upon us before we knew it, and Colin was one of the first to fall. I … I knew it was fatal – I was right beside him. He …’ Harry swallows; he cannot falter now. ‘He begged me to save him. He told me not to leave him, because he will be killed, but I … I had to go. I could not … I could not …’
‘Your bedroom. It’s inevitable, don’t you reckon?’
‘I’m pleasantly surprised by you, Potter,’ Zabini says, his smile surprisingly friendly. ‘I thought all Gryffindors, with the exception of Malfoy and Granger, have no patience for the delicacy of Potions work.’
Yaxley blasted the gargoyle apart. They clambered up the frozen staircase and burst onto – a silent empty office. Dumbledore clearly hadn’t been in his office in hours. The Carrows surged in, tearing into the back rooms. Dumbledore wasn’t in bed either. Swearing, Yaxley cast a Location spell.
Zabini stood up and began leading the way back to the Slytherin dungeons. ‘Yeah, I didn’t see anyone at all to be honest. But I thought you might appreciate the company, Malfoy. Don’t be ungrateful now.’ He punctuated his teasing words with a face-splitting yawn.
The wandmaker reappears with two wand boxes. He hesitates for a moment, glancing between the two boxes, before handing Harry the left one. ‘Go on. Try that one. Give it a wave,’ he urges.
Ginny Weasley, enough for him to feel it even from Wiltshire. He can still smell Weasley, like iron shavings and coal mixed into Harry’s sweet scent of melting caramel—infuriating.
Draco sneers. ‘Well, you could have fooled me, Potter.’

They served their detention with Filch on Friday night. The bitter old Squib set them to the utterly meaningless task of smoothening the scratched surfaces of old desks. Draco thought it would be easy enough until Filch opened the door to the brightly lit storeroom and he saw the veritable mountain of desks.
‘Shut up!’ Bellatrix sneered. ‘You have no right to speak

He doesn’t want to see Draco, who has sneaked out of the dormitory to visit him at night. His other friends have realised early on he doesn’t like the fuss, after the few times this happened in their first year. The official diagnosis entirely fabricated by Sirius is magical trauma, caused by his stay with his abusive Muggle relations, which relapses once in a while.
‘Yes, he did,’ said Ernie Macmillan, who was passing by.
‘How could you?’ Potter’s voice was soft.
‘Harry knows his food, Headmistress,’ Luna piped up. ‘That’s why I asked him. He will work very well with the house elves, I think. His Kreacher can help lead them.’
Draco gives a rueful laugh, his fist softening in Harry’s hold, interlocking his fingers with Harry’s with care. ‘I hope you do.’ But he doesn’t really think Harry could, because he’s only human. They—Minnie and Dumbledore too—explained away Draco’s ability to find him in the graveyard as a Veela power, nothing surprising, but Harry knows he hears Draco in a way that is something else more.
‘Thank you,’ Draco whispers, slipping in between him and Granger, his face flushed with embarrassment not because the Gryffindors didn’t cheer for him, but because of the wide grin on Potter’s face.
They parted, gasping. Draco rested his head on Potter’s chest, listening to Potter’s heartbeat.
Rationally, he knew he should let Potter go. Out of sight, out of mind, and this ridiculous Veela infatuation would disappear. Irrationally, the thought of not seeing Potter again was a terror as potent as the Dark Lord breathing down his neck. Draco was in a wretched state of confusion.
His parents gaze at him, concerned and befuddled. He knows that they want to help him, but they are at an utter loss
“What life? My life as a wizard is over, remember? I’m a Veela now,” Draco said sarcastically, gesturing to his body.
Draco frowned, confused. ‘Er … yeah, I have a faint memory of a Victor …’
Muggle society marks this contraction in the Netherfield party with little consequence, for the militia in town. The wizards are a little leery of the gathering so many men in military attire; their experience of the havoc caused by men united by delusion and costume is too near for comfort. Still, Harry must admit that it is a fresh thrill to see the officers in their smart red coats and tight white breeches.
He quickly looks away in the mirror, keeping his eyes down. He raises his arms as he is told, shaking a little as he does so, because he can still feel the waves of fury emanating from the other boy. It’s a little like a terrifying, out-of-control flight straight into the eye of a crashing storm, knowing that a perfect stranger absolutely loathes him. Harry guesses that it might have to do with the fact that he is Harry Potter, but no, that is far too conceited to think – isn’t it?
‘Good afternoon, Mr Ollivander,’ Moony says.
. I shall be the one to hand the boy over –
He accompanied Dumbledore to visit an old, fat professor, Horace Slughorn, to retrieve a memory the poor man was reluctant to give up. ‘Horcruxes,’ Dumbledore said grimly later. ‘He has split his soul into fragments and put them into objects. So long as the objects exist, so does that piece of his soul. Theoretically, he can live forever.’
The only good thing to have come out of this is that Harry no longer has to see the Crown Prince. His stint with the Aurors ended yesterday, while Harry has been ordered to stay at home, because a horny alpha is a danger to all omegas in the office. Funny how a

If it is not wrong, why does Sirius’s family want to kill him?
Hands grabbed his shoulder, and pain was a thousand needlepoints stabbing his body. His shriek tore at his throat; blood and saliva and sweet-salty pus flooded his mouth.
It was just like Hermione to feed him information that left him with a belly full of wriggling Flobberworms; he was unnerved and a little sick. He shook off his uneasiness, determined to enjoy himself, to prove Hermione wrong.
“All right,” Draco said softly. “Tell me.”
him. As he waits for his turn, he wonders how his parents might react when they find out he’s in Gryffindor.
‘Well, in that case …’ Draco says, mollified. ‘I don’t know actually. I’ve never met another Veela. Father and Mother must have, of course; they had to go to France to convince my birth parents to give me to them. They raised me as human, so you would do very well to treat me as such too.’
‘I bumped into them at Diagon Alley,’ Parkinson said. She came in and went straight to Zabini’s side. ‘Hullo, sweetheart.’ She dropped a peck on his upturned cheek. ‘I told them to come join us for dinner. Greg wouldn’t mind – he loves cooking big dinners, don’t you, Greg?’
“Don’t worry,” Potter repeated, a forbidding cold look on his face. “We wouldn’t want it to be known that pureblood wizard Draco Malfoy is now a pureblood Veela, would we?”
“Draco,” Theo poked him in the arm. “You really should talk. Potter is an Auror trying to
Potter’s eyes flashed, remembering Umbridge, remembering the indignation of being accused of a crime by the very institution he should trust. ‘Good for you, Malfoy, you’ll need it to save you from Azkaban when they find out what you are.’
‘Which House are you from?’ Lionel the Gryffindor asked.
His beauty is only another wearisome Veela burden to bear: he has never considered it any other way—until now. He straightens up, lifting his chin, a smirk growing across his face. Harry flushes, uncomfortable. Neville merely looks puzzled.
A week later, the neighbourhood is alive with news that Bingley has left Netherfield for the foreseeable future. He has returned to York.
Draco flinches like Harry is coming at him on a rampaging hippogriff. ‘I’ve never thought you are weak.’
‘No problem.’
‘You look ill,’ Myrtle said in her usual lugubrious manner, hovering over his shoulder.
‘You and your oversized chicken?’ Voldemort sneers at Draco. ‘I am sorry Lucius is dead—he was a most devoted follower.’
Harry laughed, his laughter rumbling through Draco as well. “I guess not. Too much has happened between us.”
Draco no longer smiles like he used to—like he is teasing a delicious secret—or laughs at all—the sound that would ignite liquid light in Harry’s chest—but it’s fine. Because they are still soulmates, soul-bonded; they still have each other. On the nights Draco crumbles into soundless weeping, it is Harry who will hold him, because this is his fault.
.” Some form of rejection, you see. I must say that I am glad to have these expectations ruined.’
His eyes snap open, gleaming silver in the darkness. His breathing rapid and uneven, he scrambles onto his hands and feet, sinking into soft moist soil. The statue straightens up, stone grinding stone with a rumbling groan.
be taken like this by such a creature. His rage is hot and molten in his belly, heating his skin, searing his mind.
‘Yes, but he thought you were the baby of a prophecy concerning him—a prophecy that foretold the person who would end his reign of terror. I will share the prophecy with you when you are older—I am still deciphering it myself—but it essentially foretold his death, and Voldemort sought to destroy an enemy before the enemy could truly become a threat.’
The second kiss was even better than the first. This time, their eyes were closed. Harry’s lips moved against his, dry and slightly chapped. They opened their mouths, and their tongues slid against each other.
Draco is getting to his feet, his movement stiff and tensed. Harry steps forward, taking Draco’s arm again, his hand going around the other man’s bony wrist.
They stood in the only clear space near the door, the towers of old desks terracing up to the ceiling in all directions. In the gaps between the stacked desks, Draco caught a glimpse of the far wall; it was all windows open to the cold night, a breeze slipping in once in a while.
He lets go of his legs, stretching them out, as he turns to face Harry properly. Grey eyes scour Harry’s face. Draco slips his arms around Harry’s waist, his face questioning. When Harry rolls his eyes and drags him in closer, the blond smirks and locks his hands behind Harry. They are close enough for Harry to feel Draco’s cool breath on his cheek, for Harry to see the way Draco’s eyes are silver in the starlight.
“Take my arm,” Potter said, proffering his right arm. “I’ll Side-Along you.”
‘Well, we will rest easy once term starts – that is when she becomes the
,’ Ron said doubtfully, after he and Harry made up, and Hermione dispatched him to talk to Draco. ‘I’ve never seen Draco so … weird.’
Sirius complained, until Moony quelled him with a warning look. The werewolf pressed a kiss to Harry’s forehead, and made him promise to come for lunch every Saturday. It isn’t about his godfathers, but that he has gotten used to the luxury of a place to himself over the past few years.
‘Yeah, but we’re just friends!’ Harry yelps, his face suffused with itchy heat. ‘Merlin. Have people been saying this all along?’
‘Expelled?’ Potter looked between the two of them with complete bewilderment. ‘Hermione, look, it’s just snogging. You don’t have to tell Dumbledore, for Merlin’s sake. He doesn’t want to know about our love lives! Don’t be ridiculous.’
‘Who are you trying to curse, Malfoy? Who was the necklace for?’ Potter strode forward, stabbing his wand into Draco’s chest.
‘Are you not going to tell him why he must hide the fact that he is omega?’ Minnie asked in a freezing tone.
Potter was breathing faster, his chest rising and falling rapidly, almost brushing Draco’s. Draco kept his eyes fixed on Potter’s face, tracing at random Potter’s features: strong jawline, broad cheekbones, soft lips shining wet in anticipation. His breath hitched in his throat, his desire coiling deep in his belly, warm and certain.
“That’s good to know,” Draco interjected, unable to help himself.
Zabini’s eyes widened and he struck like a viper, too fast for Draco to stop him. He seized Draco’s arm, jerking up the sleeve. The Dark Mark gleamed in the bright lantern light menacingly. Draco felt its presence as a physical weight on his arm. When Zabini released him, his arm fell back to his side like a stone.
“Yeah … and … and I’m so relieved you feel the same way,” Harry was flushing. “The potion – I used a strand of my hair. I thought I … I could anchor your soul to me, to this world, so you wouldn’t – wouldn’t die. I didn’t understand the implications until Healer Mitra explained afterwards. By then it was too late … still, I couldn’t have allowed you to die.”
, even after the first time Harry called him
‘My pretty one,’ Jonas murmured into the pillow and Draco’s fantasy of a dark-haired man who smiled as he said
Seated comfortably, the Bennet siblings can now examine each other at luxury. Harry is gratified to see Mary well. The quietest of his sisters with awkward manners, Mary did not find it easy living amongst four other sisters pretty and memorable in their own ways. It was at Hogwarts and in Ravenclaw that she flourished and revealed her genius in Potion-making. She carries herself with assurance now, her smile wide and vibrant, and she addresses her siblings with none of the painful self-consciousness that marred her childhood.
Draco’s parents don’t know this, but their soundproofing charm doesn’t work very well against Veela ears. If Draco presses his ears against the door and listens very carefully, he can hear their conversation rather well. They have set an alarm spell on the door now, so Draco has to be quite creative with his eavesdropping techniques.
He returns her grin, rubbing the wetness from his face. ‘Brilliant! I’m starving. Let’s go!’ He tugs on her hand, urging her to walk faster. Her grumbles about being an old woman disappear when Harry goads her. Soon, the two of them are racing across the field, Minnie yelling, ‘Cheater,’ and both breathless with laughter.
Draco stepped into the living room, a dark, shuttered room that smelled of old socks and damp clothes. He flicked his wand, lighting the lamps. He sat down gingerly in one of the two dusty armchairs huddled around a small, filthy fireplace. Theo was clearly a poor housekeeper.
the Sorting Hat nearly put me in Slytherin and perhaps I should have gone there – might have helped me kill Voldemort earlier.’
!’ Potter roared, slashing his wand like a whip.
wanted anyway.
He looks up from where he is kneeling in the mud. Potter has not moved from the side of the cauldron. His anger has faded into confusion.
Harry doesn’t want to see such anxiety in his godfathers’ eyes, so after that first month, he does his best to take the potion without flinching; to force himself to be patient because while he is weak the first few days, he does recover his strength. There are days he cannot sleep, kept awake by nightmares of his magic disappearing and having to go back to the Muggle world, but he hides those days from Minnie, Sirius and Moony. They won’t know how he has cried.
Draco bends down, capturing Harry’s mouth with his, a hand buried in his lover’s messy curls. Harry has gathered Draco’s long blond hair in fists, rough enough to hurt in a way that only sends lightning skittering under his skin. He shivers, pressing closer,
He nods, dropping his hands, and asks falteringly: ‘Would you … that is, do you think you might—’ he cuts himself off with a groan, an angry twist to his mouth.
Potter made a sound of disbelief. ‘Don’t be a wanker, Malfoy. You and I both know the Map is mine. Shut up. What are you doing here?’
‘Why did you say yes then?’ Harry demands.
Harry thinks of words to explain: surely, Sirius as another omega with a soulmate would understand, but his godfather had always been certain of his person, self-assurance that does not falter. Harry doesn’t have the words; what he has are fading dreams and fleeting impressions.
The worst part was knowing that Malfoy hadn’t been taking any love potion. He had been perfectly lucid every moment he spent together with Harry. He didn’t have to tell Harry all those things he did, telling him about his childhood, about how much he loved his parents, about the secret rooms he would hide in to avoid a caning. He didn’t have to hold Harry as tightly as he did while Harry was telling him about the cupboard under the stairs. He didn’t have to look at Harry with those
‘Get Severus,’ Dumbledore says to McGonagall, as he kneels by the fireplace, which blazes to life.
trying to kiss me.’
to say. Now that the war has been mentioned between them, it seems improbable that they would converse with any ease. Their arrangement so far has been established upon a silent mutual agreement to avoid all talk of war.
“They served their time,” Harry interrupted, hand moving back to Draco’s face in a very distracting manner. “For all their flaws and crimes, they are still your parents. They love you deeply, and you love them. Right?”
‘You traitor,’ he snarls at Draco. ‘You said you would help me. We need to save
Draco bristles, but before he can reply, Black and Lupin step down to the platform. Lupin is looking at him consideringly, a slight frown between his brows. Draco raises his chin, meeting Lupin’s gaze unflinchingly, and gasps when something sharp scrapes against his mind. In that moment, both he and Lupin recognise each other as alpha.
"Alpha," he gasped in clumsy Parseltongue.
‘Filthy coward,’ his aunt snarled, spinning around and raising her hand to strike him.
Harry turns to see Zabini bowing to him. Sir William has since begged Harry’s leave to attend to his other guests. Harry returns Zabini’s bow. Though Zabini, like the other Slytherins, was always willing to be amused by Malfoy’s jibes at Harry and his friends, Harry feels no real animosity towards the tall, dark man. He is also innocent of any war crime, save for a greater concern for saving one’s own skin. Harry could hardly hold that against anyone; he knows the primal instinct for survival very well.

He couldn’t sleep the slightest bit, and got up before Harry. He thinks he will make the pancakes first. Surprise Harry with breakfast in bed. Show him that Draco truly is the perfect roommate, and Harry mustn’t move out.
need another drink. Would you like one more?’
‘This isn’t my wand.
And he is filled with the icy-cold certainty that Minnie will send him back now, because Elphie is gone, and she is sad, and Harry has done nothing, but make her angry. His knees nearly buckle beneath him, and he holds on tighter to the broom to remain standing.
Harry has never seen Dumbledore look so uncomfortable – or abashed. The old wizard stands in the doorway to the kitchen, his face deeply creased with worry lines. Harry, Sirius and Moony turn as one to look at Minnie, who has paused in the midst of putting a piece of potato in her mouth.
Harry stares at him. The blonde gentleman has angled his body away from Harry, his fists clenched on his lap. Harry remembers another clenched fist, smaller, younger, catching onto his coat. The words echo in his mind: ‘Do not leave me, Harry. He will kill me.’ Harry looks away and swallows the rest of his drink. The whiskey burns on its way down his throat.
a little snake in the golden lion after all.
And Bellatrix fell. Aunt Andromeda broke off with a savage wail, turning away into Uncle Ted’s arms, and they both sobbed. Mother stared down at her sister’s broken body, and with a brutality Draco didn’t expect, kicked the corpse hard. She looked up and met Draco’s eyes with a frosty, steely glare. Narcissa Malfoy is not a woman anyone should cross.
‘What fine hunting we will have!’ he cried. ‘Mr. Bennet, I do hope you will join my party and I in our hunting when we are more settled here. I am most happy to find such welcoming neighbours in Hertfordshire. Why, I have not lacked for dinner invitations since I came!’
‘I’ve been neglecting you, my boy,’ she says. ‘I will

He didn’t try probing further. If Luna wanted to tell you something, she would have said it already. Instead, Harry sighed, getting to his feet. As they were walking out to the gates, accompanied by a chatty Sarah, Parkinson called out to Harry.

The Great Hall is buzzing with chatter; nearly the entire Slytherin table is goggling at him. Potter looks at him quizzically, but Draco simply shakes his head. The group of first-years slowly whittles down, and finally, it is Potter’s turn. The Hat takes longer than anybody else – longer than Granger or Longbottom – long enough for McGonagall to frown a little. Until, finally, the Hat announces, ‘
regularly, despite Rita Skeeter’s trash pieces. Draco wants to ask him what’s wrong: sit Harry down with a slice of his favourite treacle tart and demand to know how he can help; take Harry’s hands between his and soothe the aches and shivers; but he mustn’t—not if it gives people the wrong idea.
‘Why do you still call me Malfoy then?’ he asks bitterly. ‘What does it take for me to be enough of a friend for you to call me by my first name? You certainly have no problem calling Parkinson Pansy, and Zabini Blaise the past few months. Why do you still call me Malfoy? I am not my father, Harry!’
“Ah, yes,” Potter sprinkled his chips in salt; he liked his food far too salty.
Draco moans, and wraps his arms around Harry, rolling onto his back and holding Harry in his arms. ‘Do you mean it?’ he asks.
There are three cloaked figures waiting for them in the cold windowless room smelling of rotting trees, and they are dismayed to see Harry Potter, the famed Boy Who Lived and Dark Lord killer. It is not hard to realise whom they are: the anti-royalist terrorist group, who call themselves Martyrs. Malfoy has been receiving threats from these fuckers since he was a child.
‘I don’t know. It’s hard when you keep me up half the night,’ Draco replied, closing his eyes and leaning into Potter’s hand.
He thought Potter would avoid him now; on the contrary, Potter now seemed all the more determined to catch him in the act. With the Map back in his hands, he was following Draco around everywhere now. Draco was always catching Potter at the corner of his eye.
Theo worked at Flourish & Blotts, and dropped by often to have lunch with Draco. Draco admitted they didn’t have much in common, but Theo was sensible and moderate in a way the people around him had never been.
Draco flinches. It is a voice he knows well. How many times has he heard the voice swearing, shouting abuse at Draco, loathing and fury threaded through every syllable? Or the times he overhead the same voice, but softer and kinder and happier, whispering with a friend at the back of a classroom, laughter echoing in its wake? Yes, it is a voice he knows well.
‘Oh, don’t get me wrong, Lovegood,’ McGonagall said. ‘I am sure Potter can be useful. I am merely a trifle annoyed,’ she pinned him with a stern look that sent him straight back to first year, ‘that he had neglected to respond favourably to my requests for him to join the committee and that it took your plying him with enough alcohol to get him to agree. Yes, Lovegood, I heard this from Longbottom. I had tea with his grandmother over the weekend.’
The grin he flashed Draco told him he was half-kidding. Draco nodded.
‘I beg your pardon, Sirius, I will gladly take all ownership for that quality in Harry,’ Minnie interjected, casting an approving eye upon Harry’s ink-stained hands. ‘What questions do you have today, Harry?’
Mother grabs his knee, stilling his leg, and gives him a slow, glittering smile that means trouble when they are at home. He looks at her sheepishly, tilting his head; if he looks adorable enough, Mother might just forget his transgression by the time they are home. Besides, this is
He is Draco Malfoy. He is a Veela, better, faster, stronger than any wizard. Not to him, this cannot happen to
Draco’s ears are ringing. Someone is shouting his name, shaking his shoulder and sending spikes of pain through his head. It’s a familiar voice—
The room was dead silent as the Golden Trio made their way out. It was only when Potter had gone that the other students began moving again. Most of them avoided Draco’s gaze. Zabini didn’t look at him when he left.
The next morning, Eltanin's robes were wrapped around him, and he lay alone.
Wesley tore him apart like that. We told him, we
It hurt to even breathe. He was being pressed into the hard stone floor, the old wood grinding his flesh and bones into the ground. He couldn’t bear it for much longer.
‘Did you think I wouldn’t?’ Draco asks. ‘The most difficult thing about the past year was that firstly, I physically couldn’t go after you, and I couldn’t ask my mother to look for you, because,’ – he makes a face – ‘nobody should know about how you were breaking the sodding law.
Draco reaches out, cutting open Harry’s robes with a claw, pressing his palms flat against Harry’s convulsing body, closing his eyes. He doesn’t understand how Veela healing works, much like how he doesn’t understand anything else of what it means to be Veela. It’s like drawing on a well within him, buckets of sweet clear water, except he is summoning torrents and torrents of that shimmering water and pouring them into Harry.
Harry shoves Malfoy behind him,
McGonagall pauses, studying Draco keenly. She looks up at the Headmaster, as does Draco. The old man is sitting in the middle, the wizard who visited Malfoy Manor a year ago and agreed that they should take Draco in for school. He gazes at Draco, his expression cryptic. Draco meets his gaze, pleading desperately with his eyes, even if he doesn’t understand why. After a beat, the Headmaster gives McGonagall an imperceptible nod. With a shrug, McGonagall calls the next name, and Draco steps aside.
Narcissa and Lucius exchange quick glances; she looks at Alena, who gives them an encouraging nod and smile. Narcissa walks forward, closely shadowed by Lucius. The mother moves the folds of the cloth aside to reveal a sleeping baby boy. Narcissa nearly weeps at the sight of such a perfect baby: his cherubic face, long eyelashes, and tiny little nose.
Zabini chuckles, his laughter low and attractive. ‘Perhaps not at this juncture,’ he agrees. ‘Well, Bennet, your first step is phenomenally simple. Walk over there, and ask him for a dance.’
She smiled, the distant moon glowing in a clouded sky. ‘You won’t regret it, Harry,’ she promised. ‘Here, let me get you another drink. Beer again?’ She skipped off, ducking behind the counter to grab their drinks.
He pushed himself up on an elbow to see Harry looking at him from under heavy-lidded eyes, half-dazed with lust and sleepiness. Draco swore, disentangling himself from Harry in a hurry and falling back onto the carpeted floor.
Potter’s hand hovers above the curve of Draco’s cheek, close enough for Draco to feel the heat, for his skin to tingle.
She tried for a casual shrug. Seeing the look on his face, she gave up with a sigh. ‘Tell me the truth, Harry – do you like being an Auror?’
He adds it to the small pile on the chair next to him – his godfathers and Minnie gave their presents to him at the start of dinner. It’s Harry’s rule that he will only open his presents at the end of his birthday; after years of watching Dudley tear apart presents the moment he lays his grubby hands on them, Harry would rather savour the moment. Besides, half of the excitement of getting presents is not knowing what’s in them yet.
bad idea. He should have jumped to his feet and escaped to his room. At that moment, Potter walked back into the room wearing those Muggle clothes and smiling cheerfully.
It is looking down at its hands, brown skin smeared with mud, fingernails encrusted with grave dirt. It moves the hands up to its face, down its neck, over the protruding ribs and prominent hipbones. It stares down at its feet still stuck within the leftover soup of potion. It is very still, the moonlight on its skin colouring it granite.
“No, I – “
Albus Dumbledore tilts his head, listening, and soon enough, they hear Lily Potter’s laughter and the midwife’s soft murmuring response. Albus nods, and James flies across the small room and thunders up the stairs. The sound of the young father’s joyful and effusive greeting echoes throughout the house, joined by his wife’s teasing admonishment to
Harry reckons his preference to bottom—which goes completely contrary to expected alpha behaviour—might have something to do with it. Little wonder Malfoy finds him as appalling as he does. His mate would of course, be some fine noble specimen of an alpha—a far cry from the sad lump Harry has been reduced to, quivering with longing for a man he cannot have.
Zabini laughed as the rest of them gaped at Draco.
A delicious shiver stole down his spine.
, but there’s no point because I was already in love with him by then, the stupid pillock.’
The clouds drift across the moon, and the moonlight fades, the shadows thickening on the ground.

me and you’re wanking in front of me and –’
They were back in Hogwarts for their eighth year, Malfoy was changed, and Harry found that he didn’t understand after all. What could he know of what Malfoy suffered? Or what his own friends – Ginny and Neville, who were trapped in Hogwarts for a year – suffered? His own incomprehension grated against him, and he was lost about what he could say to Malfoy.
"Pristine?" Eltanin echoes. The flash of his anger shocks him: he feels his sanity and reason unravelling with fury, his control fraying at the edges. There is a fog drawing close around his mind; nearly the same from that night under the stars, except this time, he is misty with rage.
before and loved it. We told Teddy he can’t transform in front of Muggles anymore or we would have to take him out of kindergarten – Ministry orders and all that. Teddy was so upset …”
, he thinks.
Harry had sit up with him. He gingerly placed his arm around Draco, and when Draco did not protest, he held him more firmly.
Draco stares at him, his face still. A heartbeat passes, five heartbeats – long enough for Harry to realise that he has gone and put everything out for Draco’s taking. He shakes his head, clenching and unclenching his fists. His heartbeat is thunderous in his ears, and his face is flushed, his skin overheating from the rush of blood.
Rather pathetic as insults went, but his friends – sans Zabini – laughed dutifully. Weasley went away after sputtering some nonsense, Granger yanking him along.
Draco knew he had to say something anyway. Seeing Potter angry with him made his heart ache terribly.
‘We have only known him a day,’ Harry interjects. ‘We are not certain he is as reliable as we wish him to be.’
Draco smirked, warm with satisfaction, and gave in. He hooked his fingers on the elastic and pulled Potter’s pants down. Potter’s cock sprang up so quickly it nearly smacked Draco in the face. Draco drew back a little so he could have a better look. His mouth watered; fuck, he was such a slag.
He draws back, desperate that Draco would not have seen the memories that weigh on his mind.
Draco turns away, his cheeks burning, his heart beating hard.
Draco remembered the last night of the Triwizard Tournament, when Potter came stumbling out of the maze, white-faced, clutching Cedric Diggory’s dead body. Potter had looked small and broken out there in the middle of the Quidditch pitch before Dumbledore and the others closed around him.
‘So that’s how it is? You can snog me knowing you’re helping the man who wants me dead,’ Potter spat, his words, his eyes vicious.
The dark curtains in his mind part, and he is feeling everything all at once: piercing agony intense to the point of sweetness, and—relief, cool and clear and rushing.
‘From the beginning, your survival of the Killing Curse is a symbol of hope, of liberation, because somehow, a hapless baby,’ – their eyes turned inexorably towards Teddy – ‘prevailed over one of the most powerful Dark wizards in Britain. I know you hate the way people look at you, the way the papers write about you, but it’s understandable – you
That was nearly his undoing. Draco leaned in closer. He could see Potter’s wide eyes, the gold flecks amongst the green. Potter smelled of sweat and dust and that faint mellow soap he used. His soft lips were slightly parted, and he was breathing heavily, almost panting in anticipation.
Draco remembered his grandparents only as a croaking disapproving voice through a scarlet-red Howler sent when he was five.
Even Quidditch was no longer as fun as he thought it was. He could be up in the air, searching for the Snitch and his mind would be back in the dusty enclosed hall of the Room of Hidden Things.
"Alarming us? Is that what you call storming into one's home fully armed and unannounced?" Blaise replies in growly Leon, his scent layered with the char of anger.
Despite it all, they couldn’t stay away from each other. As November bled into December, Draco came to know every nook and cranny of Hogwarts very well indeed because they were snogging in every corner of the school. They had kissed sprawled out in the middle of the Quidditch pitch, they had kissed in the locker rooms, they had kissed in countless empty classrooms, and they had kissed in secret rooms the Map showed them.
of everything Harry Potter.
Moony is already running towards the stairs, shouting over his shoulder: ‘Harry, stay here!’
‘He was
‘I remember,’ he says numbly.
He peers at Eltanin from under his lashes, and what he sees must have assured him, because he manages a small smile, before dropping his gaze. "You think me ugly, don't you? I am not pristine."
Harry opens his mouth, and finds the words missing. What does he say? What does he want to say? He did not start the night expecting to see Draco, to touch Draco. His thinking and thinking and overthinking have not inspired any sort of grand course of action to set everything proper. He closes his eyes briefly.
Harry’s books also say Veelas have another form: big, ugly birds the size of humans, with dirty wings and steel beaks. He flinches at the drawings that flexed and crawled across the pages; he finds it impossible to imagine Draco Malfoy as such a deformed beast.
it really is Potter.’
There were bottles of Butterbeer around them, which Draco had nicked from the kitchens. It had become a habit of sorts, between the two of them, for Draco to bring Butterbeer to their snogging sessions. It was amazing how thirsty snogging could make one.
Suddenly, the door flew open, sending Zabini flying backwards onto Crabbe’s lap. Crabbe reared up in anger, dumping Zabini onto the ground. Zabini leapt up, indignant, hurling abuse at Crabbe for being a boor. Crabbe bawled back. Goyle was on his feet too, stepping up between them, hands on Crabbe’s chest, pushing him back into his seat.
Harry colours, looking down. He takes a moment to compose his thoughts. This, he remembers of Malfoy: the other gentleman’s damnable ability to discombobulate him.
The Christmas Ball planning committee were clustered at the end of the Gryffindor table, most of them turning to look when Hagrid and Harry walked in. Harry returned Luna’s welcoming smile before glancing over the rest of the crowd. There were all the professors, of course, including a McGonagall, who was looking particularly forbidding. Out of the students, he only knew Luna, Zabini and Parkinson.
‘Draco, calm down,’ Neville says, still not lowering his wand; Draco reflects distantly that he must look quite rabid. ‘Voldemort is gone, isn’t he? Is the snake dead? Do you have the cup?’
He admits with great reluctance: ‘I felt it … when the bit of
‘Ah … Lucius has taught you Occlumency, I see. What thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master, Draco?’
‘I do not know if you could bring yourself to forgive me. Yet … I have decided to confess that I am deeply in love with you,’ Harry blushes, closing his eyes for fear of bursting into flames; he is too warm in his own skin. ‘For I do love you, Draco. I do not think I deserve to, because I was not strong enough four years ago. I – I abandoned you.’
‘No – I meant it as a – No, I didn’t mean it like
Draco pulls away abruptly, causing Harry to frown. He slips his hand into Harry’s, tugging. ‘Come on.’
‘And I’m going to take it a step further,’ Zabini announces, and swiftly licks his thumb before swiping it against Harry’s neck.
Harry rested his head against Draco’s stretched-out arm, his face millimetres away from Draco’s. “Everything.”
‘Hermione isn’t an obnoxious know-it-all,’ Potter said huffily. ‘She’s just really smart and she likes learning and – oh, all right,’ he muttered at the look on Draco’s face. ‘She
‘I see what you’re trying to tell me and I know there will always be outliers in a family … Look at Sirius and his family. Merlin, even my aunt Petunia! From what I can tell, my mother’s parents seem like nice people … are you trying to tell me you can be different, Malfoy?’
It is too late to think of an excuse not to go, and Mother is too happy to see him invited to her cousin’s home for him to bear disappointing her. He arrives at Number 12 Grimmauld Place with his stomach cramping, clutching the expensive box of chocolates Mother made him bring. Laughing at his expression, Harry presses the doorbell.
‘No!’ Neville grabs Draco’s arm, yanking him backwards. ‘Draco, don’t let him do this. We can’t just blunder into Hogsmeade. We are giving Voldemort exactly what he wants.’
‘Yeah. Zabini too. They’re really good at finding sponsors,’ Luna said.
"We both know there are nastier things you can think to do with your knot," Potter replies calmly. "And I don't think you can afford to be picky with the kings you lay with now, my dear prince. There is nothing left for you here, like you said. Your place has always been with
His eyes darted to Draco, and then away, leaving Draco with mingled confusion and nervousness.
“And … and he mentioned that quite a number of pureblood families have non-wizard ancestors, which strengthened the magic in the blood actually. He said it was kind of a joke how ‘families like the Malfoys would trumpet blood purity when they had Veela blood in their veins.’”
‘Saving you?’ Harry repeats, dumb-founded.
He winced. Potter had managed to land a few hard blows. He probed his left side warily, wondering if going down to Pomfrey was worth the effort. Perhaps tomorrow: all he wanted right now was to curl up in bed.
Now, he would never have another chance again.
Absently, Harry reflects how he will not be able to watch her take on the Ministry. There are many things he would miss when he dies tonight. Before he faces Voldemort, they must find the diadem and destroy Hufflepuff’s cup and the last mysterious Horcrux, so that his death would truly mean the end of this fucking war.
So Malfoy spoke to Harry first.
, memorising the plants in the textbook Minnie and he are working through, but worth it when Minnie and his godfathers are so pleased with him—even if Sirius teases him for being the most bookish eight-year-old in Britain.
it at first—stubborn berk—I didn’t care either way.
‘Brilliant,’ Zabini drawled. ‘And you, Crabbe?’
The Muggles are eager to welcome Bingley and his party into their fold. They are unfazed by the obvious reticence of the Longbourn families. Most residents of Meryton agree that while the Longbourn families are most amiable neighbours and jolly fun at balls and parties, they are distinctly
He is relieved that they are able to have such desultory conversations, that his greatest responsibility for now is to choose a winning Quidditch team. He looks down at the parchment, running his thumb over the scrawled names. He must savour these moments while he can—like his time with Draco.
‘The French are more likely to accept him—they should be, since their Headmistress is half-giant,’ Father says. ‘No, I agree with you, Cissy, I’m only saying what’s true. I do wish Draco could attend Hogwarts like we did.’
The great house is silent around them, the house elves having retired for the night and the magical furniture dormant. Narcissa moved back to Malfoy Manor, even though Sirius and Remus wanted her to stay with them at Grimmauld Place; even though she was all alone after Draco disappeared. This is the first time Harry has seen her since Lucius Malfoy’s funeral three months ago.
He began to slowly make his way down and Draco could only follow him.
Draco stared at him. Nothing before his eyes made sense. Not the handsome, dark-skinned Healer in luridly green robes, not the sunlit cheerful room he was in, not the poster of a phoenix that repeatedly burst in flames and rose from the ashes.
‘Your mate does not reject you. You only need … time. To heal, to … remember yourself,’ Mathis says. ‘That is why we are here. Your soul is defined by your bond, yes, but your soul is
“I’m sorry,” Harry said into the silence.
? When he was eight? Why?’
“For what?” Theo had a shockingly acerbic laugh. “I’m better off than the others, aren’t I? At least I’m not like Parkinson, chased out of the country. Or like poor Goyle, imprisoned in Azkaban for saying the wrong things during his trial. What an idiot.”
Harry was lounging on the couch, leaning against Ginny, his eyes closed, when someone said his name directly above him. He opened his eyes, frowning in irritation because he was trying to take a nap, and saw Malfoy’s pale, pointed face right in front of him. He jerked upright, the textbook open on his lap tumbling to the floor. His friends turned to stare at him – and at Malfoy, when they realised who had joined them.
Andromeda Tonks was truly glad to meet him, Draco was surprised to discover. When he tried to apologise clumsily for all the horrors she had suffered under the Death Eaters and futilely for the husband, daughter and son-in-law she had lost, she had merely held his hands, and said, “It wasn’t your fault, Draco.”
They walk through the crowded streets, hands loosely intertwined. They are separately wrapped up in their own thoughts, fully aware of the other party, the heat of promise between their palms. Draco walks next to Harry, looking beyond the streetlamps to the cloudy night sky, the soft chatter of a crowd flowing against his ears.
‘Are you all right, Harry?’ the white-haired wizard asks, stooping down next to Harry on the floor. ‘You have seen something terrible.’
Alone in the forest, Draco returned to himself bit by bit. He thought he didn’t know who he was without Harry—the insidious question Zabini planted in his head—but he has always been the person Lucius Malfoy made sacrifices to raise him to be. Father wanted to fight Voldemort for his family. At the end of the day, he was only a man who chose to protect the people he loved. Malfoys—at least the Malfoys his parents are—always protect their own.
Draco cannot move, not even his mouth. His blood is cold in his veins, and his lungs are straining with screams that cannot be heard. The man’s hand tightens on Draco, and as he feels the sickening squeeze of Apparition, he hears Pansy scream. When the darkness releases him, he is in a new place. Draco smells the closeness of the dim room and the reek of rotting food.
‘Are you talking about me?’ Seamus asked, swanning into the kitchen with Dean, Neville and Ginny in tow.
Draco peered from beneath his eyelashes at his mother, who was sitting across the table next to Aunt Bellatrix. Narcissa ate mechanically, her eyes fixed on the table in front of her. Sensing Draco’s eyes, she looked up briefly, met his eyes and dropped her gaze again.
She was trying too hard to sound casual. He looked up at her, frowning slightly. Her cheeks were slightly pink, but she met his eyes unflinchingly, a determined set to her mouth that told him she wanted to get it off her chest, whatever “it” was.
