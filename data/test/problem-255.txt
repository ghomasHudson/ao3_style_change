“Going down?” Potter asked, a hand hovering over the buttons on the panel.
Draco startled awake. “Why? What for? What’s happening?”
Andromeda ushered him towards the living room, where he could hear Scorpius’ and Teddy’s voices.
Nowadays he did see Ron from time to time when he visited Draco’s workplace in the line of his job as an Auror. He was the only one of the Aurors who treated Draco with respect, and for that, he was ever grateful. He wished he worked somewhere else, giving something back to society, but he hoped that Ron could see that he had changed and had become a better person.
“Which voices?”
Nimly nodded and started to clean up the mess while Draco rushed away.
“You didn’t think I tried that? I tried everything. I tried to wake you, I tried dragging you away from doing stupid things. I told Hermione to try to wake you but even that didn’t work."
They arrived at an empty Portkey office. Harry looked at Draco like he was contemplating something, but said nothing. He gave Draco a brief hug without saying a word, then he apparated before Draco managed to hug him back.
Draco sighed. ”If I ever agree to go on a vacation with you, I want those pictures gone, and a promise that we’ll never speak of this again.” He couldn’t believe he was actually considering going away with this git. He was very certain that it was a terrible idea. But when he looked over at Harry, who was beaming with joy, a warm feeling started to spread in his stomach. Like he thought, terrible idea.
When he neared the store the next day, he knew that it was over. The door was wide open, glass shattered around on the ground. Aurors were going in and out carrying boxes while all of the shop’s quirky magic figurines were flying around or trying to hide away in the corners of the store. Ron was standing in the middle of everything, directing his colleagues, but he stopped when he saw Draco, motioning for one of the other Aurors to take his place.
“Nope! Dean is going to surprise him with a trip to Ireland that day, you know that.”
“Fuck, Draco! Close, I’m so close!” Harry gasped out.
She snorted. “Yes, I know, and that’s what I told Potter.”
“I invited him here. Is it so hard to understand?”
Harry laughed and punched Draco lightly on the shoulder. “Let’s check into our rooms and then see what this city can offer, see if Blaise did good or not.”
She had stopped thrashing in his arms, so he let go slowly, but kept a firm grip on her arm so she couldn’t run away.
In the first year or so, Draco had been furious about not getting his own office. He’d left Gringotts to come and work for the Ministry, and with that he’d left behind a big office and his own assistants. But after a while he’d felt that his place outside the Minister's office wasn’t too bad after all. He wasn’t hidden away in a corner somewhere. Everyone could see that it was Draco Malfoy who was trusted with the Ministry’s money, and that pleased Draco immensely. And most of the day he didn’t even mind Dora gossiping, about everything and everybody. She always revealed something scandalous that he could tell Pansy later over drinks. But, some things she said about Potter rubbed him the wrong way.
Harry chuckled. “I think we’re too messy for a cleaning charm to take care of this.”
“Malfoy?” A hand was placed on Draco’s shoulder pulling him back. He turned and was met with Potter’s worried expression. “What’s going on? Are you hurt?” Potter turned to the receptionist. “What’s going on here Moira? Why hasn’t anyone helped him?”
Scorpius smiled with his whole face as he nodded his head. “Yes!” He hurried out of bed and was gone before Draco could ask him not to use too much Floo powder. He pulled the covers over his head and gave himself a minute before leaving his warm bed to get on with their day.
“Welcome to the Portkey office, how may I help you?”
Draco got an uneasy feeling in his chest, being mistaken for Lucius was not something he strived for. He quickly spelled his hair in a braid instead of keeping it down. “No mother, it’s me. I apologise, I didn’t mean to frighten you.” He took a step forward.
Harry let out a small laugh. “Sure!”
“Because maybe you want to do something for yourself for once,” Harry said exasperated.
Harry panted hard. “Tell me more. Please!”
Potter stared back. Draco could feel the tension building between them, and was just about to take a step closer, when they were interrupted by Shacklebolt, who dropped a heavy hand on each of their shoulders.
It wasn’t the first time strange things happened in this castle though. While going back through the corridors the realness of it all caught up with him: he had almost fallen out of the tower. This time before he fell asleep, he’d cast a strong locking spell on his door and set an alarm that would go off if he left his bed. But he’d managed to walk out of his room, without his wand and only in his pants, and from what he could hear, there was no alarm sounding.
“How about now? Are we there yet?” Draco said and leaned into Harry.
“I miss her,” Scorpius said, with a sigh. All too composed for a six-year-old, Draco thought.
“What?” Harry looked over at Ron, who had the most silly smile on his face.
“It’s just nice? Isn’t it nice? Everyone’s happy. Work’s over. There’s drinks. There’s no work.”
“Dora’s not here either,” Draco said.
Draco could feel that uneasy feeling again, the same one he got when his mother had mistaken him for Lucius about a week ago. He cleared his throat before he spoke, “Everything is perfectly fine with mother. No need to worry.” He turned to Scorpius. “Finish your cake darling, we need to get going.”
“I’m in love with you,” he blurted out, then instantly covered his mouth with his hands, as if he could take the words back. But Malfoy just smiled at him and sat down beside Harry on the bed.
Harry slowly eased his way into the common space, heading for his own room down the hall, when Malfoy stirred on the sofa. He stopped and looked over, only to find a pair of grey eyes looking at him.
Harry stumbled towards the table where Malfoy and Pansy was sitting, and he flopped down into an empty chair. He put his hand over Malfoy’s on the table, and cleared his throat. Malfoy raised his eyebrows and looked down at their joined hands.
Draco cleared his throat. “I wasn’t aware that you wanted me to show up.”
Potter shivered and swallowed, and then he said with a smirk “that I, indeed, am a very fine lover.”
-Inspirational quote
She was halfway down in the water when he reached her, soaking through his trousers. He tried to grab her arm to steer her back onto land, but she turned and slapped him hard across the face. “You can’t keep me locked in that house forever!” she screamed.
He didn’t.
“Still a no, Potter! And get your hands off my face.”
Harry took a step towards him. “Yes?”
“Spending time with me makes you feel like a ghost? Am I really that horrible?” Harry asked with a small smile.
“Hm, I’m not sure. Perhaps the blow to his head caused some sort of memory loss. We will run some additional tests, I’ll be back.” He nodded at Draco and left the room.
The last time he was here he’d been wasted and poured his guts out, but this time around there was an anticipation in the air, so strong you could almost cut it with a knife. Draco felt like he’d used up all the words over dinner and when he was seated on the sofa, staring at Harry’s back while he poured their drinks. His heart was racing and his palms had started to sweat. He knew with every fibre in his body that he wanted Harry, every small touch they’d exchanged during the evening ignited something in him that he had suppressed for a long time. Draco knew that a drink would’ve been perfect to calm his nerves, but he wanted to be sober for what he hoped would happen. So when Harry offered the glass he shook his head and even though his hand was shaking when Harry sat down beside him, he placed it gingerly on Harry’s thigh.
“Yes!” Draco gasped out. “I mean yes, thank you, Potter.” He didn’t care that he already dismissed the idea of asking Potter when Andromeda had hinted at it, he couldn’t say no knowing that no other healer would make an appointment with them.
Ignoring the fluttering feeling in his stomach, it was probably because due to lack of food anyway, he tried to get Malfoy’s attention again.
Draco took a sip of his drink before he answered. “No, I’ve been busy at work.” He snorted. “I guess that won’t be a problem anymore.”
“He was upset for all about ten minutes and then we snogged, and it was over and done with,” Hermione said with a smirk, knowing that Harry didn’t like the snogging part. They were like his siblings for god’s sake, they could snog all they wanted not just in front of Harry. Okay, they could do that as well but after a couple of hours a day all through summer Harry had started to find the whole thing a bit offensive. “He’s done many stupid things Harry, but he’s not a bad person. Not anymore,” she said, stroking a hand over Harry’s arm, and left him alone in the common room.
“Well, I must say,” she said, raising her hand and put it over her chest. “Did you know that he already stormed out of Mr Shacklebolt’s office last week, before the last ball? I really don’t get him! Shouldn’t he be grateful for everything we give him? He has it all, doesn't he? Would it kill him to give a little back?” she continued, completely oblivious to the fact that Draco wasn’t chipping in. She usually ranted for a while, didn’t much matter who it was that left Shacklebolt's office.
Draco was a bit overwhelmed at Ron’s sudden urge to spend time together, but perhaps a drink would be nice to clear his head and forget everything that was happening around him. He agreed to talk to his aunt and then went outside and waited to be taken away to the Ministry.
“Please, I’ll try anything to be honest. The other night I almost went into the lake, and I can’t even swim.”
“I’ll let you,” Harry grunted out, pushing back on Draco’s face.
“I’m so very sorry, miss,” Draco said, trying to lower his voice. “But if you thought that me raising my voice was being rude, you haven't seen anything yet.” Draco held a firm grip at the end of the counter, trying to not lose his temper anymore than he already had.
“Because that would’ve been a cowardly thing to do, and I’m trying to stop being a coward.”
“Oh, I didn’t know.”
Andromeda came up behind him and put her hand on Draco's shoulder, squeezing it lightly. “What now?” she asked carefully. “I could talk to Ha–”
Draco snorted out a laugh. ”Blaise isn’t my partner. He doesn’t do boyfriends.”
It was the third Ministry charity ball in just as many weeks. It had something to do with raising money for plants this time, Draco thought. Or was it war orphans? He had no clue, he got the invitations and attended no matter what, like a good Ministry boy.
Draco sat at a hidden café when an owl landed on his table. He recognised it as Blaise’s and took the letter, handing the bird the last of his churros.
“I see.” Lucius nodded, looking a little tense. “Well, maybe she forgot it here.”
Draco slumped down in his chair with a frown. He sipped from his empty glass, trying to get the few lingering drops of alcohol.
Draco was torn between wanting to stay at home more, to keep an eye on his mother and taking care of Scorpius so that the elves didn’t need to, he felt bad about letting them take care of his son the whole day, even though he knew they didn’t mind it, but at the same time, his work became his safe place. Just a place for him to be Draco, doing a mundane job but still keeping his thoughts away from everything happening at home. It was easier to deal with snooping Aurors and being questioned about his involvement in Mr Finley's shady affairs than it was seeing his mother struggle around the house with Scorpius asking more and more questions Draco didn’t know how to answer. He wanted to work, but he couldn't help but feel that if he wasn’t home to take care of Scorpius and his mother, the whole family would fall apart. He had asked Potter once how he should tell Scorpius that his mother was sick, but he’d said that Scorpius most certainly already knew something was wrong, and it was up to Draco how he wanted to explain it and how much he wanted his son to know about what was going to happen. In the end, Draco hadn’t said anything yet, half of the time he didn’t want to acknowledge what was going to happen himself, so how do you tell your son that? He just swallowed his bad conscience, worked more, and let the elves take care of everything while he hid his head in the sand.
,” he said against Draco’s lips. “Let’s wash up and have some breakfast, yeah?”
“Why didn’t you just wake me?” Harry asked him, feeling dumber by the second.
Draco cut him off. ”I didn’t strip, for Merlin’s sake!”
“So…” Draco started. “Mother has been in here?” He nodded towards the book.
Draco squinted at him. “Why was I leaving or why did I change my mind?”
Draco stopped, and instead, he nudged Harry down flat on the bed, crawling over him. Still a little loose from the night before, he conjured some lube that he smeared around his opening, before he coated Harry’s cock with the rest. He slowly sank down on him, pressing Harry’s hands over his head on the bed, kissing him until he was seated fully inside him. Taking a second to adjust, he stopped kissing Harry and instead just looked at him: his lips red and swollen from their kissing, a light sheen of sweat over his forehead. He let go of Harry’s hands and traced his own fingers over Harry’s face, over his nipples, making Harry hiss and open his eyes. He placed both of his hands on Harry’s chest and lifted himself a little, before pushing down again. Both of their moans filled the bedroom, along with the sound of flesh meeting flesh. Harry placed one hand around Draco’s hip, pushing him down with every thrust, his other hand firmly stroking Draco until he could feel his abdomen clench before he came with a broken sound all over Harry’s stomach. It was only a couple of seconds later that Harry pushed up harder as he emptied himself inside him.
Harry could feel that he was slowly floating in the air, and then there was a whooshing feeling. And everything went black.
“So, you’ve made up your mind about your mother?” Harry asked, tracing the mark on his cheek again.
He suddenly realised that they all had stopped talking, and when he looked up from staring at his cake, he could see the three of them looking at him, waiting for a response.
“If I can’t offer you a drink, is there something else you want instead?”
Harry turned abruptly and pointed a finger to Shacklebolt. “Don’t you
Draco was dragged back to reality by Scorpius who started to talk about his upcoming party. Draco had a hard time getting a word in when Scorpius got started, but when he was listing all of his birthday wishes Draco nudged him to get his attention. “I haven’t heard back from aunt Andromeda if she and Teddy will be attending your party, would you mind giving her a fire-call while I prepare breakfast?”
“Yes, for the interrogation.” Draco must’ve looked scared because Ron came towards him again. “Don’t worry, mate,” he said in a lower voice. “I know you have nothing to do with all of this, it’s just protocols. The Ministry is very grateful for your cooperation.”
Draco let out a big sigh. This wasn’t good. There hadn’t been fairies in their garden since the war when Voldemort had destroyed their home with a fire and afterwards let Nagini eat everything that had survived. Draco shivered at the memory. He was certain that there were never going to be fairies living on their grounds ever again. Apparently, there were some more things for him to discuss with his parents in the morning, and a call to St Mungo’s to be made. He placed Scorpius' head on his chest and closed his eyes, and let his son’s slow breaths lull him into sleep.
Draco shook his head. This night wasn’t for reminiscing about his fragile friendship with Potter. He downed the rest of his drink, and let his eyes search the room again. This was getting boring, so when he locked eyes with Michael Corner, he raised his eyebrows in a silent invitation and nodded towards the exit. Michael smirked at him, and gave a discreet nod back. Draco put his glass down, and gave Potter a last glance. He had started to sweat now, tiny pearls on his forehead that got reflected in the lights from the ceiling. Just before Draco left the room, he saw Granger politely steering Potter away from the crowd.
“Tell me what happened?” Harry asked softly.
Draco could feel himself blushing, remembering the last time Harry asked the same question.
“Bloody hell,” Harry mumbled. “Don’t go anywhere, I’ll get you a potion.”
Draco swallowed down the hurt, tightening his throat.
Harry’s smile was warm. “Good. And I know that it sucks right now, but it’s okay to be happy about other parts of your life even though someone you care about is ill. And you deserve to be happy. I’ll really try to make you happy.”
“No. No, you never mentioned it.” Draco felt a little stupid that he didn’t know that Ron was a father.
Draco could not help himself. He started crying, leaning into Harry's warm touch.
Therefore, he did the only thing he could think of and got permission to leave, which is how Draco Malfoy found himself driving away from the sunrise on the morning nine days before his eighteenth birthday.
His father had taught him all their was to know about becoming an alpha, the rest him and his mate would just have to learn along the way, they would just have to let love conquer all.
Lucius slammed the doors, leaving Ernie with his hackles raised on the front step, and turned in the direction of his son's quarters.
Draco looked confused, not that the pile of blankets could see, so he voiced it, "It wasn't you... I was... cold.
Draco looked up, but his eyes that wanted to feast on his mate only found Harry Potter?!
Potter seemed to realise he had made the adorable noise out loud and blushed bright red, making Draco feel even worse that he was barging into this private moment.
Admittedly, everyone knew he would say no, but he was still scared that people would think he was a wimp. Thinking to himself, it was probably true, he wasn't athletic and all he ever did was read, so he fitted rather well into the nerdy wimp category.
His smile
Harry, as unwounded as he was, was at a loss. He had suffered from panic attacks as a child due to his anxiety, but the pack's response had been to hug him until he calmed down, which he didn't think was appropriate given the circumstances.
Lucius's bloodshot eyes scanned the millions of papers on his desk, searching for something, anything, that he had missed on his first look, or his thirtieth.
Potter swung the door to the on suite bathroom Draco had not realised existed open, unaware that his room was no longer empty.
Draco did not make it to the bathroom before panic swept over him. He fell to his knees in the middle of his mate's room, feeling like an outcast.
He knew he was gay, and he could feel a new self-loathing crawling over his body. He'd come out to the pack a couple years ago and they were all fine with it and he accepted himself, thanks to careful collaboration from Ron, Hermione and the rest of the pack.
The maids brought Draco food, most probably on his mother's instruction, but he couldn't seem to keep anything down.
His son might be gay and he might not have known.
Harry booked a hotel room, hoping that his mate would find him there and wouldn't be offended that he had stopped to sleep, but he had been driving for four days straight and even werewolves needed to recover after that.
Harry was watching, although he would refuse to admit he was to anyone who saw him. He just happened to be there.
Once he'd hit the highway, he'd floored the pedal and let tears blur his vision.
But... Why couldn't it be a positive? Why couldn't he think of his own mate as gorgeous? Why couldn't he notice how Draco's bubble butt flexed as he walked? The defined muscles covering his body, showing how fit he was. How much endurance he would have when they could finally be together, when Harry could finally feel how big Draco-
She knew where to start, getting her husband to accept her son. Something she was still dealing with herself, but had had more time since she had figured it out long long ago. At the end of the day, she was still a mother, and while not always the best, she knew her son better than anyone else. The signs were easy to spot.
Harry had seen the disgust in Malfoy's eyes. He knew Malfoy didn't - would never - want him. He was just a puny boy that didn't know how to be an Alpha, no match for the soon to be Alpha of the prestigious Blue Lake Pack.
He was already airborne.
His screams were what finally made the rest of the pack race upstairs, finding a two lifeless bodies and a screaming green-eyed baby.
His hair
And yet, he couldn't help but move further into the room, he could hear his blood rushing around his head, his heartbeat echoing in his ears.
Once he was sure Harry wasn't going to suddenly have another spurt of confidence and  pull him back to bed, he rose reluctantly.
Never in all his life had he thought Draco would do something - anything - as stupid and reckless as jumping out a window.
So Harry decided to take a chance, "How long did you know? About your sexuality?" he asked, softly, not wanting to ruin the moment.
They had asked me where I wanted to be moved. Told me Potter - Harry - did not mind if I shared his room, and presumably his bed. If I did not want to, the said they could move someone else in with their sibling and I could have a room for myself.
This did not change the fact that being a homosexual was wrong and the second Draco got home Lucius would beat it out of him, physically if he had to.
Harry gulped, "I- I'm not sure he'll want to Alpha, I think he should be able to decide," Harry paused, thinking about the decision he had just made, "but, I definitely wouldn't complain." He finished, smugly. Draco could now make his choice while knowing what Harry would like, but should he still go back and apologise?
He stepped back into his mansion, looking for any trace that his son had some how pulled the wool over his eyes and run through the door, but he could not find anything. Not even a trace that his son had lived there at all.
He heard a snort, from that same mousy blonde, and felt Harry's hand on his arm. Draco turned, to see a concerned face staring up at him.
There. Standing, just come through the door, about to approach reception was Draco Malfoy?!
It was a peaceful afternoon, butterflies flitting, a gentle breeze making the flowers bob... Harry just hoped that once he turned eighteen everything would stay the same. Even though everyone knew he would decline Alpha Status, they all still dreamed that on his birthday he would suddenly become the fierce beast that destroyed their old enemy seventeen years ago.
Tugging him to pack a bag and start driving, but unbeknown to him, his mate had also felt the pull.
Malfoy laughed at his own thoughts. He knew he was gay, which was the main reason he had faked feeling a pull in his heart. He had to get out of the house. He had read all the books, he knew that there was a chance of him getting a man as a mate, he also knew that if he did, his father would probably kill him.
Slowly he shifted his weight and made to remove his arm from Draco's torso. He did not get very far as a hand came up and clutched his hand with too much strength to be asleep.
The Luna cleared her throat softly, "I think we are a little bit more open with each other than your previous pack was."
Draco presumed this since Potter was in a towel. Potter - Harry - was toned. He must train with his people, Draco mused, his eyes trailing down Harry's glistening body. He had a six pack and impressive shoulders, but Draco was still taller than him and had also been training to be Alpha, unlike Harry.
He took a step back as Potter took a step forwards, freezing as Draco moved again, away from him.
With a sigh, Draco realised that he was going to have to do something if he wanted to fix the ache in his bones. Without thinking, he got up and walked over to the bed.
Draco felt bad, really bad. He wanted to ask his mother, make sure she would accept him, but he knew his mother. He knew how unforgiving she was. He knew his father, he knew how as a pair they ruled with fear, not love.
The old furniture obviously second hand even though he could probably, definitely, afford anything he wanted.
He saw the final fleeting look of fear on his father's face, heard the cry of surprise, felt the fingertips reach out, just too late.
Draco tried to sit up, which had Harry appearing in a flurry, trying to help him, only to be pushed back roughly. Draco's hands then moved to rip out the IV tube. The tube that was keeping him tied to this dreadful world.
"It is going to be okay," Harry whispered, "I'm here now, I won't leave."
Harry skulked down to the hospital wing, giving up on acting inconspicuous and just wanting answers. He didn't per say march into the hospital, but there was definite enthusiasm in the way he held himself. His intent was to find out why they had dragged his unwilling mate into his safe space.
Something snapped inside Draco as he turned and looked back at his parents, "Maybe it's a good thing I don't find her - I mean look how it turned out for you!"
Potter recoiled, turned, and sprinted back up the stairs.
He figured that his mate must be an alpha of some extent since he could sense the power, on top of the self-loathing he was desperately trying to ignore. The sense of power, however, also brought a sense of direction, his heart tugging this way and that.
Fortunately, his thoughts did not linger in distaste as he was pulled into a conversation with one of the cubs sitting on the other side of his beloved.
"Fine, if that's your wish," he responded, before attacking, their wolf forms clashing as they collided, but Lily was still tired from her mothering duties, meaning Tom had the upper hand, but before she was turned completely into bloody ribbons, her voice was heard, echoing around the room in an almost ethereal manner,
"Yes, sorry, what did you want?" Harry asked softly, gazing up at the Alpha that had gifted Harry with his mate.
Draco was just as surprised as the pile of blankets, which momentarily stopped its quivering, at the words that had come out of his mouth, but the sobbing had stopped and the blankets would probably block out the moonlight so he stood by them.
I could not allow that, how could I? I had been a terrible person, insulting Harry at every turn.
Lucius's face filled with fury as he ordered Draco to his room. Draco could tell it was only his mothers tight grip on Lucius's arm that stopped his father from telling him to get out of his house.
He turned his head away, exposing his neck. His neck that would someday bear Draco's mark.
Harry sighed, but respected his mate's wishes, leaning over for one last remark: "I do want you."
Avoiding pronouns when talking about his crushes, staring dreamily at the football team instead of playing the game, avoiding girls like the plague.
No trace he had landed and run, no trace he had ever been outside.
His will to live was low. Seven days without food had left him weak and desolate. He had opened the window by the time he saw the black Mercedes come screeching down the drive way.
"I couldn't find hi- her anywhere," Draco replied, trying to shove past his parents.
It was only once that Draco caught a look of... disgust directed his way, the mousy blonde chick unable or unwilling to look away fast enough to be missed. Draco sneered, taking note to remember her and ask Harry about her later.
He reached a hotel by mid-afternoon and stopped in the parking lot. He could smell him, there was no doubt it was a man. A strong man with an aroma of musty BO that he pulled off so sexily, Draco couldn't wait to lay his eyes on the rest of his life.
Just then, Harry looked up, glancing over at Draco and catching his eye. Nothing needed to be said. They were at peace with each other and themselves.
How had he not realised beforehand how often he made eye contact with Draco, even before they were mates.
Not that any one would say that to the Alpha's face. No, he was left piecing rumours together when he crept downstairs to see whether their was any news, not wanting the hassle of his pack members trying to force him to eat.
To Harry's dismay, Draco had only come out once he promised to stay on the opposite side of the room. Then, when he appeared, unharmed but tear stained, he told Harry that the only reason he had agreed to share his room was because he did not want to put the pack that had already done so much for him out any more than necessary. He also explained coldly and without looking up that this did not change the fact that he was not planning on mating with Harry.
There was silent for a moment. Draco's expression was unreadable.
I finally had my someone. The someone I had been dreaming of so long ago, until I realised that I would never be allowed to have him. Then I just gave up.
It had taken him the better part of a day to make it back home, and by that point he'd worked himself into too much of a state to tell anyone what had happened.
Draco turned to Harry, his normally pale skin slightly flushed, "I suppose we should go eat something."
He could feel distress, something was wrong. So he prepared, trying to reach out, figure out whether or not his mate was out there.
Wait a minute. Those weren't his thoughts. He had come out. He was accepted. Ernie would not question the Goddess. Wh- Draco.
He looked around, expecting to see blood and gore that should of been inside his weak son, but there was nothing.
It had been a week since the incident at the motel and he wasn't handling it well. Even if he hadn't found his soulmate he wasn't planning to return to his emotionally abusing parents, and yet after being rejected he didn't have the energy to shout at his parents or run away.
His eyes were the most prominent things about him. Not the droop in his shoulders, not the way his fingernails were digging into the palms of his hands, not the way his shirt crumpled after being worn for six days, the way his eyes rested in his hollow face.
"I still don't understand why he's not coming with," sighed Ernie's reluctant beta.
He was a rogue.
He had hidden it, he'd had to, but now, now the world was his oyster.
Not that the other option would be any better.
Harry Potter was sitting in the shade of a huge oak tree near the Silver Woods Pack house. He was reading a book while his two friends, Ron and Hermione, were trying to merge their beings via their tongues, a supposedly 'normal' activity to partake in with one's mate. They were eighteen, well at least, Ron and Hermione were. Harry was turning eighteen in ten days time, he was eager to meet his mate and discover what the big fuss was all about, but at the same time shy Harry was nervous about turning eighteen because then he would have the option of taking over as the Alpha.
Draco could feel his heart jump into his throat at the thought of disappointing his mate, but he had to. Maybe it would make this easier for both of them.
It was at that moment that Draco realised Potter was not in his room. Draco had been told Potter would be waiting for him, and yet he was alone.
It was definitely much more comfortable in the bed than on the couch, but just as Draco was getting comfortable, he heard a whispered pout from the other side of the bed, "This doesn't mean I forgive you."
Potter was still scared of him, hated him, and rightly so. He did not want to hurt the poor boy.
But on the other, he could not help but notice the easy familiarity that the whole pack hummed with. The lunch table was filled with laughter and smiles. Draco noticed a couple startled eyebrows at the sight of a platinum blonde head at their informal spread.
It took two more days for Ernie to get Harry back out of his bed and into the sun, and a day and a half after that to convince him that the Silver Wood Pack needed to storm the Blue Lake Pack and rescue Malfoy.
Ernie believed Lucius Malfoy to be a reasonable man, on the basis that he believed most people were reasonable people and Alpha Malfoy hadn't given him a reason to doubt that.
Draco relaxed back into the sterile hospital bed. More than relaxed, he tried to sink into the hard pillows, trying to create distance between Harry and his lips. Those lips edging slowly towards his face.
No one actually knew what happened, all they knew was that across the wolven lands, Harry Potter's name was hailed as the wolf who slayed the devil, the Blood Moon Pack's Alpha.
There were some things Ernie was unsure about, which made convincing Harry even harder.
Her happy daydreams were interrupted suddenly, when there was a loud crash. She was immediately fully alert, completely aware of who the other wolf was, standing next to the broken window which he had just jumped through. He straightened gracefully, his hands brushing some invisible speck of dust off his legs.
Draco was watching Potter. He was laughing at a joke another werewolf had made. Draco felt a growl rise in his throat.
He had heard the shouts, it would have been hard not to, and was worried for the boy's health as he turned back to the front door he had just been so rudely chucked from, just in time to see a shadow fast approaching.
I was scared. He had tried to kiss me. I had pushed him away. Any progress we had made I had probably undone, just in that simple flinch.
Although he made a big show of focusing on eating his bread roll, which had been lovingly buttered by his mate, Draco was very focused on the way Harry was hunched over his knees, and the way he seemed so content to just sit and watch a bumble bee float from flower to flower.
Harry squeaked, unsure what to do in the new situation. Unlike before, Draco did not flinch away from the sound. If anything, he seemed to relax into it.
His jealousy took over him as he turned away from the sight, his eyes finding his parents in the crowd.
Unbeknown to Draco, who thought he was just driving as far away from the stifling place he had to call home, that he Goddess was actually nudging him closer and closer towards his soon to be mate.
And he was Draco Malfoy. The most arrogant, argumentative, gorgeous, bubble bu- wait a minute.
After Luna Lily was murdered, it completely tore James apart, as it was, he was a young Alpha and losing his mate just sent him in a downward spiral.
There was a faint beeping coming from somewhere in the room, confirming that he was alive.
He found his mate sitting in the garden that the Luna tended to religiously looking like some kind of fae. Draco seemed lost in thought and slightly mesmerised by the millions of colourful flowers spread out in the garden, and Harry felt slightly mesmerised by the sight of his mate seated on the grass verge looking like he had been there for years, exactly where he should always be. At one with nature.
Draco has never left any personal items lying around, he had stuck to his room, and even then any show of creativity and self expression had been stunted and half-hearted.
For now, they were content to just stay in each others' arms, in the bed, and ignore the hustle and bustle of normal pack life that had already begun. The thrum of activity from the pack house comforting them and sending them further into the ether.
He hadn't left his room since he'd arrived home, scared of inducing the wrath of his father. The conversation he had had with him as he walked through the door had been enough for Draco to know to stay clear, even if he had been in a good head space.
Ernie Macmillan stepped up as Alpha and Hannah Abbott as Luna. The pack does well with them leading and everyone is at peace, but this doesn't stop Harry from worrying about the strange circumstances in which he was left.
He prepared, quietly and with mental gusto.
Except he didn't.
Harry wasn't sure, but he felt an extra... thump in his heart on the ninth morning before his birthday.
His smirk
It had taken him a while to come to terms with it, but he had decided who he wanted to be, and it was not in line of what his parents wanted.
"Luna Lily," Tom mocked, taking a step forward as if he had every right to be there.
The way the sunlight illuminated the dust particles floating through the air came through tall windows.
Draco swore under his breath, "Stupid werewolf hearing."
These werewolves had saved me from certain death, and now were offering to put out their pack members, for me. I obviously could not allow that, even if it meant I had to share a room with Harry.
Slowly, uncertain, a hole opened up and the lanky blonde shimmied himself into the bed.
Something was niggling at the back of Lucius' brain. What Ernie had said. As much as Lucius hated being wrong, or in the dark, he was starting to see where Ernie was coming from.
He'd seen Draco's look of disgust when their eyes had met. Draco had rejected him.
Draco did not have any good qualities. The way his platinum blonde hair caught in the sun did not count as a positive.
Tom laughed as her blood spewed around him, her lifeless body falling to the ground. Moving towards the cradle, there was a gleam of greed in his eyes. As his fingers made contact with the wailing boy's face, the was a flash of green light, the same forest green as the boy's wide, worried eyes, and the hand fell away in agony that spread through the hand and into the body.
After being rejected, Harry had kept it together long enough to check out and get on the road.
They had had that discussion from opposite sides of the room, after Potter had attempted to squeeze the life out of him, Draco had managed to extract himself from the situation and lock himself in the bathroom.
Harry panicked and shoved him back, causing Draco to wince, but give up on unplugging himself.
He gasped, shocked by what he found.
No, Draco could not think like that, could not allow himself to think like that. Harry - Potter - did not want him. He had to respect that.
Draco was confused. Why was he feeling sorry for Harry?  He had never felt sad that his parents never showed him affection, so why all of a sudden did he want to find the monster who had torn Harry's parents from his cot-side?
His bellow could be heard throughout the mansion, "DRACO MALFOY YOU WILL GET YOUR ASS DOWN HERE BEFORE I CAN CALL AGAIN!"
Draco should his head, sharply. He could not allow for his heart to be broken once again. He refused to believe Harry's intents were anything but nefarious considering how fast he had spun when he had seen who his mate was.
DRACO MALFOY WAS IN HIS BED.
That thought sent a shock wave of hurt through Draco's body. He would have to face his mate, the one slowly advancing on him. His heart lifted slightly, Harry was there. Draco couldn't understand why Harry was there, but maybe there was hope for them.
Draco awoke to moonlight on his face. He had always slept with blackout curtains since he was unable to sleep if there was the slightest distraction. The moon had not been up when he had managed to fall asleep, but he knew from experience that now that he was awake, he would not be able to fall asleep again. He glanced over at Harry, expecting him to be fast asleep.
He should never have agreed to sharing a room with him.
All his thoughts of running away we're crushed, one glance of Potter's feet turning and running was enough to tell him he wouldn't be able to live through a second rejection, from anyone.
Draco seemed to wake up at the sound of Harry's gasp, suddenly aware that he was in bed with his mate.
Draco day up groggily as he heard a door slam downstairs. His room was on the top floor, as far away from his parents as humanly possible.
"I would rather die then let you have him," she growled again, her words dripping with venom, her green eyes piercing his mocking gaze causing him to lose his cool.
Harry awake to the gentle sun rays caressing his face, as he usually did. What was not normal was the body his arm was lazily slung across. He watched for a moment, observing his arm rise and fall with his bed mate's breath.
"He didn't mean any harm by it," Harry tried to placate, only leading to Draco further wrinkling his nose, "He asked into private matters not even the Alpha has any right knowing!"
Draco has not heard his father that angry since the summer of '06 when he thought Narcissa was sleeping with his Beta. He could only presume it had something to do with the Alpha he had seen getting out of the black Mercedes. The Alpha of Harry Potter's, his mate's, pack.
"I just wanted to tell you that lunch is about to be served if you two would like to eat," She managed to get out between giggles, glancing at the two boys, standing one on each side of the bed.
"It was nice to feel something again," he thought, absentmindedly as he drifted out of consciousness, only remembering when it was too late that if you hit your head you are not supposed to fall asleep. It did not bother him as much as it should have.
How had his mate lived in these cramped quarters for so long? With most of the pack? The pack house that Draco was used to had many empty rooms, with only one or two drawing rooms ever used. There were wide spacious corridors leading out onto balconies and ballrooms, but here there was hustle and bustle with pack mates sharing bathrooms and beds.
Luckily, Ernie was a werewolf with werewolf reactions, and he managed to extend his arms enough to catch the Malfoy heir as he fell from his window.
I hated him. He had everything I ever wanted, a family who supported, loved, him.
The peaceful afternoon with his friends was something Harry needed, school was starting in a couple of days and Harry was excited to be almost graduating high school! He had no idea what he wanted to do with his life, but he felt like he would've achieved something by passing matric.
Another man.
Draco curled the blanket around himself on the couch. He had managed to convinced Potter that he should sleep on the couch, and that his pack had already been great hosting him on such short notice.
Harry looked up at Draco, annoyed, "What are you doing?!"
"Well those matters are still personal to me, and I will not disclose them," Draco spoke abruptly after a beat, sticking his nose up and storming off, so that they could not see the tears in his eyes.
"Son, we didn't expect you to find her so fast, is she just in the car?" Lucius opened, not even greeting him.
When I walked down the corridor, people smiled at me, reassuringly, instead of averting their gaze as if I was to be feared.
Harry just nodded, blushing furiously and refusing to look up. At this sight, Draco started chuckling. He made his way around the bed, arms extended. Harry willingly disappeared into the hug.
Lucius almost followed his son out the window.
At this point the whole table was deathly quiet. The younger ones in confusion as it was the only way they knew and the older ones in sorrow, knowing full well the pack that Draco had just come from.
She made him read a sign as he drove past. He made one up.
The door opened to show Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy standing arm in arm and smiling for the first time since their honeymoon.
All they knew was that she was alive, otherwise they would have felt their bond to their Luna break.
The second time that the pair woke up, they were awoken to harsh knocking on the door. Luna Abbott did not hesitate to yank the door open, glimpsing Draco and Harry scrambling away from each other with enhanced speed, probably even faster than average werewolf enhancement.
"The poor lad's heartbroken," Ernie chuckled in return.
Mostly, it was the way the bed was messily made, done by him even though he would have maids to do it.
"My mate... is Draco Malfoy." Harry whispered to himself, making it true. Allowing himself to hear the words, understand their meaning. He had found his mate.
All the alterations at the meetings, they all could have been avoided if Draco wasn't such an asshole, but that was the only way Draco knew how to impress people, with his rich taste and important linage.
They held no emotion. No fear, no determination, no fight, no hope. He had already given up, any hope he had that Harry would come and rescue him had gone, he knew it had been foolish. He had thought that maybe... the black Mercedes would have held someone besides from the Alpha of the Silver Woods Pack... maybe a boy with messy brown hair.
"Hey hey it's going to be okay!" Hermione soothed, having no affect on the now weeping Harry. Very soon he was bawling his eyes out and had to be guided back to his room.
He was supposed to be becoming Alpha, and yet the boy had so much malnutrition, he was struggling to open a window.
It was not her being cruel, as she was sure her son would accuse her of, but simply her dealing with it in her own way. Her own son had called her way of life pointless and subpar. The whole mating ritual was the sole purpose of her life, the whole reason she had been born and groomed.
"They think they rejected each other, I'm sure they'll come around eventually." was Ernie's gruff reply, sending Harry's mind tumbling.
I cried myself to sleep that night.
They also had not felt their bond to their future Alpha break, but their current Alpha was insisting he was dead, if not in pulse in mind.
There were tears in Harry's eyes as he drove homeward.
Harry sat in his bed, frozen with the realisation that his mate was in the foyer of this very building. Waiting for him.
"I mean, I really was not expecting you to be gay. You were always so mean to me, but I suppose that was also coming from your parents and just how you were rai-," Harry's ramblings were interrupted by Draco as he started sobbing every louder, struggling to catch his breath.
And so the pair fell back into a slumber, ignoring the early morning sun streaming through the window and their responsibilities for the day.
Malfoy could also feel his mate, he could feel support and love radiating off of him in a warm pulse of acceptance and happiness.
He kept telling himself that he was just there to make sure Draco was alive, and he wouldn't force himself onto Draco.
He didn't know how to prepare, or what to prepare, but he prepared. He didn't tell anyone, in case he was wrong, but he slowly started to prepare himself for his mate.
Draco could smell Harry. He could smell the intoxicating scent enveloping his body. He watched Harry advance. His body was throbbing. His heart sinking slowly, not wanting to know what Harry was doing in his room. His room... this wasn't his room. It was the hospital room he had been put into.They were treating him for malnutrition. He was going to live.
They were standing stiffly together and Draco could tell they were holding it together purely because they were in public, if they were at home their shouts would be heard throughout the mansion.
Yet she still was struggling to fight the prejudices that had been forced down her throat from a young age, and she doubted it would be any better for Lucius. She needed to be strong for him, for them.
Draco's wolf could not help itself and let out a low, steady growl,"Do not disrespect my mate like that. You have no right to pry into such private matters," He stated firmly, asserting himself with his gaze fixed on the teenager.
Her thoughts wondered to her Alpha, he would be home shortly after running a quick perimeter with his beta, Sirius. Sirius' mate, Remus, was sitting in the kitchen below, probably with his nose buried in some old, dusty book. The thought of Remus made Lily smile, he had always been there for her, the whole pack had, and now she could be there for them.
The pain, the misery,
He crumpled, falling to the floor, feeling pain shoot up his left arm. He had landed on it funny.
The desk under the window was also messy, someone had tried to make it look neat, but had obviously been in a rush to do something else.
"Tom Riddle," Lily stated, her voice steady, hiding her fear well as she stepped in front of the delicate cradle.
Instead, there was the quiet sound of sobbing coming out from under the pile of blankets. Draco felt like shit. He knew he had caused his precious mate to cry and had no idea how to fix it. He had hoped that Harry would just reject him after the speech he had made, but instead Draco had just succeeded in upsetting him.
As if reading his thoughts, or at least the waves of self hatred coming off Draco's shivering body, Harry continued to whisper into Draco's ear.
He stared out the window, ignoring Draco as he got ready for bed, or in his case, couch. After what felt like an eternity, Draco stopped moving around and Harry was able to let sleep claim him.
Draco reluctantly accepted the bread roll, mostly so that he would not have to answer any difficult questions should Harry work up the nerve to ask the questions he certainly had floating around his head. His worries went unnoticed since Harry was happy to just sit besides his mate and take in the feeling of security he associated with the safe haven his Luna had created. This feeling was only amplified by having his mate next to him.
I did not know how to respond, now I was the one averting my gaze, to scared to look up, not knowing how to smile back.
He froze and Harry's face, which had slowly been rising in anticipation, dropped, disappointed.
Draco tensed, but did not pull away from Harry.
Someone who actually cared for me.
He was there. Lying there. Barely breathing, but there.
Lucius chanted, racing down the stairs hoping against hope that his little baby boy would still be alive by the time he had made his was down the passage, down the staircase, across the grand foyer, out the magnificent front door and onto the gravelly driveway.
Potter had started sobbing, and so Draco had had to come out of the bathroom, unable to listen to the saddening sound any longer.
Ernie might expect people to be reasonable, but he didn't need to be told twice if they weren't, so without further ado, he turned around and promptly marched back to his car, carrying his adopted son's mate in his arms.
Sunrise on the eighth day found him waking up in his father's car. He hadn't wanted to book a hotel since his father would be able to track his credit card. He needed a plan to get away for good.
Potter had ruined his life, and yet he couldn't stop thinking about him.
There was just one small step besides the actual birthday. He had to find his mate. Most wolves could start to sense their mates when they turned eighteen, but since Draco was the soon to be Alpha of one of the most powerful packs, now that the Blood Moon Pack was defeated, he could start to sense where his mate was a couple days in advance, ten days to be exact. He had woken up that morning and just knew his mate was in a direct South-Westerly direction from the pack house, the other thing he knew was that his mate wasn't close. At first he had just thought it had been because he wanted his mate right next to him, but throughout the day the feeling became more concrete, the sheer distance separating him and his mate was a long way.
Draco turned slowly, half expecting Potter to jump out at him from some unseen hidey-hole. Instead, a turning doorknob caught his eye just to the right of the closet.
No luck, she had certainly wanted to get away from him.
When it became clear the two boys were not going to reply, choosing to rather stand there uncomfortably, she closed the door and they could hear her shouting for Ernie, wanting to tell him about what she had just witnessed.
As Draco imagined Harry flipping him over, positioning him over the sofa with his trousers and pants shoved down, he let his own finger press against his opening, and he came with a silent cry, splattering come over his pyjamas. He stared up at his ceiling, feeling wrongfooted and sticky with cooling semen on his stomach. He spelled himself dry with a cleaning charm, but it did nothing to wash away the guilt over masturbating over someone who didn’t want you or to the horrible realisation that he had feelings for Harry.
“That’s your drink, right?” Potter nodded to it. “I thought you might need one after your Mr Rebane encounter. We’ve all been there. He is a bit slow on the uptake.”
Potter huffed out a laugh. “Nothing a little Reparo couldn’t fix.”
”Wait!” shouted Draco, only seconds away from the Portkey activating. ”Where are we going to sleep?”
Draco took a deep breath and slowly exhaled while he knocked on the door to his father’s study. He knew that it would take a couple of seconds before he answered and would let him in. It didn’t matter if he was busy or not, “always keep them in anticipation”, Lucius would say. Draco couldn’t count how many times he heard that phrase, and only for that he always answered as soon as possible if someone wanted to talk to him.
“No, nothing is wrong,” he snapped at them when none of them had the courage to ask him straight out. “Just didn’t get enough sleep, that’s all.”
Draco stood up, surprised at how fast he’d got hard again, but it was impossible not to, with a willing Harry under him. He smeared his cock with the spit and come that was left and pushed in with one single thrust. He paused, savouring the feeling of Harry clenching around him again. Draco closed his eyes and let the sound and smell they made together, as Draco fucked Harry for a second time, fill all of his senses. After only a little while, Harry spilled all over Draco’s hand again. Draco opened his eyes and kept stroking him through it, and when he was done, he pulled out, ignoring Harry’s whimpering protests. He grabbed his own cock and pulled at it with hard, fast strokes. Harry turned his head and made eye contact with Draco, and that was the final push Draco needed and he came all over Harry’s back.
“That she is not,” Draco smiled.
“I really do feel this is a bad dream with you two idiots whispering about me in the middle of the night,” Malfoy said suddenly making both Harry and Hermione jump. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to bed. I would appreciate if you stopped having conversations about me behind my back.” He gave a pointed stare at both Harry and Hermione and then left the room.
“My what now?” Draco squealed. “Potter is no such thing. Who let him in here?”
Harry was left speechless, staring at Malfoy who was breathing hard and probably waiting for Harry to speak. “So, you, you don’t want me dead?”
”Please Draco, think about it?” Harry said while grabbing at Draco’s arm.
Draco was standing at the bar, nursing a vodka on the rocks. It tasted awful, but he thought it somehow made him look a little more sophisticated. Not that he needed that, mind! He looked down on himself, fiddling a little with the hem of his robe.
Harry looked at him with big eyes. “Of course I wanted you there! I was only mad at Ron for not warning me, which made me spend the night making a fool of myself trying to talk to you. You make me so nervous that I always put my foot in my mouth.” He squeezed Draco’s hand. “I thought you heard me and then when you started to talk about my feelings later on I just figured you weren’t interested.”
Harry leaned in and kissed him. “No, you don't. But you know I do, so thank you.”
”Egypt?” Harry suggested, taking up far too much space on Draco’s couch. Draco sat in his chair by the fire. There was simply no room for him beside Harry if he wasn’t going to end up on his lap.
“You’re hopeless, Potter. Do I have to teach you everything?”
“What–” Potter cleared his throat. “What were you doing in here?”
“Potter! Potter?” Harry was dragged from his fantasies to a bewildered looking Malfoy, “Merlin, I was kidding. No need to get your knickers in a twist.”
He tried to give her sleeping potions to help her sleep at night, but Narcissa had become more suspicious, not wanting to eat or drink anything that he or Scorpius offered, claiming that they tried to poison her. One time when she refused to have tea with Scorpius, Draco asked him to go to his room when he saw how sad he became over the refusal, and tried to sit his mother down to explain that all they wanted was to spend time with her.
Draco had tried taking several calming breaths before he entered St Mungo’s, but facing Moira in the reception made him lose his temper all over again.
“Yes, I did,” Harry said taking another step forward. When Draco didn’t move away, he lifted his hand and tucked a lock of his hair behind his ear. Draco leaned into the touch and put his hand over Harry’s, intertwining their fingers.
“Yes, if that’s alright with you? I think it would be wise for me to come along. I don’t know if my mother can explain what’s happening to her,” Draco said, feeling a little embarrassed.
“Turbulence? No! No!” Draco stood up, banged his head against the luggage compartment, swore and started to walk down the aisle.
Scorpius giggled under the covers.
They left a confused looking Potter behind them.
“Huh,” was all that Harry managed to get out. He opened and closed his mouth a couple of times.
“Why?” Harry put the cups down on the table in front of the couch.
”It’s been taken care off!” Blaise said with a shit eating grin.
“I know. I know that, it’s just hard to accept that I can’t do things on my own.”
They took their breakfast in silence. Draco kept watching Harry out of the corner of his eye, not quite grasping that this was real. After a little while he could see Harry starting to fidget, he opened and closed his mouth a couple of times, clearly wanting to say something. Draco wondered if he perhaps had overstayed his welcome so he nudged Harry with his foot. “What?” He smiled, but his nerves made his lips twitch in the corners.
Draco scooped Scorpius up from behind, making him giggle. “You, young man, should be in bed. It’s almost midnight,” he said sternly, directing the words to his mother rather than Scorpius.
Harry ran his fingers through Draco’s hair in a soothing motion and then placed a kiss at Draco’s temple. “Come on love, let’s go home.”
“Well, I’m a light sleeper, Potter! I do hear you stomp around most nights. Though I must say, you’re not always this chatty.”
“A shower? And then food,” Harry answered, and stepped away from Draco to pull up his pants and trousers. Then he picked up his t-shirt from the floor and put it on before he headed to the door.
“You can call me Harry,” Potter -
“Do I have to?” Harry said over the rim of his mug.
Harry shook his head but let Draco continue.
“Scorpius!” Draco said. “What have I told you about the way we hug someone?” He approached them and gave Andromeda a kiss on her cheek.
“Good. I mean okay, that’s alright.” Potter was fidgeting with his hands before he struck one out towards Draco. “I’ll see you in a couple of days then?” His hand hovering, waiting for a handshake.
“Rose?” Draco asked, confused.
“So what are you telling Dora tomorrow?” Harry smirked.
“Come in, I’ll get us some tea.”
As he approached, he saw Blaise talking to Potter, and they stood awfully close together. Draco could once again see the beads of sweat breaking out on Potter’s forehead. Potter was clutching his glass in his hand, holding it so tightly that his knuckles were whitening. Blaise was leaning into Potter and had a hand on his lower back, stroking it up and down. A really bad feeling spread through Draco. He felt like he tasted something terribly bitter, and that he was going to be sick. He refused to examine that feeling any closer, but something told him to break up this encounter immediately. Anyone with eyes could see that Potter was uncomfortable. He didn’t know why he cared or thought that he could solve this situation, but his body made the decision before his brain caught up. He squeezed himself between the two of them and nodded at Potter before he turned to Blaise.
When they both had said their goodbyes to Andromeda and Scorpius had given Potter another big hug, they were headed towards the gate. They were just about to leave when Potter caught up to them.
“I––” Draco started, but got lost for words. Potter didn’t look mad, just surprised. And uncomfortable, really uncomfortable judging by the way he looked everywhere else but at  Draco. Draco was being ridiculous. He had every right to be here, he was invited. “I came to give Granger my best wishes. Weas–” He could see Ron coming up behind Potter. “Ron invited me.”
“Oh Merlin, it hasn't worn off yet has it?” He heard footsteps approaching the bed, then someone tapped his shoulder. “Here, drink this. And don’t you dare throw up at me. Again, I must add.”
“Get what?” Harry was feeling a little bit woozy, Seamus’ face refused to stay still long enough for Harry to focus on it.
Harry took a deep breath, and placed one of his hands over Draco’s, taking a long sip of his drink before putting it down on the table with the other glass. He leaned closer to Draco, and the soft spoken words into his ear made goosebumps appear all over his body.
”Las what now?” Harry said, blinking at Draco.
“It did, for a while. Then she slept...” Malfoy said, stopping mid-sentence.
Draco stepped into the living room, only to be assaulted by the image of Potter sitting on the sofa with Teddy and Scorpius on each side, reading a book filled with special effects coming out of it. He was dressed in a very soft-looking sweater, a knitted one in a gorgeous shade of green with a golden H on the chest, clingy in all the right places. His hair was rumpled as always, and it almost fell into his eyes and he had a large smile on his face as tiny fireworks came out of the book. He looked up when Draco entered and his smile didn’t falter when they locked eyes with each other. Draco could feel some of his nerves slipping away, but he still knew he had to apologize for storming out of his office. Draco didn’t manage to answer his smile with one of his own, and he broke eye contact when he could feel the room becoming too hot. He cleared his throat and when Scorpius noticed him he jumped up and wrapped himself around Draco.
Draco snorted. “I didn’t do it for the Ministry.”
He needed another drink.
Potter was now standing at his desk. “You left yesterday.”
Draco cleared his throat. “I don’t want to go home right now.” Maybe his honesty could be blamed on the residue of the alcohol, but he had a feeling Harry wouldn’t judge him for it. “I haven’t been spending much time at home for a while now.”
Harry dreaded meeting Malfoy the next day. Before he went to breakfast, he told himself that he would wait to see if Malfoy would try to kill him, before he came up with any excuses. But when Harry entered the great hall, Malfoy’s head flew up with a scared expression on his face and locked eyes with Harry. Harry didn’t know what to do or say without being hexed to next Sunday so he did the only thing he could think of.
“Did you spend your night with Draco again then?” Hermione asked, making Ron splutter pumpkin juice over the whole table.
Ron looked at him with furrowed brows, but he didn’t answer him, just tapped his knuckles again and gave Draco a nod. He went to the door, but before he reached it he turned and walked up to Draco again.
Draco stared down at the hand. “What?” he asked, perplexed.
This time Malfoy cut him off. “Because I made you do it. Because I’m sick and tired of stopping you from doing stupid things at night, when all I want is to go to sleep, and if sleeping with you beside me makes you stay inside of the dorms and not trying to off yourself, I will fucking do it, Potter.”
“Oh, just Malfoy having a bad dream I think,” Harry whispered back, thanking his lucky star Malfoy was asleep so he could blame him and not tell Hermione of his sleepwalking tendencies.
“Yes, sometimes a bit too late.” Malfoy was looking at Harry’s fingers.
Harry dragged him down for a kiss. “Me neither.
“Potter,” Malfoy said, his voice sounding surprisingly awake for just being sound asleep.
“It’s Hermione's birthday today. If you’re free tonight you should swing by the Leaky and grab a pint with us.”
Draco headed towards the door, hearing Moira’s upset voice behind him complaining over having to move Potter’s patients. Potter caught up to him just when he was about to leave.
This time, Draco cut Harry off instead. “No, you can’t borrow my notes. I was going to say that you should get some rest and we’ll talk about what’s happening between us afterwards. The Prime Minister cancelled, and I told Robards that you needed a sick day.” He leaned over and kissed Harry on the cheek. “I need to go to work and save your sorry arse. Mrs Lindon’s kneazle is trapped in her basement, again.” He looked at Harry with a nervous frown on his face. “I’ll see you tonight?”
Draco felt scared, like his whole world had been turned upside down and he hadn’t been along for the ride. He cleared his throat, “I think you should go.”
Draco stood up, still clasping the book in a firm grip. He went for the door but stopped before he closed it behind him. He turned and locked eyes with his father. “I’m giving it a couple of weeks. If I don’t see that she gets better, I’m going to book an appointment with a healer.”
“I won’t be the one holding you to anything,” he said with a wink.
“Of course we will. I can’t believe you’re six now, you’re so grown up. I wish your mother could see you now.” He hugged Scorpius a little bit tighter against him.
They sat in silence for a while. When Draco had seen Harry stifle yet another yawn, he took that as a cue. ”I’m going to call it a night.” Draco stood up and started to walk out of the room.
“Okay, show me how you did then,” Draco said, hugging Harry from the back.
“Fine! I’ll go find her myself.” Draco pushed away from the counter and began walking down the corridors yelling for his mother. He could hear Moira calling after him but he ignored her. He was going to find his mother and he didn’t care if she sent the guards after him. What he hadn't accounted for was Harry running towards him, dragging him from the door he was banging on.
“What’s wrong with Potter?” someone who sounded like Malfoy asked.
“Okay. We’ll tell Andie in the morning. Let’s go get your mother’s stuff.”
Malfoy didn’t say anything more, but Harry heard footsteps behind him, and then a door that closed. And yes, while naming other things that was new this year, his stupid crush on Malfoy was also one of them.
Draco nodded, ”You don’t say?” He sipped his drink and tried to suppress all the confusing feelings over Potter knowing his order. Malfoys were above feeling confused.
Draco pushed in a bit harder this time, forcing a moan out of Harry. Harry put his head down on the desk and gritted out, “harder!” Draco grabbed Harry’s hips and started to fuck him in earnest, each thrust more forceful than the one before. He could see Harry’s knuckles whitening, trying to hold on to the table. Harry was meeting Draco with every push, and Draco had never seen anything hotter than Harry Potter leaning over his table, trying to fuck himself on Draco’s cock. He took one of his hands and put it around Harry’s cock, which was smearing pre come all over Draco’s desk drawers. He began stroking Harry in timing with his own thrusts, his knuckles banging against the drawers at every pull. Something primal stirred in him at the thought that Harry would come all over something that belonged to him.
“Just because you can’t man up and talk to him doesn’t mean I shouldn’t have invited him. He’s a good guy,” Ron said.
Harry stared intensely as he slowly moved forward. “You better hit the showers before I toss you down on the bed and lick that off you.”
“Ask you out!” Ron said exasperatedly. “Weren't you eavesdropping on the toilet?”
Harry dragged himself out of bed, threw on some pyjama bottoms and went into the common room. Harry was totally set on finding Malfoy’s sleeping form on the couch, so when he saw Malfoy sitting up staring right at him, he stopped dead in his tracks. Malfoy didn’t say anything, just looked at Harry with weary eyes.
“Dad! You must come and look at this awesome book Harry gave me.” He dragged Draco towards the sofa. “It has dragons and fireworks in it, and a hero that can talk to snakes.” He pushed Draco down to the empty space besides Potter that Scorpius had left behind.
At the word home Draco could feel dread coming over him. He was out of a job, he didn’t have anywhere to hide anymore, and the logical solution would be to go home, and face the truth that he had avoided for a long time.
Harry let out a huff. “How’re you feeling?”
“Oh, you certainly do. And I intend to collect. Tell me, Weasley, isn't it true that your wife is on a first name basis with the Prime Minister?
Potter looked up again. “Of course I’ll take care of your mother, Draco.”
Draco swallowed and looked down briefly at his hand on Harry’s leg, then he looked up again and met Harry’s eyes. “You,” Draco said, still feeling lost for words, but that much he knew. Feeling honest and somewhat brave he let his hand wander a couple of inches upwards on Harry’s thigh. “Just you.”
Draco had been standing outside the Leaky for five minutes just staring at the building. He could see people milling around inside, laughter filtering out through the door. There were approximately ten steps left and then he would be inside. The problem was that taking those final steps seemed insurmountable. He was clutching a wrapped present in his left hand, a code notebook he’d found in the store. He thought Granger would appreciate the intricate puzzle that had to be solved to get the book to open. In his other hand, he held a small bouquet of lilies he’d plucked from the garden. He felt stupid like he was going on a date, but he had no interest in Granger, or Ron for that matter, he just wanted to make a good impression. He brought the bouquet up to his nose and smelled the flowers, then he threw them away. Petals scattered across the alley by the whoosh of air that came from the door to the Leaky that was flown open, revealing Potter at the entrance. He looked startled, staring at Draco, eyes going over him and then on the ground, then back up again.
He kissed Harry and dragged one hand down his torso. When he reached the waistband he popped the button open in Harry’s jeans and spun him around. He slowly pulled the jeans down along with Harry’s pants, then put his hand between Harry’s shoulder blades and carefully pressed him down the table. Harry grabbed the end of his desk with both of his hand’s and murmured something Draco couldn’t hear. But when he looked down on the sight in front of him, and grabbed both of Harry’s arse cheeks to part them a little, he could see Harry’s hole glistening, and the faint smell of a cleaning charm lingered in the air.
Ever since they became friends, or forced to become friends after Blaise and Neville got together, Draco did his best not to have too much alone time with Harry. But Harry had nestled his way into Draco’s life and was now such a permanent fixture, that he felt he couldn’t destroy it with such inconvenient things liked feelings.
“She came yesterday, I didn’t tell you because I thought it was what you wanted. I’m sorry, Draco. If I knew that your father had made the decision I would have contacted you, but they didn’t tell me who got her here, just that she’d been admitted.” Harry stroked his thumb over Draco’s knuckles, the light touch creating goosebumps that traveled along Draco’s arm. “She’s at Janus Thickey at the moment for an evaluation. If you want her home we’ll get her home. Let her spend a night to get some proper sleep, and I’ll arrange for her to be back at the Manor in the morning.”
“It’s a silly thing to keep on doing, don’t you think?” his father answered nonchalantly. “I for one don’t care about the state of the weather in March 1996, for example. I’m glad that she finally decided to put an end to noting down tedious memories.”
“You haven’t clung this much to me since eighth year, and that was only because you wanted my dick up your arse.” Blaise started to nibble on Draco’s ear.
Harry let out a laugh. “I didn’t force you, you came quite willingly as a matter of fact. You’re free to go home if you like.”
“What about him?” Draco raised his eyebrows.
Draco didn’t know what to say. Somehow Potter thought they were involved. And though Draco knew that this was probably something he wanted, he couldn’t help but feel it was wrong. Like a decision had been made without him having a say in it, and he couldn’t deal with feeling like that ever again. Draco shook his head. “I need to figure this out, Potter! This isn’t right. I don’t remember this.” Draco waved his hand between them, indicating what he meant.
“It’s been a while,” Draco huffed out on the pillow, moaning when another finger slipped in alongside the first one.
Draco withdrew his fingers and spelled his trousers open, easing them down along with his pants so that only his cock was showing. He conjured some lube and coated himself, then pressed the tip to Harry’s hole without pushing in, just to get Harry begging again. Harry rewarded him by swearing and pushing back his whole body, so that Draco’s cock slowly inched in.
Potter smiled again. “Well, I did. It seems like we’re always interrupted when we finally get a chance to talk to each other. If it isn’t Kingsley, or your dates, then it’s always someone who drags me away from you. So, as I said, I came here, waiting for you.”
“We can treat some of her symptoms, making her hallucinations a bit more bearable for example. Or make her mood a little lighter,” he turned towards Narcissa, “if that’s something you want?”
“The condition? I’m sorry, could you repeat it again?” Draco felt a flush creeping up his cheeks as it was obvious that he hadn’t been listening to what Potter was saying.
After visiting Andromeda on his birthday, her comment about his mother had left a sour aftertaste in his mouth. Andromeda had called her distracted, and as much as Draco had had that feeling himself, he hadn’t thought that anyone else had noticed. Draco tried to keep a closer eye on his mother after his visit to Andromeda, to see if things had become worse from what he thought they were before. There weren't any big changes in her behaviour, nothing exactly out of the ordinary. She was a bit quieter, but she had been that way since the war, they all were, except for his father, of course. He kept talking about the big plans that never happened, and about great ideas that now were lost. This was one of the reasons why he didn’t understand why his father was sentenced to house arrest instead of going to Azkaban. But, at least he couldn’t do much damage inside of their house, and even Lucius knew not to talk about his beliefs with Scorpius present.
“I’m meeting Ron for a pint tonight. He was wondering if you would like to join us?” Potter said more to the ground than to Draco.
He couldn’t find her on their floor, and he grew more anxious when he couldn’t find her down in the parlour either. He went to his parent’s bedroom, gently knocking before he entered. Lucius stood at one of the windows, looking out into the garden. He cast a glance at Draco when he came up beside him, but looked back down again. Draco could see his mother walking around outside, and even though the nights were fairly warm in the beginning of summer, she wasn’t wearing enough clothes, and she was heading towards the pond.
And just like that, his crush on Malfoy, ten folded.
Scorpius pulled at Draco’s shirt to get his attention. “Dad, is it okay if I hug Harry?”
Draco had to bite his tongue not to answer that question with a loud no. Instead, he just shrugged. “I’m going to bed. Will you really be alright on the sofa?” he asked Harry.
“I don’t read the
“My plans? My plan is to take care of my mother and Scorpius.”
Draco looked down at the mess he’d left on Harry and a tingling sense of possession ran through him as he saw Harry marked with his come. He couldn’t help but trace his fingers through it. Harry laughed while he took Draco’s hand and placed it against his own lips instead, then he slowly licked the come off.
Harry closed his eyes again, thinking he could enjoy the silence, when he felt a head land upon his shoulder and heard a light snore going straight into his ear. He smiled and opened his eyes, knowing very well that Draco would rather be caught dead than snoring. A few strands of hair had fallen over Draco’s face, and Harry carefully tucked them behind his ear. His chest hurt a little from all the suppressed feelings he was harbouring for Draco in there, but they had a solid work relationship going and he really didn’t want to push Draco away by being too forward. But it wouldn’t hurt to just look at him a little while he was asleep.
Draco covered his face with his hands. “I didn’t hear that part.” He groaned through his fingers. “Fuck, I’ve been such an arse to him.”
“Is that so? Well, it took him long enough didn’t it?”
“Potter, why do you think you’re sleeping in my bed?” he asked Harry in a calm voice. That was a good question, because his subconscious was best friend with his heart slash cock perhaps, and had no respect about boundaries?
” He folded it in half, and he put the letter in his pocket as he rose from the bed, heading towards the door to help his mother back to her room.
Draco felt a vicious feeling he didn’t want to examine too closely spreading in his chest. “Visit your ex in Romania? Oh! How joyful, do you want some privacy to talk and reminiscing old time as well? Remind me again why I’m coming with you?” Draco spit out, going for indifference, but didn’t quite manage judging from Harry’s curious look.
“The sales woman said they should be a little tight. She said they looked good.”
Potter startled at Draco’s voice, and turned to him with a strained look on his face. “What? Oh, no! I’m not… It’s not for me this time. I mean, the water is for me, not the, not the other stuff,” he mumbled.
Yes, unfortunately, Harry
Lucius looked at him, then he shook his head, clasping his hands at the table in front of him. “Not for a couple of days, why?”
“Harry, what are you doing up? Why aren’t you wearing any clothes?” Hermione whispered to him, glancing at Malfoys sleeping body.
Draco didn’t say anything, just waved his hand and wordlessly cast a cooling charm over Potter, who shuddered in response.
“That’s so hot!” Potter breathed out. “You, doing wandless magic. I almost came in my pants when you cast that cooling charm over me on Pansy’s birthday.” He pushed the shirt off Draco’s shoulders and started to place soft kisses on his collarbones. “You’re so fucking beautiful,” Potter murmured between kisses.
“Then she what?” Harry said, curious about what Malfoy was about to say.
“I thought so too,” Draco admitted, clearly too drunk to keep his words inside. “I never thought he could forgive me, but perhaps acknowledge that I have changed, you know? I’m just trying to give him space so I don’t bother him.” He did a dismissive gesture with his hand. “It’s foolish. I’m foolish.” He shook his head, making the room spin around him. “Hm, I clearly had too much to drink. Don’t mind my rambling Weasley.”
Harry was a wreck the next day. After an embarrassing quick wank, he’d managed to get a couple of hours of sleep, dreaming of slender hands and ropes being tied too tight. At least he was alive, he told himself, looking at the image of himself in the mirror next morning. He wasn’t a pretty sight, but then again, he never thought he was. He met up with Hermione and Ron in the great hall for breakfast, both looking at him with worried eyes, then at each other, having what they thought was a discreet conversation with raised eyebrows and nodding of their heads towards Harry.
Draco pulled out his fingers and started to fuck Harry with his tongue instead, tasting his own come. Harry started to stroke himself, but the angle seemed all wrong for him, so Draco batted his hand away and did it for him. He couldn’t help his own moans spilling out of him as he tried to make it as good for Harry as possible. He pushed one finger in again, searching for Harry’s prostate, and when he found it, he started to put more pressure to it, making Harry shake.
One time when Andromeda was hosting a garden party, Potter had complained to him after one beer too many that he was jealous that Andromeda was Draco’s aunt, that he would’ve loved to be a real part of her family. Draco had called him daft and told him that he already was.
“Not by blood she isn’t,” Potter muttered.
A ghost of a sad smile graced Potter's face and he opened his mouth to say something, but he closed it again and looked down.
“Huh. I’m in love with Draco Malfoy.”
“Not a word!” Draco hissed.
Ron looked at him funny. “Did we listen to the same conversation? He just wanted a heads up so he could prepare to–” Ron waved his hands around, “you know.”
“Yes, that would be good, thank you. I don’t want to leave him alone with mother for too long, not when I don’t know what this is.” Draco raked his hand through his hair. “Maybe I can get one of the elves to look after him?”
Harry didn’t say anything, just continued looking at Draco like he was trying to figure something out. Draco didn’t offer any more explanation and they drank their coffee in silence. When Draco finished he put the cup down again, offering Harry a smile.
The next night he was heading towards the fireplace, only waking up when he burnt his fingertips. The night after that he was standing at the great lake with some sort of barrier stopping him from fondling the giant squid. The third night he was in the middle of the Forbidden Forest rustled awake by a galloping thestral, who missed him by a couple of inches, and the fourth night he was lying awake in his bed refusing to go to sleep. He knew he had let this sleepwalking thing go on for too long and if he didn’t do anything about it soon there wouldn’t be any chances left. He’d cheated death a couple of times too many, and no one likes a cheat.
“But–” Draco began, nothing Ron said made any sense. “Rejected him? He said he didn’t want me there.” Wasn’t that what Harry had said before the water was turned on? Draco tried to recall what he heard that evening but since everything around him was a bit fuzzy at the edges it did nothing to improve his memory.
”Malfoy’s don’t do fun, Potter! We do sophisticated activities,” Draco said while folding his paper.
“Malfoy?”
Harry nodded and they left the room.
“Good.” Draco stroked his cheek. “I’ll be back later, and then we will talk about this if you want to?”
“Father?” Draco stood up. “Care to explain what happened to my mother?”
Harry didn’t know how long he’d been sitting at the table, staring into the distance, when Ron sat down beside him.
Potter was heading for the bar for the fourth time in only an hour. He nodded to Draco, as he’d done the three times before, and waved to get attention from the bartender. It was getting ridiculous, no one needed to go to the bar that often in that short amount of time. Draco could see from Potter’s tense jaw and his clenched fist that he was uncomfortable.
It took a while before Harry answered the door, and Draco was pacing back and forth, nervous but not knowing where else to go. When the door finally opened, Harry didn’t appear angry as Draco had thought he would. Instead, he looked at Draco with worry in his eyes.
Harry nodded and scratched the back of his head. “It’s not much to look at but it’s soft, and it’ll keep you warm through the night.” He backed towards the stairs. “I’ll be in my room upstairs if you need anything. Goodnight, Draco.”
“I’ll watch him today, dear. But, maybe it’s best if you find a more permanent solution onwards. You know I love him dearly, but I’m not getting any younger I’m afraid. I’m sure it would work with one of the elves, they did a fine job with you, didn’t they?”
Draco scoffed. “Please, Potter. You know I heard you when you were talking to Ron.”
”Harry?”
“Harder! More!” Harry moaned. “Please, just fuck me again!”
Draco actually had a good time at first. He gave his present to Granger, who gave him a genuine smile and a firm handshake as a thank you. Ron introduced him to some of his colleagues, although he had already met them once or twice in the store, they nodded politely in greeting. He couldn’t see Kristoff anywhere, but from Ron and his interactions at work Draco hadn’t thought they were friends, but it was a relief anyway. All through the evening, Potter was hovering around nearby, casting suspicious glances at Draco. Sometimes Draco thought Potter was heading in his direction, only for him to stop midways and grab a hold of someone else to talk to. Draco could feel a sting of disappointment every time Potter broke eye contact with him, not realising that he had wanted to talk to Potter in the first place. Maybe he just had a hope to have a normal conversation with him without Teddy and Scorpius around as a buffer.
“What do you mean there are no available appointments?” Draco was kneeling by the fireplace at Andromeda’s, talking to a receptionist at St Mungo’s.
“No, I’m Ernie, remember?” Harry said, aiming a very sharp stab of his elbow into Draco’s ribs.
“You can stay if you want. I’ll go grab you a blanket.” Harry went down a corridor and came back with a knitted blanket, embroidered crooked letters all around the edges.
Just when the dragon was opening its snout, Ron tossed the thing away in Draco’s direction, he caught it midair and put it down on the window shelf again, the dragon puffing smoke out of its nose.
“I heard someone’s alarm go off a while ago and couldn’t go back to sleep, then I heard footsteps and wanted to see if something was up.”
“I would like to ask you to not let your feelings towards me interfere with the treatment of my mother.”
Ron handed him the papers and Draco put them back again.
Harry was trembling on the desk, he parted his legs as much as the trousers around his ankles let him, and pushed back on Draco’s fingers. “Stop being such a fucking tease and fuck me already.”
Potter however, was still a tense affair. They weren’t hostile to each other when they crossed paths at Andromeda’s nowadays, but they weren’t exactly friendly either. Potter was usually fidgety and looked like he wanted to be anywhere else in the world than standing talking to Draco. They seldom exchanged more than a few words between them, and the words that were said were often about the weather or how big Teddy and Scorpius had gotten.
Draco winced. “Yes, about that. I misheard you at Hermione’s birthday party. I was so sure you said you didn’t want me there.”
“Flattery will get you nowhere.” Narcissa shook her head, but Draco could see that the corners of her mouth twitched a little. “Your father and I are going out for a walk in the garden. Scorpius was welcome to come along, but he said he would rather be with you.”
“Harry is fine, you know,” Potter said, tapping Draco on his knee, leaving his hand resting against Draco's leg.
“I really do, all of you,” Harry said, leaning forward and brushing his lips against Draco’s cheek. Draco closed his eyes and hummed in response.
Something ached inside of Draco’s chest. Scorpius didn’t have that many adults in his life who showed him affection. There was Draco and Andromeda of course, and sometimes even his mother would give Scorpius a kiss on the top of his head, but his father wasn’t, and never had been, big on affection, and since they had no contact with Astoria’s parents, the loss of their daughter being too hard for them, there weren’t any more adults that could show Scorpius some love. Draco had to turn away before the sight in front of him made him all sappy. It was his birthday, for Merlin’s sake.
“Who is stealing, Mother?” he asked in a gentle tone, knowing that his mother could react to anything she found unpleasant.
“Why would I be mad?” Harry didn’t understand. “I slept in your bed, without your consent. Why are you looking at me like that?”
“Draco?” Someone shook his shoulder gently, making his forehead rock against the bar. Someone must have spilled something because Draco was fairly sure that his forehead was glued onto the surface. He was also fairly certain that he was the one who had knocked the sticky content of his glass all over the bar.
a tiny voice in Draco’s head whispered. You
Draco didn’t have it in him to be mad, he was just sad that it had to come to this. He sat in silence while his mother kept on spitting out accusations towards Scorpius, calling him by one foul name after another. It was hard to see his mother like this. While she could be cunning, she had never been evil towards the ones she loved, and seeing her in front of him right now was like witnessing a completely different person. He left his mother on the sofa, asking one of the elves to try to get her something to eat instead.
Great, more work, Draco thought. He would be late for the ball tonight if he was supposed to be done with two reports and shop for new robes. God forbid he’d wear something he’d worn before.
Draco put Scorpius in his bed before he went and got himself ready for the night. He would have to have a conversation with his parents in the morning about not letting Scorpius stay up this late. When he was done, he slowly let himself under the covers so he wouldn’t wake Scorpius, but when he put an arm around him he turned towards Draco, still awake.
”This is a horrible idea, Potter!” Draco said, still not looking up from his paper.
He was head down on a carpet at Harry’s place, never had he been more mortified in his entire life and Harry didn’t want him to go anywhere. This was awful. He didn’t know how long he was lying there before he felt Harry’s hands on him again, helping him up and then lowering him down on a couch. He could feel a phial being pressed into his hand, and he gingerly lifted it to his mouth and drained the content. He had a firm grip on the couch with his other hand as the potion made its way through his body. He was sweating by the time it started working.
“Dad?” Scorpius asked carefully.
”Fine! But not Moscow. What about Paris?” Harry asked, sounding hopeful.
“Oh, come off it Weasley. Your brother has far worse dangerous things in his store and you know it.” He shook his head.
“I– Er– Okay look, I was kidding. I was trying to make a joke. Clearly, I’m terrible at it.” Potter looked embarrassed.
Draco went to the couch and sat down again. “I made an utter fool of myself yesterday. It’s not a position I’m comfortable with. It was easier to leave without acknowledging that.” He took a sip from the other cup. The coffee was rich and strong, and he closed his eyes to savour the taste.
“What do you mean she isn’t here?” He kneeled down before her. “Where is she?”
“I seem to have been sleepwalking a bit lately. So, sorry if I’ve woken you, or ignored you or whatever,” he said a bit awkwardly.
“Nimly, please bring the plate to my mother. She needs to eat,” Draco begged.
Draco nodded.
Harry went slowly, taking his time, as Draco’s body accepted more fingers in him. Harry’s thick digits started twisting and crooking inside him, Draco let out a half sob when Harry found that special spot and kept prodding at it.
Malfoy almost looked surprised for a second, before his features went back to the same neutral look he always wore around Harry.
Draco sighed, but nodded. “Yes, I don’t know what, something’s amiss. I just need to find a way to make her better.”
He searched the room, knowing that the poor sod would be here somewhere. He always was. Finally, Draco spotted him in a corner, crowded by Ministry employees. He looked like an animal, trapped in a cage. He had a strained smile on his face, and his eyes were looking everywhere else than on the people in front of him. Draco contemplated for a second to go and save him, again, but his former attempts at doing so had all fallen flat. He’d tried to walk up to Potter to strike a conversation, knowing how it felt to be in a place for the sole reason that someone else wanted you to, but usually he could only get a few words out of Potter before someone else sweeped in and took over the conversation. Sometimes he’d tried a different approach, by trying to get a rise out of Potter, but Potter was still wary of Draco, though they’d been working in the same building for years now. So this night, Draco thought Potter wouldn’t welcome his approach anyway.
“Good. I’m taking you to my place then. Do you think you’ll be able to side along with me?”
“But, don’t you think he’s starting to look…” she lowered her voice to a whisper, “a bit fat?”
“Sorry, there’s nothing we can do,” she said, trying to hide a smile while looking down at her paperwork.
“Yes, you are. I think you’ve had enough now, Harry. You should go home and sleep it off. I’ll go find someone who can help you get home safely.” Ron winked, and then stumbled away, leaving Harry feeling very confused.
The smell Draco was inhaling, living off of, changed slightly, leading to Draco almost cumming in his pants. His mate was aroused. For him. With that thought, Draco collapsed into a chair, feeling faint with lust.
He had spent his days lying motionlessly in bed, or sitting by the window wondering whether he should make everyone's lives easier and jump.
"Please Draco, no, don't do this to yourself," Harry whispered, close to tears.
But in those moments, those rare occasions that I would let myself dream, he was perfect. I could not bear to think what I had lost.
Draco and Harry made their way down the stairs skittishly. They were both running on little sleep, and yet they felt more refreshed than they had for as long as they could remember.
They both froze. It had been an automatic response, Harry had not become accustomed to being soothed by his mate yet, having lived his life with little love for so long and on Draco's part, it had also been an instinct he had never before experienced, and was regretting succumbing to.
Malfoy shoved his foot into the accelerator. There were tears streaming down his face now as he thought of the disappointment his father would have in his eyes, the way his mother wouldn't be able to look him in the eyes, he just hoped that his mate would be able to help him through this. He just hoped that his mate would accept him. He hoped he would accept his mate.
Why would he want someone like you anyway, it's not like you're anything special, or a girl!
His father was proud of his ambition, his wanton need to bring his mate home, and to showcase this pride, he let his little boy take his favourite car, the red sporty jaguar, which was also coincidentally the fastest car in the garage at the pack house.
He cringed away from the thought, unwillingly having to confront the thought of living with a homophobic mate.
Therefore, his conclusion that the self-loathing was coming from his mate was not that far fetched, and as such, went before the Alpha and got permission to go on a road trip to find his soulmate.
Just happened to be watching as the pack's cars came screeching around the bend. Just happened to be watching from the second story window as his mate was unloaded by his worried Alpha. Just happened to be watching as Ernie shouted for them to ready a room in the clinic. Just happened to be watching as the crumpled figure of Draco Malfoy was loaded onto a stretcher and carted off to the pack's hospital wing.
"Don't worry, I don't know what came over me, it won't happen again," he muttered, clearing his throat.
Draco could not help himself and started to nuzzle Harry's head. He could not get enough of his mate's scent.
He gave Draco a bear hug and practically climbed into his lap, resting his head on Draco's shoulder.
"Uh, Harry?" Alpha Ernie jolted him back into reality.
Alpha Ernie had followed Harry at a distance to make sure his mate was going to be alright, and was now watching the two boys sit together in companionable silence. He was overjoyed by the fact that his adopted son finally seemed to be happy. Even though he was still quiet, Ernie had been around him for long enough to know how the boy was feeling, and he had a light around him that Ernie had never seen before.
Malfoy staggered, wanting to run after the delectable ass disappearing up the stairs, but he couldn't. Harry had run, Harry didn't want him. He wasn't sure that he wanted Harry.
And she had proved him right by being a bad parent to him and a bad wife to his father. Now, she had to make things right.
Draco could see Potter in his room.
But now, they knew they could trust. There was still a long way to go, both of them know it would be difficult, but in that moment, each of them made a promise to themselves.
The rest of the pack thought his presence in the pack mind link felt stronger than ever, even if he was not communicating.
Draco Malfoy was turning eighteen. He wasn't sure if he was ready, but if you met him, you never would've guessed. He let off an air of confidence that more experienced alphas struggled to match. His piercing silver gaze difficult to meet and his stands radiating confidence. His father, Lucius Malfoy was the current Alpha of the Blue Lake Pack, but in ten days when Draco turned eighteen, he would become the Alpha.
Draco just scoffed and pulled Harry closer, lying back down on the bed, "I don't want to talk about it."
"Draco what's going on? Are you okay?" asked Harry, fluttering nervously.
So what if this made everything more painful? Right now, Draco felt selfish. He just wanted to be held by his mate.
The pile of blankets on the bed shook, before replying, "I-I'm sorry for waking you up. I'll be quiet."
He also knew that this meant he had to drag his anguished body downstairs or his father would kill him right where he lay.
Not even he understood what happened, but whenever he asked the moon goddess for an explanation, he hears the same comforting words drum around his skull, "You will never touch my son!"
He was sadly mistaken when the Alpha practically chucked him out of the house and demanded he never returned, never again spread lies that his son, Draco Malfoy, was a homosexual.
Stupid, reckless, harmful, rebellious, annoying, little brat.
Her forest green eyes looked down fondly at the tiny boy in front of her. He was about to fall asleep, her idle rocking of the cradle having more of an effect on him than she could imagine. The same shade of green was mirrored in his eyes as he looked up with a content sleepy smile, his raven hair already needing to be pushed out of his eyes at the tender age of one.
A promise to try.
There was no ways his parents would ever let him back into the pack. Everything he had planned for in life. Running away until his parents died and he could go back and be in charge... it would never happen.
Seeing so much happiness was triggering my fight or flight response, and I was yet to know  which was the better option.
I had heard - through the grape vine - that he was gay and when he had come out, his whole pack had celebrated. I had been fuming, unable to comprehend how it would have happened.
The baring of teeth to show happiness was not a common occurrence in the Malfoy Manor, more often it was to show distaste, or aggression.
Draco was ready to finish school, he had already learnt all there was to know from the Blue Lake Pack's library. He had always been scholarly as a boy, but now he focused his efforts on tracking the tugging of his heart.
Some how Harry had found his way to outside Alpha Ernie's office, just as the Alpha was exiting the room.
Harry woke up with a start, not knowing what woke him and feeling disoriented until - He was here. In. This. Very. Building. His presence so dominating, Harry was rock hard at the thought that his mate was here for him.
And then the doctor had come, I had had no time to find the words to say sorry, to explain how wrong it felt for me to be with another man, even though it felt so right.
He probably hated me, and rightly so.
He suddenly leapt out of bed, realising his mate didn't know which room he was in, and the hotel wasn't going to let him up the stairs without invitation from one of the guests. With a newfound spirit, he pulled on some jeans and shoes and sprinted down the stairs.
Instead he turned back to the mess on the table in front of him. On the first day that Narcissa had left it had been a map of the area surrounding the pack lands. That map had slowly had red drawn over it as the pack searched for their missing Luna. Then the maps pile grew. All the maps they had, then all the phone calls she had made, all the purchases on her bank cards, her family, close and distant: names, numbers, addresses, all being searched.
Yet again, Harry froze. Draco turned lazily with no intention of letting go of his mate's hand. His mate.
They had met before, at functions and such for Alphas, and the meetings had not gone well.
His body was hooked to multiple machines, pumping multi-coloured liquids in and out of his body.
The blonde boy looked up as Harry approached, quickly wiping the tears off his face and sitting up straighter, "You shouldn't have come looking for me, you need to eat food."
Harry was too astounded to question it in the moment, and instead flounced over to the bed, no longer feeling bad for not being a good host.
He was a sorry sight, if anyone had looked up the would have seen him standing all alone in the window. He was waif-like at that point, with big, black bags under his eyes from lack of sleep, frail skin and bones from lack of food.
Eventually, Draco calmed down. His breathing steadied and his arms cautiously wrapped around Harry's lean body, pulling him closer.
Draco's hair seemed shinier and he noted how it seemed to be slightly springier than usual. His cheeks seemed less sunken and his eyes were looking brighter. The Malfoy-ice-grey eyes were wide, taking in his surroundings as if seeing them for the first time, which he felt like he was.
He felt as though The Goddess was warning him, telling him to prepare.
Each one was staring into the other's eyes and contemplating all the choices that they had made that had lead up to this moment, the drive to that fateful hotel room and the hurried judgements that had resulted in the delay.
He knew is family wasn't accepting, he had grown up in a house of Malfoys, he wasn't sure if he was accepting.
Draco sobbed silently, unable to tell to Harry to run away now and not to look back. Yes, he was there now, but very soon Draco would have to leave. He could not stay in a place where he was not wanted. Especially by a mate who had rejected him.
Draco stepped into the room and closed the door behind him.
Draco coughed a little, a light flush spread on his face. “I’m pretty sure Bert and Ernie don’t usually hold hands.”
Draco raised his hands, in a gesture to stop Potter from rambling on any further. “Relax! I’m not judging you. Drink all of it and see if I care. I’m only pointing out that perhaps one of your companions could fetch drinks as well, couldn’t they?”
“I just don’t get what he's doing here?”
Draco had one hand left on Harry’s arse, leaving his hole exposed only for Draco. He let his thumb rubbing circles around it, and then gently pushed the tip in, only to pull it out again. The second time, he let his thumb go further, and felt the heat inside of Harry, imagined his own cock doing the same.
One thing he did notice about his mother however, apart from her being more quiet, was that she had a harder time keeping up with conversations. At first, Draco had brushed it off, maybe she wasn’t interested, maybe she didn’t have anything to contribute to the conversation at the moment. But, when she didn’t immediately answer Scorpius' question a couple of days ago, and Scorpius had to repeat the question two more times, Draco had started to worry in a way he hadn’t before. His mother adored Scorpius, she always took her time with him, and it never seemed like a hardship for her. They could play for hours, and they always had secret conversations that Draco wasn't allowed to be a part of. He had been jealous at first, but when he saw how happy they were together it melted away all the lingering feelings of being left out. But now, seeing Scorpius fight a little harder to get attention from his mother alerted him that it was time to stop pushing down that feeling that something wasn’t quite right.
Draco stayed inside as they both got their breaths in order. He nuzzled against Harry’s neck, breathing in the faint scent of sweat and sex that lingered on his skin.
Harry shrugged, ”I haven’t.”
“Fuck!” Harry moaned, pressing his face against Draco’s neck. “Bed?”
Draco did what Harry asked, and he moaned shamelessly when Harry arranged him on his knees with his arse high in the air. He muttered a wandless cleaning spell into one of Harry’s pillows, and Harry huffed a tiny laugh into the base of his spine. Even though he anticipated it, the first feel of Harry’s tongue against his hole made him clench, and the tip of Harry’s tongue traced his rim until he relaxed again. It had been a long time since anyone had done this to him, and Draco knew that nothing in the past could compare to this. Harry was alternating between broad strokes and tiny licks against his arsehole, and Draco tried not to push back against Harry’s face but when a blunt fingertip almost petted his hole he rocked back a little, and was rewarded with a finger slowly inching into him, then carefully out.
Hazy flashbacks told Harry that he’d made an utter fool of himself yesterday, and he could feel his panic rising.
The bell chimed while Draco was organising tiny dragon figurines in the shop window and Ron and his colleague came strutting in for the third time that week. He knew they were always trying to catch him in the act of doing something illegal, but since he was only in charge of decorating and managing the register they never got what they wanted.
“What are you wearing?”
“I’m afraid you have rely on other people to fill in the blanks for you. What is the last thing you remember?” healer Biddle asked.
“Mr Malfoy! There’s no need for you to be rude,” the receptionist, Moira, said. “As I told you over the Floo, there are no available appointments in the near future.”
They stayed silent for the rest of the ride, and when the doors opened Potter left first without a goodbye.
Draco felt calmer when they were finally seated for dinner. They’d had tea many times before and even though both Scorpius and Andromeda had been around as a buffer at those times, this felt more relaxed and natural. But as the plates were finished and Harry suggested they move to the living room, Draco’s stomach was tied in knots again.
Draco blushed, not feeling brave enough to voice out all of his fantasies.
Draco put everything on his desk back to its rightful place, and stood up. He had never before given in to shame, and he wasn’t going to do so today either. Maybe Potter hadn’t heard it all, maybe he was just flustered because of their raised voices. Yes, that was probably it. But, if Draco was going to that damn ball, he was going to look impeccable. He had some shopping to do.
Harry was vaguely aware that people were talking around him. But he couldn't quite lift his head from the table. He tried to tell them that he was fine sleeping here, but he couldn’t even manage to get any words out.
As he went to the bar he couldn’t help to dance along to the music, swaying with every step. He knew he had the goofiest smile on his face but he was too happy to be self conscious about it. Sometimes it was just nice to let go a little.
Draco looked down at the hand for a second, before he clasped it and shook it, feeling a chill going through his body. “Thank you. We’ll be there.”
“Now who is the one being a bit slow on the uptake, Malfoy?” Potter smiled, walking towards Draco.
“Of course it’s enough.” Harry tried to put a hand over Draco’s on the table but Draco wouldn’t let him. “I was only thinking that Scorpius is going to little wizard school in the fall, right? And––” Harry stopped himself.
“I need to get Scorpius. I’m sure Andromeda would like to be released from taking care of two six-year-olds.”
“Um, yes?” Harry answered, feeling a bit sheepish. Malfoy let out a big sigh. “So, you stopped me? Every time?”
“I heard enough.” Draco dried his hands. “I’m not interested to hear anymore so I’ll be out of your hair in a second.” He turned and left a gaping Potter behind.
Potter gave him a scrutinizing look a couple of seconds too long, then he looked down.
“Let’s get you a cup of tea,” Andromeda said to Narcissa.
“Who’s alarm?”
Draco and Michael only came as far as outside the Ministry when Draco kissed his cheek and wished him a good night. Somehow he wasn’t feeling it anymore. He disapparated before Michael could say anything.
“Thank you,” Draco said, relieved, then he looked down. “It’s my fault she’s here, you know?”
“You done, Harry? They’re waiting down at the Leaky.” He turned towards Malfoy. “You too, ferret face.”
With Christmas around the corner, he knew he had to apologise to Potter so as not to make it awkward when they crossed paths at Andromeda’s, he just didn’t know how, and after several attempts at writing a letter, he just let it go, dreading boxing day with each passing hour.
“You want to have dinner with me?” Draco asked, taking a couple steps forward.
then,” Harry said, emphasizing the word friend with raised eyebrows at Draco, which Draco ignored. “How do we chose where we’re going?”
“Happy birthday, dear,” she said softly and pulled back from the hug. She turned to Potter, who had followed Draco into the garden, still looking sheepishly down on his shoes. “Harry, darling. Come and join us for tea.”
Draco scoffed to himself. They had come a long way since the war, especially since Pansy prioritized Gryffindors over him. But he loved her, so he could endure one night at this shitty establishment, watching the group from where he sat alone at the bar. He knew he was only accepted to join by the grace of Pansy, and he had no interest in making conversation with people who loathed him. He suspected the feeling was mutual, for most of them.
Draco shook his head. “No, you don’t.” He wasn’t in the mood for celebrating losing his job. Maybe he shouldn’t have said anything, but if the Aurors were closing in on Mr Finley it was only a matter of time before he lost his job anyway.
“We will get you sorted with a memory healer as soon as possible, but I advise you to contact your family and friends to help you with the missing pieces. I will arrange some potions, which will be delivered to you at home. You’re free to go now. The memory healer will contact you within a day or two. Take care, Mr. Malfoy, and don’t hesitate to contact us if you feel any physical discomfort.” He handed Draco a pamphlet with information about memory healing and left.
“Draco, dear? Where’s your date?” She laughed.
“You don’t think I can take care of my mother? Is that what this is? I made a mistake and now you think I’m incapable of taking care of her?” Draco stood, trying to keep his temper in order.
”Yes, sir, congratulations on a great event!” He shook Shacklebolt’s hand.
Draco swallowed before he said, “I was perhaps thinking you could be a different kind of mate.”
Harry seemed to have caught on because he started kissing down Draco’s neck. “Did I do this?” He slowly sank down on his knees in between Draco’s legs and pushed them apart to fit himself against Draco.
Draco knew he was being childish, but he was too embarrassed. “No,” he sighed.
And that was that. No hexes, no screaming or accusation of Harry being a creep sneaking into other people’s beds. Just their regular greeting, like any other day. Harry couldn’t decide if he was relieved that Malfoy probably hadn’t notice anything, or disappointed if he had and that was the reaction to it. That night he tied both his arms and legs to his bed and whispered a silent prayer that he would wake in the same position the next morning.
Malfoy was staring at Harry with big eyes, like he couldn’t believe what he was hearing.
“So, that’s it then? There’s nothing more we can do?” Draco asked.
Draco could only blink, trying to make sense of the words he had heard before and after he zoned out. He cleared his throat before speaking. “I’m sorry, Potter. Why wouldn’t she be able to live at home?”
“It’s just a bit of turbulence, nothing dangerous. Put your seatbelt on,” Harry said, in what he thought was a soothing voice. Apparently not soothing enough.
“Thank you,” Draco said, following Ron inside. Potter was left standing in the doorway.
Lifting his head was a hard task, but Draco tried while still keeping his eyes closed. He could feel someone clasping his face, and once again someone kept talking to him. “Draco, look at me. Where’s Scorpius?”
Draco pushed his hand down on his own cock so he wouldn’t come at the sight alone. “Did you just…?”
me, Kingsley! You told me I could miss out on this one. It doesn’t even have anything to do with the Auror department.”
“Mr. Potter is listed as your emergency contact.” The healer said, now looking at Draco with a curious expression. “Are you quite alright, Mr. Malfoy?”
Draco sighed. “Perhaps, but you meant what you said, right?”
“Potter? Shit!”
“Draco, calm down!” He tried to take a grip of Draco’s arm but Draco wouldn’t let him.
“Well what?” Harry said, raising his voice a bit, making Malfoy stir. Hermione glanced at Malfoy, furrowing her brows and asked in a lower voice;
Draco apparated home to his “hot date”; a good book and several glasses of goblin wine.
“Only to see you, old pal.” Ron winked and nudged Draco’s shoulder.
”Ah! Harry and Draco! Lovely event so far, don’t you think?” Shacklebolt said.
Their second day was spent either in silence or mean bickering. Harry wanted to go to the beach, Draco called him a simple tourist and wanted to go to Park Güell. Harry wanted to eat tapas at a tourist trap on Las Ramblas, Draco called him stupid and made reservations for a much more expensive restaurant. The food was terrible. They spent the last day apart and Draco felt awful.
“To what do I owe the pleasure of being awoken by my beautiful mother this morning?” Draco asked, as he seated himself against the headboard, Scorpius snuggling up against him.
Narcissa took a step closer and carded her fingers through Draco’s sleep tousled hair, putting the strands behind his ear. She stilled her hand as she looked out through the window. After a few seconds, she shook her head and removed her hand from Draco. She gave them both a little smile before she headed for the door.
“Yes, you’re lying in your own come,” Harry huffed against him. “Cleaning charm okay?”
When Shacklebolt finally left, Draco scanned the ballroom. There was no need to search for Potter in here, he was already gone.
they had apparated straight to Mrs Lindon’s garden, to get her kneazle out of a tree. She’d claimed it was an emergency, like she always did, but they should’ve known better by now. The file reports concerning Mrs Lindon were as high as all their other cases piled together. He and Malfoy were literally drowning in paperwork that needed to be done as soon as possible, otherwise one or several cases would be taken from them, which both of them were too stubborn to let happen. That’s why they were still stuck at work, writing one report after another.
Harry scrunched up his face and put a finger up to shush Malfoy. “Yeah, about that?”
Harry took Draco’s hand and led him into his office. Instead of sitting behind his desk he sat beside Draco in one of the visitors' chairs, still holding on to his hand.
Harry spluttered.
Harry nodded. “Yes. I didn’t mean to make you upset. It came out wrong.”
Harry’s smile was blinding when he put his arms around Draco and dragged him close. “I thought you didn’t like me,” he whispered.
“Every day I wake up, and I fear that this is the day I’ll meet my mother in the corridor and she won’t recognise me. That she won’t know who I am.” Draco swallowed the lump in his throat making the words harder to get out. “She raised me, took care of me, sang me lullabies and kept me safe when things were at their darkest. And I’m scared that I will look her in the eyes and there’ll be nothing, no recognition. It makes me so fucking scared.” He turned away from Harry again, staring up at the ceiling. “It makes me avoid her. What the fuck is wrong with me, Harry? I stay away from home so I don’t have to see her because I don’t want to stop being her son and become a stranger. And if I stay away I don’t have to deal with that. It makes me the worst fucking son in the universe, and I hate it but I can’t seem to change it.” He covered his face with his hands. “And now I’ve lost my job, and instead of being happy that I finally did something right for a change, I regret it because now I don’t have a place to go to anymore. So no, Harry, I won’t go home quite yet, if that’s alright with you.” He sneaked a glance at Harry but looked away again when he caught Harry’s sad expression. “I’m sorry for dumping all that on you,” he said, sitting up. “Your potion was shit by the way, I’m still drunk.”
They’d been sitting in the joint kitchen at Janus Thickey, his mother nursing a cup of tea which Draco kept reheating, when she looked him straight in the eye.
Harry cleared his throat and looked over at Malfoy’s desk, where he appeared to be sitting deep in concentration. As Harry’s eyes lingered, he could see that Malfoy’s reading glasses were balancing on the tip of his nose, and something that sounded suspiciously like snoring reached his ears. Harry couldn’t suppress a smile. Malfoy looked so peaceful in his sleep. He was usually so strict, and his hard yet handsome features always made him look like a right twat. But now, his face looked soft and inviting. In a platonic way, of course. It was Malfoy for Merlin’s sake. Surely one could appreciate fine features in a friend. Harry could even admit that Ron was a nice looking bloke as well.
Harry woke up feeling way too hot. There was a loud roaring in his head, and he felt like death himself.
He was trying to channel some of her confidence when he stood outside Harry’s place, but the nerves made his smile falter and his heart was performing somersaults in his chest. When Harry finally opened the door and greeted him with an easy smile, Draco let out a deep breath before stepping into the flat. Harry took his coat and gave him a quick kiss before ushering  him into the kitchen. Draco sat by the kitchen island and watched as Harry finished making their meal. Harry seemed at ease while he was cooking and he had a grace that Draco hadn’t been aware of before, making it hard for Draco to keep his hands to himself. Harry seemed to struggle even more because he kept giving Draco lingering touches every time he went by him to get everything in order.
Draco reluctantly turned to Potter again. There was a drink placed in front of Draco, a Vodka on the rocks. He looked at Potter with his eyebrows raised.
Draco shook his head, “Not today, Potter. Not today.”
“Good night,” Draco answered. When Harry had reached the top of the stairs Draco said his name to stop him. “Thank you. I’ll be out first thing in the morning but again, thank you. For helping me with my mother and helping me tonight. You didn’t have to.” He looked up at Potter, who smiled down at him.
For someone who disliked him so much, Potter was exceptionally warm and caring with his mother. He couldn’t have asked for a more competent healer. At the appointments that followed the first one, Potter always took his time to explain everything in a way his mother would understand, even if it took up most of the appointment. Potter had already arranged for Narcissa’s mind healer sessions at the Manor, but she had a few follow up with Potter to get her potions in order, and Draco followed her to every one of them so he could keep track of her treatment. Potter always asked to speak to Draco for a couple of minutes alone, only to repeat everything that they agreed on and then asking Draco how he was. Draco brushed it off with a simple fine, and always left his office in a hurry before he started to let his emotions get the best of him, it was hard to keep a hold of his beliefs that Potter held a grudge against him when he was being so gentle with him.
know that. He looked pleadingly over to Malfoy, trying to convey with his eyes that he should come up with an excuse to save Harry’s sorry arse. But he just smirked in response.
Draco took a deep breath. “I––” He swallowed. “I need help.”
Malfoy kept mostly to himself buried in books as far as Harry knew, so Harry had many opportunities to look his fill without Malfoy noticing him. His hair was longer now, and it shouldn’t be so mesmerizing Harry thought, he should be appalled by Malfoy growing out his hair like his father. But Malfoy didn’t resembled Lucius at all. All his features that Harry before had named pointy and annoying, were now everything that made Malfoy so bloody gorgeous. His paleness, his sharp cheekbones, his long fingers that Harry wished could touch him. He always imagined Malfoy being cold, and was curious to see if he’d been wrong about that amongst everything else he’d been wrong about.
“What?” Harry whispered against his lips.
Draco couldn’t remember anyone calling him beautiful before, he had to close his eyes to hide away the onslaught of emotions that were probably showing in his eyes. He took a deep breath and when he opened his eyes again, he put one hand in Potter’s hair and carefully pulled his head up so he could kiss him again. Somewhere in between kisses he breathed out Harry’s name. Harry broke the kiss and looked into Draco’s eyes, he gave him a tiny smile and then he kissed him again. There was more heat to the kiss this time, and he could feel Harry’s erection pushing against his own.
Draco would’ve liked to say that everything changed for the better after that, but sadly nothing major improved. His mother could keep up with conversations better, but she still got lost in her head sometimes and saw things that weren’t there, and while Draco did what Potter had said and didn’t correct her visions, his father was no help at all. He snapped at her while she had a hard time keeping up with conversations, he yelled at her when she talked about the fairies in the garden, and if she took too long to answer he simply left. Draco had tried talking to him several times, but it always ended with both of them screaming at each other and Draco storming off, leaving his father fuming in his study. His hopes about his mother being able to live at home for a long time seemed further and further away.
“I didn’t mean it like that,” Harry said, feeling a little bit silly for making Malfoy think he did. “Did it work for you then? That your mother spelled your door shut?” he asked instead. Malfoy looked at him, and then took a step away from the sofa, turning against the fireplace. Harry winced, remembering his scorched fingers a couple of nights before.
After he heard the water turn off, and the door shut, he waited a couple of seconds before standing on wobbly legs. He opened the stall door, eyes kept on the ground, and headed towards the sink to splash his face before going out again.
Malfoy startled and his head shot up, making his glasses fall on the table. With a confused expression he locked eyes with Harry.
“That little brat. Always sneaking around, taking my jewels,” his mother hissed.
He took a quill and a piece of paper, and he wrote down a short message for Ron, deciding to send it by owl later that evening. He looked around the store, let a hand sweep across the counter. He paid for a tiny fire-breathing dragon, the one that he and Ron had joked about. Maybe he could give it to Scorpius. Then he left the store, not knowing what would greet him when he came back.
“A hero that can talk to snakes, you say?” He asked Scorpius, but directed the question to Potter instead, feeling a bit awkward sitting so close to him, his thigh pressing up against Harry’s.
She was getting more lost in herself. She rarely slept, and Draco was always finding her in the middle of the night walking around the Manor. When he wanted to escort her back to her place she usually lashed out, accusing Draco of wanting to keep her as a prisoner inside of her room. Draco had tried to argue at the beginning but when his mother became angry and raised her voice he just tried to let her be. There was no harm in roaming the corridors at the Manor after all.
Harry cleared his throat. “Have you thought about a new job?”
“Well not all of us had been dragged home by force before, so excuse me for wallowing in my own self pity.” Draco slumped back against the back of the couch.
“When have you ever had me?” Draco asked, feeling very confused. This was becoming more and more like a cruel joke. Of course Draco had dreamt about being Potter’s significant other, more often than not, but never had they ever been anything close to that. Had they?
”Not a single word!” Draco stood up and gathered his things.
“Did you enjoy your evening, Potter?” Draco asked.
“She can’t wait that long. Please, there must be someone who will meet with her?” Draco begged, looking over his shoulder at Andromeda who looked back at him worriedly.
“Yes! Draco, fuck, please just give it to me!”
“How did you mean it then?” Draco couldn’t help but ask.
Scorpius nodded. “That’s okay dad. We’ll still have my party tomorrow, right?”
One drink was not enough to clear his head in the slightest. After the interrogation the day before, being led by Kristoff of all people, he was drained. But after a couple of hours, he was declared innocent and was sent home. After a stilted conversation with his aunt, it was decided that Scorpius could spend the next night at hers, and after dropping him off he was now sitting at the bar in the Leaky, feeling out of place while listening to Ron’s stories about his daughter. Draco had met her briefly, and she seemed like a very nice child, but exchanging stories from one parent to another was something he hadn’t done since Astoria was alive. It made him miss her and being sentimental only made the urge to drown his sorrows bigger. After the fourth drink, he could feel himself loosening up a little, sharing a few stories of his own. He was in the middle of telling Ron about something funny Scorpius and Teddy did once when they were at Andromeda’s when Ron interrupted him.
“It’s Seamus’ birthday party. We planned this forever ago.”
He tuned in again as she kept on going. “And that pretty girl of his, that beautiful Ginny girl, no wonder he couldn't keep her if he’s that ungrateful. Maybe he’s a terrible lover. I’ve heard he’s a terrible lover. Haven’t you heard that he is a terrible lover?”
“Dora, with all due respect. Can we please stop gossiping about Potter? I really need to get some work done.”
“Oh, he just found out that he had feelings for you.” a Ron-like voice answered.
Draco shook his head. “He and the Weasley girl broke it off years ago.” He took one look at Dora’s raised eyebrows and cleared his throat. “I think,” he said, as he started to look through his numbers again.
“Malfoy,” he said and nodded.
Draco took Harry’s hand in his and kissed his knuckles. He shook his head, “It’s nothing. Don’t mention it.”
Malfoy opened his mouth, closed it again, then opened it and got out a low “Potter”.
“Draco, what’s wrong?” Potter asked in a worried voice, but still kept his distance. “Healer Biddle, what’s wrong with him?”
“I thought that Ron was the one to ask you to come and get me yesterday?” Draco asked.
“No, don’t mention it.”
“So I do not even represent the Aurors then? I’m just going to make you look good, is that it?”
A while later, Harry felt the plane starting to shake, and the “fasten seatbelt” sign was turned on. Harry gently nudged Draco in the side. “Bert, wake up! Put your seatbelt on.”
“She belongs at home,” Draco said, unwilling to budge.
He went and gave Pansy a kiss on the cheek. She didn’t fuss over his departure, he’d only promised her an hour, after all.
“Of course, darling,” Draco answered, not knowing if it was for his own or Scorpius’ benefit.
Draco squeezed back. “I’m interested. I just really thought you still hated me, after all these years.”
He had tried everything to keep himself from leaving his bed unintended at night. But he’d somehow managed to remove all kinds of barriers while asleep, and he was running out of ideas of what to do. The other day he was on the verge to ask Hermione for help, but when she looked at him with those worried eyes, he asked her about his homework instead. She hadn’t bought it, but she didn’t pry either, so he counted that as a win.
indicates you had one too many. Don’t you and Draco have that big speech tomorrow?” Hermione looked worryingly at him.
Their acquaintances had started out strained, to say the least. When Draco started at the Ministry, Potter had welcomed him with a brief handshake, and that was it. Now they nodded to each other in passing, and sometimes made stilted conversation when they were forced together at gatherings or meetings.
“Well I’m sorry, you would’ve laughed in my face if I suggested that and I didn’t want anybody else to do it."
“I thought I heard your voices yesterday, thought maybe it was a regular thing.”
“Speak for yourself. You’re not the one who’s been lecturing all day. I feel like Professor Binns.”
He closed the door and opened the journal again, his finger brushing over the date that stated that the last entry was three months ago.
“Yes, Draco! Don’t get your knickers in a twist. I spoke to Neville, and we think you’ll be pleased. Here, grab this and head to our departing room. It will activate in ten minutes.” Blaise handed Draco a scrunchie and smiled at them both, shooing them in the direction of the room.
Ron looked at him funny. “Yes,” he said slowly. “Your feelings for the ferret. Very loving feelings.”
“This is really nice, isn't it?” Harry said, slamming his forth beer down on the table. He could feel how all the stress was leaving his body, he hadn’t felt this relaxed in a long time. “I really needed that one,” he continued, to no one in particular.
“That you fancy Malfoy.” Seamus laughed. “Go get him, tiger. Rawr.” Seamus did a funny thing with his hand, like a claw slashing through the air.
“Nonsense, Draco. That can wait. Off you go, now!” Shacklebolt put on his travelling cloak and left the room.
Draco folded the letter and took a deep breath. Then there was a sharp pain in his head. He fell down on his knees, clutched his head between his hands and closed his eyes. Image after image washed over him as glimpses of his life passed by. And Harry was everywhere. In school, on the platform, in his Auror uniform sitting at his desk, at the coffee shop, in Draco’s kitchen cooking food, Harry on his bed trembling when Draco entered him, and the most recent memory of them all, standing in the doorway, telling him he had fallen for Draco.
Draco turned and looked at Potter, who still had a tense vibe all over him, not really meeting Draco’s eyes. “I appreciate the offer, but no. I’m late for my date.” Draco said, taking a last look on Potter face who suddenly looked a bit more closed off. If he didn’t knew better, he would say that Potter looked disappointed, but that was a crazy thought so Draco shook it off.
Harry nodded at him, “Malfoy,” he said, then turned around and went to his room.
”I promise, I will burn those pictures the minute I come home, and I won’t utter a word about the striptease — ”
Harry was just about to answer with a snarky comment, when the door to their office opened and Ron stuck his head in.
“I– I can’t face her, Harry. I don’t– I don’t know what to say.”
Malfoy turned abruptly.
Draco looked around again. “Should I clean this up?” he asked Ron.
He didn’t see his friends that often, most of the former Slytherins had moved elsewhere after the war. He had a weekly chat with Pansy, who was living in Bordeaux, married to a pureblood wizard with an enormous wine garden, but their conversations felt more mandatory as they didn’t have much in common anymore. He sometimes visited Blaise in Italy when he could get a couple of days off work. Scorpius loved staying with Blaise, so it was too bad they couldn’t do it as often as they liked. Draco had lost touch with Greg after the war, he didn’t know where he was now and all his owls were left unanswered.
He didn’t seem to mean it in a bad way, and Draco still clung to the words that Harry actually didn’t hate him. “Is it bothering you?” he asked gently, instead of lashing out which he would’ve done in the past.
Potter laughed, out loud. Draco couldn’t remember if he ever heard Potter laugh so uninhibited around him before. “I’m so not here for Dora.”
Potter, who’d been standing, still panting, startled when Shacklebolt closed the door and looked at Draco. Draco could see from Potter’s face that he’d forgot Draco sat there.
”Boyfriends?” Potter raised his eyes meeting Draco’s. ”Do you do boyfriends?”
Draco took out the letter and placed it in Harry’s hand. Harry tangled their fingers together and then they were off.
“I’m sorry, Mr Malfoy,” she said, not sounding sorry at all. “There’s a long waiting list for all of our Healers. Perhaps try to call back after a couple of months or so?”
Draco nodded, “Clearly.”
Draco nodded, he was too spent to get up and clean off his mess.
“No! No, I didn’t mean it like that.” Harry shook his head. “I’m glad that you’re friends. It’s good.” He looked embarrassed. “Ron talks a lot while he’s drunk, I’m sure you noticed.”
“I’ll go tell the elves.” She raised her hand in a tiny wave and left the room.
He went to find Ron and Granger to say his goodbyes, with an excuse that Scorpius had wished for him to come home, and he apparated as soon as he came outside.
“You know very well that I don’t have a date, Pans,” he sighed.
Draco couldn't quite stop a giggle leaving him.
“I sent her away,” he said, not breaking eye contact while he took another sip.
“No, I’ll do it.” He rearranged Scorpius so he was carrying him towards himself instead. He clutched his son harder against him, breathing in the smell of his hair. “Let’s get you to bed, shall we?”
Harry cut Malfoy off. “Shit, the presentation. Draco, can I please — ”
“I like you.” There, Harry said it, and his heart was beating out of his chest. But all of this must mean Malfoy kind of like him back, right?
Draco tamped down his disappointment and nodded. Of course, Harry wouldn’t ask him out for a drink, that was preposterous. How could he ever think that was what Harry meant? He took the cup that Harry poured for him, offering a slight smile as he did, and then he left the kitchen to join the others in the living room.
Ron huffed and took a step backwards. “Surely that must be illegal?” he said with a smirk.
“Malfoy, no! That’s not what I–”
-Inspirational quote
Harry meant to start with saying that Malfoy was great at his work. But what came out instead was, “You have very fit eyes.”
“I’m sorry. For before I mean, at my office. I’m sorry.”
“No,” Draco answered quickly. “Or yes, I was, but I changed my mind.”
“Someone should tie you to that bed of yours,” Malfoy muttered.
Harry took off his glasses and rubbed at his eyes. He couldn’t do this anymore. He just wanted to take the floo home, grab something to eat and then sleep for a few hours before the whole thing started all over again. To top things off, he had to do a presentation tomorrow for the Muggle Prime Minister, to tell him about the benefits of incorporating Muggle police exercises in the auror training program. He was so unprepared, but he gathered that he could write up his presentation before going to bed. Besides, Malfoy was doing the presentation with him and he had been working on his part for a couple of weeks now. Maybe Harry could borrow some notes.
Draco was startled by the sound of Potter’s voice.
“Oh!” Narcissa said. “I didn’t know it was so late. I’m sorry dear.” She stroked Draco’s cheek. “Do you want me to put him to bed?”
Harry squinted and looked around the room. His eyes landed on an angelic figure, sitting in his dressing chair at the corner of his room.
”I’m an architect Potter, that’s what I like to do.” Draco said, sipping at his whiskey.
“Malfoy, hi.” He gave a nod back. “I didn’t know you would be visiting today. Andromeda asked me to swing by.” Potter looked around the garden and didn’t meet Draco’s eyes. Sometimes trying to get Potter to look at him was harder than beating him in a game of quidditch.
“I don’t know, it stopped before I found out which room it was coming from,” Hermione answered with a big yawn. “Well then, I’m going to sleep, you can tell Draco I’m sorry if you see him before I do.” Hermione started walking towards the stairs.
“Go check around the store Jon.” He gently shoved him in another direction before he turned towards Draco again. “Is Finley in this time?”
Draco took a tentative step forward. “That was my fault. I’m really sorry if I made you feel like I didn't want to spend time with you, because, I really do want to do that. Spend time with you, that is.”
“Nimly,” Draco asked, “why won't you bring a plate to my mother?”
“Of course, she knows, she’s smarter than I am. How could she not know?” Malfoy said, much to Harry’s surprise.
Narcissa untangled herself from Draco’s embrace and turned so she was facing him. She wiped away Draco’s tears with her thumb, like she always did when he was a child, and gave him a sad smile. “I’m tired.”
“Try. If she agrees we can meet up at her place and leave together.”
Ron winced. “Shit, I hadn’t thought about that,” he said with wide eyes.
“I like Nimly, she reads me bedtime stories,” Scorpius said with a smile.
Draco nodded, his breaths coming out harsh in the quiet room.
Draco tucked himself back in and glanced over at Harry, who had turned around and looked at him with a small smile on his face. “So? Shall we?” He held out his hand to Draco.
Get a grip Harry, he thought while rising to his feet, you just tried to off yourself in your sleep but are somehow still alive and pining after Malfoy.
Someone cleared their throat to Draco’s left, and he suddenly felt like he was drenched by a bucket of ice. He slowly turned his head and locked eyes with Potter.
The Leaky was loud and obnoxious, if you asked Draco. Not that anyone did. It wasn’t that he cared. He was used to being left out of conversations that didn’t involve his job. He liked it that way, people were horrible anyway. He had worked as a financial adviser to Minister Shacklebolt for four years now, he was good at his job and everyone knew it. The Ministry's financial situation had never been better, thanks to him. So what if he didn’t have friends lining up to be with him? Not everyone could overlook what he’d done, and he had learned to accept that.
Scorpius nodded.
When all the presents had been opened and Draco retreated to the kitchen to pour himself some more eggnog, Harry followed suit and stood beside him with only an inch to spare between them. His warm hand brushed against Draco’s when they both reached for the pitcher and Draco murmured a low apology. He looked at Harry while he topped off their drinks and his warm smile made Draco’s stomach swoop. One step closer and he would be pressed up against Harry’s whole body, one small tilt of his head and he would be inches away from his lips. He tried his hardest not to stare at Harry’s mouth, but when Harry’s tongue licked off a lingering drop of eggnog he couldn’t help but follow the motion like a man possessed. Draco could almost feel his heart in his throat as Harry opened his mouth to say something, when they were interrupted by Scorpius coming up behind him, hugging Draco and saying he wanted to go home. He gave Harry an apologetic smile but was almost relieved that Scorpius had broken up their close encounter. He was far too close to lean up against Potter and reveal something he wanted to keep hidden.
Draco could feel his stomach clench with anticipation. He stood up and approached Potter. A sliver of fear ran through his body, and just to be sure he actually understood what this meant, he put his hands on each side of Potter on the table, caging him, and leaned forward, whispering in his ear. “Prove yourself?”
“I sent her away. Don’t act so upset,” Lucius snorted. “You didn’t even notice she was gone. It’s better this way.”
Lucius put his cutlery down and took a slow sip of his wine as he locked eyes with Draco.
“Tell me about it. The way he’s always talking about you, I’m surprised he hasn’t jumped your bones already.”
“I can’t if your holding me like that,” Harry laughed, wriggling out of Draco’s grip.
“Well you are, my dear!” Pansy smirked.
Draco dropped his quill at the sound of Potter’s voice. He was standing by the door, in a pair of Muggle jeans and a grey T-shirt that showed off a body that Draco wanted to devour. He tried looking everywhere else than on Potter, but at last Draco couldn’t help himself from checking him out, letting his gaze travel from head to toe, noticing how Potter, unlike before, seemed relaxed. When he looked up again he could see a tiny smile on Potter’s face.
Draco shook his head, “No, I don’t know.”
Draco wanted to say that
His Harry. His beautiful, stubborn Harry. Who was out there somewhere, not knowing how much he meant to Draco.
Malfoys eyes widen and he looked like he’d seen a ghost. He stood up abruptly.
“I want to speak to the Aurors,” she hissed. “These people here are keeping me hostage.”
Harry huffed out a laugh. “No, you’re not.” He nudged Draco with his foot. “Thanks for telling me.”
“Um, thank you?”
“Draco, I’m going to…” Harry groaned out.
“I’m just going to…” Potter pointed to Shacklebolt’s door. “I left my wand in there.”
Potter nodded, and Draco helped his mother stand.
Narcissa was startled. “Oh Lucius, you scared me.” She held one of Scorpius’ toys against her chest while she turned towards Draco.
“What?” Harry dropped the luggage he was holding.
“Since when are there angels in hell?” he grunted, and put a pillow over his head. It was too bright anyway.
They took their time removing each other's clothes before Draco started to complain that they were too slow, but he was rewarded when he was pressed down against the mattress with a warm body over his. They laid in bed letting both of them explore the curves of their bodies, breathing in each other's air. When Draco’s lips were swollen from Harry’s bruising kisses and their moans filled up the room Harry lifted his head and looked down on Draco. “Turn around?” he whispered.
Draco couldn’t breathe properly, he wanted to get out of there before he did anything stupid, so he headed towards the Floo.
“Don’t you think he’s letting himself go a little? I mean that beard could use a little trim. And don’t even get me started on his hair. Is it really appropriate for a head Auror to have long hair? And to put in that ridiculous bun on his head? It just won’t do. He really should go to my friend Elise, you know the Muggle hairdresser? I told you about her, right?”
Harry glared at him through his fingers. He took them away and dragged them through his hair, before putting it up in a messy bun. “We could visit Charlie in Romania?”
Draco kept fucking Harry with his thumb, going as slowly as possible. He didn’t know if he’d ever get the opportunity to do this again, so he was going to savour it. Taking as much time as Harry would let him, making it memorable.
“Harry says you don’t visit her that much anymore.”
Harry dragged Seamus in for a hug, and shouted into his ear. “Mate, I’m going to talk to Malfoy. Tell him how much I like him. Like work. No, like working him. With him?”
Draco was freshly showered and dressed when he sat himself down at Harry’s kitchen table. Harry had poured them both some coffee and the table was filled with different pastries.
He didn't want Scorpius to be raised in a house filled with black magic, and even though he knew that the ministry had done a thorough search after the war, he couldn’t help but worry that they’d missed something. After several attempts to get someone from Gringotts to the Manor, getting one sorry excuse after another why they wouldn’t bother, Draco was fed up and complained to Andromeda about it in passing during one of their Floo calls. The next day Bill Weasley showed up on their doorstep with several colleagues in tow. Bill gave Draco a nod, and several hours (and two of Bill’s colleagues off to St Mungo’s) later, they were done, and the house was cleared to move into. He and Scorpius now had their own wing of the Manor, one that wasn’t afflicted from the war and tainted with bad memories of Voldemort.
“Um, hi?” Harry said, just to break the awkward silence filling the room.
Draco could see Shacklebolt flinch, and at least he looked a little guilty about it.
Draco had several questions racing through his head, the most prominent one was why Potter wanted to talk to him? He was about to ask why he never said anything, but Potter’s voice indicated that he perhaps wanted to do other stuff than just talk, so Draco settled on asking, “why were you waiting for me?”
Draco could hear a second pair of footsteps following behind, the door closing again. He sat down gingerly, not wanting to be caught hiding in a toilet stall.
-Melina Marchetta, Quintana of Charyn
Harry just gaped, the whole reason he was alive and well rested was because of Malfoy. And he thought Harry would be mad? “But why wouldn’t you say so? You said it wouldn’t work on me?”
“No, Draco. No! I’ve been mad about you since the time you started bringing Scorpius over to Andromeda’s. You were so brilliant with him, still are. And you did everything to redeem yourself after the war, and that meant so much to me, to see that you wanted to change.”
“What?”
They continued eating their breakfast in silence, then split of heading towards their different classes. Harry didn’t take as many classes as Hermione did this year, and Ron was focusing most of his time coaching the Gryffindor quidditch team, so he was alone for the rest of the day. He knew he could be a bit oblivious from time to time, but not noticing that something was off with his friends felt low even for him. Maybe if he could get this sleepwalking thing sorted out, he could be a better friend and stop living inside his own head. When it was time to go to bed that night, Harry conjured some rope and tied himself to his bedpost. It wasn’t comfortable, but maybe this would finally do it.
Potter went behind the reception and scrolled through Moira’s appointment book, ignoring her protests. He scribbled something down on the paper. “There, on the twenty fifth of September, 9 am, Narcissa will see me. Does that work for you?” He looked up at Draco.
Draco sighed, and folded the letter. He knew he was being a git, he just didn’t know how to act otherwise. The last thing he wanted to do was to hurt Harry, but he didn’t know if their friendship would survive it if he told Harry how he felt. But if he kept this up, there wouldn’t even be a friendship to begin with and that was worse.
“Salazar Harry, I know! Why are you apologizing you idiot, why aren’t you mad?” Malfoy asked Harry in a frantic voice.
After a couple of minutes he could breathe normally again, and he even managed to sit up, glancing over at Malfoy, who was looking at him with an amused smile.
“It will benefit us very much if you show up, Harry!” Shacklebolt answered.
“Two?” Harry looked confused.
“Well I was sleeping, which one should do in the middle of the night, and as I said, I heard a noise,” Harry grumbled.
“My father sent her away and I didn’t even notice.” He shook his head. “How long has she been here?”
Harry took the cup away from Draco and took his face in both of his hands. “It’s okay.” He brushed his lips against Draco’s in a gentle kiss. “You’re here now. That’s all that matters.”
“Bert?” Draco said, like he was trying out how the name sounded if he pronounced it differently. “Why did you choose Bert?”
Harry kept a firm grip on his hand, and when he pulled Draco towards him, Draco came willingly. He climbed onto Harry’s lap and kissed him, trying to pour every longing and need that he had for Harry into one kiss. When he felt he couldn’t breathe anymore from the intensity of it he pulled back. “I want to.” He traced the laugh lines around Harry’s eyes. “I really, really want to.”
Draco went for the door and turned back to give Pansy a final wave, but she was occupied with Potter, who was whispering something in her ear. She looked at Potter, shaking her head while laughing and patted him on the back.
Draco pulled out slowly, and dropped down on his chair behind him. “You’ll never have to prove yourself to me, Harry. You must know that.” He leaned forward and grabbed Harry’s arse cheeks, spread them apart, and watched his come slowly drip out of Harry’s hole. He traced the trickle of come with one finger and dragged it up to Harry’s hole again, smearing it around in slow circles. “But yes, you were fucking amazing.”
“Dad?” Scorpius whispered in his ear. “Can I sleep in your bed tonight?”
Ron nodded. “I know, but we’re still grateful. I promise you that the streets are a better place without the content of Mr Finley’s boxes being out there. And now we have everything we need to keep him. If we find him, that is. We thought we had him a couple of days ago but we lost track of him.” Ron scrunched up his face. “Sorry, that was too much information. Forget that I said anything.”
“You were the one wanting to go on a vacation with me, not the other way around.”
It was the last thing Draco heard before both he and Harry was swept away.
“Back to Weasley, are we?” Ron snorted. “And Harry knows you have changed. He talks about you all the time, sometimes I need to ask him to shut up and ask you out already, but he’s too chickenshit to do it. He just thinks that you hate him.”
Draco burned the note with a flick of his fingers before Harry could read it. “Fine, thank you then! If you could show us to our room?”
“No, no, of course you’re awake. One is always awake wandering about in the middle of the night,” Malfoy said in an odd voice, looking anywhere but at Harry.
Blaised just laughed at Draco’s attempt at shoving him away, and put an arm around his waist instead. “That makes me repeat my question. Who are we trying to fool?”
“No, maybe someone should,” Harry said shaking his head at the absurd idea. “Wait, is that what your mother did then?” Harry asked, shocked.
Harry was in the middle of a shot race with Seamus, when he got the brilliant idea that he should inform Malfoy what a good partner he was. He’d never told Malfoy how much he appreciated him and how much Harry enjoyed working with him, but he should totally do that right away.
“One would think you’ve forgotten that you are, in fact, a wizard?” Draco took a sip of his drink and stood up. “I’m going to give my best wishes to Pansy. Have a nice evening, Potter.” He started to walk away from the bar when Potter’s arm shot out and grabbed Draco by the elbow.
Potter startled and took a small step back, making his drink slosh over his hand. Draco could feel his stomach clench with the urge to grab Potter’s hand and lick the liquor off his fingers. He shook his head to make the images go away, and turned to Shacklebolt.
Draco must’ve imagined it, but he thought he saw a tiny twitch at the corner of Potter’s mouth. Potter pushed the button and the elevator began moving. It was an awkward silence and Michael repeatedly tried to take Draco’s hand, only stopping when Draco gave him a hard look.
“Come on, Draco. Wake up! I’m taking you home,” a distant voice said.
“Mistress isn’t here,” she whispered.
His mother hadn’t quite been the same after the war. At first, she seemed relieved to be at home, even though Draco kept his distance and tried to avoid his parents as much as he could, but every time he went home and visited she became more withdrawn and her eyes seemed to lose their spark. Draco could count her smiles on one hand those first years after the battle. Things became a little better after Scorpius was born, she talked more and she loved being able to spend time with him as much as she could and as much as Draco let her in the beginning. After they'd moved back home she was almost herself again for a while. His mother took care of Scorpius when Draco was caught up at work, or just too exhausted to look after his son, and things fell into a routine after that. But last year his mother had started to change again. It wasn’t something that happened from one day to the next, it was more a slow subtle change in her behaviour, one where she became quieter and lost in her own thoughts more often, and the Narcissa that he knew seemed further and further away. He knew that he should do something about it, but every time he tried to talk to her about it she just brushed it away telling him that everything was fine, and instead of arguing, he tried to believe her.
“My wife, yes,” Lucius answered, standing up. “But that was not my wife I sent  away.”
“Draco, dear.” Andromeda hugged him tightly at the door. “I’m glad you could make it. You shouldn’t be working during the Christmas holiday.” She shook her head at him.
“Ah, I see you’re finally awake! How are we feeling Mr. Malfoy?” He walked over to Draco, and smiled down at Harry. “Your boyfriend hasn’t left your side all week. Must be nice to have such a devoted partner.” The healer directed his smile to Draco instead.
Potter was standing in a corner, leaned against the wall, staring at him with eyes wide open. Draco stared at him in return, not knowing how he could save this situation.
“The ones that Harry does, they’re so funny,” Scorpius giggled.
“What?” Harry asked, confused. He was ready to go home, so whatever Ron had planned would have to happen another day.
“I wanted to see the fairies, I didn’t mean to stay up so late. I’m sorry, dad.” He snuggled closer to Draco.
Draco stopped and turned to Harry. “you must have! You dated the dragon-brother!”
“Yeah, about that...” Harry began.
The worst thing about it was that he knew Potter was right. His mother had been more and more agitated after every appointment, and she was more upset than helped by them, but Draco had hoped that they were doing something good for her and at least her appointments were an indication that it was something fixable, and he had wanted to live with that hope for a little bit longer.
“Come in,” drawled Lucius.
“I bet that if you tell her why, she would say yes. That woman is not subtle,” Harry laughed.
Draco went over to the fireplace and grabbed a hand of Floo powder. He turned towards Harry. “Thank you again, for last night.”
“Of course, the offer stands for as long as it’s needed.”
“Then who are you here for? I’m the only one left.”
“I wouldn’t have laughed,” Harry said a bit louder. “I would’ve liked that idea. I would’ve said yes.”
“Shut up, you git,” Draco said, punching Harry lightly on his shoulder, trying very hard not to smile, totally failing if Harry’s answering grin was anything to go by. “I’m not using the Ministry’s showers. Their soap is atrocious. It’s my shower or no shower,” he said, with as much false bravery he could muster. “And then we’ll eat at my place. I hate crowds.”
Potter’s face hardened, but before Potter could say anything Draco continued. “I don’t care that it’s muggle, Potter. What does it have to do with my mother?”
Harry took care of the cleaning charm and then draped the cover over both of them. Draco was almost asleep when Harry kissed him goodnight.
“I just thought I had more time,” Draco said, feeling tired.
Draco usually took the easy way out if he could, he knew that avoiding going to Andromedas’ was a safe way to ignore Harry and his feelings towards him. Winter was slowly turning into spring, and staying away from home and Andromeda became a habit that was easier to follow than to deal with this turmoil of emotions. His mother spent more and more time inside her chamber, and Draco only heard her in the nights when she was wandering around the corridors. He never went out and escorted her back to her room as he did before. He told himself that he stayed in his room so he wouldn’t startle her, but he knew he was only doing it for himself, trying to keep the old version of his mother in his head as long as he could. Scorpius had told Draco that being with the elves was fine but he missed his grandma and wondered why she didn’t want to spend time with him anymore. Draco had finally told him that Narcissa was sick, and it didn’t have anything to do with Scorpius, and that his mother probably wanted to spend as much time with Scorpius as she could, but not being able to express it herself. Scorpius took it surprisingly well, and when Draco was home he could see Scorpius sneaking into her room, but he himself was unable to follow.
