Slytherin should be adjusted.” Draco calmly sips his tea and pauses. “Where, dear Aunt, did you happen to see the painting?”
“You don’t have to worry about me,” Draco assured them. “I have trained and prepared for this very moment. As far as the work goes, I am
Harry threw up his hands and rolled his eyes at Malfoy’s smug smile and his smooth, stupid pink lips. “So I’m guessing we’re doing this again?”
things, I have no authority to stop you. But it is not my prerogative to police this patient, merely to heal him.”
Draco was too engrossed in the assessment to really appreciate the sincerity of Potter’s apology. It barely registered as he realised Potter’s injury was perhaps as mild as one could hope for considering he’d fallen from so high up.
Draco made it back to his office and collapsed behind his desk. He rarely felt the need to dose himself with stimulant elixirs, but Potter’s emotions had sunk into him. He’d had no idea they would be so powerful, and he could only guess how long their residual effects would last. Draco didn’t think he could shake them easily, and as it was the final hours of his double rotation, his own exhaustion was imminent. He unlocked the bottom drawer of his desk and pulled out a lemon flavoured
His old friend laughed and asked him a question just as the song changed abruptly. The new tune’s bass immediately became too overbearing for people across the table to hear each other, and eventually, they gave up trying to hold a conversation.
He had no idea Harry bought it. Back then, he’d been too embarrassed and insecure to do much of anything and had used a gallery attendant to be the middleman in all his art sales. He suddenly remembers Harry’s interview in the paper after the show. It had seemed like something done in passing, a coincidence that Harry Potter had gone to
It was late in the afternoon and Draco was getting ready to leave work. He’d had a short shift at the hospital, one of his new
“I know,” Potter interrupted. “But this will be fine in a matter of days. If I’d gone in and been processed, they’d bench me at work for another two weeks.”
Potter smiles and lets go. Draco swallows down his disappointment at the loss of contact and continues across the tree.
Draco places a hand to Potter’s stomach and shivers at the frigid contact. In his fantasies, their touches would burn him to his core. He blinks and wills any thought of them away, banished to the darker, deeper recesses of his mind. Blaise reaches up and unfastens Potter’s belt.
“You’re welcome, darling,” she smiled. She took her seat across the table and eyed him. “I have wanted to apologise to you for several days, but you were at work. I didn’t want to bother you. When you didn’t come home on Saturday, I realised you probably needed your space.” She cleared her throat. “So I want you to know that we don’t have to discuss it until you feel you are ready.”
Draco licks his lips and turns to gaze into Harry’s eyes. “Just another...one of many more to come?”
” and led her silvery magpie Patronus around the room, relishing in the spectacle of the feathered spell pulling Dark shadows of magic from the walls and ceiling. Spinnet was right behind her firing banishing spells, containment orifices, and advanced charms in quick succession, obliterating even the smallest wisp of darkness in the room. At one point, they stood back to back, turning this way and that, attacking any and all errant shadows of Dark magic with precision. He’d never seen two Curse-Breakers more in sync, anticipating each other and the threats in equal measure.
He practically flew through her sitting room and into the kitchen where the backdoor led to the garden. He passed the abandoned outdoor dining table, set up with a spread of food and drinks, and headed toward the large field behind the flower garden.
“I think it would have gone in another direction,” Potter smiles, and Draco can’t tear his eyes away from it. There’s something inspired in Potter’s expression as if he’s imagining the scene. His eyes seem to brighten at the thought and Draco’s left breathless.
Draco realised that his barriers, the things that kept him in control and kept him grounded in medicine, had somehow been broken down. He’d never hesitated to run tests before, and he certainly had never felt
Draco throws up a hand, halting the movement of hips to stop himself from coming right then. He wants Potter’s hands on him when he comes. He wants to be consumed in the fire. He's burning alive from it and he doesn't even care. Reaching out for Potter, Draco kisses his outstretched hand before sucking the fingers into his mouth.
On the one hand, he was thankful for the time to himself. He’d had an exhausting three days at the hospital and was eager to unwind and attempt a good night’s rest. While Pansy and Alicia’s work had cleared his bedroom of the malevolence from without, there was no easy set of spells or rituals to remove the darkness from within. The last few days, Draco had been plagued with vivid nightmares. It didn’t matter if he was in his own bed or getting an hour’s nap in an on-call room; the vivid and alarming images were waiting for him each time he closed his eyes.
“Wait,” Draco stops and tries to remember the room where he’d found the bag. He had already searched Ginny Weasley’s room, he recognised her broom next to the door. “That’s your bag?”
“Thank you for a delicious breakfast,” he smiled. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go pass out.”
on himself and the table. A bit miffed, he returned his wand back to his pocket and said, “I’ve been sleeping much better since they helped me.”
was what was most important above all else. It was his father’s voice that told him he was better than everyone else, that blood mattered, and the Malfoy’s deserved power and prestige. But it was Narcissa’s voice that always echoed Draco’s his mind, calmly reiterating that family was independent from everything else, it was strength and resilience and the only thing that mattered.
“Yeah, but I got to spend an afternoon talking to you about Phaeden Blanchfarx.” Potter smiles sheepishly. “No one will talk with me about those books. No one else really gets it.”
“You made me feel,” Draco starts, but he has to turn away. He can’t look at Harry. He can’t let him see his face. It feels like too much to bear his soul, he doesn’t think he could take Harry seeing the pain, the shame,
For all the years Lucius had steered him wrong, it had taken Draco almost the same amount of time to set himself back on course. His mind flashed back and forth between a mild rage and a childish apprehension that now he had no choice in the matter. He had to confront his issues with Lucius because surely his mother wouldn’t let the topic go unspoken and fester between them. He’d have to make a decision soon, even if that decision was a solemn continuance of the status quo. Everything would still be different. Knowing his mother was somewhere on the path to forgiving Lucius meant that Draco was even more alone in his enmity.
While Patil offered her company and council at St Mungo’s, Pansy and Blaise forcefully reinserted themselves into Draco’s life by showing up at the Manor unannounced several times a week. They stayed for tea, or for supper, or even to help clear the gardens of matured mandrakes with Narcissa on a balmy July afternoon. Sometimes when Draco was at the hospital, his friends would Floo over and entertain his mother with their news and antics.
In the quiet of their absence, he relaxes and settles in, claiming his spot on the window seat. The cabin is cozy enough, and he’ll admit the view is picturesque. Large, green trees and striking mountains, it’s quite the winter getaway. He can picture the others out there struggling to hike up through the snow. He brushes off the guilt at having left Blaise to picnic alone with them.
“Issues?” Draco eyed her. “Was your father in service of the Dark Lord?” He paused. “No? Didn’t think so.”
“I’ll say,” Harry agrees. He reaches for the bottle of wine and pours himself another glass. “I remember when I saw you at that first Battle of Hogwarts Remembrance feast. I barely recognised you.”
“I’m s-s-sorry, Auror Potter.” The intern sounded terrified. “But the Post-Op chart already has a copy in the permanent archive.”
He wants to be excited for Teddy, and perhaps on some level he is, but he’s also deeply scared for him. Draco thinks of himself when he was eleven, of his deepest thoughts and desires and how so much of the world and the war robbed him of normal things. He aches for Teddy when he thinks of their cobbled together family, of a boy who doesn’t have a father or a mother to steady or reassure him. But then Draco thinks of himself, his mother, and his aunt, and how they’ve loved Teddy and given him everything they possibly could. He tries not to think too much about Harry, and how he’s managed to insert himself into their makeshift family unit with his devotion to Teddy, his respect for their heritage, and his quiet appreciation of Draco’s art.
I’m afraid I require your help. I have a client that is afraid of snakes, and we’re trying exposure therapy. In case you don’t know what exposure therapy is, it is a very common and effective way of overcoming phobias, by exposing the client to the source of fear in increments. So, in this instance, we started out looking at pictures of snakes in our first session while there was a plastic snake on the table between us. We will move on to videos today and I’ll ask them to hold the plastic snake. Eventually, I would have them hold a real snake. We’re going to have to move on from pictures and videos to real snakes soon, if not next week, then the one after, and I have yet to find someone willing to work with me. I hope that you will be willing to leave our history behind and help me.
“I’m sure not everyone is like that, Harry,” Hermione said. “The people that were in our year in Hogwarts don’t care that you’re Harry Potter.”
He calls for Earl and sends him on his way after telling him to wait until Malfoy leaves his office if he is still there. He watches Earl fly out the window with the small parchment tied around his leg and a treat in his mouth.
“Smooth green snakes are one of the least aggressive breeds and in the face of a threat, they will almost always choose flight instead of fight. I can remove him from the carrier if you would like to take a closer look. He’s quite well behaved, so I should have no problem keeping him from moving much.” Harry turns to look at Malfoy for his approval once he’s done addressing Sky.
, forgetting that they were surrounded by muggles. It was 22:07, two hours and seven minutes after when they were supposed to meet. Harry bit his lip, worried, going through every single awful thing that might have happened to Draco in his head. He got up, apologizing to Joy, the old lady that owns the restaurant for having to leave while dismissing her questions of whether Draco was alright, trying to reassure her (and himself).
“I- I wasn’t!” Harry exclaimed, flustered, before composing himself. “It was a joke, Malfoy, don’t make shit up when you don’t know what you're talking about.”
“It was hard on him, Draco,” Hermione explained softly. “Facing dark magic day after day when his entire childhood was spent doing just that.”
What Harry sees instead, when he walks out the lift, is Malfoy leaning against the front counter, laughing softly with an older woman with grey curly hair and a kind face. His almost white hair is loose around his face, longer than it had been at Hogwarts but not long enough to resemble his father, and he’s wearing gold wire frame glasses. It catches Harry off-guard, despite him having seen Malfoy––albeit without the glasses––recently.
Draco lets out an involuntary moan when he just can’t take it anymore. He pushes up ever so slightly on his elbows, latching his lips onto Potter’s. They kiss fervently for what feels like ages before Potter pulls away, leaving their foreheads touching.
“I don’t… speak it in front of people much,” Potter says, not looking at Draco, and even though Draco can’t see Potter’s face, he can tell that Potter’s smile has faltered. “It still reminds people a lot of Voldemort; it used to remind
going well. For the rest of the break, Draco barely left his room, Harry suspected he had house elves bring him his food. Before Harry knew it, it was Christmas day, the second to last day of the break and he had yet to see Draco since the second/third day let alone kiss him.
“Well then, just remember that I’m only doing this now, here, because you couldn’t wait. So you can’t blame it on me,” Harry said before taking in a deep breath and locked his eyes with Draco’s. “Draco, I love you more than anything you know that, right?”
Draco’s last appointment ends ten minutes later than it’s supposed to, at 18:40, and not a minute too soon. Draco thinks that he’s about to suggest Mr and Mrs Huckabee get a divorce as couples counselling might actually just not be working for them. Once Mr and Mrs Huckabee have calmed down enough to go out in public, Draco slumps down onto the sofa he normally reserves for his clients and takes his wand out from the pocket of his trousers to summon the bottle of Firewhiskey he’s been craving since before noon.
charm that’s keeping him unconscious and we’re still working on healing the burn, but other than that, he doesn’t have any critical wounds,” Hermione said before adding. “The curse seems to have worked fast, Harry, we might not have been able to heal him had they brought him in a minute later. But they didn’t, and Draco is going to be fine. We’ve cast multiple cooling charms to stop the burning from continuing and patched up the parts of his lung that took the most damage. We’re going to be taking off the
Draco scoffed. “We were great partners, Potter. At least that’s what I thought. Sure we argued a lot about unnecessary things, but we had chemistry in the field,” he said before his tone turned bitter. “But you obviously thought otherwise, didn’t you? Seeing as you hated it,
Draco must make some kind of noise then because Potter whips around, eyes blown wide. Potter flushes, and Draco knows that his own face must look very similar to Potter’s rapidly reddening one. “I wanted this shower,” Draco explains––lies––trying to keep his eyes from wandering further down Potter’s body, “but I can see that it’s occupied so I’ll see you later, Potter.”
“N-no, I just, uh, hadn’t seen you around here before,” Harry stumbled through the sentence, making it sound more like a question than a statement.ik
“Hello, Lyra,” Harry said managing a small smile. “Care to keep me company while we wait for Draco?”
Harry rolls his eyes and considers not telling Malfoy at all and letting him wonder if Harry will show up or not until the last second just to spite him. He decides not to respond to Malfoy’s owl, choosing to lean back and watch some telly instead.
Upon careful consideration, I’ve come to the conclusion that it would be helpful for my client to hear about snakes from someone that actually knows about them and is passionate about them. Unfortunately, you are the only person. I know of that sort. I’ve already talked to my client and they have given me their consent about you potentially joining some of our sessions. Be advised, my client is a Muggle, as is my workplace so please be discreet if you have to use parseltongue during a session. I don’t know if my client would take kindly to a grown man hissing at a snake.
“Never you mind, Potter,” he says dismissively. “Let’s get to work, shall we?” Draco says, looking around for a place to drop off his satchel and suit jacket. He walks up to a counter that seems safe enough and puts everything down.
He finally gets to the building and greets the receptionist in the lobby before heading towards the lift.
“Yes, Pansy, I’ll be fine. Get going now, you’re going to miss the train.” With that Pansy and Blaise walked out the gates and Draco turned to Harry. “What are you still doing here, Potter?”
“I’m working with a client to help them overcome their ophidiophobia. They’re doing really well so far with the pictures, videos and plastic snakes but that hardly compares to being in the presence of a snake. So, anything that you think would be a step up from that, without being too far up from that would be useful.”
Should you accept, you will be compensated for your time by the clinic. You may phone in to discuss payment with the accounting department of Oak Counselling at 020 7946 0852 ext 413. Should you wish to speak to me about this you can reach me at 020 7946 0852 ext 356 in between 13:00 - 14:00. If it is just to accept or reject my offer you can just call the front desk at 020 7946 0852 and Adelaide will take a message. Please let me know of your decision by 19:00 tomorrow, April 13th. DO NOT send an owl back. I have appointments all day.
“I’m tired, Granger,” Draco sighed. “I come here for a chance to relax, have a quiet drink, and maybe chat with you. I don’t see it being a very relaxing environment with Saint Potter here.”
Draco stops listening to Lovegood and Potter babble about snakes, in favour of watching Potter and his muscular tanned arms as Nymph slithers down his arm and rests her head on his hand. Draco’s eyes follow as Potter absentmindedly strokes Nymph’s head with his thumb.
“I did,” Harry sighed. “It had to be cut short because the guy only wanted to hook up and I don’t want just that anymore. We’re almost thirty, ‘Mione, I want a real relationship. I want someone I can come home to, someone who isn’t half my height and covered in dirt.”
Potter leans in the slightest bit more, leaving barely any room between their lips. Draco registers it as a challenge. He’s normally not one to back away from a challenge but Potter’s so close and their breaths are mixing together and he can feel Potter’s arms next to his own keeping him from leaving—-not that Draco really wants to try to anyway. Potter is naked and wet and on top of him. He’s on top of Draco and he’s wet. And
“You’re already doing very well, so we can leave that for another day if you want Sky. This all needs to go at your pace. But two weeks ago you wouldn’t have been able to even be in the same room as Andie.”
“Stop being a git,” Harry said, laughing before turning more serious. “You scared me, Draco, I thought you might not…” Harry trailed off, not wanting to say that he was afraid of Draco not waking up.
Draco leans in even closer to whisper into his boyfriend’s ear. “I bet you’ll taste even sweeter than you normally do.”
“So that’s how I started speaking it again,” Potter confirms. “I’d quit the Aurors recently too, so a pet turned into a passion which eventually turned into a job.”
“Oh, but what if I get my filthy germs on you,” Harry teased as Draco stepped out of the floo. “Why do you even ask if you’re just gonna walk right in without waiting for an answer?”
"You said we could cut a part of it?" Draco says though it sounds more like a question than a statement like Draco meant for it to. "Nymph is a rather large snake, I don't think the full-sized skin would be a good idea for my client yet."
Hermione opened her mouth to respond but heard another customer come in and smiled apologetically instead. “I’m sorry Robards is a shit, Draco, but don’t take it out on Harry. Now, I have another customer so I’m afraid I’ve got to go.”
“Well, it’s bad luck if I don’t, isn’t it?” Harry said before meeting Draco’s lips, accompanied by a chorus of ‘finally’s from their friends.
“Malfoy needed someone that knew about and had access to snakes for a patient of his,” Potter explains. “So I just introduced him to Nymph. And then we got talking about tattoos and… yeah.”
he’s very much the only person that can help Draco with this. And it’s not even for personal reasons, is it? Draco’s doing this for his client, he needs
Harry groans, realizing he made a mistake with his choice of a younger snake. He wishes he went with Hestia, the four-year-old ring-necked snake, instead, seeing as she’s only a couple inches bigger than Andie.
Draco clears his throat and looks away for a second before locking eyes with Potter, and then staring pointedly at his wristwatch. “It’s getting rather late. I ought to get going, I believe you promised me a piece of snakeskin, Potter.”
Draco pouted, then opened his mouth to retaliate only to be cut off by Harry. “Besides,” Harry said first. “I didn’t complain when we went to dinner with Pansy and Blaise. If I can make an effort to get along with your friends, you can at least try with mine.”
“Thanks, that means a lot, I also think you’re an insufferable git,” Harry said, rolling his eyes before he took another sip of his rum and coke. “Hey, Malfoy, did you really think we were good partners?”
“Okay, okay, you’re right. But can we just walk over there? I really don’t want to shout like a mad man.”
Harry responds, keeping an eye on Malfoy to judge his discomfort at his use of parseltongue. Noting the way Malfoy is standing stiff and tall, faced away from Harry, he lowers his voice.
Potter hums in confirmation. “I have six,” he says. “You’ve seen the one on my lower arm, that one I got when I decided on this as a career path.” Potter gestures to the room they’re in before he continues. “This one,” he starts, pulling the hem of his shirt up and his dark muggle jeans down a few centimetres on his right side. Draco stares at the inked flesh Potter just revealed. It’s a bouquet of lilies, the stems disappearing under the hem of Potter’s trousers. Draco gets the overwhelming urge to reach out and touch the lines of the tattoo.
“Circe’s tits, Potter, have you never heard of boys pulling girls’ hair because they like them? I’ve been obsessed with you ever since first year, you nitwit, I just didn’t know why until fourth year when I-” Draco cut off abruptly, his face turning beet red. He cleared his throat before speaking again in a more calculated, dismissive tone. “Anyway, Potter, I guess I like you too, for some reason.”
Draco cleared his throat and acted as if he hadn’t said anything, but the blush that was creeping on his cheeks was proof that Harry and Hermione weren’t mistaken in what they heard. He put on a displeased expression - Hermione suspected he was faking it - and put his coat back down, on the counter this time. “Alright, Granger, I’ll stay for a drink,” he said, effectively changing the subject and sat on the barstool next to Harry’s. “I’ll just take the usual.”
. He’s no longer wearing the hideous round glasses with the thick plastic frames. They’re still round, but they have thin metal frames, making him look a lot more modern
“The saviour of Wizarding Britain, ladies and gentlemen, defeated by a child’s accidental magic,” Draco muses.
Harry laughed nervously, “Yeah, though I’m not sure this is the right setting for it,” he said with a sheepish smile.
that was now blinking, indicating the start of a new hour — 4 am. He took in his boyfriend’s more-pale-than-usual face and white blonde hair that was now a greyish blonde with dirt. Draco normally looked peaceful and elegant in his sleep but now he was neither.
Hermione laughed, putting on a fake guilty expression. “You got me! I’ve been slipping people potions from the day I started working here,” she said jokingly. “But shhh, if anyone found out I’d be fired,” she added with a wink.
“I’ve come to have a drink to ease my nerves, Potter, as I do quite frequently,” Draco said, in the most Draco Malfoy way that Hermione had seen him speak in a long time. “Is that a problem for you? You don’t think I’m up to something, do you?” he asked, raising a thin brow.
“This is my office, do try not to break anything,” Malfoy says, ignoring Harry’s apology, which Harry thinks is fair. Though despite his better judgment, he can’t keep his stupid mouth shut.
It started reasonably, re-hashing stuff Draco already knew but quickly turned dark. He talked about the return of the Dark Lord, being tricked into going to the Ministry last year, then Draco’s own assigned mission, patting his chest reassuringly as Draco stiffened before quickly moving on. He talked about stalking Draco, a confrontation in a bathroom, Snape covering for Draco and a war. He talked about camping and dangerous pieces of jewelry, Draco lying to save Potter and a battle where his own mother went against the Dark Lord.
Harry moaned and immediately opened to Draco’s explorations, leaning into the kiss and grabbing Draco’s robes again. He would never deny Draco.
“Potter where are Granger and the Weasel?” He looked around Potter's shoulder up and down the hallway. “We need to get you to McGonagall, or maybe Pomfrey would be better…”
No, this must be part of the prank. Or perhaps it was a prank on Potter? That would make much more sense. Some sort of charm making him do embarrassing things like hugging and crying on Draco. But it would be a rather mean-spirited prank. Not something he could see Potter’s friends doing. Not even those infernal Weasley twins would have done something like this…
Still somewhat in shock and not willing to risk angering this slightly insane Potter, Draco obediently followed. He’d keep Potter calm and convince him to go to Pomfrey on his own.
Draco and Harry separated for the first time in hours as Harry sat up and pulled out his wand. Draco tried not to think about how cold he suddenly felt without Harry snuggled up to his side.
Draco was becoming very concerned about Potter. Someone must have done something, or maybe the stress of the Dark Lord finally made him crack. But Potter wasn’t making much sense and what in Merlin’s name did he mean about loving
Draco’s eyes had been tracking across Harry’s tear-stained face but flicked up at that, making eye-contact in his shock.
Closing the door, Potter whipped out his wand. But before Draco could react and cast a shield, Potter turned away, casting locking and privacy wards.
Harry described his shock and horror at Draco’s death, his breakdown in the middle of Diagon and his screaming at the Order member. The Aurors had to arrest them both because Harry was flinging serious and deadly curses at the man in public. He wanted to hurt the man the way he was hurting and later wished he had simply killed him in retaliation. But Harry admitted that it was probably a good thing he didn’t because his fame might not have kept him out of prison if he had cast an unforgivable and he wouldn’t have been able to come back if he were in prison.
Harry jolted awake, breathing harshly, his heart beating a mile a minute and his body covered in cold sweat.
Harry Potter, angsty golden boy extraordinaire had just come barreling around the corner in ratty pajamas and barefoot. Potter spotted him and exultantly cried out “Draco!” before picking up speed and opening his arms.
At this point Harry was clinging to Draco’s robes and fighting off gasping sobs. Trembling horribly but determined to tell Draco everything.
He wanted to. Merlin, he was already referring to Potter as Harry in his head, and as horrible as parts of the story were, other parts were wonderful. If it were true, then Harry loved him. Beautiful, brave Harry loved
“It’s okay if you don’t right away though.” Harry looked away, clearly crushed by the very concept. “I’ll still protect you.”
“Potter… Harry. I want to believe you I really do.” Harry looked up with a sniffle. “But I need a bit of proof.”
Draco continued pacing the dark hallways, trying to silence his thoughts with the burning in his legs.
Draco needed to be sure though. He could try legilimency but he wasn’t all that good yet. So, it would have to be a vow. Hopefully, Harry wouldn’t be too offended by his need for proof.
Harry pulled back briefly, just far enough to make eye contact. “I’ll tell you everything, Draco. That way you’ll understand and maybe you’ll love me again.”
Draco didn’t have time to decide if he should hex the crazy idiot or not before Potter leapt at him, wrapping his arms around Draco’s neck and repeating “Draco, Draco, Draco, Draco…”
Draco stopped to pull out his wand. He’d hex whatever student thought this was a good time for pranking. But then his jaw dropped and he almost lost his grip on his wand.
Finally, Potter started on what he called ‘their beginning’. He talked about a trial, going back to school and enemies turned to friends to lovers, meeting by the lake secretly and sharing stories about their childhood.
Honestly, this was supposed to ‘redeem’ his family but what a load of shite. He was being set up to fail! Why’d the Dark Lord even bother marking him if he probably wasn’t going to last the year? Was it all just a convoluted way to punish his father?
But if he didn’t figure it out, who knows what the snake monster currently taking over his house might do.
He talked about secret crushes revealed and a secret relationship because of angry friends and a vindictive public. He talked about losing contact with the Weasel and distant letters with Granger. Comforting each other after nightmares and a townhouse in London they fixed up together. Four happy years where Harry became everything to Draco and Draco became everything to Harry.
“No! You’re not listening, Draco! Just-just come with me.” Potter spun around, taking Draco’s hand in the process and lead him to the nearest empty classroom.
Harry was so happy. He couldn’t remember the last time he was happy. Probably when Draco was last alive.
Draco was a mess. He’d decided to take a walk around Hogwarts despite the late hour (or was it early?) because he was freaking out inside. He’d been at Hogwarts for weeks already and he had no idea how he was going to fulfill the Dark Lord’s stupid, insane, impossible task.
Very soon, Draco was forced to wrap his arms around Potter and stumbled a bit in an effort to stay standing as the sobbing boy leant all his weight on him.
Harry described watching his love die, dropping cold down to the street and dragging Harry down with as they were still holding hands.
Harry said that was probably when he broke. He told Draco that he realized he was probably not very stable anymore but he was going to protect Draco this time around.
Then he heard the strangest sound. Almost like slapping, or more likely, flesh hitting the ground - feet? It was approaching rapidly.
“I’d do anything for you Draco, you are the only person in this time that I care about. Whatever you want to do from here on out, I’m with you. You want Voldemort to win? I’ll change sides. I’m sure I can convince the snake-man to forget about killing me with the knowledge I hold. You want Voldemort dead? I can make that happen. You want to run away to Australia? I’m with you. Just don’t leave me behind. Please. Even if you can’t love me, please, let me stay with you. Use me for my money or fame, I don’t really care. Just-“
Draco’s thinking short-circuited. Stumped by the anomaly in front of him and vaguely patting Potter on the back on auto-pilot. He was a gentleman with manners after all.
Draco was getting nervous now, Potter knew about the time he broke his mother’s heirloom vase and she’d cried but forgiven him. Potter knew about the first time he flew and broke his ankle, about how he loved all magical creatures when he was little and wanted to be a magizoologist until his father beat the idea out of him. But Draco couldn’t think on it too much, Potter was continuing.
“Har har, that’s hilarious, Draco. Look, can’t you just cast a Scourgify or something?” Harry asks huffing. “I don’t really wanna point my wand at my face when I can’t see.”
“Call me Harry,” Po- Harry says, just before meeting Draco’s lips once more. Draco thinks he might as well start calling Potter “Harry” if he’s going to keep snogging him. And really, Draco has no intention of stopping anytime soon.
though,” Potter says, swinging open the door to the bathroom and Draco’s jaw drops. Because Potter is standing at the door in all his naked glory. Drops of water are falling down his too long hair onto his sculpted chest, travelling down to his soft-but-still-quite-impressive-in-size cock and Draco can’t––doesn’t really want to either––look away from it.
Draco had opened his mouth to decline but paused. He’d instead opted to give a curt nod, letting Harry know it was okay to toss a packaged chocolate frog to Draco. Draco had grabbed it with the ghost of a smile on his face and murmured “Thanks, Potter.”
The latter was happening currently. Harry checked his watch — second anniversary present from Draco, because they’d once had to obliviate everyone in that very restaurant after Harry cast a
“Harry, he’s going to be alright, Healer Milner’s in there with him and his vitals were fine the last time I was in and if something had gone worse they would’ve alerted me,” Hermione said, as Harry brushed off the ashes on his muggle jeans.
Her eyes move towards the still lifted hem of Potter’s shirt. “Oh!” She says, her eyes widening. “Oh no, I’m not interrupting anything, am I?” Potter straightens his shirt out and Draco scrambles back, putting distance between himself and Potter.
I believe it is correct etiquette to respond to one’s owl, especially if it is to make plans involving that person.
“Oh, Merlin’s beard, Harry, tell us what you actually think of Draco, will you?” Hermione said, exasperatedly.
“I don’t know for sure, the Aurors that brought him in said that he got hit by a curse but it was cast wordlessly and we weren’t able to identify it. He’s unconscious now,” Hermione said before she was interrupted by a Healer trainee at her door.
Potter’s response comes with Cassiopeia before the hour is out. Potter’s speedy response makes Draco almost sure that what he’s about to read is a rejection because Potter can’t have agreed to work with Draco so quickly, right? Draco unties the small scroll of parchment from Cassiopeia’s leg with shaking hands and feeds Cassiopeia an owl treat as he works on unrolling the scroll with his other hand.
“You know, snakes used to remind me of Voldemort too,” he says, wincing. He walks to one of the armchairs and sets the carrier down on the side table before plopping down on the chair. Malfoy stays standing by the now closed door. “This isn’t really common knowledge but I used to get visions of what he was doing, sometimes through his eyes and sometimes through Nagini’s. To say it was unsettling would be a severe understatement.”
Thinking back on it, Draco had right to be confused because there was absolutely no logical reason for Harry to be there. Harry really should’ve thought this through more. “Uhh, just taking a walk. Thought I’d come say bye?”
Draco’s seen Potter’s arse many times—both before and after that day—but Merlin, he keeps thinking of how it looked that day. Every time he closes his eyes, he sees Potter’s bloody perfect arse with drops of water trailing down and disappearing in the crack. Bloody hell, Draco needs to get a grip.
Draco rewrites the letter, this time leaving out the parts that he struck out. He also decides to use his official name stamp along with this signature. He figures Potter might be more inclined to help if he sees that this isn’t some plot that Draco is devising but someone actually needing his professional help. He reads the letter through one more time and makes a couple of minor changes.
“Yes, Potter, would you rather I was in France with my mother, or perhaps in Azkaban with my father?” Draco sneered, walking away without waiting for Harry’s answer.
It was a slow night at the pub when Hermione saw Harry come in, his frustration clear on his face. “Hey, Harry,” she greeted him once he was close enough to hear. “I thought you had a date tonight.”
I told you not to send back an owl and you made your owl stalk me to my flat? Has no one ever taught you manners? I guess you were mostly timely with your call to Adelaide, though, so maybe someone taught you some manners.
to give potions to muggles. But she wasn’t hurting anybody; on the contrary, she was helping them. It wasn’t like anyone would actually find out either, as Hermione was pretty good at being discreet and kept all of her potions in her trusty little bag (that, of course, has an undetectable extension charm on it).
“The snake is here?” Draco asks, hesitating. Maybe he should have mentioned to Potter that he himself isn’t… fond of snakes. “I thought you kept the snakes at a reserve.”
“Hey wait, where are you going,” Harry said when Draco rushed away from Harry and the mistletoe. “Malfoy! It’s bad luck!” Harry called after Draco to no avail.
eyes. It’s been ages since the war, some of us would prefer to leave it in the past, thanks,” he says before muttering, “Merlin, I never should have contacted you,” under his breath.
With that, he turns on his heels and storms out of the store, and apparates home the moment he’s out the door.
Draco wants to say something—a snarky comment about how that’s probably the most action Potter’s ever got—but he can’t bring himself to look away from how Potter’s lips close around the quill-shaped sweet and his tongue wraps around it as if it’s…
Draco pulls Harry into their bedroom and pushes him onto their bed. He waves his hand dismissively towards the door, causing it to shut. “Let’s see if anywhere else is sweet and tingly.”
The first half of the session goes well enough, Harry thinks. Not that he’s exactly an authority on therapy. Although very obviously uncomfortable, they at least seem to be intrigued by Andie and interested in what Harry is saying about him. And Andie has been unexpectedly well behaved that Harry is considering actually giving him two extra spiders instead of one like he wanted, though he really shouldn’t be enabling his overeating.
Tuesday comes by quickly and before Harry knows it, he’s at the reserve, coaxing a 3-month-old smooth green snake named Andie into his carrier.
, and Merlin, it’s making Draco lose his mind. There’s also the fact that he keeps sauntering around their room half-naked—at best. It’s not even a month into the school year and Draco has seen much more of Potter’s chosen arse than he can handle. It is getting to the point where Draco thinks that Potter somehow found out that Draco’s gay and is doing this on purpose to
“Sorry to burst your bubble, Potter, but I’m pretty sure Greg doesn’t swing that way,” Draco joined their conversation. “Potter,” he gave a polite nod at Harry who was staring at Draco, apparently startled by his sudden appearance. “Hello, Granger,” he said, turning to Hermione.
“Harry! I didn’t know you’d still be here!” Luna Lovegood steps out of the Floo, brushing off excess Floo powder off her dark blue cargo pants. “I just stopped by because,” she starts before her eyes land on Draco. “Oh! Draco! You’re here too!”
Harry shot right up at the mention of his boyfriend in possible danger making Lyra meow her complaint and jump off the armchair. “Is he okay? What happened? How long has he been there? I’m coming through.”
Draco scrunches up his face in distaste. “We are in the middle of Diagon Alley, you absolute barbarian. I am not yelling across the street,” Draco says.
“Draco, is something wrong?” Potter says, bringing Draco out of his trance. “You’ve been staring for a while now.”
, his mind supplies, he doesn’t know if it’s ironic or just clever. Draco’s eyes move down Potter’s body before he can stop them. Potter’s wearing a loose olive green shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. He has a tattoo of a snake wrapping itself around his left forearm. Draco’s eyes move lower to Potter’s legs clad in black denim.
“Good morning, Draco,” Adelaide, the receptionist for the clinic, greets warmly as soon as he steps off the lift and into their office.
Hermione nodded, more amused than afraid of Draco’s threat. It wouldn’t be amazing for business that she had to stop using potions but that was alright, this was worth it.
Harry woke up to the sound of someone calling his name. “Draco? Are you back?” He mumbled sleepily, trying to feel the area around him for his glasses before realizing that he never took them off.
Hermione knew better than to say that it wasn’t exactly the same thing. “You do realize that you can quit being an Auror if it doesn’t make you happy, right?”
Bloody Hell, why do insults no longer come to him naturally? The worst part in all this is that Potter actually seems
Harry was this close to giving up on it - the mistletoe wouldn’t be around for much longer and Draco was in hiding. Harry sighed, barely paying attention to his surroundings as he made his way up to the owlery. The Weasley’s would never forgive him if he didn’t write to them on Christmas; Mrs. Weasley was already mad at Ron, Harry and Hermione for staying at Hogwarts over Christmas.
The trainee nodded at Hermione and then at Harry not looking either in the eye, before slipping away.
Without his blessing, Draco’s eyes move to Potter’s lips and fix on the little silver hoop that fits perfectly on the curve of Potter’s bottom lip. Draco then finds himself wondering what it would be like to kiss Potter and toy with the jewellery with his tongue. He forces his eyes back up Potter’s face and tries to subtly clear his throat to ask the only thing not related to Potter’s lips that comes to his mind. “Tattoos?”
The thought is distracting enough that Draco fails to notice how Potter’s eyes are no longer fixed on his Advanced Transfigurations book but on Draco instead.
seemed to be working. Until one day Harry offered Draco a chocolate frog, not actually expecting anything to come out of it.
Taking another––larger–– sip of the Firewhiskey, Draco summons some paper and his pen from his desk and leans over the table to write his response.
“Hey, there’s Luna and Ginny,” Harry croaks out. His voice is in an even worse condition than it was yesterday. He’s been living on Pepper-Up Potion for the last three days but it hasn’t been doing much against Harry’s cold. “Can you call them over? I don’t think they saw us.”
Sky hums, deliberating. “Could I say yes now and contact you a day or two before if I chicken out and ask for more videos?” they ask, giving Draco a sheepish smile.
fine just having his weekly Friday lunches with Pansy, sometimes even at Diagon––under a glamour, of course––and his Sunday brunches with mother. Greg writes from France sometimes, he still gets
echoing in his mind. Because regardless of whether Potter qualified as an associate, Draco is indeed going to be meeting him. Today.
“Not so fast, Potter,” Draco caught Harry’s arm before he could leave, smirking at him. “I’m not nearly done with you.” Harry’s mouth fell open in an “o” as Draco pulled him back onto the stool. “Now, Granger, did I make myself clear?”
Draco latches his lips onto Harry’s candy-coated neck and Harry shivers, his eyes fluttering shut. Draco hums against Harry’s neck as he trails his lips up to Harry’s, leaving kisses in his wake. He kisses Harry hard on the mouth and then leans back just far enough to be able to speak. “You taste like fucking Fizzing Whizzbees,” Draco whispers against Harry’s lips, before pulling Harry back into a kiss. “It’s making my mouth all tingly.” It’s all passion and lust and trying to make up for the week of no sex.
“Wait, um, I go on my lunch break right after I’m done with Sky here, we could grab lunch together if you wouldn’t mind waiting,” Draco offers with a pinkish hue to his cheeks.
Didn’t know you cared about proper etiquette, Potter. Actually, I don’t believe I ever even heard the word etiquette come out of your mouth.
At this, Harry looks up at Malfoy, immediately meeting his gaze. “Can I let him out? He’s a lot more likely to behave if he’s not annoyed.”
Hermione tried not to smile at Draco’s ‘secretive’ way of asking about her friend. Draco would never admit it, but it was very obvious to Hermione that Draco was absolutely infatuated with her friend. Hermione had a hunch that Draco’s feelings weren’t one-sided as Harry had always been kind of obsessed with Draco. But the two never spent more than a minute in each other’s company. Even now, nearly a decade after the war, they still pretended that they couldn’t stand each other despite being a lot more civil than they had been at Hogwarts. “Harry’s doing alright, he’s busy with the kids as usual.”
“Malfoy,” Potter replies coolly, giving Draco a smile that makes Draco feel queasy. Potter walks over to Draco in slow, confident strides. Now that Potter is closer, Draco can make out the details of his face.
“Draco, I’m fine,” Potter says, and despite the warm, soothing water, Draco’s entire heart freezes at the sound of his name on Potter’s lips. “Really, I actually feel quite normal. It’s just sometimes…” He trails off and just stares at Draco.
Potter frowns and furrows his eyebrows. “I wanted to stay at the cabin in the first place. I only went on the hike—look, what are we even talking about?”
When their mouths crashed together, all Harry could think about was the glorious sensation of finally knowing what Malfoy’s lips tasted like. It was frantic and warm and both their tongues pushed into each other’s mouths with searing need. Harry didn’t register that Malfoy’s hands had lifted his robes up until a hand shoved his pants down and careful fingers started stroking his throbbing cock.
He briefly considered the situation Andromeda must have been in, what with Teddy standing by and Potter refusing to go to the hospital.
Blinking, Draco pulled himself from the wall and grabbed an O.R. kit. “Male in his late twenties presenting with a massive hemothorax and an unknown combination of spell damage to the chest.” He went through the pre-op motions while he tried to calm his rapidly accelerating heart rate. He turned toward Patil, his mind flooding with memories and unspoken words and questions. “I —” he started but stopped when she brushed past him to enter the O.R..
You saw me, my truth, before I could even think of myself that way.” He takes a shaky breath and continues, “It angered me that you knew me so well. I wanted to return the favour, to show you, and everyone else, who you truly were. But I — I could never quite get you right. It always felt as if there was a detail missing or…” Draco stops. “I realised I could never really recreate how I feel about you.”
But not long after he’d sent out his last application, an owl arrived from the Board of Directors at St Mungo’s asking him to fill the vacancy of Healer-in-Charge of the Trauma Ward.
“Yes, hello,” Draco said, eyeing him warily. He didn’t recognise him, not that he’d known anyone other than Mr Borgin. “I’m sorry, I don’t think we’ve met. I’m Draco Malfoy.”
“You know,” Draco straightens and looks back at the ceiling. “If you really loved me, you would have voted for Greece.”
“No, not so much,” Malfoy replied, eyes practically glowing as he added, “But I do have quite a lot of experience seeking booty.”
Draco snorts and absently wonders how much space he takes up in the parts Potter doesn’t like. “Do you find yourself discussing ‘the fall of Pureblood idealism’ often in your sitting room?”
“Salazar, who let this man back in the field?” He shook his head and returned the chart to the nurse.
Draco lets go of the sheets, lifting his hands to cup Potter’s jaw. “Keep going,” he whispers as the slide of his cock pushes in and passes the point of pleasure or pain, oscillating between the two in the most addictive sensation Draco has ever known.
Draco padded down the hall and found the owl eagerly waiting for him with its talon stretched out. Grabbing Blaise’s reply, Draco offered Ophiuchus a treat with his other hand. “Thanks, Ophi.”
“Coffee?” she offered as she peered around at the empty room. She stepped into his office and gave him a slight smile. “A bit of a pick-me-up before we go check on the patient?”
Draco flipped through the E.A.R. log as he sipped his drink, a bit miffed that the patients’ names had been entered in shorthand. It appeared to be their initials. He could, however, tell that some seemed to find themselves in the Trauma Ward far more often than others, the prevailing names being
Weasley stepped onto the worn front steps. “It’s actually the Black residence.” He cast a silent charm on the battered front door and it creaked open immediately.
“No?” Draco searches Potter’s face and finds a hint of amusement in his upturned lips. He stares a little too long at them and gulps, looking away. “What then?”
with Head Auror Potter…” Draco smirked. He closed the door and walked back up to Harry. “Quite the dream come true.”
When he opened his eyes, she had retreated back to the kitchen. He took a deep breath and found Ophiuchus on his usual perch. He offered him a treat and tied the parchment around his leg. “Be a good boy and take that to Blaise, please.” The old owl bowed its head and pushed off, disappearing through the owl entrance chimney and leaving Draco with no more excuses. He had to talk with his mother.
After spending most of his week finishing up the Auror Department’s yearly expenditure report, Harry had planned on taking a long weekend to the south coast. Alone. His latest gift from Hermione, the bestselling page-turner
,” Draco pointed around the room. “Cannot be explained away so easily.” He remembered Potter’s exhaustion, his extensive history of injury, and his somewhat licentious reputation. The sudden memory of Potter’s dancing at the club sparked something hot under Draco’s skin, so he straightened his posture and took a step toward Weasley. “There is a root cause, to be sure,” Draco said. “But there are other factors to consider.”
incident, all major MLE taskforces apply the Space Time Accuracy Receptor spell to every crime scene. And unfortunately, these pirates are very much from our own time.”
For all its history and notoriety as the residence of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, 12 Grimmauld Place soon becomes
“You were shouting so loudly, I could hear you all the way in the cantina.” Draco took a long look at Potter’s face while he was staring at the floor between his bed and where Draco stood. The man had been incensed, and Draco wanted to know why. “I won’t redact anything from my reports,” he explained.
It was a rush of various things after that as Draco tried to get his other cases covered, because, for whatever reason, he felt obligated to take on Potter’s case himself. He went back to his office to get a moment to steady himself, but after he sat down and closed his eyes, all he could see was Potter standing in front him, all distractions and disappointment, saying, “
Two hours later, Draco stands in the grand foyer of the Black family residence after taking off his cloak, keenly aware that it’s the first time in over a decade that he’s been alone in a room with Harry Potter. Once he gets over that fact, it’s polite inquiries and awkward pauses and before he knows it, he’s upstairs peeling away the drop cloths from half a dozen frames and inspecting the canvases.
He ends up sitting beside Lovegood and having a lovely conversation about arctic hobblesnicks and how to properly harvest their horns for the treatment of stomach maladies.
“Oh, Merlin,” Potter groans and Draco’s cock twitches. Sighing, Potter says, “It feels amazing in here.”
“I think you’re a lunatic,” Draco starts. He takes a tentative step forward. “I think the fact that you want to court a former Death Eater makes you a glutton for punishment.” Potter starts to say something but Draco takes another step forward and cuts him off. “I think your stupid face is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. I think I hate you for all the ridiculous, courageous things you’ve ever done. But I think—” Draco closes his eyes. “I think about you all the time—drinking tea, eating noodles, going to the shops.” He opens his eyes and meets Potters stare. “I think about you kissing me, running your hands through my hair,  fucking me senseless against my workbench. I think about your voice—”
Potter’s words wounded Draco like a blade to the gut, twisting and turning and clawing through him until he felt stone cold and frozen. Potter made a habit of wounding him this way. He stared back, unable to blink, unsure if he could even move. He suddenly felt eleven again, drowning in disappointment, insecurity, and resentment. Draco felt it all coil up inside him until it almost became too much and his lip quivered, itching to turn into a familiar sneer, ready to slice Potter up with his own returned sentiments.
“It seems a bit depressing,” Longbottom added when Harry signed the paperwork and transferred the funds.
Every step toward Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes felt heavier than the last. Each foot forward was a betrayal, leading him to his ultimate demise. It was a particularly lovely autumn day, crisp and breezy, and yet Draco was sweating underneath his cloak and robes.
“If he’s not here, he’s probably lying in a bed at St Mungo’s,” Theo laughed. “Don’t you know? He takes home a different person every night.”
“Try doing anything in there other than sitting in one of those oversized armchairs brooding in the shadows,” Harry says.
When he entered the room, Intern Masker was setting up the Vitals Charm and had another intern working on some of the deeper cuts on Potter’s arms. A few of them appeared to be quite deep, and Draco realised Potter must have broken something sharp, perhaps a mirror or a glass table. He advised the intern to watch out for pieces of glass, and then stepped up to the other side of the bed and stared down at Potter.
You can perhaps understand that my hands have been busy attempting to rid the place of the dark magic and curses left to fester for the last decade. I am neither prepared nor qualified to expunge or cast out such magic, and having spent the last five days there, I am uncertain if I even want to try.” He inhaled and continued, “I can hardly tell if it’s me that doesn’t want to live there or if it’s merely a conscious effort of the Manor pressing me to leave. Either way, between
“For fuck’s sake,” he breathes and whispers the spell. At this rate, he needs to learn it wandlessly and silently if he’s ever going to function around Potter again.
By the time Draco comes back to the moment, Harry’s pulling out of him and gently flipping them over. He leans down and gives Draco a tender kiss, one hand caressing Draco’s shoulder and the other furiously stroking his own cock.
He says it so casually that Draco thinks he might explode at the revelation. Potter puts the bottle to his lips and throws it back, drinking the contents and wincing as the steam begins to come out of his ears. Draco downs the rest of his tea and stands up. He’s not sure what he’s supposed to do with this new information—new to him, at least. He’s not sure it changes anything except perhaps makes his fantasies a little less objectionable. So what if Potter and the Weaselette were broken up? It didn’t change the facts. It enforces them. Potter will never want Draco the way he wants him, and it’s useless to find hope in the new information.
So Draco, not getting the memo about stopping, walks into Potter’s back. The collision catches him so off-guard that Draco almost falls on his arse but instinctively grabs Potter’s shoulder. Once he’s stable, Draco remembers his hand that’s currently squeezing Potter. He pulls his hand off as if it burns.
Getting from the apparition point to the clinic proves to be harder than Harry thought it would be. The streets are much too crowded for this time of the day and people are either paying so little attention to him that they just about knock Andie out from Harry’s hand or staring and pointing.
Sky grabs their purse and flashes Draco another smile, before bidding him goodbye and leaving Draco alone with the words,
“I should put Andie back,” he says, to fill the not-so-comfortable silence, after a while of them standing by Draco’s desk, sipping at their tea.
Harry thought. The only thing giving Harry comfort and telling him that Draco was, in fact, not dead was the rise and fall of his chest.
Deep in thought, Harry didn’t realize anyone else was on the staircase until he walked right into them “Sorry!” Harry said reflexively before looking to see who he’d crashed into. “Oh, sorry, D- Malfoy.” Draco’d stopped being Malfoy in Harry’s head a long time ago, but he did not know that.
“I know, Harry, I did hear you, you know, when you spoke to me. Granted I don’t remember most of what you said but I did hear you,” Draco said softly before his tone turned teasing. “Though I’m not sure anyone could remember a lot of what you said with your rambling, unconscious or not.”
Harry’s breath hitches. Teddy has been staying over at Harry and Draco’s for the last couple days while Andromeda visits Narcissa in France. And ever since Teddy walked in on Harry with his cock up Draco’s arse after having had a nightmare, three years ago—being five at the time, Teddy didn’t really understand what was happening, thank Merlin, but it had scarred Harry and Draco for life—they’d vowed never to have sex when Teddy was in the house. And now that Teddy was no longer in the house…
Potter raises his hand and waves it once, murmuring the incantation. A fluffy white towel comes flying into Potter’s hands. He uses it to wipe his face and rubs it at his hair carelessly, not bothering to cover himself. Meanwhile, Draco is still gawking at the Chosen Prick.
Everyone was silent for a beat and Harry silently cursed himself for ever thinking this was a good idea. “Right,” Pansy said turning to Draco. “We have to be going, darling, but we’ll see you after break. You’re absolutely sure you don’t want to spend Christmas with me and father?”
No one expected Hermione Jean Granger, brightest witch of her age, to become a bartender after Hogwarts. Yet she had done just that, at a Muggle pub nonetheless. Now, she was one of the most well-known bartenders in London. She did, however, have a secret to her success that she wouldn’t let anyone else know. She slipped potions into almost every customer’s drink, depending on her customers’ needs. So, okay, it wasn’t completely legal to give people potions when they didn’t know, and it was
“I believe so, but I will check that for you right away,” she says, typing away at the computer. “Your appointment with Mx Hadley is at eleven o’clock. And your one o’clock has cancelled.”
Draco practically runs out of the showers. He doesn’t slow down until he gets to his shared room with Potter. And if he’s caught a glance of The Saviours cock before running out, he tries not to think about it.
“It seems that our time is up, Sky. We made a lot of progress today. For our next session, you have two options, we can either continue with more videos or, if you’re feeling ready, I can ask my… associate to bring over something more real or realistic,” Draco says, hoping that Sky didn’t notice his hesitation at the word associate. Is that what Potter is to him now?
, he thought looking at his watch that showed that it was nearing 3 am the next day. He couldn’t lose Draco, not now, not ever but especially not now.
Come over to the shop when you can so we can discuss which snakes would be the best to have at your sessions.
Draco took a sip from his drink and then another, letting Harry’s words register. Before he could form a response, Harry was talking again. “Did… you hate me?” Harry said, hesitant.
charm on the wall showed 07:16, not that Harry could see it. Harry felt for his glasses on the nightstand next to Draco’s hospital bed and put them on, taking in his surroundings. He looked over at Draco to see if he was awake, hoping that he was awake.
“I was trying to impress you, you prick!” Draco yelled, his words only registering a couple seconds after he’d said them. “I don’t know why I said that. Why would I want to impress you, I wasn- I wasn’t-” Draco’s brows furrowed when he couldn’t say what he was trying to. That was odd, it had felt like he physically couldn’t get the words out of his mouth. That only happened when- “Granger! I can’t believe you would do something like this!”
Harry scowled at Draco and opened his mouth to retort but Hermione didn’t let him. “You are both adults! You’re my friends, not to mention former Auror partners. So stop acting like children, bloody grow up and be civil with each other, will you?”
I wouldn’t have pegged you for someone that watched the window waiting on a response. Not from me at least.
Alas, Draco was not awake, or at least he didn’t look it even if he was. Harry let out a sigh and put his head in his hands, rubbing at his temple.
is why Slytherin almost always lost against Gryffindor: because Draco couldn’t be a functional human being when Potter was in Quidditch gear.
“Why? Did he get worse? Is he awake?” Harry walked towards the trainee making her take a step back, intimidated and surprised by the sudden outburst.
Harry wonders why he had to choose the sassiest animals on earth as a career. Why not owls, or crups, or even kneazles?
“I see you still like to snoop, Potter.” Malfoy fixes Harry with a subtle glare, though Harry thinks he looks a little silly because his glasses are sitting low on his nose and his white-blond hair is in his face, so the glare is probably not as effective as Malfoy would like.
Harry let out a weak laugh. “I’m rambling, aren’t I? You would’ve probably shut me up by now, if you weren’t…” Harry sighed. “You know. Anyway, Hermione told me to get some sleep but I really don’t know how I can. I just, I almost lost you. I really thought for a while there, waiting for Hermione to come out of your operation room, that I might actually lose you. Draco, I knew before this that I loved you and I’m not gonna be cliché and say that I can’t live without you because, well, that’s a lie; I’m pretty sure I could, if I tried but Draco, I wouldn’t want to live without you.”
Potter smirks at that and puts Nymph on one of the nearby counters before responding. “Tattoos, actually,” Potter says. “And believe it or not I got the snakebite before I started handling any snakes.”
in Azkaban over being here with Potter. It isn’t that Potter is being hostile towards him or anything;
Draco muttered an incantation, pointing his wand in the air between him and Harry. “What are you…” Harry started, stopping as he saw the festive plant appear above their heads. “Mistletoe?” Harry asked, his heart thumping so loud he was sure Draco could hear it.
Draco’s eyes widen as he realizes what exactly he’s said. “I-I mean, put some clothes on, Potter, you’re highly indecent.”
You would think that after 5 years of dating an Auror, Harry would be used to it. Well, that wasn’t at all the case. It was still as hard as the first, the fiftieth time he got an owl from Draco saying he needed to cancel their date because he was busy with a case that was time sensitive and he was terribly sorry. It was still hard when he had to sit in an eerily silent and too clean hallway at St. Mungo’s waiting for someone, anyone, to tell him that Draco was okay. It was hard waiting alone at the tiny muggle family restaurant where they usually meet after work on Fridays for two hours without so much as an owl telling him that Draco was safe and would be back at Grimmauld Place (in which they practically lived together, though not officially) as usual when he was done with whatever case he was working on at the moment.
Draco hummed in confirmation while Harry stared at him in surprise. “It’s not even Christmas, Draco,” Harry mumbled, not knowing what else to say.
There was mistletoe on top of the couch in the common room, all he had to do was get Draco to sit on the couch with him. Which would prove to be a lot easier said than done.
“Oh, come on, I had to do something to make you two stop acting like a couple of idiots. You weren’t gonna get anywhere if I left you two to your own devices,” Hermione said, putting her hands up in front of her chest towards Harry and Draco in a way of shielding her from them.
“I figured you might be, Sky’s appointment is not until half-past. I can show you my office if you follow me, and you can set up anything you need to.”
This is the other thing, it feels so out of the ordinary to see Malfoy being so nice and encouraging with anyone, let alone a muggle. Harry knows he should’ve been expecting it, this is his
“Good *achoo* morning,” Harry said when he walked into the room he shared with Draco. He made his way over to Draco and set the tea he got for him on his desk.
“So, you kept an eight-year-old kid from having some sweets and he made them explode on your face,” Draco says, very obviously amused. “Where is he right now then?”
“I like being an Auror just fine, Granger. At least I did when they gave me actual cases while I was Potter’s partner. I don’t hate being an Auror, Granger, I’m just saying they aren’t allowing me to
Potter steps to the side and turns part-way towards Draco, revealing a rather large snake that is red white and orange striped. Unable to stop himself, Draco jumps a little.
“Very good, Sky,” Malfoy says, before turning to Harry. “P- Harry, uh we have about 20 minutes left in our session, so you are free to go at this point, as I would like to finish up with Sky privately.”
delivered every day even though it’s a load of bollocks and he’s been allowed to do magic since three years after the war ended. He has a good routine going. Except now he’s certain that he’s going to ruin it.
“Why did you say you had to stop by, Luna?” Potter says, picking Nymph up from the counter and placing her on his shoulder. The colour of the reptile somehow both clashing against and complementing Potter’s green shirt.
About two months later, Draco and Harry were almost friends. Harry didn’t know what had changed but obviously something had. They’d gotten into the habit of studying together; along with Ron, Hermione, Pansy and Blaise. That evening when they were all studying in the common room, Draco put his quill down and looked at Harry.
“I’m up, I’m up! Stop screaming. What happened, do you need me there?” Harry said sitting up straight on the couch and grabbed around for his glasses. Draco’s face was sticking out of the green fire.
“Curious, Malfoy?” Harry asked with a raised brow before responding. “I was just telling Hermione that I can’t date in the Wizarding World because everyone sees me as Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort, and I want to be seen as Harry, just Harry. Hermione said that our old classmates wouldn’t care that I’m Harry Potter. And that’s when I joked about Goyle and yeah, you were here for the rest.”
Draco walks into the showers after the “friendly” game of Quidditch between the eighth years —they aren’t allowed on the house teams because they’re not actually
themselves in the communal showers, right? Another moan cuts through the silence and Draco turns toward the source of the sound because it sounds familiar. He walks silently to the last stall, where he sees the Chosen Arse yet again.
his glasses wandless, or at least start doing that in the loo before leaving the station. But right now his wand is buried deep in his satchel, and his hands are full and he’s just going to have to deal with having water on his lenses for the next 2 blocks.
Half an hour later, Harry’s already called the number Malfoy gave him for the reception, chatted with a kind lady named Adelaide who told him Mr Malfoy had been waiting for Harry to call and that she was glad Harry did call because she hadn’t seen Draco that anxious since he first applied to intern there. With that done, and his ‘deadline’ already passed, Harry decides to write Malfoy a letter and apologize for any inconvenience the delay in Harry’s response might have caused him.
Sky leans in closer to leave about half a metre between them and Harry. “He kind of has a derpy look to him, doesn’t he? Like his eyes are too big and round for how slender he is.”
He turns around with a flourish and heads to the dark oak door that says “D. MALFOY, PSYCHOLOGIST” in crisp gold lettering. Upon opening the door, he finds Cassiopeia, his barn owl standing on the side of his desk.
This makes Malfoy snap his head up to look at Harry with disbelief and pain. “Would you kindly fucking stop, Potter? I would really rather not hear about you seeing me being forced to torture people or whatever horrible things you saw through
Harry felt Draco’s hand twitch and looked up at Draco’s face to see if maybe whatever charm they used to keep Draco unconscious was wearing off. Harry was half expecting to see Draco awake and rolling his eyes at Harry for being sappy. He wasn’t awake or rolling his eyes at Harry. He was just as unconscious as he was ten minutes ago.
“I did wait for an answer Potter, you didn’t give me one fast enough,” Draco said setting the takeout boxes on the TV table in front of Harry. “I got you chicken noodle soup.”
He takes his glasses off carefully placing them on the table by the sofa. He takes a long swig of the Firewhiskey, the liquid burning his throat on his way to Draco’s stomach. An owl flies in through the open window and lands by Draco’s head. Draco thinks it’s Cassiopeia first, then remembers that he sent her back home for the day. Draco turns his head slightly towards the bird, noting that it’s a gorgeous grey spotted owl, to see a scroll identical to the one from Potter this morning tied to its leg. Draco unties the scroll with a groan. The owl looks at Draco incredulously as Draco unfurls the parchment.
He gets off the train, holding out his arms to avoid any of his coffee spilling onto his suit. He steps outside the station, and his glasses are immediately littered with raindrops, blocking his view just enough to be a nuisance. He really should learn how to
His glasses aren’t dissimilar to Draco’s own, Draco notes, Draco’s are just less round. He has more scars now too. There’s another one on his forehead, near the famous lightning bolt. It’s an old one, lighter than the skin around it. There are smaller ones all around his face, but they’re only really noticeable when you pay attention. He also has a piercing on his eyebrow, and another on his bottom lip.
charm on the wall of Draco’s room blankly. Hermione had left a couple minutes ago but not before telling Harry to get some sleep. She was only called in because it was Draco and she was listed as one of Draco’s usual Healers, her shift at St. Mungo’s had actually ended at 8 pm today.
When Nymph doesn’t respond, Harry urges Nymph further along his shoulder and out of his face. He walks out front with a sigh and taps the ‘Open, come on in!’ sign on the door, changing it to ‘Sorry, we’re closed!’. He puts the wards back up with a flick of his wand before walking to the back room to Floo back home.
Now, 10 years later, when Draco came home from work with the tiny crinkle between his brows, Harry would summon a chocolate frog from their emergency stash in the kitchen and shove it in Draco’s hands. He’d lean in to kiss his boyfriend on the cheek before whispering “I’ll go run you a bath.”
“I… I, um, Imight’vehadatee-HUGEcrushonhimandnowitmightberesurfacing,” Harry said, letting out a breath.
“Ah, of course, Saint Potter with his orphanage.” Draco sneered halfheartedly, downing the rest of his drink and pushing the glass towards Hermione. “You know, The DMLE never was the same after he decided he was too good for the Aurors. Maybe if he hadn’t left to look after a bunch of children,
Flying against Potter had always been a thrill but that was never because Draco was thirsting over Potter. That is, until now. Draco wonders how he ever survived games against Gryffindor—
like Luna, Draco. You never even tried with Ginny. How do you know you don’t like her when you haven’t made an effort?”
“Thank you, Adelaide. I’ll be in my office, should you need me for anything. Although I do have some work I need to get done so please see to it that I don’t get disturbed unless absolutely necessary.”
Draco drops his quill and rubs at his temples, as if that would help get rid of the mental image of Potter and his Chosen Arse. He stands up from his desk and starts pacing the room.
“Aww, you *achoo* sound like you *achoo* actually care.” Harry said, his tone teasing despite the sneezing.
“Don’t worry, Malfoy, she’s only a git to people she already knows, so you have nothing to worry about now.”
“Yes,” Draco said and continued before Harry could express his excitement. “But you can’t have any before you finish your soup.”
Christmas time was always beautiful at Hogwarts and a lot of the eighth year students had decided to stay there over break because it would be their last Christmas at Hogwarts. This year was different for Harry though, this year he was on a mission (one that didn’t involve evil wizards -well, it didn’t involve ones as evil as the ones he’d dealt with before). This year, he would kiss Draco Malfoy.
“I do,” Potter confirms. “But Nymph lives with me. She goes wherever I go unless I absolutely need to leave her home.” With that Potter turns around and heads toward the back of the store where it’s sectioned off with a black curtain.
“You do realize that this is illegal don’t you, Granger? I should arrest you right this second!” Draco said, leaning over the counter towards Hermione.
“Why is it that you always assume that I’ve done something?” Harry retorts, taking off his red-stained glasses and setting them on Draco’s desk. Draco throws the glasses a look of distaste and wordlessly
“Of course,” Draco says with a comforting smile. “I’m meeting my associate today, so I will contact you as soon as I know what exactly ‘something more real’ means. In the meantime, if you do go to your girlfriend’s house, remember that a snake in a glass tank can only hurt you as much as a picture or a video can.”
they ask you for it. Veritaserum is completely off limits. If I hear anything about you practically drugging people without their knowledge again, I will personally arrest you.” Draco said in an authoritative voice.
Draco lets out a sigh, depositing his satchel, coffee cup and glasses on the desk. He shrugs off his coat and sits down, putting his head in his hands. He needs someone that knows about snakes and can provide snakes for his sessions with Sky. And no magical herpetologist or snake breeder in the UK was willing to work with him. Most of them hadn’t bothered to respond to his owl and the ones that did… Well, they had less than kind words to say. He was his last hope. Letting out a deep breath, he sits up straighter and picks up a sheet of paper from his desk drawer. Picking out his favourite fountain pen, he begins to write.
“Nymph is quite large, so naturally, the shed skin is also going to be quite large. Double her size, actually. It’s fascinating when you think of it because the shed skin covers the top and bottom of each scale–” he cuts himself off and Draco thinks he sees a faint blush forming on Potter’s cheek. “Sorry, you probably don’t care all that much. Anyway, I don’t see why we can’t cut up a section of it. And I can show you the skin, and Nymph herself, if you want to follow me to the back.”
Harry laughed, shaking his head before continuing as if Draco didn’t say anything. “Well, I do, love you. And it’s still mind-blowing to me how we’re like this now, happy and in love when we were how we were at Hogwarts. I just sit and think about how far we’ve come and it’s been over five years, Draco, but I still don’t believe it sometimes.”
would require my assistance again.” The name doesn’t sound as weird coming from his mouth as Harry would expect really. It actually feels more
Draco stared at Harry without saying anything before he lifted his gaze to the ceiling, making Harry look there as well. All this time trying to get Draco under the mistletoe and it had happened just like that without Harry even trying! It was a Christmas mi-
He chucks out the letter he wrote in response to Potter’s, feeling his cheeks heat up. “Here,” he says, because well, he hasn’t had a good fucking in almost a year and Potter’s too fit for his own good, and his stupid mind isn’t working and the best he can think to say is bloody
“Hey, Malfoy, me and Hermione are going to the library to work on the Herbology essay, wanna come work with us?”
He’d tried offering him to join him and Hermione in the library when he was suffering through his Herbology essay. He really should’ve known better with that one.
Though he manages not to go through with the urge to touch, his mind still lingers on the exposed skin, wondering if the lines of the tattoo were bumpy or felt no different than the rest of his skin.
“So, what can I do for you, Malfoy?” Potter says leaning against the pillar that has the leashes with his arms folded.
Draco clears his throat. “Hello, Lovegood. There is nothing to be interrupted. Potter was just showing me his snake,” he says, immediately noticing how bad that sounded with a grimace.
He takes a deep breath, clutching at the letter he wrote Potter in his left hand, clears his throat and pushes the door open.
Harry slides Andie back in the carrier and walks up to the door, turning back to face Draco. “Oh, before I leave, is there anything good to eat around here? I’m starving.”
Harry hadn’t known how to deal with it at first, Draco wasn’t really the “let’s talk about our feelings” kind of person but it had become more and more impossible for Harry to ignore Draco frowning at a potions book or a letter that came in the afternoon. Making Draco feel better was a lot of trial and error:
“Oh, yes, I’ll put Andie back and be on my way,” he says, trying not to dwell on Malfoy’s use of his first name. “Lovely meeting you Sky, I will most likely see you again in an upcoming session. That is, if M-
“Yeah, she does,” Harry says. Now that he has a name to go with the face he remembers Parkinson, though, “Did her nose always look like that?”
“Hey, Malfoy,” Harry starts as they walk past multiple closed doors. He knows he shouldn’t pry but he can’t help himself. “Isn’t it a bit weird that you’re treating this patient from their fear of snakes, and you’re also afraid of snakes?”
“It’s just that everyone from the wizarding world wants Harry Potter: The Boy Who Lived and it seems like every muggle that I’m interested in only wants sex.”
Just as Harry takes the photograph to look more closely, the door opens and Malfoy comes in with a tray containing their tea.
PSS: Earl will start pecking at your hand if you don’t feed him an owl treat. It’ll start soft but if you ignore him… Also, he won’t stop until you give him one. He likes the ones shaped like squirrels if you got ‘em.
them with a simple wave of his wand. “I told Teddy he couldn’t have more sweets before dinner, he got mad and you know how his accidental magic has been getting stronger lately…” Harry trails off.
He realizes that he forgot to put his glasses back on only when he walks outside and the London fog seems thicker and blurrier than usual. He walks to the alley behind the clinic and casts a slight adjustment charm on his eyes, not bothering to go back. With a sigh, he disapparates, picturing the apparition point in Knockturn Alley. It’s only when he’s standing in front of 723 Knockturn Alley, looking at Harry Potter rearranging what seems to be a variety of snacks and treats for reptiles, that Draco realizes he could’ve just apparated into his office and grabbed his glasses. It would’ve been easier than the adjustment charm he cast. He can actually still go back, he realizes, just when Potter turns around and fixes his eyes on Draco. Except now Potter’s seen him and… Oh, Merlin fuck, he’s Draco Malfoy, why is he so bloody scared of seeing Potter again?
Harry clears his throat and tells her that he was never involved with Malfoy in that way, again, neither denying nor confirming his attraction to him.
“Draco is one of our usuals, Harry, he’s here quite often. I suppose you guys haven’t crossed paths here lately because you don’t come around nearly as much as you should,” Hermione admonished lightly.
“I have a better idea,” Draco says, leaning in closer to Harry. Even without his glasses, Harry can recognise the mischievous glint in his lover’s eyes.
“And the piercings and the tattoo came with the job description, I’m assuming,” Draco jokes and it’s sort of mad that he’s actually enjoying a conversation with Potter.
“Yeah, sorry. I, uh, had something prepared but I’m blanking now so you have to bear with me for a couple more minutes. Maybe you’ll remember that last night I said that I could live without you if I tried and that’s true but I meant it when I said I don’t want to live without you. And I know I’ve said before that marriage is meaningless other than just making everything official but I want you in my life and maybe making things official isn’t such a bad thing after all,” Harry said taking another deep breath before getting on one knee and taking the little black velvet box out from his pocket. “Draco, will you marry me?”
Nobody expected Harry James Potter, the Saviour of the Wizarding World, to be dating Draco Lucius Malfoy, known ex-Death Eater. Yet he was doing just that and nobody had ever seen him happier.
Malfoy heads outside, leaving Harry alone, save for Andie. In Malfoy’s absence, Harry starts looking around with Andie occasionally lifting his head to peek around. He walks over to Malfoy’s desk that matches the dark wood of the door. There is a leather cover planner and a gold pen next to it, which upon further inspection Harry realizes is engraved with Malfoy’s initials. There are framed (muggle) photographs of him with Narcissa Malfoy and another with a woman with black hair that Harry thinks is familiar but can’t name.
Harry thought he saw Draco’s eyelids flutter but all movement had stopped — if it ever existed — when Harry blinked.
I changed the prompt slightly because my lovely beta @maesterchill on Tumblr pointed out that Brits don't use the word candy all that much and we settled on Fizzing Whizbees instead of candy or sweets.
“I can think of a couple fun ways to stop your rambling, though I’m not quite sure my body would allow me to do either one. So do try not to go on for ages, love.”
Draco can practically hear Potter’s grin, and he doesn’t need a mirror to know he’s blushing. “You wish, Potter. Not scared, merely curious,” he says, hoping that he’s believable.
“Anyway, Potter, now that it’s established that the weird thing here is not my being in this pub, do tell me; why are you planning to seduce my friend?”
of Voldemort. But then, I found Nymph left behind in an empty nest, trying to get out of her egg that just wasn’t cracked enough. Her mum must’ve thought her not strong enough to survive.”
Nymph lays her head flat on Harry’s shoulder in approval. Right as the green flames engulf them, Harry thinks he hears Nymph say
so much that you actually stopped being an Auror.” Draco’s eyes widened as if he wasn’t expecting to say all those things.
“That’s putting it lightly, Granger,” Draco started, distractedly looking at Hermione make his drink. “Robards is being a prick again, but what’s new,” Draco huffed, taking his eyes off of Hermione, giving her the chance to add a drop of Draught of Peace into Draco’s drink to calm his nerves. “You’d think that after seven years of being an Auror the man would trust me to take a case that’s actually a case and not just saving a kneazle from a tree. But no, I’m still Draco Malfoy the Death Eater to that lot.”
