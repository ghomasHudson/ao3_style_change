“Alright.” Draco gestured for Potter to follow him to the right side of the store, where he kept the Draughts. He retrieved a paper bag, and placed one, two, three units inside. Then he handed the bag to Potter, who followed him to the check-out desk.
Breathless, Potter looked at him, black hair hanging down. He looked like a Greek God, and Draco shivered with anticipation.
“For everything.” His voice broke on the word. “For pushing you away, for snapping at you, for kicking you out of my flat when you were only trying to help, for all of it. I’m so sorry.”
“Okay.” Annie wrote something down on her notepad. Draco was beginning to feel like a specimen after all.
Draco took Potter’s clear hint that he’d overstepped, and pursed his lips. “I’m sorry,” he said tightly. “I didn’t mean to imply that you aren’t entitled to your feelings. That would be hypocritical of me.”
Suddenly, unpleasant memories flooded Harry’s head, memories of when Draco was slightly older, and Lucius was yelling at him and hitting him for admitting to his mother he had a crush on a boy. All the repressed self-loathing and internalized homophobia bubbled to the surface, and Harry rubbed Draco’s leg with his free hand.
“Because I was worried about you after leaving you alone like that. I didn’t want you to do anything to hurt yourself,” Pansy said, dark eyes imploring.
His eyes were closed, but he didn’t look peaceful or young like he normally did while asleep. In this single night, he looked like he had aged beyond his years.
“And then I’d lay you down on your back, nice and comfortable, so all you have to do is relax while I kiss and suck and bite at all the sensitive spots on your beautiful, writhing body.”
since he’d been touched in a way that wasn’t bruising or hostile, and the gentleness of it all was almost enough to make Draco start crying again.
“It’s rude to leave people standing out in the cold, Harry,” snapped Draco, sharp enough to cut diamonds.
“We broke up years ago. We never really worked out after the war, actually. We tried giving it a go, but I realized that I wasn’t in love with her, as much as I loved her as a person. It can be confusing to separate the two when everyone expects you to act a certain way. Being with Ginny just felt like another thing that was expected of me, just like being an Auror felt expected of me, and I couldn’t do it. I had to do what was best for me. The passion with Ginny just wasn’t there. We realized together that we weren’t actually in love. We’re still on great terms, of course. She plays for the Harpies.”
Soon enough, Pansy’s face appeared in the flames. In spite of their fresh row, she looked happy to see him.
Draco couldn’t help but chuckle. They made pleasant small talk the rest of the way there, Potter asking Draco about the types of customers he got and Draco asking Potter about, well, anything that didn’t violate St. Mungo’s patient-confidentiality agreement.
“You were certainly a sight to behold.” His green eyes twinkled with something Draco couldn’t discern.
Draco’s breathing had picked up considerably. The patterns stopped. He twisted his hands in the thin material of Harry’s tee shirt as Harry skimmed a hand over his back.
“There’s actually a sale going on right now for this section of the store, so your product is half off,” Draco said kindly.
Potter must have heard, for he looked down at his stomach, then back up at him. He grinned, and the force of it nearly sent Draco to his knees. “I don’t blame you, Malfoy. I’m
“Yeah.” Harry said it so casually, but there was nothing casual about the way he pulled Draco closer and planted his other hand on Draco’s hip, rubbing small circles on the clothed skin.
Closing his eyes and steeling himself for the impact of the blade upon his skin, Draco raked the razor down the expanse of his wrist, tearing and shredding the fragile flesh. Searing pain squeezed him like a cobra.
him, moving incessantly, setting a brutal pace that had him thrashing and moaning unabashedly. He clawed onto Harry’s back as pleasure swelled in his gut, and Harry continued to grunt “I love you”s as he fucked Draco so thoroughly he would feel it for the next week.
“You like it like this,” said Harry, pressing a kiss on Draco’s leg. “You like when you can see me.”
because of what happened, but that doesn’t mean I don’t ever. And I don’t just want sex, not anymore. That’s what I meant when I answered your question. I meant that I’m yours. If you’ll have me.”
So Draco leaned forward, tangled his hands in Potter’s surprisingly soft hair, and pressed his forehead against Potter’s, breathing heavily. Hearing Potter use his given name was about the most erotic thing he’d ever experienced.
“I-I don’t understand. Just last night, you were saying you . . . You . . .” Draco couldn’t force the word out. It stuck to his tongue like salt water taffy.
Immediately a sense of calm washed over him like a nice, warm blanket. This was better than a Peace Draught. This was . . .
, that he and Potter weren’t dating, that he was just going to Grimmauld,  but he still wanted to look like he’d put in some effort.
“I know you don’t want me to stop, darling,” said Harry soothingly. “You’re just overwhelmed, and that’s okay.”
“Seriously, Harry, what’s the big deal? As far as I know, you’re only shagging; it’s not like you’re in love with the bastard. So out with it!”
Draco continued to stir and overthink until the clock chimed eight, and he couldn’t take it anymore.
“Draco?” Harry asked hesitantly, unsure where he was supposed to venture from here because he had never comforted Draco before, about anything, and he wasn’t very good at consoling people in general.
Draco, like a frightened animal, shook his head even faster than Harry had and shrank back into his pillows.
Draco watched, helpless to stop him and tell him how sorry he was for being such a coward, as the man he loved planted a soft kiss on the crown of his head and turned around to walk out of his life forever.
“Well.” Potter wrung his hands together, as a faint flush crept up his cheeks, which Draco was immensely pleased with. “Some days it’s better than others.”
“That isn’t okay,” said Draco instantly, forgetting his manners. “You can’t just blame yourself for someone else voluntarily protecting you. Who really killed him, Potter?”
Potter flirting back with him rustled something deep within Draco, something that had been left dormant for many years, and it was like poking a sleeping dragon. Now it was stirring, and soon it would fully awaken, ravenous and all-consuming.
As the ambulance took off for the hospital, Harry knelt beside Draco and took his limp, cold hand in his own warm, alive ones. Rubbed the skin softly.
“Let’s say I wanted to be a Potions master. They’ll take one look at my application and incinerate it.”
Harry then demanded in his Auror voice that left no room for debate that he go with Draco- he wasn’t going to leave his side ever again.
“We’ll need to pump his stomach,” a medic responded stoically. It confounded Harry to no end how these people managed to stay so calm in such dire, life-threatening circumstances.
But instead of looking annoyed, Potter only smiled softly at him and beckoned for Draco to join him under the umbrella. Draco did, and their sudden proximity was enough to send his stomach into somersaults. He stood almost close enough to Potter to touch.
“Oh.” Potter scratched his head awkwardly. Then he said, “Thanks for the potions, Malfoy.” And he was leaving. Draco watched him walk out of the store, listening to the bell jingle over the door frame.
“Let me show you to your room,” said Cindy. She gestured for Draco to follow her. Once they reached the narrow hallway with doors on either side, she stopped in front of one door on the left. “This is you.”
Draco white-knuckled the creaking and shaking table, and books rained down to the ground as Harry continued to fuck him at a brutal pace. All Draco could do was lie there and take it, burn in his arse be damned.
Draco looked furious. “You really just have the worst timing, Harry. I was about to go draw myself a bath, so if you could keep this brief, that would be appreciated.”
Draco’s blood went cold. He stiffened, and Annie must have noticed, for she said, “It’s important you answer honestly. It’s only a detriment to yourself if you don’t.”
“No, it is, Draco, because you do it all the time. You block my floo when we get into fights, you kick me out, hell, you kicked
“You don’t have to answer if you aren’t comfortable,” Harry said. “But after the war I started taking Occlumency lessons, practical ones, and I realized that if I wanted to master Occlumency, then I wanted to master Legilimency, too. So I took lessons for both.”
One bitterly cold evening, he got into a screaming match with Pansy over his rapidly deteriorating mental state, how he needed to move on from Harry already, and how selfish he was being by making her worry so much, when he’d never asked for it. He’d never asked for any of it.
Narcissa’s tea cup slipped out of her hand and landed on the rug with a soft patter, spilling its hot piping contents all over the patterned fabric.
Harry paused for a moment, considering Draco’s words. Right when Draco was about to cave and roll his eyes and indulge Harry in a brief lecture about the importance of euphemisms, recognition flashed on his face.
Harry looked at Hermione for support. She wore a grim facial expression like a fashion statement. Sighing, he turned his attention back to Ron.
The laughter abruptly stopped. Ron furrowed his brows as though he were reading through a particularly nasty case. “What?”
Potter reached his hand out, then appeared to think the better of it and pulled it away. Draco found he wanted, no,
Draco melted a little at the praise, and he watched as Potter slowly but surely unbuttoned him until his dress shirt had flown open to reveal his battered, scarred torso.
Harry walked across the small living room and picked up his coat, putting it back on hurriedly, wanting nothing more than to leave Draco’s space.
Panic swelled inside him. He was going to die. He was actually going to die, wasn’t he? He thought about all the times he’d poked fun at Harry, or made cruel remarks about his dead parents. How horrible he was to not have apologized.
“That’s alright.” Annie wrote something down, then looked deep into Draco’s eyes. “What happened when Harry re-entered your life?”
Draco knew she was right. But it was easier to use his mother as an excuse than face the reality that he wasn’t ready to let Harry Potter back into his life.
Draco immediately stiffened, but in his weakened condition there was not much he could do to escape his situation.
“It’s actually better if you keep your eyes open,” Harry said. “It will keep the connection stronger.”
“I’m done fighting,” Harry told him simply. “I just want you back. And whatever I need to do to make that happen, I’ll do.”
When Harry washed between his arse-cheeks, Draco made an undignified squeal that Harry found downright adorable and squirmed.
Draco gestured wildly around with his hands, setting his glass down on the coffee table. “For my actions. For all of it.”
Gasping so softly it was inaudible, Draco felt a prickle of a spark where Potter touched him. He watched as Potter slid his hand further, until his fingers reached Draco’s knuckles. Then his thumb was making soft, gentle circles on Draco’s skin.
Harry pulled his boyfriend into a searing kiss, easing him back on the pillows and pinning his wrists above his head.
Draco didn’t know how to answer that. His silence manipulated the expression on Pansy’s face into something hard and unpleasant.
“No, seriously. Why?” Draco knew it was the alcohol talking, not him, and that if he were sober he wouldn’t be asking these questions- hell, he might not have told Potter this story at all. Which he was beginning to sincerely regret doing.
Draco blinked some more, and the figure came into focus. He saw rectangular spectacles that shielded green eyes, curly black hair, and a worried frown.
Parkinson nodded, looking Harry deep in the eye. “Be careful with him, alright?” she said as she rose and grabbed her coat she’d carelessly strewn across the back of the sofa.
“He’s sleeping right now, and probably will be for a while, since he’s on some pretty strong anesthesia. But you’re welcome to stay for as long as you need.”
Potter’s face softened marginally. “I know that. You don’t have to tell me anything you don’t feel comfortable telling me. I only thought I’d ask.”
“Harry, I just came to tell you, I plan on keeping it, but I don’t want to put any pressure on you. You can be as involved as you want.”
“You have to tell him,” Pansy said, piercing the peaceful silence like a dagger. “This isn’t good for you, Draco.”
“Only here,” he answered. The question was simple enough; but the odd way in which Potter had posed it, almost as if he were genuinely curious for the answer, left him feeling off-kilter.
Relief flooded Harry. He practically sagged with it. He thanked the man who had spoken to him and went into the room to see Draco.
. This wasn’t how this was supposed to go. He was supposed to have erased his hideous mark he left on society by doing the wizarding world one last favor. Not come back to a crying Harry who looked like he was crumbling to pieces before Draco’s eyes.
“But you and Potter are meant to be together,” said Pansy. “It’s literally embedded in the stars. Don’t you, I dunno, want to at least try?”
“Sure I do,” said Draco. “I know you have really bad nightmares, and I don’t want to be the cause of that. I’ve done enough damage in the war. Surely you can let me have this one good thing?”
“Draco . . .” Harry sounded so sad, and Draco hated being the cause of that sadness. He wanted to be the reason Harry smiled, every day.
Harry closed the distance between them, sliding a hand up his waist. Draco allowed the electrifying touch to wash over him, as Harry’s heady scent filled the very air he breathed. Harry pressed his forehead against his, breathing hard.
“Of course I am,” Draco said lightly. “I just don’t . . . See people much these days, is all, so I don’t get a lot of practice.” That would be quite an understatement. But he was keen on keeping that part of himself safely blanketed away.
“You have no one out here. No one knows who you are. You aren’t making a difference anywhere. You’re just shelving aging books that have more of a spine than you do.”
“You have it,” Harry answered, as though on autopilot. “You have all the time in the world, Draco. I’m not going anywhere.”
“You look so pretty like this,” Potter praised him, pushing in his finger deeper which caused Draco to make a strangled sound. “Doing so well for me.”
“You don’t call the shots,” Harry growled, pressing Draco down harder which elicited a high-pitched moan. Draco would never admit it aloud, but he loved it when Harry took control. It felt like a weight off his shoulders, giving him a funny, floating feeling that he couldn’t quite identify.
Draco sniffled, shaking his head. “I’ll make more of an effort,” he said. “I’ll visit you more often, I’ll write to you regularly.”
His circuits were so frazzled he was too exhausted to do anything but look back at her, without so much as a sneer.
Potter visibly deflated with relief. “Okay. Sorry, I just . . . That sort of winds me up, you know?”
He pulled one out, examining its sharp, metal blades. He drew in a deep, shuddering breath, pulling back his sleeves on his left arm.
“Thank you,” said Potter, raising his glass to cheers with Draco. Surprised, Draco allowed their glasses to clink together before both men took a sip.
“But I need you to know I care about you, a lot,” said Draco, and truthfully, that didn’t help much right now.
He noticed how Draco had backed away from him, giving him a sufficient amount of space, far more than he needed, frankly.
“This isn’t about any of that right now,” said Harry, letting go of his wrist. “This is about your inability to look after yourself.”
Draco held himself together the entire short walk home from the apparition point in the alley. The instant he locked his door shut, he collapsed onto his couch in a fit of sobs.
Draco suppressed the urge to roll his eyes at Harry’s uncanny inability to ever grasp anything, ever.
“What is it?” Draco asked softly, placing a hand on Potter’s bicep and rubbing up and down in what he hoped was a soothing manner.
He felt a prick in his forearm, and looked up at his nurse to see her pull the empty syringe out of his skin.
want to hurt himself, because he didn’t want to do anything that would make Harry happy. And that was that.
“Okay,” Draco said. As if on cue, his stomach gave an angry rumble. He had been in a hurry this morning since he’d nearly slept through his alarm, so he hadn’t made himself breakfast.
Hi, sorry it's been a while!! I've been working on this other Drarry series that I just finished up. If any of you are interested in reading that, it's up on my page. The creative juices for this piece just weren't flowing while I was writing that series, but I'm back, and without any further ado here is chapter 9!
“Your parents are in an abusive relationship. An equal partnership does not function the way you’re telling me your parents do.”
“I . . . What I mean to say is, I know you heard it from Pansy, but I want you to hear it from me. I . . .” Draco drew a deep, shuddering breath. This was it. “I love you, Harry.”
Draco’s flush spread down his neck, all the way to his chest. He attempted to cover his face, but Harry pried his hand away. “I like it, too,” he told Draco. “I like seeing all your reactions while I fuck you. It gets me so hot. You get me so hot, Draco.”
Draco wanted the man above him with the force of a thousand suns. His desire thrummed through his veins, buzzing in his brain. It had been so
“It’s rather lovely,” was Potter’s response, and Draco wanted to swoon for this man because that was
“He was obsessed with you all during sixth year, stalking you and everything,” said Pansy, and Merlin but she wasn’t helping!
“Of course,” said Harry quickly, letting go of Draco and standing up, pushing down the hurt he felt from practically being booted from Draco’s flat. His hands felt cold from the absence of Draco.
“Good,” exclaimed Ron furiously. “As he should. You seem to forget what he did to my brother, Harry.”
Annie’s friendly, kind tone and warm smile took Draco by complete surprise. He had been expecting cold and clinical, had been expected to be treated like a specimen as opposed to a regular human being. But the woman standing before him showed no signs of frostiness, which unnerved Draco.
Draco choked on a sob as Harry continued licking and kissing all around his fluttering opening, and when Harry’s tongue finally pierced him he let out a scream.
“Let me do that,” Draco coaxed, hands covering Harry’s. Surprised, Harry sat back and let him. Once Harry was completely naked, Draco stood up to remove his own trousers, then climbed back on the bed, straddling Harry.
. Of course not. I’m so sorry. After the story you just told me, I was so insensitive and I . . . I’m sorry.”
“Come here, sweetheart,” Harry coaxed, and pulled a trembling Draco into his arms. “I was so, so stupid. I could have lost you
Draco knew it would be a long way before he was fully recovered. Even halfway. But here in St. Mungo’s hospital, under the rising sun and chirping birds, he felt a piece of himself heal.
“It’s better that way,” Draco replied honestly. “I was a horrible friend, and it’s better off for everyone that I’m out of the way. It’s a courtesy thing, if you think about it.”
When Draco was discharged, he expected Mother to “pick him up,” since he couldn’t very well tell this hospital he was going to Apparate home, now could he? But instead of Mother, his best friend Pansy stood before him in all her Slytherin glory.
, and he gasped for breath as Harry’s gentle shushing and cooing washed over him like a wave. Harry pulled out of the embrace to look at Draco’s tear-stained face, red-rimmed eyes and heaving chest.
“It’s the proper thing to do,” Harry said. “Everyone in your family will be relieved we’re getting back together, frankly. Molly was distraught when we broke up, remember?”
Potter gasped, hands flying over his mouth. Eyes filled with anguish. Draco hated being the one to put it there.
Draco bristled. “It pays the bills. I was left with nothing after the war, paying it all in reparations, so this is all I have.”
Harry got to work on his fly, pushing down his zipper and yanking him up with brute force to pull down his trousers. He set Draco roughly back down on the table with his pants bunched around at his ankles and pulled him closer, exhaling heavily in the shell of his ear.
“Harry, I’m closing. Is there something I can help you with?” Draco asked as nicely as he could. He’d dealt with some pretty difficult customers today, and all he wanted to do was go home and soak in the bath with his fancy scrubs.
“Ah- Ohhh.” Draco moaned shamelessly as Harry’s fingers continued to stretch him. “Right there, Harry, right
“I don’t care that you didn’t ask; I’m giving it, because you need to hear it. It’s destroying you. He’ll eventually go off and marry that Weasley girl as soon as he knows what’s good for him, and what’ll happen to you then, huh? How will that make you feel? If you cut ties now, you can heal,
“Because it’s the best sex I’ve ever had,” Harry admitted, words escaping him in a flush. He felt his cheeks begin to redden in shame. It would be easier to cope if Draco were still the same sniveling, bullying bastard he was all those years ago at Hogwarts. But the blonde-haired Slytherin had changed. And Harry didn’t know what to do with that change.
As if the heavens above had heard him, a dizzying sensation overpowered him, blanketing over him, so strong that Draco closed his eyes and sighed deeply as the cramp slowly ebbed away.
Draco could have sagged with relief, and he did not want to think about how worried he’d gotten that Harry had gone and abandoned him.
Draco leaned in again, and Harry happily obliged, and their lips met once more, tongues curling together deliciously. They kissed for quite some time, until Draco was dizzy for air and had no choice but to release Harry as he greedily gulped breath after breath.
Draco felt his own cock begin to stir at last, and as he continued stroking Potter’s abdomen, admiring and feeling the muscles, his hardness came to full fruition.
Potter’s expression softened. “It was the least I could do. I would’ve gone to your trial either way, and I actually wasn’t originally planning on speaking at yours- only hers, because I owed her. But I saw how . . . Helpless you looked, how defeated . . .”
Draco exploded, causing Harry to flinch. “I might get a little light-headed sometimes, or dizzy, but that doesn’t mean I can’t function as a person.”
“What if I told you I’d guard your favorite color with my life? Not secretly- I mean, I’d want other people to know your favorite color. Certain important people. But if anyone ever made fun of your favorite color, or tried to threaten it, they’d have me to answer to.”
He felt shreds of self-loathing, and they almost seemed like old cuts that hadn’t healed properly. He felt how Draco was experiencing this so far- so far, he was finding it far more tolerable than Bellatrix or Voldemort’s incessant probing.
“Just when you’re about to come, I’ll pull off and edge you, leaving you dangling for me, just the way you like.”
Harry reached for him again, pulling him by the hands until they stood close enough to breathe the same air. He only had to whisper to be heard.
The next thing he registered was a soft beeping noise, slow and steady. It seemed to go in time with the rhythm of his breathing, which was another thing that struck him as odd. Could you breathe in the afterlife?
“So . . .” Potter said, setting his cup down on the coffee table. “I wanted to bring something up, if that’s alright with you.”
Draco scoffed bitterly. “Did you not see the way I boasted about it in sixth year to anyone who would listen? How
“We’ll give you plenty of food while you’re here, but the rest is up to you once you’re discharged,” said Annie. “Do you have any history with medication?” she asked.
Pansy had held him the other night for what felt like hours, but her touches did nothing to balm his wounds. He was cut wide open, and an insatiable infection was spreading through his veins.
“I can listen,” he said, sitting up straighter and looking Potter in the eye. “I understand more than you think.”
He thought back to the last time he’d called Draco beautiful, when he’d been trying to coerce him into bed. His stomach twisted into knots with guilt. But, he reminded himself, Draco had forgiven him. And was learning to trust him again, one day at a time.
Harry cut himself as a choked noise escaped his throat. He wiped his eyes with one hand, the other squeezing Draco’s delicate hand tightly.
“Are you kidding me, Potter? Do you know how unhealthy milk is? Did you know most mammals don’t drink milk past infancy? We’re the only ones.”
He repeated the words to himself in his head like a mantra as blood began dripping off his skin and into the sink. Pansy’s harsh words echoed in his head, how no one would ever want him and how he was fooling himself by believing Harry would ever want anything more to do with him than sex.
“If anyone can do it, it’s you,” said Draco, realizing he’d never gotten the chance to tell Hermione that in person. There were a lot of things Draco had never gotten the chance to do, that he was allowing himself to do now.
over the years. His shoulders had become broader, his arm muscles left him weak in the knees, his hair was just past his shoulders, black and curly as ever, and his eyes, green as a dewy forest at dawn, sparkled kindly behind rectangular spectacles.
When Draco had finished ringing up his customer, Potter walked up to the register with three vials in a bag. He passed the bag to Draco.
Potter only chuckled at his antics, green eyes twinkling, though not unkindly, as he pocketed the change. “It’s okay,” he said. “Nothing to be sorry for.”
“I know you were only trying to make light of the situation, too, in your own sinister way,” Potter teased, though his eyes followed the trail of Draco’s hand.
Draco, for one, couldn’t take the bubbling tension any longer. He scooted closer to Potter on the couch, until their knees were touching, and reached for his hands.
, five o’clock rolled around, and Draco began his closing duties. Once he was finished sweeping, he locked up and apparated home.
“I’m sorry for bringing it up,” said Harry. “It’s just that for a while, I was in a sort of serious relationship with this bloke, and we would use it on each other sometimes. It made the sex far more intimate and passionate.”
Potter was no longer the scrawny, knobby boy he’d been in school. The Potter standing before him today was clearly a
He did a thorough scan of the room, assessing its contents. In one corner, two middle-aged patients were playing a Muggle board game with a big tower of blocks. It appeared as though the object of the game was to pull blocks out and keep the tower standing up. In another corner, a woman was reading a magazine. In the middle of the room, at the table, three more patients sat coloring and doing word searches. In another corner was Cindy the tech, a young African American woman who looked to be about Draco’s age. She looked up from her magazine and made eye contact with Draco, then immediately rose and made her way over to him.
But Draco would never ask. He glued his mouth shut, as he always did when he and Harry were in these types of situations.
Eventually it was time for Draco to rinse his hair off, so he rotated in the tub and tilted back to get all the shampoo off. Harry couldn’t help himself. He reached for Draco, planting his hands on either side of his hips, rubbing the skin softly, coaxing him back up into a sitting position as he scooted in closer until their noses were almost touching.
Draco gave Cindy a curt nod before entering his room, and she left him to his own devices. He wasn’t tired, not even close; in fact, he was antsy and full of energy. He needed to get
“So, let me get this straight,” Ron said, pacing around in the living room of his flat. “You knock my sister up, but you aren’t getting back together?”
Aaaaand I'm back! After 2 vacations, updates will hopefully be more regular from here on out, at least until school starts again. I'm also taking a summer class which will eat up a significant portion of my time for the next few weeks but fingers crossed it doesn't interfere too much :)
“Just because we met when we were eleven does not mean you know me,” said Draco. “And if we’re being technical, it’s only seven years for us because the last time I saw you before you came into the shop was at my trial. Which I never properly thanked you for, by the way.”
Draco sighed. Of course he’d gone and given himself away. Potter could see right through him. That certainly wouldn’t do.
“I love your son very much,” Harry blurted out, not wanting her to finish that question. “And I’m assuming since you correspond with Draco regularly now you know about the baby.”
“There are ways you can cope with the pain- I would know, I’ve been doing it for the past seven years,” Harry told him. “You need someone professional to talk to, someone who can help you, the same way I’ve been helped.”
Draco flinched. Images of cruel, maniacal laughter, screams of Muggleborns writhing in agony on the cold, hard floor of the manor, red slits for eyes boring into his very soul, breaking down his Occlumency shields one by one . . .
about this,” Draco said despairingly, pushing Potter off himself. He buried his head in his hands as he continued to cry silently.
Potter only chuckled at his nervousness. “Just thought it seemed important to tell you. Once I figured it out, things that were seemingly out of place started making a lot more sense.”
“No,” Potter answered simply. “I’ve been single for a while, actually. I was in a rather serious relationship that went south when I found out he was cheating on me for the better part of a year.”
She and Draco had owled over the summer, and as soon as Draco had found out he’d sent an owl to Pansy with tear marks on it explaining the whole thing.
“Love it when you beg.” Harry manhandled Draco off the table, spun him around, and yanked down his boxers in one go. He pushed him down so he was bending over the table, with a large hand splayed across his back. “Gets me so hard.”
Harry leaned down and pressed their bodies together, kissing him tenderly as he wrapped an arm around Draco’s back to bring him closer. Draco wrapped his legs around his waist, eliciting a groan that traveled straight to his growing cock.
“Well, we got to talking,” said Harry. “And . . . We eventually went out for a pint. And I realized he isn’t so bad.”
Draco sighed. He was beginning to realize that he had acted incredibly ungrateful toward Pansy, pushing her away and treating her terribly when she only wanted to help. He felt like the worst friend in the world.
His question was answered when one day, they were walking in Diagon together, and a swarm of reporters flocked toward them like geese with cameras and quills and parchment.
If Father had been here, he would have slapped Draco square across the face for talking to Mother like that. But Mother only sighed agitatedly, running a hand through her long, blonde hair.
“I just . . . He doesn’t want to see me right now. We got in a row. But I have a feeling he wouldn’t turn you away.”
“Also love it when you rim my arse. I love coming alone from just your tongue, how utterly debauched it makes me feel. It’s downright humiliating, how much of a slut I am for your tongue, and I- Ahh! love it.”
this?” She wacked him on the arm. “We had a system. Whenever you feel like that, any hour of the day or night, you call me.”
to.” Now Harry was stepping closer to him, but Draco wasn’t ready for contact. Not yet. He pressed himself into the sink. “Not every act of kindness has to be a transaction, surely you know that, yeah? And she did it for you because she loves you, because I love you.”
“You’ve told me a lot of personal things tonight,” Draco said, deciding to be brave. He felt Potter’s hand slowly trail upwards, until his fingers stopped at the ridge of Draco’s wrist, where his thumb began rubbing soothing circles. Circles that both grounded Draco and sent him splattering all over the pub. “Can I ask why?”
“Me, neither,” Potter responded, so quickly that Draco nearly jolted with shock. “But, Draco, I . . . I don’t want to be your friend. I want something infinitely more dear.”
“Come for me, Draco,” said Harry sweetly, taking one hand and fisting it around Draco’s weeping, ruby red cock. “Come all over my hand, all nice and hot and sticky.”
“I know,” Potter said as Draco handed him his change. “I was only wondering. So . . . Do you work here a lot, or do you have another job elsewhere?”
Draco sighed, sinking further into his chair, feeling completely and utterly stripped bare. “Yes. Yes, I do.”
“You had no right,” Draco said coldly, as anger streamed through his veins and settled deep into the marrow of his bones. Pansy betrayed him. Pansy robbed him of his chance to tell Harry the truth.
cause conflict?” Ginny exclaimed, outraged. “We’re not in love, Harry. Why would we get married, or even start up a relationship, if we’re not in love? Don’t you see what a waste that is? And you didn’t even bother asking me about my love life, did you? I went on a date the other night. Albeit, that was before I found out I was pregnant- now, I’m not sure he’ll stick around. But that’s beside the point!”
“You know, I never properly thanked you. For saving my mother as well,” Draco said, scratching his head awkwardly.
“H-How? W-Why? Why would anyone- Why would your own family treat you like that, knowing who you are and what you went through?”
Was seven a good time to firecall Harry? It was a Friday, after all, so he might be going to grab a pint with his friends or old coworkers. Draco’s mind dwelled on all the worst-case scenarios it possibly could.
try to act like you know me just because we’ve slept together,” Draco continued. “I’m perfectly happy here, thank you very much, and for once in my life I have some peace and quiet. Surely, being the celebrity you are, you can appreciate that, right?”
How was Draco supposed to sit here and admit to his own mother that he’d let Harry use him for sexual pleasure?
“I can’t just force something that isn’t there,” Harry said, beginning to feel slightly angry. “I shouldn’t have to explain that to you.”
“Honey, if you can’t calm down, I’m going to have to sedate you.” The nurse’s tone was gentle but firm, savory-sweet like a chocolate-dipped pretzel.
As Potter leaned in again, Draco reached up and grabbed those god forsaken spectacles and tossed them aside. They landed somewhere on the floor. Potter kissed him without inhibition then, groaning into his mouth and thrusting his hips to meet Draco’s. Draco felt Potter’s hardness digging into his thigh, and he exhaled shakily. This was really about to happen, wasn’t it?
When he arrived at Grimmauld, Potter answered the door with a saccharine smile and a fuzzy, maroon jumper with a large H knitted on the front.
They were both very, very naked, and because of the intimacy of the moment Harry had to struggle to keep his cock down.
“Please, call me Molly, dear,” she said kindly with a smile so big an outsider might have guessed that Draco was her own child.
Harry was beginning to get annoyed, which was the wrong emotion, he knew, but he couldn’t help himself. “I meant in reference to you, you tit.”
“Harry-” Draco’s lip wobbled as he blinked heavily to stave off his tears. His emotions were bubbling to the surface, and it would not be long before he burst.
“Oh.” Harry felt very faint. Tonight had been a rollercoaster, but he had a feeling his ride was only just beginning.
Draco kicked the sheets off himself, swung out of bed, and as he walked across the hallway to the staircase, the aroma of fresh, sizzling bacon hit his nostrils.
All up until one dreary afternoon with the rain pattering away on the windows, Draco was feeling queasy. He’d skipped breakfast, hadn’t packed himself a lunch, and it was nearly five o’clock. One instant he was standing up on his tippy-toes trying to shelf a book, which was making him feel
“You have a nice place,” Draco complimented politely as he and Potter took a seat on the couch with a respectable distance between them.
“Please don’t cry, Malfoy,” Potter said, thumb brushing away a tear mark on Draco’s face. “Please don’t cry.”
Draco’s heart nearly stopped. All he’d ever wanted was Potter’s forgiveness. And now that he had it, it felt like a warm blanket was being draped over his aching, shivering heart.
But he was here on important business, he reminded himself, and he still hadn’t gotten to the bottom of why Draco looked as though someone was holding a wand to his head.
“I never said he didn’t,” said Annie. “Some people don’t know how to show it. If Harry isn’t in a condition to express his feelings for you in a healthy way, you need to learn how to set some boundaries for yourself.”
“My game? I’m not here for any games. I’m here because you’re . . . in a fragile state of mind right now, and you probably shouldn’t be alone.”
“Oh! Right.” Draco sheepishly let go of Harry’s hands, which sent Harry chuckling while he fetched his wand from his bedside drawer.
“What on earth are you sorry for?” Potter asked, and he sounded so worried that Draco wanted to reach out and hold his hand and console him that he had nothing to worry about. Which, of course, would be a lie, but Draco wanted to do it anyway.
“I was hoping that wouldn’t come up right away,” Harry said somewhat sheepishly. “That was incredibly manipulative of me, and I’m very sorry.”
“You have,” Pansy agreed. “I won’t lie to you. But I forgive you, because you seem aware of it now.”
“It seems as if a conversation between you two is long overdue. I’ll let Draco tell you,” was all she said, and Harry smiled at her, feeling a flutter of happiness inside his chest.
After Draco completed the last of his closing duties and locked up, he and Potter made to walk outside. As Potter exited the building and put his umbrella up, Draco realized that he’d left his at the flat.
Draco shifted his legs, and felt a lump beside him. Stiffening in shock, he sat up as fast as a rocket and glanced down.
Upon seeing his reaction, the nurse frowned at him. “Are you unfamiliar with what happens after an attempted suicide?”
“Well, if you spent longer than a second focusing on someone other than yourself, you’d see that I have no desire to spend the rest of my life with Ginny. I value my friendship with her deeply, but I don’t see a future with her. When we made love, there was no . . . fire. No passion.”
“I-I . . . How are things with . . . Erm . . .” He had trouble recalling her name, but calling her the Weaslette was hardly appropriate, now, was it? “The red-head girl?”
They sat on either side of the wooden table that wobbled when Draco put his elbows on top. Mother, however, folded her hands in her lap, as was proper.
“Harry Potter,” began Narcissa, and all the pleasantry and kindness had vanished from her tone. “You lie to my son about how you feel, break his heart, and then leave him?”
“There’s no rule stating that if you take a guy home he has to sleep with you,” Potter murmured soothingly, rubbing a strong hand up and down Draco’s back. “That may be socially understood by many, but it isn’t a rule.”
Which is why when he heard knocking on his door, he growled and cursed himself for giving Harry his home address.
“How can you honestly expect me to believe you just suddenly changed your mind like that?” Draco asked, snapping his fingers for emphasis. “You stormed out after I didn’t take the words the way you wanted.”
“You don’t have to make any decisions today. Or tomorrow. But it’s just something to think about. It’s been years. People have moved on. Society isn’t the same angry, resentful thing it was when you left it.”
Hi, all. I'm sorry this one's so short, but I wanted to get something out to you guys before I go back to school. Once I do, updates will slow down a lot. Thank you all for reading <3
Harry said soothingly. But truthfully, it wasn’t okay at all. Draco talking to his friends about Harry only meant trouble; it meant that there was a chance he felt something more for Harry than just sex.
Now it was time to play the waiting game, if Draco was expecting a response. Which he wasn’t, he told himself. He wasn’t.
yourself at him, for Merlin’s sake. I’m only saying this miscarriage opened back up the mere possibility of . . . something starting back up between you two.”
“I’ve spilled all over this rug. Let me spell this clean before the stain sets. Excuse me.” She made to stand up, but Harry pulled out his wand.
As Draco rang him up, he studied his features a bit more. Potter’s bronzed skin looked particularly sunkissed, with an expanse of freckles dotting his nose. His long, curly lashes accentuated the colour of his eyes even more strongly, and his tangly, unruly hair looked extra wild. Draco was overcome by the strangest urge to run his hands through it.
Draco couldn’t help himself. He laughed with him, and soon the two were laughing in earnest together, and it was the most earth-shatteringly magnificent thing Draco had ever experienced.
Potter thanked the waitress, and removed his hand from Draco’s. His hand immediately felt cold from the loss. Draco looked down at his monster of a burger, which smelled
“Clearly you aren’t equipped to make those decisions on your own!” Harry snapped. “Look at what you did to yourself.” The cancerous concern morphed into fiery, white-hot anger that flowed through him like lava on the verge of erupting.
Pansy sighed. “Draco, you’re going to have to let him go if you want to be happy. He’s making you miserable. You’re getting thinner, when you didn’t have any weight to lose in the first place, and you just seem really sad and depressed all the time.”
As Draco continued to melt into him, Harry continued to kiss down his beautiful body, humming and licking and sucking at certain spots where he knew Draco would writhe. He gently pried Draco’s knees apart, hands sliding down to grip his inner thighs.
“Let me spell the door locked,” Draco murmured, reaching in his pocket for his wand and casting a quick locking charm at the door. Harry wasted no time in smashing his mouth against Draco’s, backing him into the table. Draco sighed and gasped into Harry’s domineering kiss, and swallowed down a whimper as Harry hoisted up his arse and sat him down on the cluttered table. Draco pushed some books aside, not caring even as he heard them land on the floor. As he wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist he returned his attention to Harry, who had begun to nibble deliciously on his neck, whispering pure, unadulterated filth into his milky skin.
“Draco, I don’t know what I’d do without you,” Harry said, hugging him impossibly closer as Draco’s face did something ugly. “It tears me apart to my core.”
Draco blinked owlishly, opening his eyes to see someone kneeling over him, hands hovering above him as if they were afraid to touch him.
“I want this,” Draco said, willing the words to sound as steady as they felt in his head. “I want you.”
“I . . . I told him I loved him. But then I took it back, because I found out I’m having a baby, and the mother of my child doesn’t want him anywhere near the baby. But then I realized how . . .
“It was a long time ago,” Draco said kindly, willing the emotion to stay out of his voice. “It’s okay.”
these past few weeks. Asking me to spend the night, saying you love me while we fuck and then kicking me out, then turning around and saying I
“Hey, hey.” Harry leaned down and touched his shoulder, gently coaxing him into a sitting position. The room began to spin, and Draco’s head dropped.
“You’re too pretty for your own damn good.” Harry murmured a spell, and next thing Draco knew a lubed finger swiftly and roughly entered him. He had come apart countless times on Harry’s fingers alone; just one had him panting and gripping the edges of the table for dear life. Harry knew just where to crook and piston so that Draco felt pleasure curl all through his abdomen.
“Draco.” Harry scooted closer to him on the couch, and reached for his trembling hand. Draco let him take it. Harry rubbed the skin softly, feeling every bump and ridge of his knuckles. “I don’t.”
He was led into a room, with a few other people doing various activities, such as reading, walking around the hall, coloring, and, as promised, watching the telly.
Draco, antsy as ever to make sure everything was okay, was the first to break the comfortable silence.
The group of friends was sitting together by the crackling fireplace. In spite of the warmth from the flames, Draco shivered.
“Are you doing this for yourself?” Pansy asked him with an arched, thin brow. “Or are you doing it for me?”
Draco’s head swam with dizziness, mind going all fuzzy as he lifted himself off Potter’s cock, gaping hole clenching around nothing, before Potter was all but tackling him to the sofa and easing his legs apart, sinking back inside him.
Draco grinned as the message faded from his wrist with the tap of his finger. So Potter didn’t completely hate the message-him. That was certainly a good thing.
“No, I’m ready, I’m just . . . I’m just freaking out because I don’t want it to feel like the last time someone was in my head. My shields are so battered, Harry. The Dark Lord destroyed them, and they still haven’t healed.”
“I wasn’t aware I needed to let you inside my head for sex to be passionate and intimate, Harry,” Draco said somewhat crossly.
“Draco,” he murmured into his collarbone, sucking at the skin and lapping over it with tiny kisses. “Let me take care of you. I know you want it, too.”
“You want me, too,” Harry said roughly, stalking closer to him. Draco allowed him to place both hands on his hips, drawing him in. Rubbing up and down, up and down. The gesture was both soothing and exhilarating.
“I don’t hate working at the bookshop,” Draco argued, though his determined tone was beginning to falter.
Harry noticed Draco’s tension as soon as he walked in the door. It was ebbing off of him, and Harry racked his brain for suitable ways to calm his boyfriend down. He’d hoped the candles and the cleaning would be enough, but now he wasn’t sure.
Draco knew they’d never be together, but he deserved at least basic human decency. “I normally expect apologies to come in writing.”
“Considering the Ministry kisses the very ground he walks on, the fact that he’s back here is a joke,” said Blaise.
“I think I’ve done enough damage to the wizarding world,” Draco said frostily. “It’s best that I stay away.”
“Whatever it is, I can assure you we can work through it together,” she said, though her tone held a hint of worry. She masked her emotions well, Harry noticed.
He wasn’t aware his breathing had picked up until he felt Potter’s hand squeeze his own, sure and steady. There was a soothing voice telling him to breathe, to just take a deep, deep breath, and hold it . . .
“Yes.” She smiled softly, eyes twinkling. “You love him. That much is clear. He’s been begging and begging and begging for me to give you another chance, but I wanted to see for myself that you’d changed.”
. He needed to know where Potter stood. Did he like him? Did he hate him? Was this all some elaborate prank to humiliate him?
“Yes.” Draco began rocking back and forth, covering his mouth to prevent his lips from wobbling or any embarrassing noises to come out. He was a monster, and he deserved to die. Why was Annie being so nice to him?
“I know I was, and that was a mistake,” said Harry. “Because I don’t love you. Now, I’m not going to apologize for missing the sonogram, because something really important came up.”
“Harry . . .” Draco’s breathing picked up the lower Harry kissed, and suddenly he found his hands tightening in Harry’s hair, pulling incessantly. Harry’s lips were instantly back on his, feral, demanding. Draco felt himself opening to his touches petal by petal like a tulip in the swell of spring, and he was blooming.
“Clearly something else is bothering you, because you looked upset before I accepted your apology,” he said, and Merlin, but the bastard was right. From here on out, Draco would have to be a lot more careful.
“Sirius left me this place,” Potter said, and Draco’s heart twinged with guilt when he remembered their earlier conversation. It wasn’t fair that Potter still blamed himself for Sirius’s death. Just like it wasn’t fair that Draco couldn’t help but blame himself for his own involvement in the war. None of it was fucking fair.
“Your mother is overcompensating for neglecting you when you were a child. Ultimately, she cannot control who you choose to see.”
Draco gasped audibly and wrapped a shaking hand around his weeping, ruby cock, twisting and pulling furiously.
This time, Harry tried a different approach. He tried reaching for Draco, who flinched away from him with a hiss.
Draco felt his resolve begin to crumble like a warm, melty cookie. He allowed himself, just for a moment, to fall into the easy rhythm of Harry.
“Harry, get off me.” He was firm, perhaps a smidge more than necessary, but assertiveness was a new avenue for him and he was not yet familiar with its many dips and twists and turns.
“You ready?” Potter asked, pulling his fingers out of Draco’s hole which was dripping with lube. “You ready for my cock?”
When they reached Draco’s flat, his nerves were on fire where Potter touched him. He wanted Potter’s hands on him, everywhere. And the realization nearly made him double over, because he knew what that meant for him.
And as they finished their breakfast while they listened to the birds chirp outside and watched the sun rise the rest of the way, Draco felt a calm settle over him that he hadn’t felt in a very long time.
“Love it when you finger me,” Draco said, and Harry felt a surge of fondness for the man beneath him. “Make me feel so good, getting me nice and ready for your big, fat cock-”
“Look, Draco, I have my own life, and my own shit to deal with. You’ve got to start taking yours a bit more seriously if you want to snap out of this funk, which I’m assuming you do, because if you didn’t that would be so depraved and pathetic that I think I might actually kill myself.”
“Don’t lash out at me because you’re angry with Harry,” Hermione growled. “I value my friendship with Harry, and I would have done him wrong by telling. And can you blame him for not wanting to come to you? Look at how you’re acting.”
“It was a long time ago,” said Harry. “It’s not something I can just wake up one day and recover from; I’m working on it in therapy like everything else. But it’s getting easier to manage as I get older.”
Draco leaned in to kiss him, and Harry happily obliged. Their lips reached for each other’s, afraid, tentative at first, before Draco boldly took the first step and planted his hands on Harry’s face and pulled him in closer as he allowed Harry to pull him into his lap.
Harry asking him to stay over last time was strange, and it messed with him a little bit. Okay, maybe a lot. But then Draco remembered that Harry practically hated him. He was still a Death Eater, after all, who had fought alongside the monster who killed Harry’s parents. Harry would never see him differently.
Not in the mood to deal with Parkinson for the second time tonight, Harry growled in frustration before rising to answer the door.
“Nothing’s a hundred percent effective, Draco.” said Pansy. “You have to know what you’re dealing with. He’s clearly not over her, and he may eventually see you as someone who’s getting in the way of his family.”
. I knew something was wrong, but I didn’t want to push you, because I know how you get when you’re pushed, so I withdrew so you would come to me on your own, and you never did. It just kept getting worse and worse and worse, and Pansy’s letters kept getting more urgent, but I kept ignoring them because I childishly hoped in my heart that you would eventually come to me on your own. I know it’s selfish, but I wanted to be the one to help you. Then the letters eventually stopped, and I naively thought you had gotten better. You barely wrote. You only came home for the holidays. I didn’t even see you on your birthday. I need you to know something right now, Draco. You
Too many. But none involved the Muggle world, so Draco merely shook his head and replied calmly, “No.”
“Gonna taste myself on you, baby,” Harry murmured, burying his face in Draco’s crack and licking a stripe that went from his crack all the way to his perineum, collecting some come in the process.
Potter’s eyes blazed with something that made Draco’s fragile heart constrict, and his jaw went slack as he inhaled quietly. His eyes fluttered closed, as he shook his head back and forth. Then he opened them again, focusing on Draco.
Harry gave Draco an oversized Chudley Cannons tee shirt and a pair of boxers. Draco found the clothes to be quite comforting not because they were particularly soft, but because they smelled like Harry.
And damnit, there he went excusing his actions again. Would Draco ever learn how to properly apologize? Why was being good so
“I hope you’ve come to your senses and realized you need human interaction in your life just like everybody else,” she said. “And I’m sorry for calling you selfish.”
Draco hummed again, loudly and encouragingly, and Harry stopped fighting it. He spilled down Draco’s throat with a loud cry, orgasm so strong he saw white spots.
“Okay?” Potter asked, moving the digit around inside him, feeling his inner walls, pistoning his finger at a certain angle to prod at his prostate. Draco’s eyes rolled into the back of his head at the toe-curling sensation.
“I dunno. I just have this feeling, that all your shit talking is really just an attempt to cover up how badly you want to snog his face off.”
The idea of Harry tasting himself while eating him out was insurmountably hot, and it was everything Draco could do not to come on the spot, completely untouched.
Draco couldn’t very well tell his psychiatric evaluator, who was responsible for when he would get the hell out of here, that he wanted to work with potions, now, could he?”
“ . . . Now you’re saying all these things, and calling me beautiful, and you just want to sleep with me again. You miss me that much, that’s the only thing you miss, I know it is, you will only ever love my
“You conniving snake,” said Draco. “Why did you send him? I was doing fine before he told me he loved me.”
He knew Pansy would be destroyed. She loved him dearly. He was selfish to do this to her, but he couldn’t carry on any longer. He was stuck in an endless cycle, and he was too afraid to work himself out of it, and Harry, the center and beating heart of the wizarding world, hated him.
“Let’s get this off you, hmm?” Potter murmured, dipping a hand beneath Draco and coaxing him into a sitting position. Draco shrugged the garment off himself with ease, discarding it on the floor next to Potter’s jumper. Draco began getting to work on his belt, but then he felt a large pair of hands over his, halting his movements.
“Before I touch you here,” he said, squeezing Draco’s arse before moving his hand away to safer terrain, “I’d touch your cock. I’d pump you just the way you like, nice and hard, before I blow you so well your legs are shaking and your toes are curling.”
“Fuck the rules right now,” Harry said softly. “Some things are more important. What did she say to you that made you this upset?”
Harry had murmured the first time he’d taken Draco home and fucked him. And Draco, giddy off the high of Harry, had stupidly agreed. Now he was in too deep to get out.
“I’d play with your balls until they were bulging and purple, filled with your hot, sticky come that you love to release down my throat. But you’re not coming yet. I haven’t even touched you yet.”
because you were with that Weasel girl. Now I know the truth, but can you imagine being in my head when I saw that firecall?”
“Harry, I . . . I need you to know this isn’t the end,” said Draco. “I just need some time to think. That’s all.”
“You are dead to me,” he told her, nonchalant as could be, Malfoy mask falling perfectly into place. “Now get the fuck out of my floo.”
Debbie sighed. “Once we transfer you to the psychiatric unit, you’ll be taken for a meal. Maybe you’ll be hungry then.”
name. “That’s . . . That’s beautiful,” he said, leaning in toward Potter, who did not back away. He was aware that their thighs were nearly brushing; he felt a heat pool in the pit of his gut, a thrill he hadn’t experienced in a long time. Not since before . . .
Thank you to everyone so far who has commented on my work. It means the world to me, and I appreciate it more than anything. I check my inbox religiously, it's actually sort of a problem . . . Well, anyways, without any further ado, here's the chapter :)
Draco knew Harry deserved better. He was being selfish by dragging him down. He deserved to be with Weasley, to start a family. It sounded like that was what Harry wanted.
“I only said it to get you into bed. Isn’t it obvious? I don’t love you. I don’t think anyone ever could.” His green eyes bore into grey.
When Draco returned with filled glasses, he sat down and experienced a headrush. He was already feeling the effects of the whiskey, which was embarrassing, because he didn’t want Potter to think he was some lightweight who couldn’t handle his liquor (even though that’s exactly what he was). So he waited for it to pass, staring straight ahead. He’d also sat closer to Potter on the couch than he had been sitting before, which was endlessly more embarrassing.
Now was the part where Draco didn’t know how to act. He never spent the night after sex; he always apparated home. They also never fucked in the middle of the day, so this was uncharted territory.
That was . . . A really good point. Perhaps Harry was a smidge more insightful than Draco had given him credit for.
Draco gasped again as Potter placed his other hand on the side of his face and just looked at him for a minute, with those striking green eyes. Then he was leaning in to press a kiss on top of Draco’s head, and Draco couldn’t help but look up. Potter’s face ended up right in front of Draco’s instead, and Draco found himself leaning in, nerves on fire. Potter closed his eyes and closed the gap between them, pressing his lips ever so softly against Draco’s.
“You heard me. Why not? She can give you everything you need, and here you are wasting time with me instead.”
“You don’t know what it was to me. I haven’t told you yet.” Now Draco was being blatantly closed-off, but he couldn’t seem to help himself. Potter was approaching the topic as though Draco were a landmine, and Draco just wanted to have a
“Then why did you take it back?” Draco asked, feeling like he wrenched the question out of himself like a sword in his side.
“I promise I won’t try to hex you in your sleep,” Harry teased, and Draco wanted to rip his own hair out because he was so
“Why are you telling me about it?” Draco asked. “It sounds like you’ve been miserable there for a while. You’ve had your fill of chasing Dark wizards. The choice seems fairly obvious to me.”
“I had to be,” Draco answered. “I had finally made my father proud. It was something I always . . . Something I’d wanted to do for a long time.”
Potter’s face did something that made Draco nervous- he almost looked worried. “That’s . . . That’s really not fucking okay. I don’t have personal experience, but I’ve heard those hurt. A lot.”
Harry popped his mouth off Draco’s cock, taking in his heaving form with pride. Only Harry got to see him like this. Got to reduce him to this.
“Oh god,” Harry choked out, kneeling down and moving Draco so he was lying face up. His chest was still as a statue. Next to his limp hand was an empty bottle of off-brand painkillers.
After giving it some careful thought, Harry realized that owling Narcissa wasn’t going to be enough- he’d have to go see her in person.
He slumped back against the bed, panting, as Draco withdrew his mouth from his cock with an obscene pop, wearing a devious smirk.
“Merlin and Morgana.” Draco rubbed his hands across his face before resuming eye contact with Harry. “You just said you want to talk to me because it’s the
Draco had been wrung dry. He’d cried all his tears into Pansy, thoroughly soaking her shoulder. He didn’t even think he had the energy to cry he was so tired.
Harry closed his eyes in exasperation. “You don’t know the full story. Why I had to do what I did. But I’m going to tell you everything, if you’ll just-”
His hands were shaking while he poured the tumbler of whiskey into the glasses, and when he was finished he grabbed two ice cubes from the ice maker and dropped them in his own glass. Willing his hands to stay steady, he carried the drinks into the living room and handed Potter his as he took a seat beside him on the sofa. Close enough to be slightly suggestive, far enough away to ensure that Draco’s boundaries would not be crossed.
“I have just the thing,” said Draco, gesturing for Harry to follow him. Harry couldn’t get over just how much more . . .
“Ginny, I . . . I want you to know I’ll be here for you,” he said. The words battled against every instinct he had to kick and scream and shout like the infant they were going to have. Merlin, Christ, he was going to be a
He pulled his finger out, quickly replacing it with two. Draco groaned at the added stretch, feeling his hole strain to accommodate the digits.
Cold and clinical he could handle. Sweet and warm and kind was uncharted territory, and even if Draco had a map it would have been no use.
The conversation thinned out, and eventually it was time for everyone to head to class. Draco told the others he’d stay behind a minute, and it only took a bit of convincing for them to believe that he was alright to be by himself.
“You must already know I’m incredibly disappointed in you,” Pansy said as they began walking to the point of apparition.
“She took it better than I thought,” Harry said in lieu of a greeting when Draco entered through his floo.
Ropes of white hot come spurted from his aching cock, as dizzying pleasure surged through his spine. His orgasm lasted for several seconds, longer than normal. When he came back to earth, panting, he turned around to see Harry smiling softly at him.
and well-dressed, and he’d leave with his three vials of Peace. Draco, however, was beginning to go crazy. Why did Potter keep coming back? Who did he need the Draughts for? Were they for himself?
Once he paid Draco the amount he owed, he pocketed the change and accepted the bagged product from Draco.
“You’ll only confuse him more, heavens knows he’s been through enough. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to St. Mungo’s right now to see him.”
Not soon enough Harry’s fingers were deserting him, leaving him wide open, and then Draco felt the tip of Harry’s cock breach his throbbing entrance.
Harry watched helplessly as Draco hurriedly unbuttoned his baby blue dress shirt, growling in frustration when his normally dexterous fingers slipped off a button.
Draco felt hot tears prick at the corners of his eyes. He blinked rapidly to rid himself of the rude intrusion.
tell me to calm down,” Draco ordered thunderously, stopping in his tracks to speak before resuming his pacing.
“I just wanted to make sure you were okay,” Harry continued, stepping closer to him. “You seemed pretty upset when you left, and . . . Honestly, I didn’t want to leave you alone.”
“I want to name her Rose. I haven’t told Ron yet, because I’m nervous he won’t like it, but something deep inside me is telling me that she’s a Rose. Does that make sense? I’m not making sense, am I?”
Harry got him the water and sat down, and the two began to eat. Most of the meal was passed in relative silence, mainly because Harry was scarving down his food like a ravenous dog and Draco didn’t know how the fuck to start a conversation with this secret hanging over his head. Funny how Draco was used to silent meals with his family, but with Harry it felt wrong.
He followed her through the corridor into the sitting room, where she had a house elf fetch them some tea.
And Harry sank into him- slowly, because Draco had a low pain tolerance, turns out, and preferred it when Harry gave him time to adjust as opposed to ramming all the way in at once.
“Good evening, my love,” Harry greeted, taking his hands in his and bringing them up to his lips softly, kissing them delicately.
“More rewarding than selling, that’s for sure,” Draco said jokingly, but Potter frowned at him and stopped in his tracks.
Then Potter was pulling away from him, leaving Draco feeling so empty, and all he wanted was those lips back on his, and he was supposed to take things slow, but he didn’t
“I only work here, remember?” he asked with a slight bite to his tone as he recorded Potter’s items one by one before placing them back in the bag. He told Potter the total amount, and Potter paid him.
“Well, it’s not like money’s tight,” Ron said with a good-natured chuckle. Hermione elbowed him in the ribs.
“They slept together about a week and a half ago,” said Pansy. “He’ll know in about three weeks’ time whether she’s pregnant.”
He was in a white room, on a pale, blue bed, and the overwhelming scent of sterilization pervaded his nostrils. Wait a minute . . .
Draco wanted to laugh, because that trial was hardly fair. The wizengamot had wanted to make an example out of him, and it was only due to Potter’s testimony that he wasn’t rotting away in Azkaban with his father.
“I . . . I . . . I didn’t think about stopping and talking,” Draco admitted, feeling on the verge of tears. “I just wanted to keep kissing you and forget about it.”
Harry scooped them bacon and eggs, then while Draco sat awkwardly at the table by himself Harry poured himself a cup of coffee, and asked Draco if he’d like any. Draco politely declined.
Harry’s come flooded his arse, filling him deep, hot and sticky. Draco nearly collapsed, on the verge of orgasm himself, but then Harry was saying,
“I-I . . .” Draco looked incredibly flustered, and to Harry’s dismay he sighed and wiped at his own face. He wasn’t
Potter laughed, boisterous and beautiful again. The windchimes were back in full swing, and this time, Draco could hear them as if they were right next to him.
“So much,” agreed Narcissa. “I spent so long neglecting to show him I loved him, and now he’s pushing me away. I also think I remind him of everything that happened here. I can see it in his eyes, when he looks at me. I only want to spend the rest of my life proving how much he means to me, but he never responds to my letters.”
“Really, Harry? You come into my home, and accuse me of wanting to h-hurt myself? What a preposterous accusation.”
Draco’s lip wobbled as he brought the blade to his skin again and tore up more flesh, scraping and cutting and demolishing like a bulldozer to a building.
“Can I do this?” Potter asked him quietly, eyes boring deep into Draco’s. Draco, feeling as though he were about to fall off his barstool, could only nod. Potter rubbed Draco’s hand softly. Draco knew his hand was trembling; it had to be. There was no way Potter could touch him without setting him aflame.
came Hermione’s soothing voice, which only made Harry ache more. “I suspected Malfoy wouldn’t come around at first; it’s going to take some time. But don’t give up. If you show him you really care, he’ll eventually realize that.”
Potter hummed, chuckling as he kissed down Draco’s chest one more time, all the while easing Draco’s legs apart even more until he was completely spread-eagle on the sofa. By the time Potter had kissed all the way down his stomach and stopped just before his cock, Draco was panting heavily, filled to the brim with anticipation. He and Potter were about to have sex. Potter didn’t know he was demi. Was this okay? Was he deceiving Potter?
Harry was diverting the subject of conversation because Draco had hit a sensitive note. But Draco couldn’t deny any of the things he’d said with a wand held to his head.
“There was no sale,” Draco blurted out, and honestly, trust his mouth to betray him at the worst of times.
Potter’s hands traveled from his hair down his face, all the way down past his neck and shoulders, and to his ribs where they began lightly smoothing his clothed sides up and down, up and down. Draco shuddered into his touch.
Draco hadn’t meant to bring up the war, he really hadn’t. He only wanted to hear that boisterous, beautiful laugh again that rang like wind chimes in his ears. But instead he got criticism. What else did he expect?
“Malfoy, rape is a serious thing,” said Potter, “and I may not be an Auror, but Ron is. And I know they don’t take that lightly, no matter who it is.”
“I’m demisexual,” Draco said, instantly avoiding eye contact in favor of staring at his half-eaten eggs.
. I like taking that sweet, juicy arse bent over for me. Knowing that all it takes is a few soft touches and you’ll fall to putty right in my hands. Do you like that, Draco? I think you do.”
know whether Draco would have the courage to apologize. There was still so much they didn’t know about each other, and while it was obvious in some regards that Draco had changed, there were still many layers of his person to peel back that Harry hadn’t a clue whether he’d be ready to step up.
“Would you like anything? Tea?” Potter asked, and he looked so kissable that Draco wanted to pounce on him, hold on tight and never let him go.
what he was doing, it was too late. Draco had already sunk his claws into him, and he had no choice but to hide it from Ron.
“You don’t have to do anything,” Harry said, so gently it hurt. “All you have to do is be yourself and forgive yourself.”
“I just don’t want this to change the way you see me,” Potter continued, rubbing his nose. “I don’t want you to think of me as some . . . Some
Over the past few weeks, they’d gotten to know little things about each other. Things that didn’t seem important, but were.
“Oh, shut up,” Draco chided. “I’m sure your Muggle relatives spoiled you with loads of them. Not all of us grew up as lucky as you.”
“Fine, you want to play it like that? You want to kick every last person out of your life who still cares about you? Have it your way. Consider me gone.”
“So,” said Potter, twirling his glass as though it were wine to mix its contents. “I have to tell you, I never thought I’d see the inside of Draco Malfoy’s Muggle flat.”
try to come in here and rip my life apart. You don’t know what it took for me to finally find peace, and I’m not about to destroy that for the greater good of the wizarding world or whatever other bullshit you were spewing. I’m fine and
Harry pulled away, and in the dimmed lights of his flat, his imploring eyes looked especially green.
Potter kissed him then, sloppily and hungrily, growling into his mouth and grinding down his hips on top of Draco’s. The friction was maddening, and Draco found himself arching up into the touch, starving for more.
“I-I dunno,” Draco said, fiddling with the sheets as his nerves grew. “I don’t . . . Really go anywhere except work and the store. But it’s fine. I was really fine, until . . .” He cut himself off when his eyes began to water dangerously, and he swallowed thickly.
Draco felt anger for Harry in that moment, searing hot anger. For telling his mother about their relationship before Draco had the chance to.
Draco scoffed. He gripped his left arm, which was odd to Harry, but he reasoned there were more important things to focus on.
Potter waved the bartender over and ordered another round of drinks. He handed the woman a few notes before Draco could even reach for his wallet.
“You’re so sexy like this,” Potter murmured, leaning down to plant a kiss on Draco’s lips. “So unbelievably sexy.”
His mother was a touchy subject at best, and on a day like today just thinking about her was enough to make him want to curl up into a ball and never unravel.
want to tell him. So much, even though he was terrified out of his mind. Not another soul knew about this, not even Pansy or Mother. Right now, up in his head, all it could ever be was a memory. But he was afraid that by telling, that would make it real. Tangible.
Parkinson immediately looked like she regretted every decision she’d ever made on this earth. “Oh god . . .”
Firm, aggressive, demanding hands, pushing him down on his front. Spreading his cheeks apart. Muffling his cries. Before he was entered swiftly and severely, brutally. Blood trickling down his legs, soiling his creamy white sheets. Growls in his ear that he was a slut, a filthy Death Eater, and deserved to die.
“Hermione, I never got the chance to formally apologize to you for all the awful things I said to you in school,” said Draco, wringing his hands. “It was terrible of me to treat you that way. You didn’t deserve it. You’re the brightest witch I know, and it doesn’t matter what your blood type is. I’m sorry.”
Which is why several minutes later when Draco’s wrist tingled, with an incoming message, he nearly doubled over in shock.
“Hey, this isn’t a competition about who has it worse, alright?” Potter said, sounding slightly agitated. Draco’s chest squeezed again for having instilled that emotion in him.
“I was fine before Harry came along and disrupted my life,” said Draco. “Now that he’s out of it, everything will go back to normal, and I’ll be fine.”
with the way things were, and you had to go and mess it up by telling him to come here on the worst possible night-”
“I-I’m okay,” Draco lied even as another tear rolled down his face. “I just . . .I can’t . . . This is . . . I didn’t get her anything-”
Draco smiled softly at him, realizing that this wasn’t the end. Potter was only respecting what he’d asked him to do, and they could continue this conversation another day once Draco got his bearings.
Guilt wrapped itself around Draco’s chest and squeezed like a cobra. He’d been the one to enforce the rule. He could have been nice and let Potter get away with it. Who would Potter tell? But he’d been a stickler because he’d wanted
Narcissa’s tone was raw, wounded. Harry’s heart ached for her. Not for the first time, he yearned for his own parents.
He thought of the Death Eaters and the Dark Lord probing his mind, goading him for information that he tucked deep, deep away in the very back corners of his head. He shuddered.
“I thought my lack of a response to your letters was a clear enough message, but apparently I was mistaken.”
“Does this feel nice?” Harry asked as he rubbed the loofah under Draco’s pits, across his stomach, and down his creamy thighs.
“I’ll be able to feel all your emotions while I’m in your head, too,” Harry told him, taking one of Draco’s hands and stroking the skin softly. “I’ll notice if you’re feeling distressed, or uncomfortable, so if that feeling arises at any point I’ll pull away from that part of your head and leave it alone.”
“It sounds like you need to relax.” Draco walked until he was close enough to Harry to touch, and he placed his hands on Harry’s shoulders, thumbs making small circles over the fabric of his robes. “I can blow you so well your entire body will quake from the force of it. If I’m feeling generous, I’ll even let you come down my throat.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco blurted out, not wanting to be dramatic but unable to watch the worry lines in Pansy’s forehead crease any longer.
“Do you see why I have a hard time believing you?” Harry asked him, still holding onto him, walking him over to the reading area. “Here, you should probably sit.”
Glancing at Potter, Draco didn’t immediately see signs of sleep deprivation. Potter must have either glamored off the effects, which fractured his heart the smallest amount, or they must have only just started, and he was taking preventative measures. Draco sincerely hoped it was the latter.
“Mione, I’m surprised you aren’t more curious. I’m the one asking all the questions. Normally you’d be all over this.”
“It’s fine.” Draco stood up, glass tight in his hand. “I’m going to pour myself another. Would you like one?”
Draco immediately took his hand off his cock, mind melting to mush as Harry’s order washed over him and made him feel all fuzzy.
“Don’t you say it,” Harry commanded her, pointing his finger at the Floo. “Don’t you dare say he might have anyway. I pushed him over the edge.”
Annie frowned. “How has this affected your relationship with your mother? How does she feel about your sexual orientation?”
Sure enough, a tall, now-less thin blonde with stormy grey eyes and elegant, pointy features emerged into view carrying a clipboard of paperwork tucked under his arm. He wore a set of finely tailored robes, instead of those god-awful Muggle clothes that he’d practically swum in.
And Harry was falling into him, his umbrella falling to the floor with a wet patter. He gripped him so tightly Draco nearly stumbled with the weight of him. Harry kicked the door closed and pressed himself tightly against Draco’s body, gripping him almost painfully hard with violently shaking hands and resting his head on Draco’s shoulder.
“Not that this hasn’t been fun, because it has,” he said smoothly, dusting down his shirt and spelling the table clean. “But I think it’s time for you to go.”
It was wet, and very, very intimate. Draco didn’t think he’d ever been kissed quite so delicately before, like he was made of glass, like he was something fragile to be handled with care. It made his heart sink a little, because if that was all Potter saw him as . . .
Defeated, Draco padded into the kitchen where he kept a notepad and pens on his counter. He wrote down his floo information and gave it to Potter.
to him? That would be . . . Well, that would be perfect, in Draco’s opinion, and Draco didn’t deserve perfect. Not after what he’d done.
He groaned, wanting to rip his own hair out. He’d worked so hard at this, and now he’d have to start all over.
“I know it can be a really scary thing, Draco, but you will feel so much better once you’ve let me in. And this doesn’t just go one way. I would never ask to go in your head if I weren’t equally ready to let you in mine.”
“Draco . . .” Mother sighed again, squeezing his hand. “You can’t do it for me. You need to do it for yourself.”
“You didn’t overreact.” Potter’s voice was sobering enough to make Draco squirm from the force of it.
“You don’t mean that,”  said Harry, and his voice broke. “You’re angry. And upset. You’re only saying that.”
“But, erm, a couple of years ago, I was at a wizarding club, and I took somebody home.” Draco ran a hand through his overgrown blonde hair in desperate need of a trim. He sighed, realizing that fixating on his hair wasn’t going to make telling this story any easier.
“I know someday you’re going to get tired of waiting for me when I take longer to heal than you expect. Because that’s just it, Harry. While I’m still like this, there’s no hope for us. I’ll sink back in all the way and lose all semblance of self-respect. I’ll let you use me. I’ll-”
“So, let me get this straight. He firecalls you, then sees you with Ginny, automatically jumps to the worst case scenario, and blocks you from contacting him again. Sounds about right.”
Harry frowned, stepping closer to him. “I was stupid, Draco. I thought Ginny was going to take away our child.”
When the house elf answered and offered to take his jacket, Harry accepted politely and was ushered inside.
“Mhm,” Harry agreed, sounding affected himself for a change. He rocked his hips back, pulling out halfway before slamming back in.
Potter’s lips thinned out to a little crisp. “I’m sorry, Malfoy. It isn’t your fault. It’s just . . . One of my patients died today.”
He failed to mention that Draco currently wanted nothing to do with him, and the likelihood of a conversation about his mother going favorably was slim to none. But Narcissa had sounded so sad, and Harry wanted to make her feel better. And who knew? If Draco ever let him in again, Harry could try it.
Draco braced his hands on Potter’s shoulders, smiling down at him, leaning in to steal a kiss. Potter hummed into his mouth, then Draco was slowly sinking down onto Potter’s cock.
Annie looked up from her notepad, raising a thin eyebrow at him. She stared for several seconds, as though something odd had sprouted on his head, then she returned to her notes, scribbling away.
, almost as though he were something special, something worth looking at. “Here we are. Long way since our school days, huh?”
“Draco, please don’t walk away from me again. You aren’t a body to me, you never have been. Fuck, Draco, I need you. I fucking
“That being said, you lost your chance to be with my son when you broke his heart,” said Narcissa, turning around and gesturing for Harry to follow her. Harry followed her into the sitting room.
Draco scoffed. “You’re talking to me like I don’t know that. I stayed with him in spite of that. It was easy, having no labels. But then we got in a fight, about something personal I do not wish to share today, and I blocked his . . . cell phone number. So he went and slept with his ex-girlfriend.”
“What is it about him, exactly? That he was a Death Eater? He’s paid for that, in full. And then some, if you ask me. He’s hated so deeply by our society that he took it upon himself to leave and shack up in Muggle London, where no one will ever find him.”
I just wanted to say again thank you for all the wonderful feedback you guys have left me on this story so far. It means everything :)
Potter looked up at him, open-mouthed, and he almost looked in awe. Maybe, Draco thought deliriously, he was.
Draco didn’t think anyone had ever quite so tenderly handled him before during sex, and it opened up the floodgates of emotions he’d have rather kept hidden. He gasped as Potter found his prostate again and pistoned his fingers to hit it every time, ruthlessly abusing that little bundle of nerves that delivered so much white-hot pleasure to Draco. He tossed his head back, crying out in earnest as Potter continued to finger him into oblivion.
“I heard what you said.” Ron looked utterly aghast, and his skin had paled considerably. He looked like he was going to be sick.
“Draco, listen, about the other week,” Harry began, “with Ginny . . . She wasn’t over for what you think she was. I swear it. She and I were just broom shopping together, and she stopped at mine after for a cuppa. That’s it.”
Potter held Draco’s leg open with one hand while the other moved past his balls, past his perineum, to the tight little ring of rosy muscle. The finger circled around his entrance, lubing him up, before slipping inside.
“Oh, nothing, just . . . You’re cute when you’re in denial,” Pansy chided. “It’s written all over your face.”
“Hey, don’t make fun. Molly made this for me,” he said good-naturedly, ushering Draco inside. Draco set down his umbrella and followed Potter into the sitting room.
All too suddenly, he was being Apparated into Harry’s bedroom upstairs, and the door closed behind him. Harry threw him down on the bed and climbed on top of him, locking his lips with his and pinning both his thin, delicate wrists above his head. Draco was panting impossibly hard, and Harry hadn’t even
“I can’t believe you’re in my head,” said Draco. “It feels . . . Weird. Really weird. But I like it. I like it a lot.”
How dare he? Potter didn’t know what kind of friend he was, the awful way he’d treated Greg. How he’d pushed Pansy and Blaise away during sixth year, and never truly gotten them back. Pansy may still be a part of his life, and regularly made efforts to contact him and see him, but it would only be a matter of time until she realized how shitty of a person Draco really was and let him be.
New Years was celebrated with a mix of everybody. Draco had gotten back in touch with Greg, and he’d patched things over completely with Blaise. Ron and Hermione threw the party at their flat, and when the clock chimed midnight Harry and Draco kissed as though they were the only two people in the room.
“Shhh, sweetheart, shhh,” Mother whispered, rocking him back and forth like a baby. Draco did his best to suppress a sob. “I know. I know.”
“You’re one to talk,” Draco seethed, setting his cuppa down and pointing a finger at her. “You’re too afraid to tell Blaise how you feel about him, so you two have been dancing around your feelings for years-”
“It’s alright,” Potter said gently, turning toward Draco and offering him his hand. Draco, humiliated, took it and stood up himself. “I’ve an early morning at the hospital, anyways. I should be off.”
Draco’s vision was blurred with tears. His face scrunched up as he allowed them to fall, one by one. Potter’s horrified face swam into view.
“And listen to me. Harry may have hurt you deeply, but he saved your life. For that, we have him to thank. You wouldn’t be sitting here talking to me right now if he hadn’t gone into your flat when he did, do you understand?”
As if Pansy could read his thoughts, she tilted her head and sighed exasperatedly. “Draco, your poor self esteem is really getting old.”
“Hello?” Harry asked, curious. He took a tentative step forward, feeling the wooden boards creak under his feet.
“You ready, baby?” Harry asked, and he saw Draco tense up slightly before nodding. Frowning, Harry reached for him.
Draco thought back to all the times Harry had said “I love you” to him as he fucked him so brutally his body felt like it was part of the mattress. Did he?
Draco opened his eyes, and the sheer effort left him winded and exhausted. He drew in a deep breath as he took in his surroundings.
Draco sighed, rolling onto his back, and Harry spelled both Draco and the sheets clean. Or, as clean as they could be. Harry had a feeling Draco would still want to bathe.
Draco found himself worrying so much for Potter that he ironically felt the need to take his own Draught of Peace.
“Why did you come to see me today, Harry?” Draco asked, willing his voice not to waver. His control was slipping rapidly like water through his fingers.
“No, I mean yes, I mean . . .” It was Harry’s turn to look exasperated. “I don’t appreciate being given a taste of my own medicine, Draco.”
“I-I can’t help it,” Draco said, hiccupping. “It’s all so much, I don’t know what to do with all their-”
“Hey, hey, what do you mean?” Harry’s gentle tone shattered Draco into pieces. “It was never about using you. I told you in that letter I lied to you because I was afraid.”
“Ginny, I care about you a lot,” he said, standing aside from the door frame to let her in. Ginny slowly walked into the house, keeping her eyes on Harry. “But-”
Draco thought of Harry wrapping Ginny close and telling her he loved her. Whispering in her ear how Draco meant nothing to him, how it had been her all along.
“What’s going to happen, once I go to the psychiatric ward?” Draco asked, trying to sound as nonchalant as possible, which certainly wasn’t working.
“You like my best friend enough to use his first name.” Harry was grinning ear to ear, flowing to the brim with happiness.
“Harry, you aren’t in a right state of mind right now,” Draco said as stoically as he could with Harry
Draco, who was currently in pajamas, said he’d need thirty minutes to freshen up, and that he’d be right over.
Harry talked him down, telling him that the Weasleys were kind and caring and understanding people, who accepted anybody who made Harry happy as long as they weren’t a serial killer or something equally sinister, which Draco certainly was not, Harry made sure to tell him. Because although it had almost been a year since the incident, Harry never wanted to let Draco forget again that he was not a killer.
It only took a few more strokes for Draco to spasm to completion, and his orgasm rippled through him like a rocket. He deflated onto the mattress, breathing heavily as Harry withdrew his fingers. Draco pulled him into an insatiable kiss, and they snogged until Draco’s toes were curling and he had eased off Harry’s trousers, gripping his leaking shaft and pumping hard.
Potter sighed, raking a hand through his black, curly hair. “I have nightmares,” he said, as if that were some big revelation.
“This one’s also a delight,” Potter said, pointing to another option further down on the menu. That burger came with bacon, tomatoes, lettuce, and Monterey jack cheese. But Draco could no longer focus on the burgers because he was engulfed in Potter’s
He sensed Harry’s grin. “These are almost done,” the Gryffindor said. “Would you mind grabbing us plates? Second cupboard from the left.”
“Then I’ll be here waiting for you as soon as you are,” Harry said, and his tone was so casual, so nonchalant, that Draco didn’t know whether he wanted to laugh or scream.
A second finger joined the first. As Harry scissored and stretched him, Draco began fucking himself back on Harry’s fingers, just because he knew Harry hated it when he did that. Also because it felt insanely good.
Potter’s smoldering stare softened, and his lips curled up in a small smile. “Anything you like, Malfoy.”
“I’ve always admired your bravery,” Draco admitted bashfully, feeling his cheeks stain pink. “You wear your emotions on your sleeve, almost begging to be read. You’re an open book. You see the best in people, almost to a dangerous fault. You’re that
“Maybe I don’t want to talk about this anymore,” said Draco. “It’s humiliating enough that you all know; why should we dwell on it?”
“Incase you’re forgetting, he stalked you for an entire year,” said Pansy. “That’s gotta mean something.”
Potter picked up on the change in atmosphere, for he reached for Draco’s hand again. Draco let him take it.
“I see a change in you,” Potter said to him, allowing Draco to touch him and caress his calloused hands. “An admirable change. You’ve grown.”
“Draco, sweetheart . . .” The pet name slipped out so easily it scared Harry. “I’m restraining myself so much it physically
Next thing he knew someone was by his side, murmuring soothing things in his ear, coaxing him to breathe and relax. But this only panicked him further, for he didn’t
Was Harry toxic? He had stayed with Draco all through the night while he was asleep. That had to mean something. Right? His feeble mind grasped for answers that felt just out of reach.
Draco felt something warm spread through his sternum. The idea of Potter paying for his meal, like this was an actual
It was a pastel, baby-blue, Draco’s favorite color, with a large D stitched across the front. He found himself choking up, tears pooling in his eyes.
“I’m not letting anything else happen,” Harry told her quickly. “I’m forbidding it, until you and I square things away. I’m here to ask for your blessing.”
“I’m close,” Draco choked out, tightening his legs around Harry’s waist, sweaty hands gripping his shoulders.
As soon as the words were out he realized he’d spoken out of term. Draco’s face crumpled, and twisted, but only for a moment before it was reworked back into his classic, signature sneer.
Harry put an arm around Draco’s back, wordlessly maneuvering him to lean into the warm body. Draco was hardly in a state to refuse, and Harry’s touch felt so
for this. I don’t know why I feel the way I do about him. But I just do, alright? Now, I’d appreciate it if you were actually fucking supportive instead of making this all about you.”
White-hot anger coursed through Draco. As usual, Harry had the uncanny ability to rouse multiple emotions simultaneously.
“Yeah,” said Draco, knowing that this could be it between him and Harry. He drew in a deep breath, willing himself to calm down. “C-Could you . . . Erm, I mean, there’s something I want to talk to you about.”
“When my child’s with me, you don’t control who he sees,” said Harry. Although his chances of ever seeing Draco again were slim, Ginny didn’t need to know that.
A month ago, or two, Draco would have snapped in defense of his actions. But today, he only swallowed thickly and sighed remorsefully. “Yes, I did.”
Once he was inside, he noticed the inside of the house smelled . . . extra pleasant. Had Harry cleaned?
“You . . . You can’t just throw an ultimatum on me like that.” Harry frustratedly adjusted the collar of his shirt. He was so exhausted from this god forsakenly horrible evening.
“Alright, Harry. I’m going to take that bath now,” Draco said, breathy and shrill, as he walked quickly over to his coat rack and handed Harry his coat. “It was good seeing you, as always, but-”
Narcissa’s eyebrows pinched together. “Draco can’t do sexual relationships,” she said instantly. “I know my son. He’s far too emotional.”
“Gonna take such good care of you tonight, baby,” Harry murmured, pressing a kiss against Draco’s temple. “Gonna make you feel so good. So, so good.”
Draco was grateful for the words of support, although he had the smallest feeling they were empty. His friends knew there wasn’t anything that could be done; it wasn’t like he could force Potter to interact with him. Potter avoided him like the plague.
Draco’s heart felt as though it were stepping outside into the sun after a thousand years locked away in the rain. The bare branches of his soul were teeming with new, budding, green life.
Potter cleared his throat, looking Draco deep in the eye. “I feel like . . . I feel like we sort of just let that kiss happen and didn’t really talk about it.”
Draco nodded. He watched as Potter finished the rest of his drink, setting the glass down on the coffee table with a hard thunk.
better ways to solve that situation. And you chose the one that would leave him tattered in pieces? Why didn’t you come to us first? We would have helped you!”
“Bookshop in London,” Harry answered. “I was originally going to pick something up for Teddy, but then I just . . . Kept going back, I guess. I have a whole stack of books he recommended to me that I still have to read.”
Potter hummed again, hands tightening around his arse, and that did it for Draco. With a strangled cry he came down Potter’s throat as pleasure erupted in the pit of his stomach, momentarily wiping his vision.
“Draco . . .” Pansy shook her head at him as he took a seat on the sofa as far away from her as possible. “We’re really worried about you.”
Draco let out an audible sigh as Potter murmured a spell and Draco felt a cooling sensation spread throughout the inside of his hole. Potter had cleansed him magically. He nearly whined it was so hot. His cock began to fill rapidly again. Draco sagged into the pillows, releasing a big breath as Potter murmured another spell, this one for lubrication.
“Well, maybe I’m afraid to tell you my favorite color,” said Draco. “Maybe I’m afraid that you’ll take my favorite color and use it against me. And I won’t be able to tell anybody else my favorite color.”
This all felt very disgustingly domestic as Draco retrieved the dishes, and his instincts were telling him to run away, to get the hell out while he still could. But he was fooling himself if he thought he could escape unscathed. He was doomed the moment he had let Harry touch him.
“Lately it’s been hard,” said Draco carefully. “My appetite’s not the best these days.” He decided to leave out the part where some days he was so afraid to leave his home in fear that someone would find him and hex him that his stomach would twist and cramp up and shrivel into nothingness until the mere idea of food had him hurling over a toilet.
“Draco . . . You’re my son. I worry about you all the time, even when you’re healthy and happy. It’s what mothers
“Well,” said Harry, scratching his head, “I was going to ask you if you’d ever feel comfortable using Legilimency in a . . . erm, sexual setting.”
Sometimes when Harry and Draco were in bed, Harry would let it slip that he loved him. Harry just always figured it was a heat-of-the-moment, sexually-driven thing, catalyzed by his raging hormones and Draco’s beautiful body that flexed and writhed for him in the sheets. But now he began to wonder if it meant something more.
“I didn’t mean it,” Harry said again, this time looking at him so directly Draco wished he’d look away.
Hermione looked down at her plate. Harry, on the other hand, felt a deep, burning blush coat his cheeks.
“Still want to hear that beautiful voice,” Harry told him with another kiss to his leg as he wandlessly spelled his fingers with lube.
“Don’t be.” Potter waved it aside as if it meant nothing, which pained Draco. “It was a long time ago. I’m over it now.”
Harry’s face softened, and he took a step closer to Draco. “That was nice of you, but why’d you think if you were running a successful apothecary that’s far cheaper than the one on Diagon that you’d never see me again?”
manners. I wasn’t about to bring up the topic of sex at the table, and ruin a perfectly good evening. It’s also rude when someone else is paying.”
Draco allowed the clinking of plates and the dull rumble of chatter and conversation from the restaurant to fill his ears, while Potter looked at him some more.
“So,” he said, swallowing thickly as he felt the alcohol begin to take its effect on him, “are Granger and Weasley thinking of any baby names yet?”
Narcissa chuckled. “Draco can be awfully prickly at times, but his heart is soft. Well guarded. Those he lets in get to see a side of him he rarely shows otherwise.”
Harry felt his cheeks begin to colour. He most certainly was not flirting with whoever this messenger person was, especially not if they were a man!
“Because it makes me want to do more than kiss you, you wanker. Do you have any idea how hard it is holding myself back?”
Ginny nodded, and the pair made their way over to Harry’s sofa, plopping down and getting comfortable.
, and I’ve never met two people less suited for each other. It’s like you bring out this monstrous side of him, that completely over-clouds his entire persona whenever he’s around you. And in turn, he weakens you and turns you into this spineless, cowering, pathetic
“I’m sorry,” Draco mumbled to his lap, then made eye contact with Potter. “We don’t have to talk about the war. Rather unappetizing, if you ask me. I’m sorry.”
“It’s my godfather, Sirius,” said Potter. “He died fighting for me. I blamed myself for his death for years. Of course, I work on it in therapy, and it’s helped tremendously. But some days, I still blame myself. And that’s okay. I know recovery isn’t linear, and I just keep working at it.”
“I don’t even need to speak,” Draco said in realization as Harry coaxed his legs further apart. “You can see everything.”
“Can we side-along straight from here?” Potter asked, breath ghosting over Draco’s ear. Draco did his best to suppress a shiver.
“Oh, Harry,” he cried, as Harry hugged him tightly to his body, shuddering. Draco’s resolve was beginning to crack, and he knew Harry could sense it.
Every three weeks, like clockwork, Harry came and saw him. Sometimes he bought morning sickness potion, sometimes Sleeping Draughts and Draughts of Peace, which Draco didn’t want to ask about. He knew that was personal, intimate information Harry may not be keen on sharing with him after the way he’d kicked him out of his life.
Harry looked sheepish. His hand was still on Draco’s wrist, drawing the patterns. “I wanted to break the rules, just for today.”
“It’s not fine if it’s upsetting you,” said Annie. “And what you and Harry have sounds far from healthy. You aren’t going to get better if you cannot learn to move on from relationships that are toxic.”
“Mhm,” Harry agreed. As he dove deeper into Draco’s head, memories from his childhood popped up. Memories of Lucius slapping him for arbitrary things, such as speaking out of term or helping a house elf.
“Draco, you’re shaking,” Harry said as gently as he could, noticing not for the first time when they did this the little tremors that wracked his frame.
“A bloke. He was conventionally attractive, as far as people go. And he was rather . . . Possessive of me that night.”
“How so?” asked Harry, and he didn’t look . . . hopeful, or happy, or any of the other emotions he should be experiencing right now if he truly loved Draco.
“Since when do you care about my feelings?” Draco asked. “We established rules for a reason to prevent things from getting
After Draco’s doctor had briefed him on the long-term effects of liver and kidney damage, from having taken so many pills, he reasoned there was a suitable potion to make all that go away, something he would look into later. For the time being, he nodded along to the doctor’s Muggle medication and treatment recommendations.
“No, thank you, I’m sure it will pass soon,” said Draco, unsure why Harry was being so nice to him after how he’d treated him the other day. Harry had surely fucked Weasley again by now, and they would get together soon. Right?
“You hurt him. Deeply,” she said. “He says in his letters and visits that he wants to trust you again, but he doesn’t know how.”
“Oh. You mean Ginny?” Potter had that twinkle in his eye again, and it really wasn’t fair. Draco was not amused, but he nodded in response to Potter’s question.
“That’s normal,” assured Harry. “Just . . . Don’t try and fight it, yeah? I’ll be able to read all your feelings, so I’ll know if you’re uncomfortable. But if you fight it, it won’t be a very good experience for either one of us.”
“Why?” Draco asked. “You could sell it, make a boatload, and find someplace nice that you truly love.”
“Draco, you can’t go on like this. Retreating into your lair after every fuck, just to resurface again once he initates contact is a hideous cycle. Downright rude to your wellbeing, actually.”
“Mhm.” Potter was fixing him with one of those looks again, those looks that Draco couldn’t discern, that cast a warm spell inside him.
They walked out of the pub, and it was still pouring rain, so Potter opened his umbrella with a little pop and invited Draco inside.
“That’s it? You’re sorry? Just slap an ‘I’m sorry’ over my open wound and hope that’ll patch everything over?”
Draco couldn’t keep up with this rapid change of pace. Just minutes ago, he and Harry were simple, no strings. Now Harry was saying he had
to.” Pansy was looking at him, then, hard, and Draco didn’t know whether he wanted to shy away or get all up in her face and tell her to stop
“Do you understand?” Potter continued, scooting closer to him until their knees brushed. “This is not your fault.”
“Cars,” he blurted out, which was the first thing his fretted mind could come up with. “I like cars.”
The nurse tssked at him. “I’m afraid that’s not how it works, sweetie. You’ve been put on suicide watch, and will stay here for the next five days. That is, of course, assuming you follow protocol and stick to your treatment plan.”
“My mother accepts me. But . . . She and my father . . . Don’t exactly have the healthiest relationship. He handles all the finances, or did, before he went to prison. She depends on him for everything, and it wouldn’t bode very well for her to go against his wishes.”
Draco could just see the child running around, with Weasley’s looks and Granger’s brains. He smiled softly to himself.
“You don’t see me freaking out, or leaving the table, do you?” Ron asked. “Although I’d very much like to do both those things, I’m not.”
light headed, and next thing he knew he was crashing to the ground, the book slipping from his hand and landing on the wooden floor with a loud clang.
Draco sighed, stepping closer to the green-eyed man, who had bulked and grown his hair out over the years. It reached just past his shoulders, and today Harry wore it in a curly ponytail.
Draco gasped. Who in their right mind, heroism and glamor aside, would ever give up Harry Potter once they’d gotten ahold of him?
All at once, he was overwhelmed by the amount of memories involving Voldemort. The torturing, both to Draco and to others, the maniacal laughter, the sleepless nights spent hurling over a toilet, missing Mother . . . Harry felt it all.
Ginny’s face hardened. “I remember him calling me a blood traitor when I was a first year and hexing me with dirt, saying I needed to go back to where I came from, anyway.”
Draco was quick to assure her that she made plenty of sense and that she was also full of nonsense; Ron would love the name.
“Alright,” Draco found himself saying, unbelieving of the fact that he’d actually just uttered the words. “I’ll write to them.”
“There’s plenty of car shops around here that are hiring. Do you like fixing cars, or do you prefer selling?”
Draco couldn’t see a Muggle therapist- not if he truly wanted to get better. But how could he explain that to Annie?
Potter’s concerned voice brought him back to earth, and Draco found that he was shaking profusely, with tears welling up in his eyes.
“Draco . . .” For the second time tonight, Harry’s heart snapped in half. “I’m not going to argue and say you aren’t a Death Eater, because you clearly still believe you are one. That’s something you can work on in therapy. But about deserving? You have been through so much, sacrificed so much, did you know you saved us? At the manor? If it hadn’t been for you, we would have gotten caught, and the war might not have been won.”
“This is going to sound stupid,” Potter said, cheeks twinging with blush, “but . . . It reminds me. Of him. And I’m just not . . . I’m not ready to let him go.”
But things hardly went according to plan. On the fourteenth day, like usual, Potter walked in soaking wet.
“There’s nothing I can do to change it, so there’s no use complaining about it,” Draco said, somewhat dryly, for Potter’s concern was beginning to get on his nerves.
“And then I’ll eat you out until you’re begging for my cock, and I still won’t let you come. Not until my cock is inside you.”
And oh, how Draco wanted. He wanted as he watched Potter lean his head onto his elbow, twirling a strand of black, curly hair with his spare hand. It was unfairly sexy.
“So that’s when the pieces started to fall together. I-I wasn’t safe in my own home. So I began kicking and struggling, but the man stunned me and next thing I knew, he was pushing me down on my bed and . . . And . . .”
Harry reached down to the pile of clothes and sorted his own from Draco’s, handing him his pair of trousers and boxers. Draco took them gratefully and began to dress.
“I need to write to your mother again,” said Harry. Sighing, Draco nodded and let him go. Harry’s abdomen was instantly cold without his touch, but not unbearably so. Because this time, he knew Draco was coming back.
“You’re always twisting my words,” Draco said lowly. “Always turning the knife to point at yourself. Always have to be the
Draco’s chest fluttered with nerves. But he nodded, anyway, because it was Potter and he wanted to listen to anything this man had to say.
Harry leaned in again, except this time he took extra care to place his hands on either side of Draco’s rather lovely face and kiss him with such tender fervor that he felt a tremor coming from his lover’s body.
“Okay, okay, okay. We don’t have to talk about this,” Harry told him, feeling as though he were placating a small child. Draco exhaled in visible relief.
“So,” said Draco, forgetting for a moment what they were supposed to be talking about because Potter’s eyes were so
Harry reeled back as though he’d been slapped. “If that’s how you really feel about all this, then maybe I should just go.”
After what felt like both a nanosecond and an eternity Potter moved away from him again and back into his own space. Draco could breathe normally again, and he didn’t know whether to be relieved or disappointed.
“And . . .” Here was the hard part. Draco cleared his throat, steeling himself for the fallout of his words. “I want to do a lot more. Than just kiss. But I . . . I value our friendship. I don’t want to ruin it.”
A not entirely uncomfortable moment of silence stretched between them before Draco cleared his throat, startling Harry out of his trance.
Draco looked back up at him. If he was going to have this conversation, he was going to be mature and do it eye to eye.
“Not everyone gets to have their dream job, Harry. I worked hard to establish a good name for myself here, and people like me. It’s enough.”
“You did,” said Harry, quick to assure her, because he had a feeling if he didn’t his head was going to get hexed off. He had to remind himself that he was here for Draco, that he was doing this for Draco and their future. Not for sex, but for their relationship.
They appeared in an alleyway, and Draco took Potter’s lead as they began walking toward their destination. Draco let go of Potter’s arm, but he was very aware that their shoulders were touching.
“No right telling your mother that you were struggling to leave your flat? You were afraid to so much as walk to the store for two years.”
, and all those years Draco had tormented and bullied him for being a Gryffindor were bubbling up and pointing at him and screaming in his face, and he was
Draco’s hands shook. “It was fine,” he said shortly. “They’re gonna get married, eventually. He always goes back to her.”
He thought of Harry. Those sparkling green eyes. His laughter. His rough, scratchy voice right after they had sex. His incandescent smile that was enough to melt him into a puddle like snow caps on a fresh, dewy spring morning. That would never be directed at Draco again, because all Draco did was drag, drag, drag.
“Why do you think?” Draco asked wetly, swallowing thickly. “People don’t hurt themselves when their lives are going well.”
“And what would the Aurors have done? They despise me. Everybody does. They probably would have ‘forgotten’ about the case.”
“It’s not much,” was the first thing to leave Draco’s mouth as Potter followed him inside, closing the door behind him. While he was taking a look, Draco locked the door.
Harry wandered into the small, homey Apothecary shop that had recently opened. He’d been hearing all about it in the Daily Prophet, but the owner of the shop had decided to remain anonymous. He wondered why, and perhaps if the owner was working he’d be able to get to the bottom of it, of course if they weren’t too busy. Hermione’s morning sickness was still going strong, and he reckoned he’d be able to find something in there that could help her. Otherwise, he’d see about the shop on Diagon.
Draco laughed, stepping closer to Harry. He wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, breathing in his scent.
Potter leaned in closer to him, reaching for him, and a hand found its way onto Draco’s face. Draco gasped softly.
Harry was only human; the words had quite an effect on him. The image of Draco on his knees, sucking Harry dry was lewd and . . . enthralling, to say the least. Harry nearly shuddered from the force of it. But he refrained, because when he looked into Draco’s eyes he saw something else that didn’t quite match his tone.
Next was his hair. He spelled it dry, then combed it until it fell as desired around his ears. Now he was ready to go.
Death Eater, as his Mind Healer was slowly but surely conditioning to switch to- and live happily ever after.
“That’s not going to work,” said Hermione. “She doesn’t want to hear what you think about Malfoy when she hates him that much. She needs to hear that she cannot control who you see. That baby is both of yours, and you can’t let her walk all over you.”
“Your angle. Your intentions. Your game. Take your pick.” Draco nonetheless stepped aside to let Harry in from the cold. He shrugged off his coat and hung it up.
A streak of come leaked out of his hole, past Harry’s mouth, and dribbled down the side of his leg. Harry leaned down to lap it up, taking a moment to savor the flavor of his creamy, smooth skin.
“Yeah,” Draco breathed. “It’s just . . . When you kiss me like that, it’s hard to remember that I’m still a real living, breathing person.”
“How’d it go, mate?” Ron asked him, sounding excited. “Did he take it well? Are you two together now?”
“You don’t get to tell me to listen when you . . . You . . .” Draco cut himself off as he gasped for air, frustrated with himself for being unable to conjure an adequate accusation for Harry’s meddling.
“Harry, I’m not going to tell you what to do with your life. But I will say this. I made it clear I don’t want him around our baby. So, it’s going to be either him, or us.”
Nausea swam through Draco as he thought about Harry and that red-headed Weasel together, their bodies pressed close, tongues dancing together the same way theirs had.
Parkinson had the nerve to look amused. But then her expression quickly turned serious again. “Potter, I think something’s wrong with Draco.”
“Love this scent,” Harry murmured as he began massaging Draco’s wet hair with the product. “Makes your hair smell so sweet and rosy.”
Potter didn’t look settled or satisfied as he paid for the Draughts, and he didn’t immediately leave after Draco handed him his Knuts in change. He just stood there, staring at Draco as though he were trying to pick him apart piece by piece.
, it drives me absolutely crazy! What do you want, Harry? You know what? Until you figure that out, I don’t want anything more to do with you.”
He ran into the bathroom and began to cry into the jumper, then began to cry harder when he realized he was ruining this gorgeous piece of fabric because he couldn’t handle a little love and affection from Harry’s adopted family.
And they were kissing again, giggling into each other’s mouths, and a thought struck Draco. A wonderfully crazy thought.
Harry sighed, shoulders sagging. He looked down at his breakfast, took a sip of coffee, then put the cup down. Then he looked back up at Draco.
“Mhm?” He stopped rocking, running a hand through his disheveled hair. He couldn’t imagine the state of it right now. He desperately needed to bathe. He didn’t think he’d ever gone this long without doing so.
One drizzling, chilly afternoon near the start of November, Harry walked in just when Draco was closing up.
Potter shrugged. “Yeah. If that’s alright with you. I’m off work now, and it’s nearly five, which is when you close. I figured I’d hang around here for the next fifteen or so, and then we could go.”
Draco rubbed his belly, feeling sated and full in a way he hadn’t in a while. His friend had a point- he really did need to take better care of himself.
“My uncle beat me, my cousin and his friends bullied me, they starved me, I was their personal servant and cooked most of their meals, and if they were angry with me or I spoke out of term, they’d lock me in a cupboard under the stairs, where I slept.”
Draco gasped as a particularly vicious cramp stabbed him in the side. He curled into the fetal position, muffling his cries so his neighbours wouldn’t call the Muggle police. The cold, hard tile floor was going to be the last thing he ever saw.
In addition to tossing Draco a wink, Harry placed his hands on his hips and stood up straighter, a pathetic attempt, really. But Draco truthfully didn’t have the heart.
“That doesn’t make any sense,” said Draco. “How can you say something is your fault when you know it isn’t?”
“There’s no timeline for these things,” Harry told her. “Everyone’s on their own path. Life happens.”
“You’re right, you can’t, but you can be a part of his support system,” said Hermione. “If you really love him, you’ll spend as long as it takes showing him you care.”
Harry laughed. It was a boisterous and obnoxious thing, and Draco both loved and loathed him for it.
“G’nite, Draco,” he murmured, pressing one last kiss on his collarbone, and Draco was allowing sleep to take over him. He should have been wide awake in Harry’s arms, but he was quite comfortable and sleepy. Before long, he was dead to the world.
again. “I’m not being polite. I’m just telling it like it is. It’s a whole lot cleaner than my place, that’s for sure.”
Draco wanted to shrink into the couch and never come out. He would never be as strong, brave, or assertive as Potter.
