Draco goes to answer but I beat him to it, the words spilling out of my mouth before I could stop, “We got dared to go to the Astronomy Tower and steal an owl and your owl just liked me so I stunned it but then Flinch came and I forgot about your owl and yeah.”
The woman measuring Hannah says and Hannah rushes off with her new robes. She doesn’t even bother saying goodbye. She pays for her robes with money her mother gave her and leaves the shop
Blaise touches my shoulder from his seat next to Pansy, “Potter’s a parselmouth, Cass.”
Our father only nodded his head in our direction. My younger self brightened up at the sight of the cake. The presents weren’t visible but I knew there would be a good amount but I would be glad if there were presents in the first place. That meant we had earned them this year, that our father was proud of us. Unless our mother had just bought them for us since she loved to spoil us when we were younger. I already knew the answer, though.
Their father sighs, “Well it’s settled then, I’ll send a letter to Dumbledore straight away.”
The other girl is about to answer when the dormitory door slams open, Pansy standing there in her outfit with slight curls in her hair, “I know, I know, I look amazing.”
“Where’s the popcorn?!” Blaise shouts and Theo hits him on the back of his head.
My father looks up at that and warns him with a low voice.
I groan softly, “Why does everything always have to connect with Hogwarts?”
Potter is fuming from his seat. McGongall had seen how terrible his muggle aunt and uncle were and Dumbledore still made him stay with them. Who cares if they were his only family? Any other family would have been better than the Dursley’s. Draco seems surprised as well that the Headmaster would let the Golden Boy stay with bad muggles. He always assumed the life Potter lived was extravagant.
the moon for a hug,
“Will you wait along here, please?” Professor McGonagall stopped when they got to the stage at the front where the Sorting Hat sat on a stool. Cass grins, so her mother was telling the truth. Professor McGonagall explains what the Sorting Hat is and it even sings a song about the four houses. It’s not the best she’s heard but many of the other students relax at it’s words.
“Hey! You guys are from the robe shop!” The robe shop boy said, “Draco, right?”
My younger self rolls my eyes,
I am not as brave as Pansy though so I shake my head as she turns around to talk to the other Slytherins to do the same as her because there is no one in our house and year that is completely straight other than maybe one person. I’m bisexual myself but I knew if I said it to everyone here, my mother would somehow find out and have a heart attack. I don’t want to be the cause for my mother’s death because even though she made some mistakes, most of them during my childhood, she’s still my mother in the end.
“Did you hear?” Pansy was gossiping about the students on the train from and had heard a very interesting rumor from Daphne, “Harry Potter’s on the train!”
“I’m Hannah Abbott. What house do you think you’re going to be in? All the houses sound nice but my mum says I would be good in Hufflepuff.” The girl rambles on and Draco can’t help but stifle back a laugh at the name of the house she wants.
Dean Thomas asks, “Can we use a translator or something?”
It seems that all our decisions were based on what our father wanted, what we could do to prove ourselves. The opening title is shown:
Pansy giggles but she doesn’t have an answer to my question. It was true though, why couldn’t Harry Potter have gone to a different wizarding school like Drumstrang and had fun over there.
Young Draco snorts into his hand behind them and Hannah swirls her head around to look at him,
“Yeah, it’s something isn’t it?” the Prefect chuckles, “But if anyone from the other houses comes over or if one of your parents wants to visit, let us know. We change the common room to fit their expectations or at least the stereotypes of us snakes. Can’t let them know who we truly are, you know?”
Pansy stares at it, tilting her head before nodding slowly, “Yes, I think it will. I was planning on wearing that yellow and white shirt with maroon pants and maroon high heels.”
This whole process was taking too long and he had no idea what the hat was yapping about.
Draco next to me is furrowing his brow and asks me, “Didn’t they eat our birthday cake at our ninth birthday party?”
Potter scratches the back of his neck, “Yeah, he was sort of the favourite child in the house.”
The door slides open again and Pansy and Blaise step into the compartment. Grace paused halfway through her sentence, staring at the two newcomers, but Cass jumped up from her seat and wrapped Pansy and Blaise in a hug. She was glad it wasn’t someone else because if they knew who she and Draco were and that they were talking calmly with half-bloods. The commotion woke Draco up and though he glared at the three of them for disrupting his beauty sleep, there’s a smile on his face when he realised it was his friends.
“Oh.”
“You can be chaser, I’m fine not playing. I can just join Ravenclaw anyways if I change my mind.” Theo says and then that’s settled. He wasn’t on the old Quidditch team but whenever they played small games within their group, Theo wasn’t bad. I hadn’t seen Astoria play before but from the determined look on her face and Rose and David grinning, she must be good.
I slap him on the arm, “That was uncalled for Draco.” He shuts up and Weasley just glares at my brother.
Severus rolled his eyes and ruffled Draco’s slicked back hair, which he yelped at, but said, “It’s Professor Snape at school.”
Draco suggests, positively.
The Prefect tells them they will have a proper meeting with their Head of House, Uncle Sev or Professor Severus as they told them to call him, and do the Slytherin ritual tomorrow since there are no classes. The two Prefects then show the respective genders (other than the few exceptions) their dorms and Draco is pleased to find his trunk is in the same one as his friends. He hugs his sister goodnight along with Pansy and hurries into his dorm.
Potter laughs, “Yeah, broke a lot of stuff in the shop as well.”
It was a shame really but Draco had his own friends and it was for the best. Perhaps he and Harry could be good friends just in classes. That was all they would be. Just friendly classmates. He frowned, if he was going to distance himself from Harry he would have to use his last name.
“SHHHHHHH!”
’. A snake emerged from the end of his wand and landed on the floor. It slithered up Draco’s robes and around his neck. Cass recognised it as one of the snakes they had in the Manor as pets.
The conversation ends there when Hannah sees neither of us want to talk about what would be worse.
Young Hannah shrugs,
The Weasley twins, with identical smirks on their faces, stood beside each other looking like they just won the lottery. Though Cass would never know what they would actually look like if they did win.
Also I realised half way through this that Dumbledore died in the movies so just pretend that he survived. Everyone else who died is dead (but will come back). I also mentioned Vincent in the first chapter but then later on I said he was dead so please just roll with it. He was supposed to be dead and then brought back but I forgot so please forgive me.
I repeat to myself in my head,
That’s why before he handed the black book over to his father, he had Miny duplicate and hid it in his closet underneath clothes. He was going to keep the book to document his actions and his friends' actions and anyone else he felt was important. Perhaps then he would be able to remember the true things about those people and then whenever his father got too much, he could read it and remember that blood is blood, just like his sister always says. This would be his coping mechanism.
Everyone seems to relax at the familiar face and I see Hagrid brighten up at seeing himself on the screen again. Personally, I hope I don’t see myself, or any of the Slytherins, up on the screen for a long time or better yet, never again. Knowing Dumbledore though, the chance of that is unlikely.
“Must have been a real shock for you, huh mate?” Weasley asks Potter and he just laughs.
I watch in horror as Vernon and Dudley make a fool of themselves. I almost wish the snake would bash through the glass and eat them all. These muggles were disgusting.
Dumbledore dismisses him and he leaves after that while Dumbledore smiles at us, making my hair stand up, “Mr and Ms Malfoy, please sit down,” I sneak a look at Draco who just motions for me to sit down, telling me it’s safe to. Dumbledore passes a bowl to me and Draco, “Lemon drop?”
“Well, I remember Luna telling me a long time ago and it’s not that hard really,” Draco responds, with a smug look on his face.
Weasley shakes his head, “That’s accidental magic, mate. But that’s usually breaking something or levitating something, not making glass disappear.”
Draco rolls his eyes, grimacing, “Some student maybe in 6th year.”
Draco frowned at the use of his nickname but doesn’t complain since it’s Susan so I answered her, “Um, Dumbledore sent me, Draco and Harry to get some people and so we need you three to meet us at the great hall at eleven. We will explain there.”
“Ron Weasley. And, uh, sorry mate. Didn’t mean to laugh at your name.” The boy with ginger hair said through a mouth full of chocolate but she shakes his hand anyways. Draco only rolled his eyes but didn’t say anything so she took it as a win.
The way she says squib is with disgust and I can’t help but feel bad for Longbottom. I overheard once that he had never shown any magic until he was thrown out a window and he bounced all the way down the street. Granger wraps her arms around Longbottom and he just sighs.
That makes Potter flush and he mumbles out a “Thanks.”.
Cassiopeia and her brother watch Potter's life at home and she wonders if there is anything else she had assumed that was wrong. She knew that purebloods weren't superior and that the rivalry between Draco and Potter was turning into something more. Not that anyone besides the Slytherins would notice with Draco insulting them every minute. Like the muggles said, old habits die hard.
“There is one more thing,” Dumbledore adds, “Some people are not here with us today, whether they passed in the war or are in another place. But they are important for the CDs so they will be joining us. Do not worry, some will not show up for a few CDs.”
She nods and sends him away making Dobby glad, wondering how the children became so nice with the parents they had. Draco turns to Miny, “Ok, we need you to write a letter…”
“Great,” Blaise said, “Now let’s get a badger, a lion and a crow and we’re all set.”
“So, care to explain why we were being nice to half-bloods Cass?” Pansy asked once they were all sitting back down and Blaise added, “Yeah, and to a Weasley?”
He shakes his head, "No, my parents were wizards."
Here's the next chapter you've been waiting for! This isn't as long as I orginally planned but next chapter will be the train ride and the sorting. I kept Draco's wand the same since it fits him quite well.
“We could ask Susan for something from Hufflepuff and Millie, don’t you know Mandy from Ravenclaw?” Cass asked and Millie nodded, “I don’t know about Gryffindor though.”
Cass cleared her throat, “We should split up, right? Nine is a pretty large number.”
It was Lucy Faun, second older sister to Matilda Faun and my cousin. She was two years older than me so she had already graduated from Hogwarts. I had forgotten though, that Professor Quirrell was a Muggle Studies teacher before he was a Defence against the Dark Arts. That he must have been a regular professor back then.
ALSO, if there are any characters that you would like to be heard more (I'll do more Neville ofc) or if I'm missing any, let me know! I've kind of forgotten about Luna and Ginny and other younger years bc I orignally thought I didn't include them since they don't appear until next year but then I remember in the second chapter, Cass, Harry and Draco got them so idk.
Potter grins and everyone laughs at the two panicking. Things go downhill later at home. Magic is always difficult to explain to muggles and even harder when you don’t know about magic. It makes you seem like a child if you blame magic.
Draco rolls his eyes but Cassi continues, “Et le jeu auquel nous jouons est…”
The knocker taps the door and it swings open, allowing us in. I beam at Draco who returns it while Potter coughs, clearing his throat, “Um, good job Malfoy. How did you know that?”
“What year is this?” One of the Ravenclaw students, Lisa Turpin, asked.
and we've suffered enough -
“Did, did he just nail the mailbox shut?” Granger asks, staring at the screen with wide eyes.
“The ones about Harry Potter.” Dumbledore answers which does nothing but confuse us more. I look over at the Potter himself but he looks as puzzled as the rest of us.
A few gasps echo from around the room, including one from me. 1981 was the year Voldemort supposedly died the first time, the year Harry Potter defeated him the first time, but also the year my father lied that he was under the Imperius during the first wizarding war. I’m not sure why I was surprised, we knew this was about Harry Potter’s life but I didn’t realise it started this early.
Weasley yelped and glared at him. Draco shrugged, “Oops.” and turned his attention back to Granger with a smirk on his face. He wasn’t going to stand up to every muggleborn and half-blood student he ran into but Cass had talked to Granger and deemed her alright so Draco didn’t want to ruin another one of his sister’s chances at making friends.
Flinch speaks, “I caught these two in the Astronomy Tower, doing what I don’t know.”
I turn around to face them and say, “Can you two shut up?”
We both nod at our mother and dash off to the tea room. The scene switches again to the tea room. Just like I said before, there were a lot of presents but not as many as Potter’s cousin got. We giggled and darted into the room and began to open them. The scene then finally ended, turning black.
“Hey, Flinch-Fletchy! Remind you of the good ol’ days?” Draco can barely stop from laughing, a smirk on his face.
In reality, my brother would be the same if he wasn’t scared someone would report him to our parents. He’s fine in the Slytherin common room because everyone else is going through something similar but outside, he has some enemies that wouldn’t mind going through the extra effort to send a letter to our parents. Even after the war, my parents still think they are right, especially father but I think our mother will change soon. And now with the whole new 8th-year common room, my brother doesn’t really have anywhere where he can be himself.
Luckily, Weaslette answers for her dumb brother, “She’s speaking French, Ron.”
- even in my dreams
Hannah frowns, “We don’t have enough people though for full teams.”
Any questions, let me know! Bye :)
Younger me returns to the screen dragging a grumpy Draco behind me. In his hands is a cage covered by a blanket and I instantly know what's in it.
“It’s alright, she usually acts like that.” Longbottom says which isn’t alright at all because it isn’t good if she acts like that all the time. I don’t speak up though. I’m a Slytherin, they would only find a way to twist my words into something rude.
As he closed his eyes, Draco hoped that these next seven years would be the best. He was counting on it because who knows what could happen in that amount of time.
Draco shrugs, “That is like the stupidest solution to that problem but whatever.”
I raise one eyebrow and stuff my hand into his robe pocket and pull out a handful of paper money. A blush spreads on his cheeks but I just laugh and hand them back to him. Everyone else seems to calm down but I know that once we get back to the common room later that someone will bring it up again and this whole thing will start again.
Anyways, I kept switching between trial, ceremony and ritual but it's actually more of a test to see who are the true Slytherins. Also I was lazy with characterisation so Millicent, Blaise and Pansy kinda sound the same, so sorry. Millie supposed to be more tomboy, Pansy is supposed to be girly (but like with a bitch attitude), Blaise is just *finger guns* and then there's Cass and Draco.
Blaise nodded, “Pans is right, technically what they did was fair. Besides, we’ll waste even more time if we chase after them.”
Grace explains and her sister is staring wide eyed at her now.
I didn’t show Draco and Cass meeting Harry because I couldn’t find the script from the book of what he says to Harry and I was too lazy to make it up lol.
we are good people
It was more of a statement rather than a question but she was shocked nonetheless.
Draco almost groans out loud, Crabbe and Goyle were dumb rocks and Pansy would never leave him alone. “And finally…”
His hair turned a blood orange from frustration which made him even madder from the irony. To this day, his sister was the only one who could get a reaction out of him. Crossing his arms over his chest, the boy says, “Quel type de jeu?”
The trio blush but Granger recovers quickly, “So, what’s your name?”
“Come on, Cass. Let’s go!” Draco called for her from the door to their compartment so Cass waved goodbye to Hermione and headed over to her brother. It was good that Hermione had a nice impression of her but she hadn’t been the most interesting to talk to and was glad for Draco interrupting them.
Draco sneered at them and gone is the soft, kind brother she knows, replaced with the meancingly bully. That’s all everyone else will ever know or see and sometimes, well most times, Cass wished they grew up with different parents and expectations just so they could be themselves and not be hated by everyone because of who they have to be.
“Marge?” Weasley asks, “Like your aunt that you blew-”
which shows me the time is eight fifty-five. My eyes widen, how did time fly so fast?
She tsks at me, “Manners, Cassiopeia.”
“Sure,” Millicent answers before going back to writing something down on a piece of parchment paper, probably homework.
It’s Potter, of course, and I just had to be holding a stunned owl that happened to be Potter’s owl. He doesn’t see it because it’s still behind my back but I can feel my hands get all sweaty.
it an Eclipse -
“I think it was.”
The bird turns and allows us to enter. I drag my feet inside as Flinch grabs my brother’s arm and opens the headmaster's door, shoving us both into the doorway. I’m staring at my feet now, not wanting to meet Dumbledore’s eyes but a different voice reaches my ears.
Blaise rests a hand on her shoulder, “Slow down there Pans, we should probably treat Draco’s eye first. Plus, it’s not like this is the first time this has happened.”
Her mind racks her brain for the information she had crammed into it a few days ago about wand woods and cores. If her memory is correct, a phoenix feather for a core was rare and are generally very picky on their owner, their loyalty must be earned. Willow wood is also an uncommon wand wood and has healing power and choose those with the greatest potential. It confuses her why the wand would select her out of all people. Certainly there were better people out there? Yet the wand did not protest as it was wrapped up in a box and soon Cassiopeia had to accept that this was her wand. It had chosen her.
None of the other professors seem shocked and Professor McGonagall rolls out a sheet of paper, “When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted in your houses.”
A Ravenclaw boy, Terry Boot, groans into his hands, “Don’t tell me he’s going to have a tantrum.”
She watched as the paper caught fire, the flames licking the edges. Normally, her father would just vanish things but that could always be traced, burning a paper the muggle way was more efficient. Once the paper was reduced to ashes, Draco blew out the candle and placed it back in the cupboard where he found it.
My brother rolled his eyes, “Um, maybe, because you’re the chosen one and literally the seven years at Hogwarts were only about you.”
Hagrid scratches the back of his neck, looking sheepish, “Well, uh, I wasn’t really prepared to tell Harry he was a wizard. Dumbl’dore said he’d know already an' be expecting this.”
Then it was Tracey next who always landed on ‘go to jail’ but was out the next round, saying she had a ‘get out of jail free’ card. Someone should have been checking because when another argument was happening in the group, I spotted Tracey moving her little flip phone out of jail. Since Tracey and Draco and a few others, including Astoria who had two pieces on the board and so she got two turns somehow, Blaise who was stealing property cards without buying them and Millicent who was silently moving her piece a few spaces ahead to get the place she wanted, I decided to end the game. By flipping the board in a hissy fit.
“Yeah, back then I did but now I’ve got you guys and you’re now my family.” He smiles sincerely, looking around at all his friends which were basically all the Gryffindors there.
Draco huffs at both of us, “You know I’m picky, why would it be different with my magic? Besides, I wasn’t that confident with my right hand anyways.”
Rays of light blind me and I sigh. Once the sun begins to set is when I know it’s time to go. I don’t want to be caught out at night. I wave goodbye to the fish and trudge up the hill to Hogwarts, hoping to find my brother on the way. Students immediately make a path for me, not wanting to talk to a Slytherin like me. We made an impression on them and I sometimes feel like it was the wrong one.
We finally reach the golden phoenix and Flinch mutters, “Sugar pops.”
Hagrid sniffs and wipes a tear with his handkerchief, “Don’t go thanking me, Harry. The way those muggles were treating ya, you deserved more than a cake.”
Potter frowns, “What do you mean it’s your birthday too?”
Gemma smirked, “Yeah, but that way, we can blame it on the Gryffindors.”
She focused on her brother instead, warning him, "Tu ferais mieux d'être gentil avec la prochaine personne qui entre. Ou d'autre."
Sneaking into the Restricted Area of the Library apparently was not as easy as it sounded, not when you were an eleven year old or any age, Cass guessed. The only way you could get in without causing trouble was with a permission slip from a teacher and what teacher would let a first year into the Restricted Area? Cass was pretty sure this Slytherin trial was kept under wraps by the Prefects. Professor McGonagall would have a heartache surely if she found out they sent off a bunch of first years on a modified treasure hunt throughout Hogwarts, which had moving staircases and a door that contained something that caused a painful death.
Potter glared but Dumbledore just clapped his hands together, “Well, since you are all here, I have an announcement.”
Potter sighs, “I wasn’t going to go originally but my babysitter broke her leg so she couldn’t babysit me. I seemed to be the only one happy about that since she was an old lady who smelled like cabbage.”
Professor McGonogall coughs loudly into his hand before Draco can reply. I focus back on the screen, thankful that someone stopped the fight and that no one got hurt.
They laid out their items in front of them and waited for their comments.
Their mother puts the letter on the table and squats down next to her daughter, “I know sweetheart but perhaps we can send you to Hogwarts with your brother? Dumbledore is very accepting and would not let a child not attend a school! What do you think?”
It was the History of Hogwarts book that they recommended to all muggle born students to read before coming. Cass read it once when she was younger but found it boring after a few pages. Her mother had explained all the important things about Hogwarts from her time there so there was no need for her to read the book. She couldn’t say that so she said the first thing that came to mind.
“But they have five people in their dorm, one more than us, they don’t need another person,” I say because Tracey shared a room with Sally, Jessica and Emily.
This is it, Draco thinks as they reach the dungeons. In front of them is a dark brick wall and the boy Prefect whispers,
She stepped into the kitchen and stared at the huge kitchen inside in wonder. Her friends walked in behind her followed by the twins.
Oh and Happy Holidays!!!!
He looks flabbergasted and stutters to answer, “Well, my name means dragon so…”
We stroll down the girl’s stairs and through the common room and out the picture hanging on the wall of some random person I can’t remember the name of. Together we walk down the stairs to the main floor, where we were supposed to meet Potter. Surprisingly, he’s already there, as Draco says, “You can see his unruly mess of a hair from anywhere.” but unsurprisingly, he’s not alone. Next to him are the Weasel and Granger.
I roll my eyes, “Thanks for that random information.”
He’s probably thinking of the times as a child when our father thought he was a squib until my brother cast a protego around me when our father went to hit me. Apparently, I had broken something with accidental magic. Afterwards, my brother worked hard with his tutors to be the best so he could protect me and so our father would be proud of him. He never was though, only praised him but that was enough for Draco.
“Now, this is a very interesting wand you have here. It is 12 ½”, willow wood with a phoenix feather core and it is slightly flexible.You will do great things, Ms Black.” Mr. Ollivander tells her but her mind is somewhere else.
Someone laughed, “Is this supposed to be hard?”
But if you've read my other HP book (the watching their movies one) you'll see its kind of related to this one (except in this one Draco and the golden trio are friends :D but in the other one it's the same as canon but with Cass) and Theo and the Slytherins are friends again :)
“SLYTHERIN!” The hat shouted after around a minute of sitting on Pansy’s head. Cass and him cheered for her and the girl sat down next to Cass. She hugged his sister tightly and sent a blinding smile her way which he returned.
Hagrid grins at Dumbledore who smiles back.
- i think we deserve
Grace raised an eyebrow at her and Katrina frowned, “Okay, fine. Maybe I’m not the best example.”
We say our goodbyes and leave the common room. Draco sticks next to me, knowing Potter is going to ask about his hair incident. But Potter doesn’t say anything though all the way back to the eighth year common room, he keeps smirking. Maybe this is why he could’ve been a Slytherin because he is most likely using this for blackmail. He knows Draco would die if this got out. Sometimes, it feels like nothing has changed like it’s back to third year with Draco talking about Potter all day.
Cassioepia perked up and watched as the girl strolled up to the stool with her hands in her robes. She looked almost bored and rested her head in her palm as the hat was placed on her head.
My head tilts, “Why?”
We wave at them and the two of us sat down next to the other four. Pansy looks up from her book and gasps as she sees Draco, “Oh my goodness, what happened to you?! I swear I’m going to find them and hunt them down and-”
Dumbledore saw us and waved us over. He pulled out his wand and said a spell I couldn’t hear and a large screen showed. I gasped and Dumbledore spoke, a twinkle in his eye, “This is a projector to show the CDs on.”
My brother and all the guys had never learnt to cook but the house elves taught me at a young age. A woman in the pureblood world had to know how to be the perfect housewife which included cooking. Some families were less fortunate and didn’t own a house elf while others preferred homemade meals sometimes so it was a skill that was needed. I wasn’t a good cook and I undercooked the first meal that I made. My brother had to eat it and he had food poisoning for a week afterwards.
He stands up and goes over to his desk and rummages through a drawer before pulling a folder out. He drops it on the table in front of us and sits down. Dumbledore nods towards me for me to open it up so I do. Inside is a letter with seven CDs. Curiously I picked up the letter and unfold it, clearing my throat so I could read it out loud:
Cass may not have noticed much change in his attitude towards his father but he tried not to let it show. He knew they still had seven years before they were legally adults and could take their savings and leave. He didn’t want to anger his father yet. Inside of him though, the urge to rebel grew. He still had snobbish habits but his change of personality wouldn’t happen overnight. The pureblood uprising was meant to have an everlasting effect on the children and supposed to brainwash them from a young age. It was alright that he was still taking this slowly.
We all flinch at the blatant use of the Dark Lord’s name. I still use Dark Lord because even though I don’t care, I’m used to it. It isn’t fear of his name but rather, the memories of him and the feeling that he will come if you say his name. Probably because of the taboo put on his name during the war. It brought fear to his name and made me, who didn’t care before, say Dark Lord. I didn’t want to be seen as a traitor.
The wand itself meant great things for Draco and so their mother didn't not protest against the choice of wand. She paid for both wands and ushered her children out the door. Unbeknownst to them, their mother had been experiencing flashbacks to her first year during their time at the wand shop. The first time she went to collect her Hogwarts supplies and the first time she held her wand. All good memories but she would rather forget them. There was no use thinking about the past when the present was happening.
His sister stares at him with an odd look on her face, "What?"
“What are you two doing?” Uncle Severus drawled, blinking slowly at them.
One of the Weasley twins, Fred I think, laughs, “You had a crush on gelled Malfoy?"
All the Slytheirns are staring wide eye at the amount of galleons in the vault. They had more, of course, pureblood families saved for generations but it was still impressive.
“Our families have been saving money for generations, we have more than that.” Draco responds, “It’s just- that’s quite a lot for not being from one of the old pureblood families.”
It was then that Professor McGonagall paused, before reading out her name, “Black, Cassiopeia.”
Lavender Brown gasps, “Your wand is the brother to You-Know-Who’s wand?!”
They were right, of course. The ‘point me’ pointed them to his office in the dungeons and the two twins followed it, keeping to the walls to not attract attention. Once they reached the office, Draco knocked on the door and they stepped back to wait for the door to open.
“Voulez-vous jouer à un jeu?”
I shake my head along with Draco. I nervously shuffle in my seat, Potter sitting on the other end with Draco on the armchair. It seems now that Draco notices the owl next to me that I’m trying to hide behind my body.
“It’s quite alright, Harry. You are welcome to leave at any time, all of you are. I should have warned you but I did not know it would be on the CD.” Dumbledore smiles at Potter before addressing all of us, “Now it seems there are some clips of students going Hogwarts shopping in Diagon Alley. Let’s watch, shall we?”
Cass hums, “So… we just need to find the kitchens.”
“Wait,” I say, “All of us?”
No one says anything in response, either they can’t think of what to say back or too busy processing what just happened. I can tell though that my words didn’t have a big effect on the majority of the Gryffindors. I’m not surprised, old habits die hard just like superstitions and stereotypes.
“We should work on the letter,” Cass states, tearing her eyes away from the black book in her brother’s pocket.
Her finger almost didn't fit through the bars but she was ready to pull it back if she bit her. She did the opposite, sniffing it before giving it a little lick. Cassiopeia smiled and grasped the cage in her arms and walked back into the open area of the shop. What she failed to notice in the darkness of the back of the shop was that Diana was not the only creature in the cage. Her brother pointed this out to her when she showed him her new pet.
~~~~~
“But, our parents still got her a cat when she turned eleven so she wasn’t too upset.” Grace smiles.
I glance at Pansy to make sure that’s allowed and she nods, huffing, knowing Draco’s logic is correct. Draco and I smile at each other, our hands intertwined together as we exit. I can spot some treats stuck in one of Draco’s pockets but I don’t ask when he got them. We make sure to tread lightly but it’s not something new to us, we did live in a house with Death Eaters for two years.
There is silence and then Granger’s dad speaks up.
They both nodded frantically, dark magic is something not to be messed with. No wonder it smelled bad. An owl flies through the open window and Draco realises it is Abelard with the letter they forged in its beak. How did it know to give it to their father? The owl must be highly trained to do that. Cassiopeia fiddled with her fingers as their father took the letter from the owl, the owl biting his fingertip. Their father scowled and sent it away, ripping the envelope open slowly, his bony fingers pulling the letter out of the envelope.
Happy Valentines Day! if you're single like me tho u probably won't be doing much lol
“He’s right Pans,” Millie said, gathering all the cards and placing them back in the box.
Bye! OH, and happy summer holidays everyone (even though I still have school for another three weeks but I know USA are done like now)
“If someone did that to me and I was muggleborn, I would think they were crazy!” Pansy exclaims.
like kings and queens -
When I look back at the screen, my eyes widen. How rich were these people? And if they were so rich, why did they have Potter sleep in a cupboard? I was confused and I could tell my friends were shocked at the presents as well.
“Why don’t we just take a book from the library, that’s symbolic to Ravenclaw, right?” Blaise suggested.
Down in the countryside of France, amidst the rolling hills and the wheat farms, was a girl, no older than ten, with long light brown hair and sparkly forest green eyes. She was wearing a plain pink summer dress and tall leather boots for she was out in the fields where there was mud. The bottom of her dress had a line of mud already and the girl wasn’t looking forward to going back home because her mother would not be happy.
“Sev may let us into the Restricted Area but he wouldn’t give us any of his potion ingredients,” Draco sighed, “We’d have to steal it.”
take some money for yourself? Not that I did.”
Our friends all laugh at him until we are shushed by Professor Snape, the movie continuing. I wince at the way Potter’s relatives treat him. That must have hurt.
His father always told him that Malfoy’s were superior to others and Draco was a Malfoy, but he was also a Slytherin and they always took an advantage when they saw one. Draco had to decide which one he was more of but the wonder that filled him at communicating with the merpeople was far greater than any words his father told him. Wasn’t it useful? He was branching out and spreading his connections to a whole other species, shouldn’t his father be proud? There were many things his father said that Draco believed, but discarding muggle techniques was not one, there would be too many opportunities lost if Draco agreed with him.
“Second: a vial of crushed dragon scales”
“Sorry, Theo.”
The cover was a dark green leather and the title was written in silver lettering. Cass now understood why Severus chose this book. It was exactly Slytherin’s colours and it was quite heavy so Severus would get a kick out of imagining them carrying this book all the way back to the dungeons.
At the same moment, the lady finished fitting her clothes and beckoned for her to go to the front and pay for the robes. The girl stepped off the stool, muttered a ‘goodbye’ without looking back and hurried away from the two. A few minutes later, the sound of the door chimes went off and the girl was gone. He was glad she was gone, he didn’t like her that much. She seemed dim-witted and very much a Hufflepuff and Draco didn’t want to deal with a Hufflepuff. His sister though, was not impressed.
“I’ll- I’ll go check on him.” Granger stands up.
This is a new style that I have to use for watching their movies because otherwise ao3 will shut down this fanfic because of copyright. I also can't add what is happening on screen in the description.
The Weasley twins were yelling, “We got Potter! We got Potter!” like it was some sort of competition they had won and Potter was the price.
His friend, Micheal Corner, shrugs, “Well, we all thought he was just scared a lot. It wasn’t really out of the ordinary for him.”
There’s a look of shock on Draco’s face as well but also a bit of relief. I guess this Samantha person didn’t think Potter and Draco meeting was that interesting. It was really just the same as with Hannah; Draco was a jerk and I was just berating him.
The door opens and I step in and immediately laugh at Draco’s side of the room compared to the others. Theo has his all neat except he has books and quills everywhere, Blaise’s is all tidy and Draco has his bed made nicely but his clothes are thrown everywhere and it's all a mess. Draco glared at me while the Pansy also judges his side and Blaise gets out the emergency kit from out of the bathroom.
“She didn’t call me queen though.” I say, pouting.
Young Pansy snaps at the other boy who at the time had a mess of unruly black hair on top his head.
Draco nods, “Good afternoon Weasley, Granger,” He glances at Potter, “Potter.”
Draco does not notice and yells after her as she runs back up the stairs, “I told you not to call me- ...and she’s gone.”
Even a muggle school.
“Sorry Professor…”
“And it’s called ‘acting’, Weasley.”
They both nod, anything is fine as long as they aren’t apart. Their father continues, “First, you must keep up the Malfoy facade, no speaking with any of your cousins in public.”
“Shall we begin?”
~~~~~
He flusters, his face going bright red, “What? Noooooo.”
“Shoot!” I yelled, almost dropping the owl in my arm.
I tell Draco to give me a minute before searching for a pair of blue high-tops and socks. I pull on the socks and then the shoes, trying to tie my shoelaces as quickly as possible because I can hear my brother tapping his foot impatiently. I roll my eyes but I search around for my blue handbag that I sling over my shoulder before waving goodbye to Daphne who was sitting on her bed.
“Hoot!”
Astoria, who was amazing, just grins at her sister, “Don’t you mean, Astowia?”
Millie cracked her knuckles, “If they are then they’re going to pay, don’t fret.”
"Why? What's wrong with it? It's a very nice name." Cassiopeia snapped, feeling protective of the two cats in the cage.
I laughed, “They would if they knew you were this hot.”
Grace is very cheerful, full of life and joy and is the conversation starter out of the four of them while Katrina is more quiet and cold. She adds in to the conversation but keeps her distance and mostly reads her book. Cass can tell Katrina is just more protective of herself, that someone hurt her once so she has walls up. She understands because that’s just like Draco in public with his snobbish attitude. It’s a shield around him, his default personality though in reality he is kind and just like any other child. Katrina had a very dark sense of humour which matched Draco's perfectly and Cass learns early on that most of what Katerina said was sarcasm.
Cass nods, “Yep. This is Diana and that’s Persephone. Watch out for that one though, she bites.” She points to the cat sitting in Draco’s lap. The cat almost seems to smirk which matches the smirk resting on her owner’s face.
“Hey, why can’t we understand them?” Weasley cries out.
Granger sighs heavenly, “I remember when I first saw Diagon Alley. It was magnificent, still is.”
“Well, it appears that we have come to the end of the first section of the CD. Let’s take this time to take a break. Games are over there with lunch and rooms for sleeping or talking.” He then winks at us and I look up at him in disgust. Not all of us were going to do what he was suggesting, some of us were single.
Draco startled out of his thoughts when his name was called. Pansy gave him a gentle push to the front and he was worried he wouldn’t be able to walk but his legs didn’t fail him and he sat down on the stool. The hat was placed on his forehead and it covered his eyes, plummeting him into total darkness.
time to time -
The Ravenclaw Patil twin, Padma I think her name is, raises an eyebrow, “Wasn’t this the year that someone got in and tried to steal something from a vault? How is it one the safest place?”
The rest of the sorting went by in a blur until only three students were left. It was Weasley, Blaise and some muggleborn she didn’t know. Most of the students were trying not to fall asleep or were starving. Her stomach was starting to get hungry though she had snacked a lot on chocolate and sweets on the train.
“Oh!” Potter exclaims, pulling the student back, “And there’s also Matilda Faun? Never heard of her.”
My internal crisis is interrupted when Dumbledore continues, “Classes have been cancelled for the week because we will be watching all seven CDs. A spell has been cast so no time will pass when we leave, for you, it will feel like a week but barely an hour will pass once this is over.”
Pansy walks away with the blue handbag and purposely goes over to Draco and gives him a kiss on the cheek, her lipstick rubbing off on his face and says, “Bye, Dray.”
Someone from the back of the Ravenclaw section speaks up, “I had him for Muggle Studies and he was quite different. Never stuttered, curious and could hold a conversation. Then he came back to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts and it was like he was another person.”
I roll my eyes. That was pretty obvious, with his cousin living the best life while he slept in a cupboard. At home, Draco was the favourite but even he was scolded and yelled because he couldn’t be protected like Dudley was. He had to be the perfect pureblood to continue the Malfoy line.
Their father was less excited and reminded them of the rules to their situation which consisted of not telling anyone their true identities, no socialising with anyone but the friends assigned to them and to keep their glamours on at all times.He told them to act proper and act like a Malfoy. His cold gaze was directed at her more than her brother since he knew she was more likely to act out of line. She nodded along though, not breaking eye contact.
They were surprised, Draco could see it on their faces as Severus was usually not generous with that sort of stuff but he knew Severus had a soft spot for him and Cass.
Cass tried to make conversation with the two boys but it’s mostly awkward. Draco is able to talk about Quidditch with Ron until teams come up and they switch to telling Harry the rules. It doesn’t go bad though and Draco doesn’t insult either of them once which she considers a win. Cass is resting her head against the wall near the door. She’s barely awake but listening into the conversation to make sure Draco doesn’t cross any lines. It’s nice. She doesn’t know the two boys well but she can tell Draco is ecstatic even if he is in the company of a Weasley.
Susan rolls her eyes, “Like that’s gonna happen.”
It was a tradition in the wizarding world for when a child turns eleven, they would receive a letter from a wizarding school. Sometimes it depended on what country you lived in or if you had applied beforehand for what school accepted you. Their father had first wanted to send them to the wizarding school, Drumstrang, in Russia because their father knew the headmaster. Luckily, their mother did not want her children that far away from her but now they were being sent to different schools. They could never win.
Could he not count? I thought to myself and it wasn’t until Pansy elbowed in the ribs that I realised I said it outloud. My face flushed and I contrasted into my seat as people stared at me. They hadn’t heard what I said but they knew I said something. No one said anything and they let it go.
She laughs at her brother as he does his own little dance around the family room, Cassiopeia joining in. Things were looking up for them finally.
“Yes and you can say Voldemort’s name now, Lavender.” Potter replies.
He turns to glare at me, “Peacocks are vicious beasts that pretend they are majestic to lure you in and bite you.”
Cassiopeia has to gather a bunch of people on a list along with Potter and her brother. It seems simple expect for the fact that all their carefully built walls around their secrets don't seem to be as strong anymore and that her brother needs to stop pining over Potter. It's ridiculous.
Hannah grinned and took the hat off, walking to her new houses’ table. The Great Hall erupted into applause and didn’t settle down until the next name was called out. Cassioepia didn’t know any of the names and zoned out until “Bones, Susan.” was called out.
She scoffed at him and crossed her arms over her chest, “Money isn’t going to flatter me. Nice try, though.”
And that’s when I remember that the second twin died in the war and that whatever magic the person, Samantha, who sent the note, did bring back anyone who died in the war. I spotted Lavender Brown and Colin Creevy sitting among us. Luckily, Vince, who we all thought died, had been sent to a ward and gotten treated. He seemed he was only severely burned. I did know that Draco had been avoiding him. He felt like it was his fault Vincent was burnt though no one believed it was.
“Exactly. The movie will answer your questions and if it doesn’t, once it is shown, people can explain it to you.”
“Found it!” Draco cried, heaving down a large, dusty book from one of the higher shelves.
She asked, switching to their comfort language to hopefully soothe her brother and also so no one passing by would understand them. There was a low chance they would understand both English and French. She moved to the side so an older year could pass by.
Cass sees the worry in his eyes so she speaks up, "All houses are pretty good to get into."
That calmed Draco’s beating slightly that they’d get a second chance to pass but he really didn’t want to go through all of this again. He fiddled with the hem of his robes and played with the snake until their group was called up. He took a deep breath and stood up along with the rest of his group and made his way to the Prefects and Head Boy/Girl.
They reached the Slytherin entrance, a brick wall, without too much struggle (though Cass had accidentally dropped the book on Draco’s foot multiple times) and Cass whispered “
This time Cassioepia can’t help it and rolls her eyes along with Pansy who finds her way next to her. She’s lost Draco in the crowd by now but she sees a puff of platinum blonde hair up the front so she isn’t worried.
“Let’s do it.”
The boy smiles, "Okay, that's good to know."
The first years thank them and then they are all whispering among themselves about what the dorms would be like.
Millie shrugged, “We can swap if you’re that much of a drama queen.”
Theo, Daphne, Greg and Vince are sitting there with her group and her eyes widened. She slipped the bottle into her robe pocket but she knew they had seen it from the mischevious look Theo had in his eyes. Cass rushed to her seat in between Pansy and Millie and once the other group tuned back into their own conversation, she took out the bottle from her robes.
Pansy narrowed her eyes at them, “If you really do want to help us, what do you get out of this?”
They had decided to give it to their father early, writing in the letter that the rejection letters were sent earlier than acceptance letters so they could use fewer owls. Draco didn’t think that sounded very proper but they had no other options. Miny had been a good help, her handwriting a nice wavy font. At the bottom of the letter, Cassiopeia had duplicated the signature from the first letter onto the paper before burning the first letter. There had to be no evidence that the letter was a fake.
He entered his office once more and they heard the scratching of quill on paper. Cass tried to hide her excitement that this might actually work, using her cold facade as a mask. When Severus appeared again, he was holding a piece of paper in his hands.
Draco senses the mocking in her voice when he thinks of something, “Where even are mother and father? I haven’t seen them all day.”
The robe shop was empty other than a young girl standing on a stool. She was getting fitted by a lady and seemed to be uncomfortable with the position she was in. Another lady hurried in and didn’t even need to ask them what they needed. She was gesturing for Cassiopeia to stand on the stool next to another girl, pins already in her hand.
Cass smiled back, “Thanks.”
I nod, “Don’t worry, we’ll be there.”
Katrina comes walking past and grabs a treacle tart and puts the whole thing in her mouth. “F*** manners.” She swallows and licks her fingertips, walking away again.
Her brother blushes at the name of their friend who he has had a crush on for the past few years. Cassiopeia thought her brother deserved better than him though, Matthias had been leading Draco on for years that he may return his feelings but she knew he never would. It was just a game to him. Matthias was not a friend to her but he was the only one who has never sent an owl to them so their father wouldn’t recognize their owl.
“Oh shut up, Blaise,” Daphne rolled her eyes at his antics, “It’s a list of what we have to retrieve for the trial by 7 pm tonight. It’s in groups so lucky for us. Unlucky for us, look’s like it was a, what’s the muggle saying Millie, ‘early worm gets the bird’?”
“Read it out, won’t you Blaise?” Draco drawled, already sprawled out on an armchair.
Everyone laughs as Dudley goes flying forward into the snake’s cage, getting drenched in water. Granger’s eyes are wide with eagerness, “How did you make the glass disappear?! That is difficult magic and you just did it then!”
Blaise rolls his eyes, “You don’t like a lot of things, Draco.”
The Longbottom boy frowns, “Why did you go with them if they didn’t want you to?”
They were shocked once more but continued on, passing over the bottle of pumpkin juice and turning to the vial of crushed dragon scales.
And then Professor McGonogall disappeared, leaving young Granger and her parents confused. That was ridiculous. If I wasn’t a pureblood and this happened to me, I wouldn’t believe it one bit. Pansy seemed to have the same thought.
I smile back, “It’s nice to see you too, Luna. But we have a favour to ask.”
The only teacher that would know was Professor Snape but Cass wasn’t sure if he would let them into the Restricted Area. Being a Slytherin was also about making smart choices, not like Gryffindors who would storm into things without thinking.
“Can I-?” Grace moves to pet Diana but waits for Cassiopeia’s approval which she gives. The other girl sits next to Cass and busies herself petting the cat. Draco sticks to petting Persephone in his corner.
She was taken back, was the hat talking to her? Mother never mentioned a talking hat, just that it chose which house they would be in. She assumed it just read your mind or something.
Okay, that was it. Cassioepia was getting out of here. She shook her head and looked around to see where the exits were but they were all blocked off. Had their parents really sent them to a school or was this a punishment? Detention camp? As soon as they were done here, she was sending a letter to her mother about these rules. Perhaps her father was right, Dumbledore needed to retire. She saw other students were also thinking the same as her and was glad she wasn’t alone.
Pansy sighs and gives Draco a kiss on his forehead like I remember mother used to do when we were kids. Daphne smiles kindly and waves us off, pointing at Theo who is deep into his book and then at her own book which she has almost finished. We understand that she and Theo are going to stay there until they’re done so we trudge up the stairs to Draco’s shared room with Blaise and Theo.
Blaise nods, “Yeah, me and Draco were a bigger deal.”
The two couldn’t answer though because they started to laugh harder, Grace glaring at her friends and so Theo replied for them, “Ignore them, Granger. They just find the names of these people hilarious.”
Dumbledore clapped his hands and the screen came to life, fuzzing as one of the other teachers placed a CD into this box before pressing a button. The lights all went off and the CD began to play. It was starting.
I hear a laugh from outside that sounds too manly for a girl so I open it up, Pans going to the back windows, looking like she is ready to jump out the window if it means keeping the makeup. Standing there is not Jessica but Draco, wearing the blue shirt I told him to wear and grey pants with a maroon tie. I sense Pansy calming down, huffing before stalking off to the bathroom, probably to do her makeup.
“Sorry to bother you Susan, but can I have a bottle of pumpkin juice? We don’t have nay on Slytheirn table.”
Her brother nodded, “Malfoy. Draco Malfoy.”
Soon after, the doors open and the students are ushered inside. The Great Hall was beautiful. The ceiling showed the night sky and there were hundreds of candles floating around. Four long tables were placed vertically in the hall, one for each house. Cass kept her gaze focused on Professor McGonagall who led them through the space in the middle and avoided the stares that pierced through her skull from the older students sat at the tables. Draco on the other hand wouldn’t stop glancing over at the Slytherin table by the wall on the far right.
“Great!” Pansy cheered and afterwards, the conversation between the purebloods and the half-bloods was much smoother. Despite their families' attitude towards blood-traitors, half-bloods and muggleborns, they knew that it was impossible to avoid them and that Slytherin would have a few. As long as Grace and Katrina showed qualities that boosted the purebloods then they could be friends without worrying about their parents.
I ignore it and continue my way down to the common room. It’s a bit of a long walk but in five or so minutes, we are there. It doesn’t take long for me to find the spot where the secret brick is. I pull it out and fiddle around for a piece of paper. When we were in Hogwarts before, we used to hide a paper with the passwords for the week on it in case we forget. No one ever found it though so it worked and I guess the younger students passed it along.
Draco frowns, “Why us though?”
“It’s Harry Potter’s life, Pansy,” I argue back, “I assure you it will be anything but boring.”
They all quickly choose a bed and Draco changes into his silk pyjamas. Tomorrow, he will pass the ritual and write a letter to his mother. Everything will be alright. He was at Hogwarts, he got into Slytherin and he was with his friends and sister. This was where he was meant to be.
“Thanks Hagrid for that. It was really special to me.” Potter says, grinning up at Hagrid at the table.
“This one.” Blaise pointed at one of the compartments and Cass doesn’t even have time to tell her brother to behave before he’s sliding the door open.
“Eh, we can figure it out later.”
Young Hannah asks me.
“Thank you, Hagrid,” The woman said, “Welcome to Hogwarts everyone. I am Professor McGonagall. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. While you’re here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points but any rule breaking and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup.”
Cass went first, “Well, we can get the pumpkin juice at lunch. The house elves make the food in the kitchens so everything must come from there, right?”
Hey guys, I'm gonna sound like any other fanfic writer/me in my other a/n and apologise for not updating. Again. I was not really interested in writing this and then when I was, I had exams sooooo
Everyone starts clapping and whooping and to be polite, I clap lightly. I don’t know why we are clapping because it wasn’t much of a surprise that he got accepted since he is here. My brother and our friends used to always tease Longbottom about how he kept blowing things up in class and wasn’t good at magic. I had never expected his own family to think that of him as well.
And then there was light magic. That was every basic spell used. It was the smell of fresh pastries or the feeling you get when you realise, you have magic. That brilliant emotion that causes butterflies in your stomach from happiness. Wizards believe light magic is good and dark magic is bad, hence why dark magic is banned from use. Except that any light spells can be used for bad. A simple levitation spell can levitate a rock over someone’s head and drop it, and that person will die. It doesn’t matter if it’s pure or not.
“You’ll get all the Slytherins and Ravenclaws and I’ll get the Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors?” Potter says when they reach the top of the stairs and mumbles the password which is ‘unity’.
(See the end of the chapter for
Oh, and Dumbledore is definitely up to something.
“Yes,” Draco replies, “Wait until I tell Jess, she’ll freak out.”
Her brother standing next to her twitched nervously, moving back and forth on his feet. The train blew its whistle again so their mother embraced them in one more hug and whispered a ‘I love you’ and sent them off. Their father patted each of their heads as they walked off, waving at the two of them. Her father’s cold stare lingered on her for longer than it should and she shivered, feeling his eyes pierce holes through her skull as the two of them hopped onto the train. Once they were out of view of their parents, Cass decided to confront her brother's worries.
“Malfoy? You’re related?” Weasley makes a disgusted face when I nod.
Cass shrugged, “Not sure, I don’t think so.”
I quickly change in the bathroom, brushing my teeth and hair while I’m at it. Finally, I spray perfume on myself before stepping out, posing for my friends. Daphne is dressed as well, who had gone into the walk-in wardrobe to change. She beams and does a spin for me and bounces her hip against mine. I look around and ask, “Where’s Pansy?”
Draco grins and opens his mouth to tell her about all the sappy stuff it said as well about them needing to stick together and whatnot but Professor McGonagall calls out the next name. They all return their attention back to the stool and Draco brushes the hat’s words to the back of his mind.
And Cass was right. When they walked up to her desk and showed the permission slip, Madam Pince could do nothing to stop them. Though Cass was pretty sure from the way the librarian glared at them as they walked to the Restricted Area that she still disliked them even if it was the second day. She probably thought they forged it.
Granger didn’t think anything was funny and said, “Something funny?”
“Boys, girls?” Vince suggested but Greg elbowed him in the stomach, “Dude, do you want to lose?”
Her brother only rolled his eyes at her, "Calm down. I didn't mean it like that but the name Cecilia means blind and well the cat is blind in one eye. The owners were not very creative with naming."
The girl smiles, “Do you know if any of the house-elves can write, Dobby?”
“I’ll take that as a compliment, Malfoy.” Potter says and Draco’s face flushes red. He hadn't meant it as a compliment but now that he went over his reply in his head, it did sound like one.
“Shush, let me finish. Third: a bottle of pumpkin juice from the kitchens”
She blushes in shame, having forgotten about the mud coating her clothes. Their father, though, is searching for something, looking under cushions and on the bookshelves. He turns to them and asks, “Have you two seen a black book? I thought I left it on the table but it wasn’t there.”
Potter flushes and clamps his hand over Weasley’s mouth. I share a look with my brother but he just shrugs, not sure what the two were talking about.
Hope you enjoy the first chapter! The other language is french and the italics is english. This manor is not in England but in France. Any questions just comment!
Draco scowled at Millie but kept quiet as the Weasley twins lead them down a hallway. They stayed silent, not wanting to talk about their trial with the twins right there. Cass was slightly impressed at Millie for getting the two things they were struggling to find but she wasn’t happy with the price they had to pay.
“Hey guys, look what we have!” Pansy exclaimed, running into their dorm with a bottle in her hand.
would you still look at me
An owl suddenly flies through the open window and drops the letter on young Longbottom’s lap and soars back out into the sky. His face is full of shock and he doesn’t waste time picking the letter up. The Hogwarts seal is on the back so he opens the envelope, making sure to not tear the paper. The letter slides out and he grips it tightly.
Also, the book Draco has is Tom Riddles book from second year. I'm going to have it so his duplicate doesn't have Tom RIddle in it bc magic. I wont say anything else tho. Also, his book is like he writes facts about everyone around him (cough, Potter) and his friends, etc. Cass will also have a book where she writes her own rules like instead of the Malfoy rules. It will be explained better later.
The chaos is funny to me, everyone running away from the snake and Potter just sitting on the floor in the middle of it all. I laugh even more when Dudley gets stuck in the cage, the glass back.
The dark-haired boy strolled up to the stool and Cass was impressed for how calm he looked. It was part of his charisma that Cass hated to admit was there. He sat on the stool and Draco was almost on the edge of his seat waiting for his best friend to be sorted. Cass understood his anxiety. It would suck if Blaise was sorted somewhere else when everyone else was here in Slytherin.
He turns his attention to Weasley and the Gryffindors, who, as usual, were eavesdropping, “I could hold a wand, Wealsey. Anyone can. I was left-handed as a child though and my father had me switch to my right hand since left-handed children were seen as bad omens. I’m fine now but it took a few months before it was comfortable doing magic with that hand.”
A few laughed at young Potter’s confused face but most weren’t going to risk laughing at a sad moment like this.
Theo just keeps staring, “Damn, Potter. You do have a saviour complex.”
Blaise leans closer and whispers, “What’s a mailbox?”
There was magic in everything you touch, everything you see and hear. It’s everywhere. It’s something Draco learned at a young age in the early rays of the morning at the Manor. He heard the sweet songs of the birds and wondered how they could have so many tunes to sing and never tire, how that much happiness and joy could fit in their tiny bodies. He watched as the light would spread across the horizon, golden threads untangling from their hold and colouring the Earth in a multitude of hues.
“How dare she call you a freak! How dare she call us freaks!” Granger stands up, “How dare she lie to you about your parents!”
Rosa rolls her eyes, “Please, I think it would be my sister that would be causing her trouble. Oh! Did you like the new password?”
The Bones family were part of the Sacred 28’, as well as the Abott’s if Cass remembered correctly from the many lessons her father and tutors had pounded into her, and she believed Susan’s aunt was high up in the Ministry.
The walk to the headmaster’s office is longer than I remembered probably because of embarrassment and feeling like she is back in first year, getting dragged by Flinch to Dumbledore. They pass a few students who all had hall passes and prefects, all of them smirking at us as we passed with Flinch, obviously happy that the Slytherin’s got caught.
Potter huffed but didn’t say anything more. Dumbledore sighed, “Well, now that you know, tomorrow your job is to gather up all the students on this list and get them in the great hall at eleven. Classes for the week are cancelled for the students on the list.”
I suggest opening up a website with the Harry Potter script and reading along with that if it helps you or watching the movie alongside this.
I cast another
The first years sort themselves out and Cass intertwines her fingers with Draco’s once she spots him. They all gaze up at the main table where Cass assumes all the professors sit and listen to the old man in the middle as he rises up. Their father said he was an old coot who was a bit crazy in the head and favoured his own house, Gryffindor, too much. She didn’t have an opinion about him but she knew Draco agreed with her father as he groaned softly at the mention of Headmaster Dumbledore.
When his hair turned back to it’s normal colour, he sighed but a hand grabbed his arm and hauled him out of his seat and out the compartment. Draco stumbled to get his footing and looked up at his kidnapper. It was Blaise and he was dragging him down the hallway of the train, “Come on, we gotta meet him.”
He huffs, “Stupid Aphrodite”
All hope left her and her brother and a frown replaced the beaming smile on her face. Their mother, normally distanced from her children, saw the excitement leave her children's face. She stared at the owner, right in the eyes and said, "My children want to purchase two of your animals and you tell them that they are not for sale. Yet, why were they out in the shop if they were not for sale? I will be paying for the two cats and leaving please. We are in a hurry."
Theo rolls his eyes, “Not if you stun the owl and then carry it back.”
Draco rolls his eyes, “Something you reminded me of constantly.”
I had heard from Luna that it was a riddle but I couldn’t see any. Before any of us could reply, the eagle talks,
Her son nagged at her to let them go check out the new broomstick, the Nimbus 2000, but his sister pointed out that they were closer to Magical Menagerie. Cassiopeia had been waiting to finally be able to get a pet that her father couldn't take away. There had been many times throughout her younger years where she stumbled upon an animal in the forest that she wanted to keep. Whether it was a rabbit, a bird, a snake or something else, their father never let her keep it. Animals were feral and not allowed in their home. She wanted to mention that they had owls living in their home but she decided against it.
Standing up, he shakes his sister up and watches as she yawns awake before overestimating how big the couch is and falling off, letting out a yelp. Draco laughs, helping Cass up from the ground. She brushes off some dust and imaginary dirt and Draco hands her the letter.
He nods, confused by the question, “Uh, yeah? It didn’t deserve to be stuck there forever. It should be free.”
“Then why was there a peacock?”
Draco shrugged, “A snake for Slytherin?” He held out his wand and said ‘
He points to the room in the back that was used in their fourth year for the Triwizard Tournament champions. I assume what Dumbledore is saying is mostly directed at Potter, because this is his life we are getting shown but also for the later part because if this is his life then the war will be in it and that’s something some people want to keep behind them.
She took one bottle (she didn’t want to be greedy, she knew other people like pumpkin juice even if she didn’t) and went back to her own table, still ignoring the annoying Gryffindors.
Blaise doesn’t reply to him so the movie continues playing.
Ghosts soar across their heads and the first years gasp. Cass had seen a ghost before, one of their neighbors had one in their attic but never quite so many. They talked with each other about the group below them and wished them good luck before flying away. Draco continued to stare after them until someone walked up to them.
I look up to the Professor sitting at the long table in front of the screen and I’m ashamed of myself that I didn’t recognize the cat was her. I have seen her animagus so many times around Hogwarts that I should have been able to know it was her. I remember that my brother told me that Blaise and Theo were late for class once and they thought they were safe but Professor McGonagall was in her cat form and caught them. I’ve never let them forget about that.
I nod, happy with that answer but then I hear the click-clack of heels going down the stairs that lead to the 8th year common room. We all glance towards the sound and I see Pansy there who sees us and dashes over in her 4.5 inches long high heels, a brown handbag hanging over her arm.
“If Draco would just admit he cheated then everything would be fine.” Blaise spits out, his arms crossed over his chest.
It seemed that was what the twins were waiting for as both of them lighted up and Cass knew they were in trouble. “Well, we have some new products for pranks and we need some new test dummies.”
is the strangest
The three girls mentioned agree with the plan though Cass looks over to Grace and Katrina at the end conversing with other muggleborn and half-bloods in Slytherin. She would have liked to be in a dorm with them but she guessed she would just have to see them at meals and in classes. Besides, she doesn’t mind being in a dorm with the other girls. They are quite nice and thankfully Millie is a halfblood so it would be a bunch of pureblood supremacists. Perhaps they will help her with getting Draco and the other students to be more inclusive.
He frowned, who was Riddle?
I’m glad though that we don’t have to watch more. That little snippet of our eleventh birthday wasn’t long and didn’t show much but it already was too much for me. This was only the first section of the CD and there were seventeen more to go, plus eight more CD’s to get through. I don’t know if I could handle it. Pansy and Draco lead me over to the games and food and I decide not to overthink this too much. Right now, I should be hanging out with my friends and not worrying over the past. Daphne comes over to us holding up Monopoly, a muggle game that Grace and Millie introduced us to. Pansy holds up Twister and Blaise wants to play Risk while Draco is already setting up a card game, either poker or uno. I grin, feeling at home, and sit down with my friends as they all fight over what to play. Of course, I’m the tiebreaker and I vote for uno so my brother deals out seven cards to each of us.
Cass grinned, “Alright then, let’s go!”
The Slytherin table started cheering loudly. She was the first student of the night to be sorted into Slytherin so they were quite loud. Her brother and their friends were hollering from midst the group of first years. Cass took a seat at the end of the table and waited for her brother to go. After a few names were called, a name she recognized was called.
Cassiopeia gasps, "Oh, I am so sorry." She then added in a part of her sad, tragic, fake backstory. "My parents died as well, in a raid but they were wizards too. You'll love Hogwarts, though. It's an amazing wizarding school."
The twin, George, laughs, “Must have given them a nasty shock when they passed by and heard a boy hissing at a snake.”
Everyone agrees, nodding, some even willing to test it and begin to blurt out people’s secrets. Some find themselves mute while others can still talk, this causes a lot of embarrassment and laughter. When this all happening, Pansy leans over to me and whispers in my ear, “Should I stand up and shout out that I’m gay during all this noise?”
To my surprise, the screen goes black and when it turns back on, young Pansy with her short dark brown hair is skipping down the street. Why didn’t it show Draco and I meeting Potter? I was confused, wasn’t that important? Perhaps it wasn’t since Draco is rude to him anyways at Hogwarts.
Young Cass rolls her eyes,
Every first year Slytherin went through a ritual to become a proper Slytherin. Other houses accepted their students without stress but now that Slytherin could no longer keep out muggleborns and half-bloods, his portrait had gotten fussy until he decided on a different way to prove who were true Slytherins. Of course, if you failed you weren’t kicked out but everyone knew who the fakes were.
There was a feeling of magic in the air that excited him but at the same time brought a shiver down his spine. It was ironic, magic was all around him. The spells his mother used to clean their clothes when they got dirty or the spells his father used to silence them when they spoke out of turn. There was magic in the house elves, in their everyday objects, in his parents, in him. But there were different types of magic. Sometimes when his aunt visited, she had this thick aura around her that had a terrible odour. He could never stand near her for long. The black book that belonged to his father that he had hidden in the back of his closet had the same stench. He knew it was dark magic.
Cassiopeia Malfoy is supposed to go to the French wizarding school while her brother, Draco, goes to a different wizarding school. This means for seven full years, eight for her, she won't see her brother everyday other than winter holidays and summer.
I was puzzled but Draco continued, “You will need a lookout. We’re Slytherins, if you get in trouble, that’s detention for you for the rest of the year. I’ll come so you’re not by yourself.”
I flip to the second page, “And then there’s a list of students who are to go to the great hall.”
Draco squeezed her hand tightly and she took a deep breath, steadying herself before walking up to the sorting hat. Eyes pierced through her back until she turned and sat on the stool. She had been sheltered from the public her entire life and no one had heard of their still being a young Black alive. They were assumed to be dead, married off, in Azkaban or disowned.
This might actually be a fun time, especially since I’ve got two plus four’s in my deck. I’ve been meaning to get payback on Blaise for stacking 15 cards onto my pile last time.
Also I know that i kind of forgot Theo was supposed to be rude in the other chapters so he's rude now lol (cause he's supposed to replace Draco later on (tho Draco is still kinda rude in this year))
She rolls her eyes but allows him to write it, passing him a pen and a piece of parchment paper. Once he has written a letter which takes longer than expected since he had to write every letter perfectly, they head up to the owlery. The Malfoy’s have numerous owls but Cassiopeia’s favourite was the Golden Masked owl called Perseus.
“GRYFFINDOR!” The hat yelled and Potter beamed and rushed to the table. The Gryffindor table roared out in cheers and people were throwing hats.
“You just let the snake go?” Theo asks, staring at Potter.
Hannah looks up to see the stranger is her mother and she relaxes,
“Draco!” Cass hushed him, nudging her brother in the ribs, “I am so sorry for his attitude. He’s been grumpy today because we woke him up. I’m Cassiopeia Black, pleasure to meet you.”
Once we get down to the bottom, Potter shows us the list. “There are only Slytherin’s left on the list, no Hufflepuffs. Which means...”
Everyone shrieks at the gun firing and it takes both Draco and Pansy’s nails digging into my palm to bring me back to the present. It sounded like an exploding spell or body parts snapping.
I feel my heart drop in my chest. There were other serious things that could be shown on the screen. The war, the cold manor, Death Eaters, him. Feelings of love that were forbidden and secrets that non- purebloods wouldn’t know, like the fact that I have an arranged marriage with someone in the room, just as all my other friends do as well.
Luna nods, “Of course, anything for family.”
Sally-Anne was on one of the couches and when she looked up at me, she giggled, “Nice onesie, Cass.”
I made up some students so any you don't remember are mine. Also next chapter they will begin to watch the movies. All the dead will return and some older people but not until the movie they are in. If anyone remembers about a OC named Emily, she switched to someone named Katrina. Grace, Jessica and Katrina are halfbloods.
She doesn’t wait for me to reply.
He walked down with Blaise, Theo, Greg and Vince ten minutes later once they’re all dressed and found Cass, Pansy, Millie and Daphne huddled together. On closer inspection, the four were reading a piece of paper.
“Aw! Look at how cute you were!” Pansy cooed at young Grace.
“Ok,” The girl Weasley says, “What do you need us for, Harry? And why are they here?”
A short girl with dirty blonde hair, pale skin and glasses stumbles through the barrier into Diagon Alley, her parents and her younger sister behind her. Her sister had short mousy brown hair and did not look happy to be there. I know who it is and send a grin to Grace behind who pokes her tongue out at me.
Potter shrugs, “I don’t know. I’ve always done weird things like that when I was young.”
For a second, the two think they have been caught but their father continues, “Not accepting you into their school! Ugh, I would send a letter to them complaining but they do not deserve a letter from us. If they won’t accept you on their own then they won’t get you at all. Now we have to find a different school for you to go to.”
“And why are the CD’s about me?” Potter asked, the most clueless person in the world.
“Do you think we’re stupid?” Draco asked but quickly added when they opened their mouths, “Don’t answer that, it was a rhetorical question.”
To entertain myself, I thought about what Potter’s reaction would be when he saw that Draco and I had been faking all the mean things we said towards Luna and that we were actually cousins. Luna’s mother, Pandora, was our father’s sister but once she died, we stopped seeing them because our father felt we didn’t have to anymore with his sister dead. Our mother snuck us out a few times to visit them, though.
Yeah, she had her work cut out for her.
“What about Malfoy, huh? He’s a death eater!” Weasley yells and I bury myself even further into my hands.
Then a little boy with the same colour hair as the girl and same baby blue eyes runs up next to the girl. He only rolls his eyes. Draco buries his head into my shoulder. Looking around the room, some people are looking at us like you would look at a cute puppy while others were disgusted by them thinking a Malfoy could be cute. Someone behind us awes and I turn around to see Astoria and Grace cooing at us.
I stop thinking about that and as I gaze up, a head of platinum blonde hair, almost identical to mine except mine is darker, catches my eye so I jog to catch up with him, “Hey Dray, where are you heading to?”
“That’s a lot of letters, couldn’t one of the professors just go and get him?” Pansy asks and I have to agree, it’s a lot of paper and effort wasted.
“Yes, Mr. Potter, that is you. Such a calm baby you were.” Dumbledore says.
Blaise was grinning from the bed next to his on the left and Draco rolled his eyes but smiled back, “Could say the same thing to you, Blaise.”
But Cassiopeia had been planning a big speech to tell her father.
More people flinch again at the name though most saw it coming because of the topic of the conversation. It was dark and so I didn’t even bother looking over at Potter because I knew most people would be.
He shrugged, “Well, I have the least amount of cards and that’s the aim of the game.”
Do you guys like the song lyrics at the start of each chapter? Just wondering bc do u remember that journel that Cass has from the 2nd chapter? Well from now on in the chapters, the chapters will start with a her own "family" rule. I don't know if you want a song lyric as well or not. The quote will stay tho bc I like them.
Pansy peered over at the two girls, taking a long look at them, but nodded and so does Blaise and they sit down. Cass takes a breath of relief that her two best friends didn’t put up a fight. She had talked with them briefly about wanting to have friends of all blood and houses but it wasn’t something they discussed often. Draco had taken a few conversations for him to accept this new idea and even now he was hesitant, their father’s hold over him stayed strong.
The two of them raise an eyebrow at her weird request but Fred shook her hand, “Deal.”
This wasn’t how either me or Draco wanted everyone to find out but we can’t avoid it now. Our younger selves basically exposed us. I answer his question, “We’re twins, Potter.”
Their father crumbles the letter in his hand and throws it on the table, their mother dashing over to read it for herself. He looks right at Cassiopeia, “What is this nonsense?!”
Millie and Blaise entered the dorm room, “We found an owl up there with a potion delivery for Snape from Hogsmeade. So, we sent a letter to them saying Professor Snape forgot one more ingredient and they gave us a vial!”
No one disagrees against the rule so Dumbledore carries on with his speech, “The third rule is there will be no hate here. We are all the same and you might figure out later on that no one here is actually against equality for all wizards,” This makes the Gryffindors burst out in laughter, how could Dumbledore say that when there were Slytherins in the room who literally bully muggle-borns and half-bloods? Dumbledore ignores them and continues, “No matter what we see on this screen, we will not bad-talk anyone here.”
"Um, they died." The boy says, "I live with my aunt and uncle now. They're muggles so I don't know much about the wizarding world or of Hogwarts."
Vincent sees Draco and his face is red with fury, “Who did that to you?!”
and show you the stars -
Draco smiled back, “We can prepare our things for the trial and then relax until 7.”
There is a collective gasp that sounds across the room and Potter shrinks into his seat. I am shocked and I can tell the other Slytherin’s are as well. We all had imagined that Potter lived a luxurious life, not sleeping in a cupboard. Draco meets my gaze and I can see the guilt and regret in his eyes. I don’t know what to say so I return my look to the screen.
That’s when I realise they are happy tears. Her mother wraps her up in a big hug and there is crying and laughter and joy. Eleanor claps and yells:
“Is that all you need, Young Mistress Cassiopeia?” Dobby asks, his hands trembling with fear that he may be punished for not being able to write. He knew the two children were kinder than their parents but sometimes if they were angry with him, he had to slam the oven door on his hand.
We all laugh, Potter confused in the background which reminds me of the real reason we’re here, not a family reunion, “Ok, so Dumbledore has sent us to round up a bunch of people including you but you need to meet us at the great hall at eleven and we will explain everything there. Cool?”
“Where’s the others?” Draco asked.
“What!” Pansy roared, “We didn’t even finish!”
But then their father says he has to be the perfect Malfoy heir and he has to hang with the two dumb rocks known as Crabbe and Goyle and Pansy who won't stop talking about her stupid tea parties. Plus, he is not allowed to talk with any of his cousins or let people know he is related to Cassiopeia.
Potter flinches at the loud volume of his uncle’s voice. I wrap my hand around my brother’s wrist.
I snort and everyone laughs at the pig tail on Dudley’s bottom. The only one who seems not to be laughing is Justin Finch-Fletchley which makes me laugh even louder. Draco notices and grins.
She nods, “Okay!”
The manor was quiet when the two children entered, no sign of their parents anywhere. The blinds on the windows were drawn shut even though it was the afternoon. A candle was lit on a table in the family room, the wax slowly dripping down the side and onto the table. Cassiopeia walked over and picked the candle up, blowing it out while the boy opened the curtains, letting the natural light come into the house.
The second whistle wouldn’t blow for another five minutes and then the final, warning whistle wouldn’t go off for two minutes after the second one. Still, their mother had gotten them at the platform early so they could get a compartment on the train without rushing through crowds of people.
We didn’t see Potter at all when we left the common room at ten forty-five to go to the great hall nor did we pass him in the hallways. I found that odd but it was like Potter to be late so I wasn’t too surprised. Draco, though, kept looking down hallways as if the boy would just randomly appear. After a few minutes, we reached the large wooden doors of the great hall. No one was inside except for some teachers, including Dumbledore, because breakfast ended at ten for classes. It was a Sunday though, so no classes but students were out playing and hanging with friends.
“‘Mione, it’s okay. Sit down.” Potter places a hand on her shoulder but she pushes it away.
“Well, see you tomorrow at nine Potter. Don’t be late.” I then walk off, smirking as I hear Draco mumble a “Bye, Potter.” before trailing behind me, leaving Potter in the dust.
“Oh! I have to introduce you guys,” Cass exclaimed, moving to the side to show the other people in the carriage, “This is Grace Kelly and Katrina Hoffman, my new friends, and this is Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson, my childhood best friends.”
Sometimes, Cass just wishes they could all be friends without constantly being reminded of what they did wrong.
Speaking of Potter, it was his turn. Professor McGonagall read out, “Potter, Harry.”
and shows me the time is ten-fifteen and that we need to speed things up so I reject the offer. Grace doesn’t mind and I ask, “Meet us in the great hall in eleven, bring all your dorm mates.”
She was not going to back down now when she was so close to being free of not having to control her emotions and pretend to be the cold, perfect daughter. She could finally be a kid again with her brother. The only thing in between her and her dream was her father and just because she happened to be related to him, that was not going to stop her. She had waited much too long for this.
They raced up the stairs to the astronomy tower, Blaise trailing behind them with the book still in his hands. Once they reached the top, one of the Prefects took pity on him and levitated the book to where the rest of them were sitting. Blaise flashed a thankful smile and hurried to where his group was sitting.
He nods, “Yes, all three of you can.”
"We never asked him his name!" Draco exclaims and they groan in unison. How dumb could they be? The boy hopefully remembered her brother's name since she said it outloud a few times. They would have to run into the boy at Hogwarts sometime this year.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It must have gone back to the kitchens.”
“Kelly, Grace.”
is the first thing she thinks.
Cassiopeia gets a bit sad about that but they could always meet up in private. “Second, stick with the friends I have assigned to you like Pansy, Gregory and Vincent.”
My brother’s nose crinkles, “Pumpkin? What kind of horrid nickname is that? Calling a child after a food?”
“Lun-?” Potter goes to ask but is interrupted when the same person shows up.
Hopefully being away from her parents for the next months would help loosen some of the strict rulings over herself and her brother and let them be children for once.
Pansy pets my cat who licks her hand while Blaise sticks his finger in the cage at Persephone. Persephone stares at the finger before snapping her jaws at it, almost biting the finger off. Blaise yells in fear and the screen goes black with the last picture being all of us making fun of Blaise.
As I walk past, scattered Slytherins, younger students, latch to my side. Slytherins now have to walk in groups of no less than three people unless you actually want to get beaten up by someone. Me and my brother, though, are usually the ones picked on most but being the eldest we have more safety because no one hits someone in front of a younger student. This makes us magnets to other Slytherins who need protection. My brother lets only a few others join him on his strolls but I don’t mind if there is a crowd around me, as long as everyone is safe.
“No,” I shake my head, “like other houses.”
on you.”
keep searching
“Of course, we aren’t scammers. Mum gave me my allowance for the month before I left for Hogwarts so I’m rich.” Blaise said, winking at Cass.
A mysterious voice, seemingly coming from the ceiling, hushes Potter and he shuts up almost automatically. “Sorry to scare you. I’m Samantha, the one who gave you these CD’s. I’ll only speak when someone is about to say a spoiler and I cast a
Draco nods, “Should I write it or should you?”
The bricks begin to move and create an entrance to what he believes is the common room. Gasps echo throughout the students but Draco had already been told of this by his mother.
Cass listened to him and finished eating the rest of her lunch. They chatted for a while but once everyone began filling out of the Great Hall, the five of them stood up to leave so they could retrieve the last items for their trial.
"That's her name. Peresphone is a Greek goddess I read about in a book in France. She was the goddess of flora and apparently, Diana is the Roman name for a Greek goddess named Artemis, who rules fauna. They're matching!" He explains, his grin stretching high on his face.
“I’m just going to say sorry in advance, Hannah.” I apologise and Draco nods as well.
“Hi, er, sorry for sitting in your compartment. All the others were full.” The smaller of the two with glasses spoke. She seemed shy and obviously thought the two would throw them out or at least yell at them.
The scene goes black but before I can apologise again to Hannah, the next scene shows. It’s the robe shop again but this time, it’s just me and Draco but now he is up on a stool next to me.
Daphne huffed, “Why do I get stuck with three boys?”
Her parents hadn't died but her story had to seem real. Draco nods along with her, "Your house will be like your family."
“Bet Harry could still beat you Slytherins with that model.” Seamus Finnigan exclaims and the other boys cheer, agreeing.
The house-elf apparates away and returns shortly after with another house-elf, this one wearing a dress with dirt all over it. “Miny is happy to help Young Master Draco and Young Mistress Cassiopeia.”
Hannah gasps, “That’s a lot of presents!”
He retorts,
and pushes me towards the stool. I scowl at him but he’s already sat down in the chair nearby and looking out the window.
“Malfoy! Um, nice to meet you.” Hannah’s eyes widened and both the twins could see the distaste along with fear in her eyes.
like I'm the Sun -
The nine of them looked around the group at the same time, an uneasiness settling upon them.
Inside the compartment, Pansy sent Cass a look and she understood and got up to follow the two boys. The two girls already knew what the boys were planning to do and knowing her brother, he would find a way to either offend Harry Potter or embarrass himself. She left the compartment and jogged to catch up to her brother and Blaise. Blaise was a great friend but he could never get her brother under control like she could. Besides, he would probably just laugh at Draco if he made a fool of himself.
She shrugs, “I was thinking maybe one of the house-elves could since father wouldn’t recognize their handwriting.”
“Dobby!” My brother yells.
I drag Draco off his chair and haul him over to the table with snacks. My mouth waters at the delicies and goods and I reach for a pastry with jam. Before I can shove it in my mouth, Pansy slaps my hand away. I pout, my eyebrows burrowing.
“Vraiment, Draco?! Vous avez dû être rude pour elle? Elle ne fait rien de mal.”
I almost barfed on the floor, “Not if we want a repeat of last year.”
The other boy, with ginger hair, snorted and she shivered as her brother snapped his head to look at him, a glare already on his face, “You think my names funny, do you? No need to ask your name, it’s quite obvious. Red hair and hand-me down robes-”
Young Pansy is carrying a couple of books in her arms and a bag hangs off one of her arms. Pansy next to me sinks lower in her seat and I fumble to find her hand and when I do, I squeeze it. Young Pansy then bumps into someone but she doesn’t drop anything.
Pansy grinned, “Okay, Team Snake is a go.”
- if i told you about
The twins look at each other and Cass tightens her grip on Draco’s hand. She wishes and prays to the stars above her that they will be sorted in the same house. They did all this work to be together and Cass was not going to have it all be ruined by a stupid hat. Their father wanted it to be a surprise how they were sorted but the night before September first, her brother couldn’t sleep so their mother had told them in hushed tones how it worked to calm his nerves.
“Is that my owl?” At Potter’s voice, the owl shifts and Draco mutters a reverse spell underneath his breath, a wandless one which I never was good at. The owl flies over to Potter, hooting, “Hedwig! Why do you have my owl?”
“Finally,” Dumbledore says, “There will be breaks half through each CD and after every CD for people to eat and for other personal things. You may use it to hang with friends or talk with others. We will also set up some games to do so we can bond as a school. You do not have to wait until the break though to use the restroom or to get a snack, they are both over to the side on the left.”
Draco pouted, “Shame we can’t do the same for Ravenclaw. Lady Ravenclaw’s lost diadem is well, lost.”
More names were called out and they went into their assigned house. 7 more into Ravenclaw, 6 into Gryffindor, 4 into Hufflepuff and another 4 more into Slytherin. The Slytherins were Millie, Vince and Tracey Davis and so other than the latter, Draco knew them all. The sorting was barely halfway and already there were a lot of studnets been sorted. Draco hoped he wouldn't be near the end.
“The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily.” Professor McGonagall spun around and left through the large doors into the Great Hall, her robes swishing behind her.
His sister's eyes then widened and mouthed ‘your hair’ which Draco caught. Peeking up at his hair, he could see the tips were a light pink matching his face. He zoned out of the conversation, focussing on keeping his hair under control. His hair usually changed automatically when he felt strong emotions but their father had drilled meditation into them at a young age to calm their emotions. It worked quite well and he never slipped up in front of others. His sister was an exception; she always got a rise out of him and he needed to stop letting her get to him or else his secret would get out.
He ponders it for a moment before announcing, “Well, I’ll be seeker. We got Tracey to be keeper and you, Blaise and Theo as chasers. That leaves, Millicent and Greg as the beaters.”
Sofia cheers and the two giggle.
My brother shakes his head, “And thank god for that. Our father bought them before we were born because he thought they would express wealth and elegance but they are just really loud and annoying.”
At this, someone from the opposite bed groans and a head of shaggy brown hair appears from behind the bedhead. Theo rubbed his eyes and glared at them, “Can you two keep it down? Some of us are trying to sleep.”
Draco sniggers into his hand, obviously thinking of a few people that fall into the first category when Pansy mumbles to me, “Granger got the best of both worlds.”
“Mate, that was a lot of wands you went through!” Weasley exclaims. It had only been the fourth one that chose Potter.
Draco rolls his eyes at her and opens his mouth to say something when someone enters the room. It's a scrawny boy with broken glasses and messy black hair. He was wearing baggy clothing and looked like he hadn't eaten a good meal in a while. Either he was younger than them and didn't bother to get dressed this morning or his parents weren't the nicest. She didn't feel pity for him but he did new clothes.
She nods, grinning, “That sounds nice.”
“Yeah, I’m just gonna interrupt this for a second.” Draco pushes in between and takes an apple from a fruit bowl.
The young Susan’s hands shake as she tears the envelope open and pulls the letter out. She reads the words silently and her eyes widen, tears sprouting in the corners and everyone is quiet. Was she not accepted. I was confused because Susan was here in Hogwarts so why was she crying.
Millicent answers, “Instead of owls coming to your window, a muggle person delivers the letters to your house and they leave them in this box outside your house.”
Draco groaned and they all laughed, the snake around his neck hissing as if it understood the joke.
There’s silence from the professor’s table and I know they are embarrassed of not doing that sooner. Potter replies, “Well they do, in the end but I don’t think they needed to send that many letters beforehand.”
"Uh, Hogwarts too?" The boy asked her brother and he glanced back at her mockingly as if he was asking permission to answer the boy’s question. She nodded anyway.
“Well anyone who doesn’t get in the other teams can join us.” Susan declares, loud enough for everyone to hear.
Dumbledore asks for us to come back to our seats and I sit down in the same chair, Draco to my left and Pansy to my right. “Now, it appears that the next section of the CD is not of the movie but extra videos that the person who gave this put in. The videos will be around the same time as the part of the movie we saw. This will include all other houses and people who are not here.”
An old lady, his grandmother, is already sitting in a chair. She glances up at him from over her glasses.
Potter snorts and I look over at him, my eyebrows raised. He knows something that we don’t. I’m now more intrigued than before. I wonder what is going to happen next.
This makes Hagrid forget about the other comment and the two share a smile. Next to me, Pansy flops her head on my shoulder, whispering, “This is boring.”
- I didn't realise how big
“Well,” She says, pondering, “We only have until tomorrow to give him back his precious, rich owl so we should send the letter today.”
Draco snorts which he then covers with a laugh, “Please, anyone with two eyes could of seen us two dating a mile away. Besides, speaking as someone who had to watch for years you guys call each other by your last name, it was quite a shock.”
“I’m not sure, to be honest. All the houses seem great. Maybe Ravenclaw.” Grace replied and Pansy nodded. Ravenclaw was the second best house. If Grace got in, they could still be friends without her parents cutting her out as long as Grace had good qualities that benefited her like wisdom and intelligence.
She just laughs, “We’re friends, I’ve already forgiven you. Besides, I really should be saying sorry to Draco for how I acted.”
Apparently, no one else knew how aggressive and loud we Slytherins got when playing games or that we knew what muggle games were. Southern had many muggle-born and half-bloods and Millicent introduced them to the games in Year 4 when wizard games weren’t as fun as they used to be.
“Weasley, Ronald.”
Everyone cheers when Potter grabs a letter but I frown, “Why didn’t you run out of the house? Or grab one from the floor?”
What was the hat going on about?
Cass didn’t notice but she soon fell asleep with her head on Draco’s shoulder. He let out a sigh and laid her down on the bed, lying next to her, watching his sister sleep so peacefully. He knew what was coming at Hogwarts, the lies he would have to say and how he would have to act. His sister acted like he didn’t know what he would have to become but he knew since his very first lesson with his father on Malfoy rules.
There was a boy standing there with short blonde hair and bright ocean blue eyes, wearing a blue plaid shirt and brown pants, complete with leather boots on his feet. As soon as the boy was spotted by the girl, her hair changed into the same shade as his hair and her eyes were the same colour blue. The boy, instead of shocked, pulled the girl into the forest where they were hidden and hit her on the arm.
“Yeah, but yours is more of an obsession.” Weasley replies and they all burst into laughter again.
He welcomes me in and Blaise waves from his bed where he is reading some book for some reason. Theo is in the bed across from Blaise’s in the far right corner sleeping, slight snores coming from him. I hear Draco mutter a wandless ‘
I gasp, why was our family always involved? Matilda was another cousin but on our mother’s side. Some random cousin of mother’s that got disowned for marrying a muggle. Our mother kept in touch though with the cousin because they were very close. Matilda had two sisters as well, Rachel and Lucy. Rachel was four years older than me and Lucy was only two years older. Matilda was the year below me.
“Okay, dude, take a deep breath, you look like you’re gonna faint,” The Head Boy told him and Draco let out a startled laugh, rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly.
Of course, she could not just wait until her birthday because if two letters showed up, one saying she got in and one saying she didn’t, that would cause chaos. Cassiopeia knew she got in because any school would be mad to reject a Malfoy and if they did, her father would be stomping over to the head of the school and demanding they let her in. She didn’t like knowing it was just her name and fortune that got her things, not her talent or skills but she couldn’t complain.
It’s like someone flipped the switch on my brother because he immediately snaps his head over to her and says, “At least I could pronounce my r’s.”
I burst into laughter, “Those were our peacocks.”
I’m not sure how Grace got in Slytherin, because she should be a Gryffindor or even a Hufflepuff for she doesn’t question me about why. Maybe that’s why she is a Slytherin because people underestimate her and then she surprises them with her Slytherin side. She goes back inside because Jessica is planning a big heist to steal her makeup back from Pansy, which will probably end badly so she doesn’t want to miss it. I wave goodbye and Draco and I make our way to the boy’s side.
I groan quietly in my hands as I see through the cracks in my fingers Millicent sitting up to her full height, staring Finnigan full on, “I’m a half-blood. Not all Slytherins are purebloods and none of us actually think that way.”
The rest nod, Draco adding, “Plus, this happens all the time, I don’t care anymore.”
Draco was impressed and he inspected the vial in his hand. The dragon scales were fresh and weren’t a cheap kind. He could tell why Severus ordered from them. He re-opened his trunk, placed the vial inside and locked it once more. “Did you pay them?”
She shakes her head, “Sofia didn’t get a letter. I was the only witch in my family, besides mum.”
“No! This is not okay! She, they-” She bursts into tears and wraps Potter into a hug.
“So what now?”
The girl grinned and bent down to pick up the book she dropped, “it’s alright, I should have been looking where I was going but this book is just so good!”
My brother smiles at me, engulfing me in a hug before shooing me off to get ready myself. This is when I realise I’m still wearing my pyjamas and that since last night I failed my dare technically because I didn’t bring back an owl, Pansy chose what I had to wear to bed which happened to be a dragon onesie from Draco’s closet. It was two sizes too big so I could flap the sleeves around and hit people. I also realised I had just walked through the common room in my onesie and now I had to go back through the common room to get to my dorm.
The two siblings attached the letter to his leg and sent him off. All they had to do now was to wait for Matthias reply. It shouldn’t take too long.
Blaise shrugged and reached up and scratched at the image of a pear. Nothing happened for a few seconds and Cass was sure they had been tricked and that the twins would hex them and run off laughing or something. But finally, the portrait swung open and peering inside Cass saw house elves running around, the smell of freshly baked pastries filling her nose and she knew this was the kitchen.
His friend, Micheal, laughs, “Remind you of yourself at that age?”
The two ran into the room and collapsed onto Draco’s vacant bed. None of the boys were surprised or shocked that two girls were in their room because they’ve all been friends since they were small. Theo, who was never as close as the rest of them were, looks disdainfully at the girls but didn’t complain. He was outnumbered anyways even if he did.
The man smiles and says,
We go our separate ways, Potter starting on the boy’s side while Draco and I begin on the girl’s side. We reach the first dormitory which is the Hufflepuff’s first dorm with Susan Bones, Hannah Abbott and Sally-Anne Perks. I hear voices coming from inside so I knock on the door, hoping someone will answer. A few seconds later, the door opens and Susan is standing there.
Rosa narrows her eyes at us, “How do we know it’s not a prank for dying Draco’s hair bright red last year?”
“You may be wondering why you are here or why Mr and Ms Malfoy and Mr Potter came and got you.” Dumbledore says, causing numerous whispers and agreements echoed across the room, “Well, yesterday a folder arrived from a mysterious person with a letter and seven CDs. The Ministry and I have checked for curses or spells on it but there are none.”
- and if you can't find your way
They all agree that that sounded good and they headed back into the library. Madam Pince stared at them as they walked in, a warning that if they messed up once they would be kicked out for good. Draco made sure to smile as sincerely as she could at the librarian.
“But if you are associated with a different gender identity, we can always figure something out for you.” The Head Boy adds in which the prefects and heads nod along with.
Then it hits me. What if those dumb things were shown on the screen in front of everyone? That time when I slipped on the floor in the common room and hit my bottle of ink, drenching myself in ink and Professor Snape who had just walked in. I had detention for a week afterwards. Or that time when someone surprised me so I threw the closest thing near me which happened to be someone’s cat. The cat avoided me for a month after that happened. Those things were not to share with everyone else, only for me and my friends to laugh about. It was unfair that we didn’t get a choice but I was glad my whole life wasn’t getting shown like Potter.
Potter looks sheepish as Granger and Weasley laugh. Hagrid just smiles at them, shaking his head. Obviously he told the other two; they were inseparable. I was surprised when Potter didn’t tell the others about the mission Dumbledore gave us but with Dumbledore, Potter is like his minion. He’ll do anything for Dumbledore.
She leans in real close and whispers, “Truth or dare.”
“Je suis inquiet, Draco, parce que vous serez envoyé à l'école en Angleterre pendant que je reste en France. Ce qui va nous arriver?”
Millie stuck her tongue out at Blaise, “I think a snake is a good idea.”
“Are we done?”
The girl was not phased at all by the boy’s anger, just rolled her eyes at him, “C'est bien, Draco. Ci, personne ne croit en la magie, de toute façon..”
“You don’t like my nicknames for you.” Pansy says.
This was on purpose of course because their father did not want the world to know he had a daughter for personal reasons. Having an only child was respected and even having more children was fine but twins were bad luck. It was also the reason that their father did not think females should have equal rights but should take care of the children and cook and clean. That’s why their mother did not get her dream job, to be a herbologist because she was supposed to learn to be the perfect wife and herbology was a laughed-open subject, their mother would never have gotten permission to pursue it.
“We have to go down to the dungeons.” Draco finishes for him.
They look at each other and Cass can feel her anger rising but also tears in her eyes. They were so close and it was ruined all because of stupid pureblood superstitions and their father’s stupid reputation. She almost felt like stomping out of this room just to be away from her father but she knew it would only make things worse.
His voice shakes as he points at the owl, “Put the owl back.”
Their father snatches it out of his hand, glaring at him, “You should know better than that Draco, stealing my book. This is dark magic, should not be in the possession of children.”
Pansy whispers in my ear, “I think that vault was the one the person tried to steal from because it happened on the same day and when the person got to the vault, it had already been emptied.”
Surprisingly, Granger chuckles and replies, “My parents almost didn’t let me go but Professor McGonogall came back and showed us more magic. They agreed afterwards.”
The woman at the counter says.
He handed her a wand that was 9” and cherry wood with a phoenix feather core. Cass gave the wand a little swish and a burst of magic flew out, hitting a lantern and cutting the light off. Mr. Ollivander quickly pocketed the wand and went in search of another wand. It took three more tries, each wand different until he showed her the wand. She could feel the magic pulsing from it and she instantly knew it was her. As soon as the wood touched her palm, sparks of green and blue burst into the air. Cassiopeia grinned and her brother looked happy she found it. Her mother was less impressed, probably because it took a while, but she handed the wand to the old man so she could pay.
She looks out into the crowd of first years and spots her brother. He’s fidgeting with his robes. The hat has been on her head for a while. Not long enough for it to be a hat stall but the students are getting impatient. They are most likely confused why a Black is taking so long to be sorted. Cass knows her brother would have a heart attack if she told him it was because the hat was considering putting her in Hufflepuff. He would eventually accept that she has Hufflepuff traits and probably say something like, ‘At least it wasn’t Gryffindor’.
She stood up straight and looked at the twins, “Thank you.”
She smiles airly, “ Hello Harry. Hello Draco and Cass, what a lovely surprise!”
“Is that you, Headmaster?” Grangers asks, squinting at the screen to get a closer look. Dumbledore does not answer her though.
Draco gets out of the chair and hurries me out of the room as Dumbledore grins behind us. I can already tell I’ll regret this. Potter follows out as well, Hedwig on his arm, and neither of the boys does anything, just glaring at each other so I speak up.
Grace welcomes me in but Draco casts a quick
I could hear Flinch’s voice down on the stairs, all mumbled, but both Draco and I could tell it was him. We shared a look before Draco was beckoning me towards the back stairs. I shimmied over to him, trying not to make any noise and as I reached the stairs, I didn’t care anymore and just ran at full speed down the stairs, Draco following behind me. It wasn’t until I reached the bottom that I realised the owl was still tucked underneath my arm.
out of the darkness
“Let’s go, don’t want to keep Potter waiting, hm?” I say, smirking when I see Draco’s cheeks go bright red, elbowing me in the side.
(See the end of the chapter for

and saw the time was eight-fifteen and breakfast started at eight and went until ten which meant there would be people in the common room now. Sighing, accepting my fate, I opened the door and stepped out into the hallway and made my way down the stairs, knowing very well that if someone saw me it would look like I spent the night in the boy’s dorm. It was something I couldn’t escape but luckily I had the upper hand, my lesbian card always shut people up.
As a Malfoy, he needed to be respected in his house so if he didn’t pass, he knew he would be mocked for the rest of Hogwarts. Draco couldn’t let that happen.
A boy next to them jumped forward, yelling “Trevor!” He grabs a toad in his shaky hands and quickly apologizes to Professor McGonagall. A few students laugh at the boy, including her brother, and she has to hold back a snigger. Instead, she elbows Draco to stop. The boy was obviously nervous about the ceremony and his classmates laughing at him wouldn’t help.
Knocking on Draco’s dorm room, I waited outside while I heard some shuffling going on inside. I expected Blaise to open the door since he was usually the first one up but it was my brother instead. He was half-dressed, only his pants on, and his hair was a mess. Cassiopeia never got used to the fact that my brother was actually hot, like with abs and everything. I could say that though because I was a full-on lesbian so even if they weren’t related, he wouldn’t be my type.
The scene ends abruptly and it switches again to cosy home. It is nothing like any of the wizarding manors I’ve been to. I assume this is a muggle house but I can’t be sure. Perhaps the middle class wizards live in places like this. My first guess is correct when a young girl with big bushy hair that I could see from miles away walks into the room. It’s Granger of course, anyone could tell with that hair. Pansy stiffens next to me and I smirk at her before returning my gaze to the screen. Young Granger grins at the big pile of books next to a cake with candles on it, which is very weird. Her parents are there and they start to sing this song and I cringe. It’s a terrible song, almost as bad as the one my brother created about Weasley.
Granger was there at the end of the hallway with the two Patil’s. All four of them eyed my choice of clothing, Granger confused while the other three disgusted. I didn’t mind since the onesie was super comfy and I was imagining hitting them with my sleeves if they were closer to me.
There are gasps from the Gryffindor section and I wonder if they recognize that stone. There is a slight nagging at the back of mind but I can’t remember what the stone is though I know it was important. Obviously not important enough to remember it though.
For Cassiopeia, that was her right hand which was the same as her brother. She wondered though if he would hold out his left hand, which was the hand he was more comfortable with until their father told him to switch. Being left-handed was uncommon among wizards and their father deemed it a sign of bad luck. He forced the habit of doing everything with his right hand from a young hand but she knows it feels wrong to him.
Even from here, I can hear Potter’s jaw snap shut. The whole student body knew about Professor Quirrell who had been fired for working with the Dark Lord but no one knew the real situation. I had heard from someone that Potter had faced off against Quirrell himself so seeing him again on the screen must be shocking.
Draco had first wanted an owl but he found his sister was quite persuasive and changed his mind to get a cat like his sister was. His sister reminded him that Hogwarts had owls they could use as well. That didn't stop him from wanting an owl. There was of course the chance that he bribed his mother into buying a cat and an owl and hoping the school doesn't notice. They probably wouldn't but neither of his parents would want him to take two animals when he only needs one. Plus, with his own owl, he wouldn't see Perseus or Artemis, two of many Malfoy house owls, anymore.
Diagon Alley was busy as per usual at this time of the year. There were older kids getting their books and materials for the new year at Hogwarts. Then there were kids like him, first years, who were buzzing with excitement. He was ecstatic because not only was he getting a wand but he was going to Hogwarts where they would practice magic. This is what Draco and Cassiopeia have been waiting for their entire life, yet it isn’t exactly how Draco imagined it.
The two look at each other, grinning before Draco realises who the other is and looks away, a slight blush on his cheeks. Potter almost looks disappointed but I hold back the urge to smirk. These two were ridiculous. I focus back on the screen.
would be surprised and upset (perhaps jealous) to find out Draco and Blaise dated.
Looking over, Potter seems visibly offended and shocked. Weasley stands up and shouts, “You gotta problem, Malfoy? Gonna run to your Daddy and tell him? Oh wait, that’s right, he’s in Azkaban.”
“Thanks Sev!” Draco exclaimed, grinning.
Potter scratches the back of his neck, “Well that only happened because-”
“Are we just gonna ignore Dudley?” Pansy says, “Even Vince and Greg aren’t that low to eat someone else’s birthday cake.”
Greg holds up his fist, “I will definitely beat that kid up.”
He glances at us, “Well, well, well, who do we have here. The Malfoy twins. Thought you would know not to get into trouble after the war happened. Let’s see what Dumbledore has to say, hm?”
“Ugh,” Draco groaned, “But where are we even going to find another bottle of pumpkin juice? All the food is gone.”
She rolls her eyes, “Pans thought you were taking “too long” so she went over to Tracey’s room to use their bathroom.”
Hannah’s eyes widen,
Also, not me adding the Weasley twins in because you cannot tell me if Draco and his gang were nicer they would have gotten into SO much trouble with the twins. we were robbed.
“Now Mr. Weasley, I do believe that from this note I have here that we will be seeing into your other classmates' lives as well. Perhaps you will find out some interesting things.” The Headmaster says and the colour drains from my face. What did he mean about that?
With a snap of his fingers, people begin to randomly appear. I can see the whole Weasley clan show up along with a short little boy and a few others. Most are Gryffindors but I do notice Matilda’s sisters show up as well. I smile at them. Reunions start across the hall, my friends next to me gossiping but Dumbledore claps his hands, silencing the room.
The wall slides open and Draco and I step in, breathing in the familiar smell. Potter comes in behind us and I am glad he doesn’t question the choice of password. Students that recognize us wave at us, a few of them ignore us because of our last name but most of them were in the same boat so they are still kind to us.
Blaise snatched it from their hands, earning yells of protest from the girls and smirked, “What’s this? A list of the hottest guys in the school? And- oh? My name at the top?”
The two nod along before stopping, “Was that an indirect insult?”
“Yeah, it’s got lots of information.” She cursed herself in her head. It was a book, of course it had information in it. The girl didn’t seem to mind but instead grinned even wider.
