“Yeah, sure. See you!” Harry waved goodbye and walked away.
Yeah there are some random POV shifts in the chapter, sorry about that
“Hmm, I think you deserve a little pleasure after all that pain” Harry said after whipping Draco several more times. He heard a “clunk” as Harry dropped the whip on the floor. “We don’t want to destroy your sweet little butt” Draco only thought that the pain had been very pleasurable, but then Harry’s hand stroking over his raw, burning behind distracted him again.
Of all the things he could have said, “We’re not together!” was the only thing to come out of Draco’s mouth.
Harry broke down crying in his arms.
“So what I wanted to talk about-“
With a sad smile, he closed his eyes. He would try not to think about the past, but he didn’t have any control about his dreams.
Well, it could have been worse!
“What the FUCK is wrong with you, Malfoy?”, Harry yelled as soon as Draco had uttered the words.
Draco still couldn’t stop staring into Harry’s eyes when he noticed him glancing down at his lips. They were being pulled down by a force stronger than gravity at the rapid speed of 0.0032 m/s. Had Draco witnessed anything this agonizingly slow himself, he would have lost his mind. Draco was not a patient person, although he had gotten better having to wait for his dates – could these be called dates? – his meetings with Harry Potter, yet he enjoyed every second of this moment, the moment he had dreamed about for a short eternity.
Draco took Harry’s hand. “Look, everyone was so excited for the dance, they didn’t even notice if you made any mistakes. And Patil loved it! Didn’t you see how happy she was getting to dance with you in front of everybody? Though she might be kind of pissed at you for ignoring her since then. Padma Patil already found herself a nice French girlfriend since Ron’s been a bit of a dick to her.”
“Okay, I better go then.” Low-key fearing for his life, Draco left the common room.
His heart ached when he thought about the old times, times that would never be again. The pain felt so real, as if a frozen blade would slowly bore into his chest. It made him feel even colder.
“You know, in the muggles have a tradition, that shortly before midnight until shortly after midnight, you should do something you really want to do. So that the old year can end like the New Year begins: Fantastically.” Harry bit his lips and looked Draco in the eye who didn’t really know where he was going with that.
“Just wait. I hope this will work…”, Draco replied.
“His treasure? You don’t mean…”
We've taken what you'll sorely miss,
They just sat there for a few hours, sometimes talking about relatively insignificant stuff, but mostly just enjoying each other’s company.
“Oh, I love it when you are overly cutesy, you can do that again tomorrow!” Draco didn’t try to hide that he was flirting anymore. Why would he? Now they both knew they had feelings for each other. Draco would never have to hide that ever again.
In the end, Harry had gotten forty-five points and was tied for first place with Cedric. Draco was very happy for his saviour. They had decided not to celebrate that night, because Harry was exhausted. Tomorrow night, though, they would meet in their secret room.
“Okay, but let’s just go over that choreography one more time anyway”
“Is that so?” Moody’s freaky eye focussed on Draco’s face. “I hope he was right to trust you, then. Good luck with your second task tomorrow, Mr. Potter” And with that, Moody limped away. Finally, Draco could breathe again.
“Yeah, sure” Harry shrugged. Oh no, he didn’t seem very invested in this!
Draco missed the dancing lessons at his home. He had to stop them when he started at Hogwarts, even though he got a few lessons during summer. That just wasn’t the same to getting to exploring new movements to new music every week.
“Okay good, because I like, wouldn’t want you think anything of it. Like funny stuff happens, doesn’t it.”
“I have heard you are getting along with Mr. Potter better recently. How… delightful.” Draco blushed. How did Snape know of this?
“Uhm, I’ll think about it.” That meant “no” in every language. Damn. “It’s getting kind of late, we should probably head back to the village”
“It’s the truth. I love you. I love you more than I love my life. I have always loved you. You mean the world to me, no, you are my whole world. I want to do this with you.”
Maybe not all at once. Small steps. First, tell Harry that he didn’t actually hate him. Then, befriend him, then ask him out. And maybe his plan would be successful after all. So he rewrote the letter to something a little less over-the-top.
“Wow.” That was all Harry said. One word. After Draco had just allowed himself to ask him a highly delicate question.
“Severus… please”
They snuck down to the dungeons, to Snape’s office. No one, not even a ghost, was in sight. This could actually work! The door to the office was locked, not with a muggle lock, but with some kind of spell. Probably the Locking Spell, Colloportus.
Draco pulled him into a tight hug. “It’s okay. I believe in you. It will be okay. I promise” He could feel the tension leaving Harry’s body. The other boy started to sob into Draco’s shoulder, trying to be as quiet as possible.
“I meant that it’s okay that you needed to get out of the hall if you didn’t feel comfortable there.”
Cedric did not appreciate that. All flustered, he responded: “I mean, I’m working on it, the egg thing, but, it’s still a far way, and also, I’m not even allowed to talk about it!”
But their moment didn’t last for long. Suddenly, Draco heard loud footsteps, and then the door to the tower opened and four robed people poured onto the ramparts. The Death Eaters must have won the fight below.
As soon as he entered the Slytherin Common Room, Pansy Parkinson jumped up.
“Now please”, Dumbledore said. “If you would please lay down on the beds. Do not worry, it will just feel like falling asleep”
“Hey, thanks for coming” Draco said with a nervous grin. Did he sound sincere enough? Did he look friendly and inviting?
“He didn’t tell me more, but how about we just go there together tonight and maybe see what we can find out.” Most of all, Draco was excited about taking a bath with Harry. He hoped that wouldn’t be too obvious.
Black hair, green eyes. The boy looked like thin, pale, demigod. He was far away, so far away! Draco ran towards him, his hands raised, ready to embrace the boy in front of him. But with every step he took, Harry was further away. Suddenly the floor disappeared and Draco fell into a black abyss, hearing Harry’s voice mumbling unintelligible words. He fell, and fell and –
“That’s not true, Harry, I just wanted a friend!” Please believe me you stupid boy, I’m just telling the truth! “I grew up alone in a giant house without any other children to play with. I never had friends before, only my parents who-“
“Harry… Don’t say that!”, Draco pleaded. “I’d be heartbroken!”
“Harry…”, Draco started but then he left his second thoughts behind himself. Almost aggressively, he hugged Harry and pulled his warm body as close to his own as possible.
Draco realized he should probably get up since this was not a conversation to be had on the floor. He held out a hand that was gladly accepted by Harry.
Draco started to randomly turning on one of the taps. A pink, bubble-gum-smelling mixture poured out. “Ugh I guess I found something even worse”, he said and quickly tried to wash it away with milky green mint liquid.
He knew it was unlikely, Potter despised him!
“That’s good.”
“Hey, uhm, I don’t know why, but I am glad that you want to leave this stupid feud behind you. I am happy to accept your offer.” He offered to shake Draco’s hand, almost like Draco’s offer of friendship at the beginning of their first year. Their handshake was firm, even though both their hands were shaking.
“It’s Potter, isn’t it, he’s under his cloak”
“Uhm… yeah… crazy how things work out sometimes” Harry was entirely clueless. He had no idea where Draco was going with this.
“Harry, you are very dear to me” he said and put his hand on his heart.
Draco forcefully ignored everything around him the entire day. Usually, potions class was alright since Professor Snape liked him, but nothing was alright that day.
“Well I told you, didn’t I? I want us to leave all this petty rivalry behind us” Draco bit his lips. In the darkness Harry’s eyes seemed to shine like green stars.
Harry was running up the stairs. He probably wanted to be alone. Draco didn’t know why or what upset him, but he couldn’t resist the temptation of getting to talk to him in private. He saw him heading towards the first-floor bathroom. The place of their first date, no, serious meeting – how romantic! The pale boy forcefully closed the door behind him – a definitive indicator that he didn’t want to talk to anyone.
Maybe he should talk to Harry before actually asking him out. Yeah, that’s what he would do today. Talk to him, figure out how Harry felt about the situation, figure out if he, at all, would want to go out with him, and then, if he was absolutely sure, ask him out, officially and unambiguously.
There was an awkward moment of silence before either one of the two realised what had happened. Awkward? No, actually, it was more of an overwhelmed, lost for words, embarrassed but blissful moment. Draco looked down at the pale angel below him. His eyes. His beautiful, warm eyes. He could get lost in their depth. A mystical green, like a forest you walk in and never find your way out. Like a calm lake in the Alps, deep, almost bottomless (Draco had gone hiking in Austria with his parents once. It had ended with Narcissa almost exposing magic by cursing the muggles who had the audacity to make her Jagatee not strong enough; Lucius blamed it on her proneness to mountain sickness and hurried Draco to finish his Mohnzeltn. They never went on holiday again after that incident. In this moment, of course, Draco was not thinking about his messed-up family, the cabin his mother almost burned down, or even delicious Mohnzeltn. All he could think about was right in front of his face: Harry James Potter.)
“We’ll figure it out. Us, together, and your friends Ron and Hermione of course. Yes, it won’t be easy, but Dumbledore thought you would be able to do it. And the old man was anything but naïve. If he believed in you, you can do it.”
“He knows Malfoy would never do anything stupid!” Harry replied.
“Oh, you want it?”
Harry took off his cloak and greeted Draco with a gentle kiss on the hand. “At your service. Sorry I was late, I had to explain snail racing to Ron.”
“Shut the hell up Malfoy, you don’t know what you’re talking about. And also, I don’t dance.”
“Accio!”, Potter shouted again. This time his firebolt came flying to him.
The Slytherin boy shyly gazed upon Harry's warm face. The emerald-green eyes with the fascinatingly long black lashes, the messy, yet shiny hair, the thin zig-zag scar on the otherwise smooth forehead. Perfection. Suddenly, he realized that he had never shared such an intimate moment with anyone. No girls were walking by and giggling at him, no smart-ass mudblood could distract the green-eyed boy now. He felt a dozen rattlesnakes in his stomach, rattling rigidly.
Draco was pretty sure that the last two things were just idle rumours (Where would something as big as a 3-headed dog hide without anybody noticing?), and Mrs. Norris was still stalking around in the school hallways.
“I mean if you need help with dancing, I could probably try and teach you” Why had he said that, why?
“We’ll find a way, Harry, I promise” Draco took Harry’s hand. “Don’t give up! You’ll do amazing in the task!”
“It might have come to your attention, that a special event is scheduled for the 25th of December this year”, Snape said as the class was almost over. “The yule ball, an old Hogwarts tradition, is being revived this year in celebration of the Triwizard Tournament. Every student, fourth year and older, can attend.”
“What made you think I had a problem?”
Since New Year’s Eve was not really a special day in Hogwarts, they decided to spend it together as well.
“Draco. Just one more time. I practised with Parvati, but I just don’t get it.” Harry seemed to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown. No surprise, he had to worry about opening the school dance in front of hundreds of people and would have to perform a potentially mortal task in two months.
“Fuck you. If you want to kill him, you have to kill me first, you traitorous coward”
Sulking, he ate his porridge. The others knew not to disturb him when he was having his moods. When Pansy Parkinson had talked to him after Draco had had a confrontation with his father, he had covered her skin in painful, green blisters. It had taken Madam Pomfrey a week to get rid of them completely. After that incident, people just avoided him when he was grumpy.
Politely, Draco asked Pansy if she wanted to dance which she affirmed happily. They swayed to the music for a bit, but it didn’t really do it for Draco. Pansy was not a good dancer, he couldn’t show off all the cool figures he knew, so it was quite boring for him. He was looking for Harry. As soon as the champions were excused, he had seemingly fled the scene. The Patil sisters were nowhere to be seen either.
“You can’t possibly consider stealing it from him! That’d be crazy!”
When they pulled apart slowly, his hand wandered up to Harry’s neck while the other one was still firmly gripping Harry’s. They deeply looked into each other’s eyes. Seconds passed while they just stood there, holding each other.
Am I crazy? Did I really just imagine a room?
He tiptoed back to the Dungeons, hoping that no-one would hear him. He was in luck. Even the common room was empty. He eased himself into the soft bed, and for the first time in weeks he fell asleep with a hopeful thought in his mind: He would see Harry’s reaction in the morning.
“You couldn’t have done anything to save him, he wanted it that way, it was planned from the start.” Draco tried to comfort Harry, but he was in too much pain to pay him much mind, so he decided to just hug him without saying anything.
Harry was scrawny, all skin and bones, but in Draco’s eyes there was a certain elegance about him that had an effect on the boy that he couldn’t explain with words.
Without a word, Snape walked towards Dumbledore, pushing Draco and out of the way. The three Death Eaters and Fenrir Greyback took a few steps back.
He took a deep breath, and started to walk along the corridor. I need to figure out a way to breathe under water. I need to figure out a way to stay under water for an hour and survive. I need to figure out a way to breathe under water. He thought repeatedly. And sure enough, a door appeared.
Everybody was talking about this Potter-boy. The black-haired, skinny orphan. The little kid who defeated the Dark Lord. The boy who lived.
“Hey, come on, that’s really not that hard, dear”, Draco tried to calm him down. “It’s just a guess, but maybe the task has to do with the merepeople”
“Potter?”, Alecto spit. “Oh, it will be a pleasure to bring you to the Dark Lord personally. I can already imagine how he will reward me”
“No, I wasn’t. I was out of step, I messed up the lifts, I didn’t even start at the right time. It was horrible. Parvati hates me now, probably, for embarrassing her.” Harry looked like he was about to start crying.
“Awe, Harry, seriously? Did you actually think Dumbledore would let us drown?”
So sorry for the delay in updates... I was overwhelmed with procrastination and writers’ block, but I’m over most of it. Updates should be regular again after this! Thanks for sticking with me Xx
“We need to talk.”
“No!” I call out, all the authority I can muster put into my voice. It’s a command, not to be argued with. Harry instantly falls silent, Hermione’s pen slowing down as she finishes the note.
?!” Malfoy gestures at himself. “I believe it was
Draco needs to get back to the cottage. He needs to tell Potter about this advancement. About the random piece of dyed cotton that simply has to mean something. Potter might know something about it. He’s the reason they’re here in the first place, after all. Draco runs, seeing the ground fly beneath his feet yet not taking anything in. The world blurs around him, so strong is his intent to get to Potter and explain everything to someone other than himself. If anyone can help get them out of here, it’s the idiot he’s stuck with. Briefly, he notes that he’s finally entered the forest. The ground is softer but fuller, the sky suddenly blocked with heavy branches. That thought leaves as quickly as it arrived, and Draco only knows the ducking and swerving needed to run through the trees. He bends below branches that would otherwise slap him in the face, and he skids around trees. Multiple times he almost slips on the still-icy ground, but he always manages to somehow catch himself.
“I asked first,” Potter says. His smile softens, just a lift at the corners of his mouth.
Harry chuckles as he withdraws from his boyfriend and lies down on his own towel. He turns his back to the sky, mirroring Draco, and closes his eyes. He allows the sound of waves crashing and children laughing to calm himself into a daze.
“Yeah, I figured we should go check out the Vanishing Cabinet
“Did no one ever tell you not to turn your back on the ocean?” Harry asks, all innocence.
*~*~*~
“Makes sense. Who knows, maybe you’ll have to tutor me!” Potter laughs at that and I try to. I know for a fact I will have to, as his name was on Slughorn’s list.
“Don’t hurt yourself,” Draco mutters, not looking up from the papers.
The class muffle their laughs quickly, and I turn towards Potter. I set my glaring gaze on the boy, but he just smirks right back at me. I roll my eyes at him and turn back to the front, where I begin to pay attention. I can’t let that happen again.
Harry lifts his eyebrows. “Impossible.”
“I may have a couple ideas.”
“I’ve clearly spent too much time with you,” Draco replies, passing the blame off to Harry effortlessly.
Draco nods, shuts his eyes. He does, he just hadn’t expected to see it so plainly.
“We’re all armed!”
Harry turns back around and kneels before the damage. He starts rummaging through the rubble, looking for anything that seems out of place or different in some way. He turns plaster over and examines it from every angle. He smashes bricks further, looking for any cavities to hold something, any drawings that could be runes. The only thing he’s found when he’s finished is dust and plaster. Sighing, Harry backs away and waves his wand in a shape resembling the letter ‘a’, and he watches as the bits of wall pick themselves up and reassemble into a wall. He runs his hand through his hair and turns to face the next wall. As an Auror, Harry’s had a lot of practise doing this. Most of his coworkers use more gentle spells to probe the walls, but since Malfoy has already checked for tampering he’s probably used those ones already. It’s not that Harry doesn’t trust his competency, rather that he’d like to see the proof for himself. So here he is, blowing up walls to make sure the Ferret didn’t miss anything.
“Oh,” I say. “That kind of makes sense.”
Harry sputters as he wakes, hands tightening around where Draco’s are on him. “Malfoy? What’s happening?”
“Then how come I didn’t know?”
“Potter,” Draco bites out. Despite having worked with the man for three years on and off, he never gets used to seeing him. The fact that he’s also been pulled over here so early means that something must be
Harry stops them though. Only for a brief second, as he picks Draco up off the ground. Draco immediately wraps his legs around Harry’s waist, and starts kissing the neck in front of him. Harry lowers Draco a little bit, and their erections touch through their pants. Draco feels a thrill go through him, and he bites down on Harry’s neck. Delighting in the bruise that will bloom there shortly, Draco moves to the other side. Harry grunts heavily, before starting to walk them backwards. Well, he’s walking straight ahead, but for Draco it’s definitely backwards. Draco doesn’t know where they are going, but he assumes it is somewhere with a big bed. His assumption is proven correct when he is dropped to the ground. He hums with disappointment at the broken kiss, but when Harry opens a door and Draco sees the room, he forgives Harry completely.
He wars with himself silently, his mind taking a different side than his body. His fingers itch with the need to track down Potter’s skin, tingle with the desire to feel Potter beneath him. His mind is more reasonable though. There’s no point touching something that can’t ever be, that Draco won’t ever be able to have. Potter would surely snap his hand off if he knew what Draco was thinking about. But that’s just it, isn’t it? Potter’s asleep, and Draco just woke up next to him.
*~*~*~
Harry hums. “What?”
After another second, the grey magic sweeps over the courtyard. It spikes up in places, curves gently over others. Harry knows without a word from Draco, that the courtyard’s magic is on clear display right now.
“That was amazing,” Harry says, ducking his head into his shoulder.
Potter grunts. “Not nothing if you’re reading it.”
By the time he reaches the Muggle Studies rooms, Malfoy is nowhere in sight. Cursing loudly, he pulls the map back out and finds his dot standing in front of the Hospital Wing. There are also two other dots with names Harry doesn’t recognise. Realising that they are probably being unfairly scolded by Malfoy, he starts making his way over to the Hospital Wing. His footsteps echo loudly off the stone walls, but he doesn’t care. As he rounds a small corner, he sees a shock of white-blond hair and dark, swirling robes. Malfoy. Harry jogs up to the other man and comes to a halt next to him. Malfoy only pauses in his disapproving lecture to the two young boys—possibly in Third or Fourth Year—for a split second to smirk at Harry, before docking house points and sending the boys to bed. Harry stares uselessly after the retreating boys in bewilderment. Neither of them look remotely upset or threatened. Apparently  Malfoy was
“Let’s go home,” Draco murmurs into his ear, his hands roaming up Harry’s chest.
“The village.”
“You’re really gonna do this, Malfoy?”
Harry shakes his head. “That doesn’t help.” A grin splits his face, and he backs away. “I guess that’s the point though, isn’t it?”
“Cool. Why didn’t you tell me?”
“Then let’s open it!” I exclaim, almost tripping over myself to move closer. Too close, really. Oh well. This is important, and I refuse to feel stupid for standing to close to Potter. Honestly.
Draco peels his eyes and looks around again, searching for any sign of recent domesticity. There aren’t any. No indents in carpet, no footsteps on rugs, no wet rings left over from glasses or mugs on coffee tables. Nothing gives itself away at being used recently. Not one thing is out of place. It’s too perfect. Maybe Draco’s overreacting and there’s nothing here, but that would be woefully out of character for him. He is one of the fastest Unspeakables in England, if he thinks something is off it usually is.
“Christmas cracker, dear?” She asks, trying to ease the tension in the air.
Harry nods, clawing Draco to him. His back cracks as it leaves it’s curled position against the cabinets, but he smiles when Harry rubs it for him. They’d fix this together.
“Absolutely.” He tries to take another sip of his water, only to find the glass still empty. He blushes furiously at making such an idiot of himself. “
His hand moves again as Draco slows his thrusts, milking the last of his orgasm out. He licks up and down Draco’s cock, pulling the last drops out of him and leaving nothing behind. Harry’s hand swipes across his mouth, wiping away the spit and come. He catches Draco’s eyes and holds it to his mouth, darting his tongue out to swallow that too. Draco groans at the sight and flops down, his arm coming up to cover his eyes as he shakes in the aftershocks.
“Oh, um. I technically wasn’t meant to tell anyone…”
“A reasonable one, this time?”
dizzy, so he hopes it has the same effect on Draco. He slides down further, taking more and more of Draco’s cock into his mouth. It’s warm and sensitive, and he’s pulling Draco apart. Harry moans around it, swirling his tongue over the skin in his mouth.
“What was stopping her?”
Draco closes them, breathing in deeply. He probably looks ridiculous. Oh well, it’s for Harry. He can survive being laughed at for Harry.
? Draco doesn’t know, and he hates the uneven footing between them right now. Of course, he says none of this out loud. “What about?” He asks, carefully smoothing his voice out to hide his unease.
while the other doesn’t at all. Sighing, I fold the page up and tuck it under my pillow, an old habit.
“What’s- fuck- happening?” I manage to get out between cries.
I shuffle in my seat and hear someone say my name a couple seats over. I train my ears to that spot, and listen intensely.
“What does it even
“It’s a spell of my own,” the wizard says. “Not recognisable as the Killing Curse without green light, but essentially the same spell.”
“That was insane,” Draco chuckles, staring into green eyes.
“I don’t think it would be much of one for me, but for you on the other hand…”
Harry smiles against his neck, Draco can feel it even if he can’t see it. He smiles too, and drifts off to sleep in Harry’s arms.
They continue walking, taking in the new plants and startling at the beds flying past them. The conversation isn’t picked up again, but Harry finds that he doesn’t particularly care. Just walking with Malfoy is enough, comfortable silence lingering in the air, a pleasant stillness which is almost calming. He would never have thought they’d be able to achieve even this. Not six years ago, not when they were at each other’s throats. Not when Harry nearly killed him.
Harry beams at Draco and pulls him down for a chaste kiss. Draco blushes at a combination of Harry’s kiss and the way he phrased that sentence.
“Yep,” Harry says. “That was one of the reasons I picked it. It’s an interesting dynamic.”
“It was Potter, wasn’t it?”
it means. He can’t bring himself to, it will hurt too much when it goes up in flames. Or is buried under snow, as the season calls for.
“You’re burning up,” Potter murmurs. He snaps his fingers and a glass appears in his hand, he quickly fills it with an
who brought in that stupid Vanishing Cabinet!”
Malfoy shakes his head. “It’s hideous.”
“So the front bookstore is a muggle one?”
“But I’m
Potter comes running up the stairs, barging into the drawing room.
“What’s this?”
Draco is too out of it to remember this, surely. Hopefully. He doesn’t seem to mind the action, pushing back at Harry and moaning softly. Harry wants to growl. Wants to put him back down onto the couch and press into his neck. He wonders what he tastes like, how he’ll react to lips on his throat.
By the time he’s finished, the basket is quite full. It’s more than he was expecting, but she won’t be complaining. Aside from the first bath bomb, there is: a pink, white, and orange one that smells like roses—he thought he
“It makes my mind too fast. It’s too hard to concentrate on the important information when it’s trying to take everything else in too.”
“Exactly. Lucius will have free rein over her. Who knows what he’ll do.” I feel tears welling in my eyes, and I grit my teeth to stop them falling. I don’t want Harry to see me cry, not when we just won a battle.
Harry’s eyebrows rise up his forehead. “A competition? Well,
And then there’s Slytherin.
“On second thought, the sofa might not be too bad.”
By the time they run their tests and confirm that yes, there is a weird trace of magic over the whole thing, the sun is setting. The Vanishing Cabinet, nearly forgotten in light of the breakthrough, is now pushed away from the fountain again. Harry is crouching by the secret drawer they’d revealed last time, examining it from his haunches. Draco is standing in front of the Cabinet, trying to look for signs of magical exhaustion.
Harry chuckles, his eyes roaming over Draco freely from the other side of the coffee table. Draco does the same, his eyes lingering on Harry’s sweater — a deep maroon with a silver ‘H’ knitted in carefully — and his black, ripped skinny jeans. He recognises them as the ones from the other night. From the first night, because here they are for a second.
“Some blood curse left over from an ancestor resurfaced with her. She was doomed from the start, we just didn’t know when.”
“As you are all well aware by now, this year is quite unusual for us at Hogwarts. We have an Eighth Year for the first time. This means that we have to slightly adjust things to make this year work smoothly. In order to do this, the School Administration has decided to create a new leadership role within Eighth Year. These roles will be called ‘House Representatives’ and there will be one for each House. Now, I know I’ve already been over this, but
Everyone tries to talk over each other, all chastising the wizard and questioning his judgement.
“Demelza! Watch it!” I twist towards the voice who warned her, and scowl at Weasley. He must be getting agitated, not being able to block our scores, so now he’s warning his players. Robins ducks out of the way, the Bludger missing her by mere centimetres.
seriously to find whatever it is he’s after. Harry has no idea what he means by ‘the bracelets’ other than the fact he’s probably referencing their friends’ ones.
“Fuck! Harry,” he grunts. He pushes his hips forward, lifting off the mattress beneath him. One of Harry’s hands starts pulling at the elastic waistband, and suddenly Draco is stark naked. His pants have been discarded somewhere in the room — probably on the bed, but Draco isn’t exactly thinking straight — and Harry swiftly licks a stripe up Draco’s cock. Draco’s muscles clench, his body arching. Harry does it again, before licking a circle around the cock head. Draco’s eyes slam closed, and he moans loudly. The head of his cock is encompassed in warmth now, and he has to stop himself from thrusting up. Harry’s mouth is heaven. Warm, tight, and moist.
Draco groans in reply, turning his face into the pillow. It still smells like Harry.
Draco looks into his earnest face, emerald eyes shining in the light of the fire.
“Oh, and one more thing,” he says as I am halfway out the door. “I need you to go retrieve Mr. Longbottom from your Common Room. Tell him it’s about his ‘power plant potion’ and he’ll understand.” I let the ghost of a smile show on my lips to tell Slughorn I heard, and step out into the corridor.
“What do you mean?” I add a touch of a sneer into my voice, not wanting him to see inside me anymore.
“Bones wants a group of tables over here, adjacent to the lake. Looks like it is the refreshments table,” Harry starts. I nod, it makes sense. “There is a jukebox over there,” he points opposite the tables, “ and another there,” he moves his hand a smidge to the left. He walks over a couple metres before stopping in front of the lake, confusion riddling his features.
“Oh no,” Malfoy says. “That sounds like you know from experience.”
Potter beams, grin stretching from ear to ear. “So… you might be able to find a way to get back to London?”
“You just, I don’t know, zoned out.”
Potter’s eyes widen and he sits up in a rush, hands reaching for Draco. “Shit I’m so sorry, I didn’t think—”
“You’re very welcome,
“Another?” The bartender, a polished young man with dark skin and darker hair, asks immediately. Draco nods firmly and hands more money over. Taking the second margarita, he wanders away from the bar and finds a secluded table in the back corner. He relishes his cool drink as he sits, watching the bodies move in front of him. The music is deafening and pulsing, altering the beat of his heart. Flashing lights fly over head, illuminating sweaty chests in colourful bursts.
want to risk it again. He puts the
Forcibly shaking himself back into action, he walks swiftly to the bar and asks for a margarita with an added splash of Grand Marnier. Handing his money over the counter, he takes a long draught of the drink before slamming it back down.
Malfoy gives a dry laugh. “I know.”
Harry only walks back to Draco, determined as ever. “I want to thank you in another way…” Harry confesses, pulling his bottom lip into his mouth suggestively.
“Such as? I’d already done the same thing; without the mess, might I add!”
“Fuck!
Draco nods. “I do, yes.”
“If it’ll help me figure out their strategies, that would be great.”
“Accio glasses,” he grumbles, his voice still rough from sleep.
Their friends fall silent, all turning expectant eyes to Draco. Harry smiles at him and stands up too, joining their hands together.
“Come on,” he says, sliding back down Draco’s body. “I have unfinished business down here.”
“Scorpius James Potter-Malfoy.”
“Good afternoon, young sirs. How may I help you?”
“No! You’ve ignored me all term, and I want to know why!”
Harry turns to Malfoy, and finds him staring right back already. His gaze burns into Harry, setting him alight.
“That’s strange,” Harry says the second they’re out of ear shot.
“It’s so
Potter chuckles at that. “The only person I can think of is Hermione, but I doubt her morals would allow her to do something like this. She’s always worried about how her actions might affect someone else.” He pauses, seeming to think for a second. “I honestly don’t think it could be any of the others either. I mean, Ron and Dean are strong enough to move the trees, but aren’t going to be the brains behind
Mistake.
Potter grins, like Draco had just said exactly what he had wanted him to say. “I don’t know…” he says as he steps forward. “Maybe a reminder of las-”
“I did,” I gasp out.
Harry sighs and stops his pacing. He turns to the sink and pours himself a glass of water, tipping it down his throat and swallowing quickly. He’s tired with worry, but he knows he has to do something. He can’t allow Malfoy to die somewhere because he himself couldn’t be bothered to look for him. He has to go out into the forest and village, and turn it inside out. He needs to find Malfoy and drag his pale ass back to the cottage. Even if he isn’t in danger and just tried to run away, he wouldn’t have been able to get to London by walking. He could have tried Apparating, but they’ve both already figured out that that doesn’t seem to work. It’s possible the forest is magic and it’s preventing them from leaving, but they couldn’t Apparate from the cottage either. Hm.
Potter said that? Of course the man would let Draco starve at the bottom of a pit, he was a Death Eater!
Harry blows out a breath, his hair flying up and drifting back down again. “Yeah, that’s a good point.”
“Shopping.” He pauses thoughtfully. “And I’d stop doing that if I were you.”
“What is it?” I ask Potter, hoping that he’ll know. I’m not disappointed.
“Let’s go back to bed,” Harry says, gently nudging him back onto the mattress. Draco sinks down and falls to the pillows. Harry leans over and kisses him gently—once on the forehead and once on the lips—and pulls the covers back up over them. He turns to Draco and wraps his arms around him, settling him enough to sleep peacefully until the sun rises.
Harry silently thanks the Ferret for giving him an opening, and plunges in without a second thought. “I’m not sleeping on the couch again.”
I’m no longer the Slytherin Prince, not since my father foolishly chose me over the Dark Lord. I don’t know what came over him, we all could have been slaughtered.
“Are you okay?” Harry asks, concerned.
Light pours out of the room into the corridor, and my eyes instinctively shut with a snap to avoid going blind.
Malfoy laughs at him, a true, ringing laugh, and sends the board flying back to the bedroom.
“Look who’s the sappy emotional one now, hmm?” Draco murmurs, leaning into the touch.
could make him walk away.
Harry shuffles back slowly, hoping not to draw any attention to himself. The universe always has other plans though, and all eyes immediately fix on him.
“My issue? Which one?” I ask him in a deadpan voice, eyes meeting his.
Draco agrees. “How would no one know who founded it either? That’s astonishing, considering they or their children could still be alive.”
close… “I did, didn’t I?”
have plans, actually, and I would highly recommend leaving the cottage so I can achieve them.”
As I enter Hogsmeade, I glance around. After the war, most of the town was destroyed, burned to the ground. If you didn’t know, however, you would never guess it. Unlike Hogwarts, with its charms and spells to stop the castle caving in, Hogsmeade looks the same. No cracked, burned down, destroyed buildings. No upturned roads, paths, or trees. It’s almost like someone went back in time, and placed the memory into present day.
Draco starts, not expecting that at all. He thinks about it though. He doesn’t really work out that much, doing the bare minimum to stay fit enough for his job and not much else. The idea of exercising alongside Potter is… a bit thrilling, honestly. Draco doesn’t know why, but he doesn’t care. He nods, accepting the offer, and pulls the traitorous hoodie off.
One of the most surprising things to come out of his Eighth Year was Draco and him putting their past behind them. Becoming friends with his supposed enemy of seven years was shocking to say the least, but Harry had made it work. Draco was no longer the terrified boy trying to survive, he was an adult who had lived through the wrong side of the war and was now trying to make amends. He was the man who no longer laughed at Harry, but instead laughed at his jokes. Harry yearns for the only quiet year he ever experienced as a student; the only year he wasn’t running from a psychotic murderer.
Potters input scares me, and I wonder how long he’s been standing in the doorway. “Weren’t you at the Ministry?”
forgot.”
She ignores my cursing, but fixes me with an odd look. “I didn’t, not really. I
She hums, thinking out loud. “We’ll have to find someone else then. Someone you could help from the outside…” Her muggle quill moves across the page again.
“I mean that I’m sleeping in the bed tonight, whether you like it or not.”
“I know, I shouldn’t have said anyth— Wait.
He collapses onto Draco, crushing his legs and covering his own chest in sticky come. Harry doesn’t care though, pressing kisses all over Draco’s chest as he slowly pulls out.
“You’re right, Potter. This is the duplicate, the other one is the first.”
“Corrupted?”
The girl, I distantly think her name is Abigail, shows me the board of mutated roots. I expel a breath, wishing to be pulled under, and slowly shake my head. I demonstrate once again how to cut the ginger, and she nods. This time, I decide I’ll guide her hand with my own, and see if she gets it. Her hand is small and cold beneath mine, and she startles when I grasp it.
“Hey, Malfoy!” Expecting Harry to wrap his arms around my waist like he’s been doing, I’m startled when I’m instead shoved against a wall. Except now I can see that it’s
The others in the room all disperse, slowly trickling into the rest of the department. Harry catches Robards’ eye, and notes with a small satisfaction that he looks extremely uncomfortable. His head is also remarkably bald, and Harry feels like snickering at it. A dark part inside himself is pleased that he’s being punished in some small way for his part in this. When Luna follows after him though, hand in hand with Neville, Harry’s heart picks back up. This mess of an experiment has clearly helped some other people get over themselves too.
. It’s probably
of people.”
Draco hums in thought. “It's plausible, I’ll give you that, but I’m not sure how likely it is. I mean, I haven’t felt anything and we’ve been here for just over two weeks now.”
“I want to know what I’m relying on to get back to London.”
Without any warning, I lunge forward into the group and drop the light all the way down. It’s so dark I can’t see anything at all, not even the fake me. The other three gasp and shriek, and run after my duplicate.
“What is it?” He breathes, captivated by what must be glass.
Harry nods. “Mhmm.”
She shakes her head. “I would know if there was a cottage. I ran through the forest every day for
, but here he is. Coloured steam spreads from his wand, shades of orange washing over the courtyard. It’s amazing how the different pace affects the entire spell, swapping yellow flames out with orange steam.
Draco feels his cheeks warm at that. Harry must be looking really closely to be able to tell that. He tries to turn away, making a beeline for the jeweller. His mum would love a new pair of earrings.
“I’m going to go fetch tea. Do you want some?” So that’s why he’s getting up. Granger hums in agreement, and I politely accept. Horror races the length of my spine at being left alone, I’m with Granger, but it’s close enough. I force myself to stamp it down.
“Do you have proof? This is serious.”
“It’s an army cry. Someone is armed.”
, he rushes forward for Harry. Draco brings his hands up to Harry’s neck, and pulls their heads together. He stares into vibrant green eyes, watching as they slowly cloud over. Harry’s thumbs stroke at Draco’s cheeks, and that is really the ultimate straw. Draco tilts his head and presses his lips to Harry’s. The kiss starts off hungry, riddled with desire and need. They have both been on edge all day, and Draco really needs to release some of his energy. Having thought of little else since the first night, he can’t believe that it’s happening again.
The thoughts of Malfoy starving at the bottom of that hole bring back memories. Long suppressed memories of his childhood. They feel like they happened to another person, but they didn’t. Harry shudders as he remembers lying awake for hours, staring at the ceiling of his cupboard while his stomach rumbled. There’s nothing quite like being rejected food. He swallows thickly again and rushes into the bathroom. While he was alone in the cottage not doing anything yesterday, he’d gone prodding around the cupboards.
As they duck through the branches at the edge of the forest and walk towards the courtyard, Draco takes a second to observe Potter. The man is wearing a navy blue coat, and it actually appears quite new. It was probably a gift from Granger, if the sleeves include little thumb holes. He squints, trying to catch a glimpse—  and yes! They do.
A few minutes later, Draco runs back into the living room, hands full. He drops the cotton, leather, and one of the bracelets onto the coffee table.
I’m pulled from my thoughts by a hand on my shoulder. Shaking my head, I look up and see Potter and a woman with light brown hair staring at me. “Sorry. May you repeat that?”
“Tell Harry what you just told me,” Draco says, voice substantially angrier than earlier.
Malfoy shrugs, as if to say ‘why not?’
“Yeah, fine. Why?”
“It’s lube,” Draco accuses, eyes dropping back to the bottle.
The shower water is blissfully warm, scalding hot and turning Draco’s skin pink. Showers are a much wanted reprieve in the middle of winter, the one thing that actually warms up a cold body. Blankets and cups of tea can only do so much after all. Draco’s flat back home has a beautiful bath, and he makes a habit in December and January—and let’s be real, February too—to sit submerged in the hot water and read. It’s always a pleasant experience, and it leaves him ready for the day once the chill has been removed from his bones. Today though, there is simply no time to indulge in such a feat. Draco has a lot he needs to do today, and he will have to brave the cold outside later anyway.
Neither one of them realised this, but Harry was unconsciously appalled by the thought of dancing with anyone but Draco. Even though he didn’t think he was anything but horrible, the movement of their bodies harmonised so well their dancing actually looked fine.
Draco dreaded entering the Slytherin common room. What would his house mates say to him being Harry Potter’s hostage, the person Harry Potter cared for the most in all of Hogwarts? He took a deep breath and said the password. As soon as he set foot into the common room, he saw them. The banners of him and Harry surrounded by hearts. On some of them they even kissed. Draco’s head burned.
Professor Binns was floating around and babbling something no one in their right mind would have the patience to follow. Draco had the perfect seat, diagonally behind Harry, and simply stared at him for most of the class.
“NOOO!!!”, Harry screamed and jumped in front of Dumbledore
Draco released a breath of relieve. “Thank you. Do you want to talk about it?”
“Yeah, me neither. Wizards don’t seem to celebrate it for some reason, and at the Dursleys’, I was just always locked away while they had a celebration or visited people or whatever”
Harry moved even closer to Draco which meant he practically sat on him, and gave him a pleading look. “I know you feel the same way about me, or at least you somewhat like me. Otherwise you wouldn’t have gone through all this trouble. So please say something, so that I know I did not spend the entire morning trying to think of the most cheesy, romantic words possible to tell you how I feel about you just so I can embarrass myself.”
Harry had picked Draco up at ten so that they could share his cloak of invisibility and wouldn’t get caught and they decided to have a goofy little two-person dance party until midnight. The magical DJ, created by Draco’s mind, played the greatest muggle songs of their time, from Smells Like Teen Spirit to I’m too Sexy, the latter resulting in Harry giving him a playful striptease.
“They’re not all bad…”, he half-heartedly defended his housemates, but he knew that Harry was essentially right. “But thank you, I’ll consider your kind offer. So, how’s it going with that egg?”
“Are you sure about this? After all, I’ll have to eat this, I don’t fancy poisoning myself”
The thought of having to see Harry dance with someone else was almost unbearable. Why couldn’t he just swap roles with Parvati and she could hang out with Pansy and talk about their dresses or whatever girls do while he danced with Harry? He deserved it more anyways, he invested time and work into building this painfully platonic relationship, Parvati just happened to be lucky.
“Don’t you have anyone else to pester?” In that moment, they heard Padma laugh brightly She was flirting with a pretty Beauxbatons-girl. Served Ron right. He, though, only seemed to pity himself. Padma and the French girl started dancing slowly, and tightly. Their arms were wrapped around each other. Draco was internally cheering for them.
“It won’t be easy, though, we don’t even know what the other Horcruxes are yet. Dumbledore didn’t leave me much to go on.”
“Why? Why do you want to suddenly get along, after you enjoyed nothing more than to humiliate me? All those years, Draco, all those years you bullied me, you antagonized the other students, you abused my other friends, too, Hermione most of all. Do you just want to pretend that never happened?” Harry’s voice was getting louder with every word. Draco desperately tried to keep his cool.
“Oh my god I’m so sorry are you okay?”, Harry asked after snapping out of his trance.
“So are those rumours actually true?” Draco couldn’t believe it, a Gryffindor Quidditch hero was sneaking out at night to meet a Beauxbaton.
“How about we try something else?”, Harry asked with a twinkle in his eyes. Suddenly, he was holding a bottle of lube that wasn’t in the room one second ago. The ginormous canopy bed behind them wasn’t either.
“Come here”, Harry invited Draco finally and offered him his arm. They snuggled close together. Moments passed, or it could have been hours. They didn’t say anything, they just enjoyed each other’s skin on their skin.
They were on the patio, sitting under a tree and seemingly having the time of their lives. Draco would surely end that soon. “Aranea!” he whispered and pointed his wand at the tree. A bunch of small spiders rained out of it. Maybe reading the weird books at Borgin and Burkes while he waited for his father to finish up his shady business with the shopkeeper did have some use after all.
“Yeah, you didn’t really have a good start here, I mean, you almost died every year at least once!”
Quickly, Draco bent forwards and whispered into Harry’s ears. “Come to the seventh floor after lunch, I have something to show to you.”
“Draco, do you maybe want to go down and dance for a bit?” Harry asked with a scarlet-red face.
Before he managed to say anything, Pansy blurted out: “I thought you asked me to the dance meant you might like me. You don’t. I got that.” She didn’t seem to be mad, just disappointed. “And if you and Harry Potter are together now, I guess that’s it. I don’t care, I’ll get over it. Just don’t bloody abandon me in the middle of a fucking ball again, you asshole!”
“You’re welcome, my love” Harry smiled at Draco.
They counted down together.
That nerd just smiled at him as if they had been friends for years. “Good, and you?” Arrogant bastard.
H., meet me at the usual place during lunch. I’ve had an idea!
“I know, but it has to be here somewhere” Then, finally, something caught Draco’s eye. A jar on the very top shelf, filled with vile looking, slimy, grey-green rat tails. It matched the description perfectly!
Then the day of the first contest came. All four Champions had to defeat a monstrous, giant, fire-breathing dragon. Draco was excited for this day. He had a foible for violence. Potter had bad luck that day. His opponent was the Hungarian Horntail, well-known as the most dangerous dragon ever.
“Good evening, Amycus,” said Dumbledore who had been watching everything that went down between Draco and Harry calmly, “And you’ve brought Alecto too. …Charming…”
You better have a damn good explanation for this.
1997, Draco’s sixth year
“What?” Harry didn’t really know what these smart-sounding words meant.
“You did great, Harry! You were amazing!” Draco didn’t understand how Harry didn’t see how good he was.
“Well, according to the book, it’s grey-green in colour, slimy, and resembles rat tails”
Instead of getting up, or at least increasing the distance between their faces which, in this moment, was slightly less than five inches, Draco ever so slowly lowered his head. They weren’t touching yet, well, apart from their chest, legs, crotch,… but their faces were still separated by a significant amount of air.
Then, ever so slowly, the hand travelled to his front. Down his right thigh, and up to his belly again, then down his other thigh. The centre of Draco’s pleasure burned with passion. If only Harry would give him what he had desired for so long. He was completely at his boyfriend’s mercy. Oh god, they were actually boyfriends.
“He wouldn’t know if he had been confunded now, would he?”, Amycus hissed.
“Draco, I’m sorry.”
“Spinnet! What are you doing here?”
“Man, I don’t even know what my problem was. I just kinda needed some quiet.”
Never before had Draco been so nervous upon entering the Great Hall. He scarfed down a dry slice of toast while anxiously awaiting the owls to deliver the mail. Even though their tables were far apart, Draco tried his best to keep an eye on Harry.
“Look who’s back, it’s Loverboy!”, Pansy Parkinson shrieked.
He felt naked, of course he was naked, but being naked in a room with Harry was a feeling of vulnerability that he had not known before.
Now he realized that Potter had always been special for him. They hated each other, but they also needed each other more than anyone else. And now that Draco had looked through the hate, he could see something different.
In order to be able to spend more time with him, Draco helps Harry figure out the egg riddle.
“I only want to be there for you. I want to be everything you need. For you.” He thought about how different everything would have been if he had never fallen in love with Harry. If he hadn’t been there for him at the tower, if Harry hadn’t been able to talk him down from killing Dumbledore himself. What a terrible thought. That would have been a very different story. But love can truly change a story.
When they finally broke away, out of breath yet unwillingly, they stared into each other’s eyes and didn’t know what to say.
“Uhm, I don’t think I want to do that, but thank you for the offer, Sir,” Draco said awkwardly.
The next summer had come and gone, but his feelings for Harry still hadn’t died down. Even if things with the Dark Lord had gotten serious. He had even been made an official Death Eater. And he had been tasked with a very important assignment: To kill Albus Dumbledore. The Dark Lord himself had given him that task. Failure was not an option, even if that meant irreparably destroying his relationship with Harry. Then he had that thought, that horrible thought, yet again. He tried to push it away, but it still stung like a bee. Dumbledore was not the only one the Dark Lord wanted dead. The one he wanted dead more than anyone else was Harry himself.
“Yes, of course, I’ll not pick on anyone anymore I promise!” He was serious, he wouldn’t risk antagonizing Harry again over that Mudbl- over Granger.
Draco could see how Cedric internally debated whether to give up his high moral standards or let his father face unemployment. Finally, he reached a conclusion. “Okay, but you’re a dirty rat and you know it. Tell Krum or whoever you’re harassing people for to take a bath at the Prefects’ Bathroom on the fifth floor and calm his tits for a moment, then he’ll figure it out. The password is ‘pine fresh’. Just never ever talk to me again.” Then he stormed off. Draco hadn’t really gotten what he asked for, but he decided to let him get away with that. He didn’t want him to break down in tears.
“Well whatever stressed you out”
“Oh… well, of course, no problem, I know it’s probably not an easy decision, you’re a Triwizard Champion after all, take your time”, Draco rambled.
“You don’t understand”, he cried. “He will kill them. My parents. He will kill them if I don’t kill him.”
“Okay, no problem!”, Draco replied and got up. They walked to the door and said goodbye with a soft, intimate kiss.
It was already eleven, but Draco needed Harry to get this letter as fast as possible, so he snuck out of the dorm and to the owlery. His owl, that he had secretly named Henry V, was sleeping on the perch. Luckily, Draco would recognise his proud eagle owl anywhere, even in almost complete darkness.
More Awkward silence ensued.
There was a person leaning on the wall, apparently trying to disguise themselves behind one of the suits of armour. Didn’t he know that person? Despite the darkness, he recognised her: Alicia Spinnet!
They gasped for air in sync. Draco was shaking a little from being overwhelmed, but kissed Harry back when he felt his lips on his own. The taste of the aromatic bath water and, well, something else aroused him again. However, now it was his turn to please Harry. His hands wandered down his body until they found what they were looking for. If he wanted to use his mouth, he’d have to hurry. Following Harry’s example, he took a deep breath and submerged himself in the water. The feeling of not being able to breathe, the sound of the Golden Egg still underwater, being so close to Harry – all that turned him on so much that he came again, at the same time as Harry did.
I know we haven’t always gotten along, but I want to put this petty feud behind us. Isn’t it awfully immature to fight while you have so many much more important things on your plate?
“Did someone not get enough sleep last night?” Professor McGonagall asked while Draco was trying not to doze off.
“Hey, Neville has this book as well! I think he got it from Professor Moody!”, Harry exclaimed.
Draco blushed “Oh come here, you magnificent being.” He pulled Harry into a long, tender kiss. Their first kiss since year four. It wasn’t a kiss of raw passion like the ones they had shared in their magic room, it was a kiss of deep longing, almost desperation.
Parting was bittersweet. But at least Draco felt Harry’s lips burning on his face until he fell asleep happily to the sweetest of dreams.
Draco could hear the blonde man as if he stood right next to his bed.
There were steps approaching. Draco prayed they were Harry’s. The bathroom door opened, but there was no one standing there.
“Harry.”, said Draco.
“Shut up. Yeah maybe I like him, what’s the big deal? At least he likes me back, not like that Ravenclaw girl you have the hots for, Zabini. And he’s not my boyfriend.” Not yet at least. Maybe Draco should seek to change that.
“Potter? Liking me? Ridiculous!”, Draco attempted to cover his nervousness.
“What? Did you bloody follow me?” Harry asked in disbelieve.
Draco awoke feeling anxious just like before getting home over the Christmas holidays. Goddammit, it was almost Christmas as well! He would have to face his father again, and according to the letters he had received from home, things with his parents weren’t going too well. His mother Narcissa had apparently tried to get sober for a month, which ended with her ending up with alcohol poisoning after an almost successful week. Lucius was not much of a drinker, but when Narcissa was doing badly, he was in a bad mood as well.
Draco waited next to the entrance. Harry was late. That wasn’t usually his style. Suddenly, he heard light steps but no person was to be seen. That must be him. “Harry”, he whispered. “Where are you?”
Officially and unambiguously. That’s what Pansy said. And today, he was going to do it. Ask Harry Potter out officially and unambiguously.
The following battle was a blur, Draco only remembered throwing curses around and then ending up at the Astronomy Tower, staring into Dumbledore’s eyes.
Minutes had passed, minutes that felt like hours, since Harry had left the library and Draco decided it was time to try to get back to the Dungeons.
Usually, he would be too proud to let anybody be sassy with him, but this wasn’t a usual night. This night would change everything, Draco could feel that. His heart was beating twice as fast as usual and he felt a nervous tingle in his belly, as if he had hundreds of butterflies in there. No one else had gone to bed yet, so Draco was alone. He took out a little mirror and comb and checked his hair. He wanted to look good. It would be the first time that he could sincerely talk to the boy that had fascinated him for years.
“Wouldn’t be the first time that happened at Hogwarts.”
Shivering, he pulled the blanket up to his chin and thought about the time when his bed hadn’t been lonely, when he had never woken up because of the cold but stayed awake to watch the person next to him sleep. Or, when the person next to him wasn’t asleep, doing something even better.
“Sure. Goodnight Draco.”
At 11:45 he snuck out of the common room. Luckily, everybody was already asleep. It was shortly before the holidays and the teachers had just hit them with homework like they were running out of time. Every student was exhausted, including Draco, but he had a man’s heart to win instead of worrying about his scholastic success.
Harry took a step backwards and ripped his hand out of Draco's loose grip.
Why Harry had chosen the Transfigurations room, he didn’t know. Sure, there was enough room, but was it really wise to use McGonagall’s room?
This was a messed up, magical place with tons of hidden passages and secret rooms, so Draco decided to retrace his steps. He walked up and down the corridor a few more times, more or less repeating the same inner monologue as before.
“I asked you how you would prepare an Aegerum Potion.” Draco had never even heard of a thing like that.
“You’ve been here before?”
“No. I don’t believe that. I don’t believe that none of that was real. I knew you once, maybe I don’t know you anymore, but our fourth year was real. Nothing has ever felt more real than what we had.”
“You are supposed to pay attention, not daydream, five points from Slytherin.” It was obvious that Snape was livid. He hated subtracting points from his own house. The other students weren’t too chuffed, either.
“There must be something good in there”, Draco insisted as he opened the book’s directory. Something called Gillyweed caught his eye as a red circle was drawn around the word. He opened the book at the corresponding page.
Harry giggled “That’s almost what McGonagall said!”
In the fourth year, everything changed. No one did notice, not even Draco himself. He didn’t suddenly start liking Potter, no, the slimy little prick finding a way to manipulate the Goblet of Fire and become a fourth Champion only fuelled his contempt.
“C’mon,” Harry said shortly, “help me with her, I don’t think she can swim very well.”
These were the most beautiful words Draco had heard in his entire life. “I though you would never ask!” He replied cheerfully.
“Ah” Harry didn’t seem to want to talk about Scottish geography in great detail.
“Your fault if you ignore your lady. Now excuse me I have to go.”
while you're searching ponder this;
Harry’s lips gently found their way down to Draco’s neck. He let out a pleasurable moan. But Harry wasn’t satisfied with only kissing his upper body. The cheeky boy took a deep breath and dived down. Draco hadn’t expected things to go this far so he couldn’t help himself but to grab Harry’s head and scream in hot passion. It was the first time anyone had touched him like this. He finished before Harry had to come back up for air.
Draco took his quill and some red ink, he thought a proud Gryffindor would like red, and wrote a letter.
Suddenly, the world looked strange. It was as if a shiny membrane surrounded Draco, Harry, Dumbledore and Snape. The membrane separated the four from the Death Eaters and Greyback.
Draco could not concentrate on brewing his Pepperup Potion. Instead, he scribbled down a note for Harry.
Maybe there was a reason Harry was not interested in the girls, maybe he, like Draco, preferred the same sex.
“He thinks he’s so special, with his firebolt and his damn fourth year magic. I mean anyone hear can fly a damn broom, and Accio is not that special, I would have done that better, I would have deserved to be the Champion, at least I don’t need a mudblood to teach me stuff.” Draco stabbed a sausage with his fork.
“Malfoy! Do you have a date yet?” Harry’s words hurt, did he not understand that the only person Draco wanted to take to the dance was –
Harry was visibly annoyed. “Look I don’t know what in the name of Merlin’s dingleberries is wrong with you, but I am okay with not knowing, and frankly, I don’t care about you or your problems.”
And the worst was: Draco could not explain why. He had always wished the worst onto the dark-haired, skinny boy with the great story, and in return, Potter has never showed any kindness to Draco. However, now he felt some kind of strange concern for the boy who lived.
“Wh- I apologize, Professor, could you pleased repeat yourself?” he said, low-key fearing for his life.
“Yeah I’m sure you were very much alone dancing with Harry Potter.” Oh shit, here we go. Draco was fucked. He wanted to apologise, explain, tell her it was nothing, and be honest about his feelings at the same time. The words seemed to be stuck in his throat.
The way Draco sees Harry suddenly changes quite radically, and Draco calls a secret meeting with the boy he has always been obsessed with.
When Harry had finally managed to get back to the Gryffindor dorms and into his bed, he had only one thought on his mind: He would soon meet Draco again.
“No, please, whenever I open it, it starts screeching like crazy”
“Harry, look, I think I found it!” Draco stretched to reach the top shelf. Luckily, he was fairly tall and could reach it. “This must be it!”
“Promise?”
“Watch where you’re walking, Malfoy”, the boy said contemptuously and discreetly brushed his hand over Draco’s robe. The blonde boy was petrified. He felt a mixture of butterflies and hurt feelings because of Harry’s dismissive behaviour. Why would he suddenly be so rude? Did Draco do anything to offend him? He put his hands in his pockets and was about to go to class when he felt a crumpled piece of paper. Trying to not freak out he ran to Professor Snape’s classroom – he could not risk being late by reading the note now. Harry probably just wanted to tell him that they should no longer meet anyway.
When he came back up, Harry still had his eyes closed and breathed heavily. “Draco”, he moaned “That was amazing”
This little shit! He knew it! He knew he would have to battle a dragon and he was prepared for it, I bet my ass!
“It’s impossible. It’s impossible that you still like me, after everything that happened, after all I did. I wouldn’t deserve it”
“I assure you that Severus did the best he could. And now he needs to kill me. I promise you Harry, I have thought long and hard about this, and I’m not happy with this plan either, but it’s the best I could come up with, and given that I am extraordinarily clever, it must be a pretty good one.”
He tried his best to seem like the sarcastic, mean bully that the other Slytherins knew and loved. The hands of the antique clock seemed to move in slow motion. Draco could manipulate others like a king, he could make Crabbe admire him and make Goyle steal whatever he wanted from the kitchen and he could make them bully everyone who didn’t do what he wanted, but he couldn’t speed up time.
“It’s okay - not that I didn’t enjoy it”, he said jokingly and hoped that it would just come over as light-hearted banter between platonic friends. Harry blushed even more. Had Draco moved his hand a little closer to his neck, he would have felt his racing heartbeat.
Draco was sure he had just experienced the best moments of his life. He got to dance with Harry Potter, he got to hold Harry Potter! “Right, let’s talk about the lift now” he had to interrupt this train of thought, otherwise, he would have started drooling. “You will need to hold me very firmly underneath my arms, like this. And then you just need to pick me up.”
“It has to happen, Harry”, said Dumbledore in a defeated tone “Although I appreciate the gesture. Tell them, Severus. They can’t hear us”
Not really a whole chapter, more like a short, soft, little epilogue.
They searched for close to fifteen minutes, but nothing they found resembled the description.
The rest of Draco’s classes felt like a drag. He didn’t actually catch a word of whatever the Professors were talking about. When school was finally over for the day, and Draco really should be writing one of the two essays that were assigned the students, he quickly ran up to the seventh floor. Harry arrived seconds after him.
Draco’s ears rang with Harry’s scream of horror. Despite everything Dumbledore had told them, he had to restrain Harry from jumping at Snape’s throat, who quickly retreated down the tower, taking the Death Eaters and Greyback with him.
"Look Harry, I just..."
“No, I can’t. I can’t just break the rules because you asked nicely.”
“Are you tired yet, Draco-sweetie?” Blaise Zabini asked with a mocking smile. His fellow Slytherins seemed to think that it was an unbelievable witty comment, most of them burst into laughter. Draco chose to ignore them. He was not in the mood for a quarrel like that.
“I honestly didn’t know what to expect when you sent me that note, I was just curious. And I’m glad I was.” Was this still platonic? “Honestly, it’s nice to have some peaceful dates in between the mortal danger – and school dances.” He called it a DATE!
“It’s called “Loch” here.”
After he was done, he needed to return to the Slytherin Dungeon, otherwise his friends would wonder where he was.
“Aww, you’re so desperate, it’s adorable.” Nevertheless, Harry’s hand slowly moved to Draco’s stomach again. Barely making contact with Draco’s skin, it sunk down. But it didn’t go down the middle, where Draco needed Harry to touch him, it travelled to his inner thigh. The touch almost drove him insane.
He looked in the bathroom mirror. This face would need some work if he wanted to hook up- dance with Harry Potter. He didn’t have high hopes that Harry would not completely ignore him, like he usually did in public, but still, it wouldn’t hurt to try. With exception of his feelings. Those would, indeed, get hurt if he failed.
Shortly before midnight, they decided to settle down and relax on the couch to watch the giant hourglass count down the time until the year would end.
“It appears Draco has reconsidered his options and does not wish to kill me anymore” Dumbledore stated.
“Yes totally. I like how everything’s all… brown” How do normal people talk to people? Draco only ever talked to people he didn’t really care about, like Crabbe and Goyle, and all the other Slytherins.
“Okay, well if you don’t have one, I won’t wear mine either I guess”, Harry said and got rid of his last layer.
Draco was on the verge of tears. It seemed like Harry would not even give him the chance to explain his feelings. In his head, this moment had played out a lot easier.
“You’re lying! Accio cloak”, he shouted and flung his wand through the air and the Cloak of Invisibility flew towards him, revealing a paralyzed Harry.
When they finally parted, they were out of breath and in awe of their affection for each other.
“Hey, it’s okay” Draco smiled at him and pulled him on his feet. “Look, it’s almost Midnight! I’m so excited for the fireworks!”
The lights went out, it became quiet. The music started, the doors opened. The eight debutants entered. Everyone was clapping. Fleur was her beautiful, perfect self, as always. Draco noticed how she winked at Alicia Spinnet who responded by blowing her a kiss. Cedric and Cho seemed to enjoy themselves as well. What Draco didn’t expect was Victor Krum with Hermione Granger. Granger! And the world-famous Bulgarian Seeker Krum? He was definitely impressed. Then he saw Harry. He looked stunning in his dark-green robes. They stood out from his pale skin in a gorgeous way. Lord, how was this boy so sexy? He didn’t, however, seem comfortable at all. In fact, it looked like he had some trouble not passing out while Parvati Patil had the time of her life and waved at her sister Padma who didn’t seem that happy about going to the dance with Ron Weasley.
“I have no idea. Open it or something.”
Wait.
The thick, black hair, the pale skin, the cute glasses, the way his shirt was just never tucked into the trousers neatly and how his uniform was just always slightly wrinkled. And his hands! His beautiful hands, just casually playing with his quill. How did he never notice any of this in the previous years?
This was the fanciest, most decadent bathroom he had ever seen, and he had lived at a big mansion all his life. A giant chandelier, marble everywhere, A swimming pool wit way too many taps than would be useful and a diving board. Given that did Hogwarts not require students to pay tuition fees, Draco was confused about who paid for this excess, not to mention its maintenance. Probably the hard-working tax payers, it was always them.
No, it wasn't all just a dream, Draco just dreamt of the very real past. It's all good.
They stared at each other for a while. Harry blushed. “I would very much like to” he then rasped before clearing his throat.
“As you can see, the potion is of a pale yellow, but upon adding powdered ivory and squid ink, it turns red.” Snape demonstrated how to make a potion to instantly cure the common cold.
Draco has made his choice, now he just needs to convince Harry.
“Leave him alone”, snapped Draco impulsively.
“I reckon you have to turn on the tap.” Draco responded dryly.
Harry put his hands on Draco’s hips. “Okay, let’s try again” He picked Draco up, this time successfully. In his head, he had already congratulated himself, when he lost his balance and fell backwards, Draco landing on his body.
“I bet he will just go to the dance alone, or with Granger. He’s just that pathetic.”
“Don’t say that, Draco…” Harry said softly, brushing his hand over Draco’s cheek.
“Always”
“Right”. Harry gave him a quick peck on the cheek. “Thank you for your help, Draco. See you tomorrow”
“God, don’t remind me of that rotten egg.”
“Bye!” This whole “Harry hastily rushing out of the room”-thing was getting a bit annoying. Also, it was quite rude.
“Fuck you, she abandoned me!” Ron lashed out.
“I never considered it a necessity.” Draco’s face was read as a tomato.
When Draco arrived at Oak Tree Square, it was empty. Even though Hogsmeade was a small village, it still had its nice and not-so-nice parts. Oak Tree Square was definitely in the not-so-nice part. It was a bit of a walk from the town centre and surrounded by lowlife pubs and stores of which even Draco wasn’t sure what they were selling. No one would expect Hogwarts students here, so it was the perfect spot for a meeting that should not become school gossip. Hopefully, Harry wouldn’t immediately be turned off by the area.
“Great! That narrows it down. Why does Snape not have any labels on these jars?”
However, if there was a chance, any chance at all, no matter how small, that he would say yes, Draco had to try!
As he entered the room, it was still empty. He waited for a few minutes and grew more anxious with every second.
The thought of  not having to sit through a lengthy Christmas Dinner listening to his aunt’s arrogant ramblings and watching his mother go through two bottles of 300£ Sauvignon by herself and being pierced by his father’s judging, disapproving stares if he dared breathing too loudly cheered him up, especially since there was a chance of dancing with Harry while Lucius and Narcissa would get into their third argument, probably about the choice of music in the sitting room. The first one was usually about the choice of drink Narcissa wanted to serve for aperitif, the second one was about the last-second amendments Lucius wanted to make about the seating arrangement. He never wanted to sit next to the Lestranges while Narcissa insisted he should, by now, be comfortable around his in-laws. The fourth argument on Christmas Day, while the issue was random, usually ended in a few broken plates and Narcissa locking herself in the bathroom crying. Draco was sure he would not miss out on anything apart from emotional trauma.
He sighs, turning his head to catch Draco’s lips in his own. It’s slow at first, but he manages to build it back up.
There’s only one question left in this whole mess. Why did Draco’s friends get involved? Harry’s friends had only done this because they were sick of his denial and pining, and so why did Draco’s? The only possibility in Harry’s mind is that Draco likes him too, but that’s ridiculous. That can’t be the case, because then they would have wasted so much time dancing around each other for nothing, and Harry likes to think he’s more observant than that. He is an Auror, after all.
This is the final one for this little collection! I thought I’d end it on a good note rather than an angsty, painful one, so here you go!
“Good evening, Mrs Malfoy,” Harry says with a smile and a nod. “I’m glad to see that you’ve recovered nicely.”
“Because it’s
Draco sighs, turning back to his mother. “You’re lucky I’ve already
have a fairytale ending.
“There we go Harry. Perfect,” Draco says, murmuring into his ear. He speeds up, the sound of skin on slicked skin filling the room.
“Yes, I thought you might. It looks like we have a ton of research we need to get done, doesn’t it?” Harry pulls a face.
The man is asleep under him, fully clothed. Draco’s fully clothed too, and he tries to shrug himself out of his shirt. The need to
And the worst part about this whole thing? It’s working; Draco has fallen for Harry, and he can only hope Harry feels the same.
“Yep. Although, it’s quite a long route with many turns. It’d take ages for someone unfamiliar with the Manor to get there. And once there, they wouldn’t be able to do anything. That end of the Manor is essentially just bedrooms for my family. Not to mention the wards.” I shudder.
have to answer some I can’t.” His stern gaze turns to me before looking back at Madame Warren. “It’s for his friend,” he rushes to explain.
Harry nods again. “It’s no problem.” He then looks over at me and grins. “I should let you have some time with your son,” he suggests, still facing me but obviously addressing Mother. His hand pulls away from my back, and I force myself not to react at the loss of contact.
When no one responds yet again, he leaves the subject and starts pulling things out of his extended pockets. Thick, plastic gloves fall to the carpet, followed by a face mask and a pair of safety glasses. Draco hurries to put all of them on and then draws a circle around the cabinet with his wand. When a red line glares up from the ground, he ushers Robards and Potter away. They can not be in the circle if the spells are going to have any chance of working.
“Your eyes reflect it, you know,” Harry murmurs into his ear. “The silver is reflecting the light.”
Draco instantly opens it again and continues reading, quite happy to drown out his mind with words from a different brain. The scene continues with the two men being pulled apart, one with a split lip and one with a broken nose. Draco sighs, just wanting them to manage to get together. Curse the stars.
~~~~~~~~
I glance around the room, trying to piece things together. I see the curtain first. The heavy, white curtain in a semicircle around my bed. Within the sectioned off room, I see a couple of uncomfortable-looking chairs, a table, and a few magazines. The bed I’m in is quite comfortable, surprisingly. The blankets are lovely and warm, and the mattress is soft. The same can’t be said for the pillow. The outside of the bed however, is a hard, cold plastic that’s more suitable to a muggle invention. I think it’s called a ‘fridge’. Stupid muggles come up with the weirdest names.
“Granger?! You still talk to her?”
He’s sweating even in the water, but he knows he can’t let the fever get the best of him. It’s not the worst he’s had, not by far, and he should be able to shake it off. First though, he
“Nothing,” I reply. “Just that Gryffindors are known to not be the brightest.” I allow a smirk to cross my face.
“Why didn’t you tell me?”
Theo’s was another challenging one, with no obvious flower sharing the name. While researching though, Draco had actually found a few. There was one he liked, but it was fiery red; too masculine for Theo. He’s embracing his femininity right now after realising he was bisexual, so Draco had wanted something sweet and not overpowering. Something he could stare at and feel at home. He’d managed to find a type of azalea called Theo, and it is a lovely pink. Draco had thought it was much more suitable. The magic
Harry frowns, but turns to look out. There’s a village.
“Merlin that was expensive!” I exclaim.
“And he’s done it! Malfoy has caught the Snitch, winning the game for Slytherin at 210 to 90!” The audience is shocked into silence, before an uproar of cheering comes forth from the Slytherin supporters.
Draco nods, holding his hand and pulling him into the alley they just came out of, and into the Apparition point.
“Yeah! Apparently there are different types of risen angels, and they all have magic!”
for years.”
“You bloody kissed me!”
Harry’s thoughts flash to a conversation from years ago, where words very similar held a sneer instead of an astounding amount of sincerity.
“Miss.”
The students break out in chatter immediately. I can see them glancing around at everyone, trying to figure out who is playing. No one looks at me though. No one thinks I’ll be allowed to play after everything my family, and I, did in the war. It is sure to be a shock when I fly out onto the pitch.
*~*~*~
Harry nods. “Yeah, the stores have been mostly emptied by that point.”
Harry allows himself to grin again. “He is. His hair is often turquoise, but Andromeda doesn’t allow him to make his eyes purple.”
It comes apart quickly beneath his fingers, ripping with a satisfying sound. Harry seems to hold back a laugh at Draco’s uncivilised opening, but he doesn’t care. It would feel stilted if he did it neatly, as if honouring his father’s memory. That’s not something he wants to do, especially not with Harry.
He looks at me, waiting for my confirmation for him to continue. When I nod, he rises onto his knees and away from my torso. His hands find my belt and rush to unfasten it. When it is out of the way, he sets his smouldering gaze on mine, and stares at me as he undoes my button. His fingers find my fly, and starts to unzip my jeans. His mouth latches onto my earlobe and nips at it, pulling it away from my face. Once they are undone, he moves his kisses to my neck, and starts sucking at the soft skin he finds. At the same time, he lets his hands pull my pants down around my thighs. This leaves my underwear for him to discard, and then my naked skin. I feel my body quiver in anticipation, seeing stars under Potter’s hands and mouth. I melt into his touch, but still manage to open my eyes when his hand runs along the elastic of my underwear. He lowers his hand and finds my bulging cock waiting for him. He palms it gently, moaning himself. He moves down me and slowly licks the cotton around my erection. I release an animalistic hiss and Potter looks up at me, delighted. While his mouth is busy, his hand are not, and they go to pull down my briefs. He slides them off my hips, and his mouth leaves a trail of kisses down my thighs. His hungry eyes tick to my cock, and they light up. He kisses his way back up to my crotch and breathes my scent in. His hands are now on either side of my sensitive skin, and I’m making quiet, mewling sounds. But as soon as his hand grabs around my throbbing erection, the scene wilts. It burns away until I’m left alone, in a silent, cold, stone room. Water is dripping in puddles on the floor. My hands twist in something I can’t see, and a scream is ripped from my throat.
You would expect that to be an easy task, really. Considering Harry had
Harry sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose. “I’m looking for any evidence of wards or enchantments that are preventing us from leaving.” He makes sure to keep his voice professional and light, even though he knows Malfoy won’t buy it for even a second.
People were looking confusedly around at the teams. I sneer, thinking how marvellous it was not to be interrupted while training. Since the Quidditch Pitch is totally trashed and burnt, the school decided to clear some land behind the school and make a temporary pitch. That’s where we will be playing today.
so why he learned it is beyond him. Draco picks up his book from the arm of the sofa, careful not to disturb Potter, and walks towards the bedroom. He quickly brushes his teeth and goes through his night routine—which isn’t quite as long as the morning one, but is still too long if he’s being honest—and makes his way to the bed, intending to read well into the night.
Harry had been absolutely fine with Draco’s preference for men, questioning his own sexuality as well. He hadn’t said anything about it at the time, wanting to be positive before telling other people. He’d eventually told Draco in their 20s, who hadn’t been even slightly surprised by that point. They’d laughed about it and gone on with their normal lives.
Potter’s expression falters, his posture tightening. He closes up from me, crossing his arms in front of his chest. For a second, I don’t think he’s going to answer me.
Draco moans loudly, moving his hand to rest in Potter’s hair. It tickles slightly, but it surprisingly feels amazing. Almost intimate. Which isn’t something he wants from a hook up, but decides he’ll let it slide, considering who’s doing it. He feels his cock harden impossibly more, and his skin starts growing warm. Too warm. Potter is still moving his head along the scars, and Draco has to pull on his hair to get his attention.
“Thank you,” Harry replies, smile lighting up his face. “That’s so thoughtful.”
The smell of bacon stirs Draco’s interest, and his stomach rumbles as he remembers that he hasn’t eaten all day. He casts a
“Malfoy…” he starts. Here we go.
*~*~*~
Draco is reminded of Severus, and is left for a second thinking back to his godfather. He shakes himself and manages to roll his eyes at Potter.
Draco gets a spoon from the cutlery drawer and carries his breakfast to the dining table. It feels cramped and small without Harry’s presence, even though another person should make it feel tiny. It’s a sad spot for a table, pushed to the side wall with only two chairs. He sighs, but takes a seat. He wishes Harry were with him. Draco swallows hard, pushing the thought away. He’s literally down the hall, and will be back in no time.
A hiss startles me out of my mind and I glance around to my left. Potter has his shockingly green eyes on me, and smirks.
“Can I?” He asks, making sure Draco is still comfortable.
a hug.
“Yep. Left hours ago, decided to meet with ‘Mione and Ron in their hideout.”
“Not very often. They prefer to keep their work and personal lives separate.”
“I’m really sorry, Harry.”
*~*~*~
,” Harry whines, his hands reaching up to hold onto his shoulders. His fingers rub circles into his skin, comforting. “Christmas is in a couple of days, and since I’ve been trapped
Malfoy lights up, silver eyes wide and excited. “They’re all gay books!” He whispers, as if scared to let anyone else know lest they take them from him.
He finally stands up, and the cold air that he walks through sets goosebumps rising. These ones are real though, created by an actual chill and not a curse. A smile pulls at his lips; maybe this won’t end so badly. Maybe they’ll be able to overcome the curse, and manage to get back to London. He hopes they can.
sound like that,” Draco says, willing himself not to snap.
in the cottage. At least, that’s his thought on the matter. While outside, he might as well as explore the forest some more. Harry looks up from his hiking shoes as he crosses into the forest, suppressing a shiver that has nothing to do with the cold.
Robards rubs the back of his neck and gestures for Potter to pull the sheet off.
“I don’t know,” he replies grimly.
“Let’s deal with this tomorrow yeah?” He suggests, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist and resting his head on his shoulder. “I want to relax a bit.”
“How did they find Grimmauld?” I say at a normal volume to Harry. Nobody is able to hear over the cacophony of voices anyway.
“Yes.” A shiver runs through me at the way he is speaking. Hopeful. Optimistic, even. “How?”
“Boys, really?” Robards’ voice fills the room again. Draco had forgotten he was even there. “Can you not go ten minutes without sniping at each other?”
My mouth drops open. “Doing what?”
“I’m worried about missing something too.” Malfoy’s soft voice is loud in the quiet of the night.
“Goodnight, Harry.” I echo the sentiment before turning into my room and closing the door.
Unaware of the grin that’s crept onto my face, I nod subtlety to him. His face lights up and he goes back to work writing out the beginnings of our essay.
Have a lovely and safe week Xx
Harry looks slightly puzzled for a second, before doing what’s expected of him. “Good morning Mrs Malfoy.”
They stand like that for a while, bodies close and hearts beating in time. Harry counts his breaths, squeezes Malfoy occasionally, and tries his best to be a silent comfort. Malfoy eventually calms down, his shaking slowing, and his breathing evening out. He doesn’t make to move away, and Harry is somewhat pleased by this. It speaks volumes of how far they’ve come over the years; over these past two weeks.
. He doesn’t know how Harry does it.
“It was Robards.”
“Yours tonight. It’s closer than my flat.”
Draco creeps back into the living room after his shower, dressed in new clothes with his hair styled differently. He couldn’t bear to look at himself in the mirror, so he needed to change something. Instead of a black button up shirt, he’s wearing a loose pink t-shirt and ripped black jeans. His hair is parted to the side, sweeping over his forehead. It’s different, and he thinks he looks pretty good like this. Even better, it distracts him from what he’s done.
“Harry took me to a bookshop a few weeks ago, I believe it was the twelfth. Anyway, it was massive, with an even bigger collection of books. There was an entire section on Magical Creatures, and Harry managed to find a couple on Fallen Angels.”
Malfoy grins. “The man from the bookstore, the girl who said our cottage was non-existent, and that bloody stupid plant!”
Harry shakes his head on a soft laugh. “Of course they are,” he says, smiling. “Come on, pick a couple, and then we need to go.”
He’s immediately reminded of why he left. The living area is totally deserted, but there are dishes to do and things to clean up. Malfoy has clearly had a good time by himself this afternoon. Harry isn’t happy about it, but he tidies up and then prepares for bed. Bed, of course being the couch in the living room. At least it’s comfortable-ish. Out of all the couches in the world to be stuck on, this isn’t the worst. Still, he would much prefer to be sleeping on his bed. His bed at Grimmauld has heating charms to keep him warm throughout the long winter nights. He would do basically anything to get back to it, but for now he’s on the couch with Malfoy down the hall.
Potter pauses but nods after a second. “It’s too late to go back to sleep, so maybe I could go out and investigate where you fell in?”
Harry sighs pointedly, he wasn't even that loud and it took less than ten minutes.
carrying people are ‘cars’. My head swims, trying to make sense of what I’m seeing. Inside the cars, there is at least one muggle holding onto a circle with shapes cut out of it. This circle seems to control which way the car moves. Before I can figure anything else out, we are on the other side of the road.
“All you need to do is breathe,” he whispers. Malfoy shudders against him, body shaking slightly. “You’re okay, you’re safe, and I’m here.”
“You should try it.”
Draco huffs at how easily he was pushed away. Although, it means he can watch Harry’s arse as he moves to the other side of the room, and he’s not upset about that. Harry bends down to rummage through one of the bags, wiggling his arse in Draco’s direction. He feels his mouth go dry as he watches, his cock twitching in interest. Not today though, not on Christmas when they have so much they need to do. He can wait.
~~~~~~~~
Harry grunts. “Right. And you woke me because…?”
Harry doesn’t think it’s closer at all, but he isn’t going to argue. He turns around to look at Draco, wraps his arms around his waist, and tries to Apparate them to 12 Grimmauld Place.
“£299, sir.”
Harry nods, stepping away but keeping his hands on Draco’s shoulders. “I know. I meant with
He strips his jacket and shirt off, throwing them to the ground in an effort to drop his body heat. His muscles are going to kill him for that run tomorrow. Draco tips his head back under the jet of water, taking a drink at the same time. He turns the tap off and flicks his hair back, spelling it dry so it doesn’t drip all over the floor. Knowing his luck, he’d probably slip in that very water and knock himself out or something, not to mention the damage Harry could do.
He wants to kiss him. He wants to turn back around and cover Harry’s gorgeous lips with his own. Draco can imagine Harry’s pulse speeding up, fluttering in his neck. Can picture the way Harry’s hands would slide into his hair and pull him closer.
that you like me. Right before we left for the Manor, actually.”
“I am in the vent. Awaiting directions.” There is a pause before Harry adds, “Preferably in sketch format.”
*~*~*~
Draco smiles, pleased Harry is playing along. “Very similar to yesterday, but after our revelation it needs to be. Since we now
’ing his own present towards him. The small parcel flies into his outstretched hands, elegantly wrapped in deep purple paper. He’d thought the colour was ironic, and therefore an opportunity unable to be missed.
Draco breathes heavily and draws his knees in, exposing his hole to Harry. He drinks in the sight, eyes roving across the skin. He needs to taste it, needs to get his tongue as far inside as possible. Harry moves onto his elbows and edges closer, hands resting on the backs of Draco’s thighs. His hands are dark against the white skin, and he feels a jolt of arousal at the contrast.
and get checked over.” He pushes Harry in the direction of the door. “And watch where you’re going!” He calls as he illuminates the safe tiles wordlessly.
. Harry’s stomach flutters with something suspiciously like joy, and he tries to stamp it down as he passes Malfoy a plate. Malfoy’s eyes fall to the offered treat, and he sniffs again.
That’s clearly a Muggle saying, as Hermione nods along and physically places her middle finger over her index.
Draco’s eyes widen slightly and he tips his head to the side. “Then what are you doing here? Surely, this is the wrong one once again.”
on it, and wait for Harry to run back like a puppy.
The shops are just as battered and unloved as usual, and nothing appears to be any different than the last time Harry was here. If Malfoy
“I’ll come with,” Potter agrees instantly.
Draco sighs. “I hate you, Potter!”
Draco scowls. It must have fallen out of his pocket while he was asleep. Not that he tells Potter that. No, he’ll just let the other man puzzle it out himself.
“Good evening, Draco,” Andromeda says, lifting her hand for him to shake.
Harry doesn’t know why he’s surprised about how quickly Draco figured it out, but he is. He feels his lips draw into a frown and his flush deepen. He doesn’t deny it.
He pulls back though, looking into Draco’s lust blown eyes. “Are you sure? We can do it the other way too if you want.”
His fingers twitch, like the only thing they want to do is
it’s left over from. It’s just a long-standing habit that being an Auror hasn’t helped remove. Surely enough, when Harry slides an arm down his body and deep into his pocket, his hand wraps around the length of wood. He pulls it out and drops it lazily on his chest.
A second group would have been in charge of duplicating the courtyard. If the magic core analysis they carried out reveals anything, it’s that weak magic was used over a period of time, and then strong magic all of a sudden covered it. The only people Harry thinks could have pulled it off are Ron, Dean, and Nott. Ron and Dean are very strong anyway, Ron bulking up for the Aurors and Dean just enjoying working out. He doesn’t know about Nott, but according to Draco he’s been reading a lot and looking into different types of magic. It would make sense, since, if Harry remembers correctly, Nott made it into NEWT level Potions; he must be quite strong magically speaking.
Harry nods. “My parents had something like this, although I doubt it was a reindeer.” He hums for a while, thinking. “Probably an angel or something.”
Draco sighs but nods. Sam grins and barks out a laugh.
“But not to the way he feels about you.”
“Haha,” she says, face humourless. “The one where in half a month they want to scream bloody murder in the Unspeakables’ Department.”
“Are you going to sit?” Malfoy asks, looking up at him. Harry blinks and realises he’s still standing there. He fights back a blush and hurriedly sits at the table. Feeling his skin warm anyway, he takes a sip of his wine. He has no idea if it works with their dinner, but it will make him less nervous, which has to be a good thing.
Cheers erupt from the circle of girls, and Harry turns to find Pansy and Lavender snogging. He watches as Pansy gets her hands in Lavender’s hair and
“Because this whole thing was planned?” Draco suggests. “I don’t know. There must be a way to fix it though, to bring the magic back. There’d be no point otherwise.”
Draco opens his eyes. It’s still dark, and when he turns to look out the window he finds the sky pitch black. What bloody time is it?! He slides his arms down the back of the sofa and searches around for his wand, finding it on the coffee table he’d Transfigured two days ago. Casting a Tempus and scowling when it returns as five am, Draco flops himself back down onto the sofa. There’s no sense in getting up so early, so he isn’t going to. As he pulls the blanket up over his shoulders again, he halts. Where did the blanket come from? He definitely hadn’t had it last night… He’d clearly fallen asleep on the sofa, but he couldn’t remember ever actually getting ready for bed. Normally he would have gone through an entire night routine, but he has no recollection of that from the previous night.
Draco raises an eyebrow, unsure if Harry is asking what Draco thinks he is.
“Ok,” I take a deep breath. “I have been spending a lot of time-”
“You can’t.”
“What’s wrong Potter?” Malfoy asks, popping the ‘p’ in an imitation of the way he used to say it. Now though, after the antagonism of their rivalry has faded to banter and bickering, Malfoy says it more gently. It always makes something in Harry’s brain melt. “Afraid I’ll be too good?” He lifts a single eyebrow, thin lips curving into a smirk.
Harry pauses, not expecting the sudden shift in conversation. “Honestly, I’m not sure. Normally I’d spend the day with Teddy, and then go to the Burrow for a family dinner. We might not be out of here on time this year though…”
“You’re telling me,” he seethes, “that that was deliberate! Planned?!”
I lift my wand and float my equipment away.
Potter shrugs. Chews on his lower lip. “Maybe it’s slowly forcing us to be near each other?” He seems to think that over more and shakes his head. “No. It’s probably just making us less uncomfortable with each other.”
“You can keep it,” I sneer, “its revolting.”
The walk down the path is challenging to say the least, with snow having fallen all night. The ground is squishy and wet, and their footsteps sink deep into it. Malfoy makes a disgusted sound as his boot is swallowed by the icy mush, and he tugs it back up. Harry nods his head towards a different part of the forest than the part they usually enter, and Malfoy grunts in reply. They start running at the same time, laboured steps that squelch in the snow, but they make it under the cover of the trees where there’s less of it. Malfoy of course, gets there a split second before Harry, and starts chanting about how he won.
“Let’s give them some room,” Hermione says, more of a command than a suggestion. Harry is suddenly
So sorry this is a couple of days late! I had a rather shit and busy week. The next chapter is the last, so get ready for an ending! Xx
Draco huffs.
Harry just laughs, shaking his head at himself and refusing to elaborate. Draco fights a blush the entire way back to the cottage.
Malfoy is sitting up still, finishing the bowl of soup. He only looks up when instead of awkwardly perching himself on the coffee table, Harry sits next to him on the couch. Concern flickers across Malfoy’s eyes, but when Harry holds up the first aid kit Malfoy seems to understand and relaxes. Harry pulls his wand out of his sleeve again and siphons the dirt off Malfoy’s skin with a
“Potter, I was born ready to race you.”
want to think about this. Doesn’t want to do what his body so desperately is telling him to. He hasn’t had the chance to…
Draco rushes to help, shrugging the navy fabric off his shoulders. He then leans forward and kisses Harry greedily, feeling the maroon wool of Harry’s sweater against his flushed skin. It tickles slightly, and Draco has to bite back a slightly insane laugh. He pulls away and basically rips Harry’s sweater over his head, throwing it somewhere on the floor. He latches his mouth back onto Harry’s, and Harry returns the snog just as enthusiastically. Harry leans back, and Draco can
Draco nods slowly. “You know, now that you’ve put it so plainly, I know how to get us out of here.”
He makes no movement to give him away to the others, and I’m forced to keep quiet. He moves his hand up higher, and my breath catches. Thankfully, Goldstein was arguing with Harry about something or another, and no one heard. I find his hand with my own, and I try to pry his fingers off of me. He just grips harder.
“You don’t want me, Harry. There’s no way you do, you deserve better.” Draco’s voice is broken, like he truly believes what he’s saying. Harry knows he doesn’t, knows it’s brought on by nightmares and flashbacks, but it hurts just the same.
“Guess so…”
Potter sighs heavily, his breath a loud huff in the near-silent cottage. Then, incredulously, he inches closer. At first, Draco thinks he imagined it. But then it happens again. Draco watches him, and Potter looks directly into his eyes, searching for something. Whatever he was looking for, he seems to find it. Without another word, he shuffles much closer, his body barely a few inches away.  Draco swallows, runs a hand through his mussed hair. Gathering his limited courage, he lifts his hips and moves down the sofa. He presses their thighs firmly together, and nearly groans at the warmth he finds there.
“That wasn’t what I wanted to ask you about,” Granger says slowly. “I didn’t think Ron and I were on the same page…”
Narcissa smiles at Draco, and she swishes her wand again. The jelly beans sort themselves by flavour, and then float back into the box to be eaten later. She points her wand at the dragon figurine, and it drifts slowly into her hand. She sets it down on the table, and when it falls onto its side it’s left there. Draco swallows hard, trying not to read too much into it.
The wand sits perfectly still on the wooden floor, and Draco doesn’t know how to react. On one hand, it’s great that he hasn’t accidentally killed himself. On the other though…
“See, that wasn’t so hard was it?”
does. He smells amazing, something Harry could get lost in. Harry hums, licking around the head before taking it into his mouth. He groans as it hits his tongue and he puts on a show for Draco, hollowing his cheeks. Draco’s hips twitch, and Harry holds him in place roughly.
“Oh. I thought that would be all, given your blood and where your loyalties lie.”
“Thank you,” he says as the cashier places them into a bag. Malfoy drops his hands from Harry’s, choosing instead to clasp them tightly around the bag presented to him. Harry nods to the man and opens the door for Malfoy to walk through, determinedly not thinking about whatever the cashier thought he saw between him and Malfoy.
The bathroom is just as welcoming as this morning, and Draco turns on the hot water without a second thought. As it warms up, he strips out of his clothes. He shivers, goosebumps immediately rising on his skin. Hopeful, he checks the temperature. His hand freezes and he pulls it out. He tucks it in his armpit to keep it warm. Waiting for the water to heat up is the worst part of baths, especially in winter. When he checks it a second time, he’s delighted to find it warm. He plugs the drain and steps in. When it’s about half full, he uncaps one of the bottles on the edge and smells it. The bubble mixture is scented, and reminds him of Honeydukes. Smiling, Draco tips in a good portion. He watches as bubbles begin to float on top of the water. While baths may be rare in his normal schedule, bubbles are a luxury he indulges in even less often. Sighing contentedly, he turns the water off and flicks his wand to regulate the temperature.
I laugh silently.
He turns to me, his hand slipping from mine and grabbing my shoulder to make me face him. All for the people who may or may not be watching. Keeping up appearances. “It has books you won’t, you
“I need to get out of here,” Harry says desperately.
Draco’s eyes widen and he races to join Potter, his hands forgotten about. His eyes instantly find it; a small rectangle cut into the back at about knee level. Draco’s heart thuds as he thinks about what this means.
I must stop doing that; passing out. I’m lying on a bed, my stomach pressed heavily into the duvet. There are a couple of things that instantly strike me as unusual. One being that I
Harry watches as Draco stands, blankets tight around his chest like a cape or robe, and walks over to the kitchen. He immediately clicks the kettle on and starts gathering things for coffee. Harry wants to laugh at how predictable Draco is, but then he pulls out a second mug alongside his, and Harry is shocked into silence. Sure, they eat together all the time now, but Draco’s never done something like this so casually. Harry feels a smile edging onto his face.
“You’ve bought everything else so far, let me buy this.”
Draco gasps at the feeling of being breached, of having Harry’s finger invade his body. Harry can tell his body is fighting it, and he murmurs to Draco to relax. Draco looks at him like he’s mad, so Harry’s other hand starts slowly stroking his cock again. Draco’s head falls back once more, and Harry pushes in slightly further.
charm. It’s quarter past two. Potter’s been gone just over an hour, so he should be back any minute now. Content, I settle down into reading ‘How the Mind Works’ by Steven Pinker.
Potter moves closer, peering over Draco’s shoulder as if expecting to see something. “It looks fine?”
“Oh,” Malfoy says, taking another bite. “But I bought everything today.”
“It’s just a fever Potter, I’ll be fine.” Draco really doesn’t like the fuss.
“Okay. What do we start with?” He asks, gesturing around to the water fountain and Cabinet.
“Not everyone,” Draco replies. “They don’t look too pleased.” He gestures towards a cluster of people scowling. Harry squints, and sees money leaving their hands!
. He shakes his head. It’s too early for cake! Even if it looks delicious.
on Christmas Eve.”
“What on earth do you mean by that?!” I scream before remembering once again that Harry can’t hear me. But Hermione can.
Draco gasps in surprise, Potter’s hand encircling his throat but not digging into his windpipe. The balance is… not entirely uncomfortable. He heaves in a breath, and then targets the joint connecting Potter’s thumb to his hand and presses down. Potter’s hand gives way and Draco pushes him back before scrambling over to him. He straddles Potter’s thighs and pins him to the sofa, trapping his wrists and locking his ankles over Potter’s own.
“Hmm? Oh, well I didn’t get a name exactly…” he trails off.
“What?!” I ask. “Aren’t you angry? I’m gay, Mother!”
Draco sighs and shrugs Harry off him. “I need to know where I stand.”
was the one to call you in.”
Draco smiles at the thought of Harry being an idiot, before catching himself. It’s stupid to think like this when nothing will ever happen. Sure, maybe Harry leaned in to him a bit today. Yeah, they did wake up together on the sofa, wrapped around each other. And okay, maybe they are getting quite close and talking about topics previously considered dangerous. But none of those things are dead giveaways, none are obvious signs. Draco can’t afford to project his feelings onto Harry, and then feel mistakenly confident those feelings are returned. Chances are, they aren’t.
“Goodnight, Draco.”
He brushes past Harry, arms touching, and walks back to the kitchen.
“No,” Malfoy sighs. “You’re right. It’s never what I want, but what can I do? It’s my choice to go to bad clubs and try to take someone home. Of course I attract the wrong attention sometimes.”
“No buts.” Harry sighs deeply, arms wrapping tighter around his waist. “What you did was a momentary lapse of judgement. You didn’t know what was happening.”
*~*~*~
fell asleep on
Draco sharpens his eyes as much as he can after just waking up, turning his gaze into a glare. Harry quickly morphs his own expression to match, and Draco huffs a breath. It pains him to do this, all he wants is to throw Harry’s arm around his waist and go back to sleep. But he can’t. He can’t, and he needs to be firm with himself. Taking a deep breath, Draco extends his leg and kicks Harry’s shin. It’s not a painful kick, more of a strong shove.
Harry waves a dismissive hand and grabs his navy blue coat off the back of a chair. “Come on, let’s go.”
Harry smiles at me, for less than half a second, before throwing the cloak back over his head. I feel him moving away instantly, inching closer to the door. Creeping along after him, I stop behind where I know him to be. I strain my ears for any sound of movement, but hear nothing. The charms he cast are staying strong. I watch intently as the door very slowly drifts open, as if by a wind. Except there is no wind, Harry is the one pushing it silently. The door stops it’s motion for a while, waiting so as not to draw attention. And then it’s opening again, and I can suddenly see further into the room than the opposite wall. My pulse is thumping in my ears, becoming all I can hear and think about. A rush of air tells me that Harry has moved forward slightly, so I stop thinking entirely in order to enter after him.
“You used to collect these as a child,” his mother says, sorting through the cards. “You had the entire set, if I remember correctly.”
“Well no. But you managed to when you rescued Draco, so it should be no different,” Hermione reasons.
Draco is grinning when Harry looks at him again. He moves onto his knees and shuffles into the centre of the circle. “Scared, Potter?”
“Please don’t make promises Harry. Promises never work out.” Now a tear really does fall, trickling down my left cheek.
“Hey, Potter?”
“I- I don’t remember. But there definitely was something at the time!” Fuck Potter. Draco can’t just out and say that he didn’t want to talk due to images of last night that were racing through his mind, can he? Not that they aren’t still now, but it’s different now. He can’t leave.
“What do you want to do today?” Harry repeats.
Draco groans, his back arching into Harry’s mouth. He curses as Harry nibbles him, his teeth harsh yet gentle. Harry licks over it, tongue dipping into the indents he just made. He pulls it into his mouth, his tongue swirling over it. Draco rolls his hips again, clearly desperate for some greater relief.
On days like this one, he truly doesn’t know how Draco survived, let alone how he became a decent, respectable man. Draco doesn’t like talking about it, but Harry can tell by the dimming of his eyes that he is also aware of how brutal his childhood--and adolescence--was.
“You were talking to Madame Warren for a while,” I point out to Potter as we arrive back at his house.
? He doesn’t particularly want to tell Malfoy about his train of thought.
. That’s why you’re already panting and pink?”
“Good morning,” he murmurs, pressing a kiss to the side of Draco’s head.
“They’ve moved…” I whisper.
I gasp. “He was right!”
“What do you want to do today?” Harry asks, approaching the kitchen slowly.
“Who said it was against my will Potter?” Malfoy quips.
Turning the water off and wrapping a towel firmly around his waist, Draco walks into his bedroom. The clothes he summoned into the bathroom come flying behind him back into his bedroom, folding themselves neatly in front of him on his bed. His memory clearly isn’t working well, if his clothes know what to do better than he does. But he can’t help being brain dead, especially when confronted with the rumpled mess that is his bed. The sheets are twisted and pulled out at odd angles, sweat and cum mingling on the white fabric. Potter’s cleaning mustn’t have been as thorough as it had appeared last night. Or was it this morning? Draco shakes his head, trying desperately to clear it from thoughts of Potter. He changes quickly into a pressed, black dress shirt and his favourite pair of light grey trousers. Touching his wand to his hair, he dries and styles it in silence. He then finds a hangover potion and takes it like a shot, letting the liquid slide down his throat and immediately remove his headache and dim the nausea. After inspecting himself in the mirror and casting a Glamour over the bites on his neck — he still doesn’t want to heal them for some reason — he Floos into the Ministry.
Biting back a retort of ‘of course you see now, he just made them visible!’ I turn back around to face Potter.
; then again, maybe she’s just not looking for a relationship right now—and Blaise is just as single as he ever has been, so they end up spending quite a bit of time together. With everyone else around the table in long-term relationships, Harry would think they’d feel a bit left out. With the rate they talk to each other though, Harry doesn’t think that’s the case.
“So they’re going ahead with it then,” I say. “This is the plan they were trying to involve me in before I left.” Hermione nods at my little bit of context and jots it down.
Biting back a laugh but not quite managing to stop a small huff, Draco glances back down at the crack. He crouches down, tracing his finger along the hair-width fracture in the pavement. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Harry moving closer to the fountain. He bends at the knees into a squat and looks at something, and Draco stands. Draco makes his way over to Harry, and spots the crack he’d noticed days ago running down the side.
“I guess not… But, my reputation is being bad at Potions, and I don’t want to ruin that.” That’s not a good reputation. I push the thought to the back of my mind, knowing how important it feels to be someone.
It’s been an insufferable fifteen minutes of silence, and I feel like I’m drowning in the quiet.
Apparently he is off in the world somewhere, trying to locate and destroy Horcruxes. I applaud him for trying, but there is no way he’ll survive that. Voldemort told me himself how difficult they are to find, and that to actually get a hold of them is practically impossible. I’ve tried to imagine where they would be,
My only response is a nod. He lifts me up into his arms and carries me like a child. I want to scream my protest. But I’m too tired. He turns around and strides towards the door. And for the first time in weeks, I see Mother. Her pale skin has turned sallow and sickly. Her hair is greasy and greying. Her once lively eyes are downcast, sad, and scared.
