It seemed that everyone and their auntie had a different theory on where Draco Malfoy went. The most popular theory was, in fact, that he had been pulled from Hogwarts and shipped off to Silovikizba, though the reasoning was still murky. (The whole Durmstrang theory was debunked rather quickly after a few owls were sent to a Romanian cousin that confirmed Draco was not there.)
Though it was only a few agonizing moments, it felt like hours to Draco. When the change was finally complete, he was already so tired. So tired,
could tell that much for themselves. Blaise was probably just frightened by the thought of ‘being chained down’ and not having the option to fuck off wherever and with whoever he wanted. Draco just hoped those two Gryffindors wouldn't give up and stop waiting for him. They all deserved to be happy, and to be happy together. Even if they were incredibly annoying.
About a year and a half ago, Draco and I finally finished a long and very high profile case. We’d worked dozens of hard hours to put it to bed, and were exhausted when we solved it. So I invited him to mine, to celebrate with dinner.
Do you want me, Draco? The teasing in your last letter sounded like you did, but you know how much I love it when you go on long rants and your voice gets all smooth and velvety. Would you talk me through it? Boss me about the bedroom and tell me what to do? I can almost hear it:
"Yes, ma'am, thank you," he said, standing back up and smiling at her. "I can't wait to get started."
“Trust me, I’ve no need for spoiling. This truly is a break. I’m not hunting malicious wizards at the moment, nor am I pushing papers and writing reports.”
“Don’t think of Euthymia less for serving me, Potter. Like you, I only want the best magical ink, so here I am.” Euthymia patted Draco’s non-inked shoulder fondly, and watched from the corner of her eye as Harry’s dark skin flushed. “Have a seat, Potter, don't just stand there ogling me.”
“I suppose I’d have to think about it. When Draco makes a decision, we’ll have a more serious conversation about it. But I’d like to be around him quite often, and if I’m at Hogwarts and he isn’t… I probably wouldn’t see him as often as I’d like.”
“Oh, Harry dear…” Molly leaned forward and ran her fingers through his hair. “It’ll all turn around, don’t you worry, dear.” He gave her a little smile. Gods, he hoped so.
He had known that Draco had been tasked with his death, and failure to kill him would result in his own torture and death… But surely this was not Riddle's work. He would've known if Death Eaters had broken through the castle wards… Which brought about the more concerning question: Who killed Draco Malfoy?
Doing as asked, Harry stared at him as Draco did turn now, throwing him a look over his shoulder. “Don’t come after me again.” With that said, he shimmered before the large dragon form was back, and he was taking off, up into the sky fairly clumsily before he flew off entirely.
"I did, if you'd be willing. I found a pensieve, as well." Well, that was convenient. He supposed that would be best, though, he didn’t know any other ways.
“I’m Gabriel Le Blanc, and when I bonded with Devin, I changed it to Gabriel Torneau. And when Alistair and Storm married, he went from Alistair Roots to Alistair Frey. It’s more common than you think, Draco.” A husband taking his wife’s name? And they considered that sort of thing to be
"Ah, but we have heard of you!" October said, brown eyes wide, but not in fear. A grin spread across his face. "Draco— dragon in the stars. Yes, you are an Auror! Your story, it is so captivating."
"It is. When you have intense focus on a spell or action, is it stronger? Does simple magic seem to come… easily to you, now?"
“Just— you don’t have to, I’ll tell her.” What could he tell her? That her son was injured, bitten by a werewolf, and now missing? She’d hex him where he stood. He was partially to blame for this whole thing, wasn’t he? “Fuck… he just disappeared? He was fixed up to be able Apparate?”
“Oh, didn’t grandma mention? I can’t do that.” She leaned forward a bit and smiled when she saw the train coming. “Perfect timing, as usual.”
“Oh- No, no, we’re not on holiday together. He went, and I thought that maybe a break away from work was a good idea-”
Harry couldn't help but frown. It seemed all the Malfoys liked to tease or insult him, though the latter was mainly Lucius. "What do you-- we were kissing on the sofa at Grimmauld a year ago and
Draco, do you want to have other children, besides Teddy? I know he’s wonderful and sweet and he’s already practically ours, but do you also want babies with me? You know I’ve always wanted a big family, but I would never pressure you into having (more?) children with me. I think Luna would be particularly keen to carry for us, if you do want them, however. She adores you, and quite honestly you could be brother and sister, by how much you look alike. Maybe cousins. My point is, think it over and get back to me. This isn’t something we need to rush and decide on now.
At that precise moment, Harry Potter moved the curtain aside and grinned when he saw Draco. “Oh, you're here, that's cool--”
Harry couldn't help but chuckle. Draco being unable to bitch about the incompetence of various coworkers or even the criminals themselves. He'd miss that gorgeous velvety voice too much. Bad suggestion. Harry smiled at Porthos. "I'm gonna hold off on the reply for a bit, alright? Rest up, eat some food." For now, he had more important things to- Like answering the Floo.
"No, trying to help him all I can. He's a good friend and he's saved my life a number of times, he's the best partner I could've asked for. Even if I hadn't fallen in love with him, I'd still be trying to do right by him now."
**A (smaller than Hogwarts) Russian school of magic that I had fun making up.  :) With ‘silovik’ meaning ‘elite’ and ‘izba’ meaning ‘log cabin’ in Russian, I like to think of it as a badass tight-knit school in eternal winter for badass witches and wizards. Think Illya Kuryakin, but with wandless magic.
“Mmm, yes, Draco mentioned you lived with your aunt and uncle.” Her tone had changed, back to the hard and cold way he’d heard her talk when they’d first met several years ago. “What was Dumbledore's excuse for putting you with them, again?”
It’s not just to keep myself busy. It’s for the independence it gives. And, yes, making up for my past sins. What I did in the war is unforgivable, but doing the work we do can at least help me start to make up for it all. And also… I don’t want to just depend on house elves, and mother, and the family vault, all the time. I’ve got to learn to lean on myself.
He shifted nervously from foot to foot, hands in his pockets. “...I choked on the Mandrake leaf and swallowed it… I might need another one.”
How could Draco be happy with chicken wraps from the Ministry café when he had food like this at home.
wine from 2002, they're just getting ready to release the first bottles. Come, meet more cousins." Draco nodded, unable to refuse as more unfamiliar faces turned their eyes to him. His mother always raised him for the aristocratic life, but this was a little much.
“You silly!” Tristan giggled around an apple slice, and Gwen squeezed his sides a bit, trying to get the boy to calm down and eat.
“No. No, the only people who know he’s here are me and Ron, um, the Deputy Auror… we were on a raid, and it went wrong. I called for backup and brought him here. Have you alerted his mother, yet? She’s his emergency contact.”
“Darling, it is my pleasure to take care of you. How are you feeling? Should you be out of bed?” She wrapped her arms around him in a gentle hug, not wanting to hurt him if his body was still sore.
“I won’t hear of it,” she told him, fixing him with a stern look. Okay. Right then. Long hair it was. She was so firm on it, he was a bit surprised.
Gregory Goyle and Vincent Crabbe each threw a hex at Harry, who cursed under his breath and leapt behind the armoire for cover.
“Lovely, lovely.” She gave him a quick kiss at his temple and pulled away. “I hope we’ll see you here next week, as well.”
"Talk to him, hm? He probably felt like he pushed you too far, or that he read your signals wrong." Remy offered him a kind smile.
I find myself oddly excited for your return, because then I can shift down and smell you. The shirt you sent back was
“I took the liberty of having the house elves pack his belongings, Lucius,” the old man said, folding his hands behind his back. The other man only nodded mutely, staring down at his wife and child. There was nothing he could do for his boy, now. No spell can reawaken the dead.
"Well! There is your answer!" He squeezed Draco's shoulder before patting him on the back. "You say the word, we will get you the champagne to celebrate."
“No, no! I’d like that, very much. If I don’t find him today, I’ll just worry myself sick about him at Grimmauld. Dinner with you would be much more enjoyable.”
"We have Sundays at mine, darling. Feel free to dress comfortably, it isn't anything out of the ordinary. Yule, however, now
Hooray, new chapter! It's midterm season for a lot of us, so why not take a short little break and read our new addition? :) -M
“Indeed. That’s probably why it worked.” She cracked half a smile at him before schooling her face back to her usual stern expression. “As usual, though, I believe you might be a special case. Filius and I have had multiple discussions about you and your magic since we found out
“The…” Right. Best not to question it. “Right. Let’s see it.” She led him up to the third floor, and for a moment, Harry thought she would lead him to his own bedroom. She stopped just before Harry’s door, however, and grinned at him.
“But it’s different than bonding jewelry, right? You don’t just get your sweetheart bonding jewelry like ‘
Narcissa leaned forward again, taking Harry’s hand in hers. “Since the day you two met, you have captured Draco’s attentions. I cannot recall a single week going by without him mentioning you in some way, shape, or form. It only makes sense to me, then, that Draco was terrified of the thought of his affections being returned. Do you understand?”
“Hey, be nice! I was taking care of a sick toddler, and then caught his fever! I normally don’t look like that, Draco.” She rolled her eyes at him and picked up her purse. “We’re rescuing Bas from work, come on.”
“Besides,” the nurse continued, “Charlie Weasley just woke up, so why don’t you go talk to him while he eats his breakfast?”
Narcissa seemed to take a moment to gather herself before nodding. “Thank you, Harry.” He swallowed thickly and nodded. They stood in silence for a moment or two.
Neville nodded. “Yeah. Try to visit more often, alright? The papers don’t add up to the real thing.” Harry laughed and give his friend a little salute as he headed towards the door.
Also… please show me off in Diagon. Or Hogsmeade. Or wherever we are. Am I to be your trophy husband? Want and worry for nothing while my gorgeous partner spoils me? Except for the moons, darling, then I get to spoil and pamper you. I'll draw you a lovely bath with healing oils and wash your hair, feed you little bits of fruit and cheese and nuts, bring you fancy chocolate bonbons as I spread you out over the bed and spend an hour making you come so you're nice and relaxed and can finally fall asleep. I'll take care of you, Draco, I promise. Just like I know you'll take care of me.
It sounded like a beast out of a faerie tale. It sounded even more ferocious than the nesting Horntail he'd faced as a teenager.
I am curious, do you think your animagus form may, itself, be a wolf? There seems some strange sort of irony in that. Though I must say — I do like the idea of that. All of me likes that idea.
Harry hauled himself up a bit more, and then settled with a sigh into the small space. It was surprisingly comfortable and warm and he could feel each breath that the dragon took. The gentle motion was comforting, and he was soon dozing off.
Draco sighed softly, pulling on a sweater. These nights were still freezing. And they may have thought he had some tragic story, that was all well and good, but they certainly wouldn’t appreciate a Dark Mark at the dinner table. He checked the address again and sighed to himself. He had been completely coerced into having dinner with a stranger and his family… even if he
Gwen paused and hummed a bit. "Well, let's see. I had three children. They had seven. And I now have five great-grandchildren. Plus a few spouses here and there… more than 20, darling."
"A bit odd, but not overly so. Crowlins. They're not particularly well liked among purebloods as is, most likely they couldn't secure a marriage for their heir."
Well… All that was left was to tell everyone else the news of his new love interest. It was very important to tell the Weasleys about his intentions to court Draco… without telling them that he'd been turned. Well, maybe he could tell Bill, at the very least. And maybe Ron. Unless Ron already knew. But it would be the courting bit he had a problem with, knowing him. And he'd probably take more of an issue with the old Pureblood tradition of courting than him going after Draco. Ron knew how well they worked together, and how they had a solid friendship.
They escaped with Dobby's help, and Bellatrix's dagger had found its mark in the elf's chest even as they Apperated to Shell Cottage.
“My offer stands, Mr. Malfoy’s current condition aside.” So even if he said no, even if he washed his hands of the idea of teaching… She was still going to teach him. He bit his lip.
He stepped forward into a clearing and couldn’t help but to gasp. Just as they’d said, there was a dragon that was frankly, fairly huge. It could easily throw Harry aside with one swipe of its tail. Silvery scales that seemed to shimmer with rainbows whenever the sunlight managed to catch on them, wide wings that could probably lift it in into the air in a single beat—long spiralled horns, too. Hell, it was gorgeous. And it was… running into trees on purpose? That was what it looked like, at least. Stepping further in, Harry looked around—Ah, perfect.
Unable to stop himself from grinning at Charlie’s sense of humour, so similar to the twins, Harry sat at the chair beside the bed. He’d brought the letter to reference back to, which now seemed like it had been a brilliant idea. “That dragon that attacked you was here in Britain. I got a letter from the Ministry. They want it identified and taken care of so that it doesn’t end up attacking again.”
If the Gryffindors had been paying more attention, or could have afforded a thought that wasn't purely survival, they would've noticed a distinct lack of Malfoys at Malfoy Manor. No Lucius, no Narcissa; only prisoners in the cellar, low-ranking Death Eaters in the hall, and Bellatrix to carve slurs into Hermione in an effort to get information on Harry Potter (who was in the cellar with the others.)
Harry sat up a bit straighter, brow furrowed and jaw set stubbornly. Draco liked to call it his Auror Face. “What does he say? Is he alright? I sent Porthos with a letter around noon…”
And it does heal my heart, a fair amount knowing that you were shifted as well. I can’t quite explain it, at least… Not in words, it… It’s quite like the smells, isn’t it? Something we
Harry fell from his broom as he reached the hallway. The high shrieking was still coming from the Room of Requirement, and Harry assumed it was the horcrux. Acting on instinct, he kicked the diadem back into the room, and the door closed on its own.
She seemed surprised at the question before she smiled and nodded. “Yes, he did. You’re looking to court someone?”
The dragon had turned to look at Harry as he blabbed on, and at one point Harry could have sworn the dragon had a look of shock or even fear in his eyes. Harry shrugged it off as just another quirk of this unusual creature and continued his train of thought.
Luna’s eyes widened, and for once, she seemed surprised. “Oh. I assume that didn’t go well for him.” He handed over the letter, and let her read. He watched her face, watched her eyes flit as they scanned the parchment. “Oh, poor Draco… It sounds like his wolf misses its mate.”
“...right.” Was being friends with her still bad? Should he stop coming around as often as he did? He’d always felt like they’d had a good break up, all things considered, but maybe he was wrong? He put his empty mug down on the coffee table.
He picked up a twig and used his hands to break it in half so as to not sneak up on the dragon, watching it pause and twist its head towards him. Harry held his hands out for it to see that he was unarmed. “Hey,” he said quietly, leaning down to kneel on one knee. “Hey there. Hey. You’re okay.” The dragon seemed to snarl at him, and shit...it was probably gonna come for him next. He might have enough time to take out his wand and cast a shield charm… It was walking away from him. What was this dragon
Refresh my memory, you taught a class yourself in fifth year, didn't you? In Defense? Quite frankly it sounds — Bloody perfect.
Your mum has absolutely given me scrolls and books on proper courting… some of them dating back before the Crusades! Clearly outdated and some of these ‘trials’ are unnecessarily dangerous… that being said, I’ve definitely already saved your life twice. (In the case with medieval France, we’ve been married since we were 17. Cheers to us!)
A blond man with his father's jaw sat beside Sapphire, and Draco guessed this must be Gwendolyn's last son. "My older brother Alistair, and his wife Storm over there with all the plates."
I’d very much like it if we spoiled and took care of each other. Making up for childhoods and lost time, we’ll say, right? We’re each other’s trophy husband. (Er, trophy fiancé? Trophy-husbands-to-be? Unimportant.)
The locket… Harry retrieved the locket from his old Headmaster's pocket and soon realized that it wasn't the one Dumbledore had described-- no ‘S’ to he seen. The note inside-- from a one R.A.B.-- indicated that it was a fake, that Dumbledore had weakened himself for nothing…
“Um, well, there’s something else I’ve got to tell you guys… concerning this whole thing.” He cleared his throat and looked between his two best friends. “...I’m going to court him. If he lets me.”
His smile fell a small amount. “I expect you will.” Sapphire and Remy turned away, bidding everyone else goodbye as they left. Draco felt someone gently tap his shoulder and turned to find Sebastien standing behind him.
Sorry for the lack of our ghostly lad, I promise he's coming up! (Still taking name suggestions, btw.)
Laughing quietly, Molly nodded. “I did, yes. You can typically find any wizarding jewelry store and they’ll do bonding jewelry as well.” Wizarding jewelry stores… did Diagon have any? He hadn’t paid much attention. “I would recommend Celesti Alley. A wonderful shop up there.”
Usually, Harry Potter was not in the Critical and Highly Risky Incidents Ward at St. Mungo's, where his ex was being treated for a vicious dragon attack—3rd degree burns, bites, and all.
cooking. I like it a lot more than I did when I was little.” She looked up from the letter and made eye contact with him.
“Coq du Vin,” Alistair told him. “Come on, come sit.” Bas ended up taking the seat across from Draco, with Gwendolyn at Draco’s left, at the head of the table, and Derrick at Draco’s right.
The rest of the family was quiet, though grins were spreading across each and every face. (Except Felix, he was very much asleep.) Gwendolyn cleared her throat. “Have you thought of asking to be reassigned partners, if he infuriates and antagonizes you so?”
She smiled at him. “Wonderful.” Standing, she walked over to him and took his face in her hands, kissing his hairline. “Please find him, and bring him home?”
It was a good day for flying, and Harry was glad for it. He much preferred broom travel to Apparating for work. After a few hours, he touched down, perhaps an hour or so outside of Salisbury, within walking distance of a wizarding town called Garmsby. The whole county and surrounding areas were magical and therefore not on Muggle maps. He'd need to find a room for the night, and ask some locals about recent creature activity to see if the dragon had been spotted.
Draco knew war was coming and he had a strong gut feeling that it would be coming to Hogwarts. And he couldn't help but worry, living or not.
"You have to not only see the animal you will become, but manipulate your core to shift your very being
He followed her, wary as to what it might be, pausing in the doorway as he spied a thick white and silver book on the table. ...Surely this wasn’t a spellbook. Narcissa sat down on the couch in front of the coffee table and glanced to the seat beside her before looking back up at Harry with a raised eyebrow. Right. Apparently he had to sit there with her. He took his seat and bit his lip. She pulled the large book into her lap and moved a bit closer to Harry, so he could easily see.
The day passed far too quickly, in Draco’s opinion, and soon enough, he found himself looking over a piece of parchment as he stood on the front step. So this was his great aunt's house. It was rather large, and in good taste, that he was glad to see. Much like a classier, well-kept, French Grimmauld Place. His next letter from Harry had been delivered on the walk over-- Porthos was apparently too dramatic to wait until Draco got home.
As I said before, I'll be watching Teddy this weekend, and I'll be shifted as soon as the moon rises. Not long now, darling. You'll be in my arms before you know it.
"Oh- No, no, that's not mine- I'd prefer you not wash it, it's very delicate," he blurted out. If she washed it, it would lose the scent.
“So I was going to start reading it seriously, making notes of my own. It’s something I want to do for him, when he gets home. He shouldn’t have to spend the full moons alone.”
You don't have to do this alone, I can help you. We'll find someone to brew wolfsbane potion for you so the full moons aren't as bad. I know that Remus had a hard time, and he had my dad and Sirius
As he suspected, there was no Dark Mark on the boy’s left forearm. No, Riddle didn’t care enough to Mark him, but there were telltale scars from at least one session of Crucio curses by his hand. Albus sighed and shook his head. It was time to invent the narrative.
“Non. A break is you sit down and let me feed you chocolate and strawberry crêpes.” She grinned at him and pulled out his chair. “Let me spoil you, just a little.”
“Yes, I’ve noticed…” He looked over all the different pieces with a smile. He did wonder what Harry would gift him, if they were to genuinely court. Or… or what he might pick for Draco's bonding piece. The thought made a touch of color appear on his face.
I've never gotten a stiffy faster in my life. A deeply satisfying wank session followed me receiving your letter. (Though I think you had a much better time creating those photos, didn't you darling?) I've never wanted to eat your gorgeous arse as much as I have since your last letter came. Practically drooling like a dog over it.
Something was missing from the castle that afternoon, though none of the students could put their finger on it. The Great Hall, corridors, and staircases were completely devoid of ghosts. Even Peeves was nowhere to be found, his antics put to a temporary halt.
“And Draco, god, he loves going around the Ministry in his top-quality designer wand-made tailored whatever-other-prefixes clothes. I think he has them specifically tailored to show off his arse, you know? I wouldn’t be surprised.” He’d heard about a couple flings that Draco had had over the years, so it really wouldn’t surprise him if Draco were to do something like that. “He chooses good colours, at least. Kinda like you. I’ve never seen anyone with scales like yours, you know that?”
“And trés tragic, with all those husbands, hm?” Remy sipped his wine and arched an eyebrow at Draco. “So, her son… you and him, maybe are..?”
Narcissa was laughing at him, now. “No, no, I think you should keep them. They make wonderful decorations.”
sweat. I’d probably have to take care of you and make sure you got a good and proper shower. Of course, what with your track record, I’d probably have to go with you and make sure you washed
Draco Malfoy's task had been an impossible one and his father knew it to be another punishment for failing Voldemort last year… And now, Lucius stood in Dumbledore's office, in front of the man his son was tasked to kill, with his son lying dead in his wife's arms. He could not summon the energy for fury.
That sobered Ginny up pretty quickly. Shit… Harry could absolutely use the help these men would provide… Things had been hard on him the past few years and it didn’t take a genius to know that their friend— their brother— needed to get out of his rut. Needed some tough love. Needed some genuine, kind-hearted meddling from 5 gay men.
“Well, they put me with the Dursleys because there was some kind of protection in her blood because she gave herself up for me.” But… How could there be any kind of blood magic protection if the Dursleys weren’t magic?
Pouring the batter into the pan, Harry stared down at it. “There were lots of days I wished I didn’t come back.”
Your full name? Really? That's what's getting you off, right now? I've got to ask, then. What doesn't get you off? Do you even have limits? I do, before you ask, I'm just wondering how far you'll take this.
He doesn't have a shadow, he noticed as he sat in a window looking out at the Black Lake. The revelation coaxed a small laugh out of him-- the first in so, so long-- and it attracted attention.
The last time a student had died in the castle, poor Myrtle Warren had seen the Heir of Slytherin's basilisk head-on and perished on the spot. Albus had only been deputy headmaster at the time, and he knew the decision to keep Myrtle’s death a secret had not been an easy one for Headmaster Dippet, but widespread panic through the student body had to be circumvented.
“Yes, I am… I’m not sure where to start…” He looked at her and subconsciously rubbed his inner wrist. “What did he do for you, exactly?”
The spell caught Malfoy straight in the chest and threw him backwards. Instead of creeping closer to investigate what the spell had actually done to Malfoy, Harry turned on his heel and left the bathroom, adrenaline coursing through his system. He didn't return to the Great Hall for breakfast, instead going back to his dormitory to think about what other evils were quickly coming to get him. If Malfoy was bringing cursed objects into Hogwarts, who knew what would happen next.
I agree that it's a bit too early to think of babies, at least too early for seriously considering it. Teddy is spending the next full with me, so I'll watch for any wolf-like signs that I wouldn't normally see. Maybe the next time I'm at the Burrow, I'll ask Luna and Ginny if they'd consider us for surrogate fathers when they're ready. Gin is still mostly focused on Quidditch and Luna is… doing what she wants, I suppose. And honestly darling, I think if Teddy is only sensitive to the moon, and doesn't completely shift, I think any babies of ours would be fine. That's why you'll research a bit, right?
Draco and the Baron held eye contact for a few silent moments before the other ghost looked away. “You know, that might very well be what you end up being called.”
What would you tell me to do, if I were there with you? I’d love to hear every detail of exactly what you’d have me do, and what you’d do to me. It’s only fair, after all.
I like that idea. Teddy at Hogwarts with us. Imagine him sitting to the side in your classes, trying to take his best notes and ending up doodling for half the class. It sounds perfect.
Draco hid behind a fallen statue in the Great Hall, feeling every inch the ghost he was as Voldemort's voice rang through the grounds.
I spent the entire night as a wolf, from the moment the moon rose. As such, I didn't read your letter until this morning. You sweet thing… This past moon might be the last you ever have to spend alone, depending on when you decide to come home. I'm glad that your potion put you more at ease. I take it you had very few problems brewing it, no major disasters or Finnegan-level explosions? Hah, made myself laugh there.
“Oh, no. He’s the type that would have confronted me about it, if it had mattered so much.” Harry rushed headfirst into everything, why hadn't he done that with him? Draco had fully expected a row that morning, and instead Harry had just followed his lead, stiffly saying nothing. “I don’t have much hope for the situation.”
” This wasn’t making sense, though it was true, he did have a stellar record with the Aurors, but… This was something else entirely. The waiter was grinning at him, even as he summoned a pitcher of water and a glass for Draco’s table. Watching him carefully, Draco slowly poured himself a glass, taking a sip and whetting his lips.
“Well no, er, we weren’t. Aren’t? But I feel like we were moving that way. I mean, I kissed him like a year ago, and he ran off, but… things were looking okay for a while.”
“Enough of that, you stubborn boy. Gwendolyn or Gwen is just fine, if you don’t feel like calling me ‘Aunt’.” She gave his shoulder another squeeze. “Come sit up by me and Derrick, hm? Some nice friendly faces for company.” And she breezed out to the kitchen, like Draco hadn’t just told her his biggest, most dangerous secret.
"So, my dear, we know you are an auror, with all your exciting adventures and tricky cases… but what do you do outside of work? What are your hobbies, who are your friends?"
"That, ah… That'd be two now, ma'am." The sigh she let out was long and silently spoke of suffering from idiots like him for far too long. She summoned a freshly picked leaf from the potions stores and handed it over.
Thank you for your concern, however I am capable of protecting myself. You don’t always need to be a Savior. I should have seen it coming a mile off, but I didn’t, so now I’m paying for it. And we only have the best case statistics because half the time you’re put on cases that would otherwise be suicide attempts, but alas, nothing is capable of stopping a stubborn Boy Who Lived ten trillion fucking times. Could you honestly see me as an Unspeakable? I wouldn’t be able to talk about my work to anyone. Now suggest it again.
And feeling the leaf slip down his throat. "Uh… Prof- Headmistress… Would using a sticking charm work?" She looked at him for what seemed like a long time. She began to massage her temple and sighed.
He laughed and shook his head, looping his arm with hers. "You haven't aged since our third year. Besides, Draco would kill me if we had such a spectacular party without him." Besides, Harry desperately needed to see Draco in Baroque era dress, and definitely wouldn't know where to start with planning a party of that size. Narcissa laughed again, and the two entered the room into her bedroom- Oh, she seemed to have a fairly good handle on the pixies, seeing as quite a few were already immobilized.
"Not at all, Mondays are very slow. Did you see something you liked?" She gestured at the window. "Anything I can show you better inside?"
“It is, a bit. She knows he’d come to Grimmauld first, when he eventually comes back, so she wanted to be there too. And I guess… we’re both a bit lonely without him. And I don’t like the thought of her alone in that huge house. Besides, we get on pretty well.”
but you smell amazing Draco. I just want to sniff and lick you, wolf form or no. As a thank you… and an incentive to write back quickly, I’ve also sent you a present.
“Probably around the end of fifth year, when he shot up,” he joked, smiling down at the photo. “He’s… he’s tiny.” He rubbed the back of his neck and glanced up at Narcissa. “Was it- was it difficult? Having him?”
He sighed. “Yeah. I know.” Draco always had his heart in the right place. His head typically steered him off track. The two of them sat in silence for a few minutes, letting the emotions from Draco’s letter settle. Finally, Narcissa looked over at him.
“Come here, darling. We can go to the bathroom and I can help you with that.” His hair was… still a wreck. Pixie hands, sweat, and dust didn't make a very attractive hairstyle. He shrugged and let her pull him to the bathroom. “I will give your family one thing,” she said as she pulled a potion or two out of the cabinet. “Determined problem solvers. This potion worked miracles of Draco’s hair when he was younger.”
“I understand, darling. I’ll just pop it through, shall I?” A gorgeous tray of food appeared on his desk. Steak, eggs, mushrooms, and a sliced green apple. He could cry, it all smelled so good.
That was another issue… all three of them were certain that Harry would be uncomfortable with so many cameras around… so they'd have to come to a compromise with the producers about it… if it would be shown to anyone, afterwards, as well.
“...Sebastien Frey…” He made quick eye contact with his parents. “...I didn’t have a twin separated at birth, did I?”
It was quite easy to change the wards to allow Narcissa to Floo directly into the first floor parlour. They were both dressed more casually than the night before, though she still wore a floor length dress with long sleeves. Harry greeted her with a smile and actually pressed a kiss to her hand. “Mrs. Malfoy, thanks again for coming. Have you been here before?” He knew that Sirius had grown up here, but guessed that Narcissa had not.
Curious, Harry flicked through the file attached to the letter, picking out the main facts of the case. Clearly, Charlie’s attack was the incident described in the letter, the details in the file expanding on what Charlie had said in the hospital. Harry would have been very interested in the case even without the personal connection, but the fact that the dragon had attacked someone close to him made him even keener to work on the case.
And so, the three of them drafted Harry Potter's Queer Eye submission plea, without the man's knowledge.
"I didn't say none of that! I didn't say it's got to do with magic! Just that Harry's gonna make him an even worse brat!"
He’d obviously made a mistake in coming here. There was a gentle hand on his shoulder, and Draco realized that Gwendolyn was standing behind him.
Harry rose an eyebrow. “Uh, thanks? Have you already had breakfast? I was thinking about maybe making some pancakes…”
“The Crowlins? Yes, they’re considered adequate enough, in a pinch. And yes, one or two of them were on his side in the war. They’re trying to start something up, then?” Looking over the file, he watched Draco frown. “They want us to do it tonight? That’s no amount of time to prepare.”
Though this was not his normal track-and-observe sort of mission, Harry had a basic idea of how this would go. A quick trip back to the office, then home, and he was packed and prepared to set out. He'd replied to Ms. Whitehall via owl that morning after visiting Charlie, letting her know that he was officially on the case. Though his concern about dragon attacks was quite high, Harry admittedly was won over by his curiosity.
Malfoy's body is taken care of, and only 4 people know of his death, Harry Potter decidedly NOT among them.
"I know, I'm everyone's least favorite person this morning. You were expecting someone else?" Someones, more like. Harry knew quite a bit about the drama involving Blaise, Seamus, and Dean, as well as Blaise's growing collection of side-pieces.
“Just going on holiday, Lyn.” He walked over to her, both forms in hand. “Draco wanted me to bring you his, too.”
“Like hell I would ever do that to him. And for the record, I’m not telling anyone where he is so another auror team can bring him in.” He caught Ron’s gaze. “Officially, he and I are on holiday. Not together, no matter what Belinda thinks.”
Draco grumbled with his arms crossed as he followed them. “Don’t see why it’s so difficult to just bloody say my name.”
Harry was shocked. In fact, shocked didn’t even begin to adequately describe what he was thinking or feeling. A long-lost great aunt not only knew that Draco was a werewolf, but was saying Draco loved him. And Harry would be damned if she thought this was at all his fault that they weren’t together. Fuck, he had to write back to her. He had to make sure that Draco’s family knew that it wasn’t
“Oh, sweetheart,” she murmured, bringing him into a hug, though she was a few inches shorter than him. “You’ll be alright. I know you’re scared and worried, but you’re going to be fine.” Her fingers ran through his hair as she held him close.
"I believe it would, yes, though I did not use one. It seems like something your father would've thought to employ, though. Exactly how many Mandrake leaves have you accidentally swallowed, Potter?"
Alright, salve was on. “Okay, I’m gonna bandage it now so none of that salve wipes off. It takes a while for it to do its magic, so can you try not to pick at those bandages? I promise this is to help you. I try not to do anything that’ll set a dragon off on me. You only make that mistake once, in this business.” He just needed to take the bandages out and wrap them around that joint. Shouldn’t be too hard.
"He's been… Draco's been turned?" He watched her expression turn to shock and horror at the thought. Having been around Molly enough, he knew what a mother looked like when her heart was breaking for her children. "Have you asked Blaiziel or Pancella?"
Albus frowned slightly, but nodded his head. He could not force them to abandon their son, no matter how dead he was. “Of course, Narcissa. We will be ready when you decide to return.”
“Well, the way that the old traditions go, you get them a piece of jewelry. Something symbolic, typically that would remind them of the first day you met. If not jewelry, maybe new robes, or shoes, but it’s something they can wear so that people can see that they’re being courted.”
The dragon now had an expression of disbelief, and Harry couldn’t help but defend Charlie. “He really is, and I will not let a dragon besmirch his good reputation.”
Harry frowned and crossed his arms over his chest. “So I can’t dote on the people that I love? I can’t do or buy things that I think will make them happy? Because it will just turn them into brats? What about Teddy, or your baby? I can’t dote on them?”
The dragon caught sight of the collar, and the second he did, he was leaping and bounding away as best he could. Hell, this was going to be like Hermione trying to give Crookshanks a bath, wasn’t it? “Hey,” Harry said as firmly as he could, holding the collar out. “I need to get this collar on you, alright? The Ministry is going to start worrying. You’re an untagged dragon that no one knows anything about, don’t you think that’s a little too dangerous for people to just let you run around unchecked? Didn’t you see the poor trees you murdered on your landing in here?”
had an enlargement charm on the inside. Harry could easily imagine Draco reading in that chair, or answering letters at his desk. He could imagine gently waking him up from that bed. “You… said something about an ensuite?” Grin still fixed on her face, she led him to the other door, which apparently led to their connected bathroom.
"It's important to have role models," Sapphire remarked, mirroring Draco's expression. "And I take it you are definitely not in her line of fire, in the way of possible future husbands?"
Harry snickered at his own joke, not that the dragon would understand. Glancing at it, it was… Smoke was billowing out of its nostrils as he looked firmly away from Harry. What the hell was
She spoke against his hair, Harry acutely aware of the brush of her lips against the top of his head and the warmth she seemed to radiate. "What did he do to deserve you?" That finally choked Harry up, and he took off his glasses to cover his face with his hand.  "No matter what happens between the two of you, there will always be a place for you at the Manor." Harry finally broke down and pulled Narcissa into a full hug before hiding his face in her neck, trying not to let his tears drip onto her dress. She held him there, only quietly hushing him, and saying “I know, I know.”
They were a few feet away from the scene and Harry saw himself-- his young, overly-thin, scared 13-year-old self-- near Hermione, tiny in comparison to her cloud of hair, and Ron, twiggy and towering over them both. All of them stared at Lupin, and at Sirius, who was trying to keep the man under control. Lupin was changing before their eyes, and… When he was young, it had seemed so slow, and torturous, but now, looking back on it, it was much quicker than he’d first thought.
He quieted after a while and wiped his tears, sniffling a bit. “...I’m sorry I got tears all over your dress,” he murmured, trying to lighten the mood just a bit. “Thank you for… all that.”
You are a cruel, cruel man when you want to be, my love. I can only hope that you don’t purposely delay your reply… Please don’t? I’ll get on my knees… I promise to take you collar shopping. (Maybe I’ll end up getting onee, too, who’s to say.)
Forgive me for the comparison, you're nothing like him. And I doubt I'm very much like mine. But enough talk of people with big shadows, hm?
I can’t believe you’re saying that the improved hearing was the best part of it all. I have to disagree completely, that was probably the worst part of it all. It felt like everything was scraping against my ears, or droning into my skull. But… I do like the improved sense of smell. Unfortunately, around the new moon, my senses are most ‘human’ as well. I do understand, though. It’s hard to explain it, isn’t it? It feels like it’s something much more… primal. Like we shouldn’t be able to explain it in any human terms. Like it just is.
“Oh— erm, I told you about the Animagus book I found in Sirius’ room? Well, I skimmed a bit and… they made notes in it. My dad— It’s got their notes and ideas and some jokes in the margins.” He played with his hands a bit, situated in his lap. “Never read my dad’s writing before.”
“I was not in the room when my son was branded, Mr. Potter. I was held in another room, where my sister
"It's not the spells I'm having trouble with. I'm an old woman, Harry, I haven't the youthful energy to be wandering around gathering pixies."
The little lane opened up to a courtyard, a small garden in the center with a fountain that had been turned off for the night. The house he was looking for was directly in the center of the circle, the lights warm and bright in the ground floor windows. As he approached, he could hear overlapping conversations, which didn’t pause as he knocked. The door opened a moment later, and Draco was surprised by all the yellow light and warmth that flooded out of the house and seemed to spill over into his being.
“It’s the best one I knew of in the area.” She just shook her head disapprovingly and led him up the stairs.
Overall, the information Harry collected after that didn’t seem too relevant or important. But what he’d gotten at the beginning. Of course, living in the Wizarding World, and what with the Deathly Hallows, Harry had learned never to doubt legends in the Wizarding World. A line of wizards that can transform into dragons at will? And they weren’t animagi, so that meant they weren’t registered. But then, why would someone attack Charlie? Okay, he couldn’t let himself get carried away with this. First things first, he needed to focus on a dragon that was probably lost and scared.
Doonan stroked his beard, humming. “We see a lot of beasts and creatures in Garmsby, fae folk in the forest and nymphs in the river. But dragons—Dragons are something special.” He paused as Winifred sets down two pints of ale and good-naturedly smacked his shoulder. He took a long drink of his ale, prompting Harry to do the same.
“That’s all he’s got to say?” He handed the letter to Narcissa, sitting back down and grumbling as he picked up his coffee, taking a nice long sip. Narcissa looked over the letter, nodding along. “So he has been turned, then… Well, he’s told you he’s in Paris, though I will stand by my word that you shouldn’t go after him.”
It took them at least a half an hour to find shoes he didn’t absolutely loathe on sight. They were the ‘high tops’ that Bas had told him about, but they were a simple jet black, rather than the blue Valerie had tried to convince him into. He.. actually liked the way they looked. They make his ankles look slim, and he had to admit, there was something attractive about the shoes. Bas and Val each gave him a thumbs up when he glanced at them for approval. And just like that, he bought his first pair of muggle shoes.
[[The letter was attached to a light blue sweater, definitely softer than anything Harry’s got in his wardrobe, and absolutely drenched in Draco’s scent. Like he was wearing it for
“Well, sometimes it’s got sentimental value, like you’re getting the piece done for someone or to remember something. Sometimes, it’s for the aesthetic, you like the way it looks, or the overall tattoo style. And sometimes… you just do it for the hell of it.” Draco felt as though he'd never understand these people. He clutched at his arm where the scar of the mark still laid. Getting one for someone? He had a feeling she meant of your own will, for someone special, not like what had been done to him. “I’m sure he can explain it much better than I can. If you’re interested, he’ll talk forever about it.” She nudged him, and they both took a seat to wait for Bas to finish.
“I’ve been through war, mate. I went up against Volde-No-Nose a bunch of times. Up against Snape, and went on plenty of raids. I’m Deputy Auror. Nothing got me ready for being married with a kid on the way.” Harry couldn’t help but laugh, especially with Ron brandishing a spatula like it was a wand— bits of scrambled egg flying off the end.
It took them the better part of an hour before all the pixies were in the cage and stunned. “Well! Amazing way to keep the day interesting!”
Harry thought as he reached for his bag. “Ah, fuck, what was it they said? I ‘barrelled headfirst into danger and the only thing that would come of that would be disaster.’ I think that was what they said. I didn’t
“Same way I did. A terrible accident that ended up having a happy outcome.” She gestured over to Tristan. “I can’t imagine life without him.”
"Oh yes," Gwendolyn agreed. "I've seen so many beautifully crafted pieces through the years, some bonding sets that have been in families since before the Revolution. Absolutely gorgeous. Of course, rings are the most popular now, as my daughter could probably tell you."
“I hear his father pulled him and had him transferred to Silovikizba**,” a Ravenclaw hissed to their friend group. “With the amount of Dark Arts their family is involved in, it wouldn't surprise me.”
“Yea- came from the West, it did. Huge beasty, must've been larger than a Ridgeback.” Harry was surprised; no one seemed to be terribly afraid, like a new breed of dragon was just another example of the strange things that happened here.
were a horcrux. We have a theory… that Voldemort’s soul attached itself to your magical core, which is one of the reasons you were able to speak Parseltongue. When he carved the piece of his soul from you, we believe that it left a vacuum in your core, and your magic slowly began to fill it.” Harry looked like he was having trouble following, and McGonagall sighed. “Simply put, Potter, you might have a reservoir of magic in your core. A ‘core and a half’ worth of magic, if you will.”
She smiled and showed him the golden ring on her finger with a gem in it. It looked orange, but it looked like it was
do I miss your smell. Is that strange? You’ve always had this certain scent about you that smells like a forest and fire all at the same time and it’s just so incredibly you. I miss it so much. I miss you.
Conjured oil might not be the best, but I know it would make you sweat if I did it wandlessly, wouldn't it? Maybe I'd only do that for my fingers. I could spend hours with my fingers in you, love, until you're begging me to stop and wailing for my cock. I don't think I'll tease you, the first time. You know I'm not a very patient man.
Charlie slowly nodded. “I had seen the dragon while I was romping out near Salisbury. I was gonna make it a surprise to the family that I was back, but I decided to get in a good hike first. Then I spotted just a dragon right in the middle of the forest, not far off the trail. Of course I wanted to help the poor thing. Seemed terrified out of its wits, confused—you know how they can be.”
“No no-- they sent him to Durmstrang-- Karkaroff was a Death Eater too. Probably got special treatment--”
But Ron and Ginny? They shared a favorite that seemed unusual for the pair of them and their normal tastes.  There was a certain show that had them both hooked, a reboot of a similar show from when they were children… but this new version was so much better.
He gave a smile much against his will at the sight of it all. “I… I’ve been told as much, at least.” He took his seat and Gwen spelled a bit of fresh whipped cream to the top of the tower of crêpes.
"Only temporary hallucinations, Mr. Potter, and like I said, you have nothing to worry about. Now, like I said, the next step requires meditation. You need to keep the leaf in your mouth for 28 days, while spending at least an hour each day meditating and trying to visualize your magical core-- the glow, the color, the feel of it, sometimes even the scent or taste."
“Well, yeah…” He cocked his head a little. “I couldn’t go back to the Auror corps without him, they’d partner me with someone else, and probably make me take him in and register him… And I won’t do that to him.”
“Like I said, my lovely wife has more than enough magic for the two of us.” And Ametrine’s hair went bright pink as she giggled and smacked his arm. He… didn’t understand these people.
Harry paused, unsure of what to say. The cottage his parents had died in wasn't a Potter property, it was Dumbledore's. Come to think of it… he hadn't thought much about
“These shoes, star child, just in black.” Draco looked down and hummed. Bas had on a pair of red canvas shoes, black and blue spotted socks disappearing up into his cuffed jeans. Huh… “They don’t cover your ankle, but the high top Converse do.” Valerie appeared with three boxes stacked atop each other.
I'm trying to keep all the characters as true to the books as I can, but keep in mind it's been a while since I've read them. If anything or anyone seems OOC, let me know! Or if I'm doing a good job, please comment!
Could you honestly see me as an Unspeakable? I wouldn’t be able to talk about my work to anyone. Now suggest it again.
I would love to take him in, have him live at Grimmauld with us and your mum. Hell, Andy could come live with us too, Merlin knows we have the space for it. And the five of us are all that’s left of the House of Black, you know? And when we go to teach, we’ll come back for the weekends, or bring him to Hogwarts with us. I’m sure the castle could make room for one more little boy, don’t you think?
by ‘she knew everything?’ Did she know…? Did she know about the ill-fated almost-date a year and a half ago..?
Have you given any thought to my request since our last meeting? If you decline, please owl me with a list of people you think can best fit the positions.
"No, I don't believe I do. Abraxas' wife was named Marianne, not Gwendolyn, and Septimus' wife was Cressida, if I remember correctly… why do you ask, dear?"
"Indeed it is." A flick of his wrist showed the containment charms and 'fence hexes' that Harry had set up. "Ready?" Draco gave him a nod, his wand at the ready. Right then. No time for fanfare, they might set off alarms the second they stepped on the property. Harry nodded back at him in confirmation, and they both dashed towards the house, crossing the property line.
Harry had gotten his done first, the fluttering snitch now taking up a few inches on the front of his right forearm. Euthymia said nothing, then, about Draco's upcoming appointment for the same ink.
When you get this, I’d like you to make yourself come. Get yourself high up on your bed, spread your legs wide, and spell your toy to fuck your sweet hole like you did for the pictures until you ruin your sheets. Fuck yourself like you want me to when you come home.
“He does not know much of your pre-Hogwarts years, but I’ve been able to guess a few things from his letters over the years.” She cleared her throat and suddenly a box appeared on her lap. Opening it, she pulled out a few letters.
Albus Dumbledore stood in front of his desk, facing the Malfoys as they entered the room. “Narcissa, Lucius, thank you for coming so soon… I’m afraid I am the bearer of… the worst news imaginable.”
"No silver, my love," she said as she stepped behind him and fastened the chain around his neck. Draco glanced into the nearby mirror and smiled. He did adore it… It would be a shame to have to leave the shop without it. "Do you like it?" Sapphire asked, smile on her face. He hadn't even realized he'd reached up to gingerly touch the pendant.
me. He just started attacking. I didn’t have a chance. Surprised he didn’t kill me, though. He definitely had the chance.”
Colin Creevy would be Obliviated for the boy’s own peace of mind, perhaps Poppy, too. The Malfoys would be told that Draco had suffered multiple breakdowns over the past few weeks-- stress from Riddle’s impossible assignment and mounting war tensions-- and had slit his wrists in the toilets this morning, while everyone was down at breakfast. The less people that knew about this the better… Everything would be fine.
The first run-in at her shop occured in 2000. Draco had been on the table, on his front, shirtless as Euthymia carefully tapped out the outline of a dragon on his shoulder. The door opened and Harry stepped through, though the curtain was up for privacy.
A quick tap of his wand to the broom restored his Firebolt to its original size. Seeing that Harry’s plan was to fly, the dragon snapped its teeth at him, making Harry jump back, and then immediately onto his broom.
"Keeping my focus, mostly. You're quite good at that." Harry took a few small sips of his tea, looking at her over the rim of the cup. "Having focus and accomplishing things."
"Indeed, Potter. The center and source of all the magic you can call upon…" She paused, pinning him with a calculating gaze. "Despite the chaos of your time at this school, surely you learned about magical cores."
Draco felt his cheeks flush. “No, no, really-” But the bottle was already floating towards him. Damn their hospitality. He was doomed from the start.
Tears rushed to Lucius’ dull grey eyes. He looked up at Dumbledore, breath caught in his throat. He couldn't breathe-- he couldn't breathe. “What-?” He croaked, tears slipping down his gaunt face. “No-”
Rather than risk angering the dragon even further, Harry decided it would just be easier to go along with it. “I want you to know that I’m doing this under protest,” he couldn’t help but add. The dragon just snorted.
"--so we're keeping it hush-hush. No problem, Harry," she assured him with a salacious wink and a grin. "Not a word out of me. But do have a good time, have a fancy little umbrella drink for me, will you?" She collected the forms from Harry and they filed themselves accordingly.
I’ll have you know that I didn’t kiss arse at school, especially not with the teachers. They either loved or hated me for their own reasons. (Also, in case you haven’t realized, I’m pretty handy with a wand, even if I can’t necessarily duel creatively.) Not to toot my own horn, but my magic is strong… and I know that’s part of the reason why you’re attracted to me.
“Don’t make him choose between a partner and family, Ron—” She said, but Harry was already standing up. He didn’t come for a fight, and he didn’t want to spend too long thinking about if he’d have to choose between Draco and the Weasleys.
“He was found in the toilets this morning by a 4th year Gryffindor student… We believe it was suicide. His wrists were slit, and not by magic.” He paused as Narcissa wailed, burying her face in her son's neck. Of course… this is a lie, but the Malfoys didn't need to know that. Albus saw this as an opportunity to sway two more powerful people towards his side. If he could gain two more spies like Severus, it could be the turning point of the war. Riddle wouldn’t know what hit him.
"Marvelous! Perhaps we take a little trip to the Loire Valley? Tour the wine caves, get you to try their sparkling wine. A wonderful day trip, I must say." Remy sipped from his glass and Sapphire cleared her throat.
He had to sit there and wonder, if Harry were to court him, what would he get him? Maybe he would get him a necklace. Or perhaps he would think Draco full of himself enough to get him a circlet. Draco laughed to himself. Oh Merlin, he didn’t know of Harry’s taste in jewelry, and didn’t know if Harry could guess his… but in his little fantasy, Harry knew exactly what to get him, and how to present it. He would say all the right words, and it would be a very thin chain of white-gold, because he likely didn’t react to silver well anymore, and there would be a small emerald pendant, and he would clip it around Draco’s neck for him and say-
He watched Charlie tut, shaking his head. “Here I was hoping for a rousing session of getting-back-together sex. What do you need?”
It had hit him, a few years ago, on his 22nd birthday, when he realized that his parents had never made it to that age, and how young they were when everything happened. They had become parents at 20 years old… Harry definitely couldn't imagine himself getting married when he was 20. It was unreal. In his hands was proof that his father deeply loved his friends and would go to great lengths to make sure they were loved and cared for.
Harry plucked the diadem from the mannequin-- from Draco's head-- and hissed as the now-familiar dark magic of Voldemort's soul tried to affect his mind. Harry-- and indeed Draco as well-- had been too distracted with the tiara to realize that he had been followed.
That had Neville’s eyes widening. “Oh. Oh, jeez, I knew you two… I- Alright, then.” Harry grinned sheepishly and tucked his hands into his pockets.
“It’s gorgeous there. Just being out there, the smell of the earth and the grapes under the sun… they make some excellent wine. We usually go in August, but it’s wonderful this time of year, too,” Valerie said, handing off the apple slices to her son and grandmother. Draco watched as Gwen fed him.
Harry looked down at the unappetizing breakfast tray in the nurse’s hands and shrugged. He might as well. The nurse led the way through a series of hallways and corridors to a white hospital door that looked like all the other white hospital doors.
Don’t let Granger know that you’ve been helping fund it, though. I trust you’ve been doing it all anonymously? You know how she’ll react if she finds out it’s from you. She and Weasley are meant for each other, truly. Neither can accept any kind of charity, can they? You know, when I noticed that he was coming in with worn down robes, I
A low growling drew Harry’s attention from the window, and he turned towards the source. The wizard Draco had been dueling had staggered back and dropped his wand. In an instant, a huge salt and pepper wolf took his place. Although Harry was dueling three wizards of his own, he saw the moment the werewolf leaped at Draco.
good, but I know it will never compare to the real thing. The more I try to put your scent into words, the less I can grasp it. Apparently canine senses don’t transfer exactly to a human vocabulary.
Harry was so deep in thought as he walked into his kitchen in search of a cup of tea that he almost didn’t notice the large, stern looking owl sat on his kitchen table. He immediately recognised the owl as belonging to the Ministry; somehow all of their owls managed to adopt the exact same officious and self-important look that graced the faces of many senior ministry officials.
"As I said, your core is the source of your magic. Think of it as… as a second heart, it pulses and pumps your magic through your body, and into your surrounding aura. Following me so far, Potter?"
"He's, ah, taking his holiday in France. He needs a bit more rest and relaxation than I do. He's the one that was injured." He rubbed the back of his neck again. "When he gets back, I plan on courting him, though."
I promise I was a good boy for you. The question is: will you be a good boy for your Master? Will you be good for me, baby? I do hope so… I'd hate to put you over my knee as soon as you come home. Unless that's exactly what you're hoping for.
“I’ve learned to never underestimate the Black family. They can and will surprise you.” He took a sip of his wine, wondering if it would be appropriate to ask about Sirius or Regulus… perhaps over tea, not dinner.
Of course Hermione doesn’t know I helped financially. I would be a dead man, or at the very least in St. Mungo’s. She does, however, know about your mum and Andy contributing from the Black vaults. (I think it made her smug, that Walburga’s money was being used to help creatures and other less fortunate.) Andy has asked me to call her that since around the time she found out I was named his godfather. I can’t remember her exact words, but I think it was something about being a team, so I got some family rights in the name department.
“Aye we have,” another patron interrupted them. “Saw the shadow first on the 6th, was that a Tuesday?”
“We thought that was the case. Their father was known to be… extreme, in his fits of rage. My mother believes he
Oh, he was talking to the Mandrakes. Harry had only seen them as babies in second year, and boy could they scream then. Could… could Mandrakes talk once they reached adulthood? Maybe he should've paid more attention… It definitely didn’t seem like they could talk. “Georgina, I’m gonna just prune one little leaf, alright? Alfred, don’t worry, I’m not planning on moving either of the two of you, just one little leaf.”
He watched Charlie think it over, shaking his head. “No breed I’ve seen before. Hope no one’s crossbreeding again, hate fixing those messes. Four legs, huge wings, a tail probably four metres long.” Alright, at least it wasn’t a wyrm or a wyvern, then. “It was silvery white, almost
They spent a good amount of the evening speaking about bonding jewelry, each married person there showing their ring (or other piece) to Draco in turn. Though neither Derrick or his mother had magic, their rings held just a touch of it, from their respective spouses. Sapphire explained that she and Remy both had necklaces, because they each worked with their hands so often. All in all, it was a good night, and they insisted he come to Sunday dinner to meet the
“Mmm two weeks ago. The Harpies had a few games, and I believe she is visiting Charlie, because the reserve is so close. Lavender tea?”
to be surrogates for her and Ginevra. As it is, we need to worry about my own and Teddy’s condition before we begin to consider possible offspring that it would be passed down to.
“Oh! That’s what they look like when they’re-? Interesting. I’m allergic to strawberries, you know.”
Harry decided he would finish the hunt for Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes, as Dumbledore had been. He would assure that the Headmaster did not die in vain… He would see this through, and he would kill Voldemort. One scrap of soul at a time.
The next day at work, he acted like nothing happened. I was a bit hungover, and didn’t want to cause a fight that would cost what relationship I already had with him. So I didn’t bring it up.
And, well… I think second sexiest. I would be willing to try for a teaching position at Hogwarts in Potions… On one condition. I’ll let you guess.
Harry hugged her back, and now he was definitely crying. Again. Why did she keep doing this to him? “Thanks.” She pressed a kiss to the top of his head and he had to close his eyes for a minute. He’d been emotional Ike this since she’d arrived in his Floo that morning a few weeks ago. He definitely knew why Draco was such a mummy’s boy, first hand. It did make Harry wonder, if he and his parents had all lived in the regular Wizarding World, if he would have been the same.
He blinked a few times, but shook his head. "Not at all, I've just put the kettle on." He opened his mouth once more to ask her about the luggage, but thought better of it. "Why don't you leave all that here, and we'll go to the nook?"
His parents would’ve only been seven years old. That was a very strange thought. Narcissa flipped a few more pages, showing him pictures of her parents, and her sisters, until… the photo was blurry at first, the person in it not staying still like the other subjects were.
I found the book my dad and Sirius used to become animagi in his old room just after I sent that first letter. I've started in on it and it seems pretty difficult. Can't believe they did it as third years, no matter how good at Transfiguration they were. Bloody impressive, really.
“I think it would be best if this stayed between us. The rest of the school, I don't believe they need to know of Draco's suicide. You could simply say you pulled him from Hogwarts, transferred him to another school.” The only place they would be transferring Draco was to the grave.
She’d gently held his wrist and examined his arm. “I’d prefer to use a gun for yours… might avoid some painful memories for you, what do you think?” He’d rubbed over his arm, glancing up at her.
A heavy key appeared on the bar in front of Harry. He seemed to have passed the test. “Two galleons gets you your bed, supper tonight, and a bite in the morning ‘fore y'head off. Good?”
Harry stared, putting a hand on the dragon’s snout. “You… Want me to keep talking?” It didn’t nod, but it seemed like that was what he wanted. “Alright. Alright, okay. I can keep talking, don’t worry. What do you want to hear about? My Auror training? Most people get a laugh out of that. You know Ron did better than I ever could have? I think because he’s big on chess and strategy, and I…”
“Yeah, but Bas does magical tattoos as well. He’s one of the only ones in Paris that does both, you know.” She was obviously very proud of him. “And it’s very close to the Opéra station, so I just use that. Here we are.” Draco hadn’t even realized they’d come to the edge of the wizarding neighborhood.
“No, I think not… though I’m certainly tempted to let you.” She looked over the letter again and tried to compose herself. “He tends to make the right decisions, he just needs time.”
"You've never filed against me in five years for anything remotely serious." He'd reported Harry to Robards for ridiculous things — accidentally using his tea mug, bringing in a cake for his 21st birthday, landing himself in St. Mungo's — but never for sexual harassment or anything that legitimately counted as inappropriate workplace behavior.
Harry shrugged. “Probably because Dumbledore was too busy worrying about horcruxes and an impending war to focus on my clothes or my shoes.”
The hours blended into each other, the tenseness and anxiety only broken up by high protein meals. The sun began to set and Draco was on high alert. It was happening and soon. He felt his breath picking up and as the sun fully set, he was forced to the ground with the pressure that seemed to explode out of him. Wolfsbane meant that he didn’t feel
Truly, Myrtle had been of more comfort and use to him than anyone, especially since his… untimely death. He sat between two sinks, his knees pressed up against his silver-stained chest. He wasn't much for hovering above the stalls like his friend.
“But you still find excuses not to visit, don’t you? So, come on, out with it, what’s on your mind? Just like Ronald, you are.” He blushed and bit his lip.
"I'm attempting to complete an Animagus transformation, and I know you need a Mandrake leaf for that… can you help?"
“I believe we are,” Gwendolyn said, rubbing Draco’s back with her other hand. “Just a bit overwhelmed, October, he’ll be alright.” She pulled away just a bit to look up into his face. “Are you going to be alright for dinner, if we give you a bit of time to compose yourself?” She brushed a bit of hair out of his face.
“Of… course. I’ll be certain to attend.” The older man beamed and stood up again, notepad returning to his hand.
The Room of Lost Things… It was just as chaotic and cluttered as Harry remembered. It would take months to properly sort through everything-- and a flash of silver caught his eye.
“Likewise,” he told her, his gaze slowly travelling back to the breakfast that had been set in front of him. It did look scrumptious… Valerie smirked as Gwen put a steaming mug of tea down on the table.
He was glad that he hadn’t shifted in the hotel… he would’ve been much worse off, hadn’t even thought about food for the morning of. He was glad Gwendolyn had spent the night with him, painful and frightening as both transformations were. Sighing softly to himself, Draco supposed that he had ought to head down to the table for lunch.
He led her to the head of the table and a bit of wandless magic on his part had her chair sliding back enough for her to sit down. (Maybe he wanted to impress her… as much as he could.) She laughed as she sat down, apparently amused by his display. "You know, the way Draco tells his stories would make someone believe you don't have a gentle bone in your body."
Still, the dragon was calm, and was paying attention to him, and seemed to like his voice. Now was as good a time as any to get that collar on him, now that he had his trust. Moving towards his bag, Harry kept talking. “You know, that’s something that Ginny and Hermione both smacked into me a few months ago. I like Quidditch players that care about their family. Isn’t that something? Guess I like a person that can handle a big piece of wood between their legs.”
party be?" He winked at her. "A week-long ball? Fireworks and masquerades? Something to envy the French royalty?"
[[included with this letter is a pair of red and blue tartan sleep shorts. A bit comfier and softer than boxers, it’s obvious Harry has been wearing them to bed for at least a few days. The scent is nice and strong… different than the tee shirts he’s sent before]]
"Of course, my darling," she said, pulling him in close and kissing his cheeks-- two on each side, alternating. "I hope you are hungry, we have a feast planned." And she led him into the kitchen.
Teddy has mentioned quite a number of colors he would like his room painted, since you've asked. His favorites are a deep plum purple, a buttery sunshine yellow, an apple green, and a turquoise that he wears in his hair most often. (Hermione has alerted me that this is 'Tiffany Blue' in the muggle world. High end jewelry, diamonds, and the like. Do you know it?) My guess is, he'd like each wall painted one of these colors. He's very excited for you to come home, by the way. He plans on giving you the 'biggest hug', so be prepared.
Narcissa's sobs had quieted over the course of a few minutes. Now, she laid protectively over her son's body, herself still as stone, and Lucius had the terrible vision of losing them both. That could not and would not happen. The Dark Lord would plague him no longer.
Draco sighed, taking the cup of tea and giving him a grateful nod. “Someone is always going to think they have the path to a better world. What is it, this time?”
Narcissa smiled at him. “I liked the name. And Geminus Lucius Malfoy doesn’t roll off the tongue so well.” Harry paused for a moment, before he started chuckling. All that mystery, and his mother just liked the name. “Well, that, and as far as I could trace back, there had never been a ‘Draco Black’.” That made sense, then. She wanted him to be unique. That was… Wow. That was interesting. He’d keep that in mind.
"Perhaps give it a bit of time before you try again… you might he more comfortable trying this at home. And use the sticking charm." Harry nodded and pocketed the leaf. "Oh, and Potter?"
Thank you for keeping mother company. You know well by now that the days since the war haven’t been kind to her. I hadn’t thought about what my leaving will do to her, but I dread what my return will entail. This is what’s best, right now. It has to be.
I hope you come home soon, sweetheart. I miss you terribly. Prepare to receive a 'big big hug' from me, too.
He couldn’t be late for his first lesson with McGonagall, and he still needed another leaf from Neville. He’d have to hurry. “Um, sorry to run off, Narcissa, but I have an appointment with the Headmistress and I can’t be late.” He stood up and grabbed his leather jacket. “I’ll be home for dinner, though.”
Harry had spluttered a bit, but took his seat, watching as Euthymia continued tapping her wand to the chisel.
Everyone in the room went silent, looking at Draco and the young man who’d just entered through the Floo. It was like looking in a mirror. They were of a similar height and build. Their hair was the same color, though the other man wore it slightly longer. They could’ve been identical twins. Draco could only manage to say, “D… Draco Malfoy.”
“It forms from fear and hatred… not necessarily hatred of the self or of magic individually, but a terrible concoction of fear of persecution, fear of the unknown, fear of the things you can do…” She sat back in her chair and took off her spectacles, taking the time to clean the lenses with the edge of her sleeve. “The house Albus placed you in was not a good one. But I believe the reason you did not develop an
He watched as she tried to hide a smile, and noted that it was the same way that Draco did; poorly, by focusing her attention somewhere else. “I have, yes. My sisters and I often visited during the summers, when we were girls.”
He felt he’d been abandoned by his so-called friends in Slytherin. None of them had come looking for him. They didn't seem overly concerned that he'd vanished in the middle of breakfast. He hadn't ventured into the Slytherin dungeons until after the term ended, but found his bed to be empty… no trunk, no books, no quills and parchment. Someone had packed his things and secreted them away… probably to the Manor.
More than half an hour had passed before Narcissa settled, placed the letter on the table, and drained her teacup in one go. Harry immediately went to refill her cup, and she nodded her head in thanks. “I’m sorry, Harry dear, you were saying?”
The salve flew over to him and he caught it, dipping his fingers into it. “Alright. This is going to be cold at first, but I promise, it’s gonna help you feel better.” He spread the salve across the joint and again the dragon hissed, but still remained fairly calm and docile beside him. This was so strange. “You wanna know another thing?
It seemed like a relatively simple process. Every book, journal, or leaflet always started the same way: a Mandrake leaf, kept in one's mouth, for a full month. There were some differences, of course. Some argued that the leaf must be kept under the tongue, while others said just in one's mouth is fine. Others debated on the time frame-- how long? Did the moon cycle have anything to do with it? 28 days or 31? And what age of Mandrake needed to provide the leaf?
“He’s right back to his usual self, after his last letter,” he said, handing it over to her without a fight.
His smile widened before it began to drop. “I would like that, however I don’t plan on going home anytime soon… May I tell you something? With the understanding you won’t speak a word to another soul?”
Don’t think you can just get away with buying clothes with the intent of giving them to me. I’ve got a keen new werewolf nose. It has to be yours, or it just won’t do. How did Teddy do with the moon, speaking of? Anything we should be worried about?
Felix stirred and Brigitte stood, scooping up her son and moving out of the room to put him to bed for the night. October topped off everyone's glasses, switching out red for white, and settled again beside Draco. That sounded incredibly familiar. "You… You mean charmed muggle artifacts?" The same department as Arthur Weasley?
Usually, Harry Potter would then spend some time looking over his own research and findings before setting out to tend to the creatures themselves. Usually, Harry Potter spent his days with thestrals, fledgling hippogriffs, and ailing phoenixes, perhaps the rogue flaming salamander nest in Blackpool, or sightings of a grindylow family in the Thames—as had happened last April. He did his heavy academic research on dragons mainly, as well as the handful of other fire-associated beasts like chimeras, salamanders, and the phoenix.
Also, I find myself needing a "ghostly name" for Draco, similar to 'Moaning Myrtle', 'Bloody Baron' etc.
-he's still an orphan, and had to suffer many years of the Dursleys before Sirius and Remus came to get him (sirius was wrongly jailed for murder)
The dragon, once so calm and trusting of Harry, was working itself up into a state of extreme agitation. He began to stomp around the clearing, head swinging dramatically from side to side as he tried to rid himself of the collar. Harry quickly darted to the treeline, not wanting to be in the path of those giant feet, really quite worried now that the dragon might hurt him in retaliation for the collar. He could see now how the dragon had managed to injure Charlie so badly - it was big, and powerful, and clearly had a temper.
Draco grinned at their playful teasing. "And Pansy, she's between husbands. It's truly devastating."
“...I did wonder about that,” she admitted, finally getting up and leaning against the counter a few feet behind Harry. “Do you… have many of those days now?”
“I don’t know if they’d consider a bloke from the UK… they’re in Georgia, yeah? I guess we’d just send in a letter… or a sort of audition video over email… Do you want to be made-over, Ron?” she teased with a smirk.
Harry took the letter and his tea through to his office and settled himself down at his desk before opening the letter.
“Oh. Well, because when Draco comes back, I’m certain that he’ll come here first. So it’s only a matter of waiting, now.” Oh, when she put it that way, it did make sense.
It seemed obvious now that the Malfoys could not return to the Manor. Merlin knew what those squatters would do if they knew of Draco's suicide-- what they might do to desecrate his grave or his body. The Manor itself held little reason for them to stay, besides a handful of sentimental items. The vast majority of the Malfoy wealth was hidden away in Gringotts… One quick chat with a house elf, and they would never set foot in the Manor again.
Full moon is this weekend. How about we save the celebrations for when I'm at home, yes? It'll be soon, Harry. I miss you, too.
“Think I'll keep to myself when they all come back… what with the war on and all.” He ran a translucent hand through his hair. Best to avoid anyone who knew him in life… explanations would be too painful and Draco might bring down the castle with him in his rage and despair.
“He was incredibly fussy. And oh, if you think he’s terrible now, if I ever set him down for more than a moment, he would wail and cry until I picked him up again. He couldn’t stand to be away from me for more than a few seconds.” Harry laughed at that, he could so easily imagine it. Tiny baby Draco throwing a little fit when his mummy didn’t have him close. He just wanted to be loved and cared for, really. She flipped the page and it looked like Draco was just a little older in the picture, Narcissa holding him again. The picture-Draco looked at the camera for a brief moment and gave a smile, open-mouthed and gummy that made his eyes sparkle…
“Oh, yeah,” Harry said with a nod. “I’ve never been able to smell my own magic before though.” McGonagall waved her hand and shook her head a bit.
"He's just said there's not much information on them… they weren't necessarily Marked in the war, but they supported Voldemort. It's really strange. They didn't have anyone go through Hogwarts in the last 15 years, either, so it seems like they weren't much involved at all."
“Before Hogwarts, then. I imagine the castle elves would have protested if you’d tried to make a fry up in the school kitchens.”
“I’m sorry. I won’t take out my wand again.” The dragon continued to stare at Harry, its piercing gaze rooting Harry to the spot.
"A few more, I'll tell you when, don't worry. We're getting off at Opéra, remember? Madeleine is the last one before we get off the train."
A shrill cry left the dragon’s great gaping maw as Harry struggled to hold on and get the collar to expand at the same time. A frantic, wandless
A woman with midnight black hair approached them and kissed her husband’s cheek. “Wonderful to meet you, Draco, I’m Storm.” She was English— Merlin alive, another English magical person. She offered her hand, instead of going in for what seemed to be the customary kisses. Draco smiled, taking her hand.
“Valerie,” Gwen chided softly. “Draco is taking his time with his courtship, that’s nothing to look down upon-”
“What, ‘Silver Prince’?” Draco's face twisted up slightly, as if he were tasting the name itself and trying to decide if he liked it. “I suppose there are worse names…”
“I definitely have the motivation and the magic. It’s just the focus and finding the animal inside me, I suppose.” He caught her gaze. “Do you think I’ll be able to?”
Draco turned to look at Sapphire, and she smiled at him, nodding. “Remy and me, we own a shop together. We get plenty of young witches and wizards coming in for bonding jewelry, but just as many parents coming in for watches or earrings. We have a few muggle pieces, but most of ours are magical. You should come by, see what we have. Perhaps we could give your watch a tune-up. Remy always likes showing how it all works, besides."
Unless Harry was crazy, the dragon’s ear turned more towards him, and he was glancing at Harry more. Was this dragon trying to play coy with him? This was too weird. “What, you like hearing about Malfoy more than you like hearing about Charlie? You’re about as weird as me, you know that?”
When he was finished, he allowed the ink to dry and fed the French owl some nice little meat trimmings he’d summoned from the kitchen. Ink dry and the letter sufficiently sealed, he tied the letter to the owl’s leg, also putting the customary few Sickles into the pouch at its other leg. “When you’re rested, take that back to Mrs. Roots, okay?” The owl cooed and rubbed against Harry’s cheek. Glad he liked him. Owls were incredibly good judges of characters, so it felt pretty good. Still, that Draco had talked about him to his new-found great aunt. And ‘fondly.’ Harry shook his head. Draco was a mysterious and puzzling man, and this just added to that persona.
It looked like the average 'raising an evil cult leader' type of place, a field or two to one side and a forest to the other. (Harry was briefly reminded of a few Muggle horror films.) He popped back next to Draco, who didn't even flinch at his stubborn appearance.
Speaking of surprised, they both turned at the flapping sound of wings to see an owl coming into the dining room. “Wynter, what have you got, there?” The sleek barn owl landed on the armrest of Harry’s chair and Narcissa carefully untied the letter it carried from its leg. Harry smiled and gently pet the owl’s head as Narcissa broke the seal and began to read. It didn’t take long for her face to pale as she looked back up at Harry. “It’s from Draco. He’s in France.”
“It’s perfectly alright, Harry. You two weren’t right for each other. She told me so. She decided she loved you more as a brother.” A small smile formed, and Harry nodded. That sounded a lot more realistic, a better description of their relationship.
The other ghosts of Hogwarts shook their heads and sighed as their newest member let out a frightened sob, his angular face hidden in pale hands. Moaning Myrtle approached him and held him close as he shook like a leaf. Like each of them, he had unfinished business that wouldn’t let him leave this world behind. But unfinished business such as theirs was just as terrifying as death, sometimes even more so. Myrtle rubbed his back, letting Draco hide his face in her neck as he cried.
Luna and I mail frequently, actually, it seems that they’ve been considering it, but want to wait and be sure, same as we do. Though they seem to have been putting much more thought into it together than we seem to have.
“Well, I highly doubt it would be granted. Despite it all, we’ve got some of the best numbers in the department. I suppose when you’re the Boy Who Lived Twice, it’s hard to find something you can’t do.”
"No, bless him," she said, leaning into her husband and sighing sweetly. "Only three, but he got to everything else pretty quickly after that. That's how it usually goes… very slowly, and then all at once." She looked over at Draco. "Ten years? You poor dear."
The diadem. Of course it was in the Room of Requirement-- in the Room of Lost Things. Harry had hidden Snape's potion book there in 6th year, so he knew what to ask for as he paced outside in the hall.
"No, I didn't. He wasn't with Pansy or Blaise, and he didn't go back to St. Mungo's. They've all said they'll owl if he turns up, though."
“I- I’m sorry?” What exactly was one meant to say to realizing they had an entire branch of family they never once knew of? Especially when he’d only come to the cafe expecting a meal. This was insane!
-Harry Potter is as magical as he normally is.... but the Fab 5 are also wizards! :0 the only one who has an idea of who Harry is is Tan (British Desi Wizard Bros)
They Apperated into Hogsmead and Floo'd to Mcgonagall’s office from the village, since she had sent the letter. The older witch had an expression that Lucius couldn't quite place, though he was sure his appearance was part of it. Honestly, he looked like he'd escaped Azkaban and he knew it.
The last time he had been in Paris, it was just after his trial, where he'd been cleared of his charges due to his age and Harry's statement. He'd been in such a dark place for so long that Paris had seemed like heaven in comparison. His mother had taken him shopping and his favorite set of dress robes had resulted from the trip: gorgeous shades of blue in wool and silk. (He'd had them tailored to fit as he grew a bit more and put on some muscle from Auror work.)
You're absolutely right that things aren't fair, and that you (and every other werewolf) would be treated differently in almost any workplace. I'm not sure if you're following Hermione's ongoing fight for creature rights and equality, but she's making headway. She's been writing and revising bills like a fiend. (Honestly I think she would benefit from your ideas. Maybe send her an owl? Or you can just pay her a visit when you return.)
the daring Gryffindor of the two of us. Quite the bit of turnaround, there. Ah, well, if that’s what tickles your fancy, who am I to say no?
It seemed that the dragon didn’t want to be left alone, and Harry was worried that it would injure itself even more trying to prevent Harry from leaving. “Well, if you’re going to make me stay here while you heal, the least you could do is let me sit down.”
Both Remy and Sapphire were silent, processing everything. "...well, my love… It doesn't seem like you were ready. And that's alright, just-"
The dragon was snarling, and breathing fire on every other exhale, and was behaving very strangely, even for an angry dragon. He was twisting in on himself, contorting his body into the strangest positions, and almost looked as though he was in some kind of pain as well as being furious.
“It does get old, I would tell him that,” Remy said, leaning over to kiss Sapphire’s cheek. ”But a pair! Very ambitious, that Zabini. I can’t even handle one wife,” He stage-whispered, grinning when Sapphire smacked his shoulder.
"Yes," Harry murmured, eyes fixed on his other self, watching how terrified he'd been in that moment. "He was trying to stop Sirius from hurting me. Everyone thought that's why he'd broken out of Azkaban, but it was to keep Pettigrew away from me."
“Oh… Oh Draco…” She gingerly perched herself on the edge of the Victorian fainting couch, the tips of her fingers barely brushing her lips. “Stubborn thing— you
There was taunting, threats, but Draco didn't hear them. Potter, Crabbe, Goyle, Voldemort's soul-- it was all too much. When Crabbe cast the spell that set the Edwardian chairs on fire, Draco let out an ear-piercing scream.
I can definitely feel you rolling your eyes at me. It's such a familiar gesture of yours, I'm surprised those gorgeous eyes haven't rolled right out of your head! And I'll definitely be pleased with another photo or 20. I'll endeavor to be less of a tease… it only seems to bite me in the ass in the long run. (But if you'd like to bite me, I wouldn't turn you down, love.)
Yes, I absolutely did enjoy it, and I even sent a photo or two for you, but I do have to say, it felt awfully lonely. Did you wank while you wrote that? Did you pretend that you were the one breaking me down piece by piece? Or maybe you were imagining yourself in my place, trying your best to get fingers up your arse while you sat at your desk, trying to think of all the right words to say to get me
“And that’s okay. You’ll adjust to them just as they will adjust to you. Right now, you’re shiny, new, and the most interesting person in the room.” She patted his cheek. “I promise you, time mellows us all.”
“Enough, Peeves. The boy has been through enough without your vibes at his colouring,” the Baron practically purred, sliding through the wall of the corridor. Peeves went rather quiet, as if disgruntled, and vanished.
“Giving you some room to breathe away from everyone, my love.” She stood in front of him and looked him over. She took a small step forward and cupped his face in her hands. “Are you alright?”
“Oh, hello Harry,” Luna said, when she answered the door. “Ginny is in Moldova, and she won’t be in for tea. Come in, I’ve got a plum tart in the oven.”
Harry recognized Sirius' writing from the letters he'd sent in fourth year, but he was able to guess pretty quickly that James' writing was the darker, slanted font, as if he'd turned the book in order to see better, so he could also write. Before he realized it, he was crying, and the tears were dripping onto the pages, blurring some of the writing. He quickly set the book down, wiping at his face. He… His dad. And Sirius. Back when they were kids.
Both of his cousins gasped and grinned at him. “You look great! Those jeans— your legs look so good!” Valerie clapped a little bit and Bas gave him a little wolf whistle.
“Mum, everyone is- Oh. Are you… Are you two having a moment, here?” October looked between the two of them, his voice softer and more tender than it usually was.
Husband and wife made eye contact, having thought of the same thing. The Dark Lord had been using their son as a pawn against them, to keep them complacent and in line. Now, there was almost nothing the Dark Lord could do to hurt them. What more could they lose, with their heir dead? Lucius stood and composed himself as best he could.
Ron and Hermione bickered over why Lucius and Narcissa would sent Draco to such a school-- Hermione thought it was to avoid the war while Ron was firmly set in his reasoning that the Russians knew some Dark magic that English wizards didn't and Draco was sent to learn. Harry, however, believed that Malfoy had run off to his father after their impromptu duel in the toilets and begged to be sent far away from Potter. At the very least, he didn't have to follow him quite so closely anymore, he could focus more on what Dumbledore needed him to do. He had a meeting with the Headmaster tonight and he needed to focus on whatever Dumbledore needed him to do.
Oh shit— he needed to let Draco know about her offer! He’d forgotten, with the drama of his first full moon, and Narcissa moving in. He’d mention it in his next one to Draco. He needed to be working on his Animagus transformation, actually… “Anything noteworthy, Harry?”
I will take Ginevra's wager, as well, and counter it with a Quaffle Puncher win by seventy points. I’m sending this to you and Luna so there’s two instances of accountability. How much is she placing down?
He sat down at his desk and a piece of parchment appeared in front of him. Quill in-hand, he thought for only a moment or two before he began to write.
"Cause he's a spoiled little brat that's already got you round his finger. All he needs to do is crook it and you're there."
Harry pulled back the curtain and blanched at the half-naked Draco lounging on Euthymia’s table, arms tucked under his pale head, half a dragon sketched out on his back.
Derrick tipped his head back and laughed, shaking his head so his curls bounced a bit. “Not often, but it has been mentioned. After the Triwizard Tournament, I got a few comments. But, ah, my eyes are different, no glasses. And no scar.”
Why couldn’t Harry see that he couldn’t come back? He would wait to write his return letter. He just… Oh, his poor mother.
"Right… well, they won't have much to hope for after this. Everything points this to be a pretty simple raid."
imagine our first Christmas together. It makes my heart hurt. I absolutely want that, Harry love. I want that more than anything. And I want that with you.
“Yes. I think I’d like that,” he told her with a bob of his head, and a weak smile. She pulled him into a little half-side hug and gave him a light squeeze.
“He’s brilliant at potions and charms, I don’t see why he wouldn’t be. And if he got me to do my paperwork every week, he can definitely handle the homework.”
until it was done.” She placed the box on the table. “My own sister tortured me while my son took the Mark, and he was told Lucius and I would be killed if he did not take it. This was also when my son was ordered to kill Dumbledore.” She smoothed her skirt over her lap. “I suspect ee knew my son would not succeed… likely, he wanted us out of the way at that point.”
"Thanks, Nev. I'll come round and see you again soon, alright? And, er, Georgina? Thank you for this, it means a lot."
“We were all young, and foolish. Some of us grew out of it, though.” She turned to the next picture, which showed Andromeda holding the camera, taking a photo in the mirror. She looked to be nearly the same age as Bellatrix was in the previous photo. “Some of us… took a little longer.” The picture was of Andromeda in what looked like a muggle dress. It was…
He and Harry were close as anything, their case stats were the highest on the force, and he’d been the most put-together of his friends for months. Why was it that when his luck ran out, it was always something drastic? No, no, he needed to rephrase. Why was it that when it concerned him, it was always so drastic? This was worse than that dinner they’d had. Worse by a mile, at least. What was he supposed to say. ‘Ta for thinking of me, but I don’t wanna bite you and give you the same curse’? Hell, he was fucked no matter what he did. As he thought of it, Harry was probably on his way over with a team of Aurors to drag him back. He would be obligated
“Ron, you know Draco and I work very well together. You know he balances me out for a lot of things. I’m pretty sure you haven’t thought he was evil or plotting anything for years… Why is this a bad idea?”
“Oh, I guess not. I just wanted to say hello, now that we don’t have an audience. I guess it wasn’t my best first impression, and I wanted to let you know that… I don’t know. You seem alright.”
-magical hijinks while the guys are helping him! Karamo definitely has his work cut out for him boi, they're dealing with a reclusive abused war orphan turned hero.
“Eighteen metres?” Hell, the thing was just as huge as Charlie said. Getting himself more comfortable, Harry took a sip off his pint. “What else can you tell me?”
"Both of my children got their coming of age tokens from me, as did all my other nieces and nephews. And when their children grow to be seventeen, I will give each of them a pocket watch, a pair of earrings, or a pendant and chain. I apologize for being a few years late with yours, Draco."
“Well, I needed time to myself. To get myself together.” She nodded slowly, focused on the next layer of pink polish. She couldn't just ask him if he was a werewolf, as that was just as rude as asking if she was a squib. “Excuse me, I’m going to go put this away.” Draco took the letter and ascended the stairs.
"Perhaps you ought to inform him, then, my dear. If you want him to court you, that is." She sighed dreamily and sat down between the two of them. "My sweet Hudson, gods rest his soul, he courted me right without realizing it. Sure, he didn't know the specific words… but he did it all the same."
“Oh.” An actual squib. The Malfoys had a squib in the family. How could someone, in a world of magic,
Charlie only seemed mildly surprised, looking up at Harry as the nurse set the tray in his lap. “Harry, didn’t you come visit with the rest of the family yesterday?”
The dragon whuffed and then turned its head away from Harry. “So now you’re ignoring me. After everything that I’ve done for you? Figures, doesn’t it?” But as Harry had been speaking, the dragon had been laboriously moving its long body into a position where a fragile, tiny human could sit.
"I'd like to… but they're all dead. That's kind of a problem when trying to get to know people… Besides, my grandparents apparently died before I was born."
I'd like it if you wanted to… push me around a bit, tell me what to do… take care of me. And of course, I want to do that for you. I'd do nearly anything you asked of me, love. If you wanted me on my knees in the shower, sucking you off while you tug on my hair, I'd do it in a heartbeat. If you wanted me on our bed, face down and arse up towards the Floo, waiting for you--
-Tan taking him shopping and getting him into something Draco might like and he and Harry have this moment of "o shit do you want to impress someone SPECIFIC" at this reunion?? let's get you a fitted suit??"
The case held a multitude of gorgeous pieces, from dangling earrings and delicate rings to statement pendants and lux bangles and chains. More than a few sparkling gems were the same shade of Harry's eyes, and that made Draco bite his tongue. Sapphire picked up a lovely bracelet made of silver. “Now, darling, how about this one.”
"Any other time, I'm certain he'd be no less than thrilled," she told him seriously as she picked up her own cup. Harry tapped his fingertips against the fine china teacup and paused, thinking.
Harry didn't know why Charlie was back in the UK, let alone in St. Mungo's version of A&E. It had been a huge shock, seeing Ron's face in his fireplace that afternoon on an urgent Floo call. He’d peeked into the room while the healers were working on Charlie and winced—Charlie would be out of commission for some time, and he’d come out of this with quite a few wicked scars. (It’d only make the git more attractive, at any rate.) Harry had then been promptly yelled at by a healer and escorted back to the waiting area with the rest of the Weasleys.
“I can’t say I’m terribly surprised. He must have written the last one just the morning after.” Harry thought that was the case. This letter seemed… ashamed of being vulnerable, even via letter. Hadn’t Draco trusted him? Well, maybe not so much now, after he was turned? But, well… He had repeated that he missed Harry. He couldn’t have been a completely lost cause. He was just… misguided. That was a pretty good word to describe Draco in general, really. Harry would just have to work a little harder. Nothing he wasn’t already used to. “Harry, I found something while I was at the Manor recently… I thought you might want to see, as well.”
I also received a letter co-written by my mother and my aunt. They’re both happy for us, though are threatening you and I simultaneously to take care of one another. That means that mother adores you.
"...so having Heads of House that are on good terms would promote better attitudes and relationships?" Damn. He had to hand it to her, she'd thought things through.
Yeah, I get it, I’m technically rich too, but I never grew up rich. Even Hermione doesn’t get it the way that Ron does. I mean, both her parents were dentists. Do you know the kind of money dentists make? Because most wizards don’t.
"A pleasure to meet you too, nephew." Well, cousin, but still. "Maman has talked about you for years, I am glad you're finally here with us."
“You look like a foreign businessman. I’m kind of afraid you’ll be pickpocketed or mugged,” Val mentioned from his other side. “Hmm. Shoes first?”
what Harry needed right—It fell. It fell down into the grass. Had it hurt its wing at some point? He needed to get closer to take a look.
“...how hard do you think it would be to nominate someone for this?” He gestured towards the television, which was now just playing the Queer Eye trailer. She raised an eyebrow and set the bowl in the sink, leaning against the counter.
“Ohh, yes. Andromeda. Her daughter Dora was one was well, I remember. I just got a letter from her last week, talking about her little grandson.”
Curled up on the floor, sitting in the moonlight that streamed in from the window, there was a longing pain that Draco couldn’t identify. It was like it came from his core, from his very soul. He— and his wolf— were so crushingly lonely that all he could do was whine and sometimes howl, when he had the energy. There was a rattling sound that had him looking up towards the door. What was it? What was going on? The door creaked open and he watched his Auntie Gwen step into the room. “Oh, darling…” She entered the room and closed the door behind her.
He popped in for a late breakfast at Hermione and Ron's place, a nice place in Derby, with a bookshelf under the stairs, and no cupboard. He Apparated and let himself in with the spare key they'd given him. "Hello? Ron, Hermione?"
Whispers through portraits reached Draco in his hiding place, the Room of Lost Things. Harry Potter had returned to Hogwarts… and Draco knew he was right: war was coming, and it would be here by nightfall.
I understand he may have new doubts of himself due to his afflicted Lycanthropy, but I highly doubt that these are brand new. He loves you so, so why does he seem to believe you two must keep each other at arms’ distance? Please, darling. Help an old woman understand the heartache her little nephew is going through.
[[Enclosed are two more pictures. One is from behind Draco with a bedsheet wrapped haphazardly around him as he stands in front of a large window, looking out over Paris, the lights silhouetting his figure. When it moves it’s simply changing from Draco looking at the camera to look back at the view. His sheet slips down his shoulder before he shrugs it back up. In the second picture, he lets the bedsheet slip entirely, revealing his naked figure, though there isn’t much to be seen in the dim lighting.]]
Harry huffed a bit, because he knew she was right. There were still some idiot people that said Draco was no good, that he couldn't be trusted, even though none of those people had stood up to Voldemort or fought the Death Eaters, or
Harry gave her a nod. “Yeah, I’ve heard of that once or twice. But we haven’t had one in years, right?”
With the deed done, Lucius and Narcissa held each other tightly. They sank to their knees next to the fresh earth and wept.
“That’s what I thought. I remember the wedding announcement in the papers.” She paused to take a sip of her wine, and met his gaze again. “I went to school with a number of Blacks, too.”
Harry gaped as Narcissa gently ran her hands through his hair. "So my-- someone in my family created it?" Did they create it for their own family use? There was so much he didn't know.
“Come on! Put it on! I can’t believe you’re actually not so uptight.” Draco just grumbled to himself as he unbuttoned the Hawaiian print shirt. He wasn’t uptight, why did everyone think that he was? He pulled the shirt on over his head and sighed at the feel of the soft material against his skin. Just in time for Bas to come back with the softer pants. He put those on as well, looking in the… mirror…
"Shit-!" A handful had reached him and tangled their little hands up in his hair before Narcissa froze them once more, and Harry grumbled to himself as he tried to detangle them.
We had dinner with wine, and dessert with whiskey, and I was feeling that tension between us more than usual. I was riding a high from the case, and the alcohol, and I thought I was reading the mood right…
this dragon? “Hey, you alright, there?” He reached out and smoothed the soft underbelly of the dragon, watching it start to relax. “You are a weird one. I’ve never met a dragon like you,” he said quietly.
He got up and stretched, groaning as his back and shoulder popped. He threw a bit of Floo powder onto the small fire in his study. "Hogwarts, headmistress' office."
It was actually fairly relaxing, to take a nice hike through the woods. He’d kept himself busy with work, and most of the time, hiking in a forest reminded him of the war, but this was a bit different. Probably because it was spring, just starting to go into summer. Everything felt more alive, like the world had finally realized everything was okay. Harry stopped at the top of a hill and took a deep breath. It was freeing.
Colin Creevy, as well as nearly a dozen other students were spared a gruesome and too-early death by Draco's assistance. All of them were unsure as to who-- or what-- saved them from a curse or fatal injury, speculating amongst themselves quietly… as the Boy Who Lived snuck out into the forest, under his father's invisibility cloak.
’ Ugh. That wasn’t helpful right now. Maybe just some nice trousers and a nice shirt? He didn’t want to make it seem like he cared
He played with his hands in his lap for a moment. "...I'm not sure if they'll allow Draco back… and I don't want anyone else watching my back on missions… so I'm pretty sure our Auror careers are done. We're using up all our rolled-over vacation days now."
"The meeting with Ron ran a bit longer than I thought, he was busy with another team when I got there. Perks of being Deputy Head, I suppose." He set Draco's wrap and drink on his desk, away from any files. "And Christine sends her regards. That's a strawberry black tea she thought you'd enjoy, by the way."
“Well, there you are. I hear about how we have a new baby cousin, and the minute Tristan and I are back up on our feet, you’re hiding away in your room.” Who- Ah, right, Gwen had told him of her granddaughter that was staying with her.
He thought of bringing a bottle of wine, but decided against it. He checked his pocket watch and approached his fireplace for a bit of Floo powder. He tossed it into the fire and spoke clearly-- "Malfoy Manor"-- before he stepped through. He arrived in the entrance hall just as the grandfather clock rang for seven pm.
“Right. Okay, you set up the pensieve, and I’ll take care of the memory.” He focused hard, bringing the memory to the forefront of his mind, and touched the tip of his wand to his temple, gently extracting the silvery strands of the memory.
Though there was no light, the diadem sparkled high above the mess as if lit with moonlight. Silver-white light illuminated the large blue stone and Harry grinned. Hogwarts made it easy; Hogwarts wanted him to win.
Draco nodded to her, taking her in, as well as the babe she was trying to keep still in his own seat. “Draco Malfoy.”
Harry sighed before finally sitting himself down. "It's Draco." He saw the looks they threw at each other, an entire conversation passing in a second, and a small part of him couldn't help but to feel jealous. “I— He’d skin me alive for telling you this, probably, but it’s all related, so…” He swallowed thickly and kept his gaze firmly on the table. “The last raid we had, the one with the Crowlins? One of them was an unregistered werewolf, and we went out on the night of the full… and Draco was turned.”
Glancing to Draco, Harry saw that most of their attention was on him, as Draco seemed to only be battling one wizard, as opposed to Harry’s three. Right, okay. Easy enough. Draco wouldn’t take long to down his own opponent, then he would help Harry take his down. This still wasn’t one of their hardest fights, they could deal with this. The room seemed to brighten a small amount and both men glanced to the source. The moon. A full moon, tonight? That was odd-
I’ve been starving!” That got a chuckle out of everyone, even Draco. Large bowls of seafood pasta, salad, and buttery garlic bread were passed around the table and served family style, not at all what Draco was used to at dinners with his mother.
Valerie smiled at him and got up to get herself some food. She started chopping an apple for her son and glanced over her shoulder at her cousin. “So, Draco… any plans for the rest of the week?”
“I guess maybe I just like pale things. I did always have a bit of a thing for Malfoy and that blond hair after all.” Harry said, laughing, “It was just a little bit inconvenient at school when I was supposed to be hating him.”
“Well, if you insist…” Draco let her lead him in, and immediately his eye caught on gorgeous emerald jewelry near the front. Sapphire hummed and led him over to the emerald display, opening the case with a flick of her wand.
Harry couldn’t help but to laugh as he shook his head at Ron. “You turned into your mum.” Ron put his fists at his waist and scowled at Harry, doing one of the best ‘Cross Molly’ impressions he’d ever seen. Luckily his wife cut in.
Now it seemed like the dragon was barely listening to him, his wings spreading out on either side of him. He was growling and snarling at Harry and alright, alright. He needed to be careful here, if he didn’t want to end up right next to Charlie in the hospital. This dragon could breathe fire, if the smoke coming out of his nostrils was anything to go by, so he needed to be careful about that.
Draco rose an eyebrow, taking a curious sip before looking like he was trying not to spit it back out. “You don’t happen to have any sugar, by chance, do you?”
Draco’s blood was spreading across the wooden floor, and Harry had a brief flashback to their ill-fated duel in the bathrooms in sixth year. Draco was going grey quickly and Harry was panicking.
“Well, at first he gave me a very nice pair of black shoes, but I didn’t quite realize that was what he was trying to say, so after the shoes, he got me a silver necklace, with a pendant of a black shoe.” Harry tossed his head back and laughed, because that was adorable, and totally something a younger Arthur would do. Completely on-brand.
Baby Draco was unhappy to be in his foamy bubbly bath water, sweet little face pink from the warm water and the fit he’d thrown before his bath. Harry couldn’t help but smile. “Not even when he was little?”
Draco was still silent. Harry watched him walk slowly round the clearing, letting him take some time, waiting for him to feel ready to talk.
this family? It was very overwhelming— six adults talking to him at once, and two of them holding a child.
“Hold on a moment,” he asked Narcissa, getting up and untying the letter from the huge owl’s leg giving him a few treats for his hard work. He recognized the small neat scrawl of his last name on the outside and broke the wax seal. “It’s from Draco!”
Ah, though Draco was back to being rather abrasive and cold in his letters… he still kept the shirt. It made Harry smile. He’d taken a gamble, sending his sleep shirt, but it had apparently been worth it. Maybe that was what he needed to be doing. He needed to just keep being sweet and warm to Draco, and he’d be able to chip away at his gruff exterior. He had managed a fair amount already in their years as partners, but it seemed that Draco threw all his walls up again once he left.
It felt like all of Draco’s thoughts came to a screeching stop. “...Pardon?” Two squibs in the family, and so close to his own age? He felt his chest tighten. “I… I’m sorry, I didn’t know-”
A few of the older cousins shared a look. Hm, they seemed to pick up that he was single but definitely not happy about it. How very interesting. Brigitte raised an eyebrow at him. “Well, I guess you don’t have to join. It’s a fake club after all. But I’m a single mom barely out of my teens, Valerie is divorced, Gisele doesn’t much care, and Bas is a Disaster Bi.”
He felt a bit bad about the Animagus training, because he’d tried to get ahead and had accidentally swallowed the leaf Neville had given him. It was bitter and made him salivate a lot, and he’d nearly choked on the thing… he’d go ask Neville for another before his lesson with McGonagall. He’d make sure to be a lot more careful with this one, too. Neville probably wouldn’t be too happy to have to be giving him another one. Georgina definitely wouldn’t be pleased, giving up another leaf. He hoped it would only be the one more.
The last thing he had packed was a Ministry-issued automatic resizing collar, so any beast could be safely tagged and identified, large or small. Cloak and glasses secure, he mounted his Firebolt up on the roof and kicked off, heading in the general direction of Salisbury, hoping he'd find the dragon before the dragon found him.
Though I do appreciate your gift. I’ve been sleeping with it every night since I got it. New moon is tomorrow night, and I’m actually upset. I can’t smell it nearly as well.
Tapping the quill to his tongue briefly, Draco set the letter aside to dry. Now for his letter to Harry…
It’s not just to keep myself busy. It’s for the independence it gives. And, yes, making up for my past sins. What I did in the war is unforgivable, but doing the work we do can at least help me start to make up for it all. And also… I don’t want to just depend on house elves, and mother, and the family vault, all the time. I’ve got to learn to lean on myself.
Whenever Draco thought about it too long, the windows nearby would shake and an anguished wail would bubble up from his chest, rattling the tiles of the bathroom. He eventually calmed himself each time with a shake of his head and a wry smile. He was worse than Myrtle, sometimes, the poor girl.
“Draco, I’ve come to rescue you,” she whispered, giving his shoulder a little squeeze. “Boys, I’m afraid our Draco has a lot more people to meet, so if you’ll excuse me.” And she was leading him away… away from most all the other people, into another room.
“Luna, you definitely weren’t there to see it happen— it was on our last raid, there were no civilians—“
“Certainly not. We were actually arranged, when we were very young, but… My interests don’t lie in that direction.” Neither of them seemed surprised, but then again, their own son had married a man.
“I’ve heard tales, of course, of all the legendary skipped meals between the both of you.” Draco Malfoy, that dirty little
when a dragon was curled on its side, but he didn’t know how to get there. “It looks like I’m going to have to climb a bit. If you could not hurt me while I do this, that would be great.” He took a deep breath and began to gingerly heave himself up onto one of the dragon’s legs, careful to avoid its wing. He paused for a moment, but the dragon seemed fine—one eye was closed and the other was watching Harry with a lazy interest.
felt like another day at the office, with the wit and snark between them. It… gave Harry a great idea.
Interest piqued, he carefully broke the seal and then opened the smaller envelope inside, revealing a handwritten letter, not the usual Ministry memo.
“Are you sure?” When there was no reply from Draco, Harry pressed further, unable to restrain his curiosity. “Why were you a dragon? How long have you been able to transform?”
Thank you for your concern, however I am capable of protecting myself. You don’t always need to be a Savior. I should have seen it coming a mile off, but I didn’t, so now I’m paying for it. And we only have the best case statistics because half the time you’re put on cases that would otherwise be suicide attempts, but alas, nothing is capable of stopping a stubborn Boy Who Lived ten
“Hey Elise, is he in the back? Drawing for someone?” Valerie walked towards the back of the shop, and Draco followed her. Naturally, the buzzing got louder as he approached, and he was just a little entranced. “This is our cousin Draco, from England, by the way. Bas and I are taking him out for the day.”
“Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy,” Minerva began, then paused, her lips pursed. “Lucius. Narcissa. Follow me, and quickly.”
"Well, he has right to be so," Hermione huffed. "I don't expect you to have read any of the legislation, Harry, it's
The medi-witch began murmuring healing spells, waving her wand over the boy's chest and torso. She was on the verge of tears, remembering the times he'd visited her for a fever or Quidditch accident. The slashes across pale skin slowly healed, the blood removed from his shirt in the same actions. Now, it looked as if he were merely sleeping. Poppy covered her mouth with her hand, a shaking breath rattling through her as she began to cry.
“That’s good, I’m glad. Now, let’s get you a room, shall we? We’ll get your things from that dreadful hotel in the morning.”
“I believe we are on a first name basis, now, Harry. Unless you’d like me to call you ‘Mr. Potter’ like you’re still in school.” She leaned down and kissed his cheek. “This is a good thing we have, you and I.”
Ron frowned, just before taking a bite of sausage. “Court him? Like all the old traditions, getting specific gifts and being all stiff and proper court him?”
Draco couldn't help a smile at the letter, already beginning to reread it before he was shaken from his thoughts.
Narcissa smiled at him. “It’s really quite simple. You’ve mostly just got to decide you’re going to do what you need to without a care towards what anyone else has got to say.”
Harry knew that the nurse was well-meaning, but he was so tired of the hero-worshipping. He knew that it was easier to simply do what was being asked, rather than fight against their wishes.
They got the cup of Hufflepuff from Bellatrix's vault at Gringotts-- a feat only pulled off by polyjuice and the Imperius curse. They gained the cup but again lost the sword of Gryffindor.
be able to describe, really. But I want to learn more about it. With you. Maybe I can even experiment with the Wolfsbane to make it sweeter. Though I’d have to wonder at the after-effects of that… Remind me to test that out later.
“Are you okay?” Harry asked, close enough now to tell that the dragon was indeed a he. The dragon ignored him, and continued trying to push his large snout into the ground. Harry continued to observe, fascinated by this strange behaviour. Dragons normally didn’t let humans approach them without keeping a close eye on them, and he’d never seen one completely ignore the presence of a human.
“Hey, Alfred,” Neville said with a laugh. “How are we today, buddy?” The plant grumbled a bit, shifting in the pot a bit, absolutely responding to Neville, seemingly talking about his day. Harry wondered if Neville could
“It’s my pleasure, Draco, really,” she assured him, pulling him into a hug similar to the one he received from Sapphire earlier. “Now, off to bed with you.”
He called out to Malfoy, something accusatory about the locket and Katie Bell, and quickly dodged a stinging hex as Malfoy went from broken to defensive in the blink of an eye. They duel, hiding behind rows of toilet stalls and sinks, some wordless hexes, some Dark spells. An Unforgivable was on the tip of Malfoy's tongue when Harry let loose a loud cry of “Sectumsempra!” The Prince's book had said ‘only for enemies’, and Draco was, in this moment, Harry's greatest enemy.
His eyes widened at seeing the pendant. “Oh, no, I couldn’t-” A pear-shape emerald sat comfortably beside yellow and rose gold leaves, with delicate white gold vines connecting them to each other and the chain. At first glance, there was a serpent-like dragon hidden in the pattern.
Draco couldn’t help to roll his eyes. “Chosen Git, more like.” That had Derrick chuckling into his wine glass, making eye contact with Draco. “Rushing off into danger, flirting with baristas… not doing all his research. Really, he’s an idiot.”
Valerie laughed, shaking her head. “Draco, don’t you have kids? When they’re in a good mood, they think everything is funny.”
Sirius had run away to. In his mind, it was less a physical place and more the idea of warmth, love, and safety. "...I don't know. I'm sure they had one… maybe there's still a house, but I don't know where it is."
[[a smaller letter seems to bloom from the paper, once Draco has finished the particularly smutty request. It is labeled
“Hey… I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you, I just needed to get the tag on you”— He tried to rub the dragon’s belly, to soothe him, but was surprised as the beast seemed to flinch away from his touch.
After a while, it felt like N.E.W.T. studying with Hermione, and he needed to take a break. Harry sat back in his chair and groaned loudly, the simple action already making him feel better. Did he know anyone that was an animagus? Certainly they would be able to help him figure this all… Of course! He was so stupid!
Hello again, love. Hope you enjoyed yourself there, and that I didn’t overdo anything. Let me know if I overstepped any boundaries.
Harry frowned, confused. "Fighting? No, um-- alright, long story short, he was hurt in a raid last night and escaped St. Mungo's this morning. I can't find him anywhere and I've already been to the Manor and to Pansy's. His mother and I are worried so… if you see him, owl me or Narcissa, will you?"
If I were to come back I wouldn’t be able to keep my job. My nerves will be shot the closer the moon gets just thinking about it, the day and night of the full moon will be out completely, including the day after. But Merlin do I want to come home.
"We-- Draco and I haven't talked about anything like this… I haven't asked him, or said anything… I was afraid it might scare him off, and I'd get a letter saying that he's left France and will never come home again."
The diadem was gone. As was the cup, Ron and Hermione had destroyed it with a basilisk fang in the Chamber of Secrets. The wards had fallen. Death Eaters were everywhere.
“There have been a few cases over the centuries, as you can imagine. A core specialist healer at St. Mungo’s could better answer any practical core questions, if you become concerned with your own. There
Narcissa nodded, waving her hand. "Mimsy, if you would- Thank you." A house elf appeared with a tray of tea and biscuits, setting it down before bowing to Narcissa and snapping itself away. "It is possible that Draco went to either of the two of them. He trusts them entirely."
"Mmm, you're very comfortable, I'll have you know. Best nap I've had in a long time, thanks." He gently patted and rubbed the dragon's flank, feeling the smooth scales and warm leathery hide under his palm. The dragon let out a crooning sound and a little wiggle rippled down the length of its body. It seemed… pleased?
Good. Now you can let your hand start to wrap around it. But go slow. Not too fast, now. Oh, I can imagine your face. Wanna know what makes it even better? Get that new toy of yours, and use your magic to get it going. Now really start pumping your shaft. That feels good, doesn’t it? You like that. You’re going to come any second now. Go on, then. Do it. Cum for me.
She glanced back at the body and closed her eyes, leaning against Albus’ great desk. “We-- what do we tell the students? The staff? Severus? The boy's parents?” Her tone had taken on a steely quality. The Malfoys would not be so easily Obliviated.
He found himself exiting Luna's Floo and entering in through the Burrow's. He wondered if it was just Molly and Arthur in the house. He didn't need anyone else getting nosy. Molly’s voice came from round the corner. “Yes? Who is it?”
“Don’t I know it,” Charlie laughed, wincing after a moment. Still in pain then. “You leaving me already?”
“I haven’t seen him around for a while actually… I wonder if he’s on holiday? I hope he’s okay…” Harry continued as he walked over to the dragon, now focused far more on the dragon’s reactions than on what he was saying.
On other subjects, yes, I have been keeping a close eye. I don’t suppose any of the sudden funding her programs have received came from the Gringotts accounts of any particular Boy Wonders, did they? One might consider that a conflict of interests, love. Though I am impressed by the work Granger is doing. I’ve sent along a couple books that may help her in her own quest.
Pity that you don't want the greater Paris area to know how I'd torture your sweet arse for hours with my tongue and fingers. I suppose you're a more private man than I thought. I'll work on the charm so my voice will stick to the parchment. But in the meantime…
on his part.” Devin winked at his husband and two spots of pink blush appeared on Gabriels cheeks. Did— was that a sex joke?
Harry blushed, but didn't mean to. (Blaise was a handsome man, sue him.) "It's fine. Um, you wouldn't happen to have Draco hidden away in there, would you?"
Though Harry’s letter was a bit brash and blunt in places… it was obvious that he cared for Draco and his comfort, as well as his general safety. Draco did have to admit that it was rather sweet, even if he did completely and blatantly ignore Draco’s attempts to get him to leave him alone. Couldn’t he see that it would be better for everyone involved if Draco was left to wallow by himself? Still, that Harry would consider such a difficult level of magic for Draco’s sake… Only in another life, it seemed.
“I didn't mean what I said, either. About you letting him get branded. I know you didn’t want that for him, Mrs. Malfoy.”
Harry couldn't hear what Snape was saying to Dumbledore. He didn't know if the Headmaster had used a Mufleato on him as well. He was helpless to save his mentor, his friend-- Then Snape pulled his wand on the old man and cast the curse.
That had been Euthymia’s first thought when Draco Malfoy entered her shop in mid-August of that same year, requesting simple black-and-white narcissus flowers over the pink scar that had once been the Mark.
Harry's pendant would need a ruby, for sure. Looking around the shop, Draco found the jewelry of rubies. Perfect. Now… Gold would certainly fit him best. Gold for his golden boy. It would look so lovely against Harry's darker skin, and of course Draco would have to touch the metal, to be able to put it on Harry for the ceremony. Staring at the pendant that most caught his eye, he smiled. It wasn’t overly large, or adorned with much, simply a ruby pendant held in a gold setting, on a thin gold chain. It was perfectly tear-drop shaped and perfectly cut, for the maximum amount of sparkle. Draco could imagine kissing the jewel as it hung in the hollow of Harry's throat, or lower down, against his chest. He could imagine mornings in bed, playing with the chain around Harry's neck as he waited for him to wake up.
“Single use tickets, okay? You don’t have to keep them once you’ve gone through.” And she showed him where to put his ticket so the turnstiles would let him through.
"Sebastien Frey? Pardon me— I am October Roots." Definitely a wizarding name, if Draco ever heard one… but not Black. The waiter offered his hand for Draco to shake. Draco shook his hand, nodding his head.
“Might try heading out to the fields near the forest tomorrow,” Doonan said, that twinkle back in his beady eyes. “He’s got to be hiding, eh? Eighteen metres from snout to tail and hasn't mastered the change yet.”
“Oh, um, it’s from Prof— Headmistress McGonagall. She’s asking if I know any candidates for assistant teaching positions, that would eventually become professors in a year or so.” He paused, watching for her reaction. “I’m thinking of Draco and I possibly putting up our names for it.”
“Oh, Harry darling…” At least she was smiling? That had to count for something. “Draco was right about one thing, I’ll tell you that,” she said like this was all some great joke. “You are absolutely oblivious.”
When the dragon didn’t respond, due to it being a dragon and not an actual conversation partner, Harry continued.
The dragon looked back at Harry and lowered its head down towards him. Great, now he’d offended him, and he was going to get eaten. The dragon used its nose and mouth to nudge at Harry, almost
So, you folks don't want to see our little family tree we have to devise for this... It's a bit of a doozy, but it was fun to make, I'll say that much! And so you lot are aware, we are NOT adhering to the movie!werewolves, those shitty ass CGI fuckers. Draco is like a real wolf. He big pupper.
Harry nodded. “Right, right…” Looking over the letter again, he sighed. “I still shouldn’t go try to find him, should I?”
She leaned back in her seat and Harry ate some more of his food just to have something to do. “Draco, ever since he was a boy, has always been incredibly nervous. Even shy, sometimes.” She must have seen something on his face because her smile broadened. “Surprising, is it? He’s gotten incredibly good at hiding, since he’s grown up.”
Narcissa paused only briefly after 20 minutes to reread the letter, which only fired her up again. Oh, at least she switched topics. He didn’t think she’d be able to keep going just on the one subject. Now she was talking about how stubborn and pigheaded Draco was and how he had a sort of heroic fantasy of being a martyr. He would’ve laughed to hear that one.
"Oh just come with us, sit and watch the people go by, have some wine. Humor me, Draco." Remy came out at that moment, removing his protective glasses. He beamed, seeing the younger man in his show room.
Regardless of which option you vote for, it will be Ginny and Ron (and also kinda Hermione) who nominate him for the Fab 5
“Well, probably an adult leaf.” Neville led him towards a few pots at the back. “Hey there. How we doing today?”
I grinned and giggled like a third year when you mentioned I'd be a Potter-Malfoy. I really do quite like the sound of it.
“Such a sweet boy, you. We’ll give Bas a call, see if he’s busy, shall we? Gives me some time with my Tristan,” she mused, heading out of his room. Draco looked down at his lap. Did he really seem so uptight and stuffy? He thought he'd loosened a fair amount in recent years.
“Mrs. Malfoy? I was wondering if you’d let me invite you to tea tomorrow, at Grimmauld Place? I sort of can’t go in to work without a partner, and I’ll probably be lonely and bored out of my mind without your son around to antagonize me.”
“That does sound amazing,” he told him, and before he knew it, he was being dragged along to lunch with the two of them. The three of them sat outside a little café, facing out towards the street. Remy ordered them each a sandwich and wine, though Draco protested slightly. He wasn't very hungry… until the gorgeous ham and butter baguette was set in front of him with a crisp white wine. Sniffing the wine, he smiled at realizing that it wasn’t nearly so overpowering as it had been a couple weeks ago. “Pinot gris?”
Harry took a few steps towards the dragon, which took only one step back, wings spread to look big and menacing. It was growling, its sharp teeth on full display and smoke tendrils rising from its nose. It was textbook defensive behavior… but Harry had to get the collar on.
Thank you to everyone who suggested ghostly names for Draco, as I finally got to use them in this chapter.
Wednesday morning came far too soon, and Draco took his wolfsbane potion when he awoke. He felt it, like he felt someone watching him, or like he felt his own magic. He felt the shift clawing at him. It felt like the wolf was lurking right under the surface of his skin, and it just added to his sense of unease.
I just reread over part of your letter again, do you have any plans for Teddy? I know you’ve for the most part been having Aunt Andromeda raise him, but he does know you’re his godfather, yes? Have you planned on acting upon that, at all? Does he shift? I know he’s only half wolf, but I had thought that the Metamorphmagus genes cancelled out any and all wolf traits.
