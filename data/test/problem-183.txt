I sent a silent thank-you to Blaise. "Thanks, but I think you two should probably have a day to catch up. He's always with Nev and you're always with me. Have a great day, though."
If any of you were confused, I aged Teddy up a fair bit. So, he’s 16, three years younger than Harry.
“Fucking you?” Weasley suggests. I shrug my shoulders but don’t deny it.
Draco spotted James sitting on the bottom of the stairs, observing the two wizards having their argument.
”Oh hey, Harry. What’s up?” Neville asks.
”You.” I blush. It’s because of what I called him. He presses his lips to my neck, before sucking a mark onto me. “So hot. You’re so hot.” Before I can reply, there’s a quick knock at my door.
Not only that. Draco has had to buy a bloody bed, litter tray, and a heaping of toys for James. Not that the ungrateful bastard used them. James slept on Draco’s bed and always went to the toilet outside. Even the toys seemed to get abandoned after a couple hours.
The following day, I find myself in an adult shop. It takes me a while to build up the courage to go in - what makes it worse is that the person who‘s working it is also a member of the gang.
“Alright,” Draco smiled, “but you can’t cross this line,” he said, drawing an imaginary line across the surface. “This is a food prep area. Also I don’t want to be eating your hairs.”
Later I would realise how wrong I was.
Which is how I felt.
“Fuck, baby.” Is all Draco says before I feel him release deep into me, ropes of cum flooding my insides. He waits a second, both of our heavy breathing loud in the now quiet room, before slipping out of me. I feel his cum dripping out of me but I let my ass fall onto the bed. Draco presses his lips to my lower back before turning my over and scooping me into his arms. “Well done baby. I’m so proud of you.” I keen again at the praise, pressing my head into his sweaty chest.
"Potter!" Draco's arm's caught him quickly before pulling the man inside his home.
"Colour?" I asked, as I brought a hand up to his face to run my thumb along his lower lip, softly gesturing where I wanted to kiss him.
”Mhmm. Well.” He quickly pulls my boxers down and moves the packed out of the way, revealing my clit. “Looks like you’re just hard, baby. Who knew you got off so much just from sucking dick? We’ll definitely have to do that more often.” He rubs it inbetween his fingers. It had grown thanks to my testosterone, and even though I knew it was nothing like what he had, something about his actions made my heart soar.
“Draco, maybe down try phone sex while I’m at my godson’s.”
“My name. Draco. Bit awkward to keep going off of surnames after I fingered you in that alley.”
”Don’t think that will get you out of punishment. Remember what I said? If I saw you back here again?” I nod. “I need your words, baby.”
"Ugh, it's so gross," Melissa groaned, fanning cool air to her face with her hands. Draco chuckled in reply. In the past month, the weather had been fairly cool, but had become a lot hotter within just a week, heatwave temperatures. Not a single person seemed to be enjoying the typical June weather, though.
Unfortunately, when I woke later, both women had already left, as well as Draco. I meandered downstairs, a yawn slipping from my mouth, and headed into the kitchen, where my clothes were folded on the side with a note placed on top.
“That was before I saw you go ‘Griffin King’ on his ass.” I roll my eyes with a smile before leaving the kitchen. I see Neville and Blaise by the front door, sharing an
”Excuse us for simply being worried that you haven’t been in a relationship for years.” Astoria throws an arm around my shoulder, leading me into the kitchen so Draco can chat with his mother. She plops herself down onto a stool and I stand opposite her. “So.” She begins, a small glint in her eye. “Have you two had sex yet?” She asks, no filter whatsoever. My eyes widen.
My fear is pointless, however, when I let my breath go in a breathy moan as his fingers deftly brush my throbbing clit. He dips into me, swiping the juices and using them to lube up his fingers before painfully slowly stroking my clit. I break the kiss, leaning my forehead on his chest as I let out moan after moan thanks to his teasing. My fingers thread through his hair, pulling at the blond locks. I feel him kissing along my neck, sucking a mark into the tan skin. The sensations build up inside me, and he senses I’m close. As the warmth builds up in the bottom of my stomach, he strokes me faster, bringing me to completion in no time.
"Well I can start!"
"Probably just a rogue meow, as is with all cats I've ever known."
“Draco.”
"A robe." He wanted to sound displeased, but really he couldn't get over how soft the material felt.
Draco chuckled softly, folding the robe before looking at his friend softly.
“I suppose each cat has a different personality, just like people do,” she smiled in return, before sipping at her drink. “Would you be sad to see him go?”
He passed a small picket fence and smiled to himself a little when it rang a bell in his memory. He paused, pacing backwards to the fence again. He looked to the gate, to the small cottage which lay twenty or so metres within the confines, and back to the gate.
”I’m sorry I doubted you. Want me to do it?” I nodded, and explained briefly how to injection it. “You sure you trust me?”
"Yeah, don't want Blaise to feel like a third wheel, right?"
I showered, scrubbing as hard as I could as my skin, forcing myself to wash out myself even though touching the area reminded me of it all.
”Not a word, alright.”
“No,” was all he said before slamming it shut again.
From where he now lay against me, I could feel him pressing against the zipper of his trousers. I wrapped my arms around his neck and ground myself against him, our moans joining together in the otherwise silence of the room. He finished undressing me, tossing my boxers away from us, before leaning down to meet my crotch.
I woke the next day feeling tired. I had barely slept at all, waken up by nightmares every time I managed to get back to sleep. I kept the turtleneck on, adding a pair of black jeans and my leather jacket so I didn't look like how I felt.
"Nuh-uh." She cut him off. "You've been sneaking glances at him every chance you could get, don't think I wouldn't notice. Your little smile when you realised he was looking back at you too."
“Yeah. Sirius was always one for dramatics.” I chuckled. “That’s why your father liked him so much.” I’d been told stories of the two men. Blind idiots in love is what my mother patently called them. “Anyway. I know you’re only 16, and you have your whole life ahead of you, but I don’t want this to be forced on you. I want you to have the choice.” He gives me a confused look. “Currently, I have no heir, so to speak. I may never have one. Because of this, as my godson, I want to ask you if you would like to be my heir.” Teddy is silent, staring at me in disbelief. “You don’t have to answer now. And even if you don’t want to be heir, the Griffins will always accept you as a member. But if something were to happen to me, would you be willing to take my place?”
"'Ave 'im!" Another shouted. A man close to the front started running to my with a small knife in his hand, but I dodged the blow before sending a sharp jab to his stomach, and then a right hook to his jaw, sending him out cold.
"Sounds great. I'd love to come. What's the dress code?"
"Where've you come from?" He softly asked the thing, locking the door behind the creature before crouching down to see it. In the soft lights of the cafe, Draco could better see the cat. It's fur was jet black, but there was a small scar on the top of its head, most likely from a fight a long time ago, despite the fact that the cat itself was clearly not that old.
When Draco woke the next morning, Harry was curled up into his side, an arm around his waist, already awake. Draco reached a hand over and ran it through Harry's hair as he had every morning for the past few months. Harry hummed contently, leaning into the hand out of instinct.
The kitten stared at it for a moment, before curling up in the space with a small, kitten yawn.
”What?” I ask quietly, acting innocent, when he doesn’t speak immediately. He just shakes his head and sighs angrily. “You’re mad? I run a gang. Of course I’m going to do illegal shit. Thought you knew that?” He grabs my wrists and pins them above my head, trapping me between him and the wall.
Draco replayed the memories in his mind wondering when and how it had all happened. How had Harry slipped into his life as seamlessly as he did? When did Draco start noticing the rosy blush on Harry's tanned skin every time they locked eyes? How had Draco gone so long without this feeling of content in his life?
“I’m not going to sleep with you, Malfoy.” The blue haired one grumbles. I stop myself from laughing.
James meowed proudly at this, preening under the attention he was getting.
”Yes. He mentioned on Wednesday something about joining. Andromeda was very much against the idea, muttering about your ‘recruitment drive’ on Monday.”
”When you’re about to
”Oh, of course. Because you do it in the... I reckon that would be way more painful.”
I was broken. That's all there was to it. How on earth would Draco ever want me now, when I can't even be around friends?
So far, Astoria has learned that I’m half Draco’s age and am the leader of a gang that runs drugs as well as a handful of other crimes. I’m not too sure of her opinion of me.
James stared at Draco for a second or so, before closing and opening his eyes slowly.
“Yes, sir.”
"But... never mind."
"So why are you here?"
"I'm sorry, Officer Malfoy, I'm not-"
Later that evening, after a meal unadmittedly lovingly made by Draco, he stepped out of the bathroom to see Harry laying in the bed, reading. Harry didn't notice him for a couple seconds and Draco took the time to admire how profoundly normal the ordeal seemed to him; how well Harry seemed to fit in his life.
"You look like you feel guilty, so if you're an animagus you're doing an awful job," Draco chuckled, picking up the clock and reparo-ing it without a second thought.
“I think cats are smarter than they let on.” She replied, leaning in a little as if it were a secret. “So tell me, how did you come to own a coffee shop?”
I glance in my rear view mirror, seeing the blue lights have gone, and smile. I don’t lower my speed, but as I turn a corner I see the police car parked across the road, lights blaring, waiting for me. Both police officers have exited the car and are standing with shit eating grins on their faces. I panic, slamming on the breaks before I crash into them. I get out as one walks over.
”Be kind on him, Cissy. He’s doing well for himself. I’m glad Scorpius lives with you.” Astoria smiles to him. “Speaking of, where is our son?” She looks to where I am, and tilts her head slightly in confusion. “Not to sound rude, but you aren’t Scorpius.”
“Tyler Lee Joseph.” I lie again.
"Mm, baby. You're so tight. Fuck, Princess, this is amazing." He moaned as he pounded in and out of me sloppily. "I bet this is your first time, isn't it? My Princess is still a virgin for me. That's so hot. I'm the first guy to breed you, huh?" I was silent. Tears were coming out of my eyes faster than I could produce them. Dropping onto the floor every second, each time a little of my dignity disappearing into the asphalt with them.
"We've got a 261, on our way back to station. 10-45," she glanced at me in the rear view mirror, "A, generally. Possibly B. ETA 5 minutes, we'll need forensics ready." As soon as we arrived I was bundled into the station and met by a doctor with a clipboard. I was then lead into a small, private examination room containing a bed with stirrups. I was left alone to change into a horrible gown. I could now see the mess in my underwear, and the bruises all over me. Flashes in my head of his hands grabbing my wrists had me shaking again.
”You don’t care when I smoke weed but when I start taking medicine, you do?”
"That was amazing, we'll have to do this again sometime," he winked, before heading back down the alley.
”This is a punishment.” He reminds me. I take a deep breath before lying on his lap, my crotch pressed against his leg. His hand moves over my asscheeks gently, rubbing the smooth skin. “Tell me why you are being punished.” His voice is deep with authority and I shiver.
"Hey, babe." I said quietly. He looked at me from where he sat huddled in bedsheets, eyes wide.
The blush on my face told the table otherwise.
"James really reminds me of someone..." Neville thought aloud as the kitten jumped up onto the arm of Draco's sofa.
“19.” The truth this time. Something crosses Blondie’s face, almost like relief. I shake it off.
"Which time?" Draco smiled.
"Because I ran away from home and hid as a kitten? And now you know who I am. So now I have to go home before the reporters find me."
"He's in a holding cell. Once they've processed his DNA, we'll hear back from the labs. If it's a match, they can get him into questioning. He'll probably take it to court, but we expect that." Blaise finally said once he pulled up outside my home.
”Says the guy who started calling me daddy.”
“You don’t have to join now, if that’s what you mean. You'd have to join if you take over. But the option is there. You can join whenever, and/or be my heir, or neither. It’s up to you.”
“Longbottom.” I speak, authority in my voice. He turns to face me, at the top of the stairs by now, looking worried with what I have to say. I soften my tone. “Stay safe.” I say. He blushes further, if possible, and the two men disappear into his room. I’m about to turn back to Blondie when a female voice distracts me.
“He’s the best distraction I’ve ever tasted, I’ll tell you that.” Scorp slips his arm around Teddy’s waist, pressing a kiss to the blushing boy’s face.
“This kitten? Was named Harry, dropped of at an adoption shelter, adopted by you and went missing in the space of a year?”
Coffee machine on and last night's dishes put away, Draco thought he was in for a peaceful morning when a tapping at his window proved him wrong.
”I like your cock pounding into me, daddy. I love your big cock in my ass.” He groans at my answer, somehow thrusting deeper into me.
"What's that supposed to mean?"
"Fuck you!" I spat. "Draco does love me! More than anyone will ever love you!" I shouted. Attention would attract people, and they would help me. He slammed his spare hand against my mouth.
"Of course." He wished farewell and then hung up. I breathed a sigh of relief.
As I’m driving down the long stretch of road, I check the time and see I’m behind schedule. If I was late, it was to be assumed something had gone wrong and the others would be out looking for me. I had to get back on time before they started crawling the streets in search for me. The police were already getting pissy with us. I press down harder on the throttle, going up a couple gears and speeding down the road at 90. I turn my music up and focus on getting back quickly.
i know i know, a second chapter already. i have no self control with new fics.
Draco waited a couple minutes after Harry had finally settled.
"Harry," she started. I looked at her, mouth full of cereal. "You know if anything were to happen, you can always talk to me. We've been friends since high school, and we've saved each other's asses countless times. I'll always be here for you, you know that, right?" I nodded, swallowing. "Ok." And with that, she left the room.
After sitting down on the sofa, he glances at me. He pats his thighs and I go to straddle him, but he places a hand on my chest and pushes me back.
back with another update! very close to the end now, hope you enjoy xx
Hope you enjoyed, thank you for reading and for all your support! Xx
“If you dye to too much too quickly, it’ll ruin your hair and you’ll have to pretty much shave it off. And then you won’t have any hair to colour.” He sighs, but gives in.
As he did, the cat jumped up on the sofa next to him, giving him and the TV a strange look.
"Harry?" Oh god, I wanted to take him in my arms and tell him how I felt. But I didn't know how he'd react. "This isn't what you think it is," I cleared up. "I didn't come here to end our relationship. Because I can tell that's what you're thinking."
"Harry turned back to himself when he accidentally scratched me, but I kept my word. Harry's here because he wants to be."
As Draco hauls me into the back of his car, however, I get the feeling it won’t be.
”Harry, I’m sorry. I promise I was going to tell you eventually. I didn’t want to scare you off or weird you out.”
He walked the short distance to the door just to the right of his cafe, heading up the stairs once inside and into his small, two storey house above the cafe.
He contemplated using the array of expensive-looking soaps and whatnot but decided that he'd rather not face Draco's wrath after wasting such bougie products. Instead, he let himself slip a little further under the water as his body soaked up the warmth, grateful for this recovery from the harsh winter night still raging outside.
”She said that that’s fine. She’ll take responsibility for anything until they are. She just... she doesn’t want a gang member living in her house.” She adds the last part in a whisper. Luna had gone through something similar. After she began dating Ginny in college, she joined the gang but stayed living at home, planning to move here when college finished. Her father had found out, however, seeing the tattoo on her collar bone peeking out under a shirt, and kicked her out the following day.
”Of course. They’re fantastic.”Silence. Slowly, hesitantly, Teddy leans up and connects their lips. Scorpius replies gently, cupping my godson’s face. “You good?” He whispers as he pulls away. At this, I grab Draco’s arm and pull us out of sight. He lifts his eyebrows at me .
“To see you. Is it not obvious?” She replied with an attitude as usual, stopping stroking James to speak with Draco.
“It’s a shame Harry’s still with Ginny,” Blaise joked, teasing Draco.
As softly as I could, I pressed my lips to his knuckle, letting all my love for him pour out through the kiss.
"Living with
Over the next few days, with some intense medicine and unwavering comfort from my boyfriend, I slowly got better. Draco, by some miracle, had stayed fit as a fiddle, although he claimed that it wasn't because he'd raised a kid and had had every cold out there, and even some that hadn't been invented yet.
”Harry, we want to ask you about the details of last night, preferably what events occurred after the party you were attending had caesed.” The woman speaks, her voice clear.
He sat on the floor, crossing his legs like he would as a child, and called the cat to him.
"Hello, dears!" Molly greeted us all with warm, motherly hugs. "Oh Ronald, your hair is a mess!" She tutted, sorting out the ginger mop in his head. "Hermione, dear. How are you?" She looked to me with a wide smile. "Harry! Oh, it's been too long since I saw you!" She hugged me close to her, a familial love filling my body as she did. "Go on ahead, you three. Ginerva and Luna got here a couple minutes ago!"
As I take hit after hit off of the blunt, I feel myself getting lighter and a smile dances across my face. I close my eyes, the image of Blondie stuck in my head. His authoritarian voice sent shivers down my spine and I let my hand drag down my stomach and into my boxers.
I am proved wrong, however, when an arm grabs me roughly and I’m pinned against the wall, nose shoved roughly against the gross smelling pain, as handcuffs are attached to me - and not the good kind.
"Please, daddy." I moaned as he avoided my sex for what seemed like the hundredth time. "Daddy please just touch me!" The last part was a little louder, perhaps too loud, but it got his attention.
"I do."
”Just so you know,” Scorp began as he drove us back to the estate, “we could all hear you two last night.” I don’t know how to reply. Part of me wants to be an embarrassed, blushing mess, but the other part of me wants to be snarky and confident about it. I try the latter.
I sat alone for a while, worried about Marcus' death. It wasn't accidental. It was supposed to happen. Someone had something against him and they were still out there. The problem was, was it just him they wanted? Or other Serpents? Or worse, other gangs? The horrific realisation set in that this might not be a one off, this could be the beginning or a string of attacks on gangs. Worry for my gang set in, and as I tried to reason with myself, I couldn't ignore the possibility of more death.
.” Teddy’s face drops. “You can’t get angry with me. My godfather is the Griffin King. I’ll set him on you.” Teddy’s nose scrunches in disgust. “Ew! I don’t want to hear about you two in the bedroom. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, ALLEYWAY?!” I try hard to hide my laughter behind my hand, and Teddy gives me a strange look, before passing me the phone.
“Ok, Pans. But even if it is an animagus - which I highly doubt - I’m not going to force them back. That’s just being an asshole. There’s probably a valid reason for someone to be hiding as a cat-“
"That's right. My perfect little virgin princess. All ready for me to pound into her tight little cunt. This is why Draco takes you from behind, isn't it? So I could have your cunt all to myself. You're so thoughtful." I looked up. Perhaps it would make the ordeal less awful.
"I don't get it. Do you like living here? Why?"
(See the end of the chapter for
“Tyler. Tyler Lee Joseph.” I lie through my teeth.
“How is it that you guys are the most lawless people in this town and yet we can’t bring you in because we’ve no concrete evidence?” I shrug my shoulders.
“How was I supposed to know you two’ve been getting it on in my absence?”
Suddenly, something catches the corner of my eye and in my rear view mirror I see blue flashing lights.
The next day I woke to a call from Blaise, letting me know he was on the way to pick me up. I didn't bother showering or eating, but I threw on what I'd worn yesterday and waiting for him in the lounge.
"Well..." I thought it over for a minute. I didn't need any more people seeing these than necessary, so I didn't want any officers taking the photos. Zabini already knew they were there, and Marcel obviously knew the case well. "I think I'd be ok to take them myself."
"I've been him for two months," Harry replied with a chuckle, sending Draco that lopsided grin which he hadn't seen in years.
Harry frowned and raised his hand to fumble with said item. He blushed a little.
“Teddy is 16. I thought he should know about the gang. About his heritage. About being my heir.”
“So you want to raw me but you don’t want to get me pregnant?” I check.
He quickly whipped it out of my reach. “What even is it? It’s clearly not drugs, nothing illegal anyway.”
As we sit sullenly in the holding cell, I look around to see who’s been caught. Ginny and Lovegood sit huddled in the corner, and a Rook member is standing at the bars, watching the officers who walk by. A couple of Bloodskull and Serpent members are dotted around, and opposite me is the guy I was dancing with, who is also a Serpent.
"Harder?" I nod. "Faster?" I nod again. Immediately he slams into me, no word of warning, and begins to fuck into me at a much quicker pace.
"Don't be sorry, I'm grateful you stepped in there. Now," I turned back to face the members of the Serpent gang still gathered outside my house, "I can understand how things can get between leaders, which is why I am offering the Serpents as much support as they need until a new leader is found. Food, housing, money, other things, please don't be afraid to ask. There are some limits but we have spare rooms here and I know the Griffins will be welcoming." After saying this, I hear chatter from both my gang and the Serpents, and I turn to face the Griffins. "And that's final. We help them until they get a leader, and you won't complain about it, got that?"  There were some 'yeahs' and heads nodding, so I turned back to the Serpents. "If you need anything, speak to Luna. She can pass on the message. Are we good to move on with everything now?"
"Uh, Mum said she's gonna stop by today." Draco let out a sigh. "And Grandma's coming with her." Draco's shoulder's sagged further. "They said 10ish, I think."
"Don't be so hard on yourself. I'm sure you're a very hard leader when you need to be, confident when to take charge." I sucked in a breath.
"Potter, it's silver. If you're proposing to someone at least go for a white gold. Good lord, don't tell me you proposed to the She-Weasel with a silver ring."
Melissa was unable to stay for much longer, insisting on getting home to her partner, but not long after she left was Draco greeted by more guests.
Harry turned his head to face Draco, "so?"
"I spent 7 years hating everything about you, getting confused about what I thought of you and putting up this façade whenever I was around you. I think somewhere along the way, I fell utterly and madly in love with you."
“One sec!” I yell, panicked. Draco tucks himself back into his trousers and does the fly up, before going to answer the door. I grab my boxers, pulling them on and setting my packer into place. Before I can get some clothes on, Draco swings my door open to reveal Luna, a cheerful look on her face as always. She doesn’t bat an eyelid at my appearance - sex hair, no clothes, the usual - and instead greets us happily.
“Thanks Scorp.” I grin a smile I slip my shoes on and rush out to his car.
"Worry? Why?"
"Thanks. I'll let you get back to whatever you were doing." I waved goodbye and left the house, returning to my own room. Once I was there, I received a phone call from a withheld number.
“Please, Draco. I haven’t seen you in
“May I ask why you were speeding?”
I shook my head, "it was uh. You know the guy that Draco sometimes patrols with? Usually he stays in the car if Dray comes to visit." Ron nodded, his eyebrows furrowing a little.
“Why are you here, Pans?” Draco muttered angrily.
"You love the idea of me. You love the boy who lived, the boy who defeated Voldemort, who saved the Wizarding World. I'm not him, Ginny. I'm Harry. I'm clumsy, I'm forgetful. I get scared during thunderstorms and powercuts. I have days where I'm so mentally drained I can't leave the bed, I can't eat, can't get dressed. I'm not the perfect man you think I am. No matter how many times I try to tell you this, you ignore me. And I can't deal with it anymore."
Once Teddy was settled into his room, Draco had left and I had Luna organise an appointment with our tattooist for him. ‘Our’. He wasn’t a member of the gang, but he did everyone’s tats despite their age and we get him good deals on weed.
"Give me a minute, baby. Don't go getting impatient." The lube bottle cap flips open and I can tell he's covering himself with it. I wiggle my ass at him, showing him how very impatient I am, and yelp when he flips me over. "I want to see your beautiful face when we fuck, baby. Plus this way you can't cover your mouth." He smirks, before pressing a quick kiss to my forehead. He lines himself up with my hole and begins to press hips tip against me. It slips in and I let out a groan.
"Draco?" Harry leaned in the way of his gaze, waving his hand a little. He jumped a little and frowned the ravenhead. Harry gestured to the towel in his hand. "What should I do with-"
"Just a friend," Draco insisted, "he's just staying with me for a couple days."
”The only thing I would be weirded out at is that I’ve been calling you daddy.”
”You’re not that old.”
"You know cat, I'm going to have to take you to the vet." He said as he watched it finish eating. "I mean, not that you care, right? You probably don't even understand what I'm saying, do you?"
"Then what was all last night about then?"
”Alright then.” A familiar voice calls. “Party city. Let’s get you sorted.” I look up to see Blondie in his uniform, looking smart, full of authority and hot as hell. Even seeing his face reminds me of last night, when he was pounding into me, making me shout in pleasure. I feel my crotch begin to throb and dampen and I press my legs together. Draco’s face registers shock, then anger, and then something that could be called lust, when he sees me, but he doesn’t let it detract from his job. One by one, each of the others in the cell are called out and sent home, how they’re processed I don’t know
Draco ducked into the kitchen, where he promptly took off his cloak before making a round of tea for everyone.
"The kitten!" She gasped, ignoring him for a second, jogging over to stroke the cat. "Oh, sorry. Yeah, probably. What's up?"
"Draco?" Millie asked, knocking on the doorframe as she entered. He whipped around quickly.
"Hello?"
"What led you to draw that conclusion?"
He turned to leave the bathroom, stopping in the doorway in surprise.
”Of course she did,” Draco rolled his eyes. “She seems to believe James isn’t actually a cat.” He explained, although Narcissa already knew this. At the mention of his name, the black kitten appeared from under the coffee table, running over to Draco, and jumped onto his lap.
When he woke, he was glad to see James still close to him. He was a little less glad when he heard his doorbell ringing in an incessant manner which could only bring to mind one person.
Sorry this took forever to come out, hope you enjoyed x
"I can't say." I looked to Blaise, who seemed relieved at this. What in the god damn was wrong with him? I grew angsty. I felt like he was hiding something from me, something big. First my boyfriend didn't want to see me in my days off - which was the last thing that horny kid would do - and now this?
“I can have Luna arrange a meeting if you like.” Granger smiles. I nod in thanks, before heading upstairs, where I spot Thomas’ door wide open, and Thomas lying on the bed.
”What’s wrong, baby boy?” He asks quietly so the others won’t hear. I lean up on my tip toes to whisper to him.
"Good morning, dear!" Pansy smiled as he swung the door open, James by his side protectively.
Draco opened the window for the owl, who flew in and dropped a newspaper on the table before leaving just as swiftly as it had arrived. He looked over the headline, rolling his eyes seeing it was The Prophet.
The rest of the drive was silent, and I didn't say much else once we arrived.
I'm not sure how long I sat there for. It could have been minutes. Perhaps hours. I didn't know. Still don't.
“Woah.” They say. It’s a male voice, perhaps a couple years younger than myself, but I don’t know who it could be. Our clients always book an appointment, and there were no scheduled for today. “Is that the Aston Martin DB11? Sick!” The footsteps approach and I feel obliged to greet the person. I slide out from under the car, which had been lifted a foot or so off the floor, and stand to meet them.
”You’re so perfect. I love your hole, baby. So tight for me. Just for me.” I can tell he’s close, and as he starts to stroke me I begin to near climax too.
"Oh, ok. Is Zabini with you?" I enquired, trying to peer around him.
“Pansy! Look, if James is a wizard, then he can turn back when he’s ready.” She sighed but seemed okay with the compromise. “Not that he will turn, because he’s just a cat.”
“Mr Malfoy!”

"It's called trauma, Draco. What're you doing anyway?"
”It’s just that’s it’s, uh, a bit embarrassing.”
mess, he gives me a pair of his joggers and the hoodie to slip on.
“Harry, please-“ Blaise tried, as I started rushing out of the stirrups and going to find my clothes.
“Oh. Well, you know. Only the best for the Griffin King.” I say with a small smile.
”Dad?” I voice my thoughts, letting myself known. Draco’s head snaps up and his eyes widen. I step closer so I’m next to them.
Granger cries from the other end.
It wasn’t for another couple days after Narcissa’s visit that Draco was met, once again, by his oldest friend.
“Happy birthday, Draco,” was all he heard, whispered softly by the man practically snuggling him, before he was pulled into the deep lull of sleep.
Gin returned to the living room as I headed up to Teddy's room, knowing he'd be in. I knocked loudly, and waited for a clear response before entering. He's a teenage boy with a boyfriend, I wasn't going to risk anything.
"He reminds us all of someone," Pansy added, looking at Draco with a sly side-eye.
"Of course I love you!" She rushed to retort, offended by his words.
“Yep.”
He continued. "You were loud and boisterous and clumsy. Loyal to your friends, not just that fake shit I pretended to have with Crabbe and Goyle either. You were an idiot, still are really, but incredibly bright. Your lopsided grin and constantly messy hair were far cuter than they should have been. You have this dumb, loud laugh that I love to hear. Wished I could have been the cause of it.
The rest of the drive was silent, and when we pulled up to my house I thanked him quietly and hurried inside.
"And you said it was a stray?" She asked him, allowing the cat to get used to her.
Sorry for the delay loves. Got caught up with college work and exams (send help!)
He grabbed his wand and rushed into the bathroom, leaving James sat on the bed, meowing apologetically after him.
SIDENOTE: I was about to go to update the His Name Is Seamus fic and I did a bad. I was deleting this draft from Wattpad (I write on Wattpad on my ipad, come at me) and either Wattpad broke or I did. So my draft for the final chapter of HNIS got deleted instead of the draft for this, so I’m going to have to rewrite it :) It WILL a be up as soon as possible though. Love you all x
“Well I offered to suck you off a minute ago but you turned me down.”
No smut this chapter, but some background on the gang. Also some Teddy Lupin (whose age is conveniently the age of consent. Maybe Teddy’ll get some action later on?).
"Can't satisfy you for long, can I?" He chuckled, wrapping an arm around my neck and pulling me down, meeting me halfway to capture my lips in a soft kiss. His other hand slid down to my clit, rubbing it softly. I moaned into his mouth, quickening my grinding onto his hand, feeling myself get wetter. "Fuck, baby. You like it when I touch you, huh?" I couldn't answer, but I'm sure it was rhetorical. He quickened his hand movements, and moved to sck on the hickey he had given me last night. I leaned back, trying to push myself over the edge of climax as I felt the heat building in my stomach, my breath heavy and my heartbeat fast.
She bade me farewell, insisting I get some rest just as Draco had, and left me alone in my room.
"I rarely work the counter, though. People in this town talk and don't trust my face."
"Hi baby," he grinned. "I'm technically still on duty but there was a breakthrough with the case and I had to tell you now."
“He’s a police officer. Draco Malfoy.” My breath hitches in my throat as I stare at Teddy in shock. “Have you met him?”
“I’ve made my decision.” He states once we’ve finished eating. “I’ll join the gang!” He exclaims loudly. I shake my head with a small chuckle, finding his excitement amusing. Andromeda, however, stands up silently and takes her plate through to the kitchen. “Oh. What’s wrong with her?”
Draco slams the door shut with hit foot before throwing me on the bed. He wastes no time in attaching his lips to mine as he unbuttons my shirt. Despite his amazing kiss, I press a hand to his chest and gently push him back. He gives me a strange look and I hold up a finger to him, telling him I'll just be a minute, before I head into his en-suite showerroom. While in there, I brush my teeth - hopefully he won't mind sharing - and then undress, leaving me in the green thong. My heart was beating hard, threatening to burst out of my chest. I take a deep breath and open the door wide, letting Draco see me. When he does, his jaw drops and his eyes widen as he takes in the sight, and I feel my cheeks flush.
James ventured up, standing on Draco's collarbones to begin to play with his hair, kept just how he had it in Hogwarts.
Harry gripped the front of Draco's shirt and pulled him down a little, leaning on his
The door opened a couple minutes later to reveal the doctor with a familiar face.
“I learned what happens when Draco gets jealous.” I shrugged, heading over to sit on one of the sofas.
"Draco you're an awful liar."
“Do you want some help choosing?” I only nod in reply and she pulls a measuring tape out of her pocket. She measures my thighs and my hips, before turning to the underwear. She grabs two pairs off the wall. One is a deep red pair of panties, completely lace, and the other is an emerald green thong. “The green goes with your eyes and the red will go nice with your skin. Want me to ring them up?” I follow her to the counter and smile when I see her brushing her fingertips over her Griffin tattoo as the machine processes the purchase. With a cheery, non-judgemental smile fro, Luna, I take my paid itsms back home in their plain brown bag, in disbelief of what I’d just bought.
She was silent for a moment. “I have an idea as to he is. Officer Malfoy?” I nodded. “And your name isn’t Tyler, is it?” I shook my head. “It’s ok, I understand completely. And as to that question you want to ask, no, I won’t tell him. Detectives and uniforms rarely interact. But this is a case, and it’s confidential.” I breathed a sigh of relief.
”Well, dinner’s here now so if you want to-” Teddy gets up and pushes past me, before running downstairs. I give Scorpius a strange look.
"So you just wanted somewhere to stay for a week or so, yeah? I'll speak to Luna and she'll get back to you." I smiled politely, trying to end whatever was happening.
father.” He raises an eyebrow.
”I think it’s time you showed me that surprise of yours, baby.” He remarks, loud enough for the two boys to hear. I press kisses to his face as he carries us upstairs to his room.
”Party tonight over with the Serpents. Don’t need to bring anything. You coming?” Weasley answers.
Draco tried to mumble against it, but James meowed loudly, angrily almost. When James was happy that Draco was definitely going to stop rambling, he removed his paw and licked the tip of Draco's nose, before sitting on Draco's chest, seemingly pleased with himself.
I look at the wall of panties in front of me, amazed by how many different styles there were. Every colour known to man and every fabric that could even be considered slightly sexy. There were thongs and panties and g-strings and boxers. Upon further inspection, these boxers did have holes in the rear for easy access, so they weren’t as vanilla as originally thought. As I’m browsing, someone walks up behind me.
"At least I can tell those women that I have a boyfriend." He rolls his eyes.
I head upstairs, showering quickly, before sitting through Draco’s clothes, trying to find something that’s small enough to not swamp me. I find a pair of sweatpants and a hoodie which aren’t too bad, having to go pantsless as all of his boxers wold slip down my waist if I wore them. I sit at the island in the kitchen, thinking of a way to get home, when I hear the front door unlock.
"Aw, James," Draco cooed, crouching down to get to the cat's level. "You scared of the storm buddy?" James mewed softly in response, poking his head out from under the bed. Draco coaxed him out, picking him up gently as to not scare him before laying on his bed. "I used to get scared of storms too, you know." He spoke as if he were trying to calm a child, as if James could actually understand what he was saying.
"If I want him put away, Yes." I answered for him, looking him in the eye. He gave me a sad smile. "Thanks for the lift," I muttered, before heading back into my home.
”Do what, baby? You want me to suck your little dick?” I nod, growing impatient. “Then ask me nicely.”
”Two things. One, Teddy mentioned to me on the phone that you need the Irish kid’s number for Dean. I did some digging, and I found it. Secondly, I was wondering if you’d like to go on a date with me. I was thinking a lovely little Thai place in town, but maybe we could order in instead?”
"Slytherin colours?" He asked, disbelieving.
“I know that! But cats do this slow blink thing at you, it means they love you!” Draco chuckled at her enthusiasm. “Seriously, that’s what they do! You’ll have to keep checking if James does it to you. You took him in and all, I’m sure he does love you.”
He walked out into the lounge. No sign of James as another flash of lightning lit up the dark sky outside, followed quickly by a loud, bellowing roar of thunder.
”No cool house names?” He asks. I shake my head and he frowns. “How about... Hufflepuff?” Draco lets out a small laugh, as do I.
Pleasure exploded through me and I moaned his name loud enough to shake the room, a comfortable warmth following quickly after as my body relaxed into Draco's hold.
“Hey Harry.” He greets when he sees me, setting his phone down. I sit on the end of his bed and turn to face him. “Woah, you look serious.”
”If either of you are jealous again I’m moving out. You need sound proofing in your room. Even Neville and Blaise aren’t as loud as you two.” Weasley groans.
“Right. Correct me if I’m wrong, but you adopted a cat and gave it the same name as your best friend?” Draco asked incredulously.
”Really, Daddy?” I barely hear the muttered ‘Jesus fucking christ’ before he pulls me against him by grabbing my hips and slamming his lips on mine. I smile against him, and open my mouth to let his tongue slip in, completely dominating me.
“I’ll be off, then.” She smiled, heading to his door. “It appears I have some research on Animagi to be doing. Bye Draco,” she kissed him on the cheek. “Bye James!” She cooed to the kitten, which meowed in response as she left the house.
“The She-Weasel is in on this charade too?” He guffawed. He stepped back, crouching before the kitten who looked at him with those innocent little emerald green eyes. “Ok, James. Last time we’ll ask. You want to go home with the Granger-Weasleys and see the ginger devil herself, or do you want to stay here with me?”
”Astoria, you must remember me mentioning Edward, uh, Teddy Lupin? Remus and Nymphadora’s son. Andromeda’s grandson.” Draco explains. The woman nods slowly. “And Harry runs the Griffin gang. Teddy, as his Godson, was named heir. Andromeda kicked him out because he accepted the offer and so he’s living with the gang. I don’t think he”s officially joined yet.”
“I don’t know how to explain, but no. And hey, maybe Teddy is into it.”
”No. He’s cute but not really my type.” I sighed in relief. “Getting jealous?”
"Just went for a long walk, had to think some stuff over. Sorry I didn't let you guys know," I lied seamlessly.
“His name is Seamus. I’ll get you two in touch as soon as I can.” Dean starts to yell at me as I walk away.
”Draco,” she smiled motherly, but he didn’t feel the love it was supposed to exude. “Who’s this lovely lady?”
"This? You're only fooling yourself. We all know you've got a sweet, wet cunt down there." He took it and threw it down the alley. I whimpered, and closed my eyes. This was a mistake.
Millie was shocked, if that was the right word for it.
“You and Pansy are two peas in pod.” He rolled his eyes in return, leaning back slightly in the chair.
"Ginny and I broke up."
”This is still a punishment. Get up.” I stand quickly, scared of what’s going to happen next. He motions for me to follow him, and he leads me down the upstairs hallway to what appears to be a guest room. The walls are bare, and the bed looks cold and unused. I give him a confused look. “Part of the punishment, now hop on into bed.” He says, giving my ass a pat, which jostles the plug in me. I whimper, and take a few steps towards the bed, observing it cautiously. I hear the door move and I whip around.
"Who's calling?"
I went to Nev's room, knocking before entering. He was sat on his bed, texting on his phone with bright blush on his face.
Draco took the cat to the vet, surprised that it dutifully followed him there, not needing to be carried, and stuck close by him when he walked up to the receptionist.
Draco didn't know when he started crying. Draco didn't really know he was able to. But his vision was going blurry and tears were making their way down his face faster than he could wipe them away.
I have now realised I haven’t even touched anal plugs yet, which is like, one of the first tags I put. I PROMISE there will be plugs soon. Very soon (very very soon!!)
“Come for me, baby.” My orgasm hits me almost immediately after, and my grip on his hair tightens as it rolls through me. “So good for me.” He whispers. “Such a good boy. So proud of you.” Again, the warmth fills me at the praise and I lean back to give him a tired smile. He pecks me on the forehead, before pulling away to rinse his hands in the sink. I give his crotch a glance, which is still rock hard. I go over to him and place a hand on his covered cock, before going to undo his trousers. “Don’t worry about me, baby boy. I’ll be fine.” I stop, and pull my hand back.
Once out, we dress quickly and get downstairs in enough time to see a car pull up. I grab one of the spare keys for house 3, where Teddy would be moving in, and go out to greet my Godson. I see him climb out the car and grab a bag and a medium size suitcase. As soon as the door closes, the car speeds off up the street. I watch his body posture sag at the action, and then visibly brighten when he sees us. I walk over to the blue-haired boy and pull him into a hug.
”What do you want, squirt?”
"It's usually only busy for an hour, it should really calm down after that. Then there's another rush around four o'clock before it tapers off for the evening." Draco explained quickly to Harry, sliding a coffee onto the table as well as a small pastry. "Let me know if you need anything," he added over his shoulder as he headed behind the counter, an elderly couple walking into the café as he did.
When I awaken later, Draco is lightly drawing shapes on my chest, an arm behind my neck. His eyes met mine and a smile graced his lips.
A knocking came from the front door. Draco looked to Pansy, who shrugged in return. He set James down and headed to the door.
“You will.”
”Oh, what a lovely name!” Millie spoke, her voice light with good intention. “Like the flower? My mother used to love narcissus flowers!” Draco felt easier that his mother seemed to relax at this, smiling along and chattering away for a minute or so.
”About What?” He asks, although he knows what I’m on about.
“I think you’re weird, Pans. Although, I always have.” Draco rubbed his face in frustration.
Draco's heart fluttered a little but he hid his excitement as best he could.
”They’re long gone. But everyone in the gang doesn’t really care.”
"Tell me who brought in the complaint." I said to the receptionist.
"Trust me, that idiot can get himself in danger no matter where he is."
I can’t help but moan, feeling his fingers rubbing me in such a manner. He moves his head down, dragging his tongue from it to my asshole. My hands grab his hair, trying to keep him there, but he easily grabs them and pins them above myself head.
“He’s not a baby,” Draco rolled his eyes, but crouched to pick James up anyway. “You want feeding?” But James meowed almost louder, pawing at Draco’s chest. Like something was wrong. “You alright?” He asked seriously, despite knowing the cat wouldn’t reply.
When we got home, I was happy I'd gone. It had, for the most part, been a welcome distraction. And being surrounded with family had reminded me how much I missed them.
“I wasn’t loud.” Neville frowns.
"Shove off," Harry smiled in reply. "I know you said I could stay but..."
"Tell me, Potter,"
"It should be a crime for you to wear that, fuck." He groans as I walk over to him, giving a quick twirl on the way over. By now he's sitting on the edge of the bed, so I straddle him and sit on his lap. His hands immediately move to cup my ass as he presses soft kisses across my chest and up my neck. "Are you OK to wear these?" He asks, obviously concerned about my dysphoria.
Draco almost spat out his drink. James perched up on the table, making himself known
"Oh." Was all Draco said. He went to cover his Dark Mark but she stopped him.
”You look ravishing tonight, baby.” He winks, before the three of us climbed into his car and went to his house. It was fairly large, in an expensive looking suburban area. The inside was  well decorated yet minimalistic, and little colour around the house. “I’ve ordered in. Dinner will be served in a few minutes, but Teddy if you want, Scorp’s room is third on the left upstairs.” The boy nods, running off the greet Draco’s son. I follow Draco into the kitchen and he begins placing plates on the marble counter of the island. I lean up and press a gentle kiss to the back of his neck, getting his attention.
From where he was standing at the counter, he saw the vet who cared for James walk in. Noticing him quickly, she smiled and waved, not taking long to decide what to order.
"So, Harry, still dating that chick?" Fred asked with a grin, halfway through the meal. "What was her name again?"
“It’s OK. That’s why he split up with his wife, ex-wife now I suppose. He realised he was into guys. Took him long enough though. Shame for-” Teddy cuts himself off by slapping a hand to his mouth. “Sorry. Not my story to tell.” He apologises with a small smile. “So what were you saying about the gang?”
“It’s Granger-Weasley, actually,” Granger smiled. “Or you could use our first names, like a decent human being.”
I place the phone down in the kitchen table before letting out a worried sigh. I turn around to get dressed when I see a note on the fridge door.
“There’s a few extras in the side pocket. They can stay here.” She nods, heading upstairs. I turn to the man beside me. “Come on.” I lead him outside, showing him the estate and greeting a few others we see along the way. We head into a small alleyway where no one will bother us, and I turn to face him. “So why are you really here?”
James began kneading at the fabric of the bed, making Draco sit back down. Happy with this, James wandered over to his bedside table, standing on his pillow and batting the clock with his paw.
My orgasm hits me, making my back arch as pleasure shoots through me and moans fall from my lips. Breath heavy, I fall asleep with his name on my lips.
"At lunchtime, yes. I'm closing up shop today. Why?"
When I saw the car pull up outside, I didn't wait for him to knock before leaving the house, knowing most of my friends would still be asleep, and got into the car.
"And you're stood in your doorway because...?" As she trailed off her question, the black cat came running back over, brushing against Draco's legs. Melissa aw-ed, but Draco bid farewell, promising to explain later, and heading into his house again.
“Pans, what’s going on?” Draco followed her quickly, not wanting her to cause damage to anything under his roof.
"You seemed to enjoy yourself. I don't get why you're complaining." He pulled the duvet off us, leaving both of our bodies exposed to the colder air of my bedroom.
"Exclusive interview... missing you every day... just isn't like him..." Draco muttered, reading the article. "Load of bollocks," He summarised neatly, throwing the paper back onto the table
I took out a new needle and syringe, filling it up with the clear liquid from the bottle before pinching some skin on my thigh. Before I could lazily stab it in, a hand grabbed my wrist.
”That’s better. Now go wash your face and get ready for bed.” He smiles, as if everything was fine. I stand on wobbly legs and walk as best as I can with the moving plug in my ass, clambering up the stairs and reaching his bedroom. I wash my face and brush my teeth quickly in his en suite before I sit on the edge of the bed, waiting for him. He eventually enters the room, but ignores me as he puts away some of the items from earlier. When he looks to me, he raises an eyebrow.
“Yeah. I need to tell you a few things, some very important things. You need to listen, alright? You can ask questions as we go along, but keep your ears peeled.” He nods, solemly.
Time went by quickly. She had me describe a lot in detail, the weather, the alleyway, what I was thinking as I was walking to the location. The actual event she didn’t pressure me to describe in as much detail though. It was hard, so hard. And exhausting. I was in the brink of tears the entire time, still feeling his hands on me, everywhere. His lips on my face, his hands at my throat, my wrists, my hips. When I was done talking we sat in silence for a minute. She had been taking thorough notes the entire time, but put her pen down.
"Lord of the Rings... The Hobbit..." Draco muttered aloud. As he read the blurb, he raised an eyebrow.
"He's got a girlfriend, so nothing." Draco shrugged before taking Harry his drink.
While he chopped and cooked, James simply sat at the end of the countertop, watching Draco eagerly. He hopped down when Draco served their meals, but was back up there to watch Draco as he cleaned up, which took a while as Draco refused to get a ‘dishwasher’ but didn’t feel safe using magic so often in a muggle area.
(See the end of the chapter for
”Well done baby.” Draco whispers, wrapping a soft, fluffy towel around my shoulders once we step out of the shower. When I’m dry and my hair is only a
FINALLY they fucked. Smut with a wholesome ending? Gotta be my fave thing in the world.
"I want to show you." He hesitated, "don't be mad."
“Oh, that’s cool. Sorry I just walked in here. Didn’t know you were busy. What’s wrong with the Aston?” We look at the sleek, white car.
“Well, he’s certainly the last person I thought you’d ever get with, but I’m happy for you.”
"He's a grown man, I think he can handle himself in a
"It's charmed to keep your head dry so you don't have to wear a hood. I know you hate how they mess up your hair. The makers charm the threads to create a bubble of protection from natural elements, each layer of thread creating a stronger bubble in a larger field."
"Let you go? In your wildest dreams, girlie." Fuck, that cut deep. But I knew that he was just an asshole, and in a few minutes I'd be able to go home, cry a bit and surround myself with people who actually gave a shit.
you, I'm just a poor sod who is of the misfortune to find you stupidly attractive, idiocy included."
They spent a good while talking to Millie about the muggle world. Draco, despite practically living in it for almost a decade, still had a lot to learn, and the other three were intrigued - or perhaps amused - by the way muggles handled situations which seemed impossible without magic.
"Oh, wow. That's... that's really good news. Thanks for stopping by." I needed a minute to process everything.
”Edward! You joined a gang?” Draco’s mother’s voice is pure shock.
"Cheers," Harry replies sheepishly, wrapping a towel around his waist quickly.
"Ok." I said. "Thank you for telling me."
His arms encased me. They were warm and strong; they were protective; they were safe. And I knew it wasn't Draco, Draco who would always keep me out of harm, but Blaise was here with me and he would try and do the same, for Draco's sake. Knowing they were close friends, I trusted Blaise as much as I trusted Draco, or even my own friends. I felt a lot better about him being with Neville.
”I was just looking around. I wasn’t doing anything.” The kid rolls his eyes.
“Pans, you’re really worrying me here. Spell for what?”
"He's a Gryffindor, Draco," Blaise chuckled. Neville sent his boyfriend a death glare, although it didn't seem so effective.
"H-harder please."
Teddy slowly nods. “I think... ok. I accept the offer of being your heir. Although, if you’re with Draco...”
Introductions were made quickly, with James recognising Blaise quickly and taking a friendly interest in Neville - not that Draco was jealous.
"I'll be sure to pay a visit," she smiled.
"He's a bit.. arrested at the moment." Blaise said after a moment. I stopped in my tracks just by the front desk.
“I’ve got it!” She announced loudly, pushing past him into his house. “Where is he?” She demanded. “James! JAMES!”
But as I got into bed, I looked back on that moment. And I cried, and cried, and cried.
"Never stop wearing them, for God's sake." He groans, slipping a finger between my cheeks and rubbing my hole. I squirm slightly in his lap an he captures my lips in his in reply. He stands up, still holding me, and throws me onto the bed, where I was a minute ago. While I get comfortable, he pulls his own clothes off, and he leans over me on the bed, buck ass naked. He brings his crotch down, rubbing his bare dick against my covered crotch and I can't help but to gasp. I wrap my arms around his neck, grinding against him as I bring him down for a seering kiss, teeth clashing. He pulls back from the kiss for a second to slip the thong down my legs, throwing it into a corner of the room. "How far do you want to go?"
I turn my head when I hear footsteps approach but his hand grabs the top of my head, not too roughly, and turns it to face forward. I hold in a small whimper at the action and he places a few things on the coffee table. I don’t try to look at what they are though.
This isn't happening. This is a nightmare. You'll wake up any minute in Draco's arms. At home. Safe. With people who love you. Just count to three. I thought to myself, each second he came closer to me with that thing.
Once home, I head straight to my room, my gang members knowing not to come in. I roll a blunt, and undress before lighting it.
"Harry, I-" I sighed. "I don't know the details of it, but I know what happened with Goyle."
Draco’s heart swelled at the sight and he followed carefully so the cat didn’t fall.
, kept her promises.
”Draco had to leave for work. Scorp’s offering a lift home.” I grabbed my clothes, scribbling a note to Draco under his neat calligraphy, before slipping my shoes on and heading to Scorp’s car outside. Teddy was sitting upfront with him, so I lay across the backseats.
I stopped at home to throw on some sweatpants and a jumper before heading to the Griffin estate.
Malfoy pulls back as his hand comes to rest on my trouser zip. We make eye contact, and he gives me a look. I nod quickly before wrapping my arms around his neck and pulling him down for another kiss. As our tongues battle for dominance - a battle which he quickly wins - I feel his hand slipping underneath the waistband of my boxers. I feel my breath hitch as I wait for his reaction. He knows I’m trans, but nevertheless, he might be expecting a dick.
"You're a child."
“Really?” Harry asked, getting excited. Draco rolled his eyes and laid on his back, making a point of it as he did.
It's an awkward silence, they can both feel it. Someone should say something, but who? And what?
“That was weird,” was all she said from where she sat on his armchair. “You’ve got to admit, he does look a little bit like Potter.”
"Who's the vic?"
Draco examined the inside, seeing it was lined with a glossy, deep green silk, with the edges lined in a silver thread.
“Not at all, Ron. I doubt we’ll even get that far.”
Draco cried out in pain, his hand shooting to the area to feel a little warm blood already spilling out.
"What is that?" Pansy wondered, going to examine the muggle alcohol.
"Good morning," Harry smiled back softly. Draco leaned over, kissing his fiancé on the cheek as he done every morning for the past couple years.
“We’ve only just met and you’re tying me up? Officer, I’m flattered.” I flirt, feeling his crotch lightly press against my ass.
"Scorp, it's half nine now! Kid, you're awful." Scorpius beams at this though. "Alright, make yourself look presentable, at least. Is Teddy staying?" Scorp shrugs and heads back into the kitchen, leaving Draco to drag me upstairs quickly.
“Yeah. Might be a bit awkward. Sirius was the black sheep of the family, no pun intended, and Andromeda might have brought Teddy up with that idea. But he needs to know about it. His father was a part of the gang, almost prince consort as well.” I chuckle. “It’s his heritage, I guess. And I don’t exactly have any kids to pass it in to.”
"Yes baby?"
This has been sitting in my drafts for months, practically finished. I genuinely have no idea why this wasn’t out sooner. Also, it’s almost twice the length of my other chapters. Anyways, hope you enjoy xx
“So what are you in for?”
"My, my, Potter. What would the papers say?"
Thank you guys for your support! Enjoy chapter 2 xx
“Woah woah woah, kids. Keep it PG!” A familiar voice calls frm, the doorway, and I leap back from Draco. He puts an arm around my waist and pulls me back to him as he turns to face the intruder.
”I was wondering if I could talk to Blaise. Alone.”
Returning to my room, the horrible sound of an alarm blasted at my unsuspecting and painful ears, making me recoil with a yelp.
"Daddy!" I moan loudly as I tip over the edge. I tighten around Draco, and it sends him over the edge, sending ribbons of cum into me as he moans my name loudly. We collapse back onto the bed, breathing heavily.
The kiss was soft yet rough. It was everything and not enough. The clatter of the broom falling to the floor wasn't enough to make Draco flinch, whose mind could only think about Harry's lips on his. Draco's hands quickly found themselves on Harry's waist, pulling him impossibly closer.
"Harry, your hair is soaking?" Draco scolded. "You'll catch a cold."
“Just wanted the keys to the car, dad. Jeez. Trust me, I did
“I’m not gay. No offence or anything guys, but I don’t like dick.”
"Well, I do what I can to keep this lot in check." I smiled, trying to diverse the conversation. She let out a light, shrilly laugh and let her hand brush my chest for a second.
No one had come forward about the cat. After some experimenting with names, he and Melissa - because she seemed more invested in the kitten than he was - had found that the kitten responded to James. Draco had tried other nicknames to, like Jamie, Jamesie and Jay, none of which earned respect from the cat. But as is with most cats, respect is hard to earn.
”Yes, daddy.” He hums to himself, and leans over me to grab something from the table. I here the flip of a lid and I smile. Finally. Two cold, lube covered fingers press at my asshole and push in with ease, scissoring my entrance and stretching it for his cock to fit. I’m surprised when, instead of undoing his flies and turning me so I can ride him, something solid and hard fills me. It’s long, but not as long as daddy, and I can tell that it’s wider at the base than it is at the tip. I let out a sound of disappointment as he pulls my panties up.
“Drug possession. Of all the cars they could have pulled over, mine was the one with a couple grams of coke in. Swear, man can’t take a break these days.” He laughs. “Oh, looks like yer fella is coming over. I’ll let you two have a moment.” He winks.
“It’s a promise. Now, get out of here.”
My vision was blurry thanks to the tears, but I could see the deep worry in his eyes. "Harry, he's gone now. They've got him. You're safe now. You're here in the police station with me, you're safe." I nodded slowly. "This isn't professional of me, but am I ok to hug you?" I smiled at him, at him being so considerate. I nodded.
“You brought a cat with you...” he mumbled, before carrying on. “I started seeing Nev about a year ago. We kind of haven’t told many people though. I don’t even know if he’s told his mates.” Blaise scratched the back of his neck awkwardly.
“Hey baby boy. Long time no see.”
“Animagus? McGonagall’s one, she’s even a cat.”
Some time passed, perhaps it was weeks, maybe months. Draco was unsure, lost in the normality of his daily life, Harry now included. Mornings alone had turned into 'good morning's muffled into a head of black hair. Walking into the café at the beginning of a shift had turned into 'see you later's and the scraping of a chair by the window. Long shifts turned into glances at the window seat. Nights alone turned into the warmth of someone snuggled beside him.
“Prince consort, actually. Teddy is technically prince. If he wants to be.”
Regardless, I knew I couldn’t spend the day wasting away in bed, I had a duty to my gang, to my family.
Harry found the bedroom easily, surprised by the amount of personal decor it had for a guest room. He took a minute to look at the picture frames on the dresser, images of Draco and his two closest friends throughout the years after high school.
"Draco? What's going on?" They asked in a hushed tone.
"The Picture of Dorian Gray."
"Can I know who did it, at least?" I bit my lip. "It's fine if not." He added quickly at my silence.
"Can I kiss you?" I asked after a second.
“Can...” I thought for another second before continuing what I wanted to say. “Can you make sure Officer Goyle goes with him, please?”
"Oh, I didn't. I just... I'd been walking for so long - my car broke down - and I thought I recognised this place. If some stranger had answered and turned me away, well at least I tried."
"Thank you. You didn't have to, really you didn't. But these are all amazing."
Once we reach the station after an awkward car ride, I’m taken in for questioning, mostly so they can get my details, but the officer who’s interviewing me – Not Blondie, but some big fucker who’s an absolute dullhard – is making me infuriated.
”I uh... I was taken to the police station with a couple other gang members. Then when I was released I went home with my boyfriend and spent the night at his house.”
A little later, he set down a plate of tune and a small bowl of water on the floor in the kitchen, followed by his own meal at the table.
"Oh, Luna's working today." Cho shrugged with a smile. I held back my confusion, knowing for a fact that Luna was not working today, and was actually enjoying her day off with her girlfriend, but I allowed the conversation to continue. "It's just, ever since Marcus' death, I've not felt safe at the Serpents. I know the gang all feels like that, but I'm scared something might happen." You and me both, Cho. "I'm sure you can understand. I just was wondering if I might be able to move residence for a while, stay here until everything's calmed down." I listened to her as I saw a police car pull up down the road, and three people get out of it. "I'd just feel so much safer with such a strong leader around, who knows what he's doing." Her tone had changed, as had her body language, and I blinked in surprise.
They sat opposite each other, catching up for a little while, James sitting comfortably next to Draco.
I threw my cigarette on the floor, crushing it with the tip of my boot, as a man appeared. Under his hood I could tell he was bald and I could see a large scar running down one of his cheeks. Dressed in all black, he walked over carrying a small, black sports bag. I eye it carefully, not wanting any tricks.
“And,” he began to ask, turning his gaze back to Pansy, “what if he’s just a regular cat?”
“Please.” I whisper, feeling my second orgasm of the day nearing. I can feel him grin against my skin as a hand slips into my boxers and he rubs at my clit. My breath quickens and he begins to assault my neck with bites and kisses, no doubt leaving an array of marks. “I’m going to...” I say, breathless.
”Yes. At number 3, with Ginny and I.”
Draco was taken aback a little when Harry rolled his eyes and practically straddled the blond. Harry seemed to thinking nothing of the position, naïve as always.
When I wake, I'm alone in Draco's bed and there's a heavy throbbing in my lower back. I sit up slowly, feeling something disgusting in my ass. I wish I'd showered after last night. I hobble over to the en-suite, showering quickly and cleaning out my sore hole. When it comes to dressing, I get lazy and throw on my thong and his shirt from last night, running my hands through my hair before heading cautiously downstairs. In the kitchen, I smell fresh coffee and cooked breakfast, and can hear the radio playing lgiht, joyful songs. I stop in my tracks, but my footsteps have already caught the person's attention. Draco appears in the doorway, smiling when he sees what I'm wearing.
"They know better than to mess with us." I tell him, before heading outside. Standing in front of my house are thirty or so Serpents, angry expressions on all of their faces.
”Keep your eyes on the road and shut up!” I yell lightheartedly. The two boys chuckle, but resume their own private conversation up front.
"Millie...?"
"Yeah, it's down in Miller's Way, off of High Street.
"Parents are in a serial killer's cult and now you sell medicine," Harry said in a mocking tone. Draco frowned and shoved Harry's leg with his foot.
"Bedroom's down the hall on the right," Draco said over his shoulder as he left the room.
”Excuse yourself and go to my bedroom. Once you’re there, strip to your thong. Don’t you dare touch yourself while you wait for me.” He growls the order into my ear and I nod, swallowing. I give a loud fake yawn and tell everyone I’m going for a nap, and that hopefully I’ll be awake before the two women leave. They give me a small wave and I hurry to Draco’s room, throwing all of my clothes off once the door is closed. I lie down on the bed in just my thong, resisting the urge to just rub myself to completion. But I follow Daddy’s order and lie still.
”So how old are you? Because you don’t look older than twenty.”
James meowed, leaning against Draco.
"No, no, no. Please. No." What if Draco saw me like this? Or what if, what if Goyle came back?
“Everything alright up here?” I ask.
When they got called into the room, the vet watched with a smile as Draco placed the cat on the table.
“I know, mother. Scorp told me you two were coming about half an hour ago. I didn’t have time.” My boyfriend defends.
"Seriously, Draco," she hissed. "I don't know what he was like at school. But he made a lot of people realise you're just a normal person. And you're here, just being a very normal person. I'm not going to hold your past against you."
He wishes me goodnight before leaving me aloneness in the room. I clamber into the bed and try my best to get comfy, but to no avail as the plug keeps vibrating ever so slowly in my ass. Try as I might to get pleasure from it, the plug only serves to tease me relentlessly. I let out a loud groan in frustration as I wiggle about madly. I eventually give up, and hug a pillow to my chest a smirk I try to sleep, letting the scent from daddy’s hoodie calm me.
"It's just... I know Draco said he'll keep on top of it but - especially considering what that woman was acting like - I just don't think they'll bring the guy to justice." I spoke solemnly.
"My pleasure, baby." He kissed my nose. "Now, shouldn't you get dressed?" Reluctantly, I got off his lap and threw on a pair of joggers, leaving myself topless before leaving my room to greet the evening.
“I should hope so,” she muttered. Draco raised an eyebrow. “Oh.” Was all she said. She glanced at Draco, at James, then back at Draco. “Never mind! Ignore me.”
farewell.
”He’s fucking huge, isn’t he?” She gossips, leaning forward. Growing more confident, I agree.
"And if you're not, then it helps with your disguise. That's why I'm assuming you're a cat. You're hiding from something. What kind of animagus willingly gets adopted by some ex-Death Eater who runs a coffee shop?
"I'm going to take this upstairs. I'll be back within the hour. You'll be okay to handle things until then?" Draco spoke as calmly as he could and Jen nodded, smiling to him in thanks.
”Please, Daddy. I promise I’ll never miss behave again.” I whimper as he makes me kneel by his feet. He looks at me with a smirk, unbuttoning his trousers and pulling his cock out, which is hard and stands to attention. I feel my mouth begin to water at the sight and I ache for it inside of me. However he simply turns the TV, turning to a porn channel where he slowly strokes himself to a video of an older man furiously pounding into a bound and gagged twink. Watching the video, I imagine what it would be like to be that twink, and I feel myself grow impossibly more horny. I wiggle about on the plug inside of me, trying to get something from it. But it wasn’t long enough, and it’s base didn’t allow for the movement I needed.
"Do you want to come with me?" He asked it, almost in disbelief. It took a couple steps closer to him, still on the sofa, as if to say yes. "And I'm going to have to carry you up the stairs, aren't I?" He didn't wait for an answer, picking the thing up gently and going to his bedroom.
“Ok, listen. The spell is
Is it weird that this was one of the easiest chapters for me to write? Like I guess I’m excited to have Harry move on from the event and be surrounded be people who love him. Maybe that’s not weird.
“Harry, if I had to go the rest of my life without sex so I could be with you, then I would. It’s as simple as that. Provided you want me with you, I’ll be there. For whatever you need.”
"Living with you, as James... I've never had more fun." Harry admitted with a smile.
He jumped when he heard the door open behind him, turning quickly to see Draco.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco stalked over to her, rolling up his sleeves slightly before gripping her collar and roughly shoving her against one of the police cars.
"Of course." He smiled, before giving me his boyfriend's number.
"What's wrong with them?"
”How are you so pure and yet so dirty?” He chuckles, slipping a hand under my panties to tug gently at the plug. I gasp at the action and tighten my grasp on my tea. “Well done for last night, baby. I’m so proud of you. It’s very hard to punish such a pain slut when we haven’t been together for long. Trust me, once I teach you the rest of it all, you’ll be perfectly behaved.” His praise warms me inside, and the rest of his speech sends a shiver down my back.
Draco wasn't entirely sure what he watched, but he enjoyed it regardless.
"It's a bit late to run to her aid now, isn't it?" He managed to speak against the pressure on his throat. "The way she was begging me to let her go, claiming that you loved her. But where were you? When I was taking her in the alley?"
“I suggest you calm down kid. What’s your gender? What’s in between your legs? Not that difficult, kid.” I stare at him blankly. Where do I begin with this?
”Oh.” I blush hard and look down. “We, um. We watched TV and then... went to bed.” I simplified it down a lot.
Draco was just finishing when a tapping at the window broke him out of his reverie. He looked up from the sink, seeing a small tawny owl outside the window carrying a letter. He opened the window, the owl immediately flying in and perching atop one of the cupboards, staring at James. James couldn’t be less interested in the owl.
“But it’ll be painful.” He shrugs it off, swooping down for a snog. “It’s worth it if I get to see your face when you cum.” A warm shiver runs through me at his words and I return his kiss with passion.
“What you said earlier, about why my father liked Sirius so much...” I nodded in understanding. “What did you mean by that?” He cocks his head slightly.
”Your situation? Oh, you mean banging my dad. No thanks.” Scorp meets my gaze through the rear view mirror.
“But I’m sure I could use a friend, if that part of the deal’s still valid?”
“I said your name, kid. Not some made up shit.” I sigh, my stomach twisting.
"Melissa-"
"I'm Officer Waters, that there is officer Stoke. Do you mind giving me your name?" She asked gently. She waited calmly for me to answer.
“Just me and James here,” Draco sighed, smiling, giving the kitten a couple of scratches behind his ear. James mewed in return, jumping down to curl up in the man’s lap. “He turned up one night at the café, injured little stray he is. I’ve had him for a couple of weeks, finally got a collar on him on the way here.”
”That’s not what you were calling him last night.” Teddy chimes in, turning in his seat to face  me. He closes his eyes and tilts his head back. “Oh daddy...” He whines, badly impersonating me.
"No. Yes. Well, I'm a squib," she sighed. "So I know things. Just can't do it."
Melissa handed Draco another package. A small, brown bag, which he opened to reveal a single cookie.
”You never knew Narcissa Black. Why do you think they married me off to your father, such a strict man, couldn’t be more against muggles if he tried.” She muttered, tutting at her late husband before taking a sip of her tea. “Pansy stopped by the other day,” she went on to say. “Asked to view the library.”
I approached him slowly, closely gauging his reactions.
"We've only told him it's a sexual assault case. That's it."
”Don’t get too worried about them. Trust me, if Teddy really wasn’t into it then Scorp would stop going after him.”
"What's wrong with you?" He asked, almost ready to scold himself for talking to an animal. He reached a hand to its back leg, jerking back when the kitten almost hissed at him, baring its teeth. "I don't want to hurt you. You're the one who knocked on my door, after all." As if understanding him, the cat moved forward again and Draco was able to see a deep cut on its leg, blood oozing out slightly.
"Haven't properly dated anyone since my split with Astoria. That was, what? Seven, eight years ago now. Not only that, but mother always complains about how dirty this place is when she comes over. Which is unfair, seeing as she has fucking maids and I have a seventeen year old kid living here."
I took pictures of both the inside and outside of each wrist, my hips, and my thighs. I got both sides of my neck as well. All the images I either had to hold or awkwardly tape a ruler to myself, just as Marcel had requested.
"Who's the lucky fella?" George asked.
”You don’t need it for now. I’ll wash it. Take your nap, I can’t stand lying to my mother.” He winks, before leaving the room holding my clothes from last night. I collapse onto the bed, the smell of Draco on the hoodie carrying me into a deep sleep.
”Nothing? So, I’ll just leave for work and let you carry on your day, running about the gang trying to organise the mess that it is?”
“I’m fine!” I tried to sound convincing, but my voice cracked. “Just tired.” I changed into a pair of joggers and a turtleneck sweater hidden deep in my wardrobe.
”Oh crap. Uh, don’t worry Auntie Cissy. It’s all ok.”
"Thank you," Draco replied softly, relieved.
“Who are you?” Draco almost demanded.
"Get fucked." I throw back, leaning against the counter, glad that Draco's shirt fell down past my mid-thigh, covering my thong. I think I would have died if he saw it. I'm about to say something about him and Teddy when Draco walks in, coming to stand by me.
A knock sounded at the bathroom door and I shut off the shower.
”Can’t believe you deadass left us downstairs so you two bunnies could romp.”
He knocked hurriedly.
Despite being the King, or simply leader as I liked to think, of the Griffin Gang, I didn’t have my own house. Sure, I owned the housing in the area we lived in and usually had first dibs on things, but I hated living alone. Which meant that I shared a house with several other people, namely Longbottom, Thomas, Weasley and Granger.
“Our team of experts will be able to use evidence left on you by the attacker to determine his or her identity. I understand it's not a comfortable experience, but it's our best shot at catching the guy." I was silent as I let the officer half carry me to the police car, and silent still as I was driven back to the police station. Along the way, I listened to the officers speak in various codes back to the station, letting them know of our arrival.
”Do it again!” I moan, wiggling against him.
He looked to them, ignoring the redhead.
Once the two were done eating, Draco let it roam the house as he showered and threw on some more comfortable clothes. After fixing himself a cup of tea and refilling the water bowl for the cat, he settled in on his sofa, flicking on the TV.
”Uh, when we got home, Draco and I went into the lounge. He started watching, uh, TV and I, uh, I was knelt by his feet. Then we went upstairs and he made me sleep in a separate room to him.” She gives me a strange look, and Blaise steps in to explain.
When I wake the next morning, there’s a knocking at the front door. I leave my room and shout to the household, getting someone to answer it quickly. I see Neville rush downstairs to sort it out and while he does I shower.
“Hey, kid. You ok?” I feel him nod his head against my chest, but his shoulders shake gently and I can tell he’s crying. “Hey, listen. You’re with family now. The Griffins are family. And family means no one gets left behind.” He pulls back.
"Well I suppose."
Draco interjected. "Harry lived with me as a cat for a couple months. I didn't realise who he was so of course I opened my home to him. My friends immediately recognised him, but I ignored them, for the most part. But I promised him that if he was really a wizard, then he could stay as long as he liked.
”Called in for paperwork... do
“Officer Goyle. Everything alright?” He asks.
"We were going to get married..."
Draco groaned in frustration. “Look, if the bloke turned up on my front door, who am I to say no? But I’m not hung up about it. I just haven’t had time to date recently. I’m happy with how things are.”  Wasn’t he?
"So where'd you go yesterday? Luna and I were looking everywhere for you."
Harry let out a soft 'oh' of realisation, blushed a little more, and handed his empty mug to Draco, avoiding eye contact after his blunder.
"The guys at the café clubbed together for this. It's not a lot, but..." Melissa trailed off with a shrug, holding a bag out to Draco.
“And your age?”
My mind clicked.
"I didn't know you were working today?"
"You saw the way that officer was towards gang members. What's a better way to hide your crime than to be the officer investigating?"
After he makes us breakfast - which is certainly something to see when he’s buck ass naked - he picks me up bridal style, earning a surprised squeak from me, before carrying me up to his room. He throws me onto his bed and pulls his hoodie off me. My nipples harden at the contact with the cold air and he growls, leaning down to take one in his mouth, rolling the bud between his teeth and he pinches the other between his fingers. I’m a gasping mess by now, hands lost between gripping the bedsheets and wrapping around him, holding him close. He pulls back, capturing my lips in a searing kiss as he rips my panties off me, throwing the torn fabric into a corner of the room without hesitation. I want to make a sound of disappointment at the torn underwear, but when his fingers begin to stroke me I can only moan into his mouth, undulating my hips.
"I... I guess I just want you to be safe, James. You can change back whenever you like. You can stay with me as long as you like, really. I think I'd like the company. But-" Draco was cut off by a small black paw pressing against his lips.
“I don’t remember buzzing anyone into the building,” he announced as he opened the door, ready for conflict. He frowned. “Weasley. Granger. You’re here, at my house.” He processed the situation aloud.
“And a kitten too! Aww, hey baby!” She cooed at James, leaning down to stroke him. James meowed happily, ignoring how Draco very clearly felt about this entire situation. “You look like an old classmate of mine,” she giggled to the cat.
He reached a hand out, grasping mine in it. I brushed my thumb over his knuckles comfortingly. I brought his hand to my mouth, and waited for his reply.
Draco woke the next morning, sunlight streaming through the windows and Harry curled up next to him. Eyes closed softly, jet black hair a soft mess, a stark contrast against the white pillow beneath. Draco sighed contently and raised a hand, gently running his hands through the ravenhead's hair. Just a couple times, enough to satisfy the routine which had built over the past few months, and certainly not enough to wake him.
"I'll just get this packaged up and then I'll try and see if there are any hairs there to collect." When she turned her back to head over to the countertop at the side of the room, Blaise began whispering to me.
Draco had settled into a calmer routine. He evened out his shifts to have more shifts of shorter length so he didn’t have to be away from James for too long, knowing that a cat so young needed love and attention like a human kid would. The only difference being that James could take himself to the toilet.
"Thanks," he smiled, scratching the top of James' head. "I know you don't know what I'm saying, but thanks."
I returned the sympathy and hung up, before collapsing onto my bed. How the hell was I supposed to take the photos?
"Good sleep, baby?" He asks, voice husky.
Unless you’re feeding it.
”No like, blood stuff?” I ask. I hope not. I don’t want any knives near my skin. Blaise shakes his head with a chuckle.
”You missed me?” I nod. “Show me how much you’ve missed me.” He orders confidently. I tilt my head in confusion. He unzips his flies but nothing else. “I said, show me how much you’ve missed me.” I look down at my feet, embarrassed, but move quickly to kneel between his legs. “Good boy.” He praises. A shiver runs down my back. I slowly pull his trousers down, Draco lifting his hips in cooperation before I face his tenting boxers. Slowly, I reach out, pulling them down.
"He does, actually." Harry spared Draco a small glance which Draco savoured. "He loves me more than you ever did, I think."
“Such a good boy.” He whispers into my ear. “I’m so proud of you.” I don’t know why he’s complimenting me, but the praise stirs something deep within me and I find myself blushing.
Luckily, the walk back to my room has us in towels, save for when Draco snatches mine away from me and darts into my room, leaving me buck ass naked in the hallway. I slam my fist down on the closed door loudly, shouting his name, when Seamus appears out of Thomas' room. I cover myself with a hand while the other continues to knock on my own door.
Hi um. Sorry if this one doesn’t seem as good? I want to finish the story but I was just blanking in what to write for this chapter. Hope you enjoy it though, I really do hope to finish this soon!
He filled out the form as best he could, scribbing a question mark or three in the box for the pet's name. Like he'd bloody know that.
Zabini came up to me as I was fixing myself a coffee, about to head out on patrol with Goyle.
“Sorry baby. But you need punishing. And teaching some lessons, apparently.” He lets me out the room and drags me to the front desk. “Tell Zabini that I’m handling Potter, if that’s possible.” He lets the receptionist know with a wink. She smiles, typing on her keyboard, before wishing us a pleasant evening.
Millie didn’t stay for much longer, heading back to work in time for her shift, leaving Draco alone with the cat.
”She almost fixed?”
”Yes, Daddy.”
”I’m fine!” I insisted, punctuating the sentence with a series of sneezes. “Just a sniffle, nothing to worry-” I wasn’t cut off by a deep, hacking cough from my chest, scratching at my throat and causing a horrible bile to rise in my mouth. I spat it out into a tissue before turning back to Draco. “Nothin to worry about,” I smiled, but even I could admit I didn’t even sound well.
”It’s a punishment for a reason. You don’t get daddy’s cock tonight.”
I sat at the table, tapping my fingers on the metal top, for only a few minutes before a woman walked in. She looked mid-forties, with a brunette pixie cut.
"Thanks, mum." Ron said, fixing his hair as soon as her back was turned on us.
She sat beside me, an arm around my shoulder playing with my hair, keeping me warm and comforting me for about ten minutes, until I could hear sirens. A pair of heavy footsteps rang down the alley, before two police officers stood in front on me. One immediately knelt beside me and the other took the Alyssa to the side for a minute.
The ravenhead was sitting on the edge of the bed looking concerned, his head in his hands. At the mention of his name, his head jerked up and he rushed over to Draco.
“Please daddy!” Scorp joins in.
“Nah, mate. Don’t care who you’re fuckin’. Just want to know what that was in the hallway just now.” Weasley sits up.
“Miss Hayley Lily Potter. 19 years old. Female. With a vagina.” He speaks bluntly. I can’t contain my anger and slam my hands on the table.
“Not to sound like a horny teen,” he begins. I roll my eyes with a smile. “But I need a fuck, man. But no one out there seems to want to go out with a gang member. I thought chicks loved the bad boy act?” I don’t know any chicks, but I think I know someone who he could get to know.
"We all know Hogwarts wouldn't have allowed a squib to enroll," Draco pointed out. "As lovely as it seems there, the only squibs allowed are the groundskeepers. Plus, even if Millie had been allowed to enroll, aside from the few classes she would have found useful, the student body wasn't as accepting as squibs as you seem to remember."
“That someone in you better be me.” He said, his grip on my asscheeks tightening.
“Yes, but if you keep talking then you’ll be making a sharp exit out of the closest window. Now, goodnight.”
“Want to tell us what that was about, mate?” Weasley asks from one of the sofas.
“Neville, I think Mione has your share.” He looks at me with a nod before exiting the kitchen and heading off to find the girl. We all notice Zabini staring at his ass as he leaves. As soon as Neville is out of ear shot, I quickly grab Zabini’s collar and shove him against the wall.
"You're still the same, naïve idiot from school." Draco deadpanned.
”Sorry I didn’t come around sooner. Some things popped up.” He explains.
"The big things, the small things. I like seeing how much he's grown since Hogwarts, how he's become a better person. I like how he knows how I take my coffee. How he doesn't get out of bed until I'm awake because he doesn't want to wake me. How sometimes he still goes to put a bowl of water out for James. How he's honest with me. About everything. How he doesn't treat me any differently because of my past, because of
Draco almost laughed. “Of course. My employee Melissa would probably throw a fit, but I’d miss him like mad. It’s only been a few days, but it’s nice to come home to someone. Even if it’s just a cat. Sometimes I feel like he understands me, y’know?”
"I did everything but wipe your arse, of course it was fun." Draco replied, but there was not real bite to his tone.
That was, until, he noticed James moving. Wriggling in his sleep, hissing, scratching at something that wasn’t there. Panicking, Draco threw his book down and tried his best to wake the cat.
James slipped into the cloak, brushing against Draco's legs before popping his head out.
"When you said you find me attractive-" the ravenhead called after Draco, who slammed the bedroom door shut between them in response.
James meowed boldy, running over to him. Rather than waiting for Draco to pick him up, the small kitten began his own ascent of the stairs, slowly taking one at a time due to his small stature.
When we arrive at the party later that night, it’s already in full swing. We climb out of our cars - we being Longbottom, Weasley, Granger, Thomas and Finnegan, and Ginny and Lovegood - and head inside. There are cheers when we walk into the house, and the wildly lit building is busy with activity. Most of the Serpents are here, as well as a few from the Bloodskulls and the Rooks, most of whom are wearing their gang’s clothing.
"I lived in this huge mansion. Black wallpaper, dark wood furnishings. None of this muggle electricity either. It was gloomy on a good day. Storms turned the house pitch black, thunder seemed to echo down the hallways and lightning made the coats in my wardrobe look like boggarts, although they look like what you fear most, so- never mind." He shook his head smiling, getting off track while talking to a kitten was a feat. "My mother tried her best to calm me, but soon I realised I had to stop being scared of storms because there were worse things to be scared off. At Hogwarts, I put on a brave face. And at home, the storm was the last thing keeping me up at night.
Harry rolled his eyes and lightly slapped Draco's arm.
”Fuck, baby. Like that.” I give a few more tentative licks, along the base of the shaft and around the head, loving the way he praises me with each action. I take the tip into my mouth, swirling the tongue around it for a second before sliding down and taking as much of it as I could into my mouth. I’m barely halfway down when I feel it hit the back of my throat. My gag reflex kicks in immediately and I splutter around the member in my mouth. I pull back, looking apologetically up at Draco. He leans forward slightly, cupping my face in one of his hands. “You’re doing fantastic, baby.”
"Hey 'Mione."
When I look to daddy, he’s no longer watching what’s on TV, instead he’s watching me wriggle about on the plug with a smirk on his face. His hand is still gripped on his cock, moving up and down the shaft slowly. I look at it wantonly, but he shakes his head at me.
”Hi Harry.” Luna’s soft voice makes me jump, and I turn to face her.
want to see you two sucking face. Or worse.”
“Oh um. Well. I. My legal name isn’t. Umm...”
”Wow, you really are ill,” He chuckled. I frowned at him, and looked to my desk, picking up a black pouch which sat in the centre. “What’s that?” He enquired, making his way over to me.
”This isn’t some wizard school, but sure kid. Hufflepuff.” I lead him up to his room, and Draco mills about downstairs for a minute before following us up. “This is your room. Decorate it how you like. If you need anything just ask, Alright?” He nods. “Do you want me to stay for a bit or are you ok on your own?”
Draco frowned, shrugged, and went back to his coffee.
He woke the nest morning to a small weight on his chest, opening his eyes to see James sitting on him, waiting for him to wake up.
It’s two days since Teddy had arrived and he had taken to the gang like fish to water. Despite his history of staying locked in his room, Teddy was almost always talking to someone. Everyone was eager to meet him. They - including Teddy himself - knew that it wasn’t most likely he would take over from me if something happened, and they didn’t disagree with my choice. His charismatic nature meant everyone was friendly with him and was glad he had joined.
"Tyler. Tyler Joseph."
"James?" He called again. He hadn't let the cat out, given that it was so hot outside, and hadn't seen him rush out when he came home.
“I won’t hesitate to bend you over right here and fuck you. I’ll fuck you anywhere, I don’t care.” I gulp at his forewardness, and at how clearly he speaks. Anyone in the house could hear him. “Imagine what the Griffins would think if they saw their great and glorious leader taking it up the ass, being pounded into by a police officer of all people.”
“Don’t think for one second I don’t want to fuck you.” He says inbetween kisses. “It took so much in me not to just fuck you on that car bonnet when I arrested you last night.” He adds with a growl. I moan as he attaches his lips to mine again, before letting them trail across my jawline and down my throat. I feel myself throbbing with want. Not even the danger of being seen with him is bothering me. Not that anyone would care. I’m the Griffin King, if I want to get off with someone down an alley, then I fucking will.
”Fine!” I repeated, angrily. I calmed a little, before making grabby hands at the syringe still in his hand. “Gimme!”
"Morning, Melissa," he smiled back. "Feeling alright?"
"Draco..." Jen started, clearly more worried and scared than Draco was by the ordeal.
Draco shook his head. "Officer Goyle is riding with me today. Smart, but a twat all the same. I'm sure you remember." Mm. I certainly remembered the knobhead. "Some evidence has been found that suggests the arresting officer that's night was actually the murderer. We've no concrete evidence so far, but honestly no one is surprised. We can't prosecute until we get some stronger evidence, like camera footage, or if we get enough witness statements and she finally admits to it. But it's all moving in the right direction!" He smiled.
If we could finally find out who murdered Marcus, then perhaps the police force would stop looking down on us gangs. So many had been dragged into questioning, even my own people, when we all knew it was one of the officers. Only a handful of officers respected us because of our connections to them, and even then it wasn't only out of respect to their coworkers. Hell, maybe even finding out who the murderer was could bring the gangs closer. Show us that none of us were each others' enemy.
"Hey, thats okay baby. I get if you didn't want to seem rude."
”What about my thong?” I ask, feeling embarrassed all of a sudden.
He woke early the next morning, as always on his days off, and, knowing it would be pointless to try to get back to sleep, he headed downstairs and turned on his filter coffee machine. Not wanting to wait long for a cup of joe, he poured a cup as soon as enough had gone though, adding milk and just a little sugar to taste. He went about opening the curtains in his flat and other menial chores until he was interrupted by the black cat again, once more pawing at the front door.
“I know you clean yourselves. Right after you bend round and lick your own arseholes! I don’t need that in my breakfast!” Draco laughed, ruffling the top of James’ head before washing his hands.
"You sure, baby boy?"
“Potter.” Blondie speaks, voice full of authority. The way he said my name… if only there were less people here… and fewer clothes. “Your friend is here to pick you up. I suggest you hurry for his sakes. Officer Zabini is struggling to keep it in his pants.” I’m let out of the cell, sending a wave to Seamus, before I’m lead to the front desk, where Longbottom is waiting for me. He’s leaning against the desk, a furious blush across his face as the officer who helped apprehend me earlier chatting him up, who I assume to be Zabini. The officer is about to lean down to whisper something in his ear when Neville spots me and hurries over.
“I got a front row seat.” Finnegan points out. “I thought I was gonna die.”
Everyone but Draco gave her a strange look, causing her to quickly explain with a sad sigh.
I sat on the side of the bathtub, letting the tears run down my face.
Harry muttered a quiet "thanks" as Draco set down a plate of food, to which Draco hardly replies.
“You remember Neville Longbottom?”
”It’s all peachy.” The blond smirks, poking Teddy with his foot.
His hand hit me hard, making my head throb.
"How fucking DARE you!" I shouted, spitting in his face. "You worthless piece of shit. I trusted you. I thought you were a friend." Goyle only smiled at me, his eyes gleaming. With my free arm, I punched him in the gut, earning a groan of pain. "You disgust me." I spat at him. "You don't even deserve to be alive right now."
"Honestly, it's a wonder why they haven't fired you from the force. You're a shitty police officer." I walk over to him and blow the smoke into his face, before holding it out to him. He takes it after a second of hesitaition, putting it to his lips experimentally. "Breathe it in, hold it for a few, then exhale." I instruct, before turning to make the bed. It's barely a second when I hear him coughing, and a smile crosses my face. I turn to him, his face red from the coughing. I take it from him, and make sure he's looking at what I do. I inhale the smoke deeply, before holding it in my lungs for a couple seconds and letting the chemicals flood my system and then exhale through my lips, aiming at his face, which scrunches up at my action. "You just need some practice."
“Harry. Harry James Potter.” I say, a small smile etching onto my lips.
“Blaise wants to meet...” he mumbled, sitting at the kitchen table. James jumped down from where he was sitting as Draco continued thinking aloud. “3 o’clock at the Leaky Cauldron. Reckon I should go, James?”
"Not properly dated anyone? Do I not count?" I slip my arms around his neck.
“One.” And then one on my right cheek. “Two.” I take a sharp breath in. He slaps me twice, once on each cheek, and then once again on the left, but slightly further down so it’s mostly on my thigh. I let out a yelp. “Five.” A quarter done. Even by now my ass was stinging, and I wanted it to stop. Another two spanks in quick succession, and slowly the pain ebbs away as pleasure begins to mask it. “Seven. Eight” He adds as he slaps my ass again. I fail to hold back a small moan. “Oh yes, that’s right. You’re a little pain slut aren’t you?” He chuckles. “That’s alright. Once we finish this I’ll have to find some other punishments for you.”
"How fucking
“Well if you’d given me an hour or so I could have come to get it.” He gives me a strange look, like he thinks I don’t understand what he’s saying. I quirk my eyebrow, making eye contact with him. “You obviously don’t want to act on that promise you made though. Bringing my car to me, not having me arrested for all the illegal shit going on around here. Trying anything to make sure I don’t go to the police station again. I mean, it’s beginning to make me think that-” I’m quickly cut off as he grabs my arm, pulling me to him before he captures my lips in his. He bites my bottom lip and I gasp, opening my mouth for him to slip his tongue into it.
Blaise pulled a disgusted face. "He said that to you? Fucking hell."
“King?” Teddy’s voice sounds amazed.
"Harry I'm going to murder you, Merlin as my witness." Draco grumbled, turning to face away from him. Harry frowned but mentally shrugged it off. He leaned over Draco's side, placing an arm either side of the man to keep balance and leaning close to his face.
“Finally you’re home, da- Oh.” I stop midsentence when, instead of Draco, I see Scorp entering the house.
"No, I was just... perusing while I was waiting. I can't really picture you as a fan of anyone other than Wilde though," he added with a smile.
”That was amazing, baby. I’m so proud of you. We’re definitely doing that again.” He smiles, before leaning in to kiss me. He wraps his arms around me before switching our positions, making me lie back on the bed. He motions for me to scoot further up, so I shuffle until my head hits the pillow. “I think you deserve a little something.” He grins. He signals from me to lot my arms and pulls my shirt off, taking a minute to look at all the scars.
"I'm an idiot that you love."
“She hates us.” I shrug. “I think your gran wants me gone. I’d better head off.” I’m about to leave the house when Teddy tugs on my sleeve. I stop in my tracks, turning to face him.
“Harry, did you get the- oh, sorry. Guests.” Hermione smiles, standing at the foot of the stairs. I spare a glance at Malfoy before turning to her.
“Uhm, Ok. It’s a bit funny because he’s awful at cooking, but makes the best pancakes. You wake up and can smell them throughout the entire house. But after that we just sat watching TV for a bit, I think we were watching Spongebob, but I was just going through some emails for work. Then the doorbell rang and I went to answer it.”
"Sorry to interrupt."
(See the end of the chapter for
“The whole house knows you two are fucking and yet you blush because we saw you two kiss. You’re insane.” Malfoy comments.
When Scorp drops us off, I pull Teddy to the side before he disappears to his houses.
”Oh, this is why I had to stay in the car? Fucking hell dad, sorry.” ‘Scorp’ gives me a small wave before rushing back outside.
tiptoes to close the distance. Draco's mind barely had time to register what was happening when Harry's lips pressed against his. Draco's pressed back, trying to hold back after years of waiting for this moment.
Finally in bed again, he relaxed as he watched the kitten sit on his chest and play around with his hair. There was something amusing about the way James chased the blonde locks that fell onto Draco's face.
“Harry? Harry is that you?” Thomas calls from the living room. I walk in to the dark room, curtains closed and TV playing some action film. The air is thick with smoke and smells of weed and something sweet. Thomas is curled up on one end of the long sofa, and an unexpected guest is scooted at the other end of it.
"Are you a...?" He asked quietly.
“No, he doesn’t use his litter tray,” Draco mumbled for the second time, slightly weirded out by the fact that she wanted to know that of all things.
"What should I do?"
”What’s happening? Why’re you all so worried?” I ask once she pulls back.
The Griffins owned a small estate on the far side of town. Before I took over from my godfather, they lived in a caravan park in horrible conditions. With the money my parents had left me, as well as money from our… business, I had bought the gang a series of houses on a small estate. Several large houses, with several people living in each. It wasn’t a family gang. People who joined were people who needed a family, who needed the support. But there weren’t many actual families. Sure, we had the odd sibling, but the lack of parents and children made it so housing was much like Uni dorms – or so I had been told. I had left school after college and didn’t get a further education. Or at least I didn’t plan on it. I still had some time, I suppose.
"James." He tried once more, growing impatient with worry.
“See you later.” Longbottom replies. Zabini lifts an eyebrow. “Sir.” He adds. Zabini leaves the house and Longbottom turns, jumping a bit when he sees Draco and I. “Oh, hi guys.” He blushes.
We head straight for the kitchen to get drinks, something strong preferably, before heading to a room with the loudest music in. I see Finnegan immediately begin chatting to some of the lads in the room and something flickers in Thomas’ eyes, but the Irish lad only seems to be being platonic. If you can call a sly hand on their chest platonic. Once they finish conversing, I head over to the guy and ask how he knows Finnegan.
"Go have a few minutes outside, I'm sure it's cooler out there," Draco offered, understanding how they felt.
"Daddy, I'm gonna-" I cried, his fingers moving deftly on my sex.
"Nothing's coming up," the vet came back to him. "Must be a stray; no collar, no chip. It's very healthy for a stray though, especially this young. It can barely be a year old, and it's very small even for that age."
”He’s into a fair amount. I’m surprised he only ever did missionary with Astoria.” I frown, but assume it’s his ex-wife.
"I always admired your bravery." He started. "I hated Gryffindors but I always admired how brave
“This is Millie, she’s a friend.” He looked to her, “Millie, this is Narcissa. My mother.”
Blaise was silent, but I saw fury flicker across his face. He nodded curtly, before leaving.
When I went downstairs, I could hear voices in the living room, but I headed to the kitchen to avoid them. Unfortunately, my smartest friend and gang member was stood making herself a coffee.
"Bugger off," Was the chuckled reply. Harry kept looking above, as if eye contact between them would make talking harder. "I saw a side of you I never thought I'd get to see. I didn't have to worry about being 'The Boy Who Lived'. I could just wake up every day with no expectations placed on me." He brought a hand up to play with the collar that was still around his neck. "I was just James. Nothing more, nothing less. But I guess that's the end of that, right?"
“Bye, baby doll.” Zabini smiles after pulling away.
"Harry asked me not to say anything," he said, seeing my rage.
”Draco’s my boyfriend...”
“Harry I need specific details here. I’m really sorry but if you don’t give us good enough evidence we will have to take you in for questioning.”
”Yes. Correct.” I smile. Only ten. “Ten for each.” I whimpered. He pulled my panties down so they fell to my ankles. “I’ll count them today. If this has to happen again, it’ll be your responsibility.” I nod in reply.
TRIGGER WARNING: rape, sexual assault. Please, please do not read if this affects you. I’ll get the next chapter up as soon as I can so you can skip this!
I shrug. “Age aside, you obviously didn’t come just to drop my car off. I could have come to get it from the police station.” I lean against the wall opposite him.
As I left the cell, I saw Captain Snape standing by, clearing having watched the 'show'.
"Harry," he interrupted. Draco positively glared at him before resuming.
"But you let her. Let her get her hands all over you." He was stepping close and I had my back to the door by now. He slammed a hand against it, leaning on it and trapping me. "You're mine." His voice was almost a growl by now, and I wouldn't be surprised if everyone on the estate could hear him. "Mine." He repeated, quieter this time, before leaning down to catch my lips in a hot kiss, biting at my bottom lip as he pulled away before leaning again. I let out a whimper that had been trapped in my throat and keened under him. His free hand held my wasit, before sliding down to cover my ass protectively, stating ownership in some way. I let him. His tongue slipped into my mouth, dominating me in every way and I felt my breath get heavy before he leaned back slowly.  I felt like I should say something in the silence, but my words were stuck in my throat, so I stood up on my tip toes and pressed my lips to his, more gently this time, returning the feeling. He began to move his ministrations along my jawline, before reaching my ear. He bit the lobe gently, tugging on it slightly before moving below the ear and sucking on my skin gently, using his teeth to mark me. I moaned softly, and let my hands reach behind his neck and bury themselves in his hair to steady myself.
”I’d hope not.” Draco mutters.
“Tch. Of course.” I lightly shove Weasley’s shoulder. “Be my chauffeur?” He rolls his in response, but nods.
“Yeah, an adult cat. If Harry were an animagus cat, you’d think he’d also be an adult?”
He reached inside, pulling out a bottle of Irish Cream with a soft laugh, before hugging the woman.
”You’re so perfect, baby. So good for me.” He whispers huskily into my ear, before tugging on the lobe. I whimper as he pulls the plug out of me, but don’t notice him lube himself up as his mouth attaches to my neck, kissing and sucking at the skin. I let out a yelp when he slips the head of his cock into me, but as he buries himself to the hilt I moan loudly in unison with him. When he doesn’t start moving I wiggle my ass.
When Harry looked up, he smiled at him, putting the book down not bothering to mark the page. "You're done." In hindsight it probably was meant to be more of a question, but Harry seemed a little too excited for it to be so.
were. Your determination, your willingness to never back down. It got you damn well near killed most times. It was something I envied." He swallowed as he sensed Harry turn to face him.
“H-hey Luna.”
“It is. But we’re not the type of people to stick to rules around here.” I reply.
”Hi Harry! Hello Officer Malfoy.” She grins. I wave to her. “Andromeda called; Teddy’s on his way now.”
"Harry?" He calls, and I immediately rush to see him. He encases me in his arms and I nuzzle into his chest. "Sorry I had to leave for work, baby. I really didn't want to." He pecks me on the forehead before looking up and seeing the other two officers, as well as Zabini. "Officer Hughes, Officer Meade." He nods to the woman, and then the man, before turning back to me. "By the way, Harry." His tone was serious. He was speaking to me as a gang leader rather than as his boyfriend. "There are some Serpents outside. I don't know what they want, you ought to be careful."
"Harry how are you-"
“Hm. And what if it’s not?”
She hummed lightly, clearly not believing him but giving up on the argument.
“King of the Griffin gang, caught fer speeding of all things? Pah!” I give him a look, wondering how he knows who I am. “Don’t be surprised. That scar on yer forehead gives it all away.”
"Sorry daddy." I look over my shoulder for a second, making eye contact with him. When he starts to press a third finger into me, my head drops, but doesn't press into the bed, and I let out a moan for him. He repeats his actions from before, except with the third finger as well this time. When he pulls his fingers out of me, I let out a small sound of annoyance and he chuckles softly.
”Harry?” Daddy shouts. I run over to appear at the bottom of the stairs, mug still in hand. I look up to where he’s standing at the top, stark naked. I blush at the site and he rushes down to hug me. “Jesus I thought you’d left.” He explains when he pulls back. “God, you look so adorable in my hoodie.” He adds, taking in my appearance.
"Let me hear you, baby. Don't worry about everyone else. Let daddy hear your beautiful voice." He scolds.
"Good morning, Draco!" A woman called to his right. He turned to see one of his employees just entering the cafe, ready to open up for the day.
Draco stopped in his tracks and turned around. "I do not
As the evening passed by, Draco didn't feel much like moving. Instead, he and James lay in bed together, Draco switching between stroking James' back and scratching below his ears, which always earned a loud purr from the kitten.
“Shut up,” I smirked back. “I’m fine.”
"Yes, it's gone midnight. Do you want dinner now, or are you going to wait until morning? I'm having a lie-in though since it's my day off."
A voice started shouting from within. "If there're carol singers at this time of night I'm going to- Potter?"
”That kid is so fucking hot and he
"Potter."
He slipped out of bed, leaving for the kitchen. Normally James - James? Harry? his flatmate? - would have been up, but perhaps a cat on the run is more of a light sleeper.
He spent a few minutes watching over Harry before reluctantly tearing himself away, leaving a note before heading back down to the café and his waiting coworker.
He let the sheets fall, revealing a turtleneck sweater which looked like it hadn't been washed in days.
“Harry!” He throws his arms around me quickly, before letting me inside the house.
"Who do you belong to?" He growled, looking up to meet my eyes.
I closed the door behind me and sat on the end of the bed. I didn't know how to say what I was about to say.
"Harry, that's not been washed in days," I said with a soft chuckle. "Take mine." I said, pulling off my own sweater. He put it on quickly, the sleeves covering his hands because of the size difference. He climbed into the bed, kneeling beside me for a moment, pausing in thought, before going to sit in my lap.
“Wow! You really are tactless.” I look through the doorway of the kitchen to make sure no one is around. “But okay. Draco.” I test how his name feels on my tongue.
"I'm going to the Weasley's tomorrow, but I know Draco has a day off. I was thinking maybe you and Scorp could spend the day with him. He's been pretty busy recently so it might be nice if he got to spend some time with you guys."
”The Narcissa Malfoy I know would have never gone to either of those.” Draco commented, sitting down opposite her and handing her a mug.
“My gender? Was that not obvious? What’s my dick got to do with this? Sorry I didn’t realise I was at a speed dating event. How many siblings do you have? Any pet peeves?” I could tell my voice was growing louder.
"Yeah. Heard you were out in Egypt. How was that?"
The cottage was small. He could see lights on in the house and a roaring fireplace in the living room. Knees weakening from the cold, he tried his luck, prying open the gate and kicking snow out of the way as he made his way down the path, too cold and tired to even lift his feet.
”You’d have me following orders in no time, daddy.” I whisper. He smiles, before pressing a kiss to my forehead. He lets me go before calling someone.
They gave me a ride there, Gin and Luna going in a separate car. The drive was a couple hours, but I was glad to finally spend some time with just Ron and Hermione. We'd been friends since the first bus ride to school, and had been by each others' sides ever since.
“A long time ago, long before you or I were born, a man and his friends created a gang. He and his friends had often been ignored by family members, Hell, this guy was practically hated by his family. They knew what it was like to only have your closest friends to turn to, or to have someone close betray you.” I took a breath. “This man was Sirius Black, a distant relative of yours, and my godfather. And his friends, James Potter and Lily Evans, my parents, as well as Peter Pettigrew and your father, Remus Lupin.”
“Oh god,” I whispered to myself, shock filling me. I jumped in the car and looking at my neck in the mirror. Sure enough, dark bruises where his hand had grasped my neck, and some smaller ones on my chin from where he had held it roughly. Tears were running down my face before I knew it, and a sob wracked through my body.
“I...” I begin, trailing off. “In my ass.” I say quietly. He steps forward again, placing his mug on the counter and brining me into a hug.
“Nothin’.” He shrugs. “Name’s Seamus.” He holds a hand out. I take it cautiously before shaking it once.
“I’ll do my best.” He answered. “But just so you know, he has a couple days off in a bit. I think maybe tomorrow, or the day after. So I can’t promise, but I will try.”
“What can I say, I run a tight ship and everyone else does as told.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“James is an odd cat. Doesn’t use his litter tray, always goes outside where I can’t see him, never uses his bed, always sleep on mine, even when I’m in it. Plus he doesn’t care for his toys. Honestly sometimes I think he’s more interested in the TV.”
Draco cut him off, placing a finger to his lips, as he studied the man before him. The years had been kind to the both of them, it seemed.
The rest of the afternoon passed with Melissa nudging Draco, throwing looks towards Harry and raising her eyebrows. When she finished her shift in the early evening, Draco was almost glad to have the shop to himself.
He dressed quickly, not bothering with breakfast but instead giving the cat some more tuna - he was going to run out quickly at this rate.
"Why not?"
Harry even waited for him to finish locking up before they headed up the single flight of stairs to Draco's home together.
A few days later, Draco was at work in his café. It had been an early start, a busy opening shift, and now he was hoping for the afternoon to go smoothly so it was a peaceful start for whoever took over for the evening shift.
"Ronald, honestly. There's no need to be so rude. Harry and Draco can be as loud as they wish." Granger scolded her boyfriend.
”Thank you, Officer Zabini. Terribly sorry about that Harry. I’m sure you can understand that we really do not want to charge you for a crime you didn’t commit.” I nod and she and the other officer begin to leave, just as another officer walks in through the front door.
”Maybe invite Teddy. Trust me, Scorp is going to bug us a lot if we don’t distract him.” I nod. After giving me Seamus’ number, he gives me a quick peck on the cheek before exiting, leaving me stood blushing like a mess.
”Please! Draco, please do it again!”
When the two women arrived, I hung back at the bottom of the stairs while Draco answered the door. The two boys were nowhere to be seen, so I could only presume they were in Scorp’s room.
"Yeah." My own voice is croaky from sleep. I lean over and press a kiss to his cheek. "Sorry about the thing, daddy." I whispered, talking about Cho.
”I just said it’s a punishment.” He reminds me. I let out a whimper and glare at my thighs but within a few seconds his legs widen. He motions for me to kneel between them and I move hurriedly, the plug in my ass wiggling with my movement. “Open wide.” He commands, and I do so quickly, almost over enthusiastic for him. He chuckles and continues to jerk off. After a few more seconds, he lets out a grunt as he reaches his climax’s, shooting ropes of cum over my face. Most of it lands in my open mouth, but I can feel some of it in my hair and on my forehead, as well as down my chin and cheeks. I grimace slightly at the bitter taste - as best as I can with my mouth still wide open - and wait for him to say anything else. He nods at me, and I swallow it, still tasting it in my mouth.
Draco follows me downstairs after a few seconds, and I’m greeted by Weasley, Granger, Thomas and Finnegan when I enter the living room.
"He's called Draco. He's a police officer."
”Daddy please.” I sigh, my voice barely a whisper. He hears me, however, and brings a hand down on my right asscheek sharply, making a loud smack noise. I yelp at the shock, but not the pain.
”His son gave me a lift home today. He wasn’t there with us but he can confirm I was there this morning. I’m not sure who else.” I trail off.
"Nothing happened." I replied, much too quickly. "Just wanted to go for a walk is all. Probably just the stress of Marcus' death." She nodded, silent for a second.
”I’m Harry, Draco’s boyfriend.” I introduce, holding out a hand. Ignoring that, both women bring me into a tight hug and I’m taken by surprise.
"You don't need to pay me back, it's on the house." Draco reassured him. "Go sit down, I'll bring you something in a minute."
”Draco.” I sit up slightly to be closer to him. “It’s fine. It’s all taken care of.” He gives a strange look, before kissing my forehead with a smile.
“Thank you, Harry.” She stopped the tape recorder. “On a less official note, it’s horrible to think that, possibly, someone who I work with has done this. It’s disgusting. Please, don’t be offended at me saying ‘possibly’. It’s not that I don’t believe you. I do. It’s just, in my line of work we can’t go forward without that DNA evidence - of which I’m sure will be a match to who you say it is.
”Take a nap, baby. I’ll be right here when you wake up.” I feel his lips against my forehead before I slip into a deep sleep.
"Uh, cat?" He called, poking his head out of the room. He saw the black kitten standing on the bottom shelf of his coffee table, peering out under it at him with a mischevious look in its eyes. "You want something to eat?" He asked and, in reply, the cat mewed, before bounding over as best as it could, the limp more prominent with speed.
"Officer Gregory Goyle," she muttered, tapping a couple keys in her keyboard. "Arrested on sexual assault charges."
“Officers. What brings you here today?” They all turn to face me, a look of relief crossing Longbottoms face.
"I mean, I've seen some stuff in my time. Never thought I'd meet a cat who understood English. Unless, of course, I'm going mad." He added thoughtfully. The kitten rubbed against his leg again. He looked down at it, thinking for a minute. "Meow if you understand me."
”Oh, I’m 19.” She’s silent for a second.
“There’s medicine, some water and also a chamomile tea. I added some honey because I know you’re never keen on herbal teas. Also I’m putting a temporary ban on weed for you, only until you’re better.”
"Baby boy, nothing could ever change the way I feel about you."
Draco made the vet her drink quickly as possible, insisting on giving it to her for free, before going to sit at a table with her, thanking Jen as he did.
“OK, I’m sorry. But I needed time to heal. You weren’t the only one who lost things in the war, you know. I lost my parents too. And yes, I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you, OK?”
He sighed, "I don't want to say yeah but..."
"Yes, and I thought I could deal with it. I thought maybe I could make you understand me if I kept telling you. But you ignored me, time after time. You wanted to rush into marriage and rush into having kids, and I didn't even know if you actually loved me."
"Hi," was all Draco could muster up once Harry pulled away. Partially because he was out of breath, and partially because his mind had been rendered useless.
As he shoved inside of me, I had to stop myself from throwing up. Every inch of my being wanted to shed it's top layer as he grabbed me sharply.
just opposite the playpark."
"I'm fine. If I wasn't I wouldn't be wearing them." I reply, my voice hushed.
"What d'you want, Scorp? I already gave you this week's allowance.” Draco turns from his spot on the stairs.
