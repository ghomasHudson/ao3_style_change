Draco found vaguely familiar, laughing at the camera – and stopped on a photo of himself atop a broomstick. Draco watched as Harry sped around the
“I think we’ve all grown up a lot since then,” Draco replied calmly, relaxing as Maddie warily took her seat. He glanced at Granger and felt a spark of
They stood there like that, under the water as they regained breath. Malfoy’s hands traced circles on Harry’s hips and Harry finally got a chance to touch Malfoy’s pale skin, his fingers trailing over biceps and shoulders and running over dusky pink nipples. He discovered that Malfoy was ticklish if you stroked him in just the right place under his armpit, that he flushed down to his chest after he came and that his hair turned a breath-taking shade of gold when wet. This could be mine, Harry thought. And the thing was, he wasn’t so sure that he didn’t want it anymore.
“So,” Maddie interrupted loudly, catching Draco’s eye and sending him a small, reassuring smile, “is anyone hungry? I’m absolutely famished. I reckon there
“Oh, darling. You look absolutely wonderful.” Narcissa Malfoy appeared next to her son and kissed him on both cheeks.
“I hope you weren’t planning on keeping this a secret,” Draco said almost nervously, as if he thought that the unwanted attention would frighten Harry away.  “It’s going to be all over the school by dinnertime that we were here together.”
Harry chuckled. Yes, this Malfoy was definitely not what he had expected but, as the evening wore on, as they demolished curries and rice and naan and settled down with a bottle of wine, Harry began to realise that this might be the Malfoy he wanted.
Beginning to panic, Harry quickly grabbed his wand, threw on a t-shirt and pair of tracksuit trousers that looked as if they belonged to him and tiptoed out onto the landing. The music was louder here and, when he listened closely enough, Harry could just about hear someone moving around downstairs. He inched down the stairs, his wand braced in front of him. As he crept down the last step and into the ground floor hallway of Grimmauld Place, Harry nearly screamed when a voice beside him spoke.
“Thanks for the coffee, Harry,” she smiled, placing a hand lightly on his arm. “You're such a lovely guy. I'm so happy that we're friends.”
“Just shove off, Malfoy,” Potter said, grabbing Weasley by the arm and dragging him away.  “Come on, Ron.  He’s not worth it.”
He looked around in panic but the tube was already moving, the track underneath squealing as metal moved on metal. He held out a hand, as if with enough willpower he could magically keep the tube in place, but the platform disappeared in a rush along with the man.
“Harry!  Are you alright, mate?” Ron shouted, rushing to his friend's side.  Harry nodded causing the redhead to punch him on the arm.  "That was absolutely brilliant!  We've really got a chance at the Quidditch Cup now!"
I might as well just come out and say it, Draco thought as he sat down beside her and took a sweet from the bag. “I think I might have found a way to
Harry snorted, secretly pleased at the compliment.  “Oh!  I nearly forgot,” he exclaimed, rummaging around in his bag and pulling out a bundle of green and silver material.  “I still have your scarf.”

without something inside of him falling apart. Hell, he’d barely left the hospital in the past few days. He deserved some time off.
When Harry arrived at Hogwarts the next morning, he could feel the butterflies churning in his stomach.  He had always been dreadful at small talk.  The only reason he had managed to avoid making an idiot of himself at the numerous Ministry events over the summer was because of Hermione and her amazing ability to talk to just about anybody.
He slipped his hand into the crook of her elbow, the nerves flooding back at full force as Maddie and Hermione positioned themselves in front of him,

She stuck her tongue out at him and rolled her eyes. “It was a perfectly normal day. We had a lovely time shopping and stopped by that delightful little café for a drink and some cake. I never knew you had such a sweet tooth, Draco, the amount of treacle tart you shovelled down!”
Wishing beyond anything that he could believe that, could believe that Harry might see past the mistakes he had made and see the man he was now, Draco
“Er, right,” Draco said, focusing intently on the board. “As I was saying, you want to move your rook here because… er…” his brain turned to mush as he
As soon as Harry stepped into The Sleeping Dragon he knew he had made a grave mistake.  The owners had obviously gone to the extreme for Valentine’s Day, Harry thought as he eyed the bright pink streamers and bunches of mistletoe hanging from the ceiling.  Hell, there was even a giant teddy bear, complete with the most ridiculous bow tie he had ever seen, sitting by the bar.  Honestly, the place looked as if a unicorn had thrown up on it.

Harry gulped. What exactly was this? Draco was so easy to talk to and Harry thought about him all the time. They'd talked about everything – his parents, his shitty upbringing, his new life in London. Even things Harry hadn't shared with Ron and Hermione.
Draco turned onto a quiet side street, scuffing his shoes against the pavement. He knew he was being childish but that horrible, lingering feeling of being lost was back and he didn't know what else to do.
Malfoy pushed off from the doorframe and sauntered over to crowd Harry against the wall. He placed his hands on Harry’s sides, scratching his fingernails lightly over ribs, and pushed his hips forward to meet Harry’s. “This is what it does to me,” Malfoy almost growled in his ear.
Maddie leaned in. “You haven’t been to see him all morning. You’re not avoiding him are you?” she asked. “You seemed so fond of him yesterday.”

thoughts. This whole situation was so fucked up. To fall in love with someone, to actually think you have a chance with them, and then have it snatched
Draco smiled. “Yeah, of course,” he said, pulling out a chair for Harry who grinned and made his way round the desk.
Draco let out a bark of a laugh, all of the tension from the evening leaving him.  In another uncharacteristic moment of bravery, and almost without conscious decision, he leaned down and brushed his lips softly against Harry’s.  Draco panicked when Harry tensed briefly in surprise but relaxed as he felt Harry’s smile against his lips and heard him sigh with pleasure.  He pulled away minutely and, noticing that his hand was still stroking through Harry’s thick hair, smiled down at the beautiful man below him.
he’d be an expert at wandless magic, Draco managed to think through the haze as Harry’s suddenly very lubricated hand grasped both of their cocks together,
Draco stretched his arms above his head, trying to ease the crick in his back – the result of being bent over paperwork for the last hour – and looked at
The more he looked around, the more Harry grew to think that there was something very, very wrong. Unfamiliar clothes and shoes were dotted around the room, paintings that he’d never seen before were hanging on the walls and, even more unnerving, there was the sound of music coming from downstairs.
When Malfoy pulled away, Harry only just managed to hold in the groan. “I’ve got an idea,” Malfoy said, licking his lips suggestively. “Why don’t we move this to the shower.”
“Okay. So you’ve probably played wizard chess before – I remember Weasley being a competent enough player at Hogwarts – but I can go through the rules for
Harry resisted the temptation to close his eyes as warm breath ghosted over his face but he couldn’t help the small gasp that escaped when Malfoy’s fingers brushed the sensitive skin on his neck.  A second later Malfoy’s hands were on him, rubbing up and down his arms to generate heat and Harry felt like he was going to explode from the butterflies suddenly running riot in his stomach.
“Wh- what does it do?” Harry gulped, the way Malfoy’s were raking up and down his body making him feel naked.
Harry followed Draco into the shop and swerved as he was nearly knocked off his feet by a blonde Hufflepuff who had sweets piled high in her arms.  “Oops, sorry!  But chocolate calls!” she shouted in apology as she made her way across the store.
Hermione’s face lit up. “Yes! Harry, we went to a fair ages ago. Must have been four or five years ago. That’s the last thing you remember?”
Draco raised his hand to knock – he’d lost count of the number of times he’d hesitated outside Harry’s room in the last hour, fist poised to rap on the
hovering outside of Harry’s room. The door was propped open just enough for Draco to peek inside and, from his vantage point he could see the trio chatting
Harry glanced at Ron, who simply smirked and gave him a look that clearly said mate, you got yourself into this mess, and sat back, resigned to an evening spent planning how to woo Draco Malfoy.
Harry sighed as he escaped the common room.  He hadn’t been wrong about the questioning; as soon as he returned Hermione had pounced on him, dragged him upstairs and demanded to hear every last detail.  But that was at least better than the mutters and whispers from his fellow Gryffindors that had greeted him.  Talk definitely spreads quickly, Harry thought as he made his way downstairs for dinner with Ron and Hermione, his bad mood immediately disappearing when a familiar, blond figure came into sight.
“I can see you worrying,” Harry said, blinking up at Draco.  “Stop it.  I already said I wanted you to hold my hand, didn’t I.”
“Er, yeah.  So, I’ve been a bit confused,” he explained haltingly, fingers nervously tangling in the soft tassels of the scarf.  “But this evening Draco found me outside and we went for a walk.  It was...” Harry searched for a word to describe the experience – he doubted ‘perfect’ or ‘spine-tingling’ would be very well received by Ron, “… it was nice,” he finished lamely.
Ron said that it hatched and there was a dragon inside it! And then Hermione said that you saw us, Draco, so we had to try and get rid of the dragon before
Cho had been the one to give Harry a chance when he stumbled into Ristorante Gustami almost a year ago asking for a job. He hadn’t been able to stand one more second living with the Dursleys and had run off to London as soon as he was old enough to work. Even though she was only a year older than him, she had taken Harry under her wing and was as good a manager as he could imagine. It was why he couldn’t help but feel uncomfortable when, walking home later that night, Cho came up as a topic of conversation.
Excuses flew around in his head – the whole common room had imagined it, it was a trick of the light, it was a joke, or that a beautiful blond had given it to him and that since then Harry’s heart had yet to return to its normal pace.  There was nothing for it.  He was going to have to tell them.

Harry grinned and plucked two beans from the box, placing one in Draco’s hand.  “Deal,” he said, throwing the other sweet into his mouth.
As he approached the crowd, a few volunteers shouted out his name in greeting.  Malfoy, startled out of his introspection, flicked his eyes up to meet Harry’s and, before he could return his gaze to a blank examination of the floor, Harry nodded his head at the man.  A puzzled look passed briefly over Malfoy’s face before he hesitantly nodded back.  Harry smiled inwardly as he joined the rest of the volunteers.  Baby steps, after all, were what were needed here if he wanted his plan to work.
After seconds? minutes? days? Draco pulled away, lips brushing softly against Harry's one last time, and smiled smugly at the dazed expression on his face.  “Do you have any plans for tomorrow?”
Harry gasped. Malfoy was hard against him. He could feel himself lengthening in response and threw his head back as Malfoy began peppering kisses over Harry’s neck. Hands roamed over his arms, shoulders and chest, before settling to grip his backside, the scraping of nails providing the perfect pain to accompany the pleasure of warm lips ravaging his neck. The lips travelled upwards until they met Harry’s own. Finally, Harry thought, as he opened his mouth under the assault and allowed his tongue to intertwine with Malfoy’s. Thoughts of “what the fuck am I doing?” vanished as quickly as they had appeared as Harry lost himself in the feel of Malfoy’s body against his own, the feel of his lips and tongue and – oh my god! – cock.

He brushed away the feeling, reminding himself that, no matter how many interested looks the Auror gave him, he was Harry’s Healer and that was all. “I’m
It was one of the most surreal experiences of his life.  In all their years of knowing each other Harry couldn’t recall a single conversation, a single encounter that hadn’t ended in an argument, insults or a fist fight.  And yet here they were and Harry had to admit that Malfoy seemed like a completely different person.  He was funny and smart and, although Harry would never confess thinking it, looked amazing in the evening sunlight.  The fading light falling on the Slytherin’s face made his eyes glow like molten silver and the crisp spring air had turned his nose an adorable shade of pink.
. He was under no illusions when he stepped out of the Floo in his living room that he would be able to sleep
After a few moments, Harry’s breathing had slowed but his erection was still as prominent as ever.  He groaned into the tiles as he realised that it wasn’t going to go away any time soon unless he did something about it.  He debated what was worse, going down to breakfast with a raging erection or wanking in the shower to thoughts of… that, before he slowly reached down to grip himself with one hand.  His eyes drifted shut as he began to move, faster and faster.  He tried desperately to think of something, anything but the flashes of blond hair and pale skin that seemed to be seared into his mind.  Harry’s orgasm crept up on him, the pressure coiling in his crotch peaking in an explosion of white hot pleasure before he had time to muffle his moans into his arm.
“Harry!” a friendly voice called out to him as he stepped into the small cafe, the door closing with a jingle behind him and the smell of freshly baked cakes and rich coffee washing over him. Harry turned towards the voice and waved shyly at Cho. He could do this. He could DO this.
Harry collapsed back onto the bed, eyes closed in a deep sleep. Draco drew in a deep breath; now was the difficult part. He called Maddie into the room who
He shook his head, trying to dispel the images in his mind, and groaned aloud when a rather prominent reminder of his dream made itself present. Draco ran
“Hm,” Draco said, reaching out to take the scarf.  “Maybe you should keep it.  The colour suits you,” he observed as he moved in close and carefully wound the wool once around Harry’s neck.
As they set off toward the first of the stands and tents, Harry couldn’t help but feel unnerved by the whole Malfoy situation. Having him with them felt so unnatural and yet natural at the same time. Through the noise and bustle of the fair, he could hear Malfoy talking to Hermione, the rich, aristocratic tone so familiar from his Hogwarts days. Except now, rather than inciting anger, that tone was inciting something else entirely, something deep in Harry’s gut that he couldn’t put a finger on.
“Oh God,” Harry sobbed, the tender look in his eyes completely at odds with the frantic movements of his hand. “I love you.”
A knock at the door interrupted his musings as a not-so-bushy head poked round the door. “Everything’s set up. Are you nearly ready, Draco?” asked
“Why does Malfoy have to be such a prick?” he asked nobody in particular.  “What, does he just lurk around the castle waiting to insult me or something?”
“I’d love to do a potions apprenticeship if Snape would take me,” Draco was explaining.  “I mean, there are other potions masters out there but he’s one of the best.  What about you?”
His heart drummed in his chest, adrenaline fuelled by what-ifs shooting through his bloodstream. He needed to calm down. Maybe there was someone he could speak to first. Someone who had experienced a similar thing and who understood and who would listen to him without the risk of judgement. Harry's eyes widened with realisation. Why didn't he think of it before! He knew someone else, another guy who didn't like girls in that way. Someone who liked guy instead. Not that Harry liked guys in that way... maybe... urgh. That was enough soul searching for one day.
The girl sat primly down on one of the long benches bordering the nearest breakfast table and Harry cautiously sat down beside her. She poured two cups of tea and glanced at him from the corner of her eye.
and got away with it while he, who had only been trying to report the offence to the proper authorities, had been punished.

Ron looked between them in disbelief.  “Why am I the only one who seems to find the idea of Malfoy flirting with Harry completely fucked up?”

there but, ah fuck it – and clambered onto the bed to sit opposite Harry, leaving enough space in between them for the chess board.
“Err, blue.  You’re wearing blue.  I don’t think I’ve ever seen you wearing blue before,” he commented lamely to hide his embarrassment.
“Granger.  Weasley,” Draco remembered his manners.  “He hasn’t woken up yet but the Mediwitch said he’s going to be fine.”
Ron shrugged.  “I suppose if we don’t help you’re only going to go at it alone and make a complete twat of yourself.”
“That sounds great, Harry!  There are some wonderful apprenticeships out there in broomstick crafting.”
Draco hesitated. There was no easy way to explain to them that their best friend had lost all of his memories and had no idea who they were, so - like

At that moment, the ginger oaf in question swung round the kitchen door frame. “Oi, Harry! You ready to head off, mate?”
“Fuck!” Draco threw his head back in bliss as a wet heat engulfed him. His fingers scrabbled for purchase on the sheets as Harry hummed, the vibrations

Faced with her puppy dog eyes – a talent she’d perfected over the last few years – Harry sighed, resigned to spending an evening in this sickeningly sweet hell.  He supposed he at least owed her this.  After all, his friends had been his rock over the past few years: they had been there for him through his messy break up with Ginny, through his confusion about his sexuality and there to force him out of bed on days where he just wanted to bury beneath his duvet.

On the fourth day, Harry was ready to give up.  He was not a patient person and he was beginning to think that there was no way of getting through to Draco Malfoy.  When he saw the man at lunch Harry smiled - more out of habit now than any hope that he might smile back - and gaped in shock as, instead of the frown Harry had become so accustomed to seeing, Malfoy’s lips quirked up into a smile.  Well, maybe not a smile, Harry thought, but it was definitely close enough for him.  He beamed victoriously back at Malfoy, who sent Harry one more quirk of the lips before turning back to his food.  Harry refrained from whooping and punching his fist in the air until he got home, where he immediately floo-called Ron and Hermione to tell them the good news.
Harry sent him a wide grin and turned his gaze on Hermione, who heaved a long-suffering sigh.  How she always got dragged into these idiotic schemes she’d never know.
“I don’t know.  Their new Seeker might cause Falmouth some problems,” Harry interjected, enjoying winding up the blond way too much.
Draco felt strong hands around his waist mere seconds before he was flipped onto his back and greeted with the sight of Harry settling between his legs,
Digging out a tiny sewing kit (like one you might find in a cheap Christmas cracker) from an overfull cupboard, Draco proceeded to sew shut the tear in Cho’s skirt.
Hermione shot him an apologetic expression.  “We’re sorry, Harry.  It’s just that we know how you get around him.”
Draco’s fingers turned rough in Harry’s hair as he arched upwards, straining as he sought for some friction against the aching cock lying untouched on his
He felt himself relax as the tongue continued circling his hole and whimpered when Harry surged forward, pushing past the tight ring of muscle and inside

“Shit. Are you okay?” Maddie asked as Draco pushed through the ward doors the next afternoon. “You look awful.”
A loud horn interrupted his examination of a rather plain looking wizard and he turned to find the registration witch standing on a chair.  “Can all the participants of tonight’s event please take a seat at one of the tables behind me?  We’re ready to begin.”
A breath of relief left Harry and, seizing every ounce of Gryffindor courage he possessed, replied.  “Only if I can buy you one after.”
“Oh Merlin,” Pansy sighed.  Sometimes her best friend was remarkably thick.  “Come on,” she said, stretching her arm around Draco and leading him back down to the dungeon.  “I’ve got some chocolate left from Christmas under my bed.  And I think I’ve got an idea.”
shaking so much that he could barely hold himself up, Harry removed his tongue and Draco heard a whine that he belatedly realised had issued from his own
Grinning, Harry pulled out his mobile phone and began typing a note for his body-switching partner, eagerly awaiting the next time the blond would be pulled into Harry's life.
“Hi,” Harry said, and did Draco imagine it or did he see a spark of interest in the Auror’s eyes as his gaze passed over him? He shrugged it off as the
“Um, I guess we need to change seats,” Harry muttered.  He knew that he was dangerously close to pouting but right now moving tables was at the bottom of his to-do list, just above getting his balls waxed and inviting Umbridge out for afternoon tea.
Harry’s eyebrows shot up in shock.  That was easily the most words he’d heard Malfoy speak in months.  He performed a little victory dance inside his head before returning to the conversation.
“Can I just say one thing, though?” Hermione asked. “I can see the cogs in your brain whirling and if you’re scared about this being your future, don’t be. I’ve seen how happy you are with Draco. You two are made for each other. Just give him until the end of the day to convince you of that. Ok?”
chose the wrong side. He’s going to hate me, Draco thought, tears welling in his eyes as he slumped onto the sofa and rested his head in his hands.
But, and here was Draco’s issue, he did not want to marry Pansy. Nor did he want to marry any girl for that sake. There were many things he would do for his parents. He could be the perfect horse-riding, tweed-wearing, boarding-schooled (and potentially inbred) son, but there was a line Draco would not cross. The very thought of squashing down this part of him, a part revealed only to Pansy after they’d consumed rather too much of a smuggled bottle of vodka, a part he knew would disgust his parents and alienate him to his peers, made him feel physically sick.
An hour later found Harry sitting cross-legged on his bed and staring off into space.  He had quickly hidden the scarf under his pillow – if you had accused him of pressing the wool to his face and breathing in the mingled scents of grass and lemon before hiding it he would have blushed furiously and told you to mind your own bloody business – and was now lost in a daze.
grin, or even a cheeky smirk, but a fond, tender smile that had Draco’s heart melting in his chest – and raised his hand to trail his fingers down Draco’s
As if sensing Harry’s eyes on him, Malfoy glanced over from where he was attempting to crack an egg. “Morning, sleepy,” he said with an affectionate smile.
Harry was deposited onto a bed and received a pain potion, sighing in relief as a sweet numbness settled down his arm.  He only had a few moments to relax before what seemed like the entirety of Gryffindor house barrelled through the ward doors.
“What about when you’re not my Healer anymore?” Harry asked, the determined look in his eyes reminding Draco of the stubborn Gryffindor he knew in school.
fact that Maddie was the only Mediwitch in the ward willing to work with a Malfoy, over the years they had become close friends. She grinned up at Draco as
It must be a nightmare, he thought, there’s no other explanation for what’s happening. Suddenly, Malfoy’s arms slipped around him and Harry froze. Strong hands ran soothingly through his hair and along his back and Harry found himself loosening and relaxing under the pressure. In for a penny, he thought, as he sighed and rested his head against Malfoy’s chest. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d been held like this, but there was something about the situation that made him feel safe and secure, like he’d done this a thousand times before. With a last stroke of his hair, Malfoy released him.
The door slammed shut behind him and Draco jumped, taking a calming breath as Harry brushed past him and sat on the bed.

The face in question belonged to a man of middling height with a shock of messy black hair, brown skin and the most atrocious glasses Draco had ever seen. At the sight of the man, the itch that had been Draco's constant companion since he was seventeen flared, causing Draco to gasp.

It wasn’t much, Draco thought as he removed his robes and toed off his shoes, but it was his. He walked to his bedroom, his feet dragging behind him as he
Harry felt his cheeks flush in embarrassment and willed the redness away, conscious that the entire school was watching him.  He kicked off from the ground as the whistle sounded and the balls were released, the snitch vanishing quickly in a flash of golden wings.  The game started and Harry flew down the pitch, straining his eyes for a glimpse of his bounty, all the time aware of Malfoy’s presence.  The Slytherin circled lazily around him, his head turning this way and that in search for the snitch and occasionally glancing over at Harry with a smirk.
She rolled her eyes affectionately. “We were just saying that we should have a walk around and see if anything grabs our attention.”
Draco felt his cheeks flush – he didn’t think he’d ever get used to hearing Harry say his name – and ignored Maddie as she rolled her eyes and muttered
Harry trailed off as he realised that he had been talking at Malfoy without pause for minutes now.  He risked a glance up at the man, who stood rigid and was staring at Harry with a look of utter bafflement.
Harry tried to ignore him, he really did – he knew that Malfoy was just trying to distract him so he could beat him to the snitch – but there was something about the way the way that the blond flew, graceful, hair practically glowing in the sun, that forced Harry’s gaze to him again and again.  The way his Quidditch robes fluttered around him, the way his strong thighs gripped onto his broomstick, the way, when he leaned forward in a burst of speed, Harry got the most amazing view of his-
“I assure you,” Draco narrowed his eyes at Pansy, “that I am perfectly capable of looking presentable.”
Draco stepped back from the door, still in a state of mild shock, the urge to laugh hysterically bubbling up inside him as Harry Potter walked into his
At first, Harry glared with the rest of them.  After all, Draco Malfoy was a Death Eater, albeit an acquitted one.  The nerve of him to parade around like that as if he was still the respected Malfoy heir, as if no one could see the ugly, black mark burned onto his left forearm.  But after weeks of scowling, Harry began to really notice Draco Malfoy.  The way his face no longer bore its customary expression of superiority, but instead remained blank and passive, even when confronted with the angry jeers of the crowd.  The way he would slouch against the castle walls when he thought no one could see him, the pretence and mask slipping for a brief moment.  The way that, despite the fact that likely no one wanted him around, Draco Malfoy had not run away like he could have and was actually trying to make amends.
Draco hesitated, wary of being alone with Harry after what had happened last time, but he rationalised that Maddie would be just down the corridor. “Sure,”
“I’m just going out into the corridor for a second. I’ll only be a minute or two, okay?” Draco replied in a soothing tone.
Hermione sighed. “When are you finally going to get over this stupid rivalry? It’s been nearly ten years, for Merlin’s sake! You’d get along with him if you gave him a chance.”
“Oh, don’t believe a thing Achilles says,” Malfoy had responded. “I’ve already fed him this morning. He’s just trying to get more food out of you.”
“Yeah?”  Harry asked.  He knew that he was smiling like a loon but he just couldn’t find it in himself to care.
“Sorry about that, Malfoy,” Granger said politely, throwing one last reproving glare at her husband before turning back to Draco. “How’s Harry? Can we see
“Oh, would you look at the time,” he said, interrupting Harry and glancing dramatically at his watch, “it’s getting really late. You should be going to bed
For a second he contemplated spending the day in bed anyway. The speccy git probably had a shift at his awful job again but that wasn’t Draco’s problem. He crossed his arms resolutely before the guilt crept in. Harry didn’t deserve that. The idiot seemed to have done a passable job of pretending to be Draco the last time so the least Draco could do in return was to not get Harry fired.

“Well,” she answered, “it’s just that it was kind of obvious, wasn’t it.”  At Harry and Ron’s dumfounded faces, she continued.  “I mean, he’s been flirting with you for ages, Harry.”
Draco groaned as he rolled his shoulders. He had managed to make a swift exit after Harry’s invitation to go flying – he wasn’t sure how long his resolve
Harry nodded once again and the floo connection cut off. He groaned as he stood up, his legs protesting at the rough treatment of having to kneel on such a hard surface for so long. Harry took a deep breath. Time to re-join the person who I could be spending my future with, he thought with a slightly hysterical laugh.
“Oh?” Draco raised his eyebrow.  “You must have been on the receiving end of some pretty funny looks going into the Gryffindor common room wearing that last night.”

She gasped as she noticed him and gripped the skirt tighter, as if scared it was going to fall apart.
Harry ducked as a nasty entrail-expelling curse hit the wall behind him, missing his head by inches and showering him with dust and plaster. This was the

when he spotted what had caught her eye. Standing hesitantly in the corridor outside his room was Harry.
“Oh,” Potter’s face fell. “Well do you think it would be okay if you called me Harry anyway? It’s just that this is a lot to take in,” he looked at them
Harry smiled but relaxed against Malfoy’s shoulder. He thought about what Hermione had said, about giving Malfoy a chance to convince him that they could be happy together. Exactly when it had shifted Harry had no idea, but there was no doubt left in his mind that he could be happy with this person.

It all reminded Harry of a story he had read as a child when an unwitting relative had gifted Dudley with a book for his birthday. Rather than read it, Dudley had instead used the book as a weapon and repeatedly thrown it at Harry until he’d grown bored and lumbered off to torment another poor soul. But Harry had devoured the book, reading it in his cupboard until his eyes strained the see the pag

The day of the Gryffindor versus Slytherin Quidditch match dawned and Harry’s stomach was in knots.  Not only did Gryffindor have to win – they were lying in third place after being beaten spectacularly by Ravenclaw earlier in the year – but Harry had to play Seeker against Malfoy.

Draco scowled as he was shoved, bumped and jostled on the busy London underground carriage. He hated London but this was where the jobs were and a job meant leaving Wiltshire and his parents. It meant independence and finally being able to be himself. So Draco sucked it up, attending interview after interview in the hope of finally being free.
“If that’s true, Harry, then I’m sure you’ll be back in your own timeline soon. These spells never last very long. Probably just until you fall asleep.”

He did so and felt the familiar sensation of being squeezed through a small rubber tube before he lurched to a stop.  Feet planted firmly on the ground, Draco looked around him to see that the Mediwitch had apparated them to a small but clean private room at St Mungo’s and was now levitating Harry onto a bed in the middle of the room.  Under the harsh lighting of the hospital Harry looked even paler, the blood on his head and clothes stark in contrast, and Draco felt sick.
The Operation so far had only called for nodding and smiling, nothing incredibly difficult, but it was the next stage that worried Harry: conversation.
The blond eyed the box mistrustfully and reluctantly held out his hand.  “Fine.  But if it’s horrible then you have to buy me a butterbeer.”
he would always be an outsider because he just couldn’t remember any of it. And in that moment, looking at Harry looking at his friends, Draco’s heart
From then on, Harry joined Malfoy in the Great Hall every day for lunch.  Their conversations were mostly one-sided and usually consisted of Harry rambling about whatever was on his mind, with the occasional smirk or raised eyebrow from Malfoy.  It was one afternoon when Harry was once again ranting about joining the Aurors that Malfoy eventually spoke up.
“Oh, I’m sure our parents would be thrilled,” she continued with a roll of her eyes. “Can you imagine? Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson, taking Wiltshire by storm. But alas,” she sighed theatrically.
He cast a levitation charm on Potter as the Aurors shuffled to the waiting area and turned to Maddie, noticing the frown on her face as she glanced between
cheeks and bloodshot eyes. “It’s an experimental technique so we don’t really know if it will work or not.”
Harry jolted into consciousness, springing upright in his bed as memories of the previous day spun around in his head. He took in the thin curtains, worn bedsheets and scuffed carpet and slumped in a mixture of relief and disappointment. A part of him, the part that hadn’t been confused and panicked and lost, had actually enjoyed being Draco for the day.
These thoughts flitted through Draco’s mind as he imagined a different life for himself. A life where he could escape his parents’ judgements and truly be himself.
“Harry’s body has been put under an incredible amount of stress which I believe was the cause of the memory loss. He needs time to recover but after that I
Harry sat down and, out of habit, filled his plate from the bowls in front of him but his mind was elsewhere.  Malfoy had to be up to something.  There was no way he would say that to Harry for any other reason.  He was trying to mess with him.  And it was working.
Harry’s face twisted into a scowl. “Yeah, well, you should be!” he yelled, causing Draco to flinch. “Where the fuck were you?!”
Hermione blinked at him in shock. “Um, well I actually prefer London School of Economics. They have some excellent courses on human rights law…” She trailed off.
Rushing out of the Great Hall, Harry made for the entrance doors and took a deep breath when he emerged into the cold spring evening.  The sun was just beginning to set and, looking at the burnt sky, Harry felt himself relax.

The next day at Hogwarts, Harry’s eyes were drawn immediately to Malfoy, who was standing off to the side from the rest of the volunteers with a casually blank expression on his face.  Malfoy, he decided, was a very good actor, but Harry could see how he warily eyed up anyone who walked too close and how, when once again no one talked to him, his mask slipped briefly into a sad sort of resignation.  Harry stared so hard and long at Malfoy that the blond glanced up at him - their eyes meeting and a confused frown crinkling his pale forehead - before he quickly turned away.  Strange to think it but Harry reckoned he missed the cocky, sarcastic, and arrogant Malfoy who had tormented him for the last seven years.  This Malfoy, who kept his head down, avoided glances, and altogether acted like a kicked puppy, was just wrong.  If only someone could get him to open up, thought Harry, and he smirked as an idea popped into his head.
Their strange nightly routine carried on over the next few days; Draco would check up on Harry when he arrived at work, he and Maddie would do the rounds
He looked across at his two best friends pleadingly and gave them his very best puppy dog eyes.  Hermione rolled her eyes at this and looked over to Ron.
The Mediwitch guided Draco out into the corridor as Healers rushed in and the room suddenly became a frenzy of activity.  She gave Draco an encouraging smile as she sat him down in the waiting room with a cup of hot tea.
Draco’s eyes lost focus and he jumped to his feet, thoughts buzzing excitedly around in his head. This could be it; this could be the cure for Harry’s

If his concentration was strained at the beginning of the class, it was absolutely destroyed now.  His potion was a complete disaster and wasn’t helped at all by his sudden compulsion to turn and stare at Malfoy every few minutes.  A scream of “Harry!” was all the warning he had before his neglected cauldron exploded in a shower of bright green gloop.
Draco was jolted out of his worrying as the ward doors slammed open and admitted two very frantic people, one with fiery red hair and the other with a very

“Whew, I’m starving.  Aren’t you?  I guess shifting rocks around all morning really builds up an appetite.  Ooh, is that treacle tart?  I love treacle tart.  It’s my favourite, you know?  It’s a shame there’s no apple crumble and custard, though,” Harry chattered on in between bites of shepherd’s pie, not pausing to wonder why he knew Malfoy’s favourite dessert.
“Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. They were your best friends in school and, as far as I am aware, have remained so.”
“Indeed,” Draco agreed, running his hands through his hair despairingly. “He’s going to remember that he hates me, has always hated me, and he’s not going

Unaware of how long he had been staring, Harry jumped when his companion cleared his throat.  He apologised guiltily but the damage had been done and Harry was almost relieved when a loud horn signalled that it was time to move seats.
This was exactly what he had been worried about ever since Hermione had come back from her first day at the Department of Mysteries. She’d been raving about how amazing Malfoy was, how smart and talented, and how much he’d changed since school. Bullshit. Then they’d started hanging out after work, going to the pub together, and soon Ron had been dragged in too. He started saying things like “he’s not so bad, I guess” and “Harry, you’ll never guess what Draco said last night”. Traitor. Harry was the only one who could see through Malfoy’s little game. Well, he hadn’t figured out what exactly the game was yet but he was sure that Malfoy was plotting something.
“I can’t believe you eat those things.  The last time I had one it tasted like old socks,” Draco grimaced as they stepped out into the cobbled street.
“Harry!” Draco dropped the phone as a loud voice shouted from outside the room. Harry? Was that him?
Harry felt his eyes prickling. Never had someone laid out so clearly the fears and doubts that had been filling him up for so many years.

Outside, Cho hugged Draco in thanks. Smiling, he remembered what the moron gang had been saying earlier that day - that Harry was Cho’s favourite – and decided to do something nice for Harry. After all, a girlfriend would surely help to spice up Harry’s boring life. Draco left the restaurant that evening with a spring in his step and a date arranged with Cho the following day, the rest of the staff stunned into silence in his wake.

square jaw accentuated by a dusting of dark stubble. A sharp jab to the ribs brought Draco back to reality and he looked up to find Maddie eyeing at him in
“And now we wait,” he confirmed, grabbing a pile of paperwork, settling into a chair and resigning himself to a very long night.
“Hey, Potter!”  Harry was jerked sharply out of his daydream.  “Bit of help over here.  Gryffindor Tower won’t build itself, y’know.”
That Potter was in no immediate danger seemed to drain the last vestiges of adrenaline from the Aurors as together they sagged in relief.
Cho bustled behind the bar. “It’ll be an even longer night if you two don’t start cleaning up,” she reprimanded lightly.
Remembering that he had come into Harry’s room to do something other than stare at his patient, Draco opened the file in front of him.
“Not as bad as the time the Department of Magical Transportation royally fucked up those portkeys a few years back though,” added Weasley.
He hurriedly searched for a mirror amongst the battered furniture. Finding one in the corner of the room, Draco edged towards it and gasped. The face staring back looked to be a similar age to Draco, but with skin the colour of honey, deep green eyes that were wide in shock and a mess of thick black hair, it was decidedly not his.
“Er… speaking of Hermione, I’m just going to give her a call and see if she’s home,” Harry said as nonchalantly as he could.
It sprawled out in front of them: a myriad of brightly coloured tents advertising petting zoos and fortune tellers, acrobats and contortionists; food stands piled high with butterbeer, pumpkin pasties and - Harry’s mouth salivated - treacle tart! There were sky-high rides with lights flashing vividly as guests sped around on flying motorbikes. Harry was so entranced that he completely missed Hermione talking to him.
As if sensing her friend’s hesitance, Hermione turned to him beseechingly.  “Come on, Harry.  I know it’s a bit corny but it could be a great way to meet someone.”
Draco hesitated and Maddie jumped in, glaring at him reproachfully. “Of course we can, Harry. Anything to make this whole ordeal easier for you. It’d

So here he was. Walking up to the fair and glaring daggers at the back of Malfoy’s head for having the nerve to come crashing back into Harry’s life and steal his best friends from under his nose.
“What?!” Hermione exclaimed when Harry had finished explaining his plan, or Operation Fix Draco Malfoy as he had dubbed it.
his eyes. What the hell had that been, he thought as glimpses of his dream came back to him. Glimpses of a topless Harry Potter lying between Draco’s legs
It was a credit to his long years of friendship with Ron and Hermione that Harry resisted his urge to flee, instead nodding warily at the witch.
“Come on,” Maddie said, leading them towards the hospital Floo point. “I’m shattered. You can see Harry later tonight.”
“What?” demanded Harry in indignation. “So I’m not allowed to notice that the man we used to hate in school is suddenly popping up everywhere I bloody go?”
“I mean that he can’t remember anything. Nothing. Not being an Auror, not his friends, not even who he is,” Draco implored her to understand. He
Harry gulped. His stomach churned with... excitement? Yeah, it must be excitement. After all, Cho was beautiful, kind and obviously liked Harry. He'd have to be stupid not to want to go out with her, right?
But Draco Malfoy was everywhere.  Harry saw him working at Hogwarts, shirtsleeves rolled to his elbows and his face smudged with dirt.  He saw him walking through the Ministry, head held high as he ignored the pointed stares and whispers that grew in his wake.  And he saw him in Diagon Alley, where the stares and whispers grew barbed and vicious, the tense atmosphere occasionally permeated by a shout of ‘Death Eater scum!’, and where Draco Malfoy walked on, giving the shouts and curses no more attention than a dragon pays a fly.
As he sat on the bed – and honestly, who had silk bedsheets – he spotted a notepad and pen on the side table. Before he turned the light off, Harry scrawled a quick note to Draco.

Just when Harry thought that this couldn’t get any better, Malfoy released him, repositioned himself and reached down to grab both of them together. Harry’s eyes rolled back and he braced himself against the wall, legs weak with spine-tingling pleasure. Malfoy’s hand was slick and moved with ease, generating delicious friction between them until Harry could take it no longer. He groaned as he came hard, riding out the waves under Malfoy’s relentless pace, until Malfoy himself shook and threw his head back with a moan.

What was he doing?!  He was admiring – no, checking out – Draco sodding Malfoy!  Harry shook his head in equal measures of disgust and confusion, willing away the tight feeling in his stomach and focusing on finding the snitch.
Maddie had half been expecting this; she had seen the way Draco had been looking at Harry recently. “Is that really such a bad thing, Draco? It’s obvious

He slowly extricated his arm from Potter’s grip, careful not to disturb him. He made it all the way to the door when he heard a sleepy voice behind him.
“You have got to be kidding,” Draco was currently ranting, hands gesturing excitedly.  “The Cannons have got absolutely no chance of beating the Falcons this year.”
Realising that Draco was in no hurry to talk about what was bothering him, Maddie tried a different tactic. “Harry’s in a very good mood today. Ron and
“Oh, look!” Hermione gushed suddenly, pointing at a red and white striped tent. “It’s a photo booth. I used to go to them all the time with Mum and Dad.”

Harry glanced suspiciously at Malfoy as he entered the dim Potions classroom later that afternoon.  He hadn’t heard a peep from the Slytherin since breakfast and had taken to checking behind suits of armour as he made his way around the castle, just in case, but Malfoy looked uncharacteristically subdued as he took his normal seat next to Parkinson.
Draco trailed off as he glanced down at Potter and jumped with shock when he saw a pair of bright green eyes staring back at him. He shot to his feet, the
“Potter,” Malfoy greeted, his face now schooled into one of mild amusement.  “What a surprise.  I must say that this is the last place I’d expect to see the Chosen One.”
Harry was distracted all day thinking of the perfect way to tell Draco how he felt.  He could see it in his head now.  I’ll get him alone, he thought, maybe ask him to join me for a walk of the grounds, and then I’ll say how glad I am that we’ve become friends, and he’ll smile - perhaps here I’ll take his hand - and then I’ll look into his eyes and tell him how I’d quite like to be more than friends if he’ll let me.  He’ll grin that eye-wateringly stunning grin he uses when I’ve said something particularly amazing and then he’ll grab me around the waist and pull me close and-
“Exactly,” he smiled at her. They hadn’t called her the smartest witch in her year for nothing, Draco thought.
This pushed Draco over the edge, his entire body stiffening as his balls tightened and waves of white hot pleasure shot through him. Harry’s movements
Harry blushed as he used the word man to describe Malfoy but he had to concede that Draco Malfoy was a boy no longer.  There was no denying that Malfoy, once scrawny and pointy with too-long limbs, had grown into himself over the past year, and shifting rocks and debris at Hogwarts all summer had definitely helped add to the impression.  Not that Harry had noticed.  Nope.  He hadn’t noticed the way Malfoy’s shoulders would ripple and tremble as he worked to move a particularly large stone, and he definitely hadn’t noticed that way the sweat caused by the summer heat had made Malfoy’s shirt stick to him, leaving it almost transparent in places.
The sound of their heavy breathing filled the room as Harry’s hands impatiently slid up Draco’s body, fingers trailing over ribs and circling around
Maddie nodded and Draco paused, wondering whether to tell her about the one photo that he just couldn’t get out of his head.
“My name is Healer Malfoy. I’m going to try and explain everything to you now, okay?” Draco asked, meeting Potter’s worried gaze.
Harry hadn’t seen hair or tail of Malfoy since the trials after the war and if he stared now, well, he was only human after all.  The Slytherin barely resembled the pale, frightened boy he had last seen in the Ministry courtrooms; instead, the man sitting only a few seats away was, for lack of a better word, stunning.  The platinum hair that was once harshly slicked back now hung loose around sharp cheekbones and fell down to brush along the collar of an exquisite grey robe.  Harry would have bet his entire inheritance that it had been made to measure, his eyes clouding over as he imagined running fingers over the soft material and finding out first-hand just how well the blond’s robe fit.
“Well I woke up and there was music and then there was a snake and Malfoy and pancakes and-“ Harry blurted out incoherently.
“Yes, Harry.  I think it does,” Draco grinned as he cupped Harry’s face and bent down for another kiss.
As fast as he could without seeming suspicious, Harry rushed to the living room and threw a handful of floo powder into the fireplace with a shout of
The room he currently gawped at was nothing like that. The single bed was tucked away in a corner, leaving room for a scuffed wardrobe and side table. Clothes were strewn haphazardly around the room and worn, threadbare curtains waved softly in a breeze that brought in sounds of traffic from outside.
“Then why? You know who I am, what I’ve done. Why are you here?” Draco demanded, his eyes prickling with tears.
bouquets of lilies clasped in their hands. Music sounded through the room as the double doors ahead of him opened. Draco’s mouth went dry, his confidence
The next few days passed in a blur. Draco practised the spell and wand movements at every chance he got and spent the remainder of his time checking and

“Hm?” Draco said, looking up from his notes. “Oh, well I’m nearly finished here. There’s an old wizard chess set in the staff room I could bring up if you
Draco scrunched his eyes shut in anticipation as he slowly woke up. He took a deep breath trying to figure out if everything was back to normal: soft bedsheets tangled around his legs, the sounds of his classmates getting ready from the other dormitories, the slightly musty smell of old furniture and wood polish. He never thought that he would miss his room, but Draco sighed with relief as he opened his eyes and focused on the familiar surroundings.
“You know, I seem to have had the most dreadful night’s sleep and I find myself entirely forgetting what happened yesterday,” he said with mock casualness and examined his fingernails.
The shouting had obviously disturbed the occupant of the room because suddenly the door Draco had been agonising over swung open to reveal a very confused
His face flushed bright red.  “Yeah.  Er, in Hogsmeade.  I could give it to you then.  That is, if you want to go.  With me.  To Hogsmeade.”
Harry trailed off. So that was what this was? This is what his future could be? Just as he was trying to figure out how to feel about that, Hermione spoke.
“What the fuck?” Draco whispered as he examined the face in more detail. He poked and prodded and pinched himself a few times, but the face that was not his remained staring back in horror. Draco’s stomach clenched in panic.

“This is brilliant, Draco!” Maddie exclaimed. “Harry will get his memory back and you can finally ask him out. I call dibs on bridesmaid at the wedding!”
Maddie snorted from her position hunched over the desk. “Well you can go easy on him someplace else. I’ve got to finish this report for tomorrow morning.”
“Fortune telling?” Hermione grimaced. “Harry, you know that divination is nonsense. Don’t you remember Trelawney?”
“Thanks,” she muttered in embarrassment. “It ripped as I was packing away. I don’t know what to do. I haven’t got a change of clothes and I can’t go out there looking like this.”
He glared at her as he made another rotation of the room. “Remind me again why I asked you to do this.”

Goosebumps sprung up all over Harry as the soft material settled onto his skin.  He bit his lip nervously as he looked at Draco, the soft smirk on the Slytherin’s face all the warning he received before a warm mouth was gently pressed against his.  Through the sound of his heart pounding in his ears, one thought echoed around in Harry’s head – I’m gay, I’m so gay, totally 100% gay, well, for Draco at least – before soft hands reached up to cup his face and his brain shut off completely.
Dean grinned in response. “How does she think we’re supposed to work when she’s there swanning around in

You convince yourself that no one will ever love you for who you are, rather than who they believe you to be, so you lock your heart away.”
“Of course I do. Now, why don’t you go home and get some rest? Your shift is over soon and, truth be told, you look like shit.”
Draco flushed the most adorable shade of pink and smiled.  “Well.  That’s alright then,” he said, reaching under the table and entwining his hand with Harry’s.

Draco felt the smile freeze on his face as a thousand thoughts swarmed through his head – because you rejected me, because I was cruel to your friends,
That memory had made Harry surge forward until he was standing in front of Draco, looking up into grey eyes he had never imagined could contain such warmth, and lean in to capture soft lips in a kiss.  It started off as normal, just mouths moving gently together, until Draco opened his lips with a groan.  It was like the floodgates had been opened: a month of caution thrown to the wind in a rush of hands tangling in hair and impatient teeth nipping at lips.  Harry had gasped as their hips aligned, a hard length pressing into his own and making him see stars.
Draco, with messy black hair and crooked glasses. He would have recognised him anywhere, but it was the look on the man’s face that had Draco entranced.
“Yes, your team, Potter. The other Aurors you were with last night. You arrived with them a few hours ago,” Draco clarified.
A young lad, not long out of training by the look of it, answered. “He got hit by something but none of us heard what it was. Knocked him straight out
There!  Harry shot after the flash of gold.  He circled around the goal posts, lying flat against his broomstick, and weaved through the stands, all the while his eyes locked on the snitch.  He could feel Malfoy close on his tail as he reached out and closed his fingers around the tiny ball.
A chuckle reverberated in his ear, the warm breath against the back of his neck making his skin tingle, and Harry jumped as he realised that, in his effort to avoid the sugar-crazed Hufflepuff, he had pressed himself entirely against Draco.
Draco shook his head to clear his mind as he entered the ward. The lights had been dimmed as the in-patients settled down for the night, leaving the

He saw Potter nod uncertainly and lay his head down on the pillow, his bloodshot gaze never once leaving Draco as he exited the room.
“I suppose you needed your rest after last night,” Malfoy said, shooting Harry a filthy grin that left no doubt in Harry’s mind about what last night had entailed. “Sit down then. I’ll make you some coffee.”
Malfoy raised an eyebrow and looked at him like he was a complete idiot.  “I’m keeping you warm, of course,” he said as he slowly started to wrap the scarf around Harry’s neck.
Draco pursed his lips in thought. It seemed like Harry had done a fair enough job of playing along yesterday, treacle tart aside, and, other than a slight hair mishap, had managed to avoid embarrassing Draco too badly. Pushing the thought away, it would never happen again, after all, Draco poured himself another cup of tea and decided to put the whole debacle behind him.

brushing soot from his robes, and stood there blankly for a few moments, at a loss for what to do now. Waiting around here was nearly as bad as waiting
Closing the door, Draco slumped against the wall and considered his situation. He was in an unknown place, in an unknown body, with unknown people, apparently about to start a shift at an unknown job. He took a deep breath. I can do this, Draco thought. He was a great actor. After all, he’d successfully convinced his parents that he was straight. Draco smirked. This would be a piece of cake next to that.
Draco felt his jaw drop as he stared at Harry who raised an eyebrow at Draco’s hesitation. “Scared, Draco?”
our way back we forgot my cloak and got caught by the caretaker, but then we found out that Draco had been caught out of bed as well trying to snitch on us
Draco could feel his heart galloping in his chest. His hands shook against his sides as they approached one another. The man's eyes – green, so green, how could Draco have forgot eyes so green – met his and Draco gulped.
“Sorry,” Harry apologised as he tried and failed to keep a straight face.  “But at least you get a free drink out of this.”
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry moaned, pressing passionate kisses down his neck; in his wildest fantasies he’d never imagined the quiet, reserved Healer to be so
Harry shook his head. “Sorry. Apparently you’ve already been fed this morning. I’ve been told not to trust you anymore.”
“Lovely day, isn’t it?  I just love being able to work outside, don’t you?  I mean, I know that helping out here is part of your community service, right?  But I just love it.  Much better than being stuck at Grimmauld Place on my own.  If I was there I’d only be thinking about…”
Harry nodded dumbly, aware that he probably couldn’t manage a single coherent word in that moment.  Malfoy smiled.  “Come on; let’s get you back to the castle.”
last night and seemed to be in a stable condition, I’ve put off contacting them until this morning. They’ll probably be in to see you very soon.”
Maddie frowned at him, her dark blonde fringe falling into her eyes. “Aw, come on, Draco. Don’t be a grump. We’ve still got ten riveting hours ahead of us.
“I didn’t even know I could fly,” Harry said, oblivious to Draco’s shock. “You though,” he shook his head in appreciation, “you’re amazing.”
Draco looked up in confusion. The only people who ever visited him were his mother and Maddie and that voice was definitely neither of them. He slowly
On the walk back, Harry was increasingly aware of Malfoy’s proximity.  He imagined he could feel the heat from the Slytherin’s body through the few feet of air separating them and was almost disappointed when the large entrance doors loomed before them.
Harry flicked through the pages – the golden trio together in the snow, Harry and his housemates in the common room, a young boy with bright blue hair, who
Entering Harry’s room, he took in the scene before him with relief. A small part of him had been worried that Weasley and Granger would accidentally let
“Ah, I can sympathise with you there.  Pansy and Blaise dragged me along,” Malfoy indicated to the bar where Harry could just discern the two Slytherins.  “I’m back home barely long enough to unpack and apparently it’s already time for me to “settle down”,” he said with a scoff.
“Uh…” Harry faltered. He had no idea who this person was. Looking at her closer though Harry recognised the bright red hair, the freckly cheeks, the warm brown eyes and prominent front teeth that all told him exactly who she was. “Hi there. Is Mummy there?”
With the help of Malfoy, Harry trudged back to the castle, all the while trying his hardest to ignore the warm body against him, the strong arms under his shoulders, and the smell of musk and grass that was threatening to overload his senses.  He could feel Malfoy’s even breaths as they worked their way through the castle, blessedly empty with most of the school still out on the Quidditch pitch, and concentrated on the steady in and out to calm his own frantic breathing.
Harry stepped reluctantly down the staircase to breakfast the following morning and shot Hermione a glare as she jabbed a bony finger impatiently into his back.  Nerves had been swirling around in his gut all morning and, as the chattering of voices from the Great Hall reached him, he had to battle against his instinct to run back to his bed and hide under the covers.
“Maybe, Potter,” Malfoy began, and Harry realised that he had spoken out loud, “I know you better than you think.”
Harry groaned and rubbed his hands over his face.  He was about to reply that, yes; it really was that bad, when a familiar voice shouted out.
“Erm, kinda,” he replied hesitantly.  He wasn’t sure how his friends would react when they found out who the person was that had caught his attention.
Draco smiled at the look of bafflement on Harry’s face as the best friends he didn’t remember introduced themselves and, determined to give the trio some
“Are you nearly ready to go, Draco?” Maddie called over to him as she finished her morning round of the ward. Her shift was finishing at the same time as
a hand down his stomach, coming to rest on the bulge tenting his pyjama bottoms. No, he thought, yanking his hand away as if it had been electrified.
Well, that and also that Harry had finally admitted to himself that he might find Malfoy the tiniest bit attractive.  Maybe.
Panic setting in, he jumped into motion and hurtled across the entrance hall and up the staircase, hoping and praying that it was someone else who had been hurt.  Just not Harry.  Reaching the top of the staircase, Draco pushed and elbowed his way through the crowd, cursing at anyone unlucky enough to be in his way, until he reached the front and was brought to a standstill by the sight of blood, so much blood, and a shock of dark hair attached to a body lying motionless on the stone floor.  Draco charged forward and fell to his knees in front of the man he had once hated but now who meant so much to him.

Harry scrunched his eyes shut in protest as a hand shook his shoulder.  His grunted no, leave me alone – that, to be honest, came out like nnghlemlon – didn’t deter the hand one bit and, after another shake, Harry cracked his eyelids open to glare up at Ron.

“Good morning, Harry,” he greeted, trying to act as though the previous few minutes had never happened.

Harry dimly registered the rapidly approaching grass – in his haste to catch the snitch, he had flown much too low – before he crashed into the pitch with a sickening crunch.  The defeated fluttering of wings against his hand was the only thing Harry could feel as he lay as still as possible and hoped against hell that his broomstick was unharmed.  Bones could be mended but his Firebolt had been a gift from Sirius.

Harry stuffed the green and silver striped scarf into his bag as he ran down the staircase and out of the Gryffindor common room.  It had taken him twice as long as usual to get ready this morning; by the time he had emptied his trunk, realised he had nothing to wear, called Hermione in to help and finally settled on his least ripped pair of jeans and a fairly crease free red shirt, he barely had time to guzzle down a healthy breakfast of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans before he had to bolt down to meet Draco in the entrance hall.
Tears were now freely flowing down Draco’s cheeks. His tongue felt dry and useless in his mouth so he did the only thing he could think of to tell Harry
“…and then I had to send a memo to the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes. I’m telling you, Harry, it was a complete shambles,” Granger was
“You don’t have to say anything if you don’t want to,” Hermione reassured as she shifted closer to him and leaned down to meet his eyes, resting a hand on top of his in support.  “But we’re your friends, Harry, and you can tell us anything.”
Harry considered that.  The rumours would definitely be flying by the time they returned to Hogwarts; there would be whispers in the Great Hall, staring in the corridors and probably outrage from some of his friends, but Harry realised that he didn’t care.  The people who meant the most had accepted him and that was all that mattered.
Harry frowned in confusion before remembering that Draco had been here yesterday. He hoped that the blond hadn't done anything embarrassing. He chuckled uncomfortably and ran a hand through his hair. “Ha, er.. yeah, right.”
Draco huffed, annoyed that she had managed to get the last word, and followed her into the fireplace. He threw down a handful of Floo powder and felt a
standing before him wearing nothing but a battered pair of jeans and was looking at him like he was the most irresistible thing he had ever seen. Harry
Scenes of the evening played over and over in his head: Harry leaving to go outside, Draco checking up on him, being invited for a walk, having a surprisingly pleasant conversation, Draco wrapping his scarf around Harry’s neck…
Hermione glanced thoughtfully between Harry’s current position and where Malfoy had just disappeared and shook her head.  “Well, I, for one, am starving,” she said, heading over to the Gryffindor table.
Falcon chaser who had unfortunately been hit with a rather potent Bat Bogey Hex – was discharged from the hospital.
Draco slumped and let out a sigh of relief before he realised that he now had to try and explain to them that their best friend no longer knew who they

“Oh, don’t be embarrassed, Potter.  I fully approve.  In fact,” he leaned forward suggestively, “if I had known in school that you were so inclined I might have put my efforts into teasing you in a entirely different way.”
Pleasure tore through him as Harry sped up, his cock hitting the sweet spot inside him that had him crying out all manner of obscenities.
“I’ll have you know,” said Malfoy with mock indignation, “that Achilles is a perfectly respectable name for a snake. And anyway, it’s your fault for letting me name him.”
make each other miserable, but that was years ago. They were all adults now. He took a deep breath as Granger appeared in the fireplace.
Harry panicked as he frantically tried to recall who that had been.  Wait, hadn’t Malfoy been #5?  Or was that #6?  Harry stared down at his card, a horrible feeling that he’d been matched with the wizard who had talked about his kneazle for five minutes straight sinking like a ball of lead into his stomach.
“Yeah, mate.  It might not be too bad,” added Ron encouragingly, his cheerful tone slightly betrayed by the look of distaste he was currently giving to the confetti-strewn floor.  “I’ll just get us some drinks, shall I?”

“Do you have a preference for which university?” he asked. “Oxford and Cambridge, of course. But Kings College London and University College London are also very respectful establishments.”
He paced up and down the length of the waiting room, his tea long turned cold, and waited for someone to tell him that Harry would be fine.  That he was awake and smiling and laughing and asking for Draco.  Finally, after the tensest few hours Draco had ever experienced, the Mediwitch appeared at the door.
Maddie rolled her eyes. “Oh please. Give me some credit. I could see that you liked him as soon as he was admitted. Little tip, Draco; when trying to hide
Draco shivered in the early morning air. The light drizzle had slowly permeated his thin Healer robes, leaving him soaked through by the time that Maddie

Following his epiphany the night before, Harry had sent Hermione and, because Harry didn’t feel right about excluding one of his best friends from the plan, Ron urgent owls pleading them to meet with him.  Therefore, lunchtime found the three of them, heads bent together, squeezed around a small table in the Ministry of Magic cafeteria.
Draco loosened the top button of his robe, trying to get some much needed air to his overheated skin, and collapsed against the wall as disjointed thoughts
Draco couldn’t keep the stupid smile off his face as he left Harry’s room and returned to his spot behind the reception desk and could only manage a weak
Instead of the familiar scowl that Harry had been expecting, Malfoy’s face split into a beaming smile. Harry shivered. It was just because the expression looked so alien on Malfoy’s face, he told himself. Not because of the way the evening sun caught the grey in Malfoy’s eyes, turning them silver, or the way the casual black jeans lengthened his legs and clung in all the right places, or the way the fabric of his shirt rippled as Malfoy waved, exposing a hint of pale collarbone. Harry frowned and shook his head. He would have to tread carefully; this could all be part of Malfoy’s nefarious plan.
“It’s not that I can’t see myself as an Auror,” Harry was saying.  “I’m sure I’d be good at it and it’d be great to work with Ron, but it just doesn’t feel right for me anymore.  Oh, I don’t know.”
Harry woke up not fully knowing where he was.  Normally a situation like this would have launched him into fight or flight panic mode but something told him that he was safe.  He was warm, still slightly drowsy and there was a comforting pressure against his back.  Suddenly, the pressure shifted and muttered something that sounded suspiciously like his name.  Harry smiled.  Draco.  The night before came rushing back to him as he snuggled into his boyfriend’s embrace.
“Hm, I’m not sure,” Maddie smirked. “She might be back in. I could have sworn I saw her nose twitching on her way out.”
members ran onto the pitch and started firing jinxes left, right and centre. No one was seriously injured but a few players are being brought in to be
“Morning, Draco,” Harry replied and Draco felt a tingle go through him at the sound of his first name rolling off Harry’s tongue so naturally. He squirmed
“Draco?” Harry said, raising his head and peering into warm grey eyes. The face that he met was so familiar and yet old memories of scowls and sneers had been replaced by new ones of smiles and laughter and moans of pleasure. “I had a really great day today.”
Draco could tell that the other man could feel it too, this almost magnetic pull, this sense of rightness. The sudden lurch of the carriage as the tube departed the station jerked Draco back to himself. He had to get off the tube. He had to find this man.
“Good,” she declared as she took a seat at the bottom of Harry’s bed.  “Now, people are saying that you came in wearing a Slytherin scarf, Harry.”
Malfoy gave him an askance look. “We are a bit slow this morning. I know you told me to fuck your brains out last night but I didn’t know I’d done such a good job,” he said with a smirk. “Yes, although you drew the line at me naming him Salazar! Ron and Hermione thought it hilarious, you living with two snakes.”
Harry stood on Draco’s doorstep, dishevelled and out of breath as if he had ran the entire way here.
The doubts that had been plaguing Draco all day faded away. He couldn’t remember why he had ever been nervous. He was about to spend the rest of his life
“Oh, Merlin, I’d forgotten about that! Do you remember, I had to work for two days straight just to sort out that mess,” Granger said.
“You could have really hurt someone, Harry,” Hermione lectured later that evening in the common room.  “What if we had been brewing something more volatile?  You could have covered the whole class with it.”

“Here you are, Harry,” Ron said handing him a deep red cocktail topped with a cherry.  “No idea what’s in it but I thought you could do with a bit of liquid courage.”
“Come on,” Harry said, pulling a resistant Ron to his feet and making a start on his section of tables.
saw himself battle with Harry for the snitch. The two boys spiralled around each other, twisting and turning side by side like a strange airborne dance. It
Granted though, Draco’s reactions had often been a lot more negative than this strange sense of protectiveness he was feeling now.
And so Harry continued to watch.  Not that anyone really noticed, least of all Draco Malfoy.  Hermione and Ron were busy with their new jobs at the Ministry, Hermione having just started an internship in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, and Ron on the Auror Training Programme.  Harry had been offered a place with the Aurors as well but he found that he just couldn’t summon up his previous enthusiasm for it.  For anything in fact.  So he kept himself busy and watched Draco Malfoy and met up with his friends and watched Draco Malfoy some more.
Twenty minutes later Draco found himself in a position he could never have imagined in his wildest dreams. Or nightmares, depending on how you looked at
“Your boyfriend,” Maddie interrupted loudly, “will be all better. He’ll have all of his memories back, he can leave here and you two can go skipping off

indicating that they could talk outside. The last thing he wanted right now was for Potter to wake up before he had a chance to explain everything to her.
Harry navigated the corridors in a daze, thoughts whirring about in his head at a thousand miles a second.  Only when he entered the Gryffindor common room to stares and whispers did Harry realise that he was still wearing Malfoy’s scarf and only after he had escaped to the quiet of the seventh year dormitory did he realise that the Slytherin had called him Harry.

So much for being adults and moving on from their childhood rivalry, Draco sighed. “Granger,” he replied calmly. “I’m calling from Spell Damage at St
“Mate,” Ron started one evening, once the trio were comfortable at their regular corner table in the Three Broomsticks.  “Auror Training is absolutely brilliant.  We started on Concealment and Disguise today and the other courses are wicked as well.  You’d love it.  You should really think about taking Kingsley up on that offer.”
Hermione frowned in disapproval but nodded, taking Ron away and further into the fair. Malfoy shot Harry a curious look before following them into the crowd.
“Thank you for your company.  I had a lovely time.  Goodnight, Harry,” he said as he turned towards the dungeons.
He just couldn’t understand it. That album was full of people Harry cared about – Granger and Weasley, other assorted redheads, school friends – and there,
Harry smirked at him. “Yes, well,” Draco said with a dignified sniff. “I was doing it for the sake of the school. Can you image what would have happened if
Potter frowned at Draco and looked around the room in confusion. For a moment, Draco was worried that Potter’s hearing had been damaged and he was about to
“Oh, and by the way, Harry. I’ve invited Draco along tonight,” Hermione had said nonchalantly as she’d grabbed a handful of floo powder from the mantelpiece.
“Aw, come on, Draco,” Harry urged, shaking the box of sweets in his face.  “Look, we’ll do it together”.
Draco swore internally. Great job of blending in, idiot, he thought. He realised the real Harry wouldn't know anything about law entrance exams or university rankings. From what he could tell from the lack of textbooks and uniform in the bedroom, Harry had left school at sixteen and worked at the restaurant full time.
Draco knocked tentatively on Harry’s door – it still felt strange calling him that – and opened it when he heard a sleepy voice call out. He peered into
“Simple, Potter.  I missed it here.  There’s only so much of sipping tea and eating cake with your mother that a man can take.  Besides,” Malfoy smirked, “I’ve been out of the loop for too long.  Difficult to get hold of the Prophet in France, you know.  Makes you miss all sorts of important gossip.  For example, oh, I don’t know, why the once most eligible bachelor in Britain is taking part in wizards-only speed dating, hm?”
“Yeah, just ignore him, mate,” Ron agreed.  “Hey, can you imagine if Malfoy actually tried to hold your hand?” he laughed.
The three of them dissolved into laughter and laddish insults as Harry pondered to himself why, yet again, he found himself unable to join in.
something slip and upset Harry. It had taken all of his willpower to not run back and check on them but it turned out that he needn’t have worried at all.
Ron looked down at him in concern.  “Sorry, Harry, but you were making really weird noises.  Moaning and that.  I thought it might have been You-Know-Who in your head again.”
“But that’s why I need your help!” Harry beseeched.  “You haven’t seen what Malfoy’s like.  He just seems so… defeated.  I have to do this.  And I can’t do it without the two of you.”
making up for the early and much too cheerful wake up call. “I’ve been calling you from the Floo for ages.”
“I know, Hermione. But I’ve got a feeling about this,” he explained, surer than ever that this was something that he needed to do. “I’ll come find you guys when I’m done.”
Draco pulled every book he could reach from the shelves around him and made a start on the one closest.
It most certainly did not, Harry thought.  What if no one was attracted to him?  What if the card he received at the end of the night was blank?  He had no time to brood on this though as Maddie raised her voice once more.
Tears burned in his eyes at the hopelessness of it all but he held them back. He was a Malfoy and, no matter how much his name was dragged through the
Harry shrugged. He did remember Trelawney and, from Hermione’s many rants, knew how subjective and inconsistent divination was. But there was something about this witch, about the way she had picked him out of the busy crowd and spoken to him as if right next to his ear.
“Okay, so maybe I was a little shit,” Draco conceded, “but you were always up to something. Can you really blame me for trying to get you in trouble?”
Harry speared his fork into a nearby piece of bacon, his good mood from this morning had vanished in an instant.
“Right then,” Ron coughed, breaking the tense silence. Harry let go of the hand still encased in his and, in an excuse to hide his slightly flushed face, turned away to look at the fair.
“Sorry,” Draco started, loath to banish the source of Harry’s happiness. “My shift is over soon so I’m afraid that you’ll have to leave.” Harry’s face fell
Malfoy sighed. “I know, I sometimes wonder that myself. How did two people who hated each other so much get to this point? The truth is, Harry, I don’t think I ever really hated you. I think I was jealous and angry and resentful but, after the war, that all just seemed so… insignificant.” Malfoy took a sip of wine and swirled his glass as he continued. “After that, I must confess that I developed a bit of a crush! Hermione and Ron spoke about you a lot, of course, and I think they had an inkling about how I felt so they just kept trying to find ways of getting us to meet. Me coming along to the fair was their idea. Merlin, that was a disaster at first! I remember you being so guarded, almost like you thought I was going to summon the Dark Lord there and then!” He chuckled, stroking Harry’s hair away from his forehead with a free hand. “And that photo booth! I was so embarrassed, seeing myself staring at you like a smitten teenager. But then you seemed to warm to me. You wowed me with your charms and I was gone.”
that they were made to do this, that every moment they had spent not doing this had been a complete waste of time.
climbed to his feet, his legs protesting the movement after being in one position for so long, and warily opened the front door, his jaw dropping in
With the ward quiet once more, Draco went in search of Maddie. He found her in Potter’s room, sitting in a chair next at his bedside and regarding the

Draco obediently slumped onto the sofa, sighing as he breathed in the smell of hot coffee. By the time Maddie brought over a towering plate of toast, he

I must have hit my head harder than I thought, Harry mused as the Slytherin dropped to his knees beside him.  “I think I’m alright.”  He attempted to sit up and hissed as pain laced down his left arm.  He clutched the injured arm to his chest, snitch still twitching in his right hand as hot tears burned in his eyes.

Looking down at the hand still resting on his arm, Harry asked tactlessly – Harry had never had much tact – “Are you Dra- my girlfriend?”
Out the corner of his eye Harry saw Ron open his mouth in protest and quickly shut it again at a stern look from Hermione.
Malfoy stepped forward to greet them, kissing Hermione on one cheek and shaking hands with Ron. Noticing Harry, his smile faded a little and he took a deep breath.
Pansy sighed as her stomach rumbled once again.  At this rate there’ll be no breakfast left, she thought dolefully as the smell of bacon and eggs wafted out of the Great Hall.  She glanced across at her best friend who was nervously pacing trails into the already worn cobblestones of the corridor.  She supposed she should be used to it by now – after six years Potter-watching was as much a part of her daily routine as brushing her hair – but she had to admit that it was getting out of hand.
Maddie slumped down in the chair next to him and took a bite out of a half melted chocolate frog as she reached out for the pile of paperwork from their
“Er, hi,” he said, instantly forgetting every piece of advice Hermione had given him about being confident.  All he could think was that Draco was smiling at him and that he was seconds away from saying something completely stupid like how soft his hair looked.  “I still have your scarf,” Harry blurted out.
Damn. That was twice now he’d been caught staring dreamily at Potter. Keep it in your fucking pants, Draco, he reprimanded himself.
Draco laughed, the tension in him draining as he remembered a similar conversation taking place between the two of them long ago. “You wish,” he smirked.

Harry arrived at Hogwarts the next day with renewed vigour.  Today was the day, the start of Operation Fix Draco Malfoy, and Harry was ready.  This was what he had been missing since the end of the war, a sense of purpose, of having someone to help.  He searched the crowd for Malfoy and found him standing by the side of the castle, alone as usual.  The rest of the volunteers ignored Malfoy as they chatted and readied themselves for another day of work.

dumbstruck look on Draco’s face as he finally understood the reason why the trio were so impossibly jammy in school. “So they took the dragon away but on
Draco held his breath as Harry got to his feet. His movements were slow and cautious, almost as if Draco were some wild animal he was trying not to spook.
Seeing the determined set to Hermione’s jaw and feeling another lecture coming on, Harry panicked and quickly changed the subject onto the first thing that popped into his head.
Ah.  Harry could understand that.  After the mistakes made during the war, the Ministry of Magic had gone to the other extreme, charging people as Death Eaters right, left and centre.  “So why come back?”
“Uh hu- Wait, what?!” Harry had choked out, the hand that was uselessly trying to pat down the mess of dark hair on his head pausing in mid air; he was sure that he had misheard her.
Draco glared back at Maddie, silently promising revenge, but softened as Pott- damn it; he supposed he would have to call him Harry now
Draco was not avoiding Harry Potter. He just had a lot of work to do, that was all. That he had managed to drag out the check-ups on his ward patients to
Harry felt like he should be disappointed at her words. Hadn't he just been turned down? But instead he smiled in relief. Yeah, they were friends, and he was lucky to have someone like Cho who would look out for him.

“You came out for a walk and you didn’t think to bring a coat?” Malfoy questioned.  “Honestly, Gryffindors.”  The blond stopped in front of Harry, unwound the green and silver striped scarf from around his neck and placed it carefully onto Harry.
confusion. Draco chastised himself for getting distracted and turned to face the Aurors, blaming his recent sexual drought for the way his eyes lingered on
“Your future,” the witch paused, examining the last rune closely. “Your future is what you let it be. I see happiness and love if you would but open yourself to it. But I also see loneliness and despair, if you do not.”
A loud quack from the direction of the corridor made Draco jump and, breaking eye contact, he hastily let go of Harry’s hand, aware that he was turning a
“Actually, I’ve just had a call from the manager of the Falmouth Falcons. Apparently during their game against the Wimbourne Wasps one of the audience
“…Er, I mean… erm… do you have any idea what you’re going to do when you finish your community service?  I used to want to join the Aurors but I’m not so sure anymore.  Ron’s there now and Kingsley has said that I’m welcome to start whenever I’m ready but I just think that I want to do something different.  But what else could I do, y’know.  I guess I could play professional Quidditch, but I’ve always wanted to do something useful, something to help people and…”
Of course, it didn’t help one bit that, being a NEWT student, Harry now took classes with all other students in his year.  Classes that included Malfoy.  His lack of concentration continued all through the day: in Herbology Harry had dropped a rather large pot of soil onto Ron’s foot, in Transfiguration the hedgehog he was supposed to be changing into a pincushion had spontaneously combusted, showering the entire class with spines in the process, and in Charms one of his non-verbal spells had backfired and nearly set Neville on fire.
“Can I ask you a question?” Harry slurred, already a glass and a half of wine down and counting. Somehow he had ended up with his head on Malfoy’s shoulder and didn’t quite have the energy or the inclination to move just yet.
“Well we met Draco there – you were really unhappy about that,” she said with a smile. “If I recall you and Ron ate an excessive amount of treacle tart, we went on a few rides, I think you went to see a fortune teller but you wouldn’t tell anyone what she’d said-“
Draco guided Harry through his first few turns and was impressed when he turned out to be a quick learner. By the end of the game Harry understood what
Of course, there were the more serious cases. When Draco had first started as a trainee Healer the ward had been packed with witches and wizards still
He spun around and came face to face with a snake. About four foot in length, the snake was lying in a shallow pool of water inside a giant glass tank. It looked completely unconcerned to see Harry and seemed to think that the whole situation was perfectly normal.
from The Tales of Beedle the Bard. He had just got to the best part in The Fountain of Fair Fortune, the bit where the knight declares his love for Amata,
Harry rolled his eyes and, true to his word, bought them a round of butterbeer once they were ensconced in a cosy corner booth at the Three Broomsticks.  He had tried to convince himself that the hushed whispers and curious stares that had started upon their arrival had been nothing more than his imagination but he had to admit that the sight of Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy going for a drink together must have been a strange one to see.
It couldn’t be.  But the longer Harry stared the more he realised that there was no mistaking it.  Looking ridiculously out of place among the pink streamers and heart-shaped confetti, and currently sneering at the poor wizard unlucky enough to be placed opposite him, was Draco Malfoy.
As they entered through the door, Potter’s head shot up, his eyes desperately latching onto to Draco’s. Draco immediately crossed the room and placed a
Harry jumped as the screeching of benches signalled the end of breakfast, giving the pair mere seconds warning before a flood of students poured through the double doors and into the entrance hall.
As Malfoy stood up, he sent Harry a small smile and reached over to give his hand a reassuring squeeze.  He made his way out of the hall and Harry stared thoughtfully at the retreating figure, his thumb tentatively rubbing over the place Malfoy had touched his hand.  He was in serious trouble.
Just when Draco thought that he couldn’t take it a single second longer, Harry stopped. Draco whimpered, head whipping up in desperation to stare at the
Harry felt a moment of sheer panic before he realised that the girl was talking about Draco, not him.
“Hey, it’s alright,” Draco said calmly as he removed his jacket and passed it to Cho. She wrapped it around her waist gratefully.
Harry shook his head and sighed as he headed to the bar for another drink.  Okay, so he may have followed Malfoy around occasionally in sixth year, and he might have been staring at him a little bit recently, but that didn’t mean anything.  It’s not like he was obsessed or anything.
The oaf happened to be a large boy with flame-red hair and more freckles than Draco had a desire to count, who stood in the hallway with his hand raised and ready to pound another deafening blow into the door.
“Mate,” Ron began hesitantly. “You haven’t been doing that thing again, have you?  You know, like in school where you spent a whole year staring at him and following him around and all that?”
to have lost nearly all of your memory from before the accident but all signs so far suggest that this is a temporary memory loss. We’re not sure how long
The witch stared at him, her eyes glinting mischievously in the gloom. “Ah,” she croaked. “I see that you might need more than that. A push, maybe? Very well. I will give you a rare gift: a glimpse into your near future. When you leave this place, you will wake far from here and will have a chance to see what could be yours,” she paused, before adding, “if only you would shed the fear of rejection that clings to your very soul.”
“Goodbye, Harry,” Maddie sing-songed as she left the room. Harry sent her a glancing wave but his eyes lingered on Draco’s as the Healer reluctantly backed
Draco steeled himself, tempted to hide in the relative safety of the room until whatever was happening to him stopped happening. But then you’ll never find out what’s going on, another part of him whispered conspiratorially as the oaf outside continued to hammer the door. Draco’s curiosity got the better of him. He held his breath as he cracked open the door and peered into the hallway beyond.
Draco laughed. “I could bring you some books if you’d like,” he said. “I’ve got loads at home and I can guarantee they’d be a lot more interesting than
“Why do you even care?” Harry asked.  He couldn’t figure it out.  Up until now it had seemed like Malfoy was messing with him but this was different.  This wasn’t him trying to distract Harry; he was acting like he genuinely cared.
And if he had the smallest trace of doubt about Draco, even the tiniest hint that he was making the wrong decision, the look of amazement on the Slytherin’s face at hearing Harry say his name would have blasted it to shreds.
Harry went to walk back into the kitchen but was stopped short by the sight of Malfoy leaning against the doorway. He was watching Harry with a predatory gaze, the kind of look that made Harry want to run away and move closer at the same time.
“Shit.  You’re hurt.  Here, let me help you up.”  Malfoy shifted, reaching around Harry and lifting him to his feet.
It happened again a few weeks later. Draco had fallen asleep in his bed, relaxed and looking forward to a weekend of doing absolutely nothing, and was rudely awakened by the sound of car horns from outside his window. Scratch that. From outside
“It’s okay,” Draco said reassuringly as Potter’s confusion begin to morph into panic. “You’ve been unconscious for a while; it’s perfectly normal for you
twice as long as usual, or that had he refused to even look at the door to Harry’s room since arriving at St Mungo’s an hour ago, was beside the point. It
Harry’s day had been much less eventful than Draco’s. Rather than suffering through his dreaded Sunday lunchtime shift at work, he had instead spent the day relaxing in the grounds of the posh private school, lounging in the sun with Pansy and generally having a lovely time. Before getting into bed that night, he had rolled his eyes at the note left for him by Draco. Just as dramatic as he’d imagined.
Harry smiled awkwardly. Even after all these years, he still wasn’t quite comfortable with posing for magical photos. I mean, it’s just going to be a 5 second loop of me looking like an idiot, he thought.
Harry took a deep breath and nervously wiped his hands on his jeans as he moved one seat to his left.  Grey eyes widened in shock as he sat down, blasting Harry’s theory that Malfoy had been taunting him all evening out of the window.

Harry hesitated as twenty or so wizards from around the pub made their way to find a seat and, at Hermione’s shooing motion, took the last seat opposite a nervous looking brunet.
By the time the evening sun faded, Draco had worked his way through Charm Your Own Cheese, Hogwarts a History and was currently reading his favourite story
“Oh, don’t be silly. Why don’t you go sit down and wake up while I make us some breakfast,” she waved him away as she busied herself in the kitchen.
The fight was over before Harry knew it. The bad guys had been taken completely by surprise and, in no time at all, the Aurors were securing their
Draco looked up sluggishly, still caught up in the enigma that was Harry Potter, and followed Maddie’s line of sight down the ward, comprehension dawning
“I love you too,” he said and, feeling Harry smile against his neck, reflected that maybe karma wasn’t so bad after all.
When it was time for the captains to shake hands, Malfoy clasped Harry’s in his and leaned forward.  “Good luck out there, Potter.  I don’t know how I’m going to be able to keep an eye on the snitch instead of you in those robes,” he said with a wink and stepped back to mount his broom.

Harry couldn't stop grinning. He'd made plans to meet with Draco this weekend. Actually seeing each other face to face! Not that Harry hadn't seen Draco's face before but, well, never when Draco was actually present.
She looked pleadingly at him and Harry sulkily crossed his arms in resignation. It’s not as though he had anything better to do, he supposed. After all, the last thing he wanted was to sit around in Grimmauld Place by himself all evening, surrounded by gloom and dust and old memories.
“And that’s it, gents!  That’s the end of our speed dating night.  I do hope you’ve enjoyed yourself and, who knows, maybe even met someone who’s caught your fancy,” Maddie winked and Harry felt the tips of his ears blush as he resolutely stared ahead, determined not to turn around and look at a certain blond.  “But please don’t hurry off.  Your shared chemistry results will be with you shortly so stick around, have a drink and thank you for coming!”

Harry jolted his head up from where he had been sullenly inspecting the table and green eyes latched onto grey.
young Harry looking proud in Gryffindor colours. Draco smiled, remembering the small, baby-faced boy he had once tried to befriend.
“But thank you, though,” Harry said.  He took a deep breath; here goes nothing.  “Er, I could give it back to you on Saturday.”
“You have no idea,” Harry laughed.  “There’s a rumour going round that I’ve been kidnapped and replaced with a Slytherin spy.”
Strong hands moved up to Draco’s shoulders and pushed, causing the blond to go sprawling on the bed. He glanced up and felt his cock twitch; Harry was
Draco was never so touchy with patients but Potter had always been different; had always been able to get under Draco’s skin and get a reaction out of him.

Goosebumps erupted along Harry’s arms as she spoke. The magic in the words was undeniable. She held out a wrinkled hand and Harry hesitantly reached out, jumping slightly as he met ice-cold skin. The witch raised her other hand and, with an incoherent mumble, dropped a set of what looked like wooden dice on the table. Each had more sides than Harry could count and were carved with strange symbols. The witch examined them intently before speaking.

Pansy suddenly jumped to her feet. “Anyway, no use crying over split milk. It’s Saturday and I want to do something fun.”
Harry stared at him, filing away Malfoy’s casual use of his first name for a time when he didn’t feel like he was going mad.
Harry ignored Hermione’s outburst and glanced towards Ron, who stared back at him, gobsmacked.  Harry didn’t expect them to understand why he wanted to do this but he hoped they would help him anyway.  They had been through so much together that Harry felt like he could tell them anything and that they would always be there for him.  He had already told them of his not-quite-there heterosexuality and it made him smile to remember how supportive they had both been.
family rivalries run deep, after all, but he soon thawed to Draco when they met at a Chudley Cannons vs. Kenmare Kestrels game and found that they both
The home screen gave nothing away – no smiling photo of friends or family to give Draco any hint of who’s body he was currently inhabiting. Just a long string of unread messages discussing the merits of some poor girl’s tits versus her arse. Draco rolled his eyes.
As they said their goodbyes and Harry turned towards Gryffindor tower, he braced himself for the barrage of questions that he knew would be awaiting him there.
“So where were you?” Harry asked quietly, oddly vulnerable as the fight drained out of him. “Did what happened in the hospital mean nothing to you?”
Harry paused, wondering where the hell to start. “Erm, not that great, Hermione. You see, I don’t really know where I am.”
Injuries with my last box of liquorice wands to keep an eye on the ward for me.” She peered closer at her friend as this failed to draw any kind of
Harry nodded and leaned forward to listen. “Well, this is your king,” Draco explained, going through each piece, its uses and its movements. “It’ll
“Now, I suggest you all head home and get a good night’s rest. We’ll contact the Auror office in the morning to report on Mr. Potter’s progress,” Draco
“It was great,” Harry gushed. “They told me loads of stories from when we were at Hogwarts. You were in some of them, Draco.”
Harry pursed his lips in thought, hand hovering over the board. “I could move my knight,” he said, touching the piece and beginning to move it.
Harry nodded.  “Yeah.  Sounds good.”  There was no way in hell he’d manage to get much work done sitting next to Draco but, oh well.  He could always beg Hermione to let him copy off her later.
Harry glanced around, trying to place the voice in the busy crowd. His eyes fell upon a shrivelled old witch whose liver-spotted hands were beckoning him over to her. As if caught on an invisible fishing line, Harry weaved through the crowd toward her until he reached a dark, inconspicuous tent, almost unnoticed amongst the brightness of the other stands and stalls. The witch smiled at him encouragingly. Noticing that their friend was no longer behind them, Hermione and Ron turned and followed Harry, Malfoy trailing behind them.
Cautiously, Draco stood up to take a better look at his surroundings and jumped in shock when he realised something else. Those were not his legs. Those were not his arms or hands or feet or-

“Well, I think that’s my cue to go.  See you around, Potter,” Draco said with a wink as he escaped the sudden noise of the Hospital Wing.
“Hey, mate. What took you so long?” The ginger oaf grinned at him. “Did you forget we have our shift in an hour?”
Draco looked at Harry lying peacefully on the bed, memories hopefully reforming in his head as he slept, and came to a decision. He had to get out of
Feeling the nervous energy coiling in his gut, Draco stood up from the bed and began to hurriedly pack the chess set away. “Right. Goodnight, Harry,” he

“Harry! Over here,” shouted Ron. “You’re just in time, mate. We were just about to get some treacle tart.”
It wasn’t until Harry heard his teeth chatter that he realised that he had forgot to bring his coat.  His school uniform was hardly enough to keep away the evening chill and he found that once he started shivering he couldn’t stop.
“I’ve been in love with you for years, although, if I’m being honest with myself, I think it started long before that. After all, it’s always been you,

way the Potter’s face lit up when he smiled – such a change from the scowls and smirks he had received from the man in school – that it took Maddie’s elbow
Draco glared daggers at the retreating Gryffindors as the doors to the Great Hall slammed shut behind them.  “Not worth it?  Not bloody worth it, am I?  Fucking weasel.  Fucking Potter,” he muttered under his breath as he sagged against the wall next to Pansy.  “I can’t even get a fucking rise out of him anymore.  What am I supposed to do, Pans?”
Harry had been shaking with nerves as he closed the door behind them.  It wasn’t the first time Draco had been to Twelve Grimmauld Place but there was something about that night, the way the air crackled between them like the calm before a storm, full of tension and expectation that had put Harry on edge.  He could tell that Draco felt it too; the way the blond had lingered in the hallway almost shyly, uncharacteristically waiting for Harry to make the first move.  This was new for both of them.
“Hey, it’s early days still. Don’t worry if things aren’t coming back yet.” Draco took a seat next to the bed. “May I see?”
Granger and Weasley had arrived to see Harry at some point during the commotion and, once he had finished up with his last patient, Draco found himself
“Okay, that’s fine. Can you tell me the names of your closest friends?” Draco asked, sure that Potter couldn’t possibly have been hit so hard as to make
“You know, I think the food is the thing I miss most about this place.  Best treacle tart ever,” Harry mumbled as he finished his pie and shoved a forkful of tart into his mouth, a small moan of ecstasy escaping his lips.  He looked up at Malfoy to see the man staring back at him, a look of astonishment on his face.  Harry tried to smile around his mouthful of dessert and was rewarded with an amused smirk from Malfoy before the man stood up from the bench.
“Urgh,” Harry groaned, putting down the Auror spy thriller he had been reading for the past hour and rubbing his hands over his face. “I don’t think I can
Draco saw her mouth open and, having previous experience of just how loud Maddie could be, hastily held a finger to his lips and pointed to the corridor,

that it would probably be best if they started over – and he now felt lucky to count her among his close friends. Ron had been a bit more difficult, old
“H- hey, h- how are you doing?” Harry stammered in greeting, cringing internally and taking the seat opposite her.
Harry shouted out in pleasure. It had been so long since he’d been touched by someone other than himself. Being Harry Potter wasn’t really conducive to one-night stands and there had been no one since Ginny who had been worth the risk. But this was something else.
“I don’t understand,” Draco said, finally finding his voice. “Are you saying that you wanted me to be there when you woke up?”
“Faster. Please, faster,” he begged, throwing his head back in abandon as the hand on his cock sped up; the quiet moans coming from the wizard above him
Harry made it all the way back to the flat and inside his room before he allowed the thoughts that had been trickling through his mind all afternoon to take purchase. Ok, just because your date with Cho didn't go as expected, it doesn't mean anything, Harry reasoned with himself. You just weren't attracted to her like that and that's fine. Although, if Harry was being honest with himself he couldn't remember the last girl he had found attractive in that way.

At Harry’s nod, Draco grabbed his hand and, leading him into full view of the diners in the Great Hall, dipped his head down to kiss him.  And, ignoring the outraged shouts and shocked gasps, Harry threw his arms around the Draco’s neck and kissed him back with all he had.
As the tables cleared, Harry peered around for Ron and Hermione.  Pushing past a very drunk man wearing heart-patterned briefs on his head, he spotted a flash of red hair and eventually found his friends snuggled up in a corner booth and surrounded by a large number of empty cocktail glasses.

The hospital Floo was thankfully quiet at this time of night and Draco soon found himself spinning into his fireplace. He stepped out onto his carpet,
Draco stared at her in stunned silence, hope blooming in his eyes as he mulled over Maddie’s words. “You really think so?” he asked, voice cracking.

“It’s such a lovely evening; I think I might take a walk around the lake.  Would you like to join me?” Malfoy asked and, before he could think about what he was doing, Harry found himself nodding.
He stared down into his dinner and pushed his plate away; his stomach was too wrapped up in knots for Harry to even consider food.
“What was that all about?” Maddie burst out as soon as they were out of earshot. “You can’t just cuddle a patient like that. You could get into real
reassuringly when an anxious frown replaced his smile. “Hey, relax. They’ve been your best friends since you were eleven. You’ve nothing to worry about,”
Harry bit his lip.  She was right; they were his best friends and had stayed by his side through so much.  He took a deep breath.  “It was Malfoy.”
He huffed a laugh under his breath. Bravery had never been Draco's forte – this had to be Harry's influence. Harry, who had risked so much to escape a life that made him miserable and who had chosen Draco to confide in. Draco could hardly believe his luck. Inhaling a deep breath, Draco steeled himself - he could be brave too – and moved the pen in elegant swirls across the paper.
Once again, words failed Draco as he nodded in answer.  He stared blankly into his hands, worried beyond belief for the safety of the man who had turned his world upside down in just a few short months.  Harry, with his easy smile that Draco was once so confused to be faced with but now couldn’t imagine not seeing every day.  Harry, with his mystifying but utterly endearing ability to talk for hours on end about seemingly anything.  Draco could see him now, the way his eyes would light up when he talked about something he was passionate about, and the way he would smirk victoriously when he made Draco laugh.  Merlin, he couldn’t lose him.  He just couldn’t.
“Good morning!” Maddie chirped – Draco cursed himself for ever giving her access to his Floo – the a fresh cup of coffee she handed to him only slightly
Draco smiled back at the Gryffindor and, reaching out, clasped a warm hand around Harry’s.  “Definitely.”
The hands on his shoulder shifted, one moving to tangle in his hair and the other coming to rest on his lower back, pulling him in closer as Harry moved
The image of a shocked Great Hall as their fisticuffs turned to something else flashed through his head and Harry couldn’t help the laugh that escaped him.  “Ron would’ve had a heart attack.  It’d almost serve him right, the amount of awful dates he’s set me up on.  One guy actually asked for a lock of my hair,” he grimaced.
the darkened room and spelled the curtains open, immediately regretting his decision as the early morning light spilled onto the man in front of him. At
After shovelling down some slightly singed toast - courtesy of a girl he assumed was Hermione but who had barely lifted her head from an enormous book to say good morning - Draco was unceremoniously dragged from the flat by the ginger boy he now knew was called Ron. And there he stopped. What greeted Draco outside was so far removed from life as he knew it that he couldn’t help but gape at the scene around him in awe.
He took a calming breath and led his team out of the changing room, the cheers and boos from the crowd echoing around him.  He noticed Malfoy right away.  The Slytherin team were waiting in the middle of the pitch and Malfoy was easily distinguishable by his tall, slim frame and his hair, which seemed nearly golden in the sunlight.
“Of course I do,” Draco said assuredly. “As do you, Mother,” he added at Narcissa’s raised eyebrow. She did, in fact, look wonderful in elegant, silver

“Why not?” Harry asked.  “Everyone says it’s the perfect job for me.  No one can understand why I’ve been putting it off for so long.”
“However,” Draco continued, the pair’s cautious smiles freezing, “it is my opinion that, in order for Harry to recover, it would be best if he is told as
Hermione, however, was not the least bit shocked.  It would have taken someone with the emotional range of a teaspoon to miss the sexual tension between those two.  “Oh, Ron,” she sighed, taking in her boyfriend’s puzzled and slightly alcohol addled expression.  “Let’s go home.  I’ll explain in the morning.”
Harry chucked at the image of Malfoy jumping out at him like a vampire from some cheesy Muggle movie and helped himself to a large serving of bacon.  “You’re probably right, Hermione.  I’ll just ignore him.”
Seven years as an Auror had definitely helped to rein in Harry’s impulsive nature but he was still a Gryffindor at heart and so, as the other members of
Now that Ron mentioned it, Harry’s throat did feel a bit sore.  In fact, he felt weird all over.  Hot and sweaty and why did his boxers feel so damn tight?!  Oh shit, Harry thought as glimpses of his dream came back to him in a rush of blond hair, warm skin and the scent of grass.  His face flushed red.
Ever since the shower incident, as Harry was calling it now, he had been in a complete daze.  It wasn’t the first time he had had a sexy dream – he was a teenage boy, after all – but it was the first time that the usual blurry images and vague shapes had manifested into a specific person.  And a male person at that!
Later that day as he got ready for bed, Harry mused that after a day spent being dragged around by Pansy, her arm linked with his, had been the most relaxed and carefree he’d felt in a long time. No worry about if he was going to be able to make his rent that month. No pressure to put a happy face on for customers. No fear that he’d say the wrong thing in front of his friends, and they’d realise- Well, they’d realise that Harry was different from them in a way that he wasn’t keen to examine just yet.
“Huh,” Harry mumbled as everything slid into place: Draco’s weird behaviour recently, the compliments, the touching, the scarf.  He had been flirting.
any time soon – images and thoughts of Harry were still whirring about in his head – and so, spotting the new edition of

Dismissing the nausea bubbling inside him as nerves, Harry took a deep breath and replied to Cho's text, arranging to meet her for a coffee that afternoon.
“So, have you guys noticed that Malfoy’s been around a lot recently?” he asked, and instantly regretted his choice of topic when Ron and Hermione shared a look that clearly said
Harry picked miserably at his porridge.  Thoughts of Malfoy had plagued his mind all night and yet he was no closer to figuring out what the blond was up to.  He fought the urge to glance over at the Slytherin table for the hundredth time this morning – he didn’t want anyone to get the wrong idea, after all – and instead stared intently at his plate.
“He’s going to be ok.  He’s not awake yet but, if you’d like, you can go and see him,” she smiled at Draco’s enthusiastic nod and continued.  “We’ve had to alert Harry’s next of kin, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger, so they’ll be arriving soon as well.”
Harry looking up at him, green eyes staring into his with a different kind of warmth entirely. He felt a blush creep up his neck and swallowed, willing the

Harry gratefully accepted the drink and took a large swig, savouring the surprisingly pleasant flavour of liquorice and berries on his tongue as he looked around the room.  It was actually quite a good turn out.  When Hermione had first suggested coming along Harry had been worried that he’d be the only one there – out and proud wizards weren’t exactly easy to find after all – but the pub was getting busier by the minute.  His friends chatted on as Harry glanced surreptitiously at the other participants under the guise of drinking his cocktail.  Some of them didn’t look too bad, he supposed.  Maybe.
“Because I called dibs,” she explained, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. “But seriously, you do need to calm down.” She came to stand in
As he pressed the save button, his eyes took on a vacant glaze. Huh? What had he been doing? He was... excited for something? For someone? He looked down at the phone in his hand. Yes, he had been leaving a message for someone. But for who? Someone important, Harry knew with certainty. But for the life of him he couldn't remember. As he flicked through the notes on his phone for clues, the text began to blur and wobble, erasing one line at a time until only the most recent note remained.
Draco hadn’t realised how raised his voice had become until he noticed the stunned expression on Maddie’s face. He coughed to hide his embarrassment and
“Hey,” Maddie said, noticing that through all of this Draco hadn’t smiled once. “Aren’t you supposed to be happy? I mean, your boyfriend-“
An insult ready on his tongue, Harry paused and realised that the malicious sneer he remembered so well was missing from Malfoy’s face. He’s joking with me.  Draco Malfoy is joking with me.  Harry settled for blushing bright red.
Draco’s face fell and he rushed out of the waiting room, determined to make sure that Harry was fine before Weasley and Granger arrived and kicked him out.  He doubted they would be too happy to find an ex-Death Eater next to their best friend’s bedside and refused to entertain the notion that they would be approving of this new… friendship?... more than friendship?... well whatever it was that had grown between him and Harry in the past few months.
“Hey,” Harry huffed, immediately grateful that he had the excuse of catching his breath to silently admire Draco who, he had to admit, looked fan-fucking-tastic.
“Oh! Er, yes! That would be-“ Draco stammered, his face flushing in a very familiar way, “that would be nice.”
The girl smiled in response. Relieved, Draco slid into an empty chair and picked up a piece of toast. As he looked around for the marmalade, Hermione passed him a large white jar. Draco looked at it sceptically. Fluff? What the hell was Fluff? He glanced up at Hermione questioningly but she had turned back to her book, so Draco unscrewed the lid and took a cursory sniff. Urgh! He knew Pansy had said that Harry had a fondness for sweets, but this was tooth decay in a jar! Draco pushed the jar away with the tip of his finger and settled for simple butter.
Harry was sat on his bed, fully dressed in hospital pyjamas – thank Merlin – and smiled when he saw Draco.

shook his head. Maddie stretched her arms around him and the tears he had been holding back all day finally broke free.
Malfoy knew.  Harry could just tell as he met the Slytherin’s eyes across the Great Hall.  He flushed scarlet, convinced that his dirty secret was laid bare on his face and that Malfoy could see every perverted thought racing around in his mind.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Thank you very much for your input, Mr I-have-a-tikka-masala-every-time, but, unlike you with your delicate sensibilities, I’m actually adventurous when it comes to trying different food.”
Harry sent a last, pleading look at Ron’s back as it disappeared into the small crowd that surrounded the bar and put up little resistance when Hermione latched a small, but deceptively strong, hand around his forearm and unceremoniously led him to the registration desk.

Draco raised an eyebrow and led them out into the cool spring air.  “Not everything I own is green and silver.  And anyway, blue is my favourite colour.”

The thought stayed with him as he walked Cho to the tube station later. Shouldn't he feel different being on a date? Maybe it was good that Harry felt so comfortable with Cho, but he also didn't feel... well, anything else. No sparks or butterflies or excitement.
“Me too, Cho. See you at work tomorrow,” he replied, noticing the flash of relief across her face as she waved and started down the steps.

being stretched open, his gasp echoed above him as pain turned to pleasure and Harry, fully seated inside him, leaned forward to capture his lips in a
“Yes, Ron.  Flirting.  What do you think he’s been doing for the past year or so?  Constantly trying to get Harry’s attention, picking fights with him, following him around.  It’s textbook pigtail pulling.”
“Well,” Hermione sighed and closed her book, resigned to the fact that she was unlikely to get any more reading done this morning, “maybe he was just on his way out.”
At the next station, Draco leapt from the carriage and dashed to the nearest exit. Mentally calculating the fastest way to get back to the previous stop, he manoeuvred around pedestrians and traffic, earning himself several blaring car horns and shouts to watch where he was going. He arrived at the station out of breath, panting as he folded over and rested his hands on his shaking knees, and searched the bustling crowd for the man.
Hermione smiled smugly at Ron who looked as though someone had just told him that Dobby was his father.  “So,” Ron thought out loud as if trying to make sense of everything, “Malfoy likes Harry and apparently has been flirting with him all year.  And Harry likes Malfoy and has his scarf hidden under his pillow.  That about right?”
Draco sighed. Now that it came to it he found that he really didn’t want to leave Harry at all but he could feel the ache in his limbs and the pressure
“Yeah?” Harry asked as he finally grasped what Draco was saying, a smile emerging and threatening to take over his whole face when Draco nodded in reply.
Harry blinked as the flashing lights and bright colours assaulted his eyes. He stared at the people and sights around him, trying to orientate himself. Yes, he was back at the fair. The old witch’s spell had worked. He had seen his future and now had the chance to make it happen. What was it she had said? “So if you want, you must not falter, your future lies within your hand.” Then that was exactly what he was going to do.
Just as Harry was about to demand more of an explanation, the harried figure of Madam Pomfrey came bustling round the corner of the corridor.  “Oh, Mr. Potter.  What have you done to yourself this time?  Well, let’s get you to the Hospital Wing and fix you up,” she said, supporting Harry’s other side and leading the pair to the ward.
Over the next days and weeks Harry found himself falling more and more for Draco Malfoy.  With the end of Draco’s self-imposed silence, their lunch-time conversations were now much less one-sided - although Draco still seemed happy to let Harry ramble on as he listened with an amused smile - and Harry began to think that perhaps his feelings for the blond were also less one-sided than he’d originally thought.  More than once he had felt eyes on him and looked up to see Draco regarding him fondly.  Harry was sure that just yesterday, while he was indulging in a particularly well-earned stretch, he had caught Draco staring at him, admiration clear on his face, before the blond had blushed and looked away.  Yes, Harry thought, Draco was interested.  Now he just had to make his move, but how?
“Don’t remind me,” Weasley laughed. “I don’t think Mum will ever forgive you for missing Sunday lunch.”

Harry looked at the setup with trepidation.  He understood the basics of speed dating, sure – you chat with someone for a few minutes, see if you hit it off and then move on to the next person – but this was wizard speed dating.  He gulped nervously, relieved when a familiar freckled face appeared next to him.

“So,” Draco tried, feeling that he should probably try to make an effort if he was going to blend in as Harry. “How is… that… going?” He asked lamely, pointing at the book.

“The diagnostics are all clear. It’ll be nearly impossible to know what spell hit him until he wakes up and he doesn’t seem to be in any hurry to do that,”
“I’m sorry,” Draco blurted out, anticipating Harry’s anger and desperately shoving away the morsel of hope that had bloomed deep down inside him at seeing
Now, he followed the girl through a grand archway and into a room Harry had never seen the like of in his life. The entire room was panelled in rich, dark wood and the stone floor was smooth as if worn down by hundreds of years’ worth of footsteps. Students of all ages milled around long oak tables that ran down the middle of the room and, at the far end of the room, adults in strange robes – Harry assumed they must be the teachers - sat stoically enjoying their morning tea and coffee.
Draco shot her an affronted look.  She knew that look too well.  It was the look that accompanied his well-practiced speech about haven’t we been friends forever and you know I would do anything for you, Pans that always had her giving in and doing whatever he wanted.  Lucky for her, the Gryffindorks chose that moment to come charging down the staircase like the unruly brutes they were and Pansy stepped back to watch the show as Draco’s gaze locked onto Potter.
The wizard looked relieved and smiled.  Not a bad smile either, Harry noticed.  “Me neither.  But I guess we should start with our names and what we do for a living?”
“I’ll just go and let Harry know you’re here then,” he said, turning and making his way down the ward and towards the private room. He knocked quietly just
He flushed as images of what had come next filled his head: images of kissing along pale skin, of grey eyes that scrunched shut in pleasure and of pink lips that parted to shout “Harry!” as Draco fell over the edge.
Harry nodded back at him enthusiastically and smiled. “Draco,” he said, reaching out and clasping Draco’s hand as he moved to draw his wand. “I just wanted

Harry jumped and coughed away the pungent smoke that rushed to fill his lungs. Had the old witch been serious, he thought, clearing the remaining smoke away with his hand. Will I really see my future? He stood up and faced the exit of the tent. Taking a deep breath and hoping that this wasn’t some gigantic joke, he stepped forward. As the dusty fabric slid over his face, he felt his eyelids droop, his head became heavy on his shoulders and his vision went dark.
Harry laughed nervously, hyper aware of the warm body against his side as they stepped apart and circled the shop together, Draco picking up a bag of Ice Mice for Parkinson and Harry, after much deliberation, deciding on a box of Every Flavour Beans.
filling Draco’s bookshelves sat titles such as ‘Charm Your Own Cheese’, ‘Enchantment in Baking’, and ‘One Minute Feasts – It’s Magic!’
Harry laughed, amazed by how easy it seemed between them.  But he supposed that, if what Hermione said was right, they’d been dancing around each other for a while now.
Harry sighed with relief as the last customers exited through the double doors. Ron locked the doors behind them and shot Harry a sympathetic grin. The evening had been manic with the entire staff run off their feet as the restaurant had filled up more and more until they were turning people away at the door.
Harry showed no resistance as Malfoy guided him upstairs by the hand, pulling him into the same bedroom as he had woken up in and through into the en suite he had no idea even existed. He raised his arms as Malfoy hurried to undress them both, trying and failing not to stare when Malfoy threw off pyjamas to reveal stunning, porcelain skin that Harry itched to touch. When Malfoy stepped under the hot mist of the shower and held a hand out invitingly, Harry’s willpower snapped. Who cared if this wasn’t his life? Shouldn’t he at least make the most of it while he was here? And hell, it could be his life if he wanted it.
