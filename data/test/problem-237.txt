"He's probably just a closet case," Blaise said and Pansy burst out laughing like it was the funniest thing ever.
Harry opened his eyes to see Draco sitting half in front of himself. "You alright?" Harry asked, wondering why he suddenly moved.
Just as Harry suspected, no one was in the room and they sat down on the nice couch right in front of the fire, Harry pulling out his transfiguration homework and Draco pulling out a book.
He let his fingers curl in Harry, pressing hard against Harry's prostate and let his thumb graze the spot between Harry's entrance and his groin.
"You're his little sister, he cares for you more than you know, and I don't think he cares much what gender you like anyway."
"McGonagall. She caught Malfoy and I arguing in the hall and got angry, we have to hang out now. I'll explain more at breakfast when Hermione is there."
"Looks like I got the short end of the stick then," Ron grumbled, "Hermione got Parkinson who she seems to get on with just fine, and you get the quiet one. I got the annoying one."
Draco snuck out of the dorm less than an hour later when Harry never returned. He was wandering down the hall when he slammed into what seemed like empty air.
"Do you have a crush on someone in the circle?" Neville felt the back of his neck heat up. He knew how playing games like this worked at Hogwarts: it would be impossible to lie, he only had a few moments to take a shot if he didn't want to answer before his answer would burst from his mouth without any control over it.
Pansy's lips tasted like firewhiskey and another undertone of something she couldn't place but had a feeling that it was her lip balm. Hermione felt herself leaning forward a bit, keeping her hands firmly in her lap. She was a bit drunk and she knew that she wasn't thinking completely rationally as she kissed Pansy, but it was nice and she'd never kissed a girl before.
"Well I did tell you it wouldn't." Harry turned slightly and pulled his legs up onto the bed, leaning back on his arm to look at Draco.
Goosebumps formed on the back of Harry's neck from the cold air. He was seated between Ron and Draco high up in the stands and the cold air set his teeth chattering. Harry tightened his scarf around himself to try and combat the cold air, but it didn't help much.
"So what is it?" Draco's eyes roamed over the paper, but as far as he could see it was just blank. He supposed there might be something on the inside, but when Harry opened it he was met with more blank paper.
Draco and Harry both stared in shock at Lucius, wondering how on earth he wasn't mad and trying to hex them both into the ground.
Draco reached his hand out to brush his fingers over Harry's comfortingly, "I'm sure it'll work out."
"Maybe you could rope the Gryffindor team into letting you practice with them one day," Hermione joked.
"We aren't friends, I don't need to talk to you every moment of the day." Harry felt his stomach drop a little at Draco's words.
"Nobody's going to hear us," Pansy laughed, "Anyway, we need a plan! Let me get the notebook!" Pansy jumped up and ran out of the room, leaving Blaise and Draco to laugh.
Draco's eyes seemed to be silver and his blonde hair was glowing in the light. Harry could feel himself leaning in before he could take a moment to think.
"Stop just-" Draco groaned and then Harry's mouth was suddenly on him. "Oh god-" Draco moaned, throwing his head back down on the pillow, his fingers twisting into the sheets.
Blaise stared down at him, momentarily shocked that he even worked up the courage to kiss him. "I'm sure you didn't ruin everything," Blaise said, "It's Potter, he'd forgive the Dark Lord if he apologized nicely enough." Draco laughed a bit, a choking sort of laugh, like he couldn't quite get enough air. "And you're not an idiot for showing him how you feel."
"Yes! Hermione you're great!" Ron said grabbing her around the waist and pulling her towards him and placing a kiss on her cheek. Harry watched Hermione try and hide a slight smile, they really are great for each other.
The conversation eventually shifted from Harry though and quickly turned to the food that littered the table and the decorations that never failed to impress.
"Yeah, here," Harry said, handing him a blank piece of parchment that he'd dug out of his robe's pocket.
They both burst through the door to the greenhouse, out of breath and hair a mess. Everyone stared in shock at their messy, flushed, state as they both hurried to sit down, trying to ignore the looks. Harry could only imagine what everyone was thinking.
"You ready?" Harry asked Draco, leaning over to him to whisper in his ear as they were packing their bags up to leave class. Despite Draco's nervousness, Harry's breath grazing his ear and neck didn't fail to make his skin prickle and send a shiver down his spine.
"Yeah, we have the line up ready, I just forgot to put it up I guess (So did the author lol)," Harry laughed.
"Or a perfect way to get drunk and play party games," said Dean smile over at Seamus who sent him a conspiratorial smile back.
"Yeah, sure," Harry readily agreed. "Let me just put my bag down upstairs and we can head down to the pitch."
Draco casted a tempus charm and, realizing it had been a little over an hour, started gathering his things.
"You wouldn't have said that last year," Draco mumbled, dropping Harry's gaze and looking down at his hands.
Secondly, does this mean Draco is gay? And he likes me? The thought was so puzzling to him, he hadn't seen any signs of it.
"I feel bad for whoever caught his fancy, he's a nightmare. I can only imagine what Harry has to put up with."
"Do I make myself clear?" McGonagall repeated firmly, making it clear that there was no arguing and that they would be forever doomed with the task of hanging out.
"No, I didn't mean to be rude. I just- IthinkImightbegay," Harry scrambled to get the words out and they all jumbled together.
"Today is a full moon, the first since the whole potions thing. So it's kinda like an anniv-" Ron was cut off as Hermione elbowed him in the side with a glare. "What? I'm just trying to make light of the situation."
Firstly, how could he just kiss him so easily? Maybe it was different in the wizarding world, but if you did that in the muggle world and you weren't 100% sure the other person was gay you were at least guaranteed a punch in the face, and that was probably getting off easy.
"So if you add that, it will increase its potency," Draco looked up to find Harry staring dumbly at him, "were you even listening?"
"Doesn't need to know. We can keep it a secret and we can always blame it on our punishment if we're caught," Harry said, and a bit of a mischievous look came about his features.
The bickering was back quickly enough though as the first goal was made and Hermione let out a long suffering sigh.
Draco's lips were slightly parted and he could feel his breath against his neck. Harry reached forward, making sure not to disrupt Draco, and closed his book, marking it with a piece of parchment. He turned back to Draco and contemplated for a moment before placing his arm gently around Draco.
The bathroom door opened then and a soft light filled the room and Draco's eyes shot closed. Draco could hear the soft sound of Harry's steps as he crossed the room.
"Alright, well I trust your judgement. I can't stop you from dating who you want, but I just don't want you hurt," Molly said and everyone else readily agreed.
"You want to go on a date with me?" Draco finally said, eyes drifting down to the box of Alihotsy leaves he held in his hands.
Before he could say anything, though, Draco interrupted him, "Before you say anything. Harry is my boyfriend and I like him and I'm not breaking up with him, no matter what you say." Draco's voice sounded sure of himself, but Harry knew otherwise as he felt Draco's hand tremble in his own.
Harry had gotten better at chess since first year and could now actually have a game with Ron that lasted more than ten minutes, Ron still won every time though.
Ron stared off at the fire for a moment and then let out a long sigh. "If he likes him I don't mind. He's been through a lot - we all have - and he deserves to be happy. I'm just worried, you know? Malfoy has always been terrible to all of us, especially Harry. I don't know if I entirely trust him yet. I know that he isn't entirely to blame for what all he did during the war, but don't you think Harry's being a bit too forgiving?"
"Wait," Ron said holding up his hands and looking at the pair, who at this time had managed to grab the attention of most of the Gryffindor table and a few students from other tables, "you're dating?!"
He usually sat with Draco for this class - ancient runes - but they were supposed to be working in groups of three today so they'd separated to work with their own friend groups. Harry wasn't really working today though, but Hermione didn't seem to mind. She probably thought he had a headache again, Harry figured. She wouldn't be far off, though, his head was starting to ache again. He figured it was because he wasn't used to seeing so many colors.
Harry was about to say hey when he took in Draco and his breath caught in his throat. He was absolutely stunning.
Draco woke up again that night to find Harry shouting unintelligible things in his sleep. He didn't waste a moment getting up and shaking him awake.
"I'll go," Luna spoke up and spun the bottle. The group watched as the bottle spun 'round and 'round and the game had officially begun. The bottle slowed to a stop in front of Harry. "Truth or Dare, Harry."
On Wednesday Harry came rushing through the doors of Draco and his shared dorm. Draco watched in mild amusement as he took in Harry's slightly disheveled form. Before Draco could even get a word out though, Harry said, "Okay, I've got the plan."
"We'll figure it out, I'm sure. For the meantime, we can keep trying to think of what the colors mean, it could be something interesting," Hermione said.
Draco turned away with a heavy blush as he realized what that meant: he was glowing red and probably very brightly at that. Harry knew he was in love with him. Well, he knew that Harry was aware he liked him at the very least, but now he knew that those feelings went well beyond a simple crush. Draco wanted to disappear.
"We better go to Honeydukes before the third years take all the good stuff," Blaise said as he led Neville towards the brightly colored shop.
"There's nothing to help with, Pansy," Draco sighed, gathering his books as well, "I've already told you to let it be."
"A few yes, but nothing giant and no one knew it was me. I just got fed up with some of the people in my house sometimes," Draco responded.
Blaise and Neville had planned to meet on Sunday to work on the herbology project Neville was doing, but it was awkward to say the least.
Draco woke up the next day by the sun glaring through the window. His head was pounding and he was immensely thankful that it was Sunday and not a school day.
The walk back to the dormitories was silent as neither of the two boys knew what to say. In all their years of being at Hogwarts, never had they imagined that they'd ever be walking to their own shared dormitory. The idea was something that wouldn't have ever even crossed their mind.
After a longer conversation than he'd been expecting, he made his way back up to the eighth-year dorms loaded down with food.
Morning came too fast and with it brought headaches to all who attended the party the night before. Pansy gave her special concoction that got rid of hangovers to Draco, Blaise, and Hermione. Dean and Seamus seemed to have something that got rid of hangovers too as neither seemed to be affected by the copious amounts of alcohol they drank the night before.
Blase was blissfully aware of the implications of Pansy's teasing though, and simply joined in the fun.
Hermione heard the moment the shouting started, along with everyone else in the eighth-year common room. She knew from experience that when they started yelling, it never ended well.
The room was silent, the only sound being Lucius flipping through the pages of the daily profit. Narcissa kept her eyes on her own plate as she ate her own food slowly.
"Save it, I already got a lecture from Draco. I know," Pansy said, deflated. She got up then to grab a hangover potion for Blaise.
"It is, but that doesn't change my duty as the oldest, and only, son. As the one carrying on the family name, I need to marry well and produce an heir. My parents don't really care what I do after as long as I'm only with people of a similar status. Though, it doesn't much matter now. My family has the same status level as the Weasley's now."
"I'll go next," Harry said towards the end of the night. It was the last round and Harry had already kissed Luna, Pansy, Seamus and Lavender. The last one was something he never wanted to do again.
The seconds seemed to drag on as they stared at each other. Harry didn't know who was the first to lean in then, but Draco's lips were suddenly pressed against his and he had no complaints.
"I thought the day would never come," Pansy said, sitting down next to Draco on the bed. He looked at her, completely confused now. "Oh come on, you can't possibly believe that I would willingly follow that mad man?"
"I've got to admit, this was pretty fun," Draco said, sitting up a bit to look at Harry, a rare smile gracing his features.
"Well the muggle world is pretty different Hermione, I mean, you know that of course. You're family is really open minded," Ron said, then turned to look at Harry, "the only people who care about that stuff here are the crazy purebloods trying to carry on their bloodline."
“If you two spend the rest of the day sending glances at each other as you have for the past two weeks, I’m going to tear my hair out,” Ron grumbled, watching the red bloom over Harry’s cheeks.
"What have I been excited for?" Dean said, coming out of the group of people too and snaking his arm around Seamus' shoulders.
They both heard steps then and Harry quickly grabbed Draco's hand and pulled him under the cloak. Just in time too, as Filch came around the corner just then, muttering about hearing naughty kids up and about.
Not to mention, Potter is also a terrible roommate. He snores and is extremely self-involved and hogs the bathroom in the morning. He is a nightmare and I sincerely wish I had not come another year. I am certain I would have learned much more had I studied at home.
"I don't care who you like, long as they don't hurt you," Ron sent Luna a look then, "Don't go hurting my little sister."
"Ah... wait- Draco, ah! Stop! I'm gonna..." he panted, trying to remove Draco from him, but Draco reached around, grabbing his hips to make it impossible for him to get away. "Draco- AH!" Draco felt Harry's whole body shudder as he came in his mouth.
Ron let out a relieved sigh and Ginny gave him a funny look, "Oh thank god. You had me worried for a moment, I thought you were going to tell me something horrible. You didn't really think I would care did you?"
"Want to head down to the dining hall for dinner?" Draco asked, when Harry looked over it seemed like he actually had a lot more done of the project than him. He felt a little jealous.
"It doesn't need to be some grand thing and we don't have to tell anyone, but I'd like to go on an actual date with you."
"I still can't believe that we hang out with them now," Ron said, shaking his head in disbelief, "Especially you and Malfoy."
Draco studied him for a second. It definitely wasn't a date, but it might be a chance at being friends again. "Sure, I'd love to. Let me put away my books though," he said, quickly rounding up his things and rushing up the stairs to his room. He almost tripped on one of the steps in his rush and felt his cheeks flush as he heard Harry laugh from below.
"You know where the kitchens are? I swear- every time I talk to you I find out another thing you apparently know about the castle," Draco said with a shake of his head.
Ron turned to look at Harry, who was staring at Draco not-so-discreetly and then he turned to Hermione who was still red in the face. Luna and Ginny were still kissing and Ron tried not to look, it was weird seeing your little sister kiss someone, no matter the gender.
"Well what are you doing then? I find it hard to believe that you find much more than a snogging partner in me," Draco knew it was just his insecurities talking, but couldn't stop himself. He was scared, and when he was scared he ran so he was going to try his best to end this as soon as possible.
Harry looked up at Draco with sad eyes and Draco leaned in, pressing a soft kiss to Harry's lips. "You have to forgive yourself," Draco said, the words ghosting over Harry's lips.
They all made their way out to the field after breakfast, Harry feeling slightly better but cursing the fact that he'd have to sit on a broom soon. It didn't help that Draco kept glancing over at Harry with concern in his eyes everytime he limped a bit.
"What about our food?" Harry managed, voice rough and breathless. Draco was slowly driving him crazy with his mouth and fingers and he'd honestly sooner starve than stop to eat now, but he felt he should probably mention it. He knew Draco was still slightly nervous about getting intimate and hoped that mentioning the food would let him have an out if he wanted it.
Looking down, he realized why: Draco was laying across his arm. Harry hadn't realized he'd fallen asleep in Draco's bed last night. Instead of trying to turn over, Harry just mushed his face into the back of Draco's neck, letting out a contented sigh as he caught the scent of Draco's shampoo. Harry slipped an arm around Draco's waist, pulling him closer to himself and Draco started to stir.
Harry stared down at the potion that was slightly murky. It was clear when they'd left it to mature just 28 days ago, Harry thought, he figured it had to be fine though. After all, Draco had helped brew it, and him and Hermione were top of the class. With a shrug Harry dipped the stirring stick into the potion, spinning it clockwise. The stick was halfway around the cauldron when the potion bubbled up and promptly exploded in Harry's face, soaking their entire work-area with the potion. The last thing he remembered was seeing Draco's shocked face before he blacked out.
Harry turned as he heard his name and was greeted with Ginny running up behind him, slightly out of breath.
"Look who's stealing questions now," Draco smirked over at Harry who had moved to lean against the headboard. Draco wanted to tell him to go back to his own bed but he couldn't bring himself to for some reason; there was just something about the way Harry looked in his bed. "I think I want to do something with potions. McGonagall actually offered me a position here after school as the potions teacher. Professor Slughorn is going to retire soon and someone needs to fill the spot."
Harry looked over at Ron, he figured he'd have to tell them eventually. He might as well do it now and get it over with he supposed. He sucked in a breath, "I'm dating Draco, Draco Malfoy."
"I don't have a date," Draco said, "And how did you even hear about it. Blaise only just found out."
--------------FROM HERE ON DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ SMUT, JUST GO TO THE NEXT CHAPTER---------------
“Sometimes I still cannot believe that you like Malfoy,” Ron said, staring at Harry as he tried to settle his hair in the mirror. Harry shot him a look. “What? A year ago he was your sworn enemy, even with Voldemort running around. It’s seriously a turn of events that you’re about to take him out on a date.”
"I got us into this?! I wasn't the one who slammed into the other, and then started a fight over it," Harry replied, shooting Draco a glare. They both stepped through the portrait hole and before they could continue their argument, they were met with Ron looking slightly anxious.
"Well yeah, I mean you were always sneaking off to hang out with him. Not to mention how late you two would stay out..." Hermione replied.
"I'm eating before setting this up next time," Draco groaned, flopping down and grabbing food from the mound Harry had brought from the kitchens. "It's practically lunch by now."
"Ugh!" Harry groaned and flopped onto the bed, Draco tried to ignore how the sound made him feel. "I'm not asking you to go dying for me, I just mean being friends."
Harry followed Draco mindlessly to their usual spot at the top of the astronomy tower. "I figured you could use some fresh air."
"Hey," Harry replied dumbly, mostly because he was a bit surprised to see him at the Gryffindor, but also a bit due to the fact that his hair was falling loosely around his face in a way that made him look a bit nicer than Harry would care to admit.
The Great Hall was noisy with talk of the Quidditch game, people already taking bets on who will win. Harry could feel the excitement in the air and saw some nervous kids who were playing their first game today. He remembered not being able to eat before his first match and allowed himself to get swept up in the excitement of the game.
"Firstly, you mean when Slytherin wins against Gryffindor. Secondly, I'll help you get the stuff back only cause I'm bored and promised you I would help."
By the time Draco got out of the shower, Harry was on his last sentence of the essay and felt quite proud of himself.
Harry watched Draco pin up the last blanket to the wall with a sticking charm. Draco had insisted they put the fort together without magic - except for the sticking charms - because "it's more fun that way." Harry enjoyed it, he'd never really made a fort before and was excited that he was making one with Draco. If there was anyone he wanted to make one with, it'd be Draco.
"Alright, gather 'round! We've got games to play and alcohol to drink," Hermione heard Pansy's voice travel over to her from across the room and she went to sit down next to Ron.
“You didn’t hear?” Hemione asked and when she got blank stares in response she continued, “Harry and Malfoy went on a date to Hogwarts today-”
"Yeah, I'm sure it will, but it's a pain in the meantime," Harry said and Ron and Hermione laughed a bit.
"It'll grow out, but whatever spell Seamus used was a strong one," Hermione imputed, "Even McGonagall couldn't get it completely out."
School had just ended for the day when McGonagall stopped him in the hall to tell him to go see Pomfrey.
"That's what happens when you try to disappear for a couple months," Harry sighed, propping his head up with his hand, "sorry that you didn't really get to say goodbye to your parents, Ron."
"I don't now, and I won't then. Just leave me the fuck alone, I'm sick of being a puppet," Draco said, turning to leave, "When my father hears, tell him I don't care about his little project either and he'll have to figure it out himself." With that Draco swept out of the classroom leaving a fuming Snape alone.
"You don't sound very straight when you're complaining about 'Potter this, Potter that'," Blaise said with a laugh.
"You two sure took your time," Hermione said as Ron slid in next to her and Harry sat down across from them- in perfect view of the Slytherin table no less, but Harry would never admit that.
Draco stood there a moment after the door closed before turning to the steaming bath. It was the perfect temperature.
Hermione handed Ron a chocolate frog and Harry decided it might be a good time to leave and look for Draco, as well as allow Ron and Hermione a moment alone.
“It’s alright,” Draco rubbed his hand down from the top of his shoulder - where it was currently resting - to his upper arm, “Let’s take a break for tonight anyway. It’s getting late and my feet are sore.”
"Oh I'm not worried about people knowing about my addiction, that's common knowledge. The stash isn't though."
"He shouldn't go around just asking random girls. That could seriously hurt one of them," Hermione berated.
Draco raised a brow, making his voice as serious as possible before saying, "I don't know, that sounds pretty dirty, Harry," and then burst out laughing.
Harry glared back at the two and Hermione sent them a questioning glance, "I'll be fine. Just sore."
On the other end of the table Harry and Draco were arguing over their Tentacula and how they were going to go about getting leaves from it.
Somewhere in the back of his mind told him this was important, that something wasn't right with this information. His head was spinning though and he felt sluggish and tired.
Harry turned red realizing he had been so obvious about it, "It's just- You're really good looking," Harry said, turning his head from Draco.
"There is no point to this, it just won't settle," Draco flopped down onto Harry's bed next to him. Harry stared down at him as he put his arm dramatically over his face.
Harry made his way up the stairs to the eighth year dorms after classes to find Draco waiting for him on the couch.
"Okay, you get the ones on the furniture by the fire and I'll grab all the others," Draco said, already moving over to a chair, "Grab the cushions while you're at it too."
The walk to Hogsmeade was quieter than usual and when they reached the Three Broomsticks for lunch it was boarding on awkward.
"I don't see why not, I mean it's a fun thing for the eighth years to do and it would give the house teams more practice," Hermione replied.
"Fine, let's go then," Ron said, turning around and walking away, Hermione shooting Harry a sympathetic look and trailing after him.
Okay but like I really like this chapter, but it was also so hard to write as I'm not great at writing dialogue. But here it is, the longest chapter yet!
"Ah, yeah sorry I went to Madam Pomfrey to tell her about the color meanings. I wanted to hurry to not be late to this class, but I suppose it didn't matter much anyway," Harry said, looking towards where Hagrid was trying and failing to get students to pay attention.
Harry slowly made it down to the great hall after showering. A few eighth years were nursing hangovers around the great hall and McGonagall looked mildly angry at the staff table.
Barely anyone looked up at them as they came down the stairs, at this point seeing them together wasn't really a novel thing. They were practically always together. The few who did look up though watched as Draco and Harry laughed like old friends the whole way to the door
After a few trips back up the stairs to drop off the pillows and cushions, they were finally grabbing the last ones.
"Relax, I've got this," Harry said, pulling out the Marauder's map he had stuffed in his pocket before he'd gone to dinner.
"You're going to give yourself a heart attack with all that sugar," Draco mused, following behind Harry towards the register as he picked up a couple things for himself.
"I can only imagine how shocked she was," Harry laughed, sinking to his knees, his body shaking with laughter.
Draco had snuck off to Blaise's dorm room early in the morning because he was so nervous over the date that he didn't want to see Harry yet.
When he got there he realized it didn't matter much as Hagrid seemed to be having trouble keeping everyone's attention anyway over the chatter about the ball and Quidditch game.
"Great! I'll go get Ron," with that Hermione was bounding out the door to get Ron who was still in the common room.
"And what were we planning on doing?" Draco shot back sarcastically, hoping that maybe if he acted normal, even if Potter heard something he'd let it go.
"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good," Harry said, tapping his wand on the parchment, watching as ink spread across the page.
"Oh good morning Harry!" Molly said, taking in Harry's form at the window, "Mind waking Ron up for me? I just finished preparing lunch."
"Much more of that and you'll be unable to stand in an hour," Blaise commented, nudging her in the side.
"Welcome to all those who are new, and welcome back to those who are returning students. I would like to start off by making it clear that the Forbidden Forest is off limits to all, and make sure to check Filch's new list of banned items.
"No, it's okay. I broke up with her originally before I left to go hunting for horcruxes but when I got back I just never tried to get back together with her. I feel kind of bad for not even talking to her about though." Harry watched Draco's face as he talked and loved the way he looked so focused on his words, he really liked this side of Draco.
"Ughhhh!" Pansy groaned, flopping back down on the blanket dramatically and continuing to pick at the grass. "Why won't you let me help you?"
"He started the whole thing! Why should I be punished too!" Harry shouted, finally voicing his own complaints.
"Some example questions would be, 'What are the odds you'll kiss Neville' or 'What are the odds you'll chug a bottle of firewhiskey.'
Harry brushed off Draco's comment, "Doesn't matter, you still need to get up or we won't be on time." With that, Harry pulled away from Draco and watched in amusement and Draco stretched out his arms trying to pull Harry back. "I'm going to get dressed, you need to get up," Harry laughed.
"That isn't the point. Being around someone often causes people to become closer, and feelings to start."
“It doesn’t hurt to dress up once in a while though,” Pansy said, “I actually picked you up something to wear too.”
“Nah, that one I could see,” Ron said and Harry turned to gape at him, “What? You two are always together and hanging all over each other. Like you’re a pair of magnets.”
People were starting to get nervous too as it was never pretty when Harry and Draco were fighting. The situation was likely to blow up soon and people were getting wary.
"I just had a feeling that something was happening and had to be here for it," Pansy said, appraising Draco, "and it seems I was right. You're wearing those black muggle pants. You'd only wear those for Potter and we both know it."
"Woah," Harry said, surprised. He pointed at a guy and girl kissing at a booth in the corner across the room, "They both started glowing really brightly."
"I'm with Zacharias Smith, who is still kinda a dick but he's okay I suppose, and Seamus got the only decent option: Ernie MacMillian," Dean said, leaning in to join the conversation.
"Of course," Blaise smiled back, "how about The Three Broomsticks next? I could go for a butter beer."
"I'm not off making out with him! We're being punished!" Draco protested indignantly from where he was sitting in Blaise's desk chair.
Harry woke up fine, better than fine actually. He woke up in Draco's bed, curled up against him and feeling well rested and happy. When he tried to stand though, he had to grab the side of the bed to keep him up-right. It was like his legs had turned to jelly and he was aching all over.
He turned around and was immediately engulfed in Draco's scent, either this person was soaked in Amortentia or it was Draco, and Harry was pretty sure no one had drenched themselves in it. So that leaves-
"What are you thinking about?" Draco asked after a moment of comfortable silence and then suddenly wished he hadn't.
The rumors found their way to the library though and Draco found himself on the receiving end of multiple glares as he tried to work on his homework. Harry wasn't blind to the looks either and was growing more agitated and angry by the minute. After almost 45 minutes of silently stewing, Harry decided to get up to get a new book for his essay.
Harry suddenly reached across the table and grabbed onto Draco's hands, stopping them from continuing to worry the table. Draco startled a bit, but didn't make a move to pull away. "It's not your fault, you didn't have a choice."
"I- I wanted to talk," Harry said, glancing around at the people who were looking at them curiously as they walked by. Ginny seemed to get the message.
"Lunch doesn't start for another hour. Go get the blankets and leave the food to me," Harry laughed, already slipping his shoes on to sneak down to the kitchens. Draco watched him go, wondering where on earth he was headed to.
Draco opened his eyes when he heard the bathroom door close and stared off at the wall in front of him. It was pretty bare, especially compared to Harry's side of the room that had posters and Gryffindor stuff all over the walls. Draco had pretended to be mad about them when they first moved into the room together, but he didn't mind, he rather liked them actually. The posters and things were just so Harry.
Pansy laughed as she shrugged off her top and dropped it next to herself, "You're a prude." She picked up the bottle then and spun it. Harry watched as Draco's expression turned into one of nervousness as the bottle spun, because Pansy was the one with the bottle it meant that they were probably about to be targeted if it landed on them. It landed on Blaise though, and both boys let out a quiet sigh of relief.
When Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville made it back up to the common room they were met with a group of people around the bulletin board.
"Yeah, Seamus learned that the hard way earlier. Tried to put his stuff down in a room with Seamus and it flew at him, barely missed his head. He's rooming with Ernie Macmillan now and Dean got stuck with Zacharias Smith," Ron made a face, "Dean really got bad luck."
As soon as things were cleaned up, Harry and Draco practically raced up the stairs, taking two at a time.
Draco stared at him for a moment and then sighed, "Fine, I'll come. But if I don't like it, I'm never going again."
"Oh whatever. Draco, do you mind if we come up here for a bit? We wanted to discuss the Quidditch teams for the eighth years, you might actually be interested." Draco stiffened at the use of his first name, but let it go. Granger really wasn't that bad, and he knew she was only trying to be friendly.
Hermione stared at him a moment longer before saying, "so like we're all different colors or something?"
Every suit of armor in a 500 meter radius of filch's office was set to start making noise and running around the halls, and to promptly fall apart when Filch got close. Succeeding in not only allowing a big enough distraction to get inside the office, but also causing a huge mess for Filch to clean up.
"I was just at Hogsmeade," Harry said casually. He barely cared about Hermione's concern at the moment, though, he was too busy feeling like he was floating. It had to have been the best day of his life and he could never remember enjoying a date like this before.
Molly looked disbelievingly at them. "He's been really nice to Luna too," Ginny spoke up, "They're friends."
"Ah, Mr. Longbottom," McGonagall said as she looked up from her papers, "and Mr. Zabini, what do I owe the pleasure?"
"Nothings wrong, I just-" Harry paused a moment gathering his courage, "I wanted to ask you if you'd be my boyfriend? I know you wanted to date for a bit first, but it's been over two weeks now and we've gone on several..." Harry trailed off, realizing he was starting to ramble.
"You ever wonder if one of the bats ever attacked a student?" Hermione wondered aloud as she took a bite of her dinner. "I mean, letting live bats just fly around the great hall can't be very safe can it?"
Harry was just reaching down to unbutton Draco's pants when Draco reached up to stop him. "Not yet," he breathed, "Sorry..." Draco turned his head to avoid Harry's eyes.
After the war had ended, Harry had become a bit of a recluse. He stayed at the Weasly's house for the summer because while he technically had a house, he just felt that Grimmauld Place was a bit too cold and empty and much preferred the warmness of the Weasley's house. Because of his stay at their house for the summer, it meant he didn't have to go out much. This meant that the papers where going nuts trying to get interviews with him, crazy rumors started, mail from all over was showing up at the house, and when people got wind that Harry Potter was returning to Hogwarts the media had a field day. For this very reason, Harry didn't want to go back.
"And that's how far I've gotten with it, you?" Draco finished and Harry realized he had been talking.
"My parents have been oddly more attentive too," Draco said, looking down at his food as he pushed it around. It was odd now that he was thinking about it. They'd written him more this year than they had all the others combined. It was nice, but it was still a bit odd.
"Please? We went to the Slytherin ones," Harry begged, "It will be a quick way to pass the time! Plus, we went to the Slytherin ones."
"I can't believe I'm stuck with Potter of all people. I knew I shouldn't of come back for another year," Draco said, bringing up the room arrangements for the first time since they had walked into the library after class. "And on top of that, McGonagall made us hang out for at least an hour a day to promote inter-house unity or something like that. I mean, I just can't believe that no one would room with him!"
"If you guys are fighting again I'll have to tell Hermione. You don't need to be in any more trouble with McGonagall, Harry," Ron said after a moment's pause, "I came to make sure you were up. Practice is in less than an hour you know, and you still haven't eaten lunch."
"There's so much," Draco said as he came to look down at the drawer. "We don't have time to look though, Filch could be back any time."
"I do know you, and you wouldn't and we both know it," Harry said and Draco finally looked up at Harry and met his eyes. They stared at each other for a moment and then they both turned away quickly.
"I didn't mean it like that. You're like a brother to me, it'd just be weird," Draco shuddered at the idea of kissing Blaise, that was something he hoped to never have to do, "and you're..." Draco gestured to Pansy, "Gay as shit, there'd be no point."
"I get nightmares too," Draco mumbled after a minute of silence, "Sometimes- sometimes it helps me to write them down or talk about them. I'm here if you need to talk."
"Yeah, it seems like it still follows us around though, huh?" Draco looked up and met Harry's eyes and Harry watched him glow just a tad bit brighter.
"Here, stay here, I'll be right back," Draco said with a tone that was surprisingly gentle. Harry watched as Draco went to the bathroom and he heard the faucet turn on. Draco came back a moment with a damp towel. "May I?" Draco held the towel out towards him.
Harry felt surprised for a moment before realizing the way he acted must have been pretty horrible and then he felt ashamed. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to- I was just shocked I guess."
When he returned to his room he pulled out the nice pair of deep-blue jeans and a white shirt. He pulled on a zip-up hoodie over the shirt.
"Today we will be brewing a potion called . Does anyone know what it does?" Slughorn asked. He was standing at the front looking around at everyone. Harry often felt like he was in a glass jar around him, like some sort of attraction.
Harry had no response. Zero. Because of all the people he had expected to guess that they liked each other, Ron was the last on the list.
"Draco, we're not going to break you up," Narcissa said, reaching out and placing her hand over his on the table.
"Ha. ha," Harry said, "place your wand tip on the paper and say 'I solemnly swear I'm up to no good'."
There were some nervous glances around the circle, but no outright objections and Pansy handed the bottle to Ginny. "You go first this time," Pansy said.
"First year, remember?" When Ron still looked clueless, she lowered her voice and leaned towards him, "When we smuggled Norbert for Hagrid."
"How about we just stay here today instead," Draco said, placing his arms behind his head and closing his eyes, "I don't want to walk all the way there anyway."
"Eventually, but you have not let me sleep since you got up!" Harry groaned and pulled his covers up over his head.
Harry laughed at that and then laughed even harder when he caught sight of Draco's completely disgusted face, "Don't worry, we're not going there. I hate it too," he got out around his laughter and Draco felt relieved.
"Oh not much, they just wanted to say good game and I said their team would do fine against Hufflepuff."
“That settles it, you’re meeting me to practice your dancing, I’m not going to be seen with you if you can’t even dance.”
"Of course it's be your house color," Harry rolled his eyes and let out a laugh, Draco didn't bother to correct him.
"Mmm" is Harry's only reply as he leans forward and grabs Draco's shoulders, pulling him into another heated kiss that Draco smiled into. Harry's head felt fuzzy and all he wanted was to be kissing Draco.
When they arrived in the Three Broomsticks, it was quite packed and they barely got a table. They settled down into a small booth in the back corner, it was a bit cramped and their knees brushed against each other under the table.
"We're not up to anything. Just leave it be, you always just stick your nose in my business and it's getting on my nerves."
"Potter," Draco ground out and then prayed that the coin would land on tails. He let out a breath he didn't know he'd been holding when the coin did land on tails. He'd never been so thankful of something in his whole life.
"Well, no," Draco said, shifting uncomfortably in his seat, "I mean, I really thought you hated me now. I was surprised when you invited me here."
His brain started working again right before it was too late and he leaned back, giving a small cough to clear his throat, "We should probably head back. I imagine the party is almost over by now."
"You figured something out didn't you," Harry said as him and Pomfrey made it to the infirmary to find Snape and McGonagall already there.
4. I started this story while I was living in Ecuador. I went on a volunteer trip there for 6 weeks last summer and lived with a host family and my partner in country. It was a lot of fun, but I also had a ton of down time so one day I decided to start writing. Since then I’ve gone back and edited it, so it’s not at all like it originally was. If you want to check it out, it's on the last chapter of "Draw The Line" on Wattpad. My username is katt_alexx on there. If enough people ask for it, I'll post it here too.
"Looks like we got an audience. Come on, let's go say hi." They both left the money for their drinks on the table and headed across the room to where Draco and Harry were sitting, looking guilty.
His eyes made their way past Ron and Hermione to where Draco was sitting at his table across the hall, both face and red haze glowing brightly.
He pointedly focused all his attention on the lesson and began furiously writing notes, earning a questioning look from Pansy that he chose to ignore as well.
Draco turned red and looked down at the table and Harry was about to continue when the waitress showed up with their drinks and Harry quickly retracted his hand.
"Didn't we cover this plant in sixth year?" Draco complained, trying to cast a severing charm and having his wand knocked out of his hand.
"Alright," Draco said, using his wand to cast the spell for lube. One of the most useful spells out there, Draco mused.
"Well that went a lot better than I was expecting it to," Hermione slid into the seat across from Harry that Draco had just exited.
Draco nodded his head numbly, he wasn't really used to being taken care of by anyone other than his mother.
The thing that made them part was actually both of them reaching for each other at the exact same time. Their hands both came to each other's face and that was when they both snapped out of their trance and pulled away, albeit reluctantly.
"Not particularly, but we could go check out the store to kill time." Draco readily agreed and they went into a store a few shops down that had a bunch of Quidditch gear in their window.
Harry leaned in towards Draco's ear, "Wish we weren't in the middle of the great hall, or I'd kiss you."
The second of October was the day the eighth years planned to have their second party and they were all gathered in the common room after dinner. A couple new people had shown up and a couple that came last time didn't come this time. Hermione was silently fuming at Dean and Seamus as they'd brought alcohol against her wishes, especially because Luna and Ginny were both there.
"Sure, I was just going to walk these up to professor McGonagall's office, you're welcome to come with and then after we can go check on your bubotuber," Neville gestured to the vials of Wolfsbane in his hands. Neville had started working with Professor Sprout to grow and collect potions ingredients - especially wolfsbane - that they would then donate to St. Mungos. After the war, the supply of potion ingredients ran thin and with the growth of the werewolf population, wolfsbane was in extremely high demand.
"I solemnly swear that I'm up to no good," Harry said and watched as black ink slowly formed the grounds of Hogwarts.
"Thanks, now all we need is the bottle," Pansy said and then took notice of the bottle still in her hand, "Let's all finish this one off, games are always more fun when you're not completely sober." Pansy took a gulp of the liquid and passed it to Seamus who was seated to her left. Seamus gave her an approving look and took a gulp of the burning liquid and passed it to Dean.
"You know, I think kissing you would be more fun and Ron can always get new stuff," Harry said, eyes remaining closed in a silent plea.
"Medicine. Muggle medicine. Dean and Seamus forgot to make more hangover potion and I'm trash at making them. Anyway, it'll help with your headache, you swallow it."
"I think Harry likes Malfoy, even if he hasn't actually admitted it to himself yet," Neville sat the watering can down, "Anyway, that should help your plant. Make sure to water it at least once a week, and it should be fine, I don't think you've really done anything else wrong."
"His friends are going on a date and he didn't want to bother them," Draco said, running his hands through his hair.
"What are you looking at?" Harry said and turned around to see what Draco was looking at. Harry gasped when he saw Blaise and Neville and whipped his head back around to look at Draco. "What are they doing?"
"Yeah, I visited Draco," Harry whispered back, "His parents know about us now." Ginny shot him a look that was equal parts shocked and interested. "I'll tell you about it later."
"I haven't really seen any different shades, it's mostly just the brightness of the color that changes, like someone dimming or brightening a light. And even then, pink and red are the only colors that ever glow brighter."
"Alright then Hermione, let's give the people what they want," Pansy announced as she pranced on over to Hermione who was slowly getting redder by the moment. Ron, who sat next to her, looked aghast.
Draco's eyes were squeezed shut again, trying to block out the sun and Harry quickly noticed. Harry got up then and closed the curtains on the four-poster, leaving a slight gap on one side where he was sitting originally.
Charlie, Bill, and Fleur arrived this morning and Fleur has been in the Kitchen helping Ron's mom cook ever since.
"Three sickles," the employee said and Draco handed over the money. Harry dropped his pile of treats onto the counter when Draco was handed his item.
"Hurry up, or he'll wake," Dean whispered in Seamus' ear when they opened the door and Seamus slipped in. It was almost one in the morning and the room was pitch dark except for the small amount of light streaming through the window. Seamus turned to look back at the group that was hovering by the door and Dean gave him a thumbs up. Seamus turned back around to look at Goyle who was fast asleep and unsuspecting in bed.
Harry didn't seem to be planning on waiting for an answer though, and was standing up and hurrying out of the room as fast as possible.
"Oh gee a muggle game. You made me stop reading for a muggle game. What makes you think I'd want to play that."
Harry sighed again, "You are extremely difficult you know. I just thought it'd be a good way for us to actually get to know each other better, with the truce and all."
"I missed you too," Draco said, leaning forward and pulling Harry into a kiss. Harry returned the kiss, it quickly turning heated as Draco started walking backwards until his back pressed up against the gate.
"I think I might like guys. I mean I don't think I really liked Ginny like you know and that got me thinking and I'm not sure if I ever really liked girls. So I was thinking about that over the summer and I started realizing that I paid much more attention to guys than I ever did to girls and-"
"So is anyone going to tell me what it is that was so important that required both Pansy and Blaise to sit here as well. You know, like before desert ends?" Ron questioned after no one had talked for about twenty minutes. Pansy let out a scoff at that and looked down at her food. "Something funny Pansy" Ron shot back at her, accompanying it with a glare.
The rest of the date passed pretty uneventfully, they got lunch and Harry paid for them both and then they walked around Hogsmeade for a while.
Harry didn't reply, just shook his head in understanding. A moment passed in silence as Draco kept his eyes squarely on the mandrakes. "Sorry, that kind of ruined the moment didn't it?" Draco laughed awkwardly, "It's not all bad though, Blaise and Longbottom are making wolfsbane potion to give out to the people who were bitten during the war and I get to provide them with more wolfsbane for them to use. People wouldn't take the potion with my name attached to it, but Blaise stayed mostly neutral and of course Longbottom was well known for being against the Dark Lord, so people would actually take it coming from them."
Harry looked over to where Lucius was sitting, calmly looking at the paper and then over to where Narcissa was stabbing at her eggs. He looked back down at his own, figuring it might be better to keep his eyes on his food. Is this how meals are normally at their house? Harry wondered absently, I've heard of families eating their meals quietly, but I've never actually witnessed it. He decided it was quite awkward and wouldn't do it again if he could avoid it. Well it could just be because I'm here.
"And that's why you're going to be fat when your metabolism slows down. Being skinny and being healthy aren't the same."
When Draco was sitting up against the headboard, Harry picked up the water and medicine again, "Here, put the pill on the back of your tongue and swallow it with the water."
Two scourgify charms, and a trip to their dorms to get their bags, later, they were pulling the doors to the potions classroom open.
"Well thank ya, I'm glad ya like it," Hagrid said, smiling at him. Draco ran out of meat to throw then and was forced to look up at him.
After struggling through homework and then eating dinner as fast as they both could - though they wouldn't ever admit it - they were both seated at the top of the astronomy tower happily leaning against each other.
Harry paused for a moment, this was the first time Draco had really opened up to him about anything, and he wasn't sure the first time really counted. The first time, it was about his nightmares and he really didn't go into detail. Harry was happy that Draco was sharing something personal, even if it was just his worries about Quidditch. "Well, I haven't played in a while either if that helps any," Draco looked up at him, "I mean, I wasn't really at Hogwarts last year to play. I think everyone is a bit rusty, so don't worry too much, and when I saw you play for tryouts you seemed to be doing very well in my opinion."
"What? I'm happy for her," He said to all the stares he was getting, "and I have a feeling I know who it is and I'm glad for that."
"What the heck?!" Draco shouted when he came up for air, "You ruined my hair!" Draci continued complaining but slowly stopped and burst out laughing himself when he saw Harry doubled over in laughter.
"Well, when you think about it..... it was pretty obvious I guess," Hermione finally said looking over at Harry who at this finally started to look up and over at Hermione and Ron.
"Yeah," Harry responded, trying to keep his eyes from travelling to Draco. The bottle landed on Pansy next who seemed very happy to have something to do.
Pansy leaned in almost immediately and Hermione met her halfway, their lips meeting as Seamus let out a "whoop!"
Two hours later, they found themselves leaning against the wall of the cave next to each other, a fire burning in front of them.
Harry watched as Draco struggled to do what he was telling him to, and held his hands as he slowly came back to him. "Are you feeling better?" Harry asked when Draco finally squeezed his hands back, tears still running silently down his face.
Hermione was quick to raise her hand and Slughorn happily called on her. "It's a potion made from the Alihotsy plant, sir, it causes uncontrollable laughter."
I was wondering if you wanted to meet up just after midnight on New Years? My parents usually go to bed right after the clock strikes midnight. They have a toast and then go straight to bed, so I was thinking it'd be the perfect chance to see each other? If you can get away that is.
He trailed off, looking out the window, nervous to continue and Hermione decided to prompt him, “Yeah? Do you figure out who he likes or something?”
"Well, not like there's much to do this late anyway unless you're dating someone," Harry said and then blushed a deep red when his eyes met Draco's before turning away quickly.
While Draco was internally panicking, Harry was glaring over at Lavender. He wanted to proclaim that he and Draco were done playing, then and there, but he knew that if he said something, Hermione was bound to question him about it later. So, he sat quietly steaming as Lavender leaned over and pressed her lips hungrily to Draco's.
When they got to the Dinning hall, Pansy dragged Draco and Blaise over to the Gryffindor table, "Mind if we join you today?" Pansy asked, already sitting down across from Hermione.
"You were the one who bumped into me in the first place!" Harry said, voice rising to match Draco's tone.
They all stood out on the lawn three minutes to midnight as George finished setting up the fireworks. Hermione was standing between Harry and Ron, dressed in one of his jumpers. Even with heating charms, they could still feel the cold.
"Who would try to ruin the potion?" Draco said as they made their way back to the dorms, "It just doesn't make any sense."
"Wow," Draco said, running their fingers over their names. "So is this how you never seem to get in trouble even though you never seem to be in bed on time?" he said with a smirk.
Harry happily returned the enthusiasm as he ran his fingers through Draco's hair, pulling slightly as Draco let out a small moan.
"So, what kept you so late yesterday?" Ron said, walking over and leaning against the bathroom door frame as Harry finished brushing his teeth.
In that moment he realized that Pansy was right, that he was perhaps in love with Harry Potter, and that was one of the reasons he was never going to tell Harry. He couldn't stand the fact that Pansy was right and he knew that the second he said anything she'd never let it go.
It made sense to Harry, Ron and Hermione were clearly in love with each other and always seemed to glow brighter when they were particularly happy with each other. "How did you piece it together?"
Harry's head jerked as he realized what he'd just thought, turning towards the match, face bright red.
"First, keep it down we're in the library and someone is bound to hear, with you talking so loudly. Second, I should be angry, not thanking you! All you did was make it awkward!" Draco hissed.
Draco sat at a table in the corner of the common room on a Saturday, watching as people left to go to Hogsmeade. Almost two weeks had passed and Harry still hadn't talked to him. I really fucked up, Draco thought to himself as he slumped down on his textbook.
"Will you ever learn to eat with some table manners?" Hermione asked, looking exasperatedly at the sauce from the chicken Ron was eating, dribble down his chin.
"Well, there was-" Pomfrey began but was interrupted by a ragged looking Draco bursting through the doors.
"No," Draco grumbled, pulling at the hem of his shirt in nervousness, 'We're just going to hogsmeade."
After almost two weeks of pining and struggling to ask Draco to the Yule Ball, he’d finally worked up the courage to do the letter idea that Hermione had suggested. He’d written out a quick note asking Draco if he’d meet him after classes ended for the day, and that he was sorry about the other day.
"He never lets anyone have any fun, he took some of Ron's things he got from his brother's shop and now he has detention. I want to get them back," Harry said with a smirk.
"You're welcome. Now remember the spell for next time or you'll catch a cold," Draco said. Harry turned his attention back to the pathway, he rubbed his hands together and breathed on them as they walked towards the pitch, but Draco's eyes lingered on Harry for a moment longer than they should have.
Their food and butterbeers came eventually after a bit of Harry pointing out different people and commenting on the colors. No one had a new color though.
"Hufflepuff vs. Ravenclaw is the 21st right?" Ron asked, picking up his chess pieces and putting them away into his bag.
"Yeah, of course! I was going to invite you to go with Ron, Hermione, and I but they're going on a date," Harry laughed a bit, "so I was thinking I could go with just you so they could have some space."
Draco squinted at where Harry was pointing. There was a bit of a rock formation that did seem to slope towards the beach, but it seemed a bit more like a cliff than anything else.
"Alright, here give me your hand." Draco reached his hand forward and Harry tapped his wand to Draco's fingers, suddenly coating them in lube. "That'll make it easier."
For some reason Harry felt suddenly very defensive and angry, he hated the way Draco could always get a rise out of him. "I have not been stalking you! I was only trying to make sure that you and your band of Death Eaters didn't burn the whole school down!" Harry knew he went too far as Draco recoiled.
