"Yes."

The blond viewed the tree critically, then suddenly grinned and kissed the dark-haired man. They decorated the tree together. Draco pointed out that most of the decorations were red, Harry pointed out that the tree was green, and they laughed at their antics.
"Oh my, Harry!" she exclaimed as she placed the box on the bed and took out the long, gold chain to examine the teardrop ruby at the end of it. "I love it! I'll wear it for the next ball we attend!"
After breakfast, Harry and Draco perused the internet for jobs. Before leaving the Wizarding World, both boys performed a spell that was used for creating IDs in the Muggle World, so there was no problem with records and such. Harry found a position as a writer, which had interested him since childhood, but Draco had a tougher time. He didn't have many skills that could be useful in the new world he found himself in.
He asked for his trunk and changed in the bathroom once more. The receptionist seemed puzzled at his changed attire when he returned but didn't comment on it. He dressed casually, as he assumed that most people didn't dress up for the nightlife around there. He got a map of the city that highlighted some of the hotspots and left the hotel again.
"It will be harder for you now, though. Wish you had made the discovery a few months ago. Keeping the children with you would have been easier," Draco stated.
Faye really loved this chapter, though she liked the next one more. Icicle, my harshest critic. Again, those blasted comas!
“Thank you for coming, Malfoy,” she decided to say.
"If I got you the broom, you would ride it at home and the kids would want to go too. That would be dangerous for them. Besides, you have no need for a new broom. You hardly ever ride the one you have." He felt justified in his denial.
"Monday."
"Well, we'd better get started with the mingling," the older Weasley said and they got up from the table, leaving Ron to his food.
The bank never closed. The goblins knew that there was money to be made all hours of the day and knew very well that some clients preferred to take their money out in the middle of the night. Thus, Harry gave his key to the goblin at five minutes past midnight.
"Not you too, Ginny. She's my friend and yours too."
"Of course, Mr. Potter. Would you like anything else?"
"I know, he used my blood. Barely made it out alive," he revealed.
"No, I will not have Hermione out on the streets." Harry shook his head, still on his feet.
Harry shrugged and tried the next door, which actually turned out to be the bathroom. He closed the door behind him and went about his business. As he was wondering about what to do for the taste in his mouth, a house-elf popped in with a tooth-brush. He also decided to shower since he still stank of sun and sweat. He was a bit reluctant to put his dirty boxers back on, but he had left his shrunken trunk in Patong. Once he was done, he went out to let the owner in.
"Severus?"
"Fine, fine, I'm up," he managed to get out.
"Yes, I remember Narcissa. She did seem like a lovely woman," Harry agreed.
"Bollocks. And you, letting the Malfoys get away. I don't know what you were thinking. The whole family should have been Kissed and that would have been the end of it, finally."
"What day is it?"
They were seated right next to the bar, and Harry was worried about the potential noise. Luckily Draco didn’t seem to mind.
"Yes! It's a day when people celebrate love and relationships. I got us a table for the occasion," Harry was very excited.
"Why not?"
Harry didn't even have to look at the menu, he always had the same thing: beef Wellington, mash and carrots. Hermione on the other hand took her time and ordered grilled chicken with vegetables. Soon they were both eating, though Hermione seemed to be more preoccupied with her thoughts, than her food.
Harry nodded and Draco stood up. He held out a hand to Harry and the other man took it to stand up. He remembered the time he wouldn't take Draco's hand again. As much as he didn't want to be connected to the blond then, there had always been something between them. Perhaps all this time, this was where they were heading.
"By the way, who is this Adrian person?" Harry inquired.
"You're not a mediwizard."
"Harry, it's okay, you have to," Hermione said, though her quiet voice was a bit hard to hear over the blood rushing in his ears, but the way she touched his hand made him look down on her. "I understand what Malfoy is saying. They are not going to vote for you while you oppose their ideals. It will only be for a little while. At least you'll have your family back with you. I'm sure I can find another place to stay. It will be just pretending."
"What a wonderful idea, Harry! Dad could help you learn everything and Our World needs such an honest man in politics. Of course that would mean attending even more Ministry functions, but nothing I can't handle," she gushed, since she never missed those in the past either. Harry recalled her Apparating in from Bali last year for a Ministry ball, and then she returned the next day. She clearly enjoyed every minute of being the centre of attention on his arm. Not that there was anything wrong with that, since women generally did love those occasions when they could dress up, put tons of make-up on and wear high-heels. Then complain about it all. Yes, Ginny did seem to enjoy the whole show.
"I know. Have you come to a decision yet?"
"But we didn't bring any swimming trunks!" James moaned.
Of course, round two had to wait until morning, when Harry woke to Draco swallowing him whole, proclaiming that he had rested long enough, and it was time to fuck him again. Draco was really a pushy bottom, but Harry didn't mind.
"All right," with these words she gave up, and soon they both ordered.
He looked around, hoping that the blond wouldn't mind. They had spent a lot of time scheming in there and he felt comfortable in the room. He walked to the cabinet where the Firewhisky was kept. He poured himself a glass from the ornate crystal decanter, thought of putting the bottle back, but then kept it with him. He sat down in his favourite spot on the couch and placed the bottle in front of him on the table. He downed the first glass fairly quickly, and then a second, a third, but the fourth one wouldn't slide down so fast into his practically empty stomach. In his quest to drink himself into oblivion, he didn't notice the door opening. He just realised that he wasn't alone when Draco sat down in front of him.
"Albus is my second son. I think he's about Scorpius' age. He's six, right?"
"Then we'll need a taxi. I'm not walking that far."
"Harry!" He looked up, clearly startled, but still managed not to spill the liquid in the mug onto himself.
"What if we go over the plans for the next phase again? Just so that it can be fresh on your mind for your evening meeting with Arthur?" she offered the change from an obviously uncomfortable subject.
He knew what he had to do. Draco had instructed him that when a new member was introduced, he would stand in the middle of the great circular hall and after some words he would need to take a seat. As he waited, he saw both Draco and Arthur gazing at him with an empty seat beside them. It struck him how he still had a choice, which wasn't really a choice at all.
"No way do I want that disgusting man, Potter,” he was still whispering, even though there was no one around them. “I may be gay, but one, I top, two, his idea of sex is not what I would prefer. Frankly, I like to keep my partners more or less intact. His previous toy expired after a month and it wasn't pretty. Also, Potter, if you haven't noticed, I said ‘body slave tattoo', not Dark Mark. It would be the one that he specifically designed for his toys. It keeps the possessor of escaping, or ever having sex with anyone else. It may do some other nasty things, but I'd rather not find out what," the blond revealed.
"He wanted to use me like that too,” Harry said, disturbed by the thought of Voldemort putting his hands on the blond. “However, I thought you would be happy at the idea of getting the Dark Mark and getting your arse filled with his cock."
fathered by the husband.
"You could wear one of Ginny's fancier robes. She has so many, I doubt she has even ever worn half of them," he said, remembering the many times that the end-of-the-month reports from his Gringotts vaults had listed the names of a clothing establishments. He didn't even know there were so many places to buy robes! Not to mention that robes could cost that many
Betad by the wonderful Icicle.
When he was breathing normally again, he kissed Draco deeply. It was strange to know that the salty taste in the other man's mouth was from him.
"Arthur, where is Molly tonight?" Harry broke the silence that threatened to fall onto their table.
They went in and Harry cheerfully approached the host.
"Of course I do. I would like to see what is on offer though."
Still, no matter how much they worked, they always went to sleep in each other's arms. Even if they didn't always have sex.
“Of course.”
They parted at the door and Ginny headed to the clothes section in the back. They mostly sold costumes, but children often enjoyed dressing up in their everyday lives. Harry loved picking something out for his little girl and looked around in a loss as to what he should get Lily. He spotted a section above which said 'Dragons' in glittering letters. Lily had a fascination for dragons of late and he was sure to find something there.
He probably didn't want to miss the astonishment in them at his proposal.
"Is there a toilet?" he asked, trying not to be embarrassed about the question.
kissed the other boy for the first time.
Betad by Icicle.
"About a month into the diet I started to feel more energised. I played with the kids more, but that didn't satisfy me anymore. So I brought out some of my old books and got to reading again. I haven't read anything but brainless novels for such a long time! It was like I had been sleeping for so long and just woke up. I tried to talk to Ron about it." She shook her head, signalling how well that talk went. "I told him that I wanted to go back to studying and become a healer. I have secretly thought of doing that since second year, but he told me he wanted more kids. I don't, Harry. I love them, but two is enough. Ron just ignored me and said that Weasleys always had big families, so we would too. As if my opinion didn't matter!" She was clearly distraught over the matter. "Then I realised I haven't had an opinion about anything, or contradicted him since the war."
"Oh, she did. A Ken too. I never would have thought Muggles could make something so clever."
"True. Old habit. I didn't like you much in school, plus I always did like to rile you up a bit. The only thing I miss about the Weasel not being around is that he looked so funny when his face turned the same colour as his hair." They actually shared a smile over that image.
* * *
"I'll be seeing you around, then. In the future, please call me just Bart," he said, as he got up, clearly finished with the assessment.
Still, as he thought over just what Ron had said, he wondered a bit about just what Ron had done to get Hermione that had been such a grand effort. He couldn't remember anything special.
"Well, if you're sure..."
"However, sometimes I do have to bear the sight of the creature!" she continued. "She is so undoubtedly common. Her parents were dentists, so she said."
“It’s good though. She has no idea what divorce means in the Wizarding world. I can have the kids taken from her and she would never see them again,” he spoke, shaking his right fist. “If she wants to see them again, she’ll have to come crawling back to me and ready to bear me more kids. Did you know that Fleur is expecting her third?” he asked, rounding on Harry, who shook his head. “I will not be beaten by any of my brothers. I’ll have the most children and make my parents proud.” He straightened and stopped his pacing as he said this.
“He allows me no freedom. He wants everything to be his way and for me to be his meek little wife. I know I have been for some years, but I don’t want to be anymore. I want to work - to become a healer. All he wants to do is produce more children. He knows we would not be able to afford any more, but he says he wants to have the most children out of all his brothers. I told him I don’t want to do that, but he just ignored me,” she explained, all of it coming out in a rush.
"Then what happened?"
"He was pissed off at Ron, because he brought him in for some questioning. You know how Ron is; he is always accusing the Malfoys of something. So maybe we could ask him for some advice. He must know some good solicitors."
Everyone looked at the boy in astonishment, who looked back at them with a raised eyebrow.
“Such a lovely speech, Potter,” he said, changing his tone to the way he used to say it. Then he grinned. “I’m not going to be out-romanced by you!”
“Goodbye, Harry,” he said as he threw the Floo powder down.
"But he hates it."
"That was incredible," Draco spoke up.
"Interesting." Harry supposed that in the Potions circles probably many people knew Snape and admired him. The man was brilliant; after all, he made the Wolfsbane Potion.
Harry adjusted his purple robes in the mirror and cringed as the star pattern twinkled on them. Apparently Ginny's idea of the perfect man to dress him as was Dumbledore. At least she had relented on him spelling his hair long and silver. No beard either. Just the robes. For the umpteenth time Harry wondered why Dumbledore insisted on wearing such clothes, but the again, the old man had probably never made it on any "Best Dressed" lists either.
"What is it, Draco?"
Harry just sighed again. He seemed to be doing that a lot lately.
"You can Floo there and tell them that you need the robes in a hurry. Maybe later we could go back and get you some other clothes. If we're associating with Malfoy for a length of time, you'll need it," he explained.
"Someone else was shagging her into a mattress," Harry remarked with dry humour.
Harry huffed a little, but knew he couldn't do anything about it, so he took  the box and placed inside his picture of Ginny and the kids, his clock,  quills and parchments. He almost took his files as well, until he remembered  that he was off all the cases.
"French, German, some Spanish, and even a little bit of Bulgarian."
As the tongue sought out his and began to massage, he felt hot all over. He couldn't decide if it was the Firewhisky or the kiss, but it made him giddy. He sprang into action as well, returning the kiss. Harry felt hands in his hair, tugging him closer as their bodies also connected, and his hands also found the short blond strands. Harry's head was falling backwards, onto the soft armrest behind him. Draco was following him, not breaking the kiss and his body came to rest above his partner's. It wasn't very comfortable, but it felt strangely comforting. The kiss was warm, and Harry could taste even more Firewhisky, but it felt like the best kiss he ever had. The part of his brain that was still rational tried to point out that he didn't have much of an experience in that regard, but he supposed it was like eating chocolate. Even if you've never had much of it, you still knew which one you liked the most.
Harry sighed too and sat up. The morning had started out so well, and now it had all gone pear-shaped. Last night he just went with what he wanted, damn the consequences. However, in the morning, they reared their ugly heads.
The Thai boy had been right. He really was gay. What they had done aroused and excited him more than anything he had ever done sexually before. He wanted Draco. He really had always wanted Draco. And he was mucking it all up. However, he was afraid of what the future had in store for his children. A messy divorce would be bad for them, too. In spite of everything, they loved their mum. He buried his head in his hands and groaned. He had woken up, but his life had become so much more complicated.
"Maybe we could just pull them off?" Harry suggested.
The house-elf appeared with a pop and Harry stared at Draco, not wanting to consider where he was going.
'It seems like she got a Howler as well.' Harry did not dare ask her what  was said exactly.
Draco, on the other hand, went to interview after interview, but he kept embarrassing himself in front of his potential employers. He tried to expand his knowledge of the Muggle World, but the little nuances that Muggles learned through immersion were missing. Draco was feeling worse and worse every day. Wallowing in misery, the blond found himself being lazy in front of the TV more and more. Harry was worried. He was afraid that Draco would completely slip into depression.
"Oh, Mr. Potter, I had my own reasons for doing that. Thank you all the same though," she said, and shook hands with the children.
Ron reached towards his wand, but Draco's hand gripping his arm halted him and the menacing look he accompanied with it took Ron's mind off it completely.
“You’d let me see them?” Ron was surprised.
"What other languages do you speak?" he asked instead.
"She suspects?"
"I'm sorry. I'll be going then." He moved to get up, but the other man was quickly by his side and held his wrist gently. Harry didn't even see him round the table, but there he was, sitting next to him, their legs touching. Draco was so close.
"Did you find something for Albus?" she asked.
"I know. We have to walk to the end of it, and from there the entrance to the hill is not far away."
Harry couldn't hear what he was saying for a few moments as his heart was thumping too loudly in his chest, drowning out all sounds. Then he felt a hand take his and looked down to see pale fingers wrapped around his darker ones. He turned his head to look at Draco, who was smiling. No, that was an understatement. Positively grinning from ear to ear. Harry couldn't help but grin back and for the first time that day, he was calm. He knew that with the other man beside him, he could face the whole Weasley clan with the kind of determination that he needed.
In the evening, once everyone under ten was in bed, Harry and the Malfoys filled Hermione in on their plan of action. She gave her own input and some more strategising ensued. However, soon everyone was dropping off, only Harry and Draco were left awake in the house.
"Shouldn't we go to work?"
Harry thought about what to do. He didn't want the children to go, but they  would be with Ginny. Since their mother had started to travel, they had seen  very little of her. Perhaps, this would be a good thing. The children could  be with their mother, they had been missing her anyway, and once everything  blew over, they could return home. He went up to find Ginny and tell her. He  discovered her in James' room, putting his things into a bottomless bag.  Thankfully James wasn't around.
Draco looked perplexed, then he seemed to remember.
Harry wasn't happy about being addressed so familiarly by a complete stranger, but he supposed most people felt like they knew him.
"Welcome back?" he joked, referring to the haze Harry had been in.
“He’s a blond dragon! I like dragons.” She giggled. “Can I give him a kiss now?”
"Well, I can't let my children be in the same house as that whore. I'm  taking them with me to Mother," she stated a bit too calmly and went back  upstairs, probably to get the kids.
Potions master. I always loved it, but I had to follow the family tradition of politics. Not that I don't love that as well. However, I became a
"Yes. How about we send him an owl after breakfast and request to meet him?"
"I aim to entertain," answered Malfoy. "You are right, though. It is rather boring. However, it's a great opportunity to show Hermione around. I just loved some of the faces when they spotted her among us."
"Harry, better grab some of the food before it's all gone!" Ron exclaimed as he sat down. He was balancing two smaller plates, one on each of his massive hands. He managed to put them down safely before he sat down on his chair. "I don't understand why they never have normal plates on these occasions, just these tiny ones," he scoffed. "So, are you going to get something?" Ron looked questioningly at Harry.
Harry had been sitting there with his eyes closed for some time and he spoke without opening them. Once he did, he felt tears in his eyes at the revelation.
"But Harry!" she whined and he felt a bit better for dragging her away. He couldn't stand it when she used that tone of voice.
"I swear this was already here!" he protested.
"That is the only thing that changed recently. You see, I was feeling off a few months ago. I went to see a mediwizard, but he couldn't see anything wrong with me. So I saved up from the grocery money and went to see a Muggle doctor. He had some tests done and it turned out that I had a Candida infection."
Once Harry made it back to Hogwarts, mercifully virginity intact, he was ignored by Dumbledore, patched up by Poppy and blamed for the whole thing by Hermione and Ron. Harry had had enough. He stopped caring about the whole bunch, and decided to leave the Wizarding World.
"I could ask you the same thing," he managed to get out as a sort of reply.
Once they were finished with their meal, they composed a letter together for Malfoy. Harry sought out his owl, Scops. He was a Common Scops Owl and had his own little space in the attic. The bird was much smaller than Hedwig had been, kind of funny looking too, with big round eyes, but Ginny thought it was cute, and so they bought it at the time when they got married. She had told him that it was ridiculous that he was still mourning his late owl, but on many lonely days she had been his only companion. Harry found Scops sleeping on his perch and had to nudge him awake. Scops puffed and huffed, but stuck out his leg dutifully. His large eyes widened in bewilderment when he was told his destination, but left for Malfoy's home all the same.
Faye beta read this as well. She did this quickly while also editing her own works of fiction. Check out Drarry Shippers, because the links to her fanfics are there, and do read them.
"I like it too," Hermione confessed. "I would love to learn more about Wizarding culture. Books just don't seem to have everything in them. The ones who wrote them were purebloods themselves, so they take for granted things that are strange to us Muggle-borns."
"I already had Dinky bring all of our things here."
"Draco?" He found himself whispering the question as he stopped almost next to the blond man.
"Adrian, you don't have to entice me, I'm already yours for tonight anyway," Draco interrupted the erotic monologue. "However, I do have to stay for a while more and you're making that very hard."
"Planes it is then."
“He … he even accused me of cheating on him with you! Like I would. I never saw you in that light and you were never that interested in dating or women either. I was even surprised when you married Ginny,” she said, between sobs.
She just nodded and they exited the shop. Outside, the clear signs of a large storm were gathering. The sky had darkened to almost night and the wind threatened to blow them away. At the first sign of thunder, Ginny almost jumped into his arms.
"How does the plan sound to you, Potter?" he asked, raising a blond eyebrow.
"Ginny, we could have tried to work it out, to make it better." Harry felt his world crumbling around him.
The next morning they were served breakfast in bed. There was a strong espresso for both of them. Harry was glad for the milk though. They also got a sort of egg dish, which was whipped eggs cut into a square shape with tomatoes and sausages mixed in, mozzarella on top. Harry liked the strong flavour of basil in it.
"All right, but not before you get a divorce. It could be a hindrance to getting what you want."
Harry woke slowly. He was still gripped in the arms of sleep, but felt something warm engulfing his manhood. It felt wonderful. He opened his eyes, and looked down to see a head bobbing up and down under his white sheets. He smiled, and slowly uncovered …
"Yes, I practiced my writing. Are you also a friend of Hermione?"
"Don't you think we make the perfect couple? Just like they did," she remarked as she gazed at the two of them in the mirror.
"I can do something! I'm going to go and speed up the divorce process." There was conviction in his voice in spite of all the alcohol. "I can do it. I just haven't because I hoped I could get her back. Well, not anymore!"
He had flown high up before, but not so high. He couldn't believe that in such a short time they had already flown so far. Below them there was water, and the great landmass of Europe rolling under them. Still, they were going up and up, towards space. However, he didn't feel the thrust of the engines anymore, and if he wasn't hearing them, he would have been afraid that they had stopped. After that, the window was swallowed up by the clouds, and finally, they broke above the cloud cover. At that moment, Harry felt like he had arrived to another world. The clouds below him made out hills and valleys, all shining in the sunlight.
The coffee table before him had an assortment of cakes and other foods, along with a pot of sweet-smelling tea. Hermione assured him that he could eat anything. They had both broken their diets at the Alchemist, but returned to it by the next meal.
Still, he was glad when six o’clock rolled around and he could bid goodbye. He hurried to Floo to the school and pick up the boys, and then they went on to gather Lily. She took his mind off of Ron for a while as she told her father everything of a story about a brave man saving a dragon only to be rescued later on by the aforementioned dragon, which she heard that day at pre-school. Even the boys seemed to be interested as they stayed to listen to the end even when they arrived to their living room.
Scorpius said his goodbyes and dashed out the door. The adults smiled at him.

Galleons.
He first headed to the ballroom in his search for his wife. He couldn't see her there, but what he did see made him stop and stare. He saw Lucius Malfoy, as elegant as ever and dressed as Merlin. However, the strange thing about it was not the fact that one of the greatest Dark Wizard of all time wore the guise of someone so beloved by the side of the Light. The real reason for staring was the elegant woman on his arm, dancing to the waltz perfectly. It was none other than Hermione and Lucius was leading her around the ballroom to the astonishment of many people around them. She was beautiful in a green gown with purple trimmings and around the hems white smoke seemed to languidly dance to the music. Harry realised that she was dressed up as Cliodne, a druidess who cured the sick in ancient times. He remembered her from a Chocolate Frog card, because she was one of the more beautiful people on there. The smoke was also reminiscent of what she had discovered and held in her hand on the card. He couldn't remember what it actually was though. He thought that it was taking the image of a person in a very elegant way. He felt all the more self-conscious in his twinkling stars.
"Yes. Could you help me? I need to find this place." He pulled out the paper on which he had scribbled the name of the hotel, as on the other side he had jotted down the address of the Floo office.
"Harry Potter?" she asked, pronouncing his name in a strange way.
"Harry, would you like to be inside me?"
Once his vault was opened, Harry started to fill his pockets and bag with gold.
"It's Ginnnyy. She's..." Harry shook his head and took another swallow. "A liar. I believed every word!" He shouted, the alcohol getting to him. "Ginnnnyyyy. She said I'm aaawful. Terrrible. Now how was I supposed to know? It's only ever been her. Her. ... Just her." He was wavering between sadness and anger.
"Do you think we wanted to be discovered so desperately?" Draco retorted a bit sarcastically.
Harry made a reservation at the poshest restaurant in town, and was excited for their date. He wore his best suit, tried to comb his hair and made sure he smelled good. He even got Draco's agent to do a little ruse. The man told Draco to dress up as he would be playing at the restaurant. So Draco also got out his best suit. Harry pretended to just tag along as he often did to Draco's gigs.
getting custody of the children,' Harry pondered. The Malfoys agreed with him and the four of them began strategising how they should go about getting the divorce to go their way. As Lucius Malfoy stood to Floo one of his old friends, Harry tried not to dwell on the end of his marriage. There would be time for that later.
"Adrian has a house in Rome we could borrow."
Harry quickly retrieved all the kids from school as planned and hurried home with them. He was glad to see that his wife had not made it home yet. The kids went right up to their rooms, since the two boys had homework. Of course, as always, Albus was eager to start, but James needed a little push to get on with it. Lily wanted to play with her dolls a bit, but Harry knew that soon she would be down, chatting with him as she always did.
"You don't mind us moving here? I should have asked for your permission first." Harry hung his head.
"Good, good. I was afraid you had the arrogance of youth and with all that fame many grow big heads. I'm sure I'll be able to help you a lot once you take your seats. Now my only concern is your wife." Mr. Mildew pulled his lips in worry.
Ginny got up from in front of the Floo and swaying her hips, approached her husband.
* * *
"Well, you know what they say... the easiest way to learn a language is in bed." Draco smiled wistfully.
“Of course it is.”
"Well, if it isn't Potter," he sneered, though his eyes twinkled with more amusement than malice.
"I love you, Harry," Draco admitted.
"Morning, Draco."
"I wanted to do that all day," he smirked.
"Oh, I'm pretty sure I was exactly who you thought I was back at Hogwarts," Draco said and looked down at his tea for a few seconds. "However, I did a lot of growing up since. I no longer think that I'm the best at everything just because I'm a Malfoy. Now, I'm the best at everything because I worked at it." He grinned and the others chuckled a bit.
Harry was glued to the window. He seriously had no idea what Draco was doing beside him, he was so mesmerised by the colourful houses and the seemingly endless stream of people going about their business on the narrow pavements. London was a busy city as well, he knew that, but it never had that crowded feeling. Everyone seemed to move to a slow and steady music, while the people in Rome lived to the beat of a fast-paced pop song. Horns blared from all directions, and their driver wasn't afraid to use it either. Harry resolved not to look forward. He really didn't want to know how many times they nearly hit someone. It was so loud and full of life. They passed a huge and grand white building, that inspite of being built reminiscent of ancient structures, it was obviously a modern construction. They also drove by two sets of very long steps, a great wall of rocks, wound down some narrow streets, and stopped on a really narrow one. On one side there was a row of buildings, on the other side of the street there was a big gate. The flag of the Vatican hung over it, and Harry wondered what that was about.
"Of course they are, Potter! You surround yourself with hypocritical Light  Wizards and then you're surprised when their prejudices show." Malfoy  frowned and shook his head. Then he calmly walked away.
"That is awful. It's not only ugly, but terrible to sit in."
"I got into a band! You were right! I'm going to be a professional musician!" he shouted and soon was snogging his partner.
"It's okay, Hermione. Apparently, the book that I found is rare and was the last one printed on the subject. It's over a hundred years old! The Shoppe owner explained this to me when I bought it. And I only know that much, I was too sleepy to read more last night," Harry said, blushing. He was used to Hermione knowing everything and him listening with wide eyes.
Please don't kill me. I hope you liked it. I was wavering between it being abrupt or not, but I thought I built it up well. What do you think?
Harry groaned, and hurried his steps.
He set the Weasley album aside and his gaze fell on the white wedding scrapbook that Ginny had made. He opened it and the sights and sounds from that day rushed to him. There was a white ribbon from her hair, a napkin from their table and many pictures. He had been so happy that day. They were starting their lives together. It was the beginning of his true life, like The War had never happened. How wrong he had been. For him, the fight was just starting. Then there was Ginny. She had just packed up and left. She had hardly said two words after leaving the Ministry. Harry had to confess that he didn't miss her. What he missed was the promise of his wedding day. They were supposed to walk down the road of life together, side by side as allies. The woman who was beside him was not the one he wanted to spend his life with that day. Or perhaps she was and he had changed? He couldn't decide.
"If I kiss you again, I may not be able to stop. As much as you enjoy it, Harry, I'm not sure if you want to do more." He let his hand drop into his lap, but his eyes didn't leave Harry's.
"I could hardly call the grandeur of Malfoy Manor a 'hole', Potter. That describes your house better."
After they thoroughly explored the each other's mouth, they let go, leaving panting with excitement. After the two of them finished their explorations, they noticed that three women had approached their house.
"If you like my arse so much, I'm sure I can show you a couple of ways to show your appreciation."
"Harry! I want it!"
"Yes. It would be highly inconvenient to take glasses from trays that are scurrying about your ankles."
"What are we going to do about this terrible article, Harry?" she demanded.
"This was built by Septimius Severus," Draco informed him.
"Fine, Potter. Desk duty until further notice. Ron here will get another  partner and you will be alone while you are on desk duty," he sentenced  Harry.
"Arthur thinks I'm going to win."
"Ron, I think we'd better go home now," Harry spoke into his ear as the music had started up again.
"Wand-waving?" Harry was honestly puzzled by that and perhaps a bit insulted.
"Get some lunch!" he called out.
"Draco, listen to me," Harry tried to calm him down after his tirade. "We hardly have anything left. We can't use magic, because they can find us based on our magical signatures. For now, we have a roof over our heads and we can fill our bellies with food. Later, when we have jobs, and we've saved some money, we can get a better house. I promise, you'll decorate that, but for now, we have a home away from everyone."
Harry was happy, and it scared him. He hadn't been this happy probably ever in his life. All right, at the birth of his children, but that didn't last. It must have been an effect of the drug as well, as all his emotions had been muted. However, since his divorce and establishing his relationship with Draco, he had been happy, and so had his new partner. Even the older Malfoys looked pleased. James took a while to come around, but after a while he realised that his father smiled more. He also happened to love the Quidditch pitch on the grounds of Malfoy Manor, once the winter cold passed. They had all started to think of the Manor as their home after a few months. They swam in the pool, had their personal house elves assigned, and the children had their own rooms which they filled with their things. Though usually, come morning, Albus was found in Scorpius' bed, the two of them having fallen asleep after playing. Harry was a bit concerned at how attached they were, but he decided that it was something that would evolve, or devolve on its own. Lili was the granddaughter and daughter to Narcissa that she never had, and was spoiling the little girl rotten. Harry was concerned, but also glad that his little girl had the female attention she craved. It was something else that needed time to resolve.
Harry sat down on the crib mattress and pulled up his shirt sleeve seeing the obvious break in the bone and the name that had made his life a living hell since they first noticed it. He gently ran a finger over the name wondering why it was there and why he was the only one in the family that had such a marking. He was also curious about the letter with the snake, lion, badger, and eagle wax seal; nobody had ever written to him before. Most people in the subdivision avoided him because Petunia had called him a problem child.
“I only came back to London three months ago, back when Lucius died.” Draco said resisting the urge to spit the name of his father. He was secretly relieved that Lucius had died in Azkaban, he didn’t have to worry about his father somehow judging him from his life choices. Ilvormorny is a very long story, as is why I’m now a muggle doctor.” He whispered softly. “Blaise and Luna Lovegood are apparently dating. Pansy and Theodore Nott recently married.”
Bellatrix placed the note down and went back to the bed. “Harry I’m going to get the medication Kieran wants you to have; is there a certain flavor you are partial to?” She asked knowing that children often appreciated having their potions flavored to dilute whatever flavor the ingredients naturally gave it.
“Alright, we will look into that once we get back to the Ministry.” Vivienne remarked. “Andy and I would like to meet with the child, but I don’t think this is the right time. He probably feels overwhelmed with Mr. Black-Snape and we would not want to overwhelm him any further. Why don’t we figure out a date after his healing with Mr. Black-Snape to discuss what he’d like to do about the abuse.” She stood up dusting the invisible crumbs off her grey dress.
The trio sighed slowly separating themselves from their office chairs. Harry sighed seeing Ron and Neville’s expression. “Morning Theseus.” Harry said trying to sound like his usual self but failed since he knew they were all in deep trouble for failing a raid.
“If that is the case, we’d need to see it documented in the Hogwarts Charter or a recent policy from Hogwarts Board of Governors. There are laws in place to protect patient’s rights; both in the muggle and magical world. I am sure that you as an educator can understand our rules. So, provider documentation signed by Lily Potter, James Potter, or Sirius Black with either The Ministry of Magic or Gringotts Bank seal on it; or the documentation regarding Hogwarts Educators and guardianship of students without magic.” Bellatrix said politely grabbing the scroll that floated into her open hand. “See Headmaster Dumbledore, this is the policy that all Healers, Medistaff, and all other staff must follow regarding patient information.”
I'd like to think y'all for reading, leaving comments, leaving a kudo, and bookmarking this story.
“Ronald, please close your mouth.” Hermione sassed looking at Harry and her fiancé really some things just didn’t change and Ron’s manners were certainly one of them. “It’s fine what matters is that there is now one less wizard being abused.” After the war, she was the one who spearheaded the Department of Wizard Social Services and it was her idea about an all magical orphanage. After she learned about Voldemort growing up in an orphanage and everything that had happened to Harry as a child, she was determined to do something so that no magical children had to deal with such heartbreak. Kingsley had agreed wholeheartly and thus her department was born.
He laughed softly at his old nickname the Slytherin’s loved to call him. He knew tomorrow would be fun, Theseus would probably put all three of them on desk duty until next month for punishment for screwing up a raid.
Bellatrix, Vivienne, and Andromeda left the office and shut the door with a soft ‘click’ behind them.
“Funny you should mention that I worked for Florean while I was studying to be a Mediwizard.” Grant teased grabbing the shake since Bellatrix had her hands full with potions.
Bellatrix would have liked to have made up her own cot in the same room as Harry and keep a watchful eye on him; but she had to trust that the night shift would take care of him. Really, she just wanted to adopt the child and raise him as one of her own. No child deserved abuse, starvation, and whatever else those horrid muggles had managed to come up with. She needed to have the conversation with her husband she would not be letting Harry go back to the muggles even if she had to kidnap him herself. After all he was Sirius’s Godson and Draco’s Mate, he was a Black and she would not be taking no for an answer. Harry needed to grow up in a loving home with guardians who supported and were proud of everything he did. “Let’s go, I have something I’d like to discuss with you.”
Kieran was never the biggest fan of Dumbledore due to the fact the Headmaster had a house bias that just ended up hurting the student’s education in the long run. There was nothing wrong with any of the four houses; but Dumbledore went out of his way to worship Gryffindor and look down upon all the other houses. He would also make up reasons for Gryffindor when it came to the House Cup. Most of the Head of Houses had to intercept his end of the year Gryffindor tangents.
“Vernon and Petunia told me that my parents were drunks that hated me!” Harry exclaimed and then quickly tossed his right hand over his mouth to keep himself from speaking further. He realized he might have told Regulus something that he shouldn’t.
Harry hissed in pain as he felt the bone mend itself in his arm. It didn’t feel pleasant, but it seemed a lot better than Skele-Gro. “Yeah, you are a surprisingly good Healer.” Harry teased wiggling his wrist making sure it felt the same way before it was broken.
The blonde wizard had certainly changed since the last time Harry saw him, but then again, the last time Harry had seen Malfoy it was over seven years ago, and the blonde was shackled to a chair having his Wizengamot trial. Harry had testified on both Draco and Mrs. Malfoy’s behalf. Draco had certainly changed in those seven years; his hair was a lot shorter and styled in a quaff. The hair also wasn’t as blonde as it once was. Instead of it being blonde white, it was now a dirty blonde. Draco had also apparently filled out in those years, he was still rather lanky, but he had some nice biceps and shoulders. His jaw had some light stubble covering it. Overall the years had been kind to Malfoy.
Adrien was a tall man with brown hair and brown eyes. “I have a moment but make it fast. I don’t usually have A&E Healers hunt me down personally so it must be bad.”
“Yes.” Bellatrix said sadly.
“Ah, there’s your usual arrogance.” Harry snapped back wondering what had happened to Draco’s ego, turns out it was still alive and well. “I hate to admit it but you are a pretty good healer, probably one of the best I have had since being an Auror.” He muttered turning to the face the pillow not wanting to see Malfoy’s smirk of satisfaction. It was still the same Draco, just maybe a little nicer and good looking.
“I think I’d like that.” Harry whispered but luckily the room was quiet, so Regulus was able to hear it.
“I know love.” He whispered softly brushing back a stray piece of silver hair. He understood exactly what she was feeling because he was feeling the exact same feelings she was.
He wanted to apparate into Surrey and ‘Crucio’ the muggles in charge of the ten-year old’s care. He was just a child, a child who could perform magic. He sighed loudly remembering the day Rigel and Elara first showed the ability of magic. He and Bellatrix celebrated those instances it hurt to think that not even 48km away from their home that Harry was being starved, beaten, and forced to cook all because he was one of the precious ones that had the ability to perform magic.
“Harry.” Kieran began softly trying to broach the topic of abuse gently. The diagnostic x-ray spell would not lie and the evidence in his hand was damning towards abuse and it was just a wrist. He couldn’t imagine what the rest of the body was hiding under those baggy clothes.
Harry took a bite of his wrap listening to Hermione. “That is the main thing that there is one less wizard being abused my muggles who just don’t understand magic.” He said sadly looking at his mostly full water bottle, he took a swig of the water.
The Welcome Witch smiled politely she loved it when people tried to be pleasant towards her. A silvery owl sprung from her wand and went flying off in whatever direction Bellatrix was. Andromeda and Vivienne could have easily did it themselves, but it was less polite then letting the Welcome Witch alert Bellatrix that they were here.
Kieran gently grabbed the bottom hem of Harry’s jumper and gently pulled it up over Harry’s head. He felt rage rise in his chest upon seeing all the of the bruises and burns. He grabbed the hospital gown and helped Harry’s injured arm into the armhole. He saw Harry struggle with the belt he was wearing due to the wrist brace and grabbed the belt and pulled it through the pant loops. He helped Harry off the bed and the pants just fell without the aid of the belt. He could see the lack of nutrition every place he looked. He resisted the urge to sigh or curse at the sheer amount of visible damage on the child’s skin.
They had done it to not draw attention to their neighbors since they did live in a rather muggle section of Croydon. For all their neighbors knew they were rich and successful and had added on an indoor pool. He turned on the hot tub letting it get warm and for it to start bubbling like an angry cauldron in potions class. While the hot tub was heating up, he changed out of his scrubs and into a pair of black swim trunks.
He apparated out of his apartment onto a narrow street about a block away from the address Draco had texted. He walked the short block finding Draco Malfoy leaning against the restaurant. The blonde was dressed rather nicely in a pair of tight dark jeans that clung to his arse, a cranberry oxford shirt, and a pair of brogues. “Hey.” Harry greeted feeling suddenly nervous because judging from the sign it wasn’t drinks but rather a restaurant named ‘The Breakfast Club.’
They found Hermione sitting in their usual spot eating her usual salad. Neville, Harry, and Ron went to the line trying to decide what they wanted to eat. Harry decided on a turkey and bacon wrap with guacamole and ranch with a watermelon flavored water from the fridge, ever since becoming an Auror he was all about eating healthy, Ron ordered a burrito with all the fixings along with some pumpkin juice, some things just didn’t change. Neville grabbed a small cup of fries along with a bowl of potato cheese soup, he too grabbed a flavored water, his however, was blueberry pomegranate.
“Hermione and Neville actually got together shortly after the battle. We were standing in the great hall and suddenly, she kissed him out of the blue; apparently, Hermione and Ron had a breakup shortly before the battle, and she had always had a small crush on Neville and watching him kill Nagini with the sword just sealed the deal for her. The two have been together ever since and are enjoying a long engagement. Ron and Padma had met each other for dinner one night just to talk, they had always been friends since the Yule Ball, and I guess things just spiraled out of control. They dated for about two years before Ron proposed. They have been married about three years now. Ron and Hermione never had any hard feelings with each other after the break up.” Harry said giving Draco a quick rundown on what had happened.
Bellatrix crouched down and her left knee made a sound. “Well, I guess I’m not getting younger.” She teased to herself. “Harry sweetie if you can hear us, we want you to fight. I’m not letting you go back to those muggles, hell I’ll kidnap you myself if that happens and teach you magic myself.
Harry rolled over so Kieran had access to his back. He remembered the burn paste from earlier. It felt cool against his hot skin around the burn from Vernon’s fire poker. The application didn’t hurt other than the initial coldness against his skin.
Harry laughed softly at Draco. “Please you were so obvious at Hogwarts, hell Ron even commented that you enjoyed staring at my arse, and you and I both know that man is obvious to everything but food. I had a great time with you tonight, and it’s obvious that you grew up in seven years and I do enjoy this version of you.” He finished the rest of his drink suddenly feeling rather awkward. “I’m sorry I’m drunk.”
She pulled the blanket up around Harry and looked at her husband who was signing his name at the bottom of the paperwork. “You ready to go talk with Dumbledore?” She asked.
As much as Harry would have loved to give up being an Auror and teach Defense he just couldn’t go back to Hogwarts. He hadn’t been there since the battle, a place he once considered a home was now the biggest part of his nightmares. “I know I just really like being an Auror.” He lied he hated being an Auror, but it’s not like he had a choice in the matter, Kingsley practically dragged him to sign up for training after the battle. He wanted nothing more than a safe job where he didn’t have to worry if today was the day his luck had finally ran out.
Harry heard a voice in the distance he didn’t feel exhausted for the first time in years and most of his pain was gone. He strangely wondered if he were dead. That Vernon must have finally killed him. He reached out a hand and felt a person. He grumbled and rolled over in the comfortable bed and opened a blurry eye. The room was bright and there was a person wearing green. Everything came quickly rushing back to him. The man in green was Dr. Reid and the woman in navy was Nurse Bellatrix. He was a wizard; they were wizards, and they were helping him.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Send her in.” Kieran smiled he’d rather have a conversation with McGonagall any day then this conversation with Dumbledore. She at least could use her brain and could see reason.
“I’d love some.” Minerva couldn’t resist showing Dumbledore her wand again. She’d love to hex him; but figured that’d be a great way to get fired and she had students to protect and care about.
“You’re Welcome!” Grant said to both Harry and Bellatrix. “I should get back to A&E before it burns down without me.” He dramatically said leaving the room. It was almost the end of shift, and he was ready to finish his stack of paperwork and get home to Carina and their newly born son.
Regulus felt the bile rise in his throat wondering who would tell a child such a thing about his parents. “Merlin no! Harry your parents loved you like crazy. Lily had maybe one glass of champagne at her own wedding. She rarely drank and when James did drink, he never overdid it. Who would tell that about your parents?”
Harry listened to Draco while chewing his bite of pretzel. “I imagine it couldn’t have been easy making the decision to finish your education across the pond in some unknown country. I’m surprised to didn’t choose to attend Beauxbatons or Durmstrang.” He said wondering what made Draco decide to run away to America.
After ten minutes and the right knee was perfect, and he looked at his watch and saw that it was 1730 and figured it was getting close to dinner and figured he’d go and put some more burn paste on Harry’s back before hand and talk to the child about tomorrow. He wasn’t going to mention Andromeda or Vivienne yet. “I’m going to go check on Harry and make sure he eats dinner. Grant, I hope you have a good evening. I’ll hopefully see you tomorrow.”
Teddy trotted down the stairs five minutes later dressed in his T jumper, jeans, and a pair of Converse. “I’m ready when you are.”
Harry wondered what Ron’s announcement was, he bent down to Teddy’s level and pulled the child into his arms. “Be good for Molly, and remember that I love you.” He kissed his cheek before stepping back into the fireplace and yelling “Ministry of Magic.”
“You know I can discuss work with you.” He said. “Maybe a little, you didn’t see him mother he has abs now. I did ask him to get a drink with me tomorrow, I used the excuse I never did get to repay him for his testimony at our trial.” He took a sip of the wine letting it mule over his tongue it had been indeed a long day and there was nothing better than having a glass of very expensive wine with his mother, well besides some hot steamy sex, but that wasn’t an option.
“You healed me, besides it was the least I could do, you did fight alongside us and tried to save Percy.” Harry whispered the last part. “I guess there’d be no harm in having a drink with you, you’re actually quite pleasant to be around when you don’t sling insults.” Harry teased lightly writing down his cell number on a piece of parchment. “I’d assume with you spending most of your time in the muggle world that’d you have a cell.” He told the blonde wizard leaning against the counter.
Harry let out a large moan when the Healer asked how the food was. The roll was soft, the right amount of flakey, and buttery throughout the roll. The Shepherd’s Pie was heavy on the gravy, the carrots and peas were well incorporated with the beef and gravy. The potato crust had a nice texture to it, and he could taste some cheddar melted onto the potato crust.
Kieran sat down his wand and gently tilted Harry’s face towards his own face as he sat down on the edge of the bed figuring this was going to be a deeply personal conversation. “Is everything in these pages abuse?” He asked softly gesturing the stack of parchment. “You have an unusual number of breaks; did they starve you?”
“Listen here you slimy snakes. I am Harry’s Magical Guardian, and I will not leave until I get information about Harry.” Dumbledore roared rolling his eyes with Bellatrix’s polite lesson. The woman was a Black she wouldn’t know politeness if it bit her on the arse. While Kieran was sorted into Ravenclaw the moment he married Bellatrix Black and started giving the Black line more children, that made him a Slytherin in his mind.
Kieran sighed internally and sat down in front of the child figuring it would be easier to have this conversation face to face. “I’ve talked to one of our Neuro Healer and tomorrow we will be fixing the Brain Aneurysm since they tend to rupture; right now, that is the biggest priority since you can have a few more dosages of pain blocking potion. Tomorrow morning, we will put you asleep and you’ll wake up with your Brain Aneurysm fully healed. We want to fix the Aneurysm before it can rupture since the side effects of a ruptured Aneurysm can be severe.” He glossed over the fact a ruptured Aneurysm could lead to death no sense in totally scaring the child.
“Mediwitch Black-Reid always a pleasure.” Adrien said following the witch into the room. He saw Regulus holding the child’s hand and Kieran pushing a potion into the IV. “What happened? Reid, I thought you said the Aneurysm could at least make it until earlier in the morning.”
“I’ve learned a few things, the first thing being when I asked him what flavoring he’d like his pain potion to be he had no idea as to what tasted good. The second happened just recently when I asked if he’d like to get the dirty clothes off and into a hospital gown he didn’t want to. The signs of abuse are all there.”
“Of course.” Kieran and Bellatrix said at the same time.
Grant opened the door for Bellatrix and sat the shake down on the counter and left the room.
“Wrist is broken.” Harry cried showing the giant the wrist with Draco Malfoy written on it, it was dark in the cabin so he knew the giant wouldn’t be able to see the name and think that he was a freak.
Draco pulled out in cell and looked at his calendar. “I work until seven, so is 8:30 too late for dinner?” He suggested.
Harry sighed and placed the plate in the proper cabinet and pulled down his jumper sleeves so Vernon couldn’t see the tattoo.
“Let’s just get this over with, I promised Teddy he and I would order pizza and watch a movie after I got home from work.” He said gritting his teeth knowing that pain would soon be coming out of Malfoy’s wand. Surely the git had to be getting some since of pleasure out of this, right. He couldn’t have changed this much in seven years.
“Thank you.” Kieran said leaving the office. He figured he’d poke his head into Harry’s room and check on the child before finding Adrien Burke to discuss the brain aneurysm. He walked the short distance to room 505 which was the room Harry was in. He saw the lights were off and that the young child was fast asleep cuddling the Opaleye. He watched Harry’s breathing for a few minutes to make sure the child was alright before turning on his heel to track down Burke. He was glad to see that Harry was sleeping and wasn’t having trouble with the sleep, his breathing was even, and he looked relaxed.
Vernon snatched the letter from his hand and tore it open. It was from that school mentioned in the letter that was placed on Harry when he was a baby. He tossed the letter into the fireplace; the freak would not be going to that school. He grabbed Harry’s wrist. “Freak, who did you tell?” He roared hearing the snap of bone in the wrist. It was the wrist with that freaky tattoo with the name and dragons.
Harry gently held out his wrist to let the Healer examine it. It was strange he had never been in a hospital before or even so much as seen a doctor before.
Bellatrix was feeling rage and lots of it at everything the child had suffered. Nobody should ever do that to a child. The Black Family rage was threating to make an appearance. She watched Kieran’s grab a soothing potion for burns and gently coat the burn. Luckily, Harry’s spine had no damage.
Bellatrix felt silent tears start to dot her eyes at that announcement that Harry had never received medical care before. She grabbed the child and pulled him close to her and ran her fingers softly through his back in a comforting manner something she would do for any of her own children. “Your glasses?” She questioned figuring he had to see some type of ophthalmologist or optometrist before to have his vision evaluated.
Bellatrix laughed softly to herself. “You shouldn’t have told me that, now I’ll be coming to you with all the shake needs.”
Bellatrix sighed loudly at the mentioning of Regulus’s thoughts on the child’s mental health. “Harry mentioned a Mrs. Gray and a social worker. Maybe Andromeda can find info regarding that. That might have been the first time someone noticed and tried to help, and it didn’t work out.” She wanted to see the muggles who did this locked in Azkaban or something far worse.
“We gave you a medication to numb your pain receptors. So, you won’t feel pain.” Kieran sat down on the stool in the room. “I was thinking Shepherd’s Pie for dinner; but is there something you’d rather have for dinner?”
Ron winced at the mention of his mother. “You three are the only ones I’ve told, Padma and I had the first healer’s appointment yesterday and I just couldn’t keep it a secret anymore. We planned to announce it on Friday during our usual weekly get together at the Burrow. So, can you please act surprised when Padma and I announce it?” He asked not wanting his wife to be mad at him for announcing it earlier than expected.
“What’s Hogwarts?” He asked feeling the pain in wrist intensify again. He yet again wished for a big bottle of Paracetamol right now for his wrist.
“Who knows what he is thinking.” Bellatrix groaned. “What I do know is that Harry has a great team of medical professionals and Andromeda will not rest until she knows that boy has been placed with a family that is going to love him like one of their own.”
“Do you feel like you could eat a little bit of food? I can get you a protein shake in just about any flavor you can ever imagine. I figured a protein shake loaded with protein and all the nutrition a typical lunch has would be easier on your stomach then trying to eat food. We can try that for dinner.” + She asked noticing the child relaxing back into the mattress of the bed.
He buttoned the top of his robes and made his way down the grey staircase. He bought this apartment shortly after the battle of Hogwarts, he had refused to move into 12 Grimmauld Place since it was full of sad memories and he didn’t feel comfortable there like he once did. It felt about like Hogwarts what once filled like a home now felt like a nightmare. “Morning Teddy and Kreacher.” He kissed Teddy’s blue hair. “Thank you Kreacher.” He said eating his breakfast with a cup of tea sweetened to perfection. “Teddy don’t forget that you will be spending the night with the Weasley family.”
Vivienne walked up to the Welcome Witch desk with a warm smile on her face. “Hello. How are you doing today?” She asked politely brushing a stray piece of her red hair that was in her field of vision. “I have a meeting with Mediwitch Bellatrix Black-Reid. If you wouldn’t mind letting her know that Vivienne Riddle and Andromeda Tonks are here for her.”
Regulus wanted to hug the child but knew that most abuse victims tended to shy away from physical touch from another person. “Before I go can I get your permission that Kieran can tell me about your case? It is entirely up to you if you allow that information to be shared. I personally just like to know about my patient’s physical health along with mind things.” He teased gently trying to ease the mood a little.
He smiled watching Harry curl up with the dragon. He dimmed the lights in the room so that Harry could rest some more. He doubted the child was getting the proper amount of sleep needed for a child his age and knew that Hogwarts coursework could be quite impressive; better to let the child catch up on his sleep. He shut the door gently and cast an alert spell in case Harry started to panic or his physical health deteriorated. He could feel Kieran’s magic along the doorframe as well with a similar spell.
Draco smiled at Harry’s admittance that he was no longer dating the red headed weasel. “Do you mind if I examine your wrist?” He questioned not wanting to take the Auror by surprised. He should consider this a magical on his own that he was being allowed to treat an Auror of Harry Potter’s caliber.
Dumbledore stood up and followed the two former students somewhere privately. “I’m Harry’s Magical Guardian and as such I deserve to know what is going on. Hagrid isn’t telling me much of anything because you can’t tell him anything. Now get to talking Mister Reid.”
“Yes, Mr. Potter what were you expecting the Minister of Magic?” Draco questioned he couldn’t just not tease Potter who was about the only one who could dish out some excellent insults and could keep up with his sharp tongue. He noticed that Harry was shaking uncontrollably one of the aftereffects of the Cruciatus Curse. “So, what happened?” He asked seeing a small laceration above Potter’s eyebrow.
Bellatrix uncorked the phial and handed it to the child hoping he could tolerate the heavy vegetable taste. She herself didn’t have an issue with flavoring the nutrient potion; but she was sure her husband, nutritionist, and potion masters would say otherwise.
“Want to me to make him another protein shake, or are you going for a proper meal this time?” Grant questioned politely.
Draco wondered just how much had changed in the seven years he was in America; he still couldn’t believe that Neville and Hermione were a couple. He grabbed his wand from his wand pocket and gently cradled Harry’s hand in his own as he ran his wand down Harry’s broken wrist. “Doing alright?” Draco asked seeing the pained expression in Harry’s green eyes. Merlin, could he easily get lost in those eyes.
She smiled and let out a worried breath she had been holding. “Thank Merlin. I’m glad that he is willing to give you a proper chance. I’m worried about him Reg. He’s so small but I can tell that deep down he is and will be an excellent child. Wait you told him about knowing James and Lily! How’d he take that?”
Harry saw the green flames roar to life and soon found himself stumbling into his flat. He discarded the Auror robes figuring those were not appropriate for muggle London. He flipped through the closet trying to decide what to wear besides settling on a burgundy Henley a pair of form fitting dark wash jeans, and his favorite pair of black Converse. He fixed his hair and sprayed cologne before grabbing his cell double checking the address and trying to figure out an empty spot to apparate too. He grabbed his discarded work pants and grabbed his wallet, wand, and cell. He stuck his wand in his leather jacket, after all it was May and London was unusually chilly this year.
“Have I told you how much I love you?” He muttered on the same page of a warm shower, his comfortable bed, and his arm wrapped protectively around Bellatrix’s waist. “You ready to go home?” He questioned leading his wife to the large row of fireplaces.
So I don't know if I said this in the first chapter but the year is 2005, which ironically would have been the year I would have gotten my Hogwarts letter. Oh wait Ilvermorny I'm American :(
Kieran sighed walking away from the theatres and over to Accident and Emergency. He saw Grant behind the desk reading case files. “Anything interesting?” He questioned leaning his butt against the desk.
Harry grabbed the phial and downed the potion finding it to lack any sort of fun flavoring. It wasn’t bad, but it was hardly the bubblegum or the blue raspberry flavored potions from earlier.
Regulus sighed and flopped ungracefully into his favorite wingback chair and looked at his cousin. “We mostly talked about dragons, but I think he is open to the idea of me. He wondered how meeting me would work once he went to Hogwarts. I think he is willing to give me a few chances. Today we mainly spoke of dragons and his parents. I was able to see a few things lurking under the surface based on his body language or how he reacted to me telling him I knew his parents.”
So, Harry was to be placed with a nice Muggle family far away from the Wizarding World until he turned eleven in case someone was to come looking for him to finish the job. When all along that nice Muggle family was abusing him.
He waved at Grant who was at the large workstation in the middle of everything and went to room three to poke his head into Harry’s room to check on the child. He poked his head into the room and saw that Harry was curled into a little ball the blanket covering him and the child was fast asleep. He sat down at the desk and opened the file to plan how to heal Harry’s injuries and everything else. He saw that the lab work he had requested was in on Harry. He grabbed the parchment the text unscrambling before his eyes. His blood ran cold seeing that Harry was iron deficient, was severely deficient in all the vitamins, his potassium was terrifyingly low.
Harry looked down at his watch and sighed it was almost midnight. “I really hate to do this but I have to get up relatively early tomorrow.” He sighed not knowing how say the next part. “I really did have a great time tonight, and I was wondering if perhaps you’d like to go on a date?” He questioned if Draco wasn’t gay he’d just use the excuse of being super drunk.
Grant rolled his eyes at Bellatrix suggesting she was going to make him the official shake maker. “I’ll only do it for the children. It’s bad isn’t it? The abuse?” He questioned knowing that Bellatrix probably wouldn’t divulge the case to much and usually when he asked Bellatrix about a case, he typically got either a snarky answer, a nod, or shake of the head.
Kieran smiled at the child and sat the hospital gown down on the bed. “I’m going to put a small brace around your wrist to help keeps things stable while I check everything else. Due to previous breaks, I can’t just fix your wrist, I’m going to have to magically rebreak some other wrist bones and mend everything back together. Now depending what the health scan says there is a good chance you have other breaks or other issues so I can sedate you when it comes to fixing everything.” He said softly casting the spell for the wrist brace.
Bellatrix tried not to feel hurt from Harry pulling away from her touch. She adjusted herself and offered her hand for hand holding if he needed or wanted it.
Harry dipped another bite of pretzel into the cheese he laughed softly of course Draco would choose the school with ties running back to his house. “Doesn’t Ilvormorny have their own houses like ours, what were you sorted into? I never liked Astronomy either, I was always falling asleep on the floor. Hermione was always nice enough to transfigure my notebook into a pillow. I just hated how late and boring that class was.” He muttered.
“You’ve also disrupted the waiting room, insulted my credentials, and we have repeated ourselves multiple times about the situation at hand. Mediwitch Reid and I are terribly busy and taking fifteen minutes listen to you repeat yourself doesn’t help other patients that need our help. So yes, I am having you escorted out of St. Mungo’s. Hagrid has sat politely in the waiting room not disturbing anyone or staff members and Minerva asked for a quick conversation about the situation. If she asks about the case, we’ll tell her the same we have told you.”
Draco hesitantly took the chart from the young Mediwitch, he figured this case would be the same, him going into the room and being screamed at for apparently trying to live his life, and rewrite the wrong done to the Malfoy name. Had you have told an eleven-year-old Draco, that he would go on to become a muggle doctor, he would have laughed in your face and then hexed you. Yet here was a twenty-five-year-old Draco, who longed for the colorful walls of his usual emergency department, instead of being yelled at for trying to do his job.
“I know nothing of your history, all that I know is that Bellatrix asked me to come meet with you. If you don’t like me; or don’t want to talk to me that is entirely up to you. I will never force anyone to talk to me. It is clear you are fascinated by dragons; would you like to hear more about dragons?” He questioned know that dragons and other magical creatures were often considered a safe topic and would hopefully help Harry feel safe around him.
“Hello Harry.” Draco said entering the restaurant through the yellow door and heading for one of the waitresses. “I’d like to speak to the mayor.” He told the college aged waitress.
“Good, that is how we hoped you’d feel.” Bellatrix smiled and made the flannel disappear. I’ll be right back with wheelchair.” She figured the quicker they were able to get Harry transferred from Accident and Emergency the less Dumbledore was likely to question his wait time.
“Merlin’s Saggy Testicles. Regulus, please send a Patronus to Healer Burke. The Aneurysm has ruptured, and he has a massive brain bleed along with recent seizure activity.” Kieran said gently as he lifted the almost weightless child back into the bed.
“Reg?” Severus questioned his husband it had been months before he saw that distance stare in his husband’s eye. He could tell judging by how quiet Regulus was when he got home that his husband had a rough day.
“I usually do flavour them for children, but that’s not a bad idea; some of them do taste horrid.” Draco smiled at Harry at his statement. “I assure you I take no pleasure of seeing you like this. I’m a Healer, I don’t like inflicting more pain on my patients.” He left off the part where he had heard enough screams of pain to last him a lifetime. It seemed like his father, Bellatrix, and snake face liked practicing the Cruciatus Curse on Draco despite his mother’s pleas to stop it that he was only a child. They never did listen to Narcissa about their love of torturing her baby; but he would not tell Harry that. No one knew the true story of how he was marked and just thinking about that night made him want to puke.
He walked the short distance to Harry’s room on the fifth floor. He appreciated the move since his office was located on the fifth floor. The fifth floor was where the Mind Healers personal offices were located, it was also the floor where most of the abuse victims were moved to after Accident and Emergency had diagnosed them or provided treatment. He could hear Bellatrix’s voice and it sounded like she was telling Harry a little story.
Harry nodded processing what Kieran was telling him about the social worker and the Aneurysm. He wasn’t used to making his own decisions. He was used to yes ma’am, sorry ma’am, I’ll do better ma’am, and please don’t hurt me. He could tell that this time felt different than that time Mrs. Gray tired and a social worker came to the Dursley’s, and Petunia and Vernon acted like the perfect parents that Harry was just picky when it came to food and was more accident prone compared to Dudley. He couldn’t believe the social worker believed the dung Vernon and Petunia came up with regarding his care.
He sat through the sorting ceremony, clapping when new students joined Slytherin, but his heart wasn’t in it. That night he lay in his dorm staring at the ceiling. Why wasn’t Harry at Hogwarts? He awoke the next morning and went to the Great Hall, still not in the best mood. However, when he arrived in the Great Hall, he was surprised to see that Harry was there joking and laughing with Weasley, Granger, and other Gryffindors. His heart stopped momentarily. Wait. Harry was here after all. A small smile spread on his face as he sat down to breakfast.
Harry turned around to see a petit witch walking towards him. He sighed. People at the Ministry still had not gotten used to his new name. “It’s Black now,” he said.
Shortly before Christmas break, it was announced that there would be duelling club run by Lockhart. Though Draco thought the man was a fool, he would never pass up a change to practice his duelling skills. To Draco’s excitement and trepidation, he was paired with Harry. The two faced each other and then just like that he produced a snake with his wand that slithered towards Harry. He was not sure what had come over him and why he had done it, but there was a snake, nonetheless. And then, seemingly out of nowhere Harry began to speak to the snake. Well not speak exactly. It was more like he started to make very strange noises to the snake, and it was as if the snake understood what he was saying. Was Harry a parseltounge? Did that mean that Harry belonged in Slytherin or that perhaps Harry was the heir of Slytherin? Draco turned these questions over and over in his head. If Harry had been in Slytherin instead of Gryffindor maybe he would be Harry’s best friend instead of stupid Weasley. It was an interesting thought to be sure.
Upon arriving at Hogwarts, he finally glimpsed the famous Harry Potter when they were waiting for the sorting ceremony to begin. Harry was talking with a red-haired boy that Draco correctly assumed was a Weasley. His stomach churned. Why was Harry talking to the likes of him? Didn’t he know better? And worse, if Harry became friends with Weasley that would ruin his chance at being friends with him. He decided he needed to intervene. Going up to him he offered his hand saying, “You’ll soon find out that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.”
Harry drew his wand, but Malfoy was quicker. Malfoy pointed his wand directly at Harry and said, “Expelliarmus!” causing Harry’s wand to fly out of his hand. Malfoy caught Harry’s wand and continued to point his own wand at Harry. “Now what are you going to do? You have no wand so you might as well do as I say,” Malfoy said taking a step towards Harry, a glint in his eye.
“Black,” Draco said as if trying it out. “Yes, I like it. We’ll be the Blacks. But you’re still Potter to me.”
Draco sank to his knees before Harry could say anything and flicked his tongue over the head of Harry’s cock. Harry was already quite hard, and he knew he wouldn’t last long. Then Draco swallowed him down to the root moaning as he did so. Draco cherished the moments when he got to suck Harry’s cock. The weight of it felt so good in his mouth and he loved knowing how good he made Harry feel. “Draco!” Harry cried out. “You feel bloody amazing. I don’t think I can last long.” Draco merely hummed in response. Pleasing Harry was his happy place.
Draco’s heart stopped. Sirius, the convicted murderer was after Harry. Beautiful Harry with his glistening green eyes. No. He couldn’t be, could he? His father had said he wasn’t. But what if his father was wrong? He had to stop him. He couldn’t let anything happen to Harry. Draco crept back to his bed, not wanting to listen to the rest of the conversation.
Married. There was that word again. Draco breathed out relieved to hear it. So, it hadn’t been all a dream. This man that was laying here with him wanted to marry him. To be his forever. “Yes,” he whispered. “I want to be Draco Potter. I don’t want to be a Malfoy anymore.”
“Because I know you, and I know there is certainly nothing that would get me to make an arrangement with you,” Harry replied.
The comment really stung. While it was true that his father had bought the entire team brooms and made a deal with Snape to ensure it, Draco knew that he was also a very talented flyer. And it hurt even more coming from Granger who was a Mudblood and who wasn’t even interested in Quidditch. Without thinking he retorted, “No one asked your opinion, you filthy Mudblood!”
Draco rolled off Harry and they lay there catching their breaths.
Malfoy added another finger, scissoring them to open Harry up even more. This elicited even more moans from the black-haired boy. “My, my,” Malfoy commented, “I knew you’d enjoy this, I just never imagined how much.”
The train gave a sudden lurch and Draco still had not seen Harry get on the train. Was Harry not coming to Hogwarts? Draco wracked his brains to think of some reason that he could use to go check and see if Harry were somewhere on the train. Perhaps he had gotten on the train and Draco had just not noticed. Halfway through the train ride Draco slipped out of his compartment so that he could go looking for Harry. His friends were deep in conversation by then and he figured they wouldn’t notice. Draco walked up the aisle peeking into all the compartments. He saw Granger and Longbottom in a compartment together but no Weasley and no Harry. He continued looking but he knew that if Harry were not with Granger, he was not on the train. Harry, Granger, and Weasley were practically inseparable. His heart sank. Where was he? Draco walked up and down the aisle twice before he gave up and returned to his compartment.
Draco rested his head on Harry’s shoulder. “Not really,” he said in response. “When we were at Hogwarts, I always wanted to sit with you, but I never could.”
Draco kissed his forehead, relieved to hear that Harry had liked it. “I could tell. I just want to check to make sure. I’m always worried I’ll get lost in the moment and push it too far.”
Panting, Malfoy’s cock slipped out of Harry’s arse, and he nudged Harry towards the bed, where they both collapsed.
“Well, if you don’t want to make an agreement, I’ll just have to turn you in. Perhaps you’ll get detention and won’t be allowed to play Quidditch. And oh, what a shame that would be. Who do you play next? Oh, that’s right, Slytherin. I guess your team will just have to find some way to win without you,” Malfoy said. As he talked, he watched Harry’s face for any sign that he was caving. When he got to the part about the upcoming Gryffindor-Slytherin match he could see he had Harry right where he wanted him.
“That’s right,” Malfoy leered. “You are completely at my mercy.” He took a step forward so that he was now standing uncomfortably close to Harry. Harry took a deep breath in. “Scared, Potter?” Malfoy teased.
After their brief encounter, the sorting ceremony began. As expected, Draco was sorted into Slytherin as were Crabbe and Goyle. Potter however was sorted into Gryffindor along with the Weasley kid.
“What? No! Malfoy you can’t be serious,” Harry exclaimed. Malfoy wanted to fuck him? Was he hearing right? Was he out of his mind?
Knowing that he did not have a choice, Harry turned around and groaned as he felt Malfoy’s hand on his arse. “I think you are wearing entirely too many clothes,” Malfoy said as he took his wand and cast a spell that left Harry completely naked. Harry felt so exposed standing there completely naked with Malfoy behind him, still completely clothed. Malfoy raked his eyes up and down Harry’s body taking in the view. Harry was gorgeous, he thought. He had long wanted to see Harry naked and now was his chance.
When September 1st finally arrived, Draco could barely contain his excitement that he would be going back to Hogwarts. The summer had been long, and he could not wait to get back to the castle and see his friends and of course he was excited to see Harry again as well. Plus, this year he would be on the Quidditch team. His father had promised to buy the entire Slytherin team brooms if Draco were allowed on the team and Snape had assured them that he would make the arrangements necessary to get Draco on the team. Draco could hardly wait to play against Harry and prove once and for all that he was the superior player. Furthermore, his father had alluded to the fact that something may happen that would keep the Mudbloods out of Hogwarts. This was good news in Draco’s opinion not because he necessarily considered Mudbloods to be so repulsive like the rest of his family did, but because if Granger were out of the picture perhaps, he would be the best one in their year and his father would stop harassing him for the fact that that insufferable Granger girl was always besting him. Yes, Draco thought, this would be a very good year indeed.
“I’ll never forget about you,” Harry said taking his husband’s hand. The two of them headed out of the Ministry offices, quickly changed out of their wizard robes, and headed towards the Tube. After some debate, they had decided to travel to Paris the Muggle way and take a train. Harry had wanted to travel by train instead of by Portkey because he did not want all of the people in the Portkey office to know where he was going. They had made that mistake on their honeymoon, and as a result, had ended up with lots of reporters in their face when they were just trying to relax and enjoy some peace and quiet as a newly married couple. This was why Harry had suggested that they go to Paris by train and indeed act like Muggles for the entire weekend. Draco had wrinkled his nose at that and had protested but only out of habit since he had to admit that the plan did sound like a good one and if he were being honest he quite liked the idea of pretending to be a Muggle for a weekend and of leaving the Wizarding world behind. In the years that he and Harry had been together, Draco had become pretty good friends with Hermione and this friendship had spurred an interest in Muggle things. He was nowhere near as obsessed with them as Mr. Weasley was, but he had to admit that he did enjoy some of the Muggle programmes on the BBC, and cell phones were very handy.
After Christmas break more of the Muggle borns were attacked and it was announced that Quidditch and exams were to be cancelled. Draco was very upset that Quidditch had been cancelled. He wanted another chance to prove how good he was at it. Furthermore, he wanted a distraction from the invasive thoughts about Harry. More and more, he found himself thinking about him and it was getting distracting. The thoughts would alternate between being annoyed at Harry for the attention that he got especially from Lockhart, (The man was a fraud, but it was still incredibly annoying how he played favourites.) to admiring him, to despising him, to wishing they were friends.
Draco was very excited to start Hogwarts. He would finally get his own wand instead of sneaking into his parents’ bedroom at night and practicing with their wands or doing accidental magic the way wizard kids often did before they learned how to control it. Of course, his father had on occasion allowed him to use his wand, saying that it was good for him to know some basic spells before school started. (Lucius wanted to make sure his son was the best in his year.) He was also excited because he would get to meet the famous Harry Potter. He knew his dad would not approve of him becoming friends with the boy who lived, seeing as it had brought the downfall of the Dark Lord, but Draco could not help it. He had been so intrigued by Harry for as long as he could remember. There was such an air of mystery about the boy. He had for some reason been raised by muggles and little was known about him. But Draco knew one thing, that he and the boy were the same age. Plus, he was excited to meet wizards his own age besides Crabbe and Goyle. Even though he had grown up with them, Draco had always found them to be terribly dull. Neither of them was particularly smart; and he was eager to make friends with wizards who knew their left from their right.
Once back at their seats Draco resumed his position putting his head on Harry’s shoulder and sitting as close to him as he possibly could. “That was wonderful, Mr. Black,” he sighed. “I love you.”
When he was not being berated by his father, Draco found himself thinking about Harry. Sometimes his thoughts about Harry were rage that Harry so effortlessly got people to like him and that Harry was on the Quidditch team, but more often the thoughts were much more pleasant. He would think back to classes they had had together, and the little sarcastic things Harry would say or how impressive it was when Harry made almost impossible catches of the Snitch. More than once he found himself wondering (or perhaps hoping?) if perhaps Harry was his soulmate. Draco knew that he would not find out who his soulmate was until his 16th birthday when the name of his soulmate would appear on his wrist, but he could not help but wonder. He knew his father would have a fit if Harry were his soulmate, but Draco couldn’t help but feel drawn to the boy. They were enemies to be sure, but there was just something about him.
“No! I would never make an arrangement with you,” Harry spat.
“You better watch your tone, Potter. That is no way to talk to a prefect,” Malfoy said calmly.
“Yes, Mr. Black. It truly was. I love you too,” Harry replied, kissing Draco on the forehead.
“I’m glad,” Draco said. And he meant it. He’d do anything as long as it made Harry happy.
Harry gulped. There was not much he could do now that Malfoy had his wand. He took a step back so that his back was now against the wall.
“And what do you think he is up to?” his mother asked.
As the school year came to a close, Draco found that he was dreading the summer because it meant being away from Hogwarts and if he was being honest because he’d be away from Harry. In addition, he would have to deal with his extremely strict father. This had not bothered him so much before he started Hogwarts, but he had noticed over Christmas how strict his father was when compared with the relative freedom he enjoyed at Hogwarts. While other kids were excited to see their families because they missed things like home cooked meals and were looking forward to wonderful trips with their parents, Draco was not. His family wasn’t exactly what you would call warm and there was nothing inviting about Malfoy Manor. On the train ride home, he once again sat with Crabbe and Goyle and stared our the window stewing.
Harry smiled at his husband. It was endearing to him how much Draco cared. “I’ve told you before that I won’t let you push it too far. Besides, I like it when you are in control and when you are rough with me.” Harry kissed his husband. “Anyway, this was my fantasy. And I really enjoyed it. You have nothing to worry about.”
“Yes!” Harry panted as Draco started to thrust even harder. He was close and when Draco thrust again, hitting his prostate he came spilling his seed all over his belly. Seeing Harry come, sent Draco over the edge and soon he was coming inside Harry. He collapsed on the black-haired man panting.
“Get out of my way, Malfoy!” Harry shouted.
“Yes, well if you still call me Potter, I’m still going to call you Malfoy,” Harry teased. Draco scowled and Harry chuckled before pulling him into another kiss. “Now Draco, please don’t make me ask again. I need you inside of me,” he whined.
“As you wish,” Malfoy smirked sticking a finger in Harry’s arse and drawing a moan from the other boy. Malfoy began to pump his finger in and out of Harry, opening him up. Harry sighed at the contact and rested his forehead against the wall, closing his eyes. He focused on the feeling of Malfoy’s finger inside of him and the way it felt to have Malfoy standing so close. If he were being honest, he had fantasised about exactly this many times before.
Hello, my lovelies, I know it has been a while since I posted but I promise I have not forgotten about this story. This chapter is obviously not complete but I wanted to post what I have so far and I will edit the chapter when I finish. Thanks for being understanding.
True to his word, Harry didn’t last long. Draco was excellent at sucking cock and soon enough Harry was coming in his mouth. Draco swallowed and got to his feet. “We should return to our seats,” he said as Harry adjusted himself. Harry nodded and followed his husband back to their seats.
Harry shivered at those words, his cock becoming erect. Unlike when they were at school, Draco usually called him Harry now. But he’d sometimes still call him Potter when he was angry, and they were in a fight. And their fights would almost always lead to very heated and passionate sex during which Draco would take charge and hold him down and fuck him until he could barely move just the way Harry liked. During one of their make-up sex sessions they had laughed about how much easier it would have been if they had had sex when they were at Hogwarts together, but Harry liked that there had been some twists and turns in getting to where they were now because he felt that it made their relationship stronger and made them appreciate each other more. “You can still call me Potter in private,” he murmured before pulling Draco’s lips to his.
Thank you for reading. I really hope you enjoyed it. Comments and/or kudos are always welcome.
Harry moaned. He absolutely loved it when Draco took charge and when he called him a slut. He reached his hand down his pants and began to stroke his cock. Draco thrust deeper into Harry’s mouth. “Gods, I love how turned on you get when you are choking on my cock,” he moaned watching Harry touch himself. Harry looked so perfect kneeling for him with his hand down his pants. He briefly wondered how he had gotten so lucky. How a man like him could deserve Harry. But he quickly pushed those thoughts out of his head and just enjoyed the sensation of having Harry’s lips wrapped around his cock. He thrust in and out of Harry’s mouth a few more times but he knew he wouldn’t last long. He was so close. “Harry, I’m going to come,” he rasped.
“Hmmm?” Harry said watching the scenery flash past.
“Fuck,” Harry moaned.
“Enjoying the view,” Harry bit out. He was tired of waiting and wished that Malfoy would just get on with it already.
Harry smiled and kissed his forehead. “I always wanted to sit with you too,” he laughed remembering how Ron and Hermione had been annoyed at how obsessed he’d been with Draco especially in their 6th year. Draco cuddled closer to Harry, relishing the warmth.
“The Ministry seems to think that he’s after Potter, but personally, I doubt it. He’s a blood traitor after all.”
Weasley was outraged when he heard that and pointed his wand at Draco. However, the curse backfired and Weasley started vomiting slugs. Draco smirked and set off with the rest of the Slytherin team and began to practice. Draco mounted his broom and zoomed around the Quidditch pitch. The cool air rushed past him and cleared his head. Flying always had a calming affect on him and helped him to process his feelings. He did not regret standing up for himself. She had no right to say he was only on the team because his father was rich. Draco was an excellent Quidditch player. But he knew he should not have called her Mudblood. Even though it was true that she was raised by Muggles, he knew that he should not use such a word. His father had instilled in him from a young age that Pure-blood wizards were superior, but Draco did not see it as so black and white. He believed that wizards should be judged more based on merit and their magical ability than on blood status. Take Crabbe and Goyle for example, although they were from old Pure-blood families they were total buffoons and could hardly do any magic while Granger could do very advanced magic. Shouldn’t that matter? And yet, the girl really got under his skin. She was so annoying and such a show-off. Not to mention she was close to Harry and sometimes wondered if they had feelings for one another. No. He certainly should not have said Mudblood but he could not bring himself to fully regret what he had said.
“But it’s a boy.”
“That happened over twelve years ago, I was twelve when that happened and I had never used the floo before.” Harry reminded rolling his eyes, Ron was good about bringing things up that happened years ago, and he did not want to be reminded of that, he didn’t want to be reminded about a lot of things.
“Fuck,” Draco muttered, his head starting to dully throb. “How did you get past my father’s background check?”
But Draco is Head Auror now, and I know how important reputation is to him.
My usuals slowly make their way off, grumbling and moaning like they always do when I wake them.

He was right. I think it’s because I had experienced so much roughness already. I prefer a simple, calm life. I get to have that with Draco.

“Yes, we do! For Ron and Hermione! And we could at least try it once,” Harry protested weakly. (He did not seem very fond of the idea either).
So yeah, I’m looking at my palms—the palms of the dead bloke. This bloke’s hands are scarred and dirty and rough. I think my own hands used to look like this. I used to study the raised purple ‘

“Yeah, that’s more my speciality,” Harry snickered. “Also, I have a special gift for you if your next Bludger lands in Smith’s breakfast cereal tomorrow morning.” He wrapped his arm around Draco’s waist and pulled him in close. His hand slid down to cup Draco’s arse through his trousers.
Tosser fumbles around, pulls out the bin, and starts retching until it all comes up, wet and slurpy sounding. He smells like rotten sweet peach and treacle tart. No—I made that last one up. Everything reminds me of you if I let it.

ideas,” Draco said, rough. “I want to hear more.” Draco smirked as he crowded Harry against the shelf. He tilted Harry’s neck to the side and bit down at his pulse point, scraping his teeth along Harry’s exposed skin.
When I close my eyes, I see my father in his casket—that dried-up, shrivelled, rotten shell. His sunken, flaked off face. That wasn’t Father, but it was, and it was horrible, and it was real.
Harry groaned loudly and wildly.
” Malfoy smiles sadly. “You spend so much time living as someone else, that you forget who you actually are,” he continues. “At first, I thought he was just tired—all his speeches, Ministry consultations, the wedding planning…” Malfoy coughs and looks away. “No further comment.”
Draco and Harry, sweaty and bloody, eventually made it to the registers for check out.

cup tightens. “I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.”
My heart starts beating hard and fast like a machine gun against my ribs. “Do you want me to tell you to stay in Paris with me?” I laugh roughly. “Do you want me to tell you that Kingsley and Robards are wrong? We’re not good here, Potter.”
I responded that I wouldn't be changing my mind.
Your raw-bitten lips, your chipped teeth, your fucking mouth. I hate all of them, but really I don’t.
“No, not Hermione— Sheila. Did you happen to feed her by chance?” Harry asked.
Harry watched him closely, a hint of a self-satisfied smile tugging at his mouth.
“Fuck off.” I swallow down a couple spare chunks stuck to my throat that didn’t make it all the way up, then turn to face you.

Switzly’s eyes rounded as she answered hastily, “Oh, no,
“Do it again.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco said again, because he really, really was. Yet he loved his father, and he hated his father, and he didn’t know how to only feel one thing. You can hate that you care, but it doesn’t stop you from caring.
Mother remained quiet as usual.
Switzly straightened up, throwing her tiny shoulders back. “Switzly only wants to find sirs a mattress,” she said to them, scowling. “Then Switzly will have a stiff drink,” she muttered to herself.
He’s walking—not walking;

So I tell him that I’ll start preparing the fish as soon as I clean up.
“Brilliant, Switzly,” Harry said to her, and she ran off as fast as her tiny legs could go. (Which wasn’t very fast.)
The wet skin under my eyes stings. “When you don’t have a soul, your body shrinks into itself; it shrivels up and dries up hard and solid and black,” I say. “Wish I could cry until I dry up, too.”
Your hand suddenly feels heavy against me, weighing me down until I sink into the mattress. “Who said that?”
“Yeah.” I lay on my side beside you. My robes are damp from stomach acid and tears.
The owl watched them impatiently. She had a small envelope with streaks of blood on it attached to her.
Switzly blinked.
Harry laughed and leaned in close. “How could I forget? We hung ourselves on that cross till the morning.”
Draco smiled. “I always do, darling.”
Your eyes are red, your pupils almost blown. Your skin is grey-tinged and sallow, and you're not the one who’s dead. “Merlin,” I say, hoarse. “How much bloody Dreamless did you shoot up this time?”
Draco sighed in disappointment as he looked up from the letter. “I keep instructing Rotsely to avoid saying please and thank you, but I still haven’t managed to get through to him.
